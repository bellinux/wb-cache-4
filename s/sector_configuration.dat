We present here the methodologies and tools of the SESAR 07. 05. 04 VP- 755 exercise, which consisted in a performance assessment of <b>sector</b> <b>configuration</b> plans based on this new paradigm.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{describes}} a method combining operational deterministic and stochastic approaches to generate optimised and smooth <b>sector</b> <b>configuration</b> plans. First, sector configurations commonly used within an Area Control Centre (ACC) are sorted {{according to a}} set of objectives for each time period. From these Pareto-optimal solutions, we determine through a stochastic method new sector configurations, mainly unstructured, to improve criteria such as the workload distribution. Then these optimized configurations are remodelled with another stochastic function to compute a set of final configurations acceptable to air traffic controllers. Secondly, we integrate these good solutions throughout the day to build the smoothest <b>sector</b> <b>configuration</b> plan possible, using the minimization of a dedicated distance function between successive configurations. Results of the SESAR 07. 05. 04 VP- 755 experiments demonstrate that such methods could improve several criteria at the level of an ACC, such as the French Reims ACC, and pave the way for the development of an automated decision support tool integrating such algorithms...|$|E

40|$|A Mixed Integer Linear Programming {{method is}} used for {{creating}} sectors in Fort Worth, Cleveland, and Los Angeles centers based on several days of good-weather traffic data. The performance of these sectors is studied when they are subjected to traffic data from different days. Additionally, the advantage of using different sector designs {{at different times of}} day with varying traffic loads is examined. Specifically, traffic data from 10 days are used for design, and 47 other days are played back to test if the traffic-counts stay below the design values used in creating the partitions. The primary findings of this study are as follows. Sectors created with traffic from good-weather days can be used on other good-weather days. <b>Sector</b> <b>configurations</b> created with two hours of traffic can be used for 6 to 12 hours without exceeding the peak-count requirement.

Nowadays, several projects are launched, aimed at modernizing the global air transportation system and air traffic management. In recent years, special interest has been paid to the solution of the airspace sectorization problem. This thesis is devoted to studying the airspace sectorization in Europe and the possibilities to improve it. The airspace sectorization needs to be optimized with the support of automation in order to increase an adaptability of airspace <b>sector</b> <b>configurations</b> to the new traffic demands. The aim of the first part of this thesis is to propose a global method for the sector design of the European airspace based on a mathematical modeling and heuristic optimization methods. The proposed resolution method to solve the sector design problem is based on the initial division of the airspace into Voronoi cells using k-means clustering algorithm. Then, due to the induced combinatorial complexity, a stochastic optimization method is applied to solve the sector design problem. Resolution method based on metaheuristic algorithm called Genetic Algorithm (GA) has been developed to build airspace sectors in several control areas of Europe, involving traffic data for several days.

In {{air traffic}} {{management}} (ATM) all necessary operations (tactical planing, <b>sector</b> <b>configuration,</b> required staffing, runway configu-ration, routing of approaching aircrafts) rely on accurate measurements and predictions of the current weather situation.

40|$|We {{present a}} model and a {{numerical}} example to analyse capacity decisions within a re-designed Air Traffic Management (ATM) value-chain. We assume a new role for the Network Manager (NM), having contractual relations with Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) and Aircraft Operators (AOs). The NM orders en-route airspace capacity from ANSPs at strategic level and defines/adjusts sector opening schemes at pre-tactical level (capacity management). On the demand side, the NM offers trajectory products to AOs, which are defined based on both AOs’ business/operational needs and network performance goals (demand management). In this context, we develop a mathematical model which underlines {{a part of this}} joint capacity and demand management process. The model aims at minimizing the sum of cost of capacity provision and cost of delays and re-routings, by managing airspace <b>sector</b> <b>configuration</b> over time and trajectory assignments.

In contrast, the meridional overturning circulation continues to vary with Southern Ocean wind stress, but with reduced sensitivity in the limit of high wind stress. Both the circumpolar transport and meridional overturning continue to vary with diapycnal diffusivity at all model resolutions. The circumpolar transport becomes less sensitive to changes in diapycnal diffusivity at higher resolution, although sensitivity always remains.

The rollouts algorithm achieves costs within 2 % of optimal for these instances, on average. For larger problem instances that are representative of future operations and have thousands of possible configurations, excessive computation time prohibits the use of exact dynamic programming.

40|$|Abstract. Adopting the Counting Grid (CG) {{representation}} [1], the Spring Lattice Counting Grid (SLCG) model uses {{a grid of}} feature counts {{to capture}} the spatial layout {{that a variety of}} images tend to follow. The images are mapped to the counting grid with their features rearranged so as {{to strike a balance between}} the mapping quality and the extent of the necessary rearrangement. In particular, the feature sets originating from different image sectors are mapped to different sub-windows in the count-ing grid in a configuration that is close, but not exactly the same as the configuration of the source sectors. The distribution over deformations of the <b>sector</b> <b>configuration</b> is learnable using a new spring lattice model, while the rearrangement of features within a sector is unconstrained. As a result, the CG model gains a more appropriate level of invariance to re-alistic image transformations like view point changes, rotations or scales. We tested SLCG on standard scene recognition datasets and on a dataset collected with a wearable camera which recorded the wearer’s visual in-put over three weeks. Our algorithm is capable of correctly classifying the visited locations more than 80 % of the time, outperforming previous approaches to visual location recognition. At this level of performance, a variety of real-world applications of wearable cameras become feasible. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} a {{numerical}} {{study has been}} undertaken to investigate turbulent flow and heat transfer {{in a number of}} flow problems, representing the gas-cooled reactor core flows. The first part of the research consisted of a meticulous assessment of various advanced RANS models of fluid turbulence against experimental and numerical data for buoyancy-modified mixed convection flows, such flows being representative of low-flow-rate flows in the cores of nuclear reactors, both presently-operating Advanced Gas-cooled Reactors (AGRs) and proposed ‘Generation IV’ designs. For this part of the project, an in-house code (‘CONVERT’), a commercial CFD package (‘STAR-CD’) and an industrial code (‘Code_Saturne’) were used to generate results. Wide variations in turbulence model performance were identified. Comparison with the DNS data showed that the Launder-Sharma model best captures the phenomenon of heat transfer impairment that occurs in the ascending flow case; v^ 2 -f formulations also performed well. The k-omega-SST model was found to be in the poorest agreement with the data. Cross-code comparison was also carried out and satisfactory agreement was found between the results. The research described above concerned flow in smooth passages; a second distinct contribution made in this thesis concerned the thermal-hydraulic performance of rib-roughened surfaces, these being representative of the fuel elements employed in the UK fleet of AGRs. All computations {{in this part of the}} study were undertaken using STAR-CD. This part of the research took four continuous and four discrete design factors into consideration including the effects of rib profile, rib height-to-channel height ratio, rib width-to-height ratio, rib pitch-to-height ratio, and Reynolds number. For each design factor, the optimum configuration was identified using the ‘efficiency index’. Through comparison with experimental data, the performance of different RANS turbulence models was also assessed. Of the four models, the v^ 2 -f was found to be in the best agreement with the experimental data as, to a somewhat lesser degree were the results of the k-omega-SST model. The k-epsilon and Suga models, however, performed poorly. Structured and unstructured meshes were also compared, where some discrepancies were found, especially in the heat transfer results. The final stage of the study involved a simulation of a simplified 3 -dimensional representation of an AGR fuel element using a 30 degree <b>sector</b> <b>configuration.</b> The v^ 2 -f model was employed and comparison was made against the results of a 2 D rib-roughened channel in order to assess the validity and relevance of the precursor 2 D simulations of rib-roughened channels. It was shown that although a 2 D approach is extremely useful and economical for ‘parametric studies’, it does not provide an accurate representation of a 3 D fuel element configuration, especially for the velocity and pressure coefficient distributions, where large discrepancies were found between the results of the 2 D channel and azimuthal planes of the 3 D configuration.

Many African {{countries}} {{present the}} observer with a paradox: though richly endowed with mineral wealth, {{these countries are}} among the least-developed in the world. Mineral resources have historically been {{an important source of}} revenue for the state and one finds great diversity in the strategies that states have employed to access this wealth. These strategies range from direct participation in mining activity by means of state-owned companies to more indirect methods such as taxes levied on mining activity, with approaches varying not only among states, but also over time as historically certain strategies with regard to state involvement in mining have come to predominate. This study develops a typology of public/private <b>sector</b> <b>configurations</b> in the mining sector. The typology consists of three models, a direct participation, market-led and sustainability model. This typology serves as an analytical tool to investigate the impact of mining codes on sustainable development. The study concludes that in many cases the investment-oriented mining code reform undertaken by African states in the 1980 s and 1990 s has had a negative impact through the social and environmental costs associated with mining. Increasing recognition of these costs has resulted in the emergence of a sustainability model...|$|R
