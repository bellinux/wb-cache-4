The Doctor <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that Ben will become an Admiral and that Polly will look after Ben, but it is unclear {{if this is a}} {{prediction}} or simply wishing them well. In the audio story The Five Companions, an older Polly tells the Fifth Doctor that she and Ben are still together.|$|E

25|$|Paneb {{was accused}} of many charges of sexual assault and adultery, though there are many ambiguities in the text which make {{the exact nature of}} the charges unclear. The charges are special in that they are alleged by his son Aapehty to the door-keepers, who are the people who stand {{at the door of the}} tomb at work-sites, but also serve various other functions, {{including}} possible legal functions. Though Černý <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that the door-keepers might have served the role of bailiffs, A.G. McDowell, a prominent Egyptologist in the study of Deir el-Medina, speculates that the door-keepers' legal function was small, and that Aapehty only testified to them because they stood in a public part of the worksite.|$|E

25|$|In a dark, private lair in a tower {{high above}} the park, the Phantom (now {{revealed}} as Phantasma's owner and mastermind) interacts with an automaton that resembles Christine ("The Aerie"). In spite of the years that have passed and his many successes, the Phantom still longs {{to be reunited with}} her ("Til I Hear You Sing"). Meg intrudes and presses the Phantom for feedback on her performance, but he is distracted by his thoughts of Christine and dismisses Meg as an annoyance. Madame Giry is irritated that the Phantom still <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> only of Christine after all that she and Meg have done for him over the years. Giry recounts how she and Meg helped smuggle him out of Paris and to a ship departing from Calais, on which they escaped to America. Ignoring her, the Phantom summons Miss Fleck, who appears with two other freak show performers, Dr. Gangle and Mr. Squelch. The Phantom has them dispatch a letter to Christine, inviting her to come and perform at Phantasma ("Giry confronts The Phantom/Til' I Hear You Sing (Reprise)").|$|E

500|$|Kettner's Book of the Table of 1877, {{describing}} Francatelli as [...] "a type of all {{the great}} French cooks", asserted that he [...] "gives a most elaborate recipe for aspic jelly; and he is so satisfied with it that, having to prepare a cold supper for 300 people, he works it up {{in every one of}} his 56 dishes which are neither sweet nor hot. The book further argues that [...] "this is the result of science—this the height of art. It produces, with such elaborate forms and majestic ceremonies, an aspic jelly without aspic, that, exhausted in the effort, it can proceed no further, and <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that here at last, in this supreme sauce, we have a sure resting-place—the true blessedness—the ewigkeit." ...|$|E

500|$|Egan said: [...] "I love {{working with}} Michael Muhney. I heard about him because {{my mom had}} watched Y before I joined. So when I told her my {{character}} {{was going to be}} mixed up with Adam, she went, 'Oh! He is so good, but so bad'". Egan said that her mother [...] "told me he was a great character, but an evil one, so I was really excited. And now knowing Michael, it has been so much fun." [...] She said that [...] "everyone <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> we have good on-screen chemistry" [...] and that [...] "it's an interesting energy between Chelsea and Adam being the [...] "bad guys" [...] in town." [...] Egan said Adam was Sharon's biggest supporter when Chelsea had Billy's baby and gave him up.|$|E
500|$|Kevin Lyon observes, [...] "The plot {{revolves}} around the audacious and quite unexpected transference of guilt from the maniacal killer (about whom we learn very little, itself unusual for Argento) to the eminently likeable hero, surely the film's boldest stroke." [...] While noting that the device is [...] "striking", McDonagh comments that this transmission of guilt occurs between two dark doubles who are severely [...] "warped" [...] individuals. She suggests that [...] "Neal and Berti... act as mirrors to one another, each twisting the reflection into a warped parody of the other." [...] Berti's obsession with Neal's fiction compels him to commit murder in homage to the writer, while Neal <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that his own violent acts are simply part {{of some kind of}} [...] "elaborate fiction". When the bloody Neal is confronted by Giermani immediately after having killed numerous people, Neal screams at him, [...] "It was like a book... a book!" ...|$|E
500|$|In {{parallel}} storylines, Toby has {{a meeting}} with union leaders concerned about cheap imports from China – in particular bras. Imposing trade restrictions, however, could be damaging to the US auto industry. Josh has {{a meeting with}} the Base Closing Commission. Deciding which military bases to keep and which to shut down is not only politically hazardous, but a job he finds extremely boring. Leaving the room, he comes back to find his intern Ryan in the act of pulling a confidence trick to get a power Congressman's favor regarding a base in his district, without his approval. He tells Ryan to clean out his desk but the intern <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> Josh is kidding in order to throw the Congressman off the track of their [...] "secret plan". When the democratic Mayor of D.C. (Pickens) comes out in favour of a pilot school vouchers programme, everybody is surprised, but after taking advice from Charlie about his assistant's own public school experiences in the city, the president agrees to support the plan.|$|E

500|$|Eisenhower had {{supported}} nuclear testing after World War II. In 1947, he rejected arguments by Stafford L. Warren, the Manhattan Project's chief physician, concerning the detrimental {{health effects of}} atmospheric testing, agreeing instead with James Bryant Conant, a chemist and participant in the Manhattan Project, who was skeptical of Warren's then-theoretical claims. Warren's arguments were lent credence {{in the scientific community}} and public by the Castle Bravo test of 1954. Eisenhower, as president, first explicitly expressed interest in a comprehensive test ban that year, arguing before the National Security Council, [...] "We could put [...] on the spot if we accepted a moratorium... Everybody <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that we're skunks, saber-rattlers and warmongers. We ought not miss any chance to make clear our peaceful objectives." [...] Then-Secretary of State John Foster Dulles had responded skeptically to the limited arms-control suggestion of Nehru, whose proposal for a test ban was discarded by the National Security Council for being [...] "not practical." [...] Harold Stassen, Eisenhower's special assistant for disarmament, argued that the US should prioritize a test ban as a first step towards comprehensive arms control, conditional on the Soviet Union accepting on-site inspections, over full disarmament. Stassen's suggestion was dismissed by others in the administration over fears that the Soviet Union would be able to conduct secret tests. On the advice of Dulles, Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) chairman Lewis Strauss, and Secretary of Defense Charles Erwin Wilson, Eisenhower rejected the idea of considering a test ban outside general disarmament efforts. During the 1952 and 1956 presidential elections, Eisenhower fended off challenger Adlai Stevenson, who ran in large part on support for a test ban.|$|E

2500|$|... "Y is almighty" [...] {{means that}} Y {{is not just}} more {{powerful}} than any creature; no creature can compete with Y in power, even unsuccessfully. In this account nothing like the omnipotence paradox arises, but perhaps that is because God is not taken to be in any sense omnipotent. On the other hand, Anselm of Canterbury <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that almightiness {{is one of the}} things that make God count as omnipotent.|$|E

Although Roma <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> {{of himself as}} a latter-day cowboy and regards his ability to make a sale as a sign of his virility, he admits only to himself that it is all luck. He is ruthless, dishonest and immoral, but succeeds because he has a talent for figuring out a client's weaknesses and crafting a pitch that will exploit those weaknesses. He is a smooth talker and often speaks in grand, poetic soliloquies.|$|E

He <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that the political problem of Puerto Rico limits itself to a fight between himself and the Nationalists, that no holds are barred in that fight and that everybody else should keep out. As a matter of fact he has played the Nationalist game and they have played his.|$|E

2500|$|Henry however, {{disagrees with}} Clifford, arguing that {{passing on the}} burden of kingship is not {{necessarily}} the natural thing for a father to do, as it brings no reward when that title was unlawfully obtained in the first place ("things ill got, had ever bad success": Henry is referring to the deposition and assassination of Richard II by his own grandfather, Henry IV). By disinheriting his son, Henry <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> he is protecting the Prince, ensuring that he will never suffer the hardships he himself experienced when he was left a usurped inheritance by his own father ("I'll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind and would my father had left me no more"); ...|$|E
2500|$|After a {{close reading}} of the Thesmophoriazousae, the {{historian}} Jane McIntosh Snyder observed that Agathon's costume was almost identical {{to that of the}} famous lyric poet Anacreon, as he is portrayed in early 5th-century vase-paintings. [...] Snyder theorizes that Agathon might have made a deliberate effort to mimic the sumptuous attire of his famous fellow-poet, although by Agathon's time, such clothing, especially the κεκρύφαλος (kekryphalos, an elaborate covering for the hair) had long fallen out of fashion for men. [...] According to this interpretation, Agathon is mocked in the Thesmophoriazousae not only for his notorious effeminacy, but also for the pretentiousness of his dress: [...] "he <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of himself, in all his elegant finery, as a rival to the old Ionian poets, perhaps even to Anacreon himself." ...|$|E
