However, a general model that accounts for the formation and evolution of these various surface-instability patterns still does not exist.

40|$|Biot's {{theory of}} plane strain <b>surface</b> <b>instability</b> of an {{isotropic}} elastic body under initial stress in finite strain is extended to include higher order strain-gradients. Higher order strain-gradients are properly {{introduced in the}} definition of the strain energy density, leading to an anisotropic gradient elasticity theory with surface energy. Accordingly the present theory includes two material lengths characterizing the volume strain energy and the surface energy of the elastic body. The consideration of these two material lengths leads to the occurrence of a boundary layer. This in turn, gives rise to interesting phenomena related to the stability of the half-space, i. e. extra <b>surface</b> <b>instability</b> modes, thin skin effects and significant weakening of the half-space. It is also shown that the appearance of <b>surface</b> <b>instability</b> is associated with the vanishing velocity of propagation of Rayleigh waves. Furthermore, results derived {{in the context of the}} present theory on the dependence of the critical buckling stress of the layer on the thickness, suggest that it can be used effectively for the homogenization of elastic bodies containing periodic arrays of collinear Griffith cracks.

40|$|<b>Surface</b> <b>instabilities</b> {{include a}} variety of {{different}} modes such as wrinkles, folds, and creases. Such <b>surface</b> <b>instabilities</b> have been used in numerous contexts including changing the wetting, optical, and mechanical properties of different material surfaces for applications in flexible electronics, tissue engineering and biosensors. Interesting surface morphologies can arise due to differences in pre-strain, stiffness, and thickness between the film and substrate; however, the effects of these differences are not well understood. We have developed an experimental system, complemented by finite element simulations, to systematically vary the pre-stretch of the substrate, modulus contrast and thickness contrast to study the transitions of <b>surface</b> <b>instabilities</b> in compressed bi-layers as strain is increased. We find that for systems with large modulus contrast, but varying degrees of substrate pre-stretch, the pre-stretched substrates not only substantially shift the critical strain for post-wrinkling bifurcations, but also qualitatively change the post-wrinkling modes observed. Understanding that pre-stretching the substrate affects post-wrinkling behaviors, the remaining experiments were conducted with no substrate pre-stretch. Examining the effect of modulus contrast, we report that below a film to substrate elastic modulus ratio of approximately 2, the flat state transitions directly to the creased state. For slightly larger contrasts, wrinkling occurs first but there are two distinct types of post-wrinkling behaviors: (1) wrinkles that transition into creases without period-doubling; and (2) wrinkles to creases preceded by period doubling. Finally, considering the effect of thickness contrast between the film and substrate, we discover that the critical strain for post-wrinkling behavior increases as thickness contrast decreases leading to wrinkles with aspect ratios (defined as amplitude normalized by wavelength) as high as 0. 6. Further increases in aspect ratio can be achieved by increasing the modulus contrast, leading first to the formation of localized ridges, and then uniform, high aspect ratio wrinkles.

40|$|AbstractUpon {{swelling}} in a solvent, a thin hydrogel {{layer on a}} rigid substrate may become unstable, developing various surface patterns. Recent experimental studies have explored the possibilities to generate controllable surface patterns by chemically modifying the molecular structures of the hydrogel near the surface. In this paper, we present a theoretical stability analysis for swelling of hydrogel layers with material properties varying in the thickness direction. As a specialization of the general procedure, hydrogel bilayers with different combinations of the material properties are examined in details. For a soft-on-hard bilayer, the onset of <b>surface</b> <b>instability</b> {{is determined by the}} short-wave limit, similar to a homogeneous layer. In contrast, for a hard-on-soft bilayer, a long-wave mode with a finite wavelength emerges as the critical mode at the onset of <b>surface</b> <b>instability,</b> similar to wrinkling of an elastic thin film on a compliant substrate, and the critical swelling ratio is much lower than that for a homogeneous hydrogel layer. A smooth transition of the critical mode is predicted as the volume fraction of the top layer changes, linking <b>surface</b> <b>instability</b> of a homogeneous layer to thin film wrinkling as two limiting cases. The results from the present study suggest that both the critical condition and the instability mode depend sensitively on the variation of the material properties in the thickness direction of the hydrogel layer...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to construct a model for simulation and study of strained Heteroepitaxial growth and use the same to study {{the nature of the}} <b>surface</b> <b>instability</b> in the system. This is done with the intent of studying the intermixing and its effects, on the <b>surface</b> <b>instability</b> and the critical thickness of island formation. A solid on solid kinetic Monte Carlo approach is adopted in order to model the discrete stochastic effects. The model uses simple surface atom hops to capture surface diffusion effectively. The hopping rates are modeled based on the energetics of the system. The energetics of the system are in turn modeled by bond counting (surface energy) and a ball and spring network (elastic energy). An efficient numerical method for the elastic computations is constructed. This approach involves the local estimation of the change in elastic energies using the Expanding Box method and upon failure the global evaluation using the Multigrid Fourier method. An efficient algorithm for evolution of the system based on a reduced rejection kinetic Monte Carlo is presented. In this method the hopping rates are replaced by computationally inexpensive upper bounds with a rejection step to compensate for the overestimate. The continuum limit of this model is shown to be equivalent to a classical phenomenological continuum model. Using this relation the existence of the Asaro-Tiller-Grinfeld instability in the model is discussed. The limitations of the continuum theory and the need for the discrete stochastic approach is addressed. Finally the kinetic Monte Carlo model is used to study the role of intermixing in the <b>surface</b> <b>instability.</b> Significant intermixing of the film with the substrate due to kinetic roughening of the film and hence the dilution of the film, is observed. This dilution is found to have a stabilizing role in the <b>surface</b> <b>instability,</b> leading to a retarded onset of island formation.
