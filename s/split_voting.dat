40|$|In Mixed Member Proportional systems, {{voters are}} able to <b>split</b> their <b>vote.</b> To what extent do voters use this {{opportunity}}, which voters seem to use this opportunity most {{and what are the}} potential consequences of <b>split</b> ticket <b>voting?</b> These questions are answered by comparatively analyzing motives for <b>split</b> ticket <b>voting</b> and factors that facilitate such behavior and apply them to the Dutch situation. Moreover, we employ various simulations based on the last three parliamentary elections in order to assess the potential consequences of <b>split</b> ticket <b>voting</b> under different electoral system proposals. In general, these results indicate that <b>split</b> ticket <b>voting</b> will not have substantial effects on the distribution of seats in parliament. " (author's abstract...|$|R

40|$|High {{levels of}} <b>split</b> ticket <b>voting</b> in {{elections}} usually indicate either an instrumental electorate, or widespread disaffection {{from the major}} parties. Elections to the Russian lower house, the Duma, permit voters both party list options and single-member ballots; as a result, the 1993 and 1995 Duma elections recorded {{some of the highest}} levels of <b>split</b> ticket <b>voting</b> ever recorded. Using national survey data collected just after the 1995 Duma election, we test two major explanations for <b>split</b> ticket <b>voting,</b> one based on the activities of voters, the other on the strategic behaviour of parties. The results show that <b>split</b> ticket <b>voting</b> is caused by voters, and more specifically, by their weak attachments to parties. But party strategy also plays a modest role in promoting the phenomenon. In the absence of major reform of the Russian electoral system, <b>split</b> ticket <b>voting</b> is likely to remain at high levels...|$|R
