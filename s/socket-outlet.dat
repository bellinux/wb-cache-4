25|$|Generally {{the plug}} is the movable {{connector}} attached to an electrically operated device's mains cable, and the socket is fixed on equipment or a building structure {{and connected to}} an energised electrical circuit. The plug has protruding pins or, in US terminology, blades (referred to as male) that fit into matching slots or holes (called female) in the sockets. A plug is defined in IEC 60050 as an accessory having pins designed to engage with the contacts of a <b>socket-outlet,</b> also incorporating means for the electrical connection and mechanical retention of flexible cables or cords; a plug does not contain components which modify the electrical output from the electrical input (except where a switch and/or fuse is provided {{as a means of}} disconnecting the output from input). There is an erroneous tendency to refer to power conversion devices with incorporated plug pins as plugs, but IEC 60050 refers to these as 'direct plug-in equipment', defined as equipment in which the mains plug forms {{an integral part of the}} equipment enclosure so that the equipment is supported by the mains <b>socket-outlet.</b> In this article, the term 'plug' is used in the sense defined by IEC 60050. Sockets are designed to prevent exposure of bare energised contacts. Sockets may also have protruding exposed contacts, but these are used exclusively for grounding (earthing).|$|E

2500|$|The {{plug and}} <b>socket-outlet</b> system defined in BS1363 {{is a result}} of one of the report's recommendations. [...] Britain had {{previously}} used a combination of 2A, 5A and 15A round pin sockets. [...] In an appendix to the main report (July 1944), the committee proposed that a completely new <b>socket-outlet</b> and fused plug should be adopted as the [...] "all-purpose" [...] domestic standard. [...] The main report listed 8 points to consider in deciding the design of the new standard. The first of these was stated as “To ensure the safety of young children it is of considerable importance that the contacts of the <b>socket-outlet</b> should be protected by shutters or other like means, or by the inherent design of the socket-outlet.” [...] Others included flush fitting, no need for a switch, requirements for terminals, bottom entry for the cable, and contact design. [...] The appendix added 5 further [...] "points of technical detail" [...] including requirements that plugs could not be inserted incorrectly, should be easy to withdraw, and should include a fuse.|$|E

2500|$|The plug {{sides are}} shaped to improve grip {{and make it}} easier to remove the plug from a <b>socket-outlet.</b> [...] The plug is polarised, so that the fuse is in the [...] side of the supply. [...] The {{flexible}} cord always enters the plug from the bottom, discouraging removal by tugging on the cable, which can damage the cable. [...] Rewireable plugs must be designed {{so that they can be}} wired in a manner which prevents strain to the earth connection before the line and/or neutral connection in the event of failure of the cord anchorage.|$|E
2500|$|Plug {{adaptors}} permit {{two or more}} plugs {{to share}} one <b>socket-outlet,</b> or allow {{the use of a}} plug of different type. There are several common types, including double- and triple-socket blocks, shaver adaptors, and multi-socket strips. [...] Adaptors which allow the use of non-BS1363 plugs, or more than two BS1363 plugs, must be fused. Appliances are designed not to draw more power than their plug is rated for; the use of such adaptors, and also multi-socketed extension leads, makes it possible for several appliances to be connected through a single outlet, with the potential to cause dangerous overloads.|$|E

This method is sometimes used to allow a Europlug (with two small round pins and no earth pin) to be forced into the open [...] and neutral ports. The UK Electrical Safety Council has drawn attention to the fire risk associated with forcing Europlugs into BS1363 sockets.|$|E
