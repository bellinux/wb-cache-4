60|$|Just {{precisely}} {{what happened after}} {{that has been the}} most impossible thing to disinter. I have given all the things that Melville remembered were said, I have linked them into a conversation and checked them by my cousin's afterthoughts, and finally I have read the whole thing over to him. It is of course no verbatim rendering, but it is, he says, closely after the manner of their talk, the gist was that, and things of that sort were said. And when he left Chatteris, he fully believed that the final and conclusive thing was said. And then he says it came into his head that, apart from and outside this settlement, there still remained a tangible reality, capable of action, the Sea Lady. What was <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do?</b> The thought toppled him back into a web of perplexities again. It carried him back into a state of inconclusive interrogation past Lummidge's Hotel.|$|E
6000|$|He {{went off}} in the big car, she {{supposed}} to London, about ten and she helped her mother to pack and depart by a train a little after midday. She made a clumsy excuse for not giving that crisp little trifle of financial assistance she was accustomed to, and Mrs. Sawbridge was anxiously tactful about the disappointment. They paid a visit of inspection and farewell to the nursery before the departure. Then Lady Harman was left until lunch to resume her meditation upon this unprecedented breach that had opened between her husband and herself. She was presently moved to write a little note to Lady Beach-Mandarin expressing her intention of attending {{a meeting of the}} Social Friends and asking whether the date was the following Wednesday or Thursday. She found three penny stamps in the bureau at which she wrote and this served to remind her of her penniless condition. She spent some time thinking out the possible consequences of that.

Some of the meetings she had addressed had been quite full, various people had made various remarks about her, hostile for the most part and yet insidiously flattering, and everybody seemed quite glad to come to the little dinners she gave in order, she said, to gather social support for her reforms. She had been staying with the Mastersteins, who were keenly interested, and after she had polished off Lady Petchworth she was to visit Lady Rosenbaum. It was all going on swimmingly, these newer English gentry were eager to learn all she had to teach in the art of breaking in the Anglo-Saxon villagers, and now, how was Marjorie going on, and what was <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in the world? ...|$|E

His face is almost beautiful in its blaze of conflicting emotions. For some time he is as if unconscious {{in the midst of}} his feelings. Then anger and resentment crop out of his consternation. He turns with a flash to the long-nosed, insidious, Phoenician-looking guard. Why couldn't they stop the train for her! And immediately, as if someone had set fire to him, off flares the guard. Heh!--the train can't stop for every person's convenience! The train is a train--the time-table is a time-table. What did the old woman want to take her trips down the line for? Heh! She pays the penalty for her own inconsiderateness. Had she paid for the train--heh? And the fat man all the time firing off his unheeding and unheeded answers. One minute--only one minute--if he, the conductor had told the driver! if he, the conductor, had shouted! A poor woman! Not another train!

6000|$|Mr. Hoopdriver's mind came {{round to}} the future. What was <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do?</b> What were they {{both going to}} do? His {{thoughts}} took a graver colour. He had rescued her. This was fine, manly rescue work he was engaged upon. She ought to go home, {{in spite of that}} stepmother. He must insist gravely but firmly upon that. She was the spirited sort, of course, but still--Wonder if she had any money? Wonder what the second-class fare from Havant to London is? Of course he would have to pay that--it was the regular thing, he being a gentleman. Then should he take her home? He began to rough in a moving sketch of the return. The stepmother, repentant of her indescribable cruelties, would be present,--even these rich people have their troubles,--probably an uncle or two. The footman would announce, Mr.--(bother that name!) and Miss Milton. Then two women weeping together, and a knightly figure in the background dressed in a handsome Norfolk jacket, still conspicuously new. He would conceal his feeling until the very end. Then, leaving, he would pause in the doorway in such an attitude as Mr. George Alexander might assume, and say, slowly and dwindlingly: [...] "Be kind to her--BE kind to her," [...] and so depart, heartbroken to the meanest intelligence. But that was a matter for the future. He would have to begin discussing the return soon. There was no traffic along the road, and he came up beside her (he had fallen behind in his musing). She began to talk. [...] "Mr. Denison," [...] she began, and then, doubtfully, [...] "That is your name? I'm very stupid--" ...|$|E
6000|$|These {{were nice}} questions, but Isabel's arrival {{put a stop}} to his puzzling over them. It even {{suggested}} there might be a compensation for the intolerable ennui of surviving his genial sire. He wondered whether he were harbouring [...] "love" [...] for this spontaneous young woman from Albany; but he judged that on the whole he was not. After he had known her for a week he quite made up his mind to this, and every day he felt a little more sure. Lord Warburton had been right about her; she was a really interesting little figure. Ralph wondered how their neighbour had found it out so soon; and then he said it was only another proof of his friend's high abilities, which he had always greatly admired. If his cousin were to be nothing more than an entertainment to him, Ralph was conscious she was an entertainment of a high order. [...] "A character like that," [...] he said to himself--"a real little passionate force to see at play is the finest thing in nature. It's finer than the finest work of art--than a Greek bas-relief, than a great Titian, than a Gothic cathedral. It's very pleasant to be so well treated where one had least looked for it. I had never been more blue, more bored, than for a week before she came; I had never expected less that anything pleasant would happen. Suddenly I receive a Titian, by the post, to hang on my wall--a Greek bas-relief to stick over my chimney-piece. The key of a beautiful edifice is thrust into my hand, and I'm told to walk in and admire. My poor boy, you've been sadly ungrateful, and now you had better keep very quiet and never grumble again." [...] The sentiment of these reflexions was very just; but it was not exactly true that Ralph Touchett had had a key put into his hand. His cousin was a very brilliant girl, who would take, as he said, a good deal of knowing; but she needed the knowing, and his attitude with regard to her, though it was contemplative and critical, was not judicial. He surveyed the edifice from the outside and admired it greatly; he looked in at the windows and received an impression of proportions equally fair. But he felt that he saw it only by glimpses and that he had not yet stood under the roof. The door was fastened, and though he had keys in his pocket he had a conviction that none of them would fit. She was intelligent and generous; it was a fine free nature; but what was <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with herself? This question was irregular, for with most women one had no occasion to ask it. Most women did with themselves nothing at all; they waited, in attitudes more or less gracefully passive, for a man to come that way and furnish them with a destiny. Isabel's originality was that she gave one an impression of having intentions of her own. [...] "Whenever she executes them," [...] said Ralph, [...] "may I be there to see!" ...|$|E

6000|$|Poor Alvina, {{this was}} the only day in all her life when she was the centre of public attention. For once, every eye was upon her, every mind was {{thinking}} about her. Poor Alvina! said every member of the Woodhouse [...] "middle class": Poor Alvina Houghton, said every collier's wife. Poor thing, left alone--and hardly a penny to bless herself with. Lucky if she's not left with a pile of debts. James Houghton ran through some money in his day. Ay, if she had her rights she'd be a rich woman. Why, her mother brought three or four thousands with her. Ay, but James sank it all in Throttle-Ha'penny and Klondyke and the Endeavour. Well, he was his own worst enemy. He paid his way. I'm not so sure about that. Look how he served his wife, and now Alvina. I'm not so sure he was his own worst enemy. He was bad enough enemy to his own flesh and blood. Ah well, he'll spend no more money, anyhow. No, he went sudden, didn't he? But he was getting very frail, if you noticed. Oh yes, why he fair seemed to totter down to Lumley. Do you reckon as that place pays its way? What, the Endeavour?--they say it does. They say it makes a nice bit. Well, it's mostly pretty full. Ay, it is. Perhaps it won't be now Mr. Houghton's gone. Perhaps not. I wonder if he will leave much. I'm sure he won't. Everything he's got's mortgaged up to the hilt. He'll leave debts, you see if he doesn't. What is <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> then? She'll have to go out of Manchester House--her and Miss Pinnegar. Wonder what she'll do. Perhaps she'll take up that nursing. She never made much of that, did she--and spent a sight of money on her training, they say. She's a bit like her father in the business line--all flukes. Pity some nice young man doesn't turn up and marry her. I don't know, she doesn't seem to hook on, does she? Why she's never had a proper boy. They make out she was engaged once. Ay, but nobody ever saw him, and it was off {{as soon as it was}} on. Can you remember she went with Albert Witham for a bit. Did she? No, I never knew. When was that? Why, when he was at Oxford, you know, learning for his head master's place. Why didn't she marry him then? Perhaps he never asked her. Ay, there's that to it. She'd have looked down her nose at him, times gone by. Ay, but that's all over, my boy. She'd snap at anybody now. Look how she carries on with that manager. Why, that's something awful. Haven't you ever watched her in the Cinema? She never lets him alone. And it's anybody alike. Oh, she doesn't respect herself. I don't consider. No girl who respected herself would go on as she does, throwing herself at every feller's head. Does she, though? Ay, any performer or anybody. She's a tidy age, though. She's not much chance of getting off. How old do you reckon she is? Must be well over thirty. You never say. Well, she looks it. She does beguy--a dragged old maid. Oh but she sprightles up a bit sometimes. Ay, when she thinks she's hooked on to somebody. I wonder why she never did take? It's funny. Oh, she was too high and mighty before, and now it's too late. Nobody wants her. And she's got no relations to go to either, has she? No, that's her father's cousin who she's walking with. Look, they're coming. He's a fine-looking man, isn't he? You'd have thought they'd have buried Miss Frost beside Mrs. Houghton. You would, wouldn't you? I should think Alvina will lie by Miss Frost. They say the grave was made for both of them. Ay, she was a lot more of a mother to her than her own mother. She was good to them, Miss Frost was. Alvina thought the world of her. That's her stone--look, down there. Not a very grand one, considering. No, it isn't. Look, there's room for Alvina's name underneath. Sh!-- ...|$|E

5000|$|In November 2012, The Sun {{newspaper}} reported that romance will blossom {{for the old}} flames as Fiz continues to support Tyrone Dobbs (Alan Halsall) through his domestic violence ordeal with girlfriend Kirsty Soames (Natalie Gumede). It was reported that Kirsty would deliberately cause injury to Fiz's hand, according to the Daily Star, Fiz would attempt to fix her machine at the factory when it breaks only to get her hand trapped when Kirsty switches the power back on. Fiz apparently needs emergency medical attention due to the bloody injury and soon starts spreading the word that Kirsty harmed her on purpose. She is quoted as telling Tyrone: [...] "Kirsty said she didn't do it and you might believe her, but in your head I don't think you do. What's <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> next? She injured you and now she's injured me. Who's going to be next, Ruby?" [...] McAlpine spoke about the storyline and told What's On TV: [...] "Kirsty continues to look after Fiz and stays with her while she is treated {{at the hospital and}} even returns home with her. She is quite sinister and when she finally leaves, Fiz is quite shaken by Kirsty's behaviour. Fiz has now seen how scary Kirsty can be with her own eyes. Fiz is not soft, she has spent time in prison before, but she has now seen what Tyrone has to cope with when Kirsty gets angry." [...] She added: [...] "Fiz really cares about Tyrone. Fiz is also very stubborn and has a sense of justice. She will probably want to see this through to the end - she wants the truth to come out. She wants Tyrone to be happy and feels this can never be the case while he is still involved with Kirsty." ...|$|E
40|$|In "Education and the Human Quest" Thelen {{describes}} classroom {{settings that}} {{took place at the}} University of Chicago Laboratory School in the "Sophomore Project" in 1957 - 1958 (in Blaine 400, remodeled specifically for this purpose). Thelen and his group of followers used to sit in a glass enclosed gallery, on high, and study us as subjects going about our learning in subgroups in this open-area classroom. There were microphones attached to long poles that were lowered into the subgroups of desks with hinged wings, so that the professor and his students might listen to what we were saying. Later in the year, a small group of us were freed from the normal pressures of the group and permitted to study what we wished. I chose to continue a study of symbolic (mathematical) logic and picked up on the content I had learned in the previous year from Michael Houghton Millar, in his experimental mathematics classroom (based to some extent on the "Moore" method). The mathematics leader of this small group of selected students was John Paul Moulton, our mathematics teacher in the Sophomore Project. In Thelen's book about the Project, I am "Jane. " The work I did with Millar and Moulton {{was one of the best}} educational experiences I have had (and I have had a great many fine ones, through the level of Ph. D. [...] married name "Arlinghaus"). Quotation from page 93 of Thelen, Herbert A. Education and the Human Quest, Four Designs for Education, 1960 and 1972, University of Chicago Press: "Jane, Roger, and John, the other three in the seminar, are probably the kinds of students that teachers retrospectively would call "gifted" [...] if we forget that by all the screens so far used to identify "gifted" children, Penny, Paul, and Mimi are equally "gifted. " Jane, Roger and John simply blossomed in the seminar. They were eager, enthusiastic, happy. They worked hard and loved every minute of it. Penny, Paul, and Mimi show us some of the kinds of problems we will encounter with this notion of personal inquiry; Jane, Roger and John show us that the game is very much worth the candle. Jane started, as already noted, by cleaning up a month of math over one weekend. The topic she chose to work on was not posed as a specific question; she wanted to find out all about symbolic logic. This had been mentioned by her math teacher last year and she had been curious about it ever since. Her present math teacher, somewhat startled, suggested some references, and she was off. She reported twice to the seminar, and the social studies teacher felt no shame in admitting that she lost him halfway through the first talk. The paper she wrote is cherished by the math teacher. Having had her fill of constructing "truth tables," Jane next turned to the rewriting and expansion of her 120 -page manuscript on the history of the English language. She read a variety of books and rounded out and polished her discussion. What was <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with this manuscript? Nothing [...] she just wanted to write it. ...|$|E
