40|$|ABSTRACT: Threaded nails {{are used}} in wood {{construction}} because of their superior performance, but relatively few tests have been conducted on nails larger than 12 d (3. 76 mm diameter). Experience has suggested that threaded nail withdrawal design values are too conservative. The Forest Products Laboratory and Washington State University have been cooperatively characterizing the strength of threaded nails over a range of wood species and nail types. This paper focuses on the immediate withdrawal strength of annularly threaded nails in Douglas Fir and Spruce-Pine-Fir, helically threaded nails in Southern Pine, and smooth nails in Southern Pine and Spruce-Pine-Fir lumber. Average withdrawal strength of threaded nails was {{greater than that of}} <b>smooth</b> <b>shank</b> nails of the same diameter. In comparison of experimental withdrawal strength to existing design proce-dures for assigning allowable withdrawal strength design values, annular shank nails showed the greatest dif-ference. Withdrawal strengths of nails from five different manufacturers were not significantly different. Com-parisons of the effect of galvanizing on withdrawal strength were inconclusive...|$|E

However, they use a piston {{mechanism}} instead of a special clutch. This causes them to deliver a much more powerful hammer blow, {{making it possible to}} drill bigger holes much faster. Rotary hammers have such force, in fact, that the usual masonry bits are no longer adequate. Their <b>smooth</b> <b>shanks</b> would be pounded loose from the tool's chuck in a few seconds. Rotary hammers require special bits which lock into the rotary hammer and continue spinning while smashing away.|$|R
