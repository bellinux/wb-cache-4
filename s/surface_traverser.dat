40|$|Future {{planetary}} explorations {{will require}} <b>surface</b> <b>traverses</b> of unprecedented frequency, length, and duration. As a result, there is need for exploration support tools to maximize productivity, scientific return, and safety. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology is currently developing such a system, called the <b>Surface</b> Exploration <b>Traverse</b> Analysis and Navigation Tool (SEXTANT). The {{goal of this}} system is twofold: to allow for realistic simulations of traverses in order to assist with hardware design, and to give astronauts an aid that will allow for more autonomy in traverse planning and re-planning. SEXTANT is a MATLAB-based tool that incorporates a lunar elevation model created from data from the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter instrument aboard the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft. To assist in traverse planning, SEXTANT determines the most efficient path across a planetary surface for astronauts or transportation rovers between user-specified Activity Points. The path efficiency is derived from any number of metrics: the traverse distance, traverse time, or the explorerâ€™s energy consumption. The generated path, display of traverse obstacles, and selection of Activity Points are visualized in a 3 D mapping interface. After a traverse has been planned, SEXTANT is capable of computing the mos...|$|R

40|$|Automated terrain {{classification}} {{for electric}} powered wheelchairs (EPWs) has two primary motivations. First, certain terrains (e. g., sand and gravel) make wheelchair mobility more difficult. To alleviate this problem the wheelchair control {{system can be}} manually tuned for maximum speeds and/or accelerations to help adapt to various terrains. Terrain classification can then be used to automate the switch from one control mode to another. Second, terrain classification can help yield {{a better understanding of}} the <b>surfaces</b> <b>traversed</b> by various groups of wheelchair users. This can provide the data needed to develop wheelchairs geared to specific groups of users. This paper presents an algorithm for vibration-based terrain classification on EPWs.

40|$|Shaping of the <b>surface</b> {{roughness}} in <b>traverse</b> grinding is {{much more}} complex compared to plunge grinding. What significantly influences the roughness of the machined <b>surfaces</b> in <b>traverse</b> grinding is the dressing of the grinding wheel, grinding parameters, and {{the form of the}} grinding wheel wear in this proc-ess. The occurrence of wear steps on the active grinding wheel surface (AGWS) causes that the set-up depth of cut is split into the wheelâ€™s different steps, which in turn is a reason of a varying roughness shaped by those steps. The surface-roughness model presented, which includes parameters of the grinding wheel dressing with the single point diamond dresser and grinding parameters, allows us to estimate the size of surface roughness in the process of traverse grinding...|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} simple and {{efficient}} chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process that can grow oriented and long single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) using a cobalt ultrathin film (1 nm) as the catalyst and ethanol as carbon feedstock. In the process, millimeter- to centimeter-long, oriented and high-quality SWNTs can grow horizontally on various flat substrate <b>surfaces,</b> <b>traverse</b> slits as large as hundreds of micrometers wide, or grow over vertical barriers as high as 20 Ã­m. Such observations demonstrate that the carbon nanotubes are suspended in the gas flow during the growth. The trace amount of self-contained water (0. 2 - 5 wt %) in ethanol may act as a mild oxidizer to clean the nanotubes and to elongate the lifetime of the catalysts, but no yield improvement was observed at the CVD temperature of 850 Â°C. We found that tilting the substrates supporting the Co ultrathin film catalysts can grow more, longer carbon nanotubes. A mechanism is discussed {{for the growth of}} long SWNTs...|$|R

40|$|The pairing {{symmetry}} in {{the electron}} mechanism for superconductivity is explored when charge fluctuations coexist with spin fluctuations. The extended Hubbard model is adopted to obtain, with the fluctuation exchange approximation, a phase diagram against the on-site Coulomb repulsion U and the off-site repulsion V for the square lattice with second-neighbor hopping t'. We {{have found that}} (i) for large U(> 9) a triplet superconductivity with a sin(kx+ky) symmetry can appear just below the charge density wave phase. The pairing is degenerate with sin(kx-ky), so a chiral sin(kx+ky) +isin(kx-ky) that breaks the time reversal symmetry should result, which {{is a candidate for}} the gap function on the gamma band of Sr 2 RuO 4 and is consistent with a recent measurement of the specific heat.

40|$|The {{hypothetical}} {{possibility of}} primary carbonate {{content in the}} host rock was tested by a detailed petrological study of material collected from <b>surface</b> <b>traverses</b> of part of the Magaliesberg-Quartzites in the Rooiberg area. Fur-thermore, most valuable data were obtained from surface borehole A/A, situated near the A 3 incline shaft, which early in 1961 had reached a depth of 1, 000 feet. Evidence from {{a considerable number of}} thin sections and from 20 chemical analyses of quartzites from the borehole A/A is discussed below. The country rocks are in no case pure quartz rocks and do not, in fact, fit the definition usually used for quartzites in sedimentary petrology. Feld-spar makes up about 50 percent of the rock and is evidently a primary detrital constituent. According to Pettijohn's terminology (27, p. 51), the majority of grains is subrounded, a smaller fraction is rounded. Comparatively dense packing and some recrystallization (especially of quartz), however, have taken place. Thus, the subrounded character of the grains does not contradict the fact that interstitial matrix makes up {{only a small part of}} the bul...|$|R
40|$|S Supporting Information ABSTRACT: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effect of PEGylation on the interaction of poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimer nanocarriers (DNCs) with in vitro and in vivo models of the pulmonary epithelium. Generation- 3 PAMAM dendrimers with varying surface densities of PEG 1000 Da were synthesized and characterized. The results revealed that the apical to basolateral transport of DNCs across polarized Calu- 3 monolayers increases with an increase in PEG surface density. DNC having the greatest number of PEG groups (n = 25) on their <b>surface</b> <b>traversed</b> at a rate 10 -fold greater than its non-PEGylated counterpart, in spite of their larger size. This behavior was attributed to a significant reduction in charge density upon PEGylation. We also observed that PEGylation can be used to modulate cellular internalization. The total uptake of PEG-free DNC into polarized Calu- 3 monolayers was 12 % (w/w) vs 2 % (w/w) for that with 25 PEGs. Polarization is also shown to be of great relevance in studying this in vitro model of the lung epithelium. The rate of absorption o...|$|R

40|$|We use the hexagon {{function}} bootstrap {{to compute}} the ratio function which characterizes the next-to-maximally-helicity-violating (NMHV) six-point amplitude in planar N = 4 super-Yang-Mills theory at four loops. A powerful constraint comes from dual superconformal invariance, {{in the form of}} a QÌ… differential equation, which heavily constrains the first derivatives of the transcendental functions entering the ratio function. At four loops, it leaves only a 34 -parameter space of functions. Constraints from the collinear limits, and from the multi-Regge limit at the leading-logarithmic (LL) and next-to-leading-logarithmic (NLL) order, suffice to fix these parameters and obtain a unique result. We test the result against multi-Regge predictions at NNLL and N^ 3 LL, and against predictions from the operator product expansion involving one and two flux-tube excitations; all cross-checks are satisfied. We study the analytical and numerical behavior of the parity-even and parity-odd parts on various lines and <b>surfaces</b> <b>traversing</b> the three-dimensional space of cross ratios. As part of this program, we characterize all irreducible hexagon functions through weight eight in terms of their coproduct.
