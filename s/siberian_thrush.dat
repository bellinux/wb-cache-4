50|$|The <b>Siberian</b> <b>thrush</b> {{is similar}} in size to the song thrush. It is omnivorous, eating {{a wide range of}} insects, {{earthworms}} and berries.|$|E
50|$|The bill {{is not as}} {{strongly}} curved {{as that of the}} dark-sided thrush or the long-billed thrush and the female lacks the prominent pale cheek spot of the similar looking female <b>Siberian</b> <b>thrush.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Siberian</b> <b>thrush</b> (Geokichla sibirica) is {{a member}} of the thrush family, Turdidae. The genus name Geokichla comes from Ancient Greek geo-, [...] "ground-" [...] and kikhle, [...] " [...] thrush". The {{specific}} sibirica is Latin for Siberia.|$|E
50|$|The male <b>Siberian</b> <b>thrush</b> {{is a dark}} blue-grey {{above and}} below, with a white stripe above the eye. The lower belly and flanks are white. The female is a much browner bird, with a buff stripe above the eye.|$|E
50|$|Two New World species {{traditionally}} {{regarded as}} Zoothera; (varied thrush and Aztec thrush) actually belong {{elsewhere in the}} thrush family. A group containing <b>Siberian</b> <b>thrush</b> and the African species is not {{closely related to the}} other Zoothera and are now assigned to the genus Geokichla.|$|E
50|$|The {{species was}} placed in the genus Zoothera along with many other thrushes but {{molecular}} phylogenetic studies in 2008 showed support for their separation and placement in a different genus leading to an older genus Geokichla being resurrected. The pied thrush's closest relative is the <b>Siberian</b> <b>thrush</b> Geokichla sibirica.|$|E
50|$|Mammals include Asian black bear, small Japanese mole, bats, mice, deer, fox, boar, wild rabbit, Japanese mink and squirrel. Birds include great tit, willow tit, long-tailed tit, magerahigara, higera, great spotted woodpecker, pygmy woodpecker, bush warbler, Eurasian jay, Japanese white-eye, Japanese thrush, brown-headed thrush, <b>Siberian</b> <b>thrush,</b> Hodgsonâ€™s hawk-cuckoo, Japanese grosbeak, lesser cuckoo, black-faced bunting, oriental turtle dove, {{and common}} cuckoo.|$|E
50|$|The sexes are similar, 27-31 cm long, {{with black}} scaling on a paler white or {{yellowish}} background. The most striking identification feature in flight {{is the black}} band on the white underwings, a feature shared with <b>Siberian</b> <b>thrush.</b> The male has a song which is a loud, far-carrying mechanical whistle, with 5-10 second pauses between each one second long phrase twee...tuuu....tuuu....tuuu.|$|E
50|$|Resident {{bird species}} include hazel grouse, black woodpecker, great spotted woodpecker, white-backed woodpecker, goldcrest, Eurasian treecreeper, and spotted nutcracker. Summer {{visitors}} to the Hidaka Mountains include Japanese accentor, Siberian blue robin, Japanese robin, red-flanked bluetail, <b>Siberian</b> <b>thrush,</b> Eastern crowned warbler, narcissus flycatcher, blue-and-white flycatcher, dark-sided flycatcher, grey bunting, and Eurasian bullfinch. Notable bird species that transit the Hidaka mountains are Arctic warbler and eyebrowed thrush.|$|E
50|$|Many {{rare species}} of bird {{have been found}} on the island, and it is {{probably}} the best place in western Europe to see skulking Siberian passerines such as Pechora pipit, lanceolated warbler and Pallas's grasshopper warbler. In spring 2008 a calandra lark was identified in April, and in May a Caspian plover was observed, only the fourth such record for the UK. On 6 June a citril finch was found and identified by islander Tommy Hyndman, a first record for Britain. September was highlighted by brown flycatcher, red-flanked bluetail and <b>Siberian</b> <b>thrush.</b>|$|E
50|$|More than 300 {{species of}} birds have their nesting grounds in the taiga. <b>Siberian</b> <b>thrush,</b> white-throated sparrow, and black-throated green warbler migrate to this habitat to take {{advantage}} of the long summer days and abundance of insects found around the numerous bogs and lakes. Of the 300 {{species of birds}} that summer in the taiga only 30 stay for the winter. These are either carrion-feeding or large raptors that can take live mammal prey, including golden eagle, rough-legged buzzard (also known as the rough-legged hawk), and raven, or else seed-eating birds, including several species of grouse and crossbills.|$|E
50|$|This large, heavily {{patterned}} thrush {{is similar}} in appearance to the scaly thrush, {{to which it is}} usually considered a subspecies. It has warm olive-brown to buff upperparts and whitish underparts with heavy black scaling. It has twelve tail feathers. The scaly thrush is smaller and has fourteen tail feathers. It has a cheerful song similar to the <b>Siberian</b> <b>thrush.</b> Among thrushes, only the blue whistling thrush typically attains a larger size. The Amami thrush ranges in length from 29 to 31 cm and weighs approximately 172 g. Among standard measurements, the wing chord is 16.4 to 17.3 cm, the bill is 3.1 to 3.3 cm and the tarsus is 4.1 to 4.5 cm.|$|E
