So by initializing of coating separation is from the surface of tube and the other metal workforces, from the location of weld line and the edge of the other regions. Nowadays, experts of corrosion science and coating industries are trying to solve this problem by <b>stripe</b> <b>coating.</b> In this essay physical and mechanical properties of coating and tube surface as adherence on steel, traction strength, permeability, resistance on strike and etc is measured and compared for presence and absence of <b>stripe</b> <b>coating</b> according to valid standards. In addition, it being paid to scrutinize of his kind of coating, usage causes, how to apply and an offer in order to perform it in an oil and gas industries...|$|E

50|$|Brindle {{coloring}} in horses {{is extremely}} rare {{and in many}} cases is linked to spontaneous chimerism, resulting in an animal with two sets of DNA, with the brindle pattern being an expression of two different sets of equine coat color genes in one horse. This form is not heritable. In some horses the pattern seems to be inherited, indicating that one or more genes are responsible. One heritable brindle pattern in a family of American Quarter Horses was identified in 2016 and named Brindle1 (BR1). The Brindle1 phenotype has an X-linked, semidominant mode of inheritance. Female horses with this gene have a <b>striped</b> <b>coat</b> pattern, plus hairs from the stripes have a different texture as well as color, less straight and unrulier. Male horses have sparse manes and tails but do not show a <b>striped</b> <b>coat</b> texture pattern. A Brindle1 test is available.|$|R

60|$|The same {{conclusion}} may perhaps {{be extended to}} the tiger, {{one of the most}} beautiful animals in the world, the sexes of which cannot be distinguished by colour, even by the dealers in wild beasts. Mr. Wallace believes[369] that the <b>striped</b> <b>coat</b> of the tiger “so assimilates with the vertical stems of the bamboo, as to assist greatly in concealing him from his approaching prey.” But this view does not appear to me satisfactory. We have some slight evidence that his beauty may be due to sexual selection, for in two species of Felis analogous marks and colours are rather brighter in the male than in the female. The zebra is conspicuously striped, and stripes on the open plains of South Africa cannot afford any protection. Burchell[370] in describing a herd says, “their sleek ribs glistened in the sun, and the brightness and regularity of their <b>striped</b> <b>coats</b> presented a picture of extraordinary beauty, in which probably they are not surpassed by any other quadruped.” Here we have no evidence of sexual selection, as throughout the whole group of the Equidæ the sexes are identical in colour. Nevertheless he who attributes the white and dark vertical stripes on the flanks of various antelopes to sexual selection, will probably extend the same view to the Royal Tiger and beautiful Zebra.|$|R

40|$|The {{characteristic}} striped {{appearance of}} zebras has provoked much speculation about its function {{and why the}} pattern has evolved, but experimental evidence is scarce. Here, we demonstrate that a zebra-striped horse model attracts far fewer horseflies (tabanids) than either homogeneous black, brown, grey or white equivalents. Such biting flies are prevalent across Africa and have considerable fitness impact on potential mammalian hosts. Besides brightness, one of the likely mechanisms underlying this protection is the polarization of reflected light from the host animal. We show that the attractiveness of striped patterns to tabanids is also reduced if only polarization modulations (parallel stripes with alternating orthogonal directions of polarization) occur in horizontal or vertical homogeneous grey surfaces. Tabanids {{have been shown to}} respond strongly to linearly polarized light, and we demonstrate here that the light and dark stripes of a zebra's coat reflect very different polarizations of light in a way that disrupts the attractiveness to tabanids. We show that the attractiveness to tabanids decreases with decreasing stripe width, and that stripes below a certain size are effective in not attracting tabanids. Further, we demonstrate that the stripe widths of zebra coats fall in a range where the striped pattern is most disruptive to tabanids. The <b>striped</b> <b>coat</b> patterns of several other large mammals may also function in reducing exposure to tabanids by similar mechanisms of differential brightness and polarization of reflected light. This work provides an experimentally supported explanation for the underlying mechanism leading to the selective advantage of a black-and-white <b>striped</b> <b>coat</b> pattern...|$|R
