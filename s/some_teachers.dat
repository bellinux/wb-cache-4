5|$|Hoosiers {{were divided}} about {{entering}} World War I. Before Germany resumed unrestricted submarine warfare {{and tried to}} enlist Mexico as a military ally in 1917, most Hoosiers wanted the U.S. to be neutral in the war. Support for Britain came from professions and businessmen. Opposition came from churchmen, women, farmers and Irish Catholics and German-American elements. They called for neutrality and strongly opposed going to war to rescue the British Empire. Influential Hoosiers who opposed involvement in the war included Democratic Senator John W. Kern, and Vice President Thomas R. Marshall. Supporters of military preparedness included James Whitcomb Riley and George Ade. Most of the opposition dissipated when the United States officially declared war against Germany in April 1917, but <b>some</b> <b>teachers</b> lost their jobs on suspicion of disloyalty, and public schools could no longer teach in German. Socialist leader Eugene V. Debs, from Terre Haute, went to federal prison for encouraging young men to evade the draft.|$|E
5|$|Most {{teachers}} {{are required to}} address HIV/AIDS in their curricula; although instructors are, for the most part, committed to helping their students understand and avoid the disease, they face many obstacles that prevent them from informing their students about HIV/AIDS in productive ways. For example, <b>some</b> <b>teachers</b> cannot advise their students to remain faithful to their sexual partners without seeming hypocritical because they engage in extramarital sexual relations themselves. Others feel uncomfortable discussing sexual matters with their students, and some believe that, due to their limited training, they are not knowledgeable enough about HIV/AIDS to direct classroom discussions about the disease. In addition, many teachers feel unsupported by community members, who often either deny {{the extent of the}} epidemic or believe that HIV/AIDS should not be addressed in the classroom.|$|E

5|$|Kata is a {{term used}} to {{describe}} the posture and movement associated with taiko performance. The term is used in martial arts in a similar way: for example, both traditions include the idea that the hara is the center of being. Author Sean Bender argues that kata is the primary feature that distinguishes different taiko groups from one another, and is a key factor in judging the quality of performance. For this reason, many practice rooms intended for taiko contain mirrors to provide visual feedback to players. An important part of kata in taiko is keeping the body stabilized while performing, and can be accomplished by keeping a wide, low stance with the legs, with the left knee bent over the toes and keeping the right leg straight. It is important that the hips face the drum and the shoulders are relaxed. <b>Some</b> <b>teachers</b> note a tendency to rely on the upper body while playing, and emphasize the importance of the holistic use of the body during performance.|$|E
