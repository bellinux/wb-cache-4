50|$|A century later, {{in autumn}} 1911, the canals again {{suffered}} a water shortage so the Oxford Canal brought its well at Napton back into use. The old pumping engine {{had long been}} out of action so the company hired two Oxford <b>Steam</b> <b>Plough</b> Company <b>steam</b> <b>ploughing</b> engines to work the pump. In 1974 there was another water shortage and British Waterways resorted to back-pumping water up Napton Locks.|$|R

50|$|Rickett was {{manager of}} the Castle Foundry in Buckingham, makers of {{agricultural}} implements, who in 1857 also started to make steam engines. In 1858 he combined the two to make a <b>steam</b> <b>plough.</b> The plough cost ₤500 and was manned by three men.|$|R
25|$|A {{monument}} to John Fowler's {{invention of the}} <b>steam</b> <b>plough</b> was placed on his father-in-law's Pierremont estate in 1856, but was moved in 1870 to South Park, Darlington. The plinth may still be seen there, but the plough that it supported disappeared in 1970.|$|R
50|$|He was apprenticed in 1852 at {{the works}} of Robert Stephenson and Co, Newcastle upon Tyne. He was manager of the <b>Steam</b> <b>Plough</b> Works of John Fowler and Co in Leeds, where he invented a means of {{signalling}} by lamps to facilitate steam-ploughing at night.|$|R
5000|$|Among other foreshadowings {{of things}} that were to be, was a <b>steam</b> <b>plough,</b> and this {{attracted}} the attention of Mr. John C.

50|$|In {{the days}} when <b>steam</b> <b>ploughing</b> was common, the engine would often remain on the {{headland}} and pull the plough across the field by a wire rope.

There would usually be two engines, one on each headland, and they would winch the plough to and fro between them.|$|R

40|$|The {{nineteenth century}} saw an {{explosion}} in creativity and innovation, often applied to and motivated by an urge to improve, refine and make more efficient industrial and agricultural processes. There were many innovations {{in the field of}} agriculture, supported by the sponsorship of societies and associations and, in the 1850 s and 1860 s, by strong investment under High Farming. This article examines one of these innovations, the <b>steam</b> <b>plough,</b> with reference to its application in the Scottish Highlands in the 1870 s and 1880 s. In particular, it illuminates the social networks which lay behind the development and utilisation of the <b>steam</b> <b>plough</b> in the rural Highland context, delineating how aristocratic, religious and local networks combined to {{have a major impact on}} rural society in Scotland and beyond. It will examine how these networks interacted to promote the contemporary culture for agricultural and rural innovation through the development of the Fowler’s <b>steam</b> <b>plough.</b> What makes this example of particular interest is the fact that agriculturally and financially, the Sutherland land reclamations were an unconditional failure. The environment was too challenging for the technology and despite vast financial resources, the landowner, the third Duke of Sutherland, was, after fifteen years, finally convinced by his advisors that further efforts were futile and irresponsible. This article will interrogate why, despite its essential unfeasibility, the project was pursued, and will argue that the momentum created by the dynamic between the three networks involved propelled it forward despite growing evidence of failure. This article therefore uses an inductive approach by examining a particular example of agricultural design innovation and analysing the pertinent social issues in what would have been termed by contemporaries ‘entrepreneurial spirit’...|$|R
50|$|In 1868 the Eddison and Nodding Company factory {{was founded}} in Cowley. John Allen bought it in 1897 and renamed it the Oxford <b>Steam</b> <b>Plough</b> Company. He later renamed it again as John Allen and Sons, and diversified into {{manufacturing}} other agricultural and horticultural machinery including the successful Allen Scythe powered by a small Villiers petrol engine. The works closed in the early 1980s, and the John Allen Centre retail park has since been built on the site.|$|R
50|$|Fisken also {{invented a}} potato-sowing machine, a safety steam boiler, a propeller, an {{apparatus}} for heating churches, which worked excellently, and the 'steam tackle' which, patented in July 1855, helped {{to render the}} <b>steam</b> <b>plough</b> of practical use. This system of haulage, which obtained second prize at the royal show at Wolverhampton, has undergone great modifications since its early appearance in Scotland in 1852, its exhibition at Carlisle in 1855, and at the show of the Royal Agricultural Society in 1863.|$|R
50|$|In the museum's outdoor spaces, {{there are}} more than 40 {{different}} models of trains. An 1895 model of the Fowler <b>steam</b> <b>ploughing</b> engine made by John Fowler for agricultural purposes and 1860s Double Decker coaches are some of the recognizable coaches displayed in the museum. The models also include Coaches of Inspection car RA 30 made by Metropolitan Carriage and Finance Co. Ltd., Crane Hercules (used for emergency relief) and luxury trains coaches. Almost all coaches in the museum are accessible to visitors.|$|R
50|$|<b>Steam</b> <b>ploughing</b> in 1884 {{revealed}} {{remains of}} a Roman villa built of clunch in a field just west of Woolstone village.

The villa was excavated again in 1955. No permanent marker of the site was left after either excavation, but a geophysical survey tentatively identified {{what may be the}} site in 2007.|$|R
5000|$|With {{help from}} his {{father-in-law}} he was able in either 1850 or 1851 to buy a small millwrighting business at Edward's Yard, Rochester. [...] The business produced and repaired agricultural machinery. Aveling had been concerned by {{the slow pace of}} agricultural labour arising from the [...] "ancient and defective construction" [...] of the machines. [...] Starting from 1852 he concentrated on experiments in steam cultivation, culminating in the first <b>steam</b> <b>plough</b> in 1856. So successful was the plough that some Kent farmers presented him with an award of 300 guineas in 1858.|$|R
5000|$|His 1860 {{catalogue}} describes {{him as an}} [...] "Iron Founder and Agricultural Engineer". He was {{the sole}} agent in Kent for Fowler's <b>Steam</b> <b>Plough,</b> for Burgess & Key's Patent Reaping Machines. He was an agent (though not apparently sole agent) for Claytons. The front page offers [...] "Every description of Agricultural Machinery supplied at Manufacturer's Prices" [...] and ends with [...] "Castings to order", [...] "Machinery and Steam Engines repaired". Inside was [...] "Aveling's Patent Locomotive Steam Thrashing Train" [...] with engine, threshing machine and straw carrier. Not withstanding his claims as an iron founder, this was made for him by Claytons.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the early}} 1830s Handley was {{a proponent of}} steam power; both in {{relation}} to agriculture and the railways.

As well as forming a company for the project, Northern and Eastern, Handley obtained the services of engineer James Walker to survey the proposed route. In 1836 various proposals for such lines were considered by parliament; the Northern and Eastern line was approved, but only as far as Cambridge (George Stephenson had convinced parliament that a Northern line via Derby was sufficient).|$|R

50|$|He {{was also}} a {{respected}} scientist and inventor and was a Fellow of the Royal Society. The short biography attached to his pencil portrait explains {{that he was an}} inventor of a steam carriage, (actually the modifier for safety reasons), the gravitating compass and a tape-loom. He was a great industrial improver, with great enthusiasm for modern machinery. Heintroduced “steam” to Caithness by improving and making previous designs safer. First camehis “steam car” in 1860, followed by the <b>steam</b> <b>plough</b> which he used to create his new farm atPhilip Mains, Mey. He also invented an automatic rail-carriage-washer for the American market.One of his most unexpected inventions was an artificial leg, with which he won a prize at theFrench Exhibition in Paris in 1866. In 1877, he published “Lectures on Popular and ScientificSubjects”.|$|R
5000|$|Howard was {{initially}} apprenticed to an ironmonger at Olney, Buckinghamshire by the Trustees of Bedford Charity.

50|$|Nazi {{archaeology}} {{was rarely}} conducted {{with an eye}} to pure research, but was a propaganda tool designed to both generate nationalistic pride in Germans and provide scientific excuses for conquest. The German people were drawn to the idea of Germany as the site of the origins of civilisation by several means. For one, there were a series of films put out by Lothar Zotz with titles like Threatened by the <b>Steam</b> <b>Plough,</b> Germany’s Bronze Age, The Flames of Prehistory and On the Trail of the Eastern Germans. These used the appeal of myths, olden times, and German triumph over change to reinforce the idea that German history was something to be proud of, {{while at the same time}} taking advantage of the fact that since these periods of history were little known to the general public, they could include heavy doses of propaganda.|$|R

And observe its effect on the national strength. Without machines, you have a hundred and fifty yeomen ready to join for defence of the land. You get your machine, starve fifty of them, make diamond-cutters or footmen of as many more, and for your national defence against an enemy, you have now, and can have, only fifty men, instead of a hundred and fifty; these also now with minds much alienated from you as their chief,[141] and the rest, lapidaries or footmen; and a <b>steam</b> <b>plough.</b>|$|R
