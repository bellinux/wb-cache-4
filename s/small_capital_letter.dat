50|$|The uvular trill {{is a type}} of consonantal sound, used in some spoken languages. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that {{represents}} this sound is , a <b>small</b> <b>capital</b> <b>letter</b> R. This consonant is one of several collectively called guttural R.|$|E
50|$|The voiced uvular implosive is an {{extremely}} rare type of consonantal sound. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is , a <b>small</b> <b>capital</b> <b>letter</b> G with a rightward pointing hook extending from the upper right of the letter.|$|E
50|$|Kra (Kʼ / ĸ) is a glyph {{formerly}} used {{to write}} the Kalaallisut language of Greenland and is now only found in Nunatsiavummiutut, a distinct Inuktitut dialect. It is visually similar to a Latin <b>small</b> <b>capital</b> <b>letter</b> K and the Greek letter kappa κ.|$|E

50|$|The near-close near-front unrounded vowel, or near-high near-front unrounded vowel, {{is a type}} of vowel sound, used in some spoken languages. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that {{represents}} this sound is , i.e. a <b>small</b> <b>capital</b> <b>letter</b> i. The International Phonetic Association advises serifs on the symbol's ends. Some sans-serif fonts do meet this typographic specification.Prior to 1989, there was an alternate symbol for this sound: , the use of which is no longer sanctioned by the IPA. Despite that, some modern writings still use it.|$|E

2500|$|The IPA {{standard}} {{includes some}} <b>small</b> <b>capital</b> <b>letters,</b> such as , {{although it is}} common to refer to these symbols as simply [...] "capital" [...] or [...] "cap" [...] letters, because the IPA standard does not include any full-size <b>capital</b> <b>letters.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{regiment}} {{has been}} awarded 35 battle honours, of which 23 are emblazoned upon the colours (those in bold type below), and one honorary distinction. Battle honours in <b>small</b> <b>capital</b> <b>letters</b> are for large operations and campaigns, and those in title case are for more specific battles.|$|R
5000|$|Block {{letters may}} {{also be used as}} a synonym of block capitals, which means writing in all <b>capital</b> <b>letters</b> or in large and <b>small</b> <b>capital</b> <b>letters,</b> imitating the style of typeset <b>capital</b> <b>letters.</b> This is not a {{necessary}} implication, however: in at least one court case involving patents, trademarks and registration of designs, the term [...] "block letters" [...] was found to include both upper and lower case.|$|R
2500|$|In {{time the}} {{need to change the}} car designations to {{distinguish}} between the non-electrified and electrified cars other than by adding an E became apparent, and it was decided to make the initial M be a [...] "small" [...] <b>capital</b> <b>letter</b> for the non-electrified cars. <b>Small</b> <b>capital</b> <b>letters</b> are awkward to use, so many books have used the LIRR scheme of omitting the initial M for the non-electrified cars (P54) while less commonly a lower-case m is used instead of the <b>small</b> <b>capital</b> (mP54).|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} 2005 Ascender {{announced}} its first OpenType Pro font, Pericles Pro.

25|$|The royalty, nobility, and gentry of Europe {{traditionally}} have many names, including phrases for the lands that they own. The French developed {{the method of}} putting the term by which the person is referred in <b>small</b> <b>capital</b> <b>letters.</b> It is this habit which transferred to names of the Far East, as seen below. An example is that of Marie-Joseph-Paul-Yves-Roch Gilbert du Motier, who {{is known as the}} Marquis de Lafayette. Notice that he possessed the lands both of Motier and Lafayette.|$|R

The blue keys in the middle are punctuation, digits, <b>small</b> <b>capital</b> <b>letters</b> and fixed-width spaces. In proper keyboard operation, an experienced operator's left hand operates only the spaceband key and the left column of keys. The operator's right hand strokes the remaining keys on the entire keyboard.|$|R

5|$|The sound {{values of}} {{modified}} Latin letters {{can often be}} derived {{from those of the}} original letters. For example, letters with a rightward-facing hook at the bottom represent retroflex consonants; and <b>small</b> <b>capital</b> <b>letters</b> usually represent uvular consonants. Apart from the fact that certain kinds of modification to the shape of a letter generally correspond to certain kinds of modification to the sound represented, {{there is no way to}} deduce the sound represented by a symbol from its shape (as for example in Visible Speech) nor even any systematic relation between signs and the sounds they represent (as in Hangul).|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of this, there are two {{versions}} of Lexicon: Lexicon no. 1 and Lexicon no. 2. The {{difference between these two}} lie in the extenders: Lexicon no. 1 is basically the dictionary version, which has very short extenders, while Lexicon no. 2 has extenders of a more regular length. Lexicon has been designed for optimal legibility, specifically when set very small. This is achieved, in part, by its large x-height—resulting in open counters—and by the relatively <b>small</b> <b>capital</b> <b>letters.</b> Just as Trinité, Lexicon shows a strong calligraphic influence, specifically that of the broad-nibbed pen.|$|R

40|$|There {{is about}} 6 × 10 ^ 15 eight-character strings from Czech <b>small</b> and <b>capital</b> <b>letters</b> and numbers. The vast {{majority}} of such passwords is impossible to remember because of no association with any “reasonable” contents. In this paper we come to an estimate {{that the number of}} meaningful Czech sentences containing 4 – 5 words is certainly by several decimal orders higher (even without distinguishing <b>small</b> and <b>capital</b> <b>letters),</b> and passwords created in this way are easy to remember. Further we show some simple ways to extend the “space” of such passwords up to ca. 10 ^ 40 theoretically possible strings without significantly complicating the possibility to remember the chosen password. A method for efficient generation of strong passwords is thus offered...|$|R
50|$|Periodical publications, {{especially}} {{newspapers and}} magazines, use typographical elements {{to achieve an}} attractive, distinctive appearance, to aid readers in navigating the publication, {{and in some cases}} for dramatic effect. By formulating a style guide, a publication or periodical standardizes with a relatively small collection of typefaces, each used for specific elements within the publication, and makes consistent use of typefaces, case, type sizes, italic, boldface, colors, and other typographic features such as combining large and <b>small</b> <b>capital</b> <b>letters</b> together. Some publications, such as The Guardian and The Economist, {{go so far as to}} commission a type designer to create customized typefaces for their exclusive use.|$|R
2500|$|As {{a typical}} example, the axioms for {{projective}} geometry use 2 types, points and lines, and a binary incidence relation between points and lines.

5000|$|The {{abbreviation}} BCE, {{just as with}} BC, always {{follows the}} year number. Unlike AD, which traditionally precedes the year number, CE always follows the year number (if context requires that it be written at all). Thus, the current year is written as [...] in both notations (or, if further clarity is needed, as [...] CE, or as AD [...] ), and the year that Socrates died is represented as 399 BCE (the same year that is represented by 399 BC in the BC/AD notation). The abbreviations are sometimes written with <b>small</b> <b>capital</b> <b>letters,</b> or with periods (e.g., [...] "B.C.E." [...] or [...] "C.E."). Style guides for academic texts on religion generally prefer BCE/CE to BC/AD.|$|R
500|$|An Official {{passport}} has [...] "OFFICIEL" [...] (in all <b>capital</b> <b>letters)</b> {{above the}} words [...] "الجمهورية اللبنانية", [...] "REPUBLIQUE LIBANAISE", and [...] "REPUBLIC OF LEBANON" [...] (in all <b>capital</b> <b>letters).</b> The <b>capital</b> <b>letters</b> of [...] "OFFICIEL" [...] are somewhat <b>smaller</b> than the <b>capital</b> <b>letters</b> of [...] "REPUBLIQUE LIBANAISE", and [...] "REPUBLIC OF LEBANON".|$|R

5000|$|The home {{guernsey}} {{is primarily}} royal blue {{with a red}} and white hoop. The player numbers are white, and located high upon the back.

50|$|The game can be {{completed}} in one relatively short sitting, or using password and battery-backed save support like in the original 3D Special. Passwords consists of both <b>small</b> and <b>capital</b> Latin <b>letters,</b> with some additional characters uncommon to NES games.|$|R
50|$|Alay text {{may have}} {{originated}} from {{the method of}} making strong passwords for internet accounts, which requires combinations of <b>small</b> and <b>capital</b> <b>letters,</b> numbers, as well as special characters. Normally, to keep the password meaningful and easy to remember, the password would consist of normal words, where some letters are capitalized or substituted with numbers (e.g. the letter a with 4, the letter o with 0). Soon this becomes a habit in writing text in general, and improved with mixing English and Indonesian in one sentence.|$|R
2500|$|The actual {{seal used}} by the {{president}} was changed to have a similar design, though apparently not at the time. [...] The Daily Graphic article reported the 1850 seal was still in use in 1885, but the change {{had been made by}} 1894, as an impression of this new seal was obtained from Henry T. Thurber (President Cleveland's private secretary) for use in a book on heraldry. [...] This version moved closer to the modern design, with the words OF THE in <b>smaller</b> <b>capital</b> <b>letters</b> than the other words (a feature which is still used), and the layout of stars being slightly changed into essentially the arrangement still used today. [...] This seal remained in use until 1945, as Gaillard Hunt confirmed the design was still current as of 1916, and it also matches actual impressions taken from the presidential seal in 1936 during Franklin Roosevelt's administration. [...] The design continued to evolve in other places in the meantime, particularly the presidential flag, and these evolved designs were used when the seal was changed again in 1945.|$|R
2500|$|The Hunterian {{system has}} faced {{criticism}} {{over the years}} for not producing phonetically-accurate results and being [...] "unashamedly geared towards an English-language receiver audience." [...] Specifically, the lack of differentiation between retroflex and dental consonants (e.g. द and ड are both represented by d) has come in for repeated criticism and inspired several proposed modifications of Hunterian, including using a diacritic below retroflexes (e.g. making द=d and ड=ḍ, which is more readable but requires diacritic printing) or capitalizing them (e.g. making द=d and ड=D, which requires no diacritic printing but is less readable because it mixes <b>small</b> and <b>capital</b> <b>letters</b> in words).|$|R
60|$|In {{the matter}} of <b>small</b> or <b>capital</b> <b>letters</b> I have {{followed}} the old copy, except {{in one or two}} places where a personification seemed not plainly enough marked to a modern reader without a capital. Thus in Il Penseroso, l. 49, I print Leasure, although both editions read leasure; and in the Vacation Exercise, l. 71, Times for times. Also where the employment or omission of a capital is plainly due to misprinting, as too frequently in the 1673 edition, I silently make the correction. Examples are, notes for Notes in Sonnet xvii. l. 13; Anointed for anointed in Psalm ii. l.12.|$|R
