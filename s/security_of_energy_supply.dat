40|$|Abstract- The {{threat posed}} by climate change and the striving for <b>securities</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> <b>supply</b> are issues high on the {{political}} agenda these days. Governments are putting strategic plans in motion to decrease primary energy use, take carbon out of fuels and facilitate modal shifts. Taking a prominent place in these strategic plans is hydrogen as a future energy carrier. Energy stored in hydrogen would be available {{at any time and}} at any place on Earth, regardless of when or where the solar irradiance, the hydropower, or other renewable sources such as biomass, ocean energy or wind energy was converted. The fundamental variations in the times and places <b>of</b> solar <b>energy</b> <b>supply</b> and human <b>energy</b> demands can be overcome using hydrogen. Hydrogen gas combined with the standard air/fuel mixture increases the mileage. This form of alternative fuel is provided by a hydrogen generator mounted in the vehicle. Once set up i...|$|R

40|$|Recent oil and {{gas price}} rises coupled with Russia – Ukraine gas supply interruptions have again {{focussed}} attention on <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> <b>supply.</b> <b>Security</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> <b>supply</b> {{is not always a}} well-defined or understood term. It is a multi-faceted phenomenon and may be classified in terms of physical (quantity) risks and price (economic) risks. It may also be treated in different timeframes, with short-term risks typically having different characteristics and impacts than long-term risks. This paper investigates the issues associated with <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> <b>supply</b> using Ireland a case study for the analysis. The focus is on the electricity rather than thermal or transport energy markets. This provides a direct linkage to renewable energy policy, which in Ireland has been concentrated principally on in creasing renewable energy penetration in the electricity market. This in turn results in the focus of this paper being on security of gas supply, as gas is account for 72 % of Ireland’s electricity generation fuel mix in 2020. The paper examines a number of concerns regarding the existing gas supply system and explores options to address these. These include the short term risks associated with the single point of failure on the Scottish Interconnector and low pressure gas supply in the Cork area. The long term issues are linked to the increasing geographical concentration from which imports are drawn coupled with delays in harnessing the gas from the Corrib Gas Field. While options do exist for improving the gas supply infrastructure, a key component of improving Ireland’s <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> <b>supply</b> is the increased penetration of renewable energy, in particular wind energy in the short term. The key advantages of renewable energy in this regard are related to the indigenous nature of renewable resources and that absence of fuel price volatility...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The European Union is {{committed}} to ambitious targets for increasing the use <b>of</b> renewable <b>energy</b> sources, because these are expected to contribute to wider EU policies for the <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> <b>supplies,</b> {{the environment and the}} competitiveness of EU industries. The Commission is therefore active in developing legislation and managing programmes which contribute to these targets and policies and encourage member states to also take the necessary actions in that respect on their level. The solar photovoltaic energy sector should be able {{to play a role in}} helping to meet European targets for the deployment <b>of</b> renewable <b>energies,</b> but this will only be possible if PV prices are brought down to levels which are competitive with those of other sources of electricity. The new directive on green electricity has opened a window of opportunity for renewable energy to demonstrate that it can make a valuable contribution to EU <b>energy</b> <b>supplies,</b> and the Commission is keen to work with the European PV industry and other interested stakeholders to take maximum advantage of this...|$|R
