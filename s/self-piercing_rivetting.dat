40|$|Abstract. Lightweight materials, such as {{aluminum}} die castings, {{are used}} {{more and more}} for automotive applications. Due to the limited weldability, joining these materials by <b>self-pierce</b> <b>riveting</b> has been established. The challenge {{in this regard is}} that these materials, especially new high strength aluminum die castings, have a limited ductility, while the joining processes locally induce large plastic deformations. Consequently, joining by forming of these materials can be accompanied by cracks, which develop during the forming operation. This paper shows the experimental and numerical investigation of a new die concept for <b>self-pierce</b> <b>riveting</b> materials with limited ductility.

40|$|Advanced {{lightweight}} materials, such as {{high strength}} aluminium and magnesium alloys, are used in an expanding range of engineering applications, {{such as in the}} transport sector, machine and equipment construction or the general construction industry. Thermal welding of these materials is, in contrast to steel, problematic since it severely affects both the static and fatigue resistance of the joint and the base material. This has strengthened the demand for more suitable joining techniques without heat input. The focus of the present research is on the application of two of the most important conventional cold joining techniques (clinching and <b>self-pierce</b> <b>riveting)</b> for these new emerging lightweight materials. The challenge in this regard is that these materials have a limited ductility, while the joining processes locally induce large plastic deformations. Consequently, joining these materials can be accompanied by cracks which develop during the forming operation. This situation has limited the use of these materials and of the joining processes in the past. The aim of the project was to develop rules and guidelines based on scientific results determining either how cracks induced by clinching or <b>self-pierce</b> <b>riveting</b> can be avoided or which cracks are acceptable. Therefore, the damage behaviour of lightweight materials, such as aluminium and magnesium, during the clinching and <b>self-pierce</b> <b>riveting</b> process was investigated both experimentally and numerically. The results from the project can be summarized as follows:Depending on the joining parameters and location in the component, different damages can occur during clinching or <b>self-pierce</b> <b>riveting</b> of materials with limited ductility. The relationships between joining parameters and the risk for damages in the closing head or part edge are demonstrated in this report and the risk for joining process-induced damages can be minimized by choosing the suitable joining tools. For all material combinations considered within this project it could not be observed that the joining process-induced damages {{have a negative effect on}} the resulting joint strength. This was determined for quasi-static and cyclic loads for both clinching as well as <b>self-pierce</b> <b>riveting.</b> In the numerical investigations regarding the damage modelling it was determined that the damage location as well as the level can be calculated by simple as well as complex fracture models.

The possibility of replacing a steel <b>self-piercing</b> <b>rivet</b> with an aluminium one has thus been raised as an interesting topic. Within this framework, the objective of the present paper is to provide an experimental database on the riveting process using an aluminium <b>self-piercing</b> <b>rivet.</b> An experimental programme has been carried out, where two similar sheets in aluminium alloy 6060 in three different tempers (temper W, temper T 4, and temper T 6) have been joined by using a <b>self-piercing</b> <b>rivet</b> in three different alloys, i. e. 6082 -T 6, 7108 -T 5, and 7278 -T 6. The influence of the die shape on the SPR of aluminium sheets using aluminium rivets was also considered. Conventional rivets and dies according to the Boellhoff standards were employed. The test results were exploited in terms of the riveting force–displacement curves and cross-sectional geometries of the riveted joints. The test data were also used to validate a 2 D-axisymmetric model, which was originally developed at SIMLab for modelling the riveting process using a steel rivet. Finally, the mechanical behaviour of a riveted connection using an aluminium rivet under quasi-static loading conditions (i. e. combined pure shear and pure opening loads) was experimentally studied and compared with corresponding tests using a steel rivet in terms of force–displacement curves...|$|R

40|$|<b>Self-piercing</b> <b>riveting</b> as an {{alternative}} joining method to spot-welding has attracted considerable interest from the automotive industry and has been widely used in aluminium intensive vehicles.

This paper reports the influence of sheet pre-straining on the static and fatigue behaviour of <b>self-piercing</b> <b>riveted</b> aluminium alloy sheet. Wrought aluminium alloy sheet, NG 5754 with a nominal thickness value of 2 mm was used to obtain pre-strained NG 5754 sheets with pre-straining levels of 3 %, 5 % and 10 %. Pairs of pre-strained NG 5754 sheets were joined to create single-riveted lap joints which subsequently underwent lap-shear and fatigue testing. Microscopic inspection showed that the joint quality was satisfactory despite the increasing sheet straining levels. The results showed that by increasing the pre-straining level up to 10 %, the shear and fatigue strength also increased. The rate of increase of the static and fatigue strength differed as the pre-straining levels varied. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

In the cases where the sheet material failed, an increase in sheet material strength led to an increase in joint strength.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of alternative materials {{and in particular}} aluminium alloys, for vehicle body applications has impelled {{the development of new}} joining techniques. Traditional joining methods such as spot-welding and arc-welding are being challenged. <b>Self-piercing</b> <b>riveting</b> has attracted considerable interest by the automotive industry and has been used as an alternative to spot-welding in vehicle body assembly. However, <b>self-piercing</b> <b>riveting</b> is a relatively new joining method and as such it is not well understood. The aim of this project was therefore to develop an understanding of the mechanical behaviour of <b>self-piercing</b> <b>riveted</b> joints. The effects of paint-baking, shelf-life, pre-straining and surface condition of the sheet material on the joint quality and behaviour were therefore examined. Aluminium alloy sheet materials, 5754 and AA 6111, were used in this investigation. The project began with a metallographic inspection of cross-sections of samples that were joined under different conditions in order to examine the effect of process variables on the joint quality. This part of the investigation led to the identification of suitable setting parameters that produced joints which, by metallographic inspection, were of good quality. It was also observed that some process variables, such as sheet thickness combination, rivet and die design and setting force, affected the joint quality and therefore needed to be taken into consideration in the choice of the processing parameters. Subsequent work focused on mechanical testing. Lap shear, T-peel, pull-out and fatigue tests were carried out in order to examine the mechanical behaviour and to analyse the failure mechanisms of the joints. The work showed that the strength, the thickness and the surface condition of the riveted sheets affected the strength and the failure mechanisms of the joints. The joint strength was also observed to be dependent on the rivet and anvil design as well as the setting force. In addition, the joint strength and behaviour differed as the specimen geometry thus emphasising the need for a test standard for <b>self-piercing</b> <b>riveted</b> joints.
