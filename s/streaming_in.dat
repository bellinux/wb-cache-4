Digital downloads of a track were included from 2004 onwards and from 2014 onwards BPI-certified awards (Silver, Gold and Platinum) and the weekly charts include audio <b>streaming.</b> <b>In</b> 2017, the OCC included <b>streaming</b> <b>in</b> their {{definition of}} a million-seller and published a full list of the 311 songs which had achieved this. Certified awards can also include shipments (sales to trade). The OCC and Music Week regularly announce when a record becomes a million seller.|$|E

5|$|C-SPAN began {{promoting}} audience interaction {{early in}} its history, by the regular incorporation of viewer telephone calls in its programming. It has since expanded into social media. In March 2009, viewers began submitting questions live via Twitter to guests on C-SPAN's morning call-in show Washington Journal. The network {{also has a}} Facebook page to which it added occasional live <b>streaming</b> <b>in</b> January 2011. The live stream is intended to show selected well-publicized events of Congress.

5|$|Despite its {{political}} satire, the film received {{a positive response}} from the government of Singapore. Goh Chok Tong, then Prime Minister of Singapore, commended Jack Neo's creative talent during his National Day Rally address on 18 August 2002. In 2004, Neo was the first local film-maker to receive a National Day Award, and on 21 October 2005, he and Dick Lee became the first pop culture artists to receive the Cultural Medallion, Singapore's highest arts award. The movie sparked public discussion and parliamentary debate about {{the negative effects of}} <b>streaming.</b> <b>In</b> 2004, the Ministry of Education decided to merge the EM1 and EM2 streams, and on 29 September 2006, it announced that the EM3 stream will be scrapped by 2008.|$|E

5|$|The initial {{attack by}} Bauduin's brigade emptied {{the wood and}} park, but was driven back by heavy British {{artillery}} fire, and cost Bauduin his life. As the British guns were distracted by a duel with French artillery, a second attack by Soye's brigade and what had been Bauduin's succeeded in reaching the north gate of the house. Sous-Lieutenant Legros, a French officer, broke the gate open with an axe, and some French troops managed to enter the courtyard. The Coldstream Guards and the Scots Guards arrived to support the defence. There was a fierce melee, and the British managed to close the gate on the French troops <b>streaming</b> <b>in.</b> The Frenchmen trapped in the courtyard were all killed. Only a young drummer boy was spared.|$|E
5|$|The upper tier is {{contoured}} {{to leave}} open {{space in the}} corners of the ground, and the roof is significantly canted inwards. Both of these features are meant to provide as much airflow and sunlight to the pitch as possible. The stadium gives an illusion that supporters in the upper tier {{on one side of the}} ground are unable to see supporters in the upper tier opposite. As part of a deal with Sony, the stadium was the first in the world to incorporate HDTV <b>streaming.</b> <b>In</b> the north-west and south-east corners of the stadium are two giant screens suspended from the roof.|$|E
5|$|The camera {{work and}} editing work {{together}} to further heighten the frightening qualities of the film. Eleanor is often viewed from above, and in one scene the camera closes in so tightly on her that she is forced backward over a railing. Eleanor's viewpoint is often juxtaposed with eerie views of the house, as if both viewpoints were the same. Many of the editing choices in the film are also used to heighten the audience's discomfort. There {{are a number of}} rapid cuts in the film that throw off the viewer's sense of spatial orientation, and Dutch angles are used to imply that reality is off-kilter. Cutting on action—showing the characters exiting a room to the right, only to show them entering the next room from the left—is often violated, so that the viewer cannot get a clear sense of which rooms and hallways are connected to one another. The audience also lacks temporal clues. There are few shots in which they can see out a window to determine whether it's night or day. When Eleanor is rescued by Dr. Markway on the unstable spiral staircase, some of the windows nearby show strong sunlight <b>streaming</b> <b>in,</b> while others show darkness outside.|$|E

5|$|Poland {{had become}} the home to Europe's largest Jewish population, as royal edicts guaranteeing Jewish safety and {{religious}} freedom, issued during the 13th century (Bolesław the Pious, Statute of Kalisz of 1264), contrasted with bouts of persecution in Western Europe. This persecution intensified following the Black Death of 1348–1349, when some in the West blamed {{the outbreak of the}} plague on the Jews. As scapegoats were sought, the increased Jewish persecution led to pogroms and mass killings in a number of German cities, which caused an exodus of survivors heading east. Much of Poland was spared from the Black Death, and Jewish immigration brought their valuable contributions and abilities to the rising state. The number of Jews in Poland kept increasing throughout the Middle Ages; the population had reached about 30,000 {{toward the end of the}} 15th century, and, as refugees escaping further persecution elsewhere kept <b>streaming</b> <b>in,</b> 150,000 in the 16th century. A royal privilege issued in 1532 granted the Jews freedom to trade anywhere within the kingdom. Massacres and expulsions from many German states continued until 1552–1553. By the mid-16th century, 80% of the world's Jews lived and flourished in Poland and in Lithuania; most of western and central Europe was by that time closed to Jews. In Poland–Lithuania the Jews were increasingly finding employment as managers and intermediaries, facilitating the functioning of and collecting revenue in huge magnate-owned land estates, especially in the eastern borderlands, developing into an indispensable mercantile and administrative class. Despite the partial resettlement of Jews in Western Europe following the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648), a great majority of world Jewry had lived in Eastern Europe (in the Commonwealth and in the regions further east and south, where many migrated), until the 1940s.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBased on 390 benthic {{invertebrate}} {{samples from}} near-natural <b>streams</b> <b>in</b> Germany we defined eight stream type groups by Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS). The taxa lists were restricted to Mollusca, Ephemeroptera, Odonata, Plecoptera, Coleoptera and Trichoptera species and evaluated on presence/absence level. At genus level, <b>streams</b> located <b>in</b> the lowlands differ from <b>streams</b> <b>in</b> lower mountainous {{areas and the}} Alps, while the two latter groups were undistinguishable. At species level, a clear separation of different stream size classes is visible in the lowlands; a second gradient {{is related to the}} bottom substrate. <b>Streams</b> <b>in</b> the Alps can be distinguished from <b>streams</b> <b>in</b> lower mountainous areas at species level. Within the lower mountainous regions a size gradient is detectable, a less obvious gradient indicates catchment geology.
