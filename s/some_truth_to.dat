5|$|The Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions had in {{the year}} since {{publication}} received highly critical replies from state legislatures. Seven states formally responded to Virginia and Kentucky by rejecting the Resolutions and three other states passed resolutions expressing disapproval, with the other four states taking no action. No other state endorsed the Resolutions. The reason for the criticism was that the General Assembly, led in the effort by state-sovereignty advocate John Taylor of Caroline, had put a state-sovereignty spin on the Virginia Resolutions of 1798 despite Madison's hopes. These replies contended that the Supreme Court of the United States had the ultimate responsibility for deciding whether federal laws were constitutional, and that the Alien and Sedition Acts were constitutional and necessary. The Federalists accused the Democratic-Republicans of seeking disunion, even contemplating violence. At the time, some leading Virginia Democratic-Republican figures such as Rep. William Branch Giles (in public) and Taylor (in private) actually were contemplating disunion, and the Virginia General Assembly chose this juncture for finally constructing a new state armory in Richmond, so there was <b>some</b> <b>truth</b> <b>to</b> the charge.|$|E

[...] "It brings <b>some</b> <b>truths</b> <b>to</b> light while leaving viewers intrigued so they're sure tune in for the next episode." [...] Flasher praised the writers, Nina Fiore and John Herrera, of the episode saying that they managed to say [...] "four separate stories, in different locations and different decades altogether into one eye opening, question answering episode" [...] as well as the director Joshua Butler, for whom she stated that he did a great job.|$|R

25|$|It is {{interesting}} to note that whereas the prose draft of Das Rheingold was written before that of Die Walküre, the verse draft of Die Walküre preceded that of Das Rheingold. So while there is <b>some</b> <b>truth</b> <b>to</b> the oft-quoted remark that the Ring cycle was conceived backwards, it is not completely accurate.|$|E
25|$|In February 1965 Togawa {{visited the}} Yaeyama Islands. He had heard in Naha from a {{newspaper}} columnist {{that there were}} rumors of wild cats living on Iriomote. He at first assumed that, like reports of the extinct Japanese wolf, people must have been mistaking escaped and feral house pets for wild animals. He spoke with colleague Tetsuo Koura who knew of and believed there to be <b>some</b> <b>truth</b> <b>to</b> the rumors. Koura then entrusted Togawa {{with the task of}} acquiring evidence. Togawa then traveled to Iriomote to gather information for his own report and to collect information on the Iriomote cat and a specimen.|$|E
25|$|In September 2014, Huawei faced {{a lawsuit}} from T-Mobile, which alleged that Huawei stole {{technology}} from its Bellevue, Washington, headquarters. T-Mobile claimed in its filed suit that Huawei's employees snuck into a T-Mobile lab {{during the period}} of 2012-2013 and stole parts of its smartphone testing robot Tappy. The Huawei employees then copied the operating software and design details, violating confidentiality agreements that both companies signed. Furthermore, Huawei is now using that intel to build its own testing robot. A Huawei spokesman stated to The New York Times that there is <b>some</b> <b>truth</b> <b>to</b> the complaint, but that the two employees involved have been fired. T-Mobile has since stopped using Huawei as a supplier, which T-Mobile says could cost it {{tens of millions of dollars}} as it moves away from its handsets.|$|E

50|$|Centuries later, {{historian}} Ariel Toaff, in {{his book}} Pasque Di Sangue (Passovers of Blood), hypothesized {{that there may be}} <b>some</b> historical <b>truth</b> <b>to</b> the accusations in Trent.

25|$|The Samaritans regard {{themselves}} as direct {{descendants of the}} tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh in the northern Kingdom of Israel, which was conquered by Assyria in 722 BCE. Modern genetics has suggested <b>some</b> <b>truth</b> <b>to</b> both {{the claims of the}} Samaritans and of the Jews in account to the Talmud. Samaritan scripture preserves a version of the Pentateuch in slightly variant forms. The first historical references to the Samaritans date from the Babylonian Exile. According to the Talmud, Samaritans are to be treated as Jews in matters where their practice agrees with the mainstream but are otherwise to be treated as non-Jews. The Samaritans have dwindled to two communities of about 700 individuals. One such community is located in the Israeli city of Holon, while the other is located near Nablus on Mount Gerizim, in the West Bank.|$|E
500|$|The island church, which overlooks Kirk Sand {{in the bay}} of Fore Wick, {{was founded}} in 1806. 300metres from the present church {{there may be an}} older chapel site of Sneeans or Snøyans on the {{headland}} between the west end of Kirk Sand and the bay of Tusselby. It is called the 'ald kirk' by locals and referred to by the Ordnance Survey as [...] "the site of a Romish chapel belonging to about the twelfth century". There is a tradition that the work there was interfered with by supernatural powers and that each day's work on the building was destroyed during the night. Eventually the cornerstones were moved overnight by these unearthly agencies to the present site of the church and work was re-commenced there successfully. Excavations in 2004 found little besides large blocks of rhyolite and a piece of whalebone rib, suggesting that the oral tradition may have <b>some</b> <b>truth</b> <b>to</b> it.|$|E
500|$|Lactantius criticized Diocletian for an {{excessive}} increase in troop sizes, declaring that [...] "each {{of the four}} [...] strove to have a far larger number of troops than previous emperors had when they were governing the state alone". The fifth-century pagan Zosimus, by contrast, praised Diocletian for keeping troops on the borders, rather than keeping them in the cities, as Constantine was held to have done. Both these views had <b>some</b> <b>truth</b> <b>to</b> them, despite the biases of their authors: Diocletian and the tetrarchs did greatly expand the army, and the growth was mostly in frontier regions, where the increased effectives of the new Diocletianic legions {{seem to have been}} mostly spread across a network of strongholds. Nevertheless, it is difficult to establish the precise details of these shifts given the weakness of the sources. The army expanded to about 580,000 men from a 285 strength of 390,000, of which 310,000 men were stationed in the East, most of whom manned the Persian frontier. The navy's forces increased from approximately 45,000 men to approximately 65,000 men.|$|E

There may be <b>some</b> <b>truth</b> <b>to</b> the legend, as Reelfoot Lake in Tennessee was formed by that earthquake. [...] Most geologists feel {{the lake was}} formed, either {{gradually}} or catastrophically, by the [...] "Great Raft", a 100-mile (160-km) log jam on the Red River in Louisiana, possibly by flooding the existing low-lying basin.|$|E
2500|$|Corgan's {{desire for}} musical {{perfection}} put further {{strain on the}} already-frayed relationships between the band members. Vig later recalled, [...] "D'arcy would lock herself in the bathroom, James wouldn't say anything, or Billy would lock himself in the control room". Corgan often overdubbed Iha's and Wretzky's parts with his own playing. Wretzky stated that Corgan only performed most of the guitar and bass parts because he could lay them down more easily in recording [...] and with far fewer takes. Stories of the album's recording had circulated in the music press. Corgan admitted there was <b>some</b> <b>truth</b> <b>to</b> accusations of tyrannical behavior, though he felt the press misunderstood the situation.|$|E
5000|$|Such British {{newsreels}} as The Battle of the Somme of World War I were propaganda {{because they}} only showed the war {{from their own}} perspective, though {{it can be argued}} as being more honest and objective than more recent war documentaries (for they were edited without adjustments for dramatic or epic effect). Their photographers remained on their front lines, therefore presenting at least <b>some</b> <b>truth.</b> According <b>to</b> Furhammar and Isaksson, it was Russian filmmakers who were the [...] "masters of montage" [...] who discovered film's power to create convincing illusion with cutting, rhythmic editing, and a didactic approach.|$|R
5000|$|The writer Marc Scott Zicree, {{who spent}} years researching his book The Twilight Zone Companion, noted, [...] "Sometimes the {{situations}} were clichéd, the characters two-dimensional, but always {{there was at}} least some search for an emotional <b>truth,</b> <b>some</b> attempt <b>to</b> make a statement on the human condition." ...|$|R
50|$|Revelation may {{be defined}} as the {{communication}} of <b>some</b> <b>truth</b> by God <b>to</b> a rational creature through means which are beyond the ordinary course of nature. George Joyce draws a distinction between revelation and inspiration. Inspiration - such as that bestowed by God on the author of a sacred book - involves a special illumination of the mind, in virtue of which the recipient conceives such thoughts as God desires him to commit to writing, and does not necessarily involve supernatural communication.|$|R
2500|$|The {{editorial}} of The News International {{noted that}} the attack [...] "is {{a reminder that the}} internal challenges we face are even greater and cannot be blamed on other countries". An editorial in The Nation also mentioned that [...] "the narrative will soon turn towards blaming the 'foreign hand' that feed terrorists in Pakistan, it must be remembered that many of our terrorist groups are entities that are very much based in Pakistan". The editorial in Dawn also echoed that [...] "the country's civil and military leaderships will unite to condemn the attacks and bemoan them as an attempt to sabotage CPEC by outside forces. While there may be <b>some</b> <b>truth</b> <b>to</b> those allegations, the twin attacks in Mastung and Gwadar almost certainly have very local roots".|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{campaign}} a saying arose that the Generals [...] and [...] (January and February) defeated Napoleon, {{alluding to the}} Russian Winter. [...] Although {{the campaign}} was over by mid-December, there is <b>some</b> <b>truth</b> <b>to</b> the saying. [...] The coming winter weather was heavy {{on the minds of}} Napoleon's closest advisers. The army was equipped with summer clothing, and did not have the means to protect themselves from the cold. In addition, it lacked the ability to forge caulkined shoes for the horses to enable them to walk over roads that had become iced over. The most devastating effect of the cold weather upon Napoleon's forces occurred during their retreat. Hypothermia coupled with starvation led to the loss of thousands. In his memoir, Napoleon's close adviser Armand de Caulaincourt recounted scenes of massive loss, and offered a vivid description of mass death through hypothermia: ...|$|E

In his nephew Tancredi he sees a younger version of himself but he knows that Tancredi will need to in some ways accept the new power and the new ways for there to be any chance of saving some part of that older time.

5000|$|The {{couple were}} not {{pursuing}} the occult, but {{were inspired by}} intelligences in the transcendental world.

At the request of the transcendental world, Johanne Agerskov agreed to be a mediator, as before her birth she had promised to be instrumental in bringing <b>some</b> eternal <b>truths</b> <b>to</b> mankind. The Agerskovs, together with two other couples, formed a circle, and during light time séances they claim to have had spiritual contact with spirits of the Light. The circle was asked to form questions concerning ethics, religion and science. During the séances, Johanne Agerskov was given answers to the questions by the means of intuitive thought-inspiration. Very early in their work, they were told that the work was initiated by God, Himself, and that they would be given [...] "three golden fruits" [...] (the books).|$|R

2500|$|In many places, {{cannabis}} {{is routinely}} mixed with tobacco when rolled into joints. [...] In North America cannabis {{in any form}} is also often [...] "chased" [...] with a tobacco cigarette, and hollowed-out cigars filled with cannabis (blunts) are also popular in some subcultures. [...] Some users say that smoking tobacco increases the cannabis high, and this is often attributed to either the nicotine or additives such as menthol. [...] Until recently this was based solely on anecdotal evidence. [...] There may be at least <b>some</b> <b>truth</b> <b>to</b> this legend, as a 2005 study found that a transdermal nicotine patch modestly enhanced the subjective [...] "high" [...] of cannabis relative to a placebo patch—but only in males. [...] Females actually saw a slight reduction in subjective effects. [...] Reasons for the enhancement are not well understood, and this study {{appears to be the}} only one as of 2010 that found such effects. [...] However, another study found a significant downside to the practice. [...] It appears that tobacco, which is known to be highly addictive, also enhances the likelihood of developing cannabis dependence symptoms when the two substances are used concurrently.|$|E
2500|$|Luo Maodeng's Sanbao Taijian Xia Xiyang Ji Tongsu Yanyi [...] (1597) is {{a fiction}} {{novel about the}} {{exploits}} of Admiral Zheng He and his fleet. In the preface, Luo states that Chinese maritime power was essential to maintaining the world order. In Luo's work, Admiral Zheng He sailed the oceans in search for a sacred imperial seal to restore harmony in the Middle Kingdom. However, he never finds the seal in the story, suggesting that it showed that the world order cannot be restored by other means than military force according to Finlay (1992). Luo Maodeng's novel contains a description of different classes of ships with their sizes: the 36 nine-masted treasure ships (baochuan) were 44.4 by 18 zhang, the 700 eight-masted horse ships (machuan) were 37 by 15 zhang, the 240 seven-masted grain ships or supply ships (liangchuan) were 28 by 12 zhang, the 300 six-masted billet ships or troop transports (zuochuan) were 24 by 9.4 zhang, and the 180 five-masted combat ships or warships proper (zhanchuan) were 18 by 6.8 zhang. Dreyer (2007) argues that this work holds little to no evidential value as a historical source. However, Duyvendak thinks {{that there may be}} <b>some</b> <b>truth</b> <b>to</b> it.|$|E
2500|$|Green was {{conceived}} in early- to mid-1940 {{and the plan}} was drawn up in August 1940, under three weeks after Hitler issued his initial warning order for Operation Sea Lion on 16 July 1940. [...] The plan was widely circulated and even publicised during the period 1940–1941. [...] By 1942 Green had even made {{its way into the}} hands of the Irish military via the British military and was subsequently translated into English by Irish Military Intelligence G2 Branch. This has raised suspicion that intercepted 'chatter' about Green may have been aimed at creating a 'bogeyman' in the minds of British military planners on their western flank. [...] There was <b>some</b> <b>truth</b> <b>to</b> this; one example is Generalmajor Walter Warlimont's recollection from 28 June 1940 of an operational instruction issued by the High Command. [...] The directive was to mislead the enemy on a possible invasion of neutral Ireland using [...] "all available information media". [...] The intention was to spread rumours that German forces were preparing a landing in Ireland to place a further stranglehold on Britain, reinforcing the current [...] "siege". It is possible that these efforts heightened the state of alert and were a cause of alarm in Britain, leading to the British expending significant effort in trying to convince the Irish government to abandon neutrality and side with the Allies.|$|E
40|$|By {{keeping their}} opening remarks very brief (the preface plus the micro-introduction {{add up to}} less than seven pages), the editors have made an unassuming choice: to let the work by the {{contributors}} do the talking. In other projects, this plunge into creative material without providing much of a historical or literary context might come across as daring, and with an anthology of social action writing, that risk {{may or may not}} pay off. The expectation of Fire and Ink, it appears, is that the reader (or instructor) will have some basic knowledge of activist writers and the range of social issues they are responding to with poetry, essays, rally speeches, op-eds or performance pieces. That presumption signals that this anthology is not for everybody: it has been shaped with a specific audience in mind.

40|$|The {{timeless}} {{solution to}} the problem of divine foreknowledge and human freedom has many advantages. Still, the relationship between a timeless God and temporal beings is problematic in a number of ways. In this paper, we focus on the specific problems the timeless view has to deal with when certain assumptions on the metaphysics of time are taken on board. It is shown that on static conception of time God’s omniscience is easily accounted for, but human freedom is threatened, while a dynamic conception has no problems with human freedom, but, on this view, <b>some</b> <b>truths</b> seem not <b>to</b> be knowable by a timeless God. We propose Fragmentalism as a metaphysics of time in which the divine timeless knowledge of temporal events and human freedom can be reconciled...|$|R

The figures that will be the focus of our research are Zhou Yu, Liu Bei, Cao Cao, and Zhuge Liang. The research will include first-hand translation of the original Chinese texts. Thesis: Although {{there is reason to believe}} there is <b>some</b> historical <b>truth</b> <b>to</b> the romanticized telling of the Battle of Red Cliff, we believe that a considerable amount of the information is purely fictional and/or grossly exaggerated when compared to the records of the actual event. Presentations will analyze the evolution of the representation of major figures in the Battle of Red Cliff, examining cultural and social changes represented by these changes...|$|R
