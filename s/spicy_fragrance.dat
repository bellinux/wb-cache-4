60|$|It {{was past}} six o'clock when Hilary at length reached home, preceded a little by Miranda, who almost felt within her {{the desire to}} eat. The lilac bushes, not yet in flower, were giving forth <b>spicy</b> <b>fragrance.</b> The sun still netted their top boughs, as with golden silk, and a blackbird, seated on a low branch of the acacia-tree, was {{summoning}} the evening. Mr. Stone, accompanied by the little model, dressed in her new clothes, was coming down the path. They were evidently going for a walk, for Mr. Stone wore his hat, old and soft and black, with a strong green tinge, and carried a paper parcel, which leaked crumbs of bread at every step.|$|E

Scarcely had Skipper, who had carried him up the steep ladder, dropped him on deck than Jerry made a new discovery--land. He did not see it, but he smelled it. His nose went {{up in the air and}} quested to windward along the wind that brought the message, and he read the air with his nose as a man might read a newspaper--the salt smells of the seashore and of the dank muck of mangrove swamps at low tide, the <b>spicy</b> <b>fragrances</b> of tropic vegetation, and the faint, most faint, acrid tingle of smoke from smudgy fires.|$|R

And, besides these, a miracle had happened in Old Man Shaw's garden. In one corner was a rose-bush which had never bloomed, despite all the coaxing they had given it--"the sulky rose-bush," [...] Sara had been wont to call it. Lo! this summer had flung the hoarded sweetness of years into plentiful white blossoms, like shallow ivory cups with a haunting, <b>spicy</b> <b>fragrance.</b> It was in honour of Sara's home-coming--so Old Man Shaw liked to fancy. All things, even the sulky rose-bush, knew she was coming back, and were making glad because of it.|$|E
60|$|In such circumstances, Hilda's gentle reserve {{must have}} been {{stronger}} than her kindly disposition permitted, if the friendship between Kenyon and herself had not grown as warm as a maiden's friendship can ever be, without absolutely and avowedly blooming into love. On the sculptor's side, the amaranthine flower was already in full blow. But it is very beautiful, though the lover's heart may grow chill at the perception, {{to see how the}} snow will sometimes linger in a virgin's breast, even after the spring is well advanced. In such alpine soils, the summer will not be anticipated; we seek vainly for passionate flowers, and blossoms of fervid hue and <b>spicy</b> <b>fragrance,</b> finding only snowdrops and sunless violets, when it is almost the full season for the crimson rose.|$|E
60|$|Hamilton Gaites sat breakfasting by {{the window}} of a {{restaurant}} looking out on Park Square, in Boston, at a table which he had chosen after rejecting one on the Boylston Street side of the place because it was too noisy, and another in the little open space, among evergreens in tubs, between the front and rear, because it was too chilly. The wind was east, but at his Park Square window it tempered the summer morning air without being a draught; and he poured out his coffee with a content in his circumstance and provision which he was apt to feel when he had taken all the possible pains, even though the result was not perfect. But now, he had real French bread, as good as he could have got in New York, and the coffee was clear and bright. A growth of crisp green watercress embowered a juicy steak, and in its shade, as it were, lay two long slices of bacon, not stupidly broiled to a crisp, but delicately pink, and exemplarily lean. Gaites had already had a cantaloupe, whose <b>spicy</b> <b>fragrance</b> lingered in the air and mingled with the robuster odors of the coffee, the steak, and the bacon.|$|E
50|$|Eugenia uniflora {{is a large}} shrub {{or small}} tree with a conical form, growing slowly to 8 meters in height.

5000|$|In October 2009, {{the formula}} for the {{transparent}} amber soap was altered from the original to become 'Gentle Care' and wrapped in an inner cellophane covering. The new soap was slightly softer in texture and lasted half as long, but its most noticeable difference was its scent. The aroma of the classic transparent amber bar, {{which used to be}} characterized by a mild, <b>spicy</b> herbal <b>fragrance,</b> had been altered to a stronger aromatic scent. The [...] "Hypoallergenic, non-comedogenic" [...] claim was dropped, and the 3-month aging process described on the original box does not appear on the box of the 'Gentle Care' formula.|$|R
5000|$|The Latin name Ferula derives in {{part from}} Ferule which is a schoolmaster's rod, such as a cane, stick, or flat piece of wood, used in {{punishing}} children. A ferula called narthex (or Giant fennel), which shares the galbanum-like scent, has long, straight and sturdy hollow stalks, which are segmented like bamboo. They were used as torches in antiquity and it is with such a torch that, according to Greek mythology, Prometheus, who deceived his father stealing some of his fire, brought fire to humanity. [...] Bacchae were described using the bamboo-like stalks as weapons.Such rods were also used for walking sticks, splints, for stirring boiling liquids, and for corporal punishment. Some of the mythology may have transferred to the related galbanum which {{was referred to as}} the sacred “mother resin.” Galbanum was highly treasured as a sacred substance by the ancient Egyptians. The “green” incense of Egyptian antiquity {{is believed to have been}} galbanum. Galbanum resin has a very intense green scent accompanied by a turpentine odor. The initial notes are a very bitter, acrid, and peculiar scent [...] followed by a complex green, <b>spicy,</b> woody, balsamlike <b>fragrance.</b> When diluted the scent of galbanum has variously been described as reminiscent of pine (due to the pinene and limonene content), evergreen, green bamboo, parsley, green apples, musk, or simply intense green. The oil has a pine like topnote which is less pronounced in the odor of the resinoid. The latter, in turn, has a more woody balsamic, conifer resinous character. Galbanum is frequently adulterated with pine oil.|$|R
60|$|When the stage-coach {{had gained}} {{the summit of}} the hill, I alighted to perform the small {{remainder}} of my journey on foot. There had not been a more delicious afternoon than this in all the train of summer, the air being a sunny perfume, made up of balm and warmth, and gentle brightness. The oak and walnut trees over my head retained their deep masses of foliage, and the grass, though for months the pasturage of stray cattle, had been revived with the freshness of early June by the autumnal rains of the preceding week. The garb of autumn, indeed, resembled that of spring. Dandelions and butterflies were sprinkled along the roadside like drops of brightest gold in greenest grass, and a star-shaped little flower of blue, with a golden centre. In a rocky spot, and rooted under the stone walk, there was one wild rose-bush bearing three roses very faintly tinted, but blessed with a <b>spicy</b> <b>fragrance.</b> The same tokens would have announced that the year was brightening into the glow of summer. There were violets too, though few and pale ones. But the breath of September was diffused through the mild air, and became perceptible, too thrillingly for my enfeebled frame, whenever a little breeze shook out the latent coolness.|$|E
60|$|So {{they turned}} at the store, much to the disgust of the plodding sorrel, {{who thought he was}} going {{directly}} home, and they soon reached the road that led through the woods. This was hard and sandy, as are many of the roads through the forests {{in that part of the}} country, and it would have been a very good driving road, had it not been for the occasional protrusion of tree roots, which gave the wheels a little bump, and for the branches which, now and then, hung down somewhat too low for the comfort of a lady and gentleman, riding in a rather high spring-wagon without a cover. But Lawrence drove slowly, and so the root bumps were not noticed; and when the low-hanging boughs were on his side, he lifted them so that his companion's head could pass under and, when they happened to be on her side, Annie ducked her head, and her hat was never brushed off. But, at times, they drove quite a distance without overhanging boughs, and the pine trees, surrounded by their smooth carpet of brown spines, gave forth a <b>spicy</b> <b>fragrance</b> in the warm, but sparkling air; the oak trees stood up still dark and green; while the chestnuts were all dressed in rich yellow, with the chinquepin bushes by the roadside imitating them in color, as they tried to do in fruit. Sometimes a spray of purple flowers could be seen among the trees, and great patches of sunlight which, here and there, came through the thinning foliage, fell, now upon the brilliantly scarlet leaves of a sweet-gum, and now upon the polished and brown-red dress of a neighboring black-gum.|$|E

40|$|Problem statement: The {{problem of}} the {{research}} derives {{from a lack of}} study and understanding about the production of condiment Isan food and ingredients being introduced into commercial, even though Isan food is popular among consumers widespread {{both inside and outside the}} country. The government introduced a policy to expand trade to create an export value of Isan products. The purpose of the research is to study the local wisdom in the field of the application of the ingredients used in Isan food. In addition, the purpose is to study about the problems of applying local wisdom to produce Isan food for consumption into commercial. Approach: The fields of study are Kalasin, Khon kaen, Maha Sarakham and Roi-Et. These are the places of Isan food local culture and original application of Isan food that have been producing to the present and also popular among the consumers widespread. There are 5 types of food that are chosen to be the proposition; Kaeng Wai (Curry Wai), Kai Yang (Roasting chicken), Tom Kai Ban (Boiled chicken), Mok Lab Pla Thong (Grilled Lab Pla Thong) and Om Pla (Fish soup) from 9 restaurants. Using Qualitative Research for data gathering from the concerning document, the data will be collected from fieldwork, survey, observation, interviews and focus group discussion from a group of totally 71 informants, presenting the result by using analytical descriptive. Results: The local wisdom of application of Isan food ingredients is a herb that is easy to find in the local area. It is used for the deodorizing of meat and as a garnish to give taste and flavor to the consumer. Isan food is highlighted as spicy and salty. A Spicy taste is from hot chili and dried chili. A Salty taste can be regarded as an important deliciousness that is an identity of Isan food from pickled fish and salt. A Sour test derives from tamarinds. Ya Nang (Tiliacora triandra) is used in order to reduce uric acid of Wai (Calamus caesius Blume). Adding ginger, Kha (Languas galangal) and Lemon Grass to the main ingredients in order to be <b>spicy</b> and increase <b>fragrance.</b> Instant ingredients are used to highlight the taste and fragrance to enhance the flavor. Moreover, all herbs and vegetables that are used are good for our health. Following the local wisdom for the production of condiment Isan food ingredient is the production of day by day by estimating the quantity of using per day and using in a day in order to be fresh. The product is prepared by washing with water and cutting unnecessary parts away, using an easy kitchen application for production. The problem of using the application of local wisdom for production of condiment Isan food ingredient is the lack of available product and it is quite expensive in some seasons. Problems are encountered with low quality products, rear of labor and long period of times to produce and keep the product. Applying the application of local wisdom for production of condiment Isan food ingredient into commercial, fresh product is chosen and washed with water and unnecessary parts are cut away by using simple kitchen application in order to prepare the product. A drying technique is used by using a heated air dryer, drum dryer and freeze dryer. The research attempts to find out the result of the test by using the senses of evaluation, smell, color and taste of the food. The packaging and ticketing of the product is also important to show the ingredients, condiment, proportion and guidance of how to store the product. Conclusion/Recommendation: Applying the application of local wisdom for production of condiment Isan food ingredient into commercial is the way of using basic local wisdom in order to apply and develop the product by integrating between original production and modern technology. Both two ways can control the temperature and moisture in order to gain the most resemble of the original product. In addition, it is easy to keep in some difficult seasons, saves time and natural resources; it is easy to cook and has the prospect of being developed into industry to import and export. It is the way to bring income into the country, including enabling Isan food and culture to be recognized worldwide...|$|R
