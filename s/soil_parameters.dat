40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{studies the}} NGI-ADP soil model, which can realistically {{simulate}} the anisotropic undrained stress strain responses and undrained shear strengths of clays. The model requires direct input parameters of undrained shear strengths and failure shear strains, including triaxial compression test, triaxial extension test and direct simple shear.

5000|$|The {{interception}} {{of precipitation}} {{from the atmosphere}} by the canopy is modeled using the Rutter Interception Model. The land surface evaporation and vegetation transpiration are computed separately using the Two Source Model of Shuttleworth and Gurney, {{which is based on}} the energy balance above canopy, within canopy and at soil surface. This model solves the non-linear equations based on the energy balance for the canopy, surface, and air temperatures at canopy height, evaporation from soil surface and transpiration from vegetation. A soil profile of three homogeneous layers (active, transmission and saturated layers) is used to model the soil moisture on the basis of water balance between layers. The active layer is 15-30 cm thick and it simulates the rapid changes of soil moisture content under high frequency atmospheric forcing. The transmission zone lies between the base of the active layer and the top of the capillary fringe and so it more characterizes the seasonal (instead of transient) changes of soil moisture. In modeling the unsaturated flow component of soil water, the water transport is assumed vertical and non-interactive between sub-basins. The lower boundary of the unsaturated zone is the top of capillary fringe controlled by the local average ground water table derived from the catchment average water table and topographic soil index which include the spatial variability of the topographic and <b>soil</b> <b>parameters.</b> Starting with an observed value from the surrounding wells of the modeled basin, the temporal changes in the average ground water depth is based on the water balance analysis for the whole catchment, and the rate of change of the average ground water table is assumed to be the rate of change of local water table.|$|E

For the successful application of these models, {{it is imperative that}} effective <b>soil</b> hydraulic <b>parameters</b> at the scale of model application are known. The majority of previous studies to define effective <b>soil</b> hydraulic <b>parameters</b> have considered only horizontal spatial variability of the parameters while neglecting textural layering at different spatial locations. In this paper, numerical experiments are conducted for seven vertical heterogeneous soil profiles (containing 4 - 5 soil layers) to generate different water balance components. Thereafter, information on evapotranspiration fluxes and water storage in the root zone profile is inversely used to identify effective <b>soil</b> hydraulic <b>parameters.</b> The aim is to assess whether effective <b>soil</b> hydraulic <b>parameters</b> can be assigned to vertically heterogeneous soil profiles. The performance of inversely identified <b>soil</b> hydraulic <b>parameters</b> is evaluated by their ability to reproduce the different components of water balance. Results showed that the evapotranspiration fluxes are sufficient to inversely identify <b>soil</b> hydraulic <b>parameters</b> for heterogeneous <b>soil</b> profiles under deep water table conditions and significant moisture stress. The identified <b>soil</b> hydraulic <b>parameters</b> are suitable to predict water balance components. However, appropriate formulation of soil evaporation simulation is very important if the surface soil layers have deviating soil hydraulic properties.

40|$|The {{use of a}} crop model like STICS for {{appropriate}} management decision support requires a good knowledge of all {{the parameters of the}} model. Among them, the <b>soil</b> <b>parameters</b> are difficult to know at each point of interest and costly techniques may be used to measure them. It is therefore important to know which <b>soil</b> <b>parameters</b> need to be determined. It can be stated that those which affect significantly the output variable deserve an accurate determination while those which slightly affect the model output variable do not. This paper demonstrates how a global sensitivity analysis method based on variance decomposition can be applied on <b>soil</b> <b>parameters</b> in order to divide them in the two categories. The Extended FAST method applied to the crop model STICS and a set of 13 <b>soil</b> <b>parameters</b> first allows to calculate the part of variance explained by each soil parameter (giving global sensitivity indices of the <b>soil</b> <b>parameters)</b> and the coefficient of variation of the output variables (measuring the effect of the parameter uncertainty on each variable). These metrics are therefore used for deciding on the importance of the parameter value measurement. Different output variables (Leaf Area Index and chlorophyll content) are evaluated at different stages of interest while others (crop yield, grain protein content, soil mineral nitrogen) are evaluated at harvest. The analysis is applied on two different annual crops (wheat and sugar beet), two contrasted weather and two types of soil depth. When the uncertainty of the output generated by the <b>soil</b> <b>parameters</b> is large (coefficient of variation > 1 / 3), only the parameters having a significant global sensitivity indices (higher than 10 %) are retained.

The land surface between longitudes - 180 o W and + 180 o E and latitudes + 90 o N and - 90 o S has been characterized using 45948 unique map units; each of these can comprise from one to ten soil units, characterized according to the original legend of the 1 : 5 million scale Soil Map of the World (FAO-Unesco 1974). <b>Soil</b> <b>parameter</b> estimates for each of these units were derived from analyses of some 9600 profiles held in a working copy of WISE (ver. 2. 0).

Here a scale-dependent (top-down) parameter estimation (inverse modeling) scheme called the noisy Monte Carlo genetic algorithm (NMCGA) was developed and tested for estimating these effective <b>soil</b> hydraulic <b>parameters</b> and their uncertainties. We tested our method using three case studies involving a synthetic pixel (pure and mixed) where all modeling conditions are known, and with actual airborne remote sensing (RS) footprints and a satellite RS footprint. In the synthetic case studies under pure (one soil texture) and mixed-pixel (multiple soil textures) conditions, NMCGA performed well in estimating the effective <b>soil</b> hydraulic <b>parameters</b> even with pixel complexities contributed by various soil types and land management practices (rain-fed/irrigated). With the airborne and satellite remote sensing cases, NMCGA also performed well for estimating effective soil hydraulic properties so that when applied in forward stochastic simulation modeling it can mimic large-scale soil moisture dynamics. The results also suggest a possible scaling down of the effective soil water retention curve (h) at the larger satellite remote sensing pixel compared with the airborne remote sensing pixel. However, it did not generally imply that all effective <b>soil</b> hydraulic <b>parameters</b> should scale down like the soil water retention curve. The reduction of the <b>soil</b> hydraulic <b>parameters</b> was most profound in the saturated soil moisture content (sat) as we relaxed progressively the <b>soil</b> hydraulic <b>parameter</b> search spaces in our satellite remote sensing studies.
