30|$|A {{comparison}} of the geomagnetic H field data at Ancon, Peru and Buriticupa, Brazil for the period December 1990 and January 1991 revealed {{the presence of a}} significant correlation in day-to-day variability in the solar daily variation of H at the two stations, which are separated by about 2000 km. It is suggested that the day-to-day variability in the time {{as well as in the}} magnitude of the daily peak of the H field at an equatorial electrojet station is due to the superimposition of a <b>semi-diurnal</b> <b>wave</b> of the electric field over the normal mean daily variation.|$|E
40|$|Dial {{variations}} of important hydrographic parameters were studied continuously for 7 {{days at a}} 100 m depth station off Cochin. The frequency of observations varied from 1 - 3 hourly intervals. In surface waters, the ranges in temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen values recorded during 10 - 17 April were 30. 64 °- 32. 36 °C, 34. 56 - 34. 68 X lO"' and 4. 06 - 4. 65 ml/ 1 respectively. Tlie STD profiles in the diurnal study revealed clearly the premonsoon warming (30 °- 31 °C) in the upper 0 - 30 m depth zone. In the water column up to 50 m depth, mean salinity values ranged from 34. 6 to 35 X 10 while dissolved oxygen values were above 4 mI/ 1. Time series observations on the production and utilisation of dissolved oxygen revealed wide fluctuation from hour to hour. Vertical gradients in the diurnal study indicated the existence of thermocline around 60 m depth with sharp decline in temperature and dissolved oxygen and increase in salinity below 60 m. The diurnal variation {{on the distribution of}} temperature and dissolved oxygen exhibited significant rhythmic tidal impulse of a <b>semi-diurnal</b> <b>wave</b> pattern which was more prominent in the bottom layer below 60 m...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1964 Presentation date: 1963 - 11 - 08 The {{extent and}} {{mechanism}} of energy dissipation {{has been studied}} in Coos Bay, a coastal plain estuary. Coos Bay {{is located on the}} central Oregon coast, 184 nautical miles south of Astoria, Oregon, and 35 nautical miles north of Cape Blanco. Past field work in Coos Bay and data obtained for this study are presented and summarized. These investigations include temperature, salinity, and current measurements, as well as tidal observations. The circulation patterns observed in Coos Bay throughout the year have been analyzed, and Coos Bay has been classified as a well-mixed coastal plain estuary. The dynamics of the estuarine system have been investigated, and integrals of the equations of motion and continuity have been evaluated to show the magnitude of advection and diffusion in the estuary. The tide in Coos Bay {{has been shown to be}} a damped <b>semi-diurnal</b> <b>wave.</b> Energy flow in the estuary has been followed from the energy source in the tides, through stages of turbulence, to final dissipation by viscosity into heat. The energy required to provide the observed mixing and increase of potential energy in the estuary has been observed and measured and compared with the source energy and energy lost through viscous dissipation. A dissipation constant of 2. 5 has been calculated for the incoming tidal wave as an index of the mean rate at which energy is extracted from the tidal motion into turbulent motion. The turbulent energy distribution has been represented as a function of eddy size. The turbulent energy spectrum has been obtained in Coos Bay from observed tidal velocities. The amounts of energy involved in mixing and turbulent dissipation have been compared with each other and with the rate of tidal energy dissipation and viscous dissipation. Most of the tidal energy is lost directly into heat. The dissipation rate in Coos Bay was measured at 10 ^- 4 watts per kilogram. This value compares well with values determined by other investigators...|$|E
40|$|Using the {{experimental}} {{data of the}} high counting rate neutron and meson monitors, the solar tri-diurnal anisotropy of galactic cosmic radiation has been investigated for the period 19622 ̆ 01379. The enhancement of the average tri-diurnal amplitude observed by all the detectors during 19732 ̆ 01375 provides sufficient {{signal to noise ratio}} to obtain its variational characteristics. The observations are consistent with an interplanetary anisotropy having a power law rigidity spectrum exponent 2 ̆ 248 1. The tri-diurnal amplitude varies as cos 3 3 ̆bb, where 3 ̆bb is the effective asymptotic latitude of the detector. The annual average tri-diurnal amplitude shows a significant positive correlation with the semi-diurnal amplitude for the period 19682 ̆ 01379. The correlation, however, is poor for the earlier period 19622 ̆ 01367, which {{may be due to the}} presence of significant modulation of semi-diurnal anisotropy with periods of 22 -year sunspot magnetic cycle. An analysis using groups of days with high and low solar wind speed shows greater amplitude of both the tri-diurnal and <b>semi-diurnal</b> <b>waves</b> for the group of days with high wind speed. This result coupled with the observation of a factor of 2 increase in both amplitudes during 19732 ̆ 01375, a period when high speed solar wind streams were prevalent, suggests that solar polar coronal holes may influence both the solar tri-diurnal and semi-diurnal variation of galactic cosmic ray intensity.

40|$|The {{phase of}} semi-diurnal tides (M 2 and S 2) propagates {{clockwise}} {{in the central}} part of the Gulf of Thailand, although that of the diurnal tides (K 1, O 1 and P 1) is counterclock-wise. The mechanism of clockwise phase propagation of semi-diurnal tides at the Gulf of Thailand in the northern hemisphere is examined using a simple numerical model. The natural oscillation period of the whole Gulf of Thailand is near the semi-diurnal period and the direction of its phase propagation is clockwise, mainly due to the propagation direction of the large amplitude part of the incoming <b>semi-diurnal</b> tidal <b>wave</b> from the South China Sea.

40|$|International audienceBarometric tides {{around the}} Pyrenees {{mountain}} range are analyzed {{by means of}} synoptic surface-station data recorded during one year, surface data from the Pyrenees Experiment (PYREX) and the CRA/LA Very High Frequency (VHF) wind profiler installed {{in the north of}} the range. Tides are decomposed into their diurnal and semi-diurnal components. Diurnal tides show a strong non-migrating component and are very dependent on local conditions. Semi-diurnal tides are more homogeneous and present a north-south asymmetry, also noted in the Alps. This cross-range asymmetry could be related to some interference effect caused by the mountain range in the migrating <b>semi-diurnal</b> tide <b>wave.</b> The asymmetry of the diurnal component presents a very strong seasonal variation, probably related to local diabatic effects. A three-month long simulation has been carried out with the National Center for Atmospheric Research's Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) limited-area model to try to reproduce the tide structure. The validation of the results with wind-profiler data shows reasonable agreement with the observed diurnal tide and poorer results for the semi-diurnal component. At surface level, however, the model reproduces some of the features of the observed semi-diurnal tide, and especially the cross-range asymmetry. Copyright © 2010 Royal Meteorological Societ...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} known since many decades that lunar tide has an {{influence}} on the strength of the equatorial electrojet (EEJ). There has, however, never been a comprehensive study of the tidal effect on a global scale. Based on the continuous magnetic field measurements by the CHAMP satellite over 10 years it is possible to investigate the various aspects of lunar effects on the EEJ. The EEJ intensity is enhanced around times when the moon is overhead or at the antipode. This effect is particularly strong around noon, shortly after new and full moon. The lunar tide manifests itself as a <b>semi-diurnal</b> <b>wave</b> that precesses through all local times within one lunar month. The largest tidal amplitudes are observed around December solstice and smallest around June solstice. The tidal wave crest lags behind the moon phase. During December this amounts to about 4 days while it is around 2 days during other times of the year. We have not found significant longitudinal variations of the lunar influence on the EEJ. When comparing the average EEJ amplitude at high solar activity with that during periods of solar minimum conditions a solar cycle dependence can be found, but the ratio between tidal amplitude and EEJ intensity stays the same. Actually, tidal signatures standout clearer during times of low solar activity. We suggest that the tidal variations are caused by a current system added to the EEJ rather than by modulating the EEJ. Gravitational forcing of the lower atmosphere by the moon and the sun is assumed to be the driver of an upward propagating tidal wave. The larger tidal amplitudes around December solstice can be related to stratospheric warming events which seem to improve the conditions for upward propagation. The results described here have to large extent been presented as a Julius-Bartels Medal Lecture during the General Assembly 2011 of the European Geosciences Union...|$|E
40|$|The {{response}} {{of the land and}} sea breeze circulation to two highly simplified dynamical models is presented. The first dynamical model is the explicit specification of an oscillating interior heat source analogous to that from Rotunno (1983). Emphasis is placed on the variation of the response with heating amplitude and latitude. In addition, a weakly nonlinear analysis focuses on the dynamic forcing of nonlinear features such as a <b>semi-diurnal</b> gravity <b>wave,</b> fronts, and asymmetry in the magnitude of onshore and offshore flow. One surprising result is the identification of a cycle-mean surface divergence pattern at both 0 ? and 45 ?. At 45 ?, this divergence pattern is accompanied by a cycle mean shore-parallel response due to the Earth's rotation. The second dynamical model is the explicit specification of an oscillating surface heat flux. Again, comparison is made between simulations at different heating amplitudes, and between simulations at different latitudes. To address changes in the solution due to the heating method itself, comparison is made between solutions from the surface heating method and solutions from the interior heating method. Finally, solutions across the planetary continuum are explored for critical latitude dependence in high-amplitude simulations...|$|R
40|$|An Isopycnic Coordinate Ocean Model {{is used to}} {{represent}} the three-dimensional propagation of internal tides in the Bay of Biscay. The model is forced by the <b>semi-diurnal</b> tidal <b>waves</b> M 2, S 2, N 2 and K 2. A high resolution topography of French and Iberian continental slopes preserves {{the shape of the}} main canyons, which are areas of internal tide generation. Hydrological and velocity data collected during a French Naval experiment in 1994 are compared with the model results. Near the generation area, the vertical distribution of the internal tide amplitude, associated with a vertical shear of baroclinic tidal currents, is in agreement with the observations. Moreover, at most locations, the increase in the baroclinic current modelled near the bottom depth matches the data. This increase is related to the distribution of the internal tide amplitude along the ray slope defined by c(z) = (w 2 -f 2 /N where w is the tidal frequency, f the Coriolis parameter and N(z) the buoyancy frequency. In most of the data/model comparisons, the vertical density variation in the deep layers shows a difference in phase in agreement with the ray theory. Over the abyssal plain, high horizontal shears of surface current are modelled at mid-bay, i. e. in areas where the internal wave energy coming from the deep ocean encounters the seasonal thermocline. However, the location of these areas is very sensitive to the initial vertical density profile: the three-dimensional variation of the density must be introduced in the initial conditions to improve the model results...|$|R
40|$|Effective {{simulation}} of diurnal variability {{is an important}} aspect of many geophysical data assimilation systems. For the Martian atmosphere, thermal tides are particularly prominent and contribute much to the Martian atmospheric circulation, dynamics and dust transport. To study the Mars diurnal variability and Mars thermal tides, the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Mars Global Climate Model with the 4 D-local ensemble transform Kalman filter (4 D-LETKF) is used to perform an analysis assimilating spacecraft temperature retrievals. We find that the use of a ‘traditional’ 6 -hr assimilation cycle induces spurious forcing of a resonantly enhanced <b>semi-diurnal</b> Kelvin <b>waves</b> represented in both surface pressure and mid-level temperature by forming a wave 4 pattern in the diurnal averaged analysis increment that acts as a ‘topographic’ stationary forcing. Different assimilation window lengths in the 4 D-LETKF are introduced to remove the artificially induced resonance. It is found that short assimilation window lengths not only remove the spurious resonance, but also push the migrating semi-diurnal temperature variation at 50 Pa closer to the estimated ‘true’ tides {{even in the absence of}} a radiatively active water ice cloud parameterisation. In order to compare the performance of different assimilation window lengths, short-term to mid-range forecasts based on the hour 00 and 12 assimilation are evaluated and compared. Results show that during Northern Hemisphere summer, it is not the assimilation window length, but the radiatively active water ice clouds that influence the model prediction. A ‘diurnal bias correction’ that includes bias correction fields dependent on the local time is shown to effectively reduce the forecast root mean square differences between forecasts and observations, compensate for the absence of water ice cloud parameterisation and enhance Martian atmosphere prediction. The implications of these results for data assimilation in the Earth's atmosphere are discussed...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent decades}} major water {{developments}} {{have led to}} an agricultural transformation of the Senegal delta both in Senegal and Mauritania. This otherwise, semi-arid region of the Sahel band now has an abundant supply of freshwater all year round mostly used for irrigation and urban water supply, including for the capital cities of the two countries. Archives from the Landsat satellites and in-situ hydrographs were used in this paper to retrace and analyse the hydrological changes {{that have taken place}} in the region since the middle of the 20 th century. The satellite archives indicate that the area covered by irrigation increased by one order of magnitude from 73 km(2) in 1973 to similar to 770 km(2) in 2010. The observed hydrological changes are complex, multi-faceted and often of great magnitude. If the water cycle was representative of natural conditions in the early 1980 s, it is now representative of a heavily modified system controlled and impacted by human activities. The first hydraulic infrastructure was installed in 1947 to enable the Lake of Guiers to become the main water supply for Dakar. Two large dams were built on the Senegal River in the mid- 1980 s that modified the hydrological regime of the river by 1) preventing seawater intrusion, 2) raising the stage of the river and-of Lake of Guiers and 3) moderating floods. Another recent hydrological change in the delta was the opening of river mouth in 2003, which has led to a reduction of the average water level while increasing the <b>semi-diurnal</b> tidal <b>wave</b> between the river mouth and Diama. Each phase of these river regime changes and each step of the irrigation expansion are expressed in localised changes in the physical groundwater system. Increasingly, the retroaction from the shallow aquifer systems is observed as a rise of the saline water table. This poses a threat to the environmental and agricultural value of the region, and the salinization of the soils. Mitigating actions for this threat are currently being envisaged by the authorities...|$|R

In situ wind measurements near the equator {{are described in}} the central Atlantic during the Global Weather Experiment in 1979. There are two data sets: a year-long record from St. Peter and St. Paul Rocks (29 °W) and several records from surface buoys along 22 °W during the ftrst half of the year. In general, the data are found to agree with historical means for their respective areas and reproduce the expected trends in both space and time. Wind speed autospectra reproduce the slopes of other marine observations at very different sites and indicate enhanced variance at high frequencies (<b>semi-diurnal</b> to inertia-gravity <b>waves).</b> Spatial coherence at lower frequency (10 - 20 days) between the two locations is not consistently observed and at 4 - 6 days appears during one time period but not another.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the breeding method in determining growth and decay characteristics of certain solutions to the Kortweg-de Vries (KdV) equation and the Nonlinear Schrödinger equation is investigated. Bred vectors are a finite amplitude, finite time generalization of Leading Lyapunov Vectors (LLV), and breeding {{has been used to}} predict large impending fluctuations in many systems, including chaotic systems. Here, the focus is on predicting fluctuations associated with extreme waves. The bred vector analysis is applied to the KdV equation with two types of initial conditions: soliton collisions, and a Gaussian distribution which decays into a group of solitons. The soliton solutions are stable, and the breeding analysis enables tracking of the growth and decay during the interactions. Furthermore, this study with a known stable system helps validate the use of breeding method for waves. This analysis is also applied to characterize rogue wave type solutions of the NLSE, which have been used to describe extreme ocean waves. In the results obtained, the growth rate maxima and the peaks of the bred vector always precede the rogue wave peaks. This suggests that the growth rate and bred vectors may serve as precursors for predicting energy localization due to rogue waves. Finally, the results reveal that the breeding method can be used to identify numerical instabilities. Effective simulation of diurnal variability is an important aspect of many geophysical data assimilation systems. For the Martian atmosphere, thermal tides are particularly prominent and contribute much to the Martian atmospheric circulation, dynamics and dust transport. To study the Mars diurnal variability (or thermal tides), the GFDL Mars Global Climate Model (MGCM) with the 4 D-Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter (4 D-LETKF) is used to perform a reanalysis of spacecraft temperature retrievals. We find that the use of a "traditional" 6 -hr assimilation cycle induces spurious forcing of a resonantly-enhanced <b>semi-diurnal</b> Kelvin <b>waves</b> represented in both surface pressure and mid-level temperature by forming a wave 4 pattern in the diurnal averaged analysis increment that acts as a "topographic" stationary forcing.

Results show that during NH summer, it is not the assimilation window length, but the radiatively active water ice cloud that influences the model prediction. A "diurnal bias correction" that includes bias correction fields dependent on the local time is shown to effectively reduce the forecast root mean square differences (RMSD) between forecasts and observations, compensate for the absence of water ice cloud parameterization, and enhance Martian atmosphere prediction.

40|$|The winter watermass {{properties}} and circulation of the Gulf of St. Lawrence and St. Lawrence Estuary are examined {{using a combination}} of new wintertime observations and numerical modelling. Ten moorings were deployed over the winter 2002 / 3, providing the first continuous observations of the upper 200 m of the water column in winter. A harmonic analysis of current data in the estuary confirms the existence of a <b>semi-diurnal</b> internal Poincare <b>wave.</b> The analysis also provides strong evidence of a neap-tide intensification of the estuarine circulation. The cold intermediate layer (CIL) in the estuary is seen to be renewed abruptly in late March, with the advection of a wedge of near-freezing water from the gulf. An eddy-permitting sea ice-ocean model is used with the observations to quantify the formation and circulation of the CIL. As a first step, a two-equation second moment turbulence closure parameterization is implemented to better account for vertical mixing processes. The model sensitivity to this parameterization is tested and differences of several salinity units are found in the surface layer throughout the southern half of the gulf. The model reproduces the strong spring renewal event of the CIL into the estuary, and helps to explain the role of local dynamics, including the coupled circulation in the northwest gulf, in controlling the exchange processes at depth. The model results suggest the existence of a separated Gaspe Current that persists for more than a month. A significant correlation is found between the inflow through the Strait of Belle Isle and outflow through Cabot Strait. In order to isolate the effects of this inflow on the CIL heat content, we examine a sensitivity experiment in which the Strait of Belle Isle is closed. This simulation shows that the inflow has a relatively small effect on the total CIL heat budget. With the Strait of Belle Isle closed, the outflow of CIL through Cabot Strait is reduced by 61 %. It is estimated that only 64 % of CIL inflow through the Strait of Belle Isle in fall and winter contributes directly to the heat content of CIL present in the gulf...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe energy {{transfers}} {{associated with}} internal tide (IT) generation by a <b>semi-diurnal</b> surface tidal <b>wave</b> impinging on a supercritical meridionally uniform deep ocean ridge on the f -plane, and subsequent IT-propagation are analysed using the Boussinesq, free-surface, terrain-following ocean model Symphonie. The energy diagnostics are explicitly {{based on the}} numerical formulation of the governing equations, permitting a globally conservative, high-precision analysis of all physical and numerical/artificial energy transfers in a sub-domain with open lateral boundaries. The net primary energy balances are quantified using a moving average of length two tidal periods in a simplified control simulation using a single time-step, minimal diffusion, and a no-slip sea floor. This provides the basis for analysis of enhanced vertical and horizontal diffusion and a free-slip bottom boundary condition. After a four tidal period spin-up, the tidally averaged (net) primary energy balance in the generation region, extending ± 20 km from the ridge crest, shows that the surface tidal wave loses approximately C = 720 W/m or 0. 3 % of the mean surface tidal energy flux (2. 506 × 105 W/m) in traversing the ridge. This corresponds mainly to the barotropic-to-baroclinic energy conversion due to stratified flow interaction with sloping topography. Combined with a normalised net advective flux of baroclinic potential energy of 0. 9 × C this causes a net local baroclinic potential energy gain of 0. 72 × C and a conversion into baroclinic kinetic energy through the baroclinic buoyancy term of 1. 18 × C. Tidally averaged, about 1. 14 × C is radiated into the abyssal ocean through the total baroclinic flux of internal pressure associated with the IT- and background density field. This total baroclinic pressure flux is therefore not only determined by the classic linear surface-to-internal tide conversion, {{but also by the}} net advection of baroclinic (background) potential energy, indicating the importance of local processes other than linear IT-motion. In the propagation region (PR), integrated over the areas between 20 and 40 km from the ridge crest, the barotropic and baroclinic tide are decoupled. The net incoming total baroclinic pressure flux is balanced by local potential energy gain and outward baroclinic flux of potential energy associated with the total baroclinic density. The primary net energy balances are robust to changes in the vertical diffusion coefficient, whereas relatively weak horizontal diffusion significantly reduces the outward IT energy flux. Diapycnal mixing due to vertical diffusion causes an available potential energy loss of about 1 % of the total domain-averaged potential energy gain, which matches View the MathML sourcekm- 1 kmρ 0 KVN 2 to within 0. 5 %, for km linearly distributed grid-levels and constant background density ρ 0, vertical diffusivity (KV) and buoyancy frequency (N) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{area around}} Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) faces {{flooding}} and salt intrusion problems. Flooding problems {{are caused by}} intensive rainfall in the city, high river discharges and high tides on sea. Dr. Hoc, the vice-minister of MARD (Vietnamese Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development) proposed to construct a hydraulic structure downstream of HCMC. This will solve both the flooding and siltation problem. A possibility is to construct a dam between Vung Tau and Go Cong. This solution has been worked out into a preliminary design, which includes a design for the cross section and {{an investigation into the}} closure method. The hydraulic system where the project will be constructed consists of the Saigon - Dong Nai river system and the East Sea, and can be classified as an estuary with a (mainly <b>semi-diurnal)</b> mixed tide. <b>Waves</b> are moderate in the area. A dam will be constructed between Go Cong and the Dong Nai navigation channel. Over the Dong-Nai navigation channel to Vung Tau a bridge is planned, to minimise navigation delays and changes in tidal and salinity range in the Can Gio mangrove forest. To make a closed basin, Can Thanh will be connected with the dam near the Dong Nai navigation channel. Ship locks and discharge sluices will be constructed at the sides of the existing navigation channel in the Soi Rap. The final closure of the dam will take place in the Soi Rap navigation channel. A road on the dam will connect Vung Tau with Go Cong. Because there is no subsoil information available at the location of the dam, the soil layering and parameters are estimated based on information from locations {{in the vicinity of the}} dam. Three different soil profiles were drawn up. Measures have to be taken to increase the bearing capacity of the subsoil and decrease settlements during the lifetime of the dam. If thick layers of weak subsoil is present, drainage in combination with pre-loading will be the best solution. In case of a stronger subsoil partial replacement with sand is favourable. To build the dam, the use of local material is a cheap and easy solution. Near Vung Tau a number of areas are present where sand can be obtained. Rock can be found in mountains in the neighbourhood of Vung Tau. Since there is already a stone quarry in this area, it is assumed that the rock is of good quality. By means of a Multi Criteria Analysis it was found that a building a dam with a sand core is the best solution in this project. Degradation or even failure of (elements of) the structure may occur as a result of loadings during the operational phase or in accidental situations. The principal failure mechanisms for the VT-GC dam are checked. Slope, crest and toe protections were designed to prevent failure. Two designs were made for the cross section of the dam: one with an outer slope revetment made of asphalt and one for an outer slope revetment made of rock. The biggest differences in these designs can be found in the crest height and layer thicknesses. The construction of the dam should start with the construction of the bridge and work islands. Next, the discharge sluices and navigation locks will be made in building pits. Then the dam will be constructed. This starts with the foundation and scour protection which will be constructed using barges. Waterborne equipment is preferred because of the easier logistics and larger capacities. The core material, filter layers, underlayer, toe and armour layer will be constructed layer by layer to be able to raise the relatively steep slopes. Where water depths are too low, cranes operating from pontoons or rolling equipment can be used. After completion of the core and revetment, the crest is constructed and the dam can be finished with the construction of the road. The closure of the final gap is a very important aspect within the construction of the dam. A storage area approach is used to determine the system behaviour during closure. High velocities in the final gap make it impossible to close the gap with sand. A bottom protection is necessary in the final gap to prevent a scour hole, caused by high velocities, from developing too close to the dam. The gap is closed with coarser material than sand. A combination of vertical and horizontal closure will be used. First barges dump stones to a level of MSL - 5 m. When the water is too shallow, dumping will continue from the sides of the closure gap. The final dam profile in the closure gap will be similar to the regular dam sections. A general estimation of the cost for the total project, based on costs in reference projects, is 3. 1 billion US dollar. The Dong Thap Muoi region is a very important agricultural area for the production of rice. Due to the low river discharges and the large influence of the tide, the salt concentrations in the Vam Co rivers are high, causing problems for the farmers. An estimation of the salt intrusion length was made using a predictive steady-state salt intrusion model, according to Savenije. Unfortunately it was not possible to perform salinity measurements in the Vam Co River, so data from three fixed measurement stations was used. With this data, it was possible to fit the model roughly but more data is needed to make the model more accurate. Student report for a Master Project.
