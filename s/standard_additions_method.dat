40|$|Abstract: The {{ability of}} the <b>standard</b> <b>addition</b> <b>method</b> to correct for {{interference}} was evaluated by analyzing Tylenol and Migraine tablets for acetaminophen. These formulations are ideal for <b>standard</b> <b>addition</b> <b>method</b> study because they provide varying degrees of interference. For Tylenol tablets, the spectrum of diphenhydramine interferes with that of acetaminophen around 200 to 235 nm while there is minimum interference between 235 to 260 nm. In Migraine tablets (acetaminophen, aspirin, caffeine), all the active ingredients overlap strongly with the spectrum of acetaminophen. The two extremes {{provide a basis for}} observing the performance of the <b>standard</b> <b>addition</b> <b>method</b> versus the external standard method. A BioCary 100 UV/Vis spectrophotometer was used to obtain absorbance spectra of tablets dissolved in 20 % aqueous ethanol in the 200 to 310 nm range. A Dionex high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC/UV) was used to provide reference results. For Tylenol analysis, the <b>standard</b> <b>addition</b> <b>method</b> gave 2. 6 % relative error under conditions where the external standard method gave 10 % relative error for acetaminophen.

40|$|Given the {{extensive}} presence of some toxic {{quaternary ammonium compound}} residues in foodstuffs arriving into the EU during 2012, the Food Authority Control of Geneva decided to implement a monitoring plan to investigate {{the presence of these}} contaminants in food: a method based on quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS) extraction and liquid chromatography electrospray tandem mass spectrometry was developed for analyzing didecyldimethylammonium chloride and four benzalkonium chloride homologue residues in fruits and vegetables. An in-house method validation, based on the SANCO guidelines (Document SANCO No. 12571 / 2013), was conducted using three independent series in orange, lettuce, and avocado composite samples spiked at three levels (10, 100, 500 μg/kg). Trueness and precision were calculated by pooling all results at each concentration level to account for the variability among fruits and vegetables. To avoidmatrix effects on quantitative results, five quantification strategies were investigated: (i) solvent calibration, (ii) matrix-matched calibration prepared on samples and (iii) on sample extract aliquots, and (iv) <b>standard</b> <b>addition</b> prepared on samples and (v) on sample extract aliquots. Due to the nonlinear instrumental response for the large concentration range investigated, a quadratic calibration model was mandatory for all approaches. Solvent calibration gave very poor recoveries due to the high signal suppression caused by matrix effects. Smaller biases were observed for matrix-matched calibrations; however, these results exhibited relatively low precision. Both of the <b>standard</b> <b>addition</b> <b>methods</b> compensated for matrix effects and provided accurate analytical results.
