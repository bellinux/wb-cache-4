It is due to a summer-to-winter circulation giving rise to upwelling at the <b>summer</b> <b>pole</b> and downwelling at the winter pole. Air rising will expand and cool resulting in a cold summer mesopause and conversely downwelling air results in compression and associated increase in temperature at the winter mesopause. In the mesosphere the summer-to-winter circulation is due to gravity wave dissipation, which deposits momentum against the mean east-west flow, resulting in a small north-south circulation.|$|E

A comparison of summer observations at 69 ° N and 79 ° N shows that mesospheric turbulence weakens towards the <b>summer</b> <b>pole.</b> Furthermore, {{these data suggest that}} at both latitudes in about ~ 70 % of all samples there are non-turbulent altitude bins in the considered altitude range between 70 and 95 km. The remaining 30 % with detectable turbulence show an approximately log-normal distribution of dissipation rates. A low-resolution model version with a gravity wave (GW) parameterization explains the observed latitude dependence as a consequence of a downshift of the breaking levels towards the <b>summer</b> <b>pole</b> and an accompanying decay of turbulent heating per unit mass. When we do not use a GW parameterization but employ a high spatial resolution instead to simulate GW effects explicitly, the model predicts a similar latitudinal dependence with weakening turbulence towards the <b>summer</b> <b>pole.</b> In addition, the model also produces a log-normal distribution of dissipation rates. The simulated probability distribution is more narrow than in the observations since the model resolves at most mid-frequency GWs, whereas real turbulence is also excited by smaller-scale disturbances. The GW resolving simulation suggests a weaker tropospheric GW source at polar latitudes as the dominating mechanism for the latitudinal dependence...|$|E

30|$|New {{modeling}} {{studies using}} the Whole Atmospheric Community Climate Model (WACCM) (Smith et al. [2010]) indicate {{a significant role}} {{of the development of}} the Antarctic stratospheric ozone hole in long-term trends in the MLTI region. Dramatic ozone loss in the lower stratosphere results in a temperature decrease in the polar lower stratosphere and a change in the zonal wind distribution. Smith et al. (2011) showed that this change modifies gravity wave propagation into the mesosphere during late spring so that the mesospheric residual mean circulation is weakened by the gravity wave drag. This leads to a reduction in polar ascent rates and thus anomalous adiabatic heating and more than a 4 K increase in temperature at 80 km between 1960 and 2006 over the <b>summer</b> <b>pole,</b> and a 6 K cooling above that level. In contrast, little change was seen over the <b>summer</b> <b>pole</b> in the Northern Hemisphere. The mesospheric warming over the Antarctic was not present in a simulation in which ODS concentrations were kept constant at pre-ozone-hole levels. This influence of the ozone hole in changing wave propagation into the MLTI was later confirmed in simulations using the Canadian Middle Atmosphere Model (CMAM) (Lossow et al. [2012]), although their effect was less pronounced in December in CMAM than WACCM, likely due to too delayed breakup of the polar vortex in WACCM.|$|E

40|$|The quasi 2 -day wave (Q 2 DW) is a {{persistent}} {{feature of the}} mesosphere. It has a period of approximately 2 days, and is dominated by zonal wavenumber 3. Its ampli-tude is largest shortly after solstice in the summer hemisphere, when it undergoes rapid growth due to baroclinic instability of the summer mesospheric jet. The region of baroclinic instability is formed by a torque that is generated by gravity waves that propagate from the troposphere to the mesosphere. The same GWD is also responsible for producing a pole-to-pole circulation charac-terized by upwelling over the <b>summer</b> <b>pole,</b> downwelling over the winter pole, and a summer-to-winter circulation across the equator. This residual circulation can {{be affected by the}} presence of the Q 2 DW (Lieberman 1999).

40|$|The first {{detection}} in {{the atmosphere}} of Mars of the night side O 2 (a 1 Δg) emission at 1. 27 mm from limb observations of the OMEGA imaging spectrometer on board Mars Express was reported earlier (Bertaux et al., JGR, 2012). The emission, detected in 3 cases out of 40 observations is due to recombination in a downwelling air parcel of O atoms produced by photodissociation of CO 2 on the dayside in the upper atmosphere (O+O+M® O 2 *+M), and not from ozone UV photodissociation, as is often seen on the day side. This emission was also detected with SPICAM/MEX. It {{is similar to the}} strong O 2 Venus nightglow, which traces the transport of thermospheric air from the day side to the night side. However, in the case of Mars, it traces a meridional transport from the <b>summer</b> <b>pole</b> to the winter pole, along a single Hadley's cell, similar to the terrestrial case. This can be explained in the frame of a general circulation model (GCM) of Mars. As predicted by the GCM, all positive observations were obtained at high latitudes, during the winter night or near the equinox. An interesting feature of the model is that it predicts that near both equinoxes, this emission may happen simultaneously at both pole regions, showing that the circulation is then characterized by two Hadley's cells, ascending at equator and downwelling at both poles. The search for such a situation in Mars Express data will be reported. The model is validated, which simulates the large Hadley cell characterizing the meridional circulation, ascending from the <b>summer</b> <b>pole</b> and descending to the winter pole.

30|$|Large wave amplitudes lead to wave {{breaking}} and hence momentum deposition. This, in turn, produces body forces that drive large scale residual circulations. In the winter stratosphere (approximately 20 to 60 km), planetary wave breaking drives a residual circulation from the equator to the winter pole, {{while in the}} mesosphere, gravity wave {{breaking and}} dissipation drives a circulation from the <b>summer</b> to winter <b>pole</b> (e.g. see Andrews et al. 1987). The combined effects of these large-scale circulation patterns, usually {{referred to as the}} Brewer-Dobson circulation, can be profound. For example, the pole-to-pole circulation at the mesopause (approximately 85 to 90 km) leads to rising (descending) motions over the <b>summer</b> (winter) <b>pole</b> with associated adiabatic cooling (heating). These vertical motions produce temperatures that are more than 50 K cooler or warmer than would be expected by radiative equilibrium alone. In fact the summer polar mesopause is the coldest place in the Earth’s environment with temperatures of 120 K or lower. Temperatures below about 130 K are sufficient for ice particles to form, leading to a phenomena such as noctilucent clouds.|$|R
40|$|Comparative {{studies of}} Jupiter and Saturn often {{emphasize}} their similarities, but recent observations have highlighted important differences. The stratospheres of both planets exhibit an equatorial oscillation reminiscent {{of that in}} Earth's middle atmosphere. Jupiter's oscillation has a 4 - 5 year period, not linked to its season, {{and it has been}} modeled as an analog to the terrestrial quasi-biennial oscillation, driven by the stresses associated with vertically propagating waves. Saturn's equatorial oscillation is nearly semiannual, but wave activity may still be a driver. Jupiter's internal rotation rate is inferred from its steady modulated radio emission. Saturn's internal rotation is more enigmatic. It has been inferred from the modulation of the body's kilometric radio emission, but this period has varied by 1 % over the last 25 years. Saturn's equatorial winds are also puzzling, as those inferred from cloud tracking by Cassini and more recent HST observations are weaker than those from Voyager. Whether this is attributable to a difference in altitudes of the tracked clouds in winds with vertical shear or a real temporal change in the winds is not known. Both winter and <b>summer</b> <b>poles</b> of Saturn exhibit very compact circumpolar vortices with warm cores, indicating subsidence. Titan's middle atmosphere is characterized by global cyclostrophic winds, particularly the strong circumpolar vortex in the winter hemisphere.

40|$|During {{the period}} October to December 1981, the Dynamics Explorer- 2 (DE- 2) {{spacecraft}} successively observed the South polar and the North polar regions, and recorded the temperature, composition and dynamical {{structure of the}} upper thermosphere. In October 1981, perigee was about 310 km altitude, {{in the vicinity of}} the South Pole, with the satellite orbit in the 09. 00 - 21. 00 L. T. plane. During late November and December, the perigee had precessed to the region of the North Pole, with the spacecraft sampling the upper thermosphere in the 06. 00 18. 00 L. T. plane. DE- 2 observed the meridional wind with a Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI), the zonal wind with the wind and temperature spectrometer (WATS), the neutral temperature with the FPI, and the neutral atmosphere composition and density with the neutral atmosphere composition spectrometer (NACS). A comparison between the South (<b>summer)</b> <b>Pole</b> and the North (winter) Pole data shows considerable seasonal differences in all neutral atmosphere parameters. The region of the <b>summer</b> <b>pole,</b> under similar geomagnetic and solar activity conditions, and at a level of about 300 km, is about 300 K warmer than that of the winter pole, and the density of atomic oxygen is strongly depleted (and nitrogen enhanced) around the <b>summer</b> <b>pole</b> (compared with the winter pole). Only part of the differences in temperature and composition structure can be related to the seasonal variation of solar insolation, however, and both polar regions display structural variations (with latitude and Universal Time) which are unmistakeable characteristics of strong magnetospheric forcing. The magnitude of the neutral atmosphere perturbations in winds, temperature, density and composition within both summer and winter polar regions all increase with increasing levels of geomagnetic activity. The UCL 3 -dimensional time dependent global model has been used to simulate the diurnal, seasonal and geomagnetic response of the neutral thermosphere, attempting to follow the major features of the solar and geomagnetic inputs to the thermosphere which were present during the late 1981 period. In the UCL model, geomagnetic forcing is characterized by semi-empirical models of the polar electric field which show a dependence on the Y component of the Interplanetary Magnetic Field, due to Heppner and Maynard (1983), It is possible to obtain an overall agreement, in both summer and winter hemispheres, with the thermospheric wind structure at high latitudes, and to explain the geomagnetic control of the combined thermal and compositional structure both qualitatively and quantitatively. To obtain such agreement, however, it is essential to enhance the polar ionosphere as a consequence of magnetospheric particle precipitation, reflecting both widespread auroral (kilovolt) electrons, and "soft" cusp and polar cap sources. Geomagnetic forcing of the high latitude thermosphere cannot be explained purely by a polar convective electric field, and the thermal as well as ionising properties of these polar and auroral electron sources are crucial components of the total geomagnetic input...|$|E

The data comes from the OI and OH airglow observations of the three-field photometer employed at the University of Adelaide's Buckland Park, Australia (34. 5 °S, 138. 5 °E). About 1300 gravity wave events (AGW) are identified during the years 1995 – 2001. These AGW events usually persist for between 40 min and 4 hours. The magnitudes range from 1 % to 14 % of the background intensities and peak at 2 % for OI observations and at 3 % for OH observations. The observed periods range from 10 to 30 min, and the horizontal phase speeds range from 20 to 250 m s− 1, with dominant wave scales of 17 min, 70 m s− 1 for OI observations and 20 min, 40 m s− 1 for OH observations. The intrinsic parameters are obtained by using medium-frequency (MF) wind data observed at the same place. The occurrence frequency of AGW events peaks at 13 min, 40 m s− 1 for both OI and OH observations. The occurrence rate of gravity waves has a major peak in summer and a minor peak in winter. There is an obvious dominating southeastward direction for gravity waves, with azimuths of 160 ° in summer and 130 ° in winter.

A slight positive net daytime forcing is estimated (i. e., warming) : 0. 070. 67 W m(exp - 2) in sample-relative terms, which reduces to 0. 030. 27 W m(exp - 2) {{in absolute terms}} after normalizing to unity based on a 40 % midlatitude occurrence frequency rate estimated from satellite data. Results are based on bookend solutions for lidar extinction-to-backscatter (20 and 30 sr) and corresponding retrievals of the 532 -nm cloud extinction coefficient. Uncertainties due to cloud under sampling, attenuation effects, sample selection, and lidar multiple scattering are described. A net daytime cooling effect is found from the very thinnest clouds (cloud optical depth of {{less than or equal}} to 0. 01), which is attributed to relatively high solar zenith angles. A relationship involving positive negative daytime cloud forcing is demonstrated as a function of solar zenith angle and cloud-top temperature. These properties, combined with the influence of varying surface albedos, are used to conceptualize how daytime cloud forcing likely varies with latitude and season, with cirrus clouds exerting less positive forcing and potentially net TOA cooling approaching the <b>summer</b> <b>poles</b> (not ice and snow covered) versus greater warming at the equator. The existence of such a gradient would lead cirrus to induce varying daytime TOA forcing annually and seasonally, making it a far greater challenge than presently believed to constrain the daytime and diurnal cirrus contributions to global radiation budgets...|$|R

In-situ measurements at these high altitudes are not easy to perform and several remote sensing techniques have been developed to observe these regions from the ground and from space, among them infrasound measurement is a promising one. This article presents the main characteristics of dynamics and transport in the middle atmosphere and gives a review of the remote sensing techniques used to observe this region in complement to infrasound detection: lidars, radars, infrared and microwave sounders, and GNSS radio-occultation...|$|E
40|$|Data {{from the}} OGO 6 {{satellite}} have been analyzed in magnetic latitude and magnetic local time coordinates for various seasons and magnetic activity levels. These measurements show considerable detail, {{particularly in the}} auroral regions where the energy inputs are well organized in this coordinate system. This detail is not readily observed in models based on geographic coordinates. Atomic oxygen and helium densities and a parameter related to the molecular nitrogen density were analyzed. The long-term averages of these quantities are presented in graphical form and as analytic functions to provide models of these thermospheric parameters. The atomic oxygen and helium densities show minima at high latitudes in the postmidnight sector for nearly all seasons and magnetic activity levels. The exospheric temperature inferred from the N 2 density increases toward high latitudes for all seasons and all magnetic activity levels. This inferred temperature is about 300 deg K higher at the <b>summer</b> magnetic <b>pole</b> than at the winter magnetic pole...|$|R
40|$|International audienceGlobal {{distributions}} of profiles of sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6) have been retrieved from limb emission spectra {{recorded by the}} Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS) on Envisat covering the period September 2002 to March 2004. Individual SF 6 profiles have a precision of 0. 5 pptv below 25 km altitude and a vertical resolution of 4 ? 6 km up to 35 km altitude. These data have been validated versus in situ observations obtained during balloon flights of a cryogenic whole-air sampler. For the tropical troposphere a trend of 0. 227 ± 0. 008 pptv/yr has been derived from the MIPAS data, which is in excellent agreement with the trend from ground-based flask and in situ measurements from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Earth System Research Laboratory, Global Monitoring Division. For the data set currently available, based on {{at least three days}} of data per month, monthly 5 ° latitude mean values have a 1 ? standard error of 1 %. From the global SF 6 distributions, global daily and monthly {{distributions of}} the apparent mean age of air are inferred by application of the tropical tropospheric trend derived from MIPAS data. The inferred mean ages are provided for the full globe up to 90 ° N/S, and have a 1 ? standard error of 0. 25 yr. They range between 0 (near the tropical tropopause) and 7 years (except for situations of mesospheric intrusions) and agree well with earlier observations. The seasonal variation of the mean age of stratospheric air indicates episodes of severe intrusion of mesospheric air during each Northern and Southern polar winter observed, long-lasting remnants of old, subsided polar winter air over the spring and <b>summer</b> <b>poles,</b> and a rather short period of mixing with midlatitude air and/or upward transport during fall in October/November (NH) and April/May (SH), respectively, with small latitudinal gradients, immediately before the new polar vortex starts to form. The mean age distributions further confirm that SF 6 is destroyed in the mesosphere to a considerable amount. Model calculations with the Karlsruhe simulation model of the middle atmosphere (KASIMA) chemical transport model agree well with observed global distributions of the mean age only if the SF 6 sink reactions in the mesosphere are included in the model...|$|R
50|$|The First Peace of Thorn of 1411 had ostensibly ended {{conflicts}} between the warring powers of the Polish-Lithuanian-Teutonic War, although the border between Samogita and Prussia was not determined. Poland also contested Pomerania, Pomerelia, and Culmerland (Chełmno Land). When numerous attempts at negotiations failed, a brief Hunger War broke out in <b>summer</b> 1414. Since <b>Poles</b> and Lithuanians were unable to capture strongly fortified Ordensburgen of the Knights, parties agreed to mediate their dispute in the Council of Constance. The Council established the Samogitian Diocese in Varniai and appointed Matthias of Trakai as its first bishop. However, it did not solve the underlying territorial disputes {{by the time it}} ended in 1418.|$|R
