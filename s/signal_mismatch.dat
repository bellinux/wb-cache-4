40|$|In {{the first}} paper, {{the superiority of}} linear FM signals was shown in terms of {{signal-to-noise}} ratio and robustness to tissue attenuation. This second paper in the series of three papers on the application of coded excitation signals in medical ultrasound presents design methods of linear FM <b>signals</b> and <b>mismatched</b> filters, {{in order to meet}} the higher demands on resolution in ultrasound imaging. It is shown that for the small time-bandwidth (TB) products available in ultrasound, the rectangular spectrum approximation is not valid, which reduces the effectiveness of weighting. Additionally, the distant range sidelobes are associated with the ripples of the spectrum amplitude and, thus, cannot be removed by weighting. Ripple reduction is achieved through amplitude or phase predistortion of the transmitted <b>signals.</b> <b>Mismatched</b> filters are designed to efficiently use the available bandwidth and at the same time to be insensitive to the transducer's impulse response. With these techniques, temporal sidelobes are kept below 60 to 100 dB, image contrast is improved by reducing the energy within the sidelobe region, and axial resolution is preserved. The method is evaluated first for resolution performance and axial sidelobes through simulations with the program Field II. A coded excitation ultrasound imaging system based on a commercial scanner and a 4 MHz probe driven by coded sequences is presented and used for the clinical evaluation of the coded excitation/compression scheme. The clinical images show a significant improvement in penetration depth and contrast, while they preserve both axial and lateral resolution. At the maximum acquisition depth of 15 cm, there is an improvement of more than 10 dB in, the signal-to-noise ratio of the images.

To investigate whether the theoretically important relational match and <b>mismatch</b> <b>signals</b> in the hippocampus are modulated by goal states, we fully crossed whether a probe stimulus relationally matched or mismatched a previously perceived image or goal state. Subjects performed two working memory tasks in which they either responded “yes ” to probes that were identical to the previous sample scene or, after performing a relational manipulation of the scene, responded “yes ” only to a probe that was identical to this perceptually novel image. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we found evidence for relational match enhancements bilaterally in the hippocampus that were selective for matches between the probe stimulus and goal state, but were not modulated by whether that goal was perceptually novel. Moreover, we found evidence for a complementary hippocampal mismatch enhancement that was triggered by stimuli containing salient perceptual manipulations. Our results provided evidence for parallel memory signatures in the hippocampus: a controlled match signal that can detect matches to internally generated goal states and an automatic <b>mismatch</b> <b>signal</b> that can identify unpredicted perceptual novelty.

40|$|Abstract In {{the fast}} {{time-varying}} shallow water environment, the phone-space adaptive processing using sample-matrix-inversion (SMI) approach outperforms the iterative least-mean-squared (LMS) approach {{due to its}} rapid convergence. The SMI approach uses singular-value-decomposition (SVD) to decompose a sample-matrix into a set of spatial eigenvectors and their associated eigenvalues. Adaptive beamforming is applied by matching the steering vectors with the spatial eigenvectors weighted by their eigenvalues. When a long towed-array undergoes significant maneuvering, the array shape and/or the target-to-array relative geometry changes rapidly within a processing interval. A signal in the phone-space sample-matrix is split into more than one eigenvector resulting in <b>signal</b> <b>mismatch</b> in the subsequent beamforming.

The particular approximations used here allow exact evaluation of the per-formances.

In spite of the large FE polarization compared to CMOS charge, present hybrid designs show low differential signals. In this thesis, the question of signal improvement in hybrid FE-CMOS circuits is explored with physical modeling, simulations and experiments. To simulate FE behavior with arbitrary voltage or current input signals, we present a unified physical model of polarization switching based on the stochastic geometry of nucleation and growth. The model is first constructed for ideal FE capacitors with infinite area, and then extended to include the realistic effects of device scaling, domain growth anisotropy, disorder, imprint and fatigue. Circuit predictions for three classes of FE nonvolatile latches are experimentally verified. Design intuition for signal timing, sensing margins and reliability degradation in each topology is presented.

Array forming based on single-sensor recordings might reduce such noise more robustly than conventional hardwired arrays. We use the minimum-variance distortionless-response (MVDR) beamformer to remove (aliased) surface-wave energy from single-sensor data. This beamformer is data adaptive and robust when the presumed and actual desired signals are mismatched. We compute the intertrace covariance for the desired signal, and then for the total signal (desired signal+noise) to obtain optimal weights. We use the raw data of only one array for the covariance of the total signal, and the wavenumber-filtered version of a full seismic single-sensor record for the covariance of the desired signal. In the determination of optimal weights, a parameter that controls the robustness of the beamformer against an arbitrary desired <b>signal</b> <b>mismatch</b> has to be chosen so that the results are optimal.

We also measured the floral spectra of R. alpina flowers to evaluate if signals fit with the currently known framework for observed floral visitors. We found that R. alpina have autonomous selfing and pollinator-mediated crossing, but lack apomixis. We observed that a beetle (Mylabris sp.), and a moth (Macroglossum nycteris) visit the flowers of R. alpina for pollen and nectar feeding respectively. Our field observations, the stigmatic pollen count and fruit set data indicated that the visit by the beetle was legitimate, while that of the moth was illegitimate. Emasculated flowers visited by beetles set as many fruits and seeds/fruit as auto-selfed and naturally pollinated flowers, while emasculated flowers excluded from beetle visits did not set fruit and seed; indicating that a single visit of a beetle to the flowers of R. alpina can facilitate pollination. We found that flower spectral signal of R. alpina does not fit typical spectra previously reported for beetle or bee-visited flowers.

The association between overall emotion recognition performance and mismatch response to the happy condition was significant in the 250 – 360 ms time window in the central ROI. The estimated sources of the mismatch responses for both emotional conditions were localized in frontal regions, where patients showed significantly lower activity. Conclusions: Impaired generation of <b>mismatch</b> <b>signals</b> indicate insufficient automatic processing of emotions in patients with schizophrenia, which correlates strongly with decreased emotion recognition...|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes {{an online}} {{mechanism}} that can evaluate {{the sensitivity of}} single event upsets (SEUs) of field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). The online detection mechanism cyclically reads and compares the values form the external and internal configuration memories, {{taking into account the}} mask information. This remote detection method also <b>signals</b> any <b>mismatch</b> {{as a result of a}} SEU that affects both used and not-used FPGA parts, which maximizes the monitored area. By utilizing an external, Web-accessible controller that is connected to the test infrastructure, the possibility of running the same operation in a remote manner is enabled. Moreover, the need for a local memory to store the mask values is also eliminated...|$|R
