500|$|In 2008, when he {{received}} the Academy Award for Best Actor from Helen Mirren (who was on presenting duty having won the previous year's Best Actress Oscar for playing Queen Elizabeth II in The Queen), Day-Lewis knelt before her and <b>she</b> <b>tapped</b> him on each shoulder with the Oscar statuette, to which he quipped; [...] "That's the closest I'll come to ever getting a knighthood". In June 2014, Day-Lewis was made a Knight Bachelor in the 2014 Birthday Honours for services to drama. In November 2014, he was formally knighted by Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, at Buckingham Palace.|$|E
2500|$|Popular {{legend has}} it that Otelia and William Mahone {{traveled}} along the newly completed Norfolk and Petersburg Railroad naming stations from Ivanhoe, a book she was reading written by Sir Walter Scott. From his historical Scottish novels, Otelia chose the place names of Windsor, Waverly and Wakefield. <b>She</b> <b>tapped</b> the Scottish Clan [...] "McIvor" [...] for the name of Ivor, a small Southampton County town. When they reached a point in Prince George County not far {{from the end of the}} line at Petersburg, the two could not agree. It is said that they invented a new word in honor of their [...] "dispute", which is how the tiny community of Disputanta was named. The N railroad was completed in 1858, and William was named its president.|$|E
2500|$|Mahone married Otelia Butler, from Smithfield in Isle of Wight County, Virginia, a {{daughter}} of Robert Butler (1784–1853), a Virginia state treasurer. Popular {{legend has it that}} Otelia and William Mahone traveled along the newly completed N naming stations along the [...] tangent between Suffolk and Petersburg from Ivanhoe, a book she was reading by Walter Scott. From Scott's historical Scottish novels, Otelia chose the place names of Windsor, Waverly and Wakefield. <b>She</b> <b>tapped</b> the Scottish Clan [...] "McIvor" [...] for the name of Ivor, a small Southampton County town. When they could not agree, it is said that the young couple invented a new word in honor of their [...] "dispute", which is how the tiny community of Disputanta was named.

60|$|The Mistress {{was leaning}} on Miss Martin's {{desk at the}} bar-window, and <b>she</b> <b>taps</b> the open book that lays upon the desk,--she has a pretty-made hand to be sure,--and bobs her head over it and laughs.|$|R
50|$|She also {{performed}} in USO tours, for the Marines and the Flying Tigers. During one USO hospital tour, <b>she</b> <b>tap</b> danced with Peg Leg Bates, a one-legged <b>tap</b> dancer. <b>She</b> {{said that he}} danced far better with one leg than anyone else could with two.|$|R
2500|$|Mary Spears {{wished to}} {{continue}} with her work, and {{had the support of}} some of her original volunteer nurses and MTC drivers. However, Sir Robert Hadfield was dying at a country house near Epsom; Lady Hadfield was cut off at her villa in the south of France. [...] There was accordingly no question of more help from the original sponsors but, through her contacts in America, <b>she</b> <b>tapped</b> into funds which had been donated in America by a charitable organisation known as the British War Relief Society, whose initial donation of £25,000 was enough for her to consider that their financial worries were over. The name of the new unit would remain unchanged, but its organisation and Anglo-French character would be identical to that of her two previous hospitals. [...] These conditions – including the proviso that Mrs Spears would exercise complete control over the female personnel – were accepted in writing by General Charles de Gaulle, who was by now leading the Free French Forces from his headquarters in London.|$|E
2500|$|Beginning in 1990, Brooke (Katherine Kelly Lang) and Taylor {{would fight}} over Ridge's affection for years. In 2013, Tylo {{revealed}} {{that she and}} Lang would distance themselves from each other to make their on-screen rivalry convincing: [...] "We cannot look comfortable with each other. [...] We need to look like {{we are in a}} place of competition." [...] In 2007, Brooke and Taylor's rivalry intensified when Brooke begins pursuing Nick Marone (Jack Wagner) while he is married to Taylor. Soap Opera Digest noted that the women were [...] "crossing swords once again for the same man". Tylo observed that both Brooke and Taylor were being written with [...] "more intelligence" [...] this time around, and was happy in revisiting the rivalry between them as [...] "long as it wasn't over Ridge" [...] again. Taylor becomes pregnant with Nick's child through In vitro fertilisation (IVF), having struggled to conceive a child, and gives birth to Jack Marone. However, because of a mistake that Bridget had made in the lab, it was Brooke's eggs which were implanted in Taylor and not the donor's; making Brooke Jack's biological mother. She fears that her baby will be drawn to Brooke. Taylor begins drinking and becomes mentally unstable, with her parental rights being taken away. The scenes where Taylor loses custody and suffers a breakdown in court were filmed shortly after Tylo's own son died. Tylo told On-Air On-Soaps: [...] "I got a lot of emails from people worrying. They would go from worrying about me to saying, 'Was I okay with those scenes and after them?'" [...] The actress said that <b>she</b> <b>tapped</b> into her own tragedy when portraying those scenes, and allowed herself to feel the [...] "feeling that will never go away which is, 'It's not fair'". Taylor is soon awarded joint custody of Jack when she passes a mental health evaluation. However, she cannot bond with him and ends up giving Jack to Brooke in the end.|$|E

'Men do not live at Hund's saeter,' said my old grey-haired friend, concluding his tale,--'they die there.' ...|$|R

6000|$|Mamma and {{daughter}} were loud in their expressions of admiration of the noble Marquis so soon as his broad back was turned upon them. [...] "He said {{they make a}} very nice couple," [...] whispered major Pendennis to Lady Clavering. Did he now, really? Mamma thought they would; Mamma was so flustered with the honour which had just been shown to her, and with other intoxicating events of the evening, that her good-humour knew no bounds. She laughed, she winked, and nodded knowingly at Pen; <b>she</b> <b>tapped</b> him on the arm with her fan; <b>she</b> <b>tapped</b> Blanche; <b>she</b> <b>tapped</b> the Major;--her contentment was boundless, and her method of showing her joy equally expansive.|$|E

50|$|Russell's {{familiarity}} with the people and organization of the port proves invaluable to the investigation. <b>She</b> <b>taps</b> Maui, an old boyfriend in Frank Sobotka's union, {{to find out more}} about illegal activity in the port. Although Maui does not directly give her any information, his suggestion that all the information the Police need is on the port's computer leads the detail to clone the port's container traffic computer system, allowing them to monitor all traffic on and off of ships.|$|R
5000|$|For Gloria Coates, artistic {{expression}} {{is a spiritual}} necessity. She has great interest and significant participation in painting, architecture, theater, poetry, and singing—but it is through composing that <b>she</b> <b>taps</b> into a wellspring of abstracted emotionality that the others cannot reach. Whatever the veiled expressions of her work may be, there is an undoubted emotional richness present, which if not concretely knowable is at least viscerally felt by the audience. Canons constructed of quartertones and glissandos evoke gloomy instability, but also unearthly beauty.|$|R
60|$|She {{made the}} circuit of the house, {{and found the}} door open and the bridge withdrawn. It was plain, then, that Jimson must have come; plain, too, that he must be on board. He must be a very shy man to have {{suffered}} this invasion of his residence, and made no sign; and her courage rose higher at the thought. He must come now, she must force him from his privacy, for the plank was too heavy for her single strength; so <b>she</b> <b>tapped</b> upon the open door. Then <b>she</b> <b>tapped</b> again.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>tapped</b> {{her foot}} upon the ground. Of these allusions to the possible, and, indeed, the certain {{end of her}} beloved father's illness, she {{had a kind of}} horror.|$|E

500|$|This was {{the final}} episode of the season to be filmed, though not the last to air. According to Jenna Fischer, {{everybody}} on the set was excited {{in a manner that}} she likened to students {{on the last day of}} school. The giddiness particularly shows in Fischer's performance: Pam skips after Jim into the break room, she bounces on her toes at the end of the [...] "fake crying" [...] talking head, and <b>she</b> <b>taps</b> the soda can three times to get Jim to release the jinx.|$|R

50|$|In Adventure Comics, Rainbow Girl (Dori Aandraison from Xolnar) wields {{the powers}} of the {{emotional}} spectrum (resulting in unpredictable mood swings). <b>She</b> <b>taps</b> into red, blue and green energies when she {{and other members of the}} Legion of Substitute Heroes aid Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes in their battle with the Justice League of Earth. Rainbow Girl creates a pheromone field, surrounding her in a sparkling light resembling a rainbow and giving her an irresistible personality.

For Heaven’s love, give her this!” She brings it where I live: she sends it in letters; <b>she</b> <b>taps</b> {{at the window and}} lays it on the sill. What can I do? Look at it!’ ...|$|R
