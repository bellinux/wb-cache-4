40|$|Graduation date: 1967 The {{purpose of}} this study was to isolate and {{characterize}} any <b>segregants</b> of the heterogenotes formed from sexduction by an F' donor. Following the mating of F' W 4520, carrying an F' gal₁⁺ gal₂⁺ factor, with W 3350, a gal₁⁻ gal₂⁻ recipient, a number of recombinant clones were picked and examined for <b>segregants.</b> From 5 such clones, 50 <b>segregants</b> of the gal⁺ phenotype and 50 of the gal⁻ phenotype were isolated. The genotypes of these <b>segregants</b> were determined as follows. The gal⁻ <b>segregants</b> were examined to determine the genotype of any F factors carried, by crosses against three gal⁻ recipient types, which were streptomycin resistant mutants isolated early in the study. The failure of these <b>segregants</b> to produce recombinants in these crosses was taken as evidence that no F factors of the gal⁺ type were carried by these <b>segregants.</b> The gal⁻ <b>segregants</b> were also analyzed for their chromosomal genotype by crosses against two gal⁻ F' homogenotes formed earlier in the study. Again, failure of these crosses to produce gal⁺ recombinants was noted and taken as evidence that these gal⁻ <b>segregants</b> carried chromosomal genotypes of the gal₁⁻ gal₂⁻ type. By a similar procedure, the 50 gal⁺ <b>segregants</b> were examined to determine the genotype of any F factors carried, by crosses against the same 3 gal⁻ recipient types, which in this case, were azide resistant mutants isolated early in the study. The formation of gal⁺ recombinants from these crosses was taken as evidence that these 50 gal⁺ <b>segregants</b> carried F' factors of the type F gal₁⁺ gal₂⁺. The <b>segregants</b> were cured of these F factors with acridine orange and their chromosomal genotypes determined by crosses against the same two gal⁻ F¹ homogenotes used earlier. The absence of gal⁺ recombinant formation from these crosses confirmed that these <b>segregants</b> carried chromosomes of the gal₁⁻ gal₂⁻ type. It was found that no variation of genotype existed among the 50 <b>segregants</b> of each type. The 50 gal⁻ strains were concluded to be either haploid parental types, with the genotype gal₁⁻ gal₂⁻, resulting from loss of the F factor in the sexductional heterogenotes, or possibly homogenotes of the type gal₁⁻ gal₂⁻/ F gal₁⁻ gal₂⁻, which were undetectable in this system. The 50 gal⁺ <b>segregants,</b> carrying the genotype gal₁⁻ gal₂⁻ / F gal₁⁺ gal₂⁺, were of the same type as the heterogenotes from which they were segregated. Since no recombinant types were found, it was concluded that the F' factors, in this system, undergo recombination with their host chromosome, during sexduction, at lower frequencies than expected from analogy with transduction by bacteriophage...|$|R

Induction of the <b>segregants</b> was suppressed almost completely by cycloheximide and partially by caffeine. Thymidylate stress did not, however, induce mutations, as determined by measuring resistance to ouabain or 6 -thioguanine. Thymidylate synthase-negative <b>segregants</b> were also induced by other means such as bromodeoxyuridine treatment and X-ray irradiation. In each of the synthase-negative <b>segregants</b> induced by thymidylate stress, a DNA segment including almost the whole coding region of the transferred human thymidylate synthase gene was deleted in a very specific manner, as shown by Southern blot analysis with a human Alu sequence and a human thymidylate synthase cDNA as probes.

However, a major challenge is sifting through the large number of sequence variants to identify the causative mutation for a given phenotype. In models like Xenopus tropicalis, an incomplete and occasionally incorrect genome assembly compounds this problem. To facilitate cloning of X. tropicalis mutants identified in forward genetic screens, we sought to combine bulk <b>segregant</b> analysis and exome sequencing into a single step. Results Here we report the first use of exon capture sequencing to identify mutations in a non-mammalian, vertebrate model. We demonstrate that bulk <b>segregant</b> analysis coupled with exon capture sequencing is not only able to identify causative mutations but can also generate linkage information, facilitate the assembly of scaffolds, identify misassembles, and discover thousands of SNPs for fine mapping. Conclusion Exon capture sequencing and bulk <b>segregant</b> analysis is a rapid, inexpensive method to clone mutants identified in forward genetic screens. With sufficient meioses, this method can be generalized to any model system with a genome assembly, polished or unpolished, and in the latter case, it also provides many critical genomic resources. </p...|$|E

Development of chickpea cultivars with further enhanced levels of protein is highly desired. This study was aimed at understanding the genetic control of protein content and its association with other traits so that suitable breeding strategies can be prepared for development of high protein content cultivars. A high protein (29. 2 %) desi chickpea line ICC 5912 with pea-shaped small seed, grey seed coat and blue flower was crossed with a low protein (20. 5 %) kabuli line ICC 17109 with owl’s head shaped large seed, beige seed coat, and white flower. The F 2 population was evaluated under field conditions and observations were recorded on protein content and other traits on individual plants. The protein content of F 2 <b>segregants</b> showed continuous distribution suggesting that it is a quantitative trait controlled by multiple genes. The blue flowered <b>segregants</b> had pea shaped seed with grey seed coat, while the white flowered <b>segregants</b> had owl’s head shaped seed with beige seed coat indicating pleiotropic effects of gene(s) on these traits.

We have examined mechanisms of segregation in Chinese hamster cell hybrids heterozygous at these two loci, both of which map to the long arm of Chinese hamster chromosome 2. To follow the fate of chromosomal arms through the segregation process, our hybrids were also heterozygous at the mtx (methotrexate resistance) locus on the short arm of chromosome 2 and carried cytogenetically marked chromosomes with either a short-arm deletion (2 p-) or a long-arm addition (2 q+). Karyotype and phenotype analysis of emetine- or chromate-resistant <b>segregants</b> from such hybrids allowed us to distinguish four potential segregation mechanisms: (i) loss of the emt+- or chr+-bearing chromosome; (ii) mitotic recombination between the centromere and the emt or chr loci, giving rise to homozygous resistant segregants; (iii) inactivation of the emt+ or chr+ alleles; and (iv) loss of the emt+- or chr+-bearing chromosome with duplication of the homologous chromosome carrying the emtr or chrr allele.

The question is which control would allow us to better evaluate the potential unintended effects related directly to the transgene and/or DNA rearrangements, discounting the potential effects caused by in vitro culture procedures; since, these are non-controversial procedures also used in conventional breeding. Aiming to answer the previous question we have used Multiplex fluorescence 2 D gel electrophoresis technology (DyeAGNOSTICS Refraction- 2 D) coupled with MS to characterize the proteome of three different rice lines (Oriza sativa L. ssp. Japonica cv Nipponbare) : A control conventional counterpart. An Agrobacterium transformed transgenic line. A negative <b>segregant</b> (homozygous negative progeny) from a different transgenic line.

The observed specific activities {{were consistent with the}} hypothesis that specific {{activity was}} determined by the sum of the activities due to the dominant (FCY) and recessive (fcy) alleles of the resistance gene. Strains which possessed little UMP pyrophosphorylase activity released uracil into the medium when grown in the absence of 5 -fluorocytosine; this result suggested that recycling of intracellular uracil is a normal function of this enzyme...|$|E

40|$|The oil {{quality and}} yield of {{groundnut}} (Arachis hypogaea L.) is mainly lessened by Puccinia arachidis Speg. For screening {{large number of}} genotypes to rust resistance under in vitro conditions, {{the present study was}} motivated to test and verify the reliability of certain pathogen related enzymes, alterations in protein expression level and isoenzymes, activated ahead of host pathogen interaction. Biparental <b>segregants</b> acquired through NCD 1 mating fashion from crosses, viz. TMV 1 ×ICG 1697 and VRI 2 ×ICG 1697 were artificially inoculated with rust pathogen. After rust infection in groundnut, the alterations in the activity of peroxidase (PO), polyphenol oxidase (PPO), ascorbic acid oxidase (AAO) and chitinase were studied at 80 and 90 days after sowing (DAS) both in susceptible and resistant <b>segregants</b> along with parents. Both susceptible and resistant <b>segregants</b> manifest increased activity of all of these three enzymes, the magnitude was higher in resistant <b>segregants.</b> The activity of ascorbic acid oxidase and chitinase were high at 90 DAS, while polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase exhibited maximum activity at 80 DAS. Four additional isoforms of PO and PPO and prominent expression of a 56 kDa protein were observed in resistant genotypes. The potential amount and activity of these enzymes were genetically determined and such changes in the quantity, isoenzyme and protein can be relied for screening rust tolerant genotypes in groundnut...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Acetic acid {{is one of}} {{the major}} inhibitors in {{lignocellulose}} hydrolysates used for the production of second-generation bioethanol. Although several genes have been identified in laboratory yeast strains that are required for tolerance to acetic acid, the genetic basis of the high acetic acid tolerance naturally present in some Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains is unknown. Identification of its polygenic basis may allow improvement of acetic acid tolerance in yeast strains used for second-generation bioethanol production by precise genome editing, minimizing the risk of negatively affecting other industrially important properties of the yeast. RESULTS: Haploid <b>segregants</b> of a strain with unusually high acetic acid tolerance and a reference industrial strain were used as superior and inferior parent strain, respectively. After crossing of the parent strains, QTL mapping using the SNP variant frequency determined by pooled-segregant whole-genome sequence analysis revealed two major QTLs. All F 1 <b>segregants</b> were then submitted to multiple rounds of random inbreeding and the superior F 7 <b>segregants</b> were submitted to the same analysis, further refined by sequencing of individual <b>segregants</b> and bioinformatics analysis taking into account the relative acetic acid tolerance of the <b>segregants.</b> This resulted in disappearance in the QTL mapping with the F 7 <b>segregants</b> of a major F 1 QTL, in which we identified HAA 1, a known regulator of high acetic acid tolerance, as a true causative allele. Novel genes determining high acetic acid tolerance, GLO 1, DOT 5, CUP 2, and a previously identified component, VMA 7, were identified as causative alleles in the second major F 1 QTL and in three newly appearing F 7 QTLs, respectively. The superior HAA 1 allele contained a unique single point mutation that significantly improved acetic acid tolerance under industrially relevant conditions when inserted into an industrial yeast strain for second-generation bioethanol production. CONCLUSIONS: This work reveals the polygenic basis of high acetic acid tolerance in S. cerevisiae in unprecedented detail. It also shows for the first time that a single strain can harbor different sets of causative genes able to establish the same polygenic trait. The superior alleles identified can be used successfully for improvement of acetic acid tolerance in industrial yeast strains...|$|R
40|$|Indexación: Web of Science; PubMedBackground Berry size is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} main selection criteria in table grape breeding programs. However, this is a quantitative and polygenic trait, and its genetic determination is still poorly understood. Considering its economic importance, it is relevant to determine its genetic architecture and elucidate the mechanisms involved in its expression. To approach this issue, an RNA-Seq experiment based on Illumina platform was performed (14 libraries), including seedless <b>segregants</b> with contrasting phenotypes for berry weight at fruit setting (FST) and 6 – 8 mm berries (B 68) phenological stages. Results A group of 526 differentially expressed (DE) genes were identified, by comparing seedless <b>segregants</b> with contrasting phenotypes for berry weight: 101 genes from the FST stage and 463 from the B 68 stage. Also, we integrated differential expression, principal components analysis (PCA), correlations and network co-expression analyses to characterize the transcriptome profiling observed in <b>segregants</b> with contrasting phenotypes for berry weight. After this, 68 DE genes were selected as candidate genes, and seven candidate genes were validated by real time-PCR, confirming their expression profiles. Conclusions We have carried out the first transcriptome analysis focused on table grape seedless <b>segregants</b> with contrasting phenotypes for berry weight. Our findings contributed {{to the understanding of the}} mechanisms involved in berry weight determination. Also, this comparative transcriptome profiling revealed candidate genes for berry weight which could be evaluated as selection tools in table grape breeding programs. [URL]...|$|R
