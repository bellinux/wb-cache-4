5000|$|Zone {{blocking}} originates with {{blocking the}} first level (defensive line). There are usually two double teams on every zone blocking play (playside and weakside). From each double team, one of the lineman from each will work onto the next level (linebackers). Depending on {{the flow of the}} linebackers, either the drive man (inside blocker of double team) or the post man (outside man of the double team) will leave the double team in order to reach the linebacker. If the linebacker reads {{over the top of the}} double team (outside) then the post man leaves the double team in order to block the flowing linebacker. If the linebacker comes inside the double team (underneath), the drive/inside double teamer will pick up the backer. This blocking scheme creates cut-back lanes, open pockets of space through which the running back can run. Cut-back lanes are created due to an overcommitment (flow) by the defense and a <b>seal</b> <b>block</b> on the backside by linemen.|$|E
40|$|In {{fiscal year}} 1993, tests of an o-ring/tetraseal {{retainer}} designed {{to replace a}} gasket-type seal used in PUREX-type process jumper connectors encouraged the design of an improved <b>seal</b> <b>block.</b> This new <b>seal</b> <b>block</b> combines several parts into one unitized component called an integral <b>seal</b> <b>block.</b> This report summarizes development and leak testing of the new integral <b>seal</b> <b>block.</b> The integral <b>seal</b> <b>block</b> uses a standard o-ring nested in a groove to accomplish leak tightness. This <b>seal</b> <b>block</b> eliminates the need to machine acme threads into the lower skirt casting and seal retainers, eliminates tolerance stack-up, reduces parts inventory, and eliminates an unnecessary leak path in the jumper connector assembly. This report also includes test data on various types of o-ring materials subjected to heat and pressure. Materials tested included Viton, Kalrez, and fluorosilicone, with some incidental data on teflon coated silicone o-rings. Test experience clearly demonstrates the need to test each seal material for temperature and pressure in its intended application. Some materials advertised as being {open_quotes}better{close_quotes} at higher temperatures did not perform up to expectations.

40|$|The {{assembly}} joints {{of modem}} solid rocket motor cases are generally sealed using conventional O-ring type seals. The 5500 + F combustion gases produced by rocket motors are kept {{a safe distance}} away from the seals by thick layers of phenolic insulation. Special compounds are used to fill insulation gaps {{leading up to the}} seals to prevent a direct flowpath to them. Design criteria require that the seals should not experience torching or charring during operation, or their sealing ability would be compromised. On limited occasions, NASA has observed charring of the primary O-rings of the Space Shuttle solid rocket nozzle assembly joints due to parasitic leakage paths opening up in the gap-fill compounds during rocket operation. NASA is investigating different approaches for preventing torching or charring of the primary O-rings. One approach is to implement a braided rope seal upstream of the primary O-ring to serve as a thermal barrier that prevents the hot gases from impinging on the O-ring seals. This paper presents flow, resiliency, and thermal resistance for several types of NASA rope seals braided out of carbon fibers. Burn tests were performed to determine the time to burn through each of the seals when exposed to the flame of an oxyacetylene torch (5500 F), representative of the 5500 F solid rocket motor combustion temperatures. Rope seals braided out of carbon fibers endured the flame for over six minutes, three times longer than solid rocket motor burn time. Room and high temperature flow tests are presented for the carbon seals for different amounts of linear compression. Room temperature compression tests were performed to assess seal resiliency and unit preloads as a function of compression. The thermal barrier seal was tested in a subscale "char" motor test in which the seal sealed an intentional defect in the gap insulation. Temperature measurements indicated that the <b>seal</b> <b>blocked</b> 2500 F combustion gases on the upstream side with very little temperature rise on the downstream side...|$|R

Este trabalho apresenta um estudo para incorporar os resíduos de cinza de lenha da algaroba e chamote (peças de refugo de cerâmicas já sinterizadas), nas massas cerâmicas para confecção de Blocos de Vedação. Os procedimentos metodológicos consistem na caracterização química e mineralógica dos resíduos e das matérias-primas, e caracterização físico-mecânica das formulações das misturas com argila, silte e resíduos. Foram produzidos corpos de prova por prensagem, com variações de composições no intervalo de 0 %, 5 %, 10 % e 15 % em massa de resíduo. A sinterização foi realizada em forno tipo mufla, com patamares nas temperaturas de 850 °C, 900 °C, 950 °C, 1000 °C e 1050 °C. As propriedades físico-mecânicas avaliadas foram: Absorção de Água, Retração Linear de Queima, Porosidade Aparente, Massa Específica Aparente e Resistência Mecânica à Flexão.

40|$|The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) and the West Virginia Office of Miners Health, Safety, and Training (WVOMHS&T) {{investigated}} the explosion at the Sago Mine in West Virginia, which occurred on January 2, 2006, {{and resulted in}} 12 fatalities. As part of the investigation, the agencies requested that the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health s (NIOSH) Pittsburgh Research Laboratory evaluate the effects of explosions on specific mine ventilation seals and other structures and objects at its Lake Lynn Experimental Mine (LLEM). The results of the LLEM study would assist MSHA and WVOMHS&T in a more thorough understanding of the various questions that arose during their investigations of the explosion. Six large-scale explosion tests were conducted in the LLEM from April to October 2006. The protocols for these tests, {{and in particular the}} procedures for constructing various Omega <b>block</b> <b>seals,</b> were developed mainly by MSHA and WVOMHS&T. NIOSH developed the experimental procedures at the LLEM that would provide the required range of explosion pressures against the seals. Three 40 -in-thick seal designs using Omega 384 low-density block were constructed in the LLEM and exposed to various explosion pressures. These seal designs are referred to in this report as the 2001 design, the hybrid design, and the Sago design. The 2001 -design Omega <b>block</b> <b>seal</b> (80 in high) located in crosscut 2 of the LLEM survived all six explosions, with pressure loadings up to 51 psi. The 2001 -design Omega <b>block</b> <b>seal</b> (88 in high) in C-drift was destroyed during Test 2, which subjected the seal to a head-on explosion that resulted in a pressure loading of 51 psi. The height difference between the two seals and the orientation of each seal to the explosion were contributing factors. The higher seal would be weaker for the same seal thickness. The hybrid Omega <b>block</b> <b>seal</b> in crosscut 3 survived an explosion at a pressure loading of 25 psi and failed during another explosion at a pressure loading of 39 psi at the seal. Based on these tests, it seems that the hybrid seal design is weaker than the 2001 seal design. The Sago Omega <b>block</b> <b>seals</b> were constructed in crosscut 3 and C-drift before Test 3. The crosscut 3 seal survived a pressure loading of 18 psi and was destroyed during an explosion at a pressure loading of 35 psi at the seal. The C-drift seal survived a head-on explosion that resulted in a pressure loading of 21 psi and was destroyed during an explosion with a pressure loading of 57 psi at the seal. Based on these LLEM tests, it seems that the Sago seal design is weaker than the 2001 seal design, yet it still complied with the requirements of 30 CFR 75. 335 (a) (2) that were in effect {{at the time of the}} mine disaster. During these LLEM explosion tests, the distance of seal debris travel was also measured. In Test 5, the C-drift seal was destroyed during a head-on explosion that resulted in a pressure loading of 57 psi, and the seal debris was thrown over 500 ft. In Test 6, the C-drift seal was destroyed during a head-on explosion that resulted in a pressure loading of 93 psi, and the Omega block debris was thrown over 900 ft. During these tests, the explosion pressure effects on other structures and objects were also documented. Unless otherwise specified, all of the pressure data listed in this report represent the highest recorded smoothed (averaged over 10 ms) explosion pressure loadings.
