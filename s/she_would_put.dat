5|$|It was {{announced}} in June 2013 that Dixon was expecting her first child with her partner, former backing dancer Azuka Ononye, and on her 35th birthday, 7 October 2013, she stated on Twitter that she {{had given birth to}} her daughter, Azura Sienna, the previous week. Dixon said <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>put</b> her fourth album on hold and concentrate on motherhood.|$|E
5|$|On April 28, 2010, Varon {{announced}} on her MySpace blog {{that she would}} be leaving TNA the following month, after refusing to re-sign with the company, due to not receiving a pay increase. On the May 3 episode of Impact!, Tara challenged Madison Rayne to a match at Sacrifice, where <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>put</b> her career on the line against Rayne's Knockouts Championship. At Sacrifice on May 16, Tara failed to win the match, and as a result her TNA career came to an end. After her TNA career came to a halt, she continued to discuss a new contract with Dixie Carter.|$|E

Her transcriptions (for piano four-hands) include works by Dargomyzhsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, Tchaikovsky, Borodin and Glazunov. She also arranged the vocal scores for Rimsky-Korsakov's The Maid of Pskov and The Noblewoman Vera Sheloga, along with Borodin's Prince Igor in conjunction with Glazunov and her husband.|$|E

25|$|It {{was all for}} naught. By then, Nwe as well as Ngan-Mohn {{had come}} to {{consider}} Maha Dewi as the enemy, believing that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>put</b> her lover on the throne instead. Zeik-Bye had been instigating; he had warned Nwe that Maha Dewi and Maru were plotting to arrest him. By 22 April 1383, Nwe had decided to revolt. In {{the wee hours of}} 5 May 1383, Nwe and his 30 men fled to Dagon, and seized the governor's residence at Dagon.|$|E
25|$|In response, on {{the basis}} it was {{tantamount}} to a vote of no confidence, the President of PES, Pauline Green, announced <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>put</b> forward a motion of censure. However PES would vote against its own motion, {{as there is no}} method for a motion of confidence. During this period, the Parliament took on an increased government-opposition dynamic, with PES as a party supporting the Commission and the EPP renouncing its support and acting as a de facto opposition party to the executive. This is in part because the allegations centred on Édith Cresson and Manuel Marín, both from the Socialist party (PES). It was seen by some that it was an attempt by the People's party (EPP) to discredit PES ahead of the 1999 elections. This led to hesitation from the PES leadership, who were the largest group in Parliament, to support the allegations. Motions tabled by the two groups outlined the differing stances the EPP favouring individual responsibility (just those whom the main allegations are against) and PES favouring an emphasis on collective responsibility (so EPP members such as the President, as well as PES members, would be forced to resign). The PES resolution also proposed establishing a committee of independent experts to investigate the allegations.|$|E
500|$|The young Hepburn was a tomboy {{who liked}} to call herself Jimmy, and cut her hair short. Thomas Hepburn was eager for his {{children}} to use their minds and bodies to the limit, and taught them to swim, run, dive, ride, wrestle, and play golf and tennis. Golf became a passion of Katharine's; she took daily lessons and became very adept, reaching the semi-final of the Connecticut Young Women's Golf Championship. She loved swimming in Long Island Sound, and took ice-cold baths every morning {{in the belief that}} [...] "the bitterer the medicine, the better it was for you." [...] Hepburn was a fan of movies from a young age, and went to see one every Saturday night. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> <b>put</b> on plays and perform for her neighbors with friends and siblings for 50 cents a ticket {{to raise money for the}} Navajo people.|$|E

500|$|As {{the race}} for prom queen intensifies, Lauren Zizes (Ashley Fink) begins campaigning against Quinn. She discovers that Quinn's first name is Lucy, and {{that she used to}} be an {{overweight}} outcast who had rhinoplasty before re-inventing herself and transferring to McKinley. Lauren attempts to sabotage Quinn's campaign by revealing her former image to the other students, but it backfires when Quinn's popularity actually increases amongst the girls like Lauren, encouraged by the idea of someone able to rise above such difficulties like she did, and become popular. Lauren apologizes to Quinn, but Quinn commends her for her confidence and pride, and the two form a bond. Brittany shows off her shirt to Santana, and gives Santana a shirt reading [...] "Lebanese", believing that it reads [...] "Lesbian". Santana balks at wearing it, and the two argue; Brittany finally storms off saying that if Santana loved herself as much as Brittany loved her, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>put</b> on the shirt and dance with her. The episode closes with the club, minus Santana, embracing their identities and performing [...] "Born This Way". During the song, Emma arrives wearing a T-shirt that acknowledges her own problems—it reads [...] "OCD"—and she and Will join the performance. Karofsky and Santana watch from the audience, with Santana wearing her [...] "Lebanese" [...] shirt.|$|E
500|$|During testing, Nordby and {{the special}} effects teams {{realized}} that getting Fox {{in and out of}} the appliance used to create Jennifer's murderous jaw would be too time-consuming. To remedy this, they hired a photo double. [...] "very day (for about 10 days) she would sit in a chair with this full appliance on her and we would shoot this jaw, and then all [...] would have to do is the dentures", stated Nordby. He said that [...] "when it came time to shoot any of these jaw moments, [...] would act out in rehearsal how she was going to attack her victim and [...] fine tune that blocking so it was relatively locked". The camera accompanied them in the same way, as [...] "it would roll and <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>put</b> her dentures in, and they would really distort her face" [...] in a way that would produce a satisfying and nice side effect. Additionally, the team would have Fox wear contact lenses and go through exactly the same motions as normal Jennifer. [...] "But then I would shoot all the key poses that existed in whatever moves the digital double was doing, so that we had as much of that appliance in that lighting condition that we could get", said Nordby. [...] "KNB also created a hairless but high detailed head of the stage five Jennifer that had an articulating jaw." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to her jazz-influenced former album, Winehouse's focus {{shifted to the}} girl groups of the 1950s and 1960s. Winehouse hired New York singer Sharon Jones's longtime band, the Dap-Kings, to back her up {{in the studio and}} on tour. Mitch Winehouse relates in Amy, My Daughter how fascinating watching her process was: her perfectionism in the studio and how <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>put</b> what she had sung on a CD and play it in his taxi outside to know how most people would hear her music. In May 2006, Winehouse's demo tracks such as [...] "You Know I'm No Good" [...] and [...] "Rehab" [...] appeared on Mark Ronson's New York radio show on East Village Radio. These were some of the first new songs played on the radio after the release of [...] "Pumps" [...] and both were slated to appear on her second album. The 11-track album, completed in five months, was produced entirely by Salaam Remi and Ronson, with the production credits being split between them. Ronson said in a 2010 interview that he liked working with Winehouse because she was blunt when she did not like his work. She in turn thought that when they first met, he was a sound engineer and that she was expecting an older man with a beard. Promotion of Back to Black soon began and, in early October 2006 Winehouse's official website was relaunched with a new layout and clips of previously unreleased songs. Back to Black was released in the UK on 30 October 2006. It went to number one on the UK Albums Chart for two weeks in January 2007, dropping then climbing back for several weeks in February. In the US, it entered at number seven on the Billboard 200. It was the best-selling album in the UK of 2007, selling 1.85million copies {{over the course of the}} year.|$|E

2500|$|According to legend, Hanina {{was very}} poor. Indeed, it became proverbial that, while {{the whole world}} was {{provided}} for through Hanina's great merits, he himself sustained life from one Sabbath eve to another on a basket of carob beans. For some time the outside world had been kept in ignorance of his privations; his wife did all that was possible to maintain an appearance of comfort, and though she had no flour with which to make dough, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>put</b> fuel into the oven every Friday and cause columns of smoke to rise, thus making her neighbors believe that, like them, she was baking the Sabbath meals. In time, however, one woman's suspicion was aroused, and she determined to surprise Hanina's wife and discover the truth. But, according to the legend, a miracle prevented exposure. When the woman appeared at Hanina's house and looked into the smoking oven it was full of loaves. In spite of the miracle, Hanina's wife induced him to collect from heaven an advance portion of his future lot. Hanina complied with her request, and, in answer to his prayer, a golden table-leg was miraculously sent him. Husband and wife were happy; but that night the wife had a vision of heaven in which she saw the saints feasting at three-legged tables while her husband's table had only two legs. She awoke full of regret at the importunity which had deprived his table of a leg, and insisted that he pray for the withdrawal of the treasure. This he did, and the golden leg disappeared. Of this supposed miracle the Talmud says: [...] "It was greater than the former, since heaven gives, but never takes" [...] (Ta'anit, 24b et seq.).|$|E
