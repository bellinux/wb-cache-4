5|$|Between 1907 and 1913, a {{development}} boom occurred in Lethbridge, {{making it the}} main marketing, distribution and <b>service</b> <b>centre</b> in southern Alberta. Such municipal projects as a water treatment plant, a power plant, a streetcar system, and exhibition buildings — {{as well as a}} construction boom and rising real estate prices — transformed the mining town into a significant city. Between World WarI and World WarII, however, the city experienced an economic slump. Development slowed, drought drove farmers from their farms, and coal mining rapidly declined from its peak. After World WarII, irrigation of farmland near Lethbridge led to growth in the city's population and economy. Lethbridge College (previously Lethbridge Community College) opened in April 1957 and the University of Lethbridge in 1967.|$|E

5|$|A Standard Ticket {{contactless}} {{smart card}} for single or return journeys {{may also be purchased}} at the GTM for the payment of MRT and/or LRT fares. A S$0.10 deposit will be levied on top of the fare to be paid. The deposit will be automatically refunded through an offset of the fare to be paid for the third journey on the same ticket while an additional discount of S$0.10 will be given for the sixth journey on the same ticket. No refund of the deposit is provided if the card is used for fewer than 3 journeys. The ticket can be used for the purchase of single or return journeys to and from pre-selected stations up to a maximum of six journeys over 30 days.

The ticket is retained by the user after each journey and {{does not need to be}} returned to any GTM or Passenger <b>Service</b> <b>Centre.</b> Identical to the usage of CEPAS cards, the ticket is tapped onto the faregate reader upon entry and exit.|$|E
5|$|In 1958 Federal {{government}} {{agreed to}} apply the Monaro Highway name to Cooma-Canberra road within the ACT. This gave the roadway a single name between Canberra and the Victorian border. Originally, the highway ended where it met Jerrabomberra Avenue. Plans were publicised during the mid-1980s for an upgrade of the existing Monaro Highway to dual-carriageway standard between Isabella Drive and Jerrabomberra Avenue, and {{an extension of the}} roadway to the north. These works were known as the Eastern Parkway. These plans were then given the go ahead in a report tabled on 5 May 1987, the estimated costs were $50 million including upgrades to other nearby roadways. Around the same time period a large <b>service</b> <b>centre</b> was proposed for near the Isabella Drive intersection, though it was quite controversial, and the developer pulled out. Between 1988 and November 1989 the duplication was completed, and the roadway extended as far as Canberra Avenue. After this the road was extended to its current terminus at Morshead Drive, although the northbound carriageway was originally routed over Dairy Flat Road until a southbound carriageway was constructed later on. Further duplication was performed to other sections of the extension until all sections were completed in mid-2012. The northern end of the Monaro Highway will connect to {{the southern end of the}} Majura Parkway following its expected completion in 2016. Territory and Municipal Services has classified the Monaro Highway as an arterial road within the ACT Road Hierarchy.|$|E
