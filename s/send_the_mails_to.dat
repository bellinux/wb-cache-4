50|$|Contrabass sarrusophones are {{extremely}} light for contrabass instruments, weighing only {{about as much}} as a baritone saxophone, and being approximately four feet tall, about the same height as a bass saxophone. This makes them more convenient to carry around, fitting into cars more easily, and putting less strain on one's muscles while carrying or playing it.

40|$|Abstract:- An {{efficient}} and secure protocol in certified e-mail delivery is proposed in this paper. With {{the widespread use}} of public Internet, communication via electronic mail (e-mail) becomes a convenience application instead of traditional manuscript letter. People can easily append his/her digital signature to the e-mail in order to achieve the goal of non-repudiation of origin. However, the evidence of receipt still relies on the willingness of the recipient in the standard e-mail service. Hence, the recipient has no responsible for the received e-mail. In this paper, we present an {{efficient and}} secure protocol in fair certified e-mail delivery (CEMD). Our protocol efficiently provides non-repudiation of origin and receipt in the fair manner. In other words, the sender can obtain the irrefutable receipt if and only if the recipient gets the certified e-mail from the sender, otherwise, neither of them. Moreover, the proposed CEMD is efficiently in <b>sending</b> <b>the</b> other <b>mails</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> same recipient by using the pre-computation function. As the evaluations of computational cost and communication overhead, our protocol is cost-effective and efficient than other relevant protocols...|$|R

("Ash, Wind, Fire" [...] in Japan; both are parodies of an American Funk band Earth, Wind & Fire.) His cronies believe that he hates jokes, since he's always so serious. In truth, he is a connoisseur of sophisticated humor, despising the sophomoric jokes that his friends prefer. He is also a postcard comedian (someone who <b>sends</b> jokes in <b>the</b> <b>mail</b> <b>to</b> be heard on the radio). His pen name is [...] "Ajishio Taro" [...] (roughly, [...] "Salt Boy"), and he is rivaled only by Kamiyama, who he initially knows only as [...] "Honey Boy." [...] He is easily recognized by his large afro hairstyle and his ever-constant sunglasses.|$|R
2500|$|As a {{group that}} never had over a few hundred members, Lehi relied on audacious but {{small-scale}} operations to bring their message home. They adopted the tactics of {{groups such as the}} Socialist Revolutionaries and the Combat Organization of the Polish Socialist Party in Czarist Russia, and the Irish Republican Army. To this end, Lehi conducted small-scale operations such as individual assassinations of British officials (notable targets included Lord Moyne, CID detectives, and Jewish [...] "collaborators"), and random shootings against soldiers and police officers. Another strategy, adopted in 1946, was <b>to</b> <b>send</b> bombs in <b>the</b> <b>mail</b> <b>to</b> British politicians. Other actions included sabotaging infrastructure targets: bridges, railroads, telephone and telegraph lines, and oil refineries, as well as the use of vehicle bombs against British military, police, and administrative targets. Lehi financed its operations from private donations, extortion, and bank robbery. Its campaign of violence lasted from 1944 to 1948. Initially conducted together with the Irgun, it included a six-month suspension to avoid being targeted by the Haganah during the Hunting Season, and later operated jointly with the Haganah and Irgun under the Jewish Resistance Movement. After the Jewish Resistance Movement was dissolved, it operated independently as part of the general Jewish insurgency in Palestine.|$|R
