Second Avenue express trains would run to Lower Manhattan via the Montague Street Tunnel and local trains would run via the Manhattan Bridge and skip Lower Manhattan.

5|$|Bigfin reef squids exhibit strong {{positive}} phototactic behaviour (attraction to light) {{and will}} move readily {{within a certain}} distance of a light source.

5|$|From 2010, Smooth and Real Radio {{were the}} {{official}} broadcaster of the switch-on ceremony for the Blackpool Illuminations, the broadcast rights {{to which it}} won from BBC Radio 2, which had aired it since 1997. 2010 {{was the first time}} the event was broadcast on commercial radio. The annual event was compered by presenters from the two stations at a purposely-built arena, and featured a music concert by popular artists. Performers in 2010 included Alesha Dixon, Gabriella Cilmi, The Wanted, Olly Murs, and Robbie Williams, who <b>switched</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lights that year. The 2012 switch-on was performed by Greg Rutherford, Luke Campbell and Beth TweddleBritish Olympians who won gold medals at the 2012 Summer Olympics.|$|E

25|$|In {{the latter}} part of the second revolution, Thomas Alva Edison {{developed}} many devices that greatly influenced life around the world and is often credited with the creation of the first industrial research laboratory. In 1882, Edison <b>switched</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> world's first large-scale electrical supply network that provided 110 volts direct current to fifty-nine customers in lower Manhattan. Also toward the end of the second industrial revolution, Nikola Tesla made many contributions in the field of electricity and magnetism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.|$|E
25|$|Floodlights {{were first}} used on 9 November 1953 for a match against Hibernian when the £7,000 lights, {{claimed to be}} the most {{expensive}} in the country at the time, were <b>switched</b> <b>on.</b> <b>The</b> game attracted 31,500 spectators who saw two goals each from John Charles and manager Raich Carter as Leeds beat the Scottish side 4–1.

25|$|Some hidden {{headlamps}} {{themselves do}} not move, but rather are covered {{when not in}} use by panels designed to blend in with the car's styling. When the lamps are <b>switched</b> <b>on,</b> <b>the</b> covers are swung out of the way, usually downward or upward, for example on the 1992 Jaguar XJ220. The door mechanism may be actuated by vacuum pots, as on some Ford vehicles of the late 1960s through early 1980s such as the 1967–1970 Mercury Cougar, or by an electric motor as on various Chrysler products of the middle 1960s through late 1970s such as the 1966–1967 Dodge Charger.|$|E
25|$|The {{perpetrators}} left three {{explosive devices}} connected {{to one another}} at the Inland Regional Center, contained inside the backpack left by Farook during the departmental event. The devices were described as pipe bombs constructed with Christmas lights and tied together, combined with a remote controlled car that was <b>switched</b> <b>on.</b> <b>The</b> poorly constructed devices failed to explode. Authorities believe that the pipe bombs were meant to target the emergency personnel responding to the scene. The device was hidden inside a canvas bag, and its build was similar to schematics published in Al Qaeda's Inspire magazine. Coworkers noticed the bag before the attack occurred, but thought that Farook would return for it and therefore did not investigate it.|$|E
25|$|The National Christmas Tree again {{remained}} largely unlit in 1980. President Carter's five-year-old grandson, Jason, <b>switched</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tree. The tree {{had been completely}} decorated with large balls and lights, but {{at a meeting in}} early December 1980 the families of the American hostages asked that the tree remain unlit. The lights on the tree shone for 417 seconds, one second for every day that the hostages had been captive. The lights were then turned off, leaving only the star atop the tree shining. When the hostages were released on January 20, 1981, the tree was redecorated. It was relit for the returning hostages on January 27. 1980 was also the first year that the Pageant of Peace organizers were required by the National Park Service to hold an open meeting to solicit input from the public. Once again, a separate small tree honored of American prisoners of war.|$|E

25|$|The {{degaussing}} circuit {{is often}} built of a thermo-electric (not electronic) device containing a small ceramic heating element {{and a positive}} thermal coefficient (PTC) resistor, connected directly to the switched AC power line with the resistor in series with the degaussing coil. When the power is <b>switched</b> <b>on,</b> <b>the</b> heating element heats the PTC resistor, increasing its resistance {{to a point where}} degaussing current is minimal, but not actually zero. In older CRT displays, this low-level current (which produces no significant degaussing field) is sustained along with the action of the heating element as long as the display remains switched on. To repeat a degaussing cycle, the CRT display must be switched off and left off for at least several seconds to reset the degaussing circuit by allowing the PTC resistor to cool to the ambient temperature; switching the display-off and immediately back on will result in a weak degaussing cycle or effectively no degaussing cycle.|$|E
25|$|The {{concert was}} {{originally}} {{scheduled to be}} held at San Jose State University's practice field, as there had recently been a three-day outdoor free festival there with 52 bands and 80,000 attendees. Dirt Cheap Productions was asked to help secure the property again for the Rolling Stones and Grateful Dead to play a free concert. The Stones and the Dead were told the city of San Jose was not in the mood for another large concert and the grounds were out of bounds. Golden Gate Park in San Francisco was next on the list. However, a previously scheduled Chicago Bears–San Francisco 49ers football game at Kezar Stadium, located in Golden Gate Park, made that venue impractical, and permits were never issued for the concert. The venue was then changed to the Sears Point Raceway. However, a dispute with Sears Point's owner, Filmways, Inc., arose over a $300,000 up-front cash deposit from the Rolling Stones and film distribution rights, so the festival was moved once again. The Altamont Raceway was chosen at the suggestion of its then-owner, local businessman Dick Carter. The concert was to take place on Saturday, December 6; the location was <b>switched</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> night of Thursday, December 4.|$|E

500|$|Per the {{regulations}} for the 2015 season, three practice sessions were scheduled, two 1.5-hour sessions on Friday and another one-hour session before qualifying on Saturday. The first session on Friday {{started on a}} damp track, described by Sebastian Vettel as [...] "ridiculously slippery", with the first half-hour of running done on intermediate tyres. Valtteri Bottas set the fastest time on those tyres, before all teams <b>switched</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> medium compound. Even on the dry tyres, still many drivers were fooled by the conditions, going off at turns 8 and 10 in particular. Nico Rosberg's Mercedes suffered from overheating rear brakes, forcing {{him back to the}} pit lane while he held the fastest time. Carlos Sainz Jr. recorded the most timed laps with 37, and finished eighth fastest, ahead of local favourite Sergio Pérez and Felipe Massa. Jolyon Palmer again replaced Romain Grosjean at the wheel of the Lotus, as he would do {{for the rest of the}} season, and finished fifteenth fastest, 0.2 seconds slower than teammate Pastor Maldonado. The fastest time of the session was set by Max Verstappen in the Toro Rosso, at 1:25.990, even though he went off in the second sector of the track. He was followed by Daniil Kvyat and the two Ferrari cars of Kimi Räikkönen and Sebastian Vettel. While Rosberg was demoted to sixth, newly crowned World Champion Lewis Hamilton was only eleventh fastest.|$|E
