5|$|As a final {{attempt to}} stop the Allied advances, the Japanese Imperial High Command planned an all-out defense of Kyūshū codenamed Operation Ketsugō. This {{was to be a}} radical {{departure}} from the defense in depth plans used in the invasions of Peleliu, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa. Instead, everything was <b>staked</b> on the beachhead; more than 3,000 kamikazes would be sent to attack the amphibious transports before troops and cargo were disembarked on the beach.|$|E

5|$|Their {{painting}} demonstrates, {{more than}} any other figures on the ceiling, Michelangelo's mastery of anatomy and foreshortening and his enormous powers of invention. In their reflection of classical antiquity they resonate with Pope Julius' aspirations to lead Italy towards a new 'age of gold'; at the same time, they <b>staked</b> Michelangelo's claim to greatness. However, a number of critics were angered by their presence and nudity, including Pope Adrian VI who wanted the ceiling stripped.|$|E

50|$|In each <b>stake,</b> {{one of the}} meetinghouses is {{designated}} the <b>stake</b> center. This building is usually the largest meetinghouse in the <b>stake,</b> but where <b>stakes</b> are large in area the <b>stake</b> center may be chosen {{because it is more}} centrally-located in the boundaries of the <b>stake.</b> The <b>stake</b> center is where functions of the <b>stake</b> such as <b>stake</b> conferences, <b>stake</b> meetings, and <b>stake</b> activities are usually held. There are usually offices for conducting <b>stake</b> business in the <b>stake</b> center. During the mid-to-late 19th and early-20th century, in areas with larger LDS populations, <b>stake</b> tabernacles were used for most of the larger activities now performed at <b>stake</b> centers, while the <b>stake</b> offices were located in what was known as a <b>stake</b> house. In areas with fewer members and no <b>stake</b> tabernacle, a <b>stake</b> house was used like a modern <b>stake</b> center for both meetings and offices.|$|R
5|$|After Sultan Ali's {{death in}} 1877, the Raja Temenggong of Muar and its village chieftains voted {{in favour of}} a merger of Muar with Johor {{following}} a succession dispute between two of Sultan Ali's sons.

Tengku Alam instigated the 1879 Jementah Civil War in a bid to reclaim Muar, but was quickly crushed by the Maharaja's forces. During the 1880s, Abu Bakar actively encouraged the Chinese leaders to set up new gambier and pepper plantations in Muar.|$|E

Wyatt also <b>staked</b> mining claims just outside Death Valley and {{elsewhere}} in the Mojave Desert. In 1906, he discovered several deposits of gold and copper near the Sonoran Desert town of Vidal, California, on the Colorado River and filed more than 100 mining claims near the Whipple Mountains. While in Los Angeles, they lived in at least nine small Los Angeles rentals as early as 1885 and as late as 1929, mostly in the summer.|$|E
5|$|Before 1923, Coghlan {{had opposed}} the {{amalgamation}} of Northern and Southern Rhodesia, concerned {{that it would}} make responsible government harder to attain. One outcome of the Jameson Raid in 1895–96 had been to prevent the concentration of the BSAC into one administration. Instead, the High Commission in Bechuanaland was maintained, Northern Rhodesia kept its own administration, and Britain oversaw BSAC affairs more closely. One year into his premiership, Coghlan began to consider territorial expansion and <b>staked</b> a claim to northwestern Bechuanaland. The Dominions Office rejected the claim {{on the grounds that the}} Union of South Africa would respond with its own claim for the southern half of the territory.|$|E

5|$|Claims {{to three}} lode mines {{and a single}} coal mine were made within the Goat Rocks Wilderness, but the United States Bureau of Mines has no record of {{production}} from any of these claims.

Neither show evidence of assessment work, and both deposits are now abandoned. Miners may have been drawn to the area by news of lode deposits containing gold, silver, and copper along breccia and shear zones {{to the north of}} the wilderness area.|$|E
5|$|Following his 23rd {{victory on}} 1 April, Voss fired upon pilot and plane {{on the ground}} after the crash. On 6 April 1917, he <b>staked</b> two victory claims 15 minutes apart, having brought down a {{two-seater}} and a Sopwith Pup near one another {{on either side of}} the front lines. The two-seater pilot braved both Voss's strafing and incoming German artillery to retrieve aerial photography plates for their military intelligence value. The Sopwith Pup, though later seen with Jasta 2 in German markings after its capture, was an unconfirmed victory despite landing behind German lines.|$|E
5|$|Methods of {{destroying}} suspected vampires varied, with staking {{the most commonly}} cited method, particularly in southern Slavic cultures. Ash was the preferred wood in Russia and the Baltic states, or hawthorn in Serbia, {{with a record of}} oak in Silesia. Aspen was also used for stakes, as it was believed that Christ's cross was made from aspen (aspen branches on the graves of purported vampires were also believed to prevent their risings at night). Potential vampires were most often <b>staked</b> through the heart, though the mouth was targeted in Russia and northern Germany and the stomach in north-eastern Serbia.|$|E
