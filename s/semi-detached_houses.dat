5|$|Sale's built {{environment}} is varied, {{with a mixture}} of modern and old buildings. Some terraces, <b>semi-detached</b> <b>houses</b> and villas, survive from the Victorian period, although many of the larger houses have been converted into flats. Many <b>semi-detached</b> <b>houses</b> survive from the 1930s, when there was a need for new housing in the town {{as a result of a}} growing population and an increasingly wealthy middle class. Interspersed with these older structures are newer housing developments, such as the estates built in Ashton upon Mersey and the east of Sale during the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} an {{increase}} in the number of households from 47,214 in 1991 to 52,501 in 2006. The average household size has reduced from 2.70 in 1991 to 2.44 in 2001. 89.8% of houses had central heating in 2001 compared with 75.8% in 2001. The type of housing has also changed with an increase from 15.5% to 19.2% in detached houses from 1991 to 2001, an increase over the same years in <b>semi-detached</b> <b>houses</b> from 30.0% to 33.0% and a corresponding decrease in terraced houses from 44.0% to 37.5%.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702011047/http://www2.halton.gov.uk/content/councilanddemocracy/council/research/factbook?a=5441|archivedate=2 July 2007}} The percentage of dwellings in council tax bands A-B is, at 69% the highest in any Cheshire local authority while the percentages in bands E-F (8%) and G-H (1%) are the lowest.|$|E
5|$|The land {{within the}} town {{is made up of}} {{approximately}} 62% greenspace, 18% domestic gardens, 7% roads, 4% domestic buildings, 3% non-domestic buildings and 6% other uses. Since the 19th century, trade in Brownhills has been centred on the High Street. As the canal and Clayhanger Common lie immediately to the south of the High Street, the town's housing areas are mainly to the north and at the eastern and western ends of the town. Brownhills has 5,152 residential dwellings, of which 47% are <b>semi-detached</b> <b>houses.</b> Selling prices for all types of property within the town have risen significantly since 2000; in August 2007 the average selling price was £137,600, compared to £59,596 in 2000, a rise of 131%. The Aldridge and Brownhills Housing Trust owns and manages those properties formerly owned as council houses by Walsall Council.|$|E

5|$|In Borissik Svetlana v. Urban Redevelopment Authority (2009), the {{applicant}} {{and her husband}} owned a semi-detached house which they wished to redevelop. In 2002, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) had issued a circular imposing certain restrictions on the redevelopment of <b>semi-detached</b> <b>houses.</b> The URA rejected {{the applicant}}'s redevelopment application {{on the basis of}} the circular. Counsel for the applicant argued before the High Court that the applicant had a legitimate expectation that the proposal to redevelop the house would be approved. The Court held that the URA had not acted in a way that could have led the applicant to have such a legitimate expectation. It adopted four conditions set out in De Smith's Judicial Review (6th ed., 2007) to determine whether a legitimate expectation has been created: the public body's representation must be clear, unambiguous and devoid of any relevant qualification; induced by the conduct of the decision-maker; made by a person with actual or ostensible authority; and applicable to the applicant, who belongs to the class of persons to whom the representation is reasonably expected to apply. The only legitimate expectation that could have arisen after the 2002 circular had been issued was that the URA would act in accordance with those guidelines unless the circumstances were such that an exception has to be made. The applicant in Borissik argued that she had a legitimate expectation to a substantive right, but since the Court decided that the URA had made no clear representation to her, it did not make any pronouncements on the approach that should be taken towards substantive legitimate expectations in Singapore.|$|E

25|$|The {{housing estate}} {{consisted}} of two and three-bedroomed <b>semi-detached</b> <b>houses,</b> {{and a number of}} three-storey blocks containing12 flats or more, but some have been demolished. Most houses were built of brick, but a number were constructed of prefabricated cinder and concrete panels. The right to buy scheme, implemented by the Conservative Party in the Housing Act of 1980, enabled tenants to buy their homes. In 2008, the average price for a house in Swarcliffe was £109,810. In 2010, 1,025 homes were privately owned, and 1,394were rented.|$|E
25|$|In Malaysia, suburbs are common, {{especially}} in areas surrounding the Klang Valley, {{which is the}} largest conurbation in the country. These suburbs also serve as major housing areas and commuter towns. Terraced houses, <b>semi-detached</b> <b>houses</b> and shophouses are common concepts in suburbs. In certain areas such as Klang, Subang Jaya and Petaling Jaya, suburbs form the core of these places. The latter one {{has been turned into a}} satellite city of Kuala Lumpur. Suburbs are also evident in other smaller conurbations including Penang, Ipoh, Johor Bahru, Kota Kinabalu, Kuching and Alor Setar.|$|E
25|$|Influenced by {{government}} structures, {{much of the}} city's architecture tends to be formalistic and functional; however, the city is also marked by Romantic and Picturesque styles of architecture such as the Parliament Buildings' gothic revival architecture. Ottawa's domestic architecture is dominated by single family homes, but also includes smaller numbers of <b>semi-detached</b> <b>houses,</b> rowhouses, and apartment buildings. Many domestic buildings are clad in brick, with small numbers covered in wood, stone, or siding of different materials; variations are common, depending on neighbourhoods {{and the age of}} dwellings within them.|$|E

25|$|During this time, Ashfield {{was seen}} as a highly {{desirable}} location compared to the city, which had become crowded and pestilent. Many grand Victorian houses were built {{in the latter part of}} the 19th century. But by the time of World War I, the suburb had fallen out of favour and the rich residents had mostly headed for the North Shore. Many of the grand homes were knocked down in the 1920s and 30s and replaced with small art deco blocks of flats or <b>semi-detached</b> <b>houses.</b> A few remain, however, and are listed in the Landmarks section.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, Castle Vale had a {{population}} of around 20,000 people, with the first residents moving into their new homes in 1964. Many of the new residents were of Irish descent , previously living in inner-city slums such as Aston and Nechells. As well as high-rise tower blocks, Castle Vale also had 27 four-storey blocks of maisonettes, three-storey blocks of flats, over 100 bungalows and hundreds of terraced and <b>semi-detached</b> <b>houses.</b> All the houses had modern features that the houses of the slums lacked such as electricity, indoor toilets and central heating. Many of the houses also had gardens to the front and rear, whilst most of the flats in the tower blocks had private balconies.|$|E
25|$|For {{many years}} Bardsey Island formed {{part of the}} Newborough Estate, and between 1870 and 1875 the island's farms were rebuilt; a small {{limestone}} quarry was opened, and a lime kiln constructed. Carreg and Plas Bach are separate buildings, but the remaining eight were built as <b>semi-detached</b> <b>houses,</b> each pair with outbuildings set around a shared yard. The buildings are Grade II listed and, in 2008, Cadw approved a grant of £15,000 to cover {{the first phase of}} repairs. Only one of the original croglofft cottages, Carreg Bach, survives. Given the choice of a harbour or a new church, in 1875 the islanders asked the estate to provide a place of worship; a Methodist chapel was built.|$|E

25|$|Hopkinson {{was elected}} as a {{councillor}} on Audenshaw Council from 1917 to 1934 {{and led the}} council from 1923–24 and 1928-29. Long before it became fashionable, Hopkinson converted a derelict barn to a bungalow for his own home; he donated his former home of Ryecroft Hall (which he had bought in February 1913) {{to the people of}} Audenshaw and sixteen <b>semi-detached</b> <b>houses</b> on its land to Audenshaw Council (the Hall became a community centre as well as Audenshaw council's headquarters, and the houses were used for the housing of the working class). During the First World War he again enlisted and served in the Royal Dragoon Guards as a Second Lieutenant; in the later stages of the war he re-enlisted as a Trooper (the equivalent of Private) in the same unit.|$|E
25|$|By 1997, it was {{apparent}} that Eastgate Gardens had not been as well-designed as it could have been. City architects called the buildings poorly designed, and inappropriately sited. The District of Columbia Housing Authority now planned to raze and rebuild Eastgate. The city razed 34 of the 37 rowhouses at Eastgate Gardens in 1998, and the remaining three units in 2002. In 2004, the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development's HOPE VI low-income housing program awarded the District of Columbia $20 million to assist in the redevelopment of Eastgate Gardens. The city and private donors contributed another $56 million. Construction on the new complex, named Glenncrest, began in the fall of 2005. The city constructed 211 detached and <b>semi-detached</b> <b>houses,</b> 61 of them for rent to low- and moderate-income families, and the remainder available for purchase (outright or through a lease-to-own program) for low- and moderate-income families.|$|E
25|$|Such villas {{that were}} {{constructed}} {{in the area in}} the late 18th century included Regent's Place, built in the 1770s. This was leased by Matthew Boulton to James Watt and appears to be the earliest villa in the area. Watt stayed there from 1775 till 1790, before moving to Heathfield House in Handsworth. Key Hill House was {{constructed in the}} 1780s on Key Hill for Joshua Glover, a local merchant. In 1784, Sir Thomas Gooch leased out an estate on the northern side of Warstone Lane. Forrest's Brewery and two <b>semi-detached</b> <b>houses</b> were constructed on the plot. These houses were occupied by the owners of the brewery. On land owned by Samuel Lloyd and Edward Harford on the northeast side of Great Hampton Street, houses were constructed from the late 1780s. The land had been owned by Richard Parkes, an ironmaster from Wednesbury, from 1713 until it was passed to Lloyd and Harford. In 1750, Henry Carver purchased land on Summer Hill and in 1790 construction of a terrace of 15 houses commenced.|$|E
