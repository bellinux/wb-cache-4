He {{was the son}} of Bohemond I, who in 1108 {{was forced}} to <b>submit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{authority}} of the Byzantine Empire in the Treaty of Devol. Three years later, the infant Bohemond inherited the Principality of Taranto under the guardianship of his mother, Constance of France. The Principality of Antioch was administered by his father's nephew, Tancred, until 1111. Tancred's cousin, Roger of Salerno, managed the principality from 1111 to 1119.
