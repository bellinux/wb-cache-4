50|$|Early cars did {{not have}} batteries, as their {{electrical}} systems were limited. A bell was used instead of an electric horn, headlights were gas-powered, and the engine was started with a crank. Car batteries became widely used around 1920 as cars became equipped with electric starters. The <b>sealed</b> <b>battery,</b> which did not require refilling, was invented in 1971.|$|E
50|$|Since {{at least}} the mid-1960s, {{battery-operated}} electric razors have been available using rechargeable batteries sealed inside the razor's case, previously nickel cadmium or, more recently, nickel metal hydride. Some modern shavers use Lithium-ion batteries that do not suffer from memory effect. <b>Sealed</b> <b>battery</b> shavers either have built-in or external charging devices. Some shavers may be designed to plug directly into a wall outlet with a swing-out or pop-up plug, or have a detachable AC cord. Other shavers have recharging base units that plug into an AC outlet and provide DC power at the base contacts (eliminating {{the need for the}} AC-to-DC converter to be inside the razor, reducing the risk of electric shock).|$|E
5000|$|Some systems, {{operating}} at high temperature (Na-S) or using corrosive components {{are subject to}} failure {{even if they are}} not used (calendar ageing). Other technologies suffer from deterioration caused by charge-discharge cycles (cycle ageing), especially at high charging rates. These two types of ageing cause a loss of performance (capacity or voltage decrease), overheating and may eventually lead to critical failure (electrolyte leaks, fire, explosion). In order to prevent the loss of performance due to ageing, some batteries can undergo maintenance operation. For example, non-sealed Lead-acid batteries produce hydrogen and oxygen from the aqueous electrolyte when overcharged. The water has to be refilled regularly to avoid damage to the battery and the inflammable gases have to be vented out to avoid explosion risks. However, this maintenance has a cost and recent batteries, such as Li-Ion, are designed to have a long lifespan without maintenance. Therefore, most of the current systems are composed of securely <b>sealed</b> <b>battery</b> packs which are electronically monitored and replaced once their performance falls below a given threshold.|$|E

5000|$|BASE {{was first}} {{developed}} {{by researchers at}} the Ford Motor Company, in the search for a storage device for electric vehicles while developing the sodium-sulfur battery. The NaS battery consists of sulfur at the positive electrode and sodium at the negative electrode as active materials, and sodium-conducting beta alumina ceramic as the electrolyte separating both electrodes.This <b>sealed</b> <b>battery</b> is kept at approximately 300 degrees Celsius and is operated under the condition that the active materials at both electrodes are liquid and its electrolyte is solid. It is only at temperatures around 300 degrees Celsius or more, that it is possible for the negative sodium electrode to completely coat, or [...] "wet," [...] the ceramic electrolyte. At lower temperatures, molten sodium has issues in covering the surface of the beta alumina ceramic. This causes sodium to curl up akin to a drop of oil in water, reducing surface area contact and making the battery less efficient. At such high temperatures, since both active materials have high surface area contact and internal resistance becomes low enough, the NaS battery shows excellent performance. As a secondary battery, which allows reversible charging and discharging, the NaS battery can be continuously used. Several commercial installations use this type of battery for load leveling.|$|E
