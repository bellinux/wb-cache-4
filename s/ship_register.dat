5|$|Flag of {{convenience}} (FOC) {{is a business}} practice whereby a merchant ship is registered in a country other {{than that of the}} ship's owners, and the ship flies that country's civil ensign. Owners of a ship may register the ship under a flag {{of convenience}} to reduce operating costs or avoid the regulations of the owner's country. The closely related term open registry, which describes a <b>ship</b> <b>register</b> that will register foreign-owned ships, also exists.|$|E

25|$|The {{break-through}} for {{the ship}} registration {{came in the}} 1900–01 parliamentary session, when a private, alternative proposal was launched.< The latter instead involved establishing a series of local registers. The Ship Registration Act was approved by Parliament on 4 May 1901. A government commission looked into the detailed aspects of registration and the Council of State approved these on 23 July 1902. This resulted in about fifty district courts being given the task of maintaining local ship registers covering their jurisdiction. They were known by names such as Bergen <b>Ship</b> <b>Register.</b>|$|E
25|$|In late October 2012, it was {{reported}} that Sevmorput, which had been lying idle at the Atomflot base outside Murmansk since 2007, had been removed from the Russian <b>Ship</b> <b>Register</b> in July and would be sold for scrap. However, in December 2013 it {{was reported}} that the decision to decommission the nuclear-powered ship had been cancelled and that the vessel would be brought back to service by February 2016.

25|$|The {{process to}} {{establish}} a public <b>ship</b> <b>register</b> commenced in 1881. The background was that a bank was being considered which would have as its purpose to lend money to purchase ships. This would require a legal framework which would firmly establish ownership and collateral in ships. The Sea Law Commission was appointed in 1882 to consider this and other legal aspects of the shipping industry. It {{soon became clear that}} the commission would have ship registration as its main purpose, as other aspects of sea law had to be coordinated internationally. They reached a conclusion which resulted in an 1888 proposal for Parliament which was based on a single, central register for ships. Parliament decided not to consider the law, and similar proposals in 1892, 1893, 1894 and 1897 were similarly dismissed.|$|E

2500|$|When Ants Pärna, the {{director}} of the Estonian Maritime Museum, found out that Volynets was going to be scrapped, he decided to purchase the icebreaker for the museum in order to preserve it. After a long negotiation, the Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Navy agreed to trade the ship for 300 tons of scrap iron. On 10 October 1988, a delegation from the Estonian Maritime Museum arrived at Lomonosov to inspect the old icebreaker. When the seagoing tugboat Tjulen began towing her towards Tallinn in the following evening, the other ships in the port saluted the old icebreaker with their horns. 31 hours later, on 13 October 1988, Volynets dropped her anchor outside the port of Tallinn. On 21 November 1988, the icebreaker was given back her old name, Suur Tõll. On 24 August 1991, four days after Estonia regained full independence, she raised the blue-black-white flag of Estonia {{for the first time and}} on 23 December she became the first ship to be added to the newly founded Estonian <b>Ship</b> <b>Register</b> with register number 001.
