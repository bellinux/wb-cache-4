Preparing for the release, Netflix created eight different images to use as cover art for the season on its site.

Netflix also debuted a countdown timer to a percentage of its users worldwide, allowing them to <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> it was until the season would debut.

25|$|Next after fine colors, I like plain white. One of my sorrows, {{when the}} summer ends, is that I must put off my cheery and {{comfortable}} white clothes and enter {{for the winter}} into the depressing captivity of the shapeless and degrading black ones. It is mid-October now, and the weather is growing cold {{up here in the}} New Hampshire hills, but it will not succeed in freezing me out of these white garments, for here the neighbors are few, and it is only of crowds that I am afraid. I made a brave experiment, the other night, to see how it would feel to shock a crowd with these unseasonable clothes, and also to <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> it might take the crowd to reconcile itself to them and stop looking astonished and outraged. On a stormy evening I made a talk before a full house, in the village, clothed like a ghost, and looking as conspicuous, all solitary and alone on that platform, as any ghost could have looked; and I found, to my gratification, that it took the house less than ten minutes to forget about the ghost and give its attention to the tidings I had brought.I am nearly seventy-one, and I recognize that my age has given me a good many privileges; valuable privileges; privileges which are not granted to younger persons. Little by little I hope to get together courage enough to wear white clothes all through the winter, in New York. It will be a great satisfaction to me to show off in this way; and perhaps the largest of all the satisfactions will be the knowledge that every scoffer, of my sex, will secretly envy me and wish he dared to follow my lead.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reaction}} {{towards the}} character was generally mixed.

[...] In the third series, Mackenzie praised the episode where Tom tries to clear his name, but thought his exit was [...] "not particularly satisfying."

[...] Ted Kessler of NME lauded the album, calling it [...] "an album of outstanding natural beauty, an organic, wholesome work." [...] MacKenzie Wilson of AllMusic echoed the above comments, {{saying that it is}} a [...] "strong album". Wilson, who compliments Martin for his [...] "sharpened" [...] falsetto and refined [...] "haunting delivery" [...] and Buckland for his [...] "riveting guitar work", notes that [...] "regardless of the band still being in their mid-twenties, they've made an amazing record".

500|$|Garland and VFX {{supervisor}} Jon Thum began {{developing the}} Slo-Mo concept sequences in 2009 during filming for Never Let Me Go. They experimented with an effect {{to replicate the}} visual effects of hallucinogenic drugs to <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> {{it could be used}} before it distracted the viewer from the story or action sequence. They continued to develop and modify the effect until the end of post-production, tweaking colours, colour saturation, image framing and camera motion. Slo-Mo scenes also feature a rainbow colour scheme and sparkle highlights to create an unreal and otherworldly effect. The filmmakers experimented with blood bags, prosthetics, shooting real bullets, and compressed air to see the effect of direct body hits in slow motion. In the finished film, compressed air was used to create impact ripples on flesh. Garland said the concept was inspired by nature documentaries that used high-speed photography to capture animals in slow motion. He said, [...] "You see a whale or a shark breach the water...then you'd stop thinking about the animal and you get transfixed by...how water droplets connect and touch against each other. Somehow like a real [...] trip, sort of stepping outside it but staying attached at the same time." [...] He questioned whether the technique could be used with violence to make it purely aesthetic. He said: [...] "Can it be so abstract that it becomes genuinely beautiful? ...really aesthetically beautiful even if someone is having their cheek blown out or their head crushing into concrete." [...] Comic artist Jock provided concept art for the film design.|$|E
40|$|Severe acute {{respiratory}} syndrome (SARS) {{is a form}} of atypical pneumonia {{that apparently}} originated in Guangdong Province of the People&#x 2032;s Republic of China in late 2002. This first came to the world&#x 2032;s attention in late February 2003, and has since spread worldwide. As of June 23 rd 2003, the disease had been reported from 32 countries or regions globally, affecting 8459 people; 805 individuals (9. 5 &#x 0025; of the total affected) have died of the disease. A novel coronavirus, the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS- CoV) has been found in various specimens taken from patients with SARS. Although there has been rapid development of tests to detect SARS Co-V, these tests presently have certain limitations. Definitions of suspected, confirmed and probable cases have been formulated. Measures currently used for the management of patients with SARS include isolation, ribavirin, corticosteroid therapy and mechanical ventilation. Unfortunately, almost 10 &#x 0025; of affected patients succumb to their illness, underlying the need for developing more effective therapy.

40|$|Abstract: The {{evidence}} for gesture being a vital {{element in the}} classroom is becoming insurmountable; however, it remains to be <b>seen</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> it will take to be fully utilized in the EFL classroom. This study, using a qualitative descriptive methodology, briefly examines how a group of teachers perceive gesturing after viewing a video performance of an EFL practitioner. All of the data was collected online via a questionnaire and a recorded semi-structured interview. Volunteers were, or had been, teaching English within the past twelve months and approached the researcher {{to take part in the}} study via social media. The results of the study suggest that teachers fully acknowledge the importance of gesture and commonly attribute similar functions to specific gestures within a teaching performance. Overall, the results offer numerous pedagogical implications for gesture and SLA and support previous assertions regarding the need to make teachers fully aware of the gestures they use in the classroom. Analysis of the questionnaires also revealed that teachers seldom have the opportunity to view their own teaching and suggests that gesture needs to play a much greater role within critical reflective practice...|$|R

Daringly different, wildly sexy, and fabulously danceable, the record riveted listeners. When 'What'd I Say' came on the radio, some turned it off in disgust, but millions turned the volume up to blasting and sang 'Unnnh, unnnh, oooooh, oooooh' along with Ray and the Raelets. [...] became the life of a million parties, the spark of as many romances, and a song to date the Summer by." [...] The song's impact was not immediately seen in the U.S.; it was particularly popular in Europe. Paul McCartney was immediately struck by the song and knew when he heard it {{that he wanted to be}} involved in making music. George Harrison remembered an all-night party he attended in 1959 where the song was played for eight hours non-stop: [...] "It was one of the best records I ever heard." [...] While the Beatles were developing their sound in Hamburg, they played [...] "What'd I Say" [...] at every show, trying to <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> they could make the song last and using the audience in the call and response, with which they found immense popularity.

Macmillan later claimed in his memoirs that he had still expected Butler, his junior by eight years, to succeed Eden, but correspondence with Lord Woolton at the time makes clear that Macmillan was very much thinking of the succession.
