40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{describe}} the macroseismic, geological, and seismological manifestations of the strong earthquake that occurred in the south of the Gornyi (Mountainous) Altai area on September 27, 2003. The earthquake caused damage to buildings and constructions in the area of the Chuya and Kurai depressions and was accompanied by the manifestation of the earthquake source on the ground surface with the formation of a system of WNW-oriented faults, which has been traced over a distance of 20 km in the region of the eastward plunge of the North Chuya Range. Secondary seismic dislocations manifested themselves in the form of rockfalls, landslides, and griffons in the area of the pleistoseist zone. The results of the preliminary study of the tectonic position of the earthquake source suggest that the Gornyi Altai is a direct continuation of the Mongolia and Gobi Altai areas, where earthquakes with magnitudes of more than 7. 0 were recorded repeatedly, and allow us to combine all of the mountain systems of the Great Altai into one high-magnitude <b>seismotectonic</b> <b>province...</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractSeismic hazard {{assessment}} {{is a basic}} tool for rational planning and designing in areas of different seismic activity. The Bayesian probability estimation was applied in this study to assess seismic hazard. The estimation procedure provides a posterior probability distribution that integrates prior estimates based on {{the knowledge of the}} process, and the likelihood of occurrence based on historical data. The Bayesian approach was applied to calculate the probability that a certain cut-off magnitude would be exceeded at certain time intervals in different regions of Iran. The results for the cut-off magnitude of 6. 5 indicate that the highest probability of seismic hazard exists in the Alborz, Kopeh-Dagh, Bandar-Abas, Kerman, and Zagros regions. The seismic hazard is lowest for the Esfahan–Sirgan region, the Arabian Platform, the Persian Gulf, and Kavir in Central Iran. The comparison between the Bayesian results and the seismotectonic models of Iran reveals {{that it is possible to}} partition the spatially distributed epicenters of earthquake events into different regions. In general, these regional divisions agree with previously proposed <b>seismotectonic</b> <b>provinces</b> of Iran...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{research results}} of the study which aim is to reveal and quantitatively describe fractal properties of the European-Mediterranean seismotectonic model applied for seismic hazard assessment of the region under study. Several <b>seismotectonic</b> <b>provinces</b> are defined, and their nonlinear properties are calculated using both linear elements (boundaries of seismogenic units) and surface areas of the seismogenic units. The research is conducted on the basis of only formal relationships, not with data on real fault structures or other seismogenic elements, as the relationships have been accepted for seismic hazard calculations by the team of SESAME Project (Project Leader M. Jimenec) and published by Jimenec et al. [2001]. Special attention is paid to the Balkan seismotectonic model in order to develop a common seismotectonic model which uses data from the seismic hazard map for a period of 475 years (according the EUROCODE 8), that was published in Muco et al. [2008]. All the calculations considered only the seismogenic units located in the earth crust, but not deeper seismogenic layers. It is concluded that most of the seismogenic provinces are similar in their fractal properties, which varied in a narrow range, except for the Adriatic one. The formal approach does not permit to explain these peculiarities. </p...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{is one in}} a series of topical reports compiled by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory to summarize technical information on selected topics important to the performance of a probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA) of the Hanford Site. The purpose of this report is to summarize available data and analyses relevant to the Yakima Fold Belt (YFB) that may bear {{on the question of whether}} or not the YFB behaves as a single <b>seismotectonic</b> <b>province</b> in which activity along one fold structure is representative of behavior along all other fold structures. This topic has met with a fairly high level of contention in the expert community and has the potential to result in significant impacts on an evaluation of seismic hazard at the Hanford Site. This report defines the relevant alternative conceptual models relevant to this technical issue and the arguments and data that support those models. It provides a brief description of the technical issue and principal uncertainties; a general overview on the nature of the technical issue, along with alternative conceptual models, supporting arguments and information, and uncertainties; and finally, it suggests some possible approaches for reducing uncertainties regarding this issue...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new seismogenic {{interpretation}} of mainland and central-southern Sicily, {{based on an}} integrated structural–kinematic–seismological approach. Through analysis of available structural and geophysical data, the tectonic setting, the major kinematic units and the crust geometry of the Sicilian southward-verging fold-and-thrust belt system are schematized in sections and in map form. The depth-contour lines of the outermost basal thrust plane, which dates back to Plio-Pleistocene times with some evidence of Holocene activity, are reconstructed. This plane, here named Sicilian Basal Thrust (SBT), emerges along the southward convex Sciacca–Gela–Catania front and reaches {{the base of the}} crust at a depth of about 30 km beneath northern Sicily. Additionally, an important regional upper crust splay, with the same arched shape, has been identified some kilometres northward. In order to detect any possible indication of seismogenic activity linked to ongoing deformation of the SBT and its splay, we analyzed the distribution and kinematics of the instrumental seismicity in the period between 1981 and 2006. Particular attention was given to the background seismicity (Ml up to 4. 6) located beneath the sedimentary cover at Mt. Etna, as it allows individuating a northward deepening seismogenic volume undergoing an average N–S compression, which corresponds well with the SBT geometry in section view. A merged dataset of all the known major historical and instrumental events (moment magnitude ≥ 4. 5) that occurred above the SBT 0 -to- 30 km depth-contour lines from 217 B. C. to 2006 was compiled and analyzed. Based on information from instrumental data and/or on speculations on the shape and extent of the historical earthquake macroseismic fields, two major ranges of hypocentral depths have been schematically identified within the merged dataset: an upper crust range (in average b~ 10 km) and a mid-to-lower crust range. Focal mechanisms available in the literature show prevailing reverse and reverse-oblique kinematics, compatible with a nearly average N–S shortening and with some field evidence of active fold-and- thrust deformation at the SBT front and along its inner splay. Several moderate earthquakes (nearly 40 in the last 400 years with moment magnitude ranging from 4. 5 to 5. 5) and a few more energetic events with moment magnitude up to ~ 6. 0, such as the Mineo 1624, the Belice 1968 and the Catania 1818 events, can be attributed to an ongoing activity of the SBT. In previous studies, these events had been often attributed to isolated N–S strike-slip sources located within the Hyblean-Pelagian foreland, while all the interposed areas had been considered aseismic, as well as the SBT had been considered inactive. The identification in the SBT of a unique regional-scale seismogenic structure capable to connect the active deformation and the seismic activity of the western, central and eastern areas of mainland Sicily and those of central-southern Sicily evidently has strong implications in terms of seismic hazard assessment. In fact, it allows the definition of a new homogeneous compressional <b>seismotectonic</b> <b>province,</b> which extends between the SBT surface front line and the surface projection of the 25 km SBT depth-contour line. A subdivision in two sub-provinces, a shallow one above the 0 – 10 km SBT segment and a deep one above the 10 -to- 25 km SBT segment, is also considered and the energy released of the associate earthquakes evaluated. To conclude, the proposed model is discussed in comparison with other models from the literature and some important open problems are put forwards...|$|E
40|$|Remarkable {{variations}} in moderate–large seismicity {{during the last}} two centuries in Zagros and eastern Iran <b>seismotectonic</b> <b>provinces</b> have chronically been investigated, in this study. The time variations of seismic hazards [macroseismic maximum intensity and scalar moment of the earthquakes (I 0 > IV; M > 5. 0) ] were investigated as seismic behaviours for the study area. According to the fact that damage of an earthquake is strongly influenced by the depth of the event, depths of some of the historical and pre-instrumental earthquakes were reasonably estimated using macroseismic data. Processing the data of earthquakes reliably demonstrated that relatively quiet periods have happened and have subsequently been followed by active periods with various durations in south of Iran. According to both patterns of the temporal variations of seismicity and the seismic hazards, we are within a decelerating seismic deformation and we may expect an accelerating seismic deformation in the next decades. Moreover, in both areas, we discovered a manifest migration of the seismicity from the northeast to the southwest region that is a significant phenomenon in seismology. Finally, two seismic gaps at specific time periods in northwest of Zagros, Dasht-e Bayaz and Ferdows areas at the eastern Iran were also found...|$|R
40|$|The Collaboratory for the Study of Earthquake Predictability (CSEP) {{selected}} Italy as {{a testing}} region for probabilistic earthquake forecast models in October, 2008. The model we have submitted {{for the two}} medium-term forecast periods of 5 and 10 years (from 2009) is a time-dependent, geologically based earthquake rupture forecast that is defined for central Italy only (11 - 15 ˚ E; 41 - 45 ˚ N). The model took into account three separate layers of seismogenic sources: background seismicity; seismotectonic provinces; and individual faults that can produce major earthquakes (seismogenic boxes). For CSEP testing purposes, the background seismicity layer covered a range of magnitudes from 5. 0 to 5. 3 and the seismicity rates were obtained by truncated Gutenberg-Richter relationships for cells centered on the CSEP grid. Then the <b>seismotectonic</b> <b>provinces</b> layer returned the expected rates of medium-to-large earthquakes following a traditional Cornell-type approach. Finally, for the seismogenic boxes layer, the rates {{were based on the}} geometry and kinematics of the faults that different earthquake recurrence models have been assigned to, ranging from pure Gutenberg-Richter behavior to characteristic events, with the intermediate behavior named as the hybrid model. The results for different magnitude ranges highlight the contribution of each of the three layers to the total computation. The expected rates for M &gt; 6. 0 on April 1, 2009 (thus computed before the L'Aquila, 2009, MW= 6. 3 earthquake) are of particular interest. They showed local maxima in the two seismogenic-box sources of Paganica and Sulmona, one of which was activated by the L'Aquila earthquake of April 6, 2009. Earthquake rates as of August 1, 2009, (now under test) also showed a maximum close to the Sulmona source for MW ~ 6. 5; significant seismicity rates (10 - 4 to 10 - 3 in 5 years) for destructive events (magnitude up to 7. 0) were located in other individual sources identified as being capable of such earthquakes in the central part of this area of the Apennines...|$|R
