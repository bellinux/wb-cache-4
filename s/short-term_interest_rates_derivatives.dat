40|$|The {{supply of}} {{treasury}} bills has fallen considerably since 1995, reflecting {{a decline in}} the financing needs of the Canadian government and a change in its debt-management strategy. This has had a major impact on different segments of the money market. Among the various implications of this development, the authors point out the decrease in turnover and, hence, liquidity in the treasury bill market since 1995, as well as high rates of growth in the market for <b>short-term</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>derivatives</b> and for <b>short-term</b> asset-backed securities. ...|$|R
5000|$|LIFFE had had {{big plans}} to expand, and {{intended}} to redevelop Spitalfields Market in the City of London as {{they needed a}} larger building for their open outcry. With {{the loss of the}} market for their main product, Bund futures contracts, all expansion plans were shelved. LIFFE realised that, to compete, it had urgently to develop an electronic trading platform instead. It already had an electronic platform called Automated Pit Trading (APT), which was used in after-hours trading when the trading pit was closed. LIFFE now developed a new trading platform, LIFFE CONNECT, for all trading, including the exchange's range of <b>short-term</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>derivatives</b> contracts. After the creation of the euro in 1999 the exchange won the lion's share of trading in euro-denominated <b>short-term</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>derivatives</b> - the EURIBOR contract. On Friday 24 November 2000, at 5 pm, the last three of the once 26 open outcry pits were permanently closed. The design of LIFFE CONNECT made it possible for customers to choose which trading software they would use. LIFFE intended that this flexibility would encourage traders around the world to link to the exchange. And, by the beginning of 2002, customers in 25 countries around the world were trading on LIFFE. This completed a revolution in LIFFE's business: whereas traders had once had to come to LIFFE; now, through LIFFE CONNECT, LIFFE took its market to its customers wherever they were in the world.|$|R
40|$|<b>Short-term</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>derivatives</b> {{present a}} few {{unresolved}} problems. It is not obvious which pricing model to use, {{and the usual}} Heath-Jarrow-Morton type models seem insufficient to describe the risk they entail. Moreover, the hedging process is fairly delicate as the liquidity of short-term products cannot always be relied upon. In this paper, we justify {{the use of a}} market model with jumps to price these products. The main advantage of this approach is two fold. First, we will show how realistic such a model proves to be. Then, using justified approximations, the market model with jumps is made very tractable. Finally, the hedging issue is resolved by describing a dynamic delta-hedging strategy provided by the model in addition to a static vega-hedging strategy designed to use the relevant liquid products at the trader's disposal. ...|$|R
40|$|M. Com. (Financial Economics) Recently, {{there has}} been a growth in the bond market. This growth has brought with it an {{ever-increasing}} volume and range of <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> depended <b>derivative</b> products known as <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>derivatives.</b> Amongst the variables used in pricing these derivative products is the <b>short-term</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate.</b> A numbers of <b>short-term</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> models that are used to fit the <b>short-term</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> exist. Therefore, understanding the features characterised by various <b>short-term</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> models, and determining the best fitting models is crucial as this variable is fundamental in pricing <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>derivatives,</b> which further determine the decision making of economic agents. This dissertation examines various <b>short-term</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> models in continuous time in order to determine which model best fits the South African <b>short-term</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b> Both the linear and nonlinear <b>short-term</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> models were estimated.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to propose a nonparametric <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> term {{structure}} model and investigate its implications on term structure dynamics and prices of <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>derivative</b> securities. The nonparametric spot <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> process is estimated from the observed <b>short-term</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> following a robust estimation procedure and the market price of <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> risk is estimated as implied from the historical term structure data. That is, instead of imposing a priori restrictions on the model, data are allowed to speak for themselves, and at the same time the model retains a parsimonious structure and the computational tractability. The model is implemented using historical Canadian <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> term structure data. The parametric models with closed form solutions for bond and bond option prices, namely the Vasicek (1977) and CIR (1985) models, are also estimated for comparison purpose. The empirical results not only provide strong evidence that the traditional spot <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> models and market prices of <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> risk are severely misspecified but also suggest that different model specifications have significant impact on term structure dynamics and prices of <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>derivative</b> securities. ...|$|R
