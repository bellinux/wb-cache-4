500|$|I was {{surprised}} I got that call 'cause of our {{differences in the}} audiences we hit, but I'm always up for challenges and trying something new ... She described what her album is about and then <b>she</b> <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> some CDs of what type of stuff's been inspiring her to make the record, and {{it happened to be}} a lot of stuff that I grew up on in the early '70s, 'cause I'm 40. Aretha Franklin, Etta James, Marvin Gaye, Esther Williams, all kinds of different things. Once I saw that's the vibe she wanted, I still had to make it sound like the way my beats thump and stuff but still give her the atmosphere she's trying to bring out on the singing side.|$|E
500|$|... "Guy Love" [...] was {{composed}} by Fordham and Perry. It was a late {{addition to the}} episode, brought on because, according to Bill Lawrence, [...] "All the modern musicals like Jekyll & Hyde have these really overwrought love songs, so {{we really wanted to}} have one between J.D. and Turk." [...] It was the hardest song for Fordham to write. She met with Perry for help with the lyrics, and he gave her the hook, [...] "It's guy love, between two guys." [...] The writing became easier, but she still wanted a reference to a tender moment between Turk and J.D. She emailed D'Abruzzo, who she knew to be a big fan of the show, [...] "and, no exaggeration, five minutes later, <b>she</b> <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> a list of 30 [...] ", [...] including Turk performing an appendectomy on J.D. in [...] "My Day Off". [...] At first, the song {{was meant to be a}} power ballad.|$|E
500|$|A piano version also {{appeared}} on the DVD single, which was assisted in its creation by Nico Muhly. During an interview he stated, [...] "When Björk asked me to play piano on Oceania, <b>she</b> <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> the music, {{and it was as}} complicated and layered as any piece of classical music I've played. I spent a few days figuring out how to make her vision of 'dueling lounge-lizard pianists' physically possible, and in the session, we ran through those quickly. Then, she experimented with different ways to space the progression of chords that runs through the piece - I suggested big, Brahmsy blocks - as well as the ending, for which we tried diaphanous, Debussy-like arpeggios". Björk decided to stick with the album's vocal concept and use electronically tweaked choral voices. Before some last-minute polishing by Mark Bell, this version of [...] "Oceania" [...] was the last track to be worked for Medúlla.|$|E
6000|$|Nick {{glanced at}} her; she sat {{watching}} him. [...] "She has <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> a stall; I wish <b>she</b> had <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> two. I {{should have been}} delighted to take you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Precisely"--he {{felt himself}} wonderful; [...] "and I {{wanted to be}} no less. <b>She</b> <b>sent</b> for <b>me,</b> I went to her, and that night I left Venice." ...|$|R
6000|$|Fan {{looked at}} her, puzzled and {{surprised}} at the question. [...] "But you say <b>she</b> <b>sent</b> for <b>me</b> to shut me up because she hated me, and never wished to see me again." ...|$|R
500|$|As a teenager, Cruz became {{interested}} in acting after seeing the film Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down! (1990) by Spanish director Pedro Almodóvar. She did casting calls for an agent but was rejected multiple times because the agent {{felt that she was}} too young. Cruz commented on the experience, [...] "I was very extroverted as a kid.... I was studying when I was in high school at night, I was in ballet and I was doing castings. I looked for an agent and <b>she</b> <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> away three times because I was a little girl but I kept coming back. I'm still with her after all these years." [...] In 1989, at the age of 15, Cruz won an audition at a talent agency over more than 300 other girls. In 1999, Katrina Bayonas, Cruz's agent, commented, [...] "She was absolutely magic [...] It was obvious there was something very impressive about this kid.... She was very green, but there was a presence. There was just something coming from within." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Little Things" [...] {{was written}} by British singer-songwriters Ed Sheeran and Fiona Bevan, and {{produced}} by Jake Gosling. In February 2012, One Direction expressed interest in working with Sheeran for their second studio album. In June 2012, Sheeran disclosed that One Direction would be recording two of his songs. In October 2012, Sheeran acknowledged Bevan's songwriting credit {{in an interview with}} British radio network Capital FM: [...] "The great thing about it is I wrote that song with a girl called Fiona Bevan when I was 17 and we lost the song. I've kept in touch with Fiona, we've done gigs and stuff and about two months ago <b>she</b> <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> the tune and was like, 'Oh, do you remember this?' I was like, 'Yeah, I do remember that', and I was in the studio with the One Direction boys at the time and I was playing it and they were like, 'We really like that'. It's got one of my favourite lines that I've ever written in a song." [...] On 15 October 2012, Louis Tomlinson confirmed via social networking website Twitter that [...] "Little Things" [...] would serve as the second single of their second studio album Take Me Home.|$|E
2500|$|I {{wrote to}} her {{suggesting}} that she should fill a gap in our Irish Church Hymnal by giving us a metrical version of St. Patrick's 'Lorica' and I sent her a carefully collated copy of the best prose translations of it. Within a week <b>she</b> <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> that exquisitely beautiful as well as faithful version which appears in the appendix to our Church Hymnal." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{never has}} been to see me since that day, and--but I hoped she'd come and see <b>me,</b> but <b>she</b> never <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> any {{invitation}} to her wedding." [...] She choked with sobs {{at the memory of}} it.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, really, I don't {{think she}} cared much about it; but I {{had to give}} her {{something}}, because <b>she</b> had <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> something the year before, and I {{did not want to}} send a paltry present to one in her circumstances." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps so. Edith {{heard some}} {{nonsense}} at Backsworth, and mamma could not rest till <b>she</b> had <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> {{over to see}} about it; but would there be any great harm in it if it were true? Is not Lady Susan a super-excellent woman?" ...|$|R
60|$|I don't {{know what}} I should do if <b>she</b> <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> about my business. I'd rather {{continue}} in this awful uncertainty than lose all hope for ever.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{since the}} letter <b>she</b> <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> {{when she reached}} the mine, and you saw that. I'm getting anxious. She has stopped some time and the school has reopened." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have no master," [...] {{said the}} Blind Boy, [...] "My mother, 'Dame Venus' they do call; Cowled in this hood <b>she</b> <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> begging [...] For whate'er in pity may befall.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sent</b> for <b>me</b> betimes, and I went in {{fear and}} {{trembling}} of her wrath and scorn. How shall I speak of that interview? How shall I describe the immeasurable contempt with which she visited me, and which I felt was perhaps no more than I deserved.|$|R
6000|$|... "Señor, {{she knows}} you are here. Santos watched {{for you and}} hastened in to inform her of your arrival. Now <b>she</b> has <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> out only {{to say that she}} cannot meet you, that she thanks you for all you have done, and begs you to go away and leave her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'O, Miss Aldclyffe's companion. Then {{will you}} be kind enough to take a {{subscription}} to her? <b>She</b> <b>sent</b> to <b>me</b> this afternoon {{to ask me to}} become a subscriber to her Society, and I was out. Of course I'll subscribe if she wishes it. I take a great interest in the Society.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd {{be a bad}} 'un if I wasn't. She took {{me out of the}} work'us without {{character}} or nothing, and now she's a-educatin' of me. <b>She</b> <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> 'ere with a message?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She begs {{you will}} not!" [...] {{the young man}} replied. [...] "She sends you her love; <b>she</b> <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> to {{announce}} her. She will come and pay her respects to your father." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Her ladyship {{knows that}} I am ill-treated in this matter. <b>She</b> <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> £50 and I {{returned}} it. It {{was not in}} that way that I wished {{to be paid for}} my services." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{expected}} it, dearie," [...] said old Nell, extending her withered {{hand to the}} boy as he set {{the basket}} on the table. [...] "Every Christmas morning, for years gone by, <b>she</b> has <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> the same, though I don't deserve it, and I've no claim on her but helplessness. But it's the first time <b>she</b> has <b>sent</b> it by you, Jack. Come, I'll tell ye a story." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was in {{the month}} of June, 17--. For thirty long, long years, I {{supposed}} my child had actually died; and then the mere force of conscience told me the truth. The wretched woman could not carry the secret with her into the grave, and <b>she</b> <b>sent</b> for <b>me</b> to hear the sad revelation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lord," [...] {{said the}} damsel, [...] "it matters not who I am, saving that I am {{of the court}} of a {{wonderful}} lady who is your very good friend. <b>She</b> hath <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> here to meet you and to beseech you {{to come with me}} whither I shall lead you, and I shall lead you unto her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't believe Miss West would. You don't {{know her}} as well as I do, Una. Just think of that sweet little bird <b>she</b> <b>sent</b> <b>me.</b> I love it far more even than Adam." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sorry {{to disturb}} you, Louis," [...] I said. [...] "Miss Delora {{is in the}} little smoking-room, and Bartot is there,--just arrived, I suppose, from Paris. He is terrifying her. <b>She</b> <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> to fetch you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{send this}} one to Maria Gilman, for <b>she</b> <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> the necktie, an' you can all copy it." [...] Then Tom read the {{following}} letter, which he had written while the others had been talking: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{the general}} sympathy had {{penetrated}} to Mrs. Westangle, though I don't {{say that she}} had been more than negatively indifferent to Miss Shirley's claim on her before. As it was, <b>she</b> <b>sent</b> for <b>me</b> to her room the next morning, and I found Miss Shirley alone there. She said Mrs. Westangle would be down in a moment." ...|$|R
60|$|Did Henrietta {{tell you}} that I heard at last from Miss Martineau, who thought me in Italy, she said, and {{therefore}} was silent? <b>She</b> has <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> her new work (have you read it?) and speaks of her strength and {{of being able to}} walk fifteen miles a day, which seems to me like a fairy tale, or the 'Three-leagued Boots' at least.|$|R
5000|$|This morning <b>she</b> <b>sent</b> for <b>me,</b> that I {{might be}} with her at such time as she {{received}} the good Lord, to the intent I should hear her speak as touching her innocency alway to be clear. And {{in the writing of}} this <b>she</b> <b>sent</b> for <b>me,</b> and at my coming she said, 'Mr. Kingston, I hear I shall not die afore noon, and I am very sorry therefore, for I thought to be dead by this time and past my pain.' I told her it should be no pain, it was so little. And then she said, 'I heard say the executioner was very good, and I have a little neck,' and then put her hands about it, laughing heartily. I have seen many men and also women executed, and that they have been in great sorrow, and to my knowledge this lady has much joy in death. Sir, her almoner is continually with her, and had been since two o'clock after midnight.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was with}} father and mother. <b>She</b> <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> {{to them that}} morning, with a letter. I don't know what was in it. Perhaps there was money," [...] said Verena, who evidently now would tell him everything.|$|E
6000|$|... "As a {{proof that}} I {{was the man}} I assumed to be, I took with me a ring of no great value, but set with her royal seal, which she had given me when <b>she</b> <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> to Otto.|$|E
6000|$|... "The kind {{messages}} <b>she</b> <b>sent</b> <b>me!</b> The {{pleasant surprise}} she has prepared for me!" [...] repeated the minister's {{son in a}} hard, dry tone. [...] "My lord will be pleased {{to tell me how}} she heard of my name?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your aunt {{is sure to}} ask {{you what}} I have said. I have tried her temper; you know what her temper is! <b>She</b> has <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> here instead of sending a maid, on the chance that I may commit some imprudence. I give you her message exactly as the servant might have given it--and you can tell her so with a safe conscience. No more questions!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{a little}} after that Dulphemia and Charlie Mostyn and I were walking to Mrs. Buncomhearst's musical, and we'd only just started along the street, when <b>she</b> stopped and <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> back for her music--me, mind you, not Charlie. That seems to me awfully significant." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well; yes. It is her message. I shouldn't in such {{a matter}} invent it all if <b>she</b> hadn't <b>sent</b> <b>me.</b> I don't know, now I think of it, that she did say {{anything}} about her own age. But yet she did," [...] remarked Mr. O'Mahony, calling to mind the assertion made by Rachel that she wanted Frank Jones. Frank Jones was about her own age, whereas the lord was as old as her father.|$|R
