In some, both A and B are always open circuit at the detents, and an entire 00 → 00 <b>switching</b> <b>cycle</b> occurs while transitioning from one detent to the next.

3000|$|Normally, an {{appliance}} operates up to {{a certain}} number of <b>switching</b> <b>cycles</b> in its lifetime. Therefore, the number of <b>switching</b> <b>cycles,</b> [...] S_i, can be a measure of the thermal cell lifetime, similar to the way battery lifetime can be measured by the number of battery cycles.

50|$|A {{push-pull}} converter {{is a type}} of DC-to-DC converter, a switching converter {{that uses}} a transformer to change the voltage of a DC power supply. The distinguishing feature of a push-pull converter is that the transformer primary is supplied with current from the input line by pairs of transistors in a symmetrical push-pull circuit. The transistors are alternately switched on and off, periodically reversing the current in the transformer. Therefore current is drawn from the line during both halves of the <b>switching</b> <b>cycle.</b> This contrasts with buck-boost converters, in which the input current is supplied by a single transistor which is switched on and off, so current is only drawn from the line during half the <b>switching</b> <b>cycle.</b> During the other half the output power is supplied by energy stored in inductors or capacitors in the power supply. Push-pull converters have steadier input current, create less noise on the input line, and are more efficient in higher power applications.|$|E
50|$|This {{allows for}} a number of {{switching}} loss savings. The inductor is given known levels of peak current, which if chosen carefully in regards to saturation current can reduce switching losses in its magnetic core. Since the inductor current is never allowed to fall below zero, the output filter capacitor is not discharged and {{does not have to be}} recharged with every <b>switching</b> <b>cycle</b> to maintain the proper output voltage.|$|E

50|$|Away {{from the}} plane in those regions where {{only one or two}} {{relatively}} narrow CO lines are found, frequency-switching by 10-20 MHz at a rate of 1 Hz was often used instead of position switching. Since spectral lines remain within the range of the spectrometer in both phases of the <b>switching</b> <b>cycle,</b> data could be obtained twice as fast as with position switching, although higher order polynomials, typically 4th or 5th order, were required to remove the residual baseline. A telluric emission line from CO in the mesosphere, variable in both intensity and LSR velocity, is detected in frequency-switched spectra; because the LSR velocity of the line could be predicted exactly, blending with Galactic emission could be avoided by appropriate scheduling of the observations. In a few cases of large surveys (e.g., Taurus and Orion) a model of the telluric line was fit daily to spectra free of Galactic emission and used to remove the line from all spectra.|$|E

40|$|By reverse-engineering we have {{detected}} eight kinetic {{phases of the}} symmetric <b>switch</b> <b>cycle</b> of the Halobacterium salinarum flagellar motor assembly and identified those steps in the <b>switch</b> <b>cycle</b> that are controlled by sensory rhodopsins during phototaxis. Upon switching the rotational sense, the flagellar motor assembly passes through a stop state from which all subunits synchronously resume rotation in the reverse direction. The assembly then synchronously proceeds through three subsequent functional states of the switch: Refractory, Competent, and Active, from which the rotational sense is switched again. Sensory control of the symmetric <b>switch</b> <b>cycle</b> occurs at two steps in each rotational sense by inversely regulating the probabilities for a change from the Refractory to the Competent and from Competent to the Active rotational mode. We provide a mathematical model for flagellar motor switching and its sensory control, which is able to explain all tested experimental results on spontaneous and light-controlled motor switching, and give a mechanistic explanation based on synchronous conformational transitions of the subunits of the switch complex after reversible dissociation and binding of a response regulator (CheYP). We conclude that the kinetic mechanism of flagellar motor switching and its sensory control is fundamentally different in the archaeon H. salinarum and the bacterium Escherichia coli...|$|R
