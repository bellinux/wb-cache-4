Our {{understanding of the}} neurobiology of narcolepsy has greatly improved over the last decade. This knowledge has not yet translated into additional therapeutic options for patients, but progress is being made. Some compounds, such as histaminergic H 3 receptor antagonists, may prove useful in symptom control of narcolepsy. The prospect of finding a cure still seems distant, but hypocretin replacement therapy offers some promise. In this narrative review, we describe these developments and others which may yield more effective narcolepsy treatments in the future.

40|$|Cognitive {{models of}} {{insomnia}} have received growing support {{in recent years}} and are embraced by the current diagnostic framework. Many people with insomnia report that mental events, such as intrusive thoughts or a racing mind, prevent them from achieving or maintaining sleep. Dysfunctional cognition may {{play an important role in}} perpetuating insomnia, with many individuals with psychophysiological insomnia reporting a distorted perception of sleep. Neurocognitive studies have indicated that high-frequency EEG activity associated with cognitive processes is enhanced in patients with insomnia at or around sleep onset, which may distort the individual's judgement about sleep initiation and duration. A subtype of psychophysiological insomnia has been proposed [...] attention-intention-effort (AIE) syndrome [...] that takes into consideration the interaction between behavioral and cognitive factors in the development and maintenance of insomnia. A series of studies from the University of Glasgow <b>Sleep</b> <b>Centre</b> using cognitive probe tasks has provided insight into this pathway, particularly with regard to the role of attention bias towards sleep stimuli in mediating insomnia. Further research is required to explore the cortical correlates of attention bias, investigate AIE as a potential causal mechanism of insomnia and examine AIE in other insomnia groups...|$|E
40|$|Psychophysiological {{insomnia}} (PI) is {{the most}} common insomnia subtype, representing 12 - 15 % of all <b>sleep</b> <b>centre</b> referrals. Diagnostic guidelines describe PI as an intrinsic sleep disorder involving both hyperarousal and learned sleep-preventing associations. Whilst evidence for the first component is reasonably compelling, evidence for learned (conditioned) sleep effects is markedly lacking. Indeed, to date no study has attempted to capture directly the conditioned arousal effect assumed to characterize the disorder. Accordingly, the present study explored variations in subjective arousal over time in 15 PI participants (sleep onset type) and 15 normal sleepers (NS). Self-report measures of cognitive arousal, somatic arousal and sleepiness were taken at three time points: 3 h before bedtime (early to mid-evening); 1 h before bedtime (late evening); and in the bedroom at lights out (bedtime) across four, 24 -h cycles. Fluctuations in mean arousal and sleepiness values, and in day-to-day variation were examined using analyses of variance. Participants with PI were significantly more cognitive aroused and significantly less sleepy relative to NS, within the bedroom environment. These results support the tenet of conditioned mental arousal to the bedroom, although competing explanations cannot be ruled out. Results are discussed with reference to extant insomnia models...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{frequent}} complaints in psychiatric disorders is insom-nia 1, but also the reverse holds true, i. e., sleep disturbances, including {{a wide range of}} disorders like insomnia, hypersomnia, restless legs/peri-odic limb movements during sleep (PLMS), obstructive sleep apnea, and parasomnias, are frequently associated with psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, insomnia may underlie other sleep disorders. Restless legs syndrome (RLS) can cause difficulty in sleep onset, while unsatisfactory sleep with repeated awakenings can be related to sleep respiratory disor-ders or, possibly, to periodic limb movements disorder (PLMD). Insomnia is often reported by patients affected by depression, anxiety and mania 1. Recently, lamotrigine has been reported to be effective in bipolar depression associated with a broad spectrum of physical and emotional symptoms, including restless legs syndrome and parkinso-nian symptoms 2. Lamotrigine has been proposed to treat restless legs syndrome 2. An 11 -year-old girl with RLS and depressive symptoms has been successfully treated with ropinirole 3. We present here the unusual case of a young girl with symptoms of agitated depression who complained severe insomnia and was referred to our <b>Sleep</b> <b>Centre</b> because her sleep was too short.

30|$|Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) {{is a major}} sleep {{disorder}} causing by the repetitive collapses {{of upper}} airway during sleep. OSA is associated with many health problems such as cardiovascular and metabolic diseases [22] including diabetes [35], coronary heart diseases [16], cancer [5] with finally {{an increased risk of}} mortality [5]. It is also known a heterogeneous disease with different symptoms and comorbidities for patients exhibiting the same level of OSA severity [21]. Thus, recent studies aim at better allocate patients into well-defined subgroups (i.e., phenotypes) based on clinical information such as symptoms, comorbidities, and demographics using clustering methods [20, 39, 41]. This can help to improve the clinical management and to define personalized treatments at time of diagnosis. For example, in [44], a Latent Class Analysis (LCA) is used to identify groups of patients in the Icelandic Sleep Apnea Cohort including 822 patients with moderate-to-severe OSA. A similar strategy is employed for 922 patients recruited from the Sleep Apnea Global Interdisciplinary Consortium (SAGIC) [21]. Hierarchical clustering is employed in [1] for analyzing diagnosis data of 18, 263 OSA patients. In [23], a relationship graph is built upon 198 patients collected from the <b>Sleep</b> <b>Centre</b> at the University of Foggia from 2012 to 2014 and patients are grouped using community detection algorithms. All of these approaches, however, do not incorporate domain knowledge into the clustering processes to improve the clustering quality. Moreover, they are only able to process static data, e.g., questionnaires [44] or a diagnosis visit data [1]. However, patients’ responses to treatments and associated compilations are not static and change during clinical courses. Tracking these changes will provide more insights into disease progression and prognosis [1]. However, all existing techniques are not specifically designed to capture the evolution of patient cohorts over time.|$|E
40|$|Prostaglandin (PG) D 2 {{is a major}} prostanoid in {{the brains}} of rats and other mammals, {{including}} humans. When PGD synthase (PGDS), the enzyme that produces PGD 2 in the brain, was inhibited by the intracerebroventricular infusion of its selective inhibitors, i. e. tetravalent selenium compounds, the amount of sleep decreased both time and dose dependently. The amount of sleep of transgenic mice, in which the human PGDS gene had been incorporated, increased several fold under appropriate conditions. These data indicate that PGDS is a key enzyme in sleep regulation. In situ hybridization, immunoperoxidase staining and direct enzyme activity determination of tissue samples revealed that PGDS is hardly detectable in the brain parenchyma but is localized in the membrane systems surrounding the brain, namely, the arachnoid membrane and choroid plexus, from which it is secreted into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to become beta-trace, a major protein component of the CSF. PGD 2 exerts its somnogenic activity by binding to PGD 2 receptors exclusively localized at the ventrorostral surface of the basal forebrain. When PGD 2 was infused into the subarachnoid space below the rostral basal forebrain, striking expression of proto-oncogene Fos immunoreactivity (FosIR) was observed in the ventrolateral preoptic area (VLPO), a putative <b>sleep</b> <b>centre,</b> concurrent with sleep induction. Fos expression in the VLPO {{was positively correlated with}} the preceding amount of sleep and negatively correlated with Fos expression in the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN), a putative wake centre. These observations suggest that PGD 2 may induce sleep via leptomeningeal PGD 2 receptors with subsequent activation of the VLPO neurons and downregulation of the wake neurons in the TMN area. Adenosine may be involved in the signal transduction associated with PGD 2...|$|E

Patients and methods: Face-to-face concept elicitation and cognitive interviews were conducted with children (7 – 9  years; n= 13) and adolescents (10 – 17  years; n= 16) who have narcolepsy with cataplexy, and their parents/caregivers. Results: Similarities and differences were noted between narcolepsy concepts described by children and their parents/caregivers, suggesting some different but complementary perspectives; parents may not recognize cataplexy symptoms/triggers as well as children, but parents have greater recognition of the circumstances of falling asleep. Cataplexy diary modifications included changes in definitions and examples of cataplexy, using child-friendly terminology, adding a quantitative question to determine daily frequency, and standardizing the questionnaire for evening administration with self-completion by the child. Modifications were made to ESS-CHAD for child-friendly wording and to ensure that items reflect activities (eating, watching TV/video) and environments (school, bus/car transport) in which children are likely to participate. Two ESS-CHAD versions were proposed: one with a 1 -month recall period, for general use, and the other with a recall period of “since your last study visit,” for research, which could be shorter or longer than 1 month (as short as 1 week). Conclusion: The cataplexy diary and ESS-CHAD were modified for the assessment of children and adolescents. Further psychometric validation is recommended.

Main Outcome Measures: Differences in change of mean between the two treatment groups as to diary sleep onset, sleep latency and sleep duration, feeling refreshed in the morning, melatonin onset, actigraphic sleep onset, poly-somnographic sleep architecture, cognitive processing speed and vigilance. Results: Mean (±SD) baseline DLMO occurred at 11. 13 pm (± 1 : 18 h) in the melatonin treatment group and at 11. 24 pm (± 1 : 15 h) in the placebo group.

Methods: To fully investigate the patient experience of sleep restriction therapy for insomnia we designed a within-subjects mixed-method study, employing sleep and daytime functioning questionnaires, assessments of sleep-restriction-related side-effects, prospective qualitative audio-diaries and post-treatment semi-structured interviews. University of Glasgow <b>Sleep</b> <b>Centre.</b> Eighteen patients with Primary Insomnia (mean age = 42; range 18 - 64). Patients {{took part in a}} 4 -week brief sleep restriction intervention, involving two group sessions and two subsequent follow-up phone calls in the home environment. Measurements and results: Sleep diaries and global measures of insomnia severity and sleep quality, as expected, demonstrated robust improvements at both post-treatment and 3 -month follow-up (all large effect sizes). Daytime functioning/health-related quality of life variables similarly evidenced strong treatment effects (moderate to large effect sizes). Reported side-effects were common, with &# 8805; 50 % of patients reporting impairment in 8 out of 12 listed symptoms as a consequence of initiating treatment. The four most common side-effects were 'fatigue/exhaustion' (100 %), 'extreme sleepiness' (94 %), 'reduced motivation/energy' (89 %) and 'headache/migraine' (72 %) [Mean number of symptoms per patient = 7. 2 (2. 4); range 3 - 11]. Intriguingly, both side-effect frequency and ratings of side-effect interference were associated with baseline to post-treatment improvements in sleep quality. Qualitative real-time audio-diaries during week 1 of treatment and post-treatment interviews provided rich accounts of side-effects associated with acute SRT implementation: general challenges surrounding treatment implementation and adherence/non-adherence; and modifications to sleep parameters, daytime functioning and perceptions of sleep/sleep period. Conclusions: This work has important implications for the delivery of SRT, particularly concerning awareness of possible 'adverse events' and likely implementation/adherence challenges.

40|$|To date, {{there is}} little {{research}} into either stress reactivity or the specificity of psychological characteristics in particular forms of sleep disorder. NREM parasomnias are a relatively un-studied group of sleep disorders. The {{purpose of this study}} was to gain greater insight into how people with NREM parasomnias respond to ‘threat’ and to life situations. In particular, the aim was to investigate how their responses to a psychological stressor compared to individuals with insomnia and to good sleepers by measuring autonomic arousal, as well as subjective appraisals of stress. Baseline levels of autonomic arousal were intended to provide insight into daytime arousal levels at the trait level. Participants (N = 38) were recruited from the general population and attended the University of Glasgow <b>Sleep</b> <b>Centre</b> to take part. Autonomic arousal was measured via continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings of heart rate (HR) and cardiac vagal tone (CVT) whilst participants took part in baseline, stressor (a difficult mathematical task) and recovery phases. In general, group differences were not found, however this may be partly due to the small sample size and corresponding lack of power to detect differences. The results indicated that the NREM group reacted to stress in a similar way to good sleepers. In general, it was the insomnia group but not the NREM group whose data differed from good sleepers. However, both the NREM parasomnia and Insomnia groups exhibited a relatively higher (though not statistically significant) resting baseline HR compared to the good sleeper group, suggesting a higher level of underlying sympathetic arousal. The findings of this type of study have potentially important implications for the development of treatment programmes for NREM parasomnias. However, further work needs to be done before any conclusions can be drawn. The study was intended as an exploratory study and the preliminary findings indicate that further exploration is warranted.

The present study’s aim is to determine normative values of alertness on the THAT and to explore the relationship among excessive daytime sleepiness, fatigue, depressive symptoms, and alertness. Methods: Normative data were collected from 60 healthy males and females. To explore the relationship among alertness, daytime sleepiness, fatigue, depression, and anxiety, data were collected from charts of sleep clinic patients. All study subjects completed measures for fatigue, sleepiness, depressive symptoms, and anxiety. Results: The average score on the THAT was 34. 9 ± 7. 2 (range 22 – 50) for the control group. The cutoff score for the THAT, indicative of clinically significant reduced alertness, was determined to be ≤ 20. 5 (mean – 2 SD). THAT alertness scores were found to be modestly, significantly, and negatively correlated with fatigue levels (r=– 0. 39, P< 0. 001), depressive symptoms (r=– 0. 53, P< 0. 001), and anxiety symptoms (r=– 0. 41, P< 0. 001). No correlations were found between alertness levels and daytime sleepiness. Regression analyses revealed a significant model (F= 19. 9, P< 0. 001, adjusted R 2 = 0. 35) with depressive symptoms (P< 0. 001) and fatigue (P= 0. 006) emerging as the only significant predictors of scores on the THAT.

Methods: This was a post hoc subgroup analysis of data from a 7 -week, European, double-blind, dose-optimized, Phase III study. Patients aged 6 – 17 years were randomized 1 : 1 : 1 to LDX, placebo, or osmotic-release oral system methylphenidate (OROS-MPH). OROS-MPH was included as a reference arm rather than as a direct comparator. Efficacy was assessed in patients categorized according to their ADHD medication history using the ADHD Rating Scale IV and Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) scores. Results: The difference between active drug and placebo in least-squares mean change from baseline to endpoint in ADHD Rating Scale IV total score (95 % confidence interval) was similar between the overall study population (n= 317; LDX, - 18. 6 [- 21. 5, - 15. 7]; OROS- MPH, - 13. 0 [- 15. 9, - 10. 2]) and treatment-naïve individuals (n= 147; LDX, - 15. 1 [- 19. 4, - 10. 9]; OROS-MPH, - 12. 7 [- 16. 8, - 8. 5]) or patients previously treated with any ADHD medication (n= 170; LDX, - 21. 5 [- 25. 5, - 17. 6]; OROS-MPH, - 14. 2 [- 18. 1, - 10. 3]). In addition, similar proportions of patients receiving active treatment were categorized as improved based on CGI-I score (CGI-I of 1 or 2) in the overall study population and among treatment-naïve individuals or patients previously treated with any ADHD medication. Conclusion: In these post hoc analyses, the response to LDX treatment, and to the reference treatment OROS-MPH, was similar to that observed for the overall study population in subgroups of patients categorized according to whether or not they had previously received ADHD medication.
