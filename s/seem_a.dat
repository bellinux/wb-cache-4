5|$|Due {{to reduced}} {{interest}} in his pre-war work, Coggins applied for a position teaching watercolor at Hunter College. He taught watercolor painting there from 1948 to 1952. In New York, {{as a result of}} his friendship with Fletcher Pratt, Coggins was introduced to the members of the Hydra Club, where he met Judith Merril and L. Ron Hubbard. Coggins was also invited to join Pratt's Trap Door Spiders club, where he became closely associated with L. Sprague de Camp and Isaac Asimov. The contact with such visionary thinkers complimented his exposure to the German V-2 rockets in Europe and served to strengthen his growing interest in space travel, rockets, and science fiction. In 1951 and 1952, Coggins collaborated again with Fletcher Pratt on two classic books: Rockets, Jets, Guided Missiles & Space Ships, and By Space Ship to the Moon. The books were released amidst the great wave of interest in space travel sweeping the United States and the rest of the world in the 1950s, and they were published in several countries and translated into other languages. These books made the prospect of space exploration <b>seem</b> <b>a</b> practical possibility. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) scientists used the books to demonstrate their ideas to Congressmen when seeking funding for the space program, and there are many NASA scientists today who retain fond memories of the influence the books had on their careers.|$|E

25|$|In 1972 the BBC {{terminated}} Bernard Braden's {{late night}} show, On the Braden Beat, {{replacing it with}} a similar programme, That's Life!, introduced by Esther Rantzen, who had worked with Braden. The reasons <b>seem</b> <b>a</b> little complicated and may {{have had something to do}} with Braden's contract to advertise margarine on ITV. However, although Braden himself was publicly circumspect about the decision, Kelly was forthright in condemning it and was plainly hostile towards Rantzen.|$|E
25|$|Fusion {{power would}} provide more energy {{for a given}} weight of fuel than any {{fuel-consuming}} energy source currently in use, and the fuel itself (primarily deuterium) exists abundantly in the Earth's ocean: about 1 in 6500 hydrogen atoms in seawater is deuterium. Although this may <b>seem</b> <b>a</b> low proportion (about 0.015%), because nuclear fusion reactions {{are so much more}} energetic than chemical combustion and seawater is easier to access and more plentiful than fossil fuels, fusion could potentially supply the world's energy needs for millions of years.|$|E

25|$|Concept Fields {{have many}} objects {{set up to}} allow players to remain hidden from their opponents. A concept field is a perfect {{man-made}} creation for paintball games. A field in this style is usually outdoors and almost always has a theme. Urban concept fields are often seen filled with cars, buildings, and other elements that {{are found in the}} city, though some concept field creators go all out and put together themes that may <b>seem</b> <b>a</b> bit over the top to those who aren't familiar with the sport.|$|E
25|$|It may <b>seem</b> <b>a</b> vast {{depletion}} of the downtown shopping area, it now having only one department store, the Hudson's Bay Company. But {{the fact is that}} for many years, until the arrival of the Hudson's Bay Company there were only two department stores downtown, Simpson's and the discount department store on Broad Street — the wholesale wing of Simpson's and Sherwood Department Store being outside city centre. Reaching a balance between convenience for residents of Regina and the desire to make the city appealing and impressive is not a novelty.|$|E
25|$|The {{council of}} war {{therefore}} unanimously decided {{to lower the}} flag of the Batavian Republic and declare themselves prisoners of war. They refused, however, to hoist the Orange flag. This may <b>seem</b> <b>a</b> minor point, but it signified that the officers did not defect. When Mitchell accepted the surrender, he did this {{in the name of the}} Prince of Orange. He therefore ordered {{the flag of the}} Prince to be hoisted, with which order some of the officers complied. This little act was to cost them dearly later on, as it was interpreted as an act of treason.|$|E

25|$|On April 4, 1862, the Union Army {{pushed through}} Magruder's initial {{line of defense}} but the {{following}} day encountered his more effective Warwick Line. The nature of the terrain {{made it difficult to}} determine the exact disposition of the Confederate forces. A victim of faulty intelligence, McClellan estimated that the Confederates had 40,000 troops in the defensive line and that Johnston was expected to arrive quickly with an additional 60,000. Magruder, who had a flare for theatrics, exacerbated McClellan's confusion by moving infantry and artillery in a noisy, ostentatious manner to make the defenders <b>seem</b> <b>a</b> much larger forces than their actual numbers.|$|E
25|$|The high {{dropout rate}} {{is among the}} biggest {{obstacles}} to higher education for both Bedouin men and women. Of the students that do remain in school, only about 30% pass their matriculation exams. These exams are taken {{at the end of}} high school (typically around age 17) and are required for enrollment at Israeli universities. Moreover, Bedouin students studying at Israeli universities face a significant language barrier (instruction is generally in Hebrew or English, not Arabic). Finally, most Negev Bedouin men are employed as wage laborers, not as white-collar or blue-collar workers. In the face of this fact, it often does not <b>seem</b> <b>a</b> reasonable investment to attain higher education.|$|E
25|$|In 21 AD, Tiberius {{offered him}} the {{governorship}} of Africa Province. He rejected the offer, however, because of ill-health and his children, but {{more likely to}} leave the position to Quintus Junius Blaesus, uncle of Lucius Aelius Sejanus the powerful pretorian prefect. Although these episodes may <b>seem</b> <b>a</b> flattery towards the emperor Tiberius, Lepidus' activities in the senate show an independent mind. In 21 AD he made a strong speech {{against the death penalty}} for an irreverent poet. Nevertheless, the poet was executed by order of the senate: this allowed Tiberius to praise Lepidus' moderation (as well as the senate's zeal in persecuting any offence against the emperor).|$|E

25|$|Italian {{politicians}} {{were divided into}} two factions: one favourable to negotiations which, amongst others, included the secretary of the Italian Socialist Party, Bettino Craxi and the others totally negating that possibility, most of the Christian Democracy and Italian Communist Party, including the latter's national secretary Enrico Berlinguer and Republican leader Ugo La Malfa who proposed the death penalty for the terrorists. The second faction noted that any negotiation would <b>seem</b> <b>a</b> legitimisation of the violence of the terrorists. Further, that solution would not be accepted by the Italian police forces who had seen numerous of their members fall during the war against terrorism in previous years.|$|E
25|$|A {{total of}} around 4,000 islanders were sentenced for {{breaking}} laws during the occupation (around 2,600 in Jersey and 1,400 in Guernsey); 570 prisoners {{were sent to}} continental prisons and camps, and at least 22 persons from Jersey and 9 from Guernsey did not return. It may <b>seem</b> <b>a</b> high level of crime, but equates to 12 people per 1,000, per annum, similar to the 2010-2014 conviction rates in England and Wales. If you exclude crimes against Germans and conviction of offences that had not existed in 1939, such as breaking curfew, it indicates a level of general good behaviour. The severe penalties imposed by Courts no doubt had {{had an effect on}} the level of crime, fines could be as high as several years pay or even the value of a house. Despite people becoming more desperate as the occupation progressed.|$|E
25|$|Pharaohs' {{subjects}} {{viewed the}} pharaoh {{as a living}} god, the god Horus. Once the pharaoh died, he became the god Osiris, the king of eternity. While some retainers' deaths {{appear to have been}} taken for granted, other sacrifices appear to have raised the status and wealth of some retainers in the afterlife. This can be inferred from the wealth they were interred with and their graves' position in relation to the king's grave. This also suggests that the retainers agreed to be sacrificed to raise their social status and wealth in the afterlife. Matthew Adams, an archeologist from the University of Pennsylvania and the associate director of an expedition made by New York University, Yale and the University of Pennsylvania, suggests that the ancient Egyptians may have viewed being sacrificed at a king's death a sure way to reach eternal life. For a civilization so centered on the life to come, a guarantee of eternal happiness and security would <b>seem</b> <b>a</b> likely motivation for a retainer to agree to be sacrificed.|$|E

500|$|Upon the serial's publication, Hergé faced {{criticism}} for including Wolff's suicide in the story; suicide was {{widely viewed as}} a sin in Catholic-dominated Belgium. In deference to these critics, for the published book version he added Wolff's line of [...] "perhaps by some miracle I shall escape too", to make the scene <b>seem</b> <b>a</b> less obvious suicide. Years later, Hergé expressed regret that he had capitulated on this issue.|$|E
