They engage in [...] "physical and spiritual warfare: using the power of prayer to <b>strengthen</b> <b>your</b> troops in combat and wield modern military weaponry throughout the game world." [...] Thompson claims that the makers of the game are sacrificing their values. He said, [...] "Because of the Christian context, somehow it's OK? It's not OK. The context is irrelevant.

Thompson has not seen the game, which he says has [...] "personally broken my heart," [...] but claims, [...] "I don't have to meet Abraham Lincoln to know that he was the 16th president of the United States." ...|$|E
