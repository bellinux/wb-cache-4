As a result, Grameen differs from many other social justice efforts in that it does not include intensive rehabilitation training programs for the disadvantaged persons it serves. Instead, Grameen gives its borrowers freedom to pursue a better future using the <b>skills</b> <b>they</b> already possess in the best way they can with membership in a five-person support group being the only requirement.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary Mangalorean Catholics are descended {{mainly from}} the Goan Catholic settlers, who {{migrated}} to Canara from Goa, a state north of Canara, between 1560 and 1763 in three major waves. The first wave of immigrants came to Mangalore to escape the trials of the Goa Inquisition of 1560. These migrants were welcomed by the native Bednore rulers of Canara for their agricultural <b>skills.</b> <b>They</b> were followed by a second major wave precipitated by the Portugal–Adil Shahi wars between 1570 and 1579. A final influx of immigrants arrived during the Portugal–Maratha wars in Goa during the late 17th and early 18thcenturies. According to Mangalorean historian Alan Machado Prabhu, the Mangalorean Catholics numbered about 58,000 {{by the time of}} the capture of Canara by Hyder Ali in 1765.|$|E
5|$|During World WarII, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) {{established}} several {{operational training}} units (OTUs) to convert recently graduated pilots from advanced trainers to combat aircraft, and to add fighting ability to the flying <b>skills</b> <b>they</b> had already learned. Post-war demobilisation saw the disbandment of these OTUs, and operational conversion of new pilots became {{the responsibility of}} front-line squadrons. This practice impacted upon the squadrons' standard duties, {{and the advent of}} the Korean War and introduction of jet aircraft further necessitated a more formal training system. The Air Force's initial move in this direction was to re-establish No.2 (Fighter) Operational Training Unit at RAAF Base Williamtown, New South Wales, in March 1952; it was renamed No.2 (Fighter) Operational Conversion Unit in September 1958.|$|E

5|$|There are six {{different}} specialized combat roles equivalent to standard character classes. They are Battlers (warriors), Dark (dark knights), Gunners, Kanbus (ninja), Koas (paladins), and Somas (mages). A character's class determines {{what types of}} weapons and <b>skills</b> <b>they</b> can equip. Each class consequently uses a different fighting style: the Kanbus focuses on dual weapons and one-hit attacks, the Koas focuses {{on a combination of}} attack and healing abilities, the Dark sacrifices health to deal heavier damage, Gunners specialize in long-range attacks, Battlers focuses on melee attacks, and the Somas use long-range magic over close-range physical attacks. Weapons are equipped based on a character's class, and can be upgraded using special items called Orbs. Weapons and items collected through exploration and from enemy drops can be sold to other players through wireless connection.|$|E
5|$|Watts {{has stated}} that the WWF {{intended}} to have Tekno Team 2000 win the WWF Tag Team Championship after two months in the promotion. After Watts' father, Bill Watts, began booking matches, the team was later sent to developmental territories to improve their <b>skills.</b> <b>They</b> returned to USWA in Tennessee, where they had wrestled a tag team match together in April 1995 under their real names. Competing as Tekno Team 2000, they defeated PG-13 on September 18. They began losing matches, however, while facing PG-13, The Heavenly Bodies, and The Bushwhackers. On October 30, Troy and Travis reversed their fortunes and defeated King Cobra and Spellbinder.|$|E
5|$|Battles {{play out}} using a turn-based system where each unit {{on both sides}} is given their chance to move and act. Characters move and attack within the same turn, {{and in a few}} cases units can take two moves in a turn. A key part of combat is the Weapons Triangle, a new {{addition}} which governs the opposing strengths and weaknesses of weapon types based on a rock–paper–scissors system - lances are stronger than swords, swords are stronger than axes, and axes are stronger than lances. A secondary system governs the magic system, where Fire, Lightning, and Wind spells have varying strengths and weaknesses against each other. Each unit has a character class which determines their weapon, skill set, movement and attack range, how much effect they have on other units, which latent <b>skills</b> <b>they</b> possess, and whether they use passive or aggressive skills when in combat. Different weapon types also affect character movement and battle performance: for instance, a powerful sword deals damage while slowing a character's movement.|$|E

5|$|During World WarII, the RAAF {{established}} several {{operational training}} units (OTUs) to convert recently graduated pilots from advanced trainers to combat aircraft, and to add fighting techniques to the flying <b>skills</b> <b>they</b> had already learned. No.2 (Fighter) Operational Training Unit (No.2 OTU) was formed on 2April 1942 at Port Pirie, South Australia. Its inaugural commanding officer was Wing Commander Peter Jeffrey, a fighter ace who had led No.3 Squadron in North Africa. Jeffrey had recently brought on line Nos.75 and 76 Squadrons, {{two of the}} first three fighter units raised to help defend northern Australia as the Japanese advanced toward New Guinea. His team of instructors at No.2OTU included fellow aces from the North African campaign, Clive Caldwell and Wilf Arthur. Originally equipped with CAC Wirraways and Fairey Battles, the unit's complement was augmented by P-40 Kittyhawks, Vultee Vengeances, Avro Ansons, CAC Boomerangs, Supermarine Spitfires and Airspeed Oxfords after it relocated to RAAF Station Mildura, Victoria, in May. By September 1942, its fleet of aircraft included nine of the 106 Kittyhawks the RAAF had on hand at the time. During November, No.2OTU conducted comparative trials that pitted a Spitfire MkV against a P-40E; the final report of these trials judged that although the Spitfire had superior performance according to most criteria, the P-40E was also a useful design.|$|E
5|$|In 2002 Johnson {{received}} $1.1 {{million in}} grants from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the U.S. Department of Education. Johnson used the money to create eight smaller learning communities for the 2003–2004 school year. In {{the first five years}} the graduation rate at Johnson increased 19% with state-required 10th grade reading and writing tests also seeing double digit increases. The money from the grants ran out before the 20062007 school year. Currently, there are eight smaller learning communities within the school. All students start in the Freshmen FOCUS Academy and then choose one of seven other academies for the remainder of their high school career based on their interests. Beginning with the class of 2006, graduating seniors are required to engage in the Senior Project, a program designed for students to showcase the <b>skills</b> <b>they</b> have developed during their stay at Johnson and as a practice for building a résumé or portfolio when applying for jobs.|$|E
5|$|The White Stag Leadership Development Program's methods {{address all}} of the areas the studies identified. Mentored and coached by adults, the youth staff develop, plan and {{implement}} the week-long summer camp programs. They develop skills in research, writing, planning, and evaluation. Using the outdoors, they practice learning activities, games, and outdoor skills required {{to live in a}} camping environment. They learn to get along with and other counsel youth from different backgrounds. They study eleven specific skills of leadership and practice presenting them to one another before summer camp, when they present these learning sessions to the participants. The youth, led and mentored by adults, work together with other youth they have never met, forming new relationships and learning to connect and cooperate. They learn basic group membership skills required in work life, like communication and planning, and plan and implement their leadership skills in their home community. They learn and practice problem-solving and counseling skills, how groups form and grow, and planning <b>skills.</b> <b>They</b> learn and rehearse various kinds of communications skills, how to represent their group—both with and without the group's input—and how to work effectively with others.|$|E
