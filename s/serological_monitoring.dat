EFSA advised to include serological testing of pigs on T. gondii infections and audits of pig farms on risk factors for T. gondii infection (EFSA, 2011). In order to generate knowledge about the epidemiology and prevalence of T. gondii infections in pig herds we studied the long term seroprevalence on farms, persistence of infection and variation in results between and within farms. Sera which were routinely taken in Dutch pig slaughterhouses in the Netherlands for the <b>serological</b> <b>monitoring</b> of Mycobacterium avium infections in pigs (Hiller 2013) were also tested for anti T. gondii antibodies. Results of 120, 666 sera, collected from January 2012 until August 2014, showed an average of 2 % serological prevalence in pigs. Pigs from organic farms had a prevalence of 3, 6 %. Farm prevalence was much higher, ranging from approximately 30 % for conventional farms to 90 % for organic farms.

In France, toxoplasmosis serological screening requires systematic testing for IgM and IgG antibodies. The Platelia Toxo IgG and IgM test (Bio-Rad) {{is one of the}} most widely used tests for anti-toxoplasmic antibody detection. We performed a study on 384 sera, including 123 IgG negative (< 6  IU/mL) and 261 IgG equivocal (6 – 9  IU/mL) sera tested with Platelia Toxo IgG and collected during routine screening at Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Paris, France to determine the best-performing IgG titer cut-off value. Out of these 383 sera, 298 were IgM negative by Platelia Toxo IgM and 86 were IgM positive. All sera were also tested against Toxo IgG II LD BIO western blot test as confirmation. Our results indicated that an IgG titer cut-off value of ≥ 4. 4  IU/mL for the Platelia Toxo IgG met the definition of positivity, a value significantly lower than that indicated by the manufacturers. In the presence of IgM antibodies, the IgG titer cut-off decreased significantly to a value ≥ 0. 2  IU/mL.

40|$|Infection by V-factor {{requiring}} Pasteurellaceae (Haemophilus spp) bacteria frequently {{occurs in}} Specifi ed Pathogen Free (SPF) colonies of rats. Colonies may be monitored by methods that either detect the bacteria or detect specifi c antibodies by for instance the {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA) and immunoblot (IB). Breeding females in enzootically infected colonies transfer antibodies to their young. Maternal immunity prevents the development of antibodies by the pups yielding a transition period of low antibody activity in the pups between waning maternal immunity and seroconversion. We studied antibody activity to Haemophilus antigens in young rats delivered by Haemophilus infected dams by ELISA and IB using antigens of Haemophilus strains H 21 (from rat) and H 35 (from guinea pig). Young showed high ELISA and IB maternal antibody activity until weaning, a decline to a low level between 9 and 12 weeks of age, and then seroconversion.

40|$|Eradication of Aujeszky's {{disease from}} a {{large-scale}} pig farm by the 'test-and-cull' eradication procedure {{based on the}} use of gene-deleted vaccines and <b>serological</b> <b>monitoring</b> using gE ELISA is described. Aujeszky's disease free status was successfully achieved on a farrow-to-finish type farm characterised by three difficulties interfering with the success of eradication: (i) weaned (30 -day-old) piglets remained in the farrowing house until 65 days of age; (ii) the farm did not use nursery rearing; (iii) fatteners were kept together with the breeding gilts. Thus, the immunisation programme had to be adjusted to the management technology used on the farm, and by regular serological monitoringit had to be periodically modified to make it suitable for attaining the goals. This meant that breeding animal candidates of a wide age range and kept in the same air space had to be provided with a continuously high-level immunity by regular vaccination sufficient even for rectifying potential human errors. The immunisation programme was designed by taking into consideration the disappearance of maternal immunity, and a strict vaccination programme was applied during the rearing of breeding gilts kept together with the fattening pigs. Frequent immunisation applied during the rearing of the own breeding animal replacements proved to be of decisive importance for the eradication of Aujeszky's disease from the entire herd.

Using double-sandwich ELISA, we measured levels of both antigens in 117 patients and in 62 age- and sex-matched controls. Patients were stratified into four risk group based on stage of the disease. Serum levels of both markers were significantly higher in melanoma patients than in controls. CYT-MAA was the more sensitive marker, with 61 % of patients showing elevated levels regardless of the stage of disease. HMW-MAA was elevated in 29 %. Elevated CYT-MAA was also significantly correlated with poorer clinical outcome. By multivariate analysis (adjusting for stage and age), patients who had elevated CYT-MAA were 81 % more likely to recur than patients with undetectable levels (hazard ratio= 1. 81, 95 % CI=[1. 07, 3. 06], p-value= 0. 03).

40|$|AbstractThe recent {{roll-out}} {{of rapid}} diagnostic tests (RDTs) for malaria has highlighted the decreasing proportion of malaria-attributable illness in endemic areas. Unfortunately, once malaria is excluded, {{there are few}} accessible diagnostic tools to guide the management of severe febrile illnesses in low resource settings. This review summarizes {{the current state of}} RDT development for several key infections, including dengue fever, enteric fever, leptospirosis, brucellosis, visceral leishmaniasis and human African trypanosomiasis, and highlights many remaining gaps. Most RDTs for non-malarial tropical infections currently rely on the detection of host antibodies against a single infectious agent. The sensitivity and specificity of host-antibody detection tests are both inherently limited. Moreover, prolonged antibody responses to many infections preclude the use of most <b>serological</b> RDTs for <b>monitoring</b> response to treatment and/or for diagnosing relapse. Considering these limitations, there is a pressing need for sensitive pathogen-detection-based RDTs, as have been successfully developed for malaria and dengue. Ultimately, integration of RDTs into a validated syndromic approach to tropical fevers is urgently needed. Related research priorities are to define the evolving epidemiology of fever in the tropics, and to determine how combinations of RDTs could be best used to improve the management of severe and treatable infections requiring specific therapy...|$|R
