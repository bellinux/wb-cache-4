5000|$|Many see aliyah as an unwise tradeoff: while Argentine Jews {{exchange}} anti-Semitic slurs in {{the shadow}} of the attacks, life in Israel demands the far more immediate and permanent sacrifices of a country that is perpetually at war. Israelis believe that “in order to be Jewish you need to live in Israel, to sacrifice yourself and to give up your children for the defense of the country,” <b>says</b> <b>Laura,</b> whose husband was killed in the community center attack. Laura resents the Israeli perception of Diaspora Jews that “makes us [...] [...] [...] feel as if we’re not Jewish.” The truth, she says, is that “I don’t have to live in Israel in order to be a Jew.” ...|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the most}} memorable single shots in the Hitchcock canon — it [...] "is studied by film classes", <b>says</b> <b>Laura</b> Elliott, who played Miriam—is her character's {{strangulation}} by Bruno on the Magic Isle. [...] "In one {{of the most}} unexpected, most aesthetically justified moments in film," [...] the slow, almost graceful, murder is shown as a reflection in the victim's eyeglasses, which have been jarred loose from her head and dropped to the ground. The unusual angle was a more complex proposition than it seems. First Hitchcock got the exterior shots in Canoga Park, using both actors, then later he had Elliott alone report to a soundstage where there was a large concave reflector set on the floor. The camera was {{on one side of the}} reflector, Elliott was on the other, and Hitchcock directed Elliott to turn her back to the reflector and [...] "float backwards, all the way to the floor... like you were doing the limbo." [...] The first six takes went badly—Elliott thudded to the floor with several feet yet to go—but on the seventh take, she floated smoothly all the way. Hitchcock's even-strained response: [...] "Cut. Next shot." [...] Hitchcock then had the two elements [...] "ingeniously" [...] double printed, yielding a shot of [...] "oddly appealing originality with a stark fusion of the grotesque and the beautiful.... The astheticizing of the horror somehow enables the audience to contemplate more fully its reality." ...|$|E

60|$|And my wife, as in duty bound, gave me full {{reports of}} all that {{happened}} in that house of mourning. On the very day of the flight, Lady Anne, her daughter, and some others of her family arrived at Newcome. The deserted little girl, Barnes's eldest child, ran, with tears and cries of joy, to her Aunt Ethel, whom she had always loved better than her mother; and clung to her and embraced her; and, in her artless little words, told her that mamma had gone away, and that Ethel should be her mamma now. Very strongly moved by the misfortune, as by the caresses and affection of the poor orphaned creature, Ethel took the little girl to her heart, and promised {{to be a mother}} to her, and that she would not leave her; in which pious resolve I scarcely need <b>say</b> <b>Laura</b> strengthened her, when, at her young friend's urgent summons, my wife came to her.|$|R

40|$|There are two central strands to this study, {{the voice}} of Steiner (or 'Waldorf') {{education}} and {{the voice of}} young women - voices rarely heard in the mainstream educational arena. Together they are the voice of 'harmonious being', a phrase which I have used to describe the phenomenon of the Steiner education experience which aims for harmonisation of the whole human being. Who the young person becomes is central to this experience yet there is little in-depth research exploring the Steiner student's voice. By addressing this gap and inviting young women Steiner students to explore this phenomenon through conversation this study achieves three significant visions. First, it raises the social voice of young women and challenges the negative stereotype of 'adolescent girl' proffered by the media. Second, it illuminates the living experience of an educational initiative that fosters connectedness and humankind's spiritual wisdom. Third, it demonstrates the value of simply talking and 'listening with spirit' to stay present in conversation and 'experience the other' through empowered and heart-centred relationships. As a consequence of doing this research, a fourth vision has emerged showing the value of love as methodology. Over one school year (9 months) I met regularly with twelve young women secondary students (14 - 18 years of age) from a New Zealand Steiner school to explore the phenomenon of harmonious being through conversations about their lives. Our conversations advance an intuitive methodology of love, connectedness and wholeness, which is encapsulated in a new methodological mix combining Goethean phenomenology with Carol Gilligan's relational psychology. Together they invoke the recognition of our innate connectedness. Goethe's is an artistic science of withness and wholeness ('one voice resonates with all voices') focusing on the epiphany experience of the archetypal phenomenon. Gilligan's voice-centred relational psychology has provided a humanistic feminist lens through which women and men come together as 'human' as heard in the layers of conversations with these young women. In this study, epiphany moments were unfolded in detail in six conversations series through a four stage process of Goethean layered listening. The themes of 'Belonging and Becoming' that emerged were explored through the collective voices of the twelve young women. The young women in this study offer insightful and rare views of their lifeworlds; voices rich with wisdom constructing 'adolescence' as a time of creative development. These young women show a remarkable interest in the world and a keen awareness of their social, cultural and physical environments locally, nationally and internationally. As evocative social agents they recreate the conventional 'moody adolescent' to a meaningful picture of what matters to a young woman as she authors her own life. What Gilligan calls 'the voice of resistance' {{is alive and well in}} these young women. Their experiences of 'harmonious being' transcribe a fluid lemniscate path of discovery between voice as self and their world-relationships: a structure with ribbon, <b>says</b> <b>Laura.</b> They describe an awakening to 'who they are' as a 'self-belonging', which creates space to become and belong more fully to 'who they will be'. Through the voices of young women Steiner students this study tells that the living spirit of Steiner education is alive and well in the 21 st Century. This research became the very experience of the phenomenon we were exploring, unfolding a natural human science that has shifted the voice of phenomenology from 'lived' to 'living' experience and revealed a relational methodology of an embodied dynamic voice, epitomised in the phrase: belonging and becoming...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} recorded in 2005 for a DVD special feature, Remington Steele co-creator Michael Gleason and star Stephanie Zimbalist discuss {{the large number}} of women who have approached them over the years to express their appreciation for the character of Laura Holt.

[...] Also in 2005, Robin Rauzi published an article in the Los Angeles Times <b>saying</b> that <b>Laura</b> Holt was her hero.
