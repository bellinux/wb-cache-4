40|$|In {{his book}} By Order of the President: FDR and the Internment of Japanese Americans (2001), Greg Robinson {{discussed}} FDR’s decision to remove Japanese Americans {{from their homes}} and concentrate them in internment camps. Now in this chapter from his recently published book, After Camp: Portraits in Midcentury Japanese American Life and Politics, he unearths Roosevelt’s grandiose and frightening idea of their return to civil society by scattering them—two or three families at a time—in small towns, all away from the west coast. He also thought such a <b>scatter</b> <b>plan</b> would suit refugee European Jews who he hoped would settle in Latin America. Indeed he thought ethnic minorities crowded into American cities might also benefit if resettled in small towns. While this is a racial story, FDR’s vision here was also driven by the rural sentiments of FDR, the gentleman farmer. That produced some highly regarded programs, most notably the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) and the “Greenbelt towns. ” But the massive population transfers that Robinson shows to have been on the president’s mind would have made a mockery of the US rights tradition. Of equal importance, Robinson’s examination of the role of major social scientists recruited to the project provides an object lesson in the dangers of intellect seduced by power...|$|E

We analyse numerically the dependence of the azimuthal asymmetry of single inclusive charged pion production in ep-scattering, shows up as a 〈sin φ 〉 (related to the timereversal-odd structures) on the transverse momentum cutoff PC at HERMES energies, with taking into account nonperturbative higher-twist [1] and perturbative α 2 S-order QCD [2] contributions. The leading non-zero contribution inducing a sinφ-dependence into the single hadron inclusive cross section arises from the absorptive part of the one-loop corrections to the γ ∗ q → qg and γ ∗ g → q¯q subprocesses [2]. Although that predicted PT integrated asymmetry, 〈sin φ〉, is formally free from mass singularities, it may not be free from ambiguities due to the nonperturbative hadronic final-state interactions [1] which could be significant in small-PT regions. In this respect, introduction of a cutoff in outgoing hadron’s transverse momentum PT [3] may be desirable not only from the experimental, but also from the theoretical point of view.

40|$|While deliberating {{and making}} decisions, {{participants}} in urban development processes need {{easy access to}} the pertinent content <b>scattered</b> among different <b>plans.</b> A Planning Markup Language (PML) has been proposed to represent the underlying structure of plans in an XML-compliant way. However, PML currently covers only textual information and lacks specifications about graphic information used in plans. To fill in this gap, this dissertation develops a PML extension, termed PMLGraphics, with the capacity of marking up graphic content of plans in a ???plan usable??? way. The development of the PMLGraphics can significantly impact how plans are made and used in planning practice. The PMLGraphics is built on theoretical research on ontology of graphic representations in plan documents and relationships between different entities of plan content (i. e. text, single graphic and graphic group). The ontology of graphic representations includes typical graphic types in plans, representation methods used by graphics, and classification of intended plan information conveyed by graphics. The proposed PMLGraphics has three components: document metadata that summarizes general information of plan documents, document structure that outlines hierarchical structure of topics in plans, and document content that defines sets of elements to mark up plan content in text, single graphic, and graphic group, as well as relationships between these three content entities. To test the feasibility of the PMLGraphics, three plans are encoded and a prototype for using the PMLGraphics is designed and implemented. Three hypothetical use cases, which simulate scenarios in practical planning processes, are created to test the PMLGraphics capabilities. The use cases demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of the PMLGraphics in accessing graphic content <b>scattered</b> in different <b>plans</b> made by different agents. The significance of the PMLGraphics for planning participants is that, as use cases demonstrate, graphic plan content accessed through PMLGraphics would have been harder to find, if found at all, using hardcopy sources or using electronic files without graphic markup...|$|R

Optional attendance zones, the location of new schools, and feeder patterns were found to enhance segregation. This study found that mandatory busing was required to attain racial balance in every school.

Respiratory motion induces not only positional changes in internal patient anatomy but also related density variations. To study the impact of respiratory motion, iso-ranges for charged particles are calculated.

40|$|The {{conservation}} of the world's mammals {{has been one}} of the main goals for international agencies and NGOs in the past decades, as well as a core challenge for conservation scientists. Nonetheless, several mammal species went extinct in the past century and many others declined seriously in recent decades (a total of 76 species disappeared after 1500). Today 25 % of mammal species are threatened with extinction, and the necessity of a globally coordinated conservation strategy has been proclaimed. At a global scale, factors such as habitat loss and direct kill, are the key drivers of mammal species decline and extinction. The current biodiversity crisis, and in particular the current decline of mammals, needs operational tools to be tackled. Such tools include both on-the-ground implementation of conservation actions and a well framed conservation decision making process. Yet, a poor integration of macroecological studies and conservation planning studies has characterised past strategies for global species conservation. The scope of this PhD thesis is to advance the knowledge on global mammal conservation, by integrating existing data and by combining multi-disciplinary methodologies to provide innovative approaches to conservation decision making. The objectives of this thesis are: (i) to characterise global patterns in the distribution of suitable habitat for mammals; (ii) to describe patterns and processes characterising the recent decline of mammal species; (iii) to provide insights into the characterisation of internal sources of mammal species extinction risk and to use them in conservation planning; (iv) to address the methodological challenges that affect the quantification of threats to biodiversity. (i) A key aspect determining the effectiveness of mammal species conservation is the knowledge of species distribution. However, large-scale and fine-resolution information on mammal distribution has often been lacking. We filled this gap by developing habitat suitability models for over 90 % of existing terrestrial mammal species, based on their habitat preferences with a 300 m pixel base. Based on the developed models, we conducted a global, fine-resolution analysis of patterns of species richness. We found that the richness of mammal species estimated by the overlap of their suitable habitat is on average one-third less than the one estimated by the overlap of their geographic ranges. Differences in the proportion of suitable habitat within mammal geographic ranges were correlated to species IUCN Red List category, with threatened species having smaller values than non-threatened ones. Assessing temporal changes in species' extinction risks is necessary for measuring conservation success or failure at large spatial and taxonomical scales. Yet such a knowledge is limited even in well-studied group, such as mammals. We addressed this gap by consulting past literature sources, and assigning retrospective Red List categories to the world’s carnivores and ungulates (n= 550) for the past 40 years. We found that 23 % of species moved one or more categories closer to extinction, with Southeast Asia showing the steepest declines (where the figure is 45 %). We described a declining trend in mammal conservation status that was already underway 40 years ago, and has now accelerated, uncovering alarming future scenarios of global species losses. This declining trend is the ultimate result of geopolitical events, international regulations, shifting cultural values and natural resource exploitation. Studying trends in global species decline can help conservationists to recognize which conservation policies and strategies are (or are not) contributing to biodiversity protection. (iii) With one fourth of the world's mammals threatened with extinction and limited budget to save them, adopting an efficient conservation strategy is crucial. Previous approaches to setting global conservation priorities have assumed all species to have equal conservation value, or have focused on species with high extinction risk, species that may be hard to save. We propose a novel approach and focus on threatened species having the greatest recovery opportunity, using a new conservation benefit metric. We discover that 65 - 87 % of all threatened and potentially recoverable mammal species are overlooked by existing prioritization approaches. Our innovative metric has the potential to integrate with every strategy that aims to maximize the likelihood of conservation success. (iv) Anthropogenic threats drive species to extinction and are the focus of extinction risk analysis and conservation planning. However, the effects that multiple threats quantification methods have on threat measurement remain untested. We addressed this gap by quantifying the magnitude of human footprint for 901 Southeast Asian mammals according to several methods. We demonstrate that adopting different threat quantification techniques causes significant disagreement in threat measurements. We found that biases were non-linear and dependent on distal factors, such as the proportion of suitable habitat within species' range and species' habitat specialism. Threatened species were best predicted when measuring their proportion of range exposed to high levels of human footprint (a proxy of threat extent). Improving techniques to quantify biodiversity threats will enhance the effectiveness of extinction risk analyses and conservation decisions. Based on the outcomes of the presented PhD research, we propose that three main factors influence the global extinction risk of mammal species: human threats, species biology and conservation actions. The role of these factors in determining species decline or recovery, has been explored both theoretically and analytically. However, our understanding of how they interact to determine a species' final condition of endangerment is still limited. A key research challenge in the next future would be the exploration of such an interaction. In this thesis, we set a basis for the realization of such an analysis and the next step will be the investigation of the combinatory effects of all the mentioned factors. The urgency to properly address the current biodiversity crisis calls for a more coordinative effort in defining shared global strategies for intervention. Having a global coordination of conservation plan has a great potential to be more cost-effective than having several <b>scattered</b> <b>plans,</b> without contrasting the need for local scale practical interventions. We believe that increasing the biological inputs in conservation planning, through the consideration of species' biological characteristics, represents a promising field of future research expansion where expertise from multiple backgrounds can be integrated to define innovative strategies to address global scale extinction risk. The research findings presented in this thesis will contribute to improve future mammal conservation by: guiding the definition of more biologically-informed conservation strategies, improving our ability to analyze evidence of conservation success, providing general guidelines to address methodological uncertainty in conservation...|$|R
40|$|After {{a century}} of {{economic}} and planning trends that sent industry overseas and to the suburbs, manufacturing is stabilizing, if not growing, in American cities. This {{is good news for}} many urbanists eager to attract the economic benefits of industry. However, while economic arguments for urban manufacturing are mature, the spatial strategies for supporting it are <b>scattered</b> or nonexistent. <b>Planning</b> codes and urban design ideals remain set in a 20 th century mindset, while today's manufacturing has changed dramatically, becoming smaller and more networked than its previous iteration. Outdated perceptions of manufacturing block progressive policy reform at the highest level. Two thriving manufacturing centers, the Greenpoint Manufacturing and Design Center in New York and the American Industrial Center in San Francisco, provide clues for how 21 st century manufacturing is spatializing in cities. These facilities are cultural beacons in their mixed-use neighborhoods and help create a framework for thinking about why urban manufacturing matters in our re-industrializing metropolises. This thesis describes each facility in detail, drawing conclusions about their key characteristics at four spatial scales. Few urban design ideals adequately describe the industrial activity occurring in cities today. Therefore, this thesis builds a system of meaning that values history, economics, and the lived experience of cities as a way to approach urban manufacturing. The emerging lens of Creative Placemaking is invoked as a way to unify these theories, suggesting that urban manufacturing is a superlative form of Creative Placemaking. In conclusion, this thesis provides recommendations and tools for cities looking to cultivate industrial urbanism by offering lessons, developing a framework for a new type of land use classification, and outlining a research brief. The thesis ends with a call for action: as industry continues to change its character, becoming leaner and more technologically driven, cities have great competitive advantage. Planners have a critical opportunity to bring manufacturing back into cities through sensitive, mixed-use zoning that connects people to the process of making and awakens policy professionals to manufacturing as a vital element of the contemporary creative city. by Anna Catherine Muessig.

40|$|In {{radiotherapy}} with high-energy (4 - 25 MeV) electron beams, {{scattered radiation}} from the electron applicator influences the dose distribution in the patient. In most currently available treatment planning systems for radiotherapy this component is not explicitly included and handled only by a slight change of {{the intensity of the}} primary beam. The scattered radiation from an applicator changes with the field size and distance from the applicator. The amount of scattered radiation is dependent on the applicator design and on the formation of the electron beam in the treatment head. Electron applicators currently applied in most treatment machines are essentially a set of diaphragms, but still do produce scattered radiation. This paper investigates the present level of scattered dose from electron applicators, and as such provides an extensive set of measured data. The data provided could for instance serve as example input data or benchmark data for advanced treatment planning algorithms which employ a parametrized initial phase space to characterize the clinical electron beam. Central axis depth dose curves of the electron beams have been measured with and without applicators in place, for various applicator sizes and energies, for a Siemens Primus, a Varian 2300 C/D and an Elekta SLi accelerator. Scattered radiation generated by the applicator has been found by subtraction of the central axis depth dose curves, obtained with and without applicator. Scattered radiation from Siemens, Varian and Elekta electron applicators is still significant and cannot be neglected in advanced treatment <b>planning.</b> <b>Scattered</b> radiation at the surface of a water phantom can be as high as 12 %. Scattered radiation decreases almost linearly with depth. Scattered radiation from Varian applicators shows clear dependence on beam energy. The Elekta applicators produce less scattered radiation than those of Varian and Siemens, but feature a higher effective angular variance. The scattered radiation decreases somewhat with increasing field size and is spread uniformly over the aperture. Experimental results comply with the results of simulations of the treatment head and electron applicator, using the BEAM Monte Carlo code, and Siemens, but feature a higher effective angular variance. The scattered radiation decreases somewhat with increasing field size and is spread uniformly over the aperture.

40|$|Particle therapy (PT) cancer {{treatment}} {{is an alternative}} to conventional radiotherapy with the possibility for more conformal and tissue sparing treatments. PT is realized using either passive or active beam delivery methods. With the latter, also coined the scanned beam technique, magnets are used to cover the target laterally and for in-depth variation energy modulation is deployed, making the dose delivery even more conformal. However some of the current limitations of scanned beams are the longer irradiation times and a sensitivity to intra-fractionally moving targets. In PT centers with synchrotrons the irradiation time {{is directly related to}} the spot scan size and the width of the Bragg peak (BP), with the time needed from the accelerator to change energy as the bottleneck. The number of energy shifts required to cover a typical tumour in a homogeneous manner can in particular for heavy ions be as large as many hundreds. By broadening the BPs through the use of passive energy modulators, the number of energy shifts can be lowered, which would not only reduce the irradiation time but also results in a higher particle fluence per energy step, leading to higher precision in the beam monitoring systems. This work addresses the implementation of such passive energy modulators, in particular the ripple filter (RiFi). A “first generation” RiFi is currently used in carbon ion treatments in Germany, Italy, China and Japan. This first generation RiFi has 1 D groove shapes, which requires a non-modulating base layer of material leading to unnecessary scattering. It is furthermore restricted to a maximum thickness of 3 mm. A new second generation RiFi with two-dimensional cone structures has been designed. Compared to the old design the resolution and the mass distribution are significantly improved, reducing the overall lateral beam width. Using 3 D printing for manufacturing, the obtainable RiFi thickness is higher, with further BP widening and shorter irradiation times as a results. The new 2 D design is thought to be usable in treatments with protons as well, where RiFis as of now are commonly not used in proton treatments. In this thesis, we show a methodological presentation of planning with the second generation RiFi design. It was found that treatment plans with 2 D RiFis with 4 and 6 mm thicknesses yielded for the studied cases comparable dosimetric results to the standard 3 mm thick RiFi in terms of plan homogeneity and conformity but with significantly reduced irradiation times: Compared to the 3 mm RiFi, the 4 and 6 mm RiFis lower the irradiation time by 25 - 30 % and 45 - 49 % respectively. Plan homogeneity and conformity were slightly improved for thinner RiFis but satisfactory results are obtained for all cases with RiFi performances in general increasing with penetration depth due to straggling and <b>scattering</b> effects. Certain <b>plans</b> for 6 mm RiFis indicate that there might be an upper limit on the RiFi thickness in treatments of small and very superficial tumours. The work of this thesis also continues the investigations of the RiFi-induced fluence inhomogeneities and dose range inhomogeneities begun in the author's master thesis and covers new findings in this topic related to the beam spot sizes and the ion optical focusing of the beam. Lastly, during the thesis, plates of porous materials such as foams or lung substitutes will be shown to be usable as passive energy modulators in a manner similar to RiFis and to furthermore function as a range shifter, which placed close to the patients leads to reduced beam penumbras for low penetration depths. This work furthermore contains a short outlook with a perspective on other methods reducing the energy shifts as well as comments on new future designs of energy modulators...|$|R
6000|$|With Maurice I had {{for some}} time been acquainted through Eyton Tooke, who had known him at Cambridge, and {{although}} my discussions with him were almost always disputes, I had carried away from them much that helped to build up my new fabric of thought, {{in the same way}} as I was deriving much from Coleridge, and from the writings of Goethe and other German authors which I read during these years. I have so deep a respect for Maurice's character and purposes, as well as for his great mental gifts, that it is with some unwillingness I say anything which may seem to place him on a less high eminence than I would gladly be able to accord to him. But I have always thought that there was more intellectual power wasted in Maurice than in any other of my contemporaries. Few of them certainly have had so much to waste. Great powers of generalization, rare ingenuity and subtlety, and a wide perception of important and unobvious truths, served him not for putting something better into the place of the worthless heap of received opinions on the great subjects of thought, but for proving to his own mind that the Church of England had known everything from the first, and that all the truths on the ground of which the Church and orthodoxy have been attacked (many of which he saw as clearly as anyone) are not only consistent with the Thirty-nine Articles, but are better understood and expressed in those Articles than by anyone who rejects them. I have never been able to find any other explanation of this, than by attributing it to that timidity of conscience, combined with original sensitiveness of temperament, which has so often driven highly gifted men into Romanism, from the need of a firmer support than they can find in the independent conclusions of their own judgment. Any more vulgar kind of timidity no one who knew Maurice would ever think of imputing to him, even if he had not given public proof of his freedom from it, by his ultimate collision with some of the opinions commonly regarded as orthodox, and by his noble origination of the Christian Socialist movement. The nearest parallel to him, in a moral point of view, is Coleridge, to whom, in merely intellectual power, apart from poetical genius, I think him decidedly superior. At this time, however, he might be described as a disciple of Coleridge, and Sterling as a disciple of Coleridge and of him. The modifications which were taking place in my old opinions gave me some points of contact with them; and both Maurice and Sterling were of considerable use to my development. With Sterling I soon became very intimate, and was more attached to him than I have ever been to any other man. He was indeed one of the most lovable of men. His frank, cordial, affectionate, and expansive character; a love of truth alike conspicuous in the highest things and the humblest; a generous and ardent nature, which threw itself with impetuosity into the opinions it adopted, but was as eager to do justice to the doctrines and the men it was opposed to, as to make war on what it thought their errors; and an equal devotion to the two cardinal points of Liberty and Duty, formed a combination of qualities as attractive to me as to all others who knew him as well as I did. With his open mind and heart, he found no difficulty in joining hands with me across the gulf which as yet divided our opinions. He told me how he and others had looked upon me (from hearsay information), as a [...] "made" [...] or manufactured man, having had a certain impress of opinion stamped on me which I could only reproduce; and what a change took place in his feelings when he found, in the discussion on Wordsworth and Byron, that Wordsworth, and all which that name implies, [...] "belonged" [...] to me as much as to him and his friends. The failure of his health soon <b>scattered</b> all his <b>plans</b> of life, and compelled him to live at a distance from London, so that after the first year or two of our acquaintance, we only saw each other at distant intervals. But (as he said himself in one of his letters to Carlyle) when we did meet it was like brothers. Though he was never, in the full sense of the word, a profound thinker, his openness of mind, and the moral courage in which he greatly surpassed Maurice, made him outgrow the dominion which Maurice and Coleridge had once exercised over his intellect; though he retained to the last a great but discriminating admiration of both, and towards Maurice a warm affection. Except in that short and transitory phasis of his life, during which he made the mistake of becoming a clergyman, his mind was ever progressive: and the advance he always seemed to have made when I saw him after an interval, made me apply to him what Goethe said of Schiller, [...] "er hatte eine furchtliche Fortschreitung." [...] He and I started from intellectual points almost as wide apart as the poles, but the distance between us was always diminishing: if I made steps towards some of his opinions, he, during his short life, was constantly approximating more and more to several of mine: and if he had lived, and had health and vigour to prosecute his ever assiduous self-culture, there is no knowing how much further this spontaneous assimilation might have proceeded.|$|R
