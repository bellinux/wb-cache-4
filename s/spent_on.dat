5|$|According to critics, the {{inherent}} {{problem with this}} approach is that it relied heavily upon an assumption that Michelangelo only painted buon fresco, that he was always satisfied with the result {{at the end of the}} day, and that in four and a half years <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> the ceiling, he stuck exclusively to one approach, and never made small alterations or added details.

5|$|Allied {{air raids}} {{significantly}} influenced the Japanese government's decision to surrender. While the USSBS did not state that any single factor caused the surrender, during interrogations most Japanese wartime leaders nominated the prolonged air {{attacks on the}} home islands as {{the single most important}} factor which influenced their decision to end the war. In particular, Prime Minister Kantarō Suzuki stated that the combination of the conventional B-29 raids, Potsdam Declaration and atomic bombings gave the Government the opportunity to begin negotiations with the Allies. Emperor Hirohito cited damage from the attacks, inadequate preparations to resist invasion and the Soviet offensive as his justifications for authorizing the surrender. To achieve this, the American Twentieth Strategic Air Force, in concert with its Allies, dropped 160,800 tons of bombs on the Japanese home islands. Of this total, 147,000 tons of bombs were dropped by the B-29 bomber force. Around 90percent of the American tonnage fell in the last five months of the war. The financial cost of the campaign to the United States was $4 billion; this expenditure was much lower than the $30 billion <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> bomber operations in Europe, and a small proportion of the $330 billion the US Government <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> the war.|$|E
