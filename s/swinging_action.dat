40|$|Arm <b>swing</b> <b>action</b> is {{a natural}} {{phenomenon}} that emerges in biped locomotion. A shoulder torque reference generation method is introduced in this paper to utilize arms of a humanoid robot during locomotion. Main idea of the technique is the employment of shoulder joint actuation torques in order to stabilize body orientation. The reference torques are computed by a method which utilizes proportional and derivative actions. Body orientation angles serve as the inputs of this system. The approach is tested via simulations with the 3 D full-dynamics model of the humanoid robot SURALP (Sabanci University Robotics Research Laboratory Platform). Results indicate that the method is successful in reducing oscillations of body angles during bipedal walking...|$|R

50|$|The Barton Swing Aqueduct is a {{moveable}} navigable aqueduct in Barton upon Irwell, Greater Manchester, England. It {{carries the}} Bridgewater Canal across the Manchester Ship Canal.

The aqueduct, {{the first and only}} swing aqueduct in the world, is a Grade II* listed building, and considered a major feat of Victorian civil engineering.

50|$|His {{development}} and {{mastery of the}} Petrov/Bubka technical model is also considered a key to his success. (A technical model is a sequence of positions and pressures which describe the method and style form of pole vaulting.) The Petrov/Bubka model is considered superior to many others today, because it allows the vaulter to continuously put energy into the pole while rising towards the bar. Most conventional models focus on creating maximum bend in the pole before leaving the ground, by planting the pole heavily on the landing pad. The Petrov/Bubka model follows the technique used by Kjell Isaksson, which concentrates on driving the pole up, rather than bending it while planting it on the landing pad, combined with high running speed. While the traditional models depended on the recoil by bending the pole, the Petrov/Bubka model may exploit the recoil of the pole and exert more energy on the pole during the <b>swinging</b> <b>action.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Gears of War is a third-person shooter game, {{with its}} core {{concepts}} being derived from Resident Evil 4s [...] "over the shoulder" [...] perspective, Kill Switchs cover system, and Bionic Commandos <b>swinging</b> <b>action</b> akin to moving between points of cover. [...] The series focuses on using cover to tactically engage {{the enemy in}} battle to avoid taking damage. While behind cover, the player can fire blindly and inaccurately at their opponent, or can look around the cover and aim carefully, though exposing himself to enemy fire; the player can also slide along cover, move between nearby cover, or vault over cover to race to a new point of cover. As the player takes damage, the [...] "Crimson Omen" [...] appears on the HUD, becoming more defined as the player nears low health levels. The player can regenerate their health by staying out of harm's way for a short while. Should the player take too much damage, they will become incapacitated unless revived by a teammate; depending on game mode, the player {{may be able to}} recover from this state on their own, or may die after {{a short amount of time}} if not revived. When a combatant is down, a member of the other side may also attempt to execute the downed player via a [...] "curb stomp" [...] or other brutal methods. As well, some types of damage will immediately kill the player with no chance of revival, such as explosive damage. There are five levels on the first two games, but they are referred to as [...] "acts" [...] and each act is formed into a certain amount of chapters.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWind tunnels {{are often}} used when {{investigating}} the aerodynamic characteristics of sports balls, and {{have proven to be}} effective experimental equipment. However, wind tunnel experiments are fundamentally targeted at testing fixed steady states, so in some cases ball ejection units capable of unsteady states are needed. This research undertook the design and development of an impact type ball ejection unit with stable initial parameters and striking characteristics that make variable-state testing of sports balls possible. The kick arm swings due to an actuator activated by air-pressure, impacting a fixed ball. The <b>swing</b> <b>action</b> itself has 1 degree of freedom; however, there are 3 degrees of freedom for the alignment of the striker. The soccer ball may achieve a maximum velocity of 131 km/h when ejected, allowing a shooting speed of 100 km/h when the unit is operating at 70 % power. Further, it was found that there was a direct correlation between impact velocity and the initial velocity of the ball...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDeposited {{sediment}} removal or dredging {{is generally}} required in many hydro-system projects.

The equipped siphon generated larger scour holes in cohesive sediment type than that of the regular one and enhanced sediment removal process. This could be attributed to the <b>swinging</b> <b>action</b> of the siphon inlet which strikes the scour hole wall and acts against the cohesion property of the sediment...|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- We {{propose a}} water {{pollution}} source mapping {{system based on}} ubiquitous sensor networks that fish robots search the source of water pollution autonomously. To verify {{the effectiveness of a}} water pollution source mapping system, we made a model water pool in which a fish robot pursues infrared measurements of reflection to various colors {{at the bottom of the}} pool. The model of water pollution consists of various color maps, an LED emitting infrared, and a photo-transistor sensing the same wave length light. Different color has different reflectivity for the same light source; therefore this simulation model imitates the diffusion of water pollution sources. For real tests, an LED and the photo-transistor can be replaced with particular water pollution sensors. Water pollution maps can be composed based on the known mote location information by identifying motes. To get improved position data between the motes, directional sensors such as magneto-resistive sensors and accelerometers are applied to compensate noise components due to waves and the <b>swing</b> <b>actions</b> of the tail fin. Fish robots obtain simulated pollution data in terms of reflectivity autonomously...|$|R
