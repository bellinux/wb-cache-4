5|$|E. coli <b>stains</b> Gram-negative {{because its}} cell wall is {{composed}} of a thin peptidoglycan layer and an outer membrane. During the staining process, E. coli picks up {{the color of the}} counterstain safranin and <b>stains</b> pink. The outer membrane surrounding the cell wall provides a barrier to certain antibiotics such that E. coli is not damaged by penicillin.|$|E
5|$|An {{examination}} of the blood <b>stains</b> found inside 46Lower Belgrave Street demonstrated that Rivett had been attacked in the basement kitchen, while Lady Lucan had been attacked {{at the top of}} the basement stairs. The blood <b>stains</b> found inside the Ford Corsair were of the AB blood group; the report concluded that this might have been a mixture of blood from both women. Hair similar to Lady Lucan's was also found inside the car.|$|E
5|$|The flesh in {{the gills}} is {{composed}} of cylindrical hyphae measuring between 4 and 8μm thick that run parallel to one another. The hyphae typically have fairly thin, smooth walls, but {{they can have a}} small amount of brown pigment, which <b>stains</b> orange-brown in potassium hydroxide. The pileipellis, the uppermost layer of hyphae in the cap, forms a cutis made up of cylindrical, slightly thicker-walled hyphae of between 5 and 10μm wide. They can be interwoven or primarily extending from the margin to the centre. The pigmentation is yellowish-brown and <b>stains</b> reddish-brown in potassium hydroxide. The hyphae below the pileipellis run parallel to one another and measure between 4 and 8μm in width. Their yellowish-brown pigment <b>stains</b> orange-brown in potassium hydroxide. The stipitipellis, the uppermost layer of hyphae on the stem, also forms a cutis. The cylindrical hyphae run parallel to one another and have thick cell walls. They have a dark red-brown pigment, which <b>stains</b> darker still in potassium hydroxide. Clamp connections are present.|$|E

50|$|Simple <b>staining</b> is <b>staining</b> {{with only}} one stain/dye. There are various kinds of {{multiple}} <b>staining,</b> {{many of which are}} examples of counterstaining, differential <b>staining,</b> or both, including double <b>staining</b> and triple <b>staining.</b>|$|R

5|$|All Russulaceae, {{including}} the corticioid species, are characterised by spherical to elliptic basidiospores {{with a faint}} to very distinct (e.g. warty, spiny, or crested) ornamentation that <b>stains</b> bluish-black with Melzer's reagent (an amyloid stain reaction). Basidia (spore-bearing cells) are usually club-shaped and four-spored. Russulaceae species do not have clamp connections.|$|E
5|$|Discoloration {{of teeth}} {{may result from}} {{bacteria}} <b>stains,</b> tobacco, tea, coffee, foods {{with an abundance of}} chlorophyll, restorative materials, and medications. <b>Stains</b> from bacteria may cause colors varying from green to black to orange. Green <b>stains</b> also result from foods with chlorophyll or excessive exposure to copper or nickel. Amalgam, a common dental restorative material, may turn adjacent areas of teeth black or gray. Long term use of chlorhexidine, a mouthwash, may encourage extrinsic stain formation near the gingiva on teeth. This is usually easy for a hygienist to remove. Systemic disorders also can cause tooth discoloration. Congenital erythropoietic porphyria causes porphyrins to be deposited in teeth, causing a red-brown coloration. Blue discoloration may occur with alkaptonuria and rarely with Parkinson's disease. Erythroblastosis fetalis and biliary atresia are diseases which may cause teeth to appear green from the deposition of biliverdin. Also, trauma may change a tooth to a pink, yellow, or dark gray color. Pink and red discolorations are also associated in patients with lepromatous leprosy. Some medications, such as tetracycline antibiotics, may become incorporated into the structure of a tooth, causing intrinsic staining of the teeth.|$|E
2500|$|Other <b>staining</b> {{techniques}} include acid-fast <b>staining,</b> {{which will}} <b>stain</b> the oocysts red.

5|$|The oldest {{method of}} {{studying}} {{the brain is}} anatomical, and {{until the middle of}} the 20th century, much of the progress in neuroscience came from the development of better cell <b>stains</b> and better microscopes. Neuroanatomists study the large-scale structure of the brain as well as the microscopic structure of neurons and their components, especially synapses. Among other tools, they employ a plethora of <b>stains</b> that reveal neural structure, chemistry, and connectivity. In recent years, the development of immunostaining techniques has allowed investigation of neurons that express specific sets of genes. Also, functional neuroanatomy uses medical imaging techniques to correlate variations in human brain structure with differences in cognition or behavior.|$|E
5|$|Another {{similarly}} colored Russula is R.nigricans, {{which can}} be distinguished from R.densifolia by its darker cap and widely spaced gills. Another lookalike, R.dissimulans, has a dry cap surface, and a mild taste. R.albonigra <b>stains</b> directly to black when injured, and has a taste reminiscent of menthol. R.densifolia is often confused with R.acrifolia, but the latter's gills do not change color when bruised. R.adusta, found with conifers, has a less acrid taste, and its cut flesh changes to light pink rather than red.|$|E

5000|$|In the UK, the {{professional}} organisation for <b>stained</b> glass artists {{has been the}} British Society of Master Glass Painters, founded in 1921. Since 1924 the BSMGP has published an annual journal, The Journal of <b>Stained</b> Glass. It continues to be Britain's only organisation devoted exclusively to the art and craft of <b>stained</b> glass. From the outset, its chief objectives have been to promote and encourage high standards in <b>stained</b> glass painting and <b>staining,</b> {{to act as a}} locus for the exchange of information and ideas within the <b>stained</b> glass craft and to preserve the invaluable <b>stained</b> glass heritage of Britain. See www.bsmgp.org.uk for a range of <b>stained</b> glass lectures, conferences, tours, portfolios of recent <b>stained</b> glass commissions by members, and information on courses and the conservation of <b>stained</b> glass.

5|$|Fluorosurfactants {{are small}} organofluorine {{molecules}} used for repelling water and <b>stains.</b> Although expensive (comparable to pharmaceuticals at $200–2000 per kilogram), they yielded over $1 {{billion in annual}} revenues by 2006; Scotchgard alone generated over $300 million in 2000. Fluorosurfactants are a minority in the overall surfactant market, most of which is taken up by much cheaper hydrocarbon-based products.

5|$|The {{first real}} {{progress}} toward a modern understanding of nervous function, though, came from the investigations of Luigi Galvani, who discovered that a shock of static electricity applied to an exposed nerve of a dead frog could cause its leg to contract. Since that time, each major advance in understanding has followed more or less directly from {{the development of a}} new technique of investigation. Until the early years of the 20th century, the most important advances were derived from new methods for staining cells. Particularly critical was the invention of the Golgi stain, which (when correctly used) <b>stains</b> only a small fraction of neurons, but <b>stains</b> them in their entirety, including cell body, dendrites, and axon. Without such a stain, brain tissue under a microscope appears as an impenetrable tangle of protoplasmic fibers, in which it is impossible to determine any structure. In the hands of Camillo Golgi, and especially of the Spanish neuroanatomist Santiago Ramón y Cajal, the new stain revealed hundreds of distinct types of neurons, each with its own unique dendritic structure and pattern of connectivity.|$|E

Ricardo Flores stated in interviews that his daughter's body needed to be exhumed to gather the fingernail DNA evidence, and that her body had not been cremated for this reason.|$|E
5|$|Amanita regalis {{is easily}} {{distinguished}} from A.muscaria {{by the absence}} of any red color in the cap, and the yellow patches on the stem. If it is a form that has a pale-colored, yellowish-brown cap, Amanita regalis may be confused with the blusher (Amanita rubescens, edible). The latter species can be identified by the flesh-colored tinge it <b>stains</b> when cut or bruised, and also by the color of the flesh underneath the cuticle: A.regalis is yellowish while A.rubescens is white. Amanita pantherina has a similar color, but has white flesh below the cap cuticle, and a cup-shaped bulb with distinct margins around the edge.|$|E
