5|$|Morales led {{calls for}} President Sánchez de Lozada {{to step down}} over the death toll, gaining {{widespread}} support from the MAS, other activist groups, and the middle classes; with pressure building, Sánchez resigned and fled to Miami, Florida. He was replaced by Carlos Mesa, who tried {{to strike a balance}} between U.S. and cocalero demands, but whom Morales mistrusted. In November, Morales spent 24 hours with Cuban President Fidel Castro in Havana, and then met Argentinian President Nestor Kirchner. In the 2004 municipal election, the MAS became the country's largest national party, with 28.6% of all councilors in Bolivia. However, they had failed to win the mayoralty in any big cities, reflecting their inability to gain widespread support among the urban middle-classes. In Bolivia's wealthy <b>Santa</b> <b>Cruz</b> region, a strong movement for autonomy had developed under the leadership of the Pro <b>Santa</b> <b>Cruz</b> Committee (Comite Pro <b>Santa</b> <b>Cruz).</b> Favorable to neoliberal economics and strongly critical of the cocaleros, they considered armed insurrection to secede from Bolivia should MAS take power.|$|E
