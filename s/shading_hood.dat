50|$|In 1958, Loo {{designed}} his own bungalow house, {{known as}} Kington Loo’s house. The house was located on Girdle Road, Kenny Hill, and some {{described it as}} resembling “a startled tropical bird”. The structure was made of timber and brickwork masonry, and sported a pitched roof which harkened back to Malaya’s pre-war colonial traditions. Yet the house’s unusual geometry and its ‘V’-shaped columns placed it firmly within the modernist tradition.In 1961, Loo designed another ‘bungalow’, the Brunei house, the Sultan of Brunei gave the commission to Booty, Edwards and Partners with the stipulation that it be finished within fifty-five days. It cost $600,000 and was awarded the RIBA Bronze medal. More of a “istana” that a bungalow, the mansion was able to breathe with its system of natural ventilation, that included metal grillwork, glass louvres, along with <b>shading</b> <b>hoods,</b> canopies and overhangs, and both vertical and horizontal fins. The Borneo house has a perfectly square floor plan with spacious verandahs on all sides.|$|R
50|$|The {{post office}} has a gabled roof clad in {{corrugated}} iron with a decorative lantern {{on the roof}} ridge. The northern elevation has a projecting gable with an adjoining porch, over which the main roof is extended and is supported by paired timber posts. The main entrance is through the porch and is reached by stairs with timber handrails. There is a bank of triple sash windows in the gable and a sun <b>hood</b> <b>shades</b> these. Banks of windows are {{on either side of}} the building, those on the western side also <b>shaded</b> by a <b>hood.</b>|$|R
50|$|A row of {{horizontally}} hinged timber framed windows opens {{from the}} long eastern elevation. A short ramp running parallel {{to the side of}} the building leads to a double timber door located approximately in the middle of the elevation. A metal <b>hood</b> <b>shades</b> this door.|$|R
50|$|The {{elevation}} to Ashby Lane is very plain with a parapet which conceals {{the roof}} and slopes away to the rear. It has two sash windows <b>shaded</b> by sun <b>hoods,</b> as does the other side which now faces the ANZ bank across a narrow laneway.|$|R
6000|$|Before my eyes a Wanderer stood; [...] Her {{face from}} summer's noon-day heat [...] Nor bonnet <b>shaded,</b> nor the <b>hood</b> [...] Of that blue cloak which {{to her feet}} [...] Depended with a graceful flow; [...] Only she wore a cap as white as new-fallen snow. [...] 1832.|$|R
50|$|The church hall is {{a smaller}} building, also of weatherboard, with a gabled roof clad in {{corrugated}} iron. It has a porch and narrow rectangular windows <b>shaded</b> with <b>hoods.</b> The rear {{has been extended}} with part of a building, possibly recycled from elsewhere and incorporating a verandah and a large fixed window. This rear section, which does not contain windows along the side, may be the recycled billiard hall of local memory. The interior of the main room of the hall is lined with fibrous cement sheeting and cover strips. The floor is of narrow tongue and groove boards.|$|R
60|$|Fort {{stood at}} the end of the perambulator, and looked at that other fellow's baby. In the <b>shade</b> of the <b>hood,</b> with the frilly clothes, it seemed to him lying with its head downhill. It had {{scratched}} its snub nose and bumpy forehead, and it stared up at its mother with blue eyes, which seemed to have no underlids so fat were its cheeks.|$|R
50|$|The {{post office}} is a single {{storeyed}} timber building set on concrete stumps. It has a hipped roof clad in corrugated iron with a central projecting gable with the sign Yungaburra Post Office. The main roof extends {{on either side of}} the gable to cover twin porches that are accessed by stairs with timber handrails. That on the left contains the postal boxes and the main entrance. That on the right is currently sealed. There is a bank of triple sash windows in the central gable and a shingled <b>hood</b> <b>shades</b> these windows. Pairs of sash windows covered by hoods are {{on either side of the}} building. At the rear a modern awning shades the loading area.|$|R
50|$|The former {{residential}} quarters {{is situated}} {{to the east}} of the post office and in line with it. There is a projecting bay on the eastern side with a gabled roof and a verandah runs along the front of the residence in line with this. The front wall of a former bedroom opening onto this verandah has been opened onto the verandah to provide for a coffee shop. The post office section is on the corner and is accessed by one of two porches sitting to either side of a projecting gable and reached by timber stairs with timber balustrading. The eastern porch is now linked to the residence by a deck. The windows are <b>shaded</b> by sun <b>hoods</b> on timber brackets.|$|R

This entrance is flanked by single storey wings which continue the arcaded effect with arched windows, now filled with glass louvres. The windows in the upper storey and the side windows and porches on the lower storeys are <b>shaded</b> by sun <b>hoods</b> on cast iron brackets. Windows were double hung and timber framed: some of these have been replaced.|$|R
60|$|Tessa {{sat on the}} low stool, nursing her knees, for {{a minute}} or two, with her little soul poised in {{fluttering}} excitement on the edge of this pleasant transgression. It was quite irresistible. She had been commanded to make no acquaintances, and warned that if she did, all her new happy lot would vanish away, and be like a hidden treasure that turned to lead {{as soon as it was}} brought to the daylight; and she had been so obedient that when she had to go to church she had kept her face <b>shaded</b> by her <b>hood</b> and had pursed up her lips quite tightly. It was true her obedience had been a little helped by her own dread lest the alarming stepfather Nofri should turn up even in this quarter, so far from the Por' del Prato, and beat her at least, if he did not drag her back to work for him. But this old man was not an acquaintance; he was a poor stranger going to sleep in the outhouse, and he probably knew nothing of stepfather Nofri; and, besides, if she took him some supper, he would like her, and not want to tell anything about her. Monna Lisa would say she must not go and talk to him, therefore Monna Lisa must not be consulted. It did not signify what she found out after it had been done.|$|R
