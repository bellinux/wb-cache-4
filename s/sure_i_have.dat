500|$|When asked {{from where}} she draws {{consolation}} {{in the face of}} aging and death, Streep responded: [...] "Consolation? I'm not <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> it. I have a belief, I guess, {{in the power of the}} aggregate human attempt – the best of ourselves. In love and hope and optimism – you know, the magic things that seem inexplicable. Why we are the way we are. I do have a sense of trying to make things better. Where does that come from?" ...|$|E

[...] "Getting five gold medals is definitely great, but the times that I went, I know I could go a lot faster," [...] he said.

500|$|In {{relation}} to Swaminarayan's work and views, Gandhi remarked that [...] "the work accomplished by Swaminarayan in Gujarat could not {{and would never}} have been achieved by the law." [...] Scholars note close parallels between Gandhi's work and Swaminarayan's work related to non-violence, truth-telling, hygiene, temperance, and the uplift of masses. Commenting on Gandhi's social work, N.A. Toothi [...] "most of his thought, activities and even methods of most of the institutions which he has been building up and serving, have the flavor of Swaminarayanism, more than that of any other sect of Hindu Dharma." [...] He however did not feel that Swaminarayan's values aligned perfectly with his interpretation of Vaishnavism. In a letter dated 25 July 1918, to Manganlal Gandhi, he stated, “To be <b>sure,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> felt in all seriousness that Swaminarayan and Vallabhacharaya have robbed us of our manliness. They made the people incapable of self-defense... It was all to the good that people gave up drinking, smoking, etc., this, however, is not an end in itself, it only is a means. The love taught by Swaminarayan and Vallabh is all sentimentalism... Do not mix up the Vaishnava tradition with the teaching of Vallabha and Swaminarayan.” ...|$|E

2500|$|On {{his return}} to Vienna, his indisposition {{increased}} visibly and made him gloomily depressed. His wife was truly distressed over this. One day when she was driving in the Prater with him, {{to give him a}} little distraction and amusement, and they were sitting by themselves, Mozart began to speak of death, and declared that he was writing the Requiem for himself. Tears came to the eyes of the sensitive man: 'I feel definitely,' he continued, 'that I will not last much longer; I am <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been poisoned.
