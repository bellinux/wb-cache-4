50|$|Although {{there has}} been {{positive}} public reaction, experts have expressed doubts as {{to the effectiveness of}} the Photonic Fence in the field. According to Bart Knols, a mosquito and malaria expert, the system would not work because of high cost and troubles with electrical power in Africa (though there are reported plans to bundle with <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> <b>collector</b> and battery.

50|$|Radiant {{energy is}} one of the {{mechanisms}} by which energy can enter or leave an open system. Such a system can be man-made, such as a <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> <b>collector,</b> or natural, such as the Earth's atmosphere. In geophysics, most atmospheric gases, including the greenhouse gases, allow the Sun's short-wavelength radiant energy to pass through to the Earth's surface, heating the ground and oceans. The absorbed solar energy is partly re-emitted as longer wavelength radiation (chiefly infrared radiation), some of which is absorbed by the atmospheric greenhouse gases. Radiant energy is produced in the sun as a result of nuclear fusion.|$|E

50|$|For other purposes, {{there is}} often a tube, {{frequently}} a Dewar tube, which runs the length of the trough at its focal line. The mirror is oriented so that sunlight which it reflects is concentrated on the tube, which contains a fluid which is heated to a high temperature by the energy of the sunlight. The hot fluid can be used for many purposes. Often, it is piped to a heat engine, which uses the heat energy to drive machinery or to generate electricity. This <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> <b>collector</b> is the most common and best known type of parabolic trough. The paragraphs below therefore concentrate on this type.|$|E
50|$|In 2015, Baratunde A. Cola's {{research}} {{team at the}} Georgia Institute of Technology, developed a <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> <b>collector</b> that can convert optical light to DC current, an optical rectenna using carbon nanotubes,. Vertical arrays of multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) grown on a metal-coated substrate s were coated with insulating aluminum oxide and altogether capped with a metal electrode layer. The small dimensions of the nanotubes act as antennae, capable of capturing optical wavelengths. The MWCNT also doubles as one layer of a metal-insulator-metal (MIM) tunneling diode. Due to the small diameter of MWCNT tips, this combination forms a diode {{that is capable of}} rectifying the high frequency optical radiation. The overall achieved conversion efficiency of this device is around 10&minus;5 %. Nonetheless, optical rectenna research is ongoing. Future efforts have been undertaken to improve the device efficiency by investigating alternative materials, manipulating the MWCNTs to encourage conduction at the interface, and reduce resistances within the structure.|$|E
