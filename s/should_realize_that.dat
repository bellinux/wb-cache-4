25|$|It may be {{difficult}} to see where simultaneity came into the Doppler shift calculation, and indeed the calculation is often preferred because one does {{not have to worry about}} simultaneity. As seen above, the ship twin can convert his received Doppler-shifted rate to a slower rate of the clock of the distant clock for both red and blue images. If he ignores simultaneity, he might say his twin was aging at the reduced rate throughout the journey and therefore should be younger than he is. He is now back to square one, and has to take into account the change in his notion of simultaneity at the turnaround. The rate he can calculate for the image (corrected for Doppler effect) is the rate of the Earth twin's clock at the moment it was sent, not at the moment it was received. Since he receives an unequal number of red and blue shifted images, he <b>should</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> the red and blue shifted emissions were not emitted over equal time periods for the Earth twin, and therefore he must account for simultaneity at a distance.|$|E

A Storysnoops review noted that one of the themes was that [...] "it doesn't matter where you come from, only who you are inside". In Dawn, the importance of cooperation is explored. The four Clans, normally hostile to each other, are forced to work together in order to find a new home. Other themes that have been pointed out deal with family, loss, honor, bravery, death, loyalty, and following rules.|$|E

The series premiered on the Disney Channel on March 18, 2005, receiving four million viewers, making it the most successful premiere for the Disney Channel in 2005. Critics often praised Song's performance in the Suite Life series. An April 2009 andPOP.com article stated that as London Tipton, [...] "Song is the One to Steal the Spotlight" [...] on the Disney Channel. It said, [...] "if you ever watched an episode of 'The Suite Life with Zack & Cody' you <b>should</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> show is watchable because of one character: London Tipton.

According to The Economist, the name was chosen because Muslims, Jews, and Christians created a center of learning in Córdoba together. The name was criticized; for example, Newt Gingrich {{said that it was}} [...] "a deliberately insulting term" [...] that symbolizes the Muslim conquerors' victory over Christian Spaniards, and noted that the Muslims had converted a Cordoba church into the third largest mosque in the world. Similarly, Raymond Ibrahim, a former associate director of the Middle East Forum, said the project and name were not [...] "a gesture of peace and interfaith dialogue" [...] but were [...] "allusive of Islamic conquest and consolidation" [...] and that Americans <b>should</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> mosques are not [...] "Muslim counterparts to Christian churches" [...] but rather, [...] "are symbols of domination and centers of radicalization".

2500|$|Nachmanides {{noted that}} [...] {{mentioned}} {{a reason for}} the offerings – that they are [...] "a fire-offering, of a pleasing odor to the Eternal." [...] Nachmanides rejected the argument that the offerings were meant to eliminate the foreigners' foolish ideas, for the sacrifices would not have that effect, as the foreigners' intention was to worship the constellations of the sheep and the ox, and if Jews slaughtered sheep and oxen to God, it would show respect and honor to those constellations. Nachmanides further noted that when Noah came out of the ark, there were as yet no Chaldeans or Egyptians in the world, yet Noah brought an offering that pleased God so much that [...] reports that on its account God said, [...] "I will not again curse the ground anymore for man's sake." [...] Similarly, Abel brought of the first-born of his flock and [...] reports that [...] "the Eternal had regard to Abel and to his offering," [...] but there had not yet been a trace of idol worship in the world. In [...] Balaam said, [...] "I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar," [...] but his intent was not to eradicate evil beliefs from Balak's mind, but rather to approach God so that God's communication would reach Balaam. Nachmanides argued that the reason for the offerings was more likely that since people's deeds are accomplished through thought, speech, and action, therefore God commanded that when people sin and bring an offering, they should lay their hands on it in contrast to the evil deed that they committed. Offerers would confess their sin verbally to contrast with their evil speech. They would burn parts of the animal in fire that were seen as the instruments of thought and desire in human beings. The offerers would burn the legs of the animal because they corresponded to the limbs with which the offerer acted. The offerer sprinkled blood on the altar, which is analogous to the blood in the offerer's body. Nachmanides argued that offerers performed these acts so that the offerers <b>should</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> the offerers had sinned against God with their bodies. And the offerer's soul and blood should have been spilled and the offerer's body burned, were it not for God's loving-kindness in taking a substitute and a ransom – the offering – so that the offering's blood should be in place of the offerer's blood, its life in place of the offerer's life, and that the limbs of the offering in place of the parts of the offerer's body.|$|E
