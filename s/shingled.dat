5|$|Charles A. Dibble (born 1836 in Saratoga County, New York), {{by various}} {{accounts}} a railroad man, livery stable owner, and Civil War veteran, lived in Eldon {{in the late}} nineteenth century. He and his wife, Catharine, began building the house in 1881 for themselves and their eight children. Its relatively simple board-and-batten siding, white color, and moderate size—just —were quite common in nineteenth century Iowa architecture. A similar style can be observed in the birthplace of President Herbert Hoover in West Branch, built a decade before the American Gothic House, which features board-and-batten siding, a simple <b>shingled</b> roof, a central chimney, white color, and a moderate size as well. Unique and unusual exterior features of the house include its two Gothic windows in the gable and its steep-pitched roof. Both features would later be exaggerated by Grant Wood in American Gothic. The lower floor of the house contains three rooms and a bathroom, while the upper floor has two bedrooms. The house has been called the best-known example of a Carpenter Gothic cottage in the United States.|$|E
5|$|In the {{tradition}} of many of her royal Merina predecessors, the queen ruled from the royal Rova compound in Antananarivo. Between 1839 and 1842, Jean Laborde built the queen a new residence called Manjakamiadana, which became the largest structure on the Rova grounds. The residence was made entirely from wood and bore most {{of the features of}} a traditional home of the Merina andriana (aristocratic class), including a central pillar (andry) to support the roof. In other ways it showcased distinctly European innovations, as it contained three floors entirely surrounded by wooden verandas and incorporated dormers in the <b>shingled</b> roof. The palace would eventually be encased in stone in 1867 by James Cameron of the London Missionary Society during the reign of Ranavalona II. The original wooden palace of Ranavalona and virtually all other structures of the historic Rova compound were destroyed in a 1995 fire, leaving only the stone shell to mark where her palace had once stood.|$|E
5|$|More than 930,000policyholders in South Florida lost {{coverage}} after 11insurance companies went bankrupt, {{caused by}} more than 600,000insurance claims filed. This led the Florida Legislature to create new entities, such as the Joint Underwriting Association, the Florida Windstorm Underwriting Association, and the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund, {{in an effort to}} restore adequate insurance capacity. Stricter building codes were created in Florida in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew. A survey by Tim Marshall and Richard Herzog of the Haag Engineer Company in Carrollton, Texas, highlighted several construction issues. On the roof of some homes, the concrete tiles were glued to felt paper, which could easily be ripped by straight line winds. At houses with <b>shingled</b> roofs, it was found that some of the shingles were stapled perpendicular to the long axis, also allowing them to be torn away. After the tiles or shingles were peeled off, the plywood and prefabricated trusses were exposed to the weather. Eventually, the plywood and the trusses suffered structural failure, leading to roof collapses.|$|E

5000|$|Many {{shapes and}} textures of asphalt <b>shingles</b> are available: 3 tab, jet, [...] "signature cut", Art-Loc, t-lock, tie lock, etc. Architectural ({{laminated}}) <b>shingles</b> are a multi-layer, laminated <b>shingle</b> which gives more varied, contoured visual effect to a roof surface and add more resistance for water. These <b>shingles</b> {{are designed to}} avoid repetitive patterns in the <b>shingle</b> appearance. Special <b>shingles</b> are needed for the eaves starter course and ridge caps. Laminated <b>shingles</b> are heavier and more durable than traditional 3-tab <b>shingle</b> designs.|$|R
5|$|The Anderson Street Station had a wood {{siding with}} a <b>shingled</b> roof, two brick {{chimneys}} {{off the roof}} and two asphalt platforms in both directions. The station also had a garage door on the southern side of the building. No official style of architecture was mentioned for Anderson Street in the 1920 Final Engineering Report {{due to lack of}} design. Nearby, a wooden watchman's shanty was constructed near the team track. The station had two tracks run through it (one main track and a team track) and had a rail crossing between tracks. By 1870, the tracks had been extended northward to Hillsdale, and public service began on the line on March 4 of that year. Trains terminated at Hillsdale with fare of only $0.75 (1870 USD), but just one year later, the extension northward. The service was extended northward to the community of Haverstraw, New York, and in 1896, the rail line was leased by the private company to the Erie Railroad.|$|E

50|$|Fiberglass <b>shingles</b> {{are slowly}} {{replacing}} organic felt <b>shingles</b> and by 1982 {{the production of}} fiberglass <b>shingles</b> overtook organic <b>shingles.</b> Widespread hurricane damage in Florida during the 1990s prompted the industry to adhere to a 1700-gram tear value on finished asphalt <b>shingles.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Shingle</b> {{fabrication}} was revolutionized in {{the early}} 19th century by steam-powered saw mills. <b>Shingle</b> mills made possible the production of uniform <b>shingles</b> in mass quantities. The sawn <b>shingle</b> of uniform taper and smooth surface eliminated the need to hand dress. The supply of wooden <b>shingles</b> was therefore no longer limited by local factors. These changes coincided with (and in turn increased) the popularity of architectural styles such as Carpenter Gothic, Queen Anne, and <b>Shingle</b> style architecture that used <b>shingles</b> to great effect.|$|R
50|$|<b>Shingle</b> is a {{corruption}} of German schindle (schindel) meaning a roofing slate. <b>Shingles</b> historically were called tiles and <b>shingle</b> was a term applied to wood <b>shingles,</b> as is still mostly the case outside the US.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{addresses}} the wind-induced tearing and blow-off of asphalt roofing <b>shingles,</b> {{which are the}} most frequently observed forms of residential building damage in hurricanes. Field surveys indicate that in-service asphalt <b>shingle</b> sealant strips can lose adhesion along their leading edge over time, leaving the <b>shingle</b> partially unsealed and susceptible to wind uplift. Two interrelated studies {{presented in this paper}} show that unsealing is a naturally occurring process and that unsealed <b>shingles</b> are a contributing cause of <b>shingle</b> roof cover damage in high winds. The first study quantified the number, location, and failure mode of laminate and three-tab style <b>shingle</b> systems installed on residential buildings at 30 sites in Florida and Texas. Systematic patterns of partially unsealed field <b>shingles</b> found on 22 of the 30 roofs resembled spatial patterns of wind-induced <b>shingle</b> damage observed in post-hurricane building performance assessments. As expected, older roofs generally contained more unsealed <b>shingles</b> than newer roofs. The results of the second study link blow-off to partially unsealed <b>shingles.</b> Seventeen ASTM D 7158 Class H asphalt <b>shingle</b> roofs were aged outside for nominally one year at the Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety Research Center and then evaluated in full-scale wind tunnel tests. Partially unsealed field and hip <b>shingles</b> frequently exhibited damage during wind testing, while fully sealed <b>shingles</b> were not damaged unless adjacent, unsealed <b>shingles</b> failed first...|$|R

50|$|Solar <b>shingles,</b> {{also called}} {{photovoltaic}} <b>shingles,</b> are solar panels {{designed to look}} like and function as conventional roofing materials, such as asphalt <b>shingle</b> or slate, while also producing electricity.

50|$|Roof <b>shingles</b> {{are almost}} always highly visible and so are an {{important}} aspect of a building's aesthetics in patterns, textures and colors. Roof <b>shingles,</b> like other building materials on vernacular buildings, are typically of a material locally available. The type of <b>shingle</b> is taken into account before construction because the material affects the roof pitch and construction method: Some <b>shingles</b> can be installed on lath where others need solid sheathing (sheeting) on the roof deck. All <b>shingle</b> roofs are installed from the bottom upward beginning with a starter course and the edge seams offset to avoid leaks. Many <b>shingle</b> installations benefit from being placed on top of an underlayment material such as asphalt felt paper to prevent leaks even from wind driven rain and snow and ice dams in cold climates. At the ridge the <b>shingles</b> {{on one side of the}} roof simply extend past the ridge or there is a ridge cap consisting of boards, copper, or lead sheeting. An asphalt <b>shingle</b> roof has flexible asphalt <b>shingles</b> as the ridge cap. Some roof <b>shingles</b> are non-combustable or have a better fire rating than others which influence their use, some building codes do not allow the use of <b>shingles</b> with less than a class-A fire rating to be used on some types of buildings. Due to increased fire hazard, wood <b>shingles</b> and organic-based asphalt <b>shingles</b> have become less common than fiberglass-based asphalt <b>shingles.</b> No <b>shingles</b> are water-tight so the minimum recommended roof pitch is 4:12 without additional underlayment materials.|$|R

50|$|Asbestos <b>shingles</b> are roof or wall <b>shingles</b> {{made with}} {{asbestos}} cement board.
