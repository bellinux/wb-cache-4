25|$|I admire {{a lot of}} what's {{going on}} out there, but the {{oversize}} kind of cartoon action movies is not something I'm terribly comfortable with. I think what I do is much more in the tradition that the bullets are real and they'll knock you down. I used to really get criticized for my lack of realism, but now I think my films {{are perceived to be}} vastly more realistic than most of the action movies that are happening out there... I {{think one of the things}} about being a director is, you should always try to re-create within yourself the kind of emotions you had watching film when you were very young. The kind of action movies that I always liked, the kind of comic books I always liked, were the serious ones. The characters were very realistic within the framework of the drama, and that kind of action movie interests me a lot more than the super-heroes. And <b>so</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>sense,</b> maybe I'm slightly out of step, I suppose, but so be it.|$|E

He never stopped to think, 'oh, I might {{get in trouble}} for this,' <b>so</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>sense</b> he was very selfless." [...] He was succeeded as J-FLAG's leader by Gareth Williams, who informed press that Williamson [...] "was the only out gay person in Jamaica who {{had the courage to}} put his face on television, I was very close to him... His murder was really a traumatic loss for our community." [...] One member of J-FLAG stated that [...] "Brian Williamson is our Martin Luther King". Four days later, J-FLAG held a memorial devoted to Williamson, which was attended by almost two hundred people; the memorial involved personal tributes, poetry slams, and lip synching to Whitney Houston songs.|$|E
500|$|On 25 June 2007, in an {{unexpected}} turn of events, Henry {{was transferred to}} Barcelona for €24million. He signed a four-year deal for a reported €6.8 (£4.6) million per season. It was revealed that the contract included a release clause of €125 (£84.9) million. Henry cited the departure of Dein and continued uncertainty over Wenger's future as reasons for leaving, and maintained that [...] "I always said that if I ever left Arsenal {{it would be to}} play for Barcelona." [...] Despite their captain's departure, Arsenal got off to an impressive start for the 2007–08 campaign, and Henry admitted that his presence in the team might have been more of a hindrance than a help. He stated, [...] "Because of my seniority, the fact that I was captain and my habit of screaming for the ball, they would sometimes give it to me even when I was not in the best position. <b>So</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>sense</b> it was good for the team that I moved on." [...] Henry left Arsenal as the club's leading all-time league goalscorer with 174 goals and leading all-time goalscorer in European competitions with 42 goals; in July 2008, Arsenal fans voted him as Arsenal's greatest player ever in Arsenal.com's Gunners' Greatest 50 Players poll.|$|E

The choice she made as an actress was, in playing the outsider in the Ewing family, she actually maintained somewhat of an outsider position with the cast as social equals. She didn't {{do a lot of}} the hanging out social activities that a lot of us did because we were together so much. <b>So</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>sense,</b> she was maybe a few percentage points removed from the swirl that was the social center of our group.

Steve Kanaly was included in that group, and we would go up together, and Steve and I would take other trips together. We were a group, and Linda Gray was also a member of that group. Victoria was always slightly outside and didn't participate in those things. It was her own choice and she felt it was conducive to her playing the part of Pamela.

2500|$|Living for the Weekend {{garnered}} mixed reviews, with critics {{noticing the}} lack of personality and direction. Robert Copsey of Digital Spy called the album [...] "a compilation of perfectly serviceable pop" [...] but felt that [...] "as a group, the Saturdays sound lost." [...] Elliot Robinson of So So Gay wrote that the record [...] "occasionally perpetuate the more faceless dance pop its predecessor unfortunately introduced to the girls' sound" [...] and that it [...] "does feel rather calculated at times with some generic filler tracks." [...] However, he called it [...] "an enjoyable romp" [...] and [...] "an improvement over previous effort On Your Radar." [...] Christopher Toh of Today wrote that [...] "it’s not the best {{album of the year}} by any means, but it is great as background music for your weekend party, <b>so</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>sense,</b> it works." [...] Another common criticism among reviewers was the difference in quality between the album's first and second half. Jon O'Brien of omg! noticed that [...] "like its predecessor, [...] {{the latter part of the}} record is virtually indistinguishable thanks to an over-reliance on the hands-in-the-air dance-pop that has dominated the charts since the rise of David Guetta et al" [...] and stated that [...] "if the Sats could have sustained the momentum of its opening half, then Living For The Weekend could have been a late contender for pop album of the year." [...] The reviewer of the Shields Gazette noticed the same problem, but found the second half [...] "inconsequential as opposed to horrid," [...] saying that [...] "it lacks personality in places, but it’s a better effort than many would expect from a group commonly [...] likened to a third-rate Girls Aloud." [...] Matthew Horton of Virgin Media noted that the album contains the band's [...] "best run of singles [...] ever," [...] but otherwise felt that it [...] "drags" [...] and that it is [...] "at least two tracks too long." [...] Angus Quinn of York Vision felt the same way, stating that the record [...] "really struggles once you're past the singles" [...] and that [...] "the album tracks could fit into almost anyone else's repertoire." [...] Patrick Gough of the Bournemouth Daily Echo found that [...] "the quality is strong and consistent for the first seven tracks, but after last year's single 30 Days, the songs become more generic" [...] and felt that [...] "the Saturdays have bags of charm and style but their identity gets a little lost towards the end of this album." [...] Darryl Sterdan of the Canadian Winnipeg Sun gave a negative review, describing the album as [...] "instantly forgettable pop, R and dance piffle about boys" [...] and saying that the band [...] " [...] best be living for the weekend, since that’s about as long as this will be on anybody’s playlist." [...] A more favorable review came from AllMusic's Matt Collar, who noticed that Living for the Weekend [...] "attempts to build upon the group's heightened profile with a bevy of infectious pop, soul, and electronic dance-club cuts that showcase the girls’ resonant vocal chops" [...] and described it as [...] "an album of delicious pop" [...] that [...] "goes a long way toward helping the Saturdays achieve their dreams of worldwide diva domination." [...] Daniel Falconer of female-oriented webzine FemaleFirst wrote that [...] "the Saturdays are the girl group of today, and continue to go from strength to strength" [...] and awarded the album four out of five stars.|$|E
6000|$|He {{therefore}} didn't [...] "run," [...] as {{he would}} have said, to winged words any more than he was forced to, having, moreover, a sense that apologetic work (if apology it should be called to carry the war straight into the enemy's country) might be freely left to Gabriel Nash. He laid the weight of explanation on his commentators, meeting them all on the firm ground of his own amusement. He saw he should live for months in a thick cloud of irony, not the finest air of the season, and he adopted the weapon to which a person whose use of tobacco is only occasional resorts when every one else produces a cigar--he puffed the spasmodic, defensive cigarette. He accepted as to what he had done the postulate of the obscurely tortuous, abounding <b>so</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>sense</b> that his critics were themselves bewildered. Some of them felt that they got, as the phrase is, little out of him--he rose in his good humour so much higher than the [...] "rise" [...] they had looked for--on his very first encounter with the world after his scrimmage with his mother. He went to a dinner-party--he had accepted the invitation many days before--having seen his resignation, {{in the form of a}} telegram from Harsh, announced in the evening papers. The people he found there had seen it as well, and the wittiest wanted to know what he was now going to do. Even the most embarrassed asked if it were true he had changed his politics. He gave different answers to different persons, but left most of them under the impression that he had strange scruples of conscience. This, however, was not a formidable occasion, for there had happened to be no one present he would have desired, on the old basis, especially to gratify. There were real good friends it would be less easy to meet--Nick was almost sorry for an hour that he had so many real good friends. If he had had more enemies the case would have been simpler, and he was fully aware that the hardest thing of all would be to be let off too easily. Then he would appear to himself to have been put, all round, on his generosity, and his deviation would thus wear its ugliest face.|$|E

5000|$|The ISO {{standard}} {{raw image}} format is ISO 12234-2, {{better known as}} TIFF/EP. (TIFF/EP also supports [...] "non-raw", or [...] "processed", images).

For example, Nikon's NEF raw files are based on TIFF/EP, and include a tag which identifies the version of TIFF/EP they are based on. Adobe's DNG raw file format was based on TIFF/EP, and the DNG specification states [...] "DNG ... is compatible with the TIFF-EP standard".

5000|$|This {{standard}} has {{not been}} adopted by most camera manufacturers - Exif/DCF is the current industry standard file organisation system which uses the Exchangeable image file format.

50|$|The work is {{remarkable}} for {{the level of}} colour-printing craftmanship displayed by the Belgian lithographers Severeyns, Stroobant, and De Pannemaker.
