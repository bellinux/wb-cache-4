40|$|The {{performance}} of pinhole single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) {{depends on the}} spatial resolution of the gamma-ray detectors used. Pinhole cameras suffer from strong resolution loss due to the varying depth-of-interaction (DOI) of gamma quanta that enter the detector material at an angle. We eliminate DOI effects in a <b>scintillation</b> <b>gamma</b> <b>camera</b> via a dedicated optic fiber bundle {{that acts as a}} focusing collimator for light generated in a scintillation crystal. A curved crystal is connected to a concavely shaped fiber-optic bundle such that the fibers connect perpendicularly to the crystal's convex surface and point straight at the pinhole opening. Limiting the fiber numerical apertures can be used to suppress resolution losses due to light spread. Here we demonstrate experimentally that this prototype position-sensitive gamma sensor successfully eliminates DOI effects, and has an intrinsic resolution of better than 280 µm full width at half maximum with an interaction probability of 67 % for 140 keV photons. Therefore, the detector has great potential for increasing the resolution of pinhole SPECT. RRR/Radiation, Radionuclides and ReactorsApplied Science...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: SPECT {{projections}} are {{contaminated by}} scatter radiation, resulting in reduced image contrast and quantitative errors. In SPECT, backscatter constitutes {{a major part}} of the scatter contamination in lower energy windows. In this paper, the effects of backscatter material thickness were investigated. Methods: SIMIND monte carlo program was used for simulation of a Siemen's dual-head variable angle <b>scintillation</b> <b>gamma</b> <b>camera.</b> Planar and SPECT images of 99 mTc sources for varying thickness of Perspex slabs, as backscatter media, were analyzed using the photopeak and scatter windows. Results: In the 99 mTc photopeak window no significant change in total counts due to backscatter material was measured. In the scatter windows an explicit influence of backscatter material was measured. For instance, at a thickness of 10 cm, total counts of a 99 mTc source detected in the 72 keV windows eventually doubled with increasing backscatter material, compared to the situation without backscatter material. The backscatter contribution plateaued when more than 5 - 10 cm of scatter material was placed but there was an optimized result for a backscatter thickness of 4. 5 cm. Conclusion: In conclusion, backscatter should be taken into account, particularly in model based scatter correction methods in SPECT for a simulation system optimizatio...|$|E
40|$|For the {{development}} and improvement of multi-pinhole SPECT systems, high-resolution <b>gamma</b> <b>cameras</b> can be essential. Electron-multiplying charge-coupled devices (EMCCDs) have a high resolution and sensitivity and therefore can be extremely useful for application in photon-counting <b>scintillation</b> <b>gamma</b> <b>cameras.</b> The <b>scintillation</b> crystal captures the gamma photons and converts their energy into (visible) light photons, which are detected by the EMCCD. A very low readout noise and a high sensitivity (over 90 % for the visible spectrum) enable these devices to detect individual gamma interactions in the crystal. Algorithms {{have been developed to}} analyze the EMCCD images for the presence of the scintillation events and provide estimates of their position and energy content. The first photon-counting <b>gamma</b> <b>camera</b> based on EMCCDs was demonstrated in our group in 2005.

40|$|Charge Coupled Devices (CCDs) {{optically}} coupled to scintillation crystals {{can be used}} to construct high resolution <b>gamma</b> <b>cameras.</b> Previously, several groups have reported intrinsic detector spatial resolutions below 100 microns. When the CCD images can be read out fast enough, the energy and interaction position of individual gamma quanta can be estimated by a real-time image analysis of the scintillation light flashes. The Electron-Multiplying CCD (EMCCD) is well-suited for fast read out, since even at high frame rates it has extremely low readout noise. However, due to the often very low light levels present in <b>scintillation</b> <b>gamma</b> <b>cameras,</b> further reduction of noise is desirable. Here, the EMCCD is {{optically coupled}} to a 1000 - µ-thick columnar CsI(Tl) crystal for Tc- 99 m and I- 125 imaging. We investigate noise reduction through summing of signals in pixels before the gain register and readout circuit of the EMCCD (“pixel binning”). We compare the energy and spatial resolution, photopeak efficiency (PE) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of an EMCCD-based <b>gamma</b> <b>camera</b> for the case of binning vs. non-binning. When pixels were read out simultaneously in groups of 4 the spatial resolution is slightly worse in the direction of binning, but the number of false-positive counts resulting from background noise for I- 125 was reduced by 74 % compared to the no binning case. We conclude that the use of charge binning when reading out EMCCDs may significantly improve the energy spectra and noise properties of CCD-based high-resolution <b>gamma</b> <b>cameras.</b> Radiation, Radionuclides and ReactorsApplied Science...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of medical imaging techniques has dramatically changed clinical practice and biomedical {{science in the}} 20 th century. Nuclear Medicine imaging techniques reveal the function of organs and tissues in vivo {{with the aid of}} radioactively labeled tracer molecules. These techniques, such as Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET), are clinically applied in the fields of neurology, oncology, cardiology, skeletal and thyroid imaging. Applied to small animals, these techniques are important tools in {{development of}} better diagnostics and new drugs and fundamental biological research. For small animal SPECT systems, pinhole magnification enables image resolutions below 0. 3 mm using conventional Anger cameras with an intrinsic spatial resolution of only 3 to 4 mm. There is a large desire to improve the spatial resolution of the gamma detectors to further improve the preclinical and clinical SPECT performance as well as to make systems more compact. This thesis focuses on EM-CCD based <b>scintillation</b> <b>gamma</b> <b>cameras</b> with a very high spatial resolution, more than 10 times better than conventional Anger cameras. Therefore these EM-CCD <b>gamma</b> <b>cameras</b> are a candidate {{for the next generation of}} pre-clinical-SPECT scanners. In pinhole SPECT cameras the spatial resolution is severely degraded for gamma photons incident at an angle, called the depth-of-interaction effect. We showed that this effect can be overcome using a novel curved scintillator geometry which results in a scintillation light centroid independent of the depth-of-interaction. Alternatively we strongly reduced the depth-of-interaction effect by using a multi scale algorithm that detects the scintillation depth. This depth is determined by modelling the variation of the scintillation light spread with depth. If we also take the statistics of the detector into account using a Maximum Likelihood scintillation detection algorithm the energy resolution of the detector improves significantly. Furthermore, using the Cramer Rao lower bound we showed that the EM-CCD based <b>gamma</b> <b>camera</b> performance is very sensitive to the scintillator light yield and the Clock Induced Charge (CIC) and dark current noise. A feasible reduction of these noise sources would improve the <b>gamma</b> <b>camera</b> performance significantly. RRRApplied Science...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} few years our {{interest}} was dedicated to the development of small field of view imagers for Nuclear Medicine applications, particularly in Oncology. Some years ago, the authors have described an original <b>scintillation</b> <b>gamma</b> <b>camera</b> based on a matrix of 2 x 2 R 5900 -C 8 Hamamatsu Position Sensitive PhotoMultiplier Tube (PSPMT) coupled to a scintillating array. The intrinsic spatial resolution obtained was adequate for high-resolution imaging applications. On the contrary, the prototype was affected by reduced performances at the borders between PSPMT. The subsequent introduction by Hamamatsu of the R 7600 flange-less PSPMT family allowed to reduce the dead areas at the borders. Furthermore, Hamamatsu R 7600 -C 12 model, improving the charge sampling with lower anode pitch, allows to improve the spatial resolution and to optimize the spatial response. Good performance was obtained with 2 x 2 R 5900 -C 8 PSPMT array with a Combined Array-Planar Crystal (CAPC) geometry, designed by the authors. It consists of a planar crystal segmented in the top in a 15 x 15 array, 3 mm square pixel, 1 mm thick, and 0. 25 mm gap.

This prototype, realized jointly with Nuclear Fields, is a lead parallel hole collimator with 1. 0 mm hexagonal hole, 18 mm length, 0. 2 mm septa and 10 x 10 cm(2) of useful detection area. It has been planned to match the high spatial resolution performances of a compact gamma camera based on LaBr(3) :Ce continuous scintillation crystal.

To improve this diagnostic technique,a new concept of <b>scintillation</b> <b>gamma</b> <b>camera,</b> which fits the best requirements for functional breast imaging has been developed under "Integrated Mammographic Imaging" (IMI) project. This camera consists of a large detection head (6 " x 7 "),very compact sized and with light weight to be easily positioned in the same X-ray geometry. The detection head consists of matrix of 42 photodetector Hamamatsu 1 in(2) square H 8520 -C 12 PSPMTs, which are closely packed and coupled to a NaI(Tl) scintillating array, with individual crystal pixel 2 x 2 x 6 mm(3) size. Large FoV camera shows a very good pixel identification in the detection dead zones between tubes allowing an accurate LUT correction of the final image reconstruction. Electronic read-out was especially designed to optimize the intrinsic spatial resolution and camera compactness. With respect to Anger camera, the overall spatial resolution is improved up to 40 % while the overall energy resolution values is similar to 16 % at 140 keV.

In previous studies, PSAPDs were coupled to scintillator arrays and the imaging task consisted in identifying the crystal of interaction.

The spatial resolution of a small imaging unit having a continuous scintillator coupled to an 8 x 8 mm(2) PSAPD was evaluated at different energies for CsI:TI and LaBr 3 :Ce crystals. After correcting the images for the distortion and the minification associated with this camera, spatial resolution values of 0. 62, 0. 72, 0. 99, and 1. 25 mm (FWHM) were obtained for Tc- 99 m (140 keV), Co- 57 (122 keV), Am- 241 (60 keV), and 1251 (30 keV) respectively for an 8 x 8 x 1 mm(3) CsI:TI crystal.

40|$|Introduction: In SPECT the {{collimator}} is {{a crucial}} element of the imaging chain and controls the noise resolution tradeoff of the collected data. The detection of photons in SPECT is seriously affected by collisions of the photons with atoms inside the patient (photon attenuation and scatter), and the inevitable inaccuracy of the collimator used (collimator blurring). The images are also severely degraded because of noise, {{partly due to the}} Poisson nature of the photon emission. Accordingly, {{it is very difficult to}} obtain high quality and quantitative accurate SPECT images. The lead x-rays, collimator scatter and partial energy deposition in the detector crystal are the effects that contribute to the 99 mTc camera down-scatter in the energy range of 100 &plusmn; 10 %keV or 72 &plusmn; 10 %. The current study is an evaluation of the effects of low energy high resolution collimator thickness, commonly used in SPECT, on tomographic spatial resolution.

40|$|ABSTRACT The Bachelors Paper {{deals with}} the {{question}} of measurement of radioiodine accumulation in thyroid gland using <b>scintillation</b> probe and <b>gamma</b> <b>camera</b> by comparison of both the measurement methods. In the course of last fifty years, the 131 I was thought to be safe and effective remedy in case of thyroid gland disorders, among which there are for instance hyperthyroidism or differentiated struma maligna. The method experienced its boom after the WW 2 when 131 I began to be produced in large quantities. The method of treatment is easy. The patient is administered a high dose (activity) of radioactive iodine, which is absorbed by thyroid. In case of patients suffering from hyperthyroidism the function of thyroid is subsequently reduced. After completion of the treatment, such patients are dependent on hormone replacement therapy using thyroid hormones. In case of patients suffering from struma maligna, the first solution is its surgical removal and after union of the scar, similar treatment is applied to remove small residues. The activity administered is even higher. The purpose is to destroy all pieces of thyroid gland tissue and metastases of differentiated struma maligna. At the present time, the level of accumulation of radioiodine in thyroid gland is measured and calculated on the basis of values of impulses acquired by means of scintillation probe, which is regarded as a standard procedure. The goal of the paper is to find out whether it is possible to obtain more accurate values of accumulation using the existing <b>gamma</b> <b>cameras</b> for scanning impulses above the area of thyroid gland. Another goal is to use the obtained values for the purpose of calculation of iodine accumulation. If measurement realized by means of the camera appears to be more accurate, I intended to propose its use as a new standard. I realized the respective measurements using <b>scintillation</b> probe and <b>gamma</b> <b>camera.</b> Measurement using probe is carried out in the prone position with the head bent back and the probe is at a distance of 25 centimetres from the patients neck.

Approximately 5 - 7 m Ci of 99 m Tc [...] DTPA in about 0. 5 ml of saline is injected intravenously and sequential 20 sec frames were acquired; the study on each patient lasts for approximately 20 mins. The time-activity curves of the parenchymal region of each kidney, as well as the heart were obtained for further analysis. The data were then analyzed using deconvolution and the Rutland-Patlak (R-P) plot. The values of the renal parenchymal mean transit time (PMTT) obtained by applying matrix inversion deconvolution method are significantly higher than that obtained by the 2 Rutland-Patlak plot (P = 0. 013). A strong positive correlation (n = 33; r = 0. 80; R = 0. 64) was found between the values that obtained by applying the two methods. From a Bland-Altman statistical test that was performed on the results we also found that 94 % of the cases (32 / 33) were within 1. 96 SD. We believe that Rutland-Patlak analysis method is expected to be more reproducible than matrix inversion deconvolution method, because the deconvolution technique relies heavily on the accuracy of the first point analyzed (plateau point), as any errors are carried forward into the calculations of all the subsequent points, whereas R-P technique is based on an initial analysis of the data by means of the R-P plot (slope of the first phase) and it can be considered as an alternative technique to find and calculate the renal PMTT.

In conclusion, the TCOG method is an effective approach to developing high-resolution compact <b>gamma</b> <b>camera.</b> This method {{can also be used}} in the newly high-integrated multi-anode PSPMT...|$|R
40|$|It is {{valuable}} {{for the research}} of pathological anatomy to detect the distributions of active hematopoietic organ in the patients with various blood dyscrasias. (99 m) Tc sulfur colloid was applied on 5 normal subjects as a control and 7 patients with hypoplastic anemia using a Type Ⅲ <b>gamma</b> <b>scintillation</b> <b>camera</b> (Nuclear Chicago Ltd.), for studying the distribution of active hematopoietic bone marrow. After 30 min. of intravenous infusion of 5 to 10 mCi of (99 m) Tc sulfur colloid, {{a black and white}} polaroid film (ASA 3000 : 3000 speed/ 107 type) was exposed under the 1000 hole multicollimeter of the Type Ⅲ <b>gamma</b> <b>scintillation</b> <b>camera</b> total counts were adjusted to be 1 - 5 x 10 (4). Blood picture was examined periodically. And, among these date, one considered the results to be most appropriate which were obtained on the closest date when the patient was studied for the distribution of (99 m) Tc sulfur colloid. The (59) Fe-ferrokinetics were performed using a modified method of Pollycove and Hoffe. In normal subjects, the active hematopoietic bone marrows, namely the positive uptake of (99 m) Tc sulfur colloid, was distributed in the skull, sternum, thoracic and lumbar spines, pelvic bone, femur and humerus. The positive uptake was also occasionaly obtained in the joints of both elbow and knee, in contrast to the bones of foot and hand. The intensity of the figures was higher in the proximal part of tubular bone than in the distal part. The distributions of active hematopoietic organs in the patients with hypoplastic anemia were classified as follows depending on the intensity and figure of (99 m) Tc sulfur colloid uptake. Type Ⅰ was a narrow distribution of the diffuse and obscure figure. This Type Ⅰ was subclassified further: In Type Ⅰa, active marrow was scarcely figured out. In Type Ⅰb, active marrow was figured out more widely than in Type Ia although its image was obscure and diffuse. And in Type Ⅰc, the active hematopoietic marrows was restricted only in the vertebrae with clearer uptake of (99 m) Tc sulfur colloid. Type Ⅱ is the narrow islet form with clear and distinctive high density figure and with the obscure and lowd ensity in background. Hypoplastic anemia showing Type Ⅰ figure belonged to the Types Ⅱ and Ⅳ according to the classification made in our Department. This demonstrated a typical hematological findings of hypoplastic anemia with a pancytopenia in the peripheral blood, hypocellularity in the bone marrow, a prolongation of plasma iron disappearance time (PIDT), and decrease in percentage red cell utilization (%RCU) in (59) Fe-ferrokinetics, and low uptake of (59) Fe into the bone marrow. On the other hand, the patient showing Type Ⅱ figure belonged the Type Ⅰ of hypoplastic anemia in our classification. This demonstrated a hypercellularity in the bone marrow, relatively normal %RCU in (59) Fe-ferrokinetics, and prolonged retention of (59) Fe uptake in the bone marrow...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} lesion detection performances of gamma probe and <b>gamma</b> <b>camera.</b> METHODS: Four cylindrical lesions with 0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 4, and 0. 8 cm diameter were placed in a phantom to simulate lymph nodes. The images of phantom placed within water were taken with <b>gamma</b> <b>camera</b> and counts of lesion were taken from mimicking lymph nodes using a gamma probe. RESULTS: It was determined that lymph node with 0. 1 ml volume can be only detected up to 4 cm depth with <b>gamma</b> <b>camera.</b> But, this lesion can be detected up to 7 cm depth when gamma probe is used. CONCLUSION: Gamma probe is more effective compared to <b>gamma</b> <b>camera</b> with respect to their lesion detection capacities. The smallest lymph node that <b>gamma</b> <b>camera</b> could identify clearly had a 0. 1 cm diameter at 4 cm depth whereas gamma probe could identify the same size up to 7 cm depth...|$|R

40|$|As MRI {{threatens the}} use of bone {{scintigraphy}} for skeletal metastases and 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18 FDG-PET) emerges as the main focus in nuclear oncology, the future role of the <b>gamma</b> <b>camera</b> in cancer imaging appears unclear. However, there is a range of pre-existing conventional <b>gamma</b> <b>camera</b> techniques that have incremental benefit over CT and other structural imaging techniques, but are yet to be fully exploited {{in the care of}} cancer patients. This article reviews some of the more advanced conventional nuclear medicine techniques for cancer imaging. Often <b>gamma</b> <b>camera</b> techniques perform close to 18 FDG-PET or provide complementary information.

40|$|Existing {{protocols}} {{for assessing}} the performance characteristics of large field-of-view (LFOV) <b>gamma</b> <b>cameras</b> can be inappropriate and require modification for use with small field-of-view (SFOV) <b>gamma</b> <b>camera</b> systems. This communication proposes a generic scheme suitable for evaluating the performance characteristics of SFOV <b>gamma</b> <b>cameras,</b> based on modifications to the standard procedures of NEMA NU 1 - 2007. Key differences in methodology between tests for LFOV and SFOV <b>gamma</b> <b>cameras</b> are highlighted along with the rationale for these changes.

30|$|To {{achieve the}} largest FOV in the liver, one option {{would be to}} {{increase}} the <b>gamma</b> <b>camera</b> size. However, as the discussed collimators are symmetric, the <b>gamma</b> <b>camera</b> would at some point collide with {{the shoulder of the}} patient. These problems have also been encountered in brain SPECT, where the <b>gamma</b> <b>camera</b> cannot be positioned as close to the skull as preferred, again since the shoulder gets in the way. To solve this problem, a half-cone beam collimator was proposed [25]. Such a tilted collimator could be of use for liver SPECT as well.|$|R
