5|$|The {{plants and}} animals which live on Solsbury Hill reflect the habitat {{provided}} by grassland overlying the limestone rock beneath. Specialist {{plants and animals}}, {{some of which are}} rare species, have adapted to the calcareous grassland. Most of the landscape is largely unaffected by agriculture as shown by the yellow meadow ant. Examples of plant species found include bird's foot trefoil, vetches, greater knapweed, harebells, yarrow (Achillea millefolium), and scabious. It is {{one of a series of}} flower-rich habitats, which Avon Wildlife Trust are trying to link together. The plants attract a range of insects including: the <b>six-spotted</b> <b>burnet</b> moth, hummingbird hawk-moth and a number of butterflies including chalkhill blues. A small population of common buzzard (Buteo buteo) nest in the area. Roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), badger and red fox are also seen. The skylark also nests on the hill.|$|E

50|$|Scabious {{flowers are}} nectar rich and {{attractive}} to many insects including {{butterflies and moths}} such as the <b>six-spot</b> <b>burnet.</b> Scabiosa species are food plants for the larvae of some species of Lepidoptera such as the grey pug moth.|$|R
50|$|Nuptial {{gifts are}} {{widespread}} in insects {{such as the}} <b>six-spot</b> <b>burnet</b> (Zygaena filipendulae), and comprise food items or glandular products offered as paternal investment in offspring and/or to promote mating. Female Zygaena may use this gift for her own defense and to protect her eggs.|$|R
50|$|The {{sand dunes}} and {{shoreline}} plants support large numbers {{and a wide}} variety of insect species. Butterflies and moths present include common blues (Polyommatus icarus), small heaths (Coenonympha pamphilus), small coppers (Lycaena phlaeas), the sub-species caeruleopunctata, graylings (Hipparchia semele) and the <b>six-spot</b> <b>burnet</b> (Zygaena filipendulae).|$|R
5000|$|There {{are good}} populations {{recorded}} of small blue, marbled white and green hairstreak butterflies. Many moths species are recorded including the <b>six-spot</b> <b>burnet.</b> [...] Ant-hills from the {{yellow meadow ant}} {{are present in the}} pasture. Recorded as plentiful on this site is the bloody-nosed beetle. The snail (Helicella itala) is seen, and the rare green spider (Micromatta virescens).|$|R
50|$|A double-flowered {{variety is}} grown as an {{ornamental}} plant. The plant {{is an important}} nectar source for many insects and is also used as a larval food plant by many species of Lepidoptera such as <b>six-spot</b> <b>burnet.</b> It is regularly included {{as a component of}} wildflower mixes in Europe. It can also prevent soil erosion and provide a good habitat for wildlife.|$|R
50|$|Common lizard, slowworm and adder are {{reported}} {{basking in the}} quarry area. The grassland flora supports good populations of small blue, green hairstreak, dingy skipper and marbled white butterflies. Over twenty-nine species have been recorded. Also seen are the day-flying moths such as <b>six-spot</b> <b>burnet</b> and cinnabar. Grasshoppers are common such as stripe-winged and rufous, the latter being at {{the western end of}} its range.|$|R
50|$|This moth is a {{polymorphic}} species having different mimetic forms. There is an ephialtoid form {{similar in}} coloration to the genus Amata of tiger moths (Arctiidae) (see Amata phegea). They {{are characterized by}} white spots on the upper wing surface and the wear a yellow ring segment. In contrast, the peucedanoid form {{is similar to the}} <b>six-spot</b> <b>burnet</b> (Zygaena filipendulae). They have five or six red spots on the upper wing surface and have a red body ring.|$|R
50|$|Maze Park Nature Reserve {{supports}} {{a range of}} plants, insects and birds.The area has a slag-based soil and is ideal for plants that grow in limestone and chalk meadows.Plants in the reserve include bird's foot trefoil, common centaury, rocket, St John's wort and yellow-wortand there was a school project to plant further wild plants such as viper's bugloss, greater knapweed, salad burnet and selfheal.Insects to be found include damselfly, dingy skipper, grasshopper, grayling, ringlet, <b>six-spot</b> <b>burnet</b> moth and small copper.|$|R
5000|$|Centaurea are copious nectar producers, {{especially}} on high-lime soils. The high nectar yield {{of the genus}} makes it very attractive to insects such as butterflies [...] - [...] including the endangered Karner blue (Lycaeides melissa samuelis) which visits introduced spotted knapweed [...] - [...] and day-flying moths [...] - [...] typically Zygaenidae, such as Zygaena loti or the <b>six-spot</b> <b>burnet</b> (Z. filipendulae). The larvae of some other Lepidoptera species use Centaurea species as food plants; see List of Lepidoptera that feed on Centaurea. Several of these are used in biological control of invasive knapweeds and starthistles.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} species of {{butterfly}} {{to be seen in}} the reserve. Most notable is the silver-studded blue, which remains very abundant in the area, having established a colony on the limestone. Other butterfly species include small blue (seen in May/June and July/August), chalkhill blue (seen in July), dark green fritillary and Adonis blue. Grassland species include dingy skipper, small and large skipper, ringlet, meadow brown and marbled white, while there are migrant species such as the painted lady and clouded yellow. Moth species include the day-flying species <b>six-spot</b> <b>burnet,</b> four-spotted moth and cinnabar, as well as the night flying species Portland ribbon wave, beautiful gothic and valerian pug. Some of the {{many species of}} birds seen at the reserve include warblers and other migrants such as the green woodpecker, raven, peregrine falcon and kestrel.|$|R
5000|$|Wingletang Down is 28.9 ha of {{maritime}} heath, {{dune grassland}} and scrub reaching a maximum height of 20 m above sea-level {{and is considered}} by Plantlife to be an Important Plant Area. Due to exposure to salt-laden winds, wind-pruned or [...] "waved" [...] maritime heath has developed on the low nutrient, shallow soils on the higher land, whilst to the south on the deeper sandy soils close to sea-level dune grassland grows. At the southern promontory of Horse Point there is short maritime grass and a tumble of large granite boulders where shallow temporary brackish pools occur. Sea milkwort (Glaux maritima) is a rare plant in Scilly and grows here. Sand sedge (Carex arenaria) and sand couch (Elytrigia juncea) dominate the dune grassland between Wingletang Bay and Porth Askin whilst flowering plants include common storksbill (Erodium cicutarium), Portland spurge (Euphorbia portlandica) and hemlock water dropwort (Oenanthe crocata) which is unusual here as it usually grows in wet habitats. At Beady Pool, {{which is part of}} Wingletang Bay, sea kale (Crambe maritima) grows on the strandline along with yellow horned poppy (Glaucium flavum) and sea spurge (E paralias). There is a colony of <b>Six-spot</b> <b>Burnet</b> (Zygaena filipendulae) here and in the past Ringed Plover (Charadrius hiaticula) nested. The nationally scarce (but common on all the inhabited islands) early meadow grass (Poa infirma) grows in the short maritime grass west of Porth Askin.|$|R
5000|$|Lillering Forest and {{surroundings}} {{has been}} known as a botanically interesting locality for many years with the earliest description dating back to 1877 (Zahrtmann 1877). Some 400 vascular plants have been registered, {{about a third of}} Danish plants. A number of plants primarily exist in south-eastern Denmark, and further south, with the northern boundary being at or around Aarhus and some of these are well represented in Lillering Forest. The most important might be hornbeam which has a significant presence. Others are plants such as dead-nettles, white butterbur, bitter-cress, wall barley, yellow and blue anemone and the endangered multicolored viola. In addition a total of nine species of orchids have been registered although in later years only six has been noted - these are the broad-leaved helleborine, green-flowered helleborine, early-purple orchid, western marsh orchid, early marsh-orchid, eggleaf twayblade and the greater butterfly-orchid. The border zone between Tåstrup Bog and Lillering Forest contains woodland geranium and mountain melick. The area contains several rare species of geometer moths associated with buckthorns that grow at the woodland edge or in Tåstrup Bog. The nearby meadows is home to a rare, small owl that lives on species of mouse-ear chickweed. The meadows in the forest has a number of moths such as the <b>six-spot</b> <b>burnet</b> which are endangered in Denmark. Some 6 species are registered of which 3 in Jutland are found only here and 4 are associated with hackberry at the woodland edge. The stream Bøgebakke Bæk has a large population of the uncommon mayfly siphlonurus aestivalis. == Natura 2000 == The Natura 2000 protected area includes Tåstrup Lake and adjoining wetlands (c. 20 ha.), Tåstrup Bog (c. 25 ha.), Lillering Forest (ca. 50 ha.) and Stjær Forest consisting of the forests Søskov and Stjær Stenskov (c. 20 ha). The four areas are not connected since former agricultural land separates Lillering Forest and Tåstrup Bog to the north and Tåstrup Lake and Stjær Forest to the south.|$|R
