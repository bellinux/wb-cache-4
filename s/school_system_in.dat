5|$|The Manitoba Schools Question {{showed the}} deep {{divergence}} of cultural {{values in the}} territory.

5|$|An example {{may be a}} local <b>school</b> <b>system</b> <b>in</b> the United States. It {{receives}} {{a grant from the}} its local state government to support a new special education initiative, another grant from the federal government for a school lunch program, and an annuity to award teachers working on research projects. At periodic intervals, the school system needs to generate a report to the state about the special education program, a report to a federal agency about the school lunch program, and a report to another authority about the research program. Each of these programs has its own unique reporting requirements, so the school system needs a method to separately identify the related revenues and expenditures. This is done by establishing separate funds, each with its own chart of accounts.|$|E
