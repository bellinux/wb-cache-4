5|$|Flowing from Auerbach's {{emphasis}} on teamwork, what was also <b>striking</b> <b>about</b> his teams {{was that they}} never {{seemed to have a}} dominant scorer: in the 1960–61 NBA season, for instance, the Celtics had six players who scored between 15 and 21 points per game, but none made the Top 10 scoring list. In 1964, he sent out the first-ever NBA starting five consisting of an African-American quintet, namely Russell, Willie Naulls, Tom Sanders, Sam Jones, and K. C. Jones. Auerbach would go a step further in the 1966–67 NBA season, when he stepped down after winning nine titles in 11 years, and made Bill Russell player-coach. Auerbach also popularized smoking a victory cigar whenever he thought a game was already decided, a habit that became cult-like in popularity in the Boston area. Furthermore, having acquired a reputation as a fierce competitor, he often got into verbal altercations with officials, receiving more fines and getting ejected more often than any other coach in NBA history.|$|E
25|$|What is <b>striking</b> <b>about</b> these {{passages}} is {{his intellectual}} rigour, which put him {{far ahead of}} the mercantilist writers of earlier in the century.

The Birmingham Mint won its first contract to strike finished coins for Britain – 500 tons of copper, struck between August 1853 and August 1855, with another contract to follow in 1856. These coins had no mint mark to identify them as from Birmingham. During the peak of operation the four original Boulton screw presses were <b>striking</b> <b>about</b> 110,000 coins per day.|$|E

25|$|Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode an A- grade, saying: What’s most <b>striking</b> <b>about</b> “No Sanctuary,” {{apart from its}} {{attempts}} at thematic resonance, is how quickly and brutally the question of Terminus is resolved. If you’d asked me beforehand, I would’ve guessed {{that it would take}} {{at least a couple of}} episodes before Rick and the others could free themselves. I wouldn’t have been exactly excited about that, because the longer you stay in a community full of murderous cannibals without any major character being killed, the more the tension just drips away, but it seemed like a reasonable assumption to make, especially when taking into consideration how tricky it was going to be to build the rest of the season. Without the prison home base or an obvious major villain (goodbye, the Governor), we need something to create structure—a group of psychos who harvest human flesh seems like too good a concept to dispose of immediately.|$|E
500|$|What is <b>striking</b> <b>about</b> Æthelwold's [...] "rebellion" [...] is {{the level}} and range of support {{he was able to}} draw on: he could call on allies from Wessex, Northumbria, East Anglia and, probably, Mercia and Essex. For a time Æthelwold had a claim to be the most {{powerful}} ruler in England. Edward's apparent reluctance to engage him in battle may have been well founded.|$|E
500|$|In 1907, the Mint had experimented by <b>striking</b> <b>about</b> {{two dozen}} {{pieces of the}} same weight as the double eagle, bearing Saint-Gaudens's design, but which had a smaller, thicker planchet. [...] These [...] "checker" [...] pieces were {{destroyed}} (except two placed in the Mint's coin collection) when {{it was discovered that}} the consent of Congress was needed to change the diameter of any coin. [...] In 2009, the Mint struck a similar piece in [...]999 gold, using Saint-Gaudens's original ultra high relief design for both sides of the coin, though modified to a 50-star obverse. [...] These pieces contain one ounce of gold, slightly more than the original double eagle.|$|E

500|$|David Balls from Digital Spy noted Gaga's {{homage to}} her Italian-American {{roots in the}} video, but {{wondered}} if Gaga would [...] "overexpose herself" [...] with the video. Like his review of the single, Moralde found the video to be complimenting the simplistic composition of the song. He believed that with the videos for previous singles, [...] "Just Dance" [...] and [...] "Poker Face", Gaga's persona was established, but with the video for [...] "Eh, Eh" [...] she traversed her persona from the original Stefani Germanotta that she was born, to the character Lady Gaga. He explained: [...] "What's <b>striking</b> <b>about</b> it is how much it feels like Lady Gaga is playacting: the video has a nostalgic, dreamlike tone. Set in a stylized pastel 1950s Little Italy, the video plays heavily with stereotypical and historical shorthand as it displays moustached chefs, macho men in wife beaters, cute Vespas, and spaghetti and meatballs." [...] He noted that {{with all of these}} activities, Gaga created an essential fashion dollhouse, by playing feminine characters.|$|E
2500|$|The Zee News noted: [...] "What is <b>striking</b> <b>about</b> [...] is {{that after}} {{more than four decades}} in public life, the Opposition had no {{ammunition}} against him after he was declared UPA’s choice for President. In spite of Team Anna making some noise about him being involved in some corruption cases, it has been more or less an easy ride for Pranab to Raisina Hill. Once when Sonia Gandhi announced his name, most of the allies and the Opposition came on board. Whereas, NDA partner JD(U) saw no merit in opposing him, one of the bitter critics of the Congress Shiv Sena too toed the line a little too easily. This support was not for Congress but for [...] ".|$|E
2500|$|A {{historian}} Breen {{wrote that}} Besant and Leadbeater {{were well aware}} how annoying stuff may be their book for a [...] "society that remained deeply conservative." [...] In early January 1901, when this book was published, [...] "Queen Victoria still ruled England. 'Modernism' as a movement or even a concept did not exist. When we consider this world of 1901, – further wrote Breen, – it becomes difficult not to believe that Besant, Leadbeater and their milieu deserve a more prominent place {{in the annals of}} both abstract art and the history of modernism." [...] As the art critic Kramer has pointed, [...] "what is particularly <b>striking</b> <b>about</b> the outlook of the artists primarily responsible for creating abstraction is their espousal of occult doctrine." [...] Yeats, Eliot, Malevich, Kandinsky, and Mondrian were charmed by Theosophy. In {{the first decades of the}} twentieth century, it was a widespread [...] "component of Western cultural life." ...|$|E

2500|$|One {{horizontally}} opposed Lycoming {{engine was}} conventionally {{placed in the}} nose. [...] Behind it was a standard cabin, though the front seats were further ahead of the leading edge than usual because of the rearward shift of the centre of gravity caused by the rear engine. [...] There were three large windows on each side. For the same reason the rear fuselage was quite short, and it lacked the normal taper, giving it a boxy look, so that the second, pusher Lycoming could be mounted in the extreme tail. This was cooled by air from rectangular intakes on the upper sides of the rear fuselage. [...] The straight edged, tapered tailplane was mounted on the fuselage top above the engine, with small endplate fins carrying balanced rudders. [...] These fins extended {{above and below the}} tailplane, with arrow shaped leading edges and straight, swept trailing edges. [...] There was also a long, shallow strake over the rear fuselage. Seen from below, the long span of the tailplane was <b>striking,</b> <b>about</b> 44% of that of the wings; the elevators filled most of the outer part of its trailing edge, avoiding the propeller airstream.|$|E

How else, we ask, could you have it? Yet these are very odd features if we are to regard the Bible as the compactest and most perfect statement of essential truth and wisdom.|$|E
