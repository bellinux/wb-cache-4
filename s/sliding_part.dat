The comparison considered damage mechanisms, wear, and friction between these materials in different configurations (i. e., standard versus standard, sintered versus sintered, and sintered versus standard). The results indicate that, for pairings of the same gear materials, i. e., RS–RS (16 MnCr 5), AQ–AQ (Distaloy AQ+ 0. 2 % C), and Mo–Mo (Astaloy 85 Mo+ 0. 2 % C), RS has a lower friction coefficient. For PM and RS combinations, both PM pins have lower friction coefficients with RS disc material than do RS pins with PM disc materials. For the wear coefficient, at low and high speeds, RS pins always display better wear resistance than do AQ or Mo pins because of their high hardness and compacted microstructure. For RS–PM combinations, Mo pins display higher wear resistance than do AQ pins because their larger and more numerous pores enable good lubrication. Pins in the Mo–RS combination displayed the highest wear resistance, mainly because the pores in Mo discs hold lubricant, lubricating the contact surface and preventing adhesive wear. For the RS pin in the Mo–RS combination and the AQ pin in RS–AQ, the damage mechanism is slight adhesive wear and scuffing. For pins in the PM–PM, RS–PM, AQ–RS, and RS–RS combinations, the damage mechanism is a heavier scuffing-type adhesive wear. QC 20150714 </p...|$|E

40|$|Currently used tire {{models have}} shown a certain lack of {{accuracy}} in some advanced handling applications. This lack of accuracy {{is believed to be}} partly due to thermal effects. In reality, the tire rubber temperature is not constant during the normal operating conditions and it's really well known that the tire friction coefficient strongly depends on the temperature level. The temperature generation, propagation and evolution are the result of a dynamic energy equilibrium between phenomena of different natures. Various mechanisms create a non-uniform temperature distribution {{in various parts of the}} tire structure: heat is generated in zones with large cyclic deformations due to the energy dissipated from the rubber strains and in the <b>sliding</b> <b>part</b> of the contact patch due to friction. The rubber cools down because the heat energy transferred to the air (internally and externally) and to the asphalt in the stick zone of the contact patch. The presented thermodynamic tire model allows for the simulation of all these local thermal phenomena and the thermal energy equilibrium is described by the Fourier diffusion equation solved with a finite volume approach. Furthermore the described thermal model is coupled with the structural MBD tire model CDTire/ 3 D and with an enhanced magic formula (MF) formulation. The coupling strategy naturally incorporates the structural tire model, while in the case of the MF model some empirical adaptations are needed. Both tire models' behavior is influenced by the local calculated temperature, e. g. by modifying the local friction of the tread/asphalt contact. One result the model clearly shows is the variation of the road holding performance as a consequence of the temperature evolution. The capabilities of the overall model are demonstrated and validated in some illustrative scenarios by using measured date from motorsport applications...|$|E

40|$|International audiencePrediction of the {{tribological}} parameters {{controlling the}} tool wear {{is one of}} the most complex research axes in the metal cutting literature. The nature of the friction on the tool-chip interface is the main process which influences the distribution of stresses and temperatures which in turn activates the thermomechanical process governing tool wear. Under extreme conditions of temperature, strain rates and pressure, occurring especially in high speed machining, the adhered contact phenomenon is highly localized especially near to the tool tip and extremely non-linear due to strong influence of the secondary shear zone (SSZ) and the nature of bonds between asperities of tool and chip. In addition, the analysis based on post-mortem examinations of chips and worn tools, especially in hard metal cutting alloy and high speed machining, show that the adhered friction with intimate contact and no relative motion of the material chip on the interface, are the principal cause of appearance of the plastic deformation layers (SSZ). This localized shear zone plays a role of intensive heat sources interacting with the tool side and, in turn, activates diffusive and abrasive wear. In this work, a hybrid model combining analytical and numerical approaches is performed in order to solve the non-linear thermomechanical problem on the chip and predicts the nature of friction contact, i. e. fully sliding, sticking/sliding or fully sticking contact, and these for a given distribution of asperities, characterizing the ratio between the real and apparent contact areas A(r) /A(n) on the interface, and a given global friction coefficient (mu) over bar, characterizing the ratio of the experimental cutting forces. The shear stress generated in the primary shear band, the energy produced in the secondary shear zone, the local friction coefficient and the friction energy produced on the <b>sliding</b> <b>part</b> of contact, the proportion of the sticking/sliding interfaces, and geometrical parameters of the chip, are obtained by analytical means. The analysis of this model is based on experimental data and applied for a large cutting speed (1 ms(- 1) <= V <= 60 ms(- 1)) and able to give some correlation about the distribution of adhesions marks on the contact with respect to the distribution of the tribological parameters at the interface.

40|$|Current {{state-of-the-art}} tire models {{may show}} a certain lack of accuracy in some advanced handling applications. This lack of accuracy is {{partly due to}} thermal effects. In reality, the tire rubber temperature can dramatically increase under certain conditions. The tire friction coefficient strongly depends on the temperature level. As a direct consequence of the temperature variations, the tires handling performance changes, e. g. when the temperature significantly differs from its optimal value, the tires grip level declines. As a result, the vehicles longitudinal and lateral behavior is influenced. This paper shows that in order to increase the reliability of the tire models also in the described extreme conditions, it is necessary to couple a thermo-dynamical model with a mechanical one. The thermal model is important to estimate the temperature propagation inside the tire structure and the temperature evolution over time. It is shown how propagation and evolution {{is the result of a}} dynamic energy equilibrium between phenomena of different natures: heat is generated in areas with large cyclic deformations due to the energy dissipated from the rubber strains and in the <b>sliding</b> <b>part</b> of the contact patch due to sliding friction. The rubber cools down because energy is transferred to the air (internally and externally) and to the asphalt in the stick zone of the contact patch. The described thermal model is designed to be used as a module and is applicable to tire models of various modeling details. In this paper, the coupling with an enhanced Magic Formula and with th e detailed structural MBD tire model CDTire/ 3 D are shown. The coupling strategy is more physical and direct in the case of the structural model, because of the local nature of this model. In fact, the energy input for the thermal model is calculated by using the tire structural model for each point of the tire structure volume. On the other hand, the structural model behavior is influenced by the locally calculated temperature by modifying the local structural properties such as shell dampings, stiffnesss and the local friction coefficient of the tread/asphalt contact. In the case of the Magic Formula, one challenge is to model the temperature creation and also the temperature transfer to the environment and also the temperature influence back to the Magic Formula itself, because of the missing physicality of the model. At the end of the paper, the capabilities of the overall models are demonstrated and qualified in some illustrative tire and vehicle simulation scenario. The validation of the overall model will be shown using measured data from Formula 1...|$|E
