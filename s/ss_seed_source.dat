The twelve-year performance of <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> in three plantations was analyzed, and {{it was found that}} provenance and site were statistically significant for all parameters. Site differences in total height varied from 125. 2 cm to 226. 8 cm. At each trial <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> showed significant differences in survival and height. Native scots pine grew taller and had more survival at all three locations compared to lodgepole pine <b>seed</b> <b>sources.</b> All <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> of lodgepole pine would not be a good choice for plantation in Erzurum and Erzincan.

By a combination of Feulgen and Aceto-carmine staining methods, metaphase chromosomes range (12. 93 ± 1. 33) seedlings from two to three seed collections each of French, Austrian, Yugoslavian, Greek and Turkish <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> were studied. Variables including chromosome number, short arm length (SL), long arm length (LL), total chromosome length (TL), arm ratio (AR), relative chromosome length (RL), centromere index (CI), morphological index (MI), and secondary constriction and satellite occurrences for each cell were measured. The chromosome number was 2 n = 24 for all <b>seed</b> <b>sources.</b> However, aneuploidy 2 n = 18 was observed in one seedling {{of each of the}} Yugoslavian and Greek <b>seed</b> <b>sources.</b> Analyses of variances for the means of chromosonial variables (F-tests were conducted for the variables SL, LL, TL, CI and MI) indicated that there were significant (P <. 05 or P <. 01) differences among the <b>seed</b> <b>sources.</b> Chromosomes XI and XII were especially variable among <b>seed</b> <b>sources,</b> with significant (p <. 01) variation found for SL, LL, TL, AR, CI and MI.

Dendrochronological analysis can illuminate differences among trees from different <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> in terms of absolute annual growth and sensitivity to external growth factors. We analyzed annual radial growth of 567 36 -year-old pitch pine (Pinus rigida Mill.) trees from 27 <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> to evaluate their performance in a New Jersey Pine Barrens provenance experiment. Unexpectedly, missing rings were prevalent in most trees, and some years- 1992, 1999, and 2006 -had a particularly high frequency of missing rings across the plantation. Trees from local <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> (< 55 km away from the plantation) had a significantly smaller percentage of missing rings from 1980 - 2009 (mean: 5. 0 %), relative to northernmost and southernmost sources (mean: 9. 3 % and 7. 9 %, respectively). Some years with a high frequency of missing rings coincide with outbreaks of defoliating insects or dry growing season conditions. The propensity for missing rings synchronized annual variations in growth across all trees and might have complicated the detection of potential differences in interannual variability among <b>seed</b> <b>sources.</b> Average ring width was significantly larger in <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> from both the southernmost and warmest origins compared to the northernmost and coldest <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> in most years.

However, recent evidence indicates that, under some circumstances, planted birch can suffer serious and repeated mortality of the apical leaders and branches, with consequent loss of apical dominance {{and the formation of}} a contorted stem. Plants from 37 <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> of silver birch from Scotland and northern England planted at two sites were compared for several characteristics related to hydraulic architecture, vulnerability to freeze–thaw cycle induced embolism and spring recovery from winter embolism during the period 2000 – 2002. Phenological rhythms were also monitored in late winter–early spring to document relationships between phenology and water relations parameters. Significant differences were found across <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> in stage of bud flushing for four dates in spring. Early flushing <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> differed by about 1 to 2 weeks from late-flushing <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> across the two sites. Wintertime xylem embolism in stems reached a peak of about 50 to 70 % loss of xylem hydraulic conductivity, depending on the size and position of the sample shoots in the canopy. Small apical shoots were significantly more embolized than large basal shoots. Development of winter embolism was coupled to the occurrence of frost events. As percent loss of hydraulic conductivity increased during the winter, wood relative water content declined. Embolism reversal occurred rapidly in spring at the time of development of positive root pressure. No significant differences in the degree of winter embolism in 2001 were found among the three <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> examined. The investigation was expanded in the winter–spring of 2002 to include 10 <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> across both sites. Significant differences were found in degree of winter embolism across sites, dates and <b>seed</b> <b>sources.</b> For each date, there was a significant relationship between flushing scores and wood relative water contents across the two sites and all <b>seed</b> <b>sources,</b> suggesting that differences in time of flushing across sites and <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> were likely caused by differences in the time of occurrence of root pressure, a necessary precondition to flushing...|$|R
40|$|With climate change, {{favorable}} {{growing conditions}} for tree species are shifting northwards and to higher altitudes. Therefore, local populations are becoming less adapted to their environment. Assisted migration {{is one of}} the proposed adaptive measures to reduce the vulnerability of natural populations and maintain forest productivity. It consists of moving genetic material to a territory where future climate conditions correspond to those of its current location. Eight white spruce (Picea glauca [Moench] Voss) <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> representing as many seed orchards were planted in 2013 at three forest sites simulating a south-north climatic gradient of 1. 7 °C in Québec, Canada. The objectives were to (1) evaluate the morpho-physiological responses of the different <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> and (2) determine the role of genetic adaptation and physiological plasticity on the observed variation in morpho-physiological traits. Various seedling characteristics were measured, notably height growth from nursery to the fourth year on plantation. Other traits such as biomass and carbon allocation, nutritional status, and various photosynthetic traits before bud break, were evaluated during the fourth growing season. No interaction between sites and <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> was observed for any traits, suggesting similar plasticity between <b>seed</b> <b>sources.</b> There was no change in the rank of <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> and sites between years for height growth. Moreover, a significant positive correlation was observed between the height from the nursery and that after 4 years in the plantation. Southern <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> showed the best height growth, while optimum growth was observed at the central site. Juvenile height growth seems to be a good indicator of the juvenile carbon sequestration and could serve as a selection criterion for the best genetics sources for carbon sequestration. Vector analysis showed no nitrogen deficiency 4 years after planting. Neither <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> nor planting sites had a significant effect on photosynthesis before bud break. The observed results during the establishment phase under different site conditions indicate that southern <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> may already benefit from assisted migration to cooler climatic conditions further north. While northern <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> are likely to benefit from anticipated local global warming, they would not match the growth performance of seedlings from southern sources...|$|R

On average the <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> were polymorphic at 37 percent of the loci (range 5. 0 - 65. 0), with mean expected heterozygosity equal to. 141 (range. 021 -. 243). Of the total genie diversity (H 1 =. 182) observed in the species. about 75 percent resided within seed sources; 12 percent was due to dfferences among the two recognized varieties. coastal (var. menziesii) and interior (var. plauca,) Douglas-fir; and, 13 percent was distributed among <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> within varieties respectively. Cluster analysis based on Nei's unbiased genetic distances resulted in two groups of <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> corresponding to the two varieties with the interior variety additionally separated into northern and southern subgroups near 440 latitude. A major transition zone between the two varieties was found in central Oregon but not in other regions as revealed in earlier investigations. On averages <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> within the coastal variety and northern interior subgroup had higher levels of expected heterozygosity but genetic differentiation among <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> was small.

To what extent is community structure influenced by land-use history and distance to <b>seed</b> <b>sources?</b> Do these effects change in time? Location: A 350 -ha heathland (NOrholm) in southwest Denmark was abandoned in 1895 and left for free succession. Prior to abandonment the heathland was under traditional management for centuries. Method: Trees and shrubs were recorded and measured in ten surveys spanning 91 yr (1921 - 2012). In the first nine surveys, complete censuses were used, whereas 116 randomly placed plots (10 -m radius) {{were used in the}} most recent survey. We used mixed models and different multivariate techniques (non-metric multidimensional scaling and permutational multivariate ANOVA) to analyse spatio-temporal patterns in stem densities, species richness and species composition and the effects of land-use history and distance to <b>seed</b> <b>sources.</b> Results: Tree and shrub densities increased exponentially over time and were consistently lower at longer distance from <b>seed</b> <b>sources.</b> Land-use history affected the rate of increase in tree densities, with lower encroachment rates at previously cultivated soils. Initially, species richness increased rapidly but leveled off in later successional stages. Richness was marginally higher at areas closer to <b>seed</b> <b>sources,</b> whereas it was not affected by land-use history. The succession showed a shift from early to mid-successional species over time; but distance to <b>seed</b> <b>source</b> determined which species were colonizing at early stages. Conclusion: Distance to <b>seed</b> <b>source</b> and land-use history can differentially affect the structure and spatial patterns of developing forest communities. Although both factors had long-lasting effects on rates of colonization, the spatial patterns of colonization and species composition were mainly determined by distance to <b>seed</b> <b>sources.</b> The importance of distance to <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> became less over time, suggesting that dispersal is a stronger driver at early stages.

40|$|Assisted {{population}} migration (APM) is {{the intentional}} movement of populations within a species range to sites where future environmental conditions {{are projected to}} be more conducive to growth.

The validity of such a strategy {{will depend on the}} adaptation capacity of populations, which can partially be evaluated by the ecophysiological response of different genetic sources along a climatic gradient. This adaptation capacity results from the compromise between (i) the degree of genetic adaptation of <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> to their environment of origin and (ii) the phenotypic plasticity of functional trait which can make it possible for transferred <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> to positively respond to new growing conditions. We examined phenotypic variation in morphophysiological traits of six <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> of white spruce (Picea glauca [Moench] Voss) along a regional climatic gradient in Québec, Canada. Seedlings from the <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> were planted at three forest sites representing a mean annual temperature gradient of 2. 2 °C. During the second growing season, we measured, height growth (H 2014) and traits related to resources use efficiency and photosynthetic rate (Amax). All functional traits showed an adaptive response to the climatic gradient. Traits such as H 2014, Amax, stomatal conductance (gs), the ratio of mesophyll to stomatal conductance, water use efficiency and photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency showed significant variation related to both physiological plasticity related to test site, and <b>seed</b> <b>source</b> variation related to local genetic adaptation. However, the amplitude of <b>seed</b> <b>source</b> variation was much less than that related to plantation sites in the area investigated. The six <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> presented a similar level of physiological plasticity. H 2014, Amax and gs, but not carboxylation capacity (Vcmax), were correlated and decreased with a reduction of the average temperature of the growing season at seed origin. The clinal variation in H 2014 and Amax appeared to be driven by CO 2 conductance.

40|$|In this study, {{the problem}} of {{deploying}} seed from multiple tree improvement orchards to multiple sites {{in an environment of}} uncertain climate change is addressed. A modeling approach is designed and applied with the objective providing a robust solution, i. e., transferred <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> perform well across multiple climatic scenarios. The approach involves two steps. First, the focal point seed zone method is employed to predict seed deployment zones under multiple future climate scenarios. Next, a portfolio model is applied to minimize the risk of maladaptation of the transferred seed under multiple climatic scenarios. The method was applied using black spruce (Picea mariana) field data from 7 sites using 24 <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> from the Great Lakes area. The focal point seed zone method generated deployment zones for 24 <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> over three 30 -years periods under 12 predicted future climate scenarios. Next, the optimization procedure searched for eligible sites that can receive improved <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> from 7 provenances considering 12 different climatic scenarios. The portfolio model also produced the optimal composition of candidate <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> at each eligible site. Sensitivity of the solutions to different emission scenarios is compared. Finally, geographic representations of results were illustrated in Geographic Information System. It was concluded that this modeling framework provides a useful approach for decision-makers to address {{the problem of}} deploying seed at regional scale, such that the risk of climatic maladaptation is minimized...|$|R
40|$|Summary We {{evaluated}} winter (January through March) carbon {{assimilation of}} red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) from three Vermont <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> grown {{in a common}} garden in northwestern Vermont. Although CO 2 exchange rates were generally low, net photosynthetic rates increased during two prolonged thaws. Significant correlations between CO 2 ex-change rates and multiday air temperature means supported our observations of enhanced gas exchange during extended peri-ods of elevated temperature. Increases in photosynthesis during thaws occurred before observed increases in leaf conductance, indicating that initial changes in photosynthesis were probably not associated with changes in stomatal aperture. Results of correlations between photosynthetic rates and PAR suggested that solar irradiance {{did not have a}} strong effect on winter carbon capture. Rates of net photosynthesis differed among <b>seed</b> <b>sources.</b> Trees from the Mt. Mansfield source had the highest average rates of photosynthesis and, at times, rates for individual trees from this source approximated those occurring during the growing season. Because <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> differed in photosyn-thetic rates but not in leaf conductance, we conclude that differences in winter photosynthesis among <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> were primarily attributable to factors other than changes in stomatal aperture...|$|R

40|$|Four <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> of Jeffrey pine (Pinus jefleyi) were {{selected}} for testing through controlled inoculation for resistance to dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobiurn campylopodum). The pines were 7 years old {{and part of a}} progeny test planting established by the USDA Forest Service's Institute of Forest Genetics, Placewille, California. One of the <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> {Foresthill) was considered from previous studies to be highly resistant. It was also found to be resistant in this study. Test trees were inoculatedin 1980 and 1981 with about 13, 500 seeds of dwarf mistletoe. A high proportion of the seeds were lost before germination, but branches covered with bird-proof and insect-proof mesh lost significantly fewer seeds. Mean percentage infection based on remaining seeds was significantly lower on trees from the Foresthill <b>seed</b> <b>source</b> {{than any of the other}} sources. Similarly, mean percentage of trees infected was significantly lower for the Foresthill source than for the three others. Development of the endophytic system, as indicated by length of branch sweIling, and mistletoe shoot development were not significantly different among the <b>seed</b> <b>sources.</b> However, significantly fewer brooms developed on the Foresthill trees than on trees from two of the other sources.

30|$|In {{the late}} 1970 ’s <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> were limited, as were plant varieties. Markets for seed that could {{tolerate}} colder northern climates had not generally been developed prior to SMCRA. Often, <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> were from more southern climates which, when {{planted in the}} north, caused many of the germinating seedlings to winter-kill or die. The push for adapted seed began in the mid- 1980 ’s. Hand collection of the less commercially available forb seed began about that time frame; however, such seed was costly and supplies limited but, in many ways, still is.|$|R

30|$|The {{location}} of restoration sites {{in relation to}} the <b>seed</b> <b>source</b> critically affects restoration success (Holl 1998, 1999, 2008). Our study corroborates the need to maintain patches of forests as islands and stepping stones for biodiversity conservation and restoration. Church forests in northern Ethiopia are remnants of the original tree population (Aerts et al. 2016). Currently, these forests are facing strong anthropogenic pressure and dispersal of propagules from these remnants is crucial to form viable populations at the patch level. As well, restoration of those areas, devoid of their natural vegetation in the landscape, need seed input from the remnant forests. Seed dispersal is a filter for succession and affects the quality of regeneration in the context of passive restoration. This raises the importance of other landscape elements and biological legacies, such as trees on hedges and homesteads to support restoration as <b>seed</b> <b>sources.</b> In the absence of these supplementary <b>seed</b> <b>sources,</b> deliberate introduction of these two species may be needed in highly degraded areas.|$|R
