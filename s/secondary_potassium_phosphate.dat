40|$|We {{present a}} {{mathematical}} model to describe the ultrafiltration behaviour of polymer-electrolyte mixtures. The model combines the proper thermodynamic forces (pressure, chemical potential and electrical potential differences) with multicomponent diffusion theory. The model is verified with experimental data on the ultrafiltration of aqueous solutions of PEG- 4000 and <b>potassium</b> <b>phosphate.</b> The single solute rejection of PEG- 4000 goes through a maximum as also found by others. The single solute rejection of <b>potassium</b> <b>phosphate</b> depends on the ionic strength of the solution. At low ionic strength rejections are found of 50 %. Solutions containing {{a high concentration of}} PEG- 4000 and <b>potassium</b> <b>phosphate</b> show a negative rejection for <b>potassium</b> <b>phosphate.</b> This is caused by the strongly non-ideal behaviour of these aqueous solutions.

As {{a result of}} high prices, the commonly used <b>potassium</b> dihydrogen <b>phosphate</b> is usually restricted to highly chlorine-sensitive plants, i. e. flowers and vegetables grown in greenhouses. In the dissertation was performed studies about <b>potassium</b> dihydrogen <b>phosphate</b> production by using cheaper raw material and simpler production method.

Addition of a chemoattractant, D-xylose, to cells in either <b>potassium</b> or sodium <b>phosphate</b> buffer resulted in a transient membrane depolarization. In the presence of valinomycin, the membrane potential of cells in <b>potassium</b> <b>phosphate</b> buffer was reduced, and the transient membrane depolarization that resulted from the addition of D-xylose was eliminated. Although there was no detectable effect of valinomycin on motility, D-xylose taxis of cells in <b>potassium</b> <b>phosphate</b> buffer was completely inhibited by valinomycin. In sodium phosphate buffer, valinomycin had little effect on membrane potential or D-xylose taxis. Nigericin is known to dissipate the transmembrane pH gradient of S. aurantia in <b>potassium</b> <b>phosphate</b> buffer.
