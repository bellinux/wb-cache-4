Dan Savage, the original creator of the [...] "It Gets Better" [...] campaign, which Kesha participated in, stated that she and other music artists that wrote songs addressed to the gay community were vital in helping fans {{come to terms with}} their sexualities and identities. [...] "These songs are countering a hateful message that a peer, family member, politician or a bully might be saying, I get frustrated with gay politicos who discount or undermine the importance of pop stars, They’re a huge part of this fight." [...] Singers Josh Erdman and Ben Klute began posting cover versions of various songs on YouTube, later adding a logo to their videos originally titled [...] "Legalize Gay". They later stumbled upon Kesha's song and upon doing so they changed their logo to [...] "Legalize Gay ’Cause We Are Who We Are". The duo changed the logo to represent the song stating, [...] "The lyrics obviously <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> What these artists are doing means the world to the gay community." [...] In October 2011, Kesha teamed up with the Human Rights Campaign and designed a unisex T-shirt embroidered with purple zebra print – intended to represent [...] "spirit" [...] in the LGBT's pride flag. The shirt's design was titled with the writing [...] "We R Who We R" [...] and was made for that year's National Coming Out Day.|$|E

Moreover, he <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> about his vision of the Promised Land, a land of justice and equality, brotherhood and peace. Martin dedicated his life to the goals of peace and unity among all peoples, and perhaps nowhere in the world is there a greater appreciation of the desirability and necessity of peace than in Israel." ...|$|E

The Reverend William P. Barker presided over a public memorial in Pittsburgh. More than 2,700 people attended the memorial at Heinz Hall, including former Good Morning America host David Hartman, Teresa Heinz Kerry, philanthropist Elsie Hillman, PBS President Pat Mitchell, Arthur creator Marc Brown, and The Very Hungry Caterpillar author-illustrator Eric Carle.

He <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> as the people we were, not as the people others wished we were." [...] Rogers is interred at Unity Cemetery in Latrobe.|$|E

Our knees gave way beneath us, and down, our arms about each other's necks, Leo and I sank till we lay upon the ground. Then a voice sweeter than honey, softer than the whisper of a {{twilight}} breeze among the reeds, <b>spoke</b> near <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> and these were the words it said--"Come hither to me, Kallikrates, who would pay thee back that redeeming kiss of faith and love thou gavest me but now!" ...|$|R
60|$|I led {{my young}} lady out: {{she was too}} glad of her escape to resist; the other followed, and Mr. Heathcliff had the room to himself till dinner. I had counselled Catherine to dine up-stairs; but, {{as soon as he}} {{perceived}} her vacant seat, he sent me to call her. He <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> none of <b>us,</b> ate very little, and went out directly afterwards, intimating that he should not return before evening.|$|R

5000|$|The {{teaching}} of the Roman Catholic Church distinguishes between [...] "public Revelation" [...] and [...] "private revelations". The term [...] "public Revelation" [...] finds its literary expression in the Bible and [...] "reached its fulfilment in the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ". In this regard, The Catechism of the Catholic Church quotes John of the Cross:In giving us his Son, his only Word (for he possesses no other), he <b>spoke</b> everything <b>to</b> <b>us</b> at once in this sole Word—and he has no more to say... Any person questioning God or desiring some vision or revelation would be guilty not only of foolish behavior but also of offending him, by not fixing his eyes entirely upon Christ and by living with the desire for some other novelty.|$|R
2500|$|At {{the end of}} March 1924, aged 17, Gavin <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> a <b>U.S.</b> Army {{recruiting}} officer. Since he {{was under}} 18, he needed parental consent to enlist.

The recruiting officer took him {{and a couple of}} other underage boys, who were orphans, to a lawyer who declared himself their guardian and signed the parental consent paperwork. On April 1, 1924, Gavin was sworn into the U.S. Army, and was stationed in Panama. His basic training was performed on the job in his unit, the U.S. Coast Artillery at Fort Sherman. He served as a crewmember of a 155mm gun, under the command of Sergeant McCarthy, who described him as fine.

Upon returning to Pakistan, he strongly defended his trip to the United States in a broadcast from Radio Pakistan on 30 June: This visit not only enabled {{me to see the}} American people and their wonderful country but also gave me an occasion to inform the inhabitants of that country about the birth of Pakistan, its short but eventful history and the Islamic way of life adopted as an ideal by the people of my country Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan, 1950 ...|$|R

6000|$|... "To us," [...] {{she said}} slowly, [...] "to Madame de Melbain and to me, {{he was a}} ghost, an actual apparition. He <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> with the voice of one whom we know to be dead. He came to us, in his form." ...|$|E
6000|$|We did so, marking its {{position}} {{by means of}} chalk. It was nearly three feet from the utmost extension of the psychic's hands, and yet, almost immediately, tapping came upon the cone keeping time to our singing.

A hammering was then carried on as if within the cone, and [...] "Maudie" [...] <b>spoke,</b> telling <b>us</b> <b>to</b> go down and get supper, as before.|$|R
6000|$|We {{moved the}} table a short {{distance}} to the left, and I put the cone in {{the centre of the}} rug where the table had stood, and marked the position of the cone. The psychic then passed through a period of suffering, of effort, but nothing took place. Again [...] "Maudie" [...] <b>spoke,</b> asking <b>us</b> <b>to</b> restore the table and cone to their former positions. [...] "Evidently the experiment designed by 'Mitchell' has failed," [...] I said, [...] "but these failures instruct us." ...|$|R

Dodd {{submitted}} his report to the AEF on 20 June 1917 with a recommendation on {{what needed to be}} done.

The term also appeared on 5 July [...] 1917, in AEF General Order No. 8, in tables detailing staff organization and duties.

Mitchell replaced Dodd on 30 June 1917, with the position renamed [...] "Chief of Air Service" [...] and its duties changed and rewritten.|$|R
60|$|We {{all went}} up to Lucy's room. Arthur by {{direction}} remained outside. Lucy turned her head and looked at us, but said nothing. She was not asleep, but she was simply too weak to make the effort. Her eyes <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> that was all.|$|E

5000|$|The {{document}} was mentioned {{and published in}} January 1988 in the Belgrade newspaper Borba, and later in Zagreb-based magazine Start. Čubrilović's {{document was}} not supported by Yugoslav historians and professors except for Ivo Andrić. The text was later often quoted and cited {{as one of the}} fundamental documents of the Greater Serbia ideology in the 20th century; that is the basis for methods that were used during the breakup of Yugoslavia by the Serbian authorities for the purpose of ethnic cleansing of Albanians, Muslims, and Croats. Some authors believe that Čubrilović's plan to expel Albanians from Kosovo actualized in 1999 by Slobodan Milošević's government under the name [...] "Operation Horseshoe". The report is deemed chauvinistic and nationalistic and was used as a reference to the Serbian atrocities in Kosovo in 1999 by Joe DioGuardi as he <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> the <b>US</b> parliament demanding that the United States should be launching NATO-attacks against Yugoslavia. During the brutal campaign of ethnic cleansing, over 850,000 Albanians left Kosovo, but soon returned after the withdrawal of Serbian troops.|$|R

If they stay on the track they're on, their elections in 2010 will be totally illegitimate and without any meaning in the international community."

We initially had a couple of quasi-concept ideas but soon began to realise this was a bit too constrictive so we pretty much chose a song or two each. ... Each of us chose the song(s) that <b>spoke</b> most personally <b>to</b> <b>us.</b> We then tried to reflect that music with our words and vice versa.
