5|$|Cicada nymphs drink sap {{from the}} xylem of various species of trees, {{including}} oak, cypress, willow, ash, and maple. While {{it is common}} folklore that adults do not eat, they actually do drink plant sap utilizing their <b>sucking</b> mouthparts.|$|E
5|$|Flies have {{a mobile}} head, {{with a pair}} of large {{compound}} eyes, and mouthparts designed for piercing and <b>sucking</b> (mosquitoes, black flies and robber flies), or for lapping and <b>sucking</b> in the other groups. Their wing arrangement gives them great maneuverability in flight, and claws and pads on their feet enable them to cling to smooth surfaces. Flies undergo complete metamorphosis; the eggs are laid on the larval food-source and the larvae, which lack true limbs, develop in a protected environment, often inside their source of their food. The pupa is a tough capsule from which the adult emerges when ready to do so; flies mostly have short lives as adults.|$|E

40|$|Background: Many preterm {{neonates}} display difficulties establishing <b>suck</b> feeding {{competence in}} the weeks following birth. However, to date, few studies have systematically investigated the effect of patient variables on this important aspect of development. Aims: The current study aimed to determine risk factors for (a) delayed commencement of <b>suck</b> feeds, (b) delayed attainment of exclusive <b>suck</b> feeding, and (c) prolonged transition time from commencement of <b>suck</b> feeds to attainment of exclusive <b>suck</b> feeding. Methods: A chart review was conducted for all neonates bor...|$|R
5|$|Most {{traditional}} {{or historical}} first-aid treatments for redback spider bites are either useless or dangerous. These include making incisions and promoting bleeding, using ligatures, applying alkaline solutions, providing warmth, and <b>sucking</b> the venom out. In modern first aid, incising, <b>sucking,</b> applying bandages and tourniqueting are strongly discouraged. In 1893, the Camperdown Chronicle {{reported that a}} doctor noticed that a severely ill benumbed victim got much better overnight following treatment using injections of strychnine and cocaine; strychnine had been popular as a snake bite antidote, {{but it was not}} effective. As of 2011, administration of magnesium sulphate was reported to have had some benefit though evidence of effectiveness is weak.|$|E

5|$|Though {{she rarely}} talks, she {{frequently}} makes a characteristic <b>sucking</b> noise with her pacifier, {{which has become}} synonymous with the character. Her pacifier <b>sucking</b> noises are provided by the show's creator, Matt Groening and early producer Gabor Csupo. Maggie's occasional speaking parts and other vocalisations are currently provided by Nancy Cartwright, but she has also been voiced by guest stars James Earl Jones, Elizabeth Taylor and Jodie Foster, and by series regulars Yeardley Smith and Harry Shearer. Maggie has appeared in various media relating to The Simpsons– including video games, The Simpsons Movie, The Simpsons Ride, commercials and comic books– and has inspired an entire line of merchandise.|$|E

During the summer months it is seen infrequently as a large insect, <b>sucking</b> the blood of horses.|$|E

50|$|We don't like {{to destroy}} cards, {{even if they}} <b>suck,</b> {{so we have a}} notecard box called The <b>Suck</b> Box. If a player feels a card is boring and useless to gameplay, they will {{nominate}} it for admission to The <b>Suck</b> Box. All players present then vote (sometimes lobbying for their cases), and the card either goes into The <b>Suck</b> Box or gets to remain in the primary deck. Ironically, when The <b>Suck</b> Box was introduced, one player created a card {{for the express purpose of}} adding it to The <b>Suck</b> Box. However, the rest of us felt that it was too amusing a card and had to remain in the deck.|$|R

5|$|A {{variety of}} {{parasitic}} arthropods {{have been recorded}} on northern voalavo: mites from the families Laelapidae and Trombiculidae (both Marojejy and Anjanaharibe-Sud), the demodicid mite Demodex (Marojejy only), the atopomelid mite Listrophoroides (both Marojejy and Anjanaharibe-Sud), and unidentified <b>sucking</b> lice (Anjanaharibe-Sud only). In 2007, a laelapid mite found on V.gymnocaudus in Anjanaharibe-Sud {{was described as a}} new species, Andreacarus voalavo. The apicomplexan parasite Eimeria has also been recorded in Anjanaharibe-Sud.|$|E

5|$|Flies have {{a mobile}} {{head with a}} pair of large {{compound}} eyes {{on the sides of the}} head, and in most species, three small ocelli on the top. The compound eyes may be close together or widely separated, and in some instances are divided into a dorsal region and a ventral region, perhaps to assist in swarming behaviour. The antennae are well-developed but variable, being thread-like, feathery or comb-like in the different families. The mouthparts are adapted for piercing and <b>sucking,</b> as in the black flies, mosquitoes and robber flies, and for lapping and <b>sucking</b> as in many other groups. Female horse-flies use knife-like mandibles and maxillae to make a cross-shaped incision in the host's skin and then lap up the blood that flows. The gut includes large diverticulae, allowing the insect to store small quantities of liquid after a meal.|$|E

5|$|In {{marine and}} {{freshwater}} environments, gastrotrichs {{form part of}} the benthic community. They are detritivores and are microphagous, <b>sucking</b> dead or living organic material, diatoms, bacteria and small protozoa into their mouths by the muscular action of the pharynx. They are themselves eaten by turbellarians and other small macrofauna.|$|E
5|$|Insects are a {{major factor}} in the low yields of African cowpea crops, and they affect each tissue {{component}} and developmental stage of the plant. In bad infestations insect pressure is responsible for over 90% loss in yield. The legume pod borer, Maruca vitrata, is the main pre-harvest pest of the cowpea. Other important pests include pod <b>sucking</b> bugs, thrips and the post-harvest cowpea weevil, Callosobruchus maculatus.|$|E
5|$|Order Bdellonemertea. Includes seven species, {{of which}} six live as commensals in {{the mantle of}} large clams and one in that of a {{freshwater}} snail. The hosts filter feed and all the hosts steal food from them. These nemerteans have short, wide bodies and have no stylets but have a <b>sucking</b> pharynx and a posterior stucker, with which they move like inchworms.|$|E

5|$|This swift is host {{to feather}} mites {{including}} Eustathia cultrifera, Chauliacia canarisi and C. securigera. Biting parasites include the louse fly Crataerina pacifica, bat bugs and <b>sucking</b> mites. Chewing lice include two species first identified on this swift. Davaineidae tapeworms {{have been found}} as internal parasites.|$|E
5|$|While mandibles or 'jaws' (chewing mouthparts) {{are only}} {{present in the}} {{caterpillar}} stage, the mouthparts of most adult Lepidoptera mainly consist of the <b>sucking</b> kind; this part {{is known as the}} proboscis or 'haustellum'. A few Lepidoptera species have reduced mouthparts and therefore do not feed in the adult state. Others, such as the basal family Micropterigidae, have mouthparts of the chewing kind.|$|E
5|$|Both species {{live on the}} ground, {{are active}} during the night, are solitary, and feed mainly on fruits and seeds, but may also eat herbs and insects. They build nests of leaves and {{branches}} among vegetation, for example in a tree hollow, or under rocks. In Panama, T.talamancae breeds throughout the year and the average litter size is about six. Various species of mites, chiggers, fleas, and <b>sucking</b> lice have been recorded as parasites on both species.|$|E
