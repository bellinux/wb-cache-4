5|$|In {{between the}} time Scott {{released}} Alien in 1979 {{and returned to the}} franchise with Prometheus in 2012, he directed another notable science fiction film concerning artificial intelligence, Blade Runner, in 1982. Contrary to the white-blooded androids of Alien that emulate emotions and recognize a disconnect with humanity, Blade Runner features the replicants- enhanced biorobotic humanoids that may only be identified by their lacking emotions. In order to maintain control, the replicants' human creators install false memories that detail entire lives that give them a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>identity.</b> Blade Runner, a largely influential film, has prompted a slew of philosophical questions concerning artificial intelligence and whether or not an android could truly be considered alive. The film specifically questions whether thoughts, a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>identity,</b> emotions and consciousness in general, may be something genuine when applied to artificial intelligence. Due to David identifying himself as a living entity - similar to the replicants - film critics in 2012 would come not to only question if Prometheus was a direct prequel to Alien, but if the film had a relation to Blade Runner.|$|E
5|$|Kraków {{is divided}} into 18 {{administrative}} districts (dzielnica) or boroughs, each {{with a degree of}} autonomy within its own municipal government. Prior to March 1991, the city had been divided into four quarters which still give a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>identity</b> to Kraków – the towns of Podgórze, Nowa Huta, and Krowodrza which were amalgamated into the city of Kraków as it expanded, and the ancient town centre of Kraków itself.|$|E

Clarkwood and Annaville have less prominent <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>identity,</b> but the distinction remains. These areas are sometimes mistakenly believed to be separate municipalities.|$|R

25|$|Despite shared {{linguistic}} heritage, few institutions {{among the}} Toubou generate a broader <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>identity</b> than the clan. Regional divisions do exist, however. During {{the colonial period}} (and since independence in 1960), Chadian administrations have conferred legality and legitimacy on these regional groupings by dividing the Toubou and Daza regions into corresponding territorial units called cantons and appointing chiefs to administer them.|$|E
25|$|According to Rajneesh {{every human}} being is a Buddha with the {{capacity}} for enlightenment, capable of unconditional love and of responding rather than reacting to life, although the ego usually prevents this, identifying with social conditioning and creating false needs and conflicts and an illusory <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>identity</b> that {{is nothing but a}} barrier of dreams. Otherwise man's innate being can flower in a move from the periphery to the centre.|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} <b>of</b> {{a professional}} <b>identity</b> {{is as important}} as acquiring knowledge and skills in medical education. A study about teachers’ professional identity found self-efficacy as one of the indicators for the teachers’ <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> professional <b>identity</b> (Canrinus, Helms-Lorenz, Beijaard, Buitink & Hofman, 2011). This study examined the relation between self-efficacy and the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> professional <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> medical students. A questionnaire measuring self-efficacy and professional identity was set out under all students enrolled in the Master programme of medical education of the University of Utrecht. A factoranalysis was conducted to examine the structure of the questionnaire. Also, regression and MANOVA analyses were conducted. Seven semi-structured interviews were conducted to examine aspects of self-efficacy important to the development <b>of</b> professional <b>identity.</b> This study found that there is a relation between self-efficacy and professional identity. Patientcare self-efficacy has the most influence on this relation. The level of clinical experience has an influence on patientcare self-efficacy and evidence based self-efficacy, but the level of clinical experience shows no direct correlation with the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> professional <b>identity.</b> It appears that students have a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> professional <b>identity,</b> even when they did not gain a lot of clinical experience yet...|$|R
50|$|One of {{the main}} {{challenges}} facing Turkey {{in the field of}} ECRI's (European Commission against Racism and Intolerance) concerns would appear to be the need to reconcile the strong <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> national <b>identity</b> and the wish to preserve the unity and integrity of the State with the right of different minority groups within Turkey to express their own <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> ethnic <b>identity,</b> for example through the maintenance and development of linguistic and cultural aspects <b>of</b> that <b>identity.</b>|$|R

25|$|Evidence {{about the}} {{development}} of adoptees can be supported in newer studies. It can be said that adoptees, in some respect, tend to develop differently from the general population. This can be seen in many aspects of life, but usually can be found as a greater risk around the time of adolescence. For example, it has been found that many adoptees experience difficulty in establishing a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>identity.</b>|$|E
25|$|Alaric {{then moved}} south, {{intending}} to sail to Africa, but his ships were wrecked {{in a storm}} and he shortly died of fever. His successor Ataulf, still regarded as an usurper and given only occasional and short-term grants of supplies, moved north into the turmoil of Gaul, where there was some prospect of food. His supergroup of barbarians are called the Visigoths in modern works: they may now have been developing their own <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>identity.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 2005 {{military}} brat and filmmaker Donna Musil {{released the}} first documentary ever made exclusively about military brats, Brats: Our Journey Home. To date, the documentary has won six film awards. Musil furthers {{the premise that}} military brats form a distinct American subculture with a commonly held <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>identity</b> that is actually a distinct American ethnicity. The documentary also draws on many studies interviews of researchers, counselors and psychologists, along with interviews of numerous former military brats.|$|E

25|$|Evidence of Sabaean {{influence}} {{is found in}} northern Ethiopia, where the South Arabian alphabet, religion and pantheon, and the South Arabian style of art and architecture were introduced. The Sabaean created a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>identity</b> through their religion. They worshipped El-Maqah and {{believed that they were}} his children. For centuries, the Sabaeans controlled outbound trade across the Bab-el-Mandeb, a strait separating the Arabian Peninsula from the Horn of Africa and the Red Sea from the Indian Ocean.|$|E
25|$|Central to the Irish {{community}} in Britain was the community's {{relationship with the}} Roman Catholic Church, with which it maintained a strong <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>identity.</b> The Church remains a crucial focus of communal life {{among some of the}} immigrant population and their descendants. The largest ethnic group among the Roman Catholic priesthood of Britain remains Irish (in the United States, the upper ranks of the Church's hierarchy are of predominantly Irish descent.) The former head of the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland is Cardinal Keith O'Brien.|$|E
25|$|As {{children}} {{transition from}} early childhood to middle childhood, their motivation to participate changes. In both the Indigenous communities of Quechua people and Rioja in Peru, children often experience a transition {{in which they}} become more included into their family's and community's endeavors. This changes their position and role in their families to more responsible ones and leads {{to an increase in}} their eagerness to participate and belong. As children go through this transition, they often develop a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>identity</b> within their family and community.|$|E

However, one of the main challenges facing Turkey in the field of ECRI's (European Commission against Racism and Intolerance) concerns would appear to be the need to reconcile the strong <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> national <b>identity</b> and the wish to preserve the unity and integrity of the State with the right of different minority groups within Turkey to express their own <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> ethnic <b>identity,</b> for example through the maintenance and development of linguistic and cultural aspects <b>of</b> that <b>identity.</b>|$|R
25|$|The 1896 {{lighthouse}} {{also has}} strong social significance for Sunshine Coast residents. As the only {{town on the}} Sunshine Coast to possess a lighthouse, it {{was a source of}} pride for the community and helped to distinguish Caloundra from other coastal settlements. Both the symbolic and functional nature of the 1896 lighthouse contributed to Caloundra's <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>identity</b> as a popular seaside resort with a role in navigating the North West Channel into Brisbane. The symbolic nature of the lighthouse is evidenced by its depiction on tourist brochures, logos and crests throughout the twentieth century.|$|E
25|$|In 1952, Gamal Abdel Nasser {{led some}} army {{officers}} in a coup d'état against King Farouk, which overthrew the Kingdom of Egypt {{and established a}} republic. Nasser's mainstream policy was pan-Arab nationalism and socialism. The Copts were severely affected by Nasser's nationalization policies, though they represented about 10 to 20 percent of the population. In addition, Nasser's pan-Arab policies undermined the Copts' strong attachment to and <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>identity</b> about their Egyptian pre-Arab, and certainly non-Arab identity which resulted in permits to construct churches to be delayed along with Christian religious courts to be closed.|$|E
25|$|Each {{ethnic group}} {{has its own}} {{underlying}} culture that separates it from the others, and they have achieved different levels of integration. The Chinese have integrated with Malay culture {{in a number of}} areas, including parts of Terengganu, and they form Malayanised groups such as the Baba Chinese in Malacca and the Sino-Kadazan of Sabah. Their years under combined British rule brought some joint <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>identity</b> to all the ethnic groups, with English ideas and ideals providing some unifying features. A joint Malaysian culture {{can be seen in the}} symbiosis of the cultures of the people within it.|$|E
