5|$|Decimetric radio {{emission}} (with wavelengths measured in centimeters) was first observed by Frank Drake and Hein Hvatum in 1959.

Periodic and Repetitive <b>Signals</b> Periodic <b>signals</b> <b>are</b> those that repeat themselves on a regular basis. These include sine, square and sawtooth waves.

5|$|Due to the storm's {{threat to}} Hong Kong, a no 10. {{hurricane}} <b>signal</b> <b>was</b> issued.

5|$|In Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Observatory issued standby signal No. 1 as Soudelor {{neared the}} region on July11. The {{following}} day, the <b>signal</b> <b>was</b> raised to strong wind No. 3 {{due to the}} possibility of landfall near the region. The <b>signal</b> <b>was</b> lowered back to No. 1 later that day before they were all canceled early on July12. The emergency response system was put at level four water-disaster in preparation for torrential rainfall from Soudelor. A red alert was also declared for the affected regions. Torrential rains in Hainan caused significant flooding that killed 15 hikers and left several others missing. Numerous roads were also cut off or destroyed by landslides and 30 villages were inundated with flood waters. In Hong Kong, outer bands of Soudelor produced squally rain showers on July11. About 20 trees reportedly fell within Hong Kong, one of which struck a mini bus terminal. The direct economic loss to china was estimated at about RMB 1.71billion, ($5.4 million 2009 USD).|$|E

5|$|The ASAT test mission, {{the final}} {{flight of the}} High Virgo missile, was {{conducted}} on September 22, 1959.

No data was recovered from the test, and the camera data, intended to be recovered afterward, was not located. Hence the test was inconclusive.|$|E
5|$|The lantern {{initially}} {{contained a}} fourth order Fresnel lens giving a red light; a short mast {{on the roof}} of the lantern bore a radio beacon antenna. The fog <b>signal</b> <b>was</b> a horn powered by compressed air. The light was activated in 1935.|$|E
5|$|The rapid {{introduction}} of new types of radars working on different frequencies meant the IFF system had to respond to an ever-increasing list of signals, and the direct response of the Mk. II required an ever-increasing number of sub-models, each turned to different frequencies. By 1941 {{it was clear that}} this was going to grow without bound, and a new solution was needed. The result was a new series of IFF units which used the indirect interrogation technique. These operated on a fixed frequency, different from the radar. The interrogation <b>signal</b> <b>was</b> sent from the aircraft by pressing a button on the radar, which caused the signal to be sent out in pulses synchronized to the radar's main signal. The received <b>signal</b> <b>was</b> amplified and mixed into the same video signal as the radar, causing the same extended blip to appear.|$|E

The return phase modulated <b>signal</b> <b>is</b> {{mixed with a}} leakage signal component of the microwave signal, leaving an IF Doppler.

5|$|The {{resulting}} <b>signal</b> <b>was</b> a fast dip, {{corresponding to}} the compression of the cadmium sphere, followed by slower increase, {{corresponding to the}} decompression and following dispersal of the sphere and the lanthanum.

5|$|WWV's 20MHz <b>signal</b> <b>was</b> {{used for}} a unique purpose in 1958: to track the {{disintegration}} of Russian satellite Sputnik I after the craft's onboard electronics failed. Dr. John D. Kraus, a professor at Ohio State University, knew that a meteor entering the upper atmosphere leaves in its wake {{a small amount of}} ionized air. This air reflects a stray radio signal back to Earth, strengthening the signal at the surface for a few seconds. This effect is known as meteor scatter. Dr. Kraus figured that what was left of Sputnik would exhibit the same effect, but on a larger scale. His prediction was correct; WWV's <b>signal</b> <b>was</b> noticeably strengthened for durations lasting over a minute. In addition, the strengthening came from a direction and at a time of day that agreed with predictions of the paths of Sputnik's last orbits. Using this information, Dr. Kraus was able to draw up a complete timeline of Sputnik's disintegration. In particular, he observed that satellites do not fall as one unit; instead, the spacecraft broke up into its component parts as it moved closer to Earth.|$|E
5|$|After making further radial {{velocity}} measurements, a planet orbiting {{at a distance}} of around 5 AU was announced in 2002. This planet received the designation 55 Cancri d. At the time of discovery, the planet was thought to be in an orbit of mild eccentricity (close to 0.1), but this value was increased by later measurements. Even after accounting for these two planets, a periodicity at 43 days remained, possibly due to a third planet. Measurements of the star suggested that this was close to the star's rotation period, which raised the possibility that the 43-day <b>signal</b> <b>was</b> caused by stellar activity. This possible planet received the designation 55 Cancri c.|$|E

5|$|After the {{evacuation}} <b>signal</b> <b>was</b> given, the buses began {{to pick up}} passengers and head to the DAO Compound. The system worked so efficiently that the buses {{were able to make}} three return journeys rather than the expected one. The biggest problem occurred when the ARVN guarding the main gate at Tan Son Nhut refused to allow the last convoy of buses into the DAO Compound at about 17:45. As this was happening, a firefight between two ARVN units broke out and caught the rearmost buses in the crossfire, disabling two of the vehicles. Eventually the ARVN commander controlling the gates agreed to permit the remaining buses to enter the compound. General Carey's threat to use the AH-1J SeaCobra helicopter gunships flying overhead may {{have played a role in}} the ARVN commander's decision.|$|E
5|$|At Valdez, {{construction}} was two-thirds complete by September as 4,200 workers hurried {{to complete the}} marine terminal. Because of loose soil found at the job site, enormous retaining walls had to be constructed to secure the ground below some of the 58 structures that were completed {{by the end of}} the year. During the first week of November, the first ship docked at the newly built Valdez quays. It was not a tanker but a ship bringing more construction material. In December, the first <b>signal</b> <b>was</b> sent from the Valdez operations center—where two new control computers had been installed—to Pump Station 2 on the North Slope.|$|E
5|$|But in 1960, Jacob Dekema, the {{district}} highway engineer, stated {{that due to}} lower traffic on US 80, {{the completion of the}} freeway through the mountains would be delayed until at least 1971.

That year, work continued on the freeway, and in August, only one traffic <b>signal</b> <b>was</b> left on the highway west of El Cajon, at Ward Road.
