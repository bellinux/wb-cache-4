40|$|Capacity and ultra-reliable {{communication}} {{are some}} of the requirements for 5 th generation (5 G) networks. One of the candidate technologies to satisfy capacity requirement is standalone Ultra Dense Network (UDN). However, UDNs are characterized by fast change of received signal strength that creates mobility challenges in terms of increased handovers and connection failures. In this paper, a low layer multiconnectivity scheme is presented for standalone UDN aiming at ultra-reliable communication that is free of interruptions from handover procedures and connection failures. Furthermore, the problem in managing of the set of <b>serving</b> <b>cells,</b> that are involved in multiconnectivity for each user, is formulated. By using numerical method, feasible scheme for management of the set of <b>serving</b> <b>cells</b> is derived. Performance of the proposed multiconnectivity scheme is evaluated and compared against single connectivity. It is shown that the proposed multiconnectivity scheme outperforms single connectivity considerably in terms of connection failures and cell-edge throughput...|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} improve the quality of service for users in {{hotspots}} and on cell edges, heterogenous networks (HetNet) are formed of a mixture of macro-, pico- and femto base stations serving corresponding-size areas. Frozen in December 2012, 3GPP Release 11 concentrates on better support of HetNet. Coordinated Multi-Point operation (CoMP) is a key feature of Release 11 in order to support such network structures. Whereas users located at a cell edge in homogenous networks suffer from decreasing signal strength compounded by neighbor cell interference, CoMP is designed to enable use of a neighboring cell to also transmit the same signal as the <b>serving</b> <b>cell,</b> enhancing quality of service on the perimeter of a <b>serving</b> <b>cell.</b> In-device Co-existence (IDC) is another topic addressed in Release 11. IDC features are designed to ameliorate disturbances within the user equipment caused between LTE/LTE-A and the various other radio subsystems such as WiFi, Bluetooth, and the GPS receiver. Further enhancements for MIMO such as 4x4 configuration for the uplink were standardized.|$|E

That is to say, the mobile station is aware that the radio signal is decaying rapidly, and must cell reselect rapidly, before communications are terminated because of radio link failure. When the mobile station radio-signal breaches the minimum receive level, the radio is no longer in a position to maintain acceptable communications for the user, and the radio link is broken.|$|E
