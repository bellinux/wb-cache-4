5|$|During {{the night}} of 3–4 February, there were tanks {{on the street in}} Cairo as many of the protesters again <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>in</b> Tahrir Square. Pro-government protesters were active and {{small-scale}} clashes happened in the early hours. Ahmad Mohamed Mahmoud of Al-Ta'awun became the first journalist to die covering the protests, from gunshot wounds sustained on 28January.|$|E
5|$|During the night, he {{was joined}} by his relatives, {{including}} Domitian. The armies of Mucianus were nearing Rome but the besieged Flavian party did not hold out for longer than a day. On 19 December, Vitellianists burst onto the Capitol and in a skirmish, Sabinus was captured and executed. Domitian managed to escape by disguising himself as a worshipper of Isis and <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>in</b> safety {{with one of his}} father's supporters, Cornelius Primus.|$|E
5|$|Within {{weeks of}} his arrival at prison, Berkman began {{planning}} his suicide. He tried to sharpen a spoon into a blade, but his attempt {{was discovered by}} a guard and Berkman <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>in</b> the dungeon. He thought about beating {{his head against the}} bars of his cell, but worried that his efforts might injure him but leave him alive. Berkman wrote a letter to Goldman, asking her to secure a dynamite capsule for him. A letter was smuggled out of the prison and arrangements were made for her to visit Berkman in November 1892, posing as his sister. Berkman knew {{as soon as he saw}} Goldman that she had not brought the dynamite capsule.|$|E
50|$|The family {{constructed}} {{by day and}} rehearsed on <b>the</b> stage at <b>night.</b> There {{was no place for}} the cast and crew to stay, so they <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>nights</b> <b>in</b> sleeping bags and tents. The Larsens had to work quickly as they were scheduled to open their first show in August, two-and-a-half months after construction began.|$|R
50|$|Following {{clues that}} pointed toward Michoacán, they hiked the {{mountains}} {{by day and}} <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>nights</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Winnebago. Finally on January 2, 1975, they found a summit called Cerro Pelón where the trees and even the ground were covered with millions of resting butterflies. Trail was 25 at the time. On January 9 they called the Urquharts to report their find. In early 1976 the Urquharts themselves came to visit the site they had sought for decades.|$|R
60|$|Religion soon {{tempered}} the ruder {{pleasures of}} the backwoods, but the dancing ceased before the drinking. Camp meetings were frolics of a soberer sort, where whole neighborhoods gathered and dwelt in tents for days in the beautiful autumn weather, and <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>nights</b> <b>in</b> prayer and song. Little log churches were built at the crossroads, and these served the purpose of schoolhouses on week days. But there was more religion than learning in the backwoods, and the preacher came before the teacher.|$|R
5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath, Serbs and Montenegrins {{from the local}} area attacked villages, and Adriatic Command sent the 2nd Company of the 7th Battalion from Bileća to reinforce the Ustaše. After a brief clash near Korita, during which the Ustaše and gendarmerie lost one killed and several wounded, the rebels withdrew across the nearby border into Montenegro. The 2nd Company of the 7th Battalion <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>in</b> the village of Stepen before establishing itself as the Avtovac garrison the following day. Due to its exposure to fire from rebels overlooking their location, the gendarmes were unable to re-occupy their post in Stepen, which meant that the Stepen–Korita road was no longer secure. On 8 June, the district office in Gacko reported to Adriatic Command that they had taken 200 Serbs as hostages and issued a proclamation to the population to cease fighting and surrender their weapons. As this proclamation met with no response, on 10 June the Ustaše Commissioner for Bosnia and Herzegovina, Jure Francetić, had 19 hostages shot (one escaped). On 12 June, the gendarmerie in Ravno shot four people on the orders of the Ustaše commissioner for Ljubinje. Such actions led to Serb peasants leaving their villages to seek safety in more remote areas, and Muslim villagers became increasingly nervous about their Serb neighbours.|$|E
5|$|Luongo {{recorded}} a 3–1 win against the Detroit Red Wings in his Canucks debut on October 5, 2006. Later in the month, he notched his first shutout with the Canucks, stopping 32 shots in a 5–0 {{win over the}} Chicago Blackhawks on October 25. On January 9, 2007, Luongo was voted in as a starting goaltender {{for the first time}} in his career for the Western Conference All-Stars. Six days after the announcement, he was hospitalized after taking a puck to the throat in practice. He <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>in</b> the intensive care unit for fears his windpipe would swell shut. Discharged from the hospital on game day, Luongo {{recorded a}} shutout that night against the Montreal Canadiens on January 16, 2007. During the 2007 NHL All-Star Game in Dallas, Luongo was named the Skills Competition's top goaltender and helped the West to a 12–9 win over the East. Late in the season, Luongo recorded his franchise record-setting 39th win in a 2–1 overtime victory on March 9. He surpassed Kirk McLean's 38-win mark set in 1991–92. He went on to finish with a career-high 47 wins, one shy of league-leader Martin Brodeur, who broke Bernie Parent's thirty-three-year-old NHL record of wins in a season. Luongo and Brodeur are considered, however, to have been given an advantage to Parent with the inauguration of the shootout that season by the NHL, allowing more games to be decided with wins, as opposed to ties.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{opens with}} Hilary Robinson (Anne Scott-Pendlebury) {{bringing}} breakfast to newlyweds Paul (Stefan Dennis) and Gail Robinson (Fiona Corke). She is {{surprised to find}} that they have <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>in</b> separate bedrooms. To hide the fact that they only married for business purposes, Gail tells Hilary that she and Paul had an argument the night before. Hilary tells them to sort things out and she tends to the bouquets. At the Robinson house, Scott (Jason Donovan) begins to panic about getting married, while his father, Jim (Alan Dale), and best friend, Mike Young (Guy Pearce), set up tables for the reception. Meanwhile, Lucy Robinson (Sasha Close) tries to find her pet mice. Over at the Ramsay house, Scott's fiancée, Charlene (Kylie Minogue), is getting ready. Her mother, Madge (Anne Charleston), asks her brother Henry (Craig McLachlan) not to race up the altar. Hilary brings in the wedding bouquet, while Charlene's friend and bridesmaid, Jane (Annie Jones) arrives. After receiving a blue garter from her grandmother, Charlene becomes excited about the wedding. Scott arrives at the church with Mike, Paul and Jim. He is greeted by his old school friends and Mike explains that he and Jane arranged for them to attend {{to make up for the}} absence of Charlene's extended family.|$|E

5|$|Tuđman <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>in</b> a Croatian Air Force and Air Defence command posta tunnel running {{under the}} Gornji Gradwhere {{information}} on the movement of Yugoslav aircraft was relayed. In the morning, Yugoslav General Andrija Rašeta informed the press that his superiors may decide to attack Zagreb {{as a form of}} pressure on Tuđman. Three air raid alarms were sounded during the morning of 7 October because the Yugoslav Air Force deployed as many as 30 to 40 combat jets in the Zagreb area, and numerous tip-offs of imminent air raids were received from Yugoslav military bases. During the morning, Yugoslav Air Force jets were observed taking off from bases near Pula and Udbina in Croatia and Banja Luka in Bosnia and Herzegovina. No flights were recorded taking off from Željava Air Base, presumably because of low cloud cover in the area. At 1:30pm, the Croatian Army captured a Yugoslav military communications centre and radar post near Velika Buna, south of Zagreb, hindering Yugoslav Air Force control of aircraft in the area. It is believed that the event affected the timing of the raid on the Banski dvori, the official residence of the President of Croatia at the time.|$|E
5|$|In Rome meanwhile, Domitian {{was placed}} {{under house arrest}} by Vitellius, as a {{safeguard}} against future Flavian aggression. Support for the old emperor was waning however, as more legions throughout the empire pledged their allegiance to Vespasian. On 24 October 69 the forces of Vitellius and Vespasian clashed at the Second Battle of Bedriacum, which ended in a crushing defeat for the armies of Vitellius. In despair, he attempted to negotiate a surrender. Terms of peace, including a voluntary abdication, were agreed upon with Titus Flavius Sabinus II, but the soldiers of the Praetorian Guardthe imperial bodyguardconsidered such a resignation disgraceful, and prevented Vitellius from carrying out the treaty. On the morning of 18 December, the emperor appeared to deposit the imperial insignia at the Temple of Concord, {{but at the last}} minute retraced his steps to the imperial palace. In the confusion, the leading men of the state gathered at Sabinus' house, proclaiming Vespasian Emperor, but the multitude dispersed when Vitellian cohorts clashed with the armed escort of Sabinus, who was forced to retreat to the Capitoline Hill. During the night, he was joined by his relatives, including Domitian. The armies of Mucianus were nearing Rome, but the besieged Flavian party did not hold out for longer than a day. On 19 December, Vitellianists burst onto the Capitol, and in the resulting skirmish, Sabinus was captured and executed. Domitian himself managed to escape by disguising himself as a worshipper of Isis, and <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>in</b> safety with one of his father's supporters. By the afternoon of 20 December Vitellius was dead, his armies having been defeated by the Flavian legions. With nothing more to be feared from the enemy, Domitian came forward to meet the invading forces; he was universally saluted by the title of Caesar, and the mass of troops conducted him to his father's house. The following day, 21 December, the Senate proclaimed Vespasian emperor of the Roman Empire.|$|E

25|$|The young emperor, {{who could}} no longer cope with his grief and loneliness, grew more and more ill-tempered. He began to treat his {{servants}} with cruelty and punished them physically for minor offences. Under the joined influence of court eunuchs and Zaicheng, Prince Gong's eldest son and the Tongzhi Emperor's best friend, the emperor managed to escape the palace in search of pleasure in the unrestricted parts of Beijing. For several evenings the emperor disguised himself as a commoner and secretly <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>nights</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> brothels of Beijing.
