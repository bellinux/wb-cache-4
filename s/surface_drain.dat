Agricultural pollution {{is a primary}} source of impairment to water bodies in the US. In the agriculturally intensive Midwestern Region of the US, agricultural production is contingent upon the drainage of excess water from the landscape through constructed drainage networks. Drainage networks typically consist of horizontal subsurface tile drains and vertical surface inlets routed to drainage channels and streams. Surface inlets are utilized to drain topographical areas which often accumulate surface water. North Central Iowa is an agriculturally intensive area comprising the southeastern portion of the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) : a landscape containing a high density of enclosed topographical depressions known as prairie potholes. This region maintains {{a large number of}} surface drains in order to drain the prairie potholes and thus increase the productivity of the lands within them. Draining prairie potholes by the installation of surface drains may increase water flows as well as the loadings of agricultural water quality contaminants to receiving waters. This study focuses on the hydrology of and contaminant loading from a drained prairie pothole located in a 39. 5 ha agricultural field in North Central Iowa. To assess the hydrology of the drained topographical depression, water balances were performed using climactic and water level data. Flows of water into the surface tile inlet were calculated using continuous water level data obtained via pressure transducer located near the <b>surface</b> <b>drain</b> within the topographical depression. Precipitation inflows and evaporative outflows to the pond were calculated using climactic data. Groundwater levels were monitored to assess groundwater and surface water interactions. The results of these water balances showed distinct differences in the inflows to and outflows from the depression based on antecedent conditions. In wet conditions, groundwater flow to the pond was significant source of water accounting for more than 20 % of the total inflow. In drier conditions groundwater was not a source of water and infiltration comprised at least 30 % of the outflow. Over the entire study period, the <b>surface</b> <b>drain</b> was the largest outflow from the pond accounting for 17160 m 3, 95 %, of the iii total outflow. Evaporation from and precipitation on the pond surface proved to be minor components of the water budget, accounting for 2 % and 4 % of the total water budget, respectively. Concentrations of potential agricultural pollutants (Total Dissolved Solids, Nitrate, Dissolved Phosphate, Total Phosphorus, Total Suspended Solids, and Dissolved Organic Carbon) were determined by the analysis of grab samples obtained from ponded water which accumulated within the depression as the result of precipitation events. Chemical loads and yields were calculated using corresponding flows into the <b>surface</b> <b>drain</b> and constituent concentrations from June until Mid-August of 2008. These values were then compared to calculated upstream loads within the receiving drainage channel to compare the relative contributions of the surface tile inlet to the watershed’s effluent. The receiving channel drains a 3640 ha catchment containing extensive drainage infrastructure immediately upstream of topographical depression. Calculated yields from the drained depression were: Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) : 168 kg ha- 1, Nitrate as nitrogen (NO 3 - -N) : 8. 4 kg ha- 1, Orthophosphate as phosphorus (PO 43 - -P) : 0. 4 kg ha- 1, Total Phosphorus as phosphorus (TP -P) : 0. 9 kg ha- 1, Total Suspended Solids (TSS) : 788 kg ha- 1, and Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) : 11 kg ha- 1. Calculated yields for the receiving channel were: TDS: 722 kg ha- 1, NO 3 - -N: 23. 2 kg ha- 1, PO 43 - -P: 0. 4 kg ha- 1, TP -P: 1. 0 kg ha- 1, TSS: 991 kg ha- 1, DOC: 11 kg ha- 1.

40|$|With recent {{increased}} interest in {{oil and gas exploration}} and development in the Arctic comes increased potential for an accidental hydrocarbon release into the cryosphere, including within and at the base of snow.

Numerical modeling shows that ground-penetrating radar (GPR) is sensitive to the presence of oil in the snow pack over a broad range of snow densities and oil types. Oil spills from the <b>surface</b> <b>drain</b> through the snow by the mechanisms of unsaturated flow and form geometrically complex distributions that are controlled by snow stratigraphy. These complex distributions generate an irregular pattern of radar reflections that can be differentiated from natural snow stratigraphy, but in many cases, interpretation will not be straightforward.

Results of a controlled field experiment using a helicopter- borne, 1000 -MHz GPR system showed that a 2 -cm-thick oil film trapped between snow and sea ice was detected based on a 51 % decrease in reflection strength. This is the first reported test of GPR for the problem of oil detection in and under snow.

As a consequence, the diversity and species richness of benthic communities are often degraded. The chronic toxicity of a landfill leachate was investigated in this study, with respect to determining the ‘environmentally safe’ concentration in which the long term survival of an Asellus aquaticus population is assured.

The toxicity was judged based on birth frequency and the final length of juveniles. Tests showed that even a dilution of 1 : 20 would influence the breeding colony size of Asellus. A 30 mg l? 1 COD concentration was judged to be the ‘environmentally safe’ leachate dilution in which the frequency of births and juvenile length (after 4 weeks of monitoring) would not be affected.

It has predominantly water logging problem with water table ranging 0. 54 to 0. 78 m from the ground surface. Half of the waterlogged area is fallow and the major crops growing in the area are sugarcane, maize and wheat. Yield of these crops were 47, 36 and 37 % lower as compared to waterlogged area. Spacing of the field drains ranged from 8 to 374 m with highest drain density at the tail portion of the project area where water logging was also high. The hydraulic conductivity of the site varied from 0. 73 to 3 m/day. A deep open drain was constructed by Irrigation Department in 1985 but was not properly maintained since its construction.

Cleaning and rehabilitation of the drain has resulted in significant lowering of water table in the project area.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Inorganic colloids are ubiquitous in environmental waters and {{are thought to be}} potential transporters of radionuclides and other toxic metals. Colloids present large surface areas to pollutants and contaminants present in waters and are therefore capable of sorbing and transporting them via groundwater and surface water movement. Much research has been and is currently being undertaken to understand more fully the stability of colloids in different water chemistries, factors which affect metal sorption onto colloids, and the processes which affect metal-colloid transport. This thesis first investigates ground water and surface water sampling and characterisation techniques for the investigation of the colloids present in and around a low-level waste repository. Samples were collected anaerobically using micro-purge low-flow methodology (MPLF) and then subjected to sequential ultrafiltration, again anaerobically. After separation into size fractions the solids were analysed for radiochemical content, colloid population and morphology. It was found that colloids were present in large numbers in the groundwaters extracted from the trench waste burial area (anaerobic environment), but in the <b>surface</b> <b>drain</b> waters (aerobic environment) colloid population was comparable t 6 levels found in waters extracted from' above the trenches. There was evidence that the non-tritium activity was associated with the colloids and particulates in the trenches, but outside of the trenches the evidence was not conclusive because the activity and colloid concentrations were low. Secondly this thesis investigates the stability of inorganic colloids, mainly haematite, in the presence of humic acid, varying pH and electrolyte concentrations. The applicability of the Schulze-Hardy rule to haematite and haematitelhumic acid mixtures was investigated using photon correlation spectroscopy to measure the rate of fast and slow coagulation after the addition of mono, di and trivalent ions. It was found that humic coated colloids follow the Schulze-Hardy rule for mono and divalent cations, with the exception of copper ions. Trivalent ions do not follow the Schulze-Hardy rule because of their relatively strong complexation with humates. It was also found that the size of the ion has an effect on destabilisation, irrespective of charge...|$|E
