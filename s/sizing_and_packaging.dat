Therefore, the properties of {{size and shape}} of the sweet orange cultivar, ‘Valencia’, and its three mutants, ‘A 70 ’, ‘A 77 ’, and ‘A 88 ’ were determined by image processing. The blood orange cultivar, ‘Moro’, was also included in this analysis. The volume of each cultivar and mutant was measured by the liquid displacement method. Linear equations with high R 2 values were developed in order to estimate the surface area and geometric mean diameter, which were dependent upon the mass and volume of the orange samples. The results of this study showed that the ‘A 70 ’ mutant differed from the other mutants and the ‘Valencia’ cultivar in regard to most physical properties. The ‘A 70 ’ and ‘A 88 ’ mutants and the ‘Valencia’ cultivar had the highest sphericity values, which varied from 96. 41 % to 97. 18 %. The lowest shape factor was found in the ‘Valencia’ cultivar, with a mean of 0. 73. The elongation of the ‘A 88 ’ mutant and ‘Valencia’ (1. 07 each) was smaller than that of the other cultivars. The highest coefficient of variance was observed within the ‘Valencia’ and ‘Moro’ cultivars in most physical properties, suggesting that the ‘Valencia’ mutants produce more homogeneous fruits than the ‘Valencia’ cultivar itself...|$|E
40|$|Since March 1999, the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP), {{located in}} southeastern New Mexico, has been {{operated}} by the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE), Carlsbad Field Office (CBFO), as a repository for the permanent disposal of defense-related transuranic (TRU) waste. More than 1, 450 shipments of TRU waste for WIPP disposal have been completed, and the WIPP is currently receiving 12 to 16 shipments per week from five DOE sites around the nation. One of the largest fleets of Type B packagings supports the transportation of TRU waste to WIPP. This paper discusses {{the development of this}} fleet since the original Certificate of Compliance (C of C) for the Transuranic Package Transporter-II (TRUPACT-II) was issued by the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in 1989. Evolving site programs, closure schedules of major sites, and the TRU waste inventory at the various DOE sites have directed the <b>sizing</b> <b>and</b> <b>packaging</b> mix of this fleet. This paper discusses the key issues that guided this fleet development, including the following: While the average weight of a 55 -gallon drum packaging debris could be less than 300 pounds (lbs.), drums containing sludge waste or compacted waste could approach the maximum allowable weight of 1, 000 lbs. A TRUPACT-II shipment may consist of three TRUPACT-II packages, each of which is limited to a total weight of 19, 250 lbs. Payload assembly weights dictated by ''as-built'' TRUPACT-II weights limit each drum to an average weight of 312 lbs when three TRUPACT-IIs are shipped. To optimize the shipment of heavier drums, the HalfPACT packaging was designed as a shorter and lighter version of the TRUPACT-II to accommodate a heavier load. Additional packaging concepts are currently under development, including the ''TRUPACT-III'' packaging being designed to address ''oversized'' boxes that are currently not shippable in the TRUPACT-II or HalfPACT due to size constraints. Shipment optimization is applicable not only to the addition of new packagings, but also to the addition of new payload containers (used inside the NRC-approved Type B packaging) with revised design limits. For example, to address the shipment of specific TRU waste forms, a series of pipe overpack payload containers have been designed and approved by the NRC. The ''standard'' pipe overpack configuration is designed to allow the shipment of higher fissile gram containers, each with a maximum fissile gram equivalent (FGE) loading of 200 grams (g). For shipments of waste packaged in the standard pipe overpack, the FGE limit is 2, 800 g per TRUPACT-II and 1, 400 g per HalfPACT. The ''S 100 '' and ''S 200 '' pipe overpack configurations allow the use of shielded configurations of the pipe overpack for shipment of specific gamma- and neutron-emitting waste forms. The 72 -B Cask and the 10 - 160 B Cask have been approved by the NRC for the transportation of remote-handled (RH) TRU waste, which comprises {{a small fraction of the}} overall inventory that will be shipped to WIPP...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1967 This study {{originated}} with industry recognition of inadequate flexibility in currently used procedures for grading, <b>sizing,</b> <b>and</b> <b>packaging</b> fresh apples in North Central Washington. Field-run apples are {{introduced into the}} process, and {{nearly all of the}} product must be placed in a marketing package in the process. Portions of the output products are stored for a 12 -month marketing period. Frequently during this marketing period there are changes in the types of packaging demanded. In recognition of this problem, research has developed prototype equipment for performing a presorting and presizing function. Presorted and presized apples could be returned to bulk bin storage for later selective market preparation. This study provides cost information on the application of this new procedure that should be useful to managers of packing plants. The principal objective of the study is to determine how the application of the new procedure would affect the production-point marketing margins. An intermediate objective is to establish industry structure and trends that might relate to the application of the new procedure. Cost analysis is limited to those operating input costs that would likely be affected by the application of the new procedure. An economic-engineering method of analysis is used to measure the relative efficiency of the old and new techniques. A sample of four representative apple packing lines was analyzed for rate of output in standard operating periods (eight-hour shifts) and for average costs per unit of output in these periods. Cost per unit of output associated with integrating the presorting and presizing function into the process was estimated. Operating and cost models were developed for both the standard packing line and the new method. From analysis of standard packing line operation, it was concluded that presorting and presizing the 50 per cent of the total seasonal volume with the lowest quality would improve the rate of product output on standard packing lines. This is the basis for estimating operating and cost models of the new technique. Models are based on annual seasonal output volumes of 210, 000, 28 O, 000 and 350, 000 boxes (42 pounds of apples per box). These volumes represent a majority of the larger packing plants in North Central Washington. Average operating input costs per unit of output increase due to the application of presorting and presizing. The increase was approximately. 025 per unit of output. This is one per cent of the average production-point marketing margin. Application of the new method would not increase the economic efficiency of this specific phase of grading, sizing, and packing fresh apples. The application of presorting and presizing and integration with the current packing line procedures in apple packing plants in North Central Washington could result in total cost savings in individual plants through the more efficient use of storage facilities. Approximately 20 per cent more product can be stored in refrigerated storage or modified atmosphere refrigerated storage in bulk form in bins as compared to finished product storage. Presorting and presizing 50 per cent of the field-nm product would also result in greatly improved flexibility in adapting to the market. The relatively small additional cost of application of this presorting and presizing function would improve the efficiency of many larger apple packing plants. The economic value would vary with each plant. Individual plant variables that should be analyzed are total seasonal volume and trends, storage capacity, current packing line efficiency, and marketing program...|$|E

The upgrades consisted of the dismantlement, removal, and on-site storage of contaminated equipment, cell components, and scrap material (e. g., metal) from the cascade facilities. Scrap metal including other materials (e. g., drums, obsolete equipment) not related to this upgrade program have thus far accumulated in nine contiguous radiologically-contaminated and non-contaminated scrap yards covering 1. 05 E 5 m 2 (26 acres) located in the northwestern portion of the PGDP. This paper presents the sequencing of field operations and methods used to achieve the safe removal and disposition of over 47, 000 tonnes (53, 000 tons) of metal and miscellaneous items contained in these yards.
