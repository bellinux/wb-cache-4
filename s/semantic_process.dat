50|$|Schemas {{are used}} to {{interpret}} the functions involved when individuals would {{make sense of their}} surroundings. This cognition happens through an explicit process of recalling an item routinely or implicit process that is outside conscious awareness control. A recent study suggests individuals who have experienced a difficult upbringing develop schemata of fear as well as anxiety and will react almost immediately when they feel threatened. People who are anxious predominantly focus on any peril-related stimuli since they are hyper vigilant. For example, an anxious individual who is about to cross the street {{at the same time a}} car drives to a stop sign. The anxious person will automatically assume the driver will not stop. This is recognition of threat through a <b>semantic</b> <b>process</b> that instantaneously occurs. Ambiguous cues are viewed as a threat since there is no relevant knowledge to make sense of. People will have a difficult time to understand and will respond negatively. This kind of behavior can explain how implicit cognition may be an influence for pathological anxiety.|$|E

We then devise a tableau based proof system mirroring the <b>semantic</b> <b>process</b> by purely syntactic (i. e. programmable) means.

As a byproduct of the refinement we have a simple tableau method of deciding quasi-tautologies and a proof system without the eigen-variable condition. 1 Introduction The idea of reducing predicate logic to (propositional) tautologies {{can be traced back}} to the Henkin's proof of completeness of predicate calculus [5] but it was first explicitly formulated by Smullyan in the form of his Fundamental theorem [8]. He calls the idea central to predicate logic. A modern and very readable exposition is by Barwise in [1]. The semantic reduction of predicate logic to tautologies can be expressed as follows: T j= A iff the formula V 1 !in A i ! A is a tautology for some n 0 such that A i 2 T[Eq[Q.

40|$|Web service {{composition}} is gaining a considerable momentum as {{an approach to}} the effective integration of distributed, heterogeneous, and autonomous application. Current composed service processes are mostly generated in the syntactic level and in a manual way. The limitation of the approach {{is that it does}} not allow business to dynamic change partners and services. In order to avoid this disadvantage, it is critical to map complex business from abstract process to executable flows according to application domain semantics and dynamic business requirements. In this paper, we first present a semantic-based Web service composition framework called SWSCF based on both <b>semantic</b> <b>process</b> recommendation and semantic matchmaking. Then, we analyze some key technologies including: (1) Introducing hierarchical activity mechanism for dynamic decomposition of business requirements to find a suitable <b>semantic</b> <b>process</b> template; (2) Searching and selecting service chain to match a semantic activity template which is used to specify an abstract activity; (3) Devising heterogeneous message transforming mechanism to eliminate the incompatible message types during generating data flow of an executable process.

40|$|In {{order to}} obtain the desired {{information}} or functionality in the Web, a user often needs to perform multiple interactions with the Web site, e. g. submitting Web forms filled up with appropriate information, and the further execution of such a Web process depends on the {{information provided by the}} user in the previous steps of the process. The formal models underlying existing systems for supporting users in coping with the Web do not capture the dynamics and data flow of Web processes. As a result, searching for information in the so called ”Deep Web ” or desired business processes offered via the Web still requires significant manual effort. In this paper, we present a <b>semantic</b> <b>process</b> description language and present a mapping of the dynamics and data flow of Web sites to our <b>semantic</b> <b>process</b> description language. In order to allow development of more sophisticated methods and tools that consider the dynamics and data flow inside or among Web sites, significant number of descriptions of Web sites are needed.

In experiment 1, participants performed a phonological task (decide whether targets rhymed with a previously heard rhyme). The phonological relation elicited a frontal negativity whereas the semantic relation elicited a left anterior negativity, both followed by an N 400 at centro-parietal sites. In experiment 2, participants performed a semantic task (decide whether targets belonged to a previously presented semantic category).

40|$|Accumulating {{evidence}} suggests that psychopathy is associated with behavioral and event-related poten-tial (ERP) abnormalities during semantic language tasks. Psychopaths ERP abnormalities are most prom-inent in the 300 – 500 ms post-stimulus time window. It is unclear whether these ERP differences are related to neurocognitive processes associated with the P 300 (i. e., poor attention/orienting/working memory) or N 400 (i. e., aberrant <b>semantic</b> <b>processes).</b> To address this issue, the present study employed a canonical semantic sentence processing paradigm known to selectively elicit the N 400. Fifty incarcerated participants were divided into psychopathic (n = 25) or nonpsychopathic (n = 25) groups based on scores from the Hare Psychopathy Checklist-Revised.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study is to characterize, analyze, and {{demonstrate}} machine-understandable <b>semantic</b> <b>process</b> for validating, integrating, and processing technical design information. This establishes both a vision and tools for information reuse and semi-automatic processing in engineering design projects, including virtual machine laboratory applications with generated components. Design/methodology/approach: The process model has been developed iteratively in terms of action research, constrained by the existing technical design practices and assumptions (design documents, expert feedback), available technologies (pre-studies and experiments with scripting and pipeline tools), benchmarking with other process models and methods (notably the RUP and DITA), and formal requirements (computability and the critical information paths for the generated applications). In practice, the work includes both quantitative and qualitative components. Findings: Technical design processes may be greatly enhanced in terms of <b>semantic</b> <b>process</b> thinking, by enriching design information, and automating information validation and transformation tasks. Contemporary design information, however, is mainly intended for human consumption, and needs to be explicitly enriched with the currently missing data and interfaces. In practice, this may require acknowledging the role of technical information or knowledge engineer, to lead the development of the semantic design information process in a design organization. There is also a trade-off between machine-readability and system complexity that needs to be studied further, both empirically and in theory. Research limitations/implications: The conceptualization of the <b>semantic</b> <b>process</b> is essentially an abstraction based on the idea of progressive design. While this effectively allows implementing semantic processes with, e. g., pipeline technologies, the abstraction is valid only when technical design is organized into reasonably distinct tasks. Practical implications: Our work points out a best practice for technical information management in progressive design that can be applied on different levels. Social implications: Current design processes may be somewhat impaired by legacy practices that do not promote information reuse and collaboration beyond conventional task domains. Our work provides a reference model to analyze and develop design activities as formalized work-flows. This work should lead into improved industry design process models and novel CAD/CAM/PDM applications, thereby strengthening industry design processes. Originality/value: While extensively studied, semantic modeling in technical design has been largely dominated by the idea of capturing design artifacts without a clear rationale why this is done and what level of detail should be favored in models. In the <b>semantic</b> <b>process</b> presented in this article, the utility and the chief quality criteria of semantic models (of technical information and artifacts) are explicitly established by the semantic processing pipeline(s). This constructively explains the significance of semantic models as communication and information requirement interfaces, with concrete use cases. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Most of today’s {{business}} processes {{are complex and}} consist {{of more than one}} party or single step procedures. In the Web, this is reflected by the existence of billions of Web sites, which may be regarded as complex processes, {{and on the other side}} only a few thousands of publicly available WSDL files that present single services. The availability of semantic descriptions of services and processes in the Web facilitates their discovery, as well as their composition into more complex workflows. It also facilitates the automatic execution of such workflows despite their heterogeneity. However, the deficit of semantic descriptions of Web processes deprives the users from using such sophisticated automatic techniques. The scope of our research is to fill this gap by providing semi-automatic techniques for the acquisition of a large number of <b>semantic</b> <b>process</b> descriptions on the (deep) Web. We model the data found in the online sources using ontologies, mine the process a user follows through the Web forms and generate a semantic description of this process. We present in this paper the implementation of our algorithms for the acquisition of process descriptions. We also provide a Web-based editor for manual annotation of new processes and refinement of the automatically-generated descriptions.

40|$|A central {{topic of}} {{discussion}} in the exploration of semantic disturbance in Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s disease (AD) concerns the relative contribution of semantic content (e. g., semantic features) and <b>semantic</b> <b>process.</b> Studies have suggested that semantic dysfunction in AD {{is the result of}} deficits to either <b>semantic</b> <b>process,</b> semantic content or both. Studies that have supported the loss of semantic content have been criticised for their use of verbal stimuli and cognitively challenging experimental tasks. The current study used a novel version of the yes no recognition memory task to compare the processing of distinctive and non-distinctive features in participants with AD whilst controlling the cognitive demands of the task. The task involved five conditions which denoted the relationship between the items in the test and study phase. A 2 ̆ 7 non-distinctive 2 ̆ 7 and a 2 ̆ 7 distinctive 2 ̆ 7 condition were included where non-distinctive and distinctive semantic features were manipulated between study and test, respectively. Task accuracy of participants with AD decreased relative to control participants when distinctive features were manipulated between the study and test phase of the experiment. There {{was no significant difference between}} groups when non-distinctive features were manipulated. These findings provide evidence to support the loss of semantic content in AD.

During the execution of a learning process, several events occur which are of interest and/or necessary for completing and achieving a learning goal. The work in this paper describes a <b>Semantic</b> <b>Process</b> Mining approach directed towards automated learning. The proposed approach involves the extraction of process history data from learning execution environments, which is then followed by submitting the resulting eXtensible Event Streams (XES) and Mining eXtensible Markup Language (MXML) format to the process analytics environment for mining and further analysis. The XES and MXML data logs are enriched by using Semantic Annotations that references concepts in an Ontology specifically designed for representing learning processes.
