5|$|The {{earliest}} {{evidence of}} silk {{was found at}} the sites of Yangshao culture in Xia County, Shanxi, where a silk cocoon was found cut in half by a sharp knife, dating back to between 4000 and 3000 BCE. The species was identified as Bombyx mori, the domesticated silkworm. Fragments of primitive loom {{can also be seen}} from the sites of Hemudu culture in Yuyao, Zhejiang, dated to about 4000 BCE. The earliest example of <b>silk</b> <b>fabric</b> is from 3630 BC, and was used as wrapping for the body of a child. The fabric comes from a Yangshao site in Qingtaicun at Rongyang, Henan. Scraps of silk were found in a Liangzhu culture site at Qianshanyang in Huzhou, Zhejiang, dating back to 2700 BCE. Other fragments have been recovered from royal tombs in the Shang Dynasty (c. 1600 – c. 1046 BCE).|$|E

The dyed <b>silk</b> <b>fabrics</b> displayed attractive appearance in colour and thier colour depth was in higher levels. However, their colour fastness was considerably poor. Antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus IFO 12732 and Escherichia coli K 12 W 3110 of the <b>silk</b> <b>fabrics</b> dyed with plant-dyes were measured by SEK Test Method. The antibacterial activity of these dyed <b>silk</b> <b>fabrics</b> {{was in the}} acceptable level as an antibacterial substance. The antibacterial activity of dyed <b>silk</b> <b>fabrics</b> changed with the concentration {{and the kind of}} mordant in pretreated fabrics.

Gold nanoparticles were in-situ synthesized after heating the <b>silk</b> <b>fabrics</b> immersed in gold ion solution. Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) {{properties of the}} treated <b>silk</b> <b>fabrics</b> varied as the concentration of gold ions changed, {{in relation to the}} morphologies of gold nanoparticles on silk. In addition, X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to observe the structure of the gold nanoparticle treated <b>silk</b> <b>fabrics.</b> The SERS enhancement effect of the <b>silk</b> <b>fabrics</b> treated with gold nanoparticles was evaluated by collecting Raman signals of different concentrations of p-aminothiophenol (PATP), 4 -mercaptopyridine (4 -MPy) and crystal violet (CV) solutions. The results demonstrate that the <b>silk</b> <b>fabrics</b> corresponding to 0. 3 and 0. 4 mM of gold ions possess high SERS activity compared to the other treated fabrics. It is suggested that both the gold content and morphologies of gold nanoparticles dominate the SERS effect of the treated <b>silk</b> <b>fabrics...</b>|$|R

In addition, montmorillonoid was doped into the graphene oxide hydrosol to further improve the flame retardancy of <b>silk</b> <b>fabrics.</b> The flame retardancy and ultraviolet resistance were mainly characterized by limiting oxygen index, vertical flame test, smoke density test, and ultraviolet protection factor. The synergistic effect of graphene oxide and montmorillonoid on the thermal stabilization property of the treated <b>silk</b> <b>fabrics</b> was also investigated.

30|$|The in situ {{synthesis}} of gold nanoparticles (NPs) on <b>silk</b> <b>fabrics</b> was realized by the induction of sunlight. The as-synthesized gold NPs endowed <b>silk</b> <b>fabrics</b> with bright colors due to localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of metal NPs. The K/S of the treated <b>silk</b> <b>fabrics</b> could be tuned by controlling {{the concentration of}} gold ions in reaction system. Acid condition favored the sunlight-induced {{synthesis of}} gold NPs. The colored <b>silk</b> <b>fabrics</b> exhibited great color fastness to sunlight. Significantly, the treatment with gold NPs rendered excellent UV protection ability to <b>silk</b> <b>fabrics.</b> The photo-induced coloration based on gold NPs was also feasible under a humid condition without large water consumption, which not only provides a novel water-saving dyeing technology but also offers an effective route to achieve pattern dyeing of fabrics. Combination of sunlight-induced coloration method and surface modification of fibers will facilitate the development of multi-functional textiles.|$|R

30|$|<b>Silk</b> <b>fabrics</b> were {{colored by}} gold {{nanoparticles}} (NPs) {{that were in}} situ synthesized through the induction of sunlight. Owing to the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of gold NPs, the treated <b>silk</b> <b>fabrics</b> presented vivid colors. The photo-induced synthesis of gold NPs was also realized on wet silk through adsorbing gold ions out of solution, which provides a water-saving coloration method for textiles. Besides, the patterning of silk was feasible using this simple sunlight-induced coloration approach. The key factors of coloration including gold ion concentration, pH value, and irradiation time were investigated. Moreover, it was demonstrated that either ultraviolet (UV) light or visible light could induce the generation of gold NPs on <b>silk</b> <b>fabrics.</b> The <b>silk</b> <b>fabrics</b> with gold NPs exhibited high light resistance including great UV-blocking property and excellent fastness to sunlight.|$|R

2500|$|Most larvae spin a silken cocoon in {{the leaves}} of a {{preferred}} host plant or in leaf litter on the ground, or crevices in rocks and logs. While only moderately close relatives to the silkworm (Bombyx mori) among the Lepidoptera, the cocoons of most larger saturniids can be gathered and used to make <b>silk</b> <b>fabric.</b> However, larvae of some species [...] typically Ceratocampinae, like the regal moth (Citheronia regalis) and the imperial moth (Eacles imperialis), burrow and pupate in a small chamber beneath the soil. This is common in the Ceratocampinae and Hemileucinae. Unlike most silk moths, those that pupate underground do not use much silk in the construction. Once enclosed in the cocoon, the caterpillar sheds the larval skin and becomes a pupa, and the pupa undergoes metamorphosis for about 14, at which point it either emerges or goes into diapause. During metamorphosis, respiratory systems will stay intact, the digestive system will dissolve, and reproductive organs will take form.|$|E

Varna was renowned for the processing of fox fur, which was used for production of luxurious clothes. According to Western European sources, there was an abundance of silk in Bulgaria.
