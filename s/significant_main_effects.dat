25|$|The {{rhetoric of}} the nudism and anti-nudism {{movements}} emphasizes freedom {{from many of the}} normal constraints which regulate human interaction in nudist settings, although for different reasons. Using data from French and German beaches, this hypothesis was tested using five different indicators. Little significant variation between nudists and non-nudists within French and German settings is found in their patterns of interactional spacing, while more <b>significant</b> <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> for differences of cultures are found regardless of nudity status. As a subculture, nudists would appear to differ from nonnudists only in their propensity to like to sunbathe in the nude. Their nude status would appear to have none of the de-inhibiting effects often attributed to nudism. By contrast, clear cultural differences between German and French cultures are shown consistent with Hall's high-low context distinction and the Francoeur's hot-cool sexuality continuum.|$|E

40|$|Protective {{clothing}} worn by wildland firefighters (WLFF) {{may increase}} physiological strain and heat stress factors {{due to increased}} insulation and decreased ventilation. PURPOSE: To {{examine the effects of}} a flame resistant synthetic material base layer on heat stress factors. METHODS: Ten recreationally active males (25 ± 6. 1 yrs, 80. 9 ± 8. 4 kg, 11. 1 ± 5. 3 % fat, 4. 4 ± 0. 6 L·min- 1 VO 2 max) completed two trials of intermittent (50 min walking, 10 min sitting) treadmill walking (2. 5 mph, 4 % grade) over 3 hours in a climate chamber (35 ⁰C, 30 % RH). Participants wore standard WLFF Nomex green pants, yellow shirt with either a 100 % cotton base layer (C) or a flame resistant synthetic material base layer (S), while carrying a 35 lb pack, hard hat, and gloves. Exercise was followed by a 30 minute rest period without pack, hard hat, gloves, or Nomex yellow shirt. Core (Tc) and skin (Tsk) temperature were measured continuously throughout the trial. Skin blood flow (SBF) and skin temperature (DTsk) was recorded via laser doppler for two minutes prior to walking, five minutes during each break, and three, five minute periods during the 30 minutes following exercise. Physiological strain index (PSI) was calculated. Water was scripted at 8 ml/kg/hr. Repeated measures ANOVAs were performed using SPSS 22. 0. RESULTS: <b>Significant</b> <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> for time were found on Tc (p≤ 0. 001) and Tsk (p= 0. 003). No significant trialXtime interactions were found in Tc (p= 0. 077) and Tsk (p= 0. 086). SBF showed <b>significant</b> <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> for time (p= 0. 001) and a trialXtime interaction (p= 0. 001). <b>Significant</b> <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> for time were found on DTsk (p= 0. 001). Comparisons for SBF and DTsk were made between peaks, nadirs, and the three post-exercise periods for C and S. <b>Significant</b> <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> for time were found on SBF peaks (p= 0. 001), nadirs (p= 0. 028), and posts (p= 0. 001). <b>Significant</b> <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> for time were found on DTsk peaks (p= 0. 019) and posts (p= 0. 001). No significant trialXtime interactions were found between C and S. <b>Significant</b> <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> for time and trial were found on PSI (p≤ 0. 001 and p= 0. 04, respectively).

A series of weighted, two-way analyses of variance were performed on positive and negative initiations among the Americans and Hmong-Americans. Results revealed <b>significant</b> <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> for culture on positive and negative initiations to Americans, and <b>significant</b> <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> for culture on positive initiations to Hmong-Americans, males, and females. <b>Significant</b> <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> for sex were found for positive initiations made to Hmong-Americans, Americans, and males. Evidence demonstrating that young children's peer interactions are often segregated on the basis of culture and sex was found. Overall, frequency of initiatic,ns was greater within culture and sex than across culture and sex. The failure to find significant effects of culture or sex on negative initiations suggests that the lack of cross-cultural peer interactions is not motivated by hostile intentions. The lack of cross-cultural interactions is discussed in terms of peer familiarity and communication skills.

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether incorporating arm movement into bridge exercise changes the electromyographic (EMG) activity of selected trunk muscles. Twenty healthy young men were recruited for this study. EMG data were collected for the rectus abdominis (RA), internal oblique (IO), erector spinae (ES), and multifidus (MF) muscles of the dominant side. During bridging, an experimental procedure was performed with two options: an intervention factor (with and without arm movement) and a bridging factor (on the floor and on a therapeutic ball). There were <b>significant</b> <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> for the intervention factor in the IO and ES and for the bridging factor in the IO. The RA and IO showed significant interaction between the intervention and bridge factors. Furthermore, IO/RA ratio during bridging on the floor (without arm movement, 2. 05 ± 2. 61; with arm movement, 3. 24 ± 3. 42) and bridging on the ball (without arm movement: 2. 95 ± 3. 87; with arm movement: 5. 77 ± 4. 85) showed <b>significant</b> <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> for, and significant interaction between the intervention and bridge factors. However, no <b>significant</b> <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> or interaction were found for the MF/ES ratio. These findings suggest that integrating arm movements during bridge exercises may be used to provide preferential loading to certain trunk muscle groups and that these effects may be better derived by performing bridge exercises on a therapeutic ball...|$|E

I specifically sought to replicate past research that suggested early pubertal timing was associated with eating disordered outcomes; to examine the association between racial, ethnic, and adoption factors and eating disordered outcomes; and to test whether these latter associations were moderated by pubertal timing in two samples of adopted female Korean Americans. Early menarche significantly predicted body dissatisfaction, but only in the second study. In the first study there were <b>significant</b> <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> of both birth preoccupation and racial discomfort on two of the body image and ED symptom outcomes - binge eating and weight preoccupation.
