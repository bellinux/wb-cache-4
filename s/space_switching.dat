40|$|Optical <b>space</b> <b>switches</b> are {{important}} subsystems in optical crossconnects (OXCs) and reconfigurable optical add/drop multiplexers (R-OADMs), while also having applications in more long-term communications scenarios, such as optical packet switching. This chapter develops {{the theory of}} operation of planar optical <b>space</b> <b>switches,</b> and illustrates the interrelationship that exists between device characteristics, choice of architecture and <b>space</b> <b>switch</b> performance. The chapter also describes how switching elements {{from a variety of}} technologies can be combined into larger switch fabrics in different ways. Recent technological developments such as 3 D MEMS, covered elsewhere in this book, have radically changed the performance tradeoff landscape for very large, slow optical crossconnects typically having a reconfiguration time in the order of milliseconds. However, the original vision of interconnected waveguide-based switches still has relevance, especially for sub-nanosecond multiplexing and switching, including the emerging field of fast optical packet switching. Appropriate design can yield fabric performance significantly better than the individual switching elements can separately achieve. An optical <b>space</b> <b>switch</b> has multiple inputs and outputs, and can establish an optical connection between any idle input and any idle output, without involving conversion of the signal into electronic form. Similar systems, intended for purely electronic implementation, have been studied for over 50 years, and much of that work is amenable to optical implementation. Furthermore, the particular characteristics of optical switches (such as loss, crosstalk and problems of integration) have suggested a number of new architectures which are also discussed here. Besides describing the optical <b>space</b> <b>switches</b> and their implementation, the theory of their blocking performance is developed. (For further reading on theoretical results in switching, including additional topics such as Banyan networks and Baseline networks, see Reference [1]). Also, formulae are developed for optical loss, crosstalk and noise, which {{are important}} aspects of optical <b>space</b> <b>switch</b> performance. This survey is limited to architectures that have actually been built or fabricated, or are strong candidates for implementation in the future...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Although input-buffered <b>space</b> <b>switches</b> {{are more}} {{economical}} and simpler to implement pthan output-buffered <b>space</b> <b>switches,</b> they suffer from external blocking because of destination port contention. We review contention resolution {{methods used to}} avoid external blocking, and choose a solution based on ring reservation, resulting in an elegant and efficient mechanism requiring only nearest-neighbor communications. In addition to external blocking, <b>space</b> <b>switches</b> suffer from head-of-line (HOL) blocking, and our technique alleviates HOL blocking without arbitration time overhead. This method makes use of a novel content addressable first idfirst out (CAFIFO) to achieve single-cycle windowing, and the CAFIFO design and operation are described in detail. High multicast throughput is achieved by employing call-splitting. Multiple latency priorities can also be supported. Simulation results, for both unicast and multi-cast switching, and both random and bursty traffic, highlight the versatility and excellent performance of the CAFIFO-based switch. I...|$|R

50|$|Context {{switches}} {{are usually}} computationally intensive, {{and much of}} the design of operating systems is to optimize the use of context switches. Switching from one process to another requires {{a certain amount of time}} for doing the administration saving and loading registers and memory maps, updating various tables and lists, etc. What is actually involved in a context switch varies between these senses and between processors and operating systems. For example, in the Linux kernel, context switching involves switching registers, stack pointer, and program counter, but is independent of address <b>space</b> <b>switching,</b> though in a process switch an address space switch also happens. Further still, analogous context switching happens between user threads, notably green threads, and is often very light-weight, saving and restoring minimal context. In extreme cases, such as switching between goroutines in Go, a context switch is equivalent to a coroutine yield, which is only marginally more expensive than a subroutine call.|$|E

Lack of hardware support may not be an issue, however, for systems that choose to use language-based protection.|$|E

Connecting the two SSUs in parallel this way provided the doubling of network capacity required in a CLOS network. When the system grew beyond 32 TCUs, an additional 6 SSUs were added. Two of these SSUs connected to TCU32-TCU63 in a manner directly analogous to the first two SSUs. Two connected the inputs from TCU0-TCU31 to the output of TCU32-TCU63, while the final two connected the outputs of TCU32-TCU63 to the input of TCU0-TCU31.|$|R
