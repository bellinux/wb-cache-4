We reject the common wisdom that Germany is a country in statsis: stable cross-sectional distributions are deceptive, concealing substantial movements beneath the surface. The US and the UK underwent a process of income polarisation. For the study of mobility, <b>stochastic</b> <b>kernels</b> are used, because standard approaches based on mobility indices and transition matrices, which group persons into income classes of arbitrary size, lead to misleading conclusions. The measures attribute greater mobility to Germany than to the US, but this ranking is entirely driven by the substantially greater mobility of the German poor.

The cross-country distributions of a specialization index in all fields, but electronics, reveal no marked specialization profile for a good number of countries. The estimated <b>stochastic</b> <b>kernels</b> show persistence of within field countries' specialization levels around or below the mean, while high specialization levels revert towards lower values (with the exception, again, of electronics). This strengthens the case for absorptive capacity.

40|$|What {{happens to}} income {{distribution}} {{during the course}} of economic development? New higher quality international data show a marked pattern of inequality convergence, where inequality becomes more similar across countries as income levels rise. Inequality has tended to fall in high inequality countries as their economies grow, and inequality has tended to rise in low inequality countries. This is clear in linear regression trends, piecewise trends, and <b>stochastic</b> <b>kernel</b> estimation. The <b>stochastic</b> <b>kernel</b> estimation models the evolution of inequality in the income domain, rather than the more typical time domain, and allows for complex dynamics. The evidence of inequality convergence is confirmed in numerous robustness checks.

40|$|This paper {{suggests}} an empirical framework for analysing income distribution dynamics and cross-region convergence in the European Union of 27 member states, 1995 - 2003. The framework {{lies in the}} research tradition that allows the state income space to be continuous, puts emphasis on both shape and intra-distribution dynamics and uses <b>stochastic</b> <b>kernels</b> for studying transition dynamics and implied long-run behaviour. In this paper <b>stochastic</b> <b>kernels</b> are described by conditional density functions, estimated by a product kernel estimator of conditional density and represented by means of novel visualisation tools. The technique of spatial filtering is used to account for spatial effects, {{in order to avoid}} misguided inferences and interpretations caused by the presence of spatial autocorrelation in the income distributions. The results reveal a slow catching-up of the poorest regions and a process of polarisation, {{with a small group of}} very rich regions shifting away from the rest of the cross-section. This is well evidenced by both, the unfiltered and the filtered ergodic density view. Differences exist in detail, and these emphasise the importance to properly deal with the spatial autocorrelation problem. (authors' abstract...|$|R
40|$|Studies about {{convergence}} in Brazil {{have concentrated}} in the ß and (-convergence analysis. In this thesis is presented a new methodolgy to study convergence, that analyses how the income distribution among brazilian states and municipalities evolves over the time. Three kinds of estimation are done: a) kernel smoothed densities are estimated to allow the visualization of the changes occurred over {{the time in the}} distributon as a whole, while ß and (-convergence estimate only one parameter of this distribution; b) estimation of <b>stochastic</b> <b>kernels</b> to analyse the movements of the economies over the income space with the aim to identify convergence clubs in specific space intervals; c) estimation of <b>stochastic</b> <b>kernels</b> conditional on geographic localization, education, openness to international trade and income inequality, with the objective to identify possible explanations to the observed pattern of convergence. The use of the methodologies above allowed to identify that, although there is a convergence trend among brazilian municipalities in the period from 1970 to 2000, coexists with this trend a divergent movement that is leading to the formation of two convergence clubs among brazilian municipalities. Geographic localization and initial level of education appeared as important conditioners of the observed growth. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the process of}} real economic convergence in the New Member States, by using non-parametric methods, e. g. the ash-warping test, kernel density estimation and <b>stochastic</b> <b>kernel.</b> The main findings of the paper are the bimodality of income density distribution over time and across countries, the lack of convergence at a single point in time {{and the presence of}} convergence clubs in the income distribution from 1995 to 2008. They suggest the lack of absolute convergence on long term (1995 - 2008), and also when looking only from 2003 onwards.

A new composite index of development (CIRD) is developed to capture the five main dimensions of regional development: macroeconomic conditions, science and innovation performance, environmental sustainability, human capital accumulation, and public facilities provision.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{shows how}} {{to obtain a}} binary change map from {{similarity}} measures of the local statistics of images before and after a disaster. The decision process is achieved {{by the use of}} a ν-SVM in which a <b>stochastic</b> <b>kernel</b> has been defined. <b>Stochastic</b> <b>kernel</b> includes two similarity measures, based on the local statistics, to detect changes from the images: 1) A distance between maginal probability density functions (pdfs) and 2) the mutual information between the two observations. Distance between marginal pdfs is evaluated by using a series expansion of the Kullbak-Leibler distance. It is achieved by estimating cumulants up to order 4 from a sliding window of fixed size. Mutual information is estimated through a parametric model that is issued from the copulas theory. It is based on rank statistics and yields an analytic expression, that depends on the parameter of the copula only, to be evaluated to obtain the mutual information. Preliminary results are shown on a pair of Radarsat images acquire before and after a lava flow. A ground truth allows to show the accuracy of the stochastic kernels and the SVM decision. I...|$|E

The results achieved have, first, underlined the complexity of the competitive scenario summarized in four different profiles: non competitive regions; strongly competitive and innovative regions; competitive regions with diversification and production sustainability; and strongly dependent on the CAP direct support. They affect in a different way convergence. The process seems to be determined by the specific factors at {{the basis of}} agricultural competitiveness within which innovation seems to be the most relevant. On the contrary, persistence prevails across the regions with a relative high dependence on the CAP subsidies. The evidences suggest the need of an agricultural enterprise policy aimed at establishing an environment conductive to farms growth and innovation and designed according to the specific territorial features. This is where the interventions of Regions and Member States come in and the reinforcement of their competitive capacity becomes a pre-condition and an indispensable component of a comprehensive strategy aimed at developing agricultural competitiveness and convergence in the EU regions. agricultural convergence, agricultural competitiveness, <b>stochastic</b> <b>kernel</b> approach, Kohonen Self-Organizing Maps., International Relations/Trade,...|$|E
