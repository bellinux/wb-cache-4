5|$|Four two storey residences, Numbers 8, 10, 16 and 18 The Terrace, {{were built}} during the 1850s for officer accommodation. Number 8, {{also known as}} the Chaplain's House, is a two storey house with {{rendered}} and painted limestone walls. The plan is roughly square with verandahs and balconies along the west and south sides. A single <b>storey</b> <b>building</b> connects the south-east side of the house to the main prison wall.|$|E

Number 18, {{also known as the}} Surgeon's House, is a two storey structure with limestone walls. It is the southernmost house on The Terrace. Numbers 18 and 8, the northernmost of the initial buildings, both featured two sitting rooms, three bedrooms, and two dressing rooms, as well as a kitchen, water closet and shed, but with mirrored layouts. Number 18 was expanded with additions built in the 1890s. A single storey limestone structure (former stables) is located to the south of Number 18.|$|E

40|$|The Open Ground <b>Storey</b> <b>buildings</b> {{are very}} {{commonly}} found in India due to provision for very much needed parking space in urban areas. However, seismic performance {{of this type of}} buildings is found to be consistently poor as demonstrated by the past earthquakes. Some of the literatures indicate that use of shear walls may enhance the performance of this kind of buildings without obstructing the free movement of vehicles in the parking lot. The present study is an attempt in this direction to study the performance of Open Ground <b>Storey</b> <b>buildings</b> strengthened with shear walls in a bay or two. In addition to that, the study considers a different scenarios of Open Ground <b>storey</b> <b>buildings</b> strengthened by applying various schemes of multiplication factors in line with the approach proposed by IS 1893 (2002) for the comparison purpose. Study shows that the shear walls significantly increases the base shear capacity of OGS buildings however the comparative cost is slightly on the higher side...|$|R
25|$|Kitzbühel {{became part}} of Upper Bavaria in 1255 when Bavaria was first partitioned. Duke Ludwig II of Bavaria granted Kitzbühel town rights on 6 June 1271, and it was {{fortified}} with defensive town walls.

Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus were found breeding in HT, KK and KB; while only Ae. albopictus was obtained from UM.

25|$|The Hough House was {{originally}} constructed in late nineteenth century, but {{has since been}} restored as a Colonial Revival style building. The structure emanates exuberance through its quality craftsmanship that showcases exquisite masonry work and wood detailing. The wood shingle roof, stone accents, facades, and Palladian style windows makes the Hough House the most stylish structure within the fort. The two-and-a-half <b>storey</b> <b>building</b> sits elegantly amongst the earthworks, creating an environment that resembles that of a countryside manor. The Hough House {{is perhaps the most}} visited site of Fort Malden, largely due to its attractive design, and more importantly the fact that it plays host to a large number of records and archives pertaining to the history of the fort itself.|$|E
25|$|The early {{earthworks}} of Crawford Castle {{comprise a}} motte around 5m high, with a surrounding ditch and a bailey some 45m by 33m to the south-west. On the motte are {{the remains of}} a curtain wall, surrounding an enclosure around 20m square. There may have been round towers at the corners of this enclosure, which probably dates to the 16th or early 17th centuries. A range of buildings on the south-west side of the castle were built at around the same time. This tower-like range was of three storeys, plus an attic, with a vaulted basement and projecting chimney-breast. To the south-east, a second range was added later in the 17th century, providing more spacious accommodation with larger windows. The prominent arched recess in the east wall suggests that a single <b>storey</b> <b>building</b> of some kind projected from the main structure at this location. Much of the present remains probably date from the 17th century rebuilding by the Marquess of Douglas.|$|E

500|$|St Leonard's Tower is a {{probable}} Norman keep in West Malling, {{in the county}} of Kent, England. The tower was probably built by Gundulf, the Bishop of Rochester, between 1077 and 1108. It was a three <b>storey</b> <b>building,</b> constructed of local stone, and would have stood at least [...] high. At a later point, probably during the English Civil War, the tower was deliberately damaged to prevent it being used for military purposes, and its uppermost storey was demolished. Concerns grew about the tower's condition in the 20th century and in 1937 it was taken into the guardianship of the state. In the 21st century, it is managed by English Heritage and the exterior is open to visitors.|$|E
