5000|$|By the 1950s the T vans were {{starting}} to wear out, so a new fleet of 50 aluminium-constructed vans were added, numbered 420 through 469. These had angled roofs and a capacity of 15+1/2 LT, with room for up to 8 LT of crush ice and walls 6.0625 in thick, insulated with [...] "Onazate". They were initially noticeable in consists because they not painted above the underframes (which were in VR wagon red), although by the mid-1960s they were painted all over in wagon red. Van 422 was of a different design to the other 49 wagons in this batch, with thinner walls and internal bracing to compensate; {{this could have been}} a trial or caused by material shortages. At some point, van 421 had its doors made wider <b>for</b> <b>palletisation,</b> although it is not know whether this was from new or a later modification.|$|R
40|$|Purpose - {{this paper}} {{presents}} an investigation {{on the development of}} different pattern placement strategies in robotic palletisation of box packages in the packaging industry with practical implementations for one, two, four and five block patterns with the aim of improving the operational efficiency in robotic palletisation. Design/methodology/approach - The work involves considering the gripper design and maximum number of picks and various process parameters that affect the robotic implementation of pallet patterns and develops a methodology to form different patterns for a given pallet size. Findings - The proposed methodology represents an efficient approach for pallet pattern implementation and results in reduced number of placements required for a given number of boxes per layer and reduced time <b>for</b> <b>palletisation.</b> Originality/value - The paper introduces a novel technique for pallet loading problem (PLP) considering the physical aspects and restrictions encountered when using the robot and the gripper size to generate the pattern on the pallet. Traditional solutions of PLP do not consider these aspects in pattern placements...|$|R
