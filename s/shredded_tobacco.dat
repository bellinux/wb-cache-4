The processing of brightleaf and burley tobaccos for tobacco leaf [...] "strips" [...] produces several byproducts such as leaf stems, tobacco dust, and tobacco leaf pieces ("small laminate").

The production line of Iwaya Shokai went to the Tokyo First Tobacco Production Place, {{and in the same}} year, Imperial tobacco began to be produced not only exclusively for noblemen, such as Emperor Taisho and his relatives, but also for its original purposes. Imperial tobacco was made from special leaves of tobacco, while the Special tobacco for noblemen and gifts was made from the finest Fuji leaf or 不二; these were also produced with the utmost care manually. Emperor Taisho was a smoker and smoked his exclusively produced cigarettes, while Hirohito did not; the production of Imperial tobacco, however, continued. The production of special tobacco for the relatives of the Emperor Hirohito was discontinued by the order of the General Headquarters of Japan of the allied forces in 1945. However, Onshino Tobako as gifts continued to be produced.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} types of {{smokeless}} tobacco. Chewing <b>tobacco</b> is <b>shredded,</b> air-cured <b>tobacco</b> with flavoring. Dipping tobacco ("moist snuff") is air or fire-cured, finely cut tobacco. Dry snuff is ground or pulverised tobacco leaves. In the Indian subcontinent, the Middle-East and South-East Asia, tobacco may be combined in a quid or paan with other ingredients such as betel leaf, Areca nut and slaked lime. Use of Areca nut is associated with oral submucous fibrosis. An appearance termed Betel chewer's mucosa describes morsicatio buccarum with red-staining of mucosa due to betel quid ingredients. In Scandinavian countries, snus, a variant of dry snuff, is sometimes used. In the United States of America, {{the most common form}} of smokeless tobacco is dipping tobacco, although chewing tobacco is sometimes used by outdoor workers and dry snuff is common among females in the Southern states. The overall prevalence of smokeless tobacco use in the USA is about 4.5%, but this is higher in Mid-Western and Southern states.|$|R

40|$|The {{combustion}} {{mechanism of}} a <b>shredded</b> <b>tobacco</b> bed during puffing has been investigated. To evaluate {{changes in the}} burning rate of the <b>shredded</b> <b>tobacco</b> bed in the region close to the paper char-line, an experimental study was carried out on the reverse combustion of the <b>shredded</b> <b>tobacco</b> bed packed in a furnace. Measurements of {{the temperature in the}} <b>shredded</b> <b>tobacco</b> bed were conducted to calculate the combustion propagation rate. The combustion propagation rate decreased with an increase in the tobacco shred width, the tobacco packing density, and with a decrease in the air flow velocity. To investigate differences in the combustion propagation rate, the oxygen transfer coefficient of the <b>shredded</b> <b>tobacco</b> bed was evaluated using the effective diameter of the tobacco shred and the effective surface area of the <b>shredded</b> <b>tobacco</b> bed. The combustion propagation rate of the <b>shredded</b> <b>tobacco</b> bed increased with the oxygen transfer coefficient of the <b>shredded</b> <b>tobacco</b> bed.

40|$|SummarySmokeless tobacco (snuff) is {{a finely}} ground or <b>shredded</b> <b>tobacco</b> that is sniffed {{through the nose}} or placed between the cheek and gum. Chewing tobacco is used by putting a wad of tobacco inside the cheek. Smokeless tobacco is widely used by young athletes to enhance {{performance}} because nicotine improves some aspects of physiology. However, smokeless tobacco has harmful health effects, including cardiovascular disorders, linked to nicotine physiological effects, mainly through catecholamine release. Nicotine decreases heart rate variability and the ventricular fibrillation threshold, and promotes the occurrence of various arrhythmias; it also impairs endothelial-dependent vasodilation and could therefore promote premature atherogenesis. At rest, heart rate, blood pressure, inotropism, cardiac output and myocardial oxygen consumption are increased by nicotine, leading to an imbalance between myocardial oxygen demand and supply. The same occurs at submaximal levels of exercise. These increases are accompanied by a rise in systemic resistances. At maximal exercise, heart rate, cardiac output and maximal oxygen uptake (V˙O 2 max) are unaffected by nicotine. Because endothelial dysfunction is promoted by nicotine, paradoxical coronary vasoconstriction may occur during exercise and recovery. Nicotine induces a decrease in muscular strength and impairs anaerobic performance. However, nicotine is used in sports as it diminishes anxiety, enhances concentration and agility, improves aerobic performance and favours weight control. Importantly, smokeless tobacco, similar to cigarette smoking, leads to nicotine dependence through dopaminergic pathways. Smokeless tobacco has harmful cardiovascular effects and is addictive: it fulfils all the criteria {{for inclusion in the}} World Anti-Doping Agency prohibited list as a doping product. Smokeless tobacco use in sporting activities must be discouraged...|$|E
60|$|So bitter {{was it in}} {{the boat}} that our water and beer froze solid, {{and it was a}} {{difficult}} task justly to apportion the pieces I broke off with Northrup's claspknife. These pieces we put in our mouths and sucked till they melted. Also, on occasion of snow-squalls, we had all the snow we desired. All of which was not good for us, causing a fever of inflammation to attack our mouths so that the membranes were continually dry and burning. And there was no allaying a thirst so generated. To suck more ice or snow was merely to aggravate the inflammation. More than anything else, I think it was this that caused the death of Lish Dickery. He was out of his head and raving for twenty-four hours before he died. He died babbling for water, and yet he did not die for need of water.

The last man, however, led a horse, which carried nothing at all, and the leader, who had just pulled his beast up, was holding up his hand. It was evident to Shyanne that they had seen his tracks in the snow, but, as that was a peaceful country, he failed to understand why it should have brought the party to a standstill. He, however, stayed where he was, watching the leader, who stooped in his saddle.|$|R
5000|$|Dipping {{tobacco is}} a type of finely ground or <b>shredded,</b> {{moistened}} smokeless <b>tobacco</b> product. It is commonly and idiomatically known by various terms—most often as dip and sometimes as rub. It is used by placing a lump, pinch, or [...] "dip" [...] of tobacco between the lip and the gum.

40|$|A modern {{infrared}} camera {{was used to}} observe the peripheral burning of cigarettes during puffing and smouldering. The computer-controlled infrared system captured thermal images with recording rates up to 50 Hz at 8 -bit (256 -colour) resolution. The response time was less than 0. 04 s at ca. 780 °C. The overall performance of the system was superior to most infrared systems used in previously reported investigations. The combined capacity allowed us to capture some faster, smaller high-temperature burning events {{on the periphery of}} a cigarette during puffing, which was first described by Egertion et al. in 1963 using an X-ray method. These transient burning events were caused by <b>tobacco</b> <b>shreds</b> near the coal surface experiencing the maximum air influx. The temperature of these transient burning events could be ca. 200 to 250 °C higher than the average peripheral temperature of the cigarette. The likelihood of these high-temperature burning events occurring during smouldering was significantly less. Some other details of the cigarette's combustion were also observed with improved simplicity and clarity...|$|R

In this paper, the defects of the original control system for <b>tobacco</b> <b>shred</b> production line are analyzed, and the new design plan of control system based on EtherNet/IP is presented. The control net adopts redundant 1000 M fiber optic ring network that consists of six managed Industrial Ethernet Switches, and they are distributed to the central control room, leaf processing line, shred processing line, mixed stem shred processing line, online mositure regain processing line and cut tobacco dryer control cabinet.
