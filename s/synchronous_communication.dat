25|$|The {{simplest}} interesting case is an n-cycle. Richard Cole and Uzi Vishkin {{show that}} there is a distributed algorithm that reduces the number of colors from n to O(logn) in one <b>synchronous</b> <b>communication</b> step. By iterating the same procedure, it is possible to obtain a 3-coloring of an n-cycle in O(n) communication steps (assuming that we have unique node identifiers).|$|E
25|$|In the {{analysis}} of distributed algorithms, more attention is usually paid on communication operations than computational steps. Perhaps the simplest model of distributed computing is a synchronous system where all nodes operate in a lockstep fashion. During each communication round, all nodes in parallel (1)receive the latest messages from their neighbours, (2)perform arbitrary local computation, and (3)send new messages to their neighbors. In such systems, a central complexity measure {{is the number of}} <b>synchronous</b> <b>communication</b> rounds required to complete the task.|$|E

50|$|There is {{also another}} {{possible}} approach {{in which a}} system provides both forms of communication in the same environment to allow more flexibility in communication.

50|$|<b>Synchronous</b> <b>communication</b> can be {{built on}} top of {{asynchronous}} communication by using a Synchronizer.For example, the α-Synchronizer works by ensuring that the sender always waits for an acknowledgement message from the receiver.The sender only sends the next message after the acknowledgement has been received.

The following five overarching themes were identified and used to understand learners’ experiences with and perceptions of <b>synchronous</b> and asynchronous <b>communication</b> technology in a graduate distance education course: 1) community building; 2) easing the cost of communicating online, 3) creating a sense of real class and dialogue, 4) instilling a trust in the technology’s reliability, and 5) capturing and preserving knowledge...|$|R

40|$|The {{interest}} in on line education has attracted many researchers in many fields. This research was {{also interested in}} discovering the possibilities of online education among Saudi female university students. <b>Synchronous</b> computer-mediated <b>communication</b> is considered to increase participation, balance participation and provide an anxiety-free context for learners. This study was interested in examining the effects of <b>synchronous</b> computer-mediated <b>communication</b> in a Saudi context. The study's main aim was to investigate what happens when Saudi female students who are reluctant to use the English language for communication are asked to communicate with other students through written discussions {{in the context of}} CMC. The total number of participants in this study consisted of 58 students. The investigation included two groups of first year Medicine and Medical Sciences students; each group was further divided into 5 Medicine and 5 Medical Sciences groups. Students were involved in five <b>synchronous</b> computer-mediated <b>communication</b> activities. This research used a mixed methods approach which included both quantitative and qualitative data. The data included student written electronic discussion transcripts, written pre and post questionnaires, and interviews with the students. The findings in this study reveal that the <b>synchronous</b> computer-mediated <b>communication</b> context was one that fostered student participation. The results of this study were encouraging as they revealed that all the participants participated in the discussions. However, as everyone participated, the quantitative data showed that participation was unbalanced. Additional results showed that Saudi female language learners were able to sustain a forty minute electronic discussion mostly in English; although the language that they used was simple language based on the type-token ratio and students' accounts.
