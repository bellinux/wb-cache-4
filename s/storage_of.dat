40|$|To {{investigate}} the effects <b>of</b> nanoparticle content, <b>storage</b> time, and storage temperature on the <b>storage</b> stability <b>of</b> asphalt binders modified by nanoparticles, hot tube storage tests, softening point tests, and dynamic-shearing rheometer (DSR) tests were adopted {{to evaluate the}} properties of two kinds of nanotitanium dioxide (TiO 2) modified asphalt binders. A statistical {{one-way analysis of variance}} (ANOVA) test was employed to analyze the effects of those variations on the <b>storage</b> stability <b>of</b> the nano-TiO 2 modified asphalt binders. The results indicated that the softening point, the failure temperature, the dynamic-shear viscosity, and G⁎/sinδ of the binders increased with nanoparticle content. The <b>storage</b> stability <b>of</b> the binders decreased with nanoparticle content. The impact <b>of</b> <b>storage</b> time on the <b>storage</b> stability <b>of</b> the binders was remarkable when the storage time was more than 48 [*]h. Moreover, the <b>storage</b> stability <b>of</b> the binders at low temperatures was better than that at high temperatures. Based on the one-way ANOVA, the size of nanoparticle had little influence on the <b>storage</b> stability <b>of</b> the nano-TiO 2 modified asphalt binders in this study. Reducing the nanoparticle size cannot effectively enhance the <b>storage</b> stability <b>of</b> the nanoparticle modified asphalt binder due to the agglomeration of nanoparticle...|$|R
40|$|<b>Storage</b> {{capacity}} <b>of</b> RAM-based {{systems can}} be assessed in a modular fashion [1, 2, 3]. In such approach the <b>storage</b> capacity <b>of</b> a network is a function <b>of</b> the <b>storage</b> capacity <b>of</b> its component neurons. The original probabilistic model for assessment <b>of</b> <b>storage</b> capacity <b>of</b> the single neuron [1] was based on conceptual approximations. This paper presents the formal derivation <b>of</b> the <b>storage</b> capacity <b>of</b> the single neuron starting from the definition of appropriate sample space and random variables. The formal model involves a computationally expensive summation and is approximated for cost reduction. The approximation is shown to be very precise with error bound decreasing exponentially with the fan-in of the neuron. Comparison at the architecture level shows that the model fits strikingly with real data from experiments in GNU networks [4].

Chinese voluntary associations such as Pek San Theng were allowed to build columbaria to house the remains of those exhumed from clan-owned cemeteries, and temples and churches were allowed to accommodate cremated remains.

The sickness and eventual death of president Juan Vicente Gómez in 1935 led to the abandonment of the castle by the troops. Later in 1955, and due to a local initiative, the castle achieved the status of War Museum. It was declared as a National Monument in 1965 by president Raúl Leoni.|$|E

5|$|Birds need {{to alter}} their {{metabolism}} {{to meet the demands}} of migration. The <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> energy through the accumulation of fat and the control of sleep in nocturnal migrants require special physiological adaptations. In addition, the feathers of a bird suffer from wear-and-tear and require to be moulted. The timing of this moult – usually once a year but sometimes twice – varies with some species moulting prior to moving to their winter grounds and others molting prior to returning to their breeding grounds. Apart from physiological adaptations, migration sometimes requires behavioural changes such as flying in flocks to reduce the energy used in migration or the risk of predation.|$|E

This suggests that interesting material, even if tangential to the topic, does not detract from learning and can promote recall of vague or uninteresting material.|$|E
