MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten volunteers underwent DW-MRI imaging of the kidneys with a breath-hold single-shot spin-echo planar imaging (SE-EPI) sequence in the axial and coronal planes with b values of 300, 500, 800 s/mm(2), in different <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>hydration.</b> Urine osmolarity (OsmU) and sodium excretion (NaU) were measured {{at the time of}} each examination.

In this work, we construct a solvent fluid dielectric boundary {{model for the}} solvation of charged molecules {{and apply it to}} study the stability of a model cylindrical solute-solvent interface. The motion of the solute-solvent interface is defined to be {{the same as that of}} solvent fluid at the interface. The solvent fluid is as-sumed to be incompressible and is described by the Stokes equation. The solute is modeled simply by the ideal-gas law. The viscous force, hydrostatic pressure, solute-solvent van der Waals interaction, surface tension, and electrostatic force are all balanced at the solute-solvent interface. We model the electrostatics by Poissonâs equation in which the solute-solvent interface is treated as a dielectric boundary that separates the low-dielectric solute from the high-dielectric solvent. For a cylindrical geometry, we find multiple cylindrically shaped equilibrium interfaces that describe polymodal (e. g., dry and wet) <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>hydration</b> <b>of</b> an underlying molecular system. These steady-state solutions exhibit bifurcation behavior with respect to the charge density. For their linearized systems, we use the projection method to solve the fluid equation and find the dispersion relation. Our asymptotic analysis shows that, for large wavenumbers, the decay rate is proportional to the wavenumber whose proportionality is half of the ratio of surface tension to solvent viscosity, indicating that the solvent viscosity does affect the stability of a solute-solvent interface. Consequences of our analysis in the context of biomolecular interactions are discussed...|$|R

Medullary hyaluronan content changes depending on the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> body <b>hydration</b> and plays a part in fluid regulation through its water binding and viscoelastic properties. The aim of this thesis was to provide new insight into the regulation of intrarenal hyaluronan during different <b>states</b> <b>of</b> body <b>hydration,</b> during completion <b>of</b> kidney development, and during diabetes mellitus. Dehydration reduces medullary interstitial hyaluronan in parallel with reduced hyaluronan synthase 2 gene expression and increased urinary hyaluronidase activity. Acute hydration results {{in an increase in}} medullary hyaluronan, an increase that requires nitric oxide and prostaglandins. Urinary hyaluronidase activity decreases during <b>hydration.</b> The elevation <b>of</b> hyaluronan is important for reducing water permeability of the interstitium i. e. favoring diuresis. Changes in hyaluronan concentration constitute a morphoregulatory pathway that {{plays a key role in}} nephrogenesis. The reduction in neonatal hyaluronan depended on an angiotensin II mediated process that does not appear dependent on lymph vessel formation. If angiotensin II is blocked with an ACE inhibitor, hyaluronan accumulates, which results in structural and functional abnormalities in the kidney. Renomedullary hyaluronan is elevated during uncontrolled diabetes, which coincides with induction of hyaluronan synthase 2 mRNA, hyperglycemia, glucosuria, proteinuria and overt diuresis. The levels of hyaluronan are probably at a terminus ad quem as no further response was seen during hydration.
