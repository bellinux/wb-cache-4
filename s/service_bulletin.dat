2500|$|In a {{press conference}} on 3 May, the AIBN stated that the initial {{investigation}} and analysis of data from the combined FDR and CVR convinced them that pilot error could be ruled out {{and that there were}} no indications of any malfunction until one second {{before the end of the}} recording, which they assumed was the moment when the rotor detached. An AIBN spokesman said the accident was down to a technical fault and [...] "not an accident caused by human error". Later that day Airbus Helicopters updated their press release bulletin with a request for verification of the correct installation of all main gearbox suspension bar attachments for the EC225LP.

2500|$|Carburetion {{had five}} {{separate}} circuits. Suzuki used peripheral ports for the RE5, as they give better high-speed running but {{are known to}} have low-speed issues. This is dealt with by using a two-stage Mikuni carburetor. An 18mm throat splits into two small peripheral induction tracts. The primary butterfly is directly controlled by one of the five throttle cables, providing smooth low-speed running. A diaphragm controls the secondary carburetor port, and this is activated when a set vacuum is reached in the carburetor circuit. This much larger 32mm port enters the rotor chamber between and slightly below the two small primary ports. Indirectly involved with carburetion is the unique [...] "port valve". This small butterfly valve pivots in the rotor housing inside the secondary port and is directly controlled by another of the throttle cables. Without the port valve, the long induction tract of the secondary port would fill with traces of exhaust gasses whenever the secondary valve was closed. This occurs as the tip of the rotor passes the induction port {{at the end of the}} exhaust cycle before beginning the induction cycle. If this was allowed to happen, when the secondary throat finally opened the engine would first swallow an induction charge contaminated with exhaust gasses causing a momentary misfire and felt as a dead spot or hesitation in acceleration. The port valve is therefore effectively timed to remain closed whenever the secondary carburetor throat is closed, isolating the induction tract from exhaust gasses. Carburetor tuning involves adjusting cables controlling the primary butterfly and the port valve, among other things, illustrated by Suzuki <b>Service</b> <b>Bulletin</b> Nine. The carburetor also incorporated a fuel pump which was mechanically actuated at 35 degrees of primary butterfly movemement (later changed to 28 degrees) to enrich the fuel mixture during acceleration.|$|E
