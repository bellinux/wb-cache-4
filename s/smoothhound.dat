50|$|Fishing is also {{extremely}} popular in Newport Bay, {{off the coast}} of Newport, and along the Newport Bay Jetty. In the bay there are multiple locations to purchase bait for dockside or spear fishing convenience. There are about 80 fishable species located in Newport Bay. A few of the most commonly fished species are: Gray <b>Smoothhound</b> Shark, Leopard Shark, Round Stingray, Shovelnose Guitarfish, Pacific Staghorn Sculpin, Silvery Mullet, Top-smelt, California Halibut, Spotted Sand Bass, Yellowfin Croaker, Bat Ray, Thornback Ray, Diamond Turbot, Shiner Surfperch, Corbina, Opaleye, Pile Surfperch, and Red Shiner. Commercial fishing is also prominent in offshore Newport Beach and Newport Bay. One such sea creature commercially fished in the reefs in this area is lobster.

40|$|During July-September 1993 and May 1996, {{a survey}} of the {{metazoan}} parasites of 817 elasmobranchs from the Gulf of California, representing 42 species, was conducted at 14 sites along the western portion of the Gulf of California. Elasmobranchs were obtained from local commercial fishers. In this paper, we report all digeneans collected during the survey, excluding the gorgoderids, which will be presented in a subsequent paper. Four species from three hemiuroid families were collected, none of which was known previously from the Gulf of California. Syncoelium vermilionensis sp. n. (Syncoeliidae), a species that differs most notably from its congeners by having more testes, is described from the gills and gill arches of Mobula thurstoni and M. japonica. Paronatrema vaginicola (Syncoeliidae) is reported from the cloaca, gill arches, and buccal cavity of Prionace glauca (blue shark) and Alopias pelagicus (pelagic thresher shark). These hosts represent new host records for the species, {{and this is the first}} record of the parasite from the eastern Pacific Ocean. Observations of uterine morphology in S. vermilionensis and P. vaginicola along with published descriptions of other species in Syncoeliidae indicate that all members of this family obtain a diagnostically thick outer shell of their eggs within a thick-walled section of the uterus rather than in the ootype, as in other digenean groups. Otodistomum veliporum (Azygiidae) is reported from the stomach of Squatina californica (angel shark), from the body cavity of Mustelus helei (brown <b>smoothhound),</b> and from the stomach of two species of horn sharks (Heterodontus francisci and H. mexicanus). Mustelus henlei, H. francisci, and H. mexicanus are new hosts for the parasite. Ptychogonimus megastoma (Ptychogonimidae) is reported from the stomach of Mustelus lunulatus (sicklefin <b>smoothhound)</b> and M. californicus (gray <b>smoothhound).</b> Both are new hosts for the parasite, and this is the first report of the parasite from the eastern Pacific Ocean...|$|E

40|$|The vital {{parameter}} {{data for}} 62 stocks, covering 38 species, {{collected from the}} literature, including parameters of age, growth, and reproduction, were log-transformed and analyzed using multivariate analyses. Three groups were identified and empirical equations were developed for each to describe {{the relationships between the}} predicted finite rates of population increase (λ') and the vital parameters, maximum age (Tmax), age at maturity (Tm), annual fecundity (f/Rc)), size at birth (Lb), size at maturity (Lm), and asymptotic length (L∞). Group (1) included species with slow growth rates (0. 034 yr(- 1) < k < 0. 103 yr(- 1)) and extended longevity (26 yr < Tmax < 81 yr), e. g., shortfin mako Isurus oxyrinchus, dusky shark Carcharhinus obscurus, etc.; Group (2) included species with fast growth rates (0. 103 yr(- 1) < k < 0. 358 yr(- 1)) and short longevity (9 yr < Tmax < 26 yr), e. g., starspotted <b>smoothhound</b> Mustelus manazo, gray <b>smoothhound</b> M. californicus, etc.; Group (3) included late maturing species (Lm/L∞ ≧ 0. 75) with moderate longevity (Tmax < 29 yr), e. g., pelagic thresher Alopias pelagicus, sevengill shark Notorynchus cepedianus. The empirical equation for all data pooled was also developed. The λ' values estimated by these empirical equations showed good agreement with those calculated using conventional demographic analysis. The predictability was further validated by an independent data set of three species. The empirical equations developed in this study not only reduce the uncertainties in estimation but also account for the difference in life history among groups. This method therefore provides an efficient and effective approach to the implementation of precautionary shark management measures...|$|E

This spermatozoon presents five regions characterized by several ultrastructural elements: an apical cone, a crested body, two axonemes of 9 +  1  pattern, electron-dense granules, a nucleus and cortical microtubules. In the present study, {{three of these}} features were {{the subject of a}} detailed attention. The first is the presence of two axonemes, which confirms that the Tetraphyllidea, Oncobothriidae possess two axonemes whereas the Tetraphyllidea, Phyllobothriidae possess only one axoneme.

40|$|The hyoid arch is {{critical}} in expanding the oral cavity during feeding and ventilation in fishes. The elements of the hyoid arch vary widely in morphology among fish taxa. The hyoid arch is medial to the jaws and {{is made up of}} paired hyomandibular cartilages (HY) dorsally, paired ceratohyal cartilages (CH) ventral to the HY, and a single, medial basihyal cartilage (BH) that interconnects the two sides. As the jaws open, the CH-BH complex is depressed expanding the floor of the oral cavity. The coracohyoideus muscle pulls the BH ventroposteriorly, which in turn swings the CH ventroposteriorly. As the coracohyoideus muscle depresses the BH, the CH experiences substantial bending forces. Because of their critical role in the feeding mechanism, the various shapes of the hyomandibular cartilages among species are likely adapted for different feeding behaviors. The hyoid arch of suction feeders experiences larger forces during rapid hyoid depression and are expected to have robust hyoid elements to withstand muscular forces and strong intraoral negative pressure generated during suction. Bite feeders are expected to have relatively more gracile elements, since strong, rapid jaw adduction that does not involve the hyoid arch is more critical to prey capture. The goal of this project was to test for possible form-function relationships among four shark species with different feeding styles. Shape differences were analyzed using 2 D geometric morphometrics in white-spotted bamboo sharks (Chiloscyllium plagiosum, suction feeder), sandbar sharks (Carcharhinus plumbeus, bite feeder), dusky <b>smoothhound</b> sharks (Mustelus canis, bite feeder), and spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias, bite and suction feeder) to quantify the relationship between the morphology of the hyomandibular cartilage and the feeding mechanism. Landmarks and semilandmarks were digitized on images of the HY. Principal components analysis and canonical variate analysis were applied to distinguish the shapes of elements and to determine changes among different species. While dogfish, which uses both suction and bite to feed, have the most robust HY, bamboo sharks, which only use suction to feed, have the most gracile HY. Bamboo and <b>smoothhound</b> sharks are similar in having a process near the each end of the HY on the posterior/anterior side. The HY of sandbar sharks has a convex curve that bulges outward, while the HY of the other species are relatively straight. Thus, the morphology of the HY does not correspond to feeding style in these four species as expected, but rather may be associated with three-dimensional movements of the hyoid arch during feeding...|$|E

40|$|Ultrasonic {{telemetry}} {{was used}} to analyze the effects of environmental variables on movement directions and movement rates of brown <b>smoothhounds,</b> Mustelus henlei, in Tomales Bay, California. Ultrasonic transmitters were surgically implanted in the peritoneal cavities of one male and five female brown <b>smoothhounds</b> and tracked during the period of 29 June to 15 July 2004. Coarse-scale tracking consisted of locating all tagged individuals multiple times during a single session, while fine-scale tracking consisted of following a single individual continuously during a session. Coarse-scale tracking suggested movement toward the inner bay with incoming and high tides and toward the outer bay with outgoing and low tides (P = 0. 01), whereas the diel cycle had no apparent effect on their movement directions. Mean shark movement rate was 0. 09  m s− 1 (range: 0. 01 – 0. 34  m s− 1), with diel and tidal cycles both having significant effects on their rates of movement (P = 0. 02 and P[*]<[*] 0. 01), respectively. We tracked two female sharks on a fine scale over three tracking sessions in July 2004. Both individuals exhibited higher rates of movement during the night compared to the day (P[*]<[*] 0. 01).

40|$|Two {{new species}} of Calicotyle (Monocotylidae: Calicotylinae) are {{described}} from elasmobranchs in the western Gulf of California. Calicotyle californiensis n. sp. is described from a single specimen collected from a gray <b>smoothhound</b> shark (Mustelus californicus, Carcharhiniformes: Triakidae). It is distinguished from its congeners by the combination of having vaginal pores opening within the intercecal space, distal regions of the vaginae twisting, proximal regions of the vaginae fusing medially to form a kidney bean-shaped structure, and a relatively long male copulatory organ recurving three times and passing between the distal penis bulb and the seminal vesicle. Calicotyle urobati n. sp. is described from 16 specimens collected from at least the cloaca and rectum of the round rays Urobatis halleri and Urobatis maculatus (Rajiformes: Urolophidae). It is distinguished from its congeners by the combination of having vaginal pores opening outside the intercecal space and proximal regions of the vaginae terminating {{at the level of}} the ceca. Members of Calicotyle have not been reported previously from the eastern Pacific Ocean or from these hosts.

40|$|Demersal {{sharks and}} rays are common yet {{vulnerable}} components of the bycatch in tropical bottom-trawl fisheries. Little {{is known about the}} elasmobranch assemblages associated with most of these fisheries, particularly within the eastern tropical Pacific. This study characterized the elasmobranch assemblage associated with the shrimp trawl fishery along the Pacific coast of Costa Rica. Between August 2008 and August 2012, 346 trawl hauls were conducted at depths of 18 – 350 m. These hauls resulted in a sample of 4564 elasmobranchs from 25 species and 13 families. The Panamic stingray (Urotrygon aspidura), rasptail skate (Raja velezi), brown <b>smoothhound</b> (Mustelus henlei), and witch guitarfish (Zapteryx xyster) accounted for more than 66 % of the elasmobranch abundance within the bycatch. Depth was the main factor influencing the elasmobranch assemblage; species richness was significantly higher at depths < 100 m than at other depths. Two groups of elasmobranchs were identified: the first was found in shallow waters (< 50 m), and the second was observed at depths of 50 – 350 m. Sex and size segregation patterns are also influenced by depth.

40|$|This {{study is}} the first to {{estimate}} age, growth and longevity of M. asterias based on interpretation of band pairs in sectioned vertebrae. Age and growth of 106 male and 114 female starry smooth-hound sharks (Mustelus asterias) were estimated by counting band pairs on unstained sectioned vertebrae. Growth curves were fitted to the length-at-age data using the von Bertalanffy and Gompertz models. The 1 -parameter von Bertalanffy-L 0 provided the best fit for males (L∞ = 104 cm TL, L 0 = 30 cm TL and estimated K = 16 0. 224) and females (L∞ = 133 cm TL, L 0 = 30 cm TL and estimated K = 0. 136). Longevity was estimated to be 11. 8 and 20. 2 years for males and females respectively. The length weight relationship is also presented for 304 male and 424 female M. asterias.

5|$|Compared to {{the related}} grey and brown <b>smoothhounds</b> that share its range, the leopard shark has {{smaller and more}} {{numerous}} red blood cells, allowing it to process oxygen more efficiently.

Small leopard sharks fall prey to larger sharks such as the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias) and the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus). On one occasion, a sevengill shark was seen ambushing a leopard shark on a tidal mudflat in Humboldt Bay, striking with such momentum that the larger predator momentarily beached itself.

40|$|Abstract Cartilaginous {{fish are}} the oldest extant jawed {{vertebrates}} {{and the oldest}} line to have placentae. Their pivotal evolutionary position makes them attractive models to investigate the mechanisms involved in the maternal-fetal interaction. This study describes the tissue expression of the cytokine interlukin- 1 (IL- 1) α, IL- 1 β and its specific membrane receptor, IL- 1 receptor type I (IL- 1 R tI) in a placental cartilaginous fish, the <b>smoothhound</b> shark, Mustelus canis. The presence of this cytokine {{has been reported in}} many mammalian placentae, {{as well as in the}} placenta of a squamate reptile and this study extends these observations to the cartilaginous fishes. The uteroplacental complex in M. canis consists of a yolk sac modified into a functional yolk sac placenta and complimentary uterine attachment sites. Immunohistochemistry for IL- 1 α, IL- 1 β and the receptor reveals leucocytes of both the mother and fetus to be positive, as well as the apical aspect of paraplacental cells and the apical vesicles in the umbilical cord epithelium. Yolk sac endoderm is also positive with all the stains while the ectoderm is positive only for IL- 1 α. Immunoreactivity in the uterine epithelium was obtained for IL- 1 α and the receptor. The egg envelope is always negative. In light of the recent finding of IL- 1 β gene in a cartilaginous fish and of the high level of conservation of proteins implicated in IL- 1 action, our data suggest that IL- 1 system is a key mediator of the materno-fetal interaction since the oldest extant placental vertebrates. </p...|$|E

Although viviparity is advantageous for nourishment and growth of the offspring, it involves an immunological risk for sperm containing paternal antigens and the placenta containing fetal antigens. The placental <b>smoothhound</b> shark, Mustelus canis, has yolk sac placentation and stores sperm throughout the year in sperm storage tubules (SST) of the terminal zone (TZ) in the oviducal gland (OG) in the female. This animal {{has been used as}} a model to examine the uteroplacental complex and SST. Techniques used were transmission electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry to investigate the tissue expression of the cytokines interlukin 1 (IL- 1) α, IL- 1 β, its specific membrane receptor, IL- 1 receptor type I (IL- 1 R tI) and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF). In addition the uteroplacental complex has been profiled as to the diversity of its glycosylation, which was found to be as complex as that found in both reptilian and mammalian placenta. Immunostaining of the uteroplacental complex for IL- 1 α, IL- 1 β, IL-R tI revealed by binding leucocytes of both the mother and fetus. Yolk sac endoderm was also positive for all the epitopes studied while ectoderm was positive only for IL- 1 α. Immunoreactivity in the uterine endometrium was obtained for IL- 1 α and its receptor while the egg envelope was always negative. Placenta and SST were positive for MIF and IL- 1 receptor. The present findings on the expression of the interleukin system and MIF in the uteroplacental complex and SST suggest that these cytokines are involved in evolutionarily conserved immunological mechanisms that anticipate the presence of paternal and fetal antigens in maternal tissues...|$|E

40|$|Global {{trends in}} commercially {{valuable}} teleost fisheries point to substantial deterioration in population size, offering limited potential for increased harvests. Consequently {{a shift in}} focus towards alternative fisheries has increased fishing effort towards targeting chondrichthyans as a possible solution to meet global demands. The life-history traits of chondrichthyans make them poor candidates for resolving economic and nutritional security as these make them particularly vulnerable to anthromorphic influences. Current fisheries management approaches based on centralized government intervention have proved inadequate. This failure of current management approaches is often linked with poor co-operation by industry with government when collecting fishery-dependent data. As management decisions are based on quantitative estimates from fishery assessment modes data collected are often of poor quality. Co-management with its implied power-sharing arrangement between government and fishing communities has been proposed as a more realistic alternative. The motivation within industry to collect high quality data can only be created {{with a feeling of}} ownership. The decline in linefish species in South Africa has led to increased exploitation of demersal sharks such as Mustelus mustelus. Their status as one of the target and by-catch species of South Africa's shark fisheries necessitated resource assessment. Age, growth, maturity and mortality calculations for M mustelus were made from data collected from 1983 - 2006. The maximum observed age for M mustelus was 25 years. Estimated von Bertalanffy growth parameters from observed length-at-age for combined sexes, females and males were L∞ = 1946. 16 mm TL, K = 0. 08 year⁻', to = - 3. 63 year⁻'; L∞ = 2202. 21 mm, K = 0. 05 year⁻', to = 4. 67 years; and L∞ = 1713. 19 mm TL, K = 0. 08 year⁻' and to = - 4. 36 years, respectively. Instantaneous total mortality (Z) was estimated at 0. 16 y⁻', whilst natural mortality (M) for M mustelus was estimated at 0. 05 y⁻'. The age and length at 50 % maturity was determined for combined sexes, females and males at 1216 mm TL corresponding to an age of 9. 93 years, 1234 mm (TL) and 10. 75 years, and 1106 mm TL and 9. 1 years respectively. The <b>smoothhound</b> shark resource off the south-eastern and south-western Cape coast was assessed by three dynamic pool models; yield per recruit, spawner biomass per recruit and an extended yield and spawner biomass per recruit. Due to the longevity of elasmobranches the per-recruit model was extended over a 20 year time-frame to simulate resource responses to management options. Fo. 1 was estimated as 0. 034 year⁻' and F MAX was estimated as 0. 045 year⁻'. FsB 50 was estimated as 0. 031. The extended per-recruit model tested the outcome of different management scenarios, Size and effort control showed the least probability of pristine biomass falling below 20 % of current levels in 20 years (where selectivity was set at 3 years). The replacement yield model showed that the average catches over the past decade are 2. 5 times higher than the replacement yield is on the South Coast and 1. 30 on the West Coast. A more realistic level optimising yield would be at 0. 05 with a selection pattern at 3 years, where the probability of the biomass falling to below 20 % of pristine pre-exploited levels in twenty years becomes negligible. A comparison of the models showed that current catches need to be halved for exploitation of <b>smoothhound</b> sharks to be sustainable. The results of this study indicate a need for a management intervention for M mustelus in South Africa with regards to potential overexploitation and collection of quality data for further assessments. A demersal identification key was developed as part of this study, which should aid monitoring officials in accurately identifying shark logs for collecting data. This study showed how adopting a management plan with the inclusion of comanagement concepts would improve the quality of data collected and increase monitoring of fishing activities. The inclusion of co-management is possible due to the unique bottle neck created by few demersal shark processing facilities actively exporting shark. A fishery management plan was compiled proposing several management options including size and effort controls...|$|E
40|$|The {{skeletons of}} chondrichthyans (sharks, skates, rays, and chimeras) are {{composed}} entirely of cartilage, yet must still provide the skeletal support that bone does in other vertebrates. There {{is also an}} incredible range of diversity in the morphology of the cartilaginous skeleton of the feeding apparatus in Chondrichthyans. The goal {{of this research is}} to provide insight into the morphological evolution and biomechanical function of the cranial skeleton in chondrichthyans. Differences in feeding style likely change with the gross morphology of the ten skeletal elements of the shark feeding apparatus, since these elements are common to all shark species. In chapter one, to increase our understanding of how the feeding skeletal morphology has evolved with the of feeding style of sharks, the length, width, and angles of the elements of the feeding apparatus are measured in four species (white-spotted bamboo, Chiloscyllium plagiosum; spiny dogfish, Squalus acanthias; sandbar, Carcharhinus plumbeus; and dusky <b>smoothhound,</b> Mustelus canis). These species encompass a wide phylogenetic range, and include suction and bite feeders as well as two different orientations of the hyomandibula, the major jaw supporting element. A principle components analysis is used to identify relationships among the skeletal elements by species, and linear regressions are then used to test the effect of hyomandibula length on the other morphological variables. Strong relationships were discovered between the length of the hyomandibula and the lengths of all other skeletal elements and the angle of the hyomandibula. The bite feeders have longer elements and appear to maximize the size of the oral cavity, allowing larger prey to be swallowed. Suction feeders have shorter elements, which restrict the size of the oral cavity and mouth opening, but can concentrate suction forces. Based on the strong relationship between hyomandibula length and angle on feeding morphology, the mechanical properties of the hyomandibular cartilages in the same four shark species is investigated in chapter two. Young 2 ̆ 7 s modulus, a measure of stiffness, and Poisson 2 ̆ 7 s ratio, a measure of three-dimensional shape change, of the hyomandibular cartilages are compared. While Poisson 2 ̆ 7 s ratio is similar among the species, Young 2 ̆ 7 s modulus increases with mineralization and is larger in the suction feeders. Though sharks have a cartilaginous skeleton, some species have higher mineralization of elements that are under higher stress. ...|$|E
40|$|I {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen influence the distribution and abundance of elasmobranchs (sharks, skates, and rays) in Tomales Bay, California. I captured elasmobranchs monthly (September 1990 -April 1992) on longlines set in the bay. A Poisson regression under generalized least squares {{was used to determine}} that temperature and salinity were the most important factors determining the distribution and abundance of the three most commonly captured species; bat ray, Myliobatis californica, leopard shark, Triakis semifasciata, and brown <b>smoothhound</b> shark, Mustelis henlei. Females of all three species were more abundant than males throughout the bay, and were most abundant in the warmer more saline inner bay. All three species left Tomales Bay in late fall as water temperatures in the bay dropped below 10 - 12 °C, and returned in early spring after temperatures rose above 10 °C. The oxygen consumption of bat rays, Myliobatis californica, was determined at 8, 14, 20, and 26 °C. Mean, standard, mass-independent metabolic rates (MO 2 in mg O 2 •kg- 0. 67 •h- 1) of unacclimated rays at each temperature were significantly different from one another. MO 2 was extremely temperature sensitive from 20 - 26 °C (Q 10 = 6. 62), and moderately sensitive at the upper (20 - 26 °C: Q 10 = 1. 85) and lower (8 - 14 °C: Q 10 = 2. 23) temperature ranges. The effects of four temperatures (8, 14, 20, 26 °C) on blood oxygen equilibrium curves of the bat ray, Myliobatis californica, was investigated. Blood oxygen equilibrium curves at all temperatures were hyperbolic (n 50 < 2), with high affinity (low P 50), large Bohr factors (0 = - 0. 45 to - 0. 52), high blood oxygen carrying capacity (CBO 2 = 6. 8 to 9. 06), and very large non­-bicarbonate buffering capacity (β = - 14. 25 to - 16. 43). CBO 2, 0, and β are among the largest measured in a poikilothermic elasmobranch. Affinity decreased with increasing temperature except at 26 °C. The affinity shift at 26 °C and a concomitant 25 % drop in CBO 2 at this temperature suggests a hemoglobin heterogeneity. Blood oxygen equilibrium curves were temperature insensitive betw en 8 - 14 °C and 20 - 26 °C and most sensitive between 14 - 20 °C, the temperature range in which bat rays are most commonly found in Tomales Bay. Bat rays appear capable of tolerating anoxia and hypercapnia (low P 50, n 50, and high β), and sustaining high activity levels (high CBO 2, 0, and β) by virtue of their unique hematological characteristics...|$|E

Norway supplies 39 metric tonnes, but Britain, France, Portugal and Italy are also major suppliers. Hong Kong handles at least 50% and possibly up to 80% of the world trade in shark fin, with the major suppliers being Europe, Taiwan, Indonesia, Singapore, United Arab Emirates, United States, Yemen, India, Japan, and Mexico.According to Giam's article, [...] "Sharks are caught in virtually all parts of the world....

The meat of dogfishes, <b>smoothhounds,</b> cat sharks, skates and rays is in high demand by European consumers.... The situation in Canada and the United States is similar: the blue shark is sought after as a sport fish while the porbeagle, mako and spiny dogfish are part of the commercial fishery.... The truth is this: Sharks will continue to be caught and killed on a wide scale by the more organized and sophisticated fishing nations. Targeting shark's fin soup will not stop this accidental catch. The fins from these catches will be thrown away or turned into animal feed and fertilizers if shark's fin soup is shunned." ...|$|R
40|$|Restored {{estuaries}} {{in southern}} California {{are limited in}} size and shape by fragmentation from human development, which can in turn restrict habitat use. Thus, {{it is important to}} assess how habitat design affects how fish use restored estuaries. Acoustic telemetry tracking from prior studies revealed that Grey <b>Smoothhounds</b> (Mustelus californicus) used primarily the eelgrass ecotone and warm interior waters in Bolsa Chica Full Tidal Basin (BCFTB), a 1. 48 km 2 open-format marine dominated estuary. In this study, M. californicus utilized the Channel in Huntington Beach Wetlands Complex (HBWC), a smaller creek estuary. The Channel had more eelgrass than other available habitats but was also the coolest microhabitat, with temperatures below what M. californicus was found to select in BCFTB. Individuals may behaviorally thermoregulate by moving upstream, away from the HBWC Channel, during periods of incoming, cooler ocean water. Mustelus californicus translocated to different microhabitats within the HBWC selected the Channel habitat after the translocation regardless of where animals were released. Despite the large difference in available subtidal habitat between HBWC and BCFTB, no differences in patch size utilization distributions of M. californicus were observed. While individuals seem to shift between microhabitats based on temperature and eelgrass availability, the area size used by M. californicus appears to be the same within both sites despite the differences in overall size between sites. These results suggest that differences in microhabitat use may influence distribution patterns of M. californicus within each site, and therefore, shark abundance may vary with the restoration design (e. g. basin versus channel) {{and the size of the}} estuarine habitat. This information on habitat selection will be critical to planning future restorations on the Southern California coast...|$|R
40|$|Long-term {{trends in}} the elasmobranch {{assemblage}} of Elkhorn Slough, Monterey Bay, California, were analyzed by documenting species composition and catch per unit effort (CPUE) from 55 sport fishing derbies that occurred during May, June, and July, from 1951 until 1995. The most abundant species (bat ray, Myliobatis californica; shovelnose guitarfish, Rhinobatos productus; and leopard shark, Triakis semifasciata) were also analyzed for size-weight relationships, trends in size class distribution, stage of maturity, and sex ratios. Changes in species composition {{over the course of}} the derbies included the near complete disappearance of shovelnose guitarfish by the 1970 ’s and a slight increase in the abundance of minor species (mainly <b>smoothhounds,</b> Mustelus spp., and thornback, Platyrhinoidis triseriata) starting in the mid 1960 ’s. The relative abundance of bat rays in the catch steadily increased over the years while the relative abundance of leopard sharks declined during the last two decades. However the average number of bat rays and leopard sharks caught per derby declined during the last two decades. Fishing effort appeared to increase {{over the course of the}} derbies. There were no dramatic shifts in the size class distribution data for bat rays, leopard sharks, or shovelnose guitarfish. The catch of bat rays and leopard sharks was consistently dominated by immature individuals, while the catch of shovelnose guitarfish was heavily dominated by adults. There was evidence of sexual segregation in either immature or mature fish in all the species. Female bat rays and shovelnose guitarfish were larger than their male counterparts and outnumbered males nearly 2 : 1. Female and male leopard sharks were more nearly equal in size and sex ratio. Changes in species composition are likely due to fishing pressure, shifts in the prevailing oceanographic conditions, and habitat alteration in Elkhorn Slough. The sex ratios, stage of maturity, and size class distributions provide further evidence for the theory that Elkhorn Slough functions as a nursery habitat for bat rays and leopard sh...|$|R
