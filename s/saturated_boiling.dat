The heated element for Fluorinert FC- 72 was a thin plate made of Haynes- 230. Infrared thermography was used to determine changes in the temperature on its outer smooth side. The porous surface in contact with the fluid in the minichannel was produced in two processes: sintering or soldering of Fe powder to the plate. The results were presented as relationships between the heat transfer coefficient and the distance from the minichannel inlet and as boiling curves.

In the subcooled boiling region, at a higher heat flux, the heat transfer coefficient was slightly higher for the surface prepared via soldering.

40|$|This {{paper is}} Part II of a two-part study devoted to {{measurement}} and prediction of the <b>saturated</b> flow <b>boiling</b> {{heat transfer coefficient}} in water-cooled micro-channel heat sinks. Part I discussed the experimental findings from the study, and identified unique aspects of flow boiling in micro-channels such as abrupt transition to the annular flow regime near the point of zero thermodynamic equilibrium quality, and the decrease in heat transfer coefficient with increasing quality. The operating conditions of water-cooled micro-channels fell outside the recommended range for most prior empirical correlations. In this paper, an annular flow model is developed to predict the <b>saturated</b> flow <b>boiling</b> heat transfer coefficient. Features unique to two-phase micro-channel flow, such as laminar liquid and vapor flow, smooth interface, and strong droplet entrainment and deposition effects, are identified and incorporated into the model. The model correctly captures the unique overall trend of decreasing heat transfer coefficient with increasing vapor quality in the low vapor quality region of micro-channels. Good agreement is achieved between the model predictions and heat transfer coefficient data over broad ranges of flow rate and heat flux...|$|R

40|$|For the {{application}} of minichannel heat exchangers, {{it is necessary to}} have accurate design tools for predicting heat transfer and pressure drop. Until recently, this type of heat exchangers was not well studied, and in the scientific literature there were large discrepancies between results reported by different investigators. The present thesis aims to add to the knowledge of the fundamentals of single- and two-phase flow heat transfer and pressure drop in narrow channels, thereby aiding in the development of this new, interesting technology with the possibility of decreasing the size of electronics through better cooling, and of increasing the energy efficiency of thermal processes and thermodynamic cycles through enhanced heat transfer. A comprehensive experimental single-phase flow and <b>saturated</b> flow <b>boiling</b> heat transfer and pressure drop study has been carried out on vertical stainless steel tubes with inner diameters of 1. 700, 1. 224 and 0. 826 mm, using R- 134 a as the test fluid. The heat transfer and pressure drop results were compared both to conventional correlations developed for larger diameter channels and to correlations developed specifically for microscale geometries. Contrary to many previous investigations, this study has shown that the test data agree well with single-phase heat transfer and friction factor correlations known to be accurate for larger channels, thus expanding their ranges to cover mini/microchannel geometries. The main part of the study concerns <b>saturated</b> flow <b>boiling</b> heat transfer and pressure drop. Tests with the same stainless steel tubes showed that the heat transfer is strongly dependent on heat flux, but only weakly dependent on mass flux and vapor fraction (up to the location of dryout). This behavior is usually taken to indicate a dominant influence of nucleate boiling, and indicates that the boiling mechanism is strongly related to that in nucleate boiling. The test data for boiling heat transfer was compared to several correlations from the literature, both for macro- and mini-channels. A new correlation for <b>saturated</b> flow <b>boiling</b> heat transfer of refrigerant R- 134 a correlation was obtained based on the present experimental data. This correlation predicts the presented data with a mean absolute deviation of  8 %. The frictional pressure drop results were compared to both macro- and mini channel correlations available from the literature. The correlation suggested by Qu and Mudawar (2003) gave the best prediction to the frictional two-phase pressure drop within the studied ranges. A unique visualization study of <b>saturated</b> flow <b>boiling</b> characteristics in a vertical 1. 332 mm inner diameter quartz tube, coated with a transparent heater has also been conducted. The complete evaporation process in a heated circular mini-channel has been studied visually in detail using high speed CCD camera.
