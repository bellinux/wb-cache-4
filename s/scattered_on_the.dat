5|$|Amanita daucipes is a {{mycorrhizal}} species, and its fruit bodies may {{be found}} growing solitary or <b>scattered</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground in mixed coniferous and deciduous forests (especially those dominated by oak trees) in Maryland, North Carolina, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Kentucky, and Texas; other associated tree species include hickory (genus Carya) and birch (Betula). A predilection for disturbed soil, such as roadsides, has been noted. Amanita authority Cornelis Bas, writing in his extensive 1969 monograph on the genus, claimed A.daucipes to be a rare species; subsequent investigations have shown it to be common in oak forests in the eastern United States. The southern end of its distribution extends to Sonora, Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Enterprise is {{approaching}} the planet. Picard enters his ready room and finds his belongings <b>scattered</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor.

40|$|Illusory {{correlation}} is {{the perception}} of an association between two uncorrected variables such as intersubtest <b>scatter</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children - Third Edition (WISC-III) {{and the presence of}} a learning disability. This study assessed the extent to which school psychologists are influenced by this illusory correlation. Three independent variables were varied systematically. One variable was relevant to the diagnosis of a learning disability (a discrepancy between expected and actual levels of achievement <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Wechsler Individual Achievement Test (WIAT)). Another was irrelevant to <b>the</b> diagnosis (intersubtest <b>scatter</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> WISC-III). The third independent variable was used as a warning to those participants who had an illusory belief that intersubtest <b>scatter</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> WISC-III is a valid indicator of a learning disability. Certified school psychologists randomly received case study material for a child referred for a psychological evaluation. It was found that participants based their diagnostic decisions about learning disabilities <b>on</b> <b>the</b> illusory belief that intersubtest <b>scatter</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> WISC-III is a valid indicator of a learning disability in the no warning condition only. When warned of this illusory belief, this effect disappeared. This illusory belief, therefore, could effect school psychologists 2 ̆ 7 diagnostic decisions and therefore falsely identify children as learning disabled...|$|R

5|$|On {{the crest}} of Sibidang-san, an antipersonnel {{minefield}} stopped the first North Korean infantry assault. More attacks followed in quick succession, {{all of which were}} repulsed by the US troops' superior firepower. By 02:30 the B Company riflemen were so depleted of ammunition that they began stripping machine-gun bullets from the ammunition belts and using them in their rifles. The 1st Platoon of C Company, {{at the base of the}} mountain behind B Company, climbed Sibidang-san in 45 minutes with an ammunition resupply for the company. Just before dawn the North Korean attack subsided. Daylight revealed a vast amount of abandoned North Korean equipment <b>scattered</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> slope just below the crest, including 33 machine-guns. Among the North Korean dead was the commanding officer of the NK 13th Regiment.|$|E
5|$|The arch is {{constructed}} from local stone and was originally {{topped by a}} bronze chariot pulled by six horses. Statues of nymphs poured water into carved marble basins {{at the foot of}} the arch. Caracalla and Julia Domna were represented on medallion busts, though these have been defaced. The monument was reconstructed by the French between 1930–34. However, the restoration is incomplete and of disputed accuracy. The inscription on the top of the arch was reconstructed from the fragments noticed by Windus in 1722, which had been <b>scattered</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground in front of the arch.|$|E
5|$|The crew filmed several {{exterior}} {{scenes in}} the countryside near Madrid; the Cimmerian village was built in a forest near the Valsaín ski resort, south of Segovia. About onemillion pesetas ($12,084) worth of marble shavings were <b>scattered</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground to simulate snow. The Wheel of Pain scene {{took place in the}} province of Ávila. Conan's encounter with the witch and Subotai was shot among the Ciudad Encantada rock formations in the province of Cuenca.

40|$|We {{show the}} {{scattering}} of electromagnetic radiation on a rotating cylinder and a rotating sphere using formalism of the vector spherical harmonics in this thesis. If a specific condition is satisfied {{then we can}} observe the rotational superradiance, phenomena originally discovered by Y. B. Zel'dovich in 1970 s saying that the radiation can gain power by <b>scattering</b> <b>on</b> a rotating body. In this particular case there is an underlying principle of the rotational superradiance, the energy dissipation {{in the form of}} Joule heating created due to the induction of surface currents <b>on</b> <b>the</b> conductor. Superradiance can occur in <b>the</b> radiation <b>scattering</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rotating black hole background, although there is no dissipation present. We summarize <b>the</b> results of <b>scattering</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Kerr black hole from the literature, including an application called Black hole bomb, when the black hole is enclosed into a perfectly reflecting mirror. We show that for the lowest modes of the radiation at specific intervals the general relativity results can be approximated by <b>scattering</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> flat spacetime...|$|R

5|$|The {{species was}} {{described}} as new to science in 1774 by Jacob Christian Schaeffer. Its distribution encompasses Asia, North Africa, Europe, and Central America. Its presence in North America has not been clarified, due to confusion with the similar species Russula parvovirescens and R.crustosa. R.virescens fruits singly or <b>scattered</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground in both deciduous and mixed forests, forming mycorrhizal associations with broadleaf trees such as oak, European beech, and aspen. In Asia, it associates with several species of tropical lowland rainforest trees of the family Dipterocarpaceae. R.virescens has a ribonuclease enzyme with a biochemistry unique among edible mushrooms. It also has biologically active polysaccharides, and a laccase enzyme that can break down several dyes used in the laboratory and in the textile industry.|$|E
5|$|Heavily {{built and}} {{characteristically}} smooth, the pectoral fin disc of the short-tail stingray has a rather angular, rhomboid shape and is slightly wider than long. The leading {{margins of the}} disc are very gently convex, and converge on a blunt, broadly triangular snout. The eyes are small and immediately followed by much larger spiracles. The widely spaced nostrils are long and narrow; between them is a short, skirt-shaped curtain of skin with a fringed posterior margin. The modestly sized mouth has an evenly arched lower jaw, prominent grooves at the corners, and 5–7 papillae (nipple-like structures) on the floor. Additional, tiny papillae are <b>scattered</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> nasal curtain and outside the lower jaw. The teeth are arranged with a quincunx pattern into flattened surfaces; each tooth is small and blunt, with a roughly diamond-shaped base. There are 45–55 tooth rows in either jaw. The pelvic fins are somewhat large and rounded at the tips.|$|E
5|$|The {{persecution}} in Africa {{also encouraged}} {{the development of}} Donatism, a schismatic movement that forbade any compromise with Roman government or traditor bishops (those who had handed scriptures over to secular authorities). One of the key moments in the break with the mainline Church occurred in Carthage in 304. The Christians from Abitinae {{had been brought to}} the city and imprisoned. Friends and relatives of the prisoners came to visit, but encountered resistance from a local mob. The group was harassed, beaten, and whipped; the food they had brought for their imprisoned friends was <b>scattered</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground. The mob had been sent by Mensurius, the bishop of the city, and Caecilian, his deacon, for reasons that remain obscure. In 311, Caecilian was elected bishop of Carthage. His opponents charged that his traditio made him unworthy of the office, and declared itself for another candidate, Majorinus. Many others in Africa, including the Abitinians, also supported Majorinus against Caecilian. Majorinus's successor Donatus would give the dissident movement its name. By the time Constantine took over the province, the African church was deeply divided. The Donatists would not be reconciled to the Catholic Church until after 411.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} pseudo-spin density {{response}} of a disordered two-dimensional spin-polarized Bose gas of exciton polaritons to weak alternating magnetic field, assuming {{that one of}} the spin states of the doublet is macroscopically occupied and Bose-condensed while the occupation of the other state remains much smaller. We calculate spatial and temporal dispersions of spin susceptibility of the gas taking into account spin-flip processes due to the transverse-longitudinal splitting. Further, we use the Bogoliubov theory of weakly-interacting gases and show that the time-dependent magnetic field power absorption exhibits double resonance structure corresponding to two particle spin states (contrast to paramagnetic resonance in regular spin-polarized electron gas). We analyze the widths of these resonances caused by <b>scattering</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> disorder and show that, in contrast with the ballistic regime, in the presence of impurities, <b>the</b> polariton <b>scattering</b> <b>on</b> them is twofold: <b>scattering</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> impurity potential directly and <b>scattering</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> spatially fluctuating condensate density caused by the disorder. As a result, the width of the resonance associated with the Bose-condensed spin state can be surprizingly narrow in comparison with the width of the resonance associated with the non-condensed state.
