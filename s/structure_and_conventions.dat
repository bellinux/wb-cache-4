50|$|Certain {{standing}} committee seats {{are seen as}} having more weight than others, solely due to promotion <b>structure</b> <b>and</b> <b>conventions</b> that have congealed over the years. The Deputy Party Secretary is the most prestigious sub-provincial level post - it is generally seen as the final 'training ground' prior to a promotion to governorship or a minister-level state position. The party chiefs of provincial capitals or other sub-provincial cities also often receive promotions; these are positions of substantive power as they oversee aspects of an area that would otherwise normally fall under provincial jurisdiction. Another closely watched position is the party committee secretary-general, perhaps due to the {{close proximity to the}} machinery of the party organizations they serve, and the youthful profile of many of its officeholders signalling promotion potential.|$|E

40|$|Creating Powerpoint presentations has now {{became part}} of the {{requirement}} at tertiary level. As countries are now moving towards achieving knowledge-based workers who are able to compete and perform at the tertiary level and the working world, the requirement in using technology is now a must. However, exposure to all of the linguistic features, <b>structures</b> <b>and</b> <b>conventions</b> of Powerpoint presentations should have begun at a tender age with facilitation from the teachers throughout primary and secondary education. Unfortunately, due to budget cuts and time constraints, many learners did not get the privilege of learning the 'how-to's in using Powerpoint presentations slide. This proved to be an obstacle to these novices at their point of entry into tertiary education as compared to their more experienced comrades. Hence, this discourse study was conducted to shed light onto the linguistic features, <b>structures</b> <b>and</b> <b>conventions</b> displayed by these novices when dealing with Powerpoint presentations. Furthermore, this study serves as a start-up point as {{it is one of the}} rare few researches that look into Powerpoint presentation slides through the use of a discourse analysis and a Language Analysis Model by Ellis and Johnson (1994). The study was conducted using two models which are the Ellis and Johnson's (1994) framework and Bhatia's (1993) model. These models were then used to analyze linguistic features, <b>structures</b> <b>and</b> <b>conventions</b> present in the Powerpoint presentation slides. Based on the findings, it was evident that novice learners do show regularity in the features of Powerpoint presentations used pertaining to their rhetorical structure, lexico - grammatical features <b>and</b> <b>conventions.</b> The findings highlighted the errors in signposting and labeling, use of tenses and rhetorical questions, text to visual ratio, selection of lexis as well as organization of Powerpoint presentation slides. The findings congregated could encourage educational institutions to emphasize and incorporate Powerpoint presentation lessons or assessments into classrooms. Furthermore, the findings could aid in understanding the processes, acceptable norms and the workings in regards to Powerpoint presentations. On top of that, it could create awareness on the importance of learning the features that entails a good Powerpoint presentation as this practice will be a life-long skill. It is hoped that, due to the importance of mastery this skill, schools and the Ministry could include this as a compulsory module at school level.

40|$|More recently, and {{particularly}} since 2000, the actual {{structure of a}} Bangsawan performance in Malaysia {{has been a source}} of contention. As someone who has followed the development of the art form over the last fifteen years, I believe that the absence of written sources of Bangsawan's <b>structure</b> <b>and</b> <b>conventions</b> is the main factor behind this prolonged dispute. Resources on Bangsawan's <b>structure</b> <b>and</b> <b>conventions</b> have fully depended on oral transmission, without any written documents to serve as references. Thus, this research seeks to establish a series of conventions as a guideline for a contemporary Bangsawan performance. Following the first stage of my fieldwork (February to May 2013), a series of Bangsawan conventions was produced, based on the practice of Rahman B., a Bangsawan guru who was awarded National Artiste by Malaysian government in 2003 for his timeless contributions in the development of the Bangsawan art form. As practice-led research, a live performance was created and performed to test and measure these conventions. Five nights of performances were staged from 13 to 15 December 2013 in Panggung Bandaraya Kuala Lumpur (Kuala Lumpur City Theatre), with a duration of 120 minutes. The production involved 50 cast and crew, consisting of young performers selected through an audition process on 25 and 26 July 2013. The practice-led component of this project involved a full theatre-making process, divided into three stages: pre-production (July-August 2013), production (August-December 2013), and post-production (December 2013). My role in this performance project is mainly as a scriptwriter, designer, and production maker. An original script was completed based on the internationally known of The Arabian Nights with the title in Malay: Bangsawan Hikayat Seribu Satu Malam (Bangsawan One Thousand and One Nights). The story was adapted to the taste of a contemporary Malaysian audience while retaining the strong influence of Middle East cultures. The aesthetic and creative sides of the production were wholly designed within the framework of Rahman B. 's conventions. As practice led research, I have used Robin Nelson's PaR model to describe how the process informing my practice can be positioned academically. The main outcome of this project is the establishment of a set of conventions as an alternative guide for contemporary Bangsawan practitioners in Malaysia. In addition to producing written conventions, building these into a live performance with fifty young performers was also a ground breaking outcome. The production process of nearly five months provided performers with a deeper understanding of the art form. With the existence of a group of trained young practitioners, the conventions can in the future be applied and practiced more effectively and continuously...|$|E

Due to the multifaceted demands, and inherent <b>structure</b> <b>and</b> <b>conventions</b> of argumentative writing, it is also among the most difficult to master. The aim of this masters thesis is to create a prototype of an authoring tool that can help novices (13 - 19 years old) of argumentative essay writing construct better arguments and improve the overall structure and linearization of their texts. Embedded within this goal is the attempt to provide a framework representative of an argumentative essay, and a derivative application that reflects current theories and practices in the instruction of argumentative writing within a user-centred design. In researching and developing the XML-based framework ArgEssML (Argumentative Essay Markup Language) and the C–SAW (Computer-Supported Argumentative Writer) application, the main aims were to explore the considerations and approaches that should be used in the design of a computer-supported authoring tool to help novices improve the structure and quality of their argumentation as well as the global structure and linearization of their texts.

40|$|This study {{provides}} {{an account of}} the distributional information and the production rates in a particularly rich corpus of German child and adult language. Three structural domains are analysed: the parts-of-speech distribution for a coded corpus of circa one million words as well as the internal constituency of 300, 000 noun phrases and almost 200, 000 verb phrases. In all three domains, the distribution over time in the adult input is extremely homogenous. The child shows a steady approximation towards the adult distribution. It is argued that two notions of acquisition have to be distinguished: acquisition in terms of the availability of a given structure, for example in terms of first occurrence of a structure or according to various criteria of productivity, and acquisition in terms of full communicative competence, i. e., using structures in the way adults use them (cf. Slobin, 1991, 1997). The data presented here show that the child acquires not only the structural options of German but also highly conventionalised ways of encoding concepts. The amount of information about the <b>structure</b> <b>and</b> <b>conventions</b> of German that is available in the input has the potential of making innate stipulations unnecessary.

40|$|Two of {{the most}} popular of {{television}} genres, soap opera and sports coverage have been very much differentiated along gender lines in terms of their audiences. Soap opera has been regarded very much as a 'gynocentric ' genre with a large female viewing audience while the audiences for television sport have been predominantly male. Gender differentiation between the genres has had implications for the popular image of each. Soap opera has been perceived as inferior; as mere fantasy and escapism for women while television sports has been perceived as a legitimate, even edifying experience for men. In this article the authors challenge the view that soap opera and television sport are radically different and argue that they are, in fact, very similar in a number of significant ways. They suggest that both genres invoke similar structures of feeling and sensibility in their respective audiences and that television sport is a 'male soap opera'.

Federal Government 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) provide the following guidelines for coding and reporting using the International Classification of Diseases, 10 th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD- 10 -CM). These guidelines {{should be used}} as a companion document to the official version of the ICD- 10 - CM as published on the NCHS website. The ICD- 10 -CM is a morbidity classification published by the United States for classifying diagnoses and reason for visits in all health care settings. The ICD- 10 -CM is based on the ICD- 10, the statistical classification of disease published by the World Health Organization (WHO). These guidelines have been approved by the four organizations that make up the Cooperating Parties for the ICD- 10 -CM: the American Hospital Association (AHA), the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA), CMS, and NCHS. These guidelines are a set of rules that have been developed to accompany and complement the official conventions and instructions provided within the ICD- 10 -CM itself. The instructions and conventions of the classification take precedence over guidelines. These guidelines are based on the coding and sequencing instructions in the Tabular List and Alphabetic Index of ICD- 10 -CM, but provide additional instruction. Adherence to these guidelines when assigning ICD- 10 -CM diagnosis codes is required under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). The diagnosis codes (Tabular List and Alphabetic Index) have been adopted under HIPAA for all healthcare settings. A joint effort between the healthcare provider and the coder is essential to achieve complete and accurate documentation, code assignment, and reporting of diagnoses and procedures. These guidelines have been developed to assist both the healthcare provider and the coder in identifying those diagnoses that are to be reported. The importance of consistent, complete documentation in the medical record cannot be overemphasized. Without such documentation accurate coding cannot be achieved. The entire record should be reviewed to determine the specific reason for the encounter and the conditions treated. The term encounter is used for all settings, including hospital admissions. In the context of these guidelines, the term provider is used throughout the guidelines to mean physician or any qualified health care practitioner who is legally accountable for establishing the patient 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s diagnosis. Only this set of guidelines, approved by the Cooperating Parties, is official. The guidelines are organized into sections.

Section II includes guidelines for selection of principal diagnosis for non-outpatient settings. Section III includes guidelines for reporting additional diagnoses in non-outpatient settings. Section IV is for outpatient coding and reporting. It is necessary to review all sections of the guidelines to fully understand all of the rules and instructions needed to code properly...|$|E

Participants worked individually or in dyads to learn a set of functionally-defined categories, instantiated as supposed alien creatures. The perceptual structure of these categories was complex: one function could be predicted by a unidimensional rule but the other was defined by a family-resemblance substructure. In addition to the main function-prediction task, each learner worked individually to sort the exemplars (pre- and post-function prediction) and in an individual prediction test that yielded selective attention data. Dyadic learners predicted the functional features with significantly greater accuracy compared to individual learners. This dyadic advantage was even greater for predicting the simple rule-based function compared to the FR function.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the ways in}} which The Martyrology, the magnum opus of Canadian poet bpNichol, {{examines the}} influence that language has on thought. The early twentieth century linguist Benjamin Lee Whorf propagated the idea that the language that one speaks affects how he or she thinks about the physical and conceptual world in which he or she lives. This idea, often called Whorfianism, has been highly influential in Marxist and feminist theory, and is often used to help describe {{the ways in which}} capitalist <b>and</b> patriarchal power <b>structures</b> are perpetuated. The Martyrology also examines such power <b>structures,</b> <b>and</b> it frequently does so by playing with the language used to describe those power <b>structures</b> <b>and</b> the language of those who benefit from such power structures.

40|$|This thesis {{critically}} interrogates {{the concept}} and practice of l’écriture féminine as proposed by Hélène Cixous, Luce Irigaray and Julia Kristeva to challenge phallocentric structures embedded in language and culture. It examines why abstraction has been so problematic for women and feminist artists and why, despite l’écriture féminine being utilised in art practice {{it came to a}} standstill in the mid- 1990 s, ceasing to provide possibilities for women’s abstract painting. By using l’écriture féminine as a ‘lens’ with which to see abstract painting, I have distilled particular aspects of it and put forward my own concept and practice of peinture féminine to move on from these problematics. I demonstrate that whilst the historicity of Modernist abstraction is embedded in abstract painting, it is not bound by rigid <b>and</b> fixed <b>structures</b> <b>and</b> <b>conventions</b> <b>and</b> these are not phallocentric per se. Peinture féminine as defined here reconceptualises abstract painting as a spatiality comprising multiple, shifting and heterogeneous spaces. In doing so, it expands abstract painting internally and opens up these conventions non-oppositionally. By elaborating on the ‘feminine’ in relation to current thinking about subjectivity, I argue that the unfolding of abstract painting through its ‘opening out’, enables an enfolding of difference within this spatiality. Peinture féminine offers new ways of understanding how difference can manifest through material production, rather than a focus on representing difference through a ‘feminine’ aesthetic. I draw on my own art practice and the work of other artists, locating this study as ‘art-practice-research’ through a ‘writing//painting’ approach which underpins my research; considering the textual as not being transposed into the painterly but as intertwined within this relation. This approach is productive to non-oppositional thinking and elaborates on the theory/practice relation as entangled, providing possibilities for ways of thinking about Fine Art doctoral research...|$|R

Marsviewer provides the option of overlaying derived images upon the source image, resulting in an easier-to-interpret color representation of the data. Display manipulations such as zoom, data range adjustment, contrast enhancement, and contour control are available. Image metadata (labels) from the current image can be displayed and searched. The architecture {{of the program is}} extensible: new types of RDRs can be installed and new file finders can be added to adapt the program to different file <b>structures</b> <b>and</b> different filename <b>conventions.</b> This keeps the application flexible and provides an opportunity for reuse with future rover missions...|$|R
