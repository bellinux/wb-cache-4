5|$|The {{posture of}} Ardhanarishvara may be tribhanga – bent in three parts: head (leaning to the left), torso (to the right) and right leg {{or in the}} sthanamudra {{position}} (straight), sometimes standing on a lotus pedestal, whereupon it is called samapada. Seated images of Ardhanarishvara are missing in iconographic treatises, but are still found in sculpture and painting.

5|$|Two {{music videos}} were shot {{for the single}} by Luis Hernandez and Satoru Yokoyama, respectively. Hernandez's version opens with busy streets and the dawn of Los Angeles, California. Hamasaki begins singing the song {{on top of a}} skyscraper, whilst several intercut scenes of people walking around Los Angeles during a time lapse are shown. She is then seen {{painting}} a picture of an unidentified man, who raps Verbal's part. It then shows intercut scenes of traffic, a carosuel and couple <b>standing</b> <b>near</b> a bridge. Several parts of these scenes are revised throughout the entire video, which ends with Hamasaki again on top of the skyscraper. For Yokoyama's video, only shots featuring Verbal were only filmed, alongside scenes of him walking through a city in Japan, and residing in a neon-lit club. Parts of Hernandez's version, with the scenes of Hamasaki painting a man and scenes of Los Angeles city and public, were removed in order to merge the first video and Verbal's appearance together. This version premiered one week before the album's release on July 2, and was included on the DVD and Blu-Ray versions of Colours.|$|E
