25|$|Benefits {{are funded}} by taxes imposed on wages of {{employees}} and self-employed persons. As explained below, {{in the case}} of employment, the employer and employee are each responsible for one half of the Social <b>Security</b> <b>tax,</b> with the employee's half being withheld from the employee's pay check. In the case of self-employed persons (i.e., independent contractors), the self-employed person is responsible for the entire amount of Social <b>Security</b> <b>tax.</b>|$|E

25|$|Critics of Social Security {{have said}} that the {{politicians}} who created Social Security exempted themselves from having to pay the Social <b>Security</b> <b>tax.</b> When the federal government created Social Security, all federal employees, including the president and members of Congress, were exempt from having to pay the Social <b>Security</b> <b>tax,</b> and they received no Social Security benefits. This law was changed by the Social Security Amendments of 1983, which brought within the Social Security system all members of Congress, the president and the vice president, federal judges, and certain executive-level political appointees, as well as all federal employees hired in any capacity on or after January 1, 1984. Many state and local government workers, however, are exempt from Social Security taxes because they contribute instead to alternative retirement systems set up by their employers.|$|E
25|$|A capped {{flat tax}} {{is one in}} which income is taxed at a flat rate until a {{specified}} cap amount is reached. For example, in 2014, the United States Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax is 6.2% of gross compensation up to a limit of $117,000 of gross compensation (resulting in a maximum Social <b>Security</b> <b>tax</b> of $7,254). This cap has the effect of turning a nominally flat tax into a regressive tax.|$|E

50|$|Payroll taxes paid by {{railroad}} {{employers and}} their employees {{are the primary}} source of funding for the railroad retirement-survivor benefit programs. Railroad retirement taxes, which have historically been higher than social <b>security</b> <b>taxes,</b> are calculated, like benefit payments, on a two-tier basis. Railroad retirement tier I payroll taxes are coordinated with social <b>security</b> <b>taxes</b> so that employees and employers pay tier I taxes {{at the same rate as}} social <b>security</b> <b>taxes.</b> In addition, both employees and employers pay tier II taxes which are used to finance railroad retirement benefit payments over and above social security levels. These tier II taxes are based on the ratio of certain asset balances to the sum of benefit payments and administrative expenses.|$|R

25|$|In the 1937 U.S. Supreme Court case of Helvering v. Davis, the Court {{examined}} {{the constitutionality of}} Social Security when George Davis of the Edison Electric Illuminating Company of Boston sued {{in connection with the}} Social <b>Security</b> <b>tax.</b> The U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts first upheld the tax. The District Court judgment was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. Commissioner Guy Helvering of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (now the Internal Revenue Service) took the case to the Supreme Court, and the Court upheld the validity of the tax.|$|E
25|$|Social Security {{affects the}} saving {{behavior}} {{of the people in}} three different ways. The wealth substitution effect occurs when a person saving for retirement recognizes that the Social Security system will take care of him and decreases his expectations about how much he needs to personally save. The retirement effect occurs when a taxpayer saves more each year in an effort to reduce the total number of years he must work to accumulate enough savings before retirement. The bequest effect occurs when a taxpayer recognizes a decrease in resources stemming from the Social <b>Security</b> <b>tax</b> and compensates by increasing personal savings to cover future expected costs of having children.|$|E

40|$|Using worker-level panel {{data for}} Turkey, this paper {{analyses}} the separate employment effects of {{increases in the}} social <b>security</b> <b>taxes</b> paid by employers and increases {{in the minimum wage}} between 2002 and 2005. Variation over time and among low-wage workers in the ratio of total labour costs to the gross wage gives rise to a natural experiment. Regression estimates indicate that a given increase in social <b>security</b> <b>taxes</b> has a larger negative effect on the probability of a worker remaining employed in the next quarter than an equal-sized increase in the minimum wage. Those who retain their jobs in the next quarter also experience a larger reduction in working hours when social <b>security</b> <b>taxes</b> increase than when the minimum wage rises. This is consistent with a situation in which workers increase effort in response to an increase in wages. Men, rural-dwellers and those under 30 are found to have the strongest overall disemployment effects in response to increases in labour costs...|$|R

25|$|Part A's {{inpatient}} admitted {{hospital and}} skilled nursing coverage is largely funded by revenue from a 2.9% payroll tax levied on employers and workers (each pay 1.45%). Until December 31, 1993, the law provided a {{maximum amount of}} compensation on which the Medicare tax could be imposed each year, {{in the same way}} that the Social <b>Security</b> <b>tax</b> works in the United States. Beginning January 1, 1994, the compensation limit was removed. Self-employed individuals must pay the entire 2.9% tax on self-employed net earnings (because they are both employee and employer), but may deduct half of the tax from the income in calculating income tax. Beginning in 2013, the rate of Part A tax on earned income exceeding US$200,000 for individuals (US$250,000 for married couples filing jointly) rose to 3.8%, in order to pay part of the cost of the subsidies mandated by the PPACA.|$|E
500|$|Bush {{began his}} second term by {{outlining}} a major initiative to [...] "reform" [...] Social Security, which was facing record deficit projections beginning in 2005.

In his 2005 State of the Union Address, Bush discussed the potential impending bankruptcy {{of the program and}} outlined his new program, which included partial privatization of the system, personal Social Security accounts, and options to permit Americans to divert a portion of their Social <b>Security</b> <b>tax</b> (FICA) into secured investments.

500|$|Gale {{analyzed}} {{a national}} sales tax (though different from the FairTax in several aspects) and reported that the overall tax burden on middle-income Americans would increase while the tax burden on the top 1% would drop. A study by the Beacon Hill Institute reported that the FairTax may {{have a negative effect}} on the well-being of mid-income earners for several years after implementation. According to the President's Advisory Panel for Federal Tax Reform report, which compared the individual and corporate income tax (excluding other taxes the FairTax replaces) to a sales tax with rebate, the percentage of federal taxes paid by those earning from $15,000–$50,000 would rise from 3.6% to 6.7%, while the burden on those earning more than $200,000 would fall from 53.5% to 45.9%. [...] The report states that the top 5% of earners would see their burden decrease from 58.6% to 37.4%. FairTax supporters argue that replacing the regressive payroll tax (a 15.3% total tax not included in the Tax Panel study; payroll taxes include a 12.4% Social <b>Security</b> <b>tax</b> on wages up to $97,500 and a 2.9% Medicare tax, a 15.3% total tax that is often split between employee and employer) greatly changes the tax distribution, and that the FairTax would relieve the tax burden on middle-class workers.|$|E

There are also taxes on the import of certain goods.

Initially, President Bush emphasized his proposal for personalized accounts would allow individual workers to invest {{a portion of their}} Social <b>Security</b> <b>Tax</b> (FICA) into secured investments.
