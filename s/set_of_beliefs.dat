5|$|Christian Science is a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>beliefs</b> and {{practices}} {{belonging to the}} metaphysical family of new religious movements. It was developed in 19th-century New England by Mary Baker Eddy, who argued in her book Science and Health (1875) that sickness is an illusion that can be corrected by prayer alone. The book became Christian Science's central text, along with the Bible, and by 2001 had sold over nine million copies.|$|E
5|$|Christian {{feminism}} is {{a branch of}} feminist theology which seeks to interpret and understand Christianity {{in light of the}} equality of women and men, and that this interpretation is necessary for a complete understanding of Christianity. While there is no standard <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>beliefs</b> among Christian feminists, most agree that God does not discriminate on the basis of sex, and are involved in issues such as the ordination of women, male dominance and the balance of parenting in Christian marriage, claims of moral deficiency and inferiority of women compared to men, and the overall treatment of women in the church. The Christian Bible refers to women in positions of authority in Judges 4:4 and Kings 22:14.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the many}} ethnic sub-groups in Madagascar adhere to their own <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>beliefs,</b> {{practices}} and ways of life that have historically contributed to their unique identities. However, {{there are a number}} of core cultural features that are common throughout the island, creating a strongly unified Malagasy cultural identity. In addition to a common language and shared traditional religious beliefs around a creator god and veneration of the ancestors, the traditional Malagasy worldview is shaped by values that emphasize fihavanana (solidarity), vintana (destiny), tody (karma), and hasina, a sacred life force that traditional communities believe imbues and thereby legitimates authority figures within the community or family. Other cultural elements commonly found throughout the island include the practice of male circumcision; strong kinship ties; a widespread belief in the power of magic, diviners, astrology and witch doctors; and a traditional division of social classes into nobles, commoners, and slaves.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} {{to the view that}} science rests on foundational assumptions, coherentism asserts that statements are justified by being a part of a coherent system. Or, rather, individual statements cannot be validated on their own: only coherent systems can be justified. A prediction of a transit of Venus is justified by its being coherent with broader beliefs about celestial mechanics and earlier observations. As explained above, observation is a cognitive act. That is, it relies on a pre-existing understanding, a systematic <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>beliefs.</b> An observation of a transit of Venus requires a huge range of auxiliary beliefs, such as those that describe the optics of telescopes, the mechanics of the telescope mount, and an understanding of celestial mechanics. If the prediction fails and a transit is not observed, that is likely to occasion an adjustment in the system, a change in some auxiliary assumption, rather than a rejection of the theoretical system.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Recent {{scaling up}} of POMDP solvers towards re-alistic {{applications}} is {{largely due to}} point-based methods that quickly converge to an approximate solution for medium-sized problems. These algorithms compute a value function for a finite reachable <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>belief</b> points, using backup operations. Point based algorithms differ on the selection <b>of</b> the <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>belief</b> points, and on the order by which backup operations are executed on the selected belief points. We first show how current algorithms execute a large number of backups that can be removed, without reducing the quality of the value function. We demonstrate that the ordering of backup operations on a predefined <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>belief</b> points is important. In the simpler domain of MDP solvers, prioritizing the order of equivalent backup operations on states is known to speed up convergence. We generalize the notion of prioritized backups to the POMDP framework, showing how existing algorithms can be improved by prioritizing backups. We also present a new algorithm, Prioritized Value Iteration (PVI), and show empirically that it outperforms current point-based algorithms. Finally, a new empirical evaluation measure (in addition to the standard runtime comparison), {{based on the number of}} atomic operations and the number <b>of</b> <b>belief</b> points, is proposed, in order to provide more accurate benchmark comparisons.

According to Sears' theory of symbolic racism, a subtle form of racism replaced the Jim Crow or “old-fashioned” racism. Instead of the open prejudice, based on beliefs in the biological inferiority of Blacks and support for formal segregation and discrimination, the symbolic racism is a more abstract <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>beliefs</b> comprising a “blend” of primitive anti-Black affect with traditional American moral values.|$|E
25|$|Another key {{concept in}} social {{cognition}} {{is the assumption}} that reality is too complex to easily discern. As a result, we tend to see the world according to simplified schemas or images of reality. Schemas are generalized mental representations that organize knowledge and guide information processing. Schemas often operate automatically and unintentionally, and can lead to biases in perception and memory. Expectations from schemas may lead us to see something that is not there. One experiment found that {{people are more likely to}} misperceive a weapon in the hands of a black man than a white man. This type of schema is actually a stereotype, a generalized <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>beliefs</b> about a particular group of people (when incorrect, an ultimate attribution error). Stereotypes are often related to negative or preferential attitudes (prejudice) and behavior (discrimination). Schemas for behaviors (e.g., going to a restaurant, doing laundry) are known as scripts.|$|E

40|$|The {{classical}} AGM (Alchourrón, Gärdenfors and Makinson [1985]) account <b>of</b> <b>belief</b> revision is {{an account}} of the process <b>of</b> changing <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>beliefs</b> by either adding beliefs consistent with a belief set (expansion), or giving up beliefs (contraction). The AGM account is built on two notions. First, propositions are either accepted, rejected, or indetermined. Second, <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>beliefs</b> should be represented in terms of classically consistent theories closed under deductive consequence. We offer an alternate approach by drawing upon logics with the four values: both true and false, just true, just false, and neither true nor false (Belnap [1977]). These are taken to be "believed" values, and apply to considered propositions. Agents can then show that they are positively undecided, and do not believe a proposition to be either true or false. This departure from the AGM account indicates the use of partial models. We present partial models in terms of model-sets (Hintikka [1969]). Differences [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} how primary and {{secondary}} teachers' knowledge influenced {{the implementation of a}} Year 1 - 10 science syllabus which was introduced into Queensland in 1999. The study investigated how the teachers' knowledge of the {{primary and secondary}} teachers differed and how teachers' knowledge impacted on the implementation of the science curriculum. Teacher knowledge otherwise referred to as teacher beliefs and practices has been acknowledged as an influence in the implementation of curriculum. Yet, a considerable portion of curriculum evaluation has focused on measuring the successful implementation of the intended curriculum and not the enactment. As a result, few studies have investigated how the curriculum has been influenced by teacher knowledge or have compared primary and secondary teacher knowledge. Furthermore, in order to provide a seamless grade one to ten science syllabus it is necessary to compare primary and secondary teacher beliefs and practices {{to determine whether or not}} the beliefs and practices held by these two groups of teachers is similar or dissimilar and how these beliefs and practices in turn, impact on the implementation of a curriculum. The research adopted Eisner's (1991) methodology of educational criticism and used a comparative case study approach to investigate the teacher knowledge of four primary and three secondary teachers. Data were presented as a dialogue between three composite characters, a lower primary, a middle/upper primary and a secondary teacher. The results revealed that teachers utilised three <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>beliefs</b> to shape the implementation of the science curriculum. These were categorised as expressed, entrenched and manifested beliefs. The primary and secondary teachers did possess similar <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>beliefs</b> and knowledge bases but their strategies for implementation in some instances were different. Furthermore, these <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>beliefs</b> and knowledge bases served as motivator or an inhibitor to teach science in the manner that they did. A theoretical model was developed to explain how these <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>beliefs</b> influenced the curriculum.

500|$|The various {{alternatives}} to Darwinian evolution {{by natural selection}} were not necessarily mutually exclusive. The evolutionary philosophy of the American palaeontologist Edward Drinker Cope {{is a case in}} point. Cope, a religious man, began his career denying the possibility of evolution. In the 1860s, he accepted that evolution could occur, but, influenced by Agassiz, rejected natural selection. Cope accepted instead the theory of recapitulation of evolutionary history during the growth of the embryo - that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny, which Agassiz believed showed a divine plan leading straight up to man, in a pattern revealed both in embryology and palaeontology. Cope did not go so far, seeing that evolution created a branching tree of forms, as Darwin had suggested. Each evolutionary step was however non-random: the direction was determined in advance and had a regular pattern (orthogenesis), and steps were not adaptive but part of a divine plan (theistic evolution). This left unanswered the question of why each step should occur, and Cope switched his theory to accommodate functional adaptation for each change. Still rejecting natural selection as the cause of adaptation, Cope turned to Lamarckism to provide the force guiding evolution. Finally, Cope supposed that Lamarckian use and disuse operated by causing a vitalist growth-force substance, [...] "bathmism", to be concentrated in the areas of the body being most intensively used; in turn, it made these areas develop {{at the expense of the}} rest. Cope's complex <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>beliefs</b> thus assembled five evolutionary philosophies: recapitulationism, orthogenesis, theistic evolution, Lamarckism, and vitalism. Other palaeontologists and field naturalists continued to hold beliefs combining orthogenesis and Lamarckism until the modern synthesis in the 1930s.|$|E
