40|$|Abstract. In Australia, as elsewhere, {{there is}} a growing need for {{information}} relating to <b>soil</b> <b>condition,</b> its current status, and the nature and direction of change in response to management pressures. This information is required by land managers, and regional, State and, national agencies to inform modified land-use practices and investment to maintain and improve the soil resource. Here, we present data relating to soils under 3 land-use types at 6 properties the north-western slopes of New South Wales. We aimed to quantify the range of <b>soil</b> <b>condition</b> states that exist across the region and to test a range of potential <b>soil</b> <b>condition</b> indicators and their suitability to detect differences in <b>soil</b> <b>condition</b> between these land-use types. A range of soil properties showed no significant difference between land-uses and could be rejected as indicators. However, significant differences existed between the land-uses and soil depths for a range of the other soil parameter...|$|R

By 2008, 69species of plant had been found on Surtsey, of which about 30 had become established. This compares to the approximately 490 species found on mainland Iceland. More species continue to arrive, at a typical rate of roughly 2–5new species per year.|$|E

40|$|Soil {{fertility}} depletion in smallholder agricultural {{systems in}} sub-Saharan Africa presents a formidable challenge both for food production and environmental sustainability. A critical constraint to managing soils in sub-Saharan Africa is poor targeting of soil management interventions. This is {{partly due to}} lack of diagnostic tools for screening <b>soil</b> <b>condition</b> that would lead to a robust and repeatable spatially explicit case definition of poor <b>soil</b> <b>condition.</b> The objectives of this study were to: (i) evaluate the ability of near infrared spectroscopy to detect changes in soil properties across a forest-cropland chronosequence; and (ii) develop a heuristic scheme for the application of infrared spectroscopy as a tool for case definition and diagnostic screening of <b>soil</b> <b>condition</b> for agricultural and environmental management. Soil reflectance was measured for 582 topsoil samples collected from forest-cropland chronosequence age classes namely; forest, recently converted, RC (17 years) and historically converted, HC (ca. 70 years). 130 randomly selected samples were used to calibrate soil properties to soil reflectance using partial least-squares regression (PLSR). 64 randomly selected samples were withheld for validation. A proportional odds logistic model was applied to chronosequence age classes and 10 principal components of spectral reflectance to determine three <b>soil</b> <b>condition</b> classes namely; “good”, “average” and “poor” for 194 samples. Discriminant analysis was applied to classify the remaining 388 “unknown” samples into <b>soil</b> <b>condition</b> classes using the 194 samples as a training set. Validation r 2 values were: total C, 0. 91; total N, 0. 90; effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC), 0. 90; exchangeable Ca, 0. 85; clay content, 0. 77; silt content, 0. 77 exchangeable Mg, 0. 76; soil pH, 0. 72; and K, 0. 64. A spectral based definition of “good”, “average” and “poor” <b>soil</b> <b>condition</b> classes provided a basis for an explicitly quantitative case definition of poor or degraded soils. Estimates of probabilities of membership of a sample in a spectral <b>soil</b> <b>condition</b> class presents an approach for probabilistic risk-based assessments of <b>soil</b> <b>condition</b> over large spatial scales. The study concludes that reflectance spectroscopy is rapid and offers the possibility for major efficiency and cost saving, permitting spectral case definition to define poor or degraded soils, leading to better targeting of management interventions...|$|R

In order to study the changes of <b>soil</b> <b>condition</b> associated with disk tillage and to assess it is consequences, long-term tillage field experiments with different levels of nutrients were set up in 1991 (A) and in 1994 (B) on Chromic Luvisol at Gödöllö.

40|$|Recently, the {{widespread}} interest on soil enzymes {{is due to}} the need to develop sensitive indicators of soil quality that reflect the effects of land management on soil and assist land managers in promoting long-term sustainability of terrestrial ecosystems. The activities of six important enzymes involved in C, N, P, and S cycling were investigated in a paddy soil from the Veneto region, Italy, in four different rotation systems (rice-rice-rice, soya-rice-rice, fallow-rice and pea-soya-rice) with three replications in April (after field preparation, field moist condition), June (after seedling, waterlogged <b>soil</b> <b>condition),</b> August (after tillering stage of rice, waterlogged <b>soil</b> <b>condition)</b> and October (after rice harvesting, drained <b>soil</b> <b>condition)</b> over the 2012 growing season. Our results demonstrated that soil enzyme activities varied with rotation systems and growth stages in paddy ﬁeld.

5|$|It also tolerates {{a variety}} of <b>soil</b> <b>conditions.</b> Although young {{specimens}} perform best when planted {{in a mixture of}} peat and either sand or perlite, P.atriplicifolia can thrive in sandy, chalky, or loamy soil, or heavy clay soil with sufficient drainage. It can endure a wide range of soil pH, as well as exposure to salty conditions near oceans. Its deep-feeding taproot makes it especially drought tolerant; for this reason it has seen wide use for xeriscaping in the Intermountain West. Overwatering and over-fertilization can damage its roots and lead to a rapid decline in health. P.atriplicifolia is otherwise generally free from plant pathogens. In cultivation, it is also rarely selected as forage by grazing animals, and so is considered both a deer-resistant and rabbit-resistant plant.|$|E

5|$|Several {{species of}} fungi infect {{the roots of}} waratahs, causing {{significant}} plant morbidity or death. Typical symptoms include yellow leaves, wilting, blackening and dieback or part {{or all of the}} plant, or lack of proteoid roots.

Mass plantings at the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney and at Mount Annan planted before the 2000 Summer Olympics were devastated by the disease. Rhizoctonia solani can cause damping off or root rot, and is an uncommon pathogen. Cylindrocarpon scoparium and C. destructans (now Nectria radicicola) are also uncommon causes of infection and result in decay of the crown of the plant.
