5|$|Shale oil {{extraction}} process decomposes oil shale and converts its kerogen into shale oila petroleum-like <b>synthetic</b> <b>crude</b> <b>oil.</b> The process is conducted by pyrolysis, hydrogenation, or thermal dissolution. The efficiencies of extraction processes are often evaluated by comparing their yields {{to the results}} of a Fischer Assay performed on a sample of the shale.|$|E
5|$|Oil shale {{has been}} used for {{industrial}} purposes since the early 17th century, when it was mined for its minerals. Since the late 19th century, shale oil has also been used for its oil content and as a low grade fuel for power generation. However, barring countries having significant oil shale deposits, its use for power generation is not particularly widespread. Similarly, oil shale is a source for production of <b>synthetic</b> <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> and it is seen as a solution towards increasing domestic production of oil in countries that are reliant on imports.|$|E

25|$|Because of the {{difficulty}} of moving crude bitumen through pipelines, non-upgraded bitumen is usually diluted with natural-gas condensate in a form called dilbit or with <b>synthetic</b> <b>crude</b> <b>oil,</b> called synbit. However, to meet international competition, much non-upgraded bitumen is now sold as a blend of multiple grades of bitumen, conventional crude oil, <b>synthetic</b> <b>crude</b> <b>oil,</b> and condensate in a standardized benchmark product such as Western Canadian Select. This sour, heavy crude oil blend is designed to have uniform refining characteristics to compete with internationally marketed heavy oils such as Mexican Mayan or Arabian Dubai Crude.|$|E

40|$|This effort {{summarizes}} the work performed on a steam cooled, rich-burn primary zone, variable geometry combustor designed for combustion of nitrogeneous fuels such as heavy <b>oils</b> or <b>synthetic</b> <b>crude</b> <b>oils.</b> The steam cooling {{was employed to}} determine its feasibility and assess its usefulness {{as part of a}} ground based gas turbine bottoming cycle. Variable combustor geometry was employed to demonstrate its ability to control primary and secondary zone equivalence ratios and overall pressure drop. Both concepts proved to be highly successful in achieving their desired objectives. The steam cooling reduced peak liner temperatures to less than 800 K. This low temperature offers the potential of both long life and reduced use of strategic materials for liner fabrication. These degrees of variable geometry were successfully employed to control air flow distribution within the combustor. A variable blade angle axial flow air swirler was used to control primary zone air flow, while the secondary and tertiary zone air flows were controlled by rotating bands which regulated air flow to the secondary zone quench holes and the dilutions holes respectively...|$|R
25|$|The {{first step}} in {{upgrading}} is vacuum distillation to separate the lighter fractions. After that, de-asphalting is used to separate the asphalt from the feedstock. Cracking is used to break the heavier hydrocarbon molecules down into simpler ones. Since cracking produces products which are rich in sulfur, desulfurization {{must be done to}} get the sulfur content below 0.5% and create sweet, light <b>synthetic</b> <b>crude</b> <b>oil.</b>|$|E
25|$|Heavy crude oil, {{which is}} much more viscous than {{conventional}} crude oil, and tar sands, where bitumen is found mixed with sand and clay, are becoming more important as sources of fossil fuel. Oil shale and similar materials are sedimentary rocks containing kerogen, a complex mixture of high-molecular weight organic compounds, which yield <b>synthetic</b> <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> when heated (pyrolyzed). These materials have yet to be exploited commercially. These fuels can be employed in internal combustion engines, fossil fuel power stations and other uses.|$|E
25|$|When {{the first}} oil sands plants were built over 50 years ago, most oil {{refineries}} in their market area {{were designed to}} handle light or medium crude oil with lower sulfur content than the 4â€“7% that is typically found in bitumen. The original oil sands upgraders were designed to produce a high-quality <b>synthetic</b> <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> (SCO) with lower density and lower sulfur content. These are large, expensive plants which are much like heavy oil refineries. Research is currently being done on designing simpler upgraders which do not produce SCO but simply treat the bitumen to reduce its viscosity, allowing to be transported unblended like conventional heavy oil.|$|E

40|$|Simulation {{study has}} shown oil {{production}} is accelerated when propane {{is used as}} an additive during steam injection. To better understand this phenomenon, distillation experiments were performed using San Ardo <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> (12 oAPI). For comparison purposes, three distillation processes were investigated: dry-, steam-, and steam-propanedistillation, the latter at the propane-to-steam mass ratio of 0. 05 at steam injection rate 0. 5 g/min. Two sets of the distillation experiments were carried out. In {{the first set of}} experiments, the distillation temperatures ranged from 115 ????C to 300 ????C. Distillation pressures ranged from 0 psig to 998 psig for steam- and steam-propane distillation. The temperature-pressure combination used represented 15 ????C superheated steam conditions. In the second set of experiments, the distillation temperatures ranged from 220 oC to 300 oC at 260 psig. The temperature pressure combination used represented field conditions for <b>crude</b> <b>oil.</b> For both conditions, the cell was kept at each temperature plateau (cut) until no increase occurs in distillation yields. Distillation yields were collected at each cut, and the volume and weight of water and hydrocarbon measured. Based on these experiments, a thermodynamic modeling framework was developed that describes distillation effect and oil production for steam distillation experiments. The model is based on composition of <b>crude</b> <b>oil,</b> molecular weight of heavy fraction. The analytical model results are compared against the experimental data for <b>synthetic</b> <b>crude</b> and <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> to verify the validity of the model. Main results of the study may be summarized as follows. The yields for steam distillation for saturated conditions of Tsat+ 15 o C and Psat is 10 % and with addition of 5 % of propane to steam no significant increase occurs in distillation yields. The yields for steam distillation for field conditions of 260 psig and temperature range (220 ~ 300 oC) is 18 % and with addition of 5 % of propane to steam no significant increase in distillation yields. The results indicate that propane has minimal distillation effect on the heavy oil. This occurs possibly because of lesser amount of light fractions in the heavy oil that enhance the separation of components in the oil caused by the concentration gradient...|$|R
25|$|Discontinuous sand bodies at {{the base}} of the McMurray Formation in the Athabasca Oil Sands region of northeastern Alberta, Canada, are {{commonly}} referred to as the Basal Water Sand (BWS) aquifers. Saturated with water, they are confined beneath impermeable bitumen-saturated sands that are exploited to recover bitumen for <b>synthetic</b> <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> production. Where they are deep-lying and recharge occurs from underlying Devonian formations they are saline, and where they are shallow and recharged by meteoric water they are non-saline. The BWS typically pose problems for the recovery of bitumen, whether by open-pit mining or by in situ methods such as steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD), and in some areas they are targets for waste-water injection.|$|E
25|$|Modernized and new large {{refineries}} such as {{are found}} in the Midwestern United States and on the Gulf Coast of the United States, as well as many in China, can handle upgrading heavy oil themselves, so their demand is for non-upgraded bitumen and extra-heavy oil rather than SCO. The main problem is that the feedstock would be too viscous to flow through pipelines, so unless it is delivered by tanker or rail car, it must be blended with diluent to enable it to flow. This requires mixing the crude bitumen with a lighter hydrocarbon diluent such as condensate from gas wells, pentanes and other light products from oil refineries or gas plants, or <b>synthetic</b> <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> from oil sands upgraders to allow it to flow through pipelines to market.|$|E
25|$|In the Canadian oil sands, bitumen {{produced}} by surface mining is generally upgraded on-site and delivered as <b>synthetic</b> <b>crude</b> <b>oil.</b> This makes delivery {{of oil to}} market through conventional oil pipelines quite easy. On the other hand, bitumen {{produced by}} the in-situ projects is generally not upgraded but delivered to market in raw form. If the agent used to upgrade the bitumen to synthetic crude is not produced on site, it must be sourced elsewhere and transported {{to the site of}} upgrading. If the upgraded crude is being transported from the site by pipeline, and additional pipeline will be required to bring in sufficient upgrading agent. The costs of production of the upgrading agent, the pipeline to transport it and the cost to operate the pipeline must be calculated into the production cost of the synthetic crude.|$|E

25|$|The Canadian Energy Research Institute (CERI) {{performed}} an analysis, estimating that in 2012 the average plant gate costs (including 10% profit margin, but excluding blending and transport) of primary recovery was $30.32/bbl, of SAGD was $47.57/bbl, of mining and upgrading was $99.02/bbl, and of mining without upgrading was $68.30/bbl. Thus, {{all types of}} oil sands projects except new mining projects with integrated upgraders {{were expected to be}} consistently profitable from 2011 onward, provided that global oil prices remained favourable. Since the larger and more sophisticated refineries preferred to buy raw bitumen and heavy oil rather than <b>synthetic</b> <b>crude</b> <b>oil,</b> new oil sands projects avoided the costs of building new upgraders. Although primary recovery such as is done in Venezuela is cheaper than SAGD, it only recovers about 10% of the oil in place versus 60% or more for SAGD and over 99% for mining.
