Depending on how additives affect trace, they may be added at light trace, medium trace, or heavy trace. After much stirring, the mixture turns to the consistency of a thin pudding. [...] "Trace" [...] corresponds roughly to viscosity. Essential oils and fragrance oils can be added with the initial soaping oils, but solid additives such as botanicals, herbs, oatmeal, or other additives are most commonly added at light trace, just as the mixture starts to thicken.|$|E

50|$|An {{immersion}} blender, <b>stick</b> <b>blender,</b> wand blender, hand blender, or Bermixer (after {{the brand}} name of professional models made by Dito-Electrolux) is a kitchen blade grinder used to blend ingredients or purée food in the container {{in which they are}} being prepared. Larger immersion blenders for commercial use are sometimes nicknamed boat motors (popularized by Emeril Lagasse and Alton Brown). Uses include puréeing soups and emulsifying sauces.|$|E
50|$|The {{hand-held}} immersion {{blender or}} <b>stick</b> <b>blender</b> has no container of its own, but instead has a mixing head with rotating blades {{that can be}} immersed in a container. Immersion blenders are convenient for homogenizing volumes that are too large to fit {{in the bowl of}} a stationary blender or, as in the case of soups, are too hot to be safely poured into the bowl.|$|E
50|$|A <b>stick</b> <b>blender</b> {{comprises}} {{an electric}} motor driving rotating cutting blades {{at the end of}} a shaft which can be immersed in the food being blended, inside a housing which can be held by hand. Some can be used while a pan is on the stove. Immersion blenders are distinguished from worktop blenders and food processors that require food to be placed in a special vessel for processing. They are distinguished from hand mixers, which mix but do not chop.|$|E
