50|$|With {{the slogan}} “The challenger“, the HATZ 1B-series was {{presented}} in 1996, showing a number of technical highlights. In a minimum of space, all the important functional components of the engine such as decompression device, injection pump drive, oil pump with oil pump pressure regulator, valve train system for inlet and outlet <b>valve,</b> governor, speed <b>control</b> <b>lever</b> with governor spring and the multi-functional mechanical control system are integrated in the governor housing. Due to these technical features, the B-series scores with a light-weight and compact design.Depending on their cylinder capacity, the air-cooled one-cylinder diesel engines of B-series are available at power ranges from 1.5 to 7.6 kW and a maximum speed of 3600 rpm. Furthermore, models with vertical or horizontal crankshaft are available. The B-series complies with the strict requirements of EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) Tier IV final in the US.|$|R

40|$|One {{of the key}} {{enabling}} technologies required for successful commercialization of displacement controlled (DC) systems are the appropriate variable displacement pumps. This thesis aims to fill the current gap in literature {{with respect to the}} performance requirements of pumps used in DC systems as well as create a methodology to ensure a compact, low power, and low cost pump adjustment system design. This research looks both at the design considerations with respect to the individual components and the system as a whole. Also {{for the first time a}} measurement based approach is taken to specify the dynamic requirements of DC pumps. ^ Looking at the components a new sensor technology is presented including initial proof of concept measurements. The ideal valve configuration is presented as a slightly underlapped 3 position 4 port valve. Also a detailed qualitative analysis is presented about the swash plate centering mechanism showing which general configuration best meets the criteria for DC pumps considering compactness and performance. ^ With respect to the complete system a detailed hydraulic and kinematic model is presented. This model is used in a full factorial design of experiments to discover the system effects of sizing the <b>control</b> <b>valve,</b> <b>control</b> cylinder, <b>lever</b> arm and <b>control</b> pressure associated with the adjustment system. Additionally a methodology for sizing coupled components to satisfy pump response, pump power, and pump size requirements is detailed along with a general case study. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{operators}} {{working in}} the unit {{at the time of}} the incident were unable to reach manual <b>shut-off</b> <b>valves</b> that would have isolated the damaged section from a fuel source. A remotely operated <b>shut-off</b> <b>valve</b> was located between the damaged section and the storage tanks but not between the damaged section and the distillation column. In addition, the pumps were controlled from a local control station that was also inaccessible. The pumps were eventually shut down from the central control building but there was not a remote shutdown control for the pumps in the central control room. Isolating the damaged section via a remotely operated valve upstream of the pumps could have ended the incident prior to ignition of the vapor cloud and would have definitely reduced the severity of the situation.|$|R

40|$|Spring related {{pressure}} relief valves, mounted at ambient temperature, are {{state of the}} art to protect cryogenic apparatuses and installations against excessive pressure. However experiences shows limitations in applications on cryogenic pressure vessels: Set pressure varies in a wide range, unauthorized increase of set pressure, seat not tight etc. Alternatively, in some applications, spring related relief valves with cold seating, so called “Quench Relief Valves” (QRV) are used. Beside their relief function further functionalities like tight seating for system isolation as well as shut-off function for bypass precooling may be requested. So QRV’s shall be used in parallel to a cold or warm bursts disc at higher set pressure because of its rules non-conformity. There are also {{pressure relief}} valves with warm seat available on which the set pressure is based on an adjustment of forces by permanent magnets. Pressure vessel rules allows also the choice for an active triggered pressure relief <b>valve</b> (<b>Controlled</b> Safety Pressure Relief Systems, CSPRS) e. g. with a fast opening cryogenic <b>shut-off</b> <b>valve.</b> Valve and its switching and control components used for such a smart relief design should fulfil similar reliability requests to qualify for use in SIL 3 applications. For mechanical devices functional qualification tests at service conditions are to be considered. Mechanical design and function of such pressure relief valves will be shown and discussed considering its limitations regarding applications of pressure vessel rules...|$|R
