40|$|Abstract: Rectal temperature, {{pulse and}} {{respiratory}} rate dynamics and body weight changes were studied in two tooth fine wool sheep kept in barn and shorn at different {{time of the}} year. The sheep from the experimental group were shorn in February and the control ones – in May. A considerable decrease (P< 0, 01) in the daily gain was observed during the first weeks after winter shearing compared to pre shearing period and to unshorn controls but later on the growth rate was higher in the <b>shorn</b> <b>sheep.</b> The remarkable fall (P< 0, 01) in rectal temperature following the winter shearing persisted for two more months and recovered to pre shearing level in May. Similar decrease in rectal temperature after fleece removal was found in sheep shorn in May. Pulse rate increased after winter shearing (P< 0, 001) and recovered to pre shearing level by the third month after shearing. Shearing was found to reduce respiratory rate (P< 0, 01) in winter and spring <b>shorn</b> <b>sheep</b> but a significant increase (P< 0, 01) was registered in both group in May. The results suggest that energy expenditure shortly after shearing predominated over the energy intake independently {{of the level of}} feed intake, which resulted in reduced growth rate and activation of the compensatory mechanisms for saving the body heat.

40|$|With {{a view to}} {{comparing}} {{previous findings}} from experimental journeys, with observations during commercial transport of sheep, hormonal and other physiological data were gathered during three long journeys (866 to 1178 km) all of which involved a sea crossing (1 h 45 min to 8 h 55 min). One was a commercial journey from the UK to continental Europe and the other two, which were simulated commercial journeys {{under the control of}} the investigators, were from a Scottish island to Cambridge. In all journeys there was a break in lairage (duration 13 to 24 h). The stocking rate on the commercial journey (0. 17 m 2 per sheep for <b>shorn</b> <b>sheep</b> of 35 to 37 kg body weight) was less generous than previously used in experimental journeys. In all journeys there was an apparent increase in plasma concentration of cortisol soon after loading and commencement of travel, with subsequent decline. Transient increases in beta-endorphin and prolactin were also observed but changes in creatine kinase were not obvious. Haematocrit showed slight evidence of a decline during the journeys. These findings are generally similar to those obtained in experimental journeys and there was no evidence of a hormonal response to sea conditions during the ferry crossings. When transport was resumed after a period of rest with food and water off the vehicle, the physiological responses were less marked than they had been during the first stage of the journey. Under the circumstances observed, long journeys of the type commonly practised commercially probably do not of themselves pose a major welfare challenge...|$|E

40|$|The {{relation}} between {{environment and the}} water intake and output of young Merino sheep living in the hot dry tropics on lat. 21 ° S. has been studied for 3 years. The tip wool of sheep standing in the sun heats to 189 °F by absorption of radiant energy, most of which is re-radiated. Wool, especially when {{it is more than}} 3 cm long, assists in protecting sheep from radiant energy. The respiratory rates of <b>sheep</b> <b>shorn</b> during summer were more than twice those of unshorn sheep standing in the sun. On the open plains summer shearing appears to add to the thermal strain. Acclimatizing sheep respired more rapidly in the sun than tropical sheep. Evaporative cooling, by panting, increases water demand, and in summer Merinos drank on the average 12 times as much water as in winter, when they took 7. 3 ml/kg/day.

In the second year, {{half of the}} ewes were mated and lice were counted at 26 body sites on the resulting lambs. Polypay ewes had higher densities of lice than Columbias at most inspections {{but there was little}} effect of infestationpoint or mating on either numbers or the distribution of lice. During periods of high louse numbers densities were generally greatest on the sides or the back. Densities on the head were also high at times and peaked later than overall louse densities.

The distribution of lice on the lambs was similar to that on the ewes except that fewer lice were found on the head. Comparisons of lice per part with the numbers of lice extracted from clipped patches indicated that a sheep with wool bearing area of 1 m 2 and a mean count of one louse per 10 cm fleece parting carried approximately 2000 lice.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effects of severe extreme thermal stress on the respiratory rate (panting) of unsheared and sheared rams in standing and lying position, and to analyse two temperature-humidity indices (THIs). Six mature Australian Merino rams from Northern Patagonia, three unshorn and three shorn, were subjected to 40 hours (8 hours each day for five days) of gradual increase in temperature from 25 °C to 40 °C, guaranteeing 4 h daily at 40 °C in a heat chamber. Respiratory rate (RR) was registered continuously by counting flank movements, and the ambient air temperature and relative humidity were recorded every five minutes inside the heat chamber. From 1413 RR measurements, descriptive and modelling analyses were performed. Panting as a response variable was distributed into five categories, and fixed effects such as THI, wool (unshorn/shorn), and position (standing/lying) were considered. No significant differences were observed between the panting score in the unshorn (standing or lying) and standing (unshorn or <b>shorn)</b> <b>sheep,</b> but significant differences were observed in shorn and lying rams. The explanations could be that heat production from muscle activity was lower and the transfer and heat lost by conduction to the floor was easier in the rams with shorter fleece (at least 0. 7 inches long). However, in the unshorn rams, their wool acted as an insulator, both with air as well as the floor. Australian Merino rams from Northern Patagonia are heat tolerant to an environment between 31. 5 °C and 42 °C, and 32 % to 48 % humidity for 40 hours over five days. The rams were in the first phase of panting, and the normal rectal temperatures registered daily when leaving the heat chamber confirmed that regulation of body temperature was possible. The LPHSI’s THI was adjusted to improve the analysis of the RR more than the National Research Council’s THI...|$|E
40|$|Concern for {{the welfare}} of export lambs during long-distance road {{transport}} has prompted much research and a recommended change in procedure. The latter envisages an absolute maximum journey time of 31 h and includes a rest-stop (minimum duration 1 h) for feeding and watering. In the present experiment, the physiological and behavioural responses to this new protocol have been investigated in fleeced and shorn lambs (no. = 10 per group) provided with venous catheters and heart rate monitors. The two groups were loaded on a vehicle into separate adjacent pens and driven for 14 h; then unloaded into a lairage, where their behaviour was recorded. After 1 h they were reloaded and driven for a further 15 • 5 h, finally arriving at a slaughterhouse where carcass condition was evaluated. Blood samples collected at 30 - or 60 -min intervals by experimenters travelling with the animals were analysed to determine haematocrit, plasma osmolality, plasma concentrations of glucose, creatinine phosphokinase (CPK), and the stress-responsive hormones, cortisol, prolactin, adrenaline and noradrenaline. The results showed that haematocrit increased after loading although the general trend during transport, as with osmolality, was a decline (P < 0 • 05). No significant changes in plasma glucose were detected but CPK increased in fleeced lambs after loading (P < 0 • 05). Cortisol release was stimulated by loading, especially in fleeced sheep (P < 0 • 001) but returned to home pen values within 6 h; heart rates changed in a similar manner. Transport did not markedly affect prolactin release although concentrations were consistently greater in fleeced sheep (P < 0 • 001). Noradrenaline, however, tended to be higher in shorn animals (P < 0 • 05). In lairage, both groups readily consumed hay, and especially concentrates, but the shorn lambs spent more time eating (P < 0 • 001). None of the <b>shorn</b> <b>sheep,</b> and only a few fleeced animals, drank water. There was no evidence for differences in weight loss between the two groups during the experiment and carcass quality at slaughter was within the normal expected range.

40|$|Agricultural {{research}} funding organisations, such as Wools of New Zealand (WONZ), are seeking ways to maximise benefits from their research portfolio. It {{has been suggested}} that this can be achieved by reducing investment in on-farm research and increasing investment in post-farm gate research on processing technology, product development and market research. However, little information exists to substantiate this point-of-view, and this gave rise to the research reported in this thesis. The hypotheses tested were first, that the return on the investment made by Wools of New Zealand in research on cover comb technology was positive and comparable to the return on other investment options, and second, that a model for the ex ante economic analysis of on-farm research could be developed using an ex post economic analysis of cover comb shearing technology research. The cover comb {{is an example of a}} discrete, relatively simple technology, whose development, research evaluation and extension have been reasonably well documented. Six experiments, funded jointly by Massey University and WONZ, were conducted with the cover comb at Massey University between 1989 and 1995. Most extension costs were incurred by WONZ. The cover comb generates financial advantages to farmers by reducing sheep losses and possibly by conserving pasture when the feed supply is low. Uptake of the cover comb was estimated by surveying shearing contractors and Wool Production Officers, and from the pattern of cover comb sales. A spreadsheet model was developed to provide an ex post cost-benefit analysis of cover comb shearing technology research and extension for the period 1989 to 2020. This model included a sub-model of regional populations by class to estimate the number of <b>sheep</b> <b>shorn</b> by different methods, and a cost-benefit sub-model that described the temporal relationship between costs and benefits and calculated the returns. The model estimated a 1330 % internal rate of return (IRR), a $ 49. 22 million net present value (NPV) and a 115 : 1 benefit-cost ratio (BCR) for the cover comb research and extension investment at a 5 % discount rate. The model outputs were sensitive to the post-shearing reduction in sheep losses associated with cover comb use (and therefore benefits per sheep) and the cover comb adoption rate. A sensitivity analysis indicated a 485 % IRR, a $ 12. 30 million NPV and a 25. 3 : 1 BCR at a lower adoption rate (an increase in <b>sheep</b> <b>shorn</b> with a cover comb between 1989 and 2000 due to the research and extension, of 9. 5 % of all adult sheep in New Zealand, versus an increase of 12. 9 %), a lower net benefit per sheep ($ 0. 23 per ewe shorn versus $ 0. 47 per ewe shorn) and a 10 % discount rate. Thus, even where conservative values for the cover comb technology were applied, a very favourable return on the investment made by WONZ was shown. The rapid uptake of the cover comb (over 30 % of ewes shorn were shorn in 1995 with a cover comb, compared to 15 % of ewes in 1989), and the size of the industry (33. 7 million ewes in 1995) the technology is applied to contributed to these returns. The ex post cost-benefit analysis model could be adapted for ex ante evaluations of proposed on-farm wool industry research. This model would be useful for deciding which sheep production research should be funded...|$|R
60|$|When {{once the}} settler was housed against the weather, {{he had the}} {{conditions}} of a certain rude comfort indoors. If his cabin was not proof against the wind and rain or snow, its vast fireplace formed the means of heating, while the forest was an inexhaustible store of fuel. At first he dressed in the skins and pelts of the deer and fox and wolf, and his costume could have varied little {{from that of the}} red savage about him, for we often read how' he mistook Indians for white men at first sight, and how the Indians in their turn mistook white men for their own people. The whole family went barefoot in the summer, but in winter the pioneer wore moccasins of buckskin, and buckskin leggins or trousers; his coat was a hunting shirt belted at the waist and fringed where it fell to his knees. It was of homespun, a mixture of wool and flax called linsey-woolsey, and out of this the dresses of his wife and daughters were made; the wool was <b>shorn</b> from the <b>sheep,</b> which were so scarce that they were never killed for their flesh, except by the wolves, which were very fond of mutton, but had no use for wool. For a wedding dress a cotton check was thought superb, and it really cost a dollar a yard; silks, satins, laces, were unknown. A man never left his house without his rifle; the gun was a part of his dress, and in his belt he carried a hunting knife and a hatchet; on his head he wore a cap of squirrel skin, often with the plumelike tail dangling from it.|$|R
