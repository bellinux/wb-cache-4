40|$|Different soil types can {{significantly}} affect {{the composition of}} wine grapes and the final wine product. In this study, the effects of soil types on the composition of Cabernet Sauvignon grapes and wine produced in the Helan Mountains were evaluated. Three different representative soil types [...] aeolian, <b>sierozem</b> and irrigation silting soil were studied. The compositions of grapes and wines were measured, and in addition, the weights of 100 -berry samples were determined. The grapes that grown on the aeolian and <b>sierozem</b> soils matured sooner than those grown on the irrigation silting soil. The highest sugar content, total soluble solids content, sugar to acid ratio and anthocyanin content {{were found in the}} grapes that grown on the aeolian soil. The wine produced from this soil had improved chroma and tone and higher-quality phenols. The grapes grown on the <b>sierozem</b> soil had the highest total phenol and tannin contents, which affected the wine composition. The grapes grown on the irrigation silting soil had higher acidities, but the remaining indices were lower. In addition, the grapes grown on the aeolian soil resulted in wines with better chroma and aroma. The <b>sierozem</b> soil was beneficial for the formation of wine tannins and phenols and significantly affected the wine composition. The quality of the grapes from the irrigation silting soil was relatively low, resulting in lower-quality wine...|$|E

40|$|Surveys of soil {{properties}} {{related to}} soil functioning for many regions of Kyrgyzstan are limited. This study established ranges of chemical (soil organic matter (SOM), pH and total N (TN)), physical (soil texture), and biochemical (six enzyme activities of C, N, P, and S cycling) characteristics for nine profiles from the Kukart watershed of Jalal-Abad region in Kyrgyzstan. These profiles represent different soil orders (Inceptisols, Alfisols, and Mollisols) and land uses (cultivated, nut-fruit forests, and pasture). The <b>Sierozem</b> (Inceptisols) soils {{had the highest}} pH and contained the lowest SOM and TN contents compared to the Brown, Black-brown, and Meadow-steppe soils (Alfisols and Mollisols). Enzymatic activities within surface horizons (0 – 18 [*]cm) typically decreased in the following order: forest > pasture > cultivated. Enzyme activity trends due to land use were present regardless of elevation, climate, and soil types although subtle differences among soil types within land use were observed. The significant reductions in measured soil enzyme activities involved in C, N, P, and S nutrient transformations under cultivation compared to pasture and forest ecosystems and lower values under Inceptisols can serve as soil quality indicators for land use decisions in the watershed...|$|E
40|$|The {{expansion}} of irrigated agriculture during the Soviet Union (SU) era made Central Asia a leading cotton production {{region in the}} world. However, the successor states of the SU in Central Asia face on-going environmental damages and soil degradation that are endangering the sustainability of agricultural production. With Landsat MSS and TM data from 1972 / 73, 1977, 1987, 1998, and 2000 the expansion and densification of the irrigated cropland could be reconstructed in the Kashkadarya Province of Uzbekistan, Central Asia. Classification trees were generated by interpreting multitemporal normalized difference vegetation index data and crop phenological knowledge. Assessments based on image-derived validation samples showed good accuracy. Official statistics {{were found to be}} of limited use for analyzing the plausibility of the results, because they hardly represent the area that is cropped in the very dry study region. The cropping area increased from 134, 800 ha in 1972 / 73 to 470, 000 ha in 2009. Overlaying a historical soil map illustrated that initially <b>sierozems</b> were preferred for irrigated agriculture, but later the less favorable solonchaks and solonetzs were also explored, illustrating the strategy of agricultural expansion in the Aral Sea Basin. Winter wheat cultivation doubled between 1987 and 1998 to approximately 211, 000 ha demonstrating its growing relevance for modern Uzbekistan. The spatial-temporal approach used enhances the understanding of natural conditions before irrigation is employed and supports decision-making for investments in irrigation infrastructure and land cultivation throughout the Landsat era...|$|R
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of heavy metal removal from soil by EDTA leaching was assessed {{in a column}} leaching experiment at the laboratory scale and field heap leaching at the pilot scale using a sandy loam <b>sierozem</b> agricultural soil contaminated with Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn. Soil amendment and aging were conducted to recover leaching soils. The percentages of Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn removed by column leaching were 90 %, 88 %, 90 %, and 67 %, respectively, when 3. 9 bed volumes of 50 mM EDTA were used. At the pilot scale, on-site metal removal efficiencies using the selected leaching procedure were 80 %, 69 %, 73 % and 62 % for Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn, respectively. EDTA leaching decreased soil CEC, total P, total K and available K concentrations but increased organic matter and total Kjeldahl N concentrations. The subsequent amendment and soil aging further reduced the DTPA-extractable heavy metals in the leached soils. Growth of the first crop of pak choi in the leached soil was inhibited but the second crop grew well after the soil was aged for one year and the concentrations of Cd and Pb in the edible parts were below the Chinese statutory limits. The results demonstrate the potential feasibility of the field leaching technique using EDTA combined with subsequent amendment and soil aging for the remediation of heavy metal-contaminated agricultural soils.

40|$|The soil carbon {{reservoir}} {{is the largest}} {{carbon reservoir}} in terrestrial ecosystems and consists of soil organic and inorganic carbon stocks. Previous studies have mainly focused on the soil organic carbon (SOC) stock, and limited information is available about the soil inorganic carbon (SIC) stock. The Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP), which {{is located in the}} arid and semi-arid region of China, is an important inorganic carbon reservoir, with a thick soil layer that is rich in calcium carbonate. However, there are few reports on the SIC stock and its spatial distribution in this region. In the current study, the SIC densities and stocks for various soil types and land use patterns were evaluated based on 495 profiles with 2470 soil samples across the CLP, which were collected from the Chinese Second National Soil Survey. The results showed that in the top 1 m of soil across the CLP, the average SIC density is 17. 04 kg/m(2), and the total SIC stock is approximately 10. 20 Pg C (1 Pg = 10 (15) g). The SIC stock of the CLP accounts for approximately 18. 4 % of the total SIC stock throughout China. The average values of the SIC stock in the 0 - 20, 20 - 50 and 50 - 100 cm depths of the CLP are 2. 39, 2. 92 and 4. 89 Pg, respectively. Under different land use patterns, the order of the average SIC density is farmland approximate to grassland > forest in all soil layers. For the various soil types, the SIC density in the 0 - 100 cm layer is the highest in alkaline soil and lowest in subalpine meadow soil, whereas the SIC stock is highest in loessial soil, eolian sandy soil and <b>sierozem,</b> and the lowest in subalpine meadow soil. These differences are largely a result of the area occupied by each soil type and the climate conditions. The results of this study provide basic information about carbon reservoir in China and contribute {{to our understanding of the}} SIC stock on the CLP as it relates to the carbon balance of terrestrial ecosystems.

40|$|An Intensive {{study of}} the {{applicability}} of mathematical methodology to the ordination and classification of desert vegetation was undertaken during 1962, 1963 and 1964. The study area, forming part of the shad-scale zone vegetation and covering 13. 5 square miles, is situated near Cisco in Grand County, southeastern Utah. Broad pediments originating from the nearby Book Cliffs are the main landform. Geologically, the area was subjected to many cycles of erosion. The pediment and the quaternary remnants thin out with increasing distance from the Book Cliffs. The alluvial fan deposits are readily recognizable at three distinct levels. Mancos shale, a lead-gray Cretaceous shale of marine origin, forms {{the lower part of}} the Book Cliffs. The alluvial fan deposits are readily recognizable at three distinct levels. Mancos shale, a lead-gray Cretaceous shale of marine origin, forms {{the lower part of the}} Book Cliffs and of the pediments originating from it. The vegetation consists of widely-spaced species in which the dominant shrub species belong to the genus Atriplex. The soils have characteristics of <b>Sierozem</b> zonal soils (Aridisols), are often heterogeneous even within short distances and edaphic influences are strong. In absence of any single over-riding factor, the erosion gradient provided the primary basis for the ordination of vegetation. The gradient is readily noticeable and is accompanied by edaphic and other micro-environmental changes. Four sub-divisions or segments can be easily distinguished. Each segment incorporates a degree of microenvironmental homogeneity and a distinct expression of vegetation in which the transition from the one to the next is usually abrupt. The dominant Atriplex species for each segment, I to IV, are Atriplex confertifolia, A. nuttallii gardneri, and A. Corrugata. The data on canopy over and frequency were collected for each species. The analyses attempted embraced a wide range of quantitative techniques, namely grouping of species on peak CF (sum of relative canopy cover and relative frequency) value; analysis based on frequency x constancy index; association analysis (among species) using coefficient of interspecific association, chi-square, and their combination; derivation of homogeneous group of vegetation based on presence of single species showing positive association; association analysis and group study based on the use of correlation coefficient; multivariable approaches to the ordination of vegetation employing factor analysis preceded by partition of the sparse data matrix and the Q- and R-techniques of cluster analysis. Prevalent and modal species were also determined for each segment. The study provided an excellent opportunity to compare and test the validity of results obtained from various analyses and also those that could be easily differentiated from inspection alone. The number and composition of groups derived showed considerable agreement in most cases, though slight variations were introduced inadvertently through subjective, and sometime inevitable, choice of qualitative and quantitative measures employed in particular analyses. The quantitative approach, with an obvious advantage over the reconnaissance methods, provided a judgement on the significance of similarities and dissimilarities. It also made it possible to detect small differences which were more indicative of pattern, rather than a type, within vegetation area studies. The multivariate techniques of cluster analysis (Q- and R-analyses) illustrated superiority over other methods in that the cluster relations among various entities were readily discernable at all levels of affinity from the hierarchical dendrograms. On the other hand, the techniques utilizing statistical tests of significance necessitate preparing a new dendrogram every time a change is desired in the choice of probability level for testing hypotheses. The analyses based on prevalent and modal species, and also those using peak values of CF and constancy x frequency indices, provided a quantitative measure of the habitat preference of component species. The quantitative approaches used in the study proved their usefulness and applicability, on the whole, to delimit accurate groups in the shadscale zone vegetation of Southeastern Utah. They also displayed a degree of flexibility, and sophistication, that may be needed in individual studies...|$|E
40|$|The and and {{semi-arid}} {{regions of}} the world, totalling about 30 % of the land surface of the earth, are predominantly used for extensive grazing, as low and erratic rainfall presents too high a risk for arable farming. The population that can be sustained by the animal products -meat, milk or wool- is largely determined by the availability of primary production for fodder. An increase in primary production in these areas is possible on two levels: - without irrigation: either {{by an increase in}} the amount of available water or by a more efficient use of the moisture. The first may be achieved by controlling run-off or deep drainage. The latter through improvement of the botanical composition, mainly by legumes or by application of nitrogen fertilizer; - with irrigation: when water and nutrients are non-limiting, very high production levels may be attained because the environmental conditions, radiation intensity, temperature and length of the growing season are favourable in these regions. This study was done {{within the framework of the}} project 'Actual and potential herbage production under and conditions'. This project aimed at summarizing existing knowledge on the functioning of agro-ecosystems in dynamic simulation models, describing plant growth under semi-arid conditions. Such models were developed on three levels of interest: - optimum supply with water and nutrients; - optimum supply of nutrients, but limited moisture; - conditions where either water or nutrients were the limiting factor. Validation data for the models were collected in the field and relevant processes were studied under controlled conditions. This book deals mainly with the different aspects of the relation between water use and plant production under moisture limiting conditions. The validation experiments were carried out at the Tadmor Experimental Farm in the northern Negev desert of Israel (34 ° 25 ' OL, 31 ° 22 ' NB. The average rainfall in this area is 250 mm year - 1, concentrated in winter (October-March); strong fluctuations between years occur with extremes of 42 mm in ' 61 /' 62 and 414 mm in ' 64 /' 65. Radiation intensity ranges from 1150 Jm - 2 day - 1 in December to 2750 Jm - 2 day - 1 in August, while average daytime temperatures range between 12. 6 °C in January and 26. 8 °C in August. The soil consists of a <b>sierozem,</b> developed in a 10 - 20 m thick mantle of löss. Its physical properties are favourable for plant growth: high water-holding capacity and low resistance to root growth. The vegetation is an abandoned crop land vegetation and consists mainly of herbaceous annuals. The predominant species are the grasses Phalaris minor, Hordeum murinum and Stipa capensis, the crucifers Erucaria boveana and Reboudia pinnata, the compositae Anthemis melaleuca and Centaurea iberica and the legumes Trigonella arabica and Medicago polymorpha. The actual botanical composition shows a great variation both in time and place but this hardly influences the production potential. Experiments were carried out to determine the course of above ground dry matter production and of available soil moisture during the growing season. Dry matter production was determined via a doublesampling technique of visual estimates. In each treatment 200 - 400 estimations were carried out and each fifth sample was also harvested and weighed. The harvested samples provide a calibration curve, which is used to give an estimate of the average yield of the field. Soil moisture was measured with the neutron moderation technique. In each treatment 30 - 60 aluminium access tubes were installed and soil moisture was measured over two-weekly periods and after sufficiently heavy showers in 30 cm intervals. The upper 30 cm of the soil were at the same time sampled for gravimetric determination of the moisture content. Meteorological observations were obtained from a standard weather station of the Israeli Meteorological Service, located in Gilat, about 8 km from the experimental site. Rainfall however was recorded in rain-gauges at the experimental site. The results of the experiments, which were carried out in the fields fertilized with P and K as well as in fields that received NPK fertilization show that under the prevailing conditions actual production is more often limited by nitrogen shortage than by moisture availability. Nitrogen application increased the production up to 2 - 3 fold. Maximum growth rates of the natural vegetation reached values of 170 kg ha - 1 day - 1 under optimum conditions. A local wheat variety, used in another experiment attained the same value, which is also equal to the theoretical optimum calculated for the conditions. The efficiency of water use was also the same for the wheat and for the natural vegetation. However the nitrogen deficient fields showed a much lower efficiency of water use, due to either a lower photosynthetic capacity or greater losses through continuous break-down and rebuilding of nitrogenous compounds. Experiments carried out to determine the influence of grazing on primary production showed that under normal grazing pressures, the consumption by animals during the growing season is negligible compared with the growth rates. Only heavy overgrazing may affect the level of primary production. The simulation model 'ARID CROP' developed in the second part of this study, written in the simulation language CSMP/ 360, describes crop growth under water limiting conditions. A hierarchical approach is applied to incorporate the various processes when their time constant is too small. A detailed model of evaporation from a bare soil is described and the results are compared with both laboratory and field measurements. A simplified procedure to calculate the water use efficiency on a daily basis is worked out, based on the results of a detailed model, described elsewhere. The calculated values are compared with the results of pot trials carried out in the framework of the project. In practically all cases the agreement is within 20 % which is considered reasonable in view of the assumptions. Validation of the model shows that reasonable agreement between measured and simulated values is obtained, both for above ground dry matter production and for soil moisture in spite of the limitations of the model. Special difficulties arise from the initialization due to the gross simplifications with regard to germination. Some examples for the application of the model have been described: potential production under moisture limiting conditions is calculated for a 15 -year period at the experimental site, based on historical weather data. Comparison with the measured yields shows that mostly actual production was limited by nitrogen availability. Fertilization would not only increase the average yield, but also the fluctuations to about the same range as the rainfall. Management problems will then arise as short- term adaptation of herd size is not possible. These may either be overcome by adaptation of the grazing pressure to some average production level so that food reserves may be build up in good years or by adjustment of the size of the herd to a smaller grazing area. Part of the total available area may be sown with small grain, which will yield seed in favourable years, and may be used as additional grazing area in unfavourable years. Another conclusion derived from this example is, that the distribution of the precipitation over the growing season is of equal importance for the production as the total amount of rainfall. An unfavourable pattern-many small showers-increases losses through direct soil evaporation and limits the amount of moisture available for plant growth. Finally it is shown that spatial inhomogeneity of the soil, which is so troublesome during experimentation counteracts the fluctuations described earlier, mainly through increase of production in unfavourable years. In conclusion it may be stated that the use of dynamic simulation models to establish the production potential of new areas is preferable to the application of correlation models. Simulation models provide a better insight into the relevant processes and have a much greater potential for extrapolation. Moreover they supply a useful tool for the design of relevant experiments when new regions have to be explored...|$|E
