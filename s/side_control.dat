5|$|Because of the {{initially}} {{broad definition}} of 12-6 elbows in the Unified Rules, referees often had differences in {{interpretation of what}} was classed as one. Referee Herb Dean differed from McCarthy's definition and argued that elbow strikes parallel with the floor in <b>side</b> <b>control</b> (sometimes called 9-3 elbows) were classed as 12-6 elbows, as he considered 12-6 elbows as being based on where the fighter throwing them was positioned.|$|E

30|$|ADMDM uses Apriori {{algorithm}} {{to convert}} captured connection records into traffic features. Apriori algorithm is a data mining technique, {{which represents the}} knowledge of dependency or correlation between a certain event and other events. Apriori analysis can help to discover the correlation between fields in recorded data. For instance, most of privacy theft Trojans contains a <b>controlling</b> <b>side</b> and a <b>controlled</b> <b>side</b> (Trojan <b>side).</b> The <b>controlling</b> <b>side</b> will send messages to the <b>controlled</b> <b>side</b> in real {{time in order to}} monitor the status of the <b>controlled</b> <b>side.</b> Heartbeat packages may have periodic behaviors or randomized behaviors, in order to avoid to be detected by the statistical analysis. Nevertheless, communication between the <b>controlling</b> <b>side</b> and the <b>controlled</b> <b>side</b> cannot be detected from a single TCP connection record. However, if we analyze similar TCP connections generated with the anomaly destination IP, within a certain period, these behaviors can be captured to detect Trojan.|$|R

25|$|While most fighters utilize ground-and-pound statically, by way {{of holding}} their opponents down and mauling them with short strikes from the top position, a few fighters manage to utilize it {{dynamically}} by striking their opponents while changing positions, thus not allowing their opponents to settle once they take them down. Cain Velasquez {{is one of the}} most devastating ground strikers in MMA. He attacks his opponents on the ground while transitioning between positions. Whether he's moving from mount to back mount or from turtle to <b>side</b> <b>control,</b> he is constantly landing shots. Fedor Emelianenko, considered the greatest master of ground-and-pound in MMA history, was the first to demonstrate this dynamic style of striking in transition. He was striking his opponents on the ground while passing guard or while his opponents were attempting to recover guard.|$|E

2500|$|Initially, {{the rulers}} of Europe viewed the 1789 {{revolution}} in France as an event between the French king and his subjects, and not something in which they should interfere. In 1790, Leopold succeeded his brother Joseph as emperor of the Holy Roman Empire and by 1791, the danger surrounding his sister, Marie Antoinette, and her children, alarmed him. In August 1791, in consultation with French émigré nobles and Frederick William II of Prussia, he issued the Declaration of Pilnitz declaring {{the interest of the}} monarchs of Europe as one with the interests of Louis and his family. He and his fellow monarchs threatened ambiguous, but serious, consequences if anything should happen to the royal family. The French émigrés continued to agitate for support of a counter-revolution abroad. On 20 April 1792, the French National Convention declared war on Austria. In this War of the First Coalition (1792–98), France ranged itself against most of the European states sharing land or water borders with her, plus Portugal and the Ottoman Empire. [...] Although initially successful in campaigns in 1792 and 1793, the French army lost some effectiveness during the Reign of Terror, as its generals were intimidated and/or executed, and {{more and more of the}} officers left France for safer havens. Elements of the armies that were later formed into the Army of Sambre and Meuse participated in the conquest of the Netherlands and the Siege of Luxembourg. [...] The various elements of the army won a key victory at the Battle of Fleurus on 16 June 1794. The merging of the forces into the Army of Sambre and Meuse was made official soon afterwards. Shortly after the French victory at Fleurus, the Coalition position in Flanders collapsed and the French armies overran both the Austrian Netherlands and the Dutch Republic in the winter of 17941795. [...] Subsequently, both French and Imperial military strategy focused on the Rhine river as the principle boundary of defense: for each <b>side,</b> <b>control</b> of the opposite bank, or at least the river's principal crossings, formed the key to defensive strategy.|$|E
