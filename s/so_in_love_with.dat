In my household, I didn't go all of the parties and I didn't {{do all the things}} {{that a lot of the}} other teenage girls did because I was <b>so</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> <b>with</b> my radio and my music. I was <b>so</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> <b>with</b> this radio and my parents were happy that I was into {{something}} positive.|$|E
500|$|Tom Kessenich, in {{his book}} Examinations, gave the episode a {{relatively}} positive review. He wrote, [...] "'Hollywood A.D.' was Duchovny's nudge-nudge, wink-wink writing-directing effort for this season. [...] Duchovny did not fail to deliver an episode that truly reflected his own wit and intelligence. All the while remaining true {{to the spirit of}} the show that made him famous." [...] Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B+", and wrote that it [...] "is muddled and frequently <b>so</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> <b>with</b> just being weird for weird’s sake that everybody forgets we need at least a little justification to pull everything together in the end." [...] He also called it [...] "a hard episode not to love, frankly." [...] Handlen felt that the humor and sweetness helped to make the episode a success. He also wrote that Mulder and Scully's dynamic worked towards the episode's favor.|$|E
500|$|Breeds {{acknowledged}} {{that from a}} musical stand point someone who inspires you creatively and acts as your muse, is a special bond. She attributed it to Liam's feelings for Ruby. Ruby and Liam continue to act a support unit for one another. As the scholarship develops they {{talk to each other}} about [...] "mature things that surpass a student-teacher relationship." [...] Liam later develops feelings for Bianca Scott (Lisa Gormley) and Ruby is seeing Liam slip from her grasp. Breeds said [...] "She sees them flirting and she has a moment where she realises that she's <b>so</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> <b>with</b> this guy and it's kind of now or never. She needs to take action." [...] True to Ruby's persona she does not preconceive her actions and Ruby feels she has to [...] "set the record straight and to give it a really good crack." [...] For Ruby it is a spontaneous, impromptu moment; [...] "She's just totally spilling out with feelings for him." ...|$|E

500|$|As the {{daughter}} of actor Jon Voight, Jolie appeared in the media from an early age. After embarking on her own career, she {{earned a reputation as}} a [...] "wild child," [...] which contributed to her early success in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Celebrity profiles routinely covered her fascination with blood and knives, experiences with drugs, and her sex life, particularly her bisexuality and interest in sadomasochism. In 2000, when asked about her outspokenness, she stated, [...] "I say things that other people might go through. That's what artists should do—throw things out there and not be perfect and not have answers for anything and see if people understand." [...] Another contributing factor of her controversial image were tabloid rumors of incest that started when Jolie, upon winning her Oscar, kissed her brother on the lips and said, [...] "I'm <b>so</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> <b>with</b> my brother right now." [...] She dismissed the rumors, saying, [...] "It was disappointing that something so beautiful and pure could be turned into a circus," [...] and explained that, as children of divorce, she and James relied on one another for emotional support.|$|E
500|$|In a mixed {{review for}} The Observer, Kitty Empire wrote that Jamie xx [...] "tear up Russell's soundbed entirely and {{showcase}} his own emerging versatility", {{but said that}} while his productions are [...] "consistently excellent, they aren't really there to augment Scott-Heron's words". Andy Gill of The Independent commented that the remixing techniques [...] "only occasionally work in its favour". Louise Brailey of NME wrote that he [...] "coaxes fresh narratives from the source material" [...] and that it [...] "isn’t exactly groundbreaking, but it showcases a producer <b>so</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> <b>with</b> the music of now that he not only preserves {{the power of his}} source material, but makes it more relevant". In MSN Music, Christgau called the record [...] "a young man's bad dream about mortality, and of interest as such", and wrote of the source material's importance to Jamie xx's remix, [...] "the snatches of Scott-Heron's voice, cracked for sure but deeper than night nonetheless, delivers it from callow generalization and foregone conclusion." [...] August Brown of the Los Angeles Times felt that [...] "the duo lends each other gravitas and levity on this very curious but ultimately immersive LP".|$|E
2500|$|T Lopez {{discussed}} and described her music style {{to be like}} it {{is a mix of}} a bunch of things, but it's pop," [...] says Lopez, who grew up on pioneers like Etta James. T Lopez said that she like a hard base line with a melody over it like Mary J. Blige. T Lopez said that her music is dramatic and the lyrics she would write are either 'I hate you' or 'I'm <b>so</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> <b>with</b> you'. There's no in between!".|$|E

2500|$|Throughout his {{duration}} on the show, Lofty has {{shared a}} close friendship with Robyn and Mead {{said that he}} and Henderson got on well off-set. They shared most of their scenes together and Barry compared Robyn and Lofty's relationship to a relationship between a brother and sister. In a storyline airing in early 2015, Robyn began developing feelings for Lofty and began subtly seeking a romance with him. Reflecting on Robyn's feelings, Henderson said [...] "She was <b>so</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> <b>with</b> him, but he just didn't feel the same." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Trumpets" [...] {{served as}} the fourth single {{released}} off the album (third single in the UK) and was released on November 7, 2013. On October 11, 2013. In Australia, [...] "Trumpets" [...] debuted at number 22 the ARIA Singles Chart: it reached its peak position of number one in its fourth week on the chart, while it reached number 4 on the UK Singles Chart, however has since peaked at number 1 on the UK R Singles Chart. Lyrically the song is about being <b>so</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> <b>with</b> and infatuated with someone that every time you're together, trumpets blast through your head. The official music video for [...] "Trumpets" [...] was later released on November 3, 2013.

2500|$|Film critic Emanuel Levy {{gave the}} film an [...] "A" [...] and wrote, [...] "Alongside Joel and Ethan Coen's No Country for Old Men, {{which is a}} Western in disguise, or rather a modern Western, Assassination of Jesse James is the second {{masterpiece}} of the season." [...] Levy also wrote, [...] "Like Bonnie & Clyde, Dominik's seminal Western is a brilliant, poetic saga of America's legendary criminal as well as meditative deconstruction of our culture's most persistent issues: link of crime and fame, myths of heroism and obsession with celebrity." [...] Lewis Beale of Film Journal International said [...] "Impeccably shot, cast and directed, this is a truly impressive film from sophomore writer-director Andrew Dominik... but suffers from an unfortunate case of elephantiasis." [...] Beale said Affleck is [...] "outstanding in a breakout performance" [...] and said Pitt is [...] "scary and charismatic." [...] Beale wrote, [...] "The director seems <b>so</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> <b>with</b> his languorous pacing, he's incapable of cutting the five or ten seconds {{in any number of}} scenes that could have given the film a more manageable running time. In the scheme of things, however, this amounts to little more than a quibble." [...] Beale said that ultimately, the film is [...] "a fascinating, literary-based work that succeeds as both art and genre film." ...|$|E

2500|$|<b>So</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> <b>with</b> praise, both {{popular and}} in the highest circles, is Wilberforce, observes Hazlitt, that he was even half {{inclined}} {{to give up his}} favorite cause, abolition of the slave trade, when William Pitt, the Prime Minister, was set to abandon it, and he sided with Pitt in approval of the repressive measures then imposed by the government in Britain and the government's later severe measures during the period of the Napoleonic Wars and afterward. [...] "He has no mercy on those who claim a property in negro-slaves as so much live-stock on their estates ... but not a word has he to say, not a whisper does he breathe against the claim set up by the Despots of the Earth over their Continental subjects, but does every thing in his power to confirm and sanction it! He must give no offence. ... He preaches vital Christianity to untutored savages; and tolerates its worst abuses in civilized states." [...] To [...] "render signal services to mankind" [...] requires greater moral strength than Wilberforce possesses: what is needed is [...] "a severity, a sternness, a self-denial, and a painful sense of duty" [...] that in Wilberforce's case vanish in exchange for a nod of approval from the king or the Prime Minister. Even in Wilberforce's acts of independence from his party's political standpoint, Hazlitt notes a subtle balancing of motives. In the words of Wilberforce biographer William Hague, who quotes Hazlitt's Spirit of the Age criticism, [...] "Hazlitt considered that Wilberforce meant well, but would never risk becoming unpopular with the ruling establishment: 'He ... reaps the credit of independence without the obloquy ... He has all the air of the most perfect independence, and gains a character for impartiality and candour, when he is only striking a balance between the éclat of differing from a Minister on some vantage ground, and the risk or odium that may attend it.|$|E

60|$|During {{the latter}} part of his reign, when he seemed fallen into his dotage, the venerable {{predecessor}} of King Yoky had been much attached to an old gray-headed Chimpanzee, one day found meditating in the woods. Rozoko was his name. He was very grave, and reverend of aspect; much of a philosopher. To him, all gnarled and knotty subjects were familiar; in his day he had cracked many a crabbed nut. And <b>so</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> <b>with</b> his Timonean solitude was Rozoko, that it needed many bribes and bland persuasions, to induce him to desert his mossy, hillside, misanthropic cave, for the distracting tumult of a court.|$|E
60|$|But, I say, {{few women}} cry out thus; few women are <b>so</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> <b>with</b> their own eternal salvation, {{as to be}} willing to part with all their lusts and vanities for Jesus Christ and a pitcher. Good Jacob also was thus: 'If the Lord,' said he, 'will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on, then he shall be my God.' Yea, he vowed it should be so. 'And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on; so that I come again to my father's house in peace: then shall the Lord be my God' (Gen 28:20).|$|E

50|$|Her mother having {{tried to}} persuade her son to start piano lessons, it {{appeared}} that his little sister, Myriam, aged six, needed no persuasion {{to sit at the}} piano: she was immediately drawn to the instrument, fascinated by its sound and <b>so</b> fell <b>in</b> <b>love</b> <b>with</b> it.|$|R

She was like a devoted slave, <b>so</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> <b>with</b> the chains that she never knew she wore them. And to Laurence, who had so little sense of property, this only served to deepen tenderness, and the hold she had on him.

60|$|My {{methods were}} {{more on the}} lines of {{peaceful}} penetration. An odd copy, in The Bun's rag-and-bone library, of Hone's Every-Day Book had revealed to me {{the existence of a}} village dance founded, like all village dances, on Druidical mysteries connected with the Solar Solstice (which is always unchallengeable) and Mid-summer Morning, which is dewy and refreshing to the London eye. For this I take no credit--Hone being a mine any one can work--but that I rechristened that dance, after I had revised it, 'The Gubby' is my title to immortal fame. It was still to be witnessed, I wrote, 'in all its poignant purity at Huckley, that last home of significant mediæval survivals'; and I fell <b>so</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> <b>with</b> my creation that I kept it back for days, enamelling and burnishing.|$|E
60|$|Ans. Therefore {{not in the}} {{enjoyment}} of the divine nature itself: for that which in substance is but a bare resemblance, though it be a most perfect one, is not the thing itself, {{of which it is}} a resemblance. But the blessedness that we shall enjoy in heaven, in the very substance of it, consisteth not wholly, nor principally, in a resemblance of, but in {{the enjoyment}} of God himself; 'Heirs of God.' Wherefore there shall not be in us a likeness only to, but the very nature of God: 'Heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ' (Rom 8:17). Hence the apostle tells us, that he 'rejoiced in hope of the glory of God' (Rom 5:2). Not only in hope of a resemblance of it. 'The Lord is my portion, saith my soul.' But this is like the rest of your discourse. You are <b>so</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> <b>with</b> your Adamitish holiness, that with you it must be God in earth, and heaven.|$|E
