2500|$|The Poisson point {{process is}} often defined {{on the real}} line, {{where it can be}} {{considered}} as a stochastic process. In this setting, it is used, for example, in queueing theory [...] to model random events, such as the arrival of customers at a store or phone calls at an exchange, distributed in time. [...] In the plane, the point process, also known as a spatial Poisson process, can represent the locations of scattered objects such as transmitters in a wireless network, [...] particles colliding into a detector, or trees in a forest. In this setting, the process is often used in [...] mathematical models and in the related fields of spatial point processes, stochastic geometry, spatial statistics [...] and continuum percolation theory. On more abstract spaces, the Poisson point process serves as an object of mathematical study in its own right. In all settings, the Poisson point process has the property that each point is <b>stochastically</b> <b>independent</b> to all the other points in the process, which is why it is sometimes called a purely or completely random process. [...] Despite its wide use as a stochastic model of phenomena representable as points, the inherent nature of the process implies that it does not adequately describe phenomena where there is sufficiently strong interaction between the points. This has inspired the proposal of other point processes, some of which are constructed with the Poisson point process, that seek to capture such interaction.|$|E

40|$|This paper studies {{a version}} of the core-periphery model a ̀ la Krugman (1991) where mobile workers are forward-looking. Our dynamic model {{incorporates}} frictions as in Matsuyama (1991) : opportunities for mobile workers to migrate between regions arrive <b>stochastically,</b> following <b>independent</b> Poisson processes. The key observation in this paper is that, as considered as a game with a continuum of players, the static model (under a certain condition) admits a potential function (Monderer and Shapley (1996), Sandholm (2001)). Appealing to results on perfect foresight dynamics in potential games (Hofbauer and Sorger (1999)), we show that there generically exists a unique state that is globally stable under the perfect foresight dynamics whenever the degree of friction is sufficiently small, and such a state is characterized as a unique maximizer of the potential function. In particular, when the trade barriers are sufficiently low, agglomeration on the region with the highest trade barrier is the unique stable state for a small friction.

40|$|Voltage-sensitive Ca 2 + {{channels}} (VSCCs) {{constitute a}} major source of calcium ions in dendritic spines, but their function is unknown. Here we show that R-type VSCCs in spines of rat CA 1 pyramidal neurons are depressed for at least 30 min after brief trains of back-propagating action potentials. Populations of channels in single spines are depressed <b>stochastically</b> and synchronously, <b>independent</b> of channels in the parent dendrite and other spines, implying that depression is the result of signaling restricted to individual spines. Induction of VSCC depression blocks theta-burst-induced long-term potentiation (LTP), indicating that postsynaptic action potentials can modulate synaptic plasticity by tuning VSCCs. Induction of depression requires [Ca 2 +] elevations and activation of L-type VSCCs, which activate Ca 2 +/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) and a cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) -dependent pathway. Given that L-type VSCCs do not contribute measurably to Ca 2 + influx in spines, they must activate downstream effectors either directly through voltage-dependent conformational changes or via [Ca 2 +] microdomains...|$|R

Design/methodology/approach: This paper presents {{a model of the}} system. An approximated model where is assumed that returns are <b>stochastically</b> <b>independent</b> of sales, is formulated to obtain the optimal capacities. The optimal costs of the original and the approximated models are compared in order to assess the influence of the assumption made on returns. Findings: The assumption that returns are <b>stochastically</b> <b>independent</b> of sales is significant in few cases. Research limitations/implications: The impact of the assumption on returns is assessed indirectly, by comparing the optimal costs of both models: the original and approximated. Practical implications: The problem of calculating the optimal capacities in the original model is hard to solve, however in the approximated model the problem is tractable. When the impact of the assumption that returns are <b>stochastically</b> <b>independent</b> of sales is not significant, the approximated model can be used to calculate the optimal capacities of the original model.
