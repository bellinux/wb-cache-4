40|$|This work {{presents}} {{the application of}} the normal distribution Gauss-Laplace in case of a company is the most modern Romanian <b>sea-river</b> <b>port</b> on the Danube, specialized service providers, with a handling capacity of approx. 20, 000, 000 tons / year. The normal distribution Gauss-Laplace is the most known and used probability distribution, because it surprises better the evolution of economic and financial phenomena. Around the average, which has the greatest frequency, gravitate values more to less distant than average, but with the same standard deviation. It is noted that, although used in the forecasting calculations, analysis of profitability threshold - even ignores the risk of decisional operations (regarding deviations between the forecast and achievements), which may, in certain circumstances, influence much the activity of the company. This can be held into account when carefully studying the evolution of turnover follows a law of probability. In case not exist any information on the law of probability of turnover and no reason that one case appear more than another, according of Laplace law, we consider that these cases are uniformly distributed, therefore they follow a normal distribution...|$|E

These “brides of the sea” (Broeze 1989) are specific as they connect foreland and hinterland through the port (Vigarié 1979; Pearson 1998). Major cities of the world are still in many ways maritime cities (Dogan 1988) or locate near seaports or <b>sea-river</b> <b>ports</b> (Vance 1970). Port cities have also been vital centers of successive world systems throughout history (Braudel 1979), from Tyr and Sidon in the Phoenician world to New York and Shanghai nowadays.|$|R
