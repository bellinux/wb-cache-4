40|$|AbstractRaw milk is a {{complete}} food which contains protein, fat, sugars, vitamins and minerals. Even though, raw milk is sterile at secretion, contamination of milk by microorganisms can take place during milk handling, storage and other pre-processing activities. The objectives {{of this study were}} to assess the initial microbial load and to determine correlation between Methylene blue dye reduction test with <b>standard</b> <b>plate</b> <b>count</b> method and find possible methods to improve the quality and reduce the wastage of raw milk. As per the records obtain from the chilling centers, about twenty per cent (per month) of raw milk collected to the centers in each district has to be discarded due to spoilage. Out of 13 chilling centers in Kurunagala district, five chilling centers namely Badalgama, Elabadagama, Kuliyapitiya, Dambadeniya and Minuwangoda chilling centers were randomly selected and the initial microbial loads of milk from chilling tanks were tested using <b>Standard</b> <b>Plate</b> <b>Count</b> and Methylene blue dye reduction test. Further, Self- filled questionnaire was used to gather data related to practices in milk supply chain and swab samples were taken from the containers used for milk collection process. Though the microbial population should be below log 6. 00 according to the factory standards in Sri Lanka to accept milk for further processing, <b>standard</b> <b>plate</b> <b>count</b> of chilling centers were log 7. 08, 6. 76, 6. 56, 6. 70, and 6. 88 (CFU/ml) respectively.

Strong correlation (r 2 0. 91) was observed between Methylene blue dye reduction test and Standard Plate Counts (log CFU/ml).

40|$|A {{total of}} 529 well and {{distribution}} potable water samples were analyzed for total coliforms by the most-probable-number and membrane filter (MF) techniques. <b>Standard</b> <b>plate</b> <b>count</b> bacteria and MF noncoliform bacteria were also enumerated. Frequency of coliform detection, turbidity in most-probable-number tubes, and extensive overgrowth by noncoliforms on MF filters were {{directly proportional to}} standard plate counts. Recovery of coliforms was greatest by the MF method at low (less than 100 CFU/ml) <b>standard</b> <b>plate</b> <b>count</b> densities and better by the most-probable-number method (confirming gas and turbid tube) at high (greater than 500 CFU/ml) <b>standard</b> <b>plate</b> <b>count</b> densities. In the latter case, overgrowth by noncoliforms on MF filters suppressed sheen development and, in turn, masked coliform detection. Of 341 atypical (no sheen) MF colonies verified by parallel inoculation of lauryl sulfate broth and billiant green-bile broth, 156 were aerogenic in the latter medium. Of atypical isolates, 84 % were identified as either Citrobacter or Enterobacter species. A 4. 3 -fold reduction in numbers of overgrown MF filters and an 2. 2 -fold increase in numbers of coliforms recovered from 127 water samples was accomplished by anaerobic incubation of MF cultures. This anaerobic modification of the standard MF technique significantly reduced overgrowth and enhanced recovery of coliforms from potable groundwater.

40|$|Graduation date: 1980 A {{comprehensive}} study {{was made on}} the impact to surface and ground water pollution by a recently populated rural neighborhood located {{in the foothills of}} western Oregon. A stream originating in a limited access forest and flowing through a modern zoned housing development was routinely monitored. Sampling was performed during steady state low flow and high flow conditions, and during the rising and falling hydrograph of storm events. Bacterial levels were found to be one to two log units higher in the unprotected regions of the stream compared to levels in the protected forest. To determine the source of fecal pollution in the stream, fecal streptococci were randomly picked and biotyped. It was demonstrated that sources of fecal contamination in the stream included human feces, as evidenced by the presence of S. mitis and S. salivarius during stormwater runoff. This was attributed to use of septic drain-fields in soils unsuitable for such use. Other contributors were domestic livestock and wildlife, as manifested by the isolation of S. bovis and S. equinus. To determine the effects of seasonal variation and modern zoning criteria on drinking water supplies, six surveys over a fifteen month period were conducted. More than one third of the water supplies were unsatisfactory on at least one occasion in terms of <b>standard</b> <b>plate</b> <b>counts</b> over 10 ³ /ml, the presence of coliforms, fecal coliforms, and/or Staphylococcus aureus.

The GABRIEL study was designed to investigate this hypothesis in a large population of European children, calling for a rapid alternative to classical culture techniques to determine bacteriological properties of milk samples. One objective was to evaluate 2 different rapid methods to determine bacteriological properties in a large number of cow milk samples collected under field conditions. BactoScan (Foss Analytical, Hillerod, Denmark), an automated standard flow cytometric method utilized for routine testing of milk quality, and TEMPO (bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France), an automated most-probable-number method, were used to assess the total viable bacterial count in farm and commercial milk samples. Both methods were compared with <b>standard</b> <b>plate</b> <b>count</b> method and each other. Measurements based on the TEMPO method were in good agreement with the <b>standard</b> <b>plate</b> <b>count</b> method and showed reliable results, whereas BactoScan results did not correlate with <b>standard</b> <b>plate</b> <b>count</b> measurements and yielded higher bacteria counts in heat-treated milk samples compared with raw milk samples. Most likely, these discrepant results were due to inferences with staining reactions and detection of bacteria in heat-treated milk samples.

IF methods were applied to the detection and enumeration of both the total and viable L. pneumophila cells in water samples. The sensitivity of the IF methods coupled to SPC was 34 cells liter− 1, and the reproducibility was good, with the coefficient of variation generally falling below 30 %.

For most of the 12 months of the oysters' life, it was possible to identify Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Vibrio carchariae was identified in four collections. Among other isolated species, the most important, considering public health risks, was V. vulnificus, although only one strain was confirmed. We concluded that retail purchased oysters should never be eaten raw or undercooked because many species of the genus Vibrio are known to be pathogenic to humans and live naturally on and in shellfish throughout their life cycle...|$|R
40|$|Microbial {{records of}} {{commercial}} raw milk (total counts) and two ice creams (<b>standard</b> <b>plate</b> <b>counts,</b> coliforms and yeasts) were de-rounded. Their autocorrelation function {{showed that the}} counts were independent and had no discernible trend or periodicity. The first half of each record was used to estimate the frequencies of high counts in the second half, assuming that the counts have a lognormal, log-Laplace or non-parametric distribution. The estimated frequencies were {{all on the same}} order of magnitude of those actually observed and in some cases in close agreement. None of the three distributions was found to be consistently superior to the others, most probably because the available records for the analysis were too short. In general, the lognormal and log-Laplace distributions yielded closer estimates than the non-parametric distribution because they allow for high counts at levels not previously recorded. The results strengthen the view that at least, in principle, the irregular fluctuating pattern of the microbial records of dairy products can be translated into a set of probabilities of future high counts, and that these can serve as a risk or quality measure...|$|R
