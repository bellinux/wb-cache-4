The Griffin edition <b>squeezed</b> <b>the</b> audience of Newsnight (BBC Two) to 300,000 viewers compared to its normal 700,000 to 1million, while a repeat showing of Piers Morgan's Life Stories on ITV1 attracted 700,000 viewers, a 5% share. The Times noted that audience figures for the show led the BBC's weekly total, ahead of Strictly Come Dancing on Saturday night.|$|E
5|$|An enquiry {{was held}} to resolve the {{question}} of whom should inherit the de Eynsford lands; Eynsford Castle and the other family estates were divided equally between William Heringaud, a powerful landowner in east Kent, and Nicholas de Criol, a smaller local Kentish landowner, {{both of whom were}} descended from William V. The Second Barons' War broke out in 1264 and both men supported the rebels against Henry III. Eynsford, by now unoccupied, was seized by Ralph de Farningham, a royal official, who in turn passed it onto Ralph de Sandwich, a royal judge. De Sandwich <b>squeezed</b> <b>the</b> Heringauds out of their inheritance, making a deal in 1292 with Heringaud's daughter, the lady of Horton Kirby, and de Sandwich and the Criols then became joint owners of the castle. Around 1300, the castle was occupied once again, probably either by the widow of Nicholas or William VI, or a castle bailiff.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool's first {{opportunity}} came a minute later, after West Ham midfielder Carl Fletcher conceded a free kick for a foul on Gerrard. However, the resulting free kick was hit {{into the wall}} of players {{in front of the}} West Ham penalty area. A few minutes later, West Ham scored the first goal of the match; Liverpool midfielder Xabi Alonso gave the ball away to Benayoun, who played it inside to Ashton. Ashton then played a through-ball to Lionel Scaloni on the right flank, before the Argentine's low cross was put into his own goal by Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher to give West Ham a 1–0 lead. Seven minutes later, West Ham extended their lead, when Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina fumbled a shot from Etherington into the path of Ashton, who <b>squeezed</b> <b>the</b> rebound under Reina into the far corner to make it 2–0. Liverpool looked to have reduced the defect in the 30th minute, but Peter Crouch's shot from a Gerrard free kick was disallowed as Crouch was offside.|$|E

5|$|Paleo-Indians {{visited the}} area about 12,000 {{years ago but}} did not leave much archaeological {{evidence}}. Northern Shoshone created trails through the Craters of the Moon Lava Field during their summer migrations from the Snake River to the camas prairie, west of the lava field. Stone windbreaks at Indian Tunnel were used to protect campsites from the dry summer wind. No evidence exists for permanent habitation by any Native American group. A hunting and gathering culture, the Northern Shoshone pursued elk, bears, American bison, cougars, and bighorn sheep— all large game who no longer range the area. The most recent volcanic eruptions ended about 2,100 years ago and were likely witnessed by the Shoshone people. Shoshone legend speaks of a serpent on a mountain who, angered by lightning, coiled around and <b>squeezed</b> <b>the</b> mountain until liquid rock flowed, fire shot from cracks, and the mountain exploded.|$|E
5|$|In November 1942, American and British forces {{landed in}} North Africa under Operation Torch. Allied thrusts overran Vichy French Morocco and Algeria and {{advanced}} into Tunisia. The danger for the Axis Powers was now apparent. The Allied forces advancing eastward and the British 8th Army advancing westward after the {{victory at the}} Second Battle of El Alamein, would trap and destroy the remaining Axis forces in North Africa. In response to the crisis, and the poor state of Axis forces, reinforcements for the German Afrika Korps, Italian Army and Luftwaffe were dispatched by sea and air. These reinforcements duly staved off an immediate defeat in Tunisia, the last region still in Axis hands. The poor state of the roads and rail lines in Algeria meant that Allied forces faced difficult logistic challenges which enabled the Axis to prolong a defence. The inexperience of U.S. forces was also apparent at the Battle of the Kasserine Pass. Nevertheless, the growing number and experience of Allied forces <b>squeezed</b> <b>the</b> Axis toward {{the northern tip of}} Tunisia. The Royal Air Force (RAF) and Royal Navy operating from Malta took a heavy toll of Axis shipping. However, Axis supplies were still reaching the besieged Afrika Korps by air. By early April, large quantities of Axis manpower was also being evacuated by air. Although the Allies held air superiority by this time, Luftwaffe transports were operating with impunity during darkness.|$|E

25|$|There was {{a steady}} erosion of intra-Asiatic trade because {{of changes in}} the Asiatic {{political}} and economic environment that the VOC could do little about. These factors gradually <b>squeezed</b> <b>the</b> company out of Persia, Suratte, the Malabar Coast, and Bengal. The company had to confine its operations to the belt it physically controlled, from Ceylon through the Indonesian archipelago. The volume of this intra-Asiatic trade, and its profitability, therefore had to shrink.|$|E

25|$|In {{the center}} of the Allied line, Eisenhower {{inserted}} a new army—the 15th Army, under U.S. 12th Army Group control—to hold {{the western edge of the}} Ruhr Pocket along the Rhine while the 9th and 1st Armies <b>squeezed</b> <b>the</b> remaining German defenders there from the north, east, and south. Following the reduction of the Ruhr, the 15th Army was to take over occupation duties in the region as the 9th, 1st, and 3rd Armies pushed farther into Germany.|$|E
25|$|In prehistoric times, great {{amounts of}} {{sediment}} {{collected on the}} floor of Lake Amora. The sediment was heavier than the salt deposits and <b>squeezed</b> <b>the</b> salt deposits upwards into what are now the Lisan Peninsula and Mount Sodom (on the southwest side of the lake). Geologists explain the effect in terms of a bucket of mud into which a large flat stone is placed, forcing the mud to creep up the sides of the bucket. When the floor of the Dead Sea dropped further due to tectonic forces, the salt mounts of Lisan and Mount Sodom stayed in place as high cliffs (see salt dome).|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, federal {{welfare reform}} <b>squeezed</b> <b>the</b> social {{services}} {{based in the}} Market. As a result, a nonprofit group, the Pike Place Market Foundation, was established by the PDA to raise funds and administer the Market's free clinic, senior center, low-income housing, and childcare center. Also in the 1980s the wooden floors on the top arcade were replaced with tiles (so as to prevent water damage to merchandise on the lower floors) that were laid by the PDA after staging a hugely successful capital campaign - people could pay $35 to have their name(s) inscribed on a tile. Between 1985 and 1987, more than 45,000 tiles were installed and nearly 1.6 million dollars was raised.|$|E

25|$|One {{approach}} {{that does not}} involve farming spiders is to extract the spider silk gene and use other organisms to produce the spider silk. Working under the trademark BioSteel, in 2000 Canadian biotechnology company Nexia successfully produced spider silk protein in transgenic goats that carried the gene for it; the milk produced by the goats contained significant quantities of the protein, 1–2grams of silk proteins per litre of milk. Attempts to spin the protein into a fibre similar to natural spider silk resulted in fibres with tenacities of 2–3grams per denier. Nexia used wet spinning and <b>squeezed</b> <b>the</b> silk protein solution through small extrusion holes in order to simulate {{the behavior of the}} spinneret, but this procedure has so far not been sufficient to replicate the properties of native spider silk.|$|E
25|$|The second Uranverein {{began after}} the Heereswaffenamt (HWA, Army Ordnance Office) <b>squeezed</b> <b>the</b> Reichsforschungsrat (RFR, Reich Research Council) {{out of the}} Reichserziehungsministerium (REM, Reich Ministry of Education) and started the formal German nuclear energy project under {{military}} auspices. The second Uranverein was formed on 1 September 1939, the day World War II began, and it had its first meeting on 16 September 1939. The meeting was organized by Kurt Diebner, advisor to the HWA, and held in Berlin. The invitees included Walther Bothe, Siegfried Flügge, Hans Geiger, Otto Hahn, Paul Harteck, Gerhard Hoffmann, Josef Mattauch and Georg Stetter. A second meeting was held soon thereafter and included Klaus Clusius, Robert Döpel, Werner Heisenberg and Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker. Also at this time, the Kaiser-Wilhelm Institut für Physik (KWIP, Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics, after World War II the Max Planck Institute for Physics), in Berlin-Dahlem, was placed under HWA authority, with Diebner as the administrative director, and the military control of the nuclear research commenced.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the 37th's advance {{had slowed}} {{due to the}} {{breakdown}} of many of its allotted landing craft. They subsequently had to borrow some of the craft allocated to the 35th Battalion, and supplemented these with a barge that was captured from the Japanese when a patrol boarded a vessel that had pulled into Tambana Bay. By 5 October they cleared Warambari Bay, amidst heavy fighting. The following day, the two New Zealand battalions were close to linking up, having <b>squeezed</b> <b>the</b> Japanese into a small pocket, which was reduced further when the 37th Battalion finally reached Mende Point {{on the afternoon of}} 6 October. A large scale attack was planned on the Japanese around Marziana Point and that night a heavy barrage was dialled in on the position. The appearance of Japanese aircraft, however, silenced the guns and throughout the night, the Japanese garrison was withdrawn from the island, replicating the withdrawal that had taken place from Kolombangara between 28 September and 4 October.|$|E

500|$|The {{movie was}} filmed {{in a process}} known as [...] "MGM Camera 65". 1957's Raintree County was the first MGM film to use the process. The MGM Camera 65 used special 65mm Eastmancolor film stock with a 2.76:1 aspect ratio. 70mm {{anamorphic}} camera lenses developed by the Mitchell Camera Company were manufactured to specifications submitted by MGM. These lenses <b>squeezed</b> <b>the</b> image down 1.25 times to fit on the image area of the film stock. Because the film could be adapted to the requirements of individual theaters, movie houses did not need to install special, expensive 70mm projection equipment. Six of the 70mm lenses, each worth $100,000, were shipped to Rome for use by the production.|$|E
