25|$|Two {{sedan and}} wagon body styles were {{available}} in two trims {{for the duration of}} the Medallion's run.

500|$|A {{location}} was selected east of Charlottesville where the C mainline followed the Rivanna River, providing both an easy {{water supply and}} rail access. [...] The Red Land Power Corporation, chartered March 29, 1913, was charged to construct a 2,000-horsepower plant for the C and was merged into the C on November 25, 1913. [...] The old power plant was used temporarily, with new equipment, to produce AC power for the city as the new plant was being completed. Coal was provided to the new plant by way of rail, where a spur off of the C railway was provided to allow coal from hopper cars to be unloaded into a <b>storage</b> <b>bin</b> beneath. [...] Two 400hp boilers were installed along with multiple turbines and generators in order to generate the electricity. [...] The completed plant produced 175,000 kWh per month as of 1914 and consumed four hopper cars worth of coal per month; this is contrasted with the old power plant's generation of 125,000 kWh per month consuming 1415 cars worth, demonstrating the new plant's efficiency.|$|E

2500|$|Cretors's {{invention}} {{introduced the}} first patented steam-driven popcorn machine that popped corn in oil. Previously, vendors popped corn by holding a wire basket {{over an open}} flame. At best, {{the result was a}} hot, dry, unevenly cooked snack. Cretors's machine popped corn in a mixture of one-third clarified butter, two-thirds lard, and salt. This mixture can withstand the [...] temperature needed to pop corn and it produces little smoke. A fire under a boiler created steam that drove a small engine; that engine drove the gears, shaft, and agitator that stirred the corn and powered a small automated clown puppet-like figure, [...] "the Toasty Roasty Man," [...] an attention attracting amusement intended to drum up business. A wire connected {{to the top of the}} cooking pan allowed the operator to disengage the drive mechanism, lift the cover, and dump popped corn into the <b>storage</b> <b>bin</b> beneath. Exhaust from the steam engine was piped to a hollow pan below the corn <b>storage</b> <b>bin</b> and kept freshly popped corn uniformly warm for the first time. Excess steam was also used to operate a small, shrill whistle to further attract attention.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{innovation}} was the [...] "Flip-Fold" [...] {{center console}} on cars not {{equipped with a}} standard floor console. [...] It was a seat in between the bucket seats that could {{be transformed into a}} console, reducing the seating count by one. [...] The seat cushion folded out into a console with a lockable <b>storage</b> <b>bin</b> and cupholders, resting against the dashboard. [...] The seatback also folded down to become an armrest. A traditional center console with a floor-mounted shifter was installed on cars equipped without the flip fold console.|$|E
2500|$|After the 1914 {{opening of}} the Panama Canal the city of Victoria sought to {{increase}} ship traffic to the harbour and built the breakwater and Ogden Point piers in 1916 and 1918 respectively for $5million. In 1925 the city and Panama Pacific Grain Terminal Elevator Co. Ltd. built a [...] grain <b>storage</b> <b>bin</b> to ship Prairie Provinces grain worldwide. In 1928 the federal government granted control over Ogden Point to the Canadian National Railway (CNR). Around 1928 the British Columbia Packers Ltd. (BC Packers) company built a fish processing and cold storage plant at Ogden Point.|$|E

2500|$|For the 1959 model, {{engines and}} {{horsepower}} ratings did not change.

A positive reverse lockout shifter with [...] "T" [...] handle was standard with 4-speed manual transmission. This was the only year a turquoise convertible top color could be ordered, and all 24-gallon fuel tank models through 1962 could not be ordered with convertible tops due to inadequate space for the folding top mechanism. Rare options: RPO 684 heavy-duty brakes and suspension (142), RPO 686 metallic brakes (333), RPO 276 15"×5.5" [...] wheels (214), RPO 426 power windows (547), RPO 473 power convertible top (661).|$|E
