5|$|While {{the initial}} steer torque and <b>steer</b> <b>angle</b> are both {{opposite}} the desired turn direction, {{this may not}} be the case to maintain a steady-state turn. The sustained <b>steer</b> <b>angle</b> is usually in the same direction as the turn, but may remain opposite to the direction of the turn, especially at high speeds. The sustained steer torque required to maintain that <b>steer</b> <b>angle</b> is usually opposite the turn direction. The actual magnitude and orientation of both the sustained <b>steer</b> <b>angle</b> and sustained steer torque of a particular bike in a particular turn depend on forward speed, bike geometry, tire properties, and combined bike and rider mass distribution. Once in a turn, the radius can only be changed with an appropriate change in lean angle, and this can be accomplished by additional countersteering out of the turn to increase lean and decrease radius, then into the turn to decrease lean and increase radius. To exit the turn, the bike must again countersteer, momentarily steering more into the turn in order to decrease the radius, thus increasing inertial forces, and thereby decreasing the angle of lean.|$|E
5|$|In this {{idealized}} and linearized model, {{there are}} many geometric parameters (wheelbase, head angle, mass of each body, wheel radius, etc.), but only four significant variables: lean angle, lean rate, <b>steer</b> <b>angle,</b> and steer rate.

5|$|The term rear wobble {{is used to}} {{describe}} a mode of oscillation in which lean angle (roll) and heading angle (yaw) are almost in phase and both 180° out of phase with <b>steer</b> <b>angle.</b> The rate of this oscillation is moderate with a maximum of about 6.5Hz. Rear wobble is heavily damped and falls off quickly as bike speed increases.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} keep the {{autonomous}} car on a road, using the autodriver algorithm [1], kinematic condition of steering has been used to set the <b>steer</b> <b>angles</b> such that the kinematic center of rotation is on the road curvature center. The road and tire characteristics, along with the dynamics of the moving vehicle cause the vehicle to turn around another point that is not necessarily at the road curvature center. In other words the position of the dynamic turning center is different from the kinematically calculated one. Steady-state responses have been used, to produce a new method for finding the <b>steer</b> <b>angles</b> which will result in a much closer dynamic response to the actual road. The method and the proof have been explained.

5|$|Adding {{complexity}} to the model, such as rider movement, suspension movement, tire compliance, or frame flex, adds {{degrees of}} freedom. While the rear frame does pitch with leaning and steering, the pitch angle is completely {{constrained by the}} requirement for both wheels {{to remain on the}} ground, and so can be calculated geometrically from the other seven variables. If the location of the bike and the rotation of the wheels are ignored, the first five degrees of freedom can also be ignored, and the bike can be described by just two variables: lean angle and <b>steer</b> <b>angle.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{factor that}} {{influences}} the directional stability of a bike is wheelbase, the horizontal {{distance between the}} ground contact points of {{the front and rear}} wheels. For a given displacement of the front wheel, due to some disturbance, the angle of the resulting path from the original is inversely proportional to wheelbase. Also, the radius of curvature for a given <b>steer</b> <b>angle</b> and lean angle is proportional to the wheelbase. Finally, the wheelbase increases when the bike is leaned and steered. In the extreme, when the lean angle is 90°, and the bike is steered in the direction of that lean, the wheelbase is increased by the radius of the front and rear wheels.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} to calculate eigenvalues, {{one for each of}} the four state variables (lean angle, lean rate, <b>steer</b> <b>angle,</b> and steer rate), from the linearized equations in order to analyze the normal modes and self-stability of a particular bike design. In the plot to the right, eigenvalues of one particular bicycle are calculated for forward speeds of 0–10m/s (22mph). When the real parts of all eigenvalues (shown in dark blue) are negative, the bike is self-stable. When the imaginary parts of any eigenvalues (shown in cyan) are non-zero, the bike exhibits oscillation. The eigenvalues are point symmetric about the origin and so any bike design with a self-stable region in forward speeds will not be self-stable going backwards at the same speed.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} and evaluates a 3 -D kinematic controller for passively-steered rovers. Passively-steered rovers have no steering motors, but rely on differential wheel velocities {{to change}} the axle <b>steer</b> <b>angles.</b> This passive steering design is reliable and efficient but more challenging to control than powered steering designs, especially when driving on rough terrain. A controller based on 2 -D kinematics fails to accurately maintain the desired trajectory when traversing obstacles. The presented 3 -D kinematic controller uses inertial and proprioceptive sensing to modify commanded <b>steer</b> <b>angles</b> and wheel velocities, greatly improving steering accuracy.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of motorcycle and scooter tyres {{have a large}} influence on the handling and stability of these vehicles. When a two-wheeled vehicle moves along a curvilinear path, there are large camber angles (up to 50 ◦); hence, tyres have a curved cross-section and the contact patch moves and changes its shape when the roll and <b>steer</b> <b>angles</b> are modified by the rider. This paper describes experimental research aimed at studying {{the influence of the}} camber angle, vertical load and inflation pressure on the shape of the contact patch and the forces and moments of the tyres. The experimental tests were carried out by means of a rotating-disc machine. The contact patches were measured by making use of a pressure-indicating film. The camber force and twisting torque were related to the vertical load and inflation pressure through the dimensions of the contact patch. Newbestfitting equations were developed starting from the brush model. Many experimental results dealing with front and rear tyres are presented and the merits and limitations of the best-fitting equations are discussed...|$|R
40|$|English When {{developing}} modern {{control systems}} like anti-lock braking systems (ABS), traction control (TC), brake assistant (BAS) and electronic stability programs (ESP) to increase safety and comfort in vehi-cles, accurate tyre models are very important. Numerical simulation models {{are needed to}} predict the vehicle’s behaviour for various driving conditions. Testing facilities like the tyre measurement tower are needed to provide the necessary experimental data to validate these tyre models. The tyre measurement tower of the Dynamics and Control section of the TU Eindhoven, is already capable of simulating different situations, but it needs hydraulic actuators to subject the wheel to vertical vibra-tions and alternating <b>steer</b> <b>angles.</b> This report discusses {{the design of a}} vertical hydraulic actuator for the tyre measurement tower. A theoretical model of the hydraulic actuator and the measurement tower is developed, to determine what size of hydraulic cylinder is needed to fulfill the demands for good tyre measurement.

The size of these hydraulic cylinders limit the choice between servo valves, and this choice has a substantial effect on the dynamics of the total system.

40|$|Dynamic tire properties, {{specifically}} the forces and moments generated under different circum-stances, {{have been found}} to be important to motorcycle dynamics. A similar situation may be expected to exist for bicycles, but limited bicycle tire data and a lack of the tools necessary to measure it may contribute to its absence in bicycle dynamics analyses. This paper describes tools developed to measure these bicycle tire properties and presents some of the findings. Cornering stiffness, also known as sideslip and lateral slip stiffness, of either the front or rear tires, has been found to influence both the weave and wobble modes of motorcycles. Measuring this property requires holding the tire at a fixed orientation, camber and <b>steer</b> <b>angles,</b> with re-spect to the pavement and its direction of travel, and then measuring the lateral force generated as the tire rolls forward. Large, sophisticated, and expensive devices exist for measuring this characteristic of automobile tires. One device is known to exist for motorcycle tires, and it has been used at least once on bicycle tires, but the minimum load it can apply is approximately 200 pounds, nearly double the actual load carried by most bicycle tires.
