40|$|International audienceNeural {{activity}} {{is crucial for}} the refinement of neuronal connections during development, but the contribution of synaptic release mechanisms is not known. In the mammalian <b>retina,</b> <b>spontaneous</b> neural <b>activity</b> controls the refinement of retinal projections to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) and the superior colliculus (SC) to form appropriate topographic and eye-specific maps. To evaluate the role of synaptic release, the rab-interacting molecules (RIMs), a family of active zone proteins that {{play a central role}} in calcium-triggered release, were conditionally ablated in a subset of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). We found that this deletion is sufficient to reduce presynaptic release probability onto dLGN neurons. Furthermore, eye-specific segregation in the dLGN and topographic refinement of ipsilateral axons in the SC and the dLGN, are impaired in RIM 1 / 2 conditional knock-out (Rim-cDKO) mice. These defects are similar to those found when retinal {{activity is}} globally disturbed. However, reduction in synaptic release had no effect on eye-specific lamination in the SC nor on the retinotopic refinement of contralateral axons in the SC. This study highlights a potential distinction between synaptic and non-synaptic roles of neuronal activity for different mapping rules operating in visual system development...|$|R
40|$|Primates use saccadic eye {{movements}} to make gaze changes. In many visual areas, including the dorsal medial superior temporal area (MSTd) of macaques, neural responses to visual stimuli are reduced during saccades but enhanced afterwards. How does this enhancement arise – from an internal mechanism associated with saccade generation or through visual mechanisms activated by the saccade sweeping {{the image of}} the visual scene across the <b>retina?</b> <b>Spontaneous</b> <b>activity</b> in MSTd is elevated even after saccades made in darkness, suggesting a central mechanism for post-saccadic enhancement. However, based on the timing of this effect, it may arise from a different mechanism than occurs in normal vision. Like neural responses in MSTd, initial ocular following eye speed is enhanced after saccades, with evidence suggesting both internal and visually mediated mechanisms. Here we recorded from visual neurons in MSTd and measured responses to motion stimuli presented soon after saccades and soon after simulated saccades – saccade-like displacements of the background image during fixation. We found that neural responses in MSTd were enhanced when preceded by real saccades but not when preceded by simulated saccades. Furthermore, we also observed enhancement following real saccades made across a blank screen that generated no motion signal within the recorded neurons’ receptive fields. We conclude that in MSTd the mechanism leading to post-saccadic enhancement has internal origins...|$|R
50|$|There are {{gradations}} to {{the intensity}} or {{strength of the}} <b>retina's</b> <b>activity,</b> or reaction to external stimulus. The undivided <b>activity</b> of the <b>retina</b> is divided into stronger or weaker degrees when stimulated by pure light or whiteness. When influenced by light, the degrees are: Light — Half Shade — Darkness. When influenced by whiteness, the degrees are: White — Gray — Black. In this way, grays are seen. The intensity or energy of the <b>retina's</b> <b>activity</b> increases as more light or whiteness stimulates the eye. These gradations are {{made possible by the}} quantitative intensive divisibility of the <b>retina's</b> <b>activity.</b>|$|R
50|$|If, {{instead of}} white, we stare at yellow, then the afterimage, or {{physiological}} color spectrum, is violet. Yellow, unlike white, {{does not fully}} stimulate and exhaust the <b>retina's</b> <b>activity.</b> Yellow partially stimulates points on the retina and leaves those points partially unstimulated. The <b>retina's</b> <b>activity</b> has been qualitatively divided and separated into two parts. The unstimulated part results in a violet afterimage. Yellow and violet are the complement of each other because together they add up to full retinal activity. Yellow is closer to white, so it activates the retina more than violet, which is closer to black.|$|R
50|$|Red {{and green}} are two {{completely}} equal qualitative {{halves of the}} <b>retina's</b> <b>activity.</b> Orange is 2/3 of this activity, and its complement, blue, is only 1/3. Yellow is ¾ of the full activity, and its complement, violet, is only ¼.|$|R
50|$|Newton's {{theory has}} color as an occult quality. Schopenhauer's theory {{claims to be}} more explanatory. He said that each color is a {{definite}} + or − side {{of the division of}} the <b>retina's</b> <b>activity,</b> expressed as a fraction that reflects the color's sensation.|$|R
50|$|According to Goethe, {{color is}} like shade or gray {{in that it}} is darker than white and {{brighter}} than black. The difference between grays and colors, though, is as follows. Light is <b>activity</b> of the <b>retina.</b> Darkness is retinal inactivity. Grays appear when the intensity or strength of the <b>retina's</b> <b>activity</b> is lessened. Colors appear when the whole <b>activity</b> of the <b>retina</b> is divided into partial complementary poles according to ratios. With the merely quantitative, intensive division of the <b>retina's</b> <b>activity,</b> there is only a gradual (by degrees) diminution of the intensity or strength of the <b>retina's</b> full <b>activity.</b> No fractional division of activity in ratios occurs. This lessening of strength by small degrees results in gray shades. However, with the qualitative fractional division of the <b>activity</b> of the <b>retina,</b> the <b>activity</b> of the part that appears as color is necessarily conditioned by the inactivity of the complementary fractional part. The polar contrast between the active and inactive parts results in color. The vivid partial activity of the stimulated retinal spot is supported by that same spot's partial inactivity. Every color's darkness appears as its afterimage, or spectrum. Conversely, when looking at an afterimage, or physiological spectrum, the previously existing color is the darkening factor.|$|R
50|$|Black {{and white}} are not colors {{because they are}} not {{fractions}} and represent no qualitative division of the <b>retina's</b> <b>activity.</b> Colors appear in pairs as the union of a color and its complement. Newton's division into seven colors is absurd because the sum of all basic colors cannot be an odd number.|$|R
40|$|In {{degenerative}} {{diseases of}} the retina, like retinitis pigmentosa (RP), the loss of photoreceptors {{is followed by a}} remodeling process of the remaining inner retina and blindness. Retinal prostheses are used to restore vision in RP patients through electrical stimulation but current models of prostheses are not adjusted to the changes of the remodeling process. In vitro multielectrode array (MEA) recordings from retinae of a genetic model (retinal degeneration 10, rd 10) and a pharmacologically-induced model (N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) treatment) of retinal degeneration were compared with recordings from healthy retinae of wild type (wt) mice. In addition to the investigation of the <b>spontaneous</b> <b>activity,</b> <b>retinae</b> were stimulated with biphasic current pulses of different amplitudes and durations. In contrast to wt retinae, degenerated retinae showed oscillatory potentials and rhythmic spiking in a burst formation. In many cases, bursts were found phase-locked to the minima of the oscillations. The oscillations occured at frequencies of 3 - 6 Hz in rd 10 retinae and of 6 - 9 Hz in retinae of MNU-treated mice. In all age groups, electrical stimulation was more effective in wt retinae than in retinae of both degeneration models. In the presence of bursts or oscillations, the stimulation efficiency of ganglion cells was particularly low. Low stimulation efficiency would impair the use of retinal prostheses. In order to increase stimulation efficiency in degenerated retinae, two methods were investigated that might abolish the abnormal activity. Application of an electrical pre-stimulus inhibited bursts and oscillations such that the activity resembled the activity of a wt retina. Furthermore, retinae were perfused with different drugs. Meclofenamic acid (MFA), a blocker of electrical synapses, also abolished oscillations occasionally. Although, neither the pre-stimulus method nor the pharmacological method reliably increased stimulation efficiency, the preliminary results encourage to continue with this approach. The results reveal obvious differences between electrophysiological properties of healthy and degenerated retinae and therefore confirm the necessity to consider retinal changes occurring during degeneration in the development of new retinal prostheses...|$|R
50|$|Afterimages (spectra) appear after a {{mechanical}} {{shock to the}} eye. The eye's activity is convulsively divided. Transitory pathological spectra appear from glare or dazzle. The <b>retina's</b> <b>activity</b> is disorganized from over-stimulation. A dazzled eye sees red when looking at brightness and green when looking into darkness. The <b>retina's</b> <b>activity</b> is forcefully divided by the powerful stimulation. When the eye strains to see in dim light, the retina is voluntarily activated and intensively divided. Blue eyeglasses counter the effect of orange candlelight and produce the effect of daylight. An additional proof of the subjective nature of color, namely {{that it is a}} function of the eye itself and is only secondarily related to external objects, is given by the daguerreotype. It objectively shows that color is not essential to the appearance of an object. Also, people who are color blind would see color if it was in the object and not in the eye.|$|R
5000|$|Physical {{colors are}} temporary. They exist when light {{combines}} with cloudy transparent or translucent media, such as smoke, fog, or a glass prism. They are comprehensible {{because we know}} that they result from part of the qualitative division of retinal activity. Light is the external physical stimulus of the <b>retina's</b> <b>activity.</b> The more that we know about the effect (color as physiological fact), the more we can know a priori about its external cause. (1) The external stimulus can only excite color, which is the retina's polar division. (2) There are no individual colors. Colors come in pairs because each color is the qualitative part of the <b>retina's</b> full <b>activity.</b> The remaining part is the color's complementary color. (3) There are an infinite number of colors. Three pairs are distinguished by names of their own, however, because the <b>retina's</b> <b>activity</b> is bipartitioned in a rational proportion that consists of simple numbers. (4) A color's external cause, acting as a stimulus, must be capable of being changed and infinitely modified as much as the <b>retina's</b> <b>activity</b> can be infinitely divided qualitatively. (5) In the eye, color is a cloudy shade of white. This shadiness is the retina's resting part while the other retinal part is active. Newton's theory asserts that each prismatic color is 1/7 of the whole of light. If an infinite number, instead of seven, of light rays is assumed, then each color would be an infinitely small fraction of the whole of light. Schopenhauer's theory, however, claims that yellow is ¾ as bright as white. Orange is 2/3, red is ½, green is ½, blue is 1/3, and violet is ¼ as bright as white. The external cause of color is a diminished light that imparts just as much light to the color as it imparts darkness to the color's complement. Unlike Goethe, for Schopenhauer the primary phenomenon, or limit of explanation, is not an external cause, but the [...] "organic capacity of the retina to let its nervous activity appear in two qualitatively opposite halves, sometimes equal, sometimes unequal...." ...|$|R

40|$|Even {{before birth}} and {{the onset of}} sensory experience, neural {{activity}} {{plays an important role}} in shaping the vertebrate nervous system. In the embryonic chick visual system, <b>activity</b> in the <b>retina</b> before vision has been implicated in the refinement of retinotopic maps, the elimination of transient projections, and the survival of a full complement of neurons. In this study, we report the detection of a physiological substrate for these phenomena: waves of spontaneous activity in the ganglion cell layer of the embryonic chick <b>retina.</b> The <b>activity</b> is robust and highly patterned, taking the form of large amplitude, rhythmic, and wide-ranging waves of excitation that propagate across the <b>retina.</b> <b>Activity</b> waves are most prominent and organized between embryonic days 13 – 18, coinciding with the developmental period during which retinal axons refine their connections in their targets.

50|$|The {{range of}} all colors {{contains}} a continuous series of innumerable shades that blend into each other.

Color is the qualitatively divided <b>activity</b> of the <b>retina.</b> The retina has a natural tendency to display its activity entirely. After the retina has been partly stimulated, its remaining complement is active as the physiological spectrum or afterimage. In this way, the retina is fully and wholly active.|$|R
3000|$|In {{addition}} to the molecular guidance cues that affect the eye-specific segregation in the dLGN, a kind of ipRGCs also {{plays a role in}} the retinal axon targeting.

Further studies in the ipRGC ablation mice show altered <b>retina</b> <b>activity</b> pattern at P 6. These results indicate that the abnormal retinal projections in the ipRGC ablation mice may be partially due to the abnormal retinal activity in early postnatal days (Chew et al., 2017).|$|R

40|$|Voltage-gated sodium {{channels}} (VGSCs) {{ensure the}} saltatory propagation of action potentials along axons by acting as signal amplifiers at the nodes of Ranvier. In the <b>retina,</b> <b>activity</b> mediated by VGSCs {{is important for}} the refinement of the retinotectal map.

Interestingly, the light-activated hyperpolarization of photoreceptor cells (the a-wave) and the major “downstream ” components of the ERG, the b-wave and the oscillatory potentials, are markedly reduced and delayed in these mice. The functional deficit was not associated with any morphological abnormality. We demonstrate that Scn 8 a is expressed in the ganglion and inner nuclear layers and at low levels in the outer nuclear layer beginning shortly before the observed ERG deficit.

Thus, the effects on neuronal death and on lamination were independent, since either could occur without the other. These effects were mediated by retrograde signals (probably two or more) from the eye; they occurred too early for the alternative anterograde route via the optic tectum (which projects to the ION) to be responsible.
