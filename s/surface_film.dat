5|$|Many {{of these}} species have adaptations to help in under-water locomotion. Water beetles and water bugs have legs adapted into paddle-like structures. Dragonfly naiads use jet propulsion, {{forcibly}} expelling water out of their rectal chamber. Some species like the water striders are capable of walking {{on the surface of}} water. They can do this because their claws are not at the tips of the legs as in most insects, but recessed in a special groove further up the leg; this prevents the claws from piercing the water's <b>surface</b> <b>film.</b> Other insects such as the Rove beetle Stenus are known to emit pygidial gland secretions that reduce surface tension making it possible for them to move on the surface of water by Marangoni propulsion (also known by the German term Entspannungsschwimmen).|$|E
5|$|Many {{substances}} {{enter the}} sea {{as a result}} of human activities. Combustion products are transported in the air and deposited through precipitation. Agricultural, industrial, and sewage outflows contribute heavy metals, pesticides, PCBs, disinfectants, cleaning products, and other synthetic chemicals. These become concentrated in the <b>surface</b> <b>film</b> and in marine sediment, especially estuarine mud. The result of all this contamination is largely unknown because of the large number of substances involved and the lack of information on their biological effects. The heavy metals of greatest concern are copper, lead, mercury, cadmium, and zinc which may be accumulated by marine invertebrates. They are then passed up the food chain.|$|E
5|$|There is {{a broader}} {{spectrum}} of higher animal taxa {{in the sea}} than on land, many marine species {{have yet to be}} discovered, and the number known to science is expanding annually. Some vertebrates such as seabirds, seals, and sea turtles return to the land to breed but fish, cetaceans, and sea snakes have a completely aquatic lifestyle and many invertebrate phyla are entirely marine. In fact, the oceans teem with life and provide many varying microhabitats. One of these is the <b>surface</b> <b>film</b> which—despite being tossed about by the movement of waves—provides a rich environment and is home to bacteria, fungi, microalgae, protozoa, fish eggs, and various larvae.|$|E

Mindlin’s two-dimensional equations for a crystal plate with two elastic <b>surface</b> <b>films</b> are generalized to include the multiphysical effects of the films. They are used to study thickness-shear vibrations of a rotated Y-cut quartz plate with initial fields resulting from the mechanical, electric, and magnetic fields in the <b>surface</b> <b>films.</b> Frequency shifts caused by the initial fields are calculated and examined.

5|$|Mars is {{the only}} planet in the Solar System on which deserts have been identified. Despite its low surface {{atmospheric}} pressure (only 1/100 of that of the Earth), the patterns of atmospheric circulation on Mars have formed a sea of circumpolar sand more than 5 million km² (1.9million sq mi) in area, much larger than deserts on Earth. The Martian deserts principally consist of dunes {{in the form of}} half-moons in flat areas near the permanent polar ice caps in the north of the planet. The smaller dune fields occupy the bottom of many of the craters situated in the Martian polar regions. Examination of the surface of rocks by laser beamed from the Mars Exploration Rover have shown a <b>surface</b> <b>film</b> that resembles the desert varnish found on Earth although it might just be surface dust.

40|$|<b>Surface</b> <b>films</b> {{formed on}} edge plane pyrolytic {{graphite}} electrodes {{were characterized by}} attenuated total reflection (ATR) -Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). FTIR-ATR spectra revealed that the <b>surface</b> <b>films</b> consisted mainly of LiOCO 2 R (R = alkyl or lithium alkyl carbonate), Li 2 CO 3 and (CH 2 CH 2 O) n on both the edge and basal planes, while the formation reactions at the edge plane proceeded more rapidly than those at the basal plane. The major constituents of the <b>surface</b> <b>films</b> formed at 0. 1 and 0. 8 V were LiOCO 2 R and Li 2 CO 3, respectively. We discuss this difference {{based on the results}} in the literature. In addition, <b>surface</b> <b>films</b> derived from film-forming additives, such as vinylene carbonate (VC) and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC), were investigated by ATR-FTIR and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and the formation mechanisms are discussed by considering the reactivity of intermediate radical compounds...|$|R
25|$|Acetaldehyde is an {{intermediate}} product of yeast fermentation; however, {{it is more}} commonly associated with ethanol oxidation catalysed by the enzyme ethanol dehydrogenase. Acetaldehyde production is also associated {{with the presence of}} <b>surface</b> <b>film</b> forming yeasts and bacteria, such as acetic acid bacteria, which form the compound by the decarboxylation of pyruvate. The sensory threshold for acetaldehyde is 100-125 mg/L. Beyond this level it imparts a sherry type character to the wine which can also be described as green apple, sour and metallic. Acetaldehyde intoxication is also implicated in hangovers.|$|E
25|$|The rate of {{corrosion}} protective {{formation is}} temperature dependent. For example, at 27°C (i.e., a common inlet temperature in the Middle East), rapid film formation and good corrosion protection can be expected within a few hours. At 16°C, it could take 2–3 months for the protection to mature. But once a good <b>surface</b> <b>film</b> forms, corrosion rates decrease, normally to 0.02–0.002mm/yr, as protective layers develop {{over a period of}} years. These alloys have good resistance to chloride pitting and crevice corrosion and are not susceptible to chloride stress corrosion.|$|E

In Sherry production, the <b>surface</b> <b>film</b> of yeast known as flor {{used to make the}} distinctive style of fino and manzanilla sherries comes from different strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, though the commercial flor yeast available for inoculation is often from different species of Saccharomyces, Saccharomyces beticus, Saccharomyces fermentati and Saccharomyces bayanus.|$|E

40|$|The thermal {{behavior}} and structural changes of representative types of lithiated graphitic materials were investigated in solutions comprising ethylene carbonate (EC), ethylmethyl carbonate (EMC), dimethyl carbonate (DMC) and LiPF 6. We {{show that the}} pro-tective films formed on intercalated graphite electrodes upon cathodic polarization are stable in these electrolyte solutions up to 80 C, in DSC experiments. Upon increasing the temperature, between 80 and 120 C, reactions of the <b>surface</b> <b>films</b> with solution species take place {{and the level of}} the graphite lithiation is reduced. After destruction of the <b>surface</b> <b>films</b> on lithiated graphite at higher temperatures> 120 C, solvent molecules diffuse into the graphite particles and interact with Li ions therein thus forming reduction products. The later decompose upon further heating at temperatures> 200 C, with the formation of gaseous products. This results in an internal pressure within the graphite particles that causes their partial exfoliation in an endothermic process. While the protective <b>surface</b> <b>films</b> on the lithiated graphite are removed from the particles {{in the course of the}} thermal reactions, we have indications that <b>surface</b> <b>films</b> on fully delithiated graphite do not react with the electrolyte solution at least up to 200 C.
