5|$|Oganesson has {{the highest}} atomic number and highest atomic mass of all known elements. The {{radioactive}} oganesson atom is very unstable, and since 2005, only five (possibly six) atoms of the isotope 294Og have been detected. Although this allowed very little experimental characterization of its properties and possible compounds, theoretical calculations have resulted in many predictions, including <b>some</b> <b>surprising</b> ones. For example, although oganesson {{is a member of}} group18 – the first synthetic element to be so – it may be significantly reactive, unlike all the other elements of that group (the noble gases). It was formerly thought to be a gas under normal conditions but is now predicted to be a solid due to relativistic effects. On the periodic table of the elements it is a p-block element and the last one of the 7th period.|$|E

25|$|In 1908, he and Kodály {{traveled}} {{into the}} countryside to collect and research old Magyar folk melodies. Their growing interest in folk music coincided with a contemporary social interest in traditional national culture. They made <b>some</b> <b>surprising</b> discoveries. Magyar folk music had previously been categorised as Gypsy music. The classic example is Franz Liszt's famous Hungarian Rhapsodies for piano, which he based on popular art songs performed by Romani bands of the time. In contrast, Bartók and Kodály discovered that the old Magyar folk melodies were based on pentatonic scales, {{similar to those in}} Asian folk traditions, such as those of Central Asia, Anatolia and Siberia.|$|E

Following the fourth Test, ahead of Moores' announcement of the One Day International (ODI) squad, overall captain Vaughan resigned as One Day captain. Paul Collingwood of Durham was named as his successor. Moores named <b>some</b> <b>surprising</b> members in his squad, including Jonathan Trott and Dimitri Mascarenhas, who were both uncapped.

25|$|Amazons came {{to play a}} role in Roman historiography. Caesar {{reminded}} the Senate of the conquest of large parts of Asia by Semiramis and the Amazons. Successful Amazon raids against Lycia and Cilicia contrasted with effective resistance by Lydian cavalry against the invaders (Strabo 5.504; Nicholas Damascenus). Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus pays particularly detailed attention to the Amazons. The story of the Amazons as deriving from a Cappadocian colony of two Scythian princes Ylinos and Scolopetos is due to him. Pliny the Elder records <b>some</b> <b>surprising</b> facts pointing to the valley of the Terme River as possibly being their home: a mountain named for them (the modern Mason Dagi), as well as a settlement Amazonium; Herodotus (VI.86) first mentions their capital Themiscyra, which Pliny locates near the Terme. Philostratus places the Amazons in the Taurus Mountains. Ammianus places them east of Tanais, as neighbouring the Alans. Procopius places them in the Caucasus. Diodorus Siculus (Bibliotheca historica III, chapter 52) mentioned that besides Pontus Amazons existed much older race (at that time entirely disappeared) of Amazons from western Libya, and retells their mythological story which includes Atlantis and Greek mythology.|$|E

Jolene Blalock and Scott Bakula were the last actors to be released, and Bakula gave a speech thanking the production crew for making the cast feel welcome.
