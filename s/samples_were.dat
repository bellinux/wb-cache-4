The bone <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> heated in temperature of 500, 700, and 900 C° for 15 and 45 min. The results show bone crystals began to change during the first 15 min of heating at 500 C0 and above. At higher temperatures, thickness and shape of crystals of bones appear stabilized, but when the <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> heated at lower temperature or for shorter period, XRD traces showed extreme changes in crystal parameters.|$|E

50|$|The main {{difference}} between cluster sampling and stratified <b>sampling</b> <b>is</b> that in cluster <b>sampling</b> the cluster <b>is</b> treated as the sampling unit so <b>sampling</b> <b>is</b> {{done on a}} population of clusters (at least in the first stage). In stratified <b>sampling,</b> the <b>sampling</b> <b>is</b> done on elements within each strata. In stratified sampling, a random <b>sample</b> <b>is</b> drawn {{from each of the}} strata, whereas in cluster sampling only the selected clusters <b>are</b> <b>sampled.</b> A common motivation of cluster <b>sampling</b> <b>is</b> to reduce costs by increasing sampling efficiency. This contrasts with stratified sampling where the motivation is to increase precision.|$|R

30|$|It can be {{seen from}} the results in Fig.  5 that as the number of samples increases, the {{accuracy}} also increases.

For test and training samples, the result of Fig.  5 shows that the precision of the training <b>sample</b> <b>is</b> higher than that of the test sample, because the training <b>sample</b> <b>is</b> the feature set of the input learning machine fitting, so the precision of the <b>sample</b> <b>is</b> higher than the test sample.|$|R
