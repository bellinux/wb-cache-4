5|$|Agârbiceanu {{recalled}} {{an idyllic}} childhood, with summers spent tending to his father's sheep and {{sleeping in a}} stick hut. An avid reader of stories by Petre Ispirescu, he attended school in his native village and in Blaj, graduating from the Superior Gymnasium in 1900. Literary historians describe this as the period of his literary debut, which was a collaboration with Unirea newspaper. There, Agârbiceanu published a feuilleton (signed as Alfius), poetry, and, in 1900, the short story În postul Paștelui ("At Lent"). Agârbiceanu also served {{as secretary of the}} Blaj Literary <b>Society,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time the city's only Romanian-speaking literary body still tolerated by the Hungarian authorities. He soon became a correspondent of Răvașul, a Cluj-based newspaper, signing his first pieces there with the pen name Alfius, then as Agarbi or Potcoavă ("Horseshoe").|$|E
5000|$|Typically, {{a college}} would {{have two or}} more {{competing}} societies. The campus societies were generally intense competitors. Some examples include the Philodemic and Philonomosian <b>Societies</b> <b>at</b> Georgetown University, <b>the</b> American Whig and Cliosophic <b>Societies</b> <b>at</b> Princeton University, Social Friends and United Fraternity <b>at</b> Dartmouth College, <b>the</b> Philorhetorian and Peithologian <b>societies</b> <b>at</b> Wesleyan University, <b>the</b> Philologian and Philotechnian <b>societies</b> <b>at</b> Williams College, <b>the</b> Philomathean and Zelosophic <b>societies</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Pennsylvania, the Philolexian and Peithologian <b>societies</b> <b>at</b> Columbia University, <b>the</b> Clariosophic, Euphradian, and <b>the</b> Euphrosynean <b>societies</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of South Carolina, the Phi Kappa and Demosthenian <b>societies</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Georgia, the Linonia and Brothers in Unity <b>at</b> Yale University, <b>the</b> Miami Union and Erodelphian (previously Adelphic) <b>societies</b> <b>at</b> Miami University and Dialectic and Philanthropic <b>Societies</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. These societies were usually in a limited adversarial role; <b>at</b> Columbia University <b>the</b> Peithologian and Philolexian were competitors, and they maintained a rivalry that was friendly at best and highly charged at worst. In his famous diary, George Templeton Strong recorded that a Philolexian gathering was disrupted by [...] "those rascally Peithologians"; and firecrackers and stink bombs, tossed into the midst of each other's meetings, were usually the weapons of choice.|$|R

5|$|During the Han, {{the empire}} {{was divided into}} large {{administrative}} units of kingdoms and commanderies; within a commandery there were counties, and within counties there were districts that contained at least several hamlets. An average hamlet contained about a hundred families and usually was enclosed by a wall with two gates. At the center of social life in the hamlet was the religious altar (built in honor of a local deity) where festivities could be staged. Each district and county also had an official religious altar. The official reach of government extended {{no further than the}} district level, where county-appointed officials included the chief of police who maintained law and order and the district tax collector. However, the government was able to control local <b>society</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> hamlet level with their bestowal of twenty ranks.|$|E

5|$|In {{conjunction}} with the Renaissance <b>Society</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Chicago, Rashid Johnson exhibited The Evolution of the Negro Political Costume in December 2004.

He included a late 1960s dashiki worn by Jesse Jackson, a 1980s running suit worn by Al Sharpton in the '80s and a business suit worn by then United States Senator-elect Barack Obama. The presentation, which invited inspection, was as likely to evoke humorous response to the Jackson dashika as well as critical commentary about the presentation of political attire.|$|E
50|$|The {{origin of}} secret <b>societies</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Georgia {{are filled with}} mystery.

It was known that secret societies existed before the Civil War, but it isn't clear if the societies existed previously. Urban legends have it that secret <b>societies</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> university stem far before the 1860s. The university was established in 1785. Many point to the university's founder, Abraham Baldwin, for the origin of societies. Baldwin was an alumnus of Yale University, {{home to one of}} the most well-recognized secret society in the nation, Skull and Bones and its brother organization <b>at</b> UGA, <b>the</b> Gridiron Secret Society.|$|R

5|$|Keen {{to follow}} up his {{interest}} in aviation, Johnson started taking flying lessons at his own expense. He applied to join the Auxiliary Air Force (AAF) but encountered some of the social problems that were rife in British <b>society</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time. Johnson strongly felt he was rejected {{on the grounds of}} his class status. Johnson's fortunes were to improve. As the chances of war increased {{in the aftermath of the}} Munich Crisis, the standards of the RAF were relaxed, however, as the service expanded and brought in men from ordinary social backgrounds. Johnson re-applied to the AAF. He was informed that sufficient pilots were already available but there were some vacancies in the balloon squadrons. Johnson rejected the offer.|$|E

5|$|Terry-Thomas {{made his}} {{professional}} stage début on 11 April 1930 at a social evening organised by the Union of Electric Railwayman's Dining Club in South Kensington. He {{was billed as}} Thos Stevens, but only appeared as a minor turn. His performance brought heckles from the drunken audience, but earned him a commission of 30shillings. After this, he played a few minor roles in Gilbert and Sullivan productions by the Edgware Operatic <b>Society</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Scala Theatre. In 1933, he left Smithfield Market to work briefly with a friend at an electrical shop before he became travelling salesman of electrical equipment. He enjoyed the job and relished being able to dress up in elaborate clothing {{in order to make}} his pitch. In his spare time, he began playing the ukulele with a local jazz band called the Rhythm Maniacs. He took up dancing and formed a partnership with a sister of Jessie Matthews. The act starred in local exhibitions and at minor venues, and they earned well from it. News soon travelled of the couple's talent, and they were engaged as ballroom dancers at a hall in Cricklewood. He found the dance-style too restrictive and he left the act to try other aspects of entertainment.|$|E

5|$|The cricketer {{refused to}} think that his {{candidacy}} was simply there {{to make up the}} numbers, and he told Bolte as much. The start of the election campaign coincided with the 1954–55 grade cricket finals. Loxton took 7 wickets and scored 129 runs to help Prahran claim the title {{for the first time in}} 32 years, and was hailed as a local hero. It capped off a season in which he topped the competition batting averages and took the most wickets. In a close-run contest, the cricketer defeated the sitting ALP member Bob Pettiona by only 14 votes on the two party preferred count. He was aided by preferences from the Democratic Labor Party (DLP), which had broken away from the ALP during the 1950s, claiming that it was too soft towards communism; fears of left-wing influence was causing great concern in Australian <b>society</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time. Loxton polled 35.70% of the first preferences, well behind Pettiona's 47.25%, but received almost all of the DLP's 13.66% of the vote as preferences to end with 50.04%. The result helped bring Bolte's Liberals to power, and they stayed in office until 1982, by which time Loxton had retired.|$|E
5|$|The next {{objective}} was to integrate the refugees into South Vietnamese <b>society.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> time, {{there was a lack}} of arable land in secure areas. In early 1955, the Viet Minh still controlled much of the Mekong Delta, while other parts were controlled by the private armies of the Cao Đài and Hòa Hảo religious sects. The Bình Xuyên organised crime gang controlled the streets of Saigon, having purchased the operating license for the national police from Emperor Bảo Đại. The new arrivals could not be safely sent to the countryside until the Viet Minh had moved north and Diem had dispersed the sects and gangs. The urban areas were secured when the VNA defeated the Bình Xuyên in the Battle for Saigon in late April and early May. Lansdale managed to bribe many of the Hòa Hảo and Cao Đài military commanders to integrate into Diem's VNA, but some commanders fought on. It was not until early 1956 that the last Hoa Hao commander, Ba Cụt, was captured in an Army of the Republic of Vietnam campaign by General Dương Văn Minh. This allowed COMIGAL to send expeditions to survey the rural land for settlement.|$|E
5|$|This divine {{assemblage}} had a {{vague and}} changeable hierarchy. Gods with broad {{influence in the}} cosmos or who were mythologically older than others had higher positions in divine <b>society.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> apex of this society was {{the king of the}} gods, who was usually identified with the creator deity. In different periods of Egyptian history, different gods were most frequently said to hold this exalted position. Horus was the most important god in the Early Dynastic Period, Ra rose to preeminence in the Old Kingdom, Amun was supreme in the New, and in the Ptolemaic and Roman periods, Isis was the divine queen and creator goddess. Newly prominent gods tended to adopt characteristics from their predecessors. Isis absorbed the traits of many other goddesses during her rise, and when Amun became the ruler of the pantheon, he was conjoined with Ra, the traditional king of the gods, to become a solar deity.|$|E

5|$|Work on {{the stone}} now focused on fuller {{understanding}} of the texts and their contexts by comparing the three versions with one another. In 1824 Classical scholar Antoine-Jean Letronne promised to prepare a new literal translation of the Greek text for Champollion's use. Champollion in return promised an analysis of all the points at which the three texts seemed to differ. Following Champollion's sudden death in 1832, his draft of this analysis could not be found, and Letronne's work stalled. François Salvolini, Champollion's former student and assistant, died in 1838, and this analysis and other missing drafts were found among his papers. This discovery incidentally demonstrated that Salvolini's own publication {{on the stone}}, published in 1837, was plagiarism. Letronne was at last able to complete his commentary on the Greek text and his new French translation of it, which appeared in 1841. During the early 1850s, German Egyptologists Heinrich Brugsch and Max Uhlemann produced revised Latin translations based on the demotic and hieroglyphic texts.
