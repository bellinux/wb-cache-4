5|$|On 23 April 1917, Ball {{was under}} strict orders to <b>stay</b> <b>over</b> British lines, but still engaged the Germans {{five times in}} his Nieuport. In his first combat that day, using his {{preferred}} belly shot, he sent an Albatros into a spin, following it down and continuing to fire at it until it struck the ground. It was No.56 Squadron's first victory. Regaining an altitude of , he tried to dive underneath an Albatros two-seater and pop up under its belly as usual, but he overshot, and the German rear gunner put a burst of 15 bullets through the Nieuport's wings and spars. Ball coaxed the Nieuport home for repairs, returning to battle in an S.E.5. In his third combat of the day, he fired five rounds before his machine gun jammed. After landing to clear the gun, he took off once more, surprising five Albatros fighters and sending one down in flames. His fifth battle, shortly thereafter, appeared inconclusive, as the enemy plane managed to land safely. However, its observer had been mortally wounded.|$|E
25|$|The {{characteristic}} {{low profile}} of the U. S. military Humvee was designed in part to allow it tilt farther than taller vehicles, without a rollover, because its low center of mass would <b>stay</b> <b>over</b> the space bounded the four wheels even at angles far from the horizontal.|$|E
25|$|Dealing with Scandinavian affairs, Adam of Bremen relates in the 11th century Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum {{that the}} Sueones had many wives and were severe on crime. Hospitality was an {{important}} virtue and refusing a wanderer to <b>stay</b> <b>over</b> the night was considered shameful. The visitor was even taken to see the hosts' friends.|$|E

25|$|It {{is shown}} that York had gained a little freedom {{while on the}} {{expedition}} with Lewis and Clark. It is mentioned in journals that York went on scouting trips and going to trade with villages so he saw what freedom was like while doing that. He might have also been shown respect by Clark because Clark named two geographic discoveries after him; York's Eight Islands and York's Dry Creek. Also they took a poll of where they should <b>stay</b> <b>over</b> one winter and York's opinion was recorded {{even though it was}} last. This shows that York had a taste of freedom and possibly gained some respect by the fellow travelers on the expedition.|$|E
25|$|Life in Virginia {{saw many}} hardships. Elliott tells of {{domestic}} abuse by her father. She refused to <b>stay</b> <b>over</b> at friends' homes {{out of fear}} that, on her return home, she would find her mother dead. When Elliott was eight, she was molested by a cousin. In one violent incident, Ronnie Elliott dislocated his wife's shoulders and, during another, Elliott herself was threatened with a gun. At fourteen, Elliott's mother decided to end the situation; she fled with her daughter {{under the guise of}} taking a joyride on a local bus. In reality, the pair had found refuge at a family member's home where their possessions were stored in a loaded U-Haul truck. Elliott tells that she feared her father would kill them both for leaving.|$|E
25|$|At this point, Dolly {{was located}} 270mi (435km) east of Chetumal, and 230mi (365km) {{southeast}} of Cozumel; the tropical storm {{was expected to}} make landfall later that day. At the time of Dolly's approach to Quintana Roo, 100,000tourists were in the state, and 45,000 of them in Cancún. Originally, the storm was forecast by the Servicio Meteorológico Nacional (Mexico's national weather service) to make landfall between Playa del Carmen and Tulum. However, as the storm approached the Quintana Roo coastline, it lost its organization and its surface circulation center disappeared. When the storm was just offshore, it began reorganizing, and a new circulation center formed in the heavy convection on the northern sector of the storm. In essence, this caused the storm to briefly move parallel to the coastline, shifting the point of Dolly's first landfall to north of Cancún. The northward shift also caused {{the bulk of the}} storm to <b>stay</b> <b>over</b> water, reducing its impact on the Yucatán Peninsula.|$|E

500|$|While {{waiting at}} the airport for Laura to arrive, Jerry and George try to {{identify}} the possible signals Laura might give upon her arrival, with George explaining the meaning of various greetings. However, when Laura arrives, her greeting is ambiguous. Upon arriving at Jerry's apartment Laura removes her shoes and some excess clothing to get comfortable, asks for wine, and turns down the light and asks if she can <b>stay</b> <b>over</b> a second night. As Jerry removes his own shoes and begins to grow confident, the phone rings for Laura. When Laura gets off the phone she tells Jerry: [...] "Never get engaged." [...] Jerry then realizes {{that he has no}} chance with Laura, but has already committed himself – and his one-bedroom apartment – to an entire weekend with her, including a five-hour sightseeing boat ride around Manhattan.|$|E
