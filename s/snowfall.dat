25|$|The mountainous {{areas of}} Northwestern Greece (parts of Epirus, Central Greece, Thessaly, Western Macedonia) {{as well as}} in the mountainous central parts of Peloponnese– {{including}} parts of the regional units of Achaea, Arcadia and Laconia– feature an Alpine climate with heavy <b>snowfalls.</b> The inland parts of northern Greece, in Central Macedonia and East Macedonia and Thrace feature a temperate climate with cold, damp winters and hot, dry summers with frequent thunderstorms. <b>Snowfalls</b> occur every year in the mountains and northern areas, and brief <b>snowfalls</b> are not unknown even in low-lying southern areas, such as Athens.|$|R
5|$|<b>Snowfall</b> {{is highly}} variable. When winter low {{pressure}} systems move from south west to north east the Malvern area is {{often on the}} northern flank, meaning heavy <b>snowfall</b> while areas further south and east receive rain or no precipitation at all. However, when <b>snowfall</b> arrives by means of convective showers driven by northerly, north westerly or north easterly winds the area tends {{to be one of}} the least snowy parts of the UK, owing to its sheltered positioning.|$|E
5|$|There was {{abundant}} <b>snowfall</b> {{during the}} 1996–1997 winter. A total of 98.6inches (250cm) of seasonal snow accumulations in Fargo and 117inches (297cm) downstream in Grand Forks {{along with other}} record <b>snowfall</b> events covered the Red River of the North's watershed.|$|E
5|$|Across North America during La Niña, {{increased}} precipitation is diverted {{into the}} Pacific Northwest {{due to a}} more northerly storm track and jet stream. The storm track shifts far enough northward to bring wetter than normal conditions (in the form of increased <b>snowfall)</b> to the Midwestern states, as well as hot and dry summers. <b>Snowfall</b> is above normal across the Pacific Northwest and western Great Lakes. Across the North Atlantic, the jet stream is stronger than normal, which directs stronger systems with increased precipitation towards Europe.|$|E

5|$|Monthly average temperatures, {{rainfall}} and <b>snowfall</b> for four communities {{are shown in}} the attached graphs. St. John's represents the east coast, Gander {{the interior of the}} island, Corner Brook the west coast of the island and Wabush the interior of Labrador. The detailed information and information for 73 communities in the province is available from a government website. The data used in making the graphs is the average taken over thirty years. Error bars on the temperature graph indicate the range of daytime highs and night time lows. <b>Snowfall</b> is the total amount which fell during the month, not the amount accumulated on the ground. This distinction is particularly important for St. John's where a heavy <b>snowfall</b> can be followed by rain so that no snow remains on the ground.|$|E

30|$|Figure  5 c {{shows that}} the {{proposed}} direct nonparametric quantile regression QD predicts that for moderate temperatures, such as 5 °C to 10 °C, {{it is likely to}} have smaller but varied <b>snowfalls</b> in Buffalo than the regular QD predicts. For temperature over 10 °C, the QD predicts a much higher value snow amount than the regular QR predicts. On another side, for very low temperatures, such as −[*] 15 °C to 0 °C, the QD and QR both predict more likely to have extreme heavy <b>snowfalls</b> that may cause damage. Thus prediction of heavy <b>snowfalls</b> is related to cold weather forecasts. But the prediction <b>snowfalls</b> related to temperature from the QD is not as a simple linear relationship as QR predicts. We also note that lots of snow occurred between - 5 °C to 0 °C; the predictions form the QD are reflecting this fact and give varied predictions.|$|R

40|$|Observations of {{the size}} {{distribution}} for snowflakes and graupe 1 particles were made in a prefecture facing the Sea of Japan in two winters.

In <b>snowfalls</b> related to a strong winter monsoon the existence of numerous small particles was very remarkable even for high precipitation rates, and this was {{in contrast to the}} size distributions for extratropical cyclone. Based on differences in the size distributions, the precipitation rate R in heavy <b>snowfalls</b> under winter monsoon conditions was larger than that for <b>snowfalls</b> in cyclonic conditions under the same radar reflectivity factor Z. 1...|$|R

5|$|Besides {{the debut}} of women's ski jumping at these championships, the big winner in the jumping events was Austria with three medals and two each for Wolfgang Loitzl and Gregor Schlierenzauer. Adding the 10km mass start, the Nordic {{combined}} format was changed from 7.5km sprint and 15km individual Gundersen to 10km individual large hill (aka Large hill Gundersen) and 10km individual normal hill (aka Normal hill Gundersen), respectively. Estonia's Andrus Veerpalu became the oldest gold medalist at 38 when he won gold in the men's 15km event. Despite concern over the lack of <b>snowfall</b> that plagued event preparation prior to the championships, the championships themselves had an abundance of <b>snowfall</b> and wind that caused the ski jumping part of the Nordic combined mass start to be postponed {{for a day and}} the ski jumping individual large hill competition to be limited to one jump.|$|E
5|$|By Tuesday, {{the storm}} was rapidly moving across eastern Canada. Without the warm lake waters, it lost power quickly. This also meant less <b>snowfall,</b> both because of the fast motion of the storm {{and the lack of}} lake effect snow.
