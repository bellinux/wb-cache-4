This requires the creation of experimental aneurysms, which, ideally, should mimic the size and geometric features of human intracranial aneurysms. The {{purpose of this study was}} to characterize the morphologic features of elastase-induced saccular aneurysms in rabbits to determine whether the morphology of such aneurysms mimics that of human intracranial aneurysms. METHODS: Elastase-induced saccular aneurysms were created in 40 New Zealand white rabbits. Intravenous digital subtraction angiography was performed 14 days after surgery. Relative to an external <b>sizing</b> <b>device,</b> the following dimensions were determined: aneurysm dome (height and width), aneurysm neck diameter, and parent artery diameter. Based on maximal diameter, aneurysms were categorized as small (2. 0 – 4. 9 mm), medium-sized (5. 0 – 9. 9 mm), or large (10 – 16 mm), and as narrow-necked (, 4. 0 mm neck width) or wide-necked (. 4. 0 mm neck width).

40|$|Effects of polydimethyldiallylammonium {{chloride}} (PD) on coagulation {{behaviors of}} different Al-based coagulants were investigated in coagulation-ultrafiltration (C-UF) hybrid process, regarding the impurity removal efficiency, floc properties and membrane foulings. Floc characteristics, including floc size, compact degree, strength and re-growth ability were studied using a laser diffraction particle <b>sizing</b> <b>device.</b> Resistance analyses were implemented {{to explore the}} membrane fouling mechanisms. The results indicated that PD aid could increase the purification efficiency of C-UF, especially at low coagulant doses. PD-alum/PD-PACl contributed to large flocs, while alum-PD/PACl-PD gave rise to flocs with high R-f and D-f values. The results of ultrafiltration experiments showed that conventional coagulant, i. e,, alum led to a flux reduction of 52 %; while the reductions for alum-PD and PD-alum were 53 % and 34 %, respectively. The flux reductions for PACl, PACl-PD and PD-PACl were 60 %, 57 % and 39 %. Flux declines became more severe when the coagulated suspensions were exposed to increased shears and the suspensions coagulated by aluminum plus PD resulted in the least reductions in fluxes.

40|$|The {{removals}} of {{humic acid}} (HA) {{and a kind}} of antibiotic compound by enhanced coagulation (EC) employing various Al-based coagulants with, and without MIEX resin pre-treatment were systematically investigated in this study. A range of techniques were used to evaluate the purification behaviors and mechanisms of the coagulation and MIEX adsorption processes. The experimental results indicated that sufficient dose of Al-based coagulants removed 60 - 70 % of HA, while traditional Al- 2 (SO 4) (3) (AS) coagulant with low dose of 1. 0 - 5. 0 mg/L coupled with MIEX contributed to a removal rate of 85 %. For sole coagulation, Al- 13 (Al 13 O 4 (OH) (24) (H 2 O) (12) ](7 +)) only removed 11 % to < 23 % of SMX, while AS and polyaluminum chloride (PACl) contributed to comparable removal of about 40 %, indicating charge neutralization was not the major mechanism in SMX removal. The SMX removal could be improved to 68 - 78 % by MIEX pre-treatment. Dynamic floc sizes during coagulation processes were studied using a laser diffraction particle <b>sizing</b> <b>device.</b> The results demonstrated Al- 13 led to the smallest flocs, while the adsorption and sweep mechanisms in AS and PACT coagulation processes resulted in larger aggregates.

In order to support the growing interest in understanding the effects of UFPs on human health, Dr. Chen has developed a miniaturized electronic ultrafine particle <b>sizing</b> <b>device,</b> or mini-eUPS. This device utilizes many of the functions of equipment currently used in laboratory environments to test and measure UFP levels in aerosols, but has been miniaturized to maximize mobility and ease of use. The small size and weight of the device allow a unique ability for UFP concentration measurements to be taken during flight with a small UAV. Our group completed all the design, fabrication and planning to bring this technology from conceptual prototype to a working model capable of flight and routine use for UFP measurements.

40|$|Impacts of {{aluminum}} speciation and water pH on coagulation/diatomite microfiltration (DMM) process were investigated in this study. Three commonly used Al-based coagulants, aluminum sulfate (AS), poly-aluminum chloride (PACT), and Al- 13 ([Al 13 O 4 (OH) (24) (H 2 O) (12) ](7 +)), {{were employed to}} explore the role of Al speciation. Floc characteristics, including particle size and fractal structure under different coagulants and water pH levels, were investigated using a laser diffraction particle <b>sizing</b> <b>device.</b> The results indicated that in the dosage range of 1. 0 - 11. 0 mg/L, coagulation/DMM could effectively remove particles (97 - 100 %) and DOC (40 - 80 %), and as pH increased from 3. 0 to 10. 0, its purification efficiency was higher and more stable than separate coagulation. AS contributed to large and loosely structured flocs and thus alleviated the flux declines most effectively, leading to a flux reduction of about 50 %, while the reductions for PACT and A 113 were 71 % and 73 %, respectively. Neutral pH was found most conducive to the hybrid process and alkaline pH (9. 0) led to relatively larger flux than strong acidic pH (3. 0), especially for AS coagulation system. As pH changed, Ain led to the least variation in flux declines while both the removal efficiency and filtration flux fluctuated most obviously for AS coagulation system. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Although the {{clinical}} range of interventions for coronary arteries is about 2 to 5 mm, {{the range of}} diameters of peripheral vasculature is significantly larger (about 10 mm for human iliac artery). When the vessel diameter is increased, the spacing between excitation electrodes on a conductance <b>sizing</b> <b>device</b> must also increase to accommodate the greater range of vessel diameters. The increase in the excitation electrodes distance, however, causes higher parallel conductance or current losses outside of artery lumen. We have previously shown that the conductance catheter/guidewire excitation electrode distances affects the measurement accuracy for the peripheral artery lumen sizing. Here, we propose a simple solution that varies the detection electrode distances to compensate for parallel conductance losses. Computational models were constructed to simulate the conductance guidewire with various electrodes spacing combinations over a range of peripheral artery lumen diameters and surrounding tissue electrical conductivities. The results demonstrate that the measurement accuracy may be significantly improved by increased detection spacing. Specifically, an optimally configured detection/excitation spacing (i. e., 5 - 5 - 5 or an equidistant electrode interval with a detection-to-excitation spacing ratio of 0. 3) was shown to accurately predict the lumen diameter (i. e., - 10 % < error < 10 %) over {{a broad range of}} peripheral artery dimensions (4 mm < diameter < 10 mm).

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{review the}} safety and {{efficacy}} of the Amplatzer septal occluder for transcatheter closure of interatrial communications (atrial septal defects (ASD), fenestrated Fontan (FF), patent foramen ovale (PFO)).  DESIGN—Prospective study following a common protocol for patient selection and technique of deployment in all participating centres.  SETTING—Multicentre study representing total United Kingdom experience.  PATIENTS—First 100  consecutive patients in whom an Amplatzer septal occluder was used to close a clinically significant ASD or interatrial communication.  INTERVENTIONS—All procedures performed under general anaesthesia with transoesophageal echocardiographic guidance. Interatrial communications were assessed by transoesophageal echocardiography with reference to size, position in the interatrial septum, proximity to surrounding structures, and adequacy of septal rim. Stretched diameter of the interatrial communications was determined by balloon <b>sizing.</b> <b>Device</b> selection was based on and matched to the stretched diameter of the communication.  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES—Success defined as deployment of device in a stable position to occlude the interatrial communication without inducing functional abnormality or anatomical obstruction. Occlusion status determined by transoesophageal echocardiography during procedure and by transthoracic echocardiography on follow up. Clinical status and occlusion rates assessed at 24  hours, one month, and three months.  RESULTS— 101 procedures were performed in 100  patients (86  ASD, 7  FF, 7  PFO), age 1. 7  to 64. 3  years (mean (SD), 13. 3  (13. 9)), weight 9. 2  to 100. 0  kg (mean 32. 5  (23. 5)). Procedure time ranged from 30  to 180  minutes (mean 92. 4  (29. 0)) and fluoroscopy time from 6. 0  to 49. 0  minutes (mean 16. 1  (8. 0)). There were seven failures, all occurring in patients with ASD, and one embolisation requiring surgical removal. Immediate total occlusion rate was 20. 4 %, rising to 84. 9 % after 24  hours. Total occlusion rates at the one and three month follow up were 92. 5 % and 98. 9 %, respectively. Complications were: transient ST elevation (1), transient atrioventricular block (1), presumed deep vein thrombosis (1), presumed transient ischaemic attack (1).  CONCLUSIONS—It appears feasible to close interatrial communications and atrial septal defects up to 26  mm stretched diameter safely with the Amplatzer septal occluder. Short term results confirm an early high occlusion rate with no major complications. Careful selection of cases based on the echocardiographic morphology of the ASD and accurate assessment of their stretched diameter is of utmost importance. Further experience with the larger devices and longer term results are required before a firm conclusion regarding its use can be made.    Keywords: interatrial communications; atrial septal defect; Amplatzer septal occluder; congenital heart defect...|$|E

A mathematical model was introduced to relate the PFO balloon waist diameter to the closure <b>device</b> <b>size</b> based on the PFO transformation from a slit-like to a circular form during balloon inflation. According to this model, PFOs smaller than 8 mm should be closed with a 25 mm device, PFOs 8 mm to 11 mm with a 35 mm device, and PFOs larger than 11 mm with an Amplatzer septal occluder. In the first group, 36 patients (63. 2 %) received an appropriately <b>sized</b> <b>device</b> and six patients (10. 5 %) received an oversized device. In the second group, 15 patients (26. 3 %) received an undersized device. RESULTS: A comparison of the PFO dimensions in two views showed that the PFO slit was circular when the balloon was inflated.
