40|$|Standardizing a futures contract's {{specifications}} {{to enhance}} its transfer-ability is problematic for any commodity whose cash market adopts relational contracting procedures. Standardization implies the contract's value cannot be completely determined by competitive arbitrage order flow, inhibiting the market's price discovery function, {{and leaving the}} futures price susceptible to manipulation. These effects may result in the market's failure. The model, based on the theory of storage, predicts that contracts with a higher spread-open position price volatility {{are more likely to}} contain a range of arbitrage indeterminacy, hence to experience difficulties in sustaining trading. The prediction is supported in an empirical examination of 104 US futures markets. The range of indeterminacy also increases the informational requirements of spread traders, reducing the effectiveness of <b>spread</b> <b>arbitrage</b> in maintaining the equilibrium intertemporal futures pricing relationship.

Such systems run strategies including market making, inter-market <b>spreading,</b> <b>arbitrage,</b> or pure speculation such as trend following. Many fall into the category of high-frequency trading (HFT), which are characterized by high turnover and high order-to-trade ratios. As a result, in February 2012, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) formed a special working group that included academics and industry experts to advise the CFTC on how best to define HFT. HFT strategies utilize computers that make elaborate decisions to initiate orders based on information that is received electronically, before human traders are capable of processing the information they observe. Algorithmic trading and HFT have resulted in a dramatic change of the market microstructure, particularly in the way liquidity is provided.|$|R
40|$|Risk {{arbitrage}} is {{a strategy}} that seeks to profit from takeover offers by generally simultaneously purchasing and selling the shares of the merging companies. This dissertation consists of three essays that address three different issues related to risk arbitrage strategy: takeover success prediction, risk arbitrage for stock swap offers with collars and the determinants of risk <b>arbitrage</b> <b>spreads.</b> The first essay addresses methodology issues related to takeover success prediction modeling: case-control design vs. non-case-control design; logistic regression model vs. neural networks. The case-control design is shown to bias the intercept upward and, thus, tends to increase the estimated probability of failure, which will, in turn, result in a biased estimate of the expected return on each merger deal. Next, an adjustment to the probability estimates that removes the bias is explored. Second, neural networks is found to outperform logistic regression in predicting failed takeover attempts and performs as well as logistic regression in predicting successful takeover attempts. The second essay explores the risk and return characteristics of risk arbitrage strategy for {{a particular type of}} merger offers: stock swap offers with collars, utilizing an option type dynamic delta hedging strategy. A strong positive correlation in the risk return profile is found in a declining market and an insignificant correlation in a flat or rising market. This latter finding appears to be due to the increased probability of deal failure in market downturn. Contingent claims analysis shows a monthly abnormal return of 1. 8 %. The third essay studies the determinants of the cross sectional variation in risk <b>arbitrage</b> <b>spreads</b> and extends the literature by relating <b>arbitrage</b> <b>spreads</b> to transaction costs, supply of capital and price pressure. The empirical evidence shows that <b>arbitrage</b> <b>spread</b> is positively correlated with transaction costs. Limitation on the supply of arbitrage capital increases the deviation of the <b>arbitrage</b> <b>spread,</b> in either direction, from the efficient level. This finding is consistent with the limited arbitrage theory. Moreover, information costs dominate the selling pressure from the target shareholders in determining the <b>arbitrage</b> <b>spread.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the lessons that}} {{can be learned from}} the securitization of subprime mortgages during the 1999 to 2007 period and the subsequent large losses of financial institutions. It critically examines the complexity of the products that were created and the AAAratings that were assigned to tranches. It reaches conclusions on how the subprime experience should influence the way securitizations are structured in the future. 1 Credit Ratings and the Securitization of Subprime Mortgages During the 1999 to 2007 period securitization became increasingly popular in the United States. Many different types of assets were securitized: corporate loans, credit card receivables, auto loans, mortgages, etc. There are a number of reasons why securitization was so attractive. One is regulatory arbitrage. When banks securitized the assets on their balance sheets and bought the products that were created, they reduced their regulatory capital. Another is <b>spread</b> <b>arbitrage.</b> A bank may be able to package the cash inflows on the assets on its balance sheet so that the average interest rate paid on the products created is less than the average interest rate earned on the assets. A third reason involves {{what is known as the}} “originate-to-distribute ” model...|$|E
40|$|Simulating the {{movements}} of term structures of interest rates {{plays an important role}} when optimally allocating portfolios in fixed income markets. These movements allow the generation of scenarios that provide the assets ’ sensitivity to the fluctuation of interest rates. The problem becomes even more interesting when the portfolio is international. In this case, {{there is a need to}} synchronize the different scenarios for {{the movements}} of the interest rate curves in each country. An important factor to consider, in this context, is credit risk. For instance, in the corporate Emerging Eurobond fixed income market there are two main sources of credit risk: sovereign risk and the relative credit among the companies issuers of the eurobonds. This article presents a model to estimate, in a one step procedure, both the term structure of interest rates and the credit spread function of a diversified international portfolio of eurobonds, with different credit ratings. The estimated term structures can be used to analyze credit <b>spread</b> <b>arbitrage</b> opportunities in Eurobond markets.

40|$|Abstract There is {{a mythical}} question, well {{described}} by Duarte, Longstaff and Yu (2006), whether fixed-income arbitrage strategies are truly arbitrage or merely strategies that earn small positive returns {{most of the}} time, but occasionally experience dramatic losses. The question can be summarized in the anecdote “picking up nickels {{in front of a}} steamroller”. This master’s thesis studies two of these specific fixed-income arbitrage strategies: Swap <b>Spread</b> <b>Arbitrage</b> and Yield Curve Arbitrage. The methodology used in this master’s thesis is to apply these two arbitrage strategies through time from November 1988 to December 2011, using R language coding developed by the author of the master’s thesis, and to analyze their risk and return characteristics. The data used in this master’s thesis was gathered from different sources such as: Bloomberg™, Federal Reserve System (FED), Thompson Reuters Datastream™, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, Kenneth French and Yahoo® Finance. The main hypothesis of this thesis is that the global financial crisis of 2008 had a big impact on these strategies return indexes. This proved to be wrong. These two fixed-income arbitrage strategies seem profitable on the long run even under financial crisis cycles, as they generate positive excess returns, and Yield Curve Arbitrage strategy even with significant α...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} whether {{the direction and}} magnitude of the aggregate order-imbalance of the index stocks can explain the <b>arbitrage</b> <b>spread</b> between index futures and the underlying cash index. The data are for the Asian financial crisis period and hence entail wide variations in order imbalance and the index-futures basis. The analysis controls for realistic trading costs and actual dividend payments. The {{results indicate that the}} <b>arbitrage</b> <b>spread</b> is positively related to the aggregate order imbalance in the underlying index stocks; negative order-imbalance has a stronger impact than positive order imbalance. Violations of the upper no-arbitrage bound are related to positive order imbalance and violations of the lower no-arbitrage bound are related to negative order imbalance. Asymmetric response times to negative and positive spreads {{can be attributed to the}} difficulty, cost, and risk of short stock arbitrage when the futures is below its no-arbitrage value. The significant relationship between order imbalance and <b>arbitrage</b> <b>spread</b> confirm that index arbitrageurs are important providers of liquidity in the futures market when the stock market is in disequilibrium. ...|$|R

Results indicate that risk arbitrage returns are positively correlated with market returns in severely depreciating markets but uncorrelated with market returns in f lat and appreciating markets.

Using a contingent claims analysis that controls for the nonlinear rela-tionship with market returns, and after controlling for transaction costs, we find that risk arbitrage generates excess returns of four percent per year.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we develop and test a new method for interpolating and extrapolating prices of European options. The {{theoretical}} base originates {{from the local}} variance gamma model developed by Carr (2008), in which the local volatility model by Dupire (1994) is combined with the variance gamma model by Madan and Seneta (1990). By solving a simplied version of the Dupire equation under the assumption of a continuous ve parameter di usion term, we derive a parameterization dened for strikes in an interval of arbitrary size. The parameterization produces positive option prices which satisfy both conditions for absence of arbitrage in a one maturity setting, i. e. all adjacent vertical spreads and buttery spreads are priced non-negatively. The method is implemented and tested in the FX-option market. We suggest two sub-models, one with three and one with ve degrees of freedom. By using a least-square approach, we calibrate the two sub-models against 416 Reuters quoted volatility smiles. Both sub-models succeeds in generating prices within the bid-ask spread for all options in the sample. Compared to the three parameter model, the model with ve parameters calibrates more exactly to market quoted mids but has a longer calibration time. The three parameter model calibrates remarkably quickly; in a MATLAB implementation using a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm the average calibration time is approximately 1 ms. Both sub-models produce volatility smiles which are C 2 and well-behaving. Further, we suggest a technique allowing for arbitrage-free interpolation of calibrated option price functions in the maturity dimension. The interpolation is performed in parameter space, where every set of parameters uniquely determines an option price function. Furthermore, we produce sucient conditions to ensure absence of calendar <b>spread</b> <b>arbitrage</b> when calibrating the proposed model to several maturities. We use this technique to produce implied volatility surfaces which are suciently smooth, satisfy all conditions for absence of arbitrage and fit market quoted volatility surfaces within the bid-ask spread. In the final chapter we use the results for producing Dupire local volatility surfaces and for pricing variance swaps...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{theoretical}} methods and the empirical results {{of various types}} of arbitrage strategies in past numerical studies. Although arbitrage can be generally dividend into two categories including risk-free arbitrage and risky arbitrage, {{there is still a}} certain level of risk which arbitrageurs should take, no matter what kinds of arbitrage. Since there are limitations and transactions costs in conducting arbitraging strategies, the profit of arbitrage may be plentiful in theory but it could be misleading in practice after considering transactions costs and potential risk. It appears that all arbitrage strategies are theoretically sound, but it is debatable that arbitrage strategies will succeed in the real world. The key factors for arbitrage strategies to succeed depend on how to identify various types of arbitrage strategies, exploit market inefficiency, to reduce transaction costs, and to evaluate potential risk.

However, smarter trading focused on specific segments of the sample yield short-term abnormal returns. I find that trading strategies based on buying the following three categories of targets offer the highest level of abnormal return. The categories are; target firms in the largest quartile of the relative size ratio; firms subject to both cash offers and firms subject to cash tender offers. Typical of merger studies, we find that target companies experience highly significant abnormal returns on the announcement day, and slightly lower significant abnormal returns on the following day...|$|R
40|$|Arbitrageurs play an {{important}} role in keeping market prices close to their fundamental values by providing market liquidity. Most arbitrageurs however use leverage. When funding conditions worsen they are forced to reduce their positions. The resulting selling pressure depresses market prices, and in certain situations, pushes <b>arbitrage</b> <b>spreads</b> to levels exceeding many standard deviations. This phenomenon drove many century old financial institutions into bankruptcy during the 2007 − 2009 financial crisis. In this thesis, we provide empirical evidence and demonstrate analytically the effects of funding liquidity on arbitrage. We further discuss the implications for risk management. To conduct our empirical studies, we construct a novel Funding Liquidity Stress Index (FLSI) using principal components analysis. Its constituents are measures representing various funding channels. We study the relationship between the FLSI index and three di↵erent arbitrage strategies that we reproduce with real and daily transactional data. We show that the FLSI index has a strong explanatory power for changes in <b>arbitrage</b> <b>spreads,</b> and is {{an important}} source of contagion between various arbitrage strategies. In addition, we perform “event studies” surrounding events of changing margin requirements on futures contracts. The “event studies” provide empirical evidence supporting important assumptions and predictions of various theoretical work on market micro-structure. Next, we explain the mechanism through which funding liquidity affects <b>arbitrage</b> <b>spreads.</b> To do so, we study the liquidity risk premium in a market micro-structure framework where market prices are determined by the supply and demand of securities. We extend the model developed by Brunnermeier and Pedersen [BP 09] to multiple periods and generalize their work by considering all market participants to be risk-averse. We further decompose the liquidity risk premium into two components: 1) a fundamental risk premium and 2) a systemic risk premium. The fundamental risk premium compensates market participants for providing liquidity in a security whose fundamental value is volatile, while the systemic risk premium compensates them for taking positions in a market that is vulnerable to funding liquidity. The first component is therefore related to the nature of the security while the second component is related to the fragility of the market micro-structure (such as leverage of market participants and margin setting mechanisms) ...|$|R

This comparison is interesting because both countries are emerging economies {{with a similar}} free market orientation and the trading hours in both countries virtually coincide with the trading hours in New York. Argentina and Chile differ, however, in two important aspects: During our sample period, (1) The Argentinean market was completely under a fixed-exchange rate system, while Chile maintained a flexible exchange rate regime and (2) Argentina did not impose any restrictions on foreign investments, while Chile did. We find that the return distributions of the Chilean ADRs are {{significantly different from the}} distributions of the returns on the respective underlying Chilean shares. While the mean returns are the same, the return’s standard deviations are significantly different. In contrast, the hypothesis that the distributions of the returns on the Argentinean ADRs and the returns on their respective underlying shares are the same cannot be rejected.

40|$|There is a {{drive to}} {{transform}} the electricity industry in the UK from one based largely on fossil fuels to one based on low or zero carbon sources. The challenge of this transition, enabling a secure and sustainable electricity industry at an acceptable cost to consumers, has been dubbed the Energy Trilemma. Grid-connected electrical energy storage presents a potential solution to this challenge. However, the benefits of storage are split across different sectors of the electricity industry {{and there are a}} number of regulatory barriers preventing access to revenue streams. One accessible revenue stream is energy trading or price arbitrage. In current market conditions, arbitrage cannot provide sufficient revenue for electricity storage to cover its capital costs; however, some studies have suggested that with increased penetration of intermittent renewable power, electricity price volatility will increase enabling storage to become commercially viable through price arbitrage alone. This thesis examines the hypothesis that: Increased wind penetration leads to increased commercial opportunities for energy storage through price arbitrage. A linear programme is used to define the optimum operating strategy for a storage device, subject to the constraints of maximum storage capacity, charging and discharging rates, conversion efficiency and self-discharge. Initially, historic electricity prices from the British electricity market are used to investigate the value of storage with a low penetration of intermittent wind power. The results show that revenue is dependent on storage characteristics, with the performance of different technologies varying substantially. Furthermore, revenue is highly dependent on changes in market structure and fuel price variations from one year to the next. The thesis describes the development of a fundamental electricity price model based on the stacked merit order dispatch of thermal generation bidding to produce electricity in a competitive market centred around marginal generation costs. For peaking plant, an exponential uplift in price is applied to represent scarcity of supply. The implications of increasing wind power output are examined using projections of the location and capacity of future wind farms and spatially distributed hind cast wind speed data generated from a mesoscale atmospheric model. The analysis highlights that despite increased value being placed on storage in an energy system with a high penetration of wind power, opportunities for arbitrage are, in fact, reduced. This is a result of an oversupply of electricity on windy days suppressing peak electricity prices and reducing the daily price <b>spread,</b> which <b>arbitrage</b> exploits...|$|R
40|$|The study {{analyze the}} <b>spreads</b> of risk <b>arbitrage</b> {{for the sample}} of 102 {{completed}} merger and acquisition cases during 1999 to 2008. We trace these profits to practical limitations on risk arbitrage, including up-tick rule, price limits, short sale restriction. Results indicated it is overestimated the profits of risk arbitrage when price-limits and, short sale restriction has been excluded. Negative spreads in merger and acquisition cases varied inconsistently,so we suggest not to involved in such kind of cases. This paper exploits CAPM, Fama-French(1993) three factors and transaction cost {{to point out that}} the returns of risk arbitrage can not generate excess return. It is because we have 10 years periods but there are only 102 samples, making us utilize idle funds inefficient. Though risk arbitrage portfolio performance is not good, the spreads of arbitrageable day and the delisted day of target company is larger than 0. It is inconsistent with EMH theory. 本文欲探討真實世界套利限制之下的風險套利價差報酬率，所使用樣本為 1999 年 12 月至 2008 年 3 月宣告以換股合併或是現金併購為對價之合併與收購案例。資本市場交易限制包含平盤之下不得放空、漲跌幅限制、融券回補等機制。實證結果發現，若不考慮漲跌幅限制與融券回補會高估了風險套利的套利價差報酬率，另外本研究認為擁有負價差的樣本的價差變動並不一致，因此不建議納入台灣地區風險套利投資組合。 本研究分析風險套利投資組合，採用調整市場模式CAPM、Fama-French（ 1993 ）三因子模式，考慮交易成本以及真實世界資本市場交易限制，實證結果指出風險套利投資組合無法產生超額報酬。推測因為台灣地區併購樣本數較少，資金使用效率不佳，使得機會成本過高。雖然風險套利基金的表現不佳，但風險套利之可套利日與被併公司下市日前一日之價差報酬率卻顯著大於 0 ，推測為資訊不對稱導致與效率市場理論不符。第一章、緒論	 1 第一節、簡介	 1 第二節、併購程序	 3 第二章、文獻探討	 6 第三章、研究方法與設計	 9 第一節、資料概述	 9 第二節、研究方法	 11 第四章、實證結果	 15 第一節、價差報酬率分析	 15 第二節、時間序列風險套利投資組合	 19 第五章結論與建議	 21 參考文獻	 23 表 3 - 1 ：產業及併購目的	 25 表 3 - 2 A：換股合併資料概述	 26 表 3 - 2 B：公開收購資料概述	 26 表 4 - 1 ：篩選後扣除考慮手續費之價差報酬率	 27 表 4 - 2 ：考慮漲跌幅限制後之套利價差報酬率比較-換股合併	 28 表 4 - 3 ：考慮漲跌幅限制後之套利價差報酬率比較-公開收購	 29 表 4 - 4 ：換股比例變化下之價差報酬率比較	 30 表 4 - 5 ：考慮股東會融券回補下之價差比較	 31 表 4 - 6 ：考慮除權息融券回補之價差比較	 32 表 4 - 7 ：價差報酬率成對樣本T檢定	 33 表 4 - 8 ：併購的失敗與持有損失	 34 表 4 - 9 ：負價差報酬率下之的價差分析	 35 表 4 - 10 ：風險套利報酬	 36 表 4 - 11 ：風險套利基金報酬率	 37 表 4 - 12 ：CAPM和Fama French 3 因子實證結果	 38 表 4 - 13 ：被併公司下市日- 1 日投資收益	 39 表 4 - 14 ：被併公司下市日至宣告下市日之價差報酬率	 40 圖 1 - 1 ：公開收購簡易程序表	 41 圖 1 - 2 ：換股合併簡易程序表	 42 圖 3 - 1 ：價差報酬率中位數	 43 圖 4 - 1 ：價差報酬率篩選表	 15 圖 4 - 2 ：風險套利投資組合策略圖	 19 圖 4 - 3 ：風險套利累積報酬率	 44 附錄：被併公司停止買賣日 0 至- 30 日價差報酬率	 4...|$|R
