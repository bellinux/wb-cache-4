25|$|Thereafter, Maria wrote {{almost every}} day until 1947 and {{intermittently}} in the following years until 1951. She would write with a fountain pen in the notebook resting {{on her knees and}} placed upon the writing board she had made herself. At times <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>call</b> Marta to read back to her what she had written.|$|E
25|$|She {{participated in}} a war bond selling {{campaign}} with a sailor named Eddie Rhodes. Rhodes was in the crowd at each Lamarr appearance, and <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>call</b> him up on stage. She would briefly flirt with him before asking the audience if she should give him a kiss. The crowd would of course say yes, to which Hedy would reply that she would if enough people bought war bonds. After enough bonds were purchased, she would give Rhodes his kiss, and he would head back into the audience. Then they would head off to the next war bond rally.|$|E
500|$|Etty was {{considered}} extremely unattractive, described by his 1855 biographer Alexander Gilchrist—a great admirer—as [...] "Slovenly in attire, short and awkward in body—large head, large hands, large feet—a face {{marked with the}} small-pox, made still more noticeable by length of jaw, and a quantity of sandy hair, long and wild: all, conspired to make him 'one of the oddest looking creatures' in a Young Lady's eyes—what <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>call</b> 'a sight'; one, not redeemed (to her), by the massive brow, its revelation of energy and power, the sign-manual of Genius there legible." ...|$|E

25|$|For Zion’s sake, {{the prophet}} would not hold his peace, until Jerusalem’s triumph would burn brightly for the nations to see, and Zion <b>would</b> be <b>called</b> {{by a new}} name given by God. Zion would be a crown of beauty in God’s hand, and no more <b>would</b> <b>she</b> be <b>called</b> Forsaken or Desolate, but <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be <b>called</b> Delight and Espoused, for God would rejoice over her as a bridegroom over his bride.|$|R
60|$|I was as {{sorry for}} her as I was for myself. I knew all <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have to face in public-- the mean things people would say to her, the {{snubbing}} <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be <b>called</b> on to bear.|$|R
500|$|Meyer, the author, and Hardwicke, the director, {{had a close}} {{relationship}} while developing Twilight. Hardwicke wanted to embrace the experience and make {{the characters in the}} books come to life. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> <b>call</b> Meyer after changing a scene slightly, which surprised the author because, [...] "I've heard the stories...I know it's not normally like that when you adapt a book." [...] Meyer, a natural pessimist, was waiting for the worst but, instead, called her experience in the book's film adaptation [...] "the best I could have hoped for." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2005, Manoj and Babli {{began to}} show {{interest}} in each other. Manoj was {{two years older than}} Babli. All residents of their Karora village belong to the same clan of Banwala, a Jat community, and marrying within the clan is considered incest. Chanderpati recalled, [...] "We knew about Babli long before they decided to marry each other. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> <b>call</b> up often and I would sermonise to her about staying away from Manoj, fearing the fallout of such an alliance. They were, however, unconcerned and chatted for hours together. If I did walk into the room while they were talking, Manoj would quickly disconnect the phone and run off to avoid any questioning." [...] She continued, [...] "I even went to Babli's house and told her mother that Manoj and Babli were seeing each other. I asked her to dissuade Babli or quickly marry them before the word spread." ...|$|E
500|$|Recording {{took more}} time than usual since Madonna and Leonard fought [...] "tooth and nail" [...] in the studio. According to author Lucy O'Brien, the singer wanted to prove that her second chance as a record {{producer}} (following her previous album True Blue) was not a fluke. Leonard started working on the chord changes for the verses and the chorus. He had hired guitarist Bruce Gaitsch and bass guitar player Guy Pratt {{to work on the}} track. Pratt had in turn hired some additional drummers. On the day of the recording, the drummers canceled, which irritated Madonna, and she started shouting and swearing profusely at Leonard and Pratt. The producer then hired British drum and guitar players such as Chester Kamens, David Williams and Dann Huff. He commented that the choice was deliberate since he was a fan of British rock, and wanted that kind of attitude and quirkiness of the musicians in [...] "Like a Prayer", {{as well as the other}} songs of the album. Pratt was not fired, but later he realized that Madonna did not forgive him; <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>call</b> him at late nights for his opinion, and urgently ask him to come to the recording studio, only to be dismissed.|$|E

2500|$|On 18 April, May {{announced}} that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>call</b> a parliamentary vote {{to hold an}} early general election on 8 June, {{saying that it was}} the [...] "only way to guarantee certainty and security for years ahead". May had previously ruled out an early election on five occasions over nine months. The election was the first snap election held under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 after MPs gave May the two-thirds super-majority required.|$|E
2500|$|Other notable {{sketches}} include Mixed Nuts — a video depicting what <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>call</b> [...] "a typical family discussion" [...] {{which was}} later awarded {{with the second}} place in the 2006 YouTube Video Awards for Best Comedy — and Mac Beautiful, her first musical video, an ironic cover of the song You're Beautiful by James Blunt praising the beauty and efficiency of the Apple MacPro. Gambito later broadcast two videos containing original songs.|$|E
2500|$|As of December 2, 2015, Alvarez {{had refused}} to resign, which {{prompted}} a 16-hour sit-in by protesters at the Cook County building on December 3, 2015. Alvarez {{said she had been}} cooperating with the FBI investigation since November 2014, and asked her critics why <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>call</b> in the FBI if she was attempting a cover-up. She also defended Mayor Rahm Emanuel's comments that it would be premature to release the dash-cam video in light of the investigation, saying it [...] "was {{in the best interest of}} the investigation".

50|$|To avoid confusion, {{all male}} staff members are {{referred}} to as 'George'. This caused a dilemma when the first (and so far, only) female steward was hired in the 1980s. The problem was solved when it was decided that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be <b>called</b> 'Georgina'.|$|R
2500|$|At a statehouse {{press conference}} on June 22, 2015, Governor Nikki Haley, flanked by elected {{officials}} of both parties, including U.S. Republican senators Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott, and former Republican Governor Mark Sanford, called for the flag to be removed by the state legislature, saying that while the flag was [...] "an integral part of our past, it does not represent the future" [...] of South Carolina. [...] "We {{are not going to}} allow this symbol to divide us any longer," [...] she said. The legislature, scheduled to meet the following day for a budget session, must vote by a two-thirds majority to extend debate to the flag issue, and by two-thirds to remove the flag from statehouse grounds, although the legality of that provision has been questioned by some lawmakers. Haley said <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>call</b> for a special session if the legislature did not act.|$|E
2500|$|At 7:40am Duggan's roommate telephoned Duggan's {{girlfriend in}} Paris {{to ask if}} she had heard from him; he said Duggan had left the {{apartment}} and had not returned. Erica Duggan rang the roommate's cell phone and at around 11am, it was answered and passed to a Schiller Institute manager. The manager reportedly said the group was a news agency, adding [...] "We cannot {{take responsibility for the}} actions of individuals. We think your son has psychological problems." [...] She said <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>call</b> the local hospitals to see whether Duggan had been admitted. Shortly after this, the manager and Duggan's roommate, along with another member, handed Duggan's passport, bag and rucksack to the Wiesbaden police station. The manager told The Independent: [...] "I believed he had psychological problems, based on the conversations he had with people. I don't know what happened on the night he died, but the Schiller Institute played no part in his death." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the {{direction}} of White House Chief of Staff James Baker, Whittlesey also {{spent a good deal}} of time organizing communication of information about Reagan's policies in Central America and, in particular, the anticommunist [...] "Contras" [...] in Nicaragua. In 1983 she established the White House Outreach Working Group on Central America to help increase private sector understanding of Reagan's policies, including working with, among many other individuals and groups, the American Security Council Foundation, to produce anti-Sandinista propaganda (what <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>call</b> [...] "truth-telling") films, and the [...] Council for National Policy to produce materials that revealed the Marxist–Leninist orientation of the Sandanista movement. [...] Among those groups that participated in the Outreach Group effort was the AFL-CIO because [...] "the Sandinistas were against free labor unions." [...] Special Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs Constantine Menges cited [...] "the very effective public outreach staff headed by Ambassador Faith Whittlesey" [...] in his reflections on Reagan foreign policy.|$|E

2500|$|In May 2009, Zille {{accused the}} ANC of asset stripping. She {{related to the}} {{transfer}} of 1 000 hectares of provincial land in the Western Cape to a national body. The transfer was signed off by the former premier Lynne Brown on 21 April 2009, {{the day before the}} national elections. Zille alleged that the deal was done [...] "secretly, in bad faith and with an ulterior motive". The ANC responded by claiming that the land deal had been publicly tabled in Parliament several times over the years and there was nothing sinister about it. Zille later said that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>call</b> for a review and rescinding of the agreement and would lodge a dispute at an intergovernmental relations meeting, but the matter was resolved in January 2010, when the ANC's Minister of Human Settlements, Tokyo Sexwale, agreed to return the land to the province before the matter could be taken to court.|$|E
2500|$|Because he {{has lived}} with Sheldon for several years, Leonard knows him better than his other colleagues: this has led Sheldon to believe (slightly erroneously) that Leonard is his best friend. Nevertheless, Leonard often finds himself {{explaining}} Sheldon's behavior or serving as a mediator between him and other people in many situations. For instance, when Penny and Sheldon engaged in a fierce dispute, Leonard gave Penny Sheldon's mother's phone number so <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>call</b> her son and scold him for his behavior, thus ending the fight. [...] "The Staircase Implementation" [...] features a flashback to when Leonard first moved in with Sheldon. Leonard explains to Penny that he moved in despite the difficulty of living with Sheldon because the rent was so reasonable. Shortly after moving in, during a rocketry experiment Leonard, Raj and Howard conducted, Sheldon observed miscalculations Leonard made in mixing the rocket fuel and managed to avert disaster by grabbing the fuel and placing it in their apartment building's elevator. The resulting explosion disabled the elevator, thus explaining why the elevator is out of order {{for the duration of}} the series. Leonard explains that Sheldon, despite his tendency to alienate others, kept quiet about Leonard's destruction of the elevator. (Leonard cites: [...] "He didn't rat me out to the landlord, or the police.... or Homeland Security.") ...|$|E
