5|$|During its time, the West Coast Express {{was widely}} {{considered}} one of the most dominant line combinations in the league. The mid-nineties witnessed the increased popularity of defensive schemes like the neutral zone trap which slowed the game, limiting scoring and offensive chances.

The line's offense first style helped to popularize the franchise. They began to <b>sell</b> <b>out</b> home games on a regular basis and started to have a following on the road.
