30|$|Research in {{the field}} of {{environmental}} protection has shown that nitrate can be reduced to nitrite by ANME- 2 d, and nitrite can be subsequently converted to nitrogen by ‘M. oxyfera’, which belongs to NC 10 phylum. To date, NC 10 bacteria are the only known bacteria that can anaerobically oxidize methane; all other anaerobic methanotrophs are archaea (He et al. 2016). ANME- 2 d and ‘M. oxyfera’ are two anaerobic methanotrophs and exist ubiquitously in the anaerobic environment abundant in methane, such as freshwater <b>sludge,</b> <b>landfill</b> and wastewater (Wu et al. 2012). The denitrification process of nitrate and nitrite coupled to methane oxidation is named as denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation (DAMO), and believed as a potential process to remove nitrate and nitrite in wastewater even the DAMO rate is very low in vitro culture. It had been reported that DAMO can be extremely accelerated in an anaerobic ammonium oxidation reactor because nitrite produced from nitrate reduction can be jointly reduced to nitrogen when ammonium is oxidized to nitrogen by anammox (Chen et al. 2015). Therefore, nitrite produced from nitrate has two pathways to be converted to nitrogen in the mixture reactor of both DAMO and anaerobic ammonium oxidation when provided with nitrate, ammonium salt and methane simultaneously, and nitrite reduced from nitrate in the mixed reactor can be cleaned more rapidly than in the reactor with DAMO system alone. Actually, anammox also ubiquitously exists. The combined pathways of DAMO and anaerobic ammonium oxidation in the sludge of freshwater were proposed by Haroon et al. (2013).|$|E

Pyrolysis and incineration reduced organic matter of SS from 0. 78 kg kg– 1 -dry SS to 0. 16 and 0. 01 kg kg– 1 -dry SS, respectively. Heavy metals remained in SP without being volatilized, although Cd and Pb were transferred into the off-gas during incineration. In the batch leaching test with the leaching liquid-to-solid mass ratio (L/S) = 10, the pH of the SS, SP, and SI filtrates was 6. 3, 7. 9, and 11. 0, respectively.

Sampling gas through sorbent tube followed by analysis on TD-GC-MS is one of the reliable possibilities. It gathers sampling and preconcentration in one step and allows discrimination between all VMS, despite the difficulty to choose the appropriate adsorbent in order to avoid loss of analytes during sampling. In this context, this work deals with the comparison of different types of adsorbents based on the determination of the VMS breakthrough volume (BV). Although Tenax TA is the most widely used adsorbent, experiments show low BV values for the lightest VMS. At 25 degrees C, the BV of TMS and L 2 are, respectively, 0. 2 and 0. 44 L g(- 1) which can contribute to an underestimation in concentration during their quantification. Carbosieve SIII usually used for C 2 -C 5, did not adsorb light VMS as it was expected, and breakthrough volume obtained for VMS are more than ten times less than the values obtained for Tenax. On other hand, Chromosorb 106 and Carboxen 1000 in association with Carbotrap C and Carbotrap proved to be appropriated for VMS sampling, due to the high breakthrough volumes obtained for the lightest compounds comparing to the other adsorbents.

It has been found that the sludge in the landfill degrades rapidly and becomes stabilized within a few years. In the present study, the sludge from different landfill stages was characterized by particle size distribution, humic substances contents and elemental composition, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), as the landfill time increased. In general, the mean particle size of the sludge increased from 37 mm at day 0 to 143 mm at 300 days and the corresponding median particle size increased from 13 to 70 mm. The stability of particle size distribution can be assessed by the mean or median particle size. The humic acid (HA) and fulvic acid (FA) contents extracted from dry sludge after different landfill periods increased from 4. 2 and 2. 7 % of day 0 to 5. 6 and 3. 1 %, respectively, at 400 days, thereby indicating that the stabilization process of sludge in a landfill is also a humification process. The HA samples contained more carbon and nitrogen, and less hydrogen and oxygen than the FA samples, indicating a high degree of maturity and humification of these HA samples.

Several methods have been suggested on how to stabilize mercury waste but their big scale applicability is still under research especially with high Hg content wastes. Langøya Island {{has been used to}} store mercury containing wastes in a gypsum <b>sludge</b> <b>landfill.</b> The stability of Hg waste under this environment and its potential to stabilize mercury containing wastes has been studied. This paper describes the potential of the gypsum sludge (GS) to stabilize mercury containing wastes through laboratory experiments. A series of tests were carried out to investigate the adsorption of mercury to GS and its stability under different environmental conditions. Adsorption isotherm experiment was carried out by using GS with different concentration of HgCl 2 solution. The results showed a close-to -linear adsorption isotherm with coefficient of distribution (Kd) value of 2035 kg/l. Leaching test undergone to the gypsum-mercury mixture (GS-Hg) showed that there is little leaching of mercury with the excess pore water suggesting that the adsorbed mercury is stable under storage environment. However leaching test undergone on GS-Hg with sea water showed higher leaching of Hg from the mixture suggesting that any seepage from the sea to the land fill will mobilize the Hg bound to the GS. 1 -D diffusion tests were also carried out to examine potential evaporation of Hg from GS-Hg and evaluate the potential of GS to trap diffusing Hg by providing GS cover with varying thickness (0 - 15 cm) over the GS-Hg mixture. The experimental set up has been run for three weeks till the compilation of this report and the results so far found showed that GS has a potential to retard up-diffusing Hg, if not completely block. Setups with thicker GS cover (8 - 15 cm), has little or no Hg diffusion while there has been significant diffusion from thinner GS cover setups (0 - 5 cm). Over the three weeks, Hg was able to diffuse around 8 cm into the GS cover and the results correspond well with the results found from computer simulation by PHREEQC.

The objectives {{of this study are}} to investigate the geotechnical, physio-chemical and leaching properties of the dewatered sewage sludge generated from chemically enhanced primary treatment (CEPT) plant at Stonecutters Island in Hong Kong, and to assess the feasibility of <b>sludge</b> disposal in <b>landfills.</b> With regard to the geotechnical aspect of dewatered CEPT sludge, it is characterized by high water contents, high organic content, and high compressibility. Compaction test results show that CEPT sludge exhibits compaction characteristics similar to clayey soils. However, the lowest hydraulic conductivity of CEPT sludge does not occur at 3 % wet of its optimum water content. Pore water pressure dissipation of sludge during consolidation does not follow Terzaghi's theory probably due to its fibrous microstructure. Under an overburden pressure higher than 24 kPa, the relationship between the logarithm-of-hydraulic conductivity (log k) and void ratio (e) is linear. Results from the direct shear strength tests reveal that slopes of 20 ° can probably be constructed in a landfill site without causing any sliding problems. Compared with the {{disposal of}} pure CEPT sludge, the co-disposal of dewatered sewage sludge with municipal solid wastes results in a lower compressibility, a smaller settlement, but a higher hydraulic conductivity. On the other hand, from the environmental point of view, experimental results from four bench-scale column tests show that leachate from landfill disposal of CEPT sludge is characterized by high nitrogen, Fe and Cd content, which exceed the drinking water standard. Sludge compacted at a lower water content generates leachate with a higher concentration and a higher leaching rate than sludge compacted at its natural water content. If CEPT sludge is disposed in landfills, Cr, Fe, Zn and Cu might be released at a higher rate than other metals in its leachate.

Biodegradation of chemicals in wastewater produces <b>sludges</b> (solid wastes). <b>Landfilling</b> of <b>sludges</b> and solid waste has an associated potential for groundwater contamination.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{determination}} of organic contaminants in wastes and {{is part of the}} multidisciplinary faculty programme 'Biological waste in circulation between urban and rural areas - biology and flow of energy and material' which started at SLU in 1994. To ensure long-term sustainability of food production it is important to recycle resources such as the nutrients and organic material in organic waste. The biodegradable fraction of source separated household waste is attractive as raw material for composting and anaerobic digestion, because the products can be used in agriculture and horticulture. Quality is an important aspect on compost and anaerobically digested organic household waste, and it is important to ensure that the products are not contaminated. As the available information on organic contaminants in the biodegradable fraction of household waste and the products thereof is limited, an important goal with this work was to increase the knowledge of organic contaminants in these material as a foundation for future studies to reduce the environmental risk from these materials. Chlorinated paraffins (CPs) were found in fresh household waste. CPs are a complex mixture of chlorinated alkanes with varying (10 - 30) carbon chain lengts and varying (30 - 70 %) unspecific chlorination. The high numbers of isomers and homologues complicates the determination of CPs. We found that multivariate analysis can be used to interpret chromatographic data of CPs and this was used to characterise the CP contamination of houshold waste. It is presently impossible to pin-point the source of CP contamination using the data available, but most probably the contamination occurs during the collection of the waste. To further improve the determination of CPs an extraction method using high diffusion liquids, pressurised liquid extraction (PLE) was developed. PLE was shown to be a suitable technique for extracting CPs from complex matrices such as fresh household waste. A source close to the collection chain is also indicated for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB). The PCB-profile found in the fresh household waste resembles that of a low chlorinated technical product. The PCB-profile expected in this type of material would originate from waste of animal origin in which the low chlorinated congeners have been degraded and the more highly chlorinated and persistent congeners dominate. Differences in the degradation rate of PCBs between composting and anaerbically degestion of the waste were also observed. A third indication of a contamination source in the collection chain is the presence of the n-alkanes in the fresh and anaerobically digested household waste, which suggest a petrogenic rather than a biogenic origin. Since the major part of the organic fraction of household waste is of plant origin, much of which is treated with pesticides, it was expected to find pesticides in the waste. Many of the pesticides were not degraded during composting or anaerobic digestion, and two that were not found in the waste were found in compost or anaerobically sludge. In these cases the organic bulk material is mineralized more rapidly than the pesticides. The anaerobic biotransformation of nonylphenol mono- and diethoxylates (NPEOI- 2) was studied in <b>sludge,</b> <b>landfilled</b> <b>sludge</b> and <b>landfilled</b> municipal solid waste. The NPEO 1 - 2 are degradation products of nonylphenol ethoxylates (heavy duty surfactants) and are further degraded to nonylphenol (NP) which is far more persistent and ecotoxic than its parental compo...|$|R

40|$|The study {{examined}} the effects of co-digestion of sewage <b>sludge</b> and mature <b>landfill</b> leachate at the volumetric ratio of 95 : 5 % in primarily bioaugmented system. Bioaugmentation was carried out with the use of commercial product Arkea ® in the volumetric dose of 5 % and lasted three months prior to the co-digestion start-up. Co-digestion was undergone without bioaugmentation. The results indicated that in the first period (of three months) following bioaugmentation, co-digestion led to biogas/methane yields only 5 - 8 % lower as compared to anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge, and the differences were not statistically significant. Moreover, a comparable value of volatile solids removal was obtained. However, the effects became worse over time, i. e. a lower organics removal efficiency of 16 % as well as 9. 5 – 13 % decreases of biogas/methane yields were achieved by applying co-digestion for a further period (of the same duration). Co-digestion of sewage <b>sludge</b> and mature <b>landfill</b> leachate could be recognized as quite efficient in the system that was primarily bioaugmented with the use of Arkea ®. However, the beneficial impact of bioaugmentation remained for the limited period of three months after its completion. To sustain the favourable effects a periodical, repeatable bioaugmentation of the co-digestion system is required...|$|R

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this thesis has been {{to contribute to the}} understanding of the total process of water and sludge handling of small wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) within the framework of sustainable performance and optimum processing costs. This was done by conducting a case study on a WWTP in Poland. Substantial growth in the field of wastewater management is expected in the East and Central Europe. This is in particular true for the countries that recently became part of the EU and therefore are obligated to follow the many Directives that exists, including those concerning wastewater treatment. Consequently, Poland is expected to invest substantial amounts of money into their wastew- ater sector in the upcoming years. With over 15 million people living in the rural areas and majority of them still lacking access to proper wastewater infrastructure, the importance of small-scale WWTPs be- comes transparent. Four different configurations of technological solutions were evaluated for an existing small-scale plant in Poland. The benefits and disadvantages of combined treatment of raw influent and surplus sludge using fine screening and different solutions for end-of-line sludge treatment were assessed using Material Flow Analysis and Life Cycle Costing. The end use of the sludge was integrated into the Life Cy- cle Costing and tested for the alternatives of landfilling and incineration. The entire evaluation was done within the constrains set by laws and regulations. Combined treatment of raw influent and surplus sludge result in significantly larger concentrations of total suspended solids in the effluent and is not complying with the requirements set by the authority. Analysis of the economic feasibility show that composting as end-of-line sludge treatment is not benefi- cial for small-scale WWTPs. On the contrary, a significant cost reduction is achieved by direct utilisation of dried or dewatered <b>sludge.</b> <b>Landfilling</b> is not a preferred method from an environmental point of view, nor the best solution from an economic point of view for sludge management. Incineration of sludge to produce energy is both sustainable and economically feasible for small-scale WWTPs. The analysis shows the importance of choosing the right combination of technologies to comply with the requirements in effluent and to utilise the potential of saving notable amounts of money. A holistic approach taking into account the economic, technical, environmental and socials aspects is necessary to find the most sustainable solution. </p...|$|R
