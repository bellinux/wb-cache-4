2500|$|In August 2011, a Red Arrows {{pilot was}} killed when his Hawk T1 crashed {{following}} a display at the Bournemouth Air Festival, the inquest found [...] "G-force impairment" [...] may have caused the pilot to lose control; the Hawk T1 fleet was grounded as a precautionary measure and returned to flight status a few days later. In November 2011, the Red Arrows suffered another pilot fatality when the Martin-Baker Mk.10 ejection seat fitted to the Hawk T1 activated while the aircraft was stationary; the veteran combat pilot died on ground impact when the ejector <b>seat</b> <b>parachute</b> also failed to deploy. This resulted in the UK Ministry of Defence implementing a ban on non-essential flying in aircraft fitted with ejector seats similar to those fitted in the Hawk T1 after the death. The ban was lifted for Tornado attack jets but remained on Hawk T1, Hawk T2 and Tucano flights while the RAF reviewed evidence on those aircraft.|$|E
50|$|Robert H. Lawrence, Jr., died on December 8, 1967, {{when the}} F-104 {{he was an}} {{instructor}} pilot for a flight test trainee crashed and his ejection <b>seat</b> <b>parachute</b> failed to open. He was in the Manned Orbiting Laboratory program at the time, and could {{have been among the}} first African-American astronauts had he survived to take NASA's offer for all under-35 MOL candidates to join their space program when MOL was scrapped in 1969.|$|E

50|$|He made {{a series}} of {{high-speed}} (up to 800 km/h) ejection <b>seat</b> test and <b>parachute</b> test jumps in 1951.|$|R
50|$|From 2004 {{until the}} time of its {{dissolution}} the company had been working on a single <b>seat</b> powered <b>parachute</b> design for operation under the US FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles rules. Development included a version that would employ hand controls only for paraplegic pilots, but the aircraft {{does not seem to have}} entered production or received a formal designation.|$|R
25|$|The Mk.4 {{seat was}} {{designed}} as an improved, lightweight version of earlier Martin-Baker seats for installation {{in a range of}} lighter, smaller aircraft types. Improvements included a single combined <b>seat</b> and <b>parachute</b> quick release fastener (QRF) and a snubber mechanism to allow crews to lean forward without loosening the harness. The first successful ejection using a Mk.4 seat took place in March 1957, the aircraft involved being a Fiat G.91.|$|R
50|$|Ripstop fabrics {{are used}} in yacht sails and spinnakers, hot air balloons, kites, parachutes, and remote control hovercrafts. High quality camping {{equipment}} such as lightweight tents, sleeping bags, and camping hammocks tend to use ripstop {{in order to reduce}} the wear on their fabrics which are in direct contact with the ground or the wind. Swags, flags, banners, and other applications requiring a strong lightweight fabric use ripstop too. Ripstop reinforcements are incorporated into heavier fabrics requiring extreme durability, such as those used in Army Combat Uniforms, Nomex protective clothing for firefighters and other workwear, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu uniforms, outdoor and sports clothing, backpacks, and luggage bags. Self-adhesive ripstop patches are used to repair both rips and tears in other fabrics.Ejector <b>seat</b> <b>parachutes</b> made with ripstop are woven with an elastic-like fabric so that they stretch to allow more air to pass through at high speed. Then as the ejector seat slows, the weave closes and acts like a conventional parachute. This allows the pilot seat to slow gently, avoiding compression that could result in spinal injury.|$|R
50|$|Many {{designs of}} aviator's oxygen masks contain a {{microphone}} to transmit speech to other crew members {{and to the}} aircraft's radio. Military aviators' oxygen masks have face pieces that partially cover {{the sides of the}} face and protect the face against flash burns, flying particles, and effects of a high speed air stream hitting the face during emergency evacuation from the aircraft by ejection <b>seat</b> or <b>parachute.</b> They are often part of a pressure suit or intended for use with a flight helmet.|$|R
50|$|The {{museum has}} an {{extensive}} collection related to Oman's military history, national conflicts; with displays of weapons (such as guns and cannons), service uniforms, an external display of military vehicles, military music instruments, medals {{and even an}} jet aircraft ejector <b>seat</b> and a <b>parachute</b> on display.|$|R
2500|$|Like the Junior, the Topaz is {{made from}} composites. Its [...] span wing employs an NN-1817 airfoil, has an area of [...] and flaps. Dual [...] fuel tanks are located behind the <b>seats.</b> A {{ballistic}} <b>parachute</b> is an available option. The standard engine available is the [...] Rotax 912UL four-stroke powerplant.|$|R
50|$|Kraig Labs has {{successfully}} created at least 20 transgenic silkworm variants so far, each expressing {{different levels of}} spider silk proteins. Silk with strength equaling native spider silk has applications such as: car airbags, bulletproof vests, <b>seat</b> belts, <b>parachutes,</b> nets, and sporting goods. If the future transgenic silkworms are able to exceed the strength of native spider silk then medical applications could be using the recombinant silk. Potential uses in the medical industry are bandages that {{have the ability to}} reduce scarring versus using traditional bandages. The silk could also be used as a scaffolding material for artificial tendon and ligament repair.|$|R
5000|$|Like the Junior, the Topaz is {{made from}} composites. Its 10.76 m span wing employs an NN-1817 airfoil, has an area of 10.24 m2 and flaps. Dual 35 L fuel tanks are located behind the <b>seats.</b> A {{ballistic}} <b>parachute</b> is an available option. The standard engine available is the [...] Rotax 912UL four-stroke powerplant.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} {{equipment}} in buildings to facilitate emergency evacuations are fire alarms, exit signs, and emergency lights. Some structures need special emergency exits or fire escapes {{to ensure the}} availability of alternative escape paths. Commercial passenger vehicles such as buses, boats, and aircraft also often have evacuation lighting and signage, {{and in some cases}} windows or extra doors that function as emergency exits. Commercial emergency aircraft evacuation is also facilitated by evacuation slides and pre-flight safety briefings. Military aircraft are often equipped with ejection <b>seats</b> or <b>parachutes.</b> Water vessels and commercial aircraft that fly over water are equipped with personal flotation devices and life rafts.|$|R

The twin [...] fuel tanks are located behind the <b>seats.</b> A ballistic <b>parachute</b> is available. The controls include a single, centrally-mounted centre stick and electric trim. The standard engine is the [...] Rotax 912UL four-stroke powerplant.|$|R
50|$|In aircraft, an {{ejection}} seat {{is a system}} designed to rescue the pilot or other crew of an aircraft (usually military) in an emergency. In most designs, the seat is propelled out of the aircraft by an explosive charge or rocket motor, carrying the pilot with it. The concept of an ejectable escape capsule has also been tried. Once clear of the aircraft, the ejection <b>seat</b> deploys a <b>parachute.</b>|$|R
50|$|As {{a senior}} flying instructor, Squadron Leader Devayya {{was part of}} an {{aircraft}} strike mission which went to Sargodha airfield in Pakistan. Despite actually being a standby in case one of the first 12 aircraft dropped out, he joined the air battle. Devayya was intercepted by an enemy F-104 Starfighter flown by Pakistani pilot Flt. Lt. Amjad Hussain. Devayya successfully evaded the Starfighter's attacks. But the faster aircraft caught up with him and damaged his plane. Yet Devayya attacked the Starfighter and struck it. The Starfighter went down while the pilot Hussain ejected from his <b>seat</b> and <b>parachuted.</b> It is not known what happened to Devayya. The IAF Mysteres were short on fuel and efficiency. The Mystere aircraft was destroyed and it is assumed that Devayya died on Pakistani soil.|$|R

30|$|Fashion {{accessories}} such as handbags {{could well}} be targeted as sustainable items. Handbags are in part determined by their constant functions. For instance, many global brands, i.e. Freitag (Swiss), Sourcedlife (UK), Frombin (Korea), Shutoko (Japan), Vaho (Spain), and Looptwork (USA), have dealt in sustainable concepts by using upcycling materials for their bag designs, such as signboards, tents, seat belts, car <b>seats,</b> truck covers, <b>parachutes,</b> fire hoses, and coffee sacks. In 2009, French luxury brand, Hermès, launched an upcycled brand, ‘Petit h’, made with one-of-a-kind pieces of jewellery, accessories, toys, and even furniture items crafted from the atelier’s cast-off scraps of leather, silk scarves, porcelain, enamel, and hardware (Hermes’ up-cycled Petit h concept pops up in Costa Mesa. Los Angeles Times, June 12, 2014).|$|R
5000|$|Chief Test Pilot Waterton {{was making}} a test flight in a {{prototype}} jet all-purpose fighter and, whilst travelling at high speed {{at the height of}} about 3,000 feet, elevator flutter developed and both elevators became detached from the aircraft. This left the pilot with practically no control of his aircraft in pitch. Waterton climbed the aircraft to 10,000 feet and experimented with {{what was left of the}} control, the paramount factor in effecting a safe landing. He found that it was possible to retain some control down to a speed roughly half as fast again as the normal landing speed. Knowing that a crash would put back seriously the development and production he decided to land the aircraft despite having at his command an ejector <b>seat</b> and <b>parachute.</b> He landed the machine heavily owing to the lack of control and the undercarriage gave way. After the crashed aircraft came to rest, fire broke out and Waterton found great difficulty in freeing himself owing to a jammed [...] "hood. Eventually he did get out of the wreck. By then the flames had reached the area of the cockpit but despite this, he climbed back into the fuselage and salvaged the automatic records relating to the original aerodynamic and structural failures. The behaviour of Chief Test Pilot Waterton was exemplary and beyond the call of duty and his courage was outstanding. London Gazette ...|$|R
500|$|See {{completed}} a full circle {{to the left}} {{at an altitude of}} , and announced his intention to land on the southwest runway (24). With landing gear down and full flaps, the plane dropped quickly but too far left of the runway. See turned on his afterburner to increase power while pulling up and turning hard right. Seconds later, at 8:58a.m. CST, the plane struck the roof of McDonnell Building 101 on the northeast side of the airport. [...] It lost its right wing and landing gear on impact, then cartwheeled and crashed in a parking lot beyond the building which was in use as a construction staging area. See was thrown clear of the cockpit and was found in the parking lot still strapped to his ejection <b>seat</b> with the <b>parachute</b> partially open. [...] Bassett was decapitated on impact, his severed head found later in the day in the rafters of the damaged assembly building.|$|R
2500|$|As Chief of the Special Projects Branch of the Aircraft Laboratory at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base from 1948 to 1950, then-Major Murray led {{the effort}} to persuade {{aircraft}} manufacturers and operational Air Force units to accept the ejection seat as a safe and effective means of escape at high speed. The seat testing took place at Edwards Air Force Base located in Palmdale, California. The seat was attached to a sled that was connected to a stretch of rail road tracks. It was propelled by rockets at {{a high rate of}} speed which at the end launched a dummy from the <b>seat</b> with a <b>parachute.</b> When it came time to actually attempt an ejection from an aircraft in flight, Major Murray discovered the seat didn't fit properly in the cockpit of the aircraft that it was designed for, so ultimately the seat chassis was sent to Van Nuys Airport in Los Angeles for modifications. Upon the corrections to the seat it was a [...] "Go". Major Murray was flying in an aircraft next to the test plane. The test plane was flown by a close friend and test pilot. The test pilot began to steer the plane towards the ground and Major Murray witnessed the first ejection from the air. The test rail road tracks are still in existence today at Edwards A.F.B. as a reminder of the profound safety achievement and life saver for pilots.|$|R
