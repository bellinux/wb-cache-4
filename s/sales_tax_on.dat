5|$|Virginia {{collects}} {{personal income}} tax in five income brackets, ranging from 3.0% to 5.75%. The state sales and use tax rate is 4.3%, while the tax rate on food is 1.5%. There is an additional 1% local tax, {{for a total of}} a 5.3% combined <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> most Virginia purchases and 2.5% on most food.

Tangible personal property also is taxed at the local level and is based on a percentage or percentages of original cost.|$|E
5|$|Sampson's {{agenda for}} the 1930 session {{was lost in the}} fights over Ben Johnson and Cumberland Falls. His calls for funding the free {{textbook}} program, compulsory sterilization of the mentally ill, and restrictions on chain stores were ignored. Instead, the legislature continued eroding his gubernatorial powers, including the power to appoint members of the textbook commission. With nearly all of the governor's powers stripped away and given to a three-person commission, Lieutenant Governor James Breathitt, Jr. became the de facto governor for the remainder of Sampson's term. The General Assembly pursued its own agenda, passing a mandatory driver's license law, a revised election law, and a <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> retail stores. They also allocated funding for the purchase of what would become Mammoth Cave National Park. Sampson vetoed 12 bills during the 1930 session, but the legislature overrode 11 of them.|$|E

5|$|In 1956, {{the party}} adopted the Winnipeg Declaration, {{a far more}} {{moderate}} proposal than its previous governing document, the 1933 Regina Manifesto. For example, the Regina Manifesto pledged the CCF to the eradication of capitalism; the Winnipeg Declaration recognized the utility of private ownership of business, and stated {{that the government should}} own business only when it was in the public interest. In its election campaign, the CCF did not promise to nationalize any industries. It promised changes in the tax code in order to increase the redistribution of wealth in Canada. It pledged to increase exemptions from income tax, to allow medical expenses to be considered deductions from income for tax purposes, and to eliminate <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> food, clothing, and other necessities of life. It also promised to raise taxes on the higher income brackets and to eliminate the favourable tax treatment of corporate dividends.|$|E
5|$|Minnesota has a {{progressive}} income tax structure; the four brackets of {{state income tax}} rates are 5.35, 7.05, 7.85 and 9.85 percent. As of 2008, Minnesota was ranked 12th {{in the nation in}} per capita total state and local taxes. In 2008, Minnesotans paid 10.2 percent of their income in state and local taxes; the U.S. average was 9.7 percent. The state sales tax in Minnesota is 6.875 percent, but there is no <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> clothing, prescription drug medications, some services, or food items for home consumption. The state legislature may allow municipalities to institute local sales taxes and special local taxes, such as the 0.5 percent supplemental sales tax in Minneapolis. Excise taxes are levied on alcohol, tobacco, and motor fuel. The state imposes a use tax on items purchased elsewhere but used within Minnesota. Owners of real property in Minnesota pay property tax to their county, municipality, school district, and special taxing districts.|$|E

5|$|Wilkinson opened Wallace's Book Store in June 1965 after a local {{stockbroker}} {{helped him}} raise the initial capital needed through a public stock offering. By this time, Kentucky had adopted free textbook legislation {{at the behest}} of Governor Julian Carroll, so Wilkinson transitioned to selling college textbooks to students at the University of Kentucky. Throughout the 1960s, Wilkinson refused to pay the state <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> his transactions; he and Joe Kennedy, the owner of Kennedy Book Store, both claimed that paying the tax put them at a competitive disadvantage with the university's book store, which did not pay state taxes because it was operated by the university, a tax exempt entity. In 1977, the state Board of Tax Appeals ruled that all three bookstores should have been paying the tax, but by this time, the statute of limitations had expired, and none of the three were required to pay any back taxes. Wallace's Book Store continued to expand rapidly, opening retail stores in twenty-eight states and becoming one of the country's largest book firms. In January 1971, he considered issuing more stock to raise capital to buy Providence, Rhode Island-based Barnes & Noble, but the executive committee of Wallace's was averse to purchasing a company so far away and blocked the move. In April 1977, Wilkinson was cited for false and misleading advertisement in conjunction with claims made in radio ads for Wallace's Book Store claiming they were offering the first discounts in history on new college textbooks. In a court filing, Wilkinson admitted the claims were untrue, promised to stop airing the ads, and agreed to refund any money overpaid by customers.|$|E

25|$|Paramus {{is known}} for its {{multitude}} of stores and malls. It has five major indoor shopping centers, serving residents in the areas of Bergen County and Passaic County in New Jersey and Rockland County in New York. New Jersey does not levy a <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> clothes and shoes, which makes it an attractive shopping destination for people even further away in New York City, who pay <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> clothing items above $110 in price, in addition to the lower standard rate of 7% in New Jersey, compared to 8.875% in New York City. The spending levels generated by the malls have made Paramus one of the top retail ZIP codes in the country.|$|E
