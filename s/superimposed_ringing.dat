Among the chaperonins, the eukaryotic cytosolic chaperonin CCT is the most complex, not only with regard to its subunit composition but also with respect to its function, still not well understood. Unlike the more well studied eubacterial chaperonin GroEL, which binds any protein that presents stretches of hydrophobic residues, CCT recognises in its substrates specific binding determinants and interacts with them through particular combinations of CCT subunits. Folding then occurs after the conformational changes induced in the chaperonin upon nucleotide binding have occurred, through a mechanism that, although still poorly defined, clearly differs from the one established for GroEL. Although CCT seems to be mainly involved in the folding of actin and tubulin, other substrates involved in various cellular roles are beginning to be characterised, including many WD 40 -repeat, 7 -blade propeller proteins...|$|R
40|$|The PS-Booster {{consists}} of four <b>superimposed</b> <b>rings.</b> The bending magnets are made from single yokes with four 'C'-type gaps. This geometry leads to an inherent asymmetry in the flux distribution around inner (II, III) and outer (IV, I) rings. From 1999 the PS-Booster is foreseen to be operated at the ejection/transfer energy of 1. 4 GeV in view of LHC operation. The {{aim of this study}} was the investigation of saturation effects in the main bending magnets at energies above 1 GeV. It was found that the rather special yoke geometry leads to strong saturation around the outer gaps. This in turn causes a difference of nearly 1 % in the bending fields between inner and outer rings at a beam energy of 1. 4 GeV. This cannot be compensated with the existing BDL-correction system. To make the operation of the PS-Booster possible at 1. 4 GeV, different solutions are discussed and the use of an additional trim power supply is proposed...|$|R

30|$|Flat panel {{detectors}} (FPDs) {{are used}} to obtain high resolution computed tomography (CT) image. But due to technical faults of these FPDs, ring artifacts are often generated in the CT image. These artifacts {{may be caused by}} damaged detector pixels, mis-calibrated detector pixels, impurities in scintillator crystal or dust on scintillator screens. All these phenomena attribute to the generation of a number of concentric <b>superimposed</b> <b>rings</b> in the reconstructed image which correspond to stripe artifacts in sinogram domain. These rings can be of different types and of different intensities. As for example, completely damaged detector pixels cause strong isolated or band rings. Similar artifacts also arise from dusty or damaged scintillator screens [1]. On the other hand, mis-calibrated detector elements lead to less strong ring artifacts in the tomographic image [2]. These artifacts are also sensitive to tube voltage. Changes in the tube voltage alter the intensity of the ring. As these artifacts severely degrades the image quality by obscuring significant image details, it is necessary to remove them, otherwise, post processing, such as noise reduction or segmentation of image information, becomes quite difficult.|$|R

The aberrant finding was described as a <b>superimposed</b> <b>ring</b> corresponding to a molecular spacing of around 4. 44 nm, probably arising from randomly orientated lipid bilayers of the plasma membrane of the hair cells. The x-ray diffraction studies were performed with synchrotron radiation according to previously published protocols (3 – 5). James et al.

Following the quadrangular resection and ring annuloplasty simulations, patient-specific annular motion and physiologic transvalvular pressure gradient were implemented and dynamic finite element simulation of MV function was performed.

Excessive stress concentration was found along the free marginal edge of the posterior leaflet involving the chordal rupture. Following the virtual resection and ring annuloplasty, the severity of the posterior leaflet prolapse markedly decreased. Excessive stress concentration disappeared over both anterior and posterior leaflets, and complete leaflet coaptation was effectively restored.

The binary complex of the truncated enzyme with cyanocobalamin and the ternary complex with cyanocobalamin or adeninylpentylcobalamin and substrates were crystallized, and their x-ray structures were analyzed. The enzyme exists as a trimer of the (αβ) 2 dimer. The active site is in the (β/α) 8 barrel of the α-subunit; the β-subunit covers {{the lower part of the}} cobalamin that is bound in the interface of the α- and β-subunits. The structure complexed with adeninylpentylcobalamin revealed the presence of an adenine ring-binding pocket in the enzyme that accommodates the adenine moiety through a hydrogen bond network.

40|$|Abstract Background Ring {{artifacts}} are the concentric <b>rings</b> <b>superimposed</b> on the tomographic images often {{caused by}} the defective and insufficient calibrated detector elements {{as well as by}} the damaged scintillator crystals of the flat panel detector. It may be also generated by objects attenuating X-rays very differently in different projection direction. Ring artifact reduction techniques so far reported in the literature can be broadly classified into two groups. One category of the approaches is based on the sinogram processing also known as the pre-processing techniques and the other category of techniques perform processing on the 2 -D reconstructed images, recognized as the post-processing techniques in the literature. The strength and weakness of these categories of approaches are yet to be explored from a common platform. Method In this paper, a comparative study of the two categories of ring artifact reduction techniques basically designed for the multi-slice CT instruments is presented from a common platform. For comparison, two representative algorithms from each of the two categories are selected from the published literature. A very recently reported state-of-the-art sinogram domain ring artifact correction method that classifies the ring artifacts according to their strength and then corrects the artifacts using class adaptive correction schemes is also included in this comparative study. The first sinogram domain correction method uses a wavelet based technique to detect the corrupted pixels and then using a simple linear interpolation technique estimates the responses of the bad pixels. The second sinogram based correction method performs all the filtering operations in the transform domain, i. e., in the wavelet and Fourier domain. On the other hand, the two post-processing based correction techniques actually operate on the polar transform domain of the reconstructed CT images. The first method extracts the ring artifact template vector using a homogeneity test and then corrects the CT images by subtracting the artifact template vector from the uncorrected images. The second post-processing based correction technique performs median and mean filtering on the reconstructed images to produce the corrected images. Results The performances of the comparing algorithms have been tested by using both quantitative and perceptual measures. For quantitative analysis, two different numerical performance indices are chosen. On the other hand, different types of artifact patterns, e. g., single/band ring, artifacts from defective and mis-calibrated detector elements, rings in highly structural object and also in hard object, rings from different flat-panel detectors are analyzed to perceptually investigate the strength and weakness of the five methods. An investigation has been also carried out to compare the efficacy of these algorithms in correcting the volume images from a cone beam CT with the parameters determined from one particular slice. Finally, the capability of each correction technique in retaining the image information (e. g., small object at the iso-center) accurately in the corrected CT image has been also tested. Conclusions The results show that the performances of the algorithms are limited and none is fully suitable for correcting different types of ring artifacts without introducing processing distortion to the image structure. To achieve the diagnostic quality of the corrected slices a combination of the two approaches (sinogram- and post-processing) can be used. Also the comparing methods are not suitable for correcting the volume images from a cone beam flat-panel detector based CT. </p...|$|R
40|$|The flyback {{pulse-width}} modulated (PWM) DC-DC {{power converter}} {{is a very}} important circuit in switching mode power supply (SMPS) converters for low power applications. The main drawback of the conventional single-switch flyback converter is the high turn-off voltage stress suffered by the switch. The high voltage transients are caused by the resonant behavior of the transformer leakage inductance and the transistor output capacitance, resulting in <b>ringing</b> <b>superimposed</b> on the steady-state switch voltage level. This requires a transistor with higher voltage rating. However, a transistor with higher voltage rating has higher on-resistance causing higher conduction loss. The high voltage ringing also increases the switching loss. In addition, the switch voltage stress is not easily predictable because {{it is difficult to determine}} the magnitude of ringing during the design stage. The two-switch flyback DC-DC converter is an extended version of the single-switch flyback converter. The circuit arrangement with an addition of a power transistor and two clamping diodes to the conventional single-switch flyback converter leads to the two-switch flyback PWM DC-DC converter, which effectively reduces the switch overvoltage and eliminates the uncertainty of its value. The clamping diodes in the two-switch flyback converter clamps the voltage across each switch to the DC input voltage and also provide a path to return most of the energy stored in the transformer leakage inductance to the DC input source. In the first part of this research, detailed steady-state analyses of the two-switch flyback PWM DC-DC converter for continuous conduction mode (CCM) and discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) are performed. The transistor output capacitance and the transformer leakage inductance are included in the analyses. Design equations for both CCM and DCM operation modes are derived. Furthermore, by incorporating an active clamp circuit into the hard-switching two-switch flyback converter, a new soft-switching two-switch flyback converter, namely, zero-current transition (ZCT) two-switch flyback converter is proposed. The principle of circuit operation, steady-state analysis, equivalent circuits, converter steady-state waveforms, and design procedure of the proposed ZCT two-switch flyback converter is presented. The key features of the proposed soft-switching converter are 1) the voltage stresses of the main switches are reduced to DC input voltage VI, and 2) all the semiconductor devices are turned off under zero-current (ZC) switching condition. Clamping of the switch overvoltages and reduction in switching loss are achieved in the proposed ZCT two-switch flyback converter. Saber Sketch simulation and experimental results of the hard-switching and the proposed ZCT soft-switching two-switch flyback converters are presented to validate the theoretical analyses. High frequency (HF) transformers used in PWM converters, such as flyback transformers conduct periodic nonsinusoidal currents, which give rise to additional winding losses due to harmonics. In the second part of this research, a theory is developed to find the harmonic winding loss in an HF transformer conducting periodic nonsinusoidal current. Dowell 2 ̆ 7 s equation is used to determine the winding resistances due to eddy currents as a function of frequency. Both skin and proximity effects are taken into account. Fourier series of the primary and secondary current waveforms in a two-winding flyback transformer and the primary and secondary winding resistances are used to determine the primary and secondary winding power losses at various harmonics for both CCM and DCM cases, respectively. The harmonic winding loss factors FRph and FRsh are introduced. The theory is illustrated by the case study of flyback converter for both CCM and DCM operations. Using the equations developed to find the winding losses due to harmonic [...] ...|$|R
