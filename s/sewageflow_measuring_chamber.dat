40|$|The device {{according}} to the invention comprises a <b>measuring</b> <b>chamber</b> in which a holder is arranged to affix the fabric under test. This holder is designed {{in such a way}} that the holder and the fabric fixed in it divides the <b>measuring</b> <b>chamber</b> into two areas only connected from the flow aspect via the fabric - the gas inlet area and the measuring area. Each area of the <b>measuring</b> <b>chamber</b> is provided with at least one pressure sensor whose output signal is supplied to an evaluator. An inlet device permits the inflow of gas or air into the one area of the <b>measuring</b> <b>chamber,</b> thus resulting in a pressure pulse. The evaluator evaluates the output signals from the pressure sensor resulting from the pulsed inlet of the gas in order to determine the dynamic gas permeability. As a result of this arrangement {{according to}} the invention, the dynamic gas permeability of fabrics and in particular of textile fabrics can be measured realistically and affirmatively...|$|R

40|$|Results of multidimensional {{computations}} of sprays in a {{very high}} pressure constant volume chamber are presented in two parts. Comparisons of computed and measured penetrations of non-vaporizing and vaporizing sprays are presented. A broad range of density ratios (0. 005 to 0. 243) is covered.

40|$|AbstractBreathing {{hyperbaric}} air or gas mixtures, {{for example}} during diving or when working underwater {{is known to}} alter the electrophysiological behavior of neuronal cells, which may lead to restricted cognition. During the last few decades, only very few studies into hyperbaric effects have been published, especially for the most relevant pressure range of up to 10 bar. We designed a pressurized <b>measuring</b> <b>chamber</b> to record pressure effects on the electrical activity of neuronal networks formed by primary cells of the frontal cortex of NMRI mice. Electrical activity was recorded with multi-electrode arrays (MEAs) of glass neuro chips while subjected to a step-by-step pressure increase from atmospheric pressure (1 bar) to 2 and 4 bar, followed by a decompression to 1 bar, in order to record recovery effects. The effects {{of pressure on the}} total spike rates (TSRs), which were averaged from at least 45 chips, were detected in two cell culture media with different compositions. In a DMEM medium with 6 % horse serum, the TSR was increased by 19 % after a pressure increase to 2 bar and remained stable at 4 bar. In NMEM medium with 2 % B 27, the TSR was not altered by a pressure increase to 2 bar but increased by 9 % at 4 bar. After decompression to 1 bar, the activities decreased to 76 % and 101 % of their respective control levels in the two media.
