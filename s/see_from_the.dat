5|$|In {{regard to}} the city, the emancipated slave was far from equal to a citizen by birth. He was liable to all types of obligations, as one can <b>see</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{proposals}} of Plato in The Laws: presentation three times monthly {{at the home of}} the former master, forbidden to become richer than him, etc. In fact, the status of emancipated slaves was similar to that of metics, the residing foreigners, who were free but did not enjoy a citizen's rights.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the game, {{the player}} {{directly}} controls the on-screen character from a third-person perspective {{to interact with}} people, objects, and enemies. Unlike previous games in the series, the player can also control the camera with the right analog stick, allowing for a 360° view of the surroundings. While in towns and cities, the player may only <b>see</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> perspective of Vaan, but any character may be controlled in the field. The world of Final Fantasy XII is rendered to scale relative to the characters in it; instead of a caricature of the character roaming around miniature terrain, as found in the earlier Final Fantasy games, every area is represented proportionally. The player navigates the overworld on foot, Chocobo, or by airship. Players may save their game to a memory card using save crystals or gate crystals, and may use the latter to teleport between gate crystals. An in-game bestiary provides incidental information about the world of Final Fantasy XII.|$|E

25|$|A {{study on}} the little green {{bee-eater}} suggests that these birds {{may be able to}} <b>see</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{point of view of a}} predator. The brown-necked raven has been observed hunting lizards in complex cooperation with other ravens, demonstrating an apparent understanding of prey behavior. The California scrub jay hides caches of food and will later re-hide food if it was watched by another bird the first time, but only if the bird hiding the food has itself stolen food before from a cache. Such an ability to <b>see</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> point of view of another individual had previously been attributed only to the great apes and sometimes elephants.

25|$|Proof. Consider a graph on t {{vertices}} and colour {{its edges}} with c colours. Now 'go colour-blind' and pretend that c−1 and c {{are the same}} colour. Thus the graph is now (c−1)-coloured. By the inductive hypothesis, it contains either a Kni mono-chromatically coloured with colour i for some 1 ≤ i ≤ c−2 or a K'R(n'c − 1, n'c)-coloured in the 'blurred colour'. In the former case we are finished. In the latter case, we recover our sight again and <b>see</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> definition of R(n'c−1, n'c) we must have either a (c−1)-monochrome K'n'c−1 or a c-monochrome K'n'c.

25|$|The first episcopal {{assistant}} of the vicar {{known is}} Angelus de Tineosis, Episcopus Viterbiensis, named 2 October 1321, as {{assistant to the}} Vicar Andreas, Episcopus Terracinensis. His position is not so well outlined in the documents that we can form {{a clear idea of}} his duties. It is significant that Angelus officiated as assistant even when the Vicar Andreas was in the city. On the other hand, the Vicar Franciscus Scaccani, Episcopus Nolanus, was allowed to choose an assistant for the business of the vicariate only in the case of his own absence from Rome. According to this document it was not for the pope but the vicar himself, though authorized thereto by the pope, who chose his own assistant and gave over to him all his authority or faculties, insofar as they were based on law or custom. This shows that the vicarius urbis was firmly established in the fulness of his office and externally recognized as such; certain consuetudinary rights had even at this date grown up and become accepted. We <b>see</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Bullarium Magnum (II, 75) that on 18 October 1412, Pope John XXII nominated Petrus Saccus, a canon of St. Peter's, as locum tenens of the Vicar Franciscus, abbas monasterii S. Martini in Monte Cimino O.S.B., and himself conferred on this official all the faculties of the vicar. The new locum tenens was bidden to take the usual oath before the Apostolic Camera (see above). A similar case is that (1430) of Lucas de Ilpernis, another canon of St. Peter's. When Petrus Accolti, Bishop-elect of Ancona, was named vicarius urbis in 1505, he took over the jurisdiction, but the pontificalia or ceremonial rights were given to Franciscus Berthleay, Bishop of Mylopotamos, until the consecration of Accolti. A similar case is that of Andreas Jacobazzi, a canon of St. Peter's, named vicar in 1519, but not consecrated as Bishop of Lucera until 1520; the pontificalia were committed to Vincentius, Bishop of Ottochaz-Zengg.|$|E

500|$|Cott, like Thayer, {{argued that}} countershading would make animals hard to <b>see</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> side, {{as they would}} [...] "fade into a ghostly elusiveness". Rowland notes that Cott is here {{reviewing}} Thayer's theory and [...] "reinforcing the view that a gradation in shading would act to eliminate the effects of ventral shadowing." [...] Kiltie measured {{the effect of the}} countershading of the grey squirrel, Sciurus carolinensis, showing that when the squirrel is horizontal the self-shadowing of the belly is partly concealed, but that when the squirrel is vertical (as when climbing a tree trunk) this effect did not occur.|$|E
500|$|Bartholdi made {{alterations}} {{in the design}} as the project evolved.

The erected statue does rise over a broken chain, half-hidden by her robes and difficult to <b>see</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ground. Bartholdi was initially uncertain of what to place in Liberty's left hand; he settled on a tabula ansata, used to evoke the concept of law. Though Bartholdi greatly admired the United States Constitution, he chose to inscribe [...] "JULY IV MDCCLXXVI" [...] on the tablet, thus associating the date of the country's Declaration of Independence with the concept of liberty.|$|E
500|$|Cookery writer Laura Kelley {{notes that}} the 1774 edition {{was one of the}} first books in English to include a recipe for curry: [...] "To make a currey the Indian way."

Kelley comments that [...] "The dish is very good, but not quite a modern curry. As you can <b>see</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> title of my interpreted recipe, the modern dish most like it is an eastern (Kolkata) butter chicken. However, the Hannah Glasse curry recipe lacks a full complement of spices and the varying amounts of tomato sauce now so often used in the dish." ...|$|E

500|$|English author Giles Foden in The Guardian called Last Night in Twisted River [...] "a very playful novel": it {{toyed with}} {{character}} and the [...] "fluidity of identity", suggesting that someone may [...] "perform [...] identity rather than be defined by it". Foden said that the whole novel {{could be seen as}} a performance of Irving's own literary identity. More of Irving's [...] "playfulness" [...] manifests itself {{at the end of the}} book when the first sentence of Danny's new book is the same as the first sentence of Last Night in Twisted River—Danny is writing the very book we have been reading.

500|$|Tom Epperson, who {{had struck}} up a {{friendship}} with Spacey while writing an early screenplay draft of The Shipping News, was hired to write a new draft for Beyond the Sea. Epperson's script included Darin's penchant for orgies after his divorce with Sandra Dee. Spacey, finding the Epperson script to be overtly dark and morbid, began to rewrite Beyond the Sea, incorporating info from the 1987 Lewis Colick script. Spacey acknowledged he portrayed Darin in an exaggeratedly sympathetic way, and decided not to centrally depict {{the darker side of}} Darin's life. [...] "The other scripts made Bobby [...] a rather unlikable figure," [...] he explained. [...] "I was not interested in making a conventional biopic, as you can <b>see</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> results.

500|$|A {{number of}} other {{successful}} [...] "drive up" [...] businesses have their roots in the 1950s, including McDonald's (expanded c. 1955), which had no dine-in facilities, requiring customers to park and {{walk up to the}} window, taking their order [...] "to go". Automation and the lack of dining facilities allowed McDonald's to sell burgers for 15 cents each, instead of the typical 35 cents, and people were buying them by the bagful. By 1948, they had fired their carhops, installed larger grills, reduced their menu and radically changed the industry by introducing assembly-line methods of food production, similar to the auto industry, dubbing it the [...] "Speedee Service System". They redesigned their sign specifically {{to make it easier to}} <b>see</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> road, creating the now familiar yellow double-arch structure. Businessman Ray Kroc joined McDonald's as a franchise agent in 1955. He subsequently purchased the chain from the McDonald brothers and oversaw its worldwide growth.|$|E

500|$|Jason Newman of Rap-Up {{began his}} review, [...] "For a singer long {{accustomed}} to stadiums, Sunday's show {{was the most}} intimate performance most fans would <b>see</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ubiquitous superstar." [...] He highlighted how she [...] "split the difference between hushed torch singer and stadium belter", and favored her ability to display both [...] "stamina and vigor, which make for a stadium-perfect show".

It was an odd, yet effective juxtaposition; a global superstar who could effortlessly shuffle between slick, bombastic R and awkwardly honest confessions of a tumultuous career. By {{the end of the}} set though, humility, as one expects from a singer with 16 Grammy awards and more than 75 million records sold worldwide, turned to sly confidence."

500|$|In {{the days}} before the battle, Hoang {{anticipated}} a major attack from the South Vietnamese government, as Viet Cong intelligence agents in Dinh Tuong had reported the arrival of 71 truckloads of ammunition and other supplies from Saigon, about [...] to the northeast. In addition, with information provided by Pham Xuan An, a well-connected journalist and undercover Viet Cong agent in Saigon, Hoang's soldiers conducted last-minute anti-helicopter and anti-M113 training by studying US weaponry and South Vietnamese plans and manuals. The Viet Cong also took full advantage of the local terrain by taking up positions in Ap Tan Thoi in the north, along a tree-lined creek in the southeast, and Ap Bac in the south. Their positions were well-concealed by trees and shrubs, which made them difficult to <b>see</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> air and provided good protection from heavy weaponry. To the south and west of Ap Bac, the Viet Cong dug a series of foxholes in front of an irrigation dike, which afforded them an unobstructed field of fire in the surrounding rice fields. The foxholes were deep enough for one man to stand up, or big enough to accommodate a two-man machine gun crew. Behind the foxhole line, the irrigation dike enabled Viet Cong units to communicate with each other. In short, the Viet Cong enjoyed a great advantage over any attacking force.|$|E
