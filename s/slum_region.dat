5000|$|In Batman Begins, Arkham plays a {{much larger}} role than the {{previous}} films, with Jonathan Crane (also known as the Scarecrow) being either the administrator or a high-ranking doctor at the Asylum, and using it to conduct sadistic experiments with his fear gas, with his own patients as guinea pigs. He also uses the pipes under the asylum to empty his toxin into the Gotham water supply. Though still on an island separate from Gotham Citys mainland, it {{is surrounded by a}} <b>slum</b> <b>region</b> known as the Narrows, instead of the dense forestry of the comics. When it came to a diversion for the fear gas to infect Gothams water supply, Ras al Ghul had his men discharge all the patients at Arkham Asylum to keep the police busy. By the end of the film, it is implied that the Narrows has been rendered uninhabitable. Notably, Victor Zsasz is shown as a high-profile criminal being held in the asylum. The National Institute for Medical Research, Mill Hill, London was used as Arkham in the film.|$|E
40|$|Despite {{successful}} implementation of directly observed treatment, short course (DOTS) in India, {{the growing number of}} diabetes mellitus (DM) patients appears to be a cause in the increasing tuberculosis (TB) incidence, affecting their management. In this regard, a prospective study was conducted on DOTS patients in three primary health care centers in urban <b>slum</b> <b>region</b> of South Delhi, India, to evaluate the effect of DM on sputum conversion, treatment outcome, and adverse drug reactions (ADR) due to anti-TB treatment. Eligible TB patients underwent blood glucose screening at treatment initiation. Disease presentation, clinical outcome, and ADRs were compared between patients of TB with and without DM. Out of 316 patients, the prevalence of DM was found to be 15. 8 %, in which 19. 4 % and 9. 6 % were PTB and EPTB patients, respectively. DM patients have observed higher sputum positivity (OR 1. 247 95 % CI; 0. 539 – 2. 886) at the end of 2 -month treatment and poor outcome (OR 1. 176 95 % CI; 0. 310 – 4. 457) at the completion of treatment compared with non DM patients. Presence of DM was significantly associated (OR 3. 578 95 % CI; 1. 114 – 11. 494, p= 0. 032) with the development of ADRs. DM influences the treatment outcome of PTB patients in our setting and also on the ADR incidence...|$|E

Among the 2, 029 students in 6 primary schools, 316 (15. 6 %) were positive to Enterobius vermicularis eggs and 32 (1. 6 %) were positive to Taenia spp. eggs by the cellophane tape method. The egg positive rates of E. vermicularis and Taenia spp. ranged from 9. 4 % to 27. 2 % and from 0. 8 % to 2. 6 % respectively among six schools. The egg positive rate of E. vermicularis was found to be significantly different among these schools (χ 2 = 31. 96, P 0. 05). The rate (18. 7 %) of E. vermicularis in the urban <b>slum</b> <b>regions</b> was higher than the rate (11. 5 %) in the urban central regions (χ 2 = 19. 20; P < 0. 05).

40|$|Nowadays {{the process}} of rapid change {{that takes place in}} many areas also takes place in the {{paradigms}} of development. Using specific values and accumulations of their regions in development countries aims to transform it into an economic and social development benefit. Because of these aims in many countries the level of development between regions is among the {{one of the most important}} problems. In this concept, Social Support Program (SODES), implemented for the social development since 2008 by Development Ministry, provided a number of opportunities for those who have difficulties in particapating to the social life. The program, by increasing their self-confidence functions as a tool that provides a better and healthier social life. It also provides social restoration in the country starting from the cities where the program implemented. Segments of the population covered by the program consists of children, youths, women, unemployed people, poor people, immigrants and individuals and groups living in <b>slum</b> <b>regions</b> of the cities. SODES program consist of three components like “employmeny component”, social inclusin component ” and “culture, art and sports component ” Aims of the projects that take place in the sports componet are increasing sports activities, identifying abilities of children and youths through these activities, and help them to have beneficial habits for the society and themselves. In this study, the cost and the number of projects since 2008 are evaluated according to components, cities and type of institutions.

40|$|An {{informal}} sector in any economy provides {{different kinds of}} employment opportunities to people. In Mumbai Metropolitan Region, the female are more involved in regular jobs as compare to the causal and self-employed workers. The secondary and college studied male and female are found more in regular jobs. The high school studied male and illiterate female are working on causal jobs. The causal jobs do not require more education and skills. In self-employed category, the secondary school studied male and high school studied female are found more. The monthly income of workers involved in regular jobs {{is much higher than}} the causal and self-employed workers. The moderate malnourished females are found more as compare to the male in causal and self-employed category. The multi nominal logit regression model shows that the causal workers have positive correlation with illiterate male but it is negatively co-related with high school studied male, illiterate and secondary studied female. The monthly income, source of water, refrigerator and condom use is negatively co-related with causal workers as compare to regular workers. The self-employed workers have negative co-relation with monthly wage, source of water and watch cinema regularly as compare to the regular workers. Therefore government must provide infrastructural facilities in all <b>slums</b> of <b>region.</b> The infrastructural facilities such as water supply, electricity, sewage and solid waste collection must be provided in all <b>slums</b> of <b>region.</b> Causal workers must be provided the vocational training to start their own business. Commercial and co-operative banks must provide loans to poor people of slums. Females must be encouraged to take loan and start small business. Government must provide low cost housing to causal and self-employed workers in region. Such policies will certainly improve standard of living of {{informal sector}} workers in region...|$|R

In this Comet is aided, largely unwittingly, by a recently revived The Weird, who disrupts the Church from within. During this battle, the Eternal Light Corporation kill all the residents of the business section of Hardcore Station - the real estate in the 'depopulated area' becoming the property of the Corporation.|$|R
5000|$|A small {{official}} launch {{event was}} held on 8 August 2014 and the team began a schedule shoot in Chennai thereafter. Scenes were shot in the tsunami-hit <b>region</b> <b>slums</b> of Srinivasapuram for the initial days of shoot. By October 2014, {{it was reported that}} the film was sixty percent complete, with most scenes being shot in the areas surrounding Chennai. The team then shot for a schedule in Dharamsala, before returning to Ooty to finish filming portions. Madhavan suffered a minor injury on the sets during the last week, but continued through the pain to finish the film. Filming portions for the venture were completed in mid-November 2014 after forty two days of shoot. [...] Post-production works took place throughout 2015 and several potential release dates were evaded. Rajkumar Hirani's late inclusion in the project meant that he requested the team to re-shoot certain portions, with Madhavan regrowing a long beard after having removed it in December 2014. The team subsequently shot for ten further days in late 2015, while completing patchwork. Throughout the production of the film and dubbing purposes, Madhavan wore metal braces inside his teeth, in order to create the effect of having a lisp that most boxers have from sporting injuries.|$|R
40|$|Although {{there is}} no {{consensus}} on the definition of the peri-urban areas, there is growing recognition among development professionals that rural and urban features tend to increasingly co-exist within cities and beyond their limits. This research discusses the peri-urban area through reviewing previous literature. In addition, to define the criteria of delimitation of peri-urban areas in light of those literatures, therefore, delimitation of peri-urban areas of Greater Cairo. Peri-urban areas of the Greater Cairo Region (GCR) represent 24 % of the region’s population. However, {{there is no}} urban planning or land management carried out by the government in those areas. Furthermore, these areas are expected {{to be a part of}} a metropolitan area of Greater Cairo within a few years, because of urban sprawl of the metropolis and urbanization dynamics in these areas Therefore, peri-urban areas can either make a great contribution to the urban development of the GCR or become a new belt of <b>slums</b> surrounding the <b>region,</b> according to the procedures of dealing with it. Moreover, this paper aims to examine the key factors of the urbanization process in peri-urban areas of the GCR through correlation analysis between those factors and the urbanization indicators in those areas. In addition, to discuss the appropriate procedures for managing land uses in those areas. The findings of this research confirmed that the percentage of non-agriculture workers, percentage of illiterate, and the existing regional services are the most important factors in the process of the urbanization process in peri-urban areas of the GCR...|$|R
40|$|Foram analisadas, quanto à exposição a fatores de risco para o baixo peso ao nascer, 77 gestantes no último trimestre da gestação, residentes em favelas da região de Vila Mariana, município de São Paulo, acompanhadas pelo Projeto Favela, desenvolvido pela Universidade Federal de São Paulo/Escola Paulista de Medicina. As variáveis maternas de maior impacto sobre o peso ao nascer foram paridade e estatura. Primíparas geraram crianças com diferença média de peso ao nascer de - 264 g em relação aos recém-nascidos das multíparas. Mulheres com estaturas abaixo de 150 cm tiveram crianças com diferença média de peso ao nascer de - 287 g em comparação com os neonatos de mães com estaturas maiores. Apenas 2, 6 % das crianças nasceram com baixo peso, apesar da alta exposição da população estudada aos fatores de risco.

The maternal variables which most influenced birth weight were the mother's number of pregnancies and height. Primiparous women gave birth to newborns with lower birthweight, presenting an average difference of - 264 g when compared with infants born to multiparous mothers. Women whose height did not exceed 150 cm also delivered infants with lower birth weight, demonstrating an average difference of - 287 g when compared with neonates born to taller mothers.

5000|$|The United States' [...] "War on Drugs" [...] {{has added}} {{considerably}} {{to the political}} instability in South America. The huge profits to be made from cocaine and other South American-grown drugs are largely because they are illegal in the wealthy neighbouring nation. This drives people in the relatively poor countries of Colombia, Peru, Bolivia and Brazil to break their own laws in organising the cultivation, preparation and trafficking of cocaine to the States. This has allowed criminal, paramilitary and guerrilla groups to reap huge profits, exacerbating already serious law-and-order and political problems. Within Bolivia, the political rise of current president Evo Morales {{is directly related to}} his grassroots movement against US-sponsored coca-eradication and criminalization policies. However, coca has been cultivated for centuries in the Andes. Among their various legitimate uses, coca leaves are chewed for their mild stimulant & appetite suppression effects, and steeped as a tea which is known to reduce the effects of human altitude sickness. Rural farmers in the poor regions in which coca has historically been cultivated often find themselves at the difficult and potentially violent intersection of government-sponsored eradication efforts, illegal cocaine producers & traffickers seeking coca supplies, anti-government paramilitary forces trafficking in cocaine as a source of revolutionary funding, and the historical hardships of rural subsistence farming (or the its typical alternative - abandoning their land and fleeing to an urban <b>slum).</b> In some <b>regions,</b> farmers' coca and other crops are frequently destroyed by U.S.-sponsored eradication treatments (usually sprayed from the air with varying degrees of discrimination), whether or not the farmers directly supply the cocaine trade, thereby destroying their livelihoods. Agricultural producers in these countries are pushed further to grow coca for the cocaine trade by the dumping of subsidised farming products (fruit, vegetables, grain etc.) produced by Western countries (predominantly US and EU agricultural surpluses) (see BBC reference, below), which reduces the prices they could otherwise receive for alternate crops such as maize. The net effect can be a depression of prices for all crops, which can both make the farmer's livelihood more precarious, and make the cocaine producers' coca supplies cheaper.|$|R

40|$|O objetivo desta disserta????o foi entender a representa????o social de fam??lia dos conselheiros tutelares da cidade de Niter??i, no estado do Rio de Janeiro. Esta representa????o social foi correlacionada ao atendimento di??rio, realizado pelos conselheiros tutelares, de casos de viol??ncia intrafamiliar contra crian??as e adolescentes no munic??pio aludido. A pesquisa, de car??ter qualitativo-descritivo, abordou a representa????o social de fam??lia dos conselheiros tutelares por meio de id??ias associadas a n??cleos de sentido, os quais foram analisados, atrav??s da metodologia da an??lise de conte??do tem??tica, a partir das seguintes categorias de an??lise: 1) A religi??o dos conselheiros tutelares; 2) Fam??lia moderna e p??s-moderna; e 3) Dispositivos sociais da viol??ncia e do abuso. Os dados foram coletados atrav??s de entrevistas semi-estruturadas {{realizadas}} com 12 conselheiros tutelares. Foram selecionados membros dos Conselhos Tutelares I e II com mandato vigorado entre 2003 e 2007. Tamb??m foram selecionados membros do Conselho Tutelar III com mandato iniciado em 2005 e com t??rmino em 2008. A an??lise da religi??o dos conselheiros permitiu o entendimento desta ??ltima como uma estrutura valorativa, promotora de algum n??vel de estabilidade emocional, isto frente ?? complexidade e intensidade que envolve seu trabalho. Representa, para eles, um pilar, que lhes permite a constru????o de condi????es necess??rias para o adequado atendimento das fam??lias, assim como para a administra????o de sua vida pessoal. J?? os n??cleos de sentido abordados pela categoria de an??lise definida como fam??lia moderna e p??s-moderna, mostraram o ideal da fam??lia nuclear possu??do pelos conselheiros tutelares. Eles exibiram muitas dificuldades para reconhecer outras configura????es e din??micas familiares destoantes do modelo nuclear de fam??lia. Atrav??s desta vis??o por demais tradicional, avaliavam e julgavam as fam??lias por eles atendidas em seu trabalho. Sempre pelo vi??s do fracasso e da fal??ncia, os casos por eles recebidos nos Conselhos Tutelares eram justificados. Isto ocorreu pelo perfil da maioria das fam??lias, moradoras de favelas ou de regi??es pouco favorecidas de estrutura urbana do munic??pio de Niter??i. Finalmente, a an??lise dos dispositivos sociais da viol??ncia e do abuso mostrou que os conselheiros tutelares enfrentavam enormes dificuldades para realizarem, adequadamente, sua fun????o. As condi????es de trabalho relatadas por eles n??o s??o muito diferentes daquelas encontradas em outros Conselhos Tutelares brasileiros. Sinalizaram a falta de recursos materiais e humanos e a exist??ncia de uma rede municipal de sa??de e de assist??ncia deficit??ria. Esta realidade estava gerando, para eles, uma sobrecarga de trabalho. Desta forma, a pesquisa sugere que crian??as e adolescentes estariam, neste cen??rio, sendo afastadas das garantias contidas nos direitos estabelecidos pelo Estatuto da Crian??a e do Adolescente. Extensivamente, as fam??lias permaneceriam desprotegidas, sobretudo, pela postura preconceituosa com a qual s??o encaradas pelos conselheiros tutelares. The {{purpose of}} this dissertation was the insight into the social representation of family of Tutelary Council members, in Niter??i city, state of Rio de Janeiro. Such social representation was correlated with daily childcare, {{carried out by the}} counselors, on cases of intrafamilial violence against children and teenagers in the mentioned city. The research, of qualitative-and-descriptive nature, broached the social representation of family {{from the perspective of the}} counselors by means of ideas related to cores of sense, which were analyzed by the methodology of the thematic content analysis from the following groups of analysis: 1) The religion of the counselors; 2) Modern and postmodern family; and 3) Social gadgets of the violence and abuse. Data were collected in semi-structured interviews carried out with 12 counselors. The selected interviewed worked as members of the Tutelary Council I and II between the years 2003 and 2007, as well as the members of the Tutelary Council III who started in 2005 finishing in 2008. The analisys of the religion of each counselor provided the understanding of it as a substantial struture, suplying some level of emotional strength, even in face of the complexity and intensity that envolve their work. That represents a buttress to the counselors that allows them the construction of necessary conditions to the proper assintance to the families, as well as the managing of their own lives. On the other hand, the cores of sense broached in the group of analysis defined as modern and postmodern family, indicated the same ideal of the core family as that of the counselors. They presented many difficulties to recognize another structures and familiar routines different from the core model of family. By their traditional point of view, the counselors evaluated and umpire the families assisted by them in their work. The cases received by the counselors were always justified by the perspective of debacle and failure. The counselors??? conclusions were taken by the profile of families, most of them lived in <b>slums</b> or in <b>regions</b> with poor urban stucture in the city of Niter??i. Finally, the analysis of the social gadgets of the violence and abuse indicated that such counselors faced huge problems when they carried out, properly, their work. According to the counselors, their conditions of work are not so different as those found in other brazilian Tutelary Councils. They indicated the lack of material and human resources and the deficient existence of a public healthcare center and assintence. Such reality was creating an overload of work to the counselors. So, the research propose that children and teenagers would be, in this context, bowing out of the warranties enclosed in the rights established by the Statute for Children and Adolescents. By extension, the families would keep on being unprotected, mainly due to the biased attitude adopted by most of the counselors...|$|R
