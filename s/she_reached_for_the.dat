She did not reveal her idea to family and registered on her own. However, when <b>she</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> final round, she was eliminated by the contest jury when it figured out that she was too young to qualify for the competition. Thu Minh cried her eyes out. Yet, thanks to her father's later encouragement, she continued to practice and returned to the competition {{at the age of}} 16. This time, Thu Minh was still {{the youngest}} contestant and she won a gold medal as the first prize. This first debut impressed audiences and musical experts with a natural high and strong Soprano C voice by performing 2 classic Vietnamese hit songs [...] "Bóng cây Kơ-nia" [...] ("The Shadow of the Kapok Tree") and [...] "Tình ca cho em" [...] ("Love song for you") for the highest scores {{despite the fact that she}} had never been educated for professional music and was pursuing a professional career as a ballet dancer. Almost 20 years later, [...] "Tình ca cho em" [...] is revealed to be a song that its author, musician Nguyen Nam, wrote for Thu Minh as a gift before she attended the contest when she sang this song again and expressed her feelings about the former musician in his funeral and on an aired ceremony.|$|E

60|$|The {{speaker was}} Riggs, {{and he had}} possessed himself of part of her baggage with action and speech meant more to impress the curious crowd than to be really kind.
