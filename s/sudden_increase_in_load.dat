30|$|Whenever {{there is}} load/generation imbalance, {{synchronous}} generators {{in a system}} respond in three stages to bring the system back to normal operation. The initial stage {{is characterized by the}} release or absorption of kinetic energy of the rotating mass—this is a physical and inherent characteristic of synchronous generators. For example, if there is a <b>sudden</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>load</b> or in renewable generation due to intermittency, the electrical torque increases to supply load increase, while the mechanical torque of the turbine initially remains constant. Hence, the acceleration becomes negative. The turbine-generator decelerates, and the rotor speed drops as kinetic energy is released to supply the load change. This response is called “inertial response.” As the frequency deviation exceeds certain limit, the turbine-governor control will be activated to change the power input to the prime mover. The rotor acceleration eventually becomes zero, and the frequency reaches a new steady state. This is called “primary frequency control.” After primary frequency support, there still exists steady-state frequency error. To remove the error, the governor set points are changed, and the frequency is brought back to nominal value, which is called “secondary frequency control.” These three phenomena take place in succession in any system to restore the normal operating equilibrium.|$|E

40|$|The {{incorporation}} of on-site wastewater treatment systems is one means {{to meet the}} infrastructure needs of the rapidly expanding urban population. With space at a premium, the existing technologies for on-site systems should be reexamined and adapted to fit {{the needs of the}} urban setting. This study examined the potential to combine the existing wastewater treatment technology of the intermittent media filter with the new architectural trend of green walls, creating a treatment system with minimal spatial footprint and with a built-in urban greening component. A novel vegetated intermittent media filter wall was constructed in Ås, Norway and dosed with domestic greywater for a period of three months. Overall treatment performance and removal trends over the 175 cm filter depth were monitored. Three separate wall sections were constructed to monitor the treatments effects of containing wall material choice and presence of vegetation. Despite a daily dosing rate of nearly 1000 l/m 2 the system achieved average reduction rates of over 95 %, 80 %, 90 %, 30 %, and 69 % for BOD 5, COD, TSS, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus, respectively, as well as approximately two log unit reduction of bacteria indicator E. coli. Examination over the depth of the system showed that most organic (COD) and solids removal takes place in the upper 15 cm, but with a <b>sudden</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>loading</b> a greater removal was seen at lower depths. With regard to nitrification, increased nitrate levels did not appear before 100 cm filter depth, likely suppressed by high organic loading at the surface. The findings suggest that the great filter height associated with the wall design was useful for buffering <b>sudden</b> <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> hydraulic <b>loading,</b> as well as for facilitating nitrification under extreme loading conditions. Wall material with a more permeable construction (geotextile grid) preformed slightly better in the treatment of organics than non-permeable wall material (plastic liner), but confounding variables reduce the confidence in this finding. The vegetated wall section showed the greatest removal rates in almost every parameter measured, especially removal of E. coli. A difference in hydraulic retention times as shown by (NaCl) tracer tests is the likely cause of this phenomenon, rather than the vegetation itself. The significant reduction of constituents of concern using only a small spatial footprint make this system a worthy candidate for further research and development regarding urban wastewater treatment applications...|$|R

The latter is intended to carry the weight of the pipe work and allow it to move freely under normal operating conditions.The {{restraint system}} is intended to protect the pipe work, the plant and the structure from abnormal conditions; it should not impede the function of the supports.Conditions that necessitate the use of restraints are as follows -• Earthquake.• Fluid disturbance.• Certain system functions.• Environmental influences.In areas that are situated on or near to geological fault lines it is common practice to protect the plant from potential earthquake activity. In such plant there will be a very large requirement for dynamic restraints. Fluid disturbance can be caused by the effect of pumps and compressors or occasionally fluid in a liquid state entering a pipe intended for the transportation of gas or steam. Some system functions such as rapid valve closure, pulsation due to pumping and the operation of safety relief valves will cause irregular and sudden loading patterns within the piping system. The environment can cause disturbance due to high wind <b>load</b> or <b>in</b> the case of offshore oil and gas rigs, impact by ocean waves.The restraint system will be designed to cater for all of these influences. A restraint is a device that prevents either the pipe work or the plant to which the pipe work is connected being damaged due to the occurrence of any {{one or more of the}} abovephenomenon. It is designed to absorb and transfer <b>sudden</b> <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>load</b> from the pipe into the building structure and to deaden any opposing oscillation between the pipe and the structure.

Traditionally, recloser placement studies have not considered the effect of greater numbers of reclosers on network damage during faults or the effect of positioning on protection settings. Recloser positions that enhance {{the reliability of the}} system may not necessarily improve other problematic operational aspects, such as the damage to equipment and the risk of incorrect tripping due to the <b>sudden</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>loading.</b> This research seeks to prove the hypothesis that: Recloser placement studies with the additional consideration of protection-related factors such as equipment damage and the risk of false tripping will result in different recloser positions compared to when the priority is only on improving reliability indices and cost. A tool is developed to assess the reliability indices, cost, damage and the risk of false tripping and it determines the best recloser positioning based on the priority given to each factor considered. Using this tool, observations are made on the effect of the added factors of damage and the risk of false tripping on recloser positioning. The addition of the protection-related factors to the objective function is unique in its ability to realise the value of recloser positions that cater for minimizing the damage factor and the possibility of tripping on <b>load.</b> <b>In</b> the absence of these factors, the value of certain recloser positions would not be identified as they would not improve reliability or cost factors. The importance of reliability and cost are not overruled by the addition of the protection-related factors.

To maintain the system stability, the major problem is identifying the optimal location for fixing FACTS controller and also computing the amount of voltage and angle to be injected in the system.

The main components of a variable displacement vane pumps are: vanes, rotor, inner rings and a sliding ring. During operation, the vanes are in contact with the inner surface of the outer (sliding) ring due to the effect of centrifugal loads; in addition high slip velocities occur in the contact area; as a consequence, a critical aspect of this kind of pumps is represented by the wear which takes place on the contact surfaces.

In the present study, children from 2 years old upward-and adults grasped and lifted an object using a precision grip. <b>Sudden,</b> unpredicted <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>load</b> force (tangential to the grip surfaces) were induced by the experimenter by dropping a small disc on to a re-ceptacle attached to the object. The impact elicited a grip force response which in young children had a longer la-tency and a smaller amplitude than was seen in adults. The grip response latency gradually become shorter and its amplitude increased with increasing age, reaching adult values at 6 -lO years. The muscle activity underly-ing the response could have several bursts. The adults showed one brisk response, appearing 40 - 50 ms after impact, in extrinsic and intrinsic hand muscles, while younger children also exhibited a short-latency burst, ap-pearing about 20 ms after impact. It is suggested that the short-latency response was mediated via spinal path-ways, and that these pathways are disengaged by supra-spinal centers during development.

V. D. C transmission systems. It is planned to automate the restoration of departed frequency to normal value by arranging the change in firing delay angle i. e. α of the converter of H. V. D. C. link till the increased load demand is met with. An adaptive control system has been devised which controls the firing delay angle {{on the basis of}} decisions given by a fuzzy controller. Also the fuzzy controls are decided by the departure in frequency from normal. The results {{have been found to be}} encouraging...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes to}} model and {{simulate}} a unified power flow controller (UPFC) in power system {{computer aided design}} and electromagnetic transient direct current (PSCAD/EMTDC) environment. The series converter of the UPFC controls the transmission line real/reactive power flow and the shunt converter of the UPFC controls the UPFC bus voltage/shunt reactive power and the DC link capacitor voltage. The real power demand of the series converter is supplied by the shunt converter of the UPFC via the DC link capacitor. The control of transmission line reactive power flow leads to excessive voltage excursion of the UPFC bus voltage. In this proposed work, we have considered two system cases. The first case is to cause a <b>sudden</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> the system <b>load.</b> The second case is to introduce a transient fault in the system. In both cases, excessive bus voltage excursions occur. A UPFC is modeled and designed to reduce these bus voltage excursions, and also proper coordination between the series and shunt converter controllers of the UPFC is maintained to limit the collapse of DC capacitor voltage. PSCAD/EMTDC software is utilized to design and simulate the model.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{entry of}} HIV into its target cells is {{facilitated}} by the prior binding to the cell surface molecule CD 4 and a secondary coreceptor, mostly the chemokine receptors CCR 5 or CXCR 4. In early infection CCR 5 -using viruses (R 5 viruses) are mostly dominant while a receptor switch towards CXCR 4 occurs in about 50 % of the infected individuals (X 4 viruses) which {{is associated with a}} progression of the disease. There are many hypotheses regarding the underlying dynamics without yet a conclusive understanding. Results While it is difficult to isolate key factors in vivo we have developed a minimal in silico model based on the approaches of Nowak and May to investigate the conditions under which the receptor switch occurs. The model allows to investigate the evolution of viral strains within a probabilistic framework along the three stages of disease from primary and latent infection to the onset of AIDS with a a <b>sudden</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> viral <b>load</b> which goes along with the impairment of the immune response. The model is specifically applied to investigate the evolution of the viral quasispecies in terms of R 5 and X 4 viruses which directly translates into the composition of viral load and consequently the question of the coreceptor switch. Conclusion The model can explain the coreceptor switch {{as a result of a}} dynamical change in the underlying environmental conditions in the host. The emergence of X 4 strains does not necessarily result in the dominance of X 4 viruses <b>in</b> viral <b>load</b> which is more likely to occur in the model after some time of chronic infection. A better understanding of the conditions leading to the coreceptor switch is especially of interest as CCR 5 blockers have recently been licensed as drugs which suppress R 5 viruses but do not seem to necessarily induce a coreceptor switch. </p...|$|R
40|$|When the {{operating}} condition of a gas-turbine engine changes from one steady state to another, the cooling {{must ensure that}} the material temperature and its gradient never exceed the maximum allowable throughout the transient process. The objective {{of this study is}} to understand how to cool a material subjected to a <b>sudden</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> heating <b>load</b> by using the minimum cooling flow. The focus is on understanding the unsteady processes associated with the cooling process and the response of the material to sudden changes on its heated and cooled sides. The problem selected to generate the understanding is a flat plate heated on one side by a specified heat flux and cooled on the other side by an array of impinging air jets. The plate is made of either a Ni-based superalloy or a composite-matrix material. The composite matrix consists of a grid made of a material with high thermal conductivity and high thermal diffusivity (denoted as Mat-C) and a material with high heat capacity (denoted as Mat-S), where contact resistance between Mat-C and Mat-S were not considered. For this problem, unsteady conjugate analysis based on RANS with the SST turbulence model for the air and the Fourier Law for the plate was used to study the details of the unsteadiness in the fluid flow and solid and to determine the minimum cooling flow rate. ^ Results are presented to show the details of the steady states and the transients. At steady state when the plate is made of superalloy, though the Biot number is much less than 0. 1, there is considerable temperature variation in the plate because of the large variation in the heat-transfer coefficient on cooled side of the plate. The unsteadiness in the cooling jet involves the reflection and the interaction of finite-amplitude pressure waves, the generation of a starting vortex, and the formation of vortical structures from Helmholtz instability. For the conditions of the present study, the transients in the fluid - though highly complicated - occurs at orders of magnitude faster than the transients in the solid, and the distribution of the heat-transfer coefficient on the cooled side achieved steady state almost instantly when compared to the time scale of conduction in the solid. Though the maximum temperature in the solid at steady state is always just below the maximum allowable for all cases studied, results show that the temperature in a material could exceed the maximum allowable during transients when the heat load is increased despite a corresponding <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> cooling. ^ Studies were also performed to examine what could be done to the plate to reduce cooling flow for a given heat load with and without pre-cooling. If the plate 2 ̆ 7 s material is a composite matrix made of copper (Mat-C) and ceramic (Mat-S) instead of a Ni-based superalloy and subjected to the same heating loads, then the required cooling and period of over temperature were found to reduce greatly. A parametric study on the material properties of Mat-C and Mat-S in the composite matrix was performed to explore the effectiveness of material 2 ̆ 7 s thermophysical properties. ^ To guide designers, a model based on one-dimensional-time-accurate integral solution and volume weighted time constants was developed to estimate the temperature distribution in a flat plate of thickness L that is exposed to a 2 ̆ 2 hot 2 ̆ 2 convective environment on one side and a 2 ̆ 2 cold 2 ̆ 2 convective environment on the other, where the two convective environments can change suddenly. This model provides estimates on the maximum temperature that can occur in a plate during transients when convective environments suddenly change, when that maximum temperature will occur after a sudden change, and how long could the temperature in the material exceed the maximum allowable.
