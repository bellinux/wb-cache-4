40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. To ensure stability of a construction the physical properties of its components have to be well known. In a landfill, waste presents the largest structural element and controls both the stability and integrity of the lining system. In spite of this critical role there is a dearth of knowledge on behaviour of waste as an engineering material. Waste variability and changes in waste stream aggravate the assessment of waste mechanical properties. In a literature review the main influences on shear behaviour of municipal solid waste (MSW) were identified. Design values and recommendation for shear parameter were summarised. To assess mechanical behaviour in a systematic way {{the use of a}} classification system was deemed crucial for a comparison of different findings from literature and a categorisation of waste in regard to its composition. A framework for a classification system was introduced. Main elements of a comprehensive classification system were identified in a literature review and discussed, and data from literature was applied to the classification framework. For the validation of a classification system, municipal solid waste was examined in an in-situ waste sorting analysis and also applied to the framework. The findings from the waste sorting and the classification system were also used to develop a family of <b>synthetic</b> <b>waste</b> to gradually examine the influencing factors on waste mechanical behaviour. For this, the materials, size ranges and shapes of waste components identified in the waste sorting analysis were reduced to a minimum but still representative amount. A range of <b>synthetic</b> <b>waste</b> compositions was engineered and tested in a large-scale shear device. Compression tests were also conducted in a large compression cell.

The constituents of municipal solid waste deposits vary between countries and regions and are constantly altering as a result of changes in lifestyle and legislation. This paper describes an investigation using a family of <b>synthetic</b> <b>wastes</b> to assess the relationship between classification and mechanical behavior of the waste body via a program of one-dimensional compression and direct shear tests. Measured mechanical behavior is compared with results for real wastes to assess the validity of using synthetic samples. Compression and shear behavior of the <b>synthetic</b> <b>wastes</b> were found to be within the range of published values for real waste.

A series of laboratory-scale kinetic leach column (KLC) experiments, using both synthetic and natural mine wastes, were carried out to test the efficacy of our pyrite passivation strategy (developed from previous research) for robust and sustainable AMD management. For the <b>synthetic</b> <b>waste</b> KLC tests, initial treatment with lime-saturated water was found to be of paramount importance for maintaining long-term circum-neutral pH, favourable for the formation and preservation of the pyrite surface passivating layer and reduced acid generation rate. Following the initial lime-saturated water treatment, minimal additional alkalinity (calcite-saturated water) was required to maintain circum-neutral pH for the maintenance of pyrite surface passivation. KLC tests examining natural potentially acid forming (PAF) waste, with much greater peak acidity than that of the <b>synthetic</b> <b>waste,</b> blended with lime (≈ 2 wt %) with and without natural non-acid-forming (NAF) waste covers, were carried out.
