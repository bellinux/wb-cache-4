40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{stability}} and antioxidant effects of carotenoids and tocopherols in <b>safflower</b> <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> were evaluated under thermal (75 °C) and oxidative {{conditions and the}} oxidative sta-bility index (OSI) determined. The antioxidant capability of butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) was also {{compared with that of}} β-carotene in a model system. Lycopene and β-carotene (1 to 2000 ppm) were heated (75 °C) and exposed to air (2. 5 psi) in an oxidative stability instrument. β-Carotene had no antioxidant effect at concentrations below 500 ppm, because it did not alter the induction time. Lycopene increased the induction time only slightly at low concentrations. However, at concentrations greater than 500 ppm, both β-carotene and lycopene acted as prooxidants, significantly decreasing the induction period. At the highest concentration, 2000 ppm, lycopene was more prooxidative than β-carotene. α- and γ-Tocopherol (concentra-tion, 1000 ppm) delayed the induction time by 16 and 26 h, re-spectively. There was no cooperative interaction between α-to-copherol and β-carotene in delaying the onset of oxidation. Fur-thermore, BHT was significantly more antioxidative than β-carotene. Thus, under thermal and oxidative conditions, β-carotene could not delay the onset of oxidation.

Giza 1) an experiment was conducted as split plot design in randomized complete block design arrangement with three replications, during the successive seasons 2010 / 11 and 2011 / 12. The factors consisted of four levels of nitrogen (0, 40, 80 and 120 kg N ha- 1) and four different densities (80, 000, 100, 000, 133, 000 and 200, 000 plants ha- 1). Different statistical analyses such as ANOVA, polynomial regression, correlation, and stepwise multiple linear regression were used. The multiple statistical procedures showed that the main effects of nitrogen rate and plant density levels were significant (P = 0. 01) for yield and yield components studied. A rise in nitrogen rate and plant density increased seed and oil yield, whereas plant height, number of branches plant- 1, number of heads plant- 1, seed yield plant- 1 and 1000 -seed weight decreased as plant density increased. In general, the highest plant density (200, 000 plants ha- 1) and the nitrogen level (80 kg ha- 1) was the best treatment in this research to attain high safflower seed yield under environmental conditions of Giza Governorate, Egypt. Polynomial models of seed, oil yield and yield components based on the ANOVA were fitted.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{application}} and nutritional value of vegetable oil is {{highly dependent on}} its fatty acid composition, especially the relative proportion of its two major fatty acids, i. e oleic acid and linoleic acid. Microsomal oleoyl phosphatidylcholine desaturase encoded by FAD 2 gene is known to introduce a double bond at the Δ 12 position of an oleic acid on phosphatidylcholine and convert it to linoleic acid. The known plant FAD 2 enzymes are encoded by small gene families consisting of 1 - 4 members. In addition to the classic oleate Δ 12 -desaturation activity, functional variants of FAD 2 {{that are capable of}} undertaking additional or alternative acyl modifications have also been reported in a limited number of plant species. In this study, our objective was to identify FAD 2 genes from safflower and analyse their differential expression profile and potentially diversified functionality. Results We report here the characterization and functional expression of an exceptionally large FAD 2 gene family from safflower, and the temporal and spatial expression profiles of these genes as revealed through Real-Time quantitative PCR. The diversified functionalities of some of the safflower FAD 2 gene family members were demonstrated by ectopic expression in yeast and transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. CtFAD 2 - 1 and CtFAD 2 - 10 were demonstrated to be oleate desaturases specifically expressed in developing seeds and flower head, respectively, while CtFAD 2 - 2 appears to have relatively low oleate desaturation activity throughout the plant. CtFAD 2 - 5 and CtFAD 2 - 8 are specifically expressed in root tissues, while CtFAD 2 - 3, 4, 6, 7 are mostly expressed in the cotyledons and hypocotyls in young safflower seedlings. CtFAD 2 - 9 was found to encode a novel desaturase operating on C 16 : 1 substrate. CtFAD 2 - 11 is a tri-functional enzyme able to introduce a carbon double bond in either cis or trans configuration, or a carbon triple (acetylenic) bond at the Δ 12 position. Conclusions In this study, we isolated an unusually large FAD 2 gene family with 11 members from safflower. The seed expressed FAD 2 oleate Δ 12 desaturase genes identified in this study will provide candidate targets to manipulate the oleic acid level in <b>safflower</b> <b>seed</b> <b>oil.</b> Further, the divergent FAD 2 enzymes with novel functionality could be used to produce rare fatty acids, such as crepenynic acid, in genetically engineered crop plants that are precursors for economically important phytoalexins and oleochemical products. </p...|$|E

40|$|The primary {{objectives}} of the investigations included in this report are to obtain information regarding the relationship existing between oil content of whole <b>safflower</b> <b>seed</b> and spininess of the plant, hull, nitrogen content and seed size; and also possibilities of estimating oil content of whole seed by mechanical and subsequent observation methods. Three hundred seventy-two randomly selected F 2 plants from the cross 804 - 3 - 2 X 583 - 1 - 6 were used in this investigation. In addition, two methods of estimating oil content in the <b>safflower</b> <b>seed</b> were investigated.

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{investigate}} {{the effect of the}} addition of <b>safflower</b> <b>seed</b> (Carthamus tinctor-ius L.) on the physicochemical properties of ground pork as an animal fat replacer. Three types of ground pork were evaluated: 20 % pork fat added (control), 10 % pork fat and 10 % <b>safflower</b> <b>seed</b> pow-der added (10 % SS), and 20 % <b>safflower</b> <b>seed</b> powder added (20 % SS). The moisture, protein, and ash contents were highest in 20 % SS, and the fat content was highest in the control (p< 0. 05). The cooking yield, moisture retention, fat retention, and water-holding capacity were highest in 20 % SS, and the control showed a reduction in the diameter (p< 0. 05). The external and internal L-, a-, and b-values of the control were higher than those of the 10 % SS and the 20 % SS (p< 0. 05). The cholesterol content of the control, the 10 % SS, and the 20 % SS was 50. 85, 21. 77, and 17. 91 mg/ 100 g, respectively, and that of the 20 % SS was lowest among the samples (p< 0. 05). The linoleic acid content of the control, the 10 % SS, and the 20 % SS was 28. 68 %, 41. 04 %, and 54. 26 %, respectively. The total unsaturated fatty acid content of the control, the 10 % SS, and the 20 % SS was 50. 53 %, 55. 76 %, and 64. 93 %, respectively. The linoleic acid and the total unsaturated fatty acid content were highest in the 20 % SS (p< 0. 05). There {{was no significant difference in}} amino acid composition.

40|$|THE {{production}} of safflower {{in this country}} has increased enormously in the last few years. The oil may be re-moved from the <b>safflower</b> <b>seed</b> commer-cially and the residue which is left is avail-able for animal and poultry feeding. The undecorticated safflower cake contains 20. 2 percent protein and 33. 0 percent fiber (Woodman, 1945) and is of little interest to the poultry industry because of its high fiber content. However, by a decortication process it is possible to pro-duce a meal with much higher protein and lower fiber content which compares favor-ably in gross analysis to other vegetable <b>oil</b> <b>seed</b> products commonly used i...|$|R

40|$|Background: Studies of the biogeographic {{distribution}} of <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content in plants are fundamental {{to understanding the}} mechanisms of adaptive evolution in plants as <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> is the primary energy source needed for germination and establishment of plants. However, <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content as an adaptive trait in plants is poorly understood. Here, we examine the adaptive nature of <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content in 168 angiosperm families occurring in different biomes across the world. We also explore the role of multiple seed traits like <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content and composition in plant adaptation in a phylogenetic and nonphylogenetic context. Result: It was observed that the <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content in tropical plants (28. 4 %) {{was significantly higher than}} the temperate plants (24. 6 %). A significant relationship between oil content and latitude was observed in three families Papaveraceae, Sapindaceae and Sapotaceae indicating that selective forces correlated with latitude influence <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content. Evaluation of the response of <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content and composition to latitude and the correlation between <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content and composition showed that multiple <b>seed</b> traits, <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content and composition contribute towards plant adaptation. Investigation of {{the presence or absence of}} phylogenetic signals across 168 angiosperm families in 62 clades revealed that members of seven clades evolved to have high or low <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content independently as they did not share a common evolutionary path. Conclusion: The study provides us an insight into the biogeographical distribution and the adaptive role of <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content in plants. The study indicates that multiple seed traits like <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content and the fatty acid composition of the <b>seed</b> <b>oils</b> determine the fitness of the plants and validate the adaptive hypothesis that <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> quantity and quality are crucial to plant adaptation...|$|R
