25|$|The <b>surfboard</b> fin, or keel, is {{the part}} of the back of a <b>surfboard</b> that enters the water. Similar to a rudder on a boat the <b>surfboard</b> fin works to steer the board and provide stability. The <b>surfboard</b> fin {{prevents}} a surfer from uncontrollably spinning in circles while trying to ride a wave. The <b>surfboard</b> fin was invented by Tom Blake in 1935.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>surfboard</b> lock is {{a device}} or a {{mechanism}} for securing a <b>surfboard</b> to prevent theft or loss. Typically <b>surfboard</b> locks attach to {{some part of the}} <b>surfboard,</b> such as the leash plug or center fin box slot.

25|$|A <b>surfboard</b> leash or leg rope is {{the cord}} that {{attaches}} a <b>surfboard</b> to the surfer. It prevents the <b>surfboard</b> from being {{swept away by}} waves and prevents a runaway <b>surfboard</b> from hitting other surfers and swimmers. Modern leashes comprise a urethane cord where one end has a band with a velcro strap attached to the surfer's trailing foot, and the opposite has a velcro strap attached to {{the tail end of}} the <b>surfboard.</b> The <b>surfboard</b> leash was invented in 1970 by Santa Cruz, California resident Pat O'Neill, son of wetsuit innovator Jack O'Neill, who fastened surgical tubing to the nose of his <b>surfboard</b> with a suction cup looped to the end of his wrist in order to leverage turns and cutbacks in the water. However, modifications in 1971 by O'Neill made the surf leash attached to the ankle and to a <b>surfboard's</b> tail, a practice still in use today.|$|R
5|$|The James Edgar and Jean Jessop Hervey Public Library {{opened in}} 2003, {{replacing}} {{a much smaller}} public library.

The library, located at 3701 Voltaire Street, is over 25,000 square feet and holds over 80,000 books. It includes a kitchen area, a community meeting room, and outdoor sitting patios. The lower floor is the largest children's library in the City of San Diego, featuring a simulated ship, reading desks shaped like <b>surfboards,</b> an art space and a Story Time Zone. In connecting to the place of Point Loma, the library's architectural style features a nautical theme. There is even an operating periscope, salvaged from a U.S. Navy submarine, through which visitors can see the surrounding neighborhood. The floor in the entry lobby features a terrazzo map of the Point Loma Peninsula. The library holds scheduled events such as story time for children, Thursday after school movies, and arts and crafts demonstrations.|$|E

25|$|Jarvis Island was {{reclaimed}} by the United States {{government and}} colonized from March 26, 1935 onwards, under the American Equatorial Islands Colonization Project (see also Howland Island and Baker Island). President Franklin D. Roosevelt assigned {{administration of the}} island to the U.S. Department of the Interior on May 13, 1936. Starting out as a cluster of large, open tents pitched next to the still-standing white wooden day beacon, the Millersville settlement on the island's western shore was named after a bureaucrat with the United States Department of Air Commerce. The settlement grew into a group of shacks built mostly with wreckage from the Amaranth (lumber from which was also used by the young Hawaiian colonists to build <b>surfboards),</b> but later, stone and wood dwellings were built and equipped with refrigeration, radio equipment, and a weather station. A crude aircraft landing area was cleared on the northeast side of the island, and a T-shaped marker which {{was intended to be}} seen from the air was made from gathered stones, but no airplane is known to have ever landed there.|$|E

500|$|The show {{is meant}} {{to take place in}} the Southern California city of Santa Barbara; however, most of the series is filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, and the {{surrounding}} communities. The majority of the scenes are filmed in the suburb community of White Rock, especially those including the ocean or coastline. Speaking about filming the show, Steve Franks stated that [...] "I swear it's San Clemente, CA. It couldn't look more like it". In order to make the sets appear as Santa Barbara, the show's crew members installed many props stereotypical to Southern California, including fake palm trees, <b>surfboards,</b> and the California-published newspaper, the Santa Maria Sun. The production crew had to truck in eight palm trees to each set during filming.|$|E

500|$|A promotional {{music video}} was {{produced}} {{to accompany the}} release of [...] "Do or Die" [...] as a single. The video was directed by Jake & Jim who also directed the video for the group's previous single, [...] "Fire in My Heart".

The band's heads and instruments are live action footage, filmed in London, while their bodies and surroundings are brightly coloured animations. During the first verse, shots of the group playing the track in the room are intercut with images of band members on cartoon <b>surfboards</b> superimposed onto real life footage of giant waves. This process is repeated during the second chorus, with the video cutting between shots of the band playing in the room and images of the band superimposed onto live footage of tornados. After 1 minute and 4 seconds images of the group's heads being swept along in a lava flow are intercut with the band playing along with the track in the now red room with lava visible through the windows. Snow then begins to fall in the room and the video cuts to shots of the group eascaping an avalanche in a bobsled. As the track ends the lightbulb in the room begins to swing frantically and Super Furry Animals are bathed in a green [...] "radioactive or alien glow". A shot of the house in front of a nuclear explosion cuts to footage of the band frozen mid-word, with the camera moving through 360 degrees to reveal them as two dimensional cutouts.
