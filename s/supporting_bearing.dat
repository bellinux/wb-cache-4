40|$|Vertical {{earthquake}} loading {{is normally}} regarded {{not as important}} as its horizontal components and are not explicitly considered in many seismic design codes. However, some previous severe near-fault earthquakes reveal that the vertical ground motion component can be much larger than the horizontal components and may cause serious damage to the bridge structures. This paper theoretically investigates the vertical pounding responses of a two-span continuous bridge subjected to the severe near-fault vertical ground motions. The bridge is simplified as a continuous beam-spring-rod model. The structural wave effect and the vertical pounding between the bridge girder and the <b>supporting</b> <b>bearing</b> are considered, and the theoretical solutions of bridge seismic responses are derived from the expansion of transient wave functions as a series of eigenfunctions. The effects of vertical earthquake and vertical pounding on the bridge bearing, girder and pier are investigated. The numerical results show that the severe vertical earthquake loading may cause the bridge girder to separate from the <b>supporting</b> <b>bearing</b> and hence result in vertical poundings between them when they are in contact again. These vertical poundings can significantly alter the seismic responses of the bridge structure and may cause severe damage to the bridge components such as bridge girder, <b>supporting</b> <b>bearing</b> and bridge pier. Neglecting the influence of vertical earthquake loading may lead to inaccurate estimation of seismic responses of bridge structures, especially when they are subjected to near-fault earthquake with relatively large vertical motion...|$|E

Since two issues are much sensitive {{to the location of}} both <b>supporting</b> <b>bearing</b> and unbalance mass at a balance shaft, it is recommended to construct a design strategy on balance shaft at the early stage so as to save developing time and effort before approaches to the detailed design process. In this paper, an optimal design formulation is proposed to minimize the elastic strain energy due to bending as well as the kinematic energy of polar moment of inertia in rotation. Case studies of optimal design are conducted for different mass ratio as well as linear combination of objective function and its consequence reveals that global optimum of balance shaft model is existed over possible design conditions.

40|$|The shaft {{alignment}} {{problem is}} related to the propulsion shafting sensitivity to small disturbances in the <b>supporting</b> <b>bearing</b> offsets. The primary contributor to the bearing offset disturbances on the vessel in operation is from the hull girder deflections {{as the result of a}} change of the loading condition of the vessel. The ability to predict hull deflections with sufficient accuracy is of the foremost importance in order to ensure robust alignment design, and consequently, less alignment-related casualties. In order to achieve the above objective, ABS is conducting a series of hull girder deflection measurements on a number of vessels of different types and sizes. Collected data is to be applied in the ABS Shaft Alignment Optimization software to provide a basis for more robust shaft alignment design which will be less susceptible to the alignment condition change during the operation of the vessel. The subject paper discusses the hull deflection acquisition method and highlights the advantages of the presented optimization procedure.

40|$|This {{article is}} {{concerned}} with the particular case of the semi-cylindrical barrel vaulted Macedonian tomb of "Eurydice", the earliest known Macedonian contribution to the development of vaulted Hellenistic architecture and structure. This tomb is considered as a critical case in the problematic chronology of barrel vault application in early Hellenistic architecture (around 340 BCE), represented by the Macedonian tombs. Still, perhaps the most striking features of the tomb– the physical structures of the barrel vault – have not been subjected to geometrical and engineering structural analysis. The paper’s scope focuses on the structural assessment of Eurydice tomb construction. The paper primary objectives are to develop an understanding of the structural mechanics of Eurydice barrel vault within the <b>supporting</b> <b>bearing</b> walls, and to investigate the tomb unique geometrical and structural design. In order to accomplish this task, a general historical and structural behavior study was carried out regarding the barrel vault and its geometry, by following the theories developed by recent researchers, in order to compare these results and to rationalize them in this unique example of Eurydice tomb. Mainly, to undertake a task, that till now, was never accomplished. The results of this work show that Eurydice tomb exhibits such a high structural integrity and strength, demonstrating the ability of early Hellenistic architects to construct extremely safe barrel vaulting structures. The paper also argues that, the tomb architect was familiar with the main theoretical laws of structural force mechanics of the barrel vault, which were commonly accredited to the Romans, and that were later on revived until the 18 th century...|$|E

40|$|This study {{outlines}} a prestressed reactor pressure vessel, with integrated core-catching device, whose principal design {{characteristics are}} essentially oriented {{to the requirements}} of a 1300 MW_e_ 1 Konvoi pressurised water reactor. On the one hand, this type of core meltdown is retained in a relatively limited volume, in the course of which a reaction with water entering from the outside is repressed. On the other hand the selection is permitted of a prestressed reactor pressure vessel which is far greater than the size of conventional steel pressure vessels and, in addition, avoids accident sequences deriving from the spontaneous integral failure of the steel pressure vessel (bursting). The special feature of prestressed vessels is the devolution of various subfunctions to the individual vessel components. By the separation into <b>supporting,</b> <b>bearing</b> and sealing functions, the individual components can be optimised according to their specific requirements. In none of the structural components and loading cases investigated have impermissible stress values been achieved or even exeeded. The tensile stresses in the vessel components lie markedly under those of conventional vessel and, as the stress calculation show, only occur in small ranges. The separation of the prestressed reactor pressure vessel from core retention device via a so-called grider which permits the retention device to be braced separately from the vessel. A changing of the vertical fissure geometry into a broad upper inflow fissure and a narrower bottom fissure favours heat dissipation in the assumed core meltdown accident, in which a separation into metallic and oxidic phases is to be pressumed. In none of the suggested core meltdown scenarios is the load-bearing capacity of the casting material of the internal core-catcher exceeded. (orig.)

40|$|The design {{reliability}} of the theory applied when calculating the sensitivity of shafting alignment must be determined especially at the initial design stage of shafting arrangement and calculation for the vertical static bearing loads (reaction forces) and pressures {{in order to obtain}} positive uniform values, which have to comply with the design requirements of the High Speed Craft Code of Classification Society. Any poor design of shafting arrangement for each vertical static bearing location and/or bearing off-set design value may cause a failed shafting alignment calculation and a non-uniform bearing load or over excessive bearing load and pressure on the propulsion shaft stern tube/strut <b>supporting</b> <b>bearing</b> and possible further damage, for example, excessive wastage and/or crack on a damaged aft shaft strut bearing for a high speed craft.

The design values for each vertical static bearing load and pressure calculated by theoretical design methodologies of the finite element method (FEM) and the three moment equation method (TMEM) were compared with the shipyard original design values for the same design case of propulsion shafting system. The design deviation of the vertical static bearing from the shipyard original design values was determined in order to decide which design methodology (TMEM or FEM) would be adopted and developed for further numerical algorithm design on shafting alignment optimization. According to the obtained results, both the FEM and the TMEM theoretical design accuracy and reliability were well matched with the shipyard original design values.
