50|$|The {{structure}} of a class-D power stage is essentially identical {{to that of a}} synchronously rectified buck converter (a type of non-isolated switched-mode power supply (SMPS)). Whereas buck converters usually function as voltage regulators, delivering a constant DC voltage into a variable load and can only source current (one-quadrant operation), a class-D amplifier delivers a constantly changing voltage into a fixed load, where current and voltage can independently change sign (four-quadrant operation). A <b>switching</b> <b>amplifier</b> must not be confused with linear amplifiers that use an SMPS as their source of DC power. A <b>switching</b> <b>amplifier</b> may use any type of power supply (e.g., a car battery or an internal SMPS), but the defining characteristic is that the amplification process itself operates by switching.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Since the xDSL {{specifications}} impose stringent {{linearity requirements}} {{to ensure the}} integrity of the data transferred, current line drivers use linear amplifiers. The downside of these solutions is their power consumption, as the xDSL modulation has a high peak to average ratio, forcing the amplifier to operate in its least efficient region. An alternative is the use of <b>switching</b> <b>amplifiers,</b> which theoretically have an efficiency of 100 %. However, the nonlinear nature of these amplifiers complicates the design. To meet the linearity requirements, the switching frequency should be sufficiently high, but as this is limited by the technology used, additional techniques must be adopted. Therefor, a self-oscillating topology has been chosen and a mathematical model of the loop formulated to predict its behaviour. The model is then validated by numerical simulations on macro-blocks, yielding the values required for an implementation on silicon.

5000|$|A class-D {{amplifier}} or <b>switching</b> <b>amplifier</b> is {{an electronic}} amplifier {{in which the}} amplifying devices (transistors, usually MOSFETs) operate as electronic switches, and not as linear gain devices as in other amplifiers. The signal to be amplified is a train of constant amplitude pulses, so the active devices switch rapidly {{back and forth between}} a fully conductive and nonconductive state. The analog signal to be amplified is converted to a series of pulses by pulse width modulation, pulse density modulation or other methods before being applied to the amplifier. After amplification, the output pulse train can be converted back to an analog signal by passing through a passive low pass filter consisting of inductors and capacitors.|$|E

40|$|Background: The task of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} {{the possibility of using}} non-linear high efficiency switching power amplifiers with spectrally efficient varying envelope modulation schemes and, if possible, further investigate such a solution on a high level. The thesis focuses on the theory necessary to understand the technical issues related to power amplifiers and the procedures behind simulating and measuring the characteristics of different power amplifier configurations. The thesis also covers basic theory behind Delta-Sigma-modulators. The theory is needed to draw conclusions about the feasibility of using a Delta-Sigma-modulator as input to a <b>switching</b> <b>amplifier.</b> Results: Using a Delta-Sigma-modulated input to a <b>switching</b> <b>amplifier</b> inherently degrades the performance, mainly because of poor coding efficiency and high switching activity. However, by merely using a <b>switching</b> <b>amplifier</b> as a mixer it is shown to be possible to transmit a non-constant envelope signal, with digital logic. The resulting circuit is, however, not an amplifier and it should not be seen as the final result. As already mentioned: the result lies in the investigation of a using Delta-Sigma-modulator as input to a <b>switching</b> <b>amplifier.</b> Conclusion: From this investigation we believe that the widely known technique: pulse width modulation (PWM), together with a tuned <b>switching</b> <b>amplifier</b> and some linearization technique, for example pre-distortion, is a better way to go. Much effort should be put in understanding the fundamental limits and possibilities of an efficient tuned switching power amplifier...|$|E

40|$|This work {{deals with}} {{multi-level}} <b>switching</b> <b>amplifiers,</b> {{in the context}} of high-efficiency power amplification for signal tracking applications. In particular, this paper evaluates the reduction in the error signal's power due to multi-level power amplification (compared to conventional two-level amplifiers) and compares the performance of two multi-level pulse modulations: PWM and Asynchronous ${{Sigma}} {{Delta}}$ Modulation. First the intrinsic bandwidth limits of multi-level <b>switching</b> <b>amplifiers</b> are inferred, to clearly state the advantages and limitations of multi-level power amplification. From the existing analyses of Pulse Width Modulation already reported in the literature, PWM is herein extended to multiple levels based on an equivalent representation, which allows to derive a closed expression for the power spectrum of multi-level PWM in bandlimited signal tracking. The Asynchronous ${{Sigma}} {{Delta}}$ Modulation is extended to multiple levels and the resulting multi-level encoding algorithm is analyzed in both time and frequency domains. The performance of both modulations is characterized and compared at different operating frequencies and using different number of levels. The main outcomes of this in-depth characterization show that, if the switching frequency is high enough, the tracking error is independent of the modulation and the switching frequency, i. e., it only depends upon the number of levels, which points out the suitability of asynchronous modulations for relatively low switching frequencies (compared to the number of levels).
