Jones agreed, she said, {{out of a sense}} of patriotism.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the release}} and {{commercial}} success of [...] "Love the Way You Lie" [...] in 2010, Eminem wanted to record an alternative version with Rihanna {{as the lead}} vocalist, viewing aspects of a relationship from a female perspective, unlike the original, which featured Eminem as lead vocalist and was from a male perspective. In an interview for MTV, Rihanna initially stated she was against recording a sequel: [...] "When I first heard the idea about doing a part two, I was just completely against it. I just felt like you couldn't beat the 'original'. There's {{no way you can}} outdo that, so why compete with it?". <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>when</b> she first heard the original demo of the song in the studio with Eminem, sung by American singer-songwriter Skylar Grey, her reservations about recording it went away. While the demo was only accompanied by a piano, Rihanna and her team added drums and later vocals from Eminem.|$|E
500|$|Rowling {{was born}} to Peter James Rowling, a Rolls-Royce {{aircraft}} engineer, and Anne Rowling (née Volant), a science technician, on 31 July 1965 in Yate, [...] Gloucestershire, England, [...] northeast of Bristol. Her parents first met on a train departing from King's Cross Station bound for Arbroath in 1964. They married on 14 March 1965. One of her maternal great-grandfathers, Dugald Campbell, was Scottish, born in Lamlash on the Isle of Arran. Her mother's paternal grandfather, Louis Volant, was French, and was awarded the Croix de Guerre for exceptional bravery in defending the village of Courcelles-le-Comte during the First World War. Rowling originally believed he had won the Légion d'honneur during the war, as <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>when</b> she received it herself in 2009. She later discovered the truth when featured in an episode of the UK genealogy series Who Do You Think You Are?, in which she {{found out it was}} a different Louis Volant who won the Legion of Honour. When she heard his story of bravery and discovered the croix de guerre was for [...] "ordinary" [...] soldiers like her grandfather, who had been a waiter, she stated the croix de guerre was [...] "better" [...] to her than the Legion of Honour.|$|E
6000|$|There was {{something}} pathetic in this announcement, and Marcia sighed as <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> 'Perhaps <b>when</b> you get strong {{it will come}} back to you.' ...|$|R

2500|$|... "It {{seems very}} pretty," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>when</b> she had {{finished}} it, [...] "but it's rather hard to understand!" [...] (You see she didn't like to confess, even to herself, that she couldn't make it out at all.) [...] "Somehow it seems to fill my head with ideas—only I don't exactly know what they are! However, somebody killed something: that's clear, at any rate." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jill Marie Jones {{left the}} show {{at the end of}} Season 6. Akil stated, [...] "I would love for her (Jones) to come back, but Jill doesn't want to return. I don't know 100% why she made this decision. She didn't tell me. All <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>when</b> we talked was that she felt it was time for her to move on. The door is not closed. We've asked her to come back and have offered {{different}} ways for her to return. But I completely wish her well. There's no drama involved." ...|$|E
2500|$|Izz al-Masri {{was escorted}} to the {{restaurant}} by Ahlam Tamimi, a 20-year-old female university student and part-time journalist, who had disguised herself as a Jewish tourist for the occasion. She later commented {{that she was not}} sorry for what she had done and does not recognize Israel’s existence. [...] "Despite the fact that I'm sentenced to 16 life sentences I know that we will become free from Israeli occupation and then I will also be free from the prison," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said.</b> <b>When</b> she first learned from a journalist who was interviewing her in jail that she had murdered eight children, not just three as she had initially believed, she just smiled broadly and continued with the interview.|$|E

2500|$|Premiered in December 1981, {{the film}} was well {{received}} by critics, and after a limited release on December 4, On Golden Pond developed enough of an audience to be widely released on January 22. With 10 Academy Award nominations, the film earned nearly $120 million at the box office, becoming an unexpected blockbuster. In addition to wins for Hepburn (Best Actress), and Thompson (Screenplay), On Golden Pond brought Fonda his only Oscar - for Best Actor (he was the oldest recipient of the award; it also earned him a Golden Globe Best Actor award). [...] Fonda was by that point too ill to attend the ceremony, and his daughter Jane accepted on his behalf. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>when</b> accepting the award that her dad would probably quip, [...] "Well, ain't I lucky." [...] After Fonda's death, some film critics called this performance [...] "his last and greatest role".|$|E
2500|$|... "Kill the Boy" [...] was {{initially}} {{expected to be}} the first single released by Sandé, due to Sandé's strong promotion of the song. There were a number of songs which have had media attention: [...] "Kill the Boy", [...] "Easier in Bed" [...] and [...] "Summer of Wonder". An acoustic version of [...] "Easier in Bed" [...] was released onto iTunes on 12 December 2012. [...] "Summer of Wonder" [...] is a song which was written by her and Naughty Boy, which was not used and instead she used the song title for her upcoming summer tour entitled Summer of Wonder Tour. [...] "Boys" [...] which was Cheryl Cole's B-side track to [...] "3 Words" [...] was originally for Sandé's album. However, <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>when</b> she heard Cole sing it, she loved how what the lyrics meant to Cole was different from what they meant to her when she wrote it, so Sandé decided to give the track to Cole.|$|E
2500|$|Of the {{dramatic}} shift from one {{show to the}} other, Debnam-Carey stated, [...] "It was super weird, it was like 'I have no power anymore! No weapons, no power!' But maybe eventually, Alica {{will be able to}} have her own kind of power." [...] Lexa, with [...] "such an iconic look and distinct wardrobe," [...] was an alien role for Debnam-Carey. She stated, [...] "I signed on for this role at a time in my personal and work life when {{there was a little bit}} of a lull period. I was like, 'I don't know what I'm doing!' It was one of those actor freak-out moments." [...] <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>when</b> the chance to portray Lexa presented itself, she was excited because of the quality of the show and its actors, and because the character allowed for a multifaceted dynamic; this resulted in Lexa being the character she has favored portraying thus far. [...] "Thankfully, (show creator) Jason , the creative team, the writers, and the hair and make-up are very collaborative," [...] Debnam-Carey said. [...] "They're really willing to create something. And that's what's so lucky about this show. It never started with expectation, so we've been able to embrace it and really make it our own, and that's been wonderful." ...|$|E

6000|$|... “This won’t do, at all,” <b>she</b> <b>said</b> anxiously, <b>when</b> baby Jane had sobbed {{herself into}} a doze, with the bottle to comfort her. “If we scream again it will frighten the child to death.” ...|$|R

6000|$|... "After adventures like these, I don't wonder {{it seems}} hard to settle down, as other folks do," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> warmly, <b>when</b> the man stopped short, as if ashamed of talking {{so much of}} his own affairs.|$|R
