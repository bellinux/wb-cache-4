40|$|ABSTRACT: Pavement/vehicle {{interaction}} {{is one of}} the growing areas in asphalt pavement design. Traffic volumes have increased considerably over the past few decades, and not only are modern trucks carrying heavier payloads, but they are also using fewer tyres which have higher inflation pressures and hence higher contact stresses than was previously the case. The aim {{of this paper is to}} highlight the variabilities associated with actual measured three-dimensional tyre-pavement contact loading/stress regimes of modern truck tyres. Tyre-pavement contact stress measurements were carried out on a busy national road (N 3) in South Africa from the port of Durban to the inland province of Gauteng. The three-dimensional tyre-pavement contact stress regimes of 45 227 individual tyres were measured using the Stress-In-Motion (SIM) system. In addition, the loading on each tyre was also captured. This measurement series was performed at slow (< 5 km/hr) creep speed conditions at a controlled weigh-bridge as part of the N 3 Traffic Control Centre (N 3 -TCC) near Heidelberg in SA. Mechanistic Analysis indicated that near surface <b>Strain</b> <b>Energy</b> <b>of</b> <b>Distortion</b> (SED) may be utilised for pavement rutting studies in this asphalt layers...|$|E
40|$|This paper (Part 2 of {{a two-part}} set of papers) {{discusses}} models and illustrates {{the adverse effects}} of weak layers, interlayers, laminations and/or weak interfaces in flexible and semi-flexible pavements, also incorporating lightly cemented layers. The modelling is based on mechanistic analyses for pavement design and evaluation. In Part 1, {{the effects of these}} relatively weak layers, interlayers, laminations and/or weak interfaces were discussed. It was shown that methodologies are available to detect and investigate the existence of these weak layers in cemented pavement layers. In Part 2, several cases of the above conditions for different road pavement types are discussed, with field examples. Mechanistic analyses were done on a typical hot mix asphalt (HMA), several cases of a cemented base pavement and a granular base pavement, with and without these weak layers and interface conditions to demonstrate their adverse effects. The analyses focus on the <b>strain</b> <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> <b>distortion</b> (SED) as a pavement response parameter to indicate the potential for structural damage expected within the pavement structure or layer. Generally, the higher the SED, the higher the potential damage in the pavement layer.

40|$|Delamination is {{a common}} defect in plastic-encapsulated {{packages}} (PEM), which is a separation or cracks of interfaces between two materials (EMC/metal, EMC/die, etc. in an IC package) mainly cause by the mismatch of coefficient of expansion (CTE) between the epoxy molding compound (EMC), leadframe and the dies. To solve this problem, the interfacial properties of the EMC/Cu are studied in this thesis. The button shear test was carried out to evaluate the bimaterial interfacial properties between epoxy molding compound (EMC) and bare copper leadframe. Three dimensional finite element analysis is conducted on the button shear test sample. The fracture loads obtained from the button shear test are plug into the finite element model to determine the critical stress components and the critical distortional energy density DSED and hydrostatic <b>energy</b> density HSED <b>of</b> the interface. The critical distortional <b>strain</b> <b>energy</b> density (<b>strain</b> <b>energy</b> density <b>of</b> <b>distortion</b> per unit volume) can be thought as a material property like Kc, Gc, or Sc for the interfacial fracture of EMC/Cu. The failure in the interface initiates when DSED > DSED, c. With the experimental data support, it is proved {{that there is a}} linear relationship between the critical distortional SED per square fracture load and the reciprocal of the EMC's Young's Modulus. This relationship established a universe interfacial failure criterion line for EMC/Copper leadframe of a specified shear height. The SED ratio R has successful established the relationship between the shear height in button shear test and the critical distortional <b>strain</b> <b>energy</b> density DSED. The value of R has a physical significance that higher value of R means the fracture mode in the interface tends to mode 2 (shear) fracture whereas the lower value of R means the failure mode tends to mode 1 (tensile) fracture in the button shear test. The thin quad flat package (TQFP) that packed with a stress chip has benchmarked the quarter three-dimensional TQFP finite element model.

The elasticity treatment {{is based on the}} Green's function solution for a center of contraction or expansion in an anisotropic solid. It makes possible the precise definition of a formation volume tensor and leads to an extension of Eshelby's result for the work done by an external stress during the transformation of a continuum inclusion (Proc. Roy. Soc. Lond. Ser. A, 241 (1226) 376, 1957). Parameters necessary for a complete continuum calculation of elastic fields around a point defect are obtained by comparing with an atomistic solution in the far field. However, an elasticity result makes it possible to test the validity of the formation volume that is obtained via atomistic calculations under various boundary conditions. It also yields the correction term for formation volume calculated under these boundary conditions. Using two types of boundary conditions commonly employed in atomistic calculations, a comparison is also made <b>of</b> the <b>strain</b> <b>energies</b> <b>of</b> formation predicted by continuum elasticity and atomistic calculations.
