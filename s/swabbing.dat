40|$|Thesis (M. S. F. S.) <b>Swabs</b> are an {{integral}} part of any forensic science “toolkit”. They can be used to gather many types of evidence at crime scenes, in the lab, or even in the hospital or morgue. Cotton <b>swabs</b> have been the traditional choice for most forensic laboratories, and for sexual assault kits. They have been the obvious choice for decades as cotton <b>swabs</b> were really the only option and they were and still are relatively inexpensive and easy to obtain. In the past dozen years or so, new synthetic fibers have been incorporated into novel <b>swab</b> designs. Fiber <b>swabs</b> can be made of polyester or rayon, polyurethane foam <b>swabs</b> can be round, narrow, oval or arrow shaped; <b>swabs</b> can also be flocked, or sprayed with strands of material such as nylon. The effectiveness of any type of <b>swab</b> used to collect biological material is based on three characteristics: the ability to pick up the material for which they are designed, the ability to hold that material until processed and then the ability to release as much of that material as possible to be analyzed in the lab. In this study, the efficacy of four different commercially available <b>swabs</b> to collect, store and release spermatozoa was evaluated. Puritan Cotton fiber <b>swabs,</b> Fisher Polyester fiber <b>swabs,</b> Fisher polyurethane <b>swabs,</b> and Copan nylon flocked <b>swabs</b> were all compared for their ability to pick-up and elute cells from solid surfaces. The surfaces included three types of commonly found tile: a smooth glossy ceramic tile, a rough non-porous ceramic tile, and a smooth semi-porous quarry tile. In general, polyester fiber <b>swabs</b> outperformed both the polyurethane foam and the nylon flocked <b>swab</b> when used on all three surfaces (P < 0. 05). Polyester <b>swabs</b> were not significantly different from the cotton fiber <b>swabs</b> even though the average number of cells picked-up and eluted was higher overall. <b>Swabs</b> used to collect postcoital samples were also compared. Volunteer couples were given a variety of <b>swabs</b> to use after intercourse. The result of the comparison for the same four <b>swab</b> types when used as postcoital <b>swabs</b> was different from the results of the tile study. After estimating the number of cells collected and released from each <b>swab,</b> a comparison was made within each couple. Nylon flocked <b>swabs</b> yielded the highest level of cellular material overall and foam <b>swabs</b> recovered the least. This study demonstrates the need for further research into different <b>swab</b> types and in what capacities they are to be used in forensic science...|$|R
500|$|In 2010 Metro {{once again}} {{announced}} that it would implement random bag searches, and conducted the first such searches on December 21, 2010. The searches consist of <b>swabbing</b> bags and packages for explosive residue, and X-raying or opening any packages which turned up positive. On the first day of searches, at least one false positive for explosives was produced, which Metro officials indicated could occur {{for a variety of reasons}} including if a passenger had recently been in contact with firearms or been to a firing range. The D.C. Bill of Rights Coalition and the Montgomery County Civil Rights Coalition circulated a petition against random bag searches, taking the position that the practice violates the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and would not improve security. On January 3, 2011, Metro held a public forum for the searches at a Metro Riders' Advisory Council meeting, at which more than 50 riders spoke out, most of them in opposition to the searches. However at the meeting Metro officials called random bag inspections a [...] "success" [...] and claimed that few riders had complained.|$|E
500|$|When {{a person}} is arrested and taken into police custody, he has been seized (i.e., a {{reasonable}} person who is handcuffed {{and placed in the}} back of a police car would not think they were free to leave).

The entry reading [...] "CP", for example, had referred to the injections of chlorpromazine he had injected into his victims to assist in his restraining them, whereas entries reading [...] "DC" [...] would refer to the <b>swabbing</b> of their eyes with drain cleaner or the injection of the substance into their vocal cords. Entries reading [...] "EK" [...] or [...] "EKG" [...] had referred to the method of torture administered to his captives with electrical shots, whereas several other entries would also read the location Berdella had administered the abuse or torture to his victims.

40|$|For {{several years}} we used rayon or Dacron <b>swabs</b> with liquid {{transport}} media for {{collection and transport}} of throat <b>swab</b> specimens for testing with the Gen-Probe Group A Strep Direct Test (GASDT). A report of favorable results with a Dacron <b>swab</b> without any transport media for GASDT by another laboratory prompted us to compare detection of group A streptococci (GAS) with and without transport media (referred to as “wet” and “dry” <b>swabs,</b> respectively). Phase one of this study used <b>swabs</b> seeded with GAS. Initially, six recent clinical isolates of GAS were inoculated onto wet and dry <b>swabs</b> and stored at room temperature (RT). After 1, 2, and 3 days of storage, colony counting and GASDT were performed with the <b>swabs.</b> The results, expressed as the mean percentage of the results at zero time, were as follows: for GASDT with wet <b>swabs</b> at 1, 2, and 3 days, 62, 51, and 56 %, respectively; for GASDT with dry <b>swabs</b> at 1, 2, and 3 days, 105, 80, and 85 %, respectively; for colony counts with wet <b>swabs</b> at 1, 2, and 3 days, 52, 26, and 13 %, respectively; for colony counts with dry <b>swabs</b> at 1, 2, and 3 days, 10, 0, and 0 %, respectively. An additional six strains of GAS were tested in a similar manner, except that extracts of pharyngeal flora (PF) {{were added to the}} inocula. The results obtained with extracts of PF were comparable to those obtained with GAS alone. We also compared the performance of GASDT with wet and dry <b>swabs</b> stored at RT and 4 °C. Ten strains of GAS were inoculated onto wet and dry <b>swabs,</b> and GASDT was performed each day for 9 days. The GASDT results for <b>swabs</b> on day 9, expressed as the mean percentage of the results obtained at zero time, were as follows: dry <b>swab</b> and 4 °C, 59 %; wet <b>swab</b> and 4 °C, 31 %; dry <b>swab</b> and RT, 33 %; and wet <b>swab</b> and RT, 19 %. In phase two of this study we conducted a clinical evaluation to determine whether the differences observed with seeded specimens would also be evident with patient specimens. We used a single dry Dacron <b>swab</b> paired with a single rayon Bacti-Swab with liquid Stuart transport medium for the clinical evaluation. Specimens were collected from 1, 005 outpatients, plated onto a Strep Selective Agar plate, and then tested within 30 min by GASDT. If culture of GAS from the same <b>swab</b> is used to define a true-positive test result, the sensitivities and specificities were as follows: GASDT with wet <b>swabs,</b> 86. 2 and 98. 5 %, respectively; GASDT with dry <b>swabs,</b> 90. 7 and 98. 1 %, respectively. However, the use of culture as the “gold standard” may understate the actual performance characteristics of GASDT, particularly for the dry <b>swabs.</b> In conclusion, for GASDT the use of <b>swabs</b> without transport media may be preferable to the use of <b>swabs</b> with transport media...|$|R

Our objective {{was to determine whether}} sampling with a throat <b>swab</b> provides incremental benefit—when used in conjunction with a nasal swab—to detect respiratory viruses among patients with acute pharyngitis in the outpatient setting. Findings Among 83 university students with acute pharyngitis, we detected respiratory viruses with molecular assays on two samples collected per student: with a flocked nasal mid-turbinate <b>swab</b> and a rayon throat <b>swab.</b> Forty-eight (58  %) patients had virus-positive samples, with 49 virus positives detected by either <b>swab</b> (one patient had a dual viral co-infection). The most common viruses were rhinovirus, coronavirus, and influenza A virus. Specifically, 29 virus positives were detected by both <b>swabs,</b> 14 exclusively by the nasal <b>swab,</b> and six exclusively by the throat <b>swab.</b> The additional six virus positives detected by the throat <b>swab</b> corresponded to an absolute increase in viral detection of 7. 1  % (95  % CI: 1. 2 – 12. 9  %); the specific viruses detected were four rhinoviruses and two coronaviruses. Conclusions The flocked nasal <b>swab</b> samples respiratory viruses well, even among patients whose primary complaint is a sore throat. The rayon throat <b>swab</b> has modest incremental value over and above using the flocked nasal mid-turbinate <b>swab</b> alone, which suggests that while throat <b>swabs</b> alone would not be adequate for respiratory viral surveillance, they may have value as a supplementary test...|$|R
