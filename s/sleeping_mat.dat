6000|$|... "Bukawai's {{medicine}} is very strong," [...] said the voice. [...] "Five goats {{and a new}} <b>sleeping</b> <b>mat</b> are scarce enough in exchange for Bukawai's medicine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Two fat {{goats and}} a {{sleeping}} mat." [...] Momaya raised her bid; but Bukawai was obdurate. He stuck {{for the five}} goats and the <b>sleeping</b> <b>mat</b> for a matter of half an hour, while the hyenas sniffed and growled and laughed hideously. Momaya was determined to give all that Bukawai {{asked if she could}} do no better, but haggling is second nature to black barterers, and in the end it partly repaid her, for a compromise finally was reached which included three fat goats, a new <b>sleeping</b> <b>mat,</b> and a piece of copper wire.|$|E
6000|$|... "I have come," [...] said Bukawai without preliminary, [...] "for {{the three}} fat goats, the new <b>sleeping</b> <b>mat,</b> and {{the bit of}} copper wire {{as long as a}} tall man's arm." ...|$|E

5|$|After the storm, the {{government}} of Somaliland distributed rice, sugar, and plastic sheets for housing. After Chapala and the subsequent Cyclone Megh, the local Red Cross chapter distributed blankets, <b>sleeping</b> <b>mats,</b> and mattresses to the affected families. The CARE relief agency provided US$300,000 toward restoring water and relief goods.|$|R
60|$|Bukawai {{saw them}} go, and he mumbled through his rotting face, {{swearing}} a great oath {{that he would}} yet have the three fat goats, the new <b>sleeping</b> <b>mat,</b> and the bit of copper wire.|$|E
6000|$|... "I have no goats for you," [...] snapped Momaya, [...] "nor a <b>sleeping</b> <b>mat,</b> nor any wire. Your {{medicine}} was never made. The white jungle god gave me back my Tibo. You {{had nothing to}} do with it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come!" [...] he said, in Japanese {{that was}} {{sufficiently}} similar to modern Nippon {{to be easily}} understood by Barbara Harding. With the word he drew her toward a <b>sleeping</b> <b>mat</b> on a raised platform at {{one side of the}} room.|$|E
50|$|The {{place is}} {{actually}} {{a part of a}} small cave located along the national highway, just across the coastal village. The women explain that they prefer to work in this place because the cool atmosphere makes the tikog less brittle, thus making it easier for them to weave <b>sleeping</b> <b>mats.</b>|$|R
25|$|Hats are woven from {{palm and}} <b>sleeping</b> <b>mats</b> called petates are woven from the fibers of cañita, the Cyperus giganteus, but the primary craft of the Yoko'tan {{people is the}} dugout canoe and its smaller counterpart, the cayuco, which is used for fishing and to reach the many islands used for planting.|$|R
50|$|Workshop section The prisoners {{worked in}} {{workshops}} {{as part of}} their daily routine. The workshops included a carpentry shop, printing shop, a shoemaking and sewing area in which the prisoners made <b>sleeping</b> <b>mats</b> and sewed uniforms. The British used the workshops for external uses such as printing or preparing coffins for British soldiers and policemen.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have come," [...] reiterated Bukawai, [...] "for {{the three}} fat goats, the new <b>sleeping</b> <b>mat,</b> and {{the bit of}} copper wire {{the length of a}} tall man's arm, which you were to pay me for the return of your Tibo." ...|$|E
60|$|The old rascal {{had little}} {{thought of the}} priceless {{treasure}} hidden beneath the Ithaca's clean swept deck as he ordered his savage henchmen up her sides while he lay back upon his <b>sleeping</b> <b>mat</b> beneath the canopy which protected his vice-regal head from the blistering tropic sun.|$|E
60|$|Malbihn and Jenssen rose {{to follow}} him and as they did so their eyes met, and Malbihn slowly drooped one of his lids in a sly wink. Together they {{followed}} Kovudoo toward his hut. In the dim interior they discerned {{the figure of a}} woman lying bound upon a <b>sleeping</b> <b>mat.</b>|$|E
50|$|In Edda, {{as in most}} of Igbo land, {{the cause}} of death also {{influences}} the nature of burial. If death occurred from a noxious disease - such as leprosy, smallpox or some other ailment that cannot be accounted for satisfactorily - the corpse is disposed of hurriedly. Lepers are wrapped in their <b>sleeping</b> <b>mats</b> and dumped in the “bad bush” (Ofia Ojoo).|$|R

5000|$|J. kraussii is {{harvested}} and weaved {{to produce}} traditional <b>sleeping</b> <b>mats,</b> baskets, beer strainers, and other craftwork items in many Zulu areas of South Africa. The plant is in great demand {{because of its}} economic value and has been extensively harvested in the wild. It is now cultivated in many areas and is harvested yearly {{for a period of}} seven years in total.|$|R
6000|$|Bukawai {{shrugged his}} shoulders. [...] "What do I {{know about your}} child?" [...] he asked. [...] "I have not taken him. If he is stolen again, what should Bukawai know of the matter? Did Bukawai steal him before? No, the white jungle god stole him, and if he stole him once he would steal him again. It is nothing to me. I {{returned}} him to you before and I have come for my pay. If he is gone {{and you would have}} him returned, Bukawai will return him--for ten fat goats, a new <b>sleeping</b> <b>mat</b> and two pieces of copper wire the length of a tall man's arm from the shoulder to the tips of his fingers, and Bukawai will say nothing more about the goats and the <b>sleeping</b> <b>mat</b> and the copper wire which you were to pay for the first medicine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come back tonight," [...] said Bukawai, [...] "when {{the moon}} is two hours in the sky. Then will I make the strong {{medicine}} which shall bring Tibo back to you. Bring with you the three fat goats, the new <b>sleeping</b> <b>mat,</b> and the piece of copper wire {{the length of a}} large man's forearm." ...|$|E
60|$|With the hyenas subdued, Bukawai {{returned}} to the baiting of Tarzan; but finding that the ape-man understood nothing he said, the witch-doctor finally desisted. Then he withdrew into the corridor and pulled the latticework barrier across the opening. He {{went back into the}} cave and got a <b>sleeping</b> <b>mat,</b> which he brought to the opening, that he might lie down and watch the spectacle of his revenge in comfort.|$|E
6000|$|... "Meriem!" [...] He {{uttered the}} single word as he hurled himself upon the {{astonished}} Ali ben Kadin. The three Negresses leaped from their <b>sleeping</b> <b>mats,</b> screaming. Meriem tried {{to prevent them}} from escaping; but before she could succeed the terrified blacks had darted {{through the hole in the}} tent wall made by Korak's knife, and were gone screaming through the village.|$|R
50|$|Papyrus sedge (C. papyrus) of Africa was {{of major}} {{historical}} importance in providing papyrus. C. giganteus, locally known as cañita, {{is used by}} the Yokot'an Maya of Tabasco, Mexico, for weaving petates (<b>sleeping</b> <b>mats)</b> and sombreros. C. textilis and C. pangorei are traditionally used to produce the typical mats of Palakkad in India, and the makaloa mats of Niihau were made from C. laevigatus.|$|R
5000|$|The United Nations and {{partners}} {{have so far}} supplied essential non-food items to approximately 200,000 people, whose indispensable household goods {{were lost in the}} destruction. Families received badly needed commodities, such as blankets, pieces of plastic sheeting to serve as shelter, jerry cans for carrying and storing clean water, cooking sets, and <b>sleeping</b> <b>mats.</b> However, it is estimated that many more people will need similar relief over the coming months.|$|R
60|$|Momaya pleaded and threatened, but all to no avail. Finally, {{she turned}} away and started off through the jungle toward the village of Mbonga. How she could get three goats and a <b>sleeping</b> <b>mat</b> out of the village and through the jungle to the cave of Bukawai, she did not know, but that she would do it somehow she was quite positive--she would do it or die. Tibo must be {{restored}} to her.|$|E
6000|$|... "The payment will be ten goats--fat goats--a new <b>sleeping</b> <b>mat</b> and {{two pieces}} of copper wire {{the length of a}} tall man's arm from the {{shoulder}} to the ends of his fingers, and it will be made in advance, the goats being driven to my cave. Then will I make the medicine, and on the second day the boy will be returned to his mother. It cannot be done more quickly than that because it takes time to make such strong medicine." ...|$|E
6000|$|At {{last the}} witch-doctor {{tired of the}} futile chase. With a snarl quite as bestial {{as those of the}} beast, he turned toward Tibo. [...] "I go to collect the ten fat goats, the new <b>sleeping</b> <b>mat,</b> and the two pieces of copper wire that your mother will pay for the {{medicine}} I shall make to bring you back to her," [...] he said. [...] "You will stay here. There," [...] and he pointed toward the passage which they had followed to the chamber, [...] "I will leave the hyenas. If you try to escape, they will eat you." ...|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{after the}} cyclone moved ashore along Mozambique, {{officials}} distributed tents and {{food to the}} affected citizens. The government activated the National Civil Protection Unit to clear fallen trees from roadways, as well as assist in rebuilding damaged or destroyed homes. A {{few days after the}} storm, the Mozambique Red Cross began delivering mosquito nets, blankets, plastic buckets, and <b>sleeping</b> <b>mats.</b> [...] The government of Nampula estimated it would require $8million (USD) to repair storm damage in the province.|$|R
50|$|The {{fast-moving}} host, {{like all}} military formations, needed supplies. These {{were provided by}} young boys, who were attached to a force and carried rations, cooking pots, <b>sleeping</b> <b>mats,</b> extra weapons and other material. Cattle were sometimes driven on the hoof as a movable larder. Again, such arrangements in the local context were probably nothing unusual. What was different was the systematisation and organisation, a pattern yielding major benefits when the Zulu were dispatched on raiding missions.|$|R
60|$|Through {{the opening}} stepped the ape-man, and close behind him came the huge Chulk; but Taglat {{did not follow}} them. Instead he turned and slunk through the {{darkness}} toward the hut where the she who had arrested his brutish interest lay securely bound. Before the doorway the sentries sat upon their haunches, conversing in monotones. Within, the young woman lay upon a filthy <b>sleeping</b> <b>mat,</b> resigned, through utter hopelessness to whatever fate lay in store for her until the opportunity arrived which would permit her to free herself by the only means which now seemed even remotely possible--the hitherto detested act of self-destruction.|$|E
60|$|Momaya was {{dispatched}} for the fire, {{and while}} she was away Mbonga dickered with Bukawai about the price. Ten goats, he said, was {{a high price for}} an able-bodied warrior. He also called Bukawai's {{attention to the fact that}} he, Mbonga, was very poor, that his people were very poor, and that ten goats were at least eight too many, to say nothing of a new <b>sleeping</b> <b>mat</b> and the copper wire; but Bukawai was adamant. His medicine was very expensive and he would have to give at least five goats to the gods who helped him make it. They were still arguing when Momaya returned with the fire.|$|E
6000|$|Bukawai {{opened his}} eyes in well-simulated amazement. [...] "Your baby!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "What should I know of him, other than that I rescued him from the white god of the jungle and have not yet {{received}} my pay. I come for the goats and the <b>sleeping</b> <b>mat</b> and the piece of copper wire {{the length of a}} tall man's arm from the shoulder to the tips of his fingers." [...] "Offal of a hyena!" [...] shrieked Momaya. [...] "My child has been stolen, and you, rotting fragment of a man, have taken him. Return him to me or I shall tear your eyes from your head and feed your heart to the wild hogs." ...|$|E
50|$|Some canoes were 80 ft in length, {{carrying}} 100 men or more. Documents from 1506 for example, {{refer to}} war-canoes on the Sierra Leone river, carrying 120 men. Others refer to Guinea coast peoples using canoes of varying sizes - some 70 ft in length, 7-8 ft broad, with sharp pointed ends, rowing benches on the side, and quarter decks or focastles build of reeds, and miscellaneous facilities such as cooking hearths, and storage spaces for crew <b>sleeping</b> <b>mats.</b>|$|R
50|$|Taking {{about two}} weeks to make the journey, the {{expedition}} encountered hostile tribes along the whole course. Natives followed the boats in canoes, shooting arrows at the soldiers {{for days on end}} as they drifted through their territory. The Spanish had no effective offensive weapons on the water, as their crossbows had long ceased working. They relied on armor and <b>sleeping</b> <b>mats</b> to block the arrows. About 11 Spaniards were killed along this stretch and many more wounded.|$|R
