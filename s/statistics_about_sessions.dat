40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} we {{address the problem of}} {{predicting}} SPARQL query performance. We use machine learning techniques to learn SPARQL query performance from previously executed queries. Traditional approaches for estimating SPARQL query cost are based on <b>statistics</b> <b>about</b> the underlying data. However, in many use-cases involving querying Linked Data, <b>statistics</b> <b>about</b> the underlying data are often missing. Our approach does not require any <b>statistics</b> <b>about</b> the underlying RDF data, which makes it ideal for the Linked Data scenario. We show how to model SPARQL queries as feature vectors, and use k-nearest neighbors regression and Support Vector Machine with the nu-SVR kernel to accurately predict SPARQL query execution time...|$|R
