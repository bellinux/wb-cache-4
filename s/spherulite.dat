5000|$|As {{in metal}} alloys the {{properties}} of a TPO product depend greatly upon controlling the size and distribution of the microstructure. PP and PE form a vaguely crystalline structure known as a <b>spherulite.</b> Unlike metals, a <b>spherulite</b> cannot be {{described in terms of}} a lattice or unit cell, but rather as a set of polymer chains that pack down closely next to one another and form a dense core. The PP and PE components of a blend constitute the [...] "crystalline phase", and the rubber gives the [...] "amorphous phase".|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{polyethylene}} <b>spherulites</b> are classed as negatively birefringent. However, the <b>spherulites</b> with positive birefringence were obtained under the special conditions in our previous reports. When we observe these <b>spherulites,</b> they exhibit the interesting patterns in optical behavior. This paper describes more detailed studies and some suggestive models about the internal structure of these positive <b>spherulites</b> from above-stated experiments and observations...|$|R
40|$|This article reviews {{possible}} {{mechanisms of}} various crack forms and their likely correlations with interior crystal lamellae and discontinuous interfaces in <b>spherulites.</b> Complex yet periodically repetitive patterns of cracks in <b>spherulites</b> are beyond attributions via differences in thermal expansion coefficients, which would cause random and irregular {{cracks in the}} contract direction only. Cracks in brittle polymers such as poly(l-lactic acid) (PLLA), or poly(4 -hydroxyl butyrate) (PHB), or more ductile polymers such as poly(trimethylene terephthalate) (PTT) are examined and illustrated, although for focus and demonstration, more discussions are spent on PLLA. The cracks can take many shapes that bear extremely striking similarity to the ring-band or lamellar patterns in the same <b>spherulites.</b> Crack patterns may differ significantly between the ring-banded and ringless <b>spherulites,</b> suggesting that the cracks may be partially shaped and governed by interfaces of lamellae and how the lamellar crystals assemble themselves in <b>spherulites.</b> Similarly, with some exceptions, most of the cracks patterns in PHB or PTT are also highly guided by the lamellar assembly in either ring-banded <b>spherulites</b> or ringless <b>spherulites.</b> Some exceptions of cracks in <b>spherulites</b> deviating from the apparent crystal birefringence patterns do exist; nevertheless, discontinuous interfaces in the initial lamellae neat the nuclei center might be hidden by top crystal over-layers of the <b>spherulites,</b> which might govern crack propagation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSpherulites are multilamellar vesicles {{consisting}} of concentric shells that can encapsulate small organic molecules or macromolecules. We investigate {{the possibility of}} targeting neutral <b>spherulites</b> to adherent culture cells by functionalizing their surface with RGD-containing ligands. The strength and specificity of association of RGD <b>spherulites</b> with several cell lines (EAhy 926 endothelial cell line, human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) and human osteoprogenitor (HOP) primary cells) was studied, and the molecular interaction of RGD <b>spherulites</b> with the EAhy 926 cell surface was investigated. We show that, after binding to cells, <b>spherulites</b> are internalized...|$|R

It is a liquid crystal material forming cholesteric liquid crystals with helical structure. It forms <b>spherulite</b> crystals.|$|E
50|$|Spherulitic texture is {{the result}} of cooling and {{nucleation}} of material in a magma which has achieved supersaturation in the crystal component. Thus it is often a subsolidus process in supercooler felsic rocks. Often, two minerals will grow together in the <b>spherulite.</b> Axiolitic texture results from spherulitic growth along fractures in volcanic glass, often from invasion of water.|$|E

There, he met his lifelong collaborator, Frank J. Padden Jr. Together, they began to examine the optical properties of spherulites from both theoretical and experimental approaches (see <b>Spherulite).</b>|$|E
40|$|The long-standing issue, {{central to}} polymer science, of the {{relevance}} of cellulation {{to the formation of}} <b>spherulites</b> has been resolved by the first demonstration of this phenomenon, in <b>spherulites</b> of a highly branched polyethylene copolymer. The two principal alternative mechanisms proposed for the formation of <b>spherulites</b> are shown to be complementary, with cellulation a secondary process occurring only when segregation reduces growth rate sufficiently. A unified context for polymeric crystallization is thereby achieved in which segregation generally plays a passive rather than {{an active role in the}} development of <b>spherulites...</b>|$|R
50|$|The size of <b>spherulites</b> {{varies in}} a wide range, from {{micrometers}} up to 1 centimeter and {{is controlled by the}} nucleation. Strong supercooling or intentional addition of crystallization seeds results in relatively large number of nucleation sites; then <b>spherulites</b> are numerous and small and interact with each other upon growth. In case of fewer nucleation sites and slow cooling, a few larger <b>spherulites</b> are created.|$|R
40|$|Calcium {{carbonate}} monohydrate <b>spherulites</b> (similar to 10 (2) mu m diameter) {{with different}} magnesium contents were synthesized from artificial seawater, Stable <b>spherulites</b> are only obtained if [Mg]/[Ca] {{greater than or}} equal to 1 - 1. 3 in the mother solution. <b>Spherulites</b> are surrounded by a skin of similar to 15 mu m thickness, about 5 times richer in Mg 2 + than the bulk and which play a protective role from the stability viewpoint, Etching and crushing experiments were performed which confirm i,a. that the isotropic CO 3 - and CO 2 - radicals are located in the occluded water surrounding the constituent crystallites of the <b>spherulites...</b>|$|R
50|$|When spherulites were rotated {{in their}} plane, the {{corresponding}} Maltese cross patterns did not change, {{indicating that the}} molecular arrangement is homogeneous versus the polar angle. From the birefringence point of view, spherulites can be positive or negative. This distinction depends not on {{the orientation of the}} molecules (parallel or perpendicular to the radial direction) but to the orientation of the major refractive index of the molecule relative to the radial vector. The <b>spherulite</b> polarity depends on the constituent molecules, but it can also change with temperature.|$|E
50|$|Artificial glass {{sometimes}} crystallizes {{and contains}} spherulites {{that may be}} {{as large as a}} marble. As the glass has little similarity in chemical composition to volcanic obsidians, these spherulites when analyzed throw little light on the mineral nature of spherulites in rocks. They show, however, that in viscous semi-solid glasses near their fusion point crystallization tends to nucleate at certain centers and to spread outwards, producing spherulitic structures. Many salts and organic substances exhibit the same tendency, yielding beautiful <b>spherulite</b> crystallizations when melted and cooled rapidly on a microscopic slide.|$|E
50|$|Changes in {{mechanical}} properties of polymers upon formation of spherulites however strongly {{depend on the}} size and density of the spherulites. A representative example {{is shown in the}} figure demonstrating that the strain at failure rapidly decreases with the increase in the <b>spherulite</b> size and thus with the decrease in their number in isotactic polypropylene. Similar trends are observed for tensile strength, yield stress and toughness. Increase in the total volume of the spherulites results in their interaction as well as shrinkage of the polymer, which becomes brittle and easily cracks under load along the boundaries between the spherulites.|$|E
40|$|Melt {{crystallization}} of PEO-b-PCL {{thin films}} was conducted under compressed CO 2 and the morphology of the <b>spherulites</b> obtained at various pressures was investigated by polarizing optical microscopy (POM) and {{atomic force microscopy}} (AFM). At 3 MPa CO 2 classical ring-banded <b>spherulites</b> with periodical twisting lamellae formed. However, in the <b>spherulites</b> with concentric ring-banded structures formed at 5 MPa CO 2, the rings were formed due to periodical variations in thickness along the radial direction...|$|R
40|$|Poly(ethylene terephtalate) (PET) {{crystallization}} {{was shown}} by {{atomic force microscopy}} (AFM) to occur at 85 degreesC {{in the first few}} nanometers near the polymer-air interface. The surface was fully transformed into <b>spherulites</b> after 30 min, while no signs of bulk crystallization were observed by FTIR. All the observed <b>spherulites</b> presented a nucleation centre, indicating that the crystallization process started at the surface of the film. Tapping mode AFM confirmed that the <b>spherulites</b> were not covered by an amorphous layer. The most probable explanation is a decrease of T-g near the surface. Due to the poor crystallization conditions, the constitutive units of the <b>spherulites</b> were;mail crystalline blocks. By changing the annealing time, it was possible to produce PET surfaces with different surface fractions consisting of semi-crystalline material (<b>spherulites)</b> and amorphous matrix. This provided a controlled surface heterogeneity on the submicrometer scale, with a contrast in terms of stiffness, roughness and swelling by organic solvents. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

50|$|Formation of <b>spherulites</b> affects many {{properties}} of the polymer material; in particular, crystallinity, density, tensile strength and Young's modulus of polymers increase during spherulization. This increase {{is due to the}} lamellae fraction within the <b>spherulites,</b> where the molecules are more densely packed than in the amorphous phase. Stronger intermolecular interaction within the lamellae accounts for increased hardness, but also for higher brittleness. On the other hand, the amorphous regions between the lamellae within the <b>spherulites</b> give the material certain elasticity and impact resistance.|$|R
50|$|This effect {{results in}} the dark {{perpendicular}} cones (Maltese cross) and colored brighter regions in between them {{in the front and}} right pictures. It reveals that the molecular axis of the polymer molecules in the spherules is either normal or perpendicular to the radius vector, i.e. molecular orientation is uniform when going along a line from the <b>spherulite</b> center to its edge along its radius. However, this orientation changes with rotation angle. The pattern may be different (bright or dark) for the center of the spherulites indicating misorientation of the molecules in the nucleation seeds of individual spherulites.|$|E
50|$|Very {{large and}} {{cavernous}} spherulites are called lithophysae; {{they are found}} in obsidians at Lipari, in Yellowstone Park and other places. The characteristic radiate fibrous structure is usually conspicuous, but the fibers are interrupted by cavities that are often arranged as to give the <b>spherulite</b> a resemblance to a rosebud with folded petals separated by arching interspaces. Some of these lithophysae are several centimeters or more in diameter. Tridymite, fayalite and other minerals in the lithophysae may be precipitates from the vapor phase that occupied the cavities. The fibers of these coarse spherulites are alkali feldspar (sanidine or anorthoclase) and tridymite.|$|E
50|$|Under the {{microscope}} the spherulites are of circular outline and {{are composed of}} thin divergent fibers that are crystalline as verified with polarized light. Between crossed Nicols, a black cross appears in the spherulite; its axes are usually perpendicular {{to one another and}} parallel to the crosshairs; as {{the microscope}} stage is rotated the cross remains steady; between the black arms there are four bright sectors. This shows that the <b>spherulite</b> consists of radiate, doubly refracting fibers that have a straight extinction; the arms of the black cross correspond to those fibers that are extinguished. The aggregate is too fine-grained to directly determine what minerals it is composed of using visible light microscopy.|$|E
40|$|Shrinkage {{artifacts}} {{in the form}} of series of circumferential bands were observed at the interface in air-cooled glass fibre-reinforced polypropylene specimens. The nature of the circumferential bands was examined and the formation of the bands was explained. Experimental data indicate that unique shrinkage {{artifacts in}} the form of series of circumferential bands formed in some <b>spherulites</b> at the interface of glass fibre/polypropylene pull-out specimens. The circumferential bands are kink bands which form to relieve localized residual stresses in the interfacial surface of the semi-spherical <b>spherulites.</b> The kink bands are parallel to the tangential cross-hatched lamellae in the α form polypropylene <b>spherulites.</b> The kink bands exist preferentially near the outer perimeter of the <b>spherulites</b> where the localized residual stresses are probably highest. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Birefringent ring-banded <b>spherulites</b> with radial {{periodic}} {{variation of}} thicknesses were grown from poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) solutions under conditions {{for which the}} Solution concentration was held constant during the whole development of the morphology. The as-grown ring-banded <b>spherulites</b> were investigated by optical (OM) and atomic force (AFM) microscopies, by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of samples sectioned parallel to the plane of film, and also by electron diffraction (ED) and grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) techniques. The {{results indicate that the}} concentric rings in the birefringent ring-banded <b>spherulites.</b> as well as those in the nonbirefringent ring-banded <b>spherulites,</b> are a manifestation of periodic variation of thicknesses along the radius. The development of the ring-banded <b>spherulites</b> with radial periodic variation of thicknesses is due to periodic diffusion-induced rhythmic growth associated with periodical change in the concentration gradient in polymer solution with constant concentration. The morphological features reflect the competition between the diffusion flux of polymer chains in solution, J, and spherulitic growth with radial growth velocity.

40|$|Abstract. Hydroxyapatite (HA) <b>spherulites</b> {{had been}} {{fabricated}} successfully through {{a novel approach}} including chitin emulsion and geletion processes. The freeze-dried nano-HA powder was firstly dispersed in the chitin solvent before chitin dissolves in its solvent completely. The chitin sol containing nano-HA particles was dropped into oil and emulsified making use of liquids immiscibility effect between oil and chitin sol by stirring. The n-HA/Chitin sol <b>spherulites</b> gelled in situ with the existence of water molecules. Subsequently, the spherular gel granules were rinsed in distilled water to leach the solvent and dried in room circumstance. Finally, special sintering routines were carried to harvest spherular HA granules. The size and porosity of HA <b>spherulites</b> were controlled by the rate of nano-HA to chitin, the chitin concentration in the starting slurry, the stirring rate and the temperature of oil etc. In addition porosifier such as sugar was used in order to adjust the macro- and micro-porous structures in the HA <b>spherulites.</b> The morphological observation showed that the HA <b>spherulites</b> had good sphericity and characteristic microporous structure which were favorable for medical application...|$|R
50|$|Spherulites {{are most}} common in silica-rich glassy rocks. Sometimes they compose the whole mass; more usually they are {{surrounded}} by a glassy or felsitic base. When obsidians are devitrified, the spherulites are often traceable, {{though they may be}} more or less completely recrystallized or silicified. In the center of a <b>spherulite</b> there may be a crystal (e.g. quartz or feldspar) or sometimes a cavity. Occasionally spherulites have zones of different colors, and while most frequently spherical, they may also be polygonal or irregular in outline. In some New Zealand rhyolites the spherulites send branching cervicorn processes (like stags horns) outwards through the surrounding glass of the rock. The name axiolites is given to long, elliptical or band-like spherulites.|$|E
50|$|In polymer physics, spherulites (from Greek sphaira = {{ball and}} lithos = stone) are spherical {{semicrystalline}} regions inside non-branched linear polymers. Their formation {{is associated with}} crystallization of polymers from the melt and is controlled by several parameters such {{as the number of}} nucleation sites, structure of the polymer molecules, cooling rate, etc. Depending on those parameters, <b>spherulite</b> diameter may vary in a wide range from a few micrometers to millimeters. Spherulites are composed of highly ordered lamellae, which result in higher density, hardness, but also brittleness of the spherulites as compared to disordered polymer. The lamellae are connected by amorphous regions which provide certain elasticity and impact resistance. Alignment of the polymer molecules within the lamellae results in birefringence producing a variety of colored patterns, including Maltese cross, when spherulites are viewed between crossed polarizers in an optical microscope.|$|E
50|$|In the {{geologic}} literature, {{the usage}} of the term variole has been inconsistent and confusing. Initially, they were defined as spherical masses, {{which may or may}} not be spherulites, that are observed on the weathering surfaces of some basalts and diabases. In some modern literature, the term variole is defined as a type of <b>spherulite</b> that occurs in a mafic rock. However, because several different mechanisms can produce these small-scale, light-colored, globular to spherical structures, a specific set of varioles may or may not be spherulites that are composed of radiating crystals of either plagioclase or pyroxene. As a result, it is recommended that the term variole should be retained as originally defined. This definition is useful, not only because varioles may arise through several different mechanisms, but also because the alteration, specifically mineralization, and deformation associated with many Precambrian volcanic rocks, particularly Archean volcanic rocks, makes the determination of their origin difficult, if not impossible, without further laboratory analyses. Phillips (1973) provides a detailed review of the nomenclature of different types of varioles that have been proposed. Confusingly, a few Earth scientists use variolite as if it is synonymous with variole.|$|E

40|$|Spherulites are spherical {{clusters}} of radiating crystals that occur naturally in rhyolitic obsidian. The growth of spherulites requires diffusion and uptake of crystal forming components from the host rhyolite melt or glass, and rejection of non-crystal forming components from the crystallizing region.
