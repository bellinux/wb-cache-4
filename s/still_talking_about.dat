[...] Discussing the ratings for EastEnders Live: The Aftermath, controller of BBC Three Danny Cohen appraised: [...] "It is an amazing testament to the EastEnders team and the brave and brilliant drama they provided." [...] Yorke responded to the high consolidated ratings with the statement: [...] "The best birthday present EastEnders could possibly have is to know that 25 years in it can still grab the biggest audience in the UK.

[...] "Fortunately, I arrived just at that moment, picked her up and carried her back to Miss Eagar, who was <b>still</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> Dreyfus," [...] recalled her aunt Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia. Her older sisters objected to including Maria in their games and once referred to Maria as their [...] "stepsister" [...] because she was so good and never got into trouble, recalled Margaretta Eagar in her own memoirs. However, on occasion the sweet-natured Maria could be mischievous. Once, as a little girl, she stole some biscuits from her mother's tea table. As a punishment for her surprising behavior, the governess and Alexandra suggested she be sent to bed; however Nicholas objected, stating, [...] "I was always afraid of the wings growing. I am glad to see she is only a human child." [...] Eagar noted that Maria's love for her father was [...] "marked" [...] and she often tried to escape from the nursery to [...] "go to Papa." [...] When the Tsar was ill with typhoid, the little girl covered a miniature portrait of him with kisses every night.|$|E

[...] For 15-year-old rockers in the white neighborhoods of 1979 Chicagoland, ... the chance to yell [...] "disco sucks" [...] meant more than simply a musical style choice. It {{was a chance to}} push back on a whole set of social dynamics that lied (sic) just beneath the surface of a minor battle between a DJ and a radio station that decided to change formats. More importantly, it was a chance for {{a whole lot of people}} to say they didn't like the way the world was changing around them, or who they saw as the potential victors in a cultural and demographic war.The unplayed second game of the White Sox-Tigers doubleheader remains the last American League game to be forfeited. The last National League game to be forfeited was on August 10, 1995, when a baseball giveaway promotion at Dodger Stadium went awry, forcing the Los Angeles Dodgers to concede the game to the St. Louis Cardinals.

2500|$|An ordinal {{that is both}} {{admissible}} and a {{limit of}} admissibles, or equivalently such that [...] is the -th admissible ordinal, is called recursively inaccessible. [...] There exists a theory of large ordinals in this manner that is highly parallel to that of (small) large cardinals.

[...] But note that we are <b>still</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> possibly countable ordinals here. (While the existence of inaccessible or Mahlo cardinals cannot be proved in Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, that of recursively inaccessible or recursively Mahlo ordinals is a theorem of ZFC: in fact, any regular cardinal is recursively Mahlo and more, but even if we limit ourselves to countable ordinals, ZFC proves the existence of recursively Mahlo ordinals.

2500|$|In 2013 Levy {{published}} an article about what he views as a disgraceful attitude towards African asylum seekers in Israel.

Nor are <b>still</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> a flood of refugees, because the border with Egypt has been closed. So the only explanation for this disgraceful treatment lies in the national psyche. The migrants’ color is the problem. A million immigrants from Russia, a third of them non-Jews, some of whom were also found to have a degree of alcohol and crime in their blood, were not a problem. Tens of thousands of Africans are the ultimate threat." [...] Levy's remarks about Russians produced accusations of racism from such as Eddie Zhensker, executive director of the Russian advocacy NGO Morashtenu, who accused Levy of [...] "brute and coarse prejudices". Immigrant Absorption Minister Sofa Landver demanded that Levy be placed on trial.

There were not many who cared for her, or who spoke of her when gone. Scarcely more than of a nun in a cloister did people know of that pious and gentle lady. A few words among the cottagers whom her bounty was accustomed to relieve, a little talk from house to house at Clavering, where this lady told how their neighbour died of a complaint in the heart; whilst that speculated upon the amount of a property which the widow had left; and a third wondered whether Arthur would let Fairoaks or live in it, and expected {{that he would not be}} long getting through his property,--this was all, and except with one or two who cherished her, the kind soul was forgotten by the next market-day.

All the vast eastern front of Mount Davidson, over-looking the city, put on such a funereal gloom that only the nearness and solidity of the mountain made its outlines even faintly distinguishable from the dead blackness of the heavens they rested against. This unaccustomed sight turned all eyes toward the mountain; and as they looked, a little tongue of rich golden flame was seen waving and quivering {{in the heart of the}} midnight, away up on the extreme summit! In a few minutes the streets were packed with people, gazing with hardly an uttered word, at the one brilliant mote in the brooding world of darkness. It flicked like a candle-flame, and looked no larger; but with such a background it was wonderfully bright, small as it was. It was the flag!--though no one suspected it at first, it seemed so like a supernatural visitor of some kind--a mysterious messenger of good tidings, some were fain to believe. It was the nation's emblem transfigured by the departing rays of a sun that was entirely palled from view; and on no other object did the glory fall, in all the broad panorama of mountain ranges and deserts. Not even upon the staff of the flag--for that, a needle in the distance at any time, was now untouched by the light and undistinguishable in the gloom. For a whole hour the weird visitor winked and burned in its lofty solitude, and still the thousands of uplifted eyes watched it with fascinated interest. How the people were wrought up! The superstition grew apace that this was a mystic courier come with great news from the war--the poetry of the idea excusing and commending it--and on it spread, from heart to heart, from lip to lip and from street to street, till there was a general impulse to have out the military and welcome the bright waif with a salvo of artillery! ...|$|E
