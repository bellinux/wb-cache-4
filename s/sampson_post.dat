2500|$|Talthybius was {{a member}} of Convoy OB 330, which {{departed}} from Liverpool on 2 June and dispersed at sea on 7 June. She was bound for Montreal, Quebec, Canada. She returned with Convoy HX 136, which departed from Halifax on 30 June and arrived at Liverpool on 18 July. Talthybius was carrying general cargo and shells. She also carried the Convoy Commodore, who described the ship as [...] "efficient and well manned" [...] with [...] "a good fighting spirit". She was only able to fly a kite when the wind was from the starboard due to only having one fitting for kites. The commodore recommended that she be equipped to fly kites from both <b>sampson</b> <b>posts.</b>|$|R
5000|$|He {{subsequently}} held other positions. He was prebendary of St Paul's Cathedral in 1570. He became Master of Whittington College. The old College of St. Spirit and St. Mary and almshouse {{set up by}} Richard Whittington at St. Michael Paternoster Royal {{had been}} shut down, first by Edward VI and then for good by Elizabeth, but he lectured there regularly. The spectacular case of Peter Birchet, who wounded John Hawkins in 1573, mistaking him for Christopher Hatton, brought attention to Sampson, since Birchet had heard him preach {{on the morning of}} the attack. Afflicted by bad health, <b>Sampson</b> gave that <b>post</b> up. He was then appointed Master of the Hospital of William de Wygston, at Leicester.|$|R
5000|$|He {{joined the}} USN on September 29, 1943 and was {{assigned}} to Sampson Naval Training Station, New York where he graduated as a signalman from [...] "A" [...] school at <b>Sampson</b> and then <b>posted</b> to the Hawaiian Sea Frontier. When the Navy learned that Ennis {{was associated with the}} Phillies, they assumed he was a Major Leaguer and invited him to fill one of the vacancies while in Honolulu. He was included on the Navy's Western PAC Tour of many Pacific Islands in 1944-1945. Ennis looked very good at the plate in the few exhibition games which immediately preceded the tours. His slugging prompted Dan Topping, new owner of the New York Yankees and a fellow serviceman at Pearl to offer him $25,000 to sign with the Yanks. The Phillies had paid Del only $50 to sign. His naval rank was Petty Officer Third Class. Most of his service was on the island of Guam after the winter tour. Playing with and against Major Leaguers on the tours was equivalent of a minor league apprenticeship for Ennis. After the tours he {{was assigned to}} a fleet recreation billet at Gab Gab Beach on Guam and stayed on the island for one year and did not make it back to the states as soon as some of the others because he did not have enough points built up. He finally returned stateside through San Diego on the USS Wakefield.Ennis was discharged from the Navy on April 5, 1946 and joined the major league Phillies about a week later.|$|R
