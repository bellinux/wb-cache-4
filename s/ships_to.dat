Gibraltar and Athenienne began to lag behind, and Warren, fearing his force would become fragmented, ordered his faster <b>ships</b> <b>to</b> slow down. The French were thus able to escape into the night, the British continuing on a south-east course while they quietly turned north, back to Toulon.|$|E

5|$|By 19:30, the High Seas Fleet, {{which was}} {{by that point}} {{pursuing}} the British battlecruisers, had not yet encountered the Grand Fleet. Scheer had been considering retiring his forces before darkness exposed his <b>ships</b> <b>to</b> torpedo boat attack. He had not yet made a decision when his leading battleships encountered {{the main body of}} the Grand Fleet. This development made it impossible for Scheer to retreat, for doing so would have sacrificed the slower pre-dreadnought battleships of the II Battle Squadron, while using his dreadnoughts and battlecruisers to cover their retreat would have subjected his strongest <b>ships</b> <b>to</b> overwhelming British fire. Instead, Scheer ordered his <b>ships</b> <b>to</b> turn 16 points to starboard, which would bring the pre-dreadnoughts to the relative safety of the disengaged side of the German battle line.|$|E

5|$|On 8 August, Goeben and Breslau met the collier off {{the island}} of Donoussa near Naxos, and two days later they entered the Dardanelles. To {{circumvent}} neutrality requirements, Germany transferred the two <b>ships</b> <b>to</b> the Ottoman Navy on 16 August, though the supposed sale was simply a ruse. On 23 September, Souchon accepted an offer to command the Turkish fleet. Breslau was renamed Midilli while Goeben was renamed Yavûz Sultân Selîm; their German crews remained with the ships and donned Ottoman uniforms and fezzes. The British did not accept {{the sale of the}} <b>ships</b> <b>to</b> the Ottoman Empire and stationed a blockading force outside the Dardanelles with orders to attack the ships if they appeared, regardless of the flag they flew.|$|E

Prior to the departure of the German fleet, Admiral Adolf von Trotha made clear to Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, who was given command of the <b>ships</b> <b>to</b> be interned, that he could not allow the Allies to seize the ships, under any conditions. The fleet rendezvoused with the British light cruiser , which led the <b>ships</b> <b>to</b> the Allied fleet that was to escort the Germans to Scapa Flow.
