In this paper, we explore what conditions might lead to a <b>starting</b> <b>small</b> effect. We report on four artificial grammar learning experiments with human participants. In Experiment 1 A, we found an effect of <b>starting</b> <b>small</b> with visual center-embedded, recursive input staged incrementally. Experiment 1 B replicated this finding and extended the effect to right-branching recursive structure. Finally, in Experiments 2 A and 2 B we found no effect for <b>starting</b> <b>small</b> with auditory center-embedded or rightbranching input. These results suggest that <b>starting</b> <b>small</b> can confer a learning advantage but perhaps only under certain conditions...|$|R

However, most involve the sponsorship of the many religious festivals {{that take place in}} the city. This system {{is one of the more}} complex of its type in the world. Receiving a carga gives the person, called a mayordomo, prestige from the community since he is considered to be working for the common good. Mayordomos can be men, women and even children. The most prestigious carga is to be the mayordomo of the neighborhood's patron saint. This mayordomo receives a certain amount of authority and even a silver scepter along with physical possession of the image. The wives of these mayordomos, carry silver baskets. Even more prestigious than this is to be a mayordomo of a citywide festival which is organized among the neighborhoods. These include the festival of the Virgin of the Remedies, the Fiesta del Pueblo, and events related to Holy Week.|$|E

There is also a clear sign of division of labour between the queens and workers. Upon the death of a queen, workers may sometimes compete and exhibit sexual calling behaviour, which means that workers are able to reproduce in queenless nests. Despite the near-absence of queens, long-range dispersal with winged queens may still be an option.

500|$|Robinson founded E-Tech in 1978, which {{developed}} heat pump technology and high-technology related to energy conservation, energy conversion, and solar energy. When interviewed about E-Tech's founding, Robinson said [...] "I like to pioneer new fields, to <b>start</b> <b>small</b> businesses." [...] E-Tech acquired Scientific Atlanta's Special Products Division, which included staff, research contracts, patented products in solar energy, and specialized equipment. Its first product was an {{electric heat pump}} water heater, the Efficiency II, that reduced water heating bills by 50% and provided an equipment payback of three years. E-Tech worked {{on a range of}} United States Department of Energy contracts in the field of solar energy. In 1986, E-Tech merged with Crispaire Corporation, which specialized in cooling equipment for telecommunications systems, school classrooms, and commercial/industrial structures. The merger resulted in Robinson taking over the new entity, which also operated under the trade name Marvair. Crispaire Corporation/Marvair later joined with RV Products to form a new company, Airxcel, Inc. Robinson retired from this venture in 1997.|$|E

It constituted a nearly 800,000-household drop from the previous week's season premiere, [...] "Pawnee Zoo". The episode received a 1.8 rating/5 share among viewers aged between 18 and 49, the lowest rating for Season Two so far. The Star-Ledger television columnist Alan Sepinwall said although the quality of Parks and Recreations was improving, season two was struggling in the ratings based on the lower quality of the season one episodes. Sepinwall said, [...] "There's a school of thought in the TV business that it's harder to get back viewers who watched and left {{than it is to}} <b>start</b> <b>small</b> and attract new viewers over time." [...] "The Stakeout" [...] received generally positive reviews. Sepinwall said the episode was funny, but also notable because it developed a stronger personal connection between Leslie and Tom, and because it featured more references to topical events like the Henry Gates controversy.|$|E

2500|$|The colony {{cycle of}} D. media is about 3.3 months and occurs between early May {{and the end}} of August. The nests are {{initiated}} in early May when a single queen emerges from her overwintering hibernation site. All queens in the same region tend to emerge from hibernation and initiate nests {{at about the same time}} and do not disperse over weeks or months as in some other species. [...] The queen rears about 10 workers by herself and it takes about 30 days for these workers to mature to adults from eggs. The first workers emerge around early June and <b>start</b> <b>small</b> cell building, where males and workers will be reared, and begin foraging for the colony. The colony continues to grow and large cell construction begins in early July which is where the new queens and some males will be raised. A mature median wasp nest will have about 1000 total cells. Around 320 will be small cells, 680 large cells, with an average of 800 wasps reaching adulthood. The first queens will emerge in early August and disperse to find hibernation sites. The rest of the workers, the old queen, and the males will begin to die off with the colony terminating by the end of August. However, workers are sometimes seen as late as early November.|$|E

2500|$|The largest radio galaxies have lobes or plumes {{extending}} to megaparsec scales (more {{in the case}} of giant radio galaxies like 3C236), implying a timescale for growth of the order of tens to hundreds of millions of years. This means that, except {{in the case of}} very small, very young sources, we cannot observe radio source dynamics directly, and so must resort to theory and inferences from large numbers of objects. Clearly radio sources must <b>start</b> <b>small</b> and grow larger. In the case of sources with lobes, the dynamics are fairly simple: the jets feed the lobes, the pressure of the lobes increases, and the lobes expand. How fast they expand depends on the density and pressure of the external medium. The highest-pressure phase of the external medium, and thus the most important phase {{from the point of view}} of the dynamics, is the X-ray emitting diffuse hot gas. For a long time it was assumed that powerful sources would expand supersonically, pushing a shock through the external medium. However, X-ray observations show that the internal lobe pressures of powerful FRII sources are often close to the external thermal pressures and not much higher than the external pressures, as would be required for supersonic expansion. The only unambiguously supersonically expanding system known consists of the inner lobes of the low-power radio galaxy Centaurus A [...] which are probably a result of a comparatively recent outburst of the active nucleus.|$|E
