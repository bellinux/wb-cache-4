2500|$|In {{quantitative}} proteomics, {{these tools}} primarily analyze bio-markers by quantifying individual proteins, and showing {{the separation between}} one or more protein [...] "spots" [...] on a <b>scanned</b> <b>image</b> of a 2-DE gel. Additionally, these tools match spots between gels of similar samples to show, for example, proteomic differences between early and advanced stages of an illness. [...] Software packages include Delta2D, ImageMaster, Melanie, PDQuest, Progenesis and REDFIN – among others. [...] While this technology is widely utilized, the intelligence has not been perfected. [...] For example, while PDQuest and Progenesis tend {{to agree on the}} quantification and analysis of well-defined well-separated protein spots, they deliver different results and analysis tendencies with less-defined less-separated spots.|$|E
2500|$|In his {{laboratory}} on 2 October 1925, Baird successfully transmitted the first television picture with a greyscale image: {{the head of}} a ventriloquist's dummy nicknamed [...] "Stooky Bill" [...] in a 30-line vertically <b>scanned</b> <b>image,</b> at five pictures per second. Baird went downstairs and fetched an office worker, 20-year-old William Edward Taynton, to see what a human face would look like, and Taynton became the first person to be televised in a full tonal range. Looking for publicity, Baird visited the Daily Express newspaper to promote his invention. The news editor was terrified and he was quoted by one of his staff as saying: [...] "For God's sake, go down to reception and get rid of a lunatic who's down there. He says he's got a machine for seeing by wireless! Watch him — he may have a razor on him." ...|$|E

The PET <b>scan</b> <b>images</b> requires expertise in the segmentation where clustering {{plays an important role in}} the automation process. The segmentation of such images is manual to automate the process clustering is used. Clustering is commonly known as unsupervised learning process of n dimensional data sets are clustered into k groups (k<n) so as to maximize the inter cluster similarity and to minimize the intra cluster similarity. This paper is proposed to implement the commonly used K- Means and Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering algorithm. This work is implemented using MATrix LABoratory (MATLAB) and tested with sample PET <b>scan</b> <b>image.</b> The sample data is collected fro...|$|R

According to the need of rapid data transmission and operation, the AFM control system structure was composed of PC 104 and DSP hardware model. Because of using a large displacement flexure stage as the sample stage, this AFM system is capable of providing a scan range of 100 × 100 um image with 50 Hz line-scan speed. The capacitor displacement sensors are used as x-y position during AFM <b>scan</b> <b>image.</b> We realized a new scanning method based on positioning control.
