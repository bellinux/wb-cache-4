40|$|It was {{suggested}} in the proposal that small particles, due to low inertia, may not impact on the surfaces of the tribocharger. They would, thus, not receive charge {{and would not be}} beneficiated in the electrostatic separation. A milling process was proposed in which the small particles are <b>stirred</b> <b>together</b> with larger carrier beads producing the desired contact charge exchange. A force is necessary for removing the coal particles from the carrier beads. In copying machines electrostatic force is used to pull toner particles away horn iron carrier particles which are held back by magnetic force. Aerodynamic force is used in test instruments for measuring the charge to mass ratio on toners. A similar system of milling and removal is desired for use with the small coal particles. The carrier beads need to be made of copper rather than iron. This complicates the separation process since copper is non-magnetic. We are working on coating of iron beads with a layer of copper. Dr. Robert Engleken of Arkansas State University has supplied us with several test batches of copper-coated iron in the size range of - 40 + 70 mesh. ` We are currently testing whether the milling process used with the copper coated iron beads produces the desired charge on the coal particles...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFriction stir welding (FSW) is {{relatively}} a new welding method where heat generated by friction {{is used to}} forge components together under an axial force. In this method, the generated heat does not exceed the material melting point, instead, the material is heated to its forging temperature and is <b>stirred</b> <b>together</b> by a rotating tool. Since the invention of FSW, this technique has been mainly used for welding aluminium plates together for butt and lap joint configurations. This study is focused on welding lap joint of dissimilar polymers with a new developed tool, in order to evaluate {{the effect of the}} welding parameters on the weld strength. This paper describes the process of developing a stationary FSW tool for welding thin plates of polypropylene and polyethylene. The welds produced with this tool improved the welds surface quality and strength significantly. The use of the proposed tool showed to improve the stability in the axial force magnitude during the welding procedure in comparison with a conventional FSW tool. It was also concluded that the rotational and traversing speed have the most effective role regarding the overall specimen tensile strength.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyse the {{transport}} and stirring of fluid that occurs owing to the formation and growth of a laminar vortex ring. Experimental data was collected upstream and downstream of the exit plane of a piston-cylinder apparatus by particle-image velocimetry. This data was used to compute Lagrangian coherent structures to demonstrate how fluid is advected during the transient process of vortex ring formation. Similar computations were performed from computational fluid dynamics (CFD) data, which showed qualitative agreement with the experimental results, although the CFD data provides better resolution in the boundary layer of the cylinder. A parametric study is performed to demonstrate how varying the piston-stroke length-to-diameter ratio affects fluid entrainment during formation. Additionally, we study how regions of fluid are <b>stirred</b> <b>together</b> during vortex formation to help establish a quantitative understanding of the role of vortical flows in mixing. We show that identification of the flow geometry during vortex formation can aid in the determination of efficient stirring. We compare this framework with a traditional stirring metric and show that the framework presented in this paper is better suited for understanding stirring/mixing in transient flow problems.

40|$|The {{development}} of biomass products {{seems to be}} a near-term alternative to fossil derivatives, which aim to mitigate climate changes. It is therefore necessary to investigate whether biomass technologies are really safe and without environmental impact. This work presents a characterization of the volatiles that are released from biopitch and its polyurethane films. Biopitch was obtained via the distillation of Eucalyptus sp. bio-oil; it was recovered by the condensed smoke that was obtained during slow pyrolylis, which is a process that is used to produce charcoal for the iron-making industry in Brazil. Biopitch and castor oil mixtures, in different proportions, were used as polyols in the polyurethane synthesis. The reactions were carried out when the polyol mixtures were <b>stirred</b> <b>together</b> with polymeric MDI (4, 4 &# 039; methylene diphenyl diisocyanate) NCO/OH = 1. 1 and dibutyltin dilaurate as a catalyst. The films were analyzed by comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography and time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC × GC/TOFMS). The best experimental conditions that permit the identification of 104 volatile organic compounds were determined. Although the analysis was not quantitative, it was possible to conclude that a large content of biopitch led to the release {{of a large number of}} different substances.

40|$|We present new {{electron}} microprobe and Sr-isotope {{analytical results}} from mixing experiments using natural volcanic samples. In order to constrain {{the dynamics of}} such mixing events, we applied a Taylor– Couette flow, simulating forced convection under very low Reynolds numbers, in a time series ranging from 1 h up to 1 week. The end-member melts derive from samples of the Campanian Ignimbrite (CI), in Italy. The CI is thought to represent a layered reservoir formed in 3 stages: 1) a resident phono-trachytic magma reservoir (end-member A); replenished by 2) a less evolved trachybasaltic–trachytic magma (endmember B of trachytic composition); 3) short-term pre-eruptive mixing in the shallow chamber between a new trachytic and the phono-trachytic resident magmas. Our experiments are motivated by this hypothesis. The two end-members are <b>stirred</b> <b>together,</b> under constant low flow velocity (0. 5 rotations per minute). This initially generates single convection cells, which cause progressive homogenization of some major components. This is the case after 1, 4 and 9 h. After 16 h the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr-isotopic system is homogenized and the starting compositions are fully mixed. Then separate convection cells and compositional layering for major and minor elements emerged. Based on microprobe measurements of quenched melts (glass) from the 16 -hour, 25 -hour and 1 -week long experiments, we confirm the separation of layers having different densities. This phenomenon is locally complicated by the production of micro-volumes of unmixed melts. Our results support {{the effectiveness of the}} interplay between convection and diffusion, enhanced by a double-diffusive–convection-driven differentiation for moderately high-silica magmas under high (nearliquidus) temperatures, attesting that differentiation initiates in the liquidus before the onset of fractional crystallization...|$|R
