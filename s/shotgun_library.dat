50|$|Although two {{strains of}} D. lykanthroporepellens have been {{isolated}} and characterized, only the type strain BL-DC-9T {{has had the}} genome sequenced. Therefore, when referring to D. lykanthroporepellens in this section, all information is only verified for BL-DC-9T. D. lykanthroporepellens has a circular chromosome consisting of 1,686,510 bp and a G-C content, based on genomic analysis, of 55.04%. The genome was sequenced using both Illumina and 454 sequencing platforms, more specifically an Illumina <b>shotgun</b> <b>library,</b> a 454 draft library, and a paired end 454 library. Illumina sequence data was assembled and combined with assembled 454 data. Initial assembly contained 64 contigs (a set of overlapping DNA) in 1 scaffold (a set of overlapping contigs with known gap lengths). Genes were annotated {{using a combination of}} automated and manual curation. 1,771 genes were predicted, in which 1,720 were protein-coding genes and 51 were RNAs.

To identify putative promoter sequences, as well as molecular markers that could be useful for breeding programs, one <b>shotgun</b> <b>library</b> was prepared from sweet orange (Citrus sinensis var.

40|$|Background: Bacterial viruses (phages) play a {{critical}} role in shaping microbial populations as they influence both host mortality and horizontal gene transfer. As such, they have a significant impact on local and global ecosystem function and human health. Despite their importance, little is known about the genomic diversity harbored in phages, as methods to capture complete phage genomes have been hampered by the lack of knowledge about the target genomes, and difficulties in generating sufficient quantities of genomic DNA for sequencing. Of the approximately 550 phage genomes currently available in the public domain, fewer than 5 % are marine phage. Methodology/Principal Findings: To advance the study of phage biology through comparative genomic approaches we used marine cyanophage as a model system. We compared DNA preparation methodologies (DNA extraction directly from either phage lysates or CsCl purified phage particles), and sequencing strategies that utilize either Sanger sequencing of a linker amplification <b>shotgun</b> <b>library</b> (LASL) or of a whole genome <b>shotgun</b> <b>library</b> (WGSL), or 454 pyrosequencing methods. We demonstrate that genomic DNA sample preparation directly from a phage lysate, combined with 454 pyrosequencing, is best suited for phage genome sequencing at scale, as this method is capable of capturing complete continuous genomes with high accuracy. In addition, we describe an automated annotation informatics pipeline that delivers high-quality annotation and yields few false positives and negatives in ORF calling. Conclusions/Significance: These DNA preparation, sequencing and annotation strategies enable a high-throughput approach to the burgeoning field of phage genomics...|$|E

40|$|The genomes {{of higher}} {{plants and animals}} are highly differentiated, and are {{composed}} of {{a relatively small number}} of genes and a large fraction of repetitive DNA. The bulk of this repetitive DNA constitutes transposable, and especially retrotransposable, elements. It has been hypothesized that most of these elements are heavily methylated relative to genes, but the evidence for this is controversial. We show here that repeat sequences in maize are largely excluded from genomic <b>shotgun</b> <b>libraries</b> by the selection of an appropriate host strain because of their sensitivity to bacterial restriction-modification systems. In contrast, unmethylated genic regions are preserved in these genetically filtered libraries if the insert size is less than the average size of genes.

Within this 'genomic revolution', the complete genome analysis of environmentally and biotechnologically relevant microorganisms constitutes an emerging field of research. In this context the genome-sequencing project of Azoarcus sp. BH 72 took place. The diazotrophic endophyte Azoarcus sp. BH 72 posses a high biotechnological potential as {{it is capable of}} colonizing the interior of rice roots, {{which is one of the}} globally most important crops. Moreover, since the rice genome is also sequenced, the Azoarcus-rice system represents a great model for bacteria-grass interaction studies. In the present thesis three main topics, from genomics to functional genomic studies, were covered. The aim of the first part of this work was the characterization of an Azoarcus sp. BH 72 bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library as well as the building of a physical map of strain BH 72 chromosome. Both tools were used for an independent analysis of the genome structure in comparison to a <b>shotgun</b> <b>library</b> with small insert sizes, for contig assembly and gap closure of this <b>shotgun</b> <b>library</b> and for genome comparison analysis. The second main objective of this work was the annotation and analysis of a part of the genome sequence. In particular, genes which belong to the COG categories 'Ion Transporters and Metabolism', and 'Carbohydrates Transport and Metabolism', were studied. This analysis revealed several highlights in the genome sequence, particularly in the iron metabolism, which can be used as a starting point in future studies. Finally, in the last part of this work a functional genomic analysis of Azoarcus sp. BH 72 grown under different conditions of N 2 -fixation was performed, using a differential-display proteomic approach. Proteomic patterns of strain BH 72 N 2 -fixing cells, in pure- and co-culture with the endophytic fungus Acremonium alternatum, showed strongly significant differences. The identification of the major proteins showed that the nitrogen metabolism was very active in both conditions, as well as the carbon metabolism, which was adapted to the carbon sources available. Several membrane proteins were identified which most probably are involved in bacteria-fungus interaction, as well as in bacterial response to fungus metabolites.

40|$|Motivation: When {{working with}} non-model organisms, {{few if any}} species-specific markers are {{available}} for phylogenetic, phylogeographic and population studies. Therefore, researchers often try to adapt markers developed in distantly related taxa, resulting in poor amplification and ascertainment bias in their target taxa. Markers can be developed de novo and anonymous nuclear loci (ANL) are {{proving to be a}} boon for researchers seeking large numbers of fast-evolving, independent loci. However, the development of ANL can be laboratory intensive and expensive. A workflow is described to identify suitable low-copy anonymous loci from high-throughput shotgun sequences, dramatically reducing the cost and time required to develop these markers and produce robust multilocus datasets. Results: By successively removing repetitive and evolutionary conserved sequences from low coverage <b>shotgun</b> <b>libraries,</b> we were able to isolate thousands of potential ANL. Empirical testing of loci developed from two reptile taxa confirmed that our methodology yields markers with comparable amplification rates and nucleotide diversities to ANLs developed using other methodologies.
