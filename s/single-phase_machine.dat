40|$|Abstract—A new {{configuration}} of a single-phase induction generator based {{power generation system}} with {{maximum power point tracking}} capability is proposed in this paper, and this configuration is suitable for small-scale variable speed wind energy conversion system. Using this technique, the synchronous speed of the <b>single-phase</b> <b>machine</b> can be adjusted by regulating the frequency of the voltage applied at the auxiliary winding of the motor. Therefore, with variable electrical frequencies the maximum power can be extracted at different wind velocity. The steady-state model as well as the dynamic model of a single-phase induction generator is presented in order to analyze the system characteristics. In addition, a prototype of the system is implemented and tested. The experimental results have been presented and compared with simulation results to validate the peak power extracting capability.

The polyphase machines are developed mainly in the field of variable speed drives of high power because increasing the number of phases on the one hand allows to reduce the dimensions of the components in power modulators energy and secondly to improve the operating safety. By a vector approach (vector space), it is possible to find a set of <b>single-phase</b> <b>machine</b> and / or two-phase fictitious equivalent to polyphase synchronous machine. These fictitious machines are coupled electrically and mechanically but decoupled magnetically. This approach leads to introduce the concept of the equivalent machine (multimachine multiconverter system MMS) which aims to analyze systems composed of multiple machines (or multiple converters) in electric drives. A first classification multimachine multiconverter system follows naturally from MMS formalism.

40|$|Single Phase Induction Machines formthework {{horse of}} various fractional-power {{domestic}} and agricultural {{applications such as}} vacuum cleaners, fans, water pumps etc. They are often designed to be simple, rugged and low-cost. This work is aimed at using these <b>single-phase</b> induction <b>machines</b> for wider applications. A majority of <b>single-phase</b> induction <b>machines</b> are capacitor-start type of induction machines. These machines have two-stator windings {{in space and time}} quadrature. One of these windings is used only to start the machine. The possibility of using this passive winding as an active winding, functional throughout the machine operation, by simply retrofitting a run capacitor, has been discussed in this work. Consequently, this two-phase winding machine has been proposed {{to be used as a}} wind turbine generator coupled with power electronics.

40|$|Single-phase {{induction}} {{machines are}} found in various appliances such as refrigerators, washing machines, driers, air conditioners, and fans. Large concentrations of single-phase induction motor loads such as air conditioners and other motor-compressor loads can adversely impact the dynamic performance of a power system. An understanding {{of the dynamics of}} this type of induction machine is needed to improve {{the current state of the}} art in running power system dynamic studies. In this thesis, a novel approach of modeling an exact fourth-order model of a single-phase induction machine is developed that gives credence to the well-known double revolving-field theory. Using a standard averaging technique, an augmented seventh-order dynamic model is derived using forward- and backward-rotating components. The double-frequency terms causing torque and speed pulsations in the original model can be recovered as a byproduct of the theory. It is proved that two three-phase induction machines with their stator windings connected in series but with opposite phase sequence have the same dynamical behavior as the averaged single-phase induction machine model. The dynamic and steady-state performances of the <b>single-phase</b> <b>machine</b> are investigated using the new augmented model and compared with the exact model...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{the development of}} a single-phase synchronous machine model in time-domain, with instantaneous value output. The model is meant to represent the generator part of the rotary converter used in the Norwegian traction power system (supplying railway). Its function is to convert the 50 Hz frequency of the main grid into 16 2 / 3 Hz which is the standard frequency of the traction grid in Norway. The chosen method of modelling is inspired by previous work on this matter. The solution is to model the <b>single-phase</b> <b>machine</b> by using a standard three-phase machine model, with unsymmetrical loading on two of its phases. The third phase is left idle. The equations of the standard synchronous machine model are used. An adjustment of the parameters is questioned, followed by a suggested set of parameter values on the basis of analysis and mathematical deduction. A comparative approach is used in the validation of the model. Jernbaneverket has done some measurements of the actual rotary converter, which have been compared to simulations of the model. According to these comparisons, the model has proven to reflect the general behavior of the rotary converter. High correlation can be achieved by adjusting the parameters. Nevertheless, no conclusion has been made upon the adjustment of the parameters...|$|E

The two-phase microgrid system presents the following advantages: 1) constant power {{through the power}} line at balanced condition; 2) two voltages available by using a three-wire system; 3) optimized voltage utilization compared to a three-phase system; and 4) a direct connection of both symmetrical two-phase and <b>single-phase</b> <b>machines.</b> Power analysis and symmetrical components {{of this kind of}} microgrid have also been studied through this thesis. Besides the two-phase microgrid system, the hybrid DC/AC microgrid has been analyzed.

At this time all the DC generators were replaced with motor-generators generators. By 1923 there were a total of 20 Babcock water tube boilers, each having a steam capacity of 17,000 lb/hr at 165PSI and 520degF. Smoke was directed into two smoke stacks each 175 feet high.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper studies {{fault-tolerant}} {{operation of}} multipole single-phase switched reluctance generators (SRG’s), in particular, an 8 / 8 -pole switched reluctance <b>machine.</b> The multipole <b>single-phase</b> SRG system is advantageous for reduced cost and higher efficiency compared to polyphase equivalents. However, using the classical phase-leg topology, a phase fault may prevent generating operation completely, since redundancy {{in the number}} of phases does not exist like polyphase systems. A new converter topology which connects two coil banks in parallel is proposed for higher fault tolerance with minimum additional cost. Faulty coils can be disconnected with the proposed converter and the SRG can continue generating operation after coil faults with reduced output power. Output power per coil current under faults is studied. Open- and short-circuit coils are studied through linear analysis, finite-element analysis, and static torque measurement. Generated currents under faults with the proposed converter are measured. The capability of the system to disconnect faulty coils dynamically is also shown.

40|$|Near 160 million {{customers}} in the U. S. A. are served via distribution networks (DNs). The increasing penetration level of renewable energy sources (RES) and plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs), the implementation of smart distribution technologies such as advanced metering/monitoring infrastructure, and the adoption of smart appliances, have changed distribution networks from passive to active. The next-generation of DNs should be efficient and optimized system-wide, highly reliable and robust, and capable of effectively managing highly-penetrated PEVs, RES and other controllable loads. To meet new challenges, the next-generation DNs need active distribution management (ADM). In this thesis, we study the management of PEVs and RES in active DNs. First, we propose a novel discrete-event modeling method to model PEVs and other loads in distribution networks. In addition, a new optimization algorithm to integrate as many PEVs as possible in DNs without causing voltage issues, including the violation of voltage security ranges and voltage stability, is studied. To further explore the active management of PEVs in the DNs, we develop a universal demonstration platform, consisting of software packages and hardware remote terminal units. The demonstration platform is designed with the capabilities of measurement, monitoring, control, automation, and communications. Furthermore, we have studied the reactive power management in microgrids, a special platform to integrate distributed generations and energy storage in DNs.
