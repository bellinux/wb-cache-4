40|$|This article {{provides}} {{a case study}} of the scope of subsidiarity review exercised by the Swedish Riksdag within the Early Warning Mechanism (EWM). It takes its starting point in the theoretical debate on the scope of subsidiarity review reaching the conclusion that the Swedish case confirms both Kiiver’s definition of the scope of the review to include legality and proportionality, and Jancic’s more recent article arguing for a broader review to include substance besides the principle of legality and proportionality. The connection between issues concerning the scope of the review within the EWM and several of the arguments in favour of a reform of the EWM is that national parliaments are not apt to make legal assessments such as a strictly legal approach to the review would suggest. In light of this, the Swedish case is interesting taking into account that the Committee on the Constitution has the task to provide a yearly analysis of the review exercised by <b>sectoral</b> <b>committees,</b> including questions related to method and the outcome of the review on the EU-legislative process. The {{article provides}} a critical assessment {{of the role of the}} Committee on the Constitution within the Swedish scrutiny procedure, reaching the conclusion that the Committee’s evaluation suffers several methodological weaknesses; weaknesses that do effect the impact and efficiency of the Swedish scrutiny process. The Swedish model for scrutiny of subsidiarity within the EWM combines a fully decentralised review by <b>sectoral</b> <b>committees</b> with the yearly ‘helicopter perspective’ offered by the Committee on the Constitution. The primary task of the Committee on the Constitution is to act as protector of decentralisation by identifying creeping competence overstretches. Taken together this could be a strong model of scrutiny within the EWM should the Committee on the Constitution, or whatever body is entrusted with the overall analysis, take is task to provide methodological guidance seriously.

40|$|The {{increasing}} internationalization puts {{new demands}} on national democracy and national parliamentarism. The questions posed in this dissertation are if the parliamentary model for domestic policy or the parliamentary model for {{foreign policy is}} the most relevant when describing {{the role of the}} Swedish Riksdag (parliament) in European Union (EU) matters, and whether there have been any changes during the first ten years of Swedish EU membership. The models can be described as ideal types. National parliaments are strong in domestic policy but weak in foreign policy. Seven dimensions are studied: constitutional regulation, information, participation, influence, accountability, consensus, and time rhythm. The work of the Riksdag on EU matters can be described as follows. The constitutional regulation gives the Riksdag a stronger role than in foreign policy, but the work in the Riksdag is not regulated in the same detail as in domestic policy. The Riksdag receives regular information, and plenty of material is published on the website of the Riksdag, although there are flaws in the information flow which {{are not part of the}} domestic policy model. Many <b>sectoral</b> <b>committees</b> deal with EU matters and the Committee on EU Affairs has consisted of a broad parliamentary elite. The Riksdag follows all EU matters mainly through the Committee on EU Affairs, resulting in conditions which give the Riksdag opportunities to exercise influence. However, the <b>sectoral</b> <b>committees</b> and the chamber do not cover all EU matters, and it is unusual that the Riksdag rejects the position of the government. The government is held accountable through scrutiny by the Committee on the Constitution, oral and written reports after the Council meetings, as well as by questions and interpellations. However, the government is the main source of the information used when it is held accountable. The level of conflict is not particularly high. The Riksdag can not influence the time rhythm of the EU but the Committee on EU Affairs, and to some extent the chamber, have adjusted their schedules to the EU rhythm. Empirically, the role of the Riksdag could have been closer to either model or ideal type than is actually the case. Since EU matters are neither dealt with as foreign nor domestic policy, we can say that we have a new kind of parliamentarism for EU matters, a national EU-parliamentarism. In general terms, this EU parliamentarism is characterized by a stronger role of the Riksdag than in traditional foreign policy but not as strong as in domestic policy. Over time, from 1995 to 2005, there has been a change in all seven dimensions. The Riksdag's work with EU matters has moved closer to the domestic model, i. e. it has strengthened its role. Comparisons with Finland and Denmark show that there are both similarities and differences between the three parliaments.

40|$|In {{their joint}} {{statement}} on the Europe 2020 strategy, the European social partners insist {{on the need to}} include social partners at all levels (European, national, regional and local levels) in the design and monitoring of the reforms in order to guarantee the success of the post Lisbon strategy. At the time of the Lisbon strategy, the social partners were involved in the achievement of the objectives through variable ways. However, it seems that the weight of the social partners on the process was rather limited (Baradel & Welz 2005, de la Porte & Pochet 2003, 2004, Léonard 2005, Gold 2007). In this communication, we will study the specific case of the European sectoral social dialogue (ESSD). Despite many critics (Branch 2005, de Boer et al. 2005, Keller 2003), it seems ESSD has potential to respond to the challenges raised by European integration to the social market economy. Until now, more than 500 joint texts have been adopted by the <b>sectoral</b> <b>committees</b> and 40 sectors have formed an ESSD committee (European Commission 2010). However, this dynamic is undermined by the lack of knowledge the European social partners have about the effective implementation of their joint texts within the national contexts. Those texts are non binding and the European social partners have no means to constrain their affiliates to follow their recommendations. This weakness raises the issue of the legitimacy and the ability of the social partners to handle European issues and {{to be involved in the}} creation of a European social model. Our objective is here to highlight the mechanisms that could favour the implementation of the joint texts within the EU member states and then enable the European social partners to be involved and to weight on the post-Lisbon strategy...|$|R

40|$|Excerpt] In 1998, the European Commission {{set out the}} {{framework}} for <b>sectoral</b> dialogue <b>committees</b> {{with the aim of}} promoting dialogue between sectoral social partners at European level. The committees were set up as the central fora for consultation, joint initiatives and negotiation for the given sectors. Union law does not make reference to the concept of representativeness. The Commission first used this concept in its 1993 Communication concerning the application of the Agreement on Social Policy. Representativeness became the key issue of dispute in a legal case in 1996 (UEAPME v. Council of the European Union, Case T- 135 / 96). UEAPME challenged the legality of the Parental Leave Directive and the dispute became the subject of litigation before the European Court of First Instance (CFI). The CFI asserted that agreements reached through the social dialogue – which are then incorporated into directives – may be challenged on grounds of their democratic legitimacy. CFI deemed this necessary, since the Directive was not subject to scrutiny by the European Parliament. Since this ruling, it has been the legal responsibility of the European Commission to scrutinise to identify the European social partners who are eligible to engage in European social dialogue. In 2006, the European Commission mandated Eurofound to carry out studies on the representativeness of European social partner organisations, with the aim of identifying the relevant national and supranational interest associations in the field of industrial relations in selected sectors. (Prior to 2006, the studies had been coordinated by the Catholic University of Louvain. ...|$|R
40|$|Cet article examine le fonctionnement de quelque dix-sept comités paritaires de {{formation}} professionnelle mis en place aux niveaux local et sectoriel au Québec. La question posée est de savoir si de tels comités paritaires participent d'une évolution des relations du travail davantage axées sur la coopération dans un domaine, celui de {{la formation}} de la main-d’œuvre, normalement exclu du champ de la négociation collective ? Si la réponse est positive {{en ce qui concerne}} les comités sectoriels, au niveau des comités locaux les résultats de l'étude dégagent plutôt trois figures de relations du travail dont la plus importante demeure celle de relations mixtes faites à la fois de coopération et de conflit. This article explores {{the extent to}} which the establishment of joint occupational training committees is contributing to the development of more cooperative labour relations. Quebec, like the rest of North America, has usually been ranked well behind most European countries as regards the establishment of mechanisms of concertation. More recently, however, a number of factors linked to the economie crisis and the coming to power of the Parti quebecois have stimulated the development of mechanisms of concertation. The creation of the Societe quebecoise de developpement de la main-d'oeuvre (SQDM) and the adoption of the Act to Foster the Development of Manpower Training (Loi favorisant le developpement de la formation professionnelle) should, in our view, speed up the establishment of joint occupational training committees. Although it is too early to evaluate their quantitative impact, our study examined seventeen existing committees in order to assess {{the extent to which the}}y have contributed to the development of more cooperative labour relations. The results of our case studies indicate that the context of economie crisis and increased competition has been the principal factor triggering the establishment of joint occupational training committees. The interest of employers in increasing workers' skill levels so as to meet the new requirements of production Systems, such as ISO certification norms, is the counterpart of the unions' search for greater job security. However, at the sectoral level, the objectives are broad (e. g., the establishment of institutional training programs) and are aimed as much, if not more, at training the future work force than those who are already employed. Thus, <b>sectoral</b> <b>committees</b> are generally able to avoid conflicts linked to labour-management relations, whereas at the firm level concertation efforts more often affect the objects of negotiation (e. g., classification, promotions, seniority rights) and may create conflict. Consequently, it is not surprising that the existence of joint occupational training committees does not necessarily go hand in hand with the development of more cooperative labour relations. From our study emerge three general patterns of labour relations, of which the traditional pattern based on a mixture of cooperation and conflict dominates. In only one case out of the thirteen local committees studied were we able to make a direct link between the existence of a joint occupational training committee and the development of more cooperative labour relations. What can be concluded on the basis of seventeen case studies in which, despite the broad context of social change, traditional approaches appear to overshadow innovative ones ? We would argue that a number of adjustments are currently being made that nevertheless fit within the traditional framework of industrial relations in Quebec. More particularly, we would say that, after many years of opposing such change, Quebec unions seem to have agreed to tackle the question of work organization and, as a result, to give greater weight to occupational training within the overall System of job allocation. However, they remain strongly attached to the principle of bureaucratized management of employment based on negotiated rules, especially the seniority principle which remains fundamental. Nevertheless, the situation may still change. In fact, in light of the SQDM's recent Sectoral Initiatives Policy (Politique d'intervention sectorielle), which seeks to encourage the creation of joint occupational training committees, it will be interesting to pursue the present analysis...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} recent (19 April 2012) {{agreement}} on minimum requirements for Standard Players Contracts between UEFA, FIFPro (footballers), ECA (clubs) and EPFL (leagues) concluded {{within the framework}} of the European <b>sectoral</b> social dialogue <b>committee</b> in professional football (SDCPF), installed in 2008. The paper investigates the network of actors that negotiated and concluded the agreement, rather than examining the content of the agreement. The SDCPF constitutes a prime example of a networked governance arrangement at the EU-level in the field of sport. There are clear benefits connected to governance networks with EU involvement in the field of sport, but we can only appreciate those benefits if we make sure that such governance networks are themselves democratic. In this paper, the ‘Democratic Anchorage Model’ by Sørensen and Torfing is adjusted to fit the peculiar form of sport governance networks at the EU-level and reformulated into minimum requirements that were applied to the network of actors within the SDCPF. That enabled us to identify weak spots in the governance network in terms of democratic legitimacy. Hence, we found that overall, the European Commission fulfilled its task as meta-governor of the network very well. Appropriate organisations were included in the network, certain actors were empowered, bi-lateral negotiations were held to reduce tensions, and an indirect amount of (light) pressure was exerted. In particular, the Commission did a great job at empowering FIFPro, which has considerably weaker bargaining powers than EPFL and –especially- ECA. However, the European Parliament and the Council could express their support for the SDCPF more firmly, both formal and informal. More solid reference in those institutions’ Resolutions would legitimise the Commission’s role in the Committee more and could also act as a form of light pressure on the actors to come to agreements, increasing the chances of success for the committee. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Le système québécois de {{formation}} professionnelle a connu des transformations importantes au cours des années 90. La nouvelle articulation institutionnelle de ce système a été traversée par diverses influences politiques et économiques, dont une caractéristique majeure est la participation soutenue des principaux acteurs des relations industrielles. Nous proposons ici une analyse de ce que nous nommons la modernisation du système de formation professionnelle au Québec en retraçant les orientations de départ et leur logique sous-jacente, en identifiant les influences extérieures {{permettant de}} spécifier l’expérience québécoise et en concluant sur les principaux enjeux qui confrontent les acteurs. In the early 1990 s, Quebec undertook to modernize its occupational training system {{through a new}} institutional linkage which entalled a significant and sustained commitment from the principal actors in industrial relations. In so doing, the govemment was responding to two factors : the strategy of its federal counterpart which, by the late 1980 s, had already adopted strategic initiatives {{in the field of}} labour force development; a more generalized trend towards making labour force training and development a key factor in economic development. Thus, the Quebec strategy was both a political and economic response to changes in the competitive environment. Analysis {{of the state of the}} training System at the time largely informed this new policy direction. On the whole, Quebec's occupational training system was weak at all levels. There was no linkage both between public policies either within the govemment or between different levels of govemment; the institutional structure revealed unproductive tensions over the powers and cultures of the various actors; the legislative framework for occupational training had not been modernized since 1969; employer and labour force behaviour (preferences, habits) often demonstrated little commitment to continuous manpower training; joint initiatives on the part of labour market actors were not very widespread, either at the level of the firm or beyond. Thus, as revealed by prevalling actor practices and institutional linkages, a "training culture" did not really exist in Quebec. Drawing on the observation of experiences abroad, the 1991 Policy Statement on Labour Force Development led to an important conclusion : a common training culture is not something that can be decreed or imported, it is an evolutionary social construction which requires active participation and commitment from all the actors. This strategy of developing a "training culture" in Quebec attached great importance to the commitment of union and management actors within new regional, sectoral and national structures. As training was a societal issue, public policy required a form of partnership between union and management actors. Apart from this form of joint regulation, one of the characteristics of the new institutional linkage was the adoption of an act that forces employers to devote a minimum of one percent of their annual wage bill to training. This legislative provision was similar to the practice carried out in France since 1971 as well as in Australia between 1990 and 1994. The Quebec act is still very recent (gradually coming into effect since 1996), and there has not yet been any overall assessment of it. Such an assessment is, however, planned for the year 2000 and will undoubtedly be a crucial moment for the continuation of Quebec's strategy of training management. Our analysis of the 1990 s suggests four trends which have influenced the Quebec occupational training System. A first trend towards joint regulation, derived from neo-corporatism, has led to the establishment of new institutions linking the principal industrial relations actors to the management of public policy. However, the Quebec state has been variable in its support for this form of power sharing, and has, in recent years, reverted to traditional state control, giving rise to criticisms from industrial relations actors. The second trend is characterized by a decentralization which relates to an economic logic of bringing together actors in intermediary structures in order to respond to the issue of training, which is considered a public good. This decentralization, part of a common trend within different industrialized economics, is carried out through regional and <b>sectoral</b> <b>committees</b> for labour force development. The third trend is the legislative guidance which reflects the state's attempt to use the law as a lever to stimulate the development of training in Quebec, while leaving a wide margin of manoeuvre for business actors. The fourth trend relates to the respect for business actors' autonomy in decision-making. Our analysis shows that, while supporting a more coercive intervention, the Quebec state basically sought to convey the message that actors should take charge of continuous manpower training, by recognizing their strategic role in the methods and decisions which are most appropriate to the context of each of the sectors and businesses. In this respect, what mattered most for the state was not the 1 % threshold nor its method of distribution. The act was simply a way to convey the message to the actors that training was henceforth an issue that could not be ignored by business actors and the state considered that these actors were in the best position to make decisions about what actions should be taken. In this sense, the aim of the act is to influence the behaviour of actors and not to supersede their own internai decision-making processes (whether they are employers, workers or their representatives). In our view, it is precisely the actors' autonomy or maturity in developing a "training culture" which will, in a way, be tested during the forthcoming public debates on training in Quebec. One thing is certain, the present economic environment does not in any way suggest that labour force training is no longer an economic development issue. It will be impossible for the actors to ignore this fact in future assessments of Quebec public policy on occupational training.

La nueva articulaciòn institucional de este sistema a sido traveseada de multiples influencias politicas y econòmicas, de las que una de las caracteristicas mayores es la participaciòn sostenida de los actores principales de las relaciones industriales. Nosotros proponemos aquì un anàlisis de lo que nombramos como la modernizaciòn del sistema de formaciòn profesional en Québec al retrasar las orientaciones del comienzo y su lògica sobre entendida, al identificar las influencias exteriores que permitieron especificar la experiencia quebequense y al concluir sobre los principales desafìos que confrontaban los actores...|$|R
40|$| {{outlined}} in the various chapters of this report are aimed at changing the context for performance verification in that they concern the parameters for performance verification {{as set out in}} the national agreement. The main recommendations in this regard are: · More focus on a limited number of priority modernisation agenda items is needed. The specification of these items in the modernisation agenda is important in that the degree to which expectations are set out determines {{the extent to which they}} can subsequently be assessed. · The extent to which the performance verification process can deal with significant change initiatives arising during the course of the agreement but not covered by the agreement needs to be determined. · The backdating of pay awards in all cases of deferred pay increases has caused some discontent with the process in some cases. The extent to which backdating should apply automatically should be an issue for discussion. · If possible in the context of the agreement on pay increases, the frequency of progress reporting should be restricted to every six months. · The role of <b>sectoral</b> partnership <b>committees</b> should be clarified with regard to their part in signing off on action plans and assessing organisational progress reports. · The additional burden imposed on reporting by the parallel benchmarking process should be addressed. Performance verification structures and processes There is wide support for the broad structures and processes that have been put in place to manage performance verification. Recommendations {{outlined in}} this report are aimed at enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of these structures and processes. The main recommendations in this regard are: Performance verification groups · The current structure and composition of the PVGs be broadly maintained, with an independent chair and a small number of management, union and independent representatives. · With regard to independent members, to the extent possible there should be some continuity of membership between one agreement and the next, and some turnover to ensure ‘new blood’ is brought to the process. · Independent members should be selected on the basis that they can take a broad perspective on the sector and the process, rather than chosen for a detailed knowledge of any particular issue. · Existing decision-making procedures and practices should be maintained. · Site visits/presentations should continue to receive a high priority by the PVGs as an aid to informing the process beyond the formal exchange of reports. To get the most from site visits/presentations, clear agendas for the meetings are required, along with the opportunity for informal feedback from the PVGs. · With regard to feedback from PVGs to organisations generally, to the extent possible feedback should combine sector-wide comments with individualised comments targeted at individual organisations. · PVGs should consider the identification and highlighting of good practice exemplars in their decision letters, to promote the spread of good practice across the sector. · The Health Service PVG approach of clearly specifying decisions available to them has merit and should be considered by all PVGs. The ‘payment warranted but with qualification’ option allows a further level of sanction to be applied in the process. PVG secretariat · The PVG secretariats should continue to develop their research and communications roles (acting as a conduit between the PVG and organisations), alongside their administrative role. · Secretariats should ensure that websites containing information on the performance verification process are up-to-date and comprehensive in the scope of information contained on the site. Sectoral secretary general · The overview report of the secretary general to the PVG should continue to be developed to highlight key issues of industrial relations and modernisation changes. Education PVG · The operation of the performance verification process in the education sector should be assessed to determine if alternative procedures might lead to improvements in reporting procedures. Alternatives to consider may include the provision of separate PVGs for different education levels and/or sectors. Performance verification outputs There is general support for the principle of action plans and progress reports continuing to form the basis for decisions on performance verification and to be the main outputs of the process. The recommendations in this report are aimed at simplifying the planning and reporting process so as to meet the needs of a modernisation and change agenda without imposing undue burdens on all participants. The main recommendations in this regard are: Templates · A template should be retained as a means of ensuring consistency and encouraging comparison across action plans and progress reports. The recommendation that the modernisation agenda allow organisations to prioritise a limited number of key modernisation agenda items will facilitate less onerous reporting requirements. · The template should place an emphasis on reporting progress since the last report was received rather than whether or not a commitment has been achieved. Action plans · Action plans should focus on a limited number of priority modernisation agenda items. · The action plan should contain both a small number of sectoral modernisation initiatives and a small number of organisation specific initiatives. · The PVG should devote particular attention to the scrutiny of action plans, as the basis for subsequent reporting. In particular, the specificity and clarity of objectives and targets set out in the action plans should be assessed, as the clearer and more specific the objectives and targets, the easier progress in their achievement can be determined. · The primary focus of action plans should remain on the outputs produced as a result of the modernisation agenda (though subsequent reporting should reflect progress on reporting on outcomes). · Action plans should clearly reflect the relevant objectives of the organisation as set out in the business plan. The modernisation agenda should not be seen as a separate exercise from the day-to-day running of the organisation. Progress reports · Context statements should continue to be produced by all organisations, highlighting priority issues and enabling flexibility of response of organisations. Consideration should be given to the possibility of using context statements as the reporting mechanism in all phases, with annual reporting against the template. · More focus should be given to reporting on a smaller number of well-specified modernisation items in any individual progress report. · Progress reports should contain information on both outputs achieved against expectations, and progress in relation to reporting on outcomes. The main focus should be on progress made since the last period...|$|R
