40|$|A shelf is a {{set with}} a binary {{operation}} satisfying a (b c) = (a b) (a c). Racks are shelves with invertible translations b a b; many of their aspects, including cohomological, are better understood than those of general shelves. Finite monogenic shelves (FMS), of which Laver tables and cyclic racks are the most famous examples, form a remarkably rich family of structures and {{play an important role}} in set theory. We compute the cohomology of FMS with arbitrary coefficients. On the way we develop general tools for studying the cohomology of shelves. Moreover, inside any finite shelf we identify a <b>sub-rack</b> which inherits its major characteristics, including the cohomology. For FMS, these sub-racks are all cyclic...|$|E
40|$|Recent trends to pack {{data centers}} with more CPUs per rack {{have led to}} a {{scenario}} in which each individual rack may contain hundreds, or even thousands, of compute nodes us-ing system-on-chip (SoC) architectures. At this increased scale, traditional rack-level star topologies with a top-of-rack (ToR) switch as the hub and servers as the leaves are no longer feasible in terms of monetary cost, physical space, and oversubscription. We propose Theia, an architecture to connect hundreds of SoC nodes within a rack, using inex-pensive, low-latency, hardware elements to group the rackâ€™s servers into subsets which we term SubRacks. We then re-place the traditional per-rack ToR with a low-latency, pas-sive, circuit-style patch panel that interconnects these <b>Sub-Racks.</b> We explore alternatives for the rack-level topology implemented by this patch panel, and we consider approaches for interconnecting racks within a data center. Finally, we in-vestigate options for routing over these new topologies. Our proposal of Theia is unique in that it offers the flexibility of a packet-switched networking over a fixed circuit topology...|$|R

40|$|Microgravity {{scientific}} research is performed in space {{to determine the}} effects of gravity upon experiments. Until recently, experiments had to accept the environment aboard various carriers: reduced-gravity aircraft, sub-orbital payloads, Space Shuttle, and Mir. If the environment is unacceptable, then most scientists would rather not expend the resources without the assurance of true microgravity conditions. This is currently the case on the International Space Station, because the ambient acceleration environment will exceed desirable levels. For this reason, the g-LIMIT (Glovebox Integrated Microgravity Isolation Technology) system is currently being developed to provide a quiescent acceleration environment for scientific operations. This <b>sub-rack</b> isolation system will provide a generic interface for a variety of experiments for the Microgravity Science Glovebox. This paper describes the motivation for developing of the g-LIMIT system, presents the design concept and details some of the advanced technologies utilized in the g-LIMIT flight design...|$|E

40|$|For many {{microgravity}} science {{experiments in}} the International Space Station, the ambient acceleration environment will be exceed desirable levels. To provide a more quiescent acceleration environment to the microgravity payloads, a vibration isolation system named g-LIMIT (GLovebox Integrated Microgravity Isolation Technology) is being designed. g-LIMIT is a <b>sub-rack</b> level isolation system for the Microgravity Science Glovebox that can be tailored {{to a variety of}} applications.

In addition, this system provides the unique capability for measuring quasi-steady acceleration of the experiment independent of accelerometers as a by-product of the control system and will have the capability of generating user-specified pristine accelerations to enhance experiment operations...|$|E
40|$|Abstractâ€”Shared-nothing environments, {{exemplified}} by sys-tems such as MapReduce and Hadoop, employ node-local storage to achieve high scalability. The exponential growth in application datasets, however, demands ever higher I/O throughput and disk capacity. Simply equipping individual nodes in a Hadoop cluster with more disks is not scalable as it: increases the per-node cost, increases {{the probability of}} storage failure at the node, and worsens node failure recovery times. To this end, we propose dividing a Hadoop rack into several (small) sub-racks, and consolidating disks of a sub-rackâ€™s compute nodes into a separate shared Localized Storage Node (LSN) within the <b>sub-rack.</b> Such a shared LSN is easier to manage and provision, and can offer an economically better solution by employing overall fewer disks at the LSN than the total of the sub-rackâ€™s individual nodes, while still achieving high I/O performance. In this paper, we provide a quantitative study {{on the impact of}} shared storage in Hadoop clusters. We utilize several typical Hadoop applications and test them on a medium-sized cluster and via simulations. Our evaluation shows that: (i) the staggered workload allows our design to support the same number of compute nodes at a comparable or better throughput using fewer total disks than in the node-local case, thus providing more efficient resource utilization; (ii) the impact of lost locality can be mitigated by better provisioning the LSN-node network interconnect and the number of disks in an LSN; and (iii) the consolidation of disks into an LSN is a viable and efficient alternative to the extant node-local storage design. Finally, we show that LSN-based design can deliver up to 39 % performance improvement over standard Hadoop. I...|$|E
40|$|The International Space Station {{was mainly}} thought as an {{orbiting}} research laboratory and, as such, it comprises several resources to test and validate {{new technologies to}} be used in future space missions. This paper presents the design and development of Thermal Exchange, a microgravity experiment that aims at on-orbit validation of low-toxicity heat pipe performance for thermal control of future spacecraft, both manned and unmanned. Tendency for future space systems points towards simplicity, limited maintenance needs and high reliability. In particular, vehicle thermal control should be based on passive systems, requiring low maintenance and very limited remote control. Accordingly, heat-pipes are good candidates for future spacecraft thermal control, due to their low complexity and maintenance requirement, as well as their high reliability. In this scenario, Thermal Exchange aims at the development of a payload for the demonstration, in microgravity conditions, of heat pipes and low toxicity working fluids, which would make it compatible with human applications (habitable modules) as well. Thermal Exchange is a <b>sub-rack</b> payload that will be operated inside the Microgravity Science Glovebox (MSG) on-board the International Space Station (ISS). Thermal Exchange consists of a main housing that accommodates the experiment and the avionics containers: the experiment container includes four axially grooved heat pipes filled with low-toxicity working fluids and mixtures, whereas the avionics container encloses three electronic boards to perform power management and distribution, health management and on-board data handling autonomously once on-board the ISS. Thermal Exchange will be launched with the Space-X 9 launch vehicle inside a half CTB (Cargo Transfer Bag). Thermal Exchange will be uninstalled and stowed {{at the end of the}} on-orbit operations and will re-enter with the Space-X 10 vehicle. This paper first provides a general overview of Thermal Exchange and the project schedule, including the operations to be carried out on the ISS. Then, it deals with the design and development of the ground and flight models. Main results are presented and discussed. Eventually main conclusions are draw...|$|E
40|$|The {{mission of}} the International Space Station {{is to provide a}} working {{laboratory}} in orbit for research in engineering, life sciences, and microgravity. Among the microgravity disciplines that are preparing to utilize this international resource are materials processing, combustion, fluid dynamics, biotechnology, and fundamental physics. The Station promises to enable significant advances in each of these areas by making available a research facility in which gravitational and other accelerations, and their corresponding buoyancy and diffusion effects on various physical processes, are orders of magnitude lower than they are on Earth. In order to fulfill this promise, it is not enough for the Space Station to simply replicate a typical terrestrial scientific laboratory in orbit. Although an orbiting laboratory is free of most of the effects of gravitational acceleration by virtue of its free fall condition, it also produces structural vibration or jitter that can interfere with the processes under study. To ensure the quality of the acceleration environment and enable a successful mission, the Space Station Program has limited potential disturbances in two ways: first, by isolating the most sensitive payloads from the vehicle structure, and second, by quieting major disturbances at their sources. The first area, payload isolation, is implemented inside the pressurized modules at the rack level. <b>Sub-rack</b> level isolators have also been developed. This paper addresses the second area, disturbance source limits, for one of the major sources of mechanical noise on the Space Station: the Solar Alpha Rotary Joints. Due to the potential for large disturbances to the microgravity environment, an initial analytical prediction of rotary joint vibration output was made. Key components were identified and tested to validate the analytical predictions. Based on the component test results, the final vibration output of the joints was verified by a test on each fully assembled flight unit. This paper describes the Space Station microgravity requirements, the rotary joint hardware, and the disturbance producing aspects of joint operation. The test setup, instrumentation, test conditions, and results for the component level and system level measurements are described. An overall forcing function that describes the maximum torque imparted to the Station is created based on the test results, and these disturbances are shown to meet the applicable Space Station microgravity requirements...|$|E
