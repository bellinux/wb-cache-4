40|$|Abstract Flake and <b>spheroidal</b> <b>graphite</b> cast <b>irons</b> {{with similar}} {{composition}} {{were subjected to}} high temperature oxidation to investigate graphite morphology and distribution effects on the oxidation behavior. High temperature oxidation tests were conducted between 400 and 750 C in air. For comparison low carbon steel was also tested. Graphite morphology obviously affected high-temperature oxidation resis-tance. The flake <b>graphite</b> cast <b>iron</b> exhibited the worst high-temperature oxidation resistance compared with <b>spheroidal</b> <b>graphite</b> cast <b>iron.</b> Since <b>graphite</b> flakes provide suitable sites for the iron oxide growth and are almost interconnected, the iron oxide grows faster and penetrates along the graphite flakes boundaries resulting in the subsurface oxidation. Due to the severe subsurface oxidation flake <b>graphite</b> cast <b>iron</b> parabolic rate constants are five times {{higher than that of}} the <b>spheroidal</b> <b>graphite</b> cast <b>iron.</b> However, <b>spheroidal</b> <b>graphite</b> cast <b>iron</b> parabolic rate constants and oxide layer thickness {{are similar to those of}} the low carbon steel.

50|$|Open face TBMs in {{soft ground}} {{rely on the}} fact that the face of the ground being {{excavated}} will stand up with no support for a short period of time.

40|$|Bibliography: pages 85 - 89. A {{study has}} been made of the unlubricated sliding wear {{behaviour}} of austempered ductile irons under conditions of sliding velocity and load. The load was varied between 0. 9 and 2. 8 MPa, whilst the sliding velocity range was between 0. 5 and 2. 0 ms⁻¹. Two commercial grades of <b>spheroidal</b> <b>graphite</b> <b>irons,</b> SG 42 and SG 60 were austempered between 250 ⁰C and 400 ⁰C. A distinction in the wear behaviour was found with metallic type wear dominating at the lower sliding velocities and an oxidative type wear being evident at the higher sliding velocities. It was however found that an increase in the load resulted in an earlier onset of the oxidative type wear regime, for a specific sliding velocity. On austempering these <b>spheroidal</b> <b>graphite</b> <b>irons</b> the mechanical properties as well as the sliding wear resistance increased dramatically. Furthermore, the austempered irons' outperformed a series of steels of much higher hardness by factors between 2 and 28 times under the same conditions. At the lower velocity of testing the outstanding wear resistance is attributed to the austempered iron's unique microstructure of acicular ferrite and retained austenite and a partial transformation of austenite to martensite. However, at the higher sliding velocity the exceptional wear resistance is derived from a development of an tribologically protective oxide film together with the formation of a hardened white layer. The development of the work hardened layer is linked to the high carbon in the matrix of these irons. The work hardened layer leads to a similar wear rate prevailing for all irons austempered from a specific parent iron. The synergism of variation in load, sliding velocity and wear counterface together with the effect of initial microstructure has been explain in terms of simple wear models...|$|R
