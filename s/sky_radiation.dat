25|$|Diffuse <b>sky</b> <b>{{radiation}}</b> is {{solar radiation}} reaching the Earth's surface {{after having been}} scattered from the direct solar beam by molecules or suspensoids in the atmosphere. It is also called skylight, diffuse skylight, or <b>sky</b> <b>radiation</b> and {{is the reason for}} changes in the color of the sky. Of the total light removed from the direct solar beam by scattering in the atmosphere (approximately 25% of the incident radiation when the sun is high in the sky, depending on the amount of dust and haze in the atmosphere), about two-thirds ultimately reaches the earth as diffuse <b>sky</b> <b>radiation.</b> When the sun is at the zenith in a cloudless sky, with 1361W/m2 above the atmosphere, direct sunlight is about 1050W/m2, and total insolation about 1120W/m2. This implies that under these conditions the diffuse radiation is only about 70W/m2 out of the original 1361W/m2.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Infrared scene {{simulation}} is {{an important}} issue in the military field. Infrared scene simulation system can reproduce and simulate the infrared radiation characteristics of target and its background. Therefore, the analysis of the infrared radiation of target and scene features is very important for Infrared scene simulation. In this paper, we focus on the calculation and analysis of typical environmental factors of ground targets, including solar <b>radiation,</b> <b>sky</b> atmosphere <b>radiation</b> and ground radiation etc [...] We also discuss how to calculate the infrared radiation of target in this paper. The results of this paper will be used for analysis of the infrared radiation and the simulation of the infrared scene of ground targets...|$|R

2500|$|Direct and diffuse {{components}} of solar radiation are calculated separately (see Earth's radiation balance). [...] Direct radiation is calculated as {{the sum of}} all direct (solar beam) radiation originating from visible (non-obscured) sky directions along the path of the sun. [...] Similarly, diffuse solar radiation is calculated as {{the sum of all}} diffuse radiation (scattered from the atmosphere) originating from any visible (non-obscured) sky directions (see diffuse <b>sky</b> <b>radiation).</b> [...] The sum of direct and diffuse components gives global radiation.|$|E
2500|$|There is {{essentially}} no direct sunlight under an overcast sky, so all light is then diffuse <b>sky</b> <b>radiation.</b> The flux of light {{is not very}} wavelength dependent because the cloud droplets are larger than the light's wavelength and scatter all colors approximately equally. The light passes through the translucent clouds {{in a manner similar}} to frosted glass.

40|$|The diffuse {{radiation}} incident on an inclined plane {{is composed of}} both the ground-reflected <b>radiation</b> and the <b>sky</b> diffuse <b>radiation.</b> The evaluation of the <b>sky</b> diffuse <b>radiation</b> has already been described in many references. In this paper {{we focus on the}} ground-reflected radiation, its relation to insolation conditions and its evaluation by means of models. We used six data banks from the following four countries: Switzerland, France, The Netherlands, and the U. S. A. We investigated how the albedo depends on the amount and the composition of the incident radiation, on geometrical parameters such as the height and/or the azimuth of the sun and on meteorological parameters such as the humidity. We did not find any notable dependence. We also tested different models evaluating the ground-reflected radiation on tilted planes with corresponding measurements on an inverse horizontal plane (facing the ground) and on inclined planes. We came to the conservative conclusion that the best results are obtained when using a constant averaged measured albedo, for transposition to tilted surfaces, when assuming the ground-reflected radiation to be isotropic...|$|R
50|$|Sectional: the {{structure}} is divided into usually two sections with insulators between, usually center-fed. This collinear arrangement enhances low-angle (ground wave) radiation and reduces high-angle (<b>sky</b> wave) <b>radiation.</b> This increases {{the distance to the}} mush zone where the ground wave and sky wave are at similar strength at night. This type of antenna is known as an anti-fading aerial. Practical sectionals with 120 over 120 degrees, 180 over 120 degrees and 180 over 180 degrees are presently in operation with good results.|$|R

25|$|The cosmic {{microwave}} background radiation is an emission of uniform, black body thermal energy coming {{from all parts of}} the <b>sky.</b> The <b>radiation</b> is isotropic to roughly one part in 100,000: the root mean square variations are only 18 ÂµK, after subtracting out a dipole anisotropy from the Doppler shift of the background radiation. The latter is caused by the peculiar velocity of the Earth relative to the comoving cosmic rest frame as the planet moves at some 371km/s towards the constellation Leo. The CMB dipole as well as aberration at higher multipoles have been measured, consistent with galactic motion.|$|R

Overall, results of this dissertation provided a better prediction method for <b>sky</b> long wave <b>radiation</b> exchange with a buildingâs roof {{and the impact of}} dust accumulation on energy use, especially for poorly and uninsulated residential buildings. The two most significant results for this study were (1) a new absorptivity model was introduced in an effort to relate a buildingâs exterior roof solar and thermal properties (absorptivity, reflectivity, and emissivity) to monthly averaged dust accumulation, and (2) a new dusty sky temperature model was introduced as a function of atmospheric aerosol optical depth to better account for dust impact on sky temperature prediction...|$|R
40|$|A serious {{obstacle}} to the large-scale terrestrial application of solar energy lies in the scarcity of reliable data {{on the amount of}} solar energy at candidate converter sites. This paper describes a system designed to monitor and record, automatically, the values of the direct and total (sun and <b>sky)</b> solar <b>radiation</b> which would be seen by either tracking or fixed-type solar converters. A further pressing need addressed by the system is the means for efficiency testing and evaluation of solar cells, solar collectors and solar concentrator systems, under outdoor exposure to natural sunlight and weather conditions for extended periods.

50|$|Daylight, or {{the light}} of day, is the {{combination}} of all direct and indirect sunlight during the daytime. This includes direct sunlight, diffuse <b>sky</b> <b>radiation,</b> and (often) both of these reflected by the Earth and terrestrial objects, like landforms and buildings. Sunlight scattered or reflected by objects in outer space (that is, beyond the Earth's atmosphere) is generally not considered daylight. Thus, daylight excludes moonlight, despite it being indirect sunlight. Daytime is {{the period of time}} each day when daylight occurs. Daylight happens because Earth rotates, and either side on which the Sun shines is considered daylight.|$|E
50|$|Physical changes {{resulting}} {{from exposure to}} the environment are initiated by chemical bond breaking reactions caused by the absorbed light, either through direct or indirect processes. Chemical bond breaking is a prerequisite to any chemical reaction, and chemical reactions are a prerequisite to observable or measurable physical changes. Other weather factors mainly promote weathering through their influence on the secondary reactions which follow the breaking of bonds. Degradation of most materials exposed to outdoor conditions is caused mainly by UV degradation - the ultraviolet portion of solar energy, with the shortest wavelengths often having the greatest effect. Therefore, variations in both {{the quantity and quality}} of ultraviolet in both the direct solar beam and diffuse <b>sky</b> <b>radiation</b> are important factors in the design and evaluation of weathering tests.|$|E
50|$|The {{experiment}} {{consists of}} two instruments, COSMO15 (three channels at 12.7, 14.7 and 16.3 GHz) and COSMO11 (two hands of linear polarization at 10.9 GHz).

These antennas focus the radiation on to cryogenically cooled HEMT-based receivers, both at an operating temperature of 20K (-253 C) and in the frequency range of 10-12 GHz for COSMO11, and 12-18 GHz for COSMO15. In the COSMO15 instrument, the signal is split by a set of three filters, allowing simultaneous observations at 13, 15 and 17 GHz. Thus, four 1-degree resolution sky maps complete in right ascension and covering 20 degrees in declination are obtained every day at these frequencies.|$|E
