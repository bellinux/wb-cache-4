40|$|We give a <b>scenario-based</b> {{treatment}} <b>plan</b> optimization formulation that {{is equivalent}} to planning with geometric margins if the scenario doses are calculated using the static dose cloud approximation. If the scenario doses are instead calculated more accurately, then our formulation provides a novel robust planning method that overcomes many of the difficulties associated with previous <b>scenario-based</b> robust <b>planning</b> methods. In particular, our method protects only against uncertainties that can occur in practice, it gives a sharp dose fall-off outside high dose regions, and it avoids underdosage of the target in ``easy'' scenarios.

40|$|June 2010 The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{document}} and critique a <b>scenario‐based</b> strategic <b>planning</b> initiative that was undertaken by the USACE Civil Works Program from 2006 to 2007. Scenario planning is a technique designed to help organizations develop strategies that are robust, i. e. effective in a wide range of future conditions. The objectives of USACE’s <b>scenario‐based</b> strategic <b>planning</b> exercise were twofold: 1) to foster strategic thinking in the organization; and 2) to produce a strategic plan that accounts for future uncertainties. While the Strategic Plan was intended to cover a five‐year period, the scenario planning effort adopted a 30 ‐year time horizon to develop strategies and actions which would prepare the organization for long‐term success. This paper will introduce and discuss scenario analysis in general, describe the specific approach used by USACE, and then provide details of the process and products generated at each step.

40|$|This thesis {{covers the}} {{development}} of a change navigation-based scenario planning process (CNBSPP) applicable to a Developing World and Afrocentric Leadership context. Life in organisations involves a continual series of disruptive and disorienting changes. Existing theories and practices often become obsolete under hyper-turbulent circumstances. Traditional analytical planning usually takes a linear approach assuming that tomorrow will be similar to today. This approach works well in a stable environment, but fails when discontinuous events throw existing planning models into disarray. <b>Scenario-based</b> <b>planning</b> as a building block for strategic conversations offers great value over other strategic planning processes when uncertainty is high. Companies operating {{in the midst of a}} changing business environment require the application of <b>scenario-based</b> <b>planning</b> and organisational change navigation in some form or other. These two disciplines are currently practised independently of each another. The random borrowing of a Developed World planning practice such as <b>scenario-based</b> <b>planning</b> from one context to another without ensuring contextual validity is a high-risk event. An appropriate process integrating <b>scenario-based</b> <b>planning</b> and organisational change navigation, which is embedded in a Developing World and Afrocentric Leadership context, is currently non-existent. This research promotes a combined approach to <b>scenario-based</b> <b>planning</b> and organisational change navigation, which needs to be applied in a particular context. Stories (or narratives) are naturally occurring phenomena through which people explain their experiences in the world. Stories add a psychological dimension that empirical data lacks, namely meaning. Storytelling (or strategic conversation) is the naturally occurring act of passing on information, values, norms, shared experiences/expectations and culture in the form of a story. This act serves to create understanding and build ownership. <b>Scenario-based</b> <b>planning</b> is a technique setting up a logical and plausible sequence of future environmental situations in order to show how a future state may evolve step by step. Scenarios reassemble a set of stylised narratives connecting a series of interrelated events (both facts and perceptions) about alternative futures. Scenarios describe not only the future end-state, but also what path the present will take to progress to that point. The organisational change navigation action serves to defuse the tension arising from the conversion between the “what is” and the “what should/must be” states in the company. This is known as the “in between state” or the void while moving from the current state to the future state. The primary objective of the research was to construct and empirically validate a blueprint process integrating <b>scenario-based</b> <b>planning</b> and organisational change navigation for application in a Developing World and Afrocentric Leadership context. The research process consisted of five stages, namely Stage 1 : Multidisciplinary literature review and synthesis; Stage 2 : Practice views; Stage 3 : Process generation; Stage 4 : Empirical validation; Stage 5 : Discussion and interpretation; and Stage 6 : Reflection. The criteria set for the CNBSPP were simplicity (i. e. the process is plain, simple and straightforward); comprehensiveness (i. e. the process embraces the full range of diversity included in the planning cycle); practicality (i. e. the process is concerned with actual use and practical issues); relevancy to context (i. e. the process is sensitive to the correct deployment of sound planning approaches/practices given the particular context); transparency (i. e. the process is open to public scrutiny); cost-effectiveness (i. e. the process appears to deliver a service at equal/lower cost than current practice); robustness (i. e. the process appears to be relatively stable with a minimum of variation in the face of changing circumstances); flexibility (i. e. the process is adaptable as circumstances dictate); involvement (i. e. the process allows for a high level of engagement by participants); completeness (i. e. the process includes all necessary steps to construct scenarios and navigate change properly); reliability (i. e. following the steps suggested in the process will probably yield consistent and dependable results); and validity (i. e. on the face of it, the process appears to be doing the work for which it was built). The <b>scenario-based</b> <b>planning</b> process consists of a number of basic steps, namely setting the <b>scenario-based</b> <b>planning</b> agenda; determining the focal business question; identifying and ranking the key global and local factors; selecting the scenario logics; fleshing out the scenarios; analysing the implications of the scenarios for the company; developing strategies based on the evolving scenarios; selecting the leading indicators to monitor the implementation of scenarios and strategies; and maintaining organisational learning. The organisational change navigation process consists of a few basic steps, namely mobilising dissatisfaction with the status quo; shaping a guiding coalition; diagnosing organisational problems; building organisational capacity; developing a shared vision; developing strategies and generating short-term wins; formalising the change; dismantling temporary transition structures and processes; and ensuring business learning. Afrocentric Leadership is characterised by a deliberate emphasis on people and their dignity, solidarity, participatory democracy and the collective brotherhood of mankind. Storytelling is an important practice in African cultures to transmit values and ethnics. The end-result of the literature survey was a CNBSPP applicable to a Developing World and Afrocentric Leadership context. The proposed process is similar to a cyclical road map in a complex and unpredictable external environment. The direction of the process is circular and every step is interconnected. The seven stages of the CNBSPP are Stage 1 : Awakening and mobilisation; Stage 2 : Driving forces identification and ranking; Stage 3 : Alternative projections and scenario structuring; Stage 4 : Interpretation and strategy crafting; Stage 5 : Scenario implementation, capacity building and conversion; Stage 6 : Stabilisation; and Stage 7 : Performance tracking and review. The CNBSPP includes not only typical steps of <b>scenario-based</b> <b>planning,</b> but also theoretical and practical insights/views of complexity theory, storytelling and stories, organisational change navigation, Developing Worlds and an Afrocentric Leadership context. Key experts in <b>scenario-based</b> <b>planning</b> were offered an opportunity to list those phases/steps normally included in a typical <b>scenario-based</b> <b>planning</b> process, and unique factors that would strongly influence <b>scenario-based</b> <b>planning</b> in a Developing World and Afrocentric Leadership context. In addition, the experts were requested to critique an abbreviated version of a CNBSPP. The inputs received were used to develop and empirically validate the CNBSPP. It appeared that the steps “conducting an obstacles, negatives, positives and opportunities appraisal” and “building organisational capacity” were not specifically highlighted in interacting with the experts in <b>scenario-based</b> <b>planning.</b> The experts identified no steps in addition to those already ascertained during the literature review for inclusion in a CNBSPP. It appeared that various of the factors influencing <b>scenario-based</b> <b>planning</b> in a Developing World and Afrocentric Leadership context, which were identified in the literature review, were not emphasised by the experts. These factors were: appealing to the invisible agency forces of the spirits; having a shared vision; an evolutionary, bottom-up, present-into-future, process-based, people-driven and cyclical planning approach; the ubuntu philosophy; valuing the role of woman; democratic/participative leadership; low assertiveness; high entrepreneurship; average uncertainty avoidance; valuing seniority in age; a tendency to deviate from formal agenda items; sharing responsibility; emergent/flexible outcomes; and celebrating accomplishments. Those factors influencing <b>scenario-based</b> <b>planning,</b> which were raised by experts in addition to those identified in the literature review, were: carefully selecting the level of sophistication and use of technology; acknowledging different approaches to strategic planning; employing a practical approach to scenario-based planning; convincing the stakeholders of the need for a <b>scenario-based</b> <b>planning</b> approach; and dealing with the fear of doing strategic planning. The CNBSPP complied to some extent with all the evaluation design criteria set at the outset of the research. The participants were, however, of the opinion that the CNBSPP did not fully satisfy “cost-effectiveness” and “completeness”. Compliance with some of the criteria such as “cost-effectiveness” and “reliability” can be determined/confirmed with accuracy only once the CNBSPP is applied in practice. Maintaining expert participation (i. e. their availability) over the entire research period presented some challenges. The key experts requested to validate the CNBSPP empirically occupy top management positions in their respective companies, thus limiting their professional time available to participate in the research. Some participants indicated difficulty in reviewing an abbreviated version of the CNBSPP because of the limited information provided in the questionnaire. The empirical validation of the CNBSPP was not based on the process’s actual application in practice, i. e. practical compliance with the evaluation design criteria developed at the outset of the research was not established. The value-add of the research revolves around its theoretical, methodological and practical value. The research makes a unique contribution to the current level of knowledge by integrating <b>scenario-based</b> <b>planning</b> and organisational change navigation. The research resulted in producing a contextually aligned and empirically validated CNBSPP applicable to a Developing World and Afrocentric Leadership context, the practical application of which will enable companies to integrate various insights into different, but equally plausible interpretations about how the future might unfold. The contextually aligned and empirically validated CNBSPP can now be applied in practice. More research, particularly the use of qualitative methodologies, is required to supplement the currently rhetorical research conducted in the field of Afrocentric Leadership. The dominant Developed World management paradigm needs to move in the direction of valuing both the Developed World and Developing World management practices alongside each other as equally important. Developing Worlds should develop their own context/culture-specific strategic planning theories and practices instead of imitating the Developed Worlds. This does not constitute an outright rejection of the intellectual copying of best practices applicable to Developing World cultural realities. The development of effective and robust strategies requires far more than scenarios alone. Additional elements include things such as a vision, clear strategic goals/objectives, competitive analysis, and an assessment of core competencies and available resources. <b>Scenario-based</b> <b>planning</b> processes designed specifically for application in a Developing World and Afrocentric Leadership context should neither be regarded as inferior nor less professional. As long as the process meets the evaluation design criteria suggested in the research, it may be regarded as a “good” technique given the particular context. It is necessary to accept that the results obtained by using such a process are sometimes less reliable. This may to some extent represent limitations in the process itself, but more commonly it reflects the conditions in which it has to be used. There are practical constraints in Developing Worlds that make the attainment of an “ideal” <b>scenario-based</b> <b>planning</b> process difficult. These constraints are the lack of basic requirements such as money, skilled manpower and often inadequate/inaccurate data. Prof. Theo H. Veldsma...|$|E

40|$|Orientation: In the hyper {{turbulent}} context faced currently by organisations, {{more flexible}} strategic planning approaches, such as scenario planning which {{take into account}} a more comprehensive range of possible futures for an organisation, will position organisations better than conventional forecast and estimates that depend only on a single, linearly extrapolated, strategic response. Research purpose: This study aimed to investigate how <b>scenario-based</b> <b>planning</b> (a strictly cognitive management tool) can be combined with organisational change navigation (a practice addressing the emotionality of change) and how this integrated process should be aligned with the prerequisites imposed by a developing country context and an Afro-centric leadership perspective {{in order to make}} the process more context relevant and aligned. Motivation for the study: The integration of organisational change navigation with conventional scenario based planning, as well as the incorporation of the perquisites of a developing countries and an Afro-centric leadership perspective, will give organisations a more robust, holistic strategic management tool that will add significantly more value within a rapidly, radically and unpredictably changing world. Research design, approach and method: The adopted research approach comprised a combination of the sourcing of the latest thinking in the literature (the ‘theory’) as well as the views of seasoned practitioners of scenario planning (the ‘practice’) through an iterative research process, moving between theory and practice, back to practice and finally returning to theory in order to arrive at a validated expanded and enhanced <b>scenario-based</b> <b>planning</b> process which is both theory and practice ‘proof’. Main findings: A management tool incorporating the change navigation and the unique features of developing countries and Afro-centric leadership was formulated and empirically validated. This management tool is referred to as a change navigation based, scenario planning process (CNBSPP). Practical/managerial implications: CNBSPP is available for use by organisations wishing to apply a strategic planning tool that fits within a developing country context and an Afro-centric leadership approach. Contribution/value add: The research makes a unique contribution to the current level of knowledge by integrating two disciplines usually practised independently of one another, namely <b>scenario-based</b> <b>planning</b> and organisational change navigation.

40|$|Urban {{growth is}} an {{important}} phenomenon, which is taking place on an unprecedented scale, and its impacts on society and the environment are evident. In theory, an evaluation of such urban growth through <b>scenario-based</b> <b>planning</b> helps planners to better assess the future impacts of growth and develop better policies and plans. Within this context, the assessment of transport impacts is particularly important as transport {{plays an important role}} in shaping urban growth. Additionally, transport sector alone is responsible for about one-third of the greenhouse gas emissions of cities, which has detrimental effects on the environment, economy, community health, and quality of life. In practice, however, scarce evidence exists outlining the challenges of scenario-based evaluation and how to best address these while modelling the transport impacts of various urban growth scenarios.

40|$|Scenario {{planning}} {{is the most}} widely used member of a family of strategic planning approaches which use discrete states to explore management issues. Conventional approaches to <b>scenario-based</b> <b>planning</b> emphasise the clarity of using a small number of extrapolations from the present. Recent work has seen the future as a network of states around which movement can take place under the control of various parties. This requires a richer homogeneous set of scenarios and Rhyne's Field Anomaly Relaxation (FAR) technique has served as the basis for that state generation process. FAR has some disadvantages. It can be cumbersome and, more importantly, the discriminants of the states are unchanged throughout each cycle of the process. It operates by establishing a large number of possible futures and then clustering these into coherent sets. An alternative approach is presented which grows neighbouring states step by step from existing, plausible self-consistent states. A network of locally related states is thereby established on which basis transition-based planning can be carried out. The relationship of the method to FAR is described, and its use illustrated by an example...|$|E

Therefore, to enhance the benefits of using DES in construction scheduling, this study proposes an integrated module to establish a framework for automating the generation of time schedules and decision support for Slipform construction projects, particularly through the project feasibility study phase by using data exchange between project data stored in an Intermediate database, DES and Scheduling software. Using the stored information, proposed system creates construction tasks attribute [e. g. activities durations, material quantities and resources amount], then DES uses all the given information to create a proposal for the construction schedule automatically. This research is considered a demonstration of a flexible Slipform project modeling, rapid <b>scenario-based</b> <b>planning</b> and schedule generation approach that may be of interest to both practitioners and researchers...|$|E
40|$|Societal {{comprehension}} {{of climate change}} {{has come a long}} way in the past ten years. As media coverage increases, politicians, scientists, managers, and average citizens now openly discuss how future scenarios may alter their day-to-day lives. While details about the severity of climate change come into view (e. g., IPCC 2007), protected area managers in particular have begun to recognize that changing climatic conditions will require alteration of even their most commonplace management strategies now and into the future (Peterson et al. 2003; Welch 2005; Baron et al. 2008). Management policies will require more flexibility and an increased focus on supporting tenets of ecological resilience rather than maintaining current conditions (Baron et al. 2008). Established, but non-traditional strategies, such as adaptive management, which incorporate trial-and-error learning with management practice (Holling 1978), and <b>scenario-based</b> <b>planning,</b> which involves envisioning and preparing for a variety of possible scenarios (Peterson et al. 2003) will need to take precedence over reactive management strategies. Additionally, since previous practice will no longer be a suitable guide for current management policy, a continued commitment to science-based management will be necessary (Baron et al. 2008) ...|$|E
40|$|In a paper {{appearing}} in this issue, Adini, et al. describe a struggle familiar to many emergency planners—the challenge of planning for all scenarios. The authors contend that all-hazards, or capabilities-based planning, {{in which a}} set of core capabilities applicable to numerous types of events is developed, is a more efficient way to achieve general health care system emergency preparedness than <b>scenario-based</b> <b>planning.</b> Essentially, the core of {{what is necessary to}} plan for and respond to one kind of disaster (e. g. a biologic event) is also necessary for planning and responding to other types of disasters, allowing for improvements in planning and maximizing efficiencies. While Adini, et al. have advanced the science of health care emergency preparedness through their consideration of 490 measures to assess preparedness, a shorter set of validated preparedness measures would support the dual goals of accountability and improved outcomes and could provide the basis for determining which actions in the name of preparedness really matter. Commentary Despite years of planning and billions of dollars spent on disaster preparedness and response activities worldwide, the science of preparedness is in its infancy. Th...|$|E
40|$|The Anthropocene Epoch is {{characterized}} by novel and increasingly complex dependencies between the environment and human civilization, with many challenges of biodiversity management emerging as wicked problems. Problems arising from the management of biological invasions can be either tame (with simple or obvious solutions) or wicked, where difficulty in appropriately defining the problem can make complete solutions impossible to find. We review four case studies that reflect the main goals {{in the management of}} biological invasions – prevention, eradication, and impact reduction – assessing the drivers and extent of wickedness in each. We find that a disconnect between the perception and reality of how wicked a problem is can profoundly influence the likelihood of successful management. For example, managing species introductions can be wicked, but shifting from species-focused to vector-focused risk management can greatly reduce the complexity, making it a tame problem. The scope and scale of the overall management goal will also dictate the wickedness of the problem and the achievability of management solutions (cf. eradication and ecosystem restoration). Finally, managing species that have both positive and negative impacts requires engagement with all stakeholders and <b>scenario-based</b> <b>planning.</b> Effective management of invasions requires either recognizing unavoidable wickedness, or circumventing it by seeking alternative management perspectives., The Anthropocene Epoch {{is characterized}} by novel and increasingly complex dependencies between the environment and human civilization, with many challenges of biodiversity management emerging as wicked problems.

40|$|CHDS State/LocalApproved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe planning methodologies used today by most U. S. fire departments are excellent for traditional missions, but wholly inadequate for the threats posed by terrorism. Planning {{in the fire}} service {{and the rest of}} the first responder community historically has relied on a one-dimensional approach that uses a <b>scenario-based</b> <b>planning</b> (SBP) methodology. This thesis argues that the fire service and others in the first responder community will be able to contribute to homeland security missions much more effectively, and efficiently, by switching to specially adapted versions of capabilities-based planning. This thesis proposes a new integrated planning methodology that combines the planning strengths of scenariobased planning, threat-based planning, and capabilities-based planning. The new method identifies capabilities that could be used to manage and mitigate the consequences of the different types of contingencies within the various response spectrums. It allows an organization to perform analysis and efficiency studies to evaluate the different spectrums of contingencies against existing capabilities and create a menu of capabilities necessary for the first responder to respond to all its missions, including immediate threats and terrorism, in the most efficient and cost-effective manner.

40|$|Governments in many {{countries}} are decentralising to give more control over decision making and budgets to local administrations. One expectation of this change is that local governments will more effectively and efficiently respond to the poorest citizens in their jurisdictions. Decentralisation is especially significant to forest communities, which have historically benefited little from government services and poverty reduction programmes because of their physical isolation and social marginalisation. This Source Book was written for local governments and their partners who hope {{to respond to the}} needs of forest communities and improve the wellbeing of their people. It first discusses important concepts, such as decentralisation, wellbeing, poverty and the link between forests and poverty. It then presents four participatory tools that local governments may find useful to involve forest communities in the planning, monitoring and evaluation of development and poverty alleviation programmes, namely: monitoring local poverty contexts through interactive mapping; monitoring household wellbeing through local indicators; community evaluation of local government programmes; and communicating communities’ needs through <b>scenario-based</b> <b>planning.</b> The Source Book is based on the findings of an action research project carried out in forest communities in Indonesia and Bolivia by the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR). Although developed and tested in just two countries, the concepts and tools apply to people and governments around the globe...|$|E
