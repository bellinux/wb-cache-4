40|$|<b>Supplier</b> <b>quality</b> {{evaluation}} {{is a critical}} part of quality management in global supply chains. Poor <b>supplier</b> <b>quality</b> results in not only monetary losses but also negatively impacts the business potential and future growth of buyer organizations. In this thesis, we propose a multi-tier <b>supplier</b> <b>quality</b> evaluation framework based on total cost of ownership and data envelopment analysis for quality management in global supply chains. The proposed approach comprises of three main steps. Firstly, we group the upstream suppliers based on common attributes using hierarchical cluster analysis. Then, we calculate the total cost of ownership for the grouped suppliers and their sub-suppliers using various qualitative and quantitative factors that are vital for quality management in global supply chains. In the third and the last step, we apply data envelopment analysis to compute the efficiencies of various suppliers to identify the best one (s) and recommend for selection. A numerical application is provided. The proposed approach is very useful to decision makers in benchmarking <b>supplier</b> <b>quality</b> performances and setting improvement targets for <b>supplier</b> <b>quality</b> development in global supply chains...|$|E

40|$|An Integrated Model for <b>Supplier</b> <b>Quality</b> Evaluation Aqeel Asaad Al Salem <b>Supplier</b> <b>quality</b> {{evaluation}} is a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem that involves multiple, heterogeneous criteria of different weights. The literature addresses quality, delivery, technology, value and service as {{the five most}} common criteria used for <b>supplier</b> <b>quality</b> evaluation. In this thesis, we have considered the most important criteria for {{evaluating the quality of}} suppliers based on {{a review of the literature}} and observation in practice. They include both qualitative and quantitative criteria to reflect the real attributes of the supplier in question, and are applied in a <b>supplier</b> <b>quality</b> evaluation performed for a large data set. We propose a three-stage model for performing <b>supplier</b> <b>quality</b> evaluation. In the first stage, we identify the evaluation criteria and assign a weight to each criterion. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) technique is used in this stage. In the second stage, we address the large size of suppliers’ datasets and present a cluster-analysis-based approach to obtain manageable supplier datasets for evaluation purposes. In the third stage, we apply the VIKOR method to evaluate <b>supplier</b> <b>quality</b> in the clusters obtained from the previous stage. A numerical application is provided to demonstrate the proposed approach. The strength of the proposed model lies in the integrated application of the three techniques, in which each technique is best suited for its respective problem. The model’s other chief advantage is its ability to deal efficiently with the challenge of evaluating large numbers of suppliers and the data pertaining to their attributes...|$|E

Unfortunately, implementing the concept is not very simple and over the years, companies have crumbled due to failure to master the best practices in <b>supplier</b> <b>quality</b> management. Practices such as measuring the performance of suppliers, engaging suppliers in quality management systems, supplier audits, supplier development, integration and competitive supplier selection are a great opportunity to improve organizational performance in terms of customer service delivery levels and operational costs reduction. However, it is worth noting that there are numerous challenges encountered in having such practices accepted by all the stakeholders. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of <b>supplier</b> <b>quality</b> management on organizational performance, covering all the supermarkets in Kakamega town.

The study also explored the potential integration of <b>supplier</b> <b>quality</b> management practices into an organization’s operations, focussing on the currently available applications.

40|$|Supply chain quality {{management}} has received increasing attention from researchers and practitioners in recent years. However, the {{knowledge about the}} effects of a manufacturer's design and production capabilities on supply chain {{quality management}} is limited. In this study, we propose a model to investigate the effects of mass customization and product modularity on supply chain quality integration (i. e. internal, supplier, and customer quality integration) and the impact of supply chain quality integration on competitive performance. We use data collected from 317 global manufacturers to empirically test the conceptual model. The results show that mass customization and product modularity directly improve internal quality integration, and product modularity also improves internal quality integration indirectly through mass customization. Product modularity improves <b>supplier</b> <b>quality</b> integration directly, and both mass customization and product modularity improve <b>supplier</b> <b>quality</b> integration indirectly through internal quality integration. Mass customization improves customer quality integration both directly and indirectly through internal quality integration, and product modularity improves customer quality integration indirectly through mass customization and internal quality integration.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} is to determine the best practices for <b>supplier</b> <b>quality</b> management (SQM) in the construction industry that ensure that the supplied materials and equipment for construction projects are within the quality requirements. The research is based on three main objectives. The first objective is to describe and assess the process of assuring <b>supplier</b> <b>quality</b> inside and outside the construction industry. The second objective is to develop a framework for the <b>supplier</b> <b>quality</b> process based on the collection of SQM practices from multiple data sources. The third objective is to assess the SQM practices within the developed framework of <b>supplier</b> <b>quality</b> process, and to discuss the development of strategic leadership for SQM. The contribution of this research can be used by stakeholders in the construction industry to improve SQM within their organizations. Researchers can also benefit from this research to better understand SQM practices within the construction industry. The findings of {{the research}} show that SQM practices outside the construction industry appear to be similar to the existing practices within the construction industry. However, construction organizations with highly effective SQM systems implement the SQM practices more consistently, as compared to the other organizations. Also, construction organizations with highly effective SQM systems focus on quality when selecting their suppliers, and hold joint quality planning with their suppliers because these practices have high impact on quality and are easy to implement. Finally, the research shows that having a quality director that helps create a quality culture for SQM is very important to strategically lead SQM within construction organizations...|$|E
