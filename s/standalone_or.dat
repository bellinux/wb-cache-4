A typical shorthand system provides symbols or abbreviations for words and common phrases, which can allow someone well-trained {{in the system}} to write as quickly as people speak. Abbreviation methods are alphabet-based and use different abbreviating approaches. Several autocomplete programs, <b>standalone</b> <b>or</b> integrated in text editors, based on word lists, also include a shorthand function for frequently-used phrases. Many journalists use shorthand writing to quickly take notes at press conferences or other similar scenarios.|$|E
25|$|Smaller, less expensive, {{smoke alarm}} systems, {{typically}} {{used in a}} domestic/residential environment, may be individual standalone units, or interconnected. They typically generate a loud acoustic warning signal as their only action. Several detectors (whether <b>standalone</b> <b>or</b> interconnected) are normally used in the rooms of a dwelling. There are inexpensive smoke alarms that may be interconnected so that any detector that triggers sounds all alarms. They are powered by mains electricity, with disposable or rechargeable battery backup. They may be interconnected by wires, or wirelessly.They are required in new installations in some jurisdictions.|$|E
500|$|The second season's mythology was {{intended}} to be revealed in small parcels. Throughout the season, Pinkner and Wyman tried to create an episode that best bridged [...] "standalone" [...] traits—needed for casual viewers—with the further advancement of the show's mythology for those who watched regularly. At {{the start of the season}} Pinkner believed they had found a [...] "good rhythm" [...] between the two, as the mythology [...] "really [...] affect the characters, to the point where even the standalone [...] advance mythology". After the season ended, Wyman commented at San Diego Comic-Con International, [...] "We learned that the fan fans love mythology but there are needs from the networks. We started experimenting with a thing we called 'mythalones', not <b>standalone</b> <b>or</b> myth." [...] Wyman cited the season's 18th episode, [...] "White Tulip" [...] as a prime example, noting [...] "You can see that you're following Walter's journey, it's the right mix." [...] The Fringe producers strove to avoid becoming bogged down in mythology, an issue that they perceived happened in Alias, another J.J. Abrams television series. In a joint statement released midway through the season, Abrams, Pinkner, and Wyman noted that their [...] "only internal rule is that we make every effort to not raise mythological questions merely to string viewers along, but rather to provide answers that generate consequences." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{serial format}} {{changed for the}} 2005 revival, with a series usually {{consisting}} of thirteen 45-minute, self-contained episodes (60 minutes with adverts, on overseas commercial channels), and an extended 60-minute episode broadcast on Christmas Day. This system was shortened to twelve episodes and one Christmas special following the revival's eighth series. Each series includes both standalone and multiple episodic stories, linked with a loose story arc that is resolved in the series finale. As in the early [...] "classic" [...] era, each episode, whether <b>standalone</b> <b>or</b> {{part of a larger}} story, has its own title. Occasionally, regular-series episodes will exceed the 45-minute run time; notably, the episodes [...] "Journey's End" [...] from 2008 and [...] "The Eleventh Hour" [...] from 2010 exceeded an hour in length.|$|E
2500|$|There are two {{versions}} of the SID chip: the 6581 and the 8580. The MOS Technology 6581 was used in the original ("breadbox") C64s, the early versions of the 64C, and the Commodore 128. The 6581 was replaced with the MOS Technology 8580 in 1987. While the 6581 sound quality is a little crisper and many Commodore 64 fans say they prefer its sound, it lacks some versatility available in the 8580 – for example, the 8580 can mix all available waveforms on each channel, whereas the 6581 can only play a single waveform per channel. The main difference between the 6581 and the 8580 is the supply voltage. The 6581 uses a [...] supply—the 8580, a [...] supply. A modification can be made to use the 6581 in a newer 64C board (which uses the [...] chip). The SID chip's distinctive sound has allowed it to retain a following long after its host computer was discontinued. A number of audio enthusiasts and companies have designed SID-based products as add-ons for the C64, x86 PCs, and <b>standalone</b> <b>or</b> Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) music devices such as the Elektron SidStation. These devices use chips taken from excess stock, or removed from used computers. In 2007, Timbaland's extensive use of the SidStation led to the plagiarism controversy for [...] "Block Party" [...] and [...] "Do It" [...] (written for Nelly Furtado).|$|E
