500|$|Golden wattle is {{cultivated}} in Australia and {{was introduced to}} the northern hemisphere in the mid-1800s. Although it has a relatively short lifespan of 15 to 30 years, it is widely grown for its bright yellow, fragrant flowers. As well as being an ornamental plant, it {{has been used as a}} windbreak or in controlling erosion. Trees are sometimes planted with the taller sugar gum (Eucalyptus cladocalyx) to make a two-layered windbreak. One form widely cultivated was originally collected on Mount Arapiles in western Victoria. It is floriferous, with fragrant flowers appearing from April to July. The species has a degree of frost tolerance and is adaptable to a wide range of soil conditions, but it prefers good drainage. It tolerates heavy soils in dry climates, as well as mild soil salinity. It can suffer yellowing (chlorosis) in limestone-based (alkaline) soils. Highly drought-tolerant, it needs [...] winter rainfall for cultivation. It is vulnerable to gall attack in cultivation. Propagation is from seed which has been pre-soaked in hot water to soften the hard <b>seed</b> <b>coating.</b>|$|E

Though photosynthate import and unloading were significantly reduced by perfusion, measurements of photosynthate fluxes in perfused <b>seed</b> <b>coats</b> proved {{useful for the}} study of unloading mechanisms in vivo. Phloem import was stimulated by lowered <b>seed</b> <b>coat</b> cell turgor, as demonstrated by an increase in tracer and sucrose import to <b>seed</b> <b>coats</b> perfused with high concentrations of an osmoticum. The partitioning of photosynthates between retention in the <b>seed</b> <b>coat</b> and release to the perfusion solution also was turgor sensitive; increases in <b>seed</b> <b>coat</b> cell turgor stimulated photosynthate release to the apoplast at the expense of photosynthate retention within the <b>seed</b> <b>coat.</b> There was no evidence of a turgor-sensitive sucrose uptake mechanism in perfused <b>seed</b> <b>coats.</b> Thus, the turgor sensitivity of photosynthate partitioning within perfused <b>seed</b> <b>coats</b> was consistent with a turgor-sensitive efflux control mechanism.

The <b>seed</b> <b>coat</b> plays a vital role in the life cycle of plants by controlling the development of the embryo and determining seed dormancy and germination. Within the <b>seed</b> <b>coat</b> are a number of unique tissues that undergo differentiation to serve specific functions in the seed. A large number of genes are known to be specifically expressed within the <b>seed</b> <b>coat</b> tissues; however, very few of them are understood functionally. The <b>seed</b> <b>coat</b> synthesizes a wide range of novel compounds that may serve the plant in diverse ways, including defense and control of development. Many of the compounds are sources of industrial products and are components of food and feeds. The use of <b>seed</b> <b>coat</b> biotechnology to enhance seed quality and yield, or to generate novel components has not been exploited, largely because of lack of knowledge of the genetic systems that govern <b>seed</b> <b>coat</b> development and composition.

50|$|The American {{basswood}} {{is known}} for {{being one of the}} most difficult native North American trees to propagate from seed, as they not only have a low viability rate (approximately 30% of all seeds are viable), but quickly develop an extremely hard <b>seed</b> <b>coating</b> that may delay germination for up to two years. If planting them, it is recommended to gather the seeds in early autumn and sow them before they dry out and form a coating. This will then allow germination to occur immediately. Overall, seeds are not a major part of the tree's reproductive strategy and it instead mostly spreads by self-coppicing. All juvenile basswoods coppice extremely readily, and even old trees will often sprout from the stump if cut.|$|E

In the canning industry, <b>seed</b> <b>coat</b> splitting is considered one factor affecting the integrity of the appearance in the final product. Three different dark red kidney bean cultivars (85, 453 and Nickols) grown in the Wisconsin area were studied in this research. The physiochemical properties in this study included moisture content, theIII <b>seed</b> <b>coat</b> to whole <b>seed</b> weight ratio, the weight per seed, ash, mineral (sodium, calcium, iron, potassium and magnesium) and total crude protein content in the <b>seed</b> <b>coat.</b> The correlations of these properties with the <b>seed</b> <b>coat</b> splits were investigated.

5000|$|The natural {{biocontrol}} {{ability of}} chitosan {{should not be}} confused with the effects of fertilizers or pesticides upon plants or the environment. Chitosan active biopesticides represent a new tier of cost-effective biological control of crops for agriculture and horticulture. [...] The biocontrol mode of action of chitosan elicits natural innate defense responses within plant to resist insects, pathogens, and soil-borne diseases when applied to foliage or the soil. Chitosan increases photosynthesis, promotes and enhances plant growth, stimulates nutrient uptake, increases germination and sprouting, and boosts plant vigor. When used as seed treatment or <b>seed</b> <b>coating</b> on cotton, corn, seed potatoes, soybeans, sugar beets, tomatoes, wheat and many other seeds, it elicits an innate immunity response in developing roots which destroys parasitic cyst nematodes without harming beneficial nematodes and organisms.|$|E
50|$|Cistaceae {{have also}} optimally {{adapted to the}} {{wildfires}} that frequently eradicate large areas of forest. The plants cast their seeds in the soil during the growth period, {{but they do not}} germinate in the next season. Their hard coating is impermeable to the water, and thus the seeds remain dormant {{for a long period of}} time. This coating together with their small size allows these plants to establish a large seed bank rather deep in the soil. Once the fire comes and kills the vegetation in the area, the <b>seed</b> <b>coating</b> softens or cracks as a result of the heating, and the surviving seeds germinate shortly after the fire. This mechanism allows the Cistaceae to produce a large number of young shoots simultaneously and at the right time, and thus to obtain an important advantage over other plants in the process of repopulating the area.|$|E
50|$|The Solanum conocarpum also to {{referred}} as the Marron bacora {{is considered a}} rare plant that was discovered in the evergreen forest in St. John. Dispersal biology and organisms that consume the plant are uncertain (Gibney and Ray). In the late 1990's, five individuals were sighted and recorded in the mid-elevation forests of St. John. Subsequently, in February 2003, over 150 additional individuals were found by David Hamada {{on the island of}} St. John. As part of its conservation effort, the plant has since been planted at various other locations, including St. George's Village Botanical Gardens on St. Croix, the University of the VIrgin Islands' St. Thomas campus and Fairchild Botanical Gardens in Miami. Researchers have established the lack of seedlings is correlated to the lack of saplings. The seeds derived from a fruit that has fragile <b>seed</b> <b>coating.</b> With the lack of individuals in the wild, cross fertilization is challenging.

40|$|The {{timing of}} harvest {{is a major}} factor {{affecting}} seed quality in soybean, particularly in Midsouthern USA, when rain during harvest period is not uncommon. The objective of this research was to evaluate the effects of time of harvest on soybean seed quality (seed composition, germination, <b>seed</b> <b>coat</b> boron, and lignin) in high germinability (HG) breeding lines (50 % exotic) developed under high heat. The hypothesis was that seeds of HG lines possess physiological and genetic traits for a better seed quality at harvest maturity and delayed harvest. A 2 -year field experiment was conducted under irrigated conditions. Results showed that, at harvest maturity, the exotic HG lines had higher seed protein, oleic acid, sugars, <b>seed</b> <b>coat</b> boron, and <b>seed</b> <b>coat</b> lignin, but lower seed oil compared with the non-exotic checks (Control), confirming our hypothesis. At 28 days after harvest maturity (delayed harvest), the content of seed protein, oleic acid, sugars, <b>seed</b> <b>coat</b> boron, and <b>seed</b> <b>coat</b> lignin were higher in some of the HG lines compared with the checks, indicating a possible involvement of these seed constituents, especially <b>seed</b> <b>coat</b> boron and <b>seed</b> <b>coat</b> lignin, in maintaining <b>seed</b> <b>coat</b> integrity and protecting <b>seed</b> <b>coat</b> against physical damage. Highly significant positive correlations were found between germination and seed protein, oleic acid, sugars, and <b>seed</b> <b>coat</b> boron and <b>seed</b> <b>coat</b> lignin. Highly significant negative correlation was found between germination and oil, linoleic acid, <b>seed</b> <b>coat</b> wrinkling, shattering, and hard seed. Yields of some HG lines were competitive with checks. This research demonstrated that time of harvesting is an important factor influencing seed protein and oil production. Also, since high oleic acid is desirable for oxidative stability, shelf-life and biodiesel properties, using HG lines could positively influence these important traits. This result should suggest to breeders of some of the advantages of selecting for high <b>seed</b> <b>coat</b> boron and lignin, and inform growers of the importance of timely harvest for maintaining high seed quality...|$|R
