25|$|Today, many humans {{wake up with}} {{an alarm}} clock. (Some people, however, can {{reliably}} wake themselves up at a specific time with no need for an alarm.) Many sleep quite differently on workdays versus days off, a pattern {{which can lead to}} chronic circadian desynchronization. Many people regularly look at television and other screens before going to bed, a factor which may exacerbate this mass circadian disruption. Scientific studies on sleep have shown that sleep stage at awakening {{is an important factor in}} amplifying <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{effects of}} <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia</b> wear off after 2-4 hours of wakefulness, such that most workers who {{wake up in}} the morning and go to work suffer some degree of <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia</b> at the {{beginning}} of their shift. The relative effects of <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia</b> vs. the other factors are hard to quantify; however, the benefits of napping appear to outweigh the cost associated with <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Sleep</b> <b>inertia</b> is a {{physiological}} state of impaired cognitive and sensory-motor performance that is present immediately after awakening. It persists {{during the transition}} of sleep to wakefulness, where an individual will experience feelings of drowsiness, disorientation {{and a decline in}} motor dexterity. Impairment from <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia</b> may take several hours to dissipate. In the majority of cases, morning <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia</b> is experienced for 15 to 60 minutes after waking.|$|E
40|$|Background: Daily {{cycles of}} sleep/wake, hormones, and {{physiological}} processes are often misaligned with behavioral patterns during shift work, {{leading to an}} increased risk of developing cardiovascular/metabolic/gastrointestinal disorders, some types of cancer, and mental disorders including depression and anxiety. It is unclear how sleep timing, chronotype, and circadian clock gene variation contribute to adaptation to shift work. Methods: Newly defined sleep strategies, chronotype, and genotype for polymorphisms in circadian clock genes were assessed in 388 hospital day- and night-shift nurses. Results: Night-shift nurses who used sleep deprivation as a means to switch to and from diurnal sleep on work days (, 25 %) were the most poorly adapted to their work schedule. Chronotype also influenced efficacy of adaptation. In addition, polymorphisms in CLOCK, NPAS 2, PER 2, and PER 3 were significantly associated with outcomes such as alcohol/caffeine consumption and sleepiness, as well as <b>sleep</b> phase, <b>inertia</b> and duration in both single- and multi-locus models. Many of these results were specific to shift type suggesting an interaction between genotype and environment (in this case, shift work).

Sleep strategy, chronotype, and genotype contribute to the adaptation of the circadian system to an environment that switches frequently and/or irregularly between different schedules of the light-dark cycle and social/workplace time. This study of shift work nurses illustrates how an environmental "stress" to the temporal organization of physiology and metabolism can have behavioral and health-related consequences. Because nurses are a key component of health care, these findings could have important implications for health-care policy...|$|R
50|$|When sleep deprived, {{re-entering}} sleep {{may provide}} a viable route to reduce mental and physical fatigue but this can also induce <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia.</b> In order to limit <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia,</b> one should avert from waking in the deeper stages of slow-wave sleep. The onset of slow-wave sleep occurs approximately 30 minutes after falling asleep, therefore a nap {{should be limited to}} under 30 to prevent waking during slow-wave sleep and enhancing <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia.</b> Furthermore, self-awakening from a short nap was shown to relieve disorientation of <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia</b> as opposed to a forced awakening but these results may warrant more research into the nature of arousal after sleep periods.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sleep</b> <b>inertia</b> is {{a concern}} for {{individuals}} where decision making abilities, safety-critical tasks {{and the ability to}} operate efficiently are important soon after awakening. This proposes an occupational hazard due to the cognitive and motor deficits characteristic of <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia.</b>|$|E
50|$|There {{has been}} a great deal of {{research}} into potential methods to relieve the effects of <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia.</b> The demand for remedies is driven by the occupational hazards of <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia</b> for employees who work extended shifts such as medical professionals, emergency responders, or military personnel. The motor functioning and cognitive ability of these professionals who must immediately respond to a call can pose a safety hazard in the workplace. Below are some of the various methods that have been suggested to combat <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia.</b>|$|E
50|$|Some other {{potential}} stimuli {{that could potentially}} minimized the effects of <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia</b> are sound and temperature. There is moderate evidence {{that the presence of}} mild sounds, and a sharp decrease in the temperature of the extremities may independently reverse <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia</b> symptoms. Noise is thought to increase the attentiveness of an individual upon awakening. A drop in temperature of the extremities may prevent heat loss, facilitating the return of core-body temperature to homeostatic daytime levels.|$|E
5000|$|Studies {{have shown}} that abrupt {{awakening}} during stage 3 sleep, slow-wave sleep (SWS), produces more <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia</b> than awakening during sleep stages 1, 2 or REM sleep ...|$|E
5000|$|Prior sleep {{deprivation}} increases {{the percentage of}} time spent in slow-wave sleep (SWS). Therefore, an individual who was previously sleep deprived will have a greater chance of experiencing <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia.</b>|$|E
50|$|Naps lasting {{more than}} 30 minutes {{appear to be}} {{associated}} with a period of impaired alertness (<b>sleep</b> <b>inertia)</b> immediately after awakening that takes some time to dissipate before wakefulness and performance improve.|$|E
50|$|Caffeine is a {{xanthine}} derivative {{that can}} cross the blood-brain barrier. The caffeine present in coffee or tea exerts its stimulating action by blocking adenosine receptors in the brain. By antagonizing the adenosine receptors caffeine limits {{the effects of}} adenosine buildup {{in the brain and}} increases alertness and attentiveness. Previous research has shown that coupled with a short nap, the proactive administration of caffeine prior to the nap can alleviate the effects of <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia.</b> Nonetheless, individual degree of consumption and tolerance to caffeine may be responsible for variation in its efficacy to reduce <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia</b> symptoms.|$|E
50|$|Various {{durations}} {{are recommended}} for power naps, {{which are very}} short compared to regular sleep. The short duration of a power nap is designed to prevent nappers from sleeping so long that they enter a normal sleep cycle {{without being able to}} complete it. Going beyond sleep stages I and II but failing to complete a full sleep cycle can result in <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia,</b> a phenomenon where one feels groggy, disoriented, and even more sleepy than before beginning the nap. Brief naps (10-15 minutes it varies) can improve alertness directly after awakening without the detrimental effects of <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia</b> associated with longer naps.|$|E
5000|$|These {{symptoms}} are expressed {{with the greatest}} intensity immediately after waking, and disseminate following a period extended wakefulness. The duration of symptoms varies on a conditional basis, with primary expression during the first 15-60 minutes after waking and potentially extending for several hours. [...] Tasks that require more complex cognitive operations will feature greater deficits as compared to a simple motor task; the accuracy of sensory and motor functioning is more impaired by <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia</b> as compared to sheer speed. [...] In order to measure the cognitive and motor deficiencies associated with <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia,</b> a battery of tests may be utilized including psychomotor vigilance task, descending subtraction task, auditory reaction time task, and the finger tapping task.|$|E
5000|$|The SAFTE {{simulation}} integrates {{quantitative information}} about (1) the circadian rhythm in metabolic rate; (2) cognitive performance recovery rates associated with sleep, and cognitive performance decay rates associated with wakefulness; and (3) cognitive performance effects associated with <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia</b> {{to produce a}} 3-process model of human cognitive effectiveness. The SAFTE model has been under development by Dr. Hursh {{for more than a}} decade. In the general architecture of the SAFTE model, a circadian process influences both cognitive effectiveness and sleep regulation. Sleep regulation is dependent upon hours of sleep, hours of wakefulness, current sleep debt, the circadian process and sleep fragmentation (awakenings during a sleep period). Cognitive effectiveness is dependent upon the current balance of the sleep regulation process, the circadian process, and <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{natural light}} {{provided}} by the morning sunrise {{may be attributed to}} <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia</b> effects. Research simulating increase of light at dawn was shown to potentiate the cortisol awakening response (CAR). The CAR is a spike in blood cortisol levels following awakening, and is associated with the return to an alert cognitive state.|$|E
50|$|Scientific {{studies on}} sleep having shown that sleep stage at {{awakening}} {{is an important}} factor in amplifying <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia.</b> Alarm clocks involving sleep stage monitoring appeared on the market in 2005. Using sensing technologies such as EEG electrodes or accelerometers, these alarm clocks are supposed to wake people only from light sleep. Dawn simulators are another technology meant to mediate these effects.|$|E
5000|$|Modern devices running Android and iOS include {{built-in}} microphones and accelerometers. SleepBot's [...] "smart alarm" [...] {{feature is}} designed to attempt to wake the user during non-REM sleep. This does not prevent sleep debt or prevent the user from experiencing any of the mental and physical side effects of sleep deprivation, but it may help to prevent early-morning grogginess and <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia.</b>|$|E
5000|$|On May 22, 2010, Air India Express Flight 812 {{overshot}} {{the runway}} and {{fell off the}} cliff resulting in the plane catching fire, ultimately killing 158 people. Reports state that {{the captain of the}} flight was sleeping for {{a large portion of the}} flight and woke up shortly before the landing. The captain was experiencing <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia</b> due to fatigue.|$|E
50|$|There {{are four}} major {{determinants}} of cognitive performance and alertness in healthy shift-workers. They are: circadian phase, <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia,</b> acute sleep deprivation and chronic sleep deficit. The circadian phase is relatively fixed in humans; attempting to shift {{it so that}} an individual is alert during the circadian bathyphase is difficult. Sleep during the day is shorter and less consolidated than night-time sleep. Before a night shift, workers generally sleep less than before a day shift.|$|E
50|$|Experimental {{confirmation}} {{of the benefits of}} this brief nap comes from a Flinders University study in Australia in which 5, 10, 20, or 30 minute sleeps were given. The greatest immediate improvement in measures of alertness and cognitive performance came after the 10 minutes of sleep. The 20 and 30 minute sleeps showed evidence of <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia</b> immediately after the naps and improvements in alertness more than 30 minutes later but not to a greater level than after the 10 minutes of sleep.|$|E
50|$|His {{laboratory}} studies the physiological, cognitive and functional changes resulting from sleep loss in humans. His research has primarily {{focused on the}} manner in which sleep homeostasis and circadian rhythmicity control cognitive, affective, behavioral, endocrine and immunological processes. Dinges' work has contributed to our knowledge of the effects of sleep disorders, the recovery potential of naps, the nature of <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia</b> and the impact of cumulative sleep debt. He has developed technologies for monitoring human neurobehavioral capability, such as his patented Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT).|$|E
50|$|Many night workers take naps {{during their}} breaks, {{and in some}} industries, planned napping at work (with {{facilities}} provided) is beginning to be accepted. A nap before starting a night shift is a logical prophylactic measure. However, naps that are too long (over 20-30 minutes) may generate <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia,</b> a groggy feeling after awakening that can impair performance. Therefore, brief naps (10 to 30 minutes) are preferred to longer naps (over 30 minutes). Also, long naps may also interfere with the main sleep bout.|$|E

5000|$|Studies {{show that}} {{individuals}} express {{a lack of}} {{blood flow to the}} brain upon awakening. Levels of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral blood flow velocities (CBFV) will take up to 30 minutes to increase and reach daytime levels. [...] Studies using advanced imaging have shown that cerebral blood flow will return to waking levels in the brainstem and thalamus first. Then, after 15 minutes, the brain's anterior cortical regions receive normal daytime blood flow. This 15 minute time period corresponds to the <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia</b> period.|$|E
50|$|On Tuesday 8 October 2013, the Band {{announced}} via their Facebook page that, due to conflicting {{ideas with}} regards to the band's future direction, they would be disbanding the group. However, it was stated that, whilst Luke Lucas would be moving on with his musical career and later form the orchestral, melodic metal band Solace In Nightmares with Matt Seaborne, the other 4 members of TDLW would be working together under a separate name, this new band would become <b>Sleep</b> <b>Inertia.</b> The Dead Lay Waiting played their final show at the Underworld in Camden.|$|E
5000|$|The 20-minute nap {{increases}} alertness {{and motor}} skills. Various durations may be recommended for power naps, {{which are very}} short compared to regular sleep. The short duration prevents nappers from sleeping so long that they enter the slow wave portion of the normal sleep cycle {{without being able to}} complete the cycle. Entering deep, slow-wave sleep and failing to complete the normal sleep cycle, can result in a phenomenon known as <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia,</b> where one feels groggy, disoriented, and even sleepier than before beginning the nap. In order to attain optimal post-nap performance, a Stage 2 nap must be limited to the beginning of a sleep cycle, specifically sleep stages N1 and N2, typically 18-25 minutes.|$|E
50|$|A Flinders University {{study of}} {{individuals}} restricted to only {{five hours of}} sleep per night found a 10-minute nap was overall the most recuperative nap duration of various nap lengths they examined (lengths of 0 min, 5 min, 10 min, 20 min, and 30 minutes): the 5-minute nap produced few benefits {{in comparison with the}} no-nap control; the 10-minute nap produced immediate improvements in all outcome measures (including sleep latency, subjective sleepiness, fatigue, vigor, and cognitive performance), with some of these benefits maintained for as long as 155 minutes; the 20-minute nap was associated with improvements emerging 35 minutes after napping and lasting up to 125 minutes after napping; and the 30-minute nap produced a period of impaired alertness and performance immediately after napping, indicative of <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia,</b> followed by improvements lasting up to 155 minutes after the nap.|$|E
50|$|Sleep is a {{behavior}} that is provoked by the body initiating the feeling of sleepiness in order for people to rest for usually several hours at a time. During sleep, there is a reduction of awareness, responsiveness, and movement. On average, an adult human sleeps between seven and eight hours per night. There is a minute percentage that sleeps less than five to six hours, {{which is also a}} symptom of sleep deprivation, and an even smaller percentage of people who sleep more than ten hours a day. Oversleeping has been shown to have a correlation with higher mortality. There are no benefits to oversleeping and it can result in <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia,</b> which is the feeling of drowsiness {{for a period of time}} after waking. There are two phases of sleep: rapid eye movement (REM) and Non-REM sleep (NREM).|$|E
5000|$|NASA, in {{cooperation}} with the National Space Biomedical Research Institute, has funded research on napping. Despite NASA recommendations that astronauts sleep eight hours a day when in space, they usually have trouble sleeping eight hours at a stretch, so the agency needs to know about the optimal length, timing and effect of naps. Professor David Dinges of the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine led research in a laboratory setting on sleep schedules which combined various amounts of [...] "anchor sleep", ranging from about four to eight hours in length, with no nap or daily naps of up to 2.5 hours. Longer naps were found to be better, with some cognitive functions benefiting more from napping than others. Vigilance and basic alertness benefited the least while working memory benefited greatly. Naps in the individual subjects' biological daytime worked well, but naps in their nighttime were followed by much greater <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia</b> lasting up to an hour.|$|E
5000|$|Those {{who suffer}} from {{idiopathic}} hypersomnia have recurring episodes of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). These occur in spite of [...] "adequate, or more typically, extraordinary sleep amounts (e.g., greater than 10 hours per night)." [...] Sleep is usually deep, with significant difficulty arousing from sleep, even with use of several alarm clocks. In fact, patients with IH often must develop elaborate rituals to wake, as alarm clocks and even physical attempts by friends/family to wake them may fail. Despite getting more hours of sleep than typically required by the human body, patients awake unrefreshed and may also suffer <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia,</b> known more descriptively in its severe form as sleep drunkenness (significant disorientation upon awakening). Daytime naps are generally very long (up to several hours) and are also unrefreshing, {{as opposed to the}} short refreshing naps associated with narcolepsy. Sleep paralysis and hypnagogic hallucinations may also be seen, and these symptoms are as common in idiopathic hypersomnia as they are in narcolepsy without cataplexy.|$|E
50|$|Given {{the complex}} {{operations}} involved in aviation, avoiding fatigue is challenging. However, {{research suggests that}} planning strategies before and after flights can greatly improve pilot alertness and flight safety. The Aerospace Medical Association's Fatigue Countermeasures Subcommittee suggests hypnotics and other substances, some unregulated by the Food and Drug Administration, to maximize the quality of pilots' sleep before flights. The subcommittee's report revealed that the U.S. Air Force uses hypnotic drugs, such as temazepam, zolpidem, and zaleplon, for this purpose. However, since hypnotic drugs can cause <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia</b> upon waking, {{it is critical to}} consider the dosage given, the time of day, and the length of the sleep period. A non-medication approach involves healthy sleep practices, naps, exercise, and nutrition. The subcommittee suggested that the quality of sleep can be as important as the quantity, and that taking a nap before a night shift can increase pilot performance. In addition, proper exercise and nutrition help pilots maintain their physical health, which can reduce the negative effects of sleep loss.|$|E
40|$|Alcohol {{intoxication}} {{is known}} to considerably increase the probability of death from fire across the lifespan, {{to the extent that}} it has been isolated as the single most significant risk factor. The study investigated the combined effects of <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia</b> and alcohol impairment on fire emergency-relevant cognitive performance indicators in a young adult population. Mental tracking, visual scanning, psychomotor speed, working memory and sustained, selective, and divided attention functions were assessed for performance decrements and reference to speed-accuracy trade-off effects. Participants were 24 young adults (18 - 26 years) who participated in a repeated-measures study over 2 nonconsecutive nights; 1 night with alcohol administration and 1 ‘sober’ night. During the alcohol administration night, 10 -minute testing blocks occurred under (1) baseline sober and (2) baseline 0. 05 blood alcohol concentration (BAC) conditions. Subsequently, subjects were awoken from stage 4 sleep and assessed in two consecutive 10 -minute blocks (3) and (4). Self-reports of sleepiness and clearheadedness were also taken. The same procedure was used during the sober night (with condition (2) excluded). All cognitive functions assessed showed an alcohol effect (i. e., decrements between sober baseline (1) and conditions of alcohol (2)), and an even larger <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia</b> effect (i. e., greater decrements between sober baseline (1) and conditions of <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia</b> alone (3) and (4)). <b>Sleep</b> <b>inertia</b> selectively affected performance speed on the working memory task, whilst performance accuracy on this task was affected by conditions of alcohol impairment only. When the sober and alcohol nights were compared, there was no combined or synergistic interaction between <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia</b> and alcohol impairment on the cognitive tasks or subjective measures during the first 10 minutes of <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia.</b> Conditions of combined <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia</b> and alcohol impairment produced cognitiveperformance decrements that were greater than those produced by alcohol administrationalone, but not those produced by <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia</b> alone. Indeed, <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia</b> effectsappeared to ‘override’ alcohol effects. At 10 - 20 minutes post-awakening, however, sleepinertia effects began to dissipate, thus ‘unmasking’ alcohol effects on some tasks,including accuracy of working memory performance, selective/sustained attention and subjective sleepiness. Divided attention performance demonstrated a complex and unpredictable pattern at 10 - 20 minutes post-awakening whereby performance under conditions of <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia</b> and alcohol intoxication combined became significantly worse than either condition alone, indicating that alcohol effects were also possibly being unmasked for this measure. Other measures (speed of working memory performance and subjective clearheadedness) showed no difference between conditions at 10 - 20 minutes post-awakening. The results suggest that (1) moderate alcohol impairment and <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia</b> do not combine to produce further decrements in neurocognitive functioning than those caused by the effects of alcohol or <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia</b> alone and (2) <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia</b> poses a greater risk to fire emergency escape than moderate alcohol impairment. Moreover this data suggests that when awoken abruptly in an emergency situation, prior alcohol consumption to 0. 05 BAC will not further impede cognitive functioning that is already compromised by a state of <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia.</b> The study considers the importance of the arousing effects of task complexity, the BAC curve (particularly the descending limb), and speed-accuracy trade-off effects in predicting the effects of <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia</b> and alcohol on cognitive performance...|$|E
40|$|<b>Sleep</b> <b>inertia</b> {{refers to}} the period of reduced {{vigilance}} following upon awakening from sleep. To investigate {{the time course of}} <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia,</b> self-ratings of alertness and reaction time in a memory task were repeatedly assessed after nighttime and daytime sleep episodes in healthy young men. Alertness gradually increased and reaction time gradually decreased within the first hour after awakening. Their time course could be described by exponential functions with time constants of 0. 45 h and 0. 3 h, respectively. The data demonstrate that <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia</b> is a robust, quantifiable process that can be incorporated in models of sleep and vigilance...|$|E
40|$|<b>Sleep</b> <b>inertia</b> is the {{impaired}} {{cognitive performance}} immediately upon awakening, which decays over tens of minutes. This phenomenon has relevance {{to people who}} need to make important decisions soon after awakening, such as on-call emergency workers. Such awakenings can occur at varied times of day or night, so the objective {{of the study was to}} determine whether or not the magnitude of <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia</b> varies according to the phase of the endogenous circadian cycle. Twelve adults (mean, 24 years; 7 men) with no medical disorders other than mild asthma were studied. Following 2 baseline days and nights, subjects underwent a forced desynchrony protocol composed of seven 28 -h sleep/wake cycles, while maintaining a sleep/wakefulness ratio of 1 : 2 throughout. Subjects were awakened by a standardized auditory stimulus 3 times each sleep period for <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia</b> assessments. The magnitude of <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia</b> was quantified as the change in cognitive performance (number of correct additions in a 2 -min serial addition test) across the first 20 min of wakefulness. Circadian phase was estimated from core body temperature (fitted temperature minimum assigned 0 °). Data were segregated according to: (1) circadian phase (60 ° bins); (2) sleep stage; and (3) 3 rd of the night after which awakenings occurred (i. e., tertiary 1, 2, or 3). To control for any effect of sleep stage, the circadian rhythm of <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia</b> was initially assessed following awakenings from Stage 2 (62 % of awakening occurred from this stage; n = 110). This revealed a significant circadian rhythm in the <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia</b> of cognitive performance (p = 0. 007), which was 3. 6 times larger during the biological night (circadian bin 300 °, ~ 2300 – 0300 h in these subjects) than during the biological day (bin 180 °, ~ 1500 – 1900 h). The circadian rhythm in <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia</b> was still present when awakenings from all sleep stages were included (p = 0. 004), and this rhythm could not be explained by changes in underlying sleep drive prior to awakening (changes in sleep efficiency across circadian phase or across the tertiaries), or by the proportion of the varied sleep stages prior to awakenings. This robust endogenous circadian rhythm in <b>sleep</b> <b>inertia</b> may have important implications for {{people who need to}} be alert soon after awakening...|$|E
