He {{was allowed to}} bowl in competitive cricket under <b>supervision,</b> <b>bus</b> faces a life ban if his action is reported again. He has not bowled since the 2007/08 season. In the 2008 English cricket season, Hossain represented Chislehurst and West Kent Cricket Club in the Kent Cricket League in England.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The goal of {{this study}} was to provide {{national}} estimates of the frequency and cost of school injuries. METHODS: Six years of National Health Interview Survey data were used to estimate nonfatal injury incidence rates, multiple sources were used to estimate fatalities, and national highway crash data were used to estimate school bus injury incidence. RESULTS: Each year, 3. 7 million children suffer a substantial injury at school, resulting in an estimated $ 3. 2 billion in medical spending and $ 115 billion in good health lost. Nonschool fatalities greatly exceed school fatalities; from an incidence per hour perspective, however, school hours are no safer than nonschool hours despite greater formal <b>supervision.</b> School <b>bus</b> injuries account for half of school injury deaths but less than 1 % of total school injury costs. CONCLUSIONS: Nonfatal injury is a problem in schools. The concentration of injury at secondary schools suggests that interventions there may be most cost-effective. Data on school injury causes are greatly needed...|$|R
40|$|An {{advanced}} {{electronic system}} for future EVA missions (including zero gravity, the lunar surface, {{and the surface}} of Mars) is under research and development within the Advanced Life Support Division at NASA Ames Research Center. As {{a first step in}} the development, an optimum system architecture has been derived from an analysis of the projected requirements for these missions. The open, modular architecture centers around a distributed multiprocessing concept where the major subsystems independently process their own I/O functions and communicate over a common <b>bus.</b> <b>Supervision</b> and coordination of the subsystems is handled by an embedded real-time operating system kernel employing multitasking software techniques. A discussion of how the architecture most efficiently meets the electronic system functional requirements, maximizes flexibility for future development and mission applications, and enhances the reliability and serviceability of the system in these remote, hostile environments is included...|$|R

Outside influences such as weather, traffic, and road construction can wreak havoc on even the best laid plans. Internally, poor planning, insufficient maintenance, and differing operator abilities can work to undermine bus {{service reliability}}. To help counteract these problems, transit agencies typically deploy a team of supervisors who are responsible for monitoring, maintaining, and restoring reliable service. To do their job effectively, supervisors require high levels of operational information and a reliable communications system. These resources, however, can vary in their availability and may not be at ideal levels. This research proposes a framework to aid in the planning of <b>bus</b> <b>supervision</b> deployment given different levels of information, communications, and personnel. The primary focus of the framework is the deployment of post, mobile, and control center supervisors given an agency's current level of information and communication resources...|$|R

The primary focus of the framework is the deployment of post, mobile, and control center supervisors given an agency's current level of information and communication resources. The application of the framework begins with a service reliability and supervision resource assessment. (cont.) Based on these assessments, a system level personnel deployment strategy is developed and then evaluated. Two case studies - the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) Route 20 and the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) Silver Line - are presented as applications of the proposed framework. Findings suggest that personnel deployment at both agencies is suboptimal: both agencies deploy too many post supervisors given current resource levels, and for the CTA, too few mobile supervisors. Findings also suggest that putting increased information and communication resources in place should lead agencies to have post supervisors only at the busiest most critical locations, mobile supervisors for incident response and reallocate many field-based supervisors to the control center for headway and schedule management. by Christopher Allan Pangilinan.
