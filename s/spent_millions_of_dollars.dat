NISA is considered a professional Somali security force that can be relied upon to neutralize the terrorist threat.

25|$|In {{regards to}} San Francisco, some {{interesting}} negative externalities are being experienced {{due to the}} dredging of land by the Bay.

This has an extremely {{negative impact on the}} residents of this building, who have <b>spent</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> to live in this building. In response to this engineering travesty, San Francisco's city attorney has decided to file a lawsuit against the developer because the developer failed to inform the residents of the accelerated speed that the building was sinking at. If this lawsuit results in success for San Francisco this could lead to policy changes being made in the future surrounding transparency between developers and potential buyers of the developed land.|$|E

[...] Others who called {{for the establishment of a}} Confederate memorial there included William H.

500|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, the Philadelphia National Bank (PNB) needed {{to expand into}} a larger space than it {{currently}} occupied. On November 3, 1952, the bank bought the Lincoln-Liberty Building for US$8,750,000. PNB president Frederic A. Potts said, [...] "The purchase of this building will enable the Philadelphia National Bank more adequately and efficiently to support the large-scale industrial and commercial expansion under way in this city."

Among the changes was {{the addition of a}} sign with the bank's initials in 1955. The bank officially opened in what was now called the PNB Building on January 16, 1956. The opening included turning on a rooftop weather indicator and celebration of the 250th anniversary of Benjamin Franklin's birth.|$|E
500|$|The {{environmental}} group Friends of the River (FOR) {{was formed in}} the early 1970s to push a statewide ballot measure, Proposition 17, which would have designated [...] of the Stanislaus River between Stanislaus Powerhouse and Parrott's Ferry as a National Wild and Scenic River and stopped the construction of New Melones Dam. Development-related interests such as PG, the California Chamber of Commerce and the contractors working on the dam <b>spent</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> lobbying against Prop 17. One of their slogans, [...] "Stop the 'Wild River' Hoax!" [...] argued that {{this part of the}} Stanislaus River was not untouched wilderness (as dams already existed both upstream and downstream of the 9-mile segment) and therefore was ineligible for Wild and Scenic designation. This statement was misleading, since the language of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act does not disqualify rivers with dams â€“ only the portions already inundated by reservoirs. Dam supporters also argued that the Stanislaus River in its natural state was only accessible to a small group of people; that the rafting companies held a [...] "monopoly" [...] on river recreation and a reservoir would open up the area for far more tourists than would have visited otherwise, bringing more economic benefits to the area.|$|E

After Koons <b>spent</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> in legal fees over a five-year period pursuing parental rights to his young son, the Italian Supreme Court failed to recognize the couples' US-based joint custody agreement and instead sided with Staller.|$|E
2500|$|A former RCA {{facility}} in Taiwan's northern county of Taoyuan (now Taoyuan City) polluted groundwater with toxic chemicals {{and led to}} a high incidence of cancer among former employees.

25|$|Brown ended San Francisco's {{policy of}} {{punishing}} people for feeding the homeless. San Francisco continued {{to enforce its}} policy regarding {{the conduct of the}} homeless in public places. In 1998, Brown supported forcibly removing homeless people from Golden Gate Park and police crackdowns on the homeless for drunkenness, urinating, defecating, or sleeping on the sidewalk. Brown introduced job training programs and a $11 million drug treatment program. San Francisco, then the United States' 13th largest city, had the nation's third largest homeless population at a peak of 16,000. In November 1997, he requested nighttime helicopter searches in Golden Gate Park. The Brown administration <b>spent</b> hundreds <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> creating new shelters, supportive housing, and drug treatment centers to address homelessness, but these measures did not end San Franciscoâ€™s problem with homelessness.|$|R

In February 2007, Kelley Barracks was designated to house the Transition Team of United States Africa Command and became the permanent headquarters when the command was activated on October 1, 2008. Kelley Barracks was scheduled to close in 2009, but the Army has <b>spent</b> hundreds <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> upgrading the base for Africa Command, while telling Congress {{that it is just}} a temporary home.

2500|$|During the 2008 presidential {{election}} campaign, Senator Barack Obama advocated a full {{repeal of the}} laws barring gays and lesbians from serving in the military. Nineteen days after his election, Obama's advisers announced that plans to repeal the policy might be delayed until 2010, because Obama [...] "first wants to confer with the Joint Chiefs of Staff and his new political appointees at the Pentagon to reach a consensus, and then present legislation to Congress". As president he advocated a policy change to allow gay personnel to serve openly in the armed forces, stating that the U.S. government has <b>spent</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> replacing troops expelled from the military, including language experts fluent in Arabic, because of DADT. On {{the eve of the}} National Equality March in Washington, D.C., October 10, 2009, Obama stated in a speech before the Human Rights Campaign that he would end the ban, but he offered no timetable. Obama said in his 2010 State of the Union Address: [...] "This year, I will work with Congress and our military to finally repeal the law that denies gay Americans the right to serve the country they love because of who they are."

50|$|The Soviet Union's {{efforts in}} tank design and {{production}} {{must be understood}} {{in the context of}} the experience of the Russian Civil War and the growth of Soviet industry. During the civil war, the use of armoured trains and artillery trains was common. This tended to lead to a greater interest in tanks and armoured cars compared to some western nations. The rapid growth of heavy industry in the USSR under the Five-Year plans made a large tank fleet possible. The Soviets also <b>spent</b> tens <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> on U.S. equipment and technology to modernise dozens of automotive and tractor factories, which would later produce tanks and armoured vehicles.
