5|$|By the 1980s, Route 47 {{was moved}} from High Street to North Second Street through the {{northern}} part of Millville. An alternate route of Route 47 was eventually created to the east along county routes in Cape May and Cumberland counties; this eventually became Route 347 by the 1990s. In the 2000s, Rio Grande Avenue in Wildwood received improvements to make it reminisce the doo wop atmosphere the beach resort is known for. The Route 47 bridge over Dennis Creek in Dennis Township and the Route 83 intersection received improvements that were completed in July 2007. The Route 47 bridge over the creek was structurally deficient and in need of replacing. The job was completed with wider <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> wider sidewalk on the new bridge. The intersection between Route 47 and Route 83 was also realigned and had signals installed.|$|E

5|$|Abra, Kadabra, and Alakazam are bipedal Pokémon {{characterized}} by their humanoid body structure and somewhat fox-like appearance. They {{look like they}} are wearing armor, as they have two pauldron-shaped pieces on their <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> fauld-like piece around their chest. Abra, Kadabra, and Alakazam have three fingers on each hand and three toes on each foot, with two toes in the front on either side {{and one in the}} back near the ankle. Abra and Kadabra also have thick tails the same gold color as the rest of its body, except for a brown band located near the top. Kadabra and Alakazam have relatively large mustaches, which are shorter in female species. Kadabra has a red star-shaped symbol on its forehead, and three red wavy lines on its fauld-like torso. After evolving into Alakazam, the creatures no longer have the Zener markings and tails, while their heads become much larger, resulting in extremely powerful mental powers. Alakazam undergoes slight changes upon Mega Evolving into Mega Alakazam, as its overall color scheme becomes slightly paler, it gains a white beard alongside its now white mustache, a considerably thinner torso, and a red gem-like organ on its forehead.|$|E

25|$|Androgens, such as {{testosterone}} and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), are {{the major}} sex hormones in XY chromosomed individuals, and {{are responsible for the}} development and maintenance of masculine secondary sexual characteristics, such as a deep voice, broad <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> masculine pattern of hair, muscle, and fat distribution. In addition, they stimulate sex drive and the frequency of spontaneous erections and are responsible for acne, body odor, and masculine-pattern scalp hair loss. Androgens act by binding to and activating the androgen receptor (AR), their biological target in the body. In contrast to androgens, antiandrogens are drugs that prevent the effects of androgens in the body. They do this by preventing androgens from binding to the AR or by preventing the production of androgens. The most commonly used antiandrogens in transgender women are cyproterone acetate, spironolactone, and GnRH analogues.|$|E
25|$|Distinctive {{features}} include eyes {{that are very}} clear, of yellowish or amber hue, hindquarters as high or a trifle higher than the <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> double-coat that tends to wave on shoulders, neck, back, and loins. The waterproof coat feels slightly oily and {{is often associated with}} a slight musky odor. Three basic colors are generally seen in the breed: brown, which includes all shades from a light to a deep dark brown; sedge, which varies from a reddish yellow through a bright red to chestnut shades; and deadgrass in all its shades, varying from a faded tan to a dull straw color. The breed standard states that white may also appear but it must be limited to the breast, belly, toes, or back of the feet. The head is round and broad with a medium stop and muzzle. The lips are thin, and the ears are small and of medium leather. The forelegs should be straight with good bone. The hindquarters are especially strong and the toes webbed since excellent swimming ability is important for the Chesapeake. This breed is also known for its large and powerful chest, used to break apart ice when diving into cold water while duck hunting.|$|E

The bridegroom's dress in early times consisted of a short loincloth of hand-woven cloth (Dhoti), a shawl to cover his <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> red handkerchief on the head (Leis). Later, his dress consisted of a white loincloth with a red and gold hem (todop), a shirt with gold buttons and a coat (Kutanv), a shawl on the <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> towel (Urmal) on the head. The bridegroom wore a Chakrasar (neck chain) around his neck. He wore a pair of sandals or at least a pair of socks. At present, most Mangalorean Catholic couples opt for a White wedding, where the bridegroom wears a suit, while the bride wears a white wedding gown. The traditional style of wedding is becoming exceedingly rare.|$|E

500|$|Bonshō are sited in Buddhist temples, {{usually in}} a {{specially}} designated building or tower called a shōrō [...] They are used to mark the passage of time, and to call the monks to liturgical services. In Buddhism, the bell's sound {{is considered to be}} calming and to induce a suitable atmosphere for meditation. Because of their shape (with sloped <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> flat base) the bells are seen as representations of the sitting Buddha, and are accorded similar respect; those striking the bell will first make three bows towards it, just as they would before a statue of Buddha.|$|E

500|$|Fully mature {{adults are}} sexually dimorphic, with the male being larger and differing in colour from the female. The adult female is sandy-brown {{with a very}} light blue tail, and a pinkish buff bill.

These contrasting white feathers are especially highlighted in flight and ground displays in breeding season. The male in [...] plumage resembles the female, {{though it may be}} distinguished by its darker bill. Both sexes have long, slender, distinct tails held at an upward angle from their bodies. Measuring around , the tail feathers have a white fringe, which disappears with wear.|$|E
500|$|By {{contemporary}} accounts, d'Hautpoul {{was a big}} man, possibly {{taller than}} Joachim Murat, who was nearly six feet tall. Endowed with broad <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> big voice. He spoke {{the language of the}} common soldier, and led from the front. Early in the French Revolution, commissioners visited the various regiments to weed out dangerous, and prospectively traitorous nobles; generally, [...] the commissioners cowed the army into submission, but d'Hautpoul's cavalry regiment refused to be intimidated. When the commissioners came for their colonel, a scion of impoverished nobility, his soldiers refused to give him up: [...] "No d'Hautpoul, no 6th Chasseurs." [...] Thus, despite his noble birth, at the exhortations of his soldiers he remained in the French Revolutionary Army.|$|E
