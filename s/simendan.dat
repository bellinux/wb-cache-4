40|$|Levosimendan, {{the active}} {{enantiomer}} of <b>simendan,</b> is a calcium sensitizer developed {{for treatment of}} decompensated heart failure, exerts its effects independently of the beta adrenergic receptor and seems beneficial in cases of severe, intractable heart failure. Levosimendan is usually administered as 24 -h infusion, {{with or without a}} loading dose, but dosing needs adjustment in patients with severe liver or renal dysfunction. Despite several promising reports, the role of levosimendan in critical illness has not been thoroughly evaluated. Available evidence suggests that levosimendan is a safe treatment option in critically ill patients and may reduce mortality from cardiac failure. However, data from well-designed randomized controlled trials in critically ill patients are needed to validate or refute these preliminary conclusions. This literature review is an attempt to synthesize available evidence on the role and possible benefits of levosimendan in critically ill patients with severe heart failure...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: In {{this study}} we explicated early results of {{patients}} (the patients in whom levosimendan was used) who underwent {{coronary artery bypass graft}} surgery with ejection fraction 35 % or less. We compared this group with the patients in whom levo-simendan was not used. Material and Methods: 97 patients who have 35 % ejection fraction or less taken to isolated coronary artery bypass surgery between January 2009 and December 2011 in our clinic are chosen for this study retrospectively. We compared the patients in whom levosimendan was used with the patients in whom levosimendan was not used. Levo- <b>simendan</b> (Simdax, Abbott) has been used according to surgeon’s decision in patients. Results: The mean age of group 1 was 62. 3 ± 7. 6, and the mean age of group 2 was 59. 3 ± 10. 5 (p > 0. 05). It was detected that the average ejection fraction was less in group 1 (p 0. 05). It was found that need for blood transfusion were less in group 1 than group 2 (p 0. 05). Conclusion: We consider levosimendan reduces need for blood transfusion in coronary artery bypass graft surgery. This results may change with increasing number of patients so we consider that multicenter larger study is needed...|$|E
40|$|Background: The apical {{ballooning}} syndrome (ABS), {{also known}} as takotsubo cardiomyopathy and the broken heart syndrome, is an acute cardiac syndrome frequently precipitated by a stressful event. It has a clinical presentation that is indistinguishable from myocardial infarction (1). Patients commonly present with chest pain and dyspnea or with cardiogenic shock (prevalence, 2. 4 % to 7. 4 %) and ventricular fibrillation (prevalence, 0. 65 % to 3. 9 %) (2). Treatment is nonspecific. Objective: To report a patient with ABS complicated by cardio- genic shock who recovered after intravenous administration of levo- <b>simendan.</b> Case Report: A 68 -year-old woman with an unremarkable med- ical history {{was sent to the}} emergency department because of chest pain and worsening dyspnea. On arrival, she was intubated because of acute pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock. Initial electrocardiography demonstrated sinus rhythm with significant ST-segment elevation in leads V 3 to V 5, and urgent coronary angiography demonstrated fully patent coronary arteries. Ventriculography, however, demonstrated classic ABS with anteroapical akinesis and basal hyperkinesis. Levosimendan infusion was started at a standard dose for bolus injection of 12 g/kg per minute for 10 minutes followed by an infusion of 0. 1 g/kg per minute, with drastic improvement of clinical and hemodinamic status. Conclusion: Levosimendan seemed to lead to the recovery of our patient with ABS-induced cardiogenic shock. Further {{research is needed to determine}} whether it represents a safe treatment option for patients with the condition...|$|E
