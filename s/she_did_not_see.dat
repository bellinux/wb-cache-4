5|$|Hydra and {{her sisters}} saw heavy service with the Greek Navy. They participated in the GrecoTurkish War in 1897 until the Great Powers intervened and {{prevented}} the Greek Navy from capitalizing on their superiority over the Ottoman Navy. Hydra saw action in the First Balkan War at the Naval Battle of Elli and {{was present at the}} Naval Battle of Lemnos, but was too slow to actively engage the Ottoman forces. <b>She</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> action during World War I, and was reduced to a gunnery training ship {{after the end of the}} war.

5|$|In 1906, Lombardia was {{converted}} into a depot ship for submarines; this work lasted until 1908. By {{the outbreak of the}} Italo-Turkish War in September 1911, she was still serving in this capacity, under the command of Prince Luigi Amedeo, then the Inspector of Torpedo Boats. Lombardia remained in the Adriatic Sea during the war and as a result <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> action in the conflict. She served in this capacity through World War I until 4 July 1920, when she was sold for scrap and subsequently broken up.|$|E

5|$|The German fighters, many {{of which}} were short of fuel and ammunition, also broke off at about 4:25pm and {{returned}} to base. On the night of 9/10February, the German ships left Førde Fjord and continued their journey to Trondheim. A subsequent Allied attack on the ships by a different strike wing was also unsuccessful. Z33 arrived in Trondheim on 11February and was repaired. She subsequently departed for Germany on 26March and safely arrived in Swinemünde on 2 April. <b>She</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> any further combat, and was decommissioned at Brunsbüttel in late April as the Navy lacked the fuel needed to operate her.|$|E
5|$|Dresden was {{commissioned}} into service with the High Seas Fleet eight {{months before the}} end of World War I; as a result, her service career was limited and <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> action. She participated in a fleet operation to Norway to attack British convoys to Scandinavia, but they failed to locate any convoys and returned to port. Dresden was to have participated in a climactic sortie {{in the final days of}} the war, but a revolt in the fleet forced Admirals Reinhard Scheer and Franz von Hipper to cancel the operation. The ship was interned in Scapa Flow after the end of the war and scuttled with the fleet there on 21 June 1919, under orders from the fleet commander Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter.|$|E

5|$|Kapitän zur See (Captain at Sea) Hellmuth Heye {{was given}} {{command of the}} ship at her {{commissioning}}. After her commissioning in April 1939, Admiral Hipper steamed into the Baltic Sea to conduct training maneuvers. The ship also made port calls to various Baltic ports, including cities in Estonia and Sweden. In August, the ship conducted live fire drills in the Baltic. At the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, the ship was still conducting gunnery trials. She was briefly used to patrol the Baltic, but <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> combat, and was quickly returned to training exercises. In November 1939, the ship returned to the Blohm & Voss dockyard for modifications; these included {{the replacement of the}} straight stem with a clipper bow and the installation of the funnel cap.|$|E
5|$|Liguria {{served in}} a variety of roles {{throughout}} her career. She frequently was assigned to the main fleet, but in 1904 she was deployed to the American Station. In 1906, she conducted tests with coaling while at sea, and from 1908 to 1911, she was fitted with an experimental observation balloon. She saw extensive action during the Italo-Turkish War in 191112. She took part in the seizure of Benghazi, provided gunfire support to the defenders of Tripoli, and conducted bombardments of Ottoman ports in western Libya and the Red Sea coast of Arabia. She was still in service during World War I as a training ship, but <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> action during the conflict. Liguria was eventually sold for scrap in May 1921.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship had}} an eventful career. She was briefly {{assigned}} to the main fleet, but by the early 1890s, she was serving abroad in the Red Sea and Indian Ocean. In 1896 she was sent to Brazil to protect Italian nationals in the country after unrest in the country targeted Europeans. By 1901, Piemonte was {{assigned to the}} East Asia Station. By the outbreak of the Italo-Turkish War, the ship was again stationed in the Red Sea. She led a pair of destroyers in the Battle of Kunfuda Bay, where she sank or destroyed seven Ottoman gunboats, destroying Ottoman naval strength in the area. For the rest of the war, she blockaded and bombarded Ottoman ports. During World War I, she {{was assigned to the}} Second Fleet, based in Brindisi, but <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> action. Piemonte was sold for scrap in 1920.|$|E

5|$|The {{two ships}} {{served with the}} High Seas Fleet after {{entering}} service, with {{only one in the}} fleet at a time, usually trading service with the fleet either for refits or mine warfare training. After the start of World War I, the ships laid several minefields, both to protect the German coast and also to interfere with British naval operations. In 1915, Albatross was transferred to the Baltic Sea to operate against the Russian Baltic Fleet, where she was eventually ambushed by Russian cruisers and forced to beach in the Battle of Åland Islands in July. Nautilus took part in Operation Albion in 1917 and was rearmed in 1918 to support amphibious operations, but <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> action in that role.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Tenar does not become a wizard (like Ged) or a king (like Arren, the primary {{character}} of The Farthest Shore), Cummins argues that her growth is more revolutionary than either of theirs. In contrast to the male bildungsroman in which characters grow into the characteristics society believes they should have, Tenar's coming of age is a female bildungsroman, in which she must struggle against the patriarchal Kargish empire. She learns to value herself for herself and not simply {{for her role as}} a priestess. She is helped through this process by Ged, who sees her as a powerful person, and helps her find choices that <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>see.</b> Over the course of the story she realized that her true power is not her authority as the reincarnated high priestess, but the ability to make the choice to leave the labyrinth and the Tombs. Le Guin suggests that true power is not only about authority and mastery, but trust and collaboration.|$|E
5|$|España was {{the only}} member of the class {{completed}} by the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, though <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> action, as Spain remained neutral for the duration of the war. In August 1914, she participated in the opening ceremonies for the Panama Canal. Alfonso XIII joined her in August 1915 in the 1st Squadron of the Spanish fleet. In late 1921, Jaime I was finally completed. Throughout the early 1920s, the three ships served in the Training Squadron. During this period, Spain became involved in the Rif War in Morocco; all three ships saw action during the conflict, primarily by providing artillery support to Spanish ground forces engaging the Rif rebels. In August 1923, while bombarding Rif positions, España ran aground off Cape Tres Forcas. A lengthy salvage operation failed to free the ship, and in November 1924, the stress of repeated tidal battering broke the wreck in half.|$|E

5|$|Nautilus was {{transferred}} to the Baltic in 1916, and took part in Operation Albion in 1917, where she supported the conquest of the Gulf of Riga. In 1918, she was modified to support amphibious operations, with her 8.8cm guns replaced by a host of smaller weapons. She was assigned to the Sonderverband tasked with supporting the White Finns during the Finnish Civil War, though <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> action. Instead, she spent the remainder of the war patrolling in the eastern Baltic. After the war ended in November 1918, Nautilus was demilitarized according to the terms of the Treaty of Versailles and hulked; she was renamed Hulk I and later Hulk A, eventually being scrapped in 1928. Albatross, meanwhile, had been refloated by a Swedish salvage company in July 1915 and interned {{for the rest of the}} war. She was returned in 1919, stricken from the naval register and scrapped that year.|$|E
5|$|Other than {{participating}} in the Battle of Midway in June 1942, where <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> combat, the ship {{spent most of the}} first two years of the Pacific War training in home waters. She was transferred to Truk in mid-1943, but did not see any combat until the Battle of the Philippine Sea in mid-1944 when she was attacked by American aircraft. Nagato did not fire her main armament against enemy vessels until the Battle of Leyte Gulf in October 1944. She was lightly damaged during the battle and returned to Japan the following month. The IJN was running out of fuel by this time and decided not to fully repair her. Nagato was converted into a floating anti-aircraft platform and assigned to coastal defense duties. She was attacked in July 1945 as part of the American campaign to destroy the IJN's last remaining capital ships, but was only slightly damaged. In mid-1946, the ship was a target for nuclear weapon tests during Operation Crossroads. She survived the first test with little damage, but was sunk by the second.|$|E
5|$|Susan is {{identified}} as Mike's bride in the sixth season premiere. Her marriage to Mike destroys her friendship with Katherine. After the wedding, Julie is strangled outside of Susan's home. Julie slips into a coma following her attack. While {{waiting for her to}} awaken, Susan learns that Julie had dropped out of medical school, was involved with a married man, and had a pregnancy scare before her attack. When Julie awakens, she refuses to identify the married man she was seeing. Later in the season, Julie's attacker is revealed to be Eddie Orlofsky (Josh Zuckerman), a local young adult who is also responsible for a handful of murders in Fairview. Prior to the attack, Susan had taken Eddie on as an art student and he developed a crush on her. When he discovered that she was remarrying Mike and that <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> him as a romantic suitor, he attacked Julie, mistaking her for Susan.|$|E

5|$|Kratos {{falls into}} the River Styx, where he loses the Blade of Olympus; {{the souls of the}} Underworld weaken him and ruin the Blades of Athena. Climbing from the river, he is confronted by the spirit of Athena, who had {{previously}} sacrificed herself to save Zeus from Kratos. She tells Kratos that her sacrifice has brought her to a higher existence, and she now sees truths <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> before. She states that as long as Zeus reigns, there is no hope for mankind. She gives him the Blades of Exile and says that to kill Zeus, he must quench the Flame of Olympus. After finding the three Judges of the Underworld and the Chain of Balance, Kratos encounters the spirit of Pandora, whom he mistakes for his dead daughter, Calliope. Refusing to help the child, he continues his quest. After encountering the Olympian blacksmith Hephaestus and recovering the Blade of Olympus, he kills Hades, which releases the souls of the Underworld. When he considers searching for the soul of Calliope, Athena reminds Kratos of his quest, and he leaves the Underworld, arriving at Olympia. There he finds the wounded Gaia, who calls for help. He severs her arm, causing her to fall from Mount Olympus to her apparent death.|$|E
