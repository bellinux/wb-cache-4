25|$|The {{prototype}} XP-9, marked A 028-386, {{was first}} flown on 18 November 1930. It had impressive stats on the <b>specification</b> <b>sheet,</b> but {{it quickly became}} apparent that its large (6ft chord) wing, which was placed atop the fuselage {{directly in front of}} the pilot, obstructed downward visibility so badly that simple landing maneuvers were hazardous. Test pilots at the Army Test Centre at Wright Field found that the XP-9's inherent instability was so severe that immediate modifications were requested to increase the size of the vertical tail. An enlarged vertical tail surface with smooth metal skinning was introduced, but failed to effect any significant improvement, and this revised XP-9 was grounded for instructional airframe use in August 1931, after only 15 hours of test flying.|$|E
25|$|A cold-process soapmaker first {{looks up}} the {{saponification}} value for each unique fat on an oil <b>specification</b> <b>sheet.</b> Oil specification sheets contain laboratory test results for each fat, including the precise saponification {{value of the}} fat. The saponification value for a specific fat varies by season and by specimen species. This value {{is used to calculate}} the exact amount of sodium hydroxide to react with the fat to form soap. The saponification value must be converted into an equivalent sodium hydroxide value for use in cold process soapmaking. Excess unreacted lye in the soap results in a very high pH and can burn or irritate skin, whereas not enough lye leaves the soap greasy. Most soap makers formulate their recipes with a 2–5% deficit of lye, to account for the unknown deviation of saponification value between their oil batch and laboratory averages.|$|E

Findings - Findings are situated at several levels: the catalogue, the classification of robots with respect to their kinematic characteristics, a generic and specific <b>specifications</b> <b>sheet,</b> and an organigram to choose the most relevant structure from the specifications. Research limitations/implications - This structural synthesis represents a preliminary step in the design of medical robots which will be completed by an additional dimensional synthesis.

5000|$|Will Shortz {{does not}} write the Times crossword himself; the puzzles are {{submitted}} {{to him by}} {{a wide variety of}} contributors. A full <b>specification</b> <b>sheet</b> listing the paper's requirements for crossword puzzle submission can be found online (see [...] "External Links") or by writing to the paper. Aside from increasing in difficulty throughout the week, the Monday-Thursday puzzles and the Sunday puzzle always have a theme, some sort of connection between at least three long (usually Across) answers, such as a similar type of pun, letter substitution, or alteration in each entry. Another theme type is that of a humorous quotation broken up into symmetrical portions and spread throughout the grid. For example, the February 11, 2004, puzzle by Ethan Friedman featured a theme quotation: ANY IDIOT CAN FACE / A CRISIS IT'S THIS / DAY-TO-DAY LIVING / THAT WEARS YOU OUT. (this quote has been attributed to Anton Chekhov, but this attribution is in dispute and the specific source has not been identified). Notable dates such as holidays or anniversaries of famous events are often commemorated with an appropriately themed puzzle, although only two are currently commemorated on a routine annual basis: Christmas and April Fool's Day. The Friday and Saturday puzzles, the most difficult in the paper, are usually unthemed and [...] "wide open", with fewer black squares and more long words. The maximum word count for a themed weekday puzzle is normally 78 words, while the maximum for an unthemed Friday or Saturday puzzle is 72; Sunday puzzles must contain 140 words or fewer. Given the Times's reputation as a paper for a literate, well-read, and somewhat arty audience, puzzles frequently reference works of literature, art, or classical music, as well as modern TV, movies, or other touchstones of popular culture.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Today’s {{computer}} vision {{systems are not}} perfect. They fail frequently. Even worse, they fail abruptly and seemingly inexplicably. We argue that making our systems more transparent via an explicit human understandable characterization of their failure modes is desirable. We propose characterizing the failure modes of a vision system using semantic attributes. For example, a face recognition system may say “If the test image is blurry, or the face is not frontal, or the person to be recognized is a young white woman with heavy make up, I am likely to fail. ” This information can be used at training time by researchers to design better features, models or collect more focused training data. It {{can also be used}} by a downstream machine or human user at test time to know when to ignore the output of the system, in turn making it more reliable. To generate such a “specification sheet”, we discriminatively cluster incorrectly classified images in the semantic attribute space using L 1 -regularized weighted logistic regression. We show that our <b>specification</b> <b>sheets</b> can predict oncoming failures for face and animal species recognition better than several strong baselines. We also show that lay people can easily follow our <b>specification</b> <b>sheets.</b> ...|$|R
