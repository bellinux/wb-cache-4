50|$|Most {{battery voltage}} testers and {{chargers}} {{that can also}} test 9V need another <b>snap</b> <b>clip</b> to hold the battery, while cylindrical batteries often share a holder that may be adjustable in size. Because of {{the proximity of the}} positive and negative terminals {{at the top of the}} battery and relatively low current of most common batteries, one informal method of testing voltage is to place the two terminals across a tongue. A strong tingle would indicate a battery with a strong charge, the absence, a discharged battery. While there have been stories circulating of unfortunate outcomes, the process is rarely dangerous under normal circumstances, though it may be unpleasant.|$|E
50|$|Sidemount diving: Sidemount diving is the {{practice}} of diving with two or more cylinders secured {{at the sides of}} the body in line with the torso and without cylinders on the diver’s back. A common characteristic of the sidemount configuration is the use of bungee cords hooked over the cylinder valve to keep it tucked in close to the armpit. These bungees are normally routed from behind the diver’s upper back to a chest D-ring. The lower part of the cylinder is secured to the diver’s harness near the waist or hips by bolt <b>snaps</b> <b>clipped</b> to a butt-plate or waistband D-rings.|$|R
5000|$|Ring Bungee: The 'Ring Bungee' {{introduces}} a metal ring along the bungee length (in the armpit area). [...] This permits {{the use of}} a choker to connect tanks to the ring, making bungee wrapping of the cylinder valve/neck unnecessary. A popular configuration has the bolt snap connected to a ring by a quick link, with a length of bungee from the ring to another quick link which is used to connect the assembly to a D-ring {{on the back of the}} harness. The bolt <b>snap</b> is <b>clipped</b> to the shoulder D-ring and the cylinder neck bolt <b>snap</b> is <b>clipped</b> to the ring. The choker is used to minimise the distance the cylinder top can dangle away from the ring bungee.|$|R

40|$|Human {{dopamine}} D 2 {{long and}} D 3 receptors were modified by N-terminal addition of <b>SNAP</b> or <b>CLIP</b> forms of C 6 -alkylguanine-DNA-alkyltransferase plus a peptide epitope tag. Cells {{able to express}} each of these four constructs only upon addition of an antibiotic were established and used to confirm regulated and inducible control of expression, the specificity of <b>SNAP</b> and <b>CLIP</b> tag covalent labeling reagents, and based on homogenous time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer, the presence of cell surface D 2 long and D 3 receptor homomers. Following constitutive expression of reciprocal constructs, potentially capable of forming and reporting the presence of cell surface D 2 long -D 3 heteromers, individual clones were assessed for levels of expression of the constitutively expressed protomer. This was unaffected by induction of the partner protomer {{and the level of}} expression of the partner required to generate detectable cell surface D 2 long –D 3 heteromers was defined. Such homomers and heteromers were found to co-exist and using a reconstitution of function approach both homomers and heteromers of D 2 long and D 3 receptors were shown to be functional, potentially via trans-activation of associated G protein. These studies demonstrate the ability of dopamine D 2 long and D 3 receptors to form both homomers and heteromers, and show that in cells expressing each subtype a complex mixture of homomers and heteromers co-exists at steady state. These data are of potential importance both to disorders in which D 2 long and D 3 receptors are implicated, like schizophrenia and Parkinson disease, and also to drugs exerting their actions via these sites...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe {{visualization}} of complex cellular processes involving multiple proteins requires {{the use of}} spectroscopically distinguishable fluorescent reporters. We have previously introduced the SNAP-tag as a general tool for the specific labeling of SNAP-tag fusion proteins in living cells. The SNAP-tag is derived from the human DNA repair protein O 6 -alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT) and can be covalently labeled in living cells using O 6 -benzylguanine derivatives bearing a chemical probe. Here we report the generation of an AGT-based tag, named CLIP-tag, which reacts specifically with O 2 -benzylcytosine derivatives. Because SNAP-tag and CLIP-tag possess orthogonal substrate specificities, <b>SNAP</b> and <b>CLIP</b> fusion proteins can be labeled simultaneously and specifically with different molecular probes in living cells. We furthermore show simultaneous pulse-chase experiments to visualize different generations of two different proteins in one sample...|$|R
5000|$|The lead shank {{consists}} of a lead, usually a flat line, with a chain end, or, less often, thin nylon or rope. The chain end ranges from 18 to 30 in long and has a <b>snap</b> or <b>clip</b> on the end that attaches to the halter, and a ring {{on the other end}} that is attached to the lead line. [...] Some lead lines are permanently sewn to the chain shank, others have buckles or clips allowing the chain to be removed. Lead shanks are usually used on potentially difficult or dangerous horses, such as stallions or those that, for various reasons, will not respond to a regular lead. For this reason, in some regions, lead shanks are sometimes called [...] "stud chains." [...] They are also commonly seen on in-hand horses of all ages and sexes at some horse shows, as the chain shank {{can also be used to}} transmit commands quickly but inobtrusively, encouraging a prompt response from the horse.|$|R
2500|$|Sometimes called [...] "tube", [...] "pocket" [...] or [...] "ringless" [...] slings, {{these are}} {{generally}} formed {{by a wide}} piece of fabric sewn into a tubular shape. Simple, or fitted pouches do not have rings or other hardware. Adjustable pouches may adjust with zippers, <b>snaps,</b> buckles, <b>clips,</b> rings, drawstrings, velcro, and other methods. Most pouches have a curve sewn in to shape the cloth to the parent's body and hold the baby more securely than a simple straight tube. The wearer slips the pouch over the head and one shoulder, sash-style, creating a pocket or seat to hold the baby in. Many pediatricians and baby-wearing experts do not recommend pouch slings because babies can suffocate when held incorrectly. Suffocation risk is greatest in newborns and infants under six months, and usually occurs because the baby's chin is collapsed against his or her chest, constricting the airway. Pouch slings also often restrict the parent's view of their child, making suffocation more likely. When using a pouch sling, wearers should {{be sure to keep}} the baby's face elevated and clearly visible.|$|R
50|$|One common halter {{design is}} made of either flat nylon webbing or flat leather, has a noseband that passes around the muzzle with one ring under the jaw, usually used to attach a lead rope, and two rings {{on either side of}} the head. The noseband is usually {{adjusted}} to lie about halfway between the end of the cheekbones and the corners of the mouth, crossing over the strong, bony part of the face. The noseband connects to a cheekpiece on either side that go up next to the cheekbone to meet with a ring on either side that usually is placed just above the level of the eye. These rings meet the throatlatch and the crownpiece. The crownpiece is a long strap on the right-hand side of the halter that goes up behind the ears, over the poll and is buckled to a shorter strap coming up from the left. The throatlatch goes under the throat, and sometimes has a <b>snap</b> or <b>clip</b> that allows the halter to be removed in a manner similar to the bridle. Many halters have another short strap connecting the noseband and the throatlatch.|$|R
40|$|As one of {{the toxic}} {{by-product}} of aerobic metabolism, hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2), at uncontrolled levels and distributions, {{is a sign of}} oxidative stress, aging and disease. However, H 2 O 2 also plays an essential part in normal physiological system. H 2 O 2 levels are regulated by many enzymes and metabolites that generate or break-down H 2 O 2. In macrophages, the presence of invading pathogens activates the production of microbicidal levels of H 2 O 2 by NADPH oxidase (Nox). Isoforms of Nox are expressed in many non-phagocytic cells and tissues. Nox-generated H 2 O 2 is a secondary messenger involved in signaling for growth, proliferation, differentiation and controlled cell death; these variations in downstream biological effects are regulated by both the spatial and temporal production of H 2 O 2. Small molecule fluorescent probes bearing boronate ester moieties have been developed for chemoselective detection of H 2 O 2 in both oxidative stress levels and cellular signaling events. This dissertation describes the design, synthesis, characterization and application of new boronate-based fluorescent probes with added functionality. Peroxy-Lucifer- 1 (PL 1) and Peroxy-Naphthalene- 1 (PN 1) are ratiometric fluorescent probes that can detect oxidative bursts in immune response events. Ratiometric probes allow simultaneous detection of two signals from the reacted and unreacted probes in the same sample, providing a built-in correction for variations such as uneven probe loading, sample environment and detection efficiency. PN 1 also has a high two-photon cross section. The increased penetration depth of near-infrared excitation light allows the detection of H 2 O 2 in tissue specimens with PN 1. SNAP-Peroxy-Green- 1 (SPG 1) and SNAP-Peroxy-Green- 2 (SPG 2) are capable of detecting local concentration of H 2 O 2 in subcellular compartments such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, nucleus, and plasma membrane. The precise localization of probes to the targeted organelle is facilitated by highly specific recognition of the SNAP ligand bound to the probe by the SNAP fusion protein. Furthermore, simultaneous detection of H 2 O 2 at two different locations is feasible by using a SNAP tag with an orthogonal CLIP tag; such combined use of <b>SNAP</b> and <b>CLIP</b> tags is assisted by the expanding color palette of <b>SNAP</b> and <b>CLIP</b> peroxy probes. Multi-modal probes using PAMAM-G 5 dendrimer platform was developed for the real-time imaging of the interplay between H 2 O 2 and other physiological events. Coordination of the oxidative burst and progressive acidification in phagosomes of macrophages was elucidated with G 5 -SNARF 2 -PF 1 -Ac, a nanoprobe decorated with the H 2 O 2 sensing module PF 1 and pH sensor SNARF 2...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{significant}} {{advantage of}} continuous-fiber-reinforced thermoplastics (composite sheets) compared with sheet steel or aluminum {{is that the}} forming process can be integrated directly into the injection molding process. To do so, the composite sheet is heated by contact or infrared heating to a suitable temperature, then formed with the closing stroke of the injection molding tool, and subsequently back molded. In this way {{it is possible to}} achieve a high level of functional integration, because functional elements such as <b>snap</b> hooks and <b>clips</b> can be directly integrated as part of the molded component without the need for any additional process steps after finishing the part.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Many G protein-coupled receptors {{internalize}} following agonist binding. The {{studies were}} designed to identify novel means to effectively quantify this process using the orexin OX 1 receptor and the cannabinoid CB 1 receptor as exemplars. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH The human OX 1 and CB 1 receptors were modified to incorporate both epitope tags and variants (<b>SNAP</b> and <b>CLIP)</b> of the enzyme O 6 -alkylguanine-DNA-alkyltransferase within their extracellular, N-terminal domain. Cells able to regulate expression of differing amounts of these constructs upon addition of an antibiotic were developed and analysed. KEY RESULTS Cell surface forms of each receptor construct were detected by both antibody recognition of the epitope tags and covalent binding of fluorophores to the O 6 -alkylguanine-DNA-alkyltransferase variants. Receptor internalization in response to agonists but not antagonists could be monitored by each approach but sensitivity was up to six- to 10 -fold greater than other approaches when employing a novel, time-resolved fluorescence probe for the SNAP tag. Sensitivity was not enhanced, however, for the CLIP tag, possibly due {{to higher levels of}} nonspecific binding. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS These studies demonstrate that highly sensitive and quantitative assays that monitor cell surface CB 1 and OX 1 receptors and their internalization by agonists can be developed based on introduction of variants of O 6 -alkylguanine-DNA-alkyltransferase into the N-terminal domain of the receptor. This should be equally suitable for other G protein-coupled receptors. </p...|$|R
40|$|While {{antibodies}} currently play {{a dominant}} role as affinity reagents in biological research and for diagnostics, {{a broad range}} of recombinant proteins are emerging as promising alternative affinity reagents in detection assays and quantification. DNA-mediated affinity-based assays, such as immuno-PCR and proximity ligation assays (PLA), use oligonucleotides attached to affinity reagents as reporter molecules. Conjugation of oligonucleotides to affinity reagents generally employs chemistries that target primary amines or cysteines. Because of the random nature of these processes neither the number of oligonucleotides conjugated per molecule nor their sites of attachment can be accurately controlled for affinity reagents with several available amines and cysteines. Here, we present a straightforward and convenient approach to functionalize recombinant affinity reagents for PLA by expressing the reagents as fusion partners with SNAP protein tags. This allowed us to conjugate oligonucleotides in a site-specific fashion, yielding precisely one oligonucleotide per affinity reagent. We demonstrate this method using designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins) recognizing the tumor antigen HER 2 and we apply the conjugates in different assay formats. We also show that <b>SNAP</b> or <b>CLIP</b> tags, expressed as fusion partners of transfected genes, allow oligonucleotide conjugations to be performed in fixed cells, with no need for specific affinity reagents. The approach is used to demonstrate induced interactions between the fusion proteins FKBP and FRB by allowing the in situ conjugated oligonucleotides to direct the production of templates for localized rolling circle amplification reactions...|$|R
40|$|Muscarinic {{acetylcholine}} receptors (M 1 -M 5) {{belong to}} the class A family of transmembrane G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and mediate various signalling processes. M 1, M 3 and M 5 predominantly couple to Gq and promote intracellular calcium ion release from the endoplasmic reticulum. M 2 and M 4 preferentially couple Gi inhibiting adenylyl cyclase activity to thus decrease cAMP production and acting to regulate various ion channels. There is growing evidence that many GPCRs can exist as dimers or higher-order oligomers (Milligan, 2013) and muscarinic receptors are no exception (Alvarez-Curto et al., 2010). Herein, combinations of homomers and heteromers of co-expressed human M 2 (hM 2 WT) and a RASSL (Receptor Activated Solely by Synthetic Ligand) form of the human M 3 receptor (hM 3 RASSL) (Alvarez-Curto et al., 2011) were demonstrated to occur using N-terminal <b>SNAP</b> and <b>CLIP</b> tags in combination with homogeneous time resolved FRET (htrFRET). Stable Flp-In™ T-REx™ 293 cell lines able to inducibly express each of these receptor forms upon addition of doxycycline, and a cell line able to express both the hM 3 RASSL constitutively and hM 2 WT in a doxycycline inducible manner were generated. In these cells both hM 3 RASSL and hM 2 WT were detected after treatment with different concentrations of doxycycline via Western blots using tag-specific antibodies. Radioligand binding using [3 H]-QNB indicated that similar amounts of hM 2 WT and hM 3 RASSL were expressed following induction with 5 ng. ml- 1 doxycycline in the cells co-expressing the two receptors. Expression of the receptors was observed at the surface of live cells following labelling of the expressed receptors with SNAP and CLIP-specific cell impermeant substrates. Following induction with doxycycline each of hM 2 WT and hM 3 RASSL homomers and hM 2 WT-hM 3 RASSL heteromers were identified. Detection of oligomers was achieved following co-labelling with htrFRET-compatible substrates. Occupancy of hM 2 WT-hM 3 RASSL heteromers with the hM 2 WT agonist carbachol resulted in a marked, time and concentration-dependent decrease in detected heteromers and a concomitant, concentration-dependent increase in hM 2 WT homomers. The dynamics of interchange between heteromers and homomers was investigated by using a multiplex labelling approach and htrFRET. This method involved labelling with one energy donor and two energy acceptors capable of emitting at distinct wavelengths. Results confirmed the hM 2 WT-hM 3 RASSL heteromer to hM 2 WT homomer transition upon selective carbachol-mediated activation of hM 2 WT. A small increase in the hM 3 RASSL homomer was detected upon activation of the hM 3 RASSL with the selective agonist clozapine-N-oxide, but this was only observed {{in the absence of}} heteromers. Despite the presence of hM 2 WT-hM 3 RASSL heteromers the functional pharmacology of hM 2 WT and hM 3 RASSL receptor specific agonists was largely unaltered...|$|R
40|$|Labeling and {{visualizing}} {{cells and}} subcellular structures within thick tissues, whole organs and even intact animals {{is key to}} studying biological processes. This is particularly true for studies of neural circuits where neurons form submicron synapses but have arbors that may span millimeters in length. Traditionally, labeling is achieved by immunofluorescence; however diffusion of antibody molecules (> 100 kDa) is slow and often results in uneven labeling with very poor penetration into the centre of thick specimens; these limitations can be partially addressed by extending staining protocols to over a week (Drosophila brain) and months (mice). Recently we developed an alternative approach using genetically encoded chemical tags <b>CLIP,</b> <b>SNAP,</b> Halo and TMP for tissue labeling; this resulted in > 100 fold increase in labeling speed in both mice and Drosophila, {{at the expense of}} a considerable drop in absolute sensitivity when compared to optimized immunofluorescence staining. We now present a second generation of UAS and LexA responsive CLIPf, SNAPf and Halo chemical labeling reagents for flies. These multimerized tags, with translational enhancers, display up to 64 fold increase in sensitivity over first generation reagents. In addition we developed a suite of conditional reporters (4 xSNAPf tag and CLIPf-SNAPf-Halo 2) that are activated by the DNA recombinase Bxb 1. Our new reporters can be used with weak and strong GAL 4 and LexA drivers and enable stochastic, intersectional and multicolor Brainbow labeling. These improvements in sensitivity and experimental versatility, while still retaining the substantial speed advantage that is a signature of chemical labeling, should significantly increase the scope of this technology.
