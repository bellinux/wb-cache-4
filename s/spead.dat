With this she didn't only antagonize the Empire's judiciary but also the association of doctors and especially ecclesiastic circles. Repeatedly she was prosecuted for „offense of public nuisance“.

50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, hip hop spread to Italy through Posse cuts, which were popular in centri sociali, {{alternative}} centers where several left-wing young people regularly met, {{and where the}} extremely influential Italian hardcore punk scene was flourishing, from which the Italian Posse Cut movement inherited its social conscious. The first star to emerge from this scene was Jovanotti, who would rap in otherwise standard Italian pop. While Jovanotti was discovered by the famous producer Claudio Cecchetto and quickly reached fame, in the underground Radical Stuff published the first Italian hip hop street video Let's Get Dizzy featuring lo Greco Bros in 1989. Also that year Marko Von Schoenberg of Stone Castle Records in Italy produced Dre' n OG along with Andre Herring (now known as the King of Art) and Nathaniel Goodwin, with songs such as Ak-47, Got Damn, Do Beat and <b>Spead</b> Your Legs. In 1991 the Posse Cut movement produced its first underground rap in the Italian language, with tracks such as Stop al Panico by Isola Posse All Star, a track against murders and violence in the streets.|$|E

With high transport costs, industry is <b>spead</b> across regions to meet final consumer demad. As transport costs fall, increasing returns interacting with labour mobility and/or inout-output linkages between firms create a tendency for the agglomeration of increasing returns activities. When workers migrate towards locations with more firms and higher real wages, this intensifies agglomeration. When instead workers do not move across regions, further reductions in transport costs make firms increasingly sensitive to wage differentials, leading industry to spread out again. ...|$|E
