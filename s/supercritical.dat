5|$|At a {{barometric}} pressure of 218 atmospheres, the critical point {{of water is}} 375°C. At a depth of 3,000meters, the {{barometric pressure}} of sea water is more than 300atmospheres (as salt water is denser than fresh water). At this depth and pressure, seawater becomes <b>supercritical</b> at a temperature of 407°C (see image). However the increase in salinity at this depth pushes the water closer to its critical point. Thus, water emerging from the hottest parts of some hydrothermal vents, black smokers and submarine volcanoes can be a <b>supercritical</b> fluid, possessing physical properties between those of a gas and those of a liquid.|$|E
5|$|A rare but {{important}} terrain feature {{found in the}} abyssal and hadal zones is the hydrothermal vent. In contrast to the approximately 2°C ambient water temperature at these depths, water emerges from these vents at temperatures ranging from 60°C up to as high as 464°C. Due to the high barometric pressure at these depths, water may exist in either its liquid form or as a <b>supercritical</b> fluid at such temperatures.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, Houston Lighting and Power began {{construction}} on two 450 MW electric generating units in Bacliff {{as part of}} the company's Project Enterprise expansion. The units were of <b>supercritical</b> boiler design, which was then a new technology. The power plant, originally known as the Bacliff Plant, was renamed the P. H. Robinson plant, in honor of company president Perk H. Robinson.|$|E
5|$|Above {{the layer}} of {{metallic}} hydrogen lies a transparent interior atmosphere of hydrogen. At this depth, the pressure and temperature are above hydrogen's critical pressure of 1.2858 MPa and critical temperature of only 32.938K. In this state, there are no distinct liquid and gas phases—hydrogen {{is said to be}} in a <b>supercritical</b> fluid state. It is convenient to treat hydrogen as gas in the upper layer extending downward from the cloud layer to a depth of about 1,000km, and as liquid in deeper layers. Physically, there is no clear boundary—the gas smoothly becomes hotter and denser as one descends.|$|E
5|$|Dragonflies {{generate}} lift in {{at least}} four ways at different times, including classical lift like an aircraft wing; <b>supercritical</b> lift with the wing above the critical angle, generating high lift and using very short strokes to avoid stalling; creating vortices; and vortex shedding. Some families appear to use special mechanisms, as for example the Libellulidae which take off rapidly, their wings beginning pointed far forward and twisted almost vertically. Dragonfly wings behave highly dynamically during flight, flexing and twisting during each beat. Among the variables are wing curvature, length and speed of stroke, angle of attack, forward/back position of wing, and phase relative to the other wings.|$|E
5|$|Experimental mercury vapor {{turbines}} {{were installed}} {{to increase the}} efficiency of fossil-fuel electrical power plants. The South Meadow power plant in Hartford, CT employed mercury as its working fluid, in a binary configuration with a secondary water circuit, {{for a number of years}} starting in the late 1920s in a drive to improve plant efficiency. Several other plants were built, including the Schiller Station in Portsmouth, NH, which went online in 1950. The idea did not catch on industry-wide due to the weight and toxicity of mercury, as well as the advent of <b>supercritical</b> steam plants in later years.|$|E
5|$|In May 2007, Npower {{announced}} {{plans to build a}} new £2billion clean coal power station on the site. The proposed station would have generated electricity using three 800MW advanced <b>supercritical</b> steam, high-efficiency coal-fired units, giving the station a total generation capacity of 2,400MW. This was one of two new coal-fired stations proposed by Npower in the UK. The site was chosen because of its readily available proximity to the national grid, its rail and port links, and its position next to the North Sea, which is useful for both cooling water, and as a potential CO2 storage site, where CO2 could be piped to oil and gas wells, and saline aquifers.|$|E
5|$|The Boeing 757 is a mid-size, narrow-body {{twin-engine}} jet airliner {{that was}} designed and built by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. It is the manufacturer's largest single-aisle passenger aircraft and was produced from 1981 to 2004. The twinjet has a two-crew member glass cockpit, turbofan engines of sufficient power to allow takeoffs from relatively short runways and higher altitudes, a conventional tail and, for reduced aerodynamic drag, a <b>supercritical</b> wing design. Intended to replace the smaller three-engine 727 on short and medium routes, the 757 can carry 200 to 295 passengers for a maximum of , depending on variant. The 757 was designed concurrently with a wide-body twinjet, the 767, and owing to shared features pilots can obtain a common type rating {{that allows them to}} operate both aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The Boeing 767 is a mid- to large-size, mid- to long-range, {{wide-body}} twin-engine jet airliner {{built by}} Boeing Commercial Airplanes. It was Boeing's first wide-body twinjet and its first airliner with a two-crew glass cockpit. The aircraft has two turbofan engines, a conventional tail, and, for reduced aerodynamic drag, a <b>supercritical</b> wing design. Designed as a smaller wide-body airliner than earlier aircraft {{such as the}} 747, the 767 has seating capacity for 181 to 375 people, and a design range of , depending on variant. Development of the 767 occurred in tandem with a narrow-body twinjet, the 757, resulting in shared design features which allow pilots to obtain a common type rating to operate both aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Chadwick voiced {{concerns}} {{about the need for}} such pure plutonium to make a feasible bomb. He also suspected that the gun method of detonation for a plutonium bomb would lead to premature detonations due to impurities. After Chadwick met Robert Oppenheimer at the Los Alamos Laboratory in 1943, he learned of a proposed bomb design which they were calling an implosion. The sub-critical mass of plutonium was supposed to be surrounded by explosives that were arranged to detonate simultaneously. This would cause the plutonium core to be compressed and become <b>supercritical.</b> The core would be surrounded by a depleted uranium tamper which would reflect the neutrons back into the reaction, and contribute to the explosion by fissioning itself. This design solved Chadwick's worries about purity because it did not require the level that would be needed for the gun-type fission weapon. The biggest problem with this method was creating the explosive lenses. Chadwick took this information with him and described the method to Oliphant who then took it with him to England.|$|E

25|$|<b>Supercritical</b> drying is {{a method}} of {{removing}} solvent without surface tension effects. As a liquid dries, the surface tension drags on small structures within a solid, causing distortion and shrinkage. Under <b>supercritical</b> conditions there is no surface tension, and the <b>supercritical</b> fluid can be removed without distortion. <b>Supercritical</b> drying is used for manufacture of aerogels and drying of delicate materials such as archeological samples and biological samples for electron microscopy. Carbon Dioxide {{is used as a}} <b>supercritical</b> solvent in some dry cleaning processes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Supercritical</b> water {{oxidation}} uses <b>supercritical</b> {{water as}} a medium in which to oxidize hazardous waste, eliminating production of toxic combustion products that burning can produce.|$|E
25|$|<b>Supercritical</b> water {{gasification}} is {{a process}} of exploiting the beneficial effect of <b>supercritical</b> water to convert aqueous biomass streams into clean water and gases like H2, CH4, CO2, CO etc.|$|E
25|$|The {{advantages}} of <b>supercritical</b> fluid extraction (compared with liquid extraction) {{are that it}} is relatively rapid because of the low viscosities and high diffusivities associated with <b>supercritical</b> fluids. The extraction can be selective to some extent by controlling {{the density of the}} medium, and the extracted material is easily recovered by simply depressurizing, allowing the <b>supercritical</b> fluid to return to gas phase and evaporate leaving little or no solvent residues. Carbon dioxide is the most common <b>supercritical</b> solvent. It is used on a large scale for the decaffeination of green coffee beans, the extraction of hops for beer production, and the production of essential oils and pharmaceutical products from plants. A few laboratory test methods include the use of <b>supercritical</b> fluid extraction as an extraction method instead of using traditional solvents.|$|E
25|$|In general terms, <b>supercritical</b> fluids have {{properties}} {{between those}} of a gas and a liquid. In Table 1, the critical properties are shown for some components, which are commonly used as <b>supercritical</b> fluids.|$|E
25|$|<b>Supercritical</b> fluids {{act as a}} {{new media}} for the {{generation}} of novel crystalline forms of APIs (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients) named as pharmaceutical cocrystals. <b>Supercritical</b> fluid technology offers a new platform that allows a single-step generation of particles that are difficult or even impossible to obtain by traditional techniques. The generation of pure and dried new cocrystals (crystalline molecular complexes comprising the API and one or more conformers in the crystal lattice) can be achieved due to unique properties of SCFs by using different <b>supercritical</b> fluid properties: <b>supercritical</b> CO2 solvent power, anti-solvent effect and its atomization enhancement.|$|E
25|$|<b>Supercritical</b> fluids, {{although}} not liquids, do share various properties with liquids. Underneath the thick atmospheres {{of the planets}} Uranus and Neptune, {{it is expected that}} these planets are composed of oceans of hot high-density fluid mixtures of water, ammonia and other volatiles. The gaseous outer layers of Jupiter and Saturn transition smoothly into oceans of <b>supercritical</b> hydrogen. The atmosphere of Venus is 96.5% carbon dioxide, which is a <b>supercritical</b> fluid at its surface.|$|E
25|$|A <b>supercritical</b> airfoil is an airfoil designed, primarily, {{to delay}} the onset of wave drag on {{aircraft}} in the transonic speed range. <b>Supercritical</b> airfoils are characterized by their flattened upper surface, highly cambered aft section, and greater leading edge radius as compared to traditional airfoil shapes. The <b>supercritical</b> airfoil was invented and designed by NASA aeronautical engineer Richard Whitcomb in the 1960s. Testing successfully commenced on a United States Navy Vought F-8U fighter through wind tunnel results in 1971.|$|E
25|$|The {{formation}} of small particles of a substance {{with a narrow}} size distribution is an important process in the pharmaceutical and other industries. <b>Supercritical</b> fluids provide {{a number of ways}} of achieving this by rapidly exceeding the saturation point of a solute by dilution, depressurization or a combination of these. These processes occur faster in <b>supercritical</b> fluids than in liquids, promoting nucleation or spinodal decomposition over crystal growth and yielding very small and regularly sized particles. Recent <b>supercritical</b> fluids have shown the capability to reduce particles up to a range of 5-2000nm.|$|E
25|$|The {{first task}} {{of a nuclear}} weapon design is to rapidly {{assemble}} a <b>supercritical</b> mass of fissile uranium or plutonium. A <b>supercritical</b> mass {{is one in which}} the percentage of fission-produced neutrons captured by another fissile nucleus is large enough that each fission event, on average, causes more than one additional fission event.|$|E
25|$|<b>Supercritical</b> {{carbon dioxide}} (SCD) {{can be used}} instead of PERC (perchloroethylene) or other {{undesirable}} solvents for dry-cleaning. <b>Supercritical</b> carbon dioxide sometimes intercalates into buttons, and, when the SCD is depressurized, the buttons pop, or break apart. Detergents that are soluble in carbon dioxide improve the solvating power of the solvent.|$|E
25|$|<b>Supercritical</b> fluid extraction: A {{relatively}} new technique for extracting fragrant compounds from a raw material, which often employs <b>Supercritical</b> CO2. Due {{to the low}} heat of process and the relatively nonreactive solvent used in the extraction, the fragrant compounds derived often closely resemble the original odor of the raw material.|$|E
25|$|<b>Supercritical</b> {{hydrolysis}} is {{a method}} of converting all biomass polysaccharides as well the associated lignin into low molecular compounds by contacting with water alone under <b>supercritical</b> conditions. The <b>supercritical</b> water, acts as a solvent, a supplier of bond-breaking thermal energy, a heat transfer agent and {{as a source of}} hydrogen atoms. All polysaccharides are converted into simple sugars in near-quantitative yield in a second or less. The aliphatic inter-ring linkages of lignin are also readily cleaved into free radicals that are stabilized by hydrogen originating from the water. The aromatic rings of the lignin are unaffected under short reaction times so that the lignin-derived products are low molecular weight mixed phenols. To take advantage of the very short reaction times needed for cleavage a continuous reaction system must be devised. The amount of water heated to a <b>supercritical</b> state is thereby minimized.|$|E
25|$|In <b>supercritical</b> water medium, the {{oxidation}} can {{be effectively}} catalyzed by MnBr2 with pure O2 in a medium-high temperature. Use of <b>supercritical</b> water instead of acetic acid as a solvent diminishes environmental impact {{and offers a}} cost advantage. However, the scope of such reaction systems {{is limited by the}} even harsher conditions than the industrial process (300−400°C, >200bar).|$|E

25|$|Dima Bolmatov, V. V. Brazhkin and K. Trachenko {{discovered}} that specific heat shows a crossover between two different dynamic regimes of the low-temperature rigid-liquid and high temperature non-rigid gas-like fluid. Rigid liquids are rigid like a solid on short time scales, but flow like a liquid on long time scales; while a <b>supercritical</b> gas-like fluid has the dynamic motions {{of a gas}} but is able to dissolve materials, like a liquid. The crossover challenges the currently held belief that no difference can be made between a gas and a liquid above the critical point and that the <b>supercritical</b> state is homogeneous in terms of physical properties. Bolmatov and colleagues formulated a theory of system thermodynamics and heat capacity above the crossover. In that theory, energy and heat capacity are governed by the minimal length of the longitudinal mode in the system only, and do not depend on system-specific structure and interactions. Bolmatov and colleagues predicted relationship between <b>supercritical</b> exponents of heat capacity and viscosity and derived a power law for the <b>supercritical</b> state.|$|E

25|$|<b>Supercritical</b> {{water can}} be used to {{decompose}} biomass via <b>supercritical</b> water gasification of biomass. This type of biomass gasification {{can be used to}} produce hydrocarbon fuels for use in an efficient combustion device or to produce hydrogen for use in a fuel cell. In the latter case, hydrogen yield can be much higher than the hydrogen content of the biomass due to steam reforming where water is a hydrogen-providing participant in the overall reaction.|$|E
