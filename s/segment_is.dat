5|$|Crickets {{are small}} to {{medium-sized}} insects with mostly cylindrical, somewhat vertically flattened bodies. The head is spherical with long slender antennae arising from cone-shaped scapes (first segments) and just behind {{these are two}} large compound eyes. On the forehead are three ocelli (simple eyes). The pronotum (first thoracic <b>segment)</b> <b>is</b> trapezoidal in shape, robust, and well-sclerotinized. It is smooth and has neither dorsal or lateral keels (ridges).|$|E
5|$|MD 30 {{is a part}} of {{the main}} National Highway System for its entire length except for the short segment in Reisterstown south of MD 128 and MD 795; that short <b>segment</b> <b>is</b> a National Highway System {{principal}} arterial.|$|E
50|$|Tarur, Chittur, Nemmara and Alathur <b>segments</b> <b>are</b> in Palakkad {{district}} and Chelakkara, Kunnamkulam and Wadakkancherry <b>segments</b> <b>are</b> in Thrissur district.

50|$|If the {{ischemia}} {{has progressed}} {{to the point}} that the affected intestinal <b>segments</b> <b>are</b> gangrenous, a bowel resection of those <b>segments</b> <b>is</b> called for. Often, obviously dead <b>segments</b> <b>are</b> removed at the first operation, and a second-look operation is planned to assess <b>segments</b> that <b>are</b> borderline that may be savable after revascularization.|$|R
5|$|The galactic {{plane of}} the Milky Way passes through Perseus, but is much less obvious than {{elsewhere}} in the sky as it is mostly obscured by molecular clouds. The Perseus Arm is a spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy and stretches across the sky from the constellation Cassiopeia through Perseus and Auriga to Gemini and Monoceros. This <b>segment</b> <b>is</b> towards {{the rim of the}} galaxy.|$|E
5|$|The {{segment of}} SR85 between Buckeye and Gila Bend is a {{connector}} between I-8 and I-10, and serves {{both as a}} connector from I-8 from San Diego, California to Phoenix. This <b>segment</b> <b>is</b> being upgraded to a divided highway, and is planned to become a freeway. Most of the four-lane road upgrades have already been completed.|$|E
5|$|Two {{segments}} of M-43 are {{listed on the}} National Highway System. The first section runs from US131 in Oshtemo Township east to the intersection of M-43 (Gull Road) and Sprinkle Road in Comstock. The second <b>segment</b> <b>is</b> between I-96/I-69 in Delta Township and the junction between Saginaw Street and Grand River Avenue in East Lansing.|$|E

5|$|At birth, a {{rattlesnake}} hatchling {{has only a}} small button or 'primordial rattle' which is firmly attached {{to the tip of}} the tail. The first <b>segment</b> <b>is</b> added when the hatchling sheds its skin for the first time. A new section is added each time the skin is shed until a rattle is formed. The rattle grows as the snake ages but segments are also prone to breaking off and hence the length of a rattle is not a reliable indicator of the age of a snake.|$|E
5|$|Chelicerate nervous {{systems are}} based on the {{standard}} arthropod model of a pair of nerve cords, each with a ganglion per segment, and a brain formed by fusion of the ganglia just behind the mouth with those ahead of it. If one assume that chelicerates lose the first segment, which bears antennae in other arthropods, chelicerate brains include only one pair of pre-oral ganglia instead of two. However, there is evidence that the first <b>segment</b> <b>is</b> indeed available and bears the cheliceres.|$|E
5|$|East of Boyne City, M-75 turns northward {{and runs}} in that {{direction}} until turning again to follow the south shore of Walloon Lake. There it follows North Shore Drive into the town of Walloon Lake. M-75 ends at an intersection with US 131. The roadway continues eastward as C-81/Springvale Road. This northern segment carried 4,100vehicles and 170trucks in 2007. Neither <b>segment</b> <b>is</b> listed on the National Highway System, a system of strategically important highways.|$|E

5|$|Ownership and {{maintenance}} of NY18F is split between three different entities. The section of NY18F from Center Street in Lewiston to the northern village line of Youngstown is maintained by Niagara County. From Main Street in Youngstown to the northern village line, NY18F is concurrent to the unsigned County Route138 (CR138); {{the remainder of the}} county-maintained <b>segment</b> <b>is</b> co-designated as CR907. All of NY18F north of Youngstown is maintained by the town of Porter while the rest—Center Street between NY104 and 4th Street—is maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation.|$|E
5|$|The abdomen shows {{considerable}} variability {{among members}} of the order. It consists of eleven segments in primitive groups and ten segments in more derived groups, the tenth and eleventh segments having fused. The last two or three segments are adapted for reproduction. Each <b>segment</b> <b>is</b> made up of a dorsal and a ventral sclerite, connected by an elastic membrane. In some females, the sclerites are rolled into a flexible, telescopic ovipositor.|$|E
5|$|The {{eastern half}} of the route from 34Street to Anthony Henday Drive is {{designated}} as Highway100 by Alberta Transportation, but is not signed as such at any point along the route. The western <b>segment</b> <b>is</b> {{under the jurisdiction of the}} City of Edmonton. Between Anthony Henday Drive and 17Street, Sherwood Park Freeway carries approximately 40,000 vehicles per day, with heavy westbound volume in the morning peak hours and eastbound in the afternoon as commuters travel to and from the primarily residential community of Sherwood Park.|$|E
50|$|The {{distance}} between adjacent marks is one unit. Longer line <b>segments</b> <b>are</b> used for integers and natural numbers. Shorter line <b>segments</b> <b>are</b> used for fractions.|$|R

5|$|The {{genitalia}} of {{the male}} and female in any particular species are adapted to fit each other like a lock (male) and key (female). In males, the ninth abdominal <b>segment</b> <b>is</b> divided into a dorsal 'tegumen' and ventral 'viniculum'. They form a ring-like structure for the attachment of genital parts and a pair of lateral clasping organs (claspers or 'harpe'). The male has a median tubular organ (called the aedeagus) which is extended through an eversible sheath (or 'vesica') to inseminate the female. The males have paired sperm ducts in all lepidopterans; the paired testes are separate in basal taxa and fused in advanced forms.|$|E
5|$|The genome of {{rotavirus}} {{consists of}} 11 unique double helix molecules of RNA which are 18,555 nucleotides in total. Each helix, or <b>segment,</b> <b>is</b> a gene, numbered 1 to 11 by decreasing size. Each gene codes for one protein, except genes 9, which codes for two. The RNA {{is surrounded by}} a three-layered icosahedral protein capsid. Viral particles are up to 76.5nm in diameter and are not enveloped.|$|E
5|$|The main or primary bronchi {{enter the}} lungs at the hilum and {{initially}} branch into secondary bronchi {{also known as}} lobar bronchi that supply air to each lobe of the lung. The lobar bronchi branch into tertiary bronchi also known as segmental bronchi and these supply air to the further divisions of the lobes known as bronchopulmonary segments. Each bronchopulmonary segment has its own (segmental) bronchus and arterial supply. Segments for {{the left and right}} lung are shown in the table. The segmental anatomy is useful clinically for localising disease processes in the lungs. A <b>segment</b> <b>is</b> a discrete unit that can be surgically removed without seriously affecting surrounding tissue.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe genome of the {{influenza}} A virus {{consists of}} eight different segments. These eight <b>segments</b> <b>are</b> {{thought to be}} sorted selectively in infected cells. However, the cellular compartment where <b>segments</b> <b>are</b> sorted is not known. We examined using temperature sensitive (ts) mutant viruses and cell fusion where <b>segments</b> <b>are</b> sorted in infected cells. Different cells were infected with different ts mutant viruses, and these cells were fused. In fused cells, genome <b>segments</b> <b>are</b> mixed only in the cytoplasm, because M 1 prevents their re-import into the nucleus. We made a marker ts 53 virus, which has silent mutations in given segments and determined the reassortment frequency on all segments using ts 1 and marker ts 53. In both co-infected and fused cells, all of marker ts 53 segments and ts 1 <b>segments</b> <b>were</b> incorporated into progeny virions in a random fashion. These results suggest that influenza virus genome <b>segments</b> <b>are</b> sorted after nuclear export...|$|R

5|$|The thorax is a tagma {{composed}} of three sections, the prothorax, mesothorax and the metathorax. The anterior segment, {{closest to the}} head, is the prothorax, with the major features being the first pair of legs and the pronotum. The middle <b>segment</b> <b>is</b> the mesothorax, with the major features being the second pair of legs and the anterior wings. The third and most posterior segment, abutting the abdomen, is the metathorax, which features the third pair of legs and the posterior wings. Each <b>segment</b> <b>is</b> dilineated by an intersegmental suture. Each segment has four basic regions. The dorsal surface is called the tergum (or notum) to distinguish it from the abdominal terga. The two lateral regions are called the pleura (singular: pleuron) and the ventral aspect is called the sternum. In turn, the notum of the prothorax is called the pronotum, the notum for the mesothorax is called the mesonotum and the notum for the metathorax is called the metanotum. Continuing with this logic, the mesopleura and metapleura, {{as well as the}} mesosternum and metasternum, are used.|$|E
5|$|C-terminal truncation: The C-terminal end <b>segment</b> <b>is</b> {{the most}} conserved region of TnI. As an {{allosteric}} structure regulated by Ca2+ in the troponin complex, it binds and stabilizes {{the position of}} tropomyosin in low Ca2+ state implicating {{a role in the}} inhibition of actomyosin ATPase. A deletion of the C-terminal 19 amino acids was found during myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury in Langendorff perfused rat hearts. It was also seen in myocardial stunning in coronary bypass patients. Over-expression of the C-terminal truncated cardiac TnI (cTnI1-192) in transgenic mouse heart resulted in a phenotype of myocardial stunning with systolic and diastolic dysfunctions. Replacement of intact cTnI with cTnT1-192 in myofibrils and cardiomyocytes did not affect maximal tension development but decreased the rates of force redevelopment and relaxation.|$|E
5|$|I-75 {{has five}} named {{segments}} in Michigan. The southernmost section {{from the state}} line north to the Detroit area is the Detroit–Toledo Expressway. The segment through southern and central Detroit {{is known as the}} Fisher Freeway. It was dedicated on September 17, 1970, to the Fisher Brothers, who founded Fisher Body, later a part of General Motors. After the curve in downtown Detroit, I-75 follows the Walter P. Chrysler Freeway northward. That <b>segment</b> <b>is</b> named for Walter P. Chrysler, founder of Chrysler. The name was chosen by the Detroit Common Council on November 6, 1957, and codified in state law in 1990; the state definition for the name places the northern end of the designation at the Oakland–Genesee county line.|$|E
