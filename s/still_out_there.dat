As Heirens waited to be transferred to Stateville Prison from the Cook County Jail, Sheriff Michael Mulcahy asked Heirens if Suzanne Degnan suffered when she was killed. Heirens answered:I can't tell you if she suffered, Sheriff Mulcahy. I didn't kill her.

500|$|As Bond girl Giacinta 'Jinx' Johnson in the 2002 {{blockbuster}} Die Another Day, Berry recreated a {{scene from}} Dr. No, emerging from the surf to be greeted by James Bond as Ursula Andress had 40 years earlier.

The bikini scene was shot in Cadiz; the location was reportedly cold and windy, and footage has been released of Berry wrapped in thick towels in between takes to try to stay warm. According to an ITV news poll, Jinx was voted the fourth toughest girl on screen of all time. Berry was hurt during filming when debris from a smoke grenade flew into her eye. It was removed in a 30-minute operation. After Berry won the Academy Award, rewrites were commissioned to give her more screentime for X2.|$|E
500|$|The {{events that}} {{transpire}} between the fourth to sixth films are effectively ignored in 1998’s [...] This film opens {{twenty years after}} {{the events of the}} second film. Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) has faked her own death so that she could go into hiding from her brother Michael. Now working as the head mistress of a private school under the name Keri Tate, Laurie continues to live in fear of her brother’s return. Her own son, John (Josh Hartnett), attends school where she teaches. Laurie’s fear becomes reality when Michael (Chris Durand) shows up at the school and begins killing John’s friends and eventually he and Laurie come face-to-face. Laurie manages to get John and his girlfriend (Michelle Williams) to safety, but decides to return to the school to face Michael once and for all. Laurie succeeds in stopping Michael, but not satisfied until she knows that he is truly dead, Laurie steals his body and decapitates Michael. [...] (2002) picks up three years after H20, and reveals that Michael swapped clothes with a paramedic—crushing the paramedic’s larynx so that he could not talk—and that was who Laurie killed. Unable to deal with killing an innocent man, and the fact that Michael was <b>still</b> <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> Laurie is committed to a mental institution. Michael (Brad Loree) shows up at the institution, but Laurie captures him. Her fear of making the same mistake twice gets the better of her, and when she attempts to remove Michael’s mask he surprises and kills her. Michael travels back to his family home in Haddonfield, but finds a group of college students filming an Internet reality show. Michael proceeds to kill everyone, until he is finally electrocuted by the only surviving student, Sara Moyer (Bianca Kajlich), and the show’s creator Freddie Harris (Busta Rhymes).|$|E

[...] Another of his critics was Franklin Foer of The New Republic, who first noted Cockburn's response: To be fair, Cockburn doesn't exactly endorse these theories.

Out of the four observers, she {{is the only one who}} still believes that the new universe is just going through a rough patch; Superboy Prime and Alex Luthor are convinced that Earth is utterly corrupt, and Kal-L is slowly becoming swayed to their way of thinking. This version of Lois is frail, and died for reasons not explicitly revealed, though probably connected to her octogenarian status. This was the main reason for Kal-L's determination to restore Earth-Two, as he believed that Lois' health would recover once back on her proper Earth. Despite the restoration of Earth-Two, Lois Lane Kent died in the arms of her husband, Superman, in Infinite Crisis #5, regardless of Kal-L's protests that he could not let her die. After Kal-L died at the hands of Superboy-Prime at the end of Infinite Crisis #7, he commented that he finally understood Lois' final words [...] "It's... not... going..." [...] as meaning that it would never end for them, and one day it would be understood that even the heroes who had been lost in the original Crisis were <b>still</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> somewhere.

It is now time to forgive and forget that Sebastian had his start in a sometimes exploitative and often tacky TV talent show. When you're good – really good – inauspicious starts don't really matter Sebastian has paid his dues and finally found his sound. And it's good music, all written or co-written by the young man." [...] The Daily Telegraph music editor Kathy McCabe also gave the album 4 out of 5 stars saying, [...] "Sebastian steps up in songwriting and performance on the soul tracks which were no doubt inspired by his Memphis sessions detour. [...] "All to Myself" [...] is a knock-out song, and book-end song [...] "Attention" [...] is a sexy, hip-swinging soul number which perfectly showcases Sebastian's vocal range." [...] American radio announcer and music journalist Tony Peters wrote, [...] "Great soul music is <b>still</b> <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> you just gotta hunt for it. In this case, that means going halfway around the world. [...] "All to Myself" [...] and [...] "Attention" [...] both have that classic Motown stompin' feel that makes you move your feet, while [...] "Bring Yourself" [...] has conversational lyrics akin to Stevie Wonder's best work. Sebastian had a hand in composing the entire album, and he doesn't just re-write classic soul songs. He's obviously immersed himself in the genre and can truly add to it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Brown {{began the}} 2011–12 season {{on a line}} with newly {{acquired}} center Mike Richards, but was shuffled throughout the lineup {{for most of the}} season. He maintained his consistent production, topping 20 goals and 50 points for the fifth-straight year. Along {{with the rest of the}} Kings, however, he struggled to score in the first half of the season. Head Coach Terry Murray was fired midway through the season, and as the Kings fell further out of the playoff picture, they were rumored to be listening to trade offers for Brown. New coach Darryl Sutter called the Brown-Kopitar tandem [...] "stale" [...] and said Brown was not playing the [...] "straight-line, up-and-down, go-to-the-net, shoot-the-puck, run-over-people" [...] style Brown needed to be effective. Brown's scoring pace picked up amidst the trade rumors, and he scored three goals and an assist in the last game before the NHL trade deadline, a 4–0 win over the Chicago Blackhawks. The Kings held on to Brown, who responded with 11 points in the nine games following the trade deadline. Brown later said that he was playing with [...] "a chip on his shoulder" [...] and [...] "whether those rumors are true or not, they're <b>still</b> <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> it gives you maybe a bit more motivation." [...] With Brown producing and the trade-deadline acquisition of Jeff Carter, the Kings were one of the highest-scoring NHL teams down the stretch and made the playoffs as an eighth seed. After moving up-and-down the lineup for most of the year, Brown found stability playing on the first line with Anže Kopitar and Justin Williams. That line would remain intact throughout the entire 2012 Stanley Cup playoffs.|$|E
