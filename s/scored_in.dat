5|$|Since the 1996–97 season, European Sports Media have {{awarded the}} Golden Shoe {{based on a}} points system that allows players in tougher leagues to win even if they score fewer goals than a player in a weaker league. The {{weightings}} {{are determined by the}} league's ranking on the UEFA coefficients, which in turn depend on the results of each league's clubs in European competition over the previous five seasons. Goals <b>scored</b> <b>in</b> the top five leagues according to the UEFA coefficients list are multiplied by a factor of two, goals <b>scored</b> <b>in</b> the leagues ranked six to 21 are multiplied by a factor of 1.5, and goals <b>scored</b> <b>in</b> leagues ranked 22 and below are multiplied by a factor of 1. Thus, goals <b>scored</b> <b>in</b> higher ranked leagues will count for more than those <b>scored</b> <b>in</b> weaker leagues. Since this change, there was only been one winner was not playing in one of the top five leagues (Henrik Larsson, 2000–01 Scottish Premier League).|$|E
