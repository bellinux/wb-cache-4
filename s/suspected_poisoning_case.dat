40|$|Poison control {{centers in}} the United States are {{threatened}} with closure, and attempts at a cost-benefit analysis of these services have been indeterminate. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the operating costs of a regional poison control center resulting from public use of its telephone hotline services with those of hypothetical alternative sources of advice and care. We conducted a follow-up telephone survey among 589 public callers to the San Francisco Bay Area Regional Poison Control Center who had been managed at home without medical referral after an unintentional poisoning. All survey respondents were asked what alternative action they would have taken had the poison control center not been available to assist them by telephone consultation. We then surveyed emergency departments and physicians' offices cited as alternatives by the callers to determine their response and charges for evaluating a <b>suspected</b> <b>poisoning</b> <b>case.</b> A total of 464 (79 %) of the callers surveyed would have sought assistance from their local emergency health care system had the poison control center not been available. We conservatively estimated that the total charges for such evaluations would be + 71, 900. Comparatively, the total actual operating cost of services provided by the poison control center for all 589 poisoning cases was + 13, 547. Most of the study subjects (429 [73 %]) had private insurance coverage. Direct public access to these services probably reduces the use of emergency health care resources, thus lowering health care costs...|$|E

40|$|Worldwide, {{pesticides}} {{are applied}} to protect crops against insects, fungi and other parasites. Without these chemicals {{it would not be}} possible to produce sufficient food to satisfy the demand of an ever-increasing world population. Unfortunately, many cases of accidental and intentional poisoning of humans and animals occur and the objectives of this study were to obtain statistics of aldicarb poisoning in companion animals in Gauteng Province and to evaluate hydroxypropyl- b -cyclodextrin as a potential treatment. Cyclodextrins are ring-shaped oligosaccharides with a hydrophilic exterior and a hydrophobic interior. The interior cavity is capable of complexing fat-soluble molecules small enough to fit inside. Aldicarb is moderately lipid-soluble, non-ionized and of low molecular weight and thus fits all criteria for complexation with cyclodextrin. Questionnaires were posted to all private practitioners in Gauteng. The survey was designed to determine the percentage of aldicarb cases seen, clinical signs observed, treatment regimen, proposals for preventative actions and more effective treatments. Other questions included duration of treatment, survival rate, cost to client, post-mortem findings and reasons for poisonings. Thirty-four percent of respondants indicated the total number of all clinical cases presented at their practices during 2003. The percentage of suspected aldicarb cases as a proportion of all cases ranged from 0. 05 - 2. 6 % for dogs and 0. 09 - 3. 33 % for cats. Only 26. 5 % of practitioners sometimes submitted samples for laboratory confirmation of aldicarb poisoning. Salivation and tremors were the most common clinical signs observed by private practitioners and the majority of <b>suspected</b> <b>poisoning</b> <b>cases</b> were treated with atropine, intravenous fluid and electrolyte therapy and the oral administration of activated charcoal. Thirty-three respondents thought that there was {{an increase in the number}} of aldicarb cases, but 35 felt there was no increase during 2003. Fifteen respondents were reluctant to venture an opinion. Most veterinarians indicated that criminal intent was the main reason why animals were poisoned and 95 % of respondents reported that it occurred throughout the year, but an increased incidence was observed during holiday periods. Survival times in the majority of rats dosed with aldicarb and receiving intravenous cyclodextrin were longer, compared to the control rats only dosed with aldicarb per os. Rats receiving cyclodextrin immediately before aldicarb, survived longer when compared to rats, which received aldicarb prior to cyclodextrin.

40|$|A referee {{analysis}} method {{for the detection}} and quantification of Pacific ciguatoxins in fish flesh has recently been established by the public health analytical laboratory for the State of Queensland, Australia. Fifty-six fish samples were analysed, which included 10 fillets purchased as negative controls. P-CTX- 1 was identified in 27 samples, and P-CTX- 2 and P-CTX- 3 were found in 26 of those samples. The range of P-CTX- 1 concentrations was 0. 04 - 11. 4 mu g/kg fish flesh; coefficient of variation from 90 replicate analyses was 7. 4 %. A liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) method utilising a rapid methanol extraction and clean-up is reliable and reproducible, with the detection limit at 0. 03 mu g/kg fish flesh. Some matrix effects are evident, with fish oil content a likely signal suppression factor. Species identification of samples by DNA sequence analysis revealed some evidence of fish substitution or inadvertent misidentification, which may have implications for the management and prevention of ciguatera poisoning. Blinded inspection of case notes from <b>suspect</b> ciguatera <b>poisoning</b> <b>cases</b> showed that reporting of ciguatera-related paraesthesias was highly predictable {{for the presence of}} ciguatoxins in analysed fish, with 13 of 14 expected cases having consumed fish that contained P-CTX- 1 (p < 0. 001, Fishers Exact Test).

The {{aim of this study}} is to find out how death due to <b>suspected</b> <b>poisoning</b> affects incidence, age, sex, habitat, marital status, religion and manner of death. The study is based on the autopsy record of 5 consecutive years (2009 to 2013) of unnatural death <b>cases</b> resulting from <b>suspected</b> <b>poisoning.</b> Total numbers of autopsy cases were 10195 and death due to <b>suspected</b> <b>poisoning</b> were 896. These cases were brought to the Department of Forensic Medicine, IMS, BHU Varanasi and have been analyzed retrospectively. The <b>suspected</b> <b>poisoning</b> constitute 8. 79 % of total autopsied cases. Male victims (71. 54 %) outnumbered females (28. 46 %) and maximum numbers of cases were in the age group of 21 - 30 years (38. 73 %). Among those whose marital status was known i. e. 194 cases (21. 65 %), 0 % cases are male and 100 % are female. More cases (73. 95 %) are from rural habitat than urban. Hindus outnumbered 817 (91. 18 %) the Muslims. Regarding the manner of death, 861 (96. 09 %) cases of death due to poisoning, were suicidal. Most of the fatal poisoning were maximum during summer season 368 (41. 07 %).

40|$|Between 2004 and 2013, 486 <b>suspected</b> {{scavenger}} <b>poisoning</b> <b>cases,</b> including 24 bearded vultures (Gypaetus barbatus), {{were investigated}} in the Pyrenees and surrounding areas in Spain {{as part of}} a monitoring programme regarding accidental and intentional poisoning of wildlife. Poisoning was confirmed in 36 % of all analysed cases where scavenger species were found dead within the distribution range of bearded vultures. Organophosphates and carbamates were the most frequently detected poisons. Four of the bearded vulture cases were positive for the presence of topical antiparasitics (3 with diazinon and 1 with permethrin). These likely represented accidental exposure due to the legal use of these veterinary pharmaceuticals. In order to confirm the risk of exposure to topical antiparasitics in bearded vultures, pig feet (n = 24) and lamb feet (n = 24) were analysed as these are one of the main food resources provided to bearded vultures at supplementary feeding stations. Pig feet had no detectable residues of topical antiparasitics. In contrast, 71. 4 % of lamb feet showed residues of antiparasitics including diazinon (64. 3 %), pirimiphos-methyl (25. 4 %), chlorpyrifos (7. 1 %), fenthion (1. 6 %), permethrin (0. 8 %) and cypermethrin (27. 8 %). Washing the feet with water significantly reduced levels of these topical antiparasitics, as such, this should be a recommended practice for lamb feet supplied at feeding stations for bearded vultures. Although the detected levels of antiparasitics were relatively low (≤ 1 μg/g), a risk assessment suggests that observed diazinon levels may affect brain acetylcholinesterase and thermoregulation in bearded vultures subject to chronic exposure. This study was funded by a grant of the Spanish Program of Research and Development (CGL 2013 - 40975 -R) and a contract with the Biodiversity Service of the Gobierno de Aragón (RB 82125, RB 29049, RB 044077, RB 14087, RB 24105, RB 34047, RB 44050, RB 54098).

40|$|Introduction: Poisoning is {{a common}} medico-social problem. It is a {{significant}} contributor to morbidity and mortality. Our study {{is to determine the}} socio demographic profile of the <b>poisoning</b> <b>cases</b> reported and to find out the pattern of <b>poisoning</b> <b>cases</b> at a tertiary care hospital in rural set up. Method: Participants comprised of acute poisoning admissions to the emergency of UPRIMS and R, Saifai, Etawah, U. P. during 8 months period. Data regarding pattern of poisoning, basic demographics and drug utilization were collected by retrospective review of patient records. Results: Major <b>poisoning</b> <b>cases</b> were observed in the age group between 21 - 30 years (39. 09 %). The populations with possibility of exposure to poisoning in their occupations were farmers (41. 5 %), housewives (31. 2 %) and students (18. 8 %). The maximum numbers of <b>poisoning</b> <b>cases</b> reported were due to organophosphorus (57. 1 %). The number of intentional <b>poisoning</b> <b>cases</b> (91. 9 %) were more when compared to accidental <b>poisoning</b> <b>cases</b> (5. 2 %). Conclusion: Prevailing treatment protocols require updating on proper guidelines for better management of poisoning. Pattern and magnitude of poisoning are multidimensional and demand multi-sectoral approach for facing this problem. There is need for stringent pesticide regulation laws and counselling and training programs to reduce incidence of poisonings. " [Natl J Community Med 2016; 7 (4. 000) : 307 - 310...|$|R

The survey was carried out from 2010 to 2012, in 2 regions of South Italy (Puglia and Basilicata) on 300 organs of animals and 90 suspected bait samples. The qualitative and quantitative analyses were conducted using an analytical method based on high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorimetric detection (FLD) for the simultaneous determination of 8 anticoagulant rodenticides (bromadiolone, brodifacoum, coumachlor, coumafuryl, coumatetralyl, difenacoum, flocoumafen, and warfarin). The presence of anticoagulant rodenticides was detected in 33 organs of animals (11 % of the total) and 6 bait samples (7 % of the total). The most commonly detected compound was coumachlor (47 % of 39 positive samples) followed by bromadiolone (24 %), and brodifacoum (11 %).

Detailed investigation of the circumstances of the accidents carried out by a multidisciplinary team showed that at least 65 %, and possibly as many as 78 % were poisoning scares and not true poisoning. The evidence used by the casualty doctor and by the parents to diagnose poisoning was explored, and in many cases was circumstantial.
