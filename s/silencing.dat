5|$|Gene <b>silencing</b> aims {{to reduce}} the {{production}} of the mutant protein, since HD is caused by a single dominant gene encoding a toxic protein. Gene <b>silencing</b> experiments in mouse models have shown that when the expression of mHTT is reduced, symptoms improve. Safety of non-allele specific RNAi and ASO gene <b>silencing</b> has now been demonstrated in mice and the large, human-like brains of primates. Allele-specific <b>silencing</b> attempts to silence mutant HTT while leaving wild-type HTT untouched. One way of accomplishing this is to identify polymorphisms present on only one allele and produce gene <b>silencing</b> drugs that target polymorphisms in only the mutant allele. The first 'gene silencing' trial involving human HD patients began in 2015, testing the safety of IONIS-HTTRx, produced by Ionis Pharmaceuticals and led by UCL Institute of Neurology. Mutant huntingtin was detected and quantified {{for the first time in}} cerebrospinal fluid from Huntington's disease mutation-carriers in 2015 using a novel 'single-molecule counting' immunoassay, providing a direct way to assess whether huntingtin-lowering treatments are achieving the desired effect. Similarly, gene splicing techniques are being looked at to try to repair a genome with the erroneous gene that causes HD, using tools such as CRISPR/Cas9.|$|E

The thesis concretely identifies the <b>silence</b> as {{a very important part of}} human lives because the <b>silence</b> helps people to find their spirituality.

In this part there is also the quality of <b>silence</b> important for human spirituality discussed.

5|$|RNAi is an RNA-dependent gene <b>silencing</b> {{process that}} is {{controlled}} by the RNA-induced <b>silencing</b> complex (RISC) and is initiated by short double-stranded RNA molecules in a cell's cytoplasm, where they interact with the catalytic RISC component argonaute. When the dsRNA is exogenous (coming from infection by a virus with an RNA genome or laboratory manipulations), the RNA is imported directly into the cytoplasm and cleaved to short fragments by Dicer. The initiating dsRNA can also be endogenous (originating in the cell), as in pre-microRNAs expressed from RNA-coding genes in the genome. The primary transcripts from such genes are first processed to form the characteristic stem-loop structure of pre-miRNA in the nucleus, then exported to the cytoplasm. Thus, the two dsRNA pathways, exogenous and endogenous, converge at the RISC.|$|E

5|$|The RNAi pathway {{is found}} in many eukaryotes, {{including}} animals, and is initiated by the enzyme Dicer, which cleaves long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules into short double-stranded fragments of ~20 nucleotide siRNAs. Each siRNA is unwound into two single-stranded RNAs (ssRNAs), the passenger strand and the guide strand. The passenger strand is degraded and the guide strand is incorporated into the RNA-induced <b>silencing</b> complex (RISC). The most well-studied outcome is post-transcriptional gene <b>silencing,</b> which occurs when the guide strand pairs with a complementary sequence in a messenger RNA molecule and induces cleavage by Argonaute 2 (Ago2), the catalytic component of the RISC complex. In some organisms, this process spreads systemically, despite the initially limited molar concentrations of siRNA.|$|E

5|$|An {{important}} pathophysiological {{mechanism of}} leukemogenesis in AML is the epigenetic induction of dedifferentiation by genetic mutations that alter {{the function of}} epigenetic enzymes, such as the DNA demethylase TET2 and the metabolic enzymes IDH1 and IDH2, which lead to the generation of a novel oncometabolite, D-2-hydroxyglutarate, which inhibits the activity of epigenetic enzymes such as TET2.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} role of <b>silence</b> in Willa Cather 2 ̆ 7 s literature by studying rhetorical uses of <b>silence,</b> metaphors of <b>silence,</b> and poetics of <b>silence.</b> Cather 2 ̆ 7 s exploration begins with a consideration of <b>silence</b> {{as a part of}} conversation, demonstrating the rhetorical impact of <b>silence</b> one character exerts upon another. As her work continues, Cather establishes metaphors of <b>silence</b> that reveal its richness.

The second chapter consists of a brief examination of the poetry, and it argues that Cather begins by defining <b>silence</b> as absence of sound or life.

5|$|The active {{components}} of an RNA-induced <b>silencing</b> complex (RISC) are endonucleases called argonaute proteins, which cleave the target mRNA strand complementary to their bound siRNA. As the fragments produced by dicer are double-stranded, they could each in theory produce a functional siRNA. However, {{only one of}} the two strands, which is known as the guide strand, binds the argonaute protein and directs gene <b>silencing.</b> The other anti-guide strand or passenger strand is degraded during RISC activation. Although it was first believed that an ATP-dependent helicase separated these two strands, the process proved to be ATP-independent and performed directly by the protein components of RISC. However, an in vitro kinetic analysis of RNAi in the presence and absence of ATP showed that ATP may be required to unwind and remove the cleaved mRNA strand from the RISC complex after catalysis. The guide strand tends to be the one whose 5' end is less stably paired to its complement, but strand selection is unaffected by the direction in which dicer cleaves the dsRNA before RISC incorporation. Instead, the R2D2 protein may serve as the differentiating factor by binding the more-stable 5' end of the passenger strand.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} {{the experience of}} applying of The <b>Silences</b> Framework to underpin health research investigating Tuberculosis/HIV/AIDS coinfection. Method: The <b>Silences</b> Framework originally developed following a study exploring the decisions and <b>silences</b> surrounding black Caribbean men living in England, discussing the themes 'sexual health' and 'ethnicity'. Following this study a conceptual a theory for research on sensitive issues and health care of marginalized populations was developed called 'Screaming Silences' which forms the foundation of The <b>Silences</b> Framework. Screaming <b>Silences</b> define research areas and experiences that are poorly studied, little understood or <b>silenced.</b> Results: The <b>Silences</b> Framework supports researchers in revealing "silences" in the subjects they study - as such results may reflect how beliefs, values, and experiences of some groups influence their health. This framework provides the application of four complementary stages: working the <b>silences,</b> hearing <b>silences,</b> voicing <b>silences</b> {{and working with the}} <b>silences.</b> The analysis occurs cyclically and can be repeated as long as the <b>silences</b> inherent in a study are not revealed. Conclusion: this article presents The <b>Silences</b> Framework and the application of the notion of "sounds of silence", mapping an antiessentialist theoretical framework for its use in sensitive research in health and nursing areas, being a reference for other researchers in studies involving marginalized populations.
