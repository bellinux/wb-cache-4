5|$|Electron {{affinity}} generally increases {{across a}} period. This {{is caused by}} the filling of the valence shell of the atom; a group 17 atom releases more energy than a group 1 atom on gaining an electron because it obtains a filled valence <b>shell</b> <b>and</b> is therefore more stable.|$|E

5|$|Fluorine atoms {{have nine}} {{electron}}s, one fewer than neon, and electron configuration 1s22s22p5: two electrons in a filled inner <b>shell</b> <b>and</b> seven in an outer shell requiring one {{more to be}} filled. The outer electrons are ineffective at nuclear shielding, and experience a high effective nuclear charge of 9 − 2 = 7; this affects the atom's physical properties.|$|E
5|$|It is {{also worth}} {{mentioning}} that sea shells, after collecting, {{need to be}} washed thoroughly in freshwater to remove the salt that is on and in the <b>shell,</b> <b>and</b> then dried thoroughly before they are stored. Salt attracts moisture and makes shells more vulnerable to Bynesian decay.|$|E

5|$|Some anomalously old {{radiocarbon}} {{dates of}} Lake Cahuilla deposits {{may be the}} consequence of the Colorado River transporting ancient carbonates into the lake. In addition, discrepancies between <b>shell</b> <b>and</b> other organic material ages can reach 400–800 years owing to old carbon; shells can also absorb carbon-14 from the air. Other research has documented no substantial old carbon effects.|$|E

5|$|While escaping, {{the newly}} hatched larvae of many species {{sometimes}} eat the chorion to emerge.

5|$|Brachiopods, as with molluscs, have an {{epithelial}} mantle that secretes {{and lines}} the <b>shell,</b> <b>and</b> encloses the internal organs. The brachiopod body occupies only {{about one-third of}} the internal space inside the shell, nearest the hinge. The rest of the space is lined with the mantle lobes, extensions that enclose a water-filled space in which sits the lophophore. The coelom extends into each lobe as a network of canals, which carry nutrients to the edges of the mantle.|$|E

This research namely observational study with using health risk assessment. Cadmium concentration in fish, crab, cockle <b>shells</b> <b>and</b> shrimp, body weight, consumption rate and exposure time by quantitative for calculating cadmium intake and risk quotient (RQ). Concentration cadmium in fish, crab, cockle <b>shells</b> <b>and</b> shrimp from Tallo river analyzed with Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry respectively 0. 00021 - 0. 00048 mg/gram; 0. 00021 mg/gram; 0. 00077 - 0. 00106 mg/gram; and 0. 00021 mg/gram. Risk assessment of cadmium for population result that risk quotient of population who consuming fish with 0. 00021 mg/gram cadmium is 0. 0725, whereas for fish with 0. 00048 mg/gram cadmium is 0. 1655. Risk quotient for consuming crab is 0. 126. Risk quotient for consuming cockle shells with 0. 00077 mg/gram cadmium is 0. 026, whereas for cockle shells with 0. 00106 mg/gram cadmium is 0. 036.
