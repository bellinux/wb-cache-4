5|$|Three astronauts are {{launched}} into space aboard a rocket designed by Professor Quatermass, but the spacecraft returns to earth {{with only one}} occupant, Victor Carroon (Richard Wordsworth). <b>Something</b> <b>has</b> infected him during the spaceflight, and he begins mutating into an alien organism which, if it spores, will engulf the Earth and destroy humanity. When the Carroon-creature escapes from custody, Quatermass and Scotland Yard's Inspector Lomax (Jack Warner), have just hours to track it down and prevent a catastrophe.|$|E
5|$|In Goodland, Florida, {{during a}} fierce hurricane, Sara Shipley and her son, Evan, desperately try to flip {{the washing machine}} but fail to do so as tentacles ensnare them. After {{receiving}} a call, FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) arrive {{at the home of}} retired FBI agent Arthur Dales (Darren McGavin), the first to look into the X-Files. He tells them about the Shipley family and how Sara Shipley called him in a panic after her husband was attacked by something in the bathroom with tentacles. Scully is dubious about this but believes that <b>something</b> <b>has</b> indeed happened to the Shipley family during this hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Bob {{has been}} fooled by Jeanie's lies {{about why they}} are not going out, and is enlightened when Sidney lets slip that Larry and Jeanie are seeing each other. Bob demands proof, and Sidney tells Bob to watch what happens in the wings during the {{upcoming}} Act 1 finale to Me and Juliet. Bob sees Larry and Jeanie kiss after she comes offstage with a tray of flowers, an action caught by Bob's spotlight. Mac enters, grasps the situation, sends Larry away, then puts the tray back in Jeanie's hands and pushes her onstage. She is pursued by Bob's spotlight, which relentlessly follows her around the stage as {{more and more of the}} dancers become aware <b>something</b> <b>has</b> gone badly wrong. Bob drops a sandbag from the light bridge; it knocks the tray Jeanie is holding to the ground. Mac orders the curtain lowered in front of a stage in panic.|$|E

5|$|Suzy gets {{a job at}} {{a burger}} joint, and moves into an {{abandoned}} boiler, with entry through the attached pipe. Doc is unhappy, and Hazel decides <b>something</b> <b>has</b> to be done ("Thinkin' "). He is unable {{to come up with an}} answer, and eventually forgets the question. Some weeks pass, and Joe the Mexican woos Suzy. He has no success, and his attempts irritate Doc. The next day, Doc himself approaches the pipe with flowers in hand ("How Long?"), still uncertain as to why he is seeking a girl like Suzy. Suzy lets him in the boiler, which she has fitted up in a homelike manner. She is doing well at the burger joint, but is grateful to Fauna for giving her confidence. She is confident enough, indeed, to reject Doc, who is unhappy, but philosophical ("The Next Time It Happens").|$|E

The fetus has at most one, consciousness (and this only after it becomes susceptible to pain—the timing of which is disputed), and hence is not a person.|$|E
25|$|The {{blind man}} wants to know: “What {{does it all}} look like now?” He is curious about the {{condition}} of the trees and several times brings up the subject of light.

Psylocke comes to the room and explains that <b>something</b> <b>has</b> happened, Gabriel's manifesting speed powers caused him to move so fast he is invisible to the naked eye. Psylocke taps into Cecilia's powers to create a force field around his room so they would not lose him before Hope Summers could arrive to help.|$|E
25|$|Cassie, {{after much}} convincing from Thelma decides that her fetus must be aborted, {{although}} it is growing at an alarming rate. A week after conception, the doctors believe she is {{nearing the end of}} her second trimester. Thelma assists Cassie, without telling her that success means that she may never see Cassie again. Azazeal tries to interfere and save his son, but Cassie goes through with the abortion...or so she thinks. When Thelma realizes that Cassie can still see her, Thelma knows that <b>something</b> <b>has</b> not gone right. Cassie discovers weeks later that the doctor who performed her procedure has been influenced by Azazeal, and that the baby is alive and in Azazeal's care.|$|E
500|$|To {{illustrate}} the philosophical method, consider one grouping of {{many kinds of}} animal, [...] 'birds': all {{members of this group}} possess the same distinguishing features—feathers, wings, beaks, and two bony legs. This is an instance of a universal: if something is a bird, it will have feathers and wings; if <b>something</b> <b>has</b> feathers and wings, that also implies it is a bird, so the reasoning here is bidirectional. On the other hand, some animals that have red blood have lungs; other red-blooded animals (such as fish) have gills. This implies, in Aristotle's reasoning, that if <b>something</b> <b>has</b> lungs, it has red blood; but Aristotle is careful not to imply that all red-blooded animals have lungs, so the reasoning here is not bidirectional.|$|E

500|$|Ferrari {{dominated}} the previous round in Malaysia, where Felipe Massa had claimed pole position, and led his teammate Räikkönen {{in second place}} through the opening stages of the race, before spinning off and retiring midway through. Räikkönen {{went on to win}} the race, and expressed his optimism about Bahrain: [...] "I have finished third in three successive Grands Prix in Bahrain. Time and again <b>something</b> <b>has</b> gone wrong. Sakhir is one of those circuits where I really want to win. Finally." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} the {{development}} of the song, Martin said: [...] "My father-in-law Bruce Paltrow bought this big keyboard just before he died. No one had ever plugged it in. I plugged it in, and there was this incredible sound I'd never heard before. All these songs poured out from this one sound. <b>Something</b> <b>has</b> to inspire you, and something else takes over. It's very cloudy." [...] Martin also noted that the song is [...] "probably the most important song we've ever written".|$|E
500|$|In The Nutcracker Suite, {{animator}} Art Babbitt {{is said to}} have credited The Three Stooges as a {{guide for}} animating the dancing mushrooms in the Chinese Dance routine. He drew with a music score pinned to his desk to work out the choreography so he could relate the action to the melody and the counterpoint, [...] "those nasty little notes underneath... so <b>something</b> <b>has</b> to be related to that". The studio filmed professional dancers Joyce Coles and Marjorie Belcher wearing ballet skirts that resembled shapes of blossoms that were to sit above water for Dance of the Flutes. An Arabian dancer was also brought in to study the movements for the goldfish in Arab Dance.|$|E

500|$|The Times {{placed the}} {{portrait}} {{in the tradition}} of works that sacrificed [...] "the reality of the monarch to the idea of the monarchy", saying that Annigoni had [...] "managed to capture some of her Majesty's dignity and beauty. All he has failed to capture is her vitality" [...] The paper compared the work unfavourably to Hans Holbein the Younger's portrait of Jane Seymour, in which they felt [...] "the complexity of the detail creates a coherent and deliberate abstract pattern, which has a life and meaning of its own", transforming the sitter into a [...] "more than human symbol", whereas with Annigoni [...] "...there is no such purpose and eloquence in the actual marks on the canvas; <b>something</b> <b>has</b> been subtracted from reality, but nothing has been added".|$|E
500|$|According to Amy Lee, [...] "Going Under" [...] {{is about}} a {{previous}} emotionally [...] and physically damaging relationship: [...] "And when you're {{at the end of}} your rope, when you're at the point where you realize <b>something</b> <b>has</b> to change, that you can't go on living in the situation that you're in. It's cool. It's a very strong song." [...] "Going Under" [...] was Fallen second single. [...] "Bring Me to Life" [...] is a nu metal-rap rock song written in common time and performed at a moderate tempo (96 beats per minute). Written by Lee, Ben Moody, and David Hodges, the song was conceived when an acquaintance asked Lee in a restaurant if she was happy in her current relationship. When Lee realized that she was not, the lyrics [...] "wake me up inside" [...] were inspired. The singer confirmed that the song was about longtime friend Josh Hartzler, whom she married in 2007.|$|E
500|$|Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger {{admitted}} {{his team}} had underachieved during the season, but took criticism of failing to challenge Manchester United {{in the league and}} progressing further in the UEFA Champions League as a [...] "compliment to the club". He spoke in favour of moving FA Cup ties midweek to prevent fixture congestion, because the current system was too demanding for the big clubs: [...] "In England a team that goes for the FA Cup automatically has a problem in the championship, especially if they play in the Champions League. There are then so many games <b>something</b> <b>has</b> to be sacrificed and I have sacrificed points in the championship to the FA Cup." [...] When asked whether reducing the number of teams in the UEFA Champions League would help, Wenger commented it [...] "...would mean less money and no one with the wages we pay can accept a drop in income. As for cutting the Premiership – they have done that in France and now those teams not involved in the cups are complaining." ...|$|E
