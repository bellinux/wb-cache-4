The JLI carries Jaime to the land surface, where paramedics try to resuscitate him. However, their efforts fail as Jaime had already died.

25|$|From {{the ground}} level {{entrance}} {{door on the}} western side of the tower, a spiral concrete staircase with steel tubular handrail winds around a central service duct before arriving in the near-centre of the observation room. Apart from an enclosed toilet in the north-west corner, the observation room is an open space with a central pillar that contains cavities for services that link to the roof level. Fixed angled glazing wraps around the north, east and south sides. A set of recent laminated cabinetry sits below the observation windows along the north-east. Original metal window frames on the western wall are a mixture of mid-point pivoting and fixed panes, while more recent aluminium-framed windows are found in the toilet. Floors are lined with linoleum and a system of suspended ceiling panels conceals the underside of the concrete roof slab. A recent sink and cupboard <b>sits</b> <b>up</b> against the southern wall of the toilet. All original communications equipment has been removed. Access to the external balcony, which wraps around all sides except the straight, western edge, is through a single door in the south-west corner. This timber door retains the original separate screen door. The narrow balcony has a concrete floor and a balustrade made from two tubular steel rails and widely separated balusters covered in asbestos cement sheeting rendered with pebble-dash on the exterior face. The steel balusters pierce the concrete floor slab and are fixed on the underside.|$|E
500|$|The second {{segment is}} based on The Twilight Zone {{television}} series episode [...] "It's a Good Life". That episode had also inspired the third segment of , which starred Nancy Cartwright in her debut feature film role. The segment parodies the narration of The Twilight Zone, and the producers were pleased with Harry Shearer's portrayal of Rod Serling. In addition, though {{it took a long}} time, the design of the monster version of Snowball II by Rich was greatly enjoyed by the producers, who thought it looked [...] "just hideous, just right". Bart's prank call to Moe was thought of by John Swartzwelder, one of the writers; however, Hank Azaria detested the line. According to George Meyer, the animation for when Bart <b>sits</b> <b>up,</b> screaming, was extremely tough, especially to make the mouthlines natural.|$|E

2500|$|September 3 – Castro {{was able}} to write notes and give orders as he recovers from surgery, Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez said. [...] "He's writing already, (before) he couldn't even write, he was in recovery," [...] Chávez said during his weekly Sunday broadcast, showing a {{handwritten}} note he said Castro had given him during his surprise visit to Cuba last week. [...] "He already <b>sits</b> <b>up,</b> writes, he has a phone, he gives orders, instructions." [...] Castro's exact health problem is a state secret in Cuba, leading to intense speculation over his condition {{and the future of}} Cuba's government. He has not been seen in public since the announcement of the handover. Televised images taken during Chávez's visit showed Castro sitting up and speaking enthusiastically in further evidence that he is recovering.|$|E
