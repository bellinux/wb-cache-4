40|$|A {{modified}} version of Jones' length-based cohort analysis is linked to economic data from the Swedish trawl fishery for Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus). The current regulation implies a fishing practice where each landed lobster entails three killed due to discard mortality, and different cases of trawl selectivity are compared together with varying natural mortality. The bioeconomic analysis shows that a maximum economic yield equilibrium requires effort reductions of more than 50 %, leading to a potential resource rent of almost US $ 3 million, compared to the open-access situation in 1995. Further increase of the resource rent is possible if a more <b>selective</b> <b>trawl</b> is introduced and enforced. The trawl fishery is compared with a minor in-shore creel fishery, which differs in exploitation pattern, fuel consumption, and impact on the benthic flora and fauna. A qualitative discussion on the two fisheries is carried out and {{a comparison of the}} economic performance is presented. Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Discarding of {{juvenile}} fish {{is a well}} recognised problem in shrimp fisheries. In many cases, these fish are commercial species that, if not caught, could increase the productivity of other fisheries. In January 2003, European legislation was implemented by Member States requiring all vessels fishing for brown shrimp to use <b>selective</b> <b>trawls</b> in order to minimise the bycatch of other commercial species. In complying with the regulations, however, the catch rate of the target species (the shrimp) {{is likely to be}} reduced. In this paper, we use a bioeconomic model {{to assess the impact of}} bycatch reduction devices on fishing effort, catch and profitability in the European Crangon fisheries. The potential benefits (in terms of higher future yields and consequently higher profits) to the white-fish fisheries are also estimated. From the model results, the regulation is expected to result in a net reduction in the profitability of the shrimp fishers. However, the benefits to the white-fish fishers is expected to more than offset this cost, resulting in an overall net benefit...|$|R
40|$|Three fishing methods, creeling, {{conventional}} trawling, and species-selective trawling {{are used}} to target Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus), economically {{the second most important}} species in Swedish west coast fisheries. To evaluate overall resource use and environmental impact caused by producing this seafood we followed the production chain starting from the fishery itself, through seafood auctioning, wholesaling, retailing, to the consumer using life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. That portion of the life cycle occurring on land was assumed to be identical for Norway lobsters regardless as to how they were caught. The functional unit was 300 g of edible meat (i. e., Norway lobster tails), corresponding to one kilogram of whole, boiled Norway lobsters. Major {{differences were found between the}} fishing methods with regard to environmental impact: creeling was found to be more efficient than conventional trawling in all traditional impact categories and in the two additional fishery-related categories seafloor impact and discarding. Species-selective trawling was considerably more resource efficient than was conventional trawling due to both less discards and less landed by-catch; however, <b>selective</b> <b>trawling</b> nevertheless used mor...|$|R
40|$|We {{tested the}} {{potential}} of a <b>selective</b> flatfish <b>trawl</b> to reduce bycatch of slope rockfish in the upper continental slope bottom-trawl fishery (250 – 500 m) on the U. S. West Coast. The trawl we tested differed from typical slope trawls {{in that it was}} a low-rise, two-seam trawl with a severely cut back headrope. We used an alternate haul, randomized block design to compare catches of the experimental trawl with those of a typical four-seam, high-rise trawl and to examine diel changes in catch rates for both trawls. The experimental trawl produced catches similar to the control trawl for all commercially valuable flatfish, except arrowtooth flounder Atheresthes stomias, which was reduced 24 %. Catches of most rockfish and roundfish were significantly reduced in the experimental trawl (50 – 94 % depending on species). However, the catches of darkblotched rockfish Sebastes crameri and redbanded rockfish S. babcocki were not reduced significantly in the experimental trawl. Nighttime catches were reduced 30 – 99 % for most rockfish species, the greatest reductions occurring in the experimental trawl. The large nighttime catch reduction for several rockfish species for both trawls along with no catch reduction in Dover sole Microstomus pacificus, suggests that fishing only at night may be a viable bycatch-reduction strategy for some rockfish species. The diel and depth-related variation in catch rates we noted for the <b>selective</b> flatfish <b>trawl</b> indicates that catches by this trawl may be especially sensitive to physical and environmental factors such as time of day, depth, or turbidity...|$|R
40|$|The {{incidental}} {{capture and}} resultant mortality of numerous fin-fish {{and other species}} of marine organisms by non-selective types of fishing gear constitute a major waste of the various fishery resources. The magnitude of the discarded by-catch and its effects upon the major fisheries is examined. Specific gear types contributing to the problem will be identified. The Gulf of Mexico shrimp fishery of the U. S., which annually catches over a billion pounds of unwanted fin-fish or “trash-fish” will be examined and {{an evaluation of the}} continuing development of <b>selective</b> shrimp <b>trawling</b> gear specifically designed to reduce the incidental capture of sea turtles, fin-fish, jellyfish, and other marine organisms will be conducted. Information is also presented on other possible gear modifications and operational alternatives both domestic and foreign, directed at minimizing the impacts of this neglected but critical facet of fishery science-truly, an international fishery management problem...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} two 70 W {{underwater}} electric lamps on the catch rate {{of a commercial}} bottom otter trawl was determined by comparative trials both at night and in daylight. It was found that, although the overall numbers and weights of fish caught did not differ, most of the species which were caught in large enough numbers for a judgement to be made showed a reaction to light. Three species, Trachurus trachurus, Merlangius merlangus and Trisopterus minutus were attracted and four species, Eutriglagurnardus, Micromesistius poutassou, Merluccius merluccius and Limanda limanda were scared off by light. The possible use of lights to further the development of <b>selective</b> commercial bottom <b>trawling</b> by attracting or scaring particular species is discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|The discard of finfish bycatch in the Gulf of Maine, {{northern}} shrimp trawl fishery {{is considered a}} serious problem. The species specific discard rate varied from 17 % for winter flounder to 95 % for silver hake in fifty tows made by commercial trawlers during the period 1985 - 1989 (Howell and Langan, 1990). Studies by Jean (1963) and Howell and Langan (1987) suggest a very high mortality for discarded finfish in the Western North Atlantic fisheries. The discard problem has two major facets: direct wastage in throwing back fish into the sea and loss of future catches of larger animals through the mortality of small individuals (Saila 1983). Given the perceived problem of discarded bycatch in the Gulf of Maine shrimp fishery, {{the objective of this}} project was to experiment with several design modifications to existing traditional trawls that would reduce the juvenile finfish bycatch. The concept of <b>selective</b> shrimp <b>trawls</b> is not novel. Trawl design modifications have been evaluated in shrimp fisheries to separate the finfish from the shrimp with varying success. The techniques utilize behavioral and size differences between shrimp and finfish, and include horizontal separator twine panels, large mesh escape panels, deflecting grids, accelerator funnels, and others. In this project, the northern style shrimp trawls served as the control nets. The basic modifications evaluated were: large mesh in belly area and a funnel accelerator ahead of the trawl cod-end...|$|R
40|$|Decisions made by {{fisheries}} managers strongly {{influence the}} overall resource use and environmental impacts {{associated with the}} seafood product from capture fisheries. These findings come from Life Cycle Assessments (LCA), a method that aims at quantifying all relevant resource use and environmental impacts throughout {{the life cycle of}} a product. In this way, important hot spots or improvement potentials can be found. The integrated systems perspective can assist to avoid shifts in impacts between production phases or environmental concerns. LCA is at present a well-established tool to assess environmental impacts of products, but there is no uptake of LCA-based methods or results in fishing policies. Methods for assessing fisheries-specific impacts within the LCA framework are however incomplete. One part of the research therefore addressed indicators related to pressures on marine ecosystems from discard to be used in seafood LCAs. Swedish fisheries on the west coast were evaluated using the trophic indicators mean trophic level (MTL) and primary production required (PPR). PPR could to some extent reflect properties of ecosystem resource use as PPR from the total catch, including discards, varied considerably between fisheries. Still, it was shown {{that it is difficult to}} interpret both indicators in relation to what is known about the ecosystems and the desired properties of the metrics. Complementing metrics of potential pressures on biodiversity are needed. The Swedish IUCN Red List of Threatened Species for fish was evaluated for this purpose. The Red List was found to be coherent with other assessments of vulnerability of fish to exploitation. Different fishing practices also showed different pressures on threatened fish species (aggregated as VEC). VEC together with PPR may thus be used in seafood LCA. Another part of the research explored LCA-based approaches as integrated decision support to form an overall sustainable fisheries management. Studies comprised of Swedish demersal trawling fleets. In the Nephrops fishery, a trade-off was found from promoting species-selective trawls. Local protection of depleted fish stocks comes with an increase in seafloor area swept, fuel use and associated emissions per landed kilo. Even if the overall fuel efficiency of the Swedish demersal trawling fleet has improved between 2002 and 2010, <b>selective</b> <b>trawling</b> required higher fuel use per kilo landing than the equivalent of less selective practices. Improved fuel efficiency was seen from stock rebuilding of the Eastern Baltic cod. However, in another study, the situation of the Eastern Baltic cod fishery was found to have deteriorated in recent years. Selection towards larger size classes has resulted in detrimental ecological consequences, reverberating into poor fish yield and economy. If overall improvements of the present situation are sought for, fisheries management needs to decrease mesh size and effort in the Eastern Baltic cod fishery, as well as include more metrics to assess sustainability. LCA-based methods can provide integrated decision support to inform various seafood policies, and integrate more objectives than is currently done in a fisheries policy context. To foster an overall sustainable seafood production, fisheries managers however need to acknowledge their role in this development. Altogether, stronger effort cuts and shifts in gear are proposed, while stressing the importance to use LCA-based assessments in order to avoid shifting from one environmental pressure to another...|$|R
40|$|Globally, penaeid-trawl {{fisheries}} {{are faced}} with three broad sustainability issues: (1) large bycatches; (2) acute benthic-habitat impacts; and (3) high energy consumption. Most resolution efforts have focused on i above, and via bycatch reduction devices (BRDs) installed in the posterior trawl (codend), which typically reduce total bycatches by 30 – 70 %, but are poorly adopted owing to few perceived benefits by fishers. While mandated BRDs will remain a feature of <b>selective</b> penaeid <b>trawling,</b> solutions to habitat impacts and high energy consumption require changes to the anterior trawl, including the spreading mechanisms (e. g. otter boards, beams and sleds), ground gears, and net designs. Further, because such components ultimately determine which organisms enter the codend, it should be feasible to structure anterior-trawl modifications to address all three sustainability issues, including improving selection. We sought to review the feasibility of such an approach here, and located fifty-eight relevant articles: of which 45, 11 and 23 directly or indirectly focused on reducing bycatch, habitat impacts and energy consumption, respectively. Considering these articles, we propose a protocol for holistically improving the environmental efficiency of penaeid trawling involving: (1) selecting the most appropriate multi-net configuration; (2) reducing otter-board angle of attack to ~ 20 °; (3) minimising twine area; and (4) optimising horizontal-trawl opening. Compared to conventional configurations, choosing alternatives within the above protocol could reduce total unwanted bycatches and habitat contact by > 70 %, while concomitantly lowering drag/fuel costs by > 20 %. The latter outcome might improve selective penaeid-trawl adoption among global fishing fleets...|$|R
