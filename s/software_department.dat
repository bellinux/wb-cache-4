40|$|This {{project has}} been {{developed}} in the Computer Lab of the <b>Software</b> <b>Department</b> in the UPC. The aim of the project is to analyse and develop the security layer of an existing application, called Gestdep, which manages the information of the department. It is important to say that Gestdep is in a progress of development and is being improved day by day by a Computer Lab developers' team. The <b>Software</b> <b>Department</b> activity and {{the different types of}} users, who should interact with Gestdep, are the reasons why it is a must to manage and control the access for different users. Till today, only two different users have been allowed to access Gestdep: 'admin' with total access to the application and a 'basic user' with restricted access. The main objective of this project is to develop a Permission Management system to allow the creation of as many roles as needed, each with different access to Gestdep. For that, not only the logical part will be implemented, but also the graphical user interface {{in order to make the}} roles and permissions management easier. Furthermore, the integration activity will be carried out in order to make effective permissions over the Gestdep application...|$|E
