5000|$|... "Servo Wave" [...] - This is {{a system}} Shimano {{introduced}} to brake levers which allowed them to pull more brake cable at the <b>start</b> of the <b>lever</b> stroke than at the end, giving improved separation between the brake blocks and the rim to allow for mud and lack of trueness in the wheels while still delivering the same braking power as systems which have a constant ratio between lever movement and cable pull and therefore less pad clearance. This was introduced during the mid-1990s. This was implemented initially by mounting the brake cable on a roller that moves towards the lever pivot in a slot in the lever blade as the lever is pulled. A second design pulled the brake cable downwards towards a cam near to the brake lever pivot instead.

40|$|Sleep {{deprivation}} has profound {{effects on}} cognitive performance, {{and some of}} these effects may be mediated by impaired prefrontal cortex function. In search of an animal model to investigate this relationship we studied the influence of restricted sleep on operant conditioning in rats, particularly the performance in a differential reinforcement of low rate responding (DRL) task, which is highly dependent upon an intact prefrontal cortex. Animals were trained to withhold a lever press until an imposed delay of 30 s after the last press had passed in order to achieve a food reward. Once the animals had mastered the task, they were sleeprestricted for 7 days with 20 h of sleep deprivation per day. At the end of each daily sleep deprivation session, performance on the DRL task was assessed. The results show that sleep-restricted animals were less able to time their responses correctly, <b>started</b> pressing the <b>lever</b> more randomly and showed signs of behavioural disinhibition, the latter possibly reflecting enhanced impulsivity. Our data support the hypothesis that a sleep debt has disruptive consequences for the functioning of the prefrontal cortex.

40|$|Various animal {{models have}} been {{developed}} to investigate the neurobiological and behavioral mechanisms of drug addiction. The most popular of these animal models include the locomotor sensitization paradigm, the place conditioning procedure and the self-administration technique. With these techniques, it is possible to mimic in rodents the major aspects of human drug addiction. The self-administration procedure is the most widely used and show an excellent natural and predictive validity. In the self-administration protocol, experimental animals, usually rats or mice, are allowed to press a lever in order to gain access to a small dose of an addictive drug. The drug may be given to the animal through the oral, the intravenous or the intracranial route of administration, according to the purpose of the study. In recent years, the classical self-administration procedure has been adapted to study the specific neurobiological basis of drug relapse. In this now called drug reinstatement paradigm, when drug self-administration behaviors are well established, an extinction procedure <b>starts,</b> during which <b>lever</b> pressing is no longer reinforced by drug access. After a number of such extinction sessions, lever pressing gradually declines and eventually stops. Drug-seeking behaviors are therefore said to be extinguished. It is then possible to test various stimuli in order to investigate whether they reinstate drug-seeking behaviors and use such a reinstatement as an animal model of drug relapse. Three types of stimuli have been shown to reinstate drug-seeking behaviors: a small priming dose of drug, drug-associated cues and a stressful stimuli. The effects of these three relapse-triggering stimuli are mediated by different neurobiological mechanisms, leading to the expectation that they may be targeted by different pharmacotherapeutic and behavioral interventions. Despite the high value of the current animal models of drug addiction, there show several limitations. In particular, it is difficult to differentiate between self-controlled and compulsive drug use in animals. As only uncontrolled compulsive drug consumption characterizes drug addiction in humans, such a limitation might explain the high frequency of false positive results in animal experiments. Indeed, it is common that therapeutic interventions successfully developed in animals later proved to be disappointing in humans...|$|R
40|$|Impulsiveness {{is seen as}} a {{clinical}} symptom in several psychiatric disorders. It is used as a diagnostic criterion for impulsive-control disorders, personality disorders, borderline personality disorders, antisocial personality disorders and in mania. It {{can be found in the}} expression of different behaviours. In human medicine impulsivity is commonly linked to disorders such as impulsive aggression, violent behaviour, but also in drinking or sexual behaviour. In veterinary medicine impulsivity is not just referred to aggressive behaviour, what can be defined as reduction or a complete lack of warning signals previous to attack. It is probably also linked to behavioural disorders such as seperation anxiety, storm and noise phobia. Impulsivity is more a sign than a diagnosis itself. So far, the construction of impulsiveness has not been sufficiently clarified. It has been proposed that there is an inverse relationship between the central serotonergic system and impulsive behaviour. Particularly the serotonergic metabolite 5 -hydroxyindoleacetic (5 -HIAA) seems to play an important role in the regulatory mechanisms of impulsivity. Research in humans and animals demonstrates the association between impulsive behaviour resp. lack of impulsive-control with a decreased level of 5 -HIAA. It is a very important question how to measure impulsive behaviour. Some animal models have been developed, but not very extinsively. The delay of reinforcement method is one of the methods, which stand the test. Animals have to choose between a single pellet (small reinforcer) delivered immediately or a larger amount of food pellets (large reinforcer) delivered after a delay. The preference for the immediate reward, that means the intolerance to delay has been proposed to reflect impulsive behaviour, conversely, preference for the delayed reward would indicate self-contol. The aim of this study is the development of a method for measuring impulsivity in rats, what does not exist in research institutes in Germany so far. Based on the delay of reinforcement method by EVENDEN and RYAN (1996) the present study used the Skinner Box with two different levers. The development of the method includes a period of four weeks for conditioning rats to combine lever pressing with emission of food. They also have to distinguish between the two different levers. Rats were given the choice between a single food pellet (small reinforcer) delivered immediately or a large amount of 12 pellets (large reinforcer) delivered after a delay. Before using a conditioning program it is very important to figure out how many days for conditioning rats on lever pressing are required. Other components for developing a method for measuring impulsivity are also important, such as duration of the daily session, amount of food pellets as large reward and the maximum of delay before delivering the large reward. With knownledge of all these aspects a conditioning program for rats has been developed. The conditioning of rats is the basic for using the delay of reinforcement. Three rat strains (Fischer/Winkelmann, Wistar/Winkelmann, Wistar/BgVV) were used. During the training session the Fischer/Winkelmann-rats did not explore the chamber and therefore did not <b>start</b> pressing the <b>levers.</b> The Fischer-rats were not suitable for the experiments of our study. The pharmacological investigations were carried out on two different Wistar stocks (Wistar/Winkelmann and Wistar/BgVV). We investigated whether impulsive behaviour of Wistar/Winkelmann-rats and Wistar/BgVV-rats is affected by treatment with clomipramine, selegiline or diazepam. The behaviour of Wistar/Winkelmann-rats was not significantly affected by treatment with clomipramine, whereas the number of lever presses by Wistar/BgVV-rats was decreased. Clomipramine reduced the activity of Wistar/BgVV-rats. Indeed, clomipramine had neither influence on impulsive behaviour of Wistar/Winkelmann-rats nor on impulsive behaviour of Wistar/BgVV-rats. Selegiline significantly increased the activity of Wistar/Winkelmann-rats and Wistar/BgVV-rats, but did not influence the impulsive behaviour of both Wistar stocks. The application of the highest dose of diazepam in our experiments induced an increase of the frequency of choice of the small reward by Wistar/Winkelmann-rats. Therefore, diazepam increased the impulsivity of Wistar/Winkelmann-rats. The impulsive behaviour of Wistar/BgVV-rats was not affected by treatment with diazepam. In our study Fischer-rats and Wistar-rats showed different baseline levels of exploratory behaviour. Fischer-rats appear to be more anxious than Wistar-rats. Additionally, it appears that the different effects of diazepam on behaviour of Wistar/Winkelmann-rats and Wistar/BgVV-rats can be traced back to differences of their base impulsivity-related behaviour. Differences in the baseline behaviour might have an influence on the effects of pharmacotherapeutics and could produce both false or negative results. Strain and stock differences should be taken into consideration in future investigations. In conclusion, there is a necessity to develop new therapeutics agents for treatment impulsivity both in human medicine and veterinary science. Hence, further work is required on a similar approach to improve animal models for measuring impulsivity and beyond it getting specific knowledge of serotonergic processes in impulsive-related behaviour...|$|R
