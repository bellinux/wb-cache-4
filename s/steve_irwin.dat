5000|$|Bindi the Jungle Girl is an Australian children's {{television}} nature documentary series, {{presented by}} Bindi Irwin, {{the daughter of}} <b>Steve</b> and Terri <b>Irwin.</b> The series is produced and shot in Queensland by The Best Picture Show Company for Discovery Kids and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The first series was scheduled for 26 episodes, and ran from 9 June 2007 until 31 May 2008 on American networks Discovery Kids and simulcast on Animal Planet and on ABC1 in Australia from 18 July 2007. Also appearing on the show are Bindi's mother Terri, her younger brother Robert, and Steve Irwin's [...] "best mate" [...] and director of Australia Zoo, Wes Mannion.

25|$|Series co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone {{said that}} they were {{surprised}} to see the <b>Steve</b> <b>Irwin</b> depiction cause so much controversy, essentially since they felt South Park has featured far more offensive material.|$|E
5000|$|Windowboxing (also called {{either the}} [...] "postage stamp effect", [...] "gutterboxing", or [...] "matchboxing") {{in the display}} of film or video occurs when the aspect ratio of the media is such that the {{letterbox}} effect and pillarbox effect occur simultaneously. Sometimes, by accident or design, a standard ratio image {{is presented in the}} central portion of a letterbox picture (or vice versa), resulting in a black border all around. It is generally disliked because it wastes much screen space and reduces the resolution of the original image. It can occur when a 16:9 film is set to 4:3 (letterbox), but then shown on a 16:9 TV or other output device. It can also occur in the opposite direction (4:3 to 16:9 to 4:3). Few films have been released with this aspect ratio - one example is The Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course, which had numerous scenes with <b>Steve</b> & Terri <b>Irwin</b> using widescreen pillar boxing.|$|R

25|$|The {{last of the}} Island type, FPV Westra was {{launched}} in 1975 and decommissioned in 2003. The vessel was purchased by Sea Shepherd Conservation Society in 2006 and was renamed MY Robert Hunter in memory {{of one of the}} two founding members of Greenpeace. The vessel has since been renamed MY <b>Steve</b> <b>Irwin</b> after the death of the famous conservationist TV personality. The <b>Steve</b> <b>Irwin</b> has become a popularly recognised ship due to the Animal Planet television programme Whale Wars which documents the work of Sea Shepherd including their use of the vessel. The Island type were offshore patrol vessels with a displacement of 1,017 tonnes and a maximum speed of 16.5 knots. In contrast to the more modern vessel types, the Island type could only remain on patrol for 16–18 days.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{existence}} of snake charmers, {{there have also been}} professional snake catchers or wranglers. Modern-day snake trapping involves a herpetologist using a long stick with a V- shaped end. Some television show hosts, like Bill Haast, Austin Stevens, <b>Steve</b> <b>Irwin,</b> and Jeff Corwin, prefer to catch them using bare hands.|$|E
25|$|The Lego {{character}} Johnny Thunder {{is derived}} from Indiana Jones, among other influences. For one, he is Australian (like <b>Steve</b> <b>Irwin</b> the Crocodile Hunter). His clothes are also different, as he sports a slouch hat instead of a fedora, a red bandanna, and a tan shirt. Plus, he has a visible mustache and sideburns.|$|E
25|$|PETA is {{critical}} of television personalities they call self-professed wildlife warriors, arguing that while a conservationist message is getting across, some of the actions are harmful to animals, such as invading animals' homes, netting them, subjecting them to stressful environments, and wrestling with them—often involving young animals the group says should be with their mothers. In 2006 when <b>Steve</b> <b>Irwin</b> died, PETA's vice-president Dan Mathews said Irwin had {{made a career out}} of antagonizing frightened wild animals. Australian Member of Parliament Bruce Scott said PETA should apologize to Irwin's family and the rest of Australia.|$|E
25|$|In season 21, Bindi Irwin had her {{payments}} withheld by a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge {{because she}} was a minor, which therefore required her parents to sign-off on the contract. But although her mother signed, the contract lacked her father's signature, so the judge refused to validate the contract, despite Irwin's father being the world-famous naturalist <b>Steve</b> <b>Irwin,</b> whose death in 2006 had been widely covered in the news/media. The judge later validated the contract once Steve Irwin's death certificate was presented to the court, resulting in Bindi receiving a $350,000 paycheck from the show.|$|E
25|$|The Japanese whaling fleet {{had several}} clashes with anti-whaling protesters and activists from various groups, {{including}} the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, endeavoring to follow, document and disrupt the whaling fleet since the 2005–2006 season. On January 15, 2008 two crew members traveling on the MV <b>Steve</b> <b>Irwin</b> boarded the whaling ship Yushin Maru 2 without permission and were subsequently detained {{on board the}} ship {{for a number of}} days. Japan claimed that four crew members on board a Japanese whaling ship in Antarctic waters were injured March 3, 2008 when the anti-whaling group threw butyric acid on board.|$|E
25|$|In November 2005 The Pinball Factory (TPF) in Melbourne, Australia, {{announced}} {{that they would be}} producing a new Crocodile Hunter-themed pinball machine under the Bally label. With the death of <b>Steve</b> <b>Irwin,</b> it was {{announced that}} the future of this game was uncertain. In 2006 TPF {{announced that they}} would be reproducing two popular 90's era Williams machines, Medieval Madness and Cactus Canyon. TPF however was unable to make good on its promises to produce new machines, and in October 2010 transferred its Williams Electronics Games licenses as well as its pinball spare parts manufacturing and distribution business to Planetary Pinball Supply Inc, a California distributor of pinball replacement parts.|$|E
25|$|In 1994 Anglia Television was {{acquired}} by finance and media group MAI, and subsequently became part of United Broadcasting & Entertainment, with Survival and Partridge Films linked in a natural history production business called United Wildlife. The mid-1990s saw a shift of emphasis in ITV towards presenter-led wildlife shows, notably those featuring <b>Steve</b> <b>Irwin</b> and Nigel Marven. Survival Specials continued to be commissioned, and generally achieved good audience ratings, although as stand-alone programmes in an increasingly volatile schedule, their slots were vulnerable to change or cancellation. Survival broke with tradition and engaged an on-camera presenter when Gaby Roslin fronted a six-part series of half-hour shows in 1995 under the title Predators, screened by ITV in a Sunday evening slot. Despite good ratings, however, a second series was not commissioned.|$|E
25|$|The 1990s brought many changes: Bob and Lyn {{retired and}} moved to Rosedale, Queensland, while Steve and Terri changed {{the name of their}} now growing {{wildlife}} park to Australia Zoo in 1998. As filming generated extra funds, Steve and Terri put all money raised from filming and merchandise into conservation and building new exhibits. Their philosophy was that the zoo animals came first, the zoo team came second, and the zoo visitors came third. The zoo also expanded with the creation of a management team and hiring around 50 staff. Australia Zoo won the Australian Tourism Awards for 2003-2004 in the category Major Tourist Attraction. In 2004, the Australian Animal Hospital was opened next to the zoo to help with animal care and rehabilitation. The facility was built in an old avocado packing shed, and was dedicated to Lyn. The facility had a single operating room, and with a staff of 20 full-time workers and 80 volunteers, it cared for up to 6,000 animals per year. <b>Steve</b> <b>Irwin</b> died in 2006, the same year Australia Zoo Retail won the Tourism Retailing Award from Qantas Australian Tourism Awards.|$|E

500|$|Irwin {{founded the}} <b>Steve</b> <b>Irwin</b> Conservation Foundation, which became an {{independent}} charity {{and was later}} renamed [...] "Wildlife Warriors Worldwide".

500|$|Performances in London {{attracted}} much expatriate support; Fanning joked, [...] "I think I {{have about}} 14 English fans". The performances were received positively; musicOMH's Barnaby Smith rated his 4 September showing at London's Arts Theatre four stars, commenting on Powderfinger-esque [...] "loud, anthemic, guitar-driven rock in a '70s vein", and praising Fanning's utilisation {{of the piano}} and guitar {{as part of his}} performance, as well as his dedicating the song [...] "Give It All Up" [...] to the recently deceased <b>Steve</b> <b>Irwin.</b>|$|E
500|$|Irwin, {{after his}} death, was {{described}} by Mark Townend, CEO of RSPCA Queensland, as a [...] "modern-day Noah." [...] British naturalist David Bellamy lauded his skills as a natural historian and media performer. Canadian environmentalist David Suzuki paid tribute to Irwin, noting that [...] "umanity will not protect that which we fear or do not understand. <b>Steve</b> <b>Irwin</b> helped us understand those things that many people thought were a nuisance at best, a horror at worst. That made him a great educator and conservationist." ...|$|E
500|$|The phrase has {{influenced}} a similar phrase {{used in the}} Tok Pisin language in Papua New Guinea. No worries utilization migrated to New Zealand after origination in Australia. Its usage became more common in British English after increased usage in Australian soap operas that aired on television in the United Kingdom. Linguistics experts are uncertain how the phrase became utilized in American English; theories include use by <b>Steve</b> <b>Irwin</b> on the television program The Crocodile Hunter and usage by the United States media during the 2000 Sydney Olympics. It has also gained usage in Canadian English [...]|$|E
500|$|Specific controversies {{regarding}} the show have included an April Fools' Day prank played on its viewers in 1998, its {{depiction of the}} Virgin Mary in the season nine (2005) finale [...] "Bloody Mary" [...] which angered several Catholics, its depiction of <b>Steve</b> <b>Irwin</b> with a stingray barb stuck in his chest in the episode [...] "Hell on Earth 2006", which originally aired {{less than two months}} after Irwin was killed in the same fashion, and Comedy Central's censorship of the depiction of Muhammad in the season 10 episode [...] "Cartoon Wars Part II" [...] {{in the wake of the}} Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy.|$|E
500|$|According to The Sunday Mail a 2004 {{newspaper}} report {{notes that}} [...] "no worries" [...] {{has begun to}} be used in American English. Writing in a 2004 article for The Advertiser, Samela Harris comments: [...] "The Americans have no idea of the etymology of 'no worries'. So, while they may cheerily adopt our 'no worries' mantra, 'no worries' will never catch on as an attitude." [...] According to Tom Dalzell, author of two books on slang usage in the United States, linguistics experts are not certain how the expression became popular in that country. Usage of the term by <b>Steve</b> <b>Irwin</b> on The Crocodile Hunter, as well as attempts by members of the American press to imitate the expression during the 2000 Sydney Olympics, have been put forth as theories explaining the pervasiveness of the expression in the United States. Linguistics professor Kate Burridge writes in her 2004 book Weeds In the Garden Of Words that expressions including [...] "no worries", [...] "absolutely", and [...] "bottom line" [...] have become less prevalent in favor of newer sayings. The phrase has had some usage in Canadian English.|$|E
500|$|The atomic {{bombings of}} Hiroshima and Nagasaki are {{identified}} {{as the cause of}} Japanese whaling. The two Japanese cities were destroyed by atomic weapons during the final stages of World War II under orders by U.S. President Harry Truman, which killed about 220,000 people. In [...] "Whale Whores", the Japanese are presented with a doctored picture of the Enola Gay, the B-29 Superfortress bomber that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima. The picture shows a dolphin and a whale piloting the plane to bomb the city. The Miami Dolphins, a National Football League professional football team, are killed along with real dolphins by the whalers in [...] "Whale Whores". Near the end of the episode, Stan and the crew of the MY <b>Steve</b> <b>Irwin</b> encounter fishing ship captain Sig Hansen and his crew from the Discovery Channel reality series, Deadliest Catch. The scene with Paul Watson's crew throwing [...] "stinky butter" [...] at the whalers refers to Watson and his crew's practice of throwing stink bombs containing butyric acid, an acid found in rancid butter and cheese, at Japanese whaling vessels, including the factory vessel, the Nisshin Maru.|$|E
500|$|Criticism of Irwin's career {{following}} his death came from Dan Mathews, vice-president {{of the animal}} rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. Comparing Irwin to a [...] "cheap reality TV star", Mathews accused him of [...] "antagonising frightened wild animals ... a very dangerous message to send to children", contrasted his methods with the behaviour of [...] "a responsible conservationist like Jacques Cousteau", {{and said it was}} [...] "no shock at all that <b>Steve</b> <b>Irwin</b> should die provoking a dangerous animal." [...] The son of Jacques Cousteau, Jean-Michel Cousteau—also a producer of wildlife documentaries—took issue with Irwin's [...] "very, very spectacular, dramatic way of presenting things" [...] and suggested instead that [...] "You don't touch nature, you just look at it." [...] Jacques Cousteau's grandson and Jean-Michel's nephew, Philippe Cousteau Jr., on the other hand, called Irwin [...] "a remarkable individual"; describing the Ocean's Deadliest project (on which he worked along with Irwin), Philippe said, [...] "I think why Steve was so excited about it that we were looking at these animals that people think of as, you know, dangerous and deadly monsters, and they're not. They all have an important place in the environment and in the world. And that was what his whole message was about." ...|$|E
