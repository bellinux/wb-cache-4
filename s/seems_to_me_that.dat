5|$|To begin with, {{every one}} must buy this {{book for the}} {{following}} aesthetic reasons: First, because I know where there is the cutest cloth of gold dress for only $300 in a store on Forty-second Street, and, also, if enough people buy it {{where there is a}} platinum ring with a complete circlet, and, also, if loads of people buy it my husband needs a new winter overcoat, although the one he has done well enough for the last three years... It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> on one page I recognized a portion of an old diary of mine which mysteriously disappeared shortly after my marriage, and, also, scraps of letters which, though considerably edited, sound to me vaguely familiar. In fact, Mr. Fitzgerald—I believe that is how he spells his name—seems to believe that plagiarism begins at home.|$|E
25|$|It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> Berlin {{would not}} be at all {{suitable}} for me while M.Euler is there.|$|E
25|$|I'm {{a little}} baffled {{as to why}} Stirling set this book in 1998. It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> it {{requires}} more suspension of disbelief to pretend the world ended {{in the past when}} we know it didn't.|$|E

[...] "When you entered the room a few seconds ago, it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> a miracle had happened. It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the dead had come to life." ...|$|R

25|$|The {{discovery}} of nuclear fission by Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann {{opened up a}} new era in human history. It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> what makes the science behind this discovery so remarkable is that it was achieved by purely chemical means.|$|E
25|$|Erasmus said of Colet, “When I {{listen to}} Colet it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I am {{listening}} to Plato himself.” Erasmus likely portrayed Colet {{to show that}} one could be {{highly critical of the}} Church while still a loyal priest. His depiction of Colet was partly a depiction of himself.|$|E
25|$|It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> at Netley all {{consideration}} {{of what would}} best tend to the comfort and recovery of the patients has been sacrificed to the vanity of the architect, whose sole object has been to make a building which should cut a dash when looked at from Southampton River. Pray stop all work.|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the man's iron repose was shaken.|$|R
60|$|I hesitated. It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> Grooten {{was taking}} {{a great deal for}} granted.|$|R

25|$|Some {{languages}} have {{a distinct}} grammatical category of evidentiality {{that is required}} to be expressed at all times. The elements in European languages indicating the information source are optional and usually do not indicate evidentiality as their primary function — thus they do not form a grammatical category. The obligatory elements of grammatical evidentiality systems may be translated into English, variously, as I hear that, I see that, I think that, as I hear, as I can see, as far as I understand, they say, it is said, it seems, it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that,</b> it looks like, it appears that, it turns out that, alleged, stated, allegedly, reportedly, obviously, etc.|$|E
25|$|I {{have long}} been gravitating towards the Socialist {{position}} — {{of course there is}} Socialism and Socialism, and mine is of the reasonable and moderate kind. When I look over my public efforts through the years, it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I have been a Socialist all my life. So far as any Party can express what appears to me to be the country's needs, the ILP approximates nearer to my outlook that any other, although I still look forward to and hope for the day when all really progressive forces can unite under the title of the Democratic Party. But Liberalism as represented by both wings — the Lloyd George wing, and the Asquith wing, is right outside my outlook now.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} of 'fair and reasonable' {{must therefore be}} something else, and I cannot think of any other standard appropriate than the normal needs of an average employee, regarded {{as a human being}} in a civilised community. If, instead of individual bargaining, one can conceive of a collective agreement - an agreement between all the employers in a given trade on the one side, and all the employees on the other - it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the framers of the agreement would have to take as the first and dominant factor the cost of living as a civilised being. If A lets B have the use of his horses on the terms that he gives them fair and reasonable treatment, I have no doubt that it is B's duty to give them proper food and water, and such shelter and rest as they need; and, as wages are the means of obtaining commodities, surely the State in stipulating for fair and reasonable remuneration for the employees means that the wages shall be sufficient to provide these things, and clothing and a condition of frugal comfort estimated by current human standards.|$|E
60|$|The Baron hesitated. It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> he was {{peering into}} the shadows beyond the hedge.|$|R
60|$|I {{was utterly}} stunned; {{it had not}} <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> any wound could be mortal to him.|$|R
60|$|Lady Delahaye {{raised her}} eyebrows. It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{in a quiet}} way she was {{becoming}} angry.|$|R
500|$|Goldman's anarchism was {{intensely}} personal. She {{believed it}} was necessary for anarchist thinkers to live their beliefs, demonstrating their convictions with every action and word. [...] "I don't care if a man's theory for tomorrow is correct," [...] she once wrote. [...] "I care if his spirit of today is correct." [...] Anarchism and free association were to her logical responses to the confines of government control and capitalism. [...] "It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> these are the new forms of life," [...] she wrote, [...] "and that they will take the place of the old, not by preaching or voting, but by living them." ...|$|E
500|$|A little {{matter that}} seems to have been {{overlooked}} by all of you is the opportunity to beautify the design of the nickel or five cent piece during your administration, and it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> it would be a permanent souvenir of a most attractive sort. [...] As possibly you are aware, it is the only coin the design of which you can change during your administration, as I believe there is a law to the effect that the designs must not be changed oftener than every twenty-five years. [...] I should think also it might be the coin of which the greatest numbers are in circulation.|$|E
500|$|In 1889, Yeats met Maud Gonne, a 23-year-old English heiress and ardent Irish Nationalist. She was {{eighteen}} months younger than Yeats and later claimed {{she met the}} poet as a [...] "paint-stained art student." [...] Gonne admired [...] "The Island of Statues" [...] and sought out his acquaintance. Yeats began an obsessive infatuation, {{and she had a}} significant and lasting effect on his poetry and his life thereafter. In later years he admitted, [...] "it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> she [...] brought into my life those days—for as yet I saw only what lay upon the surface—the middle of the tint, a sound as of a Burmese gong, an over-powering tumult that had yet many pleasant secondary notes." [...] Yeats's love was unrequited, in part due to his reluctance to participate in her nationalist activism.|$|E
60|$|Lestrade {{shook his}} head, though it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> his manner was less {{absolutely}} assured than before.|$|R
60|$|There was a moment's silence. It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the Duke was {{watching}} me with peculiar intentness.|$|R
60|$|I {{raised my}} eyebrows at this. It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> Mr. de Valentin was {{going a little}} too far.|$|R
500|$|In an 1896 {{interview}} with Herbert P. Williams, {{a reporter for}} the Boston Herald, Crane said that he did [...] "not find that short stories are utterly different in character from other fiction. [...] It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> short stories are the easiest things we write." [...] During his brief literary career, he wrote more than a hundred short stories and fictional sketches. [...] Crane's early fiction was based in camping expeditions in his teen years; these stories eventually became known as The Sullivan County Tales and Sketches. [...] He considered these [...] "sketches", which are mostly humorous and not of the same caliber of work as his later fiction, to be [...] "articles of many kinds," [...] in that they are part fiction and part journalism.|$|E
500|$|Megadeth toured {{heavily in}} support of Youthanasia. They started the tour in November 1994, with live {{performances}} in South America. The tour continued in 1995, {{with a number of}} opening acts such as Korn, Flotsam and Jetsam and Fear Factory. During this period Megadeth also visited Europe, where they stayed for eight weeks. Ellefson shared his impressions from performing in front of European fans: [...] "So far, the audiences have been really good and it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> heavy metal and especially Megadeth are very much at the forefront of music in Europe. It seems like the attendance is better than it has ever been". The worldwide tour ended in September 1995, with the band performing at Monsters Of Rock in South America with Ozzy Osbourne and Alice Cooper as the headliners.|$|E
500|$|He bemoaned the Conservatives {{when they}} were in Opposition, criticising Michael Howard in particular: [...] "I knew Michael Howard {{was going to be a}} {{disaster}} as soon as he opposed top-up fees, either out of sentimentality or calculated expediency so that it might get him a bit of the student vote...Instead of backing Tony Blair, causing revolution in the Labour Party, the Conservatives have been whoring after strange gods, coming up with increasingly strange policies." [...] He likened Gordon Brown to the fictional Kenneth Widmerpool, continuing, [...] "It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> with Brown there is a complete sense of humour and charm bypass." [...] Of Ed Miliband, in 2015 he said [...] "He is a man of high ambition and low talent – the worst possible combination. [...] His whole language at the moment is soak the rich, hate the rich." ...|$|E
60|$|At these ominous {{words the}} envoys shivered, and it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> their faces {{for a moment}} turned grey.|$|R
60|$|My visitor did {{not remove}} {{his hand from}} the gate. It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> his tone became more belligerent.|$|R
60|$|It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{something}} like a wink quivered for an instant over one of Mr. Baynes's tiny eyes.|$|R
500|$|In the {{beginning}} of 1850, Fuller wrote to a friend: [...] "It has long seemed that in the year 1850 I should stand on some important plateau in the ascent of life... I feel however no marked and important change as yet." [...] Also that year, Fuller wrote: [...] "I am absurdly fearful and various omens have combined {{to give me a}} dark feeling... It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> my future upon earth will soon close... I have a vague expectation of some crisis—I know not what". A few days after writing this, Fuller, Ossoli, and their child began a five-week return voyage to the United States aboard the ship Elizabeth, an American merchant freighter carrying cargo that included mostly marble from Carrara. They set sail on May 17. At sea, the ship's captain, Seth Hasty, died of smallpox. Angelino contracted the disease and recovered.|$|E
500|$|Paranhos {{was left}} behind when Carneiro Leão {{returned}} to Brazil, having been named Brazil's diplomatic minister to Uruguay. Paranhos' time in Uruguay allowed him to acquire {{an understanding of the}} dynamics characterizing Hispanic American nations of the period. Intermittent crises leading to and resulting from coups, government by dictators, political factionalism and civil wars were commonplace among these countries. A penchant for, and skill in, diplomacy became evident during his stay—as a pleased Viscount of Uruguai, still Minister of Foreign Affairs, noted in February 1853: [...] "In a general manner, I approve of what our diplomatic representatives do; however, it almost always <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that,</b> were I in their places, I would have done better. But with Dr. Paranhos that thought does not occur to me. Every time I read his communiqués, I tell myself: 'This is precisely what I would have done or said.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{concert was}} {{telecast}} {{live by the}} National Broadcasting Company (NBC) {{to an audience of}} 26 million viewers. As part of its program, NBC asked Copland to talk to the television audience about Connotations. While the cameras alternated between shots of the composer and the manuscript score, Copland said, [...] "It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> there are two things you can do when listening to any new work. The {{most important thing is to}} lend yourself—or to put it another way—try to be as sensitive as you can to the overall feeling the new piece gives off. The second way is to listen with some awareness of the general shape of the new piece, realizing that a composer works with his musical materials just as an architect works with his building materials in order to construct an edifice that makes sense." [...] He then discussed the work briefly but in some detail.|$|E
60|$|It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the Archduchess and Lady Delahaye {{exchanged}} quick glances. I affected, however, to {{have noticed}} nothing.|$|R
60|$|It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{there was}} a sort of {{something}} in her voice, a kind of thingummy, you know.|$|R
60|$|It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> George harped {{too much}} on the getting-upset idea. It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> the wrong spirit to go about the trip in.|$|R
