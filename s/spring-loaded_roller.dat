50|$|Wire or {{wire rope}} is {{inserted}} into a channel in the Gripple wire joiner, {{where it is}} gripped by a <b>spring-loaded</b> <b>roller</b> or wedge, and tensioned by being pulled through. The channel is mirrored {{on the opposite side}} of the Gripple wire joiner, allowing a second piece of wire to be joined.|$|E
50|$|Most {{retractable}} doors use a <b>spring-loaded</b> <b>roller</b> {{very similar}} to a window blind, except the roller is mounted vertically when used in a door application. Screen material {{is attached to the}} roller while {{the opposite side of the}} material is attached to sliding bar riding on top and bottom tracks. The bar is moved back and forth to open or close the screen. The bar is usually held closed with a magnetic closure. Different types of mesh fabric options are available from standard fiberglass mesh, pet screen resistant mesh and solar screen mesh. The operation of the screens are manually or motorized.|$|E
50|$|Two {{solutions}} {{to this problem}} appeared {{in the early spring}} powered clocks in the 15th century: the stackfreed and the fusee. The stackfreed was an eccentric cam mounted on the mainspring arbor, with a <b>spring-loaded</b> <b>roller</b> that pressed against it. The cam was shaped so that early in the running period when the mainspring was pushing strongly, the stackfreed would provide an opposing force, while later when the mainspring was almost run down and pushing weakly, it would provide a helping force. The stackfreed added a lot of friction and probably reduced a clock's running time substantially; it was rarely used and was abandoned after about a century.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Spring-loaded</b> <b>rollers</b> - As {{the name}} indicates, the rollers in this pump are {{mounted on a}} spring. This design is more {{elaborate}} than the fixed occlusion, but helps overcome the variations in the tube wall thickness over a broader range. Regardless of the variations, the roller imparts {{the same amount of}} stress on the tubing that is proportional to the spring constant, making this a constant stress operation. The spring is selected to overcome not only the hoop strength of the tubing, but also the pressure of the pumped fluid.|$|R
50|$|Forward and {{rearward}} shift detent grooves are broached on {{the front}} of the main-shaft with a <b>spring-loaded</b> anti-friction <b>roller,</b> for more precise control of shift detents and positive shift feel.|$|R
40|$|The {{speech in}} this article is going about the {{standard}} bush-roller chain for bicycle, machine-tool or for conveyor. And the chain can be settled in the different spatial position, namely in vertical, horizontal or in the slope. In all these cases we have to stretch the chain periodically because of wear during the operation. For this aim the people apply different contact methods: <b>spring-loaded</b> <b>rollers,</b> flat springs (as a pair of friction), stretchers and so on [2, 3]. But here we describe a new way how to stretch the chain constantly and without any additional pairs of friction at all [1, 2, 3] using only magnet. It simplified design and enhanced the resistance against wear essentially...|$|R
5000|$|Pop-up displays: (These are {{sometimes}} called a pull-up display or portable display) A display {{which uses a}} flexible graphic panel (fabric or other man-made material) attached to a <b>spring-loaded</b> <b>roller</b> on which the graphic winds for storage. When ready to display, the graphic is pulled up, and then secured to a support post {{at the back of}} the roller, which holds the graphic up and taut in place. These can be used individually, or in series, as warrants. Like tabletop displays, they are normally very lightweight, and can be easily transported and set up without needing much on site labor support. The components are often made from very lightweight materials, and transported in small traveling cases (often injection molded plastic). Most often curved in shape, they are also now popular as straight walls with attached fabric mural graphics.|$|E
40|$|T-handle wrench can be preset {{to release}} when a certain torque value is {{exceeded}} {{by means of}} a <b>spring-loaded</b> <b>roller</b> and groove torque-limiting mechanism contained in the handle of the wrench. The wrench is also equipped with a push button in the handle that permits the operator to lock the handle to the spindle shaft, thus eliminating the torque-limiting function...|$|E

50|$|A more {{sophisticated}} and rugged design has <b>spring-loaded</b> steel <b>rollers</b> inside a driven cylinder. Rotating in one direction, the rollers lock with the cylinder making it rotate in unison. Rotating slower, or in the other direction, the steel rollers just slip inside the cylinder.|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} for the {{isolation}} of the nuclei from plant tissue has been devised. This method consists in passing the plant tissue through a set of <b>spring-loaded,</b> counter-rotating <b>rollers</b> and collecting the liberated nuclei in sucrose solution containing calcium ions. A semiautomatic machine which couples the rollers with a special tissue chopping device has been constructed. It has been shown that nuclei obtained in this way actively incorporate cytidine-H 3 into RNA. This incorporation is increased in the presence of nucleoside triphosphates and an energy-regenerating system...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{methods for}} measuring displacements and end {{moments in the}} testing of thin-walled columns. The complete spatial deformation of a column can be captured by using local and overall deformation measurement frames. The local frame involves <b>spring-loaded</b> levers and <b>roller</b> bearings to mount the frame on to the specimen. The overall frame slides along high-precision shafts using linear ball bearings. Fixed-ended bearings are used to measure minor and major axis bending moments {{as well as the}} applied load. The bearings allow the line of action of the applied force to be determined. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|A Linear Belt Filter was {{installed}} {{to replace the}} existing cush-cush removal equipment on the milling tandem at Maidstone. The Linear Belt Filter consists of a feed box under which runs a continuous filter cloth and the screen frame. The filtered juice falls by gravity into ajuice collecting box and is pumped to the juice scales. The cush-cush is carried on the screen to the discharge end of the filter and is squeezed by a <b>spring-loaded</b> small diameter <b>roller</b> before falling into a screw conveyor leading to the discharge ofthe first mill. Results of performance tests as well as operating procedures and problems are discussed...|$|R
