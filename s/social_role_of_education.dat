40|$|Neo-liberalism {{has become}} the {{backdrop}} to the changes in world-wide educational policy, which are no longer limited to cut-backs in resources or privatisation but which actually affect {{the very core of}} educational theory and pedagogical politics on a fundamental level. The conflicts which spill over into the school represent part of a more generalised crisis in politics and citizenship in global capitalism. Using the argument that education should meet the demands of society, an evidently reductionalist interpretation is made by which society sees school and university solely in terms of their usefulness to business, and centres education around the preparation of the type of professionals demanded by companies. According to this philosophy, investment in education and the curriculum should be tailored {{to meet the needs of}} the market, and seen as a preparation for the labour market. The <b>social</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>education,</b> as a training ground for democracy and citizenship, is now seen as a waste of public funds, and has been replaced by the view private companies have of the function of education: as a training ground for meeting the needs of business. A “flexible” and “multi-purpose” employee thus constitutes the new ideal reference point for pedagogy...|$|E

The {{philosophical}} {{reflections of}} this article aim to study the epistemological and paradigmatic problems inherent in the processes of educational transformation. The study combines the transdisciplinary methodology with Complexity Theory to organize knowledge horizontally, without hierarchizing the different epistemes that co-exist in the same space-time. From this epistemological perspective, research shows that individuals know, think, and act according to the cultural paradigms inscribed in them. Hence the {{need to create a}} liberating education that sows seeds of human emancipation in the 21 st century. In this sense, the work analyzes paradigmatic constraints that transcend human training through the study of our human relationships and <b>social</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>education</b> in the social and natural environment. Sustainable development requires reorienting our models of life within the biophysical limits of nature, without compromising ecosystem regeneration neither a dignity development of our next generations. This is an investigation that aims to contribute to the debate between philosophy and sociology of education through co-evolutionary vision that integrates the human being in his cosmic and earthly context. As a result, it is discussed philosophically about the paradigmatic conditions that occur in the field of sociology of education. In conclusion, it is argued that education represents a paradigmatic transformation tool when it is promoted an ecology of knowledge that combines scientific reason with other epistemic, spiritual, religious, emotional, political, rhetorical, poetic, artistic, and philosophical aspects...|$|E

Intends to show that this relationship goes beyond a theoretical tight, placing herself as construction moved by an impulse ethical. Thus, this article guard his own theory and want to express the importance of self-practical understanding of ethical theories, and theories of education. In the intention to substantiate the relationship between theory and practice, the paper discusses the theories of some authors who have addressed {{the question of the}} <b>social</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>education,</b> such as István Mészáros and Humberto Maturana. The subject of ethics education as the means of education as emancipation which became known from the writings of Theodor Adorno. The path to awakening of an education as ethics goes through critical discourse capable of staging the importance of dialogue. The ultimate intention of this article is, therefore, favor the construction of a concept of education as ethics from the idea of dialogue as emancipation, while reproposes emancipation as a principle and method of education themselves. In this context, the analysis is positioning education as a discourse, as conservation practice, against which we must now propose the hypothesis of a counter-practice education.

40|$|Indefensibly, {{we are in}} a {{world that}} has been colonized by global economies and the {{interests}} of the market. This makes us think about the urgent need of getting back in touch with the historical and <b>social</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>education,</b> thus looking back at the past, valuing the present, and envisioning the future. Indisputably, today we need cognitive and epistemological intelligence and, most of all, spiritual intelligence, the will needed to fiercely struggle to fulfill the ideal and the principle of the educational essence: social justice understood as the direction that inspires us from a deep and generous perspective. This implies estimating the variability and diversity of a world whose framework of relations and correlations make it hard to understand and face. Therefore, not only a deep and critically rigorous look is needed, but also an ontological and axiological basis that help us promote the development of transformations from the ethics of alterity, thus promoting that our reflections, and mainly our actions, allow the understanding required to confront, with genuine courage and intelligence –the one that arises from knowledge, from understanding and being, from doing and coexisting. A vision that involves and warns that no educational process is neutral and, therefore, undergoes the filter of interpretations and subjectivities that occur in the educational environments and that the market logic covers up the different environments and realities where life fluctuates. Based on this, we conclude that it is our civic responsibility, in a global village -with capacity and awareness, to combine expertise, knowledge, and affections in order to rediscover the universal awareness that makes it possible to educate in social justice –by it and for it. This includes the power to interact from writing -based on the legitimacy not only given by a university degree, but also from shared knowledge, from experience {{in and out of the}} classroom, and from life itself, which, after all, is the key component of education. <br /...|$|E
40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{an activity}} based approach {{for teaching and}} learning applied in Higher Education {{to the development of}} Human Capital capability. According to the Leif Edvinsson, in one of the classic works in the area of Knowledge Management, Human Capital plays a significant role in overall Intellectual Capital. “… Intellectual capital is the sum of structural capital and human capital. Human capital refers to the knowledge, skill, and experience of the employees. Structural capital refers to the extension and manifestation of human capital. It includes tangibles such as the information technology systems, brand and company images, customer databases, organizational concepts and manuals. ” [Bucklew and Edvinsson, 1999] From other, social and economics points of view, Eva Gamarnikow and Antony Green summarised Human Capital thus: “In economic, capital refers to resources (whether financial or physical) that are used for the production of goods. It can also refer to all resources that bring in income. Social Capital and Human Capital are terms used in the social science to discuss analogous concepts with regard to social resources derived from social interaction (social capital) and individual development (human capital). “ [Gamarnicow, 2003] For Higher Education in general, and for the development of activity based teaching and learning in particular, a comprehensive understanding of human capital is essential. Gamarnikow and Green clarify: “There are at least four ways of thinking about human capital. For economists, human capital has a specific, narrow meaning: It refers to the opportunity cost of individuals' or states' investing in education-forgone earnings plus the cost of education set against expectations of future (higher) earnings and economic productivity, respectively. At the other extreme, the term human capital is often as used merely as popular shorthand for education in general. The two intermediate perspectives are much more critical and compare the human capital approach to education unfavourably with other approaches. The first of these critical perspectives focuses on the <b>social</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>education.</b> … The other critical perspective focuses on the ways in which education operates {{at the level of the}} individual. It criticises the human capital approach for reducing education to the inculcation of marketable skills rather than taking a holistic approach and educating the whole person. “ As part of its strategic plans to support development of the Knowledge-based Economy, Southampton Solent University (SSU) aims to advance appropriate programmes of study. For this purpose an activity based approach for teaching and learning is in process of deployment at Faculty of Technology at SSU. The article discusses definitions of Intellectual Capital, Human Capital, Social Capital, Knowledge Management and Knowledge, their interaction in the global information environment and in the particular context of Higher Education. It presents also the principles and design of an activity-based model for learning and teaching and relevant illustrations. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{article focuses}} {{on the impact of}} {{globalization}} and neoliberal policies on higher <b>education.</b> In view <b>of</b> a paradigm shift in the understanding <b>of</b> the <b>social</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> general <b>education</b> and knowledge in general, universities, in particular those with no direct access to the centers of global capital, are undergoing a twofold change: as research institutions, they are spontaneously being subordinated to short-term profit interests; as educational institutions, they are turning into factories for the production of “useful” knowledge. The authors show this on the example of the University of Maribor, which in its strategic documents explicitly supports the entrepreneurial type of university, at the same time trying to present the devastating effects of financial pressures as a development opportunity. The ambition for the flexibilization of labor at university puts workers in an increasingly insecure position with the quality of studies dropping rapidly; paradoxically, however, members of the academic community together with students actively and progressively assist in these processes...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} education, learning and civic participation arising from 120 biographical interviews conducted with respondents in three areas of England. Through analysis of individual biographies, {{it is argued that}} the relationship between education, learning and the generation of ‘bonding’ social capital is largely unrealistic. Rather, there emerge three loose typologies <b>of</b> relationship between <b>education</b> and civic participation: atomistic, networking and altruistic. These relationships are shaped by individual biography, type of learning and structural considerations. Class, gender and ethnicity particularly influence relationships between education and participation but not in a rigidly deterministic fashion, and may additionally be generators of creative tension. It is concluded that although policy makers would be naïve to expect investment in education and learning to automatically generate virtuous cycles <b>of</b> <b>social</b> capital, the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>education</b> in generating benefits in what can be called the ‘ecology’ of community is both unexpected and illuminating...|$|R

The dimensions involved are examined: the educational dimension, where are explored the <b>social</b> and political <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>education</b> and educational institutions; the curricular dimension, translated in objectives and actions toward the integrated courses(transdisciplinarity) and the resource-based learning; the dimension of pedagogic practices, towards problems resolution and research projects, the evaluation process, directed to competency in information. The concept is defined upon a socio-cognitive constructionist view, developed in apprentices and teachers, integrated in the curriculum.

40|$|In {{the global}} context of {{increasing}} inequalities between advantaged and disadvantaged <b>social</b> groups, the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>education</b> in achieving <b>social</b> justice {{has taken on}} new importance. In this chapter we consider two widely acclaimed books on social inequality, namely: Thomas Piketty’s Capital in the Twenty-first Century (2014) and Daniel Dorling’s Injustice: Why Inequality Persists (2010). We specifically focus on how the authors relate problems of social inequality with educational disadvantage, naming the relation in terms of meritocracy and elitism. We suggest that in the main, Piketty and Dorling hold to distributive accounts of educational disadvantage and to an income/wealth-based evaluation of social inequality. We also argue that the informational basis of Piketty’s and Dorling’s evaluation excludes an appreciation of social justice as ‘recognition’ and thus excludes the importance of ‘epistemological equity’ and of ‘agency freedom’ in pursuing social justice in educational contexts, particularly in higher education. It is through these two foci on recognitive justice that we augment Piketty’s and Dorling’s distributive account...|$|R

5000|$|Based on the {{educational}} ideas of Rousseau, Pestalozzi and Fröbel, the German headteacher Friedrich Diesterweg (1790—1866) emphasised the social relevance of pedagogy in fighting social inequalities. For him social pedagogy was [...] "educational action by which one aims {{to help the}} poor in society". Through the contribution of Diesterweg and other thinkers, such as Friedrich Schleiermacher, pedagogy took on a more <b>social</b> <b>role,</b> one <b>of</b> community <b>education</b> that also occurs in later writers like Paulo Freire and John Dewey.Although pedagogy was early on concerned with changing social conditions through education - Rousseau is most famous for his Social Contract (1762) - its primary focus had been on the individual and his or her upbringing, which Rousseau had aimed to protect from the negative influences of society. Pedagogic thinkers like Pestalozzi and later on Montessori followed in his tradition of developing a child-centred pedagogy, which was increasingly criticised by an emerging school of thought that promoted a pedagogy focused on the collective, on the community and how to use pedagogic ideas for social betterment - or a social pedagogy, as the German educationalist Karl Mager had written in 1844 for the first time.|$|R
40|$|The Bologna process {{seems to}} {{disregard}} {{one of the}} most significant recent developments in several major post-communist transition countries: the rise and rapid growth of the private sector in higher education and, more generally, the emergence of powerful market forces in higher education. * Consequently, the ideas behind the Bologna process – a major European integrating initiative in higher education started by the Bologna Declaration in 1999 – and analytical tools it provides to rethink the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> the university in increasingly knowledge-based societies and economies, the wider picture <b>of</b> the <b>social</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> higher <b>education,</b> and policy recommendations it develops may have unanticipated and unconsidered and perhaps mixed effects on higher education systems in certain transition countries. Both globally and in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, private higher <b>education</b> is part <b>of</b> the problem and part of the solution. Consequently, both the private sector in European (and especially Central and East European) higher education systems and the emergence of powerful market forces in the educational and research landscape in Europe have to be further analyzed if the Bologna process is not to turn into a merely “theoretical”, myopic exercise. The downplaying <b>of</b> the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> market forces in higher education and research and development as presented by Bologna documents and the omission of the private sector which is booming in the transition countries from the scope of Bologna interests – and from its overall conceptual scheme – give potentially misguided signals to educational authorities in transition economies. Consequently, Bologna process might distort the development of the private sector in countries where chances for the expansion of the educational system otherwise than through privatization were or are limited. Also, while the implicit disrespect for market mechanisms in higher education may have limited impact in Western European systems which take many market-related parameters of their operation for granted, it may have long-lasting negative impact on legislation and general attitude toward the private sector in some transition economies...|$|R

40|$|Against the {{background}} of converging European HE systems, this thesis takes a comparative perspective {{on the value of}} a degree. It explores how undergraduate students construct and understand the value of their degree and how far these views relate to wider national constructions of value found in policy and in financial returns to education. The study used a mixed research model, triangulating between various sources and methods. Discussion groups were conducted with a total of 27 first-year bachelors degree students, in London at University College London and in Oslo at the University of Oslo; half were studying Biology and half Economics. A comparative review of policy is also set out, drawing on recent, comparative sources, particularly work by Kogan et al. (2006). The measurable value of a degree is investigated through a comparison of OECD rate of return measures (2008, 2009). This study draws on Ritzer’s integrative theory of social analysis, assuming that national constructions of degree value draw on macro level factors (HE policy and economic data) and micro level factors (students’ views), and that these include objective and subjective factors (Ritzer & Goodman, 2004). It employs a narrative approach to analysis and a theoretically generated framework of key narratives about the value <b>of</b> higher <b>education</b> aid national comparisons and support links between aspects of value. Students’ discussions reveal a common set of expectations about a degree: benefits in access to higher status, more interesting work are vital; the overall university experience is widely discussed; and, increased knowledge about their subject or gaining transferable skills are important to many. However, subject groups and national groups suggest differences in how these benefits are understood and prioritised. English students demonstrate a narrower, more instrumental idea of degree value, focused on establishing security and a competitive advantage in finding work. Improved job opportunities are also vital to Norwegian students but {{as part of a broader}} sense of value where self-development and interest in their subject, are emphasised. These differences reflect national policy priorities and approaches. The <b>role</b> <b>of</b> financial measures in shaping students’ views and policy is shown to be important but problematic, as this comparison suggests such measures offer a limited perspective to explaining differences in national systems. The findings also raise important questions about the direction of change in each national system, particularly the potential impact of changes in graduate employment patterns and wage premiums on the <b>social</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> higher <b>education...</b>|$|R
