50|$|Troglodytes are {{described}} as being shorter than a human, with spindly but muscular arms and squat legs. It also has some lizardman-like traits with a reptilian head and forearms, a <b>spinal</b> <b>crest,</b> and a long, slender tail.|$|R
5|$|Their coat differs geographically, with elands {{in north}} Africa having {{distinctive}} markings (torso stripes, markings on legs, dark garters and a <b>spinal</b> <b>crest)</b> that are absent in the south. Apart from a rough mane, the coat is smooth. Females have a tan coat, while the coats of males are darker, with a bluish-grey tinge. Bulls {{may also have}} a series of vertical white stripes on their sides (mainly in parts of the Karoo in South Africa). As males age, their coat becomes more grey. Males also have dense fur on their foreheads and a large dewlap on their throats.|$|R
50|$|The Pantanal cat is brown agouti on {{the back}} with a little darker <b>spinal</b> <b>crest.</b> In the face it has two {{transverse}} dark lines across each cheek. Its ears are reddish on their base, creamy-white on the outer side and bordered with a black band. Its throat is whitish and blending into orangish towards the sides and on the belly. It has some dark brown rosettes on the flanks and stripes on the legs between elbow and wrist. The tip of the tail and paws are black. It {{is about the size}} of a domestic cat.|$|R

50|$|The coat of {{the common}} eland is tan for females, and darker with a bluish tinge for males. The giant eland is reddish-brown to chestnut. The coat {{of the common}} eland varies geographically; the eland in {{southern}} Africa lack the distinctive markings (torso stripes, markings on legs, dark garters and a <b>spinal</b> <b>crest)</b> present in those from the northern half of the continent. Similarly, the giant eland displays 8 to 12 well-defined vertical white torso stripes. In both species the coat of the males darken with age. According to zoologist Jakob Bro-Jørgensen, the colour of the male's coat can reflect the levels of androgen, a male hormone, which is highest during rutting.|$|R
500|$|The coat, sandy, reddish {{brown or}} grey, is uniformly {{coloured}} and lacks spots; melanistic and albino individuals {{have been reported}} from the Indian subcontinent. White cats observed in the coastline tracts of the southern Western Ghats lacked the red eyes typical of true albinos. A 2014 suggested that their colouration {{could be attributed to}} inbreeding. Kittens are striped and spotted, and adults may retain some of the markings. Dark-tipped hairs cover the body, giving the cat a speckled appearance. The belly is generally lighter {{than the rest of the}} body and the throat is pale. The fur is denser on the back compared to the underparts. Two moults can be observed in a year; the coat is rougher and lighter in summer than in winter. The insides of the forelegs show four to five rings; faint markings may be seen on the outside. The black-tipped tail, [...] long, is marked by two to three dark rings on the last third of the length. The pawprints measure about the cat can cover [...] in one step. There is a distinct <b>spinal</b> <b>crest.</b> Because of its long legs, short tail and tuft on the ears, the jungle cat resembles a small lynx. The caracal and the African wildcat have a plain coat as the jungle cat's. The jungle cat is larger and slenderer in comparison to domestic cats.|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [56]- 65) In 1994 a Spanish research team, consisting {{primarily of}} Jose Bermudez de Castro, Juan Luis Arsuaga and Eudald Carbonell, discovered human fossil remains associated with fauna and lithics near Burgos, Spain. The level containing the hominids was originally dated to 500 kya, but was later re-dated to approximately 800, 000 years old. More controversial than the dating was {{the analysis and}} interpretation of the fossil material. In their original description, Bermudez de Castro and colleagues listed twenty-nine features that define these particular hominids (especially the morphology of hominid 3, or ATD 6 - 69). In 1999, Arsuaga and coworkers discussed hominid 3 in more detail, noting the coronal orientation of the infraorbital plate, a sagittal orientation of the lateral nasal wall, an arched or horizontal orientation of the zygomaticoalveolar crest, an inferior-posterior orientation of the infraorbital bone (which causes a depression known as the canine fossa), and the complete fusion of the lateral and <b>spinal</b> <b>crests</b> of the nasal aperture. These authors contend that this morphology is reminiscent of modem humans. Based on the combination of modem and primitive features in these fossils, Bermudez de Castro {{and other members of}} the Spanish team found it necessary to name a new species, Homo antecessor. The present study is designed as a descriptive and comparative analysis of four of the features used to define Homo antecessor. Detailed analyses of the canine fossa, nasal crests, malar tubercle and mylohyoid groove were conducted on Middle Pleistocene hominid fossils. This was accomplished using casts and relevant literature. These four features were also analyzed on a large modem human sample from skeletal material housed at the University of the Pacific Dental School in San Francisco, the Cleveland Museum of Natural History in Cleveland, and the physical anthropology lab at Northern Illinois University in Dekalb, Illinois. These data were then compared with the morphological and interpretive analysis submitted by Arsuaga and co-workers. The results of this analysis are not consistent with the results obtained by Arsuaga and colleagues. The canine fossa exhibited by ATD 6 - 69 is not homologous with that exhibited by modem humans, nor do the nasal crests unite Homo antecessor with modem humans while simultaneously excluding Neandertals. Likewise, the claims of uniqueness for the malar tubercle and mylohyoid groove have not been substantiated in this study either. Thus, based on the analysis of these four features, the naming of a new species is not warranted, making Homo antecessor an invalid species. M. A. (Master of Arts...|$|R
40|$|Pax 7 plays {{critical}} {{roles in}} development of brain, <b>spinal</b> cord, neural <b>crest,</b> and skeletal muscle. As a sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factor, any direct functional {{role played by}} Pax 7 during development is mediated through target gene selection. Thus, we have sought to identify genes targeted by Pax 7 during embryonic development using an unbiased chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) cloning assay to isolate cis-regulatory regions bound by Pax 7 in vivo. Sequencing and genomic localization of a library of chromatin-DNA fragments bound by Pax 7 has identified 34 candidate Pax 7 target genes, with occupancy of a selection confirmed with independent chromatin enrichment tests (ChIP-PCR). To assess the capacity of Pax 7 to regulate transcription from these loci, we have cloned alternate transcripts of Pax 7 (differing significantly in their DNA binding domain) into expression vectors and transfected cultured cells with these constructs, then analyzed target gene expression levels using RT-PCR. We show that Pax 7 directly occupies sites within genes encoding transcription factors Gbx 1 and Eya 4, the neurogenic cytokine receptor ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor, the neuronal potassium channel Kcnk 2, and the signal transduction kinase Camk 1 d in vivo and regulates the transcriptional state of these genes in cultured cells. This analysis gives us greater insight into the direct functional role played by Pax 7 during embryonic development...|$|R
40|$|ZIC genes, {{vertebrate}} homologues of the Drosophila {{pair-rule gene}} odd-paired (opa), function in embryonic pattern formation, {{in the early}} stages of central nervous system neurogenesis and in cerebellar maturation. Mouse Zic genes are expressed in restricted, and in some cases overlapping, patterns during development, particularly in the central and peripheral nervous systems. We identified chick ZIC 2 in a differential display analysis of the auditory system designed to find genes up-regulated after noise trauma. In this study, we examined the expression of chick ZIC 1, ZIC 2, and ZIC 3 by in situ hybridization in normal inner ear development and in the tissues that influence its development, including the hindbrain, the neural crest, and the periotic mesenchyme. Between Hamburger and Hamilton stages 13 and 24, all three ZIC genes were found in the dorsal periotic mesenchyme adjacent to the developing inner ear. ZIC 1 mRNA was expressed in the otocyst epithelium between stages 12 and 24, in some sensory tissue, as well as in a striped pattern in the floorplate of the hindbrain that appears to be complementary to that of Chordin, a gene known to regulate ZIC expression in frogs. Chick ZIC genes are also expressed in the neuroectoderm, paraxial mesenchyme, brain, <b>spinal</b> cord, neural <b>crest,</b> and/or the overlying ectoderm as well as the limb buds. In general, ZIC 1 and ZIC 2 expression patterns overlapped, although ZIC 2 expression was less robust; ZIC 3 expression was minimal. These observations suggest that ZIC genes, in addition to their known roles in brain development, may play an important role in the development of the chick inner ear.

40|$|The {{neural crest}} is a {{transient}} population of cells {{defined in terms}} of their ectodermal origin, their migratory behavior, and their derivatives. Neural crest cells classically have been thought to be a segregated population within the neural plate, bordered laterally by presumptive epidermis and medially by prospective central nervous system (CNS). Cell lineage analyses in vitro and in vivo have demonstrated that individual neural crest cells are multipotent. In fact, they have the properties of stem cells with at least a limited ability to self-renew. The experiments summarized in this chapter demonstrate that interactions between the presumptive neural plate and the nonneural ectoderm lead to induction of the avian neural crest at the interface between these tissues. This supports the idea that an inductive signal travels through the epidermis to generate neural crest cells in the gastrulating embryo. On the other hand, the competence of the neural plate to form different types of neural crest derivatives appears to change with time. BMP 4 and BMP 7 (bone morphogenetic proteins) {{have been shown to be}} sufficient to substitute for the nonneural ectoderm in inducing neural crest cells. The neural tube has a characteristic polarity along the rostrocaudal and the dorsoventral axes. Rostrocaudal regionalization is manifested by the formation of subdivisions in the neural tube, such as the forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain, and <b>spinal</b> cord. Neural <b>crest</b> cells arising from different axial levels contribute to derivatives characteristic of the axial level of origin. It has been demonstrated that dorsalizing signals influence development of not only the neural crest, but also the dorsal neural tube. Various genes are selectively expressed in the dorsal, but not in the ventral, portion of the neural tube...|$|R
40|$|The biomechanical {{stability}} {{of a new}} biodegradable implant (PCC), consisting of a resorbable polymer with calciumphosphat-filling (Polymer-Calciumphosphat-Composit), was evaluated in an experimental study using a sheep cervical spine interbody fusion model and compared to results of an autologous tricortical iliac crest. 40 mature female merino sheep were randomized divided into 6 groups. Each four animals of group 1 and 2 underwent discectomy of the motion unit C 3 /C 4 in modified Robinson-Technique followed by a spondylodesis using an autologous tricortical iliac crest and thereafter were killed 12 respectively 36 weeks. Each eight animals of group 3, 4, 5 and 6 underwent the surgical procedure using a biodegradable implant of a polymer-calciumphosphat-composit filled with autologous spongiosa. These animals were killed 12, 36, 52 respectively 104 weeks post operationem. Immediately afterwards a non-destructive, three-dimensional, biomechanical testing of the surgically treated vertebral motion unit C 3 /C 4 followed for each single motion direction rotation left/right, lateral bending left/right, extension and flexion. One animal of the PCC- 2 -year-group had to be euthanized ahead of schedule due to severe compression of the spinal cord {{at the level of}} C 3 /C 4 accompanied by high-grade ataxia and inability to stand up without assistance. Three more animals of the same long-term-group showed postmortal macroscopic similar alterations of the cage-implant-site, which lead to stenosis of the <b>spinal</b> canal. Tricortical <b>crest</b> showed significantly higher stiffness in all tested directions of motion after 36 weeks compared to 12 weeks. Stiffness of the PCC-implant increased significantly in rotation right over 12 to 104 weeks, and showed tendency of higher stiffness in rotation left and lateral bending left/right. In direct comparison of both implants three months post-op no significant differences of stiffness were noticed. Nine months post-op the tricortical crest featured significantly higher stiffness values for rotation right, extension and flexion, and a tendency of higher stiffness in rotation left compared to the PCC-cage. Therefore the PCC-cage, as tested in this study, is not a suitable implant for application in spondylodesis of the cervical spine...|$|R

Stafylas, K. info:eu-repo/semantics/article article 2008 Archives of Orthopaedic and Trauma Surgery 1286621 - 5 <![CDATA[INTRODUCTION: Intertransverse posterolateral fusion along with instrumentation {{is a common}} technique used for <b>spinal</b> fusion. Iliac <b>crest</b> bone graft (ICBG) offers good fusion success rates with a low risk for disease transmission but is, however, linked with certain morbidity. In an effort to eliminate or {{reduce the amount of}} iliac graft needed, bone substitutes including demineralized bone matrix (DBM) have been developed. This study evaluates a novel DBM (Accell Connexus((R))) used in one or two-level instrumented posterolateral lumbar fusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 59 consecutive patients were studied as two groups. Group 1 consisted of 33 patients having Accell Connexus((R)) used to augment either ICBG or local decompression material. Group 2 consisted of 26 consecutive patients, operated prior to the introduction of this novel DBM, having either ICBG alone or local decompression material. Fusion was assessed by two independent observers, blinded to graft material, using standardized criteria found in the literature. All adverse events were recorded prospectively. RESULTS: The results show no statistically {{significant differences between the two}} groups in fusion rates, complications, surgery duration, ODI, or pain on VAS. Logistical regression showed no relation between fusion and age, smoking status or comorbidities. Furthermore, no adverse events related to the use of the novel DBM were observed. CONCLUSION: The results from this study demonstrate that the novel DBM presented performs equally as well as that of autologous bone, be it either ICBG or a local decompression material, and can therefore be used as a graft extender...|$|R
