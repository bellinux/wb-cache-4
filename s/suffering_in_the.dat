5|$|In this respect, Traherne's work {{is often}} {{compared}} to the abounding joy and mysticism found {{in the works of}} William Blake, Walt Whitman, and Gerard Manley Hopkins. According to Traherne scholar Denise Inge, Traherne's introduction of a child's viewpoint to narrate his theological and moral premises was unknown or certainly unappreciated in the literature of this time. His poems frequently explore the glory of creation and what he perceived as his intimate relationship with God. He drew deeply on the writings of Aristotle and on the early Church Fathers for his concept of Man and human nature. Little mention is made of sin and <b>suffering</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> works that have dominated 20th-century criticism, and some critics have seen his verse as bordering upon pantheism (or perhaps panentheism).|$|E
5|$|Lisa {{wakes up}} one morning saddened. At school, she gets in trouble with her music teacher for improvising, and becomes {{reluctant}} to play dodgeball in gym. At home, Homer and Bart pummel each other at video boxing, but despite Homer's attempts, {{he is unable to}} defeat Bart. Homer and Marge try to cheer Lisa up, but she is consumed with worry over all the <b>suffering</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world. In her room, Lisa hears music coming from outside her window. She follows the music through town and meets Bleeding Gums Murphy, a soulful saxophonist playing the blues. Lisa learns about expressing herself through her music from him, only to be discovered and whisked away by Marge.|$|E
5|$|Myrrha {{appears in}} the Divine Comedy poem Inferno by Dante Alighieri, where Dante sees her soul being punished in the eighth circle of Hell, in the tenth bolgia (ditch). Here she and other falsifiers such as the alchemists and the counterfeiters suffer dreadful diseases, Myrrha's being madness. Myrrha's <b>suffering</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tenth bolgia {{indicates}} her most serious sin was not incest but deceit. Diana Glenn interprets the symbolism in Myrrha's contrapasso as being that her sin is so unnatural and unlawful that she is forced to abandon human society and simultaneously she loses her identity. Her madness in Hell prevents even basic communication which attests to her being contemptuous {{of the social order}} in life.|$|E

5|$|Prior to kickoff of the 2005game, {{the stadium}} {{announcer}} made an appeal for donations {{to help those}} <b>suffering</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, which devastated parts of Louisiana fivedays previously. Donations were not accepted at the game because of a policy against official fund-raising. As the Longhorns entered the field, special teams player Karim Meijer carried a United States flag {{that was given to}} the team on Thursday by former Longhorn Nathan Kaspar who flew the flag during missions in southeastern Iraq. For this game only, the Longhorns wore throwback uniforms furnished by Nike as a way of honoring the past. The throwback jerseys were similar to jerseys worn during their 1963National Championship season under Coach Darrell K. Royal. Football's origins in the Northeastern United States have created an expectation that it is a cold-weather sport, but the temperature at kickoff was 90°F (32°C) which is also the average temperature in Austin for the month of September.|$|E

25|$|Swami Sivananda {{also notes}} that God is free from charges of {{partiality}} and cruelty which are brought against him because of social inequality, fate, and universal <b>suffering</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world.

25|$|A notable {{feature in}} {{religious}} ritual is {{the division between}} purity and pollution. Religious acts presuppose some degree of impurity, or defilement for the practitioner, which must be overcome or neutralized, before or during ritual procedures. Purification, usually with water, is thus a typical feature of most religious action. Other characteristics include a belief <b>in</b> <b>the</b> efficacy of sacrifice and concept of merit, gained through the performance of charity or good works, that will accumulate over time and reduce <b>sufferings</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> next world.|$|R

25|$|The {{application}} of human security is highly relevant within {{the area of}} humanitarian intervention, as it focuses on addressing the deep rooted and multi-factorial problems inherent in humanitarian crises, and offers more long term resolutions. In general, the term humanitarian intervention generally applies to when a state uses force against another state in order to alleviate <b>suffering</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> latter state (See, humanitarian intervention).|$|E

The merged company took the WarCry name as WarCry Corp., but dropped the online gaming angle to concentrate on more coverage of games, particularly massively multiplayer which had been XRGaming's stock in trade. Whilst popular, XRGaming had been <b>suffering</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> midst of the dot-com bust and WarCry's funding enabled both to survive.|$|E

Arriving on the morning of 7 January 1922, Asheville carried out relief work at La Palma until departing the following day to return to Balboa.|$|E
25|$|These points {{represent}} {{the bright side}} of Tatar rule, but it also had its dark side. So long as a great horde of nomads was encamped on the frontier, the country was liable to be invaded by an overwhelming force. Fortunately, these invasions were not frequent, but when they occurred they caused an incalculable amount of devastation and <b>suffering.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> intervals the people had to pay a fixed tribute. At first it was collected in a rough-and-ready fashion by Tatar tax-gatherers; by about 1259 it was regulated by a census of the population; and finally its collection was entrusted to the native princes, so the people were no longer brought into {{direct contact with the}} Tatar officials.|$|E

25|$|Mostly {{dealing with}} the {{historical}} motifs, Marković engaged in the ongoing battle for the affirmation of Croatdom against Hungarian and German domination. Idyllic epic Dom i svijet ('The home and the world') elaborates on contemporary themes. Epic Kohan i Vlasta ('Kohan and Vlasta') portrays a battle of old Slavs and Germans on the Baltic. The tragedy Karlo Drački depicts man's <b>suffering</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> struggle for panhuman ideal of freedom against the Rome and Magyar feudal lords. The tragedies Benk bot and Zvonimir display vices and rapacity of Hungarian landlords and court. Marković also wrote poems, literary critics and studies.

25|$|Aid may be also {{classified}} {{based on}} urgency into emergency aid and development aid. Emergency aid is rapid assistance {{given to a}} people in immediate distress by individuals, organizations, or governments to relieve suffering, during and after man-made emergencies (like wars) and natural disasters. The term often carries an international connotation, {{but this is not}} always the case. It is often distinguished from development aid by being focused on relieving suffering caused by natural disaster or conflict, rather than removing the root causes of poverty or vulnerability. Development aid is aid given to support development in general which can be economic development or social development in developing countries. It is distinguished from humanitarian aid as being aimed at alleviating poverty in the long term, rather than alleviating <b>suffering</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> short term.|$|E
25|$|Rockford and {{surrounding}} areas {{are prone to}} violent thunderstorms during the months of March, April, May, and June.

Other severe weather events, such as hail and strong winds are common in these storms. On July 5, 2003 at 04:13, supercells produced tornadoes causing widespread damage on both the east and west sides of Rockford. Approximately 70,000 people were without power, with many on the west side <b>suffering</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> heat without electricity for a week. It took months for the damage to be completely cleared, but because the storm struck so early in the morning there were no injuries or fatalities.
