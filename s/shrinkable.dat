50|$|Many small kits {{will come}} with a tissue paper {{covering}} that then gets covered with multiple layers of plane dope which coats and strengthens the fuselage and wings in a plastic-like covering. It has become more common to cover planes with heat-shrinking plastic films backed with heat-sensitive adhesive. These films are generally known as 'iron-on covering' since a hand-held iron allows the film to {{be attached to the}} frame; a higher temperature then causes the film to tighten. This plastic covering is more durable and makes for a quick repair.

Topflight continued to design its own presses throughout the 1950s and 1960s. It added high-performance products including <b>shrinkable</b> film, tamper-evident labels and conductive printing.

50|$|Current fusion splicers {{are either}} core or {{cladding}} alignment. Using {{one of these}} methods the two cleaved fibers are automatically aligned by the fusion splicer in the x,y,z plane, then are fused together. Prior to {{the removal of the}} spliced fiber from the fusion splicer, a proof-test is performed to ensure that the splice is strong enough to survive handling, packaging and extended use. The bare fiber area is protected either by recoating or with a splice protector. A splice protector is a heat <b>shrinkable</b> tube with a strength membrane and less loss.|$|E
50|$|Heat-shrink tubing (or, commonly, {{heat shrink}} or heatshrink) is a <b>shrinkable</b> plastic tube used to {{insulate}} wires, providing abrasion resistance {{and environmental protection}} for stranded and solid wire conductors, connections, joints and terminals in electrical work. It {{can also be used}} to repair the insulation on wires or to bundle them together, to protect wires or small parts from minor abrasion, and to create cable entry seals, offering environmental sealing protection. Heat-shrink tubing is ordinarily made of nylon or polyolefin, which shrinks radially (but not longitudinally) when heated, to between one-half and one-sixth of its diameter.|$|E

[...] Protective electric current from the {{cathodic protection}} system is blocked or shielded from reaching the underlying metal by the highly resistive film backing. Cathodic shielding was first defined in the 1980s as being a problem, and technical papers on the subject have been regularly published since then.|$|E
50|$|Plastic casings are {{generally}} made from polymers such as polyamide, polypropylene, or polyethylene. Polyamide (Nylon) plastic casings {{are the most}} commonly used in production of cooked sausages and hams such as luncheon meat and bologna. Polyamide casings come in two main varieties: Oriented and non-oriented. The oriented polyamide are <b>shrinkable</b> casings and will shrink during the cooking process thereby reducing the water loss. Non-oriented polyamide casings remain the same diameter during the cooking process and thereby allow for expansion of the meat during cooking. The use of polyamide casings has expanded recently with the advent of various varieties and structures of casings such as multilayer casings.|$|E

LS Cable produces not only cables but also various products like heat pipe, refrigerator, injection machine, etc. Since 2001, LS Cable has tried to enhance R&D processes and manufacturing processes by applying TRIZ. Therefore, LS Cable opened TRIZ education course and have taught full process of TRIZ to research engineers. And TRIZ has been adapted to practical engineering projects.

For instance, the quality of Polymer Insulator and Heat <b>Shrinkable</b> Tube were improved dramatically. The tolerance of Heat <b>Shrinkable</b> Tube was relatively more than 10 mm and the production speed was limited by the tolerance.

40|$|An affine {{manifold}} is a manifold with an affine structure, i. e. a torsion-free flat affine connection. We {{show that}} the universal cover of a closed affine 3 -manifold M with holonomy group of infinitely <b>shrinkable</b> dimension (or discompacité in French) {{less than or equal}} to two is diffeomorphic to R³.

Three longissimus dorsi muscles from two Belgian Blue cows were dry- or wet-aged for up to 63 days at 2 °C. At different times, part of these samples was cut into steaks and repackaged in vacuum bags or <b>shrinkable</b> film, and stored during 4 days at 4 °C + 8 days at 8 °C (simulated retail display). The following parameters were evaluated at different intervals: pH, tenderness (Warner–Bratzler shear force), color (CIE L*a*b*), myoglobin oxidation (K/S 572 / 525 ratio) and lipid oxidation (TBARS). The aging technique and the packaging during simulated retail display had an effect on pH (dry-aging > wet-aging, P vacuum, P vacuum, P 0 and 21 days, P vacuum, P < 0. 05).

30|$|Indeed, the {{sclerophyllous}} {{character of}} the leaves of oak species made them least <b>shrinkable</b> {{as shown in the}} shrinkage classification table (Table  4). This feature enables the oak leaves to remain turgid as possible and therefore reduces the shrinkage potential. The leaves of Cistus species are less sclerophyllous than those of oaks, though they have a relatively thick cuticle that can mitigate the hydric stress effects (Aranda et al. 2014; Pardos et al. 2009; Bacelar et al. 2004; Bussotti et al. 2002). Therefore, Cistus leaves are classified as moderately <b>shrinkable.</b> The high shrinkage potential of P. pinaster and P. pinea {{can be explained by the}} prominence of two main parameters. Pine needles have, first, thin cuticle, allowing increased cuticular transpiration (Aranda et al. 2014; Pardos et al. 2009) and, secondly, pine needles are less sclerophyllous, depriving thereby the leaf of a mechanism limiting uncontrolled transpiration (Grill et al. 2004). This results in high desiccation susceptibility of the needles (Grill et al. 2004), which increases therefore the shrinkage potential (Bacelar et al. 2004). Otherwise, P. canariensis needles are less <b>shrinkable</b> than the other pine needles (Table  2). Pinus canariensis needles distance themselves from other pine needles through their particular epistomatal chamber, with a narrow aperture, where wax tubes are very dense and their small stomata compared to other pine species (Grill et al. 2004). These characteristics are responsible for the stomata occlusion (Jimenez et al. 2000; Zellnig et al. 2002). Thus, this arrangement of stomata cells inhibits transpiration (Zellnig et al. 2002) in order to limit water loss and then mitigate leaf shrinkage (Bacelar et al. 2004; Bussotti et al. 2002). In addition, cuticular transpiration in P. canariensis needles is the lowest among Pinus species (Pardos et al. 2009), showing even more fitness to keep water inside the needles, decreasing thereby the shrinkage potential (Bussotti et al. 2002). Furthermore, leaf shrinkage in P. canariensis varies significantly from a site to another. This result is in accordance with the following reports Climent et al. (2002), Grill et al. (2004), López et al. (2007) and Pardos et al. (2009) that highlighted a variation in the physiological response to hydric stress of P. canariensis needles from one site to the other. According to Grill et al. (2004), this is due to the variable anatomy of P. canariensis needles, which changes depending on environmental conditions.|$|E
