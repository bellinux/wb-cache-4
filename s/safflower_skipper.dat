5000|$|The <b>safflower</b> <b>skipper</b> (Pyrgus carthami) {{butterfly}} is {{a species}} of skipper butterfly (family Hesperiidae).|$|E
5000|$|This is {{a rather}} {{variable}} species with a wingspan of 22-32 mm (not always particularly [...] "large") with several subspecies having been described. As with most Pyrgus species it has dark brown wings with pale chequered margins and is rather difficult to identify specifically in the field but good views reveal clear, well-spaced white spotting on the forewing and much fainter markings on the hindwings. The most likely confusion species is the <b>safflower</b> <b>skipper</b> (P. carthami). P. alveus is on the wing from June to August {{with one or two}} generations produced each year.|$|E
