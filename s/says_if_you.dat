500|$|Timothy Zachery Mosley {{was born}} on March 10, 1972 in Norfolk, Virginia, to Latrice, who ran a {{homeless}} shelter, and Garland Mosley, an Amtrak employee. He graduated from Salem High School of Virginia Beach, Virginia. During his time as a DJ, {{he was known as}} [...] "DJ Tim" [...] or [...] "DJ Timmy Tim". His brother, Sebastian, is reportedly around nine years younger. His sister Courtney Rashon is a makeup artist and author from New Jersey. While attending high school, Timbaland began a long-term collaboration with rapper Melvin (Magoo) Barcliff. The teenage Mosley also joined the production ensemble S.B.I. (which stood for 'Surrounded By Idiots') which also featured Neptunes producer Pharrell. Mosley was also high school friends with brothers Terrence and Gene Thornton, who would become known as Pusha T and Malice of the rap group Clipse, respectively. In 1986, when Timbaland was 14 years old, he was accidentally shot by a co-worker at a local Red Lobster restaurant and was partially paralyzed for nine months. During this time, he began to learn how to DJ using his left hand.Tim rarely talks about the shooting, and is, in fact, quite critical of gangsta rappers who boast of their war wounds. I'm not a rapper," [...] he says dismissively. I'm not talking about my scars or my battles. Still, the shooting did help him form a bond with 50 Cent. I'll tell you this, Tim <b>says.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> get shot and you survive, you feel like you're an Incredible Hulk. Them bullets don't hurt when they go in. But then they got that burnin', that acid burn. Goddamn! It feels like a stove burning your blood. You feel like any minute you gonna be dyin'.}} ...|$|E

His record is unbelievable and he {{is probably the best}} horse I have ridden". Gosden, who was winning the race for the first time said [...] "It's great to win the Arc in France and the Derby in England - that's what it's about. When you're drawn wide, if you stay wide for a long time, you can run your own little race and not be bothered by anyone and then slot across. It was perfect as we sat behind the pacemaker and then kicked because as Frankie <b>says,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't kick at a certain time here they come like arrows at your back". He also suggested that the horse might make a final appearance in the Breeders' Cup Turf, saying [...] "The owner is keen on the Breeders' Cup. It's a month away. If he's in good order, there's no reason we couldn't go there".|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, he can," [...] replied Dorothy; [...] "he {{talks with}} his tail, and I know {{everything}} he <b>says.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> could wag your tail, Billina, you wouldn't need words to talk with." ...|$|E
50|$|Watson is {{credited}} with originating the <b>saying</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> can't lick 'em, jine 'em.|$|R
6000|$|She {{had listened}} eagerly, as I say; {{and it was}} her nature to {{understand}} quickly. [...] "I wonder <b>if</b> <b>you</b> appreciate what <b>you</b> <b>say.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> do, you take a great responsibility." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, phantasms, or <b>if</b> <b>you</b> {{prefer the}} word, phanograms, or <b>say</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will phanogrammatical manifestations, or more simply psychophantasmal phenomena?" ...|$|R
60|$|We say, If {{you love}} God, you will obey him; {{which is quite}} true. But what Moses says is truer still, and deeper still. Moses <b>says,</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> obey God, you will love him.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh! and, dear mamma, Mrs. Osborn is so {{hurt that}} you called on Mrs. Dusautoy before {{returning}} her visit; and Aunt Maria <b>says</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't call to-day {{you will never}} get over it, and she says that--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Friend," [...] said Dalgetty, [...] "I {{am sorry}} for you; but PATIENZA, as the Spaniard <b>says.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> had but been {{as quiet as}} a log, as you call yourself, I should have saved some excoriations {{on my hands and}} knees." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Madam,' cried Mr Dombey, {{striking}} {{his hand}} upon the table, 'hear me <b>if</b> <b>you</b> please. I <b>say,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> have {{no respect for}} yourself--' ...|$|R
60|$|Arga. I <b>say,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> {{have any}} issue here, It {{must be that}} fair creature; By all my hopes I think so.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Good!' {{returned}} Squeers. 'I <b>say!</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> shouldn't {{find her}} out, you'll pay expenses at the Saracen, and something for loss of time?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll say she has! Pop {{hates it}} as much as me, but he's scared to kick. Mother says {{vegetables}} contain all the proteins you want. Mother <b>says,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> eat meat, your blood-pressure goes all blooey. Do you think it does?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now look here, Carrots; I'm {{a friend}} of yours, an' don't want ter see any trouble come out er this thing. Skip's jest wild 'bout what you've told the other fellers, an' I reckon he'll do as he <b>says</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> try to help that feller what got 'rested." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am a-going with he," [...] she said, in {{the midst}} of a torrent of sobs and tears. [...] "It's a dooty. They <b>says</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> does your dooty all will come right in the end. It may be, but I don't see it no further than taking him back to Portsmouth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No 'humph' about it. I {{mean just}} what I <b>say.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> don't behave {{yourself}} and don't treat {{her like a}} lady I'll--I'll----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hush! I don't {{allow that}} word; but <b>you</b> may <b>say,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> choose, that I am {{sometimes}} {{carried away by}} a too generous impulse." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>say,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> {{have come}} over as an {{ambassador}} {{with the idea}} of reopening negotiations with Jill on behalf of that infernal swine...." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, {{here you}} are! We {{could not think}} {{what had become of}} you. There has Deloraine been at the door these ten minutes, and Charlie sent me to find you, for he <b>says</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> are too late for Mrs. Henley's dinner, she will write such an account of you to Philip as you will never get over.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you imagine}} I am afraid of you? What on earth. [...] . Well, it's possible, after all, that I don't know exactly why I am coming here. Let us say, with Miss Jacobus, {{that it is}} for no good. You seem to believe the {{outrageous}} things she <b>says,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> do have a row with her now and then." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Maybe I {{got out of}} {{the wrong}} side of the bed," [...] {{suggested}} Davy. [...] "Milty Boulter <b>says</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> do that things are bound to go wrong with you all day. His grandmother told him. But which is the right side? And what are you to do when your bed's against the wall? I want to know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is to <b>say,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> {{were in his}} place, you {{wouldnt be}} in his place--among the gum trees. Perhaps you would be right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't care a pin {{what they}} <b>say</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't mind, uncle," [...] she answered, when he pictured {{the dismay of}} the good ladies.|$|R
6000|$|... "They <b>say</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can swing you won't be sea-sick," [...] he said, as he mounted again. [...] "I don't believe I {{should ever}} be sea-sick." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All is {{fastened}} with bolt and staple, and guarded with gun and pistol, at the Castle," [...] quoth Cisly; [...] "and {{so sharp}} are they, that they nigh caught me coming with my lady's message, as I told you. But my lady <b>says,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> could deliver her son, Master Julian, from Bridgenorth, {{that she would}} hold it good service." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One {{thing that}} Polly does Sunday nights, {{is to take}} Will's head in her lap, and smooth his forehead. It rests him after {{studying}} so hard, she <b>says.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> don't like the pillow, I could do that for you, 'cause you look {{as if you were}} more tired of studying than Will," [...] said Maud, with some hesitation, but an evident desire to be useful and agreeable.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, there, there! That's you; that's my {{own flesh}} and blood. I'll warrant that you'll pick holes in {{everything}} your mother <b>says,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can, Stephen. You {{are just like}} your father for that; take anybody's part but mine. Whilst I am speaking and talking and trying and slaving away for your good, you are waiting to catch me out in that way. So you are in her class, but 'tis what HER people would CALL marrying out of her class. Don't be so quarrelsome, Stephen!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So, I <b>say,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> claim these rustlers will last, you're pretending lack {{of nerve}} just {{to help the}} popular idea along. For they can't last.|$|R
6000|$|Nora {{smiled and}} shook her head. [...] "I wonder what he would <b>say</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> asked him. But if he came I should do the same thing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He fancies you {{are taking}} some young lady a sail. What would he <b>say</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> were to stop and {{introduce}} me to him as Dr. Breen?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Jeff said, as {{if their}} {{controversy}} were at an end and they might now turn to more personal things: [...] "You look pretty slim, Mr. Westover. A'n't there something I can do for you-get you? I've {{come in with a}} message from mother. She <b>says</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> ever want to get that winter view of Lion's Head, now's your time. She wants you to come up there; she and Cynthia both do. They can make you as comfortable as you please, and they'd like to have a visit from you. Can't you go?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{you take}} me for missis, mum. I beg your pardon, mum," [...] cries Hannah. The invalid hits his sister in the side with a weak little fist. If {{laughter}} can cure, salva est res. Doctor Goodenough's patient is safe. [...] "Master Charles is missis's brother, mum. I've got no brother, mum--never had no brother. Only one son, who's in the police, mum, thank you. And law bless me, I was going to forget! If you please, mum, missis <b>says,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> are quite rested, she will pay her duty to you, mum." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{is what it}} is, father. Master Lirriper {{is going}} down the river to Bricklesey tomorrow, and then he is going on board his nephew's ship. She is a ketch, and she carries ten tons, though I don't {{know what it is}} she carries; and she's going to London, and he is going in her, and he <b>says</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will let him he will take us with him, and will show us London, and take great care of us. It will be glorious, father, if you will only let us go." ...|$|E
60|$|That {{is a grand}} <b>saying,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will {{remember}} that the key-word, which explains it all, is Peace, and the Gospel, that is, the good news, thereof.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{what else}} did he <b>say,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> please?" [...] {{explaining}} impatiently when my answer was not of the kind expected: [...] "No, no, I mean about me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you hear}} what I <b>say?</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> want to breathe freer, break the pipe of the wires, and you'll get fresh air from outside right through it." ...|$|R
