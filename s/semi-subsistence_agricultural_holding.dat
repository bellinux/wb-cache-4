40|$|Background This paper {{discusses}} how hashish {{produced by}} the local population of Tyup, Kyrgyzstan became {{an important source of}} cash in an <b>agricultural</b> <b>semi-subsistence</b> economy. Methods The paper is based on a research study conducted between 2009 and 2010 that adopted a mixed-method approach to data collection. I gathered 64 semi-structured interviews, 147 structured interviews and made ethnographic observations of the livelihoods of the people of Toolu village in Tyup region. Results The local population of the region became involved in hashish production due to a cash deficit in both the agricultural economy and wider society {{from the beginning of the}} 1990 s. Privatization of land as a consequence of the neoliberalization of the economy left many families with small share lands which are insufficient to provide market surplus. Agricultural products, therefore, are mainly consumed by the majority of farmers, turning the economy of the region into a <b>semi-subsistence</b> <b>agricultural</b> economy. In the context of such a cash deficit economy, wild-growing cannabis plants are used not only as a cash crop but are symbolically turned into a form of cash and a source of informal credit. People can pay for goods with hashish as well as obtain advance payments and credits for it. I argue that hashish making assists the agricultural rural economy by allowing people to obtain goods, advance payments and credits to use for the cultivation of land, their everyday needs and maintaining social relationships. I also argue that many local farmers, who do not consider themselves as criminals, were able to become involved in this activity by shifting the meaning of hashish and hashish making from an illegal activity to a culturally valued and justifiable form of economic activity. Conclusion This allows me to show that the local drug economy in Tyup serves as a lens through which to examine the strategies through which illegal and illicit drug production becomes culturally acceptable. Understanding of hashish production in this local context of the <b>semi-subsistence</b> <b>agricultural</b> economy operating in a constant deficit of cash provides rich data for effective evidence-based policy...|$|R

40|$|Analysis of the {{economic}} and environmental outcomes of agricultural systems requires a bottom-up linkage from the farm to market, as well as a top-down linkage from market to farm. This study develops this two-way linkage between the Tradeoff Analysis Model of agricultural systems and a partial equilibrium market model. The resulting model can determine the effects of technology and policy interventions on the spatial distribution of environmental and economic outcomes at market equilibrium quantities and prices. The approach is demonstrated with a case study of tradeoffs between poverty and nutrient depletion in a <b>semi-subsistence</b> <b>agricultural</b> system (Machakos, Kenya). The results suggest that the linkage of market equilibrium analysis to farm level Integrated Assessment Models can be important in the analysis of agriculture–environment interactions...|$|R

In many of these same areas, tropical root crops represent a major item in the national food economies. Given this scenario, this paper examines the potential role of tropical root crops in meeting domestic food needs. First, the present contribution of root crops to food production is briefly summarised and used to provide simple guidelines for allocating research resources. These guidelines are somewhat deficient in that they overlook a number of energetic considerations of importance at both the individual producer and national level. To illustrate, a two-goods model of a <b>semi-subsistence</b> <b>agricultural</b> production unit is constructed and some conclusions drawn which lend weight to the opinion that tropical root crop research should receive high priority...|$|R

40|$|In France, {{the concept}} of the <b>agricultural</b> <b>holding</b> is a result of a lengthy social {{construction}} in which the stages in classification and statistical work have proceeded in tune with the major political struggles and social debates of the 19 th and 20 th centuries. Some people argue that the “ <b>agricultural</b> <b>holding</b> ” is now just a term revived from the past for the modern “ agricultural enterprise ”. Sociologists and economists therefore need to reconsider the significance and relevance of this concept. 	 The diversity of the ways of practising agricultural activities encountered in French households shows that the economic and social realities referred to in this concept are far too varied for its use in defining a productive sector having an institutional existence. Neither can it be used to demark the social groups that will be entitled to benefit from the support measures of agricul-tural and rural development policies. 	 As a basic statistical unit, however {{the concept of}} the <b>agricultural</b> <b>holding</b> can provide a com-mon basic unit for measuring agricultural activity, and the land used for this activity, thereby permitting the integration of results concerning the different functions of agricultural activity (production, natural resource management, land use, socio-economic cohesion, etc.). From this angle, the statistical notion of the <b>agricultural</b> <b>holding</b> as presently defined is of increasing interest for the management of new agricultural and rural policies and for social sciences research. ...|$|R

40|$|Land {{fragmentation}} {{and the need}} for consolidation are major problems of current Romanian agriculture. The transition from the status-quo of an agricultural structure dominated by subsistence and semi-subsistence farms in the view of restructuring, resulting in a more efficient sector - is a must. Present study proposes to evaluate the application of specific measures of the Romanian National Rural Development Programme (NRDP) that sought to support semi-subsistence farms between 2007 and 2013. Three NRDP measures have been identified under which semi-subsistence farms were eligible: Measure 112 "Setting up of young farmers", Measure 121 "Modernization of agricultural holdings", and Measure 141 "Supporting <b>semi-subsistence</b> <b>agricultural</b> holdings". The above measures belong to the 1 st Axis of the Common Agricultural Policy's second pillar, thus having a common general goal the improvement of the competitiveness of the agricultural sector, while aiming at restructuring and developing the physical potential and management of generation change - trying to keep the rural population in place. Available data on a seven-year time horizon was analyzed. The absorption level of measures 112, 121 and 141 - under which the Romanian semi-subsistence farms were eligible - on national and subnational scale was mapped...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, one cannot {{talk about}} an {{authentic}} rural tourism within a certain destination without emphasizing the local cultural heritage (cultural landscape, customs and traditions, gastronomy and so on). In the existing context, the local gastronomy {{is perceived as a}} marketing instrument efficient in differentiating the rural touristic destinations. A special place {{in the development of the}} traditional cuisine is represented by the setting up and the promotion of the short food supply chains which can be achieved by sustaining the small local producers and by putting into practice an environment-friendly traditional agriculture. Sustaining the partnerships between the owners of accommodation units and the small local agricultural producers represents an essential element in putting into practice a sustainable and qualitative rural tourism. Romania has a substantial potential as regards the enhancement of short food supply chains thanks to: the large number of <b>semi-subsistence</b> <b>agricultural</b> farms (with an area under 5 hectares), the „village-town connection ” as regards the food procurement, especially from acquaintances and relatives and the carrying on of a traditional agriculture at a large scale in the rural households.

40|$|In {{this study}} we use a spatially-explicit {{integrated}} assessment model (TOA-ME) to evaluate the economic (income, poverty) and environmental (soil nutrient depletion) impacts of climate change and socio-economic scenarios in {{a case study of}} the <b>semi-subsistence</b> <b>agricultural</b> production systems of Machakos (Kenya). This model provides a unique capability to assess distributional effects of climate change on economic and environmental outcomes while also accounting for market-level impacts on prices. We use this framework to examine how a socio-economic scenario based on policy and technology interventions can offset the likely negative effects of climate change. In order to conduct this analysis we propose a three-step methodology: i) analysis of climate change scenarios generated by GCMs, ii) use of GCMs output to estimate crop responses, and iii) modeling the land use decisions and economics of the farming systems. Output data from 5 commonly used GCMs and 3 emission scenarios were used. Outputs from GCMs and emission scenarios corresponding to the Machakos region are highly variable but present a similar trend of higher temperatures and decreasing precipitation. As a result, crop production decreases with the effects varying by location. Farmers are likely to adapt to the new climate conditions through changes in land use; however the effects on poverty and soil nutrient depletion rates are small. In contrast, the analysis shows that an effective policy and technology intervention that leads to different socio-economic conditions could offset the negative effects of climate change and reduce this region’s vulnerability. The results also imply that ignoring new market conditions could lead to incorrect information for policy making...|$|R
