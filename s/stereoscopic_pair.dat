40|$|Traditional image editing {{techniques}} cannot be directly used to edit stereoscopic (" 3 D&#x 201 D;) media, as extra constraints {{are needed to}} ensure consistent changes are made to both left and right images. Here, we consider manipulating perspective in <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>pairs.</b> A straightforward approach based on depth recovery is unsatisfactory: Instead, we use feature correspondences between <b>stereoscopic</b> image <b>pairs.</b> Given a new, user-specified perspective, we determine correspondence constraints under this perspective and optimize a 2 D warp for each image that preserves straight lines and guarantees proper stereopsis relative to the new camera.

40|$|Up {{till now}} it is still {{difficult}} to acquire stereoscopic space-borne image pairs of some area due to climate condition or atmosphere pollution. This paper describes the geometric aspects and the mathematical treatment for the stereoscopic image pair composed of optical and SAR space-borne images in positioning. First, the geometric equation for linear array push-broom imagery and F. Leberl model for SAR imagery as well as methods to simultaneously determine or refine individual parameters of these models are briefly reviewed. And a straight-forward single-step procedure has been developed which follows the philosophy of photogrammetric bundle adjustment techniques.

40|$|Abstract. We propose Markov chain Monte Carlo {{sampling}} methods to address uncertainty estimation in disparity computation. We consider this problem at a postprocessing stage, i. e. once the disparity map has been computed, and {{suppose that the}} only information available is the <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>pair.</b> The method, which consists of sampling from the posterior distribution given the <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>pair,</b> allows the prediction of large errors which occur with low probability, and accounts for spatial correlations. The model we use is oriented towards an application to mid-resolution stereo systems, but we give insights on {{how it can be}} extended. Moreover, we propose a new sampling algorithm relying on Markov chain theory and the use of importance sampling to speed up the computation. The efficiency of the algorithm is demonstrated, and we illustrate our method with the computation of confidence intervals and probability maps of large errors, which may be applied to optimize a trajectory in a three dimensional environment...|$|E
