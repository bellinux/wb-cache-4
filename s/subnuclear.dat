25|$|Quantum field {{theories}} for {{the strong}} nuclear force and the weak nuclear force have also been developed. The quantum field theory of the {{strong nuclear force}} is called quantum chromodynamics, and describes the interactions of <b>subnuclear</b> particles such as quarks and gluons. The weak nuclear force and the electromagnetic force were unified, in their quantized forms, into a single quantum field theory (known as electroweak theory), by the physicists Abdus Salam, Sheldon Glashow and Steven Weinberg. These three men shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1979 for this work.|$|E
25|$|After the {{demonstration}} of successful fluorescent protein fragment reconstitution in mammalian cells, Hu et al. described the use of fragmented yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) {{in the investigation of}} bZIP and Rel family transcription factor interactions. This was the first report bZIP protein interaction regulation by regions outside of the bZIP domain, regulation of <b>subnuclear</b> localization of the bZIP domains Fos and Jun by their different interacting partners, and modulation of transcriptional activation of bZIP and Rel proteins through mutual interactions. In addition, this study was the first report of an in vivo technique, now known as the bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay, to provide insight into the structural basis of protein complex formation through detection of fluorescence caused by the assembly of fluorescent reporter protein fragments tethered to interacting proteins.|$|E

500|$|Speckles are <b>subnuclear</b> {{structures}} that are enriched in pre-messenger RNA splicing factors and {{are located in}} the interchromatin regions of the nucleoplasm of mammalian cells. At the fluorescence-microscope level they appear as irregular, punctate structures, which vary in size and shape, and when examined by electron microscopy they are seen as clusters of interchromatin granules. Speckles are dynamic structures, and both their protein and RNA-protein components can cycle continuously between speckles and other nuclear locations, including active transcription sites. Studies on the composition, structure and behaviour of speckles have provided a model for understanding the functional compartmentalization of the nucleus and the organization of the gene-expression machinery ...|$|E
500|$|The quark flavors {{were given}} their names for several reasons. The {{up and down}} quarks are named after {{the up and down}} {{components}} of isospin, which they carry. Strange quarks were given their name because they were discovered to be components of the strange particles discovered in cosmic rays years before the quark model was proposed; these particles were deemed [...] "strange" [...] because they had unusually long lifetimes. Glashow, who coproposed charm quark with Bjorken, is quoted as saying, [...] "We called our construct the 'charmed quark', for we were fascinated and pleased by the symmetry it brought to the <b>subnuclear</b> world." [...] The names [...] "bottom" [...] and [...] "top", coined by Harari, were chosen because they are [...] "logical partners for up and down quarks". In the past, bottom and top quarks were sometimes referred to as [...] "beauty" [...] and [...] "truth" [...] respectively, but these names have somewhat fallen out of use. While [...] "truth" [...] never did catch on, accelerator complexes devoted to massive production of bottom quarks are sometimes called [...] "beauty factories".|$|E
2500|$|These {{composite}} snoRNAs {{have been}} found to accumulate in a <b>subnuclear</b> organelle called the Cajal body and are referred to as small Cajal body-specific RNAs. This is in contrast to the majority of C/D box or H/ACA box snoRNAs, which localise to the nucleolus. These Cajal body specific RNAs are proposed {{to be involved in the}} modification of RNA polymerase II transcribed spliceosomal RNAs U1, U2, U4, U5 and U12. [...] Not all snoRNAs that have been localised to Cajal bodies are composite C/D and H/ACA box snoRNAs.|$|E
2500|$|SUMO {{attachment}} to its target {{is similar to}} that of ubiquitin (as it is for the other ubiquitin-like proteins such as NEDD 8). The SUMO precursor has some extra amino acids that need to be removed, therefore a C-terminal peptide is cleaved from the SUMO precursor by a protease (in human these are the SENP proteases or Ulp1 in yeast) to reveal a di-glycine motif. The obtained SUMO then becomes bound to an E1 enzyme (SUMO Activating Enzyme (SAE)) which is a heterodimer. It is then passed to an E2 which is a conjugating enzyme (Ubc9). Finally, one of a small number of E3 ligating proteins attaches it to the protein. [...] In yeast, there are four SUMO E3 proteins, Cst9, Mms21, Siz1 and Siz2. While in ubiquitination an E3 is essential to add ubiquitin to its target, evidence suggests that the E2 is sufficient in SUMOylation as long as the consensus sequence is present. It is thought that the E3 ligase promotes the efficiency of SUMOylation and in some cases has been shown to direct SUMO conjugation onto non-consensus motifs. E3 enzymes can be largely classed into PIAS proteins, such as Mms21 (a member of the Smc5/6 complex) and Pias-gamma and HECT proteins. Some E3's such as RanBP2 however are neither. Recent evidence has shown that PIAS-gamma is required for the SUMOylation of the transcription factor yy1 but it is independent of the zinc-RING finger (identified as the functional domain of the E3 ligases). SUMOylation is reversible and is removed from targets by specific SUMO proteases. In budding yeast, the Ulp1 SUMO protease is found bound at the nuclear pore, whereas Ulp2 is nucleoplasmic. The distinct <b>subnuclear</b> localisation of deSUMOylating enzymes is conserved in higher eukaryotes.|$|E

5000|$|In 1966, Antonino Zichichi {{recruited}} Coleman as {{a lecturer}} at the then-new summer school at International School for <b>Subnuclear</b> Physics in Erice, Sicily. A legendary figure {{at the school}} throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, Coleman was awarded the title [...] "Best Lecturer" [...] {{on the occasion of}} the school's fifteenth anniversary (1979). His explanation of spontaneous symmetry breaking in terms of a little man living inside a ferromagnet has often been cited by later popularizers. The classic particle physics text Aspects of Symmetry (1985) is a collection of Coleman's lectures at Erice. A quote from his introduction to the book is worth sharing here:I first came to Erice in 1966, to lecture at the fourth of the annual schools on <b>subnuclear</b> physics organized by Nino Zichichi. I was charmed by the beauty of Erice, fascinated by the thick layers of Sicilian culture and history, and terrified by the iron rule with which Nino kept the students and faculty in line. In a word, I was won over, and I returned to Erice every year or two thereafter, to talk of what was past, or passing, or to come, at least insofar as it touched on <b>subnuclear</b> theory…These lectures span fourteen years, from 1966 to 1979. This was a great time to be a high-energy theorist, the period of the famous triumph of quantum field theory. And what a triumph it was, in the old sense of the word: a glorious victory parade, full of wonderful things brought back from far places to make the spectator gasp with awe and laugh with joy. I hope some of that awe and joy has been captured here.|$|E
