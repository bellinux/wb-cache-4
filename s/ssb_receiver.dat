A corresponding expander circuit in the receiver inverts this transformation in order to restore the dynamic range.

Similar techniques are used in audio noise reduction circuits such as those developed for Dolby.|$|E
50|$|The Felsberg {{antenna system}} beams Europe 1's signal southwestward towards France. In the easterly direction, {{transmissions}} are attenuated, so, in Eastern Europe, only a weak signal can be heard. However, {{because of a}} defect in the antenna system, only the carrier frequency is properly screened to the east; the sidebands suffer less attenuation, so that, in the east, sideband reception is adequate (especially if using an <b>SSB</b> <b>receiver)</b> but distorted. Following the collapse of one mast in the four-mast phased array on October 8, 2012, the two-mast reserve antenna has been in use, resulting in a reduced signal in parts of France but a stronger and undistorted signal in northern Europe and the British Isles.|$|E

40|$|The ALMA {{performances}} {{will depend}} on the receiver design and performances. Conflicting requirements on cost, reproducibility, maintainability, bandwidth and noise temperature affect the receiver design, and the capabilities of ALMA. This memo reviews the possible tradeoff between receiver complexity and ALMA performances, considering DSB vs SSB and Bandwidth vs Receiver noise tradeoffs. Realistic scientific applications are considered. This memo reproduces the numerical results obtained in memo 304 using a different approach. However, the conclusion differ because I also account for a scheduling strategy in which high frequency observations are made only when the weather allows. Combined with a reasonable assumption on the distribution of continuum (or dual-line) observations vs single spectral line cases, this assumption favors DSB mixers at high frequencies. DSB receivers may provide a ≃ 10 % advantage above 500 GHz, while <b>SSB</b> <b>receivers</b> would provide a ≃ 10 % advantage below that frequency. Analysis of the Bandwidth/Receiver noise trade-off indicate that reduction of a factor 2 in detection bandwidth can be compensated by improvement by 25 – 30 % in Receiver noise. ...|$|R

5000|$|In SSB, {{the carrier}} is suppressed, {{significantly}} reducing the electrical power (by up to 12 dB) without affecting {{the information in}} the sideband. This makes for more efficient use of transmitter power and RF bandwidth, but a beat frequency oscillator must be used at the receiver to reconstitute the carrier. If the reconstituted carrier frequency is wrong then the output of the receiver will have the wrong frequencies, but for speech (SSB is not used for music) small frequency errors are no problem for intelligibility. Another way to look at an <b>SSB</b> <b>receiver</b> is as an RF-to-audio frequency transposer: in USB mode, the dial frequency is subtracted from each radio frequency component to produce a corresponding audio component, while in LSB mode each incoming radio frequency component is subtracted from the dial frequency.|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedIn order to automatically tune a single-sideband (SSB) radio receiver to the carrier frequency of a voice-modulated, suppressed-carrier, single-sideband radio signal, {{the difference between}} the frequency of the suppressed carrier and the frequency of the local oscillator in the receiver must be determined. A circuit which generates a sinusoidal voltage of the same frequency as the tuning error is examined analytically and experimentally. The design of the circuit is based on the principle that vowel sounds in human speech are periodic. The inputs to the circuit are the audio output of the <b>SSB</b> <b>receiver</b> for which the tuning error is desired and the audio output of an envelope detector which amplitude demodulates the SSB radio signal. The envelope detector provides a reference signal which is a harmonic of the fundamental modulating frequency of the SSB radio signal. This reference signal and the <b>SSB</b> <b>receiver</b> audio are non-linear processed to generate the error voltage. Receiver tuning errors as small as 0. 1 Hertz were measured using this circuit.

25|$|As a result, SSB {{transmissions}} use {{the available}} amplifier energy more efficiently, providing longer-range transmission {{with little or}} no additional cost. Receivers normally select one of the two sidebands to amplify anyway, so implementing <b>SSB</b> in the <b>receiver</b> is simply a matter of allowing it to choose which sideband to amplify on reception, rather than simply choosing one or the other in the design stage.|$|R

The receivers were integrated into a total-power radiometer and atmospheric observations were carried out. The observed spectra were compared to forward model spectra to conclude on the sideband characteristics of the different receivers. The two sideband characterization methods show a high degree of agreement for both SSB receivers with various local oscillator settings. The measured sideband response was used to correct the forward model simulations. This improves the agreement with the atmospheric observations and explains spectral features caused by an unbalanced sideband response. The FTS method also allows to quantify the influence of spurious harmonic responses of the receiver...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{spectral}} {{quality of}} speech signals communicated over high-frequency {{single side band}} (HF-SSB) radio channels is affected by acoustic artifacts like linear frequency transpositions. In this paper, we propose an approach to automatically estimate and correct for the frequency shift given the degraded signal at the <b>SSB</b> <b>receiver.</b> The proposed method utilizes the harmonic nature of the speech signal in the voiced regions. The fundamental harmonic frequency, obtained from an autoregressive model of the spectrum, is used to estimate the offset value for the current frame. The offset values from the adjacent frames are pooled together to provide the most likely estimate for the received signal. Various experiments are performed on frequency shifted degraded speech signals received from the HF-SSB channel. The enhanced speech signal is also applied for a language identification task (LID) where the models are trained on speech data without any frequency shift. In these experiments, the proposed algorithm provides significant improvements over other baseline offset estimation methods in terms of accuracy of offset estimation {{as well as the}} LID system performance (with relative improvements of about 10 - 25 %) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{design and}} {{performance}} of two cooled mm-wave mixers is described. A Josephson point contact mixer was designed for 30 - 40  GHz. The Nb point contact {{is located in a}} symmetrical Nb waveguide flange using suitable insulating material. This construction allows the junction to be adjusted at Troom and makes it mechanically stable against shocks and temperature cycling. At 36  GHz the conversion loss was measured to be 5  dB when using an IF of 60  MHz. The mixer works evenly at frequencies 30 - 40  GHz. A cooled Schottky diode mixer was designed for 75 - 120  GHz. New details of this mixer include improved waveguide, backshort, RF filter and IF matching and bias circuit designs. This mixer is used in a cooled receiver (15  K) where LO is coupled by an adjustable ring-filter. The mixer is followed by a 4. 5 - 5. 0  GHz IF system of TIF = 24  K. For this receiver DSB noise temperatures of TRDSB = 140 - 230  K have been measured at any LO frequency from 75 to 120 GHz. The best <b>SSB</b> <b>receiver</b> noise temperature measured is TRSSB = 275  K at 88  GHz including a quasi-optical feed system. This implies a mixer noise temperature of TMSSB < 100  K. Finally a discussion on noise temperature and noise figure calculations and noise measurements is presented. reviewe...|$|E
