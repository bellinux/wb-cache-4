5|$|In {{addition}} to the signaling pathways described above, hippocampal LTP may be altered {{by a variety of}} modulators. For example, the steroid hormone estradiol may enhance LTP by driving CREB phosphorylation and <b>subsequent</b> dendritic spine growth. Additionally, β-adrenergic receptor agonists such as norepinephrine may alter the protein synthesis-dependent late phase of LTP. Nitric oxide synthase activity may also result in the <b>subsequent</b> activation of guanylyl cyclase and PKG. Similarly, activation of dopamine receptors may enhance LTP through the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway.|$|E

It also distinguished between P.atriplicifolia and P.abrotanoides, while confirming their close relationship. A <b>subsequent</b> multigene study (four cpDNA markers and two nrDNA markers) redrew parts of the Mentheae cladogram, making Rosmarinus a sister group to Perovskia.|$|E
