At the same time, the book deals with the challenges raised, thanks to an interpretation of mobility as a socio-spatial phenomenon, both in social sciences and in urban studies as well as in reference to transport projects and urban policy. Thanks to the contribution of sociologists (Kesselring, Kaufmann, Nuvolati, Mattioli, Colleoni and Boffi), economists (Henckel and Thomaier), urban planners (Lanzani, Pasqui and Pucci), architects (Vendemmia and Longo), mathematician (Tagliolato) and geographer (Nadler, Manfredini), the book tries to understand how <b>spatial</b> <b>mobilities</b> bring about diversified uses of cities, different rhythms and life practices and unexpected and unplanned uses ad conflicts on urban spaces. The book is organised as four parts: Mobilities and the Transformations of Contemporary Cities; Mobility Practices, Policy and Project; Mobilities, Inequalities and Conflicts; Mapping Mobility Practices. The four parts lead us towards a broader understanding of mobilities in relation to the capacity of analysing, planning and designing contemporary cities.

40|$|This chapter {{illustrates}} {{the importance of}} young people’s <b>spatial</b> (im) <b>mobility</b> in facilitating upward social mobility {{in relation to their}} aspirations and provides conceptual resources for research with young people from a development study and human geography perspective. Research on aspirations for upward social mobility, with a particular focus on educational and occupational aspirations, often draws on the neoliberal discourse, shifting the achievement of upward social mobility through the development of higher aspirations toward young people’s individual responsibility (Allen K, Hollingworth S, Urban Studies 50 (3) : 499 – 517, 2013). Despite this, high aspirations alone are not sufficient drivers of upward social mobility as young people are embedded in their social and cultural contexts and enabled or constrained by their socioeconomic conditions. This chapter briefly discusses the concept of social mobility and its drivers - such as the acquisition of social and cultural capital (Reynolds T, Urban Studies 50 (3) : 484 – 498, 2013) and being supported to develop the “right” habitus to move socially upward. It draws attention to the importance of physical mobilities, and in particular neighborhoods are discussed as crucial places where the acquisition of capitals and development of habitus and skills necessary for social mobility are developed. The relationship between <b>spatial</b> and social <b>mobility</b> is illustrated through examples from the global north and south demonstrating how <b>spatial</b> (im) <b>mobility</b> affects young people’s experiences in ways that determine the future choices they perceive as possible and available to them (Winton A, Children’s Geographies 3 (2) : 167 – 184, 2005). Thus research on young people’s social mobility requires an inclusion of the <b>spatial</b> dimension of <b>mobilities</b> to understand how young people navigate themselves toward their aspirations...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} {{centrally}} concerned with young people's capacity {{to identify and}} realise promising educational and occupational pathways. Whilst it is now well established among social scientists that young people have agency, much less is known about what types of agency young people might demonstrate. Based on field research conducted in 2011 - 2012 {{with a group of}} young people studying, working, and living in Nepal's capital city, Kathmandu, the present study scrutinises Western-inspired approaches prevalent in the scholarship on youth which equate agency to resistance and individuality. It does so, by bringing the literature on youth agency into conversation with theoretical work on the concepts of aspiration and mobility. Through an in-depth analysis of young people's time-space-strategies, the thesis contributes to existing literature in three ways: First, it shows that young people may grow in power as they learn to fulfil social obligations and foster stronger relationships with other people. Second, it illustrates that young people's agency may not only take the form of observable practices, but may also reside in young people’s active efforts to think through their options for improving their own and other people's situation. Third, it highlights the importance of young people's <b>spatial</b> <b>mobilities</b> and immobilities in negotiating various social pressures and in developing a sense of themselves as competent, educated, and successful people. The findings of this thesis are, therefore, of relevance to the interdisciplinary field of youth studies as well as to emerging debates in geography about the apparent need to produce 'aspirational citizens' and about the meanings attached to <b>spatial</b> (im) <b>mobility</b> in contemporary societies.

50|$|Housing {{segregation}} {{affects the}} development of concentrated areas of poverty, especially among racial minorities groups. Housing segregation interacts with existing poverty rates among minority groups, especially African Americans and Hispanics, to perpetuate the cycle of poor people moving into concentrated areas of poverty. These concentrated areas of poverty often experience a lack of public services and infrastructure. Studies have shown that these residential areas often have less employment opportunities, unequal schooling environments, and increased health risks. These factors combine to perpetuate poverty and prevent social and <b>spatial</b> <b>mobility.</b> The lack of employment opportunities come in many different forms such as decreased accessibility to jobs because of transportation or unavailability of jobs due to location. The result of unequal economic opportunities is the increase in income segregation. This further perpetuates poverty because low-income residents experience higher rent burden which forces them to accept low quality housing. This cycle of poverty also extends between generations. This means that children living in low-income neighborhoods {{are more likely to}} experience poverty and the same living standards as their parents' generation.|$|E

40|$|The {{introductory}} chapter briefly {{describes the}} fragmentation of research activities in recent decades which {{try to understand the}} causes and consequences of human <b>spatial</b> <b>mobility.</b> Traditionally, research on <b>spatial</b> <b>mobility</b> {{is considered to be a}} separate field from migration studies, which is dominated by the study of international migration and integration research. Instead of this separation, we propose a framework that integrates the study of internal and international <b>spatial</b> <b>mobility</b> by defining basic concepts of different types of mobility and the functions they may fulfil. <b>Spatial</b> <b>mobility,</b> regarded as a tool for improvement of welfare production, has two primary functions bridging distances and improving the living environment. The interdependence between family dynamics and <b>spatial</b> <b>mobility</b> both the positive and negative consequences of <b>spatial</b> <b>mobility</b> on family dynamics and the impacts of family dynamics such as life-course transitions on mobility is also discussed. The final section introduces ten original research articles addressing three major fields of research on the relationships among different types of <b>spatial</b> <b>mobility,</b> family dynamics and living arrangements. The first three chapters primarily concern the question how international migration and family formation affect each other. The second part consists of three chapters focusing on the consequences of various forms of work-related mobility on family life and couple relationships. The last part of the volume comprises four chapters that scrutinize the relationships between specific life-course transitions, such as parental divorce or retirement, and different forms of mobility...|$|E

40|$|This book brings {{together}} ten original empirical works {{focusing on the}} influence of various types of <b>spatial</b> <b>mobility</b> - be it international or national- on partnership, family and work life.

Complementing to this, this volume presents new empirical studies on job-related residential mobility and its impact on the relationship quality of couples, family life, and union dissolution. It also highlights the importance of research that looks at the reciprocal relationships between mobility and life course events such as young adults leaving the parental home in international migration context, re-arrangements of family life after divorce and <b>spatial</b> <b>mobility</b> of the elderly following life transitions.

30|$|Demographic {{factors such}} as size of the {{population}}, population growth rate, age composition, life expectancy, family size, spatial dispersal, occupational status, and employment pattern affect the demand for goods and services. Markets with growing populations and incomes are growth markets (Hamel and Prahalad 1994). A rapidly increasing population indicates a growing demand for many products. High population growth rate also indicates an enormous increase in labor supply. When the Western countries experienced the industrial revolution, they had the problem of labor supply because the population growth rate was comparatively low. Labor shortage and rising wages encouraged the growth of labor-saving technologies and automation. But most developing countries of today are experiencing population explosion and in some countries, a sort of labor surplus. The governments of developing countries, therefore, encourage labor-intensive methods of production. Capital-intensive methods, automation, and even rationalization are opposed by labor and many sociologists, politicians, and economists in these countries (McDougall and Oviatt 2000). The population growth rate, thus, is an important environmental factor which affects businesses. Cheap labor and growing markets have encouraged many multinational corporations to invest in developing countries. The occupational and <b>spatial</b> <b>mobilities</b> of population have implications for business. If labor is easily mobile between different occupations and regions, its supply will be relatively smooth, and this will affect the wage rate. If labor is highly heterogeneous in respect of language, caste and religion, ethnicity, etc., personnel management {{is likely to become}} a more complex task. The heterogeneous population with its varied tastes, preferences, beliefs, temperaments, etc., gives rise to differing demand patterns and calls for different marketing strategies (Greenaway et al. 2008).|$|R
