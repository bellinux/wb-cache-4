25|$|Like most {{industrialists}} of his era, Roach was staunchly anti-union, {{and insisted}} his employees negotiate {{on an individual}} basis for their wages. Roach however, took the concept of individual negotiation much further than most of his contemporaries. Instead of paying a set wage to workers based on their qualifications or skill, he organized a sliding <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>wages</b> for each group, based on a set of criteria Roach himself deemed important. A worker who met all the criteria would receive the top rate, while those who did not would have their wages progressively reduced, depending on the number of criteria they failed. Criteria for payment included not only a worker's skill level, but his punctuality, dependability, eagerness and quality of work, in addition to which his moral character was subject to assessment. Workers who spent too much on alcohol, who paid their rent erratically, whose families were poorly clothed, or whose children did not attend church or school, could expect to have their wages reduced still further.|$|E
2500|$|The Australian Boot Trade Employees Federation, a {{registered}} union sought {{the assistance of}} the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration under the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904, in relation to what the union said was an industrial dispute with boot manufacturers that extended beyond the limits of any one State. While Whybrow & Co is named {{in each of the three}} judgements, it was one of a wide range of boot manufacturers in four States, New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia and Victoria, who had received a letter from the union which gave the employers an ultimatum, either the employer agreed to the union's demands or the union would approach the Arbitration Court. Higgins J held that this was a valid means of establishing an industrial dispute and that there was discontent among employees that would have broken out in strikes but for the hope of relief from the Arbitration Court. The process of a establishing a dispute by way of serving a [...] "log of claims", referred to as a paper dispute, was controversial at the time. The demands primarily concerned wages, unskilled labour, apprentices and boy labourers. In the Arbitration Court George Beeby appeared for the union, Mitchell [...] and Starke appeared for some employers and various other employers were separately represented. In fixing the minimum wages, Higgins J adopted the requirement of a [...] "living wage" [...] he had established in the Harvester case despite the High Court holding in R v Barger that the Excise Act 1906 which gave rise to the Harvester decision was constitutionally invalid. Higgins J attributed criticism of the living wage as [...] "the natural discontent of defeated parties and their partisans". In considering the claims in relation to apprentices, the Arbitration Court looked at the conditions for apprentices in the boot trade, community concerns, the implications for employers as well as the availability of technical schools as part of that apprenticeship. While the decision states that the <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>wages</b> should be higher towards the end of the apprenticeship, the proposed award set wages for apprentices and other boys according to their age.|$|E
40|$|Results of labour {{appraisal}} {{provide a}} foundation for determination <b>of</b> <b>wages,</b> and more precisely — they should be a basis for constructing pay schedules. There are various techniques <b>of</b> fixing basic <b>wage</b> rates according to results of appraisal, and their choice cannot be indifferent from the motivational point of view. The {{aim of this study}} is to present techniques of fixing one- and multi-level (bracket) wage rates. Multi-level wage rates, the application of which should be as wide as one-level wage rates, have received most attention in this study. The author analyzes four variants in construction <b>of</b> fork <b>wage</b> rates: 1) based on constant and equal <b>scales</b> <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> brackets for a given job and on constant difference in amounts of money between the lowest wage rates with regard to consecutive categories,- 2) based on constant <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> brackets and on constant percentage difference between the lowest wage rates for consecutive categories (work posts) 3) based on constant difference in amounts of money between the lowest wage rates for consecutive work posts and on constant percentage <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> wage-rate brackets at a given work post; 4) based on constant percentage difference between the lowest wage rates for consecutive work posts as well as on constant percentage <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> rates at a given post. The last-mentioned variant provides the strongest motivation and, therefore, the author recommends its application in relation to the managerial cadre.

60|$|Old age, of course, makes pauperism. And {{then there}} is the accident, the thing happening, the death or {{disablement}} of the husband, father, and bread-winner. Here is a man, with a wife and three children, living on the ticklish security of twenty shillings per week--and there are hundreds of thousands of such families in London. Perforce, to even half exist, they must live up to the last penny of it, so that a week's wages (one pound) is all that stands between this family and pauperism or starvation. The thing happens, the father is struck down, and what then? A mother with three children can do little or nothing. Either she must hand her children over to society as juvenile paupers, in order to be free to do something adequate for herself, or she must go to the sweat- shops for work which she can perform in the vile den possible to her reduced income. But with the sweat-shops, married women who eke out their husband's earnings, and single women who have but themselves miserably to support, determine the <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>wages.</b> And this <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>wages,</b> so determined, is so low that the mother and her three children can live only in positive beastliness and semi-starvation, till decay and death end their suffering.|$|E
60|$|At the Trades Union Congress {{now being}} held in London, the Gasworkers' Union moved that {{instructions}} be given the Parliamentary Committee to introduce a Bill to prohibit the employment of children under fifteen years of age.

The representatives of 514,000 workers voted against the resolution, while the representatives of 535,000 workers voted in favour of it. When 514,000 workers oppose a resolution prohibiting child-labour under fifteen, it is evident that a less-than-living wage is being paid to an immense number of the adult workers of the country.|$|E

These men below there are still, as a class, wonderfully patient and reasonable, quite prepared to take orders and recognise superior knowledge, wisdom and nobility.

Implicit rather than expressed is their demand for wisdom and right direction from those to whom the great surplus and freedom of civilisation are given. It is an entirely reasonable demand if man is indeed a social animal. But {{we have got to}} treat them fairly and openly. This patience and reasonableness and willingness for leadership is not limitless. It is no good scoring our mean little points, for example, and accusing them of breach of contract and all sorts of theoretical wrongs because they won't abide by agreements to accept a certain <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>wages</b> when the purchasing power of money has declined. When they made that agreement they did not think of that possibility. When they said a pound they thought of what was then a poundsworth of living. The Mint has since been increasing its annual output of gold coins to two or three times the former amount, and we have, as it were, debased the coinage with extraordinary quantities of gold. But we who know and own did nothing to adjust that; we did not tell the working man of that; we have let him find it out slowly and indirectly at the grocer's shop. That may be permissible from the lawyer's point of view, but it certainly isn't from the gentleman's, and it is only by the plea that its inequalities give society a gentleman that our present social system can claim to endure.|$|E

5000|$|Such {{legislation}} continued, {{at least}} theoretically, in force until the awakening effected {{by the beginning}} of the Industrial Revolution—that is, until the combined effects of steady concentration of capital in the hands of employers and expansion of trade, followed closely by an unexampled development of invention in machinery and application of power to its use, xvi. 1 a completely altered the face of industrial England. From time to time, in respect of particular trades, provisions against truck and for payment <b>of</b> <b>wages</b> in current coin, similar to the act of Edward IV. in the woollen industry, were found necessary, and this branch of labour legislation developed through the reigns of Anne and the four Georges until consolidation and amendment were effected, after the completion of the industrial revolution, in the Truck Act 1831. From the close of the 17th century and during the 18th century the legislature is no longer mainly engaged in devising means for compelling labourers and artisans to enter into involuntary service, but rather in regulating the summary powers of justices of the peace in the matter of dispute between masters and servants in relation to contracts and agreements, express or implied, presumed to have been entered into voluntarily on both sides. While the movement to refer labour questions to the jurisdiction of the justices thus gradually developed, the main subject matter for their exercise of jurisdiction in regard to labour also changed, even when theoretically for a time the two sets of powers—such as (a) moderation of craft guild ordinances and punishment of workers refusing hire, or (b) fixing <b>scales</b> <b>of</b> <b>wages</b> and enforcement <b>of</b> labour contracts—might be concurrently exercised. Even in an act of George II (1746) for settlement of disputes and differences as to wages or other conditions under a contract of labour, power was retained for the justices, on complaint of the masters of misdemeanour or ill-behaviour on the part of the servant, to discharge the latter from service or to send him to a house of correction [...] " [...] there to be corrected," [...] that is, to be held to hard labour for a term not exceeding a month or to be corrected by whipping. In an act with similar aims of George IV (1823), with a rather wider scope, the power to order corporal punishment, and in 1867 to hard labour, for breach of labour contracts had disappeared, and soon after the middle of the 19th century the right to enforce contracts of labour also disappeared. Then breach of such labour contracts became simply a question of recovery of damages, unless both parties agreed that security for performance of the contract shall be given instead of damages.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{argues that}} the 1990 - 93 {{recession}} in Sweden offered a natural experiment to test hypotheses about Sweden''s success in maintaining low unemployment in the 1980 s. The paper identifies a fundamental shift in the macroeconomic policy regime in 1991 as {{the main cause of}} the subsequent detioration in employment. That shift was undertaken in part because of an exaggerated belief in the efficacy of active labour market policy (ALMP). By 1991 most of the policy instruments of the Swedish Model had already been undermined and ALMP was left with sole responsibility for maintaining employment. There so also a strong body of research finding modest positive effects on the subsequent employment experience of participants for improved placement services and assistance with job search, but the result for the other components of ALMP, such as training, are at best ambiguous. That suggests that policy in Britain {{in recent years has been}} moving in the right direction, with more emphasis on the programmes run by the Employment Service, less emphasising on training and a sceptical approach to the large <b>scale</b> implementation <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> subsidies. The key lesson from the experience of Sweden in the early 1990 s is that an inflated view of the efficacy of ALMP can lead to the fatal neglect of other policy instruments...|$|R

30|$|A {{second study}} by Druant et al. (2012) {{examines}} {{the frequency and}} character <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> and price increases and their interrelation. (Recall that the degree <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> and price rigidity determines the speed of {{adjustment of the economy}} to macroeconomic shocks and with it the <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> the adjustment costs.) The authors’ examination of the speed with which firms change prices and wages indicates that the frequency of the latter is roughly one half that of the former—although both “series” display considerable time dependence. The overall stickiness <b>of</b> <b>wages</b> thus exceeds that of prices. The frequency <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> adjustment evinces lower dispersion across sectors, and higher dispersion across countries, than does the frequency of price adjustment. Coupled with widespread wage indexation, the implication <b>of</b> price and <b>wage</b> rigidity is real wage rigidity, which makes the adjustment of the economy to aggregate shocks more costly. The authors’ cet. par. analysis <b>of</b> price and <b>wage</b> rigidity at the firm level indicates that prices are more flexible where competitive pressures in product markets are strong and where labor costs account for a smaller fraction <b>of</b> total costs. <b>Wages</b> are more flexible where bargaining is decentralized (being conducted at the firm level as opposed to the national/sectoral/regional level) and where the coverage of collective bargaining and the stringency of employment protection legislation are low. Finally, descriptive evidence is provided (e.g., on the comparable frequency <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> and price changes and the synchronization between the timing <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> and price changes) showing that wages and prices feed into each other at the firm level and that wage and price rigidity are interrelated especially in labor-intensive sectors.|$|R

The augmentation of the production function by human capital did not reduce the elasticity of physical capital as suggested by Mankiw, Romer and Weil (1992). Moreover, it is investigated if the factors shares are really equal to their output elasticity.

40|$|This study uses {{establishment}} {{level data}} {{to examine the}} effect of unionism on the wage structure within establishments. The major finding is that unionism substantively reduces within-establishment dispersion <b>of</b> <b>wages,</b> in part through explicit wage practices, such as single rate or automatic progression modes <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> payment as opposed to merit reviews and individual determination. Dispersion <b>of</b> <b>wages</b> between organized plants is reduced compared to dispersion <b>of</b> <b>wages</b> between unorganized plants, but by more modest amounts. Overall, the evidence suggests a major role for explicit union wage policies on dispersion <b>of</b> <b>wages</b> within firms and in the economy as a whole. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{new evidence}} about wage stickiness {{and the nature}} <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> setting. We use a unique micro dataset on monthly frequency, covering wages in the Icelandic private sector for the period from 1998 - 2010, and draw the following conclusions. First, the mean frequency <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> change is 10. 8 % per month. When weighted for heterogeneity across industries and occupations the result is almost identical; the frequency of change is 10. 5 % per month. Second, only 0. 5 % <b>of</b> monthly <b>wage</b> changes are decreases. Third, the mean duration <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> spells is 8. 9 months. Onefifth <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> spells last longer than a year while other spells last for one year or shorter. Fourth, wage setting displays strong features of time-dependence: half <b>of</b> all <b>wage</b> changes are synchronised in January, but other adjustments are staggered through the year. Fifth, there is limited evidence of state-dependence: frequency <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> increases, size <b>of</b> increases, frequency <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> decreases and size of decreases do not correlate with inflation. However, both frequency and size <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> decreases have significant correlation with unemployment. Sixth, the hazard function for wages is mostly flat during the first months but has a large twelve-month spike. These facts align with a model <b>of</b> time-dependent <b>wage</b> contracts <b>of</b> fixed duration. ...|$|R
