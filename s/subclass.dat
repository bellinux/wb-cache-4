40|$|Abstract. <b>Subclassing</b> in {{collections}} of related classes may require re-implementation of otherwise valid classes {{just because they}} utilize outdated parent classes, a phenomenon that {{is referred to as}} the <b>subclassing</b> anomaly. The <b>subclassing</b> anomaly is a serious problem since it can void the benefits of code reuse altogether. This paper offers an analysis of the <b>subclassing</b> anomaly in an evolving object-oriented compiler. The paper also outlines a solution for the <b>subclassing</b> anomaly that is based on alternative code reuse mechanism, named class overriding. ...|$|R

Tube-dwelling anemones or cerianthids look {{very similar to}} sea anemones, but belong to an entirely different <b>subclass</b> of anthozoans. They are solitary, living buried in soft sediments. Tube anemones live and can withdraw into tubes, which are made of a fibrous material, which is made from secreted mucus and threads of nematocyst-like organelles, known as ptychocysts.|$|E
40|$|AbstractTwo new <b>subclasses</b> of {{harmonic}} univalent functions {{defined by}} convolution are introduced. The <b>subclasses</b> generate {{a number of}} known <b>subclasses</b> of harmonic mappings, and thus provide a unified treatment {{in the study of}} these <b>subclasses.</b> Sufficient coefficient conditions are obtained that are shown to be also necessary when the analytic parts of the harmonic functions have negative coefficients.

50|$|One {{possible}} {{solution is to}} make instance variables private to their defining class and force <b>subclasses</b> to use accessors to modify superclass states. A language could also make it so that <b>subclasses</b> can control which inherited methods are exposed publicly. These changes prevent <b>subclasses</b> from relying on implementation details of superclasses and allow <b>subclasses</b> to expose only those superclass methods that are applicable to themselves.|$|R
30|$|Several <b>subclasses</b> of meromorphic {{functions}} in the unit disk are introduced by means of convolution with a given fixed meromorphic function. Subjecting each convoluted-derived function in the class to be subordinated to a given normalized convex function with positive real part, these <b>subclasses</b> extend the classical <b>subclasses</b> of meromorphic starlikeness, convexity, close-to-convexity, and quasi-convexity. Class relations, as well as inclusion and convolution properties of these <b>subclasses,</b> are investigated.|$|R

5|$|Since {{the year}} 2000, taxonomic studies using cladistical {{analyses}} of multiple organ systems, shell morphology (including fossil species) and modern molecular phylogenetics {{have resulted in}} the drawing up of what experts believe is a more accurate phylogeny of the Bivalvia. Based upon these studies, a new proposed classification system for the Bivalvia was published in 2010 by Bieler, Carter & Coan. In 2012, this new system was adopted by the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) for the classification of the Bivalvia. Some experts still maintain that Anomalodesmacea should be considered a separate <b>subclass,</b> whereas the new system treats it as the order Anomalodesmata, within the <b>subclass</b> Heterodonta. Molecular phylogenetic work continues, further clarifying which Bivalvia are most closely related and thus refining the classification.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} amphibians {{evolved in}} the Devonian period from sarcopterygian fish with lungs and bony-limbed fins, features that were helpful in adapting to dry land. They diversified and became dominant during the Carboniferous and Permian periods, but were later displaced by reptiles and other vertebrates.

If it gets washed out of its burrow by strong currents, it contracts into a pearly glistening ball which rolls about. Tube-dwelling anemones which live in parchment-like tubes, are in the anthozoan <b>subclass</b> Ceriantharia, and are only distantly related to sea anemones.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} the Nazarov {{cyclization}} as a tool in organic synthesis stems from the utility and ubiquity of cyclopentenones as both motifs in natural products (including jasmone, the aflatoxins, and a <b>subclass</b> of prostaglandins) and as useful synthetic intermediates for total synthesis. The reaction {{has been used in}} several total syntheses and several reviews have been published.|$|E
5|$|Ticks {{are small}} arachnids, {{part of the}} order Parasitiformes. Along with mites, they {{constitute}} the <b>subclass</b> Acari. Ticks are ectoparasites (external parasites), living by feeding on the blood of mammals, birds, and sometimes reptiles and amphibians.

5|$|Aggressive mimicry {{is found}} in predators (or parasites) that share the same {{characteristics}} as a harmless species, allowing them to avoid detection by their prey (or host). The mimic may resemble the prey or host itself, or another organism that is either neutral or beneficial to the signal receiver.

5|$|In {{addition}} to the 16 living orders, there are 9 extinct orders and one superfamily known only from fossils. The relationship of these to living groups and to each other is controversial.
