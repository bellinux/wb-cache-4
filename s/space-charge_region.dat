By applying impedance spectroscopy, this study shows that electric field-induced peculiar <b>space-charge</b> <b>regions</b> form in these glasses, in the bulk adjacent to the glass-electrode interfaces. In addition, submission of these glasses to the action of a long-term electric field results in development of surface crystallization, even below the glass transition temperature. Evidence has been given in the literature that such a phenomenon involves electric field-induced redox-type electrochemical reactions that develop, simultaneously, at both glass-electrode interfaces, promoting β-PbF 2 crystallites nucleation toward the cathode side. Accordingly, it is here concluded that the above mentioned <b>space-charge</b> <b>regions</b> should incorporate those electroactive species that look forward {{to participate in the}} redox reactions that subsequently promote incidence of this non-spontaneous crystallization phenomenon.

This work presents an analytical framework for assessing the ultimate performance of non-planar solar-cells based on materials and geometry.
