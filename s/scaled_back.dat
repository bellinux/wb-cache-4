5|$|After a brief postwar increase, Troy's {{population}} began {{a continuing}} decline. The city began {{the first of}} several urban renewal plans shortly after adopting its 1962 master plan. Those plans called for the demolition of many buildings downtown, {{to be replaced by a}} new arterial road, large public housing projects and a shopping mall. After various delays, those projects were either <b>scaled</b> <b>back</b> or abandoned entirely. In the interim many businesses either closed or moved out of downtown.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{designed}} as a fighter-like aircraft capable of very high speeds and altitudes, the project was repeatedly <b>scaled</b> <b>back</b> over time and the U.S. Air Force eventually abandoned it.

In flight testing, the Avrocar proved to have unresolved thrust and stability problems that limited it to a degraded, low-performance flight envelope; subsequently, the project was cancelled in September 1961.|$|E

5|$|American's service {{peaked in}} 1992 with 265 daily departures, after which flights were {{gradually}} <b>scaled</b> <b>back</b> until the hub eventually closed in 1995. American cited {{the aftermath of}} the early 1990s recession and the lack of local passengers as reasons for the closure. As American scaled down its operations, it subleased its gates to other carriers, largely in order to cover the debt used to construct the hub facilities, which American had guaranteed. Southwest Airlines quickly filled the void by seizing 54% of the Nashville market and making it a focus city, with American remaining as the second-largest carrier at Nashville, followed by Delta Air Lines.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, a new US223 bypass {{was built}} around Adrian, {{resulting}} in the relocation of M-34 to end at BUS US223/M-52. Finally, in 1966, when a new alignment of M-99 highway was opened, the western terminus of M-34 was <b>scaled</b> <b>back</b> to end at the new highway near Osseo. In 2003, the short connector between M-34 and US223 was abandoned and obliterated. Industrial Drive, which is known internally at MDOT as Connector 34, is a new connector between the two highways that was assumed into the state trunkline system at the same time.|$|E

Before a series of truncations in the 1950s, the highway continued along the Huron River to New Boston and Belleville. The trunkline was progressively <b>scaled</b> <b>back</b> to Flat Rock before being decommissioned in 1957.|$|E
