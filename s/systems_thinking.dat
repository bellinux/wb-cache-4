25|$|The American {{sociologist}} Talcott Parsons {{carried on}} the work of the early founders mentioned above in his early (1937) work on action theory. By 1951, Parsons places these earlier ideas firmly into the realm of formal systems theory in The Social System. For the next several decades, this synergy between general <b>systems</b> <b>thinking</b> and the further development of social system theories is carried forward by Parson's student, Robert K. Merton, and a long line of others, in discussions of theories of the middle-range and social structure and agency. During part of this same period, from the late 1970s through the early 1990s, discussion ensues in any number of other research areas about the properties of systems in which strong correlation of sub-parts leads to observed behaviors variously described as autopoetic, self-organizing, dynamical, turbulent, and chaotic. All of these are forms of system behavior arising from mathematical complexity. By the early 1990s, the work of social theorists such as Niklas Luhmann began reflecting these themes of complex behavior.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the impact of a simulation-based learning environment on elementary school students' (11 - to 12 - year old) development of <b>system</b> <b>thinking</b> skills. The learning environment included interactive simulations using the Stagecast Creator software to simulate the ecosystem of a marsh. Simulations are an important tool in any effort to develop <b>system</b> <b>thinking,</b> because they have the potential to highlight the dynamic nature of systems. Before the implementation of the learning environment (over a period of 5, 90 minutes lessons) two written tests were administered to the students, investigating the development of seven aspects of <b>system</b> <b>thinking.</b> The same tests were administered after the implementation. Specifically, four of the tasks included in each test were associated with skills concerning the structure and the elements of a system and three were associated with the processes and interactions taking place within a system.

The proposed learning environment provoked considerable improvements in some <b>system</b> <b>thinking</b> skills during a relatively brief learning process. However, the learning environment was not successful in promoting feedback thinking. We interpret these results in view of the difficulties encountered by the students.
