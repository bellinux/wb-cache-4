5|$|Dao: Daos are single-edged Chinese swords, {{primarily}} {{used for}} slashing and chopping. The {{most common form}} {{is also known as}} the Chinese sabre, although those with wider blades are sometimes referred to as Chinese broadswords. In China, the dao {{is considered one of the}} four traditional weapons, along with the gun (stick or staff), qiang (spear), and the jian (sword). The earliest dao date from the Shang Dynasty in China's Bronze Age, and are known as zhibeidao (直背刀)– straight backed knives. As the name implies, these were straight-bladed or slightly curved weapons with a <b>single</b> <b>edge.</b> Originally bronze, these weapons were made of iron or steel by the time of the late Warring States period as metallurgical knowledge became sufficiently advanced to control the carbon content. Originally less common as a military weapon than the jian– the straight, double-edged blade of China– the dao became popular with cavalry during the Han dynasty due to its sturdiness, superiority as a chopping weapon, and relative ease of use– it was generally said that it takes a week to attain competence with a dao/saber, a month to attain competence with a qiang/spear, and a year to attain competence with a jian/straight sword. Soon after dao began to be issued to infantry, beginning the replacement of the jian as a standard-issue weapon. Late Han dynasty dao had round grips and ring-shaped pommels, and ranged between 85 and 114 centimeters in length. These weapons were used alongside rectangular shields.|$|E
5|$|In Kirkland's initial {{description}} of Eolambia, he considered {{it to be}} a member of the Hadrosauridae, as defined by David B. Weishampel, David B. Norman, and Dan Grigorescu in 1993. Weishampel and colleagues used seven unifying characteristics to define the Hadrosauridae: the upward expansion of the ascending process of the maxilla; the absence of the paraquadrate foramen, which separates the quadrate and quadratojugal; the location of the angular on the inner surface of the lower jaw; the absence of the surangular foramen on the surangular; the narrow teeth of the maxilla; the presence of three or more teeth in each dentary tooth position; and the reduction of the top margin of the scapular blade. The first, fifth, sixth, and seventh of these traits were recognized in Eolambia, with the rest being unknown due to missing material. Kirkland further assigned Eolambia to the Euhadrosauria, defined by Weishampel and colleagues to include the common ancestor of Hadrosaurinae (now the Saurolophinae) and Lambeosaurinae – the two primary branches of hadrosaurids – and all of its descendants. This assignment was based on five characteristics, all present in Eolambia: the presence of denticles on the premaxilla; the quadrate's narrow joint with the lower jaw; the narrow dentary teeth; the presence of a <b>single</b> <b>edge,</b> or carina, on each dentary tooth; and the angled deltopectoral crest on the humerus.|$|E

25|$|A Y-Δ transform, an {{operation}} that replaces a degree-three vertex in a graph by a triangle connecting its neighbors, is sufficient (together with the removal of parallel edges) to reduce any Apollonian network to a single triangle, and more generally the planar graphs that {{can be reduced to}} a <b>single</b> <b>edge</b> by Y-Δ transforms, removal of parallel edges, removal of degree-one vertices, and compression of degree-two vertices are exactly the planar partial 3-trees.

25|$|In general, {{determining}} the crossing number of a graph is hard; Garey and Johnson showed in 1983 {{that it is}} an NP-hard problem. In fact the problem remains NP-hard even when restricted to cubic graphs and to near-planar graphs (graphs that become planar after removal of a <b>single</b> <b>edge).</b> A closely related problem, {{determining the}} rectilinear crossing number, is complete for the existential theory of the reals.|$|E
25|$|By using SPQR {{trees to}} encode the {{possible}} embeddings of the planar {{part of an}} apex graph, {{it is possible to}} compute a drawing of the graph in the plane in which the only crossings involve the apex vertex, minimizing the total number of crossings, in polynomial time. However, if arbitrary crossings are allowed, it becomes NP-hard to minimize the number of crossings, even in the special case of apex graphs formed by adding a <b>single</b> <b>edge</b> to a planar graph.|$|E

25|$|Although Xp {{necessarily}} includes {{at least}} one forest, {{it is not true}} that all graphs in Xp are forests: for instance, X1 consists of two graphs, a seven-vertex tree and the triangle K3. However, the set of trees in Xp may be precisely characterized: these trees are exactly the trees that can be formed from three trees in X'p−1 by connecting a new root vertex by an edge to an arbitrarily chosen vertex {{in each of the three}} smaller trees. For instance, the seven-vertex tree in X1 is formed in this way from the two-vertex tree (a <b>single</b> <b>edge)</b> in X0. Based on this construction, the number of forbidden minors in X'p can be shown to be at least (p!)2. The complete set X2 of forbidden minors for pathwidth-2 graphs has been computed; it contains 110 different graphs.|$|E
25|$|A {{later work}} by Epifanov {{strengthened}} Steinitz's proof that every polyhedral graph {{can be reduced}} to K4 by Δ-Y and Y-Δ transforms. Epifanov proved that if two vertices are specified in a planar graph, then the graph {{can be reduced to}} a <b>single</b> <b>edge</b> between those terminals by combining Δ-Y and Y-Δ transforms with series-parallel reductions. Epifanov's proof was complicated and non-constructive, but it was simplified by Truemper using methods based on graph minors. Truemper observed that every grid graph is reducible by Δ-Y and Y-Δ transforms in this way, that this reducibility is preserved by graph minors, and that every planar graph is a minor of a grid graph. This idea can be used to replace Steinitz's lemma that a reduction sequence exists, in a proof of Steinitz's theorem using induction in the same way. However, there exist graphs that require a nonlinear number of steps in any sequence of Δ-Y and Y-Δ transforms. More precisely, '(n3/2) steps are sometimes necessary, and the best known upper bound on the number of steps is even worse, O(n2).|$|E

2500|$|A {{stronger}} type of embedding than {{a circular}} embedding is a polyhedral embedding, an embedding of a graph on a surface {{in such a}} way that every face is a simple cycle and every two faces that intersect do so in either a single vertex or a <b>single</b> <b>edge.</b> (In the case of a cubic graph, this can be simplified to a requirement that every two faces that intersect do so in a <b>single</b> <b>edge.)</b> Thus, in view of the reduction of the cycle double cover conjecture to snarks, it is of interest to investigate polyhedral embeddings of snarks.
