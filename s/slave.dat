The United States also prohibited the Atlantic <b>slave</b> trade in 1808 and helped intercept illegal <b>slave</b> ships at sea, predominately after 1842.|$|E
5|$|Magoffin's {{plan was}} to unite the <b>slave</b> states around a set of minimum {{concessions}} {{to see if the}} North would accept them as an alternative to war. The concessions included a constitutional amendment repealing any state law that interfered with enforcement of the Fugitive <b>Slave</b> Act, passage of amendments to the Fugitive <b>Slave</b> Act ensuring that any state that would not return a fugitive <b>slave</b> or obstructed a slave's return would compensate the owner of the <b>slave,</b> passage of a law requiring extradition of anyone indicted by a grand jury for enticing the escape of a <b>slave,</b> passage of an amendment to the constitution guaranteeing slavery in all current and future territories south of 36 degrees north latitude, passage of an amendment to the constitution guaranteeing all states the right of using the Mississippi River, and provide protection for southern states in the U.S. Senate from oppressive slavery legislation. After the <b>slave</b> state governors refused Magoffin's plan, he endorsed the Crittenden Compromise, authored by fellow Kentuckian John J. Crittenden.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the federal}} {{government}} criminalized the international <b>slave</b> trade in 1808, after 1820, cultivation of the highly profitable cotton crop exploded in the Deep South, and along with it, the <b>slave</b> population. The Second Great Awakening, especially 1800–1840, converted millions to evangelical Protestantism. In the North, it energized multiple social reform movements, including abolitionism; in the South, Methodists and Baptists proselytized among <b>slave</b> populations.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{importance}} of The <b>Slave</b> Community was recognized by scholars of American slavery, Blassingame's conclusions, methodology, and sources were heavily criticized. Historians criticized the use of <b>slave</b> narratives that were seen as unreliable and biased. They questioned Blassingame's decision to exclude the more than 2,000 interviews with former slaves conducted by the Works Progress Administration (WPA) in the 1930s. Historians argued that Blassingame's use of psychological theory proved unhelpful in his interpretation. Blassingame defended his conclusions at a 1976 meeting of the Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History and in 1979 published a revised and enlarged edition of The <b>Slave</b> Community. Despite criticisms, The <b>Slave</b> Community is a foundational text {{in the study of}} the life and culture of slaves in the antebellum South.|$|E

5|$|Benjamin {{became a}} {{specialist}} in commercial law, of which {{there was a great}} deal in New Orleans' busy river port—a center of international commerce and the domestic <b>slave</b> trade. By 1840, the city had become the fourth largest in the United States and among the wealthiest. Many of the best lawyers in the country practiced commercial law there, and Benjamin successfully competed with them. In one case, he successfully represented the seller of a <b>slave</b> against allegations that the seller knew the <b>slave</b> had incurable tuberculosis. Although Benjamin tried some jury cases, he preferred bench trials in commercial cases and was an expert at appeals.|$|E

The injury caused dizziness, pain, and spells of hypersomnia, which occurred throughout her life. She was a devout Christian and experienced strange visions and vivid dreams, which she ascribed to premonitions from God.|$|E
5|$|Boston was {{an early}} port of the Atlantic {{triangular}} <b>slave</b> trade in the New England colonies, but was soon overtaken by Salem, Massachusetts and Newport, Rhode Island. Boston eventually became a center of the abolitionist movement.

5|$|Conversely, {{there are}} no records of a {{large-scale}} Greek <b>slave</b> revolt {{comparable to that of}} Spartacus in Rome. It can probably be explained by the relative dispersion of Greek slaves, which would have prevented any large-scale planning. <b>Slave</b> revolts were rare, even in Rome. Individual acts of rebellion of slaves against their master, though scarce, are not unheard of; a judicial speech mentions the attempted murder of his master by a boy <b>slave,</b> not 12 years old.|$|E
5|$|Differences {{of opinion}} over social order between {{northern}} and southern states in early United States society, particularly regarding the slavery of Africans and African Americans, ultimately led to the American Civil War. Initially, states entering the Union alternated between <b>slave</b> and free states, keeping a sectional balance in the Senate, while free states outstripped <b>slave</b> states in population and in the House of Representatives. But with additional western territory and more free-soil states, tensions between <b>slave</b> and free states mounted with arguments over federalism and disposition of the territories, whether and how to expand or restrict slavery.|$|E

In the Gortyn code, where all punishment was monetary, fines were doubled for slaves committing a misdemeanour or felony. Conversely, an offence committed against a <b>slave</b> was much less expensive than an offence committed against a free person. As an example, the rape of a free woman by a <b>slave</b> was punishable by a fine of 200 staters (400 drachms), while the rape of a non-virgin <b>slave</b> by another <b>slave</b> brought a fine of only one obolus (a sixth of a drachm).|$|E
