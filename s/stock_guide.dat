40|$|One of the {{difficulties}} of apportioning growing stock across diameter classes in multi- or uneven-aged forests is estimating how closely the target stocking value compares to the maximum stocking that could occur in a particular forest type and eco-region. Although the BDQ method {{had been used to}} develop uneven-aged prescriptions, it is not inherently related to any maximum <b>stocking</b> <b>guide.</b> Adapting Stand Density Index (SDI) to uneven-aged silviculture by apportioning stocking equally in all diameter classes has been proposed. SDImax is the maximum stocking possible for a given species and region and provides a consistent and reliable benchmark on which to base silvicultural prescriptions, which can be expressed as a percentage of maximum SDI (%SDImax). However, allocating a consistent percentage of maximum SDI desired after thinning across all diameter classes raises or lowers the resulting stocking curve, but does not change its shape, as could be done by changing the Q value in BDQ stocking control. This results in high numbers of small trees being retained, regardless of the %SDImax prescribed, and has been a major criticism of using SDI-based stocking control for fuels treatment biomass estimates. The SDI-Flex procedure presented here combines the flexibility of the BDQ method with an SDI-based <b>stocking</b> <b>guide.</b> In this method, a Flex Factor can is used to proportionally reduce the amount of SDI assigned to successively smaller dbh classes. A simple spreadsheet program can be used to iteratively manipulate both the Flex Factor and %SDImax values to arrive at a desired stocking configuration for a particular silvicultural objective...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} whether investor mood, {{driven by}} World Health Organization (WHO) alerts and media news on globally dangerous diseases, is priced in pharmaceutical companies' {{stocks in the}} United States. We concentrate on irrational investors who buy and sell pharmaceutical companies' <b>stocks</b> <b>guided</b> by beliefs as opposed to rational expectations. We argue that disease-related news (DRNs) should not trigger rational trading. We find that DRNs have a positive and significant sentiment effect among investors (on Wall Street). The effect is stronger (weaker) for small (large) companies, who are less (more) {{likely to engage in}} the development of new vaccines in the wake of DRNs. A potential negative mood (on Main Street) - induced by disease related fear - does not alter the positive sentiment effect. Our findings give rise to profitable trading strategies leading to significantly positive performances. Overall, this unparalleled research shows that large events of devastating nature to the economy can be considered as good news to some groups of interest, such as stock market traders...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Several {{commonly}} used stand density indices, such as Reineke 2 ̆ 7 s stand density index, Few and Flewelling 2 ̆ 7 s relative density index, and Curtis 2 ̆ 7 s relative density index, depend in a nonlinear fashion on stand-level means of measured variables. Thus, the stand-level index value {{is not necessarily}} the mean of the plot-level index values. We show formally that this dependency introduces a bias that depends on the sample size or number of plots and on the variance-covariance structure of the measured variables. We then present formulas for estimating the bias and variance or standard error of estimated densities based on a priori knowledge of the variances and covariances or on observed samples data. We also present and compared bootstrap and jackknife methods of estimating the bias and variance associated with sample estimates. The results suggest that for some indices, the bias and variance arising from quick 2 ̆ 7 grab samples 2 ̆ 7 may be large enough to be of practical significance. These results have strong implications for the development and interpretation of <b>stocking</b> <b>guides</b> derived from single plots or from measurement schemes other than those employed in practical applications...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} a management that aims at controlling the removal from the <b>stock,</b> <b>guided</b> by {{a perception of}} the state of the stock derived from limited data that does not allow an ordinary analytic assessment. In simulation modeling, there is a 'real' stock and 'real' removals, and the stock develops according to these removals. The management part creates a feed back loop through a noisy link between the state of the true stock and the actual removals. The performance of the management will depend on how the real removal responds to the stock, and how the stock responds to the removals. Structurally, this is a quite simple feed-back system. The interior of the building blocks is complex and diverse, however, and include obstacles like time lags and stochastic terms. When an analytical assessment is not available, the link between the real stock and the management decisions is harder to understand and model, and it may be noisier. The main emphasis in this paper is finding decision rules that rely on sparse and noisy data. A simulation tool runs as a bootstrap and was made to cover a variety of stocks, decision rules and noise in a versatile way, but on a quite generic level. The link between state of the stock and the basis of the decision was modeled as SSB (or alternatively total stock biomass TSB) derived from the real stock numbers at age, but with random noise and a random year factor. Several types of harvest rules were explored, and pros and cons of various types are highlighted...|$|R

40|$|For Atlantic {{bluefin tuna}} fisheries, the linked issues of {{population}} structure and mixing remain of paramount significance in optimizing utilization {{of a species}} well known for its pan-oceanic migrations. There has been increased scrutiny by scientists and resource representatives of the two <b>stock</b> hypothesis, which <b>guides</b> <b>stock</b> assessments and projections for western Atlantic tuna. The Inter-sessional Conference of ICCAT on Mixing (September 2001) will address methods to incorporate pan-oceanic migrations by Atlantic bluefin tuna in future stock assessments. A metapopulation framework is considered as a less rigid alternative to the current two stock concept. To date, models of mixing between stocks have been considered under two classifications: 1. The Diffusion Model, whereby trans-Atlantic migrants become expatriates, joining the alternate population (true metapopulation) or 2. The Overlap Model, where some fraction of each population undertakes a trans-Atlantic migration on an annual and/or ontogenetic basis, but surviving migrants return annually to their natal region (patchy population). Substantial life history differences between Eastern and Western populations favor the idea that Atlantic bluefin tuna is not a true metapopulation. Therefore, the Overlap Model, which stipulates that populations impact each other through ecological rather than genetic interactions currently has more credence than the Diffusion model. The Overlap Model for exchange ha...|$|R
40|$|In a {{capitalist}} economy prices serve to equilibrate {{supply and demand}} for goods and services, continually changing to reallocate resources to their most efficient uses. However, secondary stock market prices, often viewed as the most 'informationally efficient' prices in the economy, have no direct role in the allocation of equity capital since managers have discretion in determining the level of investment. What is the link between stock price informational efficiency and economic efficiency? We present {{a model of the}} stock market in which: (i) managers have discretion in making investments and must be given the right incentives; and (ii) stock market traders may have important information that managers do not have about the value of prospective investment opportunities. In equilibrium, information in <b>stock</b> prices will <b>guide</b> investment decisions because managers will be compensated based on informative stock prices in the future. The <b>stock</b> market indirectly <b>guides</b> investment by transferring two kinds of information: information about investment opportunities and information about managers' past decisions. The fact that stock prices only have an indirect role suggests that the stock market may not be a necessary institution for the efficient allocation of equity. We emphasize this by providing an example of a banking system that performs as well. ...|$|R

40|$|We study local {{stock market}} {{reaction}} to currency devaluations by a country's central bank.

This negative trend persists for up to 30 days following the announcement. However, one year after the devaluations, the average abnormal returns are significantly positive, suggesting a reversal in trend. On average, the dollar value of the equity market declines by less than the currency devaluation, and devaluations typically have a more negative effect on developing country <b>stock</b> markets. <b>Guided</b> by the theoretical literature, we conduct a cross-sectional analysis of the relation between the local stock market’s abnormal returns and key macroeconomic variables.

40|$|The {{black marlin}} Istiompax indica {{is a highly}} migratory species {{and as a result}} is {{expected}} to show little genetic population structure throughout its broad geographic range. Tissue samples from 183 I. indica were collected from three geographic regions within the central Indo-Pacific and analysed using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA markers. Nuclear genetic heterogeneity was found among populations in the south-western Pacific Ocean, eastern Indian Ocean and South China Sea (significant F-ST values of 0. 013 - 0. 037). Combining information from nuclear markers with published movement and reproductive data suggests that reproductive philopatry plays a role in maintaining contemporary I. indica population structure. Analyses of the mitochondrial control region did not reflect this pattern; however, it identified historical population structure. Differing patterns of genetic population structure revealed by mitochondrial and nuclear markers demonstrated that a transition must have occurred between historical and contemporary population structures. This restructuring presumably reflects a species whose populations have become genetically isolated before experiencing a period of secondary contact. The spatial subdivision evident among populations indicates that I. indica in this central Indo-Pacific region should be managed as three independent <b>stocks,</b> to <b>guide</b> the sustainability of this fisheries resource...|$|R

40|$|Stream {{data are}} often dirty, for example, owing to unreli-able sensor reading, or {{erroneous}} extraction of stock prices. Most stream data cleaning approaches employ a smoothing filter, which may seriously alter the data without preserv-ing the original information. We {{argue that the}} cleaning should avoid changing those originally correct/clean data, a. k. a. the minimum change principle in data cleaning. To capture the knowledge about what is clean, we consider the (widely existing) constraints on the speed of data changes, such as fuel consumption per hour, or daily limit of <b>stock</b> prices. <b>Guided</b> by these semantic constraints, in this paper, we propose SCREEN, the first constraint-based approach for cleaning stream data. It is notable that existing data repair techniques clean (a sequence of) data {{as a whole and}} fail to support stream computation. To this end, we have to relax the global optimum over the entire sequence to the local optimum in a window. Rather than the commonly observed NP-hardness of general data repairing problems, our major contributions include (1) polynomial time algo-rithm for global optimum, (2) linear time algorithm towards local optimum under an efficient Median Principle, (3) sup-port on out-of-order arrivals of data points, and (4) adaptive window size for balancing repair accuracy and efficiency.

40|$|The {{identification}} {{and protection of}} critical spawning habitat for muskellunge (Esox masquinongy) in Green Bay of Lake Michigan is a vital step for re-establishing a self sustaining population. This {{study was designed to}} document the extent of natural reproduction and locate spawning areas using oviduct insertion of radio transmitters into mature females prior to spawning. Expelled transmitters were later located using radio telemetry to identify spawning sites. Between 2009 and 2010, twenty-six of thirty-seven (70 %) implanted transmitters were located as deposited at spawning sites. Using identified spawning locations, habitat selection was estimated for key environmental variables, and spatial models were built to predict muskellunge spawning habitat in Green Bay. Menominee River data were utilized in modeling because it had the most documented successful reproduction in Green Bay. Menominee River muskellunge showed a significant preference for spawning in areas with low to moderate bottom slopes (0 - 3 %), medium percent vegetative coverage (34 - 66 %), where woody debris was present, and in substrates containing silt. Utilizing these identified habitat preferences allowed successful modeling of location and characteristics of spawning areas. Two modeling approaches were used, classification tree and Maxent (maximum entropy). Classification tree models predicted areas to be spawning habitat based mainly on bottom slope, woody debris, and submerged vegetation. Maxent models proved most effective at predicting limited areas as potential spawning locations and correctly classifying most known spawning sites. Maxent models used habitat variables of vegetative cover, bottom slope, percent silt, and presence of woody debris as the main variables to identify spawning habitat. Dissolved oxygen levels averaged 5. 7 mg/L over all Menominee River spawning sites but levels as low as 3. 8 mg/L were observed within specific spawning areas and may cause site specific egg and larval mortality. In the future, habitat preferences and model results could be used to locate suitable locations for <b>stocking</b> muskellunge, <b>guide</b> designations of critical habitat to protect important spawning habitat, and identify areas for rehabilitation projects to enhance muskellunge spawning success...|$|R
