30|$|There {{have been}} a few typical {{research}} efforts dealing with similarity search over streaming time series under DTW. The first is SPRING introduced by Sakurai et al. [13]. The method is very impressive in the computational time. The authors claimed that SPRING is up to 650, 000 times faster than using the naive calculation of the DTW distance. However, SPRING cannot work on z-score normalization, since at each time tick the z-score coefficients (mean and standard deviation) change frequently. When the z-score coefficients change, reusing computed results at previous time ticks is virtually impossible to SPRING. Hence, SPRING cannot be used to compare with our methods. Recently, Gong et al. [21] have introduced NSPRING, an extension of <b>SPING</b> supporting z-score normalization. However, since NSPRING computes current data, created from the current z-score coefficients, and then combines these data with the previous data, created from the previous z-score coefficients, in our opinion the method is inaccurate. With an incessant effort, we have recently developed ISPRING [22], an improved variant of SPRING. ISPRING is SPRING equipped with incremental min–max normalization (see Sect. 4.1). We choose min–max normalization rather than z-score normalization for ISPRING, because the min–max coefficients (minimum and maximum values) of evolving subsequences in streaming time series are occasionally changed, whereas the z-score coefficients of the subsequences are almost changed whenever there is a new-coming data point. For the reason, ISPRING using incremental min–max normalization can use current normalized data with previous normalized data to compute the DTW distance between a new-coming time-series subsequence and a specific time-series pattern if the min–max coefficients of the evolving subsequence are not changed. To extract the min–max coefficients of the new-coming subsequence of one streaming time series on the spot, ISPRING uses a monitoring window anchored at the entry of the time-series stream. The experiments in [21] demonstrated that the size of the monitoring window should be the same length as the pattern. We will compare ESUCR-DTW using incremental min–max normalization with ISPRING in Sect.  5.|$|R

Three vehicles were traveling east bound in single file, Grant was in the third vehicle. He pulled out of line (to the left) to pass both vehicles in front of him, when the middle vehicle also pulled out to pass at the same time. To avoid a collision, Grant suddenly swerved further left, and went onto the shoulder of the oncoming lane, he then over-corrected back {{all the way to the}} right, when his vehicle left the roadway and spun into a ditch, which contained three feet of standing water. Grant was thrown out of his car and into the water. A passerby pulled him out, and he was taken to Jess Parrish Hospital in Titusville, but was dead on arrival. That morning, Grant was en route from his condominium in Winter <b>Spings</b> to the Kennedy Space Center to watch the (last successful) launch of the Space Shuttle Challenger at Cape Canaveral. He was to have been honored by the astronauts for encouraging aviation and space flight. He was 73 years old.

5000|$|The abbey was {{situated}} on an elevated area of ground, of around 23 acres, {{south of the}} River Lud. The river {{was used by the}} abbey to turn the wheel of the grain mill that had been given to them by Alexander of Lincoln 'to ever more to possess', but was too distant for general water needs, or to supply their fishponds. To solve this, the monks dug a ditch to bring water from the springs of Ashwell and St. Helen's at Louth to the abbey grounds. The ditch reached the abbey from the east and then divided into east and west channels around its edges, effectively forming a moat. The western channel circled around northwards and rejoined the main channel. To the east, the water was sent into two fishponds, one 'of great size', was still full of water, and stocked with fish, in the late 1800s. Now known as 'Monks' Dyke', although substantially altered, the main ditch from the Louth <b>spings</b> still survives today.The earliest abbey buildings, built by the monks after the foundation, were plain and unadorned, as preferred by the Cistercians, in the Transitional Norman style. Fragments of decorative stone sculptures, incorporated from the abbey ruins into a 17th-century garden folly in Louth, have been dated to between 1140 and 1160, while an arch, now part of a nearby church, and believed to {{have been part of the}} abbey, also dates to a similar period. Building at the east side of the Cloister Court, including a Chapter-house and Calefactory, were built around 1246, during the time of Abbot Richard of Dunholm, who raised the house [...] "from dust and ashes".|$|E
50|$|Marlowe has married Linda Loring, {{the rich}} {{daughter}} of local tycoon Harlan Potter. Linda and Marlowe first met in The Long Goodbye and their romance is resumed {{at the end}} of Playback. Marlowe resists financial dependence on his willing wife and, after the couple relocate to a grand mansion in Poodle Springs (a mocking reference to Palm Springs), opens a detective agency in the resort. Tension between them rises when, as a result, Marlowe absents himself from the cocktail parties and other social events organised by Linda’s set. Marlowe’s first case comes when he is forced by hoodlums to visit a local criminal named Lipschultz, who operates an illegal gambling house in Riverside, just outside the jurisdiction of Poodle <b>Spings.</b> He has taken an IOU for $100,000 from one of his customers, a Poodle Springs photographer called Les Valentine. Lipshultz's boss, an unrevealed local tycoon, has found out that the sum is missing from the books and has issued a 30-day ultimatum to retrieve the money. Asked to find Valentine, Marlowe accepts on condition that he does not have to shake Valentine down. When Marlowe questions Valentine's wife, Muffy Blackstone, a spoiled socialite and acquaintance of his own wife, she tells him that Valentine is out on a photo shoot. Instead he eventually discovers that Valentine is an alias for a sleazy individual living in Los Angeles with a second wife. When Marlowe calls on Lipshultz again, he finds him killed in his casino office and assists Valentine to escape after he is suspected, not just for this crime but for an earlier slaying in his own office. The melodramatic pay-off exposes the corruption of the Southern Californian rich and confirms Marlowe in his decision to return to Los Angeles. His marriage is wrecked, but he and Linda remain as lovers.|$|E

40|$|In this Master degree {{work there}} is a {{description}} of a safety clutch of a perforator with SDS + chuck. Perforrator‘s main purpose is to drill holes in concrete, metal and wood. Safety clutch purpose is to ensure safety of electrical engine from overworking, which occurs in drilling with drill bit or crown. Safety clutch starts working when electrical engines spins pinion which is placed on cylinder. Pinion is being presseed by the spring to the cylinder‘s knuckles. Drill bit is being placed in the cylinder and when drill bit stucks or if there‘s too high resistance, knuckle goes up and overcomes <b>spings</b> tensile strength – pinion‘s and cylinders knuckles excel. When safety clutch starts working, pinions slide at each other and as friction exists safety clutch‘s pinions worn out. Changing worned out pinions is not complicated, but price of repair takes up to 50 % of a new perforator price. In this Master Degree work {{there is a}} comparison of four similar types of perforator safety clutches. Parameters which are included in the comparison is maximum drilling diameter in concrete, perforator price, clutch elements and safety clutch elements repair price. According to these parameters, manufacturer‘s no. 4 clutch is decided to be the weakest link. Also there is stated clutch‘s stiffness coefficient – 333. According to the stiffness coefficient, spring pushes pinion with a force of 667 N or 6, 67 kg. Averange torque is also stated in this work, as it is needed to make safety clutch work – 73 Nm. In the researched safety clutch knuckles are changed by rolls – rolls can be repaired independently from other safety clutch‘s elements.

40|$|Rock {{and water}} samples were {{collected}} from the Morey Peak 152 ̆ 7 quadrangle in the northern Hot Creek Range, Nye County, Nevada. The water was analyzed for trace element content. The rock samples were analyzed for oxide composition, selected trace element composition, and K-U-Th content. Water sampled from <b>spings,</b> hot springs, and creeks had temperatures ranging between 8 and 60 (DEGREES) C, conductance between 100 and 1, 800 mhos, pH between 5. 4 and 8. 7, and Eh between - 106 and - 301 mv. The water sample set is rich in fluorine although no fluorite has yet been reported from rocks of the area. The fluorine and lithium are being added to the hydrologic system by hot springs. There is an anomalous occurrence of antimony {{on the west side}} of Hot Creek Canyon. Tin, recorded in varying concentrations, does not reflect the tin-sulfosalt assemblage of the Morey Camp area. Zinc content correlates with water from Paleozoic terranes. Uranium content of the water varies between 1 and 19 ppb. The uranium content of these waters is enriched over world averages. The average uranium content of water associated with individual ash-flow sheets increases with decreasing age of the unit. The best correlation of uranium is with selenium although there is a minor positive correlation with pH, Eh, molybdenum, and lithium. Factor analysis of the sample set reveals a U-Li-Se association and also identifies oxidized galena in solution. This analysis suggests that water need only be analyzed for copper, lithium, selenium, uranium, and vanadium in an uranium exploration program. Oxide analyses of these samples show gross similarities to other volcanic suites in central Nevada. The samples, on the average, are enriched in arsenic (to 666 ppm). Copper content varies between 4 and 185 ppm. The rocks of the Morey area are depleted in fluorine although the waters are enriched. An anomalous lithium value is associated with uranium mineralization in Corral Canyon. These rocks are enriched in molybdenum, selenium, tin, and slightly enriched in lead. Uranium contents of samples vary between 1 and 49 ppm. Uranium content of individual ash-flow sheets increases with decreasing age of the unit. Correlation coefficients indicate that in this area uranium is independent of any of the tested variables. Factor analyses suggest that there is an association between beryllium and uranium, arsenic and uranium, and selenium and uranium. The K-U-Th analyses yielded a wide variance of measurements. Potassium content ranges between 0 and 7. 66...|$|E
