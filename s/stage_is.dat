50|$|The Atlas III {{consisted}} of two stages. The first <b>stage</b> <b>was</b> new, but the upper <b>stage</b> <b>was</b> the Centaur, which is still in use today on the Atlas V EELV. The first <b>stage</b> engines <b>were</b> Russian RD-180s, which are also used by the Atlas V. The Atlas III was produced in two versions. The baseline was the Atlas IIIA, but the Atlas IIIB, featuring a twin-engine version of the Centaur upper <b>stage,</b> <b>was</b> also produced.|$|R
50|$|The first <b>stage</b> <b>was</b> a Thor missile in the DSV-2C configuration, and {{the second}} <b>stage</b> <b>was</b> the Delta E, which {{was derived from the}} earlier Delta. Three Castor-1 solid rocket {{boosters}} were clustered around the first stage. Two different solid-fuel upper <b>stages</b> <b>were</b> available; an Altair-2 was used on the baseline version, however this could be replaced with an FW-4D to increase performance. A Delta E with the FW-4D upper <b>stage</b> <b>was</b> designated Delta E1. Six flights used the Delta E configuration and seventeen used the Delta E1.|$|R
5|$|Also {{attributable}} to Gasparo Cairano, and dated at this <b>stage,</b> <b>is</b> the singular St John the Baptist {{placed in the}} tympanum of the capitol of the eponymous Abbey in Parma. The work, undocumented and traditionally attributed by critics to Antonio Ferrari d'Agrate, was assigned in 2010 to the catalog {{of the works of}} Cairano due to obvious correlation with the mature art of the artist. This spread of Gasparo's artistic reach is significant and demonstrates that he could prove a success even outside of Brescia.|$|E
5|$|Chapter 7 {{discusses}} the fifth limb of yoga, Pratyahara, which {{it says is}} of five forms.

Lastly, the time spent in the response <b>stage</b> <b>was</b> dependent on the complexity of the response required by the problem.|$|R
50|$|This {{edition of}} the Vuelta {{contained}} three time trial events, two of which were individual and one a team event. Six <b>stages</b> <b>were</b> classified as mountain stages, while two <b>stages</b> <b>were</b> deemed intermediate <b>stages.</b> Ten of the <b>stages</b> <b>were</b> designated as flat stages, which meant that they were primarily flat but could contain a climb or two of a lesser category.|$|R
50|$|Virtual home <b>staging</b> <b>is</b> a type home staging. The {{interior}} design is created in graphic editors. Virtual <b>staging</b> <b>is</b> especially popular among real estate brokers, photographers and {{interior design}}ers.

The key advantages of virtual staging over Home <b>staging</b> <b>are</b> time and expenses.|$|R
5|$|Elevators, which operate {{differently}} {{depending on}} the hotel, enable the player to go between the five floors of the stage. The faster a <b>stage</b> <b>is</b> cleared, the more points {{will be given to}} the player. Every stage has its own title screen via which the game can be saved. The screens are also used to enter previously played hotel stages and the map of the Mushroom Kingdom, which allows the player to access any visited hotel.|$|E

5|$|Following hatching, larvae {{feed on the}} {{reproductive}} structures of the plant and usually develop through four to six instars. Initially, the young larva feed together, and this <b>stage</b> <b>is</b> their most destructive stage. Through maturation, older larvae become aggressive and cannibalistic, leaving one or two larvae per feeding site (See Interfamilial Predation). They usually have orange heads, black thorax plates, and a body color that is primarily black. Their bodies can also be brown, pink, green, and yellow with many thorny microspines. Mature larvae migrate to the soil, where they pupate for 12 to 16 days.|$|E

50|$|In normal game mode there <b>are</b> 100 <b>stages</b> of {{increasing}} difficulty, a <b>stage</b> select screen <b>is</b> shown where any available <b>stage</b> can <b>be</b> picked to play but only <b>stages</b> 1-5 <b>are</b> available at first. Completing any 4 stages unlocks the next 5, {{and they do}} not have to be completed in any order or in sequence. Thus <b>stages</b> 1-10 <b>are</b> available to play after completing any 4 stages from 1-5 and <b>stages</b> 1-15 <b>are</b> available when any 8 <b>stages</b> <b>are</b> completed until finally all 100 <b>stages</b> <b>are</b> available to play after any 76 <b>stages</b> have <b>been</b> completed. This means that player can choose to skip one stage out of each set of 5 and still be able to play stage 100.|$|R
5|$|Hemimetabolous insects, {{those with}} {{incomplete}} metamorphosis, change gradually by undergoing {{a series of}} molts. An insect molts when it outgrows its exoskeleton, which does not stretch and would otherwise restrict the insect's growth. The molting process begins as the insect's epidermis secretes a new epicuticle inside the old one. After this new epicuticle is secreted, the epidermis releases a mixture of enzymes that digests the endocuticle and thus detaches the old cuticle. When this <b>stage</b> <b>is</b> complete, the insect makes its body swell by taking in a large quantity of water or air, which makes the old cuticle split along predefined weaknesses where the old exocuticle was thinnest.|$|E
5|$|In 2013 {{an appeal}} to raise £3 million was {{launched}} to restore the pools. The fundraising has been supported by The Prince's Trust. The project aims not just to preserve the existing architecture, but also to reopen it as an outdoor lido. This is hampered by poor access to the site {{and the possibility of}} flooding. It is intended to make the work sustainable and environmentally friendly, with renewable sources of energy including water source heat pumps using latent heat from the River Avon. A small landing <b>stage</b> <b>is</b> being proposed to enable access to the pools from river craft.|$|E
5|$|In Alisia Dragoon, {{the player}} {{controls}} the protagonist, Alisia, in her quest {{to save the}} world by defeating the evil forces that killed her father.
