In the plain, the very fertile land is well irrigated by many watercourses, heirs for the most part to the [...] "Lacus Clitorius" [...] of Antiquity, and is suited to annual crops.

40|$|In Mediterranean cooking, oregano is an {{aromatic}} herb {{which is}} mostly {{known for its}} pleasant, characteristic aroma. Although it grows wild throughout the Island of Sicily, it is cultivated {{in order to satisfy}} the growing demand for this herb for seasoning. In order to ensure success, specially selected plant material (superior qualities and good productive performance) is necessary for specialised cultivation. This paper contains the productive results (2000 - 2005) of several oregano accessions, previously characterized in terms of morphology and quality in a field collection catalogue. The productive response was found to vary for the different biotypes under examination.

40|$|The {{decline and}} the {{fragmentation}} of the areas devoted to viticulture in the Mendrisio district (Ticino) {{since the end of}} last Century, as revealed by topographic maps, is a sign of the profound transformation of both landscape and society. It is not only the surface which has changed but also the human activities: - mixed culture has been replaced by <b>specialized</b> <b>cultivation</b> (monoculture) - the variety of vine grown has decreased considerably - the vintner has become independent, working his vineyard parttime only. These transformations reflect the mutual relationship between space and society, inside and towards the outside. Thus three different explanations can be offered: - the "inherited space" {{from the end of the}} last Century - the "polysemic space", i. e. the space at the intersection of relations between the Mendrisiotto and other regions, in particular Ticino and Lombardy, Switzerland and Italy - the existing relations between space and society as far as considered. <br...|$|E

For a long time it has been assumed that these sites are populated exclusively by prokaryotes.

Concerning fungal diversity only fragmentary data are available indicating that highly acidic sites harbour specific and low-diversified fungal communities dominated by dematiaceous fungi. In the present work we focused on the cultivable mycobiota occupying highly acidic (pH < 3) soils which are at the same time saline (sulfate-rich) and are located at geographically isolated localities in the Czech Republic. This study should provide a deep insight into the diversity and biogeographical pattern of acidophilic/tolerant fungi. A combination of classical and <b>specialized</b> <b>cultivation</b> techniques was successfully applied since it significantly contributed to the broadening of the detected fungal spectrum. The revealed fungal assemblages inhabiting highly acidic sites worldwide are closely similar and differ from the ones known from less acidic habitats.

40|$|For centuries, {{olive growing}} {{has played a}} major role in the central regions of Italy, with {{hectares}} of olive groves surrounding hill towns and hamlets as part of a strong deep-rooted farming tradition. With reference to Lazio and Abruzzo, this article makes use of historical documentation, geographical surveys and in-depth interviews with professionals and experts, in order to provide evidence of how olive growing, once of the mixed type, now with <b>specialized</b> <b>cultivations,</b> has somehow challenged the structural features of traditional landscapes. In some cases, this ancient farming tradition has been awarded the ‘Protected Designation of Origin Brand’ according to strict technical production policies. Besides intensive crops, today also practiced on flat ground, for some years now, olive trees have been cultivated by ‘hobby farmers’. This is frequent in fringe areas, threatened by urban sprawl, within small plots belonging to detached family homes conferring a sense of rural ‘revival’. Whether all these diverse settlement patterns are socially and economically sustainable is debatable. Definitely, such persistence in land use, which now and again can be read even as a material survival of certain tree specimens, allows for olive farming as an enduring cultural practice in the face of increasing urbanization...|$|R

40|$|Multifunctionality and {{diversification}} of farming systems, integration of agricultural practices both inter se {{and with the}} non-agricultural productive systems operating on the territory, biodiversity safeguards, and reduction in off-farm inputs, are key factors for all modern development strategies in agricultural areas. Such issues are valid worldwide, but are especially true in areas in which the cultivation of the more widespread and “classical” crops is constrained by factors of varying degree and importance. In Mediterranean areas, where many environmental and economic factors often reduce rural areas to marginal conditions, the search for new crop opportunities {{has become one of}} the newest topics in agricultural research. In this review, we focus on the state-of-the-art cultivation of essential oil crops (with a special interest in herbs) in Mediterranean environments. The following are the major points of our analysis. (1) Growing such crops as <b>specialized</b> <b>cultivations,</b> especially for species native to the selected environments, is the only practical and sustainable way to obtain naturally derived raw matter for both industrial and domestic purposes. (2) Most essential oil crops are suitable for many different uses, and fully adaptable for transformation even by small, local manufacturers. (3) In many cases, they may be grown with environmentally friendly or organic techniques; this enhances their environmental compatibility and also gives them an additional economical advantage, raising their chances to be addressed in the emerging market sector of “natural” products. Our conclusion is that crops grown for the extraction of economically valuable essential oils may be a strategic resource for many environments, even marginal, and that there is scope for farmers to improve the cultivation of such species on arable land. There is room, however, for many agronomic and economic questions to be studied in future experimentation and research...|$|R

40|$|This study {{analyzed}} {{determinants of}} farm-level climate adaptation measures in Africa using a multinomial choice model fitted {{to data from}} a cross-sectional survey of over 8000 farms from 11 African countries. The results indicate that <b>specialized</b> crop <b>cultivation</b> (mono-cropping) is the agricultural practice most vulnerable to climate change in Africa. Warming, especially in summer, poses the highest risk. It encourages irrigation, multiple cropping and integration of livestock. Increased precipitation reduces the probability of irrigation and will benefit most African farms, especially in drier areas. Better access to markets, extension and credit services, technology and farm assets (labor, land and capital) are critical for helping African farmers adapt to climate change. Government policies and investment strategies must support education, markets, credit and information about adaptation to climate change, including technological and institutional methods, particularly for poor farmers in the dry areas of Africa.
