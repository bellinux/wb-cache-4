5|$|The {{following}} coal <b>seams</b> are recognised {{within the}} coalfield. They are listed stratigraphically i.e. uppermost/youngest first. Note {{that not all}} <b>seams</b> are continuous across the coalfield and that correlation of some <b>seams</b> from one basin to another is uncertain.|$|E
5|$|In coal <b>seams,</b> coal {{balls are}} {{completely}} surrounded by coal. They are often found randomly {{scattered throughout the}} seam in isolated groups, usually in {{the upper half of}} the seam. Their occurrence in coal <b>seams</b> can be either extremely sporadic or regular; many coal <b>seams</b> have been found to contain no coal balls, while others have been found to contain so many coal balls that miners avoid the area entirely.|$|E
5|$|For the 2017–18 season, {{the home}} kit {{consists}} of a blue shirt with white trim at the neck and white stripes down the side <b>seams,</b> white shorts with blue trim and blue stripes down the side <b>seams,</b> and blue socks with white trim at the turnover. The away kit reverses the colours of the home kit. The kits are supplied by Adidas and bear the logo of online bookmaker 888sport, the club's main sponsor.|$|E
50|$|By {{this time}} the shafts at Wheldale had six insets: Warren House <b>seam</b> at 183m, Haigh Moor <b>seam</b> at 258m, Flockton Thick <b>seam</b> at 346m, Middleton Little <b>seam</b> at 400m, Silkstone <b>seam</b> at 436m and Beeston <b>seam</b> at 516m.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the normal lockstitch, construction stitches include edgestitching, understitching, staystitching and topstitching. <b>Seam</b> types include the plain <b>seam,</b> zigzag <b>seam,</b> flat fell <b>seam,</b> French <b>seam,</b> and many others.|$|R
50|$|The FDA {{continues}} by {{detailing the}} requirements of double <b>seam</b> destructive testing:"The double <b>seam</b> teardown examination is a destructive test. Tools {{that are used to}} perform this test include a <b>seam</b> micrometer, countersink gauge can opener and nippers. Optional equipment for <b>seam</b> teardown examinations include a <b>seam</b> saw, <b>seam</b> projector and <b>seam</b> scope. Although it is not imperative the investigator carry this equipment to each LACF inspection, {{it is very important that}} they know how to operate this equipment and read measurements from the micrometer, <b>seam</b> projector or <b>seam</b> scope. It is also important that the investigator know how to determine the tightness or wrinkle rating of the cover hook. Knowledge of the procedures used to perform double <b>seam</b> teardown examination are essential to evaluating the firm's knowledge and ability to do this examination. Attachment 14 explains the procedure for using a <b>seam</b> projector for examining a cross section of the <b>seam.</b> Attachment 15 explains the can <b>seam</b> micrometer and procedure for use, and Attachment 16 explains the use of a seamscope for the same exam.|$|R
5|$|Wales {{has some}} {{potential}} for the onshore production of oil and gas. Shale gas may be obtained by fracking and there is methane in unmined coal <b>seams</b> that may be extractable. Another potential source of gas is the underground controlled combustion of coal <b>seams</b> to produce syngas, a mixture of hydrogen, methane and carbon monoxide.|$|E
5|$|Iron {{has been}} worked in Cleveland {{on a small}} scale since before Roman times. The Cleveland Ironstone Formation {{consists}} of <b>seams</b> of marine ironstone alternating with shale and siltstone, of Lower Jurassic age.|$|E
5|$|The complex geology {{and narrow}} <b>seams</b> made the coal {{extraction}} difficult; three underground explosions, in 1893, 1895 and 1908, were amongst the first attributable solely to airborne coal dust.|$|E
50|$|A plain <b>seam</b> is {{the most}} common type of machine-sewn <b>seam.</b> It joins two pieces of fabric {{together}} face-to-face by sewing through both pieces, leaving a <b>seam</b> allowance with raw edges inside the work. The <b>seam</b> allowance usually requires some sort of <b>seam</b> finish to prevent raveling.|$|R
50|$|When {{making an}} outward-curved <b>seam,</b> the {{material}} will have reduced bulk and lie flat if notches are {{cut into the}} <b>seam</b> allowance. Alternatively, when making an inward-curved <b>seam,</b> clips are cut into the <b>seam</b> allowance to help the <b>seam</b> lie flat with reduced bulk in the fabric.|$|R
5000|$|Coal <b>seam</b> gas {{composition}} - {{for a given}} coal <b>seam</b> gas content (in m3 per tonne), the <b>seam</b> {{will be much more}} susceptible to outbursts if the coal <b>seam</b> gas is predominantly carbon dioxide, as opposed to the case where the coal <b>seam</b> gas is predominantly methane.|$|R
5|$|As {{the area}} boomed {{following}} {{the discovery of the}} Comstock Lode, the Bowers claim proved to hold one of the richest <b>seams</b> of silver ore in what would become Nevada, and because their claim was close to the surface, it was easily extracted without initial capital investment. The Bowers Mining Company quickly made Eilley and Sandy very wealthy.|$|E
5|$|Bradford Colliery was a {{coal mine}} in Bradford, Manchester, England. Although {{part of the}} Manchester Coalfield, the <b>seams</b> of the Bradford Coalfield {{correspond}} more closely {{to those of the}} Oldham Coalfield. The Bradford Coalfield is crossed by a number of fault lines, principally the Bradford Fault, which was reactivated by mining activity in the mid-1960s.|$|E
5|$|Coal balls may {{be found}} in coal <b>seams</b> across North America and Eurasia. North American coal balls are more widespread, both stratigraphically and geologically, than those in Europe. The oldest known coal balls date from the Namurian stage of the Carboniferous; they were found in Germany and on the {{territory}} of former Czechoslovakia.|$|E
50|$|Once <b>seam</b> {{allowances}} are pinned or basted, {{they are}} often pressed flat with an iron before sewing the final <b>seam.</b> Pressing the <b>seam</b> allowances {{makes it easier to}} sew a consistent finished <b>seam.</b>|$|R
50|$|In a French <b>seam,</b> the {{raw edges}} of the fabric are fully {{enclosed}} for a neat finish. The <b>seam</b> is first sewn with wrong sides together, then the <b>seam</b> allowances are trimmed and pressed. A second <b>seam</b> is sewn with right sides together, enclosing the raw {{edges of the}} original <b>seam.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Sprung <b>seam</b> - A sprung <b>seam</b> is a {{condition}} where the <b>seam</b> is {{pulled away from the}} body wall. In extreme cases, the <b>seam</b> is pulled away from the body wall {{all the way around the}} can.|$|R
5|$|Coal {{has been}} mined around Worsley from {{as long ago}} as 1376, {{originally}} in bell pits. The coal <b>seams</b> in the area tend to be fairly thin, slanting downwards from north to south, and so deeper mining became necessary during the 17thcentury.|$|E
5|$|Coal {{measures}} {{occur on}} the western and the eastern fringes of the Peak District, and evidence of past workings can be found from Glossop down to The Roaches, and from Stocksbridge to Baslow. The Coal measures on the eastern fringes of the Peak District form the South Yorkshire Coalfield while the Coal measures on the western fringes form the Lancashire Coalfield. Mining started in medieval times and was at its most productive in the 18th and early 19th centuries, in some cases continuing into the early 20th century. The earliest mining took place at and close to outcrops and miners eventually followed the <b>seams</b> deeper underground as the beds dipped beneath hillsides. At Goyt's Moss and Axe Edge, deep <b>seams</b> were worked and steam engines raised the coal and dewatered the mines. Coal from the eastern mines was used in lead smelting, and coal from the western mines for lime burning.|$|E
5|$|The first {{scientific}} {{description of}} coal balls {{was made in}} 1855 by Sir Joseph Dalton Hooker and Edward William Binney, who reported on examples in the coal <b>seams</b> of Yorkshire and Lancashire, England. European scientists did much of the early research.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} types of copper domes, spires, and vaults, both with simple {{geometries}} or complex curved surfaces and multi-faceted designs. Examples include circular domes with diagonal flat <b>seam</b> systems, circular domes with standing <b>seam</b> systems, circular domes with flat <b>seam</b> systems, conical spires, flat <b>seam</b> roofing on octagonal spires, standing <b>seam</b> barrel vaults, and flat <b>seam</b> barrel vaults. Information about steps for dome panel layouts and specifications for copper constructions is available.|$|R

5|$|Army {{trousers}} were {{of similar}} pattern to the U.S. Army trousers, or civilian designs, {{depending on the}} area in which they were made. They were typically a shade of gray or brown, with a variety of medium blues also produced. The individual could also have them trimmed to reflect his militia unit, his Non-commissioned officer status, or as a personal flare, to the ubiquitous service pants. Noncommissioned officers were to wear on their outer <b>seams</b> a one and one-quarter inch cotton stripe or braid of colors appropriate to their army branch.|$|E
5|$|Coal {{balls in}} North America were first found in Iowa coal <b>seams</b> in 1894, {{although}} {{the connection to}} European coal balls was not made until Adolf Carl Noé (whose coal ball was found by Gilbert Cady) drew the parallel in 1922. Noé's work renewed interest in coal balls, and by the 1930s had drawn paleobotanists from Europe to the Illinois Basin in search of them.|$|E
5|$|Coatbridge {{also had}} a notorious {{reputation}} for air pollution and the worst excesses of industry. By {{the time of the}} 1920s however, coal <b>seams</b> were exhausted and the iron industry in Coatbridge was in rapid decline. After the Great Depression the Gartsherrie ironwork was the last remaining iron works in the town. One publication has commented that in modern-day Coatbridge 'coal, iron and steel have all been consigned to the heritage scrap heap'.|$|E
5000|$|Felled <b>seam,</b> or flat-fell <b>seam,</b> is a <b>seam</b> made {{by placing}} one edge inside a folded edge of fabric, then {{stitching}} the fold down. It includes a topstitched finish. It {{is useful for}} keeping <b>seam</b> allowances flat and covering raw edges.|$|R
50|$|Moorgarth Collieries SD699718The coal at Moorgath was shallow, heavily faulted {{and troubled}} by water. It {{was close to}} the railway. It worked Yard Coal and the Four Foot <b>seam</b> from 1828 until 1880. Some reports of a Nine Foot <b>seam</b> suggest that the heavy {{faulting}} had breached into the <b>seam</b> or there was localised thickening of the Six Foot <b>seam.</b> The 1870 Newfield shafts attempted to mine the Four Foot <b>seam</b> and Bottom Coal (the Six Foot <b>seam)</b> but were not profitable.|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, the {{consumption}} of coal has been increasing. Together with knowledge development, so the business competition in the mining, especially in coal would be also increase. This is caused the exploitation of coal field would be added again. But, before doing the exploitation process, {{we have to know}} the resources of coal in that area. The research area lie in the “X” area, Muara Wahau Regent Area, East of Kalimantan. Based on geology, this area lie in the north side of Kutai basin that consist of Tertiary sediment with Eosen until Mio Pliosen age. The research area, especially, lie in the Wahau Formation. This formation consists of interbedded of claystone,, quartz sandstone, clayey sandstone, and coal intercalations limestone at the bottom of formation. The age of this formation is between Late Oligocene until Early Miocene. The purpose of this final project research are to decide the coal layer of <b>seam</b> A, <b>seam</b> B, <b>seam</b> C, <b>seam</b> D and <b>seam</b> E based on each physic characteristic, to know the geology structure and coal sedimentation form in the research area, to know the direction of thickening and thinning of coal layer for each <b>seam</b> and to know the volume of coal resources of <b>seam</b> A, <b>seam</b> B, <b>seam</b> C, <b>seam</b> D and <b>seam</b> E that found in the research area. The research method of this final project research is secondary survey method and the analysis method are qualitative and quantitative methods. Qualitative method are consists of <b>seam</b> appointment analysis, making structure correlation section profile, making isopach map, making coal distribution map and calculating of <b>seam</b> thickness. Even though, quantitative method are consists of wide calculating step with grid method and volume calculating step with kerucut terpancung method or kerucut method and silinder method. Based on <b>seam</b> appointment analysis got to know that <b>seam</b> A, <b>seam</b> B, <b>seam</b> C, <b>seam</b> D and <b>seam</b> E can be decided based on equal of each <b>seam</b> physic characteristic which are coal layer thickness factor, roof and floor layer characteristic, log curve form characteristic, and parting characteristic which found in the coal layer. Based on structure correlation section profile got to know that geology structure that found in the research area is fold which are anticline and sincline and the coal sedimentation form is fold. Based on isopach map got to know the direction of thickening and thinning of coal layer and volume of coal resources for each <b>seam.</b> The <b>seam</b> thickness for coal resources calculating is clean coal thickness and start from coal which has thickness  1 m. Based on calculating result of isopach map got to know the volume of coal resources of <b>seam</b> A is 51. 195. 201 m 3, <b>seam</b> B is 226. 101, 18 m 3, <b>seam</b> C is 361. 123, 05 m 3, <b>seam</b> D is 360. 748, 25 m 3 dan <b>seam</b> E is 817. 466, 05 m 3. So, total volume of coal resources in the examination area is 3. 316. 633. 7 ton. ...|$|R
5|$|For {{hundreds}} of years mining was an important industry for the area, {{and there were a}} number of mines in Midsomer Norton, e.g. Old Mills, Norton Hill, and Welton. However the <b>seams</b> were thin and with the hilly nature around, not easily worked. Generations of miners who worked in the difficult conditions of the local collieries are remembered at the Radstock Museum. The coming of the railways, particularly the Bath extension of the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway (S) in 1874, transformed the conveyance of coal out of the area.|$|E
5|$|ILC did {{not produce}} apparel for adults until the {{introduction}} of the Living Girdle in 1940, after patenting a method of manufacturing latex girdles that would not tear at the <b>seams</b> if they had a small tear or hole. The Living Girdle was advertised with images of mobility and comfort, such as women playing tennis or leaping while wearing it, though the solid rubber girdle was actually very uncomfortable.|$|E
5|$|Next is the Menefee Formation, {{the middle}} {{formation}} whose content features interbedded carbonaceous shales, siltstones, and sandstones. These were deposited in semi-marine environments of brackish water, such as swamps and lagoons. Due to its depositional {{environment and the}} organic material in its composition, there are thin coal <b>seams</b> running through the Menefee Formation. At the top, this formation is intruded upon by the Cliff House Sandstone.|$|E
