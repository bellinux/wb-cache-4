40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effect of}} <b>systems</b> <b>to</b> manage environmental aspects on environmental performance at individual polluting facilities. Regulated polluting facilities are increasingly embracing pollution minimization strategies that involve the adoption of broadly defined <b>systems</b> <b>to</b> manage environmental aspects. Despite a meaningful empirical literature, {{whether or not these}} <b>systems</b> lead <b>to</b> better environmental performance remains an open question. This study seeks to assess the possible connection between <b>systems</b> <b>to</b> manage environmental aspects and improved environmental performance. It also seeks to identify the factors determining the extent of the adopted system of management and the factors’ direct effects on environmental performance. For this empirical analysis, the study examines the extent of <b>systems</b> <b>to</b> manage environmental aspects employed by and the level of wastewater discharged by U.

5|$|As {{the wind}} shear decreased, the {{convection}} increased further, and the IMD upgraded the <b>system</b> <b>to</b> a deep depression at 00:00UTC on June1.

An eye became evident during a Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) pass of the storm; its appearance {{and the development}} of rainbands showed Phet was intensifying. Late on June1, the JTWC upgraded the storm to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane, estimating 1minute maximum sustained winds of 120km/h (75mph), after the eye became better defined and the tightly-curved thunderstorm activity. The IMD upgraded Phet to severe cyclonic storm status at 00:00UTC on June2, and further to a very severe cyclonic storm six hours later.|$|E
