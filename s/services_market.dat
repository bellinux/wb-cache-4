40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to unlock {{positions}} regarding the goods/services dichotomy in <b>service</b> <b>marketing</b> and to offer an argument that treats goods and services on an ontologically equal basis. Design/methodology/approach – A close reading of influential texts that argue in favor of a service-dominant logic (SDL) and new paradigms in <b>service</b> <b>marketing.</b> Findings – Both the SDL proposal and calls for new service paradigms can be understood as ad hoc solutions that serve to reproduce and even strengthen the asymmetry between goods and services. A post-paradigmatic analysis opens up new possibilities for <b>service</b> <b>marketing</b> research and practice. Research limitations/implications – By showing how goods and services can be positioned equally, hitherto invisible sites of value creation become potential subjects for analyses in <b>service</b> <b>marketing.</b> Practical implications – <b>Service</b> <b>marketing</b> practices are situated so as to explain the value creating interactions between service providers and customers in a more transparent way than is usual.

2500|$|On December 1, 2008, Multiven {{filed an}} {{antitrust}} lawsuit against Cisco Systems, Inc. {{in an effort}} to open up the network maintenance services marketplace for Cisco equipment, promote competition and ensure consumer choice and value. Multiven's complaint alleges that Cisco harmed Multiven and consumers by bundling and tying bug fixes/patches and updates for its operating system software to its maintenance services (SMARTnet) and through a series of other illegal exclusionary and anticompetitive acts designed to maintain Cisco's alleged monopoly in the network maintenance <b>services</b> <b>market</b> for Cisco networking equipment. In May 2010, Cisco accused the person who filed the antitrust suit, British-Nigerian technology entrepreneur Peter Alfred-Adekeye, with hacking and pressured the US government to extradite him from Canada. Alfred-Adekeye was arrested while in the middle of testifying against Cisco in an anti-trust hearing. Although he was released after 28 days on bail, the case has stretched for a year, because the U.S. Attorney's office was unable to present the evidence required for the extradition. The antitrust lawsuit has been settled 2 months after Alfred-Adekeye's arrest. In May 2011, the US extradition request has been denied. Canadian Supreme Court Justice Ronald McKinnon, who oversaw the extradition hearing, commented on the arrest saying [...] "It is simply not done in a civilized jurisdiction that is bound by the rule of law". He also stated that the real reason for the extradition proceedings was because Alfred-Adekeye [...] "dared to take on a multinational giant." [...] Judge McKinnon has also condemned the US prosecutor for hiding the fact that Alfred-Adekeye was in legal proceedings against Cisco Systems, for stating that Alfred-Adekeye had left the USA in a time period when he had not and a formal request for extradition was not filed against Alfred-Adekeye when he was taken into custody. He described the information provided by Cisco and the US prosecutor as [...] "full of innuendo, half-truths and falsehoods," [...] adding that [...] "This speaks volumes for Cisco's duplicity" [...] and accused them of [...] "unmitigated gall" [...] in using such a heavy-handed move as an unsupportable arrest and jailing to pressure Alfred-Adekeye to drop or settle his civil antitrust complaint.|$|E
