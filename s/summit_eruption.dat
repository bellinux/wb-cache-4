In contrast, flank eruptions can occur down to a few hundred metres altitude, close to or even well within the inhabited areas. Numerous villages and small towns lie around or on cones of past flank eruptions. Since the year AD1600, at least 60 flank <b>eruptions</b> and countless <b>summit</b> <b>eruptions</b> have occurred; nearly half of these have happened {{since the start of the}} 20th century.

On the other hand, element concentrations of melt inclusions derived from the submarine eruption and the 1983 eruption suggest a common source having a supply signature of less-evolved magma into a differentiated magma. Among the three volcanic events, no significant difference in S concentration was observed. Sulfur concentrations in the melt inclusions vary more than 40 %, possibly reflecting pre-entrapment degassing during the ascent of magma from a deeper magma chamber to a shallower one.

SWS time delays before Eyjafjallajökull show characteristic variations {{similar to those}} seen before earthquakes. The time delays display a nearly linear increase before the eruption, an abrupt change of slope and a rapid nearly linear decrease until the flank eruption begins. Similar variations before earthquakes are interpreted as stress-accumulation increases, and stress-relaxation decreases as microcracks coalesce onto the eventual fault plane. The changes in SWS before Eyjafjallajökull are interpreted as a similar stress-accumulation increase, as magma penetrates the crust, and stress-relaxation decrease as microcracks coalesce onto the magma conduit prior to magma release. We suggest that the remarkable similarity between stress changes before eruption and earthquake is strong evidence for the New Geophysics of a critically microcracked crust...|$|R

40|$|Injection of basaltic magmas into silicic crustal holding {{chambers}} and subsequent magma mingling or mixing {{is a process}} that has been recognised since the late seventies as resulting in explosive eruptions. Detailed reconstruction and assessment of the mixing process caused by such intrusion is now possible because of the exceptional time-sequence sample suite available from the tephra fallout of the 2010 <b>summit</b> <b>eruption</b> at Eyjafjallajökull volcano in South Iceland. Fallout from 14 to 19 April contains three glass types of basaltic, intermediate, and silicic compositions recording rapid magma mingling without homogenisation, involving evolved FeTi-basalt and silicic melt with composition identical to that produced by the 1821 – 1823 AD Eyjafjallajökull <b>summit</b> <b>eruption.</b> The time-dependent change in the magma composition suggests a binary mixing process with changing end-member compositions and proportions. Beginning of May, a new injection of primitive basalt was recorded by deep seismicity, appearance of Mg-rich olivine phenocrysts together with high sulphur dioxide output and presence of sulphide crystals. Thus, the composition of the basaltic injection became more magnesian and hotter with time provoking changes in the silicic mixing end-member from pre-existing melt to the solid carapace of the magma chamber. Finally, decreasing proportions of the mafic end-member with time in the erupted mixed-magma demonstrate that injections of Mg-rich basalt was the motor of the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull explosive eruption, and that its decreasing inflow terminated the eruption. Significant quantity of silicic magma is thus still present in the interior of the volcano. Our results show that detailed sampling during the entire eruption was essential for deciphering the complex magmatic processes at play, i. e. the dynamics of the magma mingling and mixing. Finally, the rapid compositional changes in the eruptive products suggest that magma mingling occurs on a timescale of a few hours to days whereas the interval between the first detected magma injection and eruption was several months...|$|E

The precursor of the <b>summit</b> <b>eruption</b> was observed by the tiltmeter and the extenso-meter for 125 explosions, which corresponds to about 60 % of the events, including minor ex-plosions, {{during the period of}} the observation from August 1985 to January 1986. Upwardtilt in the radial direction to the summit crater ranged from 10 minutes to 7 hours in dura-tion and from 0. 01 to 0. 2 microradians in amount. The extension in the tangential directionand the extension or minor contraction in the radial direction ranged from 10 8 to 10 7 instrain. After the eruption, the downward tilt in the radial direction and the contraction inevery direction were observed. The depth of the origin which generates the inflation of thesummit is estimated to be from 2 to 6 kilometers beneath the active crater by comparing theobserved ratio of the dilatation to the tilt (from 0 to 1. 4) with the theoretical value calculat-ed according to Mogi's model. Ground tilt data in the radial component were continuously monitored and processed inreal time by a computer in order to judge the stage of the eruptive activity from the rate oftilt change and tilt duration and to forecast the explosive eruption automatically. The prac-tice of the preliminary program has been done for a month. The statistical results of the ex-periment indicate that the number of critical stage of activity judged from tilt data is 27 outof 39 explosions, 4 out of 5 short eruptions, and 7 out of 22 continuous eruptions.

The apparent volume ratio of aphyric versus porphyritic lavas is approximately 1 : 1 in the drilling core samples of the Older Oshima Group (Fujii et al. 1996). During the post-caldera stage (the Younger Oshima Group), porphyritic lavas with accumulated plagioclase phenocrysts erupted at the early stage of each <b>summit</b> <b>eruption</b> and were followed by eruptions of aphyric lavas (Nakano and Yamamoto 1991). These observations suggest that plagioclase accumulated by floating in the basaltic melt during the dormant stage, {{which resulted in the}} formation of a porphyritic magma layer in {{the upper part of the}} magma chamber and its emission at the onset of each eruption (Aramaki and Fujii 1988).|$|E

40|$|Many {{volcanic}} edifices have {{a remarkably}} symmetric geometrical form. An example is Mount Fuji in Japan. We model this form {{assuming that the}} surface of the volcano is a surface of uniform hydraulic potential; that an erupting magma will follow the path of minimum resistance to the surface. In order to model the resistance to fluid flow we assume the volcanic edifice is a uniform porous medium. The vertical flow of magma is also resisted by the gravitational body force. If the volcano becomes too tall flank eruptions will widen it; if the volcano becomes too wide <b>summit</b> <b>eruptions</b> will increase its elevation. Using the Dupuit approximation for an unconfined aquifer it is shown that the percolation equation is applicable. As magma reaches the surface it is assumed to extend the solid, porous matrix. A similarity solution is obtained to this moving boundary problem. The solution predicts a uniform shape for all volcanoes. This shape is shown to be in excellent agreement with the geometrical form of Mount Fuji. © 1981...|$|R

The paroxysmal episode at Mount Etna on 12 – 13 January 2011 produced in ∼ 4 hours lava fountains and fast‐moving lava flows 4. 3 km long. We produced timely predictions of the areas likely to be inundated by lava flows while the eruption was still ongoing. We employed infrared satellite data (MODIS, AVHRR, SEVIRI) to estimate in near‐realtime lava eruption rates (peak value of 60 m 3 s− 1). These time‐varying discharge rates were then used to drive MAGFLOW simulations to chart the spread of lava {{as a function of}} time.

40|$|Volcanoes deform as a {{consequence}} of the rise and storage of magma; once magma reaches a critical pressure, an eruption occurs. However, how the edifice deformation relates to its eruptive behavior is poorly known. Here, we produce a joint interpretation of spaceborne InSAR deformation measurements and volcanic activity at Mt. Etna (Italy), between 1992 - 2006. We distinguish two volcano-tectonic behaviors. Between 1993 - 2000, Etna inflated with a starting deformation rate of ~ 1 cm yr- 1 that progressively reduced with time, nearly vanishing between 1998 - 2000; moreover, low-eruptive rate <b>summit</b> <b>eruptions</b> occurred, punctuated by lava fountains. Between 2001 - 2005, Etna deflated, feeding higher-eruptive rate flank eruptions, along with large displacements of the entire East-flank. These two behaviors, we suggest, result from the higher rate of magma stored between 1993 -June 2001, which triggered the emplacement of the dike responsible for the 2001 and 2002 - 2003 eruptions. Our results clearly show that the joint interpretation of volcano deformation and stored magma rates may be crucial in identifying impending volcanic eruptions...|$|R
