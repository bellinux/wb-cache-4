40|$|In Egypt, {{concerns}} about bridge pier scour {{is one of}} the important reasons for limiting the increase of the current flow releases from High Aswan Dam (HAD) above the current maximum of 270 Million m 3 /day. Higher flows might induce general scour at a bridge section if the bridge section is located in a <b>scouring</b> <b>reach.</b> In order to release higher flows than the current maximum, knowledge is required about how much total scour is expected around bridges built across the Nile River. Due to the importance of bridge pier scour, many investigators have worked on this critical subject but most of them have built their analysis on laboratory flume data that suffer from having simplified conditions and scale effects. When applying the existing empirical equations for predicting bridge pier scour to field cases, the scour depths are overpredicted which means increased construction costs. A new analytical equation for predicting pier scour is developed, Hafez 2004 a, which are based on an energy balance theory. The developed equation expresses equilibrium bridge pier scour depth in terms of flow velocity, flow depth, bed sediment specific gravity, porosity and angle o...|$|E

This study determined the approximate optimum dimensions for rectangular collars to minimize the temporal trend of scouring around a pier model. Effects of different sizes of rectangular collars on a model pier were investigated both at the upstream and downstream of the flume. It was observed that irrespective of the rectangular collar dimensions the upstream and the downstream were estimated to be 0. 86 and 1. 42, respectively.

40|$|Bridge scour is {{the removal}} of {{sediment}} around bridge foundations and can result in {{the failure of the}} bridge. Scour monitoring is performed to identify unacceptable scour on bridges considered to be scour critical and determine when <b>scour</b> <b>reaches</b> elevations that could cause potential bridge failure. Two types of monitoring are available: portable monitoring and fixed monitoring. Prior to this project, MnDOT was only using portable monitoring devices, which requires the deployment of personnel to make physical measurements of scour depths. For some scour critical bridges, especially during high-water events, fixed instrumentation capable of continuous scour monitoring was preferred, but MnDOT lacked the experience or expertise to install this type of equipment. This project installed fixed monitoring equipment at two bridge sites and monitored them for three years to determine the effectiveness and reliability of fixed scour monitoring deployments. Several device options were installed to allow MnDOT to analyze the installation and performance of different types of sensors. Both systems operated for the three years with some outages due to various causes but overall performance was acceptable. The outages were mostly related to power issues and communication issues. Valuable lessons were learned through the deployment, which may be applied to future installations. The deployment executed in this project has provided the confidence to deploy other fixed scour monitoring equipment at key bridges around the state of Minnesota. In addition, the data collected during deployment of the scour monitoring equipment has been stored and provides insight into scour processes. This data can be used by other research groups for design or research purposes. Minnesota Department of Transportation Research Services & Librar...|$|R

A simple approach combining scour chains, stratigraphy and frequent bathymetric surveys is proposed to connect the dynamics of free migrating alternate bars present in disconnected channels of large sandy-gravelly rivers with their sedimentary products and vice versa. The results show that the spatial distribution of bars before a flood partly governs the scour and fill processes and that the sediment transport rates vary significantly on a single cross-section. This can be due to preferential axes of the migration of the bars determined by their location on the crosssection, the bank direction and the discharge. The approach allows the reconstruction of local sedimentary processes involved in alternate bar migration by combining maximum <b>scour</b> depths <b>reached</b> during a flood with frequent channel bed topography surveys and post-flood stratigraphy.

40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} {{numerical model}} (PHOENICS) {{was used to}} investigate the role of stream deflector angle and length on the flow field in a rectangular laboratory flume. Subsequent bed topography surveys were performed to examine the role of obstruction angle on scour hole development over time. The model was capable of predicting laboratory velocity and turbulent kinetic energy measurements, performing better for flow over a flat stable bed than over a deformed sand bed. A new method of incorporating complex bed topography into a structured Cartesian mesh {{was developed in the}} process. Flow field properties such as dynamic pressure, velocity amplification, separation zone length and width, and downwelling extent and magnitude were found to be strongly dependent on deflector geometry. Equilibrium scour hole depths and geometry are also angle-dependent.

Aim of this work is to analyze the hydrodynamic, stability and morphodynamic response of a GSC submerged reef by means of an experimental campaign. The first investigated aspect concerned the hydrodynamics. The reflection and transmission coefficients for regular and random waves were determined: the reflection coefficient decreases with increasing of kh; the transmission coefficient decreases with the increase of the incident wave. As regards the stability of the structure, it was observed that the strongest waves were able to lift the row of GSC more exposed to the wave action. An instability curve for the GSC as a function of the hydrodynamic characteristics was then found. Flow visualization close to the reef was performed by means of ink, showing that the flow becomes asymmetric in the proximity of the structure.

40|$|The flood {{damage of}} {{engineering}} structures in rivers because of scour near pumping stations, bridge structures – abutments, guide banks, dams, etc. leads to considerable environmental and economical losses. The reason of scour is multiple floods and therefore scour hole parameters near structures under clear-water conditions are summed up and increase from flood to flood. When depth of <b>scour</b> hole <b>reaches</b> critical value for foundations, structure usually is destroyed. To estimate the engineering structures safety and stability the flood damage risk assessment {{should be performed}} and in necessary cases protection measures {{should be used to}} prevent engineering structures from failure. A method for flood damage risk assessment at abutments is presented. We propose to calculate flood damage risk factor using two scour calculation methods: calculation method of scour development at abutments during the multiple floods and calculation method of equilibrium depth of scour at abutments. The theoretical analysis of the equilibrium depth of scour calculation method is made. The flood damage risk factor of abutment can be calculated as a ratio between hs, the scour depth during/after the multiple floods of certain probability, and hequil., the equilibrium depth of scour hole at the abutments of the same probability. For critical conditions, when the developed scour hole is close to the equilibrium conditions, emergency protection measures should be taken and such bridge construction should be included into flood damage risk map...|$|R

This study focuses on the modeling and observation influence debris flow on bridge piers with three (3) conditions: unprotected bridge piers, using gabion protection, and bored pile protection on the model. By using a discharge of 1. 54 liters/sec on a scale model of the maximum scours depth is obtained that occurred on bridge piers unprotected condition, that is equal to 1. 7 cm and the minimum scours occurs in conditions of safety piers the bored pile is equal to 1. 48 cm.

40|$|Many {{large scale}} tidal current {{turbines}} (TCTs) {{have been tested}} and deployed around the world. It is foreseeable that tidal current will be a vital natural resource in future energy supplies. The wake generated from the TCT amplifies the scour process around the support structure. It causes sediment transport at the seabed and it may result in severe environmental impacts. The study aims to investigate the generated wake {{and its effects on}} the scour process around the support structure of the TCT. An analytical wake model is proposed to predict the initial velocity and its lateral distribution downstream of the TCT. The analytical wake model consists of several equations derived from the theoretical works of ship propeller jets. Axial momentum theory is used to predict the minimum velocity at the immediate plane of the wake and followed by recovery equation to determine the minimum velocity at lateral sections along the downstream of the wake. Gaussian distribution is applied to predict the lateral velocity distribution in a wake. The proposed model is also able to predict wake structure under various ambient turbulence conditions (TI= 3 %, 5 %, 8 % and 15 %). The proposed wake model is validated by comparing the results with well-accepted experimental measurements. Goodness-of-fit analysis has been conducted by using the estimator of R-square (R 2) and Mean Square Error (MSE). The R 2 and MSE are in the range of 0. 1684 – 0. 9305 and 0. 004 – 0. 0331, respectively. A TCT model was incorporated in OpenFOAM to simulate the flow between rotor and seabed {{due to the fact that}} the flow is responsible for the sediment transport. The axial component of velocity is the dominating velocity of the flow below the TCT. The maximum axial velocity under the turbine blades is around 1. 07 times of the initial incoming flow. The maximum radial and tangential velocity components of the investigated layer are approximately 4. 12 % and 0. 22 % of the maximum axial velocity. The acceleration of flow under the rotor changes seabed boundary layer profile. The geometry of the turbine also affects the flow condition. Results showed that the velocity increases with the number of blades. Both the axial and radial velocities were significantly influenced by the number of blades, the tangential velocity was found to be insignificant. A physical model of TCT is placed in a hydraulic flume for scour test. The scour rate of the fabricated model was investigated. The decrease of tip clearance increases the scour depth. The shortest tip clearance results in the fastest and most sediment transport. The maximum <b>scour</b> depth <b>reached</b> approximately 18. 5 % of rotor diameter. Experimental results indicated that regions susceptible to scour typically persist up to 1. 0 Dt downstream and up to 0. 5 Dt to either side of the turbine support centre.

The erosion status prior to the maximum scour depth was recorded by a pinhole camera, and, in general, the equilibrium <b>scour</b> depth was <b>reached</b> after 24 hours.

40|$|After {{the annual}} {{maintenance}} period {{and during the}} refilling of the canal downstream of a regulator the tail water depth of this canal is small and not sufficient to produce a hydraulic jump inside the solid apron. This results in a severe local scour problem for the canal bed. A traditional solution of this problem is to place crushed rock in the scour hole to prevent further scour; however, this method has not {{proved to be a}} permanent solution. To investigate this local scour problem a physical model for a one vent regulator was constructed and a non-uniform granular material was used to simulate the canal bed. This experimental studies revealed that there are five distinct flow regimes in the region of the scour hole, namely: (1) a jet attached to the bed, (2) breaking wave and adverse hydraulic jump, (3) a travelling hydraulic jump, (4) wave jump and diving jet, and (5) surface jet with entrainment from below. The initial tests produced an asymmetrical scour hole; however, a midstream flow divider or vane, made the scour hole more symmetrical. Two depressions were observed inside most of the symmetrical scour holes. It was found that the scour hole that forms immediately after the apron, which {{is referred to as the}} short-term <b>scour,</b> <b>reaches</b> an equilibrium depth within a few minutes of the start of flow while the scour hole formed farther from the apron (long-term scour) continues to increase, at a decreasing rate for several days. The short-term scour in a rectangular channel is caused mainly by the attached jet while the short-term scour in a trapezoidal channel is produced by the jet attachment and the drilling effect of the vertical vortices caused by the sudden enlargement at the end of the control structure. The short-term scour in a rectangular channel is found to be a function of the initial Froude number, the initial jet depth and the particle size. The long-term scour depth is caused by the wave jet or diving jet as well as the surface jet; the scour depth was found to be a function of time, densimetric Froude number, initial jet depth and particle size. The changes in the surficial size distribution and settling velocity were determined for short-term and long-term scour at various locations within and downstream of the scour hole. The Gumbel distribution yields a good fit to both fall diameter and mass based equivalent diameter particle frequency distribution. As the scour hole develops, the D 50 decreases as does the ratio D 90 /D 10. An unsteady state short-term scour model was developed to predict the scour hole pattern and duration of phase 1 (attached jet). This model verified the rapid development of the short-term scour depth and reflected the observed effects of head, flow, and grain size. A steady state short-term scour model was developed to predict the scour hole dimensions immediately downstream of the apron. This model confirmed that the short-term scour depth is mainly a function of the initial Froude number, and initial jet depth, although it was found to be weakly dependent on the particle size. A theoretical consideration for the maximum long-term scour depth supports the concept that this depth is dependent on the densimetric Froude number, the jet expansion characteristics and the Shields constant.

40|$|Confluences {{are basic}} {{building}} blocks in river networks at all scales. When two rivers merge at a confluence, rapid changes in fluid velocity and turbulence intensity cause {{changes in the}} bed geometry. Usually, a deep scour hole and a depositional point bar are present at the confluence. One important phenomenon that has been overlooked in previous studies is the progressive penetration of the scour hole into the tributary channel. This progressive penetration may jeopardize the structural safety of the lateral channel in {{the proximity of the}} main channel. In this study, dimensional analysis techniques are used to develop a general equation for the prediction of maximum scour hole penetration (P sc) into the tributary. Eventhough, the penetration of the scour hole into the lateral channel is a time-dependent process, in developing the formula the maximum value after the equilibrium condition has been achieved is used. A series of 73 experimental tests with different confluence angle (θ), lateral to downstream channel discharge ratio (Q r), lateral to main channel width ratio (B r) and downstream densimetric Froude number (F g) in an asymmetrical confluence has been conducted to test the proposed formulation. The results show that P sc increases with Q r, θ and F g and decreases with B r. The degree of penetration defines two types of scour holes: In the first type the scour hole penetration only reaches the toe of the lateral channel wall closer to the downstream junction corner whereas in the second type the <b>scour</b> hole <b>reaches</b> both lateral channel walls. The second type is associated with higher values of Q r, ? and F g and lower values of B r. Statistical analysis showed that the mean error of the developed formula is of the order of 24 %...|$|R

40|$|Scouring is {{the process}} of soil or {{sediment}} erosion due to flowing water, which can lead to bed degradation and compromised transportation infrastructure. In the decade before 2000, over half of the 500 bridge failures in the United States were caused by flooding or scouring. To gain a better grasp of the effects of extreme weather events, such as Tropical Storm Irene, on the scouring process, this work is focused on a first principle understanding of the mechanism(s) of scour. The field of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is particu larly well suited to this task. Utilizing a Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) code, the repeated impacts of a vortex dipole on a particle bed are simulated. The resulting scour characteristics and flow dynamics are investigated {{as a function of the}} Shields number. The vortex dipole propagates perpendicularly to the particle bed, resulting in the scouring of the bed and dissipation of the dipole. After completion of the scour event, the simulation is repeated four more times, where subsequent simulations use the scoured bed from the previous simulation as the initial bed form. This simulation series is conducted over a Shields number parameter space. The fluid phase is treated as a continuum and the discretized Navier-Stokes equations are solved down to the smallest scales of the flow on an Eulerian grid. The particles comprising the bed are represented by the Discrete Particle Model (DPM), whereby each individual particle is tracked in a Lagrangian framework. Particle-particle and particle-wall collisions are calculated using a soft-sphere model. The fluid phase and the solid phase are coupled through a forcing term in the fluid conservation of momentum equation, and a drag force in the particle equation of motion, governed by Newton 2 ̆ 7 s Second Law. Above the critical Shields number, the scour hole topography is not fundamentally altered with subsequent impacts until the scale of the <b>scour</b> hole <b>reaches</b> a critical value. At which point, the shape and scale of the scour hole significantly alters the behavior of the vortex dipole and results in strongly asymmetric scour topographies.

Since {{the construction of the}} Snowy Mountains Scheme, river flows have not been sufficient to maintain the river channel. A program of environmental flow releases (EFR) is returning water to the river to restore the fluvial reaches and is now trialling flow regimes that may also benefit the estuarine reaches. This paper documents the response of the estuarine segments of the Snowy River to two EFRs; the release in 2010 was designed to <b>scour</b> the upper <b>reaches</b> of the Snowy River while the larger 2011 release was intended to extend the scouring downstream. For each release, the effects on the entrance morphology, tides and salinity through the flow peak and recovery are described. Each EFR caused minor increases in depth and very minor longshore movement of the entrance channel, although each EFR had been preceded by a larger fresh flow that would have scoured the channels. The small increase in fresh water inflow in the 2010 EFR pushed salinity contours seawards and steepened vertical salinity gradients. The larger inflow in the 2011 EFR purged the upper estuary of saltwater. After the peak flow, salinity recovery was rapid in the principal estuarine channels but took weeks where poorly connected wetlands could store fresh flood waters. Critical flows for scouring the entrance and purging salinity are estimated...|$|R

The MATS zones measured 0. 002 m² in the bedrock reach (37 % of transient storage) and 0. 291 m² in the alluvial reach (100 % of transient storage). The effective rate coefficient of Raz transformation in the MATS of the bedrock reach was approximately 16 times that of the alluvial reach. However, when we take into account the contribution of the MATS zone to overall metabolic activity, Raz transformation in the MATS zone was 2. 2 times slower in the bedrock reach than in the alluvial reach. The difference was similar to the difference in ecosystem respiration, which was 1. 8 times lower in the bedrock reach than in the alluvial reach, suggesting that the MATS zones were important contributors to ecosystem respiration. Results indicate that the quantification of MATS can improve our understanding of the role that transient storage zones play on stream metabolic processes and demonstrate the utility of Raz as a “smart” tracer that provides new information on metabolic activity at a whole-reach and at smaller scale...|$|R

In the present paper, an experimental analysis is conducted {{focusing on a}} particular structure typology: rock arched sills. This type of structure is similar to linear rock sills, but they are shaped {{in such a way}} that they can more properly orientate the flow. The analysis of this structure typology is conducted in a dedicated flume. The laboratory flume is characterized by four different curved branches. One uniform channel bed material is used to simulate the mobile bed and experimental tests are carried out up to when the equilibrium <b>scour</b> configuration is <b>reached.</b> Experiments are conducted for different flow discharges and tail water levels. Furthermore, different sills are tested, i. e., the height of the sill from the original bed level is varied. In addition, the transversal location of sills is also varied. Namely, sills are located in different spatial positions and in succession in the same curve, in order to test the mutual interference on the scour process. When the equilibrium scour condition is achieved, the channel bed morphology is carefully surveyed. The analysis of the experimental evidences allow to establish that different scour typologies take place. In addition, it is experimentally proven that the maximum scour depth, such as the scour hole length, are significantly affected by the channel curvature. Experimental results are elaborated and empirical relationships are furnished in order to estimate the maximum scour lengths. This paper could be useful for a correct design of this structure typology. Nevertheless, further experimental tests are required in order to optimize the location of such structures and to better understand the physics of the scour mechanism in a larger range of both hydraulic parameters and geometric configurations...|$|R

As {{reported}} in the 1999 Conference Proceedings (Bourne and Mikalsen, 1999), a field study was initiated in 1996 to evaluate the response of a segment of Proctor Creek in Cobb County {{to the impact of}} rapid urbanization in the watershed over time and in comparison to a segment of a physically comparable but almost fully developed urban watershed. The objectives of the study are to measure and evaluate long-term changes in channel cross-sections, bank and channel scouring, streambed composition, longitudinal reach profiles, plan-form dimensions, biological habitats and communities, water chemistry, and land cover to determine the timing and response of the stream to urbanization within the watershed and compare them with corresponding measurements of the developed urban watershed. These interim results describe measured and observed changes in the Proctor Creek study reach. Since the onset of physical observations in 1996, when increased sedimentation was the only evident indication of increased upstream development in the study reach, there has been a decline in the diversity of the macroinvertebrate community, enlargement of channel cross-sections and extensive bank undercutting and cantilever failure in the lower portion of the <b>reach,</b> <b>scouring</b> and undercutting of an outside bank and downstream migration of a cobble deposit in the middle section, and scouring of root-armored banks in the upper portion of the reach, and extensive silt and sediment deposition over the entire reach.

40|$|The {{safety of}} {{a large part of}} the Netherlands depends on sea dikes. Due to climate change, a sea level rise is predicted. Together with {{stronger}} storms and more wave attack, wave overtopping on the current dikes will increase. As a response, crest levels of the dikes need to be raised in order to meet the present regulations for wave overtopping. Alternatively, these regulations could be lowered if the dikes can be proven strong enough to cope with the increased loads. The SBW ('Sterkte & Belastingen Waterkeringen' or 'Strength and Loads on Water Defences') project with respect to grassed inner slopes focuses on the improvement of reliable overtopping criteria for the present dike structures. Experiments are carried out using a wave overtopping simulator. This device is developed to create full scale overtopping conditions on a inner slope. Experiments show initiation of erosion of the grass layer downstream of the transition of the slope and a horizontal part. The focus of the present research is modelling of the erosion process at a transition. The erosion process is described by two different models. The Transition Model (TM) is derived to describe the development of the scour hole due to the impinging forces of the overtopping wave tongue, known as surface erosion; The SSEA (Sites Spillway Erosion Analysis) model is taken to describe the headcut erosion process which occurs after the <b>scour</b> hole has <b>reached</b> a certain depth. The TM is based on a oblique impinging jet and a depth variable strength profile, in where near the surface the root system dominates, whereas with increasing depths cohesion and internal friction of the clay dominates. Since irregularities, found at the real dikes, are not taken over in the model discrepancies between model and experimental results occurred. According to the defined erosion model, the present guidelines are stern and the actual strength of a grassed inner slope is underrated. The work is done in cooperation with Deltares.

40|$|Scour is an {{important}} issue due to the potential great extent of loss and risks associated with scouring. The work described herein constitutes laboratory testing of the time development of scour holes in clayey soils produced by a submerged vertical circular impinging jet. Long term laboratory tests were performed on three types of manufactured pottery clays, Buffstone clay (50. 3 - 51. 7 % clay), P 300 clay (48. 7 - 50. 7 % clay), and M 370 clay (51. 1 - 51. 3 % clay). Detailed measurements of the entire scour hole were performed on a 2 mm grid using a computer controlled laser optical profiler after scouring times of 5 min, 10 min, 15 min, 20 min, 30 min, 40 min, 50 min, 1 h, 1. 5 h, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h, 16 h, 24 and then at every 24 h interval until the scour hole was considered to have reached equilibrium based on the criterion used by Mazurek et al. (2001). This resulted in long test durations ranging from 120 h to 384 h. For the time development of the scour hole, a three-dimensional scour hole surface was produced using the data taken by an optical profiler. Thereafter, four cross sections of the scour hole were extracted from the three-dimensional scour hole surface. Dimensions considered for analysis were taken from both the three-dimensional scour hole surface and the cross sections of the scour hole. The volume of the scour hole, and the centreline and maximum scour hole depths were extracted from the scour hole surface. The section-wise maximum scour depth, radius of the scour hole, half-width about the jet centreline, and half-width about the section-wise maximum scour depth were extracted for each cross-sections. The growth of these dimensions were observed with time. For a significant portion of scouring, the centreline and maximum scour hole depths increased linearly with the logarithm of time. For the majority of the tests, the half-widths decreased with time. Temporary ceasing of the increment of the centreline and maximum scour hole depths was observed, called “plateaus”, in the time development plot. Scour hole dimensions for the cross-sections showed variability from the average scour hole dimensions. However, for most of the tests this variability decreased with time as the scour test proceeded. To decide on whether the equilibrium state of the scour hole was achieved, all of the aforementioned scour hole dimensions were evaluated. The characteristic scour hole dimension to decide on the equilibrium condition was termed as the “critical equilibrium dimension”. Four of the <b>scour</b> tests <b>reached</b> an overall equilibrium state, the section wise maximum scour hole depth was the critical equilibrium dimension for three of those. The half-widths were the critical equilibrium dimension for one of the tests. However, previous studies did not consider the “side slope erosion” of the scour hole, hence neglected the section-wise maximum scour depth and half widths for identifying equilibrium condition. Dimensionless scour hole profiles were developed using the centreline scour depth as the scale for scour hole depth and the half-width about the centreline depth as the scale for radial distance from the jet centreline. A general equation of the dimensionless equilibrium scour hole profile was developed by fitting a sine function to the equilibrium scour test profiles using linear regression analysis. Dimensionless scour hole profiles with time during the scour test were compared to the dimensionless profile at equilibrium. It was observed that while for some scour tests the equilibrium scour hole shape formed quickly compared to the time to equilibrium, for some scour tests the equilibrium shapes did not form until the scour hole stopped growing...|$|R

S. A. Fourteen 100 m study reaches in 3 streams were selected to compare channel and hydraulic characteristics in streams representing a time series of recovery since major torrent scour or deposition (2, 12 and 120 years). Transient storage ("dead zone") volume fractions, ranging from 0. 3 to 0. 6 in the study reaches, were significantly (p <. 01) correlated with aggregate residual poo 1 volume (r = + 0. 94) and the standard deviation of thalweg depth (r = + 0. 95). Darcy-Weisbach friction factors (f) ranging from 2 to 90 were correlated (r values from + 0. 95 to + 0. 98) with the standard deviation of thalweg depth (SDD) within restricted ranges of summer low flow and elevated springtime discharge. Regressions of f versus SDD for combined data collected over a range of discharges (0. 019 to 0. 11 m³/s) showed increased scatter. A semi-logarithmic relationship (r² = 0. 60, n = 40) between dimensionless velocity (8 /f) ⁰·⁵ and a dimensionless measure indexing relative submergence of large scale bed features (mean thalweg depth/SDD) was significant at p <. 01. Measures and indices of pool volume and transient storage were positively correlated (r = + 0. 78 to + 0. 89) with volumetric loadings of woody debris. High total pool and dead zone volumes in reaches were largely due to plunge pools formed by scouring downstream of woody debris accumulations. Among the study streams, the greatest reach pool volume and channel complexity occurred in torrent deposit reaches of the intermediate (12 yr.) recovery stage stream. <b>Reaches</b> <b>scoured</b> recently (2 yr.) by a debris torrent had the lowest pool volume and channel complexity. The stream experiencing the longest period of "recovery" (120 yr) had characteristics between those of the 2 - and 12 -year recovery streams. Torrent scouring reduced pool volume, dead zone fraction and channel morphometric variability. Torrent deposition and subsequent local reworking of sediments by the stream increased values of these variables, especially when torrent deposits contained woody debris and boulders. The relative importance of pool-forming agents varied with recovery time and amount of torrent deposits. Bedrock, cobbles, log clusters, and single logs contributed about equally to the small residual pool volume in <b>reaches</b> recently <b>scoured</b> by a torrent. Log clusters and boulders dominated in two reaches of the intermediate recovery class stream where logs and sediment were deposited by a torrent, and in two reaches where boulders were left as lag deposits.

40|$|The {{prevention}} {{and control of}} bridge scour is a challenging element in bridge-pier foundation design. Sediment scour from around the piers has been a main cause of all bridge failures. For the cost-effective and reliable design of pier foundations, one needs accurate prediction of flow-inducing scour. Such prediction {{can be obtained from}} numerical modelling, as a good extension of experimental results. General CFD software packages are incapable to simulate sediment transport (bedload) and bed-level change (scour/deposition). Some numerical models have been developed for bedload and scour simulations, but there are two major limitations: (1) the bed sediments are assumed to have uniform grain size which is not true in natural river channels; (2) the modelling techniques are not computationally efficient for applications at the field scale. Thus, new modelling techniques for scour prediction are needed. The objectives of this research are: (1) to modify an existing shallow-water hydrodynamics model to allow for non-hydrostatic pressure corrections; (2) to improve the prediction of bed shear stress, a key parameter for bedload prediction; (3) to incorporate a new module for calculating bedload of mixed sediment-grain sizes; (4) to verify the model’s prediction with existing experimental data. For pressure corrections, a seven-diagonal linear system is added to the model, which is symmetric and positively defined. This system is numerically solved for non-hydrostatic pressure through preconditioned conjugate gradient iterations. Then, corrections to velocity and water surface elevation due to non-hydrostatic pressure are obtained. Fractional bedload calculations are based on a surface-based transport function, which depends on a particle-hiding factor, bed shear stress, and grain size distribution. Bed level change caused by bedload is calculated using the Exner equation added to the model. The new model successfully predicts 3 -D velocities around a circular pier in a fixed scour-hole and scour development on a mobile bed with uniform and non-uniform sediments. We improve bed shear stress prediction by using near-bottom velocities, as opposed to the widely used bottom-layer velocity, in the wall function method. Velocity and scour depth predictions agree well with experimental data. We show that scour emerges from the lateral sides of a pier, and scour patterns move toward its upstream nose. On the upstream side, relative to the pier’s centre, scour depth increases until the bed slope reaches the angle of repose of sediments. On the downstream side, scour continues until equilibrium is <b>reached.</b> <b>Scour</b> is deeper on the upstream than downstream side. Non-uniformity in grain sizes tends to reduce the magnitude of scour. The presence of the pier causes a strong vortex at its foot on the upstream side, which effectively moves sediments toward downstream. On the upstream side, the scour-hole’s outer shape is almost half a cone, true for both uniform and non-uniform sediments. These findings have implications to foundation design. The modelling techniques presented in this study are computationally efficient and are practical for applications at the field scale, which have been difficult so far...|$|R
40|$|Accurately calculating {{bed load}} {{transport}} rate {{has been a}} challenge in hydraulic engineering for decades. Bed load transport depends on the interaction between flow and sediment particles. Analyzing the characteristic of sediment particles motion and determining the velocity of sediment particles on a river bed is essential to quantify the transport rate. Therefore, this dissertation reports on the methods and results of a three-phased investigation to analyze the bed-load transport at the grain scale. The first research phase focused on the experimental study of bed-load transport using particle motion tracking. A series of experiments were conducted in a flume to study bed-load transport. The motion of bed-load particles was captured {{by a series of}} images taken by a high-speed camera. A novel particle motion tracking method was developed to automatically detect all the moving particles and calculate the instantaneous particle velocities. The instantaneous bed load transport rate was calculated based on particle velocity and the volume of moving particles. To verify this method, bed load transport rate based on the image processing technique was compared to the manually measured ones as well as data from other experiments. Results showed that the new technique made it possible to quantify the spatial and temporal variations of bed load transport rate at the individual particle scale. The second research study focused on the theoretical study of bed load particle velocity and its distribution. A theoretical equation was derived for calculating the particle velocity and distribution at the equilibrium transport state. It was found the mean particle velocity is a function of average bed shear stress, and the instantaneous velocity of a bed load particle is dependent on the instantaneous bed-shear stress. The PDFs of particle velocity and bed shear stress both vary with the turbulence intensity. Results showed that the newly derived theoretical equation accurately predicted the average particle velocity. The PDF of particle velocity is a log-normal function at high Reynolds number, while it is close to an exponential distribution at low Reynolds number. The third research study focused on the numerical investigation of bed-load transport at the grain scale. In detail, this study was carried out mainly on sediment transport around a bridge pier. Bridge scour is commonly calculated based on the steady flow assumption. In practice, the peak discharge of a 100 -year event is used for calculating the bridge scour depth. This will overestimate the scour depth, especially in arid and semi-arid region where the typical storms are high-peak and short duration flash floods. Therefore, the numerical test for simulating sediment transport around a bridge pier in unsteady condition was conducted by using the Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) model. The simulation obtained by the DualSPHysics showed the scour process around bride pier in dam break flow. The results showed the local scour depth is affected by the large sediment load accompanying the dam break flow. The maximum <b>scour</b> depth was <b>reached</b> quickly, but only lasted for a few seconds before being back-filled by sediment. The maximum scour depth occurring under unsteady flow is much smaller than the calculated value using peak-flow discharge. In other words, using the peak-flow discharge for designing can overestimate the maximum scour depth in comparison to the actual conditions under a flash flood or any unsteady hydrograph...|$|R
40|$|Scour {{formation}} at {{the toe of}} a {{rubble mound}} breakwater can lead to abrupt failure. Nowadays, counteraction of scour via geometrically closed filter rules, geotextiles or combinations is the common practice. Alternatively, in specific cases the use of geometrically open filters can save {{significant amount of time}} and decrease constructional costs. As a primary step towards this direction, the prediction of scour formation through a geometrically open filter can provide important information. Nevertheless, at this moment the knowledge upon this issue is insufficient and limited. A variety of recommendations occurs in literature, separately for toe design/scour protection and for the application of open filter criteria; however none of the studies treats these subjects combined. Therefore the objective of the present thesis is to get insight into scour formation and development through a breakwater toe lying upon sand and designed as a geometrically open filter. Thereby the research aims in drawing the link between scour characteristics with wave loading and filter configuration properties. In order to accomplish the research objective 2 D physical model tests were conducted in the 25 m long, 1 m deep and 0. 6 m wide wave flume of DMC, installed in the company’s laboratory. In total, 23 tests were executed with irregular waves (Jonswap spectrum) and by varying wave loading and filter configuration properties. In particular, 5 different filter/base layer combinations were examined and 3 different wave conditions were used to investigate the effects of relative grain diameter, relative filter thickness, grading of filter layer, base layer stability Number and storm duration. Quantification of damage magnitude was accomplished via laser profile measurements of filter and base layer prior and after the execution of each test. Furthermore, wave particle velocity climate was determined via the use of an Electromagnetic Flow Meter (EMS) placed {{at the center of the}} toe. Finally, temporal evolution scour was captured through the side glass and was examined by digitizing and analyzing snap-shots from predefined time steps. Test results and observations have revealed the highly spatial character of scour formation. Nevertheless, tests with identical boundary conditions showed a surprising convergence in averaged maximum scour depth magnitude. In addition, in the majority of tests an S-curve erosion/deposition pattern was shaped while erosion started immediately at the downstream side of the box threatening breakwater stability. Equilibrium maximum <b>scour</b> depth was <b>reached</b> for less than half the data set; thus erosion process was still in progress. Based on this, two approaches were developed to investigate temporal evolution of scour. Furthermore, dimensional analysis and literature review have revealed the most important parameters that have significant effect in scour formation; their combination has led to the formation of a prediction tool. However, combination of the results from tests with different base materials would not be possible without the introduction of the base material stability Number (critical Shields’ Number). The derived tool is an empirical expression with limited physical background and range of validity. Additionally, it overestimates maximum scour depth due to a serious model effect; the different buoyancy between filter and base layer that was causing initial damage and damage exaggeration. Nevertheless, it is capable of delineating the relative contribution of each parameter in scour depth formation. For an overall view of scour formation, further research will be needed to provide a more accurate quantification of the interrelation between parameters that play a role in scour formation and development, and to implement the effect of missing parameters. Consequently the use of the derived expression as a scour prediction tool in real life is not yet recommended. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} protect bridge piers and {{abutments}} against scour is critical to bridge safety. Excessive pier scour can cause high maintenance costs or even bridge collapse resulting in the interruption of traffic and possibly death. Up to now, various types of countermeasures have been recommended to reduce scouring around pier foundations. The countermeasures against pier scour can be broadly classified into two categories: (1) flow-altering and (2) bed-armouring countermeasures. This thesis focuses on the first category of countermeasures. Based on {{a comprehensive review of}} the up-to-date studies on various types of flow-altering countermeasures, these can be classified into four main groups based on their shapes and performances: (1) openings through piers, (2) pier attachments, (3) bed attachments and (4) other devices. After evaluation and considering all the countermeasures, a few countermeasures were recommended for further investigations. Among them, five countermeasures were selected for analysis in the present thesis. They are transverse sacrificial piles, collar, threading, pier slot and bed-sill. The first part of the experiments, were performed in clear-water scour condition, near threshold condition of sediment movement. In this part, countermeasures were tested individually. Afterwards, countermeasures that showed appropriate efficiency in scour depth reduction were combined one by one. Results of this part showed that a collar, pier slot and sacrificial piles may show efficiency of about 30 % in scour depth reduction; however, threading cannot be assumed as a reliable pier scour countermeasure. Results show that the blockage ratio of sacrificial piles is an important parameter, since by increasing the number of piles from three to five, the efficiency reduces. In this part also optimum size and location of a pier slot were criticised and best configuration based on previous and present studies was proposed. In fact, the best configuration can be suggested as a pier slot half as long as the flow depth plus maximum scour depth. In this case, the pier slot near the water surface may not significantly increase the efficiency. A combination of sacrificial piles with a collar and sacrificial piles with a slot showed that they cannot reduce the scour depth significantly with respect to each individual countermeasure. In particular, a combination of a collar and sacrificial piles increases the rate of scouring with respect to a single collar. At the end of this part, a combination of a bed-sill and cut-collar was selected as the best configuration. Two forms of this countermeasure were proposed for further studies. In the first proposed countermeasure, the use of a sill as wide as the channel width was recommended. This form, although reliable to prevent souring at the upstream part of the bed-sill, may not be applicable for some practical purposes. Therefore, in another attempt, a shorter bed-sill was also proposed, protected with two side-walls, {{in order to reduce the}} risk of scour intrusion in front of the bed-sill. These two proposed countermeasures showed efficiencies of 68. 5 % and 64. 5 % in scour depth reduction, however owing to the use of a border around the collar rim, the <b>scour</b> did not <b>reach</b> the pier body. In next part, the later form of proposed countermeasure that consists of a shorter bed-sill and seems to be more practical, was evaluated in unsteady flow tests with the peak flow intensity slightly greater than the threshold for the inception of sediment movement. In this section of the thesis, circular and round nose and tail rectangular piers were tested in both configurations of single and two in-line piers. The results of unsteady flow tests also show that the proposed combined countermeasure can protect pier foundation during a flood event. Specifically, it seems that the proposed countermeasure is more effective when it is applied to round nose and tail rectangular piers than circular onesScuola di Dottorato "Pitagora" in Scienzae Ingegneristiche, Ciclo I, a. a. 2007 - 2010 Università degli Studi della Calabri...|$|R
