50|$|The term ISIR (initial <b>sample</b> <b>inspection</b> report) {{is being}} used by German {{companies}} like VW and BMW. ISIR form is standardized by Verband der Automobilindustrie e.

The term is also used by some other companies like Hyundai and Kia. In fact ISIR is like the Warrant and Inspection Report of PPAP document package. PPAP document package includes some other document such as PFMEA, control plan, drawing, MSA, capability data etc. Besides ISIR document, other documents like that of PPAP is normally required by VW and Hyundai for release of a product and process. The PPAP is like the older ISIR plus a lot more, unless your customer has a specific requirement for using their ISIR within their system. ISIR is {{a summary of the}} initial sample being presented at what ever state. The PSW is supported and validated by the ISIR.

5000|$|In 1930 Womersely left Imperial College {{to take up}} a {{position}} as a junior research officer at the Shirley Institute (British Cotton Industry Research Institute), Manchester. There he applied mathematical techniques to problems in textile manufacture, including research on cotton spinning, drafting fibrous materials, and, through L. H. C. Tippett, the use of mathematical statistics in industrial production and quality control. While at the Shirley Institute he also met Leslie Comrie and became interested in computational techniques. [...] As a result, he spent a month at HM Nautical Almanac Office, London learning Comrie's numerical approaches. In 1936 he collaborated with Douglas Hartree who had built a Differential Analyser at the University of Manchester; together they devised a much cited method for the numerical integration of partial differential equations. In 1937, with war looming, he joined the armaments research department at Woolwich as a scientific officer, and worked on using statistical techniques applied to ballistics and ammunition proofing. In 1942, after the outbreak of World War II, he was appointed assistant director of scientific research at the Ministry of Supply and asked to set up and head the Advisory Service on Statistical Methods (later known as SR17). This organization was responsible for advice and research into ammunition supply, engineering factories and the investigations of a range of Government Inspectorates. It was particularly important in ensuring quality control and promoting <b>sample</b> <b>inspection</b> methods to British Industry during wartime. In 1944 he joined the British Association mathematical tables committee and in the same year he was appointed as the first superintendent of the Mathematics Division of the National Physical Laboratory (NPL). In addition to being responsible for statistical quality control, NPL was tasked with building an electronic computer, for which Womersley coined the name Automatic Computing Engine (ACE), echoing Babbage's Analytical Engine. Womersely was therefore responsible for the set up and operation of the first national computing centre in UK. One of his first actions was to visit the USA for a fact-finding tour, where he learned about ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer), Howard Aitken's Harvard machine, George Stibitz's machines and von Neumann's plans for the binary computer, EDVAC (Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Computer). On his return, he recruited Alan Turing to work on the ACE section and backed him strongly. Womersley also recruited Donald Davies in 1947. However, progress on the ACE project was delayed and Turing developed a dislike of Womersley and disdain for his abilities and left the project in 1948. Davies then took over from Turing and a small experimental model, pilot ACE was produced in 1950. Whether Womersely led NPL successfully has been questioned, although the consensus seems to be that he did a good job in difficult circumstances. He himself left the project in 1950, before the prototype pilot ACE was completed, to join the British Tabulating Machine Company (BTM), a forerunner of International Computers Limited (ICL). There he recognised that the computers previously developed by academia or governments were too large and expensive to be commercially viable and he recruited Andrew Booth who had developed the All Purpose Electronic Computer at Birbeck University, as a consultant to develop a smaller inexpensive computer. The computer copied from Booth's original design by Ray Bird was named the Hollerith Electronic Computer (HEC1), and was Britain's first mass-produced business computer.In 1954 Womersley left BTM and joined a research team, led by Donald McDonald at St Bartholomew's Hospital, who were studying blood flow in arteries. This change {{seems to have been a}} temporary arrangement to 'fill in time whilst awaiting completion of arrangements to come to WADC' (the Wright Air Development Center, Dayton, Ohio, USA). His collaboration with McDonald may have been prompted by his eldest daughter, Barbara, who was studying medicine at St Bartholomew's. Whatever the reason, this move led to a new and highly productive period in his research, as he applied mathematical and computational techniques to the analysis of blood flow and hemodynamics. Most notably in 1955 he published an article which described a dimensionless parameter (α) which characterised the nature of unsteady flow; subsequently this has been called the Womersley number. In July 1955, as planned, he moved to WADC to take a post as acting chief of the Analysis Section, System Dynamics Branch Aeronautical Research Laboratory. In 1956, he was promoted to Supervisory Mathematician and then Supervisory Aeronautical Research Engineer (Flight Systems), although he continued to publish on mathematical aspects of blood flow until his early death in 1958. His 1957 monograph on 'An elastic tube theory of pulse transmission and oscillatory flow in mammalian arteries' is widely regarded as a major influence in the field. In 1957 he returned to Britain for treatment of cancer. He underwent a number of operations in London and returned to Ohio in 1957, but never fully recovered and died at Ohio State University Hospital, Columbus, on 7 March 1958.|$|E

40|$|In {{line with}} the {{continuous}} improvement theory, the learning phenomenon is often incorporated into models for predicting {{the evolution of the}} unitary quality costs. In this paper, the quality metric predicted is the rate of supplied non-conforming units through a learning process with autonomous and induced sources of experience. The former is simply learning by doing, i. e. supplying, whilst the latter is driven by the allocation of training hours to suppliers. A revised learning model with time-varying learning rates is proposed for embracing both these effects into a multistage assembly/production setting. A single-period prevention–appraisal–failure cost function is achieved, and the <b>sample</b> <b>inspection</b> rates adopted among suppliers are also considered in order to evaluate their effect.

40|$|Forecasting {{electricity}} load plays {{a crucial role}} regarding decision making and planning for economical purposes. Besides, in light of the recent privatization and deregulation of the power industry, the forecasting of future {{electricity load}} {{turned out to be a}} very challenging problem. Electricity demand is also an important determinant for electricity spot prices which, in turn, influence the pricing of futures contracts in electricity markets. Empirical data about electricity loads highlight a clear seasonal behavior (higher loads during the winter season), which is partly due to climatic effects. The authors also emphasize the presence of load periodicity at a weekly basis (electricity load is usually lower on weekends or holidays) and at a daily basis (electricity load is clearly influenced by the hour). Finally, a long-term trend may depend on the general economic situation (for example, industrial production affects electricity load). All these features must be captured by the model. The purpose of this paper is then to build an hourly electricity load model. The deterministic component of the model requires linear regression while the authors investigate the stochastic component through classical time series tools. The calibration of the model is performed by using data coming from the Italian market in a 5 years period (2007 - 2011). Then, the researchers perform a Monte Carlo simulation in order to compare the simulated values with respect to the real data (both in sample and out of <b>sample</b> <b>inspection).</b> The reliability of the model will be deduced using standard tests which highlight a good fit of the simulated values. © Giovanni Masala, Stefania Marica, 2015...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Extreme Value Analysis {{can be used}} to {{extrapolate}} <b>sample</b> <b>inspection</b> data into uninspected regions of a component. These methods can be used in conjunction with structural reliability software to predict the probability of future failure of the component. This information can help both operators and regulators make risk-based decisions on the future operation of the plant. This paper illustrates the approach with reference to a case study, based on data collected from a pipeline system in an oil platform using an ultrasonic corrosion mapping technique. Part of the pipeline system was inaccessible for inspection. In this region, therefore, it was necessary to estimate the condition of the pipe based on sample inspections in the accessible area. This was done by partitioning the pipe surface into rectangular blocks and fitting statistical distributions to the minimum wall thicknesses in these blocks. These ‘extreme value ’ distributions were used to theoretically derive the corresponding distributions in the inaccessible part of the system. Structural reliability software was then used to predict the probability of future leakage. Analytic approximations were used both to verify the software and to estimate confidence limits for the predicted probabilities. The analysis showed that, {{for the majority of the}} line, the risk of leakage within its planned lifetime was negligible. However, the work highlighted the need for a better understanding of the rate of corrosion in two particular regions. As a result, a small number of ultrasonic transducers were permanently attached to these two sections of pipe. These transducers have yielded further information on the subsequent rate of corrosion. The paper will examine the assumptions underlying the analysis. It will discuss how the effect of correlation between neighbouring data points, known as data ‘clustering’, can be assessed and mitigated against. It will also provide guidance on assessing the goodness-of-fit to the distributions used. 1...|$|E
