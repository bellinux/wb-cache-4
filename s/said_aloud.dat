25|$|The first verse of the Shema is recited aloud, {{simultaneously}} by the hazzan and the congregation, which {{responds with}} the rabbinically instituted Baruch Shem ("Blessed be the Name") in silence before continuing {{the rest of}} Shema. Only on Yom Kippur is this response <b>said</b> <b>aloud.</b> The remainder of the Shema is read in silence. Sephardim recite {{the whole of the}} Shema aloud, except the Baruch Shem. Reform Jews also recite the whole of the first paragraph of the Shema aloud.|$|E
25|$|Pontifical High Mass: {{celebrated by}} a bishop {{accompanied}} by an assisting priest, deacon, subdeacon, thurifer, acolytes and other ministers, {{under the guidance of}} a priest acting as Master of Ceremonies. Most often the specific parts assigned to deacon and subdeacon are performed by priests. The parts that are <b>said</b> <b>aloud</b> are all chanted, except that the Prayers at the Foot of the Altar, which before the reform of Pope Pius V were said in the sacristy, are said quietly by the bishop with the deacon and the subdeacon, while the choir sings the Introit. The main difference between a pontifical and an ordinary High Mass is that the bishop remains at his throne almost all the time until the offertory.|$|E

2500|$|... "Ay," [...] he <b>said</b> <b>aloud.</b> There is no {{translation}} {{for this}} word {{and perhaps it}} is just a noise such as a man might make, involuntarily, feeling the nail go through his hands and into the wood.|$|E
2500|$|Whether Goetz {{actually}} <b>said</b> <b>aloud</b> {{the words}} [...] "You don't look so bad, here's another" [...] or only thought them {{is still a}} matter of dispute. He has subsequently denied on several occasions making the statement. One source said, [...] "In all probability, the defendant uttered these words only to himself and probably not even mouthing the words, but just saying them {{in his own mind}} as he squeezed the trigger that fifth time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tachanun or Taḥanun ( [...] "Supplication"), {{also called}} nefilat apayim ("falling on the face"), {{is part of}} Judaism's morning (Shacharit) and {{afternoon}} (Mincha) services, after the recitation of the Amidah, {{the central part of}} the daily Jewish prayer services. Traditionally, only the first four words of the prayer are <b>said</b> <b>aloud</b> so that others take notice. It is omitted on Shabbat, Jewish holidays and several other occasions (e.g., in the presence of a groom in the week after his marriage). Most traditions recite a longer prayer on Mondays and Thursdays.|$|E

2500|$|Formal {{public and}} {{personal}} prayers are addressed to [...] "Our Father in Heaven" [...] or [...] "Heavenly Father", and are {{closed in the}} name of Jesus Christ, followed by amen. When a prayer is given in public, it is customary for all attending to say [...] "amen" [...] at the prayer's conclusion. English-speaking members are encouraged to use [...] "thee," [...] "thou," [...] "thy" [...] and [...] "thine" [...] when addressing God, as a form of both familiarity and respect. Members who speak other languages use similar familiar, respectful language in prayer. Most prayers are extemporaneous and may be said while kneeling, standing, or sitting or in any other position. Bowing one's head and folding one's arms during prayer are both customary and encouraged. Personal prayers may be <b>said</b> <b>aloud</b> or performed silently.|$|E

6000|$|... "That little {{poisonous}} Indian viper," [...] she <b>said</b> <b>aloud,</b> attributing Aaron's mood to the doctor. Her {{husband was}} noisily bolting the door.|$|E
