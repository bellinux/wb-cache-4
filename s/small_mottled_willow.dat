50|$|The beet {{armyworm}} or <b>small</b> <b>mottled</b> <b>willow</b> moth (Spodoptera exigua) {{is one of}} the best-known agricultural pest insects. It is also known as the asparagus fern caterpillar. It is native to Asia, but has been introduced worldwide and is now found almost anywhere its many host crops are grown. The voracious larvae are the main culprits. In the British Isles, where it is an introduced species and not known to breed, the adult moth is known as the <b>small</b> <b>mottled</b> <b>willow.</b>|$|E
50|$|Spodoptera cilium, known {{variously}} as dark <b>mottled</b> <b>willow,</b> lawn caterpillar and grasslawn armyworm, is a noctuid moth {{found throughout}} much of sub-Saharan Africa and western, southern, and south-east Asia and several countries in southern and eastern Europe. It is a migrant to northern Europe and has been recorded at least nine times in the United Kingdom.|$|R
50|$|Episinus angulatus is a <b>small</b> <b>mottled</b> {{brownish}} tangle-web spider, found from Europe to Russia.|$|R
50|$|Paradrina clavipalpis, {{the pale}} <b>mottled</b> <b>willow,</b> is {{a species of}} moth of the family Noctuidae. It {{is found in the}} Palearctic ecozone (Europe, Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Kuwait, Russia, Central Asia, Mongolia, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, north-west India and Sri Lanka). It is an {{introduced}} species in North America, where it was first reported from Queens in New York City in 1993. In 2009 it was found in Rochester, New York, so it appears to be established and spreading.|$|R
5000|$|NGC 391 is a {{lenticular}} galaxy {{located in}} the constellation Cetus. It was discovered on January 8, 1853 by George Bond. It was described by Dreyer as [...] "faint, <b>small,</b> <b>mottled</b> but not resolved (Auwers 9)." ...|$|R
50|$|Badnavirus is a genus of viruses, in {{the family}} Caulimoviridae. Plants serve as natural hosts. There are {{currently}} 32 species in this genus including the type species Commelina yellow mottle virus. Diseases associated with this genus include: CSSV: leaf chlorosis, root necrosis, red vein banding in young leaves, <b>small</b> <b>mottled</b> pods, and stem/root swelling followed by die-back. Infection decreases yield by 25% within one year, 50% within two years and usually kills trees within 3-4 years.|$|R
25|$|The duck is a {{distinctive}} <b>small,</b> <b>mottled,</b> predominantly brown pintail. It is smaller and stockier than the remaining mainland subspecies (A. g. spinicauda), with more uniform and darker plumage. It has a reddish crown, light brown cheeks and throat, dark grey underwings and a pointed tail. The back, breast and flanks are scalloped with buff; the underparts are buffy white, mottled with brown. The bill is yellow {{with a blue}} and black line on the culmen and tip, and the feet are greenish-grey. The downy chick is dark brown with yellowish buff markings.|$|R
40|$|A small {{species of}} the seastar genus Henricia Gray, 1840 occurs along the cool {{temperate}} Pacific coast of North America from near Sitka, Alaska to just south of Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico. Its <b>small</b> adult size, <b>mottled</b> aboral colors, and benthic external brooding reproductive mode have long been noted, but {{it has never been}} formally separated from the larger, free-spawning Henricia leviuscula (Stimpson, 1857), with which it has been confused. Here we amplify the description of H. leviuscula, based on examination of the holotype and new specimens, and restrict it to only one of several similar species that co-occur in Puget Sound and vicinity. We also describe the <b>small</b> <b>mottled</b> brooder as Henricia pumila sp. nov., characterize its distribution, and contrast its morphology with H. leviuscula based on the arrangement of marginal plates and the microanatomy of aboral spines. Key words: North America, cool temperate Pacific coast, Echinodermata, Asteroide...|$|R
5000|$|The {{males are}} {{predominantly}} grey, reaching lengths of 45 cm. They are spiny with relatively wide tails. When [...] "in display", the males show various shades of orange or red around their necks, chins, and chests. Females are <b>smaller</b> and <b>mottled</b> brown with a vertical line of pale spots.|$|R
5000|$|The {{vulnerable}} Black Mountain boulderfrog or rock haunting frog (Cophixalus saxatilis) {{is one of}} {{the largest}} (about the size of a walnut) of Australia’s microhylids — a group of frogs normally confined to the leaf litter of tropical rainforests.This large-eyed frog lays its eggs on land rather than in water. An adult tends to the eggs and young, which hatch as fully formed froglets. They have no tadpole stage.The <b>smaller</b> <b>mottled</b> brown male are more easily heard than seen. Their call is a sharp tapping noise.They have acquired an almost crab-like ability to scuttle on the granite boulders, although they can still disappear in a series of leaps when alarmed. At night these frogs emerge to forage on the boulders of the mountain and in and about the scattered figs and fringing monsoon forest.|$|R
60|$|Two men {{ran to the}} side; {{and after}} some shouting, and swearing, and angling for the wherry with a boat-hook, Mr. Fleetwood, and Mrs. Fleetwood, and Master Fleetwood, and Mr. Wakefield, and Mrs. Wakefield, and Miss Wakefield, were safely {{deposited}} on the deck. The girl was about six years old, the boy about four; the former {{was dressed in a}} white frock with a pink sash and dog’s-eared-looking little spencer: a straw bonnet and green veil, six inches by three and a half; the latter, was attired for the occasion in a nankeen frock, between the bottom of which, and the top of his plaid socks, a considerable portion of two <b>small</b> <b>mottled</b> legs was discernible. He had a light blue cap with a gold band and tassel on his head, and a damp piece of gingerbread in his hand, with which he had slightly embossed his countenance.|$|R
50|$|The Asian palm civet is a <b>small,</b> <b>mottled</b> {{gray and}} black viverrid {{weighing}} 2 to 5 kg. It has a body length of about 53 cm with a 48 cm long tail. Its long, stocky body {{is covered with}} coarse, shaggy hair that is usually greyish in color. There is a white mask across the forehead, a small white patch under each eye, a white spot {{on each side of}} the nostrils, and a narrow dark line between the eyes. The muzzle, ears, lower legs, and distal half of the tail are black, with three rows of black markings on the body. The tail is without rings, unlike in similar civet species. Anal scent glands emit a nauseating secretion as a chemical defense when threatened or upset. Despite its species name hermaphroditus, the civets (like all other mammals) have two distinct sexes and are not hermaphrodites.|$|R
5000|$|Cacao swollen-shoot virus (CSSV) principally infects Theobroma cacao (cacao tree) {{and has a}} major {{effect on}} crop yields. Within one year of {{infection}} yields decrease by 25%, and within two years by 50%. The trees are usually killed within 3 to 4 years. [...] Symptoms {{vary depending on the}} strain of virus. Main symptoms include: leaf chlorosis (interveinal), root necrosis, red vein banding in young leaves, <b>small</b> <b>mottled</b> pods, and stem/root swelling followed by die-back. [...] CSSV has also been isolated from alternative hosts Cola chlamydanta, Ceiba pentandra, Adansonia digitata, Cola gigantean and Sterculia tragacantha. [...] These alternate hosts display the same symptoms as infected cacao trees, but with less severity. [...] Symptoms also vary with environmental conditions. Neither nutrition nor temperature changes have a perceivable effect on symptoms, but increased light intensity inhibits the development of root/stem swellings in infected plants. [...] Shaded cacao trees exhibit decreased growth and slightly more severe symptoms.|$|R
50|$|Carinotetraodon irrubesco {{are small}} {{pufferfish}} growing to around 44 mm. They live in murky, acidic water amongst submerged vegetation alongside rasboras, pipefish, halfbeaks, and gobies. Like other species in its genus, sexual dimorphism is apparent. Males are larger and coloured brown with creamy stripes on the flanks and dorsal surface, females are <b>smaller</b> and <b>mottled</b> brown in colour with irregular markings on the ventral surface. Both sexes have red eyes and red tail fins.|$|R
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the effect of turnip crinkle virus (TCV) infection on mitochondrial structure and function in turnips (Brassica rapa cultivar “Just Right”). TCV infection resulted in plants with <b>small,</b> <b>mottled</b> leaves with severely crinkled edges, and in a 46 % reduction in storage root mass. TCV infection resulted in specific vesicularization of mitochondrial outer membranes where TCV replication is thought to occur, with no apparent affect on other cellular membrane systems. Immunoblot analysis of mitochondrial proteins from storage roots indicated that the TCV p 28 protein, which is essential for viral replication, was associated with mitochondria and that mitochondrial heat shock protein 70 and cpn 60 levels increased upon TCV infection. Isolation of mitochondrial outer membranes further showed TCV p 28 protein enrichment in the outer membrane as compared with total mitochondrial proteins or total cellular proteins. Analysis of mitochondrial electron transport chain activities indicated that TCV infection resulted in a 54 % decrease in exogenous NADH-dependent oxygen uptake and a 8 % decrease in succinate- dependent oxygen uptake. Together {{these results indicate that}} TCV infection induces a stress response in mitochondria and a reduction in the ability of mitochondria to supply adenosine 5 ’-triphosphate to the cell...|$|R

The two pelicans are pictured standing on a flat stone {{near the edge of the}} pond. The leftmost bird is largest and appears to have more fully developed plumage, while the other is <b>smaller</b> and <b>mottled.</b> Lily-pads can be seen floating in the surrounding water, while a guard-rail enclosed with chickenwire fence is pictured at left, partially obscured by the foliage of a large water plant...|$|R
50|$|The 15.5-16.5 cm long Tuamotu sandpiper is a <b>small,</b> short-winged, <b>mottled</b> brown {{bird with}} {{more or less}} barred underparts. Its short sharp beak is more like that of an insectivorous {{passerine}} than a wader. There are two colour morphs which intergrade. Pale birds are medium brown above and white below, with light barring or spotting on the breast and whitish streaking on the head. The bold supercilium and the chin are also white. The rectrices are brown with white tips and white triangular markings on the outer webs. Dark phase birds replace medium with darker brown and white with light buff or tawny white. The flanks are brown, and the entire underparts are heavily barred that colour.|$|R
60|$|So many {{children}} are brought down to our watering-place that, {{when they are not}} out of doors, as they usually are in fine weather, it is wonderful where they are put: the whole village seeming much too small to hold them under cover. In the afternoons, you see no end of salt and sandy little boots drying on upper window-sills. At bathing-time in the morning, the little bay re-echoes with every shrill variety of shriek and splash - after which, if the weather be at all fresh, the sands teem with <b>small</b> blue <b>mottled</b> legs. The sands are the children's great resort. They cluster there, like ants: so busy burying their particular friends, and making castles with infinite labour which the next tide overthrows, that it is curious to consider how their play, to the music of the sea, foreshadows the realities of their after lives.|$|R
50|$|Females reach {{a length}} of 25 cm, one of the world's {{heaviest}} bugs, and the males {{a length of}} 10 cm. The females of this species are very aggressive and much larger, wider, and brighter-colored than the male. The female is lime green and has short, rounded wings, however their short length doesn't allow them to fly. The males are much <b>smaller</b> and a <b>mottled</b> brown colour. Both sexes have small spikes on their upper bodies, more numerous in the female, who also has very large spines on her hind legs that can snap together as a scissor-like weapon.|$|R
5000|$|Head {{brownish}} black, {{covered with}} short yellowish grey pile. Thorax dirty black, covered with yellow grey pile; cylindrical, {{and without any}} spines or risings. Antennae dusky brown; having a spine on each joint, except that next the head, and {{about the length of}} the insect. Scutellum very <b>small.</b> Elytra black, <b>mottled</b> with yellow grey; being margined at the sides and suture, and not reaching or covering the anus, each having two spines at the extremity. Abdomen and breast greyish brown, as are the legs, each of which is furnished with a spine {{at the tip of the}} tibiae. Length of body ⅔ inch (17 mm).|$|R
50|$|Schaus {{established}} the genus Dunama in 1912 {{for a group}} of <b>small,</b> relatively drab, <b>mottled</b> and tree-bark patterned, brown notodontid moths with a black orbicular spot. Todd revised the genus whose distribution extends from Mexico to Amazonian Brazil in 1976. He described two new species and listed two species, D. angulinea and D. tuna from Costa Rica. One additional species was recently described by Miller and Thiaucourt from Ecuador in 2011. The genus traditionally has been placed in the Nystaleinae, but that placement remains provisional because species of Dunama lack the characteristic morphological traits of most nystaleines. Additionally, all known caterpillars of Dunama feed on monocots (Musaceae, Marantaceae, Heliconiaceae, Arecaceae), a trait rarely encountered in the Notodontidae.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} the genotype and phenotype {{of patients with}} a late-onset Stargardt's disease (STGD 1). DESIGN: Retrospective case series. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-one unrelated STGD 1 patients with an age at onset of >/= 45 years and >/= 1 rare variant in the ABCA 4 gene. METHODS: Ophthalmologic examination, including best-corrected visual acuity (VA), Amsler grid testing, fundus photography, fluorescein angiography (FA), spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT), fundus autofluorescence (FAF) imaging, full-field electroretinography (ERG), multifocal ERG, and central visual field testing. Analysis of the ABCA 4 gene was performed using microarray analysis, sequencing, and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. In addition, the PRPH 2 and CFH genes were sequenced. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Age at onset, VA, fundus appearance, FA, FAF, and OCT findings; ABCA 4 mutations; and genotype-phenotype correlation. RESULTS: The mean age at onset was 55 years (range, 45 - 72 years). Seven patients were diagnosed without visual symptoms (age range, 45 - 83 years). The VA was >/= 20 / 40 in 24 eyes of 14 patients (59 %) owing to foveal sparing. On ophthalmoscopy, late-onset STGD 1 showed flavimaculatus flecks (15 patients), <b>small</b> flecks surrounding <b>mottled</b> foveal changes (3 patients), extensive chorioretinal atrophy (2 patients), or small yellowish spots in the macula (1 patient). The fundus flecks showed increased autofluorescence on FAF. The choroidal background fluorescence on FA was obscured in 16 patients (80 %). We found a single heterozygous ABCA 4 variant in 11 patients (52 %), 2 compound heterozygous variants in 8 patients (38 %), and a homozygous variant in 2 patients (10 %). No PRPH 2 or CFH mutations were detected. CONCLUSIONS: Late-onset STGD 1 is at the mild {{end of the spectrum}} of retinal dystrophies caused by ABCA 4 mutations. The VA is frequently preserved in late-onset STGD 1 patients owing to foveal sparing. This phenotype may be caused by 1 or 2 ABCA 4 variants. The differential diagnosis between late-onset STGD 1 and age-related macular degeneration may be challenging. A thorough clinical and genetic analysis makes a distinction possible, which is important for clinical and genetic counseling.
