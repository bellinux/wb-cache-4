Work could not be started until £425,250 had been raised.

50|$|An {{extraordinary}} minister (Latin: minister extraordinarius) of {{a sacrament}} is someone, {{other than an}} ordinary minister, officially authorised to administer a sacrament by the law itself (as an instituted acolyte is an extraordinary minister of holy communion) or by being deputed for this purpose. If an extraordinary minister of a sacrament administers it illicitly, the sacrament is effective, but the person ministering could be liable for an ecclesiastical penalty, such as an interdict. By way of example, an extraordinary minister of Holy Communion is authorised to bring Holy Communion within a particular parish or diocese. If a minister brings Holy Communion to someone outside of the authorised area, it is done illicitly, but the communicant does receive Holy Communion, as indeed the communicant would, even if the person administering it had <b>no</b> <b>authorisation</b> whatever.|$|R

40|$|It {{is likely}} that Grotius was {{influenced}} by knowledge {{of the practice of}} the courts in the Netherlands in his easy recognition of third-party rights. This may perhaps be seen in his Inleidinge tot de Hollandsche Rechts-geleerdheid, where the departure from the firm Roman rules is justified in terms of a preference for billickheid over scherpheid van rechten, reflecting Martinus Gosia’s favouring of aequitas over strictum ius and also the aequitas canonica used to ground a third party’s claim in the Grand Conseil of Malines in the sixteenth century. By contrast, the treatment of the subject in the De Iure Belli ac Pacis was strongly influenced by the analysis of Covarruvias, whose Relectio on the Sext 1. 18. 2 was cited by Grotius in the margin of his text. The normal rule, as for Covarruvias, was that a contract was created by the acceptance of a promise, and it did not matter whether the acceptor was present or absent. Against this background Grotius dealt with three distinct situations raising the controversial issue of third-party rights. First was the simple pactum in favorem tertii, where one person accepted a promise in his own name for the benefit of another. Roman law would have said that the acceptor obtained a right only if he had an interest, but Grotius stated that this was no longer the law. The acceptor therefore received a right which he could transfer to the third-party beneficiary, provided that he also accepted it. In the meantime, the promisor could not unilaterally revoke the promise, though the acceptor (in whom the right was vested) had the power to release it. Second was the case of direct representation, where a person had been mandated to accept a promise in another’s name. Roman law had restricted direct representation to slaves and others in the potestas of the beneficiary, but, said Grotius, this restriction no longer existed and anybody might be authorised by another to accept a promise on their behalf. In such a case the right vested immediately in the person on whose behalf the promise had been accepted. Third was the situation where acceptance was made {{in the name of the}} beneficiary, but by a person acting without <b>authorisation.</b> <b>No</b> right vested in the beneficiary until he had himself accepted the promise, but neither, it seems did any right vest in the acceptor. None the less, until the beneficiary had accepted or rejected the promise the promisor had no power to revoke the promise, nor did the acceptor have any power to release it – he had not received the promise for his own benefit or on his own behalf, and it would be contrary to good faith were it to be released. Alongside this, Grotius dealt with the donatio sub modo, applying the same principle as he had identified as lying behind the pactum in favorem tertii and saying that a burden placed on the donee of a gift in favour of a third party could be revoked so long as it had not been accepted by the third party. status: publishe...|$|R

Some years later, after {{she had become a}} widow, the two of them married one another. In 1859, {{following}} the funeral of Emilio Dandolo the Visconti-Venosta brothers fell under suspicion and took refuge in Piedmont. The manner of their departures differed. Warned by Rosa Bargnani that they were being sought by the authorities, Emiolio headed out of the city without delay, Giovanni decided to stay behind and wait for the delivery of <b>signed</b> emigration <b>authorisations</b> from nearby Brescia. His house {{was the subject of a}} police raid in the night, however. Giovanni fled through a side door and ran for help. His first thought was to go to Costantino Garavaglia, but it turned out he had just been arrested. He fared no better at Carcano's house. He then got hold of Clara Maffei who immediately contacted Carlo Tenca who realised that Visconti Venosta had escaped from his house without taking any money. A few meters further on he reached the house of di Laura d'Adda Salvaterra Scaccabarozzi who was able to provide him with some cash, after which Tenco accompanied the fugitive to beyond the city limits. The most adventurous part of his escape from the territories controlled by the Austrians was the final stretch. Arriving at the frontier, here defined by the Ticino river he came across, by chance, a friend and fellow patriot who knew the local frontier commissioner. There was a project under discussion at the time to extend the local (horse drawn) railway line to the west from Tornavento. Giovanni and his friend had the idea to offer to survey a piece of land that could be used for the line extension. After promising the commissioner to put in a good word for his son, Giovanni obtained the man's permission to undertake a reconnaissance on the far side of the river: he duly crossed, which took him into Piedmont, outside the territory controlled by the Austrians.|$|R
30|$|However, REACH regulates {{only the}} use of SVHC within the European Economic Area (EEA). This holds also true for uses in articles. Art. 3 No 3 REACH defines the term ‘article’ as ‘object which during {{production}} is given a special shape, surface or design which determines its function {{to a greater degree}} than does its chemical composition’. Most products used e.g. in private homes such as furniture, textiles, toys, books or electronic devices are, therefore, covered [12]. Besides, the term may refer to complex articles (e.g., bicycle) and also to their constituent parts where these parts meet the article definition (e.g., bicycle tube) [13]. Whenever the producer of an article incorporates SVHC outside the EEA, Art.  56 (1) REACH does not apply. As a consequence, such articles may be imported into the EEA subject to the requirements of Art. 7 REACH, but there is <b>no</b> <b>authorisation</b> requirement for REACH Annex XIV SVHC contained.

The railway settled down to running coal trains for Tilmanstone Colliery as its only profitable activity. The colliery company objected to its rates, and opened an aerial ropeway in competition to the Eastern Arm of Dover Harbour in 1930.
