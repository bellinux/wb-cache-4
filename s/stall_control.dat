40|$|A {{variable}} stiffness composite optimization {{framework for}} wind turbine rotor blades is presented. The framework {{consists of a}} multi-fidelity approach for wind turbine rotor analysis, where both structural and aerodynamic constraints are considered during the optimization. The potential of twist coupled blades to regulate the power on <b>stall</b> <b>controlled</b> wind turbines is investigated by exploiting the characteristic of unbalanced laminates to induce twist coupling. A complete stiffness variation along the blade span is considered during the optimization, while using the cost of energy as the objective function.

40|$|In this study, eight {{different}} control concepts for wind turbines are compared {{in terms of}} their annual energy capture. In detail, they are a <b>stall</b> <b>controlled</b> single speed concept, a <b>stall</b> <b>controlled</b> two speed concept, an active <b>stall</b> <b>controlled</b> single speed concept, an active <b>stall</b> <b>controlled</b> two speed concept, a pitch controlled single speed concept, a pitch controlled two speed concept, a <b>stall</b> <b>controlled</b> variable speed concept and finally a pitch controlled variable speed concept. In {{order to be able to}} expose all these different concepts to exactly the same wind conditions, numerical computer simulation is chosen as the appropriate method to do the comparison, as in reality it is almost impossible to achieve the same wind conditions for different turbines. This approach also prevents all possible differences in rotor layout between the individual concepts from entering into the results, as it is possible to use the same rotor design for all control concepts. Because the influence of time variant quantities such as the turbulent wind flow on a nonlinear system (e. g. a wind turbine rotor) has to be taken into account, an analytical representation had to be found which allowed a time-step simulation. This especially set some limits on the complexity allowed for the numerical model. Therefore the modeling of all parts of the system (whether they are aerodynamic, mechanic or electric) is kept rather simplistic. As a comparison of general control concepts is the topic of this study, the controllers are not modeled as they are used by a certain manufacturer. Instead they are modeled in an idealized way, each of which covers the ideal performance of one class of control concepts. For each combination of parameters, one time domain simulation was performed. The output data was then weighted and averaged in order to obtain the energy captured from the wind within one year. These energy values are finally arranged in a way which allows an easy comparison between the relative performance of all control concepts under consideration. The results show the differences in the annual energy capture of the eight concepts as a function of site conditions (the annual mean wind speed, the turbulence and the shape parameter of the Weibull distribution assumed for the annual wind speed distribution) as well as their dependence on two design parameters (the design tip speed ratio and the choice of rotor profiles). Due to the rather crude modeling these results have to be seen more qualitatively then quantitatively. However, they show to which extent a comparison between different control concepts depends on the values of different parameters. Hopefully, they also lead to a deeper understanding of the very different results of similar comparisons found in the literature...|$|R

In the early 1950s, he built two smaller alternating current turbines which operated at Vester Egesborg near Næstved {{and on the}} island of Bogø. His three-bladed Gedser facility (1957) was Denmark's first large wind turbine. With a blade span of 24 m, it produced 200 kW of alternating current fed directly into the grid. Its electromechanical yawing, asynchronous generator, and the three stall-regulated blades with emergency aerodynamic tip brakes (these were invented by Juul) is a design that is still widely used in Denmark. <b>Stall</b> <b>control</b> was provided through an asynchronous generator. The turbine, which for many years was the world's largest, operated from 1957 to 1967 without maintenance, demonstrating incredible durability. In connection with NASA testing for the U.S. wind energy programme, it was refurbished in 1975 and brought back into operation. It continued to run for a few years, providing test data for the further development of wind turbines in Denmark. Over the course of its lifetime, the Gedser wind turbine generated 2.2 million kW-hours (7.9 TJ).|$|E
40|$|Abstract-The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to assess 10 MW direct-drive permanent-magnet (DDPM) generator systems with different control strategies namely pitch control and active speed <b>stall</b> <b>control.</b> In the active speed <b>stall</b> <b>control</b> concept, there is no pitch mechanism, and the rotor speed is actively controlled by the generator to control the output power.

40|$|Abstract-The {{objectives}} {{of this paper}} are to investigate the feasibility of a 10 MW generator for a direct-drive wind turbine and to compare the generator systems for pitch control and for active speed <b>stall</b> <b>control.</b> The idea behind the active speed <b>stall</b> <b>control</b> concept {{is to make a}} rotor that is as simple as possible, and therefore very robust and suitable for offshore wind turbines. This is done by removing the pitch control of the blades. Above rated wind speed, the power is not controlled by controlling the pitch, but by controlling the rotor speed: the rotor speed is so much reduced that the aerodynamic power is limited to the rated value. A rough 10 MW permanent-magnet direct-drive generator design is presented, indicating that such a generator is feasible. It is shown that for a thorough evaluation of active speed <b>stall</b> <b>control,</b> more knowledge is required about changes in the wind speed.

This paper presents a first-of-a-kind feasibility study of an active <b>stall</b> <b>control</b> experiment with a magnetic bearing servo-actuator in the NASA Glenn high-speed single-stage compressor test facility. Together with CFD and experimental data a two-dimensional, incompressible compressor stability model was used in a stochastic estimation and control analysis to determine the required magnetic bearing performance for compressor <b>stall</b> <b>control.</b> The resulting requirements introduced new challenges to the magnetic bearing actuator design. A magnetic bearing servo-actuator was designed which fulfilled the performance specifications. Control laws were then developed to stabilize the compressor shaft. In a second control loop, a constant gain controller was implemented to stabilize rotating stall. A detailed closed loop simulation at 100 % corrected design speed resulted in a 2. 3 % reduction of stalling mass flow which is comparable to results obtained in the same compressor by Weigl et al.

The method uses grid-status information to initialise the grid-connected wind turbine model. The goal is to start a power-system simulation in a stationary state, without unnecessary transient behaviour {{at the beginning of}} the simulation. Correct initialisation is necessary to reach quickly the steady state of the grid-connected wind turbine, before a real transient on the grid occurs. Consequently, the dynamic performance of the system can be independently and accurately evaluated.

40|$|Active <b>stall</b> <b>control</b> is {{a current}} {{research}} {{area at the}} NASA Glenn Research Center that offers a great benefit in specific fuel consumption by allowing the gas turbine to operate beyond the onset of stall. Magnetic bearings are being investigated as a new method to perform active <b>stall</b> <b>control.</b> This enabling global aviation safety technology would result in improved fuel efficiency and decreased carbon dioxide emissions, as well as improve safety and reliability by eliminating oil-related delays and failures of engine components, which account for 40 percent of the commercial aircraft departure delays. Active <b>stall</b> <b>control</b> works by perturbing the flow {{in front of the}} compressor stage such that it cancels the pressure wave, which causes the compressor to go into stall. Radial magnetic bearings are able to whirl the shaft so that variations in blade tip leakage would flow upstream causing a perturbation wave that could cancel the rotating stall cell. Axial or thrust magnetic bearings cannot be used to cancel the surge mode in the compressor because they have a very low bandwidth and thus cannot modulate at a high enough frequency. Frequency response is limited because the thrust runner cannot be laminated. To improve the bandwidth of magnetic thrust bearings, researchers must use laminations to suppress the eddy currents. A conical magnetic bearing can be laminated, resulting in increased bandwidth in the axial direction. In addition, this design can produce both radial and thrust force in a single bearing, simplifying the installation. The proposed solution combines the radial and thrust bearing into one design that can be laminated [...] a conical magnetic bearing. The new conical magnetic bearing test rig, funded by a Glenn fiscal year 2002 Director's Discretionary Fund, was needed because none of the existing rigs has an axial degree of freedom. The rotor bearing configuration will simulate that of the main shaft on a gas turbine engine. One conical magnetic bearing replaces the ball bearing in front of the compressor, and the second replaces the roller bearing behind the burner.
