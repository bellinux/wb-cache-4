30|$|The {{tribological}} {{behaviors of}} {{two types of}} seal coatings, nickel–graphite and aluminum–hexagon-boron nitride (Ni–Cg and Al–hBN, respectively) versus a Ti– 6 Al– 4 V blade used in turbofan engines were investigated using a high-speed rubbing test. The wear status and damage mechanism of the friction couples were studied and the abradability of the seal coatings was evaluated. By analysis of the coating properties and damage mechanism of the <b>seal</b> <b>couple,</b> the friction heat effect was identified as the key factor influencing blade wear forms as well as coating abradability. A one-dimensional heat conduction model was established to estimate the effect of increasing temperature on the friction interface. The results indicated that in the Ni–Cg and Ti– 6 Al– 4 V <b>seal</b> <b>couple,</b> the temperature rising rate (TRR) of the Ti– 6 Al– 4 V blade was faster {{than that of the}} Ni–Cg coating, and so the Ti– 6 Al– 4 V blade softened earlier than the Ni–Cg coating, causing the blade to suffer severe wear. In the Al–hBN and Ti– 6 Al– 4 V <b>seal</b> <b>couple,</b> the TRR of the Ti– 6 Al– 4 V blade was slower than that of the Al–hBN coating, and so the Al–hBN coating softened first; thus, blade damage was reduced or even replaced by coating adhesion. The square root ratio of thermal diffusivity between the blade and the coating could be taken as an indicator of the ratio of TRR between the blade and coating to predict blade wear status as well as damage mechanism. The results of the model agreed well with the experiment results of the two <b>seal</b> <b>couples</b> used in this study.|$|R

The intervention rate at scheduled routine review visits and at unscheduled {{visits to the}} eye casualty service in the first 120  postoperative days was recorded. Interventions were defined as departures from predetermined postoperative care protocols.  RESULTS—Clinical interventions were reported in 2. 8 % (95 % confidence interval 1. 5  to 4. 1 %) of (n= 1652) routine follow up visits. Many of these interventions were avoidable or trivial; 90 % of patients had no postoperative intervention at any visit. 7. 3 % of patients made unscheduled visits to the emergency service. The intervention rate in this group was 50 % (35. 9  to 64. 1 %).  CONCLUSIONS—The intervention rate in routine clinical review after uncomplicated modern cataract surgery is low.

40|$|International audienceIn {{this study}} {{the effect of}} the {{temperature}} increase on the hydro-mechanical properties of sheared Boom clay samples is investigated. Two samples of Boom clay are resaturated in a new hollow cylinder triaxial cell with a short drainage path and then sheared by performing an axisymmetric triaxial loading. The effect of the undrained heating under deviatoric stress is studied on the first sample. It is shown that undrained temperature increase leads to an increase of pore water pressure and consequently to a decrease of the effective mean stress which brings the sample to failure. For an initially sheared sample, the failure occurs along the existing shear band which behaves as a weakness plane in the sample. The responses of the local strain measurement transducers clearly show the sliding of rigid blocks when failure occurs in the sample. The effect of the presence of a shear band on the permeability of the other Boom clay sample is investigated at ambient temperature andat 80 °C.

40|$|Background: To {{evaluate}} {{the changes in}} Preoperative and Postoperative keratometry results and rapid visual rehabilitation in Cataract surgery by our phaco-sandwich technique through the <b>self</b> <b>sealing</b> sclero-corneal tunnel incision without phacoemulsification. Methods: 96 eyes of 88 patients with age-related cataracts underwent small incision suture less cataract surgery without phacoemulsification. All eyes were operated by the phaco-sandwich technique through sclerocorneal tunnel with 6 mm frown-shaped external scleral incision. 6 mm single piece PMMA lens was implanted in the capsular bag. Patients were evaluated at 1 week, 4 weeks and 12 weeks post-operatively. Results: Ninety six eyes of eighty eight patients were our cohort. During the first post-operative week 8 eyes (8. 3 %) had uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) of 6 / 6. By the end of 12 post-operative weeks, 33 eyes(34. 5 %) had UCVA of 6 / 6. 64 (66. 7 %), 72 (75 %) and 80 (83. 3 %) eyes had best correctable visual acuity (BCVA) of 6 / 6 after 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks respectively. 64 (66. 7 %) eyes after 4 weeks, 72 (75 %) after 8 weeks and 80 (83 %) after 12 weeks had best correctable visual acuity (BCVA) of 6 / 6.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was to improve a paraffin actuated micropump design, {{to be able to}} pump against extreme pressures (above 100 bar). This was accomplished by initially studying the membrane activation, using video capturing. The micropump has been improved to withstand pressures high enough, to enable use in an high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system. The micropump has been shown to pump against back pressures up to 150 bar, with a positive net-flow. This should be compared with the previously recorded maximum back pressure of 50 bar. The pumping against high back pressures was possible due to an increased understanding of the sealing of the membranes. This resulted in a new design that was manufactured and characterised. Without clamping the pump was measured to manage back pressures of 10 bar, and then starting to leak in a bond at the flow channel. With supporting clamping, the managed back pressures increased ten folded. When measured on the different valves, pressure above 200 bar has been possible to withhold. Although the valves were below their maximum limit, the pressure was not possible to be further increased due to a limitation in the equipment, i. e. risk of damaging the connections. When examined after pressurised at extreme pressures (above 100 bar) several times, no signs of fatigue or damage of the membrane was seen. A new behaviour of the valves was discovered. Above certain pressures some designs <b>self</b> <b>sealed,</b> i. e. withholding the pressure after the voltage was turned off.
