40|$|Data Warehouses are {{designed}} to hold large amounts of data and {{they are expected to}} answer complex queries. It’s not an efficient approach to iterate through all the data sets in order to prepare the results. A general method for answering such complex queries in a warehouse environment is to keep the pre-computed results on large <b>summary</b> <b>tables</b> (or aggregate tables) and use these tables to produce the query results. This will result in faster processing in answering the user queries {{but at the same time}} this brings up the issue of updating the <b>summary</b> <b>tables</b> efficiently. In this survey, I will start by summarizing the basic concepts of Data Warehouse systems and in the following sections the issues about using and maintaining the <b>summary</b> <b>tables</b> will be discussed. Database technology is all about providing efficient and reliable management of data. In most of the cases, companies collect huge amounts of data using the traditional OLTP (On line Transaction Processing) technology. OLTP applications consist o...|$|R
40|$|Data {{warehouses}} contain {{large amounts}} of information, often collected {{from a variety of}} independent sources. Decision-support functions in a warehouse, such as on-line analytical processing (OLAP), involve hundreds of complex aggregate queries over large volumes of data. It is not feasible to compute these queries by scanning the data sets each time. Warehouse applications therefore build a large number of <b>summary</b> <b>tables,</b> or materialized aggregate views, to help them increase the system performance. As changes, most notably new transactional data, are collected at the data sources, all <b>summary</b> <b>tables</b> at the warehouse that depend upon this data need to be updated. Usually, source changes are loaded into the warehouse at regular intervals, usually once a day, in a batch window, and the warehouse is made unavailable for querying while it is updated. Since the number of <b>summary</b> <b>tables</b> that need to be maintained is often large, a critical issue for data warehousing is how to maintain the s [...] ...|$|R
