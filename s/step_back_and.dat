5|$|In Sicily, the {{decision}} was taken not just for fashion and appearance {{but also because it}} would minimise the damage to property and life likely to be caused in future quakes. In 1693, the cramped housing and streets had caused buildings to collapse together like dominoes. Although after the earthquake the avenues were broadened and the density of housing was lowered overall, cramped and narrow areas of housing still remained, posing a hazard for the poor. Architecturally and aesthetically, the big advantage of the new order of town planning was that unlike many Italian towns and cities, where one frequently encounters a monumental Renaissance church squeezed terrace fashion between incongruous neighbours, in urban Baroque design one can <b>step</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> actually see the architecture in a more conducive setting in relation to its proportions and perspective. This is most notable in the largely rebuilt towns of Caltagirone, Militello in Val di Catania, Catania, Modica, Noto, Palazzolo Acreide, Ragusa, and Scicli.|$|E

Backlash from the move caused Google to <b>step</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> remove the requirement of a Google+ user account, keeping only a private Google account without a public-facing profile, starting in July 2015.|$|E
25|$|Bourguiba, {{who thought}} the Destour and its {{leadership}} to be obstacles to his ambitions, decided to resign from the party on September 9. He soon learned from this experience. The success obtained thanks to popular violent uprisings shows the failure of Destourians' favorite methods, consisting of petitions and telegrams. Only violence by determined groups could lead the Residence to <b>step</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> negotiate political solutions. That would be his guideline until 1956.|$|E

The band means so much to me, and cancelling the tour has been a very sad decision. I am hopeful that in the near future we will be back on the road again playing music we love.|$|E
25|$|Paulo Sousa {{quit his}} Trainer {{position}} in Basel {{at the end}} of the 2014–15 season. On 18 June 2015, Basel announced that Urs Fischer had signed a three-year contract as first team manager. His assistants are Marco Walker and Markus Hoffmann. Massimo Colomba remained the Goalkeeper coach. Massimo Ceccaroni is head of the FCB Youth System. Coach of the Youth Team (U–21) was Thomas Häberli until October, at which time, due to the bad results, he had to <b>step</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> then Ceccaronii coached the team.|$|E
25|$|There was a {{sense of}} {{achievement}} when the agreement was finally signed and technicians employed by the CDF got down to the task of making the mechanism operational. In an interview, CDF Chief Executive Officer Ambassador Lorne McDonnough said “The CDF start-up team was always confident it would meet the projected launch date....” Despite this confidence he admitted that “...along the way there were always the glitches and frustrating delays that called for an extra dose of perseverance as well as the need to <b>step</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> revisit the problem with a fresh resolve”. Ambassador McDonnough noted that heightened expectations and the desire to see the CDF operational in the shortest possible time, meant that Member States sometimes underestimated the work which had to be done to make the CDF ready for full operations.|$|E

25|$|Depending {{upon the}} path of the ball, the batsman will either move forward or back in his attempt to {{intercept}} it. A forward movement is designated a front foot shot, whereas a backwards movement is designated a back foot shot. A front foot shot is typically used to address a ball arriving at between ankle and thigh height. The batsman will step forward towards the ball, bending his front knee to bring his bat down to the anticipated height of the ball. By moving forwards, the batsman is also able to intercept the ball immediately after it has pitched, thus nullifying any potentially dangerous lateral movement. A back foot shot is typically used to address a ball arriving at between thigh and head height. The batsman will <b>step</b> <b>back</b> <b>and,</b> if necessary, stand on his tip toes to raise his bat to the height of the ball. By stepping back towards the wicket, he also receives the advantage of having an extra small amount of time to react to any unexpected lateral movement or variation in bounce.|$|E
25|$|Probably no {{instrument}} in modern time so {{lends itself to}} threats to constitutional guarantees of individual freedom as the polygraph or so-called lie detector. The threat of its use or the intimidation inherent in its use restricts free expression and communication of ideas, intrudes on an individual's subconscious thought, makes him fear to speak his thoughts freely, or compels him to speak against his will. To my mind, the entire purpose of these machines is to invade a man's mind and find what lurks in the innermost part of his mental consciousness for reasons which {{have nothing to do}} with his ability to perform a job. If the right of privacy means anything at all and if it is a right to be cherished in our society, it means that people should be entitled to have thoughts, hopes, desires, and dreams that are beyond the reach of a bureaucrat, an employer, or an electronic technician. This is something which enthusiasts for these machines do not seem to understand. They do not understand and they do not appreciate how important privacy is to each American, and as long as that lesson is not understood, we all will find our right to privacy constricted if not abrogated entirely. I propose this legislation to ban the use of the polygraph for employment purposes in the hopes that Congress will pause for a moment, <b>step</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> take a long look at the issues involved in the unrestrained use of the polygraph. Legislation is necessary to bring some order and control to the practice...|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rolling Stone in May 2009, Shinoda said the band {{was in the process}} of writing and recording material for the album. The album was originally scheduled for an early 2010 release, but Shinoda was concerned with [...] "the quality of the tunes" [...] and said, [...] "if we need to take a <b>step</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> make sure everything is top, top quality by our standards, we will". Shinoda also said that, in comparison to Minutes to Midnight, the new album would have a bigger [...] "thread of consistency" [...] and would be more experimental and [...] "hopefully more cutting-edge".|$|E

[...] Next year is definitely exciting and it has added something to training, but as a crew, we're only thinking about Sunday." [...] This year's race was umpired by Judith Packer and was sponsored by Newton Investment Management, a subsidiary of The Bank of New York Mellon, for the third successive year.|$|E
500|$|Commercially, {{the song}} had limited success, {{reaching}} number 27 on the US Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs chart but only managing to peak at 99 Billboard Hot 100. Later {{in an interview}} with Billboard magazine, Garrett revealed that the song would not be included on Pink Friday and that the poor performance of the song was out of his control, [...] "I was only able to do as much as I was allowed to do. Sometimes you have to <b>step</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> get off the wheel. I didn't have control of the entire creative process. A lot of [...] artists trust me enough and allow me to do what I know is best to do as a producer".|$|E

500|$|In March 2010, YouTube began free {{streaming}} {{of certain}} content, including 60 cricket matches of the Indian Premier League. According to YouTube, {{this was the}} first worldwide free online broadcast of a major sporting event. On March 31, 2010, the YouTube website launched a new design, with the aim of simplifying the interface and increasing the time users spend on the site. Google product manager Shiva Rajaraman commented: [...] "We really felt like we needed to <b>step</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> remove the clutter." [...] In May 2010, YouTube videos were watched more than two billion times per day. This increased to three billion in May 2011, and four billion in January 2012. In February 2017, one billion hours of YouTube was watched every day.|$|E
500|$|On October 22, 2015, {{producer}} Malek Akkad {{expressed his}} wishes to postpone production {{for the new}} Halloween film and insists that the next iteration and the extra time {{will result in a}} better film. Malek said of Halloween Returns: [...] "Although, I have to say, and this is somewhat new news, but unfortunately things happen in Hollywood where you have issues with studios and different variables. We've had to take a <b>step</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> now we’re trying to re-figure this beast that is the new Halloween. So there {{is a bit of a}} delay, but this new Halloween isn't going to be quite what has been announced and what people are expecting, so we're making some changes there as well." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the success}} the single reached, {{it would be}} one of the Kinks' final hits in either Britain or America, ending the {{comeback}} the band had during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Ray said in 1996, [...] " [...] wanted to quit in 1984, after 'Come Dancing.' I felt that that was the end of an era for the Kinks, and I wanted to stop the treadmill and <b>step</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> reappraise the whole thing, but we had another album to deliver. It seemed like we always had another album to deliver." [...] Mick Avory left the band in 1984, a year after [...] "Come Dancing" [...] peaked in the USA. He later said, [...] "I think leaving after a world wide hit with 'Come Dancing' was a good note to leave on." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{a review}} of the book in World Literature Today, Sheila Roberts said that Gordimer's mixture of first- and third-person {{narrative}} is [...] "an interesting device" [...] which is [...] "superbly handled" [...] by the author. She commented that it allows the reader to get inside Rosa, and then <b>step</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> observe her from a distance. Roberts described Gordimer's handling of Rosa's predicament, continuing the role her father had given her versus abandoning the struggle and finding herself, as [...] "extremely moving and memorable". In The Sewanee Review Bruce King wrote that Burger's Daughter is a [...] "large, richly complex, densely textured novel". He said that it [...] "fill with unresolvable ironies and complications" [...] as Gordimer explores the dilemmas faced by her characters in the South African political landscape.|$|E
500|$|Mitchell {{maintains}} {{a level of}} decorum around General Landry (Beau Bridges), but is more laid-back around the SG-1 members. Michael Shanks (Daniel Jackson) and Browder {{did not want to}} repeat the [...] "cliché" [...] original O'Neill-Daniel dynamic where views on military and diplomacy clash. The actors tried to find some commonality between the characters while trying to develop an entertaining rapport between them. By mid-season 9, their interaction had become playful, without being decidedly positive or antagonistic. Although Mitchell and Teal'c (Christopher Judge) are both warriors and leaders, Teal'c is taken aback by Mitchell's enthusiasm at first, as he is more used to O'Neill's reserved attitude. Teal'c is unsure if he likes Mitchell, but Mitchell forces Teal'c to interact with him. By not letting Teal'c <b>step</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> observe, Mitchell makes Teal'c an active part of the scene.|$|E
500|$|Several {{other critics}} have {{commented on the}} live-action sequence. Mediaite's Tommy Christopher wrote in a column that the episode was [...] "capped off by a pitch-perfect parody of The Muppet Show, but veered into adult humor {{that would make the}} Muppet-inspired pottymouths of Avenue Q blush." [...] He commented that the part where Moe thinks he is kissing Perry's bellybutton and she tells him not to stop [...] "has got to be a first on network television, {{breaking}} the dual taboos of oral sex and puppet-on-human conjugal bliss." [...] The segment was praised by Germain Lussier of /Film, who gave it {{as an example of how}} the show, [...] "every once in a while, [...] does something so outrageous, we all <b>step</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> marvel at their brilliance." [...] Joyce Eng and Kate Stanhope of TV Guide named the sequence the second top television moment of the week.|$|E
