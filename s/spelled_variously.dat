500|$|Alternative derivations of {{the name}} Holnicote, which was <b>spelled</b> <b>variously</b> as Honecote, Hunecote or Hunecota, have been suggested. It may relate to holegn, the Anglo-Saxon word for holly. Eilert Ekwall {{supports}} the claim that places which start Holne come from the Old English holegn meaning holly, while Stephen Robinson, in his book on local place names prefers an explanation [...] "The Honey Cottage" [...] from the Old English honeg and cot. In the 19th century, the Rector of Selworthy, the Rev. F. Hancock, who {{was said to have}} extensively studied the place-names of his parish, preferred the old English personal name Hùn for the first element.|$|E

2500|$|The word [...] "Allegheny" [...] {{was once}} {{commonly}} {{used to refer to}} the whole of what are now called the Appalachian Mountains. [...] John Norton used it (<b>spelled</b> <b>variously)</b> around 1810 to refer to the mountains in Tennessee and Georgia. Around the same time, Washington Irving proposed renaming the United States either [...] "Appalachia" [...] or [...] "Alleghania". In 1861, Arnold Henry Guyot published the first systematic geologic study of the whole mountain range. His map labeled the range as the [...] "Alleghanies", but his book was titled On the Appalachian Mountain System.

6000|$|Here I must {{endeavour}} {{to summarise}} what Mr. Greenwood has written {11a} {{on the name}} of the actor, and the [...] "nom de plume" [...] of the unknown author who, by the theory, was not the actor. Let me first confess my firm belief that there is no cause for all the copious writing about the spellings [...] "Shakespeare" [...] or [...] "Shake-speare"--as indicating the true but [...] "concealed poet"--and [...] "Shakspere" [...] (&c.), as indicating the Warwickshire rustic. At Stratford and in Warwickshire the clan- name was spelled in scores of ways, was spelled in different ways within a single document. If the actor himself uniformly wrote [...] "Shakspere" [...] (it seems that we have but five signatures), he was accustomed to seeing the name <b>spelled</b> <b>variously</b> in documents concerning him and his affairs. In London the printers aimed at a kind of uniformity, [...] "Shakespeare" [...] or [...] "Shake-speare": and even if he wrote his own name otherwise, to him it was indifferent. Lawyers and printers might choose their own mode of spelling--and there is no more in the matter.|$|E

5000|$|The name of {{the river}} is {{believed}} to be derived from a dock that was located on the river in Victoria, adjacent to a pastoral lease held by Benjamin Boyd.

However, {{there was a lack of}} uniformity in the <b>spelling,</b> <b>variously</b> as Bendoc or Bendock, in relation to a mountain, the river, a parish, and the town near the Victoria and New South Wales borders. In 1966, the Shire of Orbost informed the Victorian government that local sentiment wished to retain the spelling Bendoc.
