60|$|The Vaughan was {{worked by}} a single shaft divided by a strong wooden {{partition}} into two, one of these known as the downcast shaft, that is, the shaft through which the air descends into the mine, the other the upcast, through which the current, having made its way through all the windings and turnings of the roadways below, again ascends to the surface. This <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>working</b> {{by a single}} shaft, however, is very dangerous, as, {{in the event of}} an explosion, both shafts may become involved in the disaster and there will be no means of getting at the imprisoned miners. Nowadays all well-regulated mines have two shafts, one at a distance from the other, but this was less common thirty years back, and the Vaughan, like most of its neighbours, was worked with a single shaft.|$|E

40|$|The dual-task {{paradigm}} recently {{played a}} major role in understanding the role <b>of</b> <b>working</b> memory in writing. By reviewing recent findings in this field of research, this article highlights how the use of the dual-task technique allowed studying processing and short-term storage functions <b>of</b> <b>working</b> memory involved in writing. With respect to processing functions <b>of</b> <b>working</b> memory (namely, attentional and executive functions), studies investigated resources allocation, step-by-step management and coordination of the writing processes. With respect to short-term storage in working memory, experiments mainly attempted to test Kellogg's (1996) proposals on the relationship between the writing processes and the slave <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> <b>working</b> memory. It is concluded that the dual-task technique revealed fruitful in understanding the relationship between writing and working memory because researchers exploited its major advantage, namely its flexibility...|$|R

Officially opened on 1 November 1933 by Ocean Coal Company director Thomas Evans O.B.E. of Pentyrch, the baths were the first such facility in South Wales.|$|R
