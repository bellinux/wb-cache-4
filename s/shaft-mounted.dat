50|$|Design {{features}} of the B and RB engines include 17 capscrews per cylinder head, a cylinder block that extends 3 in below the crankshaft centerline, an intake manifold not exposed to crankcase oil on the underside, stamped-steel <b>shaft-mounted</b> rocker arms (race versions used forged steel rockers), and a front-mounted external oil pump driven by the camshaft.|$|E

50|$|The {{cast-iron}} {{heads were}} designed with hemispherical combustion chambers {{and a single}} overhead camshaft over each head, operating <b>shaft-mounted</b> roller rocker arms. The valvetrain consisted of valves larger than those on Ford wedge head engines, made out of stainless steel and with sodium-filled exhaust valves to prevent the valve heads from burning, and dual valve springs. This design allowed for high volumetric efficiency at high engine speed.|$|E
50|$|Cast iron exhaust manifolds, less {{restrictive}} than units found on previous engines, were {{bolted to the}} outboard side of each head. The new cylinder heads also featured stud-mounted rocker arms, a change from the <b>shaft-mounted</b> LA arms. This last change {{was due to the}} different oiling system of the new engine, as described in the next paragraph. The valve covers on the Magnum have 10 bolts rather than the previous 5, for improved oil sealing. In addition, the valve covers were made of thicker steel than earlier parts, and were installed with a silicone gasket.|$|E
50|$|The 273 (4.5 L) was {{the first}} LA engine, {{beginning}} model year 1964 and offered through 1969, rated at 180 BHP. It had a 3.625 in (92 mm) bore and 3.31 in (84 mm) stroke. It had a mechanical solid lifter valvetrain until 1968 when hydraulic lifters were introduced; hydraulic lifters generally make for a quieter valvetrain. The reciprocating assembly included a cast or forged steel crankshaft, drop forged steel connecting rods and cast aluminum pistons. The valvetrain consisted of a cast nodular iron camshaft, solid or hydraulic lifters, solid pushrods and <b>shaft-mounted,</b> malleable iron rocker arms (stamped steel on later hydraulic-cam engines). These actuated the overhead steel intake and exhaust valves. The cylinder heads featured wedge-shaped combustion chambers with a single intake and a single exhaust valve for each cylinder. Spark plugs were located {{in the side of}} the cylinder head, between the exhaust ports.|$|E
50|$|As {{the truck}} {{features}} a straight-axle arrangement, the TXT-1 is particularly adept at RC-scale rock crawling. In short, the straight-axle system allows the entire axle and chassis to better articulate itself over obstructions while efficiently conforming tire contact patches to the ground. As an aside, the wide gear contact patches and durable axle construction make the TXT-1 a very durable platform for either high-torque crawling applications or overall high-power brushed or brushless applications. The truck performs {{very well with}} no modifications required {{on a variety of}} surfaces, however some choose to lock differentials, change tire and wheel packages, reduce motor <b>shaft-mounted</b> pinion gear tooth count, mount the shock absorbers directly to the chassis and axle (thereby deleting the cantilever assembly), and reducing parts count and relocating electronic components to reduce weight and make the vehicle's weight distribution more advantageous for rock crawling. Advanced setups include cutting the lower portion of the chassis, changing the motor arrangement significantly (single motor setup with an external gear reduction unit), or changing the length of suspension links to modify caster angles and distances between axles and the chassis.|$|E
5000|$|From 1961-1963, Oldsmobile {{manufactured}} its {{own version}} of the Buick-designed, all-aluminum 215 cubic inch V8 engine for the F-85 compact. Known variously as the Rockette, Cutlass, and Turbo-Rocket by Oldsmobile (and as Fireball and Skylark by Buick), it was a compact, lightweight engine measuring 28 in long, 26 in wide, and 27 in high (same as the small-block Chevy), with a dry weight of only 320 lb. The Oldsmobile engine was very similar to the Buick engine, but not identical: it had larger wedge (rather than hemispherical)-shaped combustion chambers with flat-topped (rather than domed) pistons, six bolts rather than five per cylinder, and slightly larger intake valves; the valves were actuated by <b>shaft-mounted</b> rocker arms like the Buick and Pontiac versions, but the shafts and rockers were unique to Oldsmobile. With an 8.75:1 compression ratio and a 2-barrel carburetor, the Olds 215 had the same rated hp, [...] at 4800 rpm, as the Buick 215, with [...] of torque at 2400 rpm. With a 4-barrel carburetor and 10.25:1 compression, the Olds 215 made [...] at 4800 rpm and [...] at 3200 rpm with a manual transmission. With a 4-barrel carburetor and 10.75:1 compression, the Olds 215 made [...] at 4800 rpm and [...] at 3200 rpm with an automatic. The Buick version was rated at 200 hp with an 11:1 compression ratio.|$|E
5000|$|For 1949, Cadillac and Oldsmobile each {{produced}} a new V8 design (the Oldsmobile engine was the 303).Both {{of the engines}} were Overhead valve designs. The Cadillac 331 engine featured a [...] "dry" [...] (coolant exited through an assembly attached directly to the cylinder heads), open runner (requiring {{the use of a}} tappet valve cover) intake manifold, rear-mounted distributor, and <b>shaft-mounted</b> rockers. Crankshaft end play is carried by the rear bearing on the two GM engines. It has the lighter 'skirtless' block where the oil pan flange does not descend appreciably below the crankshaft centerline and they both have a partial integral cast iron clutch housing that compares to the early Chrysler Hemi V8 design. 1955 331 engines went to a lighter [...] "flat back" [...] that bolted to a clutch and flywheel housing {{at the front of the}} transmission.This engine features an oiling system which uses a central cast-in passage between the lifter galleries feeding oil to the cam and crank by grooves machined into the cam bores. A single drilled passage per bearing saddle feeds both cam and crank journals. Shared with the Oldsmobile Rocket V8 is how the lifters are supplied oil through small 'bleeds' instead of placing the lifters directly into the right and left side oil supply galleries. Many early racers would replace the Cadillac hydraulic lifter and rocker assemblies with the solid lifters and adjustable rockers from the Studebaker v8 for operation at higher rpm.|$|E
50|$|Direct {{hydrogen}} cooling {{is employed}} in the stator terminals. The rotor forging is of nickel chromium molybdenum vanadium steel having a minimum yield point of 33.2 ton/in.2. The shaft end which connects to the turbine is deferentially tempered to give additional strength to withstand the severe forces which could be applied under fault conditions on the generator. The first three critical speeds are arranged to be below the running speed. The hydrogen-cooled rotor conductors are formed from silver-bearing hard drawn copper tube. Two tubes in parallel form one conductor and there are six conductors per slot except for the slots adjacent to the pole centres, which contain five. The generator is ventilated by cold gas fed {{to a number of}} radial ducts at the slipring end of the core, which communicate with the axial vent holes in the core and stator teeth. After passing through the axial holes the gas is discharged into the ‘air’ gap through further radial ducts at the turbine end of the core. The gas discharged from the core passes along the ‘air’ gap, together with the hot gas discharged from the outlet holes in the rotor body, to the region between the end windings and a baffle at the slipring end, and thence through one half of each axial cooler to the blower intake. After leaving the blower, the gas is passed through the other halves of the coolers and is delivered to the various inlet regions of the stator core and rotor. Gas is fed to the turbine end of the rotor through axial holes machined in the hub of the blower rotor from an annulus formed between the end bracket and the blower outlet diffuser. Large diameter tubes passing longitudinally through the stator frame connect this annulus to the extreme end section at the slipring end, from which the slipring end of the rotor is fed. The three-stage axial blower mounted on the generator shaft comprises a <b>shaft-mounted</b> sleeve upon which is mounted the bladed rotor disc, a bladed stator casing, a diffuser and an inlet fairing.|$|E

The performance assessment includes electromagnetic torque, electrical efficiency, mechanical efficiency, and total efficiency based on both simulation and experimentation. The effect of electrical loading and stator voltage on both rotor torque and rotor electric power is also considered.

40|$|<b>Shaft-mounted</b> {{gearboxes}} {{are widely}} used in industry. The torque arm that holds the reactive torque on the housing of the gearbox, if properly positioned creates the reactive force that lifts the gearbox and unloads the bearings of the output shaft. The shortcoming of these torque arms {{is that if the}} gearbox is reversed the direction of the reactive force on the torque arm changes to opposite and added to the weight of the gearbox overloads the bearings shortening their operating life. In this paper, a new patented design of torque arms that develop a controlled lifting force and counteract the weight of the gearbox regardless of the direction of the output shaft rotation is described. Several mathematical models of the conventional and new torque arms were developed and verified experimentally on a specially built test rig that enables modelling of the radial compliance of the gearbox bearings and elastic elements of the torque arms. Comparison showed a good agreement between theoretical and experimental results...|$|E
40|$|We utilize two DC motors with <b>shaft-mounted</b> {{encoders}} {{as agents}} of a coupled system, and both manipulate and measure the motors ’ velocities using Simulink graphical inter-face software and QuaRC data acquisition software. We create a mathematical model of the physical system using MATLAB’s System Identification Toolbox, and design a con-trol scheme to drive the motors to a reference input. The control design calculations are facilitated by MATLAB’s well-suited computational resources. We then introduce commu-nication delays into feedback pathways and show how the system stability and performance is affected {{as a function of}} the delay length. The system response is characterized through transient and steady-state regime inspection and frequency analysis. We demonstrate both that the system can be easily scaled to higher orders of complexity and that many scientific and industrial systems can be thus described and tailored with suitable control measures. Such an approach is suitable for control engineering curricula, as it gives concrete pres-ence to the abstractions of control theory and showcases practical, inexpensive methods for constructing control systems.

40|$|Polylogix {{is a team}} {{dedicated}} to the design, build, and testing of a fatigue machine to simulate cyclic loading on a biomedical polymer. This project is sponsored by Endologix, Inc. to provide test data characterizing mechanical material properties of various formulations of polymer used in abdominal aortic aneurysm surgeries. With this project goal, the machine {{must be able to}} test the polymer at body conditions; these include a testing temperature of 37 °C and a cycling frequency ranging from 1 Hz to 10 Hz.

40|$|Digital {{motion control}} area toady is a {{well-established}} one,which {{is believed to}} be first initiated by power electronicengineers in the early seventies. Modern digital controltheory, advances in digital signal processor andmicrocontroller technology and recent developments in powerelectronic devices have made this field a very competitive one. The objective of this thesis is to present some digital motioncontrol techniques that can be applied for electrical drives. This is done by investigating two motion control problemsassociated with electrical drives; namely, precision motioncontrol and sensorless motion control. Application of digital motion control techniques for preciseeccentric rotor positioning of an induction machine with ActiveMagnetic Bearings (AMB) is the first application problemaddressed in the thesis. The final goal is to prepare aflexible test rig for the study of acoustic noise in standardinduction machines with rotor eccentricity. AMB control hasbeen a challenging task for the control engineers since itsinvention. Various types of control techniques - both analogand digital - have been attempted with a lot of success overthe past years. In the application area of rotating machines,the whole concept of AMB control means stabilizing the rotor ofthe machine in the exact center of the radial AMBs andmaintaining that position under magnetic disturbance forcesexerted on it by the stator under running condition. The aim ofthe first part of the thesis is to present several digitalmotion control techniques that would give the user theflexibility of moving the rotor to any arbitrary position inthe air gap and maintaining that eccentric position. The second part of the thesis dealt with sensorless controlof Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors (PMSM) for high-speedapplications. Conventional PMSM drives employ a shaft-mountedencoder or a resolver to identify the rotor flux position. Itis advantageous to eliminate the <b>shaft-mounted</b> sensor byincorporating sensorless control schemes for PMSM drive systemsdue to many reasons. A sensorless control scheme must besufficiently robust and less computationally heavy for it to besuccessful. However, reliable performance of a sensorlesscontrol drive strategy is always an integration of many digitalmotion control techniques. Implementation of fast currentcontrol by overcoming sampling delay in the discrete system isa key issue in this respect. Suitable speed control with areliable controller anti-windup mechanism is also essential. Compensation techniques for the inverter non-idealities mustalso be incorporated to achieve better performance. In thispart of the thesis, all these aspects of a well performingsensorless control strategy for a PMSM are investigated. Frequency dependent machine parameter variation, which is asignificant practical problem against achieving the expectedperformance of these control strategies, is also addressed. Most of the problems addressed in the thesis are related toimplementation issues of a successful control method. Theapproach in this work is to find solutions to those applicationissues from the automatic control theory.

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} the research {{carried out at}} Florida International University's Hemispheric Center for Environmental Technology (FIU-HCET) {{for the fiscal year}} 1998 (FY 98) under the Tank Focus Area (TFA) project ''Waste Conditioning for Tank Slurry Transfer. '' The objective of this project is to determine the effect of chemical and physical properties on the waste conditioning process and transfer. The focus of this research consisted in building a waste conditioning experimental facility to test different slurry simulants under different conditions, and analyzing their chemical and physical properties. This investigation would provide experimental data and analysis results that can make the tank waste conditioning process more efficient, improve the transfer system, and influence future modifications to the waste conditioning and transfer system. A waste conditioning experimental facility was built in order to test slurry simulants. The facility consists of a slurry vessel with several accessories for parameter control and sampling. The vessel also has a lid system with a <b>shaft-mounted</b> propeller connected to an air motor. In addition, a circulation system is connected to the slurry vessel for simulant cooling and heating. Experimental data collection and analysis of the chemical and physical properties of the tank slurry simulants has been emphasized. For this, one waste slurry simulant (Fernald) was developed, and another two simulants (SRS and Hanford) obtained from DOE sites were used. These simulants, composed of water, soluble metal salts, and insoluble solid particles, were used to represent the actual radioactive waste slurries from different DOE sites. The simulants' chemical and physical properties analyzed include density, viscosity, pH, settling rate, and volubility. These analyses were done to samples obtained from different experiments performed at room temperature but different mixing time and strength. The experimental results indicate that the viscosity of the slurries follow the Bingham plastic model, especially when the solids concentration is increased. At low concentrations slurries may behave as Newtonian fluids. The three simulants follow a similar settling rate behavior. This behavior can be explained as a combination of one or more decreasing exponential curves. This means that the particle settling rate of the simulants decreases exponentially as time increases. The pH range for the three simulants was from 8 to 13 at all concentrations. The SRS simulant showed the highest pH, around 12; the other two simulants, Hanford and Fernald, had about the same pH range, from 3 to 9. When comparing volubility of the three simulants at the same concentration, SRS simulant showed higher volubility, followed by the Hanford simulant and the Fernald simulant, in that order. Further work is scheduled for next year (FY 99) in this project, when other parameters like simulants particle size distribution, particle shape, and crystallization behavior will be studied. The same tests performed this period also will be performed at different temperatures for data comparison...|$|E
