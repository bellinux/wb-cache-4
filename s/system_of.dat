This led to Giorgi presenting a paper to {{the congress of the}} Associazione Elettrotecnica Italiana (A.E.I.) in October 1901 in which he showed that a coherent electro-mechanical <b>system</b> <b>of</b> units could be obtained by adding a fourth base unit of an electrical nature (ampere, volt or ohm) to the three base units proposed in the 1861 BAAS report. This gave the constants ke and km physical dimensions and hence the electro-mechanical quantities ε0 and µ0 were also given physical dimensions. His work also recognized the unifying concept that energy played in the establishment of a coherent, rational <b>system</b> <b>of</b> units with the joule as the unit of energy and the electrical units in the practical <b>system</b> <b>of</b> units remaining unchanged.|$|E

Introduction: Non-autonomous <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> differential equations Non-autonomous <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> differential equations play a relevant rôle in many physical theories, describing evolution in terms of either time or any other parameter.
