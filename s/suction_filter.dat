40|$|AbstractObjectivesDecontaminating {{dental chair}} unit (DCU) suction systems in a convenient, safe and {{effective}} manner is problematic. This study aimed to identify and quantify {{the extent of the}} problems using 25 DCUs, methodically eliminate these problems and develop an efficient approach for reliable, effective, automated disinfection. MethodsDCU suction system residual contamination by environmental and human-derived bacteria was evaluated by microbiological culture following standard aspiration disinfection with a quaternary ammonium disinfectant or alternatively, a novel flooding approach to disinfection. Disinfection of multicomponent suction handpieces, assembled and disassembled, was also studied. A prototype manual and a novel automated Suction Tube Cleaning System (STCS) were developed and tested, as were novel single component suction handpieces. ResultsStandard aspiration disinfection consistently failed to decontaminate DCU suction systems effectively. Semi-confluent bacterial growth (101 – 500 colony forming units (CFU) per culture plate) was recovered from up to 60 % of <b>suction</b> <b>filter</b> housings and from up to 19 % of high and 37 % of low volume suction hoses. Manual and automated flood disinfection of DCU suction systems reduced this dramatically (ranges for filter cage and high and low volume hoses of 0 – 22, 0 – 16 and 0 – 14 CFU/plate, respectively) (P< 0. 0001). Multicomponent suction handpieces could not be adequately disinfected without prior removal and disassembly. Novel single component handpieces, allowed their effective disinfection in situ using the STCS, which virtually eliminated contamination from the entire suction system. ConclusionFlood disinfection of DCU suction systems and single component handpieces radically improves disinfection efficacy and considerably reduces potential cross-infection and cross-contamination risks. Clinical significanceDCU suction systems become heavily contaminated during use. Conventional disinfection does not adequately control this. Furthermore, multicomponent suction handpieces cannot be adequately disinfected without disassembly, which is costly in time, staff and resources.

The result is an ultra-light dispersed graphite (thermographenit) used in lots of industries. Graphite intercalation compounds are formed {{as a result of}} the introduction of atomic and molecular layers of different chemical particles between the layers of graphite plates. The object of this work is to obtain a new material by intercalation of graphite followed by thermoshock heating, which could be used for products protecting biological and technical facilities from electromagnetic and thermal radiation. In the present work the parameters of oxidation and of graphite thermoshock expansion in order to obtain graphite intercalation compounds and thermographenit were investigated. The experiments were performed under laboratory non-isothermal conditions. Graphite GAK- 2 obtained from metallurgical wastes was used. First the fraction of + 0, 16  mm with the ash content of 0, 3 % was extracted by scattering. The oxidation of graphite was carried out by potassium bichromate dissolved in concentrated sulphuric acid. The original sample of graphite was mixed with finely grounded potassium bichromate. Then this mass was poured over with 98 % concentrated sulphuric acid when being actively stirred and kept. Then the capacitance for oxidation was filled with distilled water. Decantation was carried out until pH= 7 in the waste water was got. Separation of the oxidized graphite from the main mass of water was carried out by means of a <b>suction</b> <b>filter</b> until pH= 7 was got. Experiments were performed at different ratios of potassium bichromate, sulphuric acid and graphite.

Materials and methods: We developed a surgical <b>filter</b> <b>suction</b> system that we call the VY suction tube. The suction tube assembly consists of a tube filter within a housing assembly. The filter pore size was designed to prevent tissue or bone debris from passing through the filter, though it allows fluid to pass through. A simulated total hip replacement operation was performed to test the efficacy of this new suction device when compared with two other types of tube suction devices. Results: The VY suction tube showed that the mean duration to remove all fluid from a simulated field was significantly shorter than the Pool suction tube (P= 0. 0009) and Frazier suction tube (P= 0. 0012). The study also showed that the VY suction tube has a lower rate of occlusion when compared with the Pool suction tube (P≤ 0. 0001) and Frazier suction tube (P≤ 0. 0001).

50|$|Spathicephalus is an extinct genus of stem {{tetrapods}} (early four-limbed vertebrates) {{that lived}} {{during the middle}} of the Carboniferous Period. The genus includes two species: the type species S. mirus from Scotland, which is known from two mostly complete skulls and other cranial material, and the species S. pereger from Nova Scotia, which is known from a single fragment of the skull table. Based on the S. mirus material, the appearance of Spathicephalus is unlike that of any other early tetrapod, with a flattened, square-shaped skull and jaws lined with hundreds of very small chisel-like teeth. However, Spathicephalus shares several anatomical features with a family of stem tetrapods called Baphetidae, leading most paleontologists who have studied the genus to place it within a larger group called Baphetoidea, often as part of its own monotypic family Spathicephalidae.

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} a) {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} gravel on soil suction and b) establish whether results of standard <b>suction</b> tests using <b>filter</b> paper can accurately represent the value of suction that would be expected in the field. Eight natural soils with different soil gradation and plasticity were used to prepare two types of specimens: a) the “original” specimens (no change compared to the field soil), and b) “sieved” specimens – when the “original” soil was passed through a 2 -mm sieve to meet the standard requirement. Comparisons of soil-water characteristics curves (SWCC) obtained for both types of specimens were made {{to better understand the}} effect of gravel content on total and matric suction. The obtained data indicated that the results of standard tests can significantly overestimate the soil suction. In particularly, it was found that as the gravel content increased from 4. 8 to 19. 6 %, the difference in suction between the “original” and “sieved” specimens increased to 14 % (total suction) and almost 20 % (matric suction). The experimental data showed that the effect of gravel was more pronounced for low plasticity soils, compared to high and very high plasticity soils, in which the influence of gravel on suction was found to be insignificant. Although the “sieved” specimens tended to produce higher values of suction, this tendency might reverse for high and very high plasticity soils when their liquidity index (LI) became positive.

50|$|Although only distantly related, {{another group}} of flat-headed aquatic {{tetrapods}} called plagiosaurid temnospondyls may have resembled Spathicephalus in their feeding behavior. Plagiosaurids, which lived during the Triassic, {{are thought to have}} been bottom-dwelling piscivores that compensated for their weak depressor mandibulae with powerful adductor muscles that would have rapidly closed the lower jaw. They may have rested on the bottom of lakes and rivers with their jaws open, snapping them shut to capture fish. Paleontologist Alfred Romer proposed in 1947 that Spathicephalus was a bottom-dwelling piscivore, but unlike plagiosaurids it would have had weak adductor muscles. In Spathicephalus, plagiosaurids, and many other early tetrapods, a pair of holes {{at the back of the}} palate called the subtemporal fossae function as anchors for the adductors. These fossae are large in plagiosaurids, which is why they are thought to have had powerful adductors. Spathicephalus, however, has smaller subtemporal fossae, meaning that it would have had weak adductors and depressor mandibulae. In 1998, paleontologists E. H. Beaumont and T. R. Smithson hypothesized that Spathicephalus fed on aquatic invertebrates through a combination of <b>suction</b> feeding and <b>filter</b> feeding. To feed, it would have rested on a lake or river bottom with its jaws slightly opened and its hyoid apparatus closing off the throat. When a group of small invertebrates approached, it would have lowered its hyoid, opening the throat and causing a rapid decrease in pressure inside the mouth. Water would then flow into the mouth, carrying the prey with it. Even with weak adductors, Spathicephalus could have shut its jaws before prey escaped, and then raised the hyoid again to force water back out while filtering the invertebrates with its rows of small teeth.|$|R

The death of two engineers by asphyxiation and recent interception of pressurised hypoxic gas by two ground investigation boreholes highlight {{the urgent need for}} research into this hazard which until now has been extremely limited. Glauconite is legally and widely assumed to cause the oxygen loss in confined spaces but this research proves it incapable of doing so. Visual inspection and laboratory analysis, using optical and infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction techniques confirm fresh glauconite within highly oxidised soil samples throughout the lower Lambeth Group and Thanet Sand Formation. The low concentration of pyrite and organic materials eliminates these as alternative causes. A poorly known but common bright blue-green mineral, green rust, is instead shown to be a very potent and plausible reducing agent. However, laboratory analysis under anoxic conditions has yet to prove its existence in the Upnor Formation, largely because of its extremely rapid oxidation, although the results are consistent with its presence in fresh samples. Significant preservation techniques were implemented to prevent oxidation of soil samples prior to laboratory analysis and improvements identified for future research. The presence of green rust during underground construction within the Upnor Formation will have serious implications for {{the health and safety of}} personnel. Measurements of soil <b>suction,</b> using the <b>filter</b> paper technique, show that the air entry value of the Lower Mottled Beds is such that they will act as an impermeable barrier to upward migration of hypoxic gas, trapping it within the underlying Upnor Formation.

(1999) had placed on a filter), sterility or the minimum of 1000 CFU (Smith 1992) would be reached after 113 days, and the complete loss of CFU after 181 days. When dried on the seed, the time it takes S. meliloti 1021 to reach the standard of 1000 CFU is 10 days, and 62 days with an initial cell number of 107 and 2 × 109, respectively. Since this is substantially shorter than the estimates by Boumahdi et al. (1999), the estimated storage time can not be estimated by only using survival rates after the initial decline in CFU, but should take into account the fast decrease in CFU during the early phases of drying. Additionally, when dried in the lag- and stationary phase on a filter under 22 % RH of the air phase Boumahdi et al. (1999) found S. meliloti 2011 to survive for 457 and 138 days, respectively. We determined a storage time of 113 days. This study extended the excellent findings by Boumahdi et al. (1999). The discrepancies between the results {{can be explained by the}} differences in the methods. In contrast to our method, Boumahdi et al. (1999) used <b>filter</b> <b>suction</b> and a much higher concentration of cells. Unfortunately, this group did not provide a bi-phasic survival curve, or used lag-phase cells in their storage time estimations. Furthermore, it is unclear if the cells they had used were growing cells or diluted late stationary phase cells. This is important, since the physiological differences between the two types are expected to have different responses to desiccation (Vriezen et al. 2006).|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on five studies. It {{includes}} the characterization of lipid micro emboli in shed mediastinal blood during cardiac surgery. The reuse of blood directly by cardiotomy suction is a common practice {{in order to reduce}} the need of blood transfusions. In shed mediastinal blood we showed that there is an abundance of lipid particles in the size range of 10 - 60 μm. These lipid particles are also recirculated by the cardiotomy <b>suction,</b> through <b>filters</b> and the plastic tubing in the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) circuit. The lipid particles are quite probably in an emulsified state which renders them hydrophilic and less prone to stick to the plastic surfaces of tubing and filters. With a series of samples from the mediastinal blood and from the arterial circulation we found that the lipid particles are formed during the operation. Probable sites of origin are the bone marrow after sternotomy and the mediastinal fat tissue manipulated during the surgery in order to expose the heart for cannulation. When the blood was collected in a separate transfusion bag and transfused over a short period of time the increase of lipid micro emboli could be detected in the arterial circulation of the CPB circuit. This was measured by using a Coulter counter to analyze and count emboli in a series of blood samples. The Coulter counter was shown in the first study to be a valuable technique to evaluate embolic loads of lipid micro emboli in blood. The lungs act as physiological filters for the circulation. Embolic material is filtered effectively by the lungs. Using this filtering property of the lungs could therefore be an option in retransfusing the lipid laden mediastinal blood gathered during cardiac surgery. Using a pig model and a shed blood phantom laden with radioactive triolein as embolic material, we registered the hemodynamic results of this during CPB. Furthermore we registered the embolic load in the circulation by measuring beta radioactivity in a series of blood samples. We found that the lungs do act to trap a great deal of these lipid particles but these are then to a certain extent recirculated again. This was especially evident when the cardiac output and pressure were increased by a bolus of volume and vasoconstrictors Lipid emboli find their way into the circulation during cardiac surgery, where they can be detected and counted by the Coulter counter. When simultaneously registering micro embolic signals from a transcranial Doppler and counting lipid micro emboli in blood samples taken from the arterial line, we found a strong correlation between the two phenomena. Lipid material was also tagged by beta radioactivity and found to end up in different organs. By comparing two shed blood phantoms, one with nonemulsified lipids and the other with emulsified lipids we found that the lipid embolic matter increases in the circulation and is more easily deposited in the tissue. The overall purpose was to show that lipid micro emboli are released into the shed mediastinal blood during cardiac surgery. When this blood is retransfused, it is the source of a bombardment of lipid micro emboli in the circulation. These emboli are lodged in various organs. Lipid emboli in the emulsified state are more likely to pass into the circulation during retransfusion of shed mediastinal blood. These emboli can be detected by a transcranial Doppler in the arterial circulation of patients undergoing cardiac surgery...|$|R
40|$| of {{compacted}} expansive clays {{exposed to}} salinization path. The chapter also examines {{the influence of}} direction of salt diffusion durin dissipation of osmotic suction gradients on the swell behaviour of compacted expansive clays. Black cotton soil from Karnataka State {{was used as the}} expansive clay specimen to examine these objectives. Inundating compacted expansive clay specimens with (0. 1 M to 4 M) sodium chloride solutions at a total vertical pressure of 6. 25 kPa in oedometer cells exposed the clay specimens to salinization paths. Measurements of changes in swelling strains, matric <b>suction</b> (measured by <b>filter</b> paper method) and pore water chemistry with time provided insight into the relative influence of matric suction and salt diffusion on the kinetics of swell. Examining the time-axial deformation behaviour of compacted specimens exposed to salinization paths in the post-primary swell region delineated the influence of osmotic suction dissipation on the volume change behaviour of compacted expansive clays. The influence of direction of salt diffusion in response to osmotic suction gradients on the swelling behaviour of compacted expansive clay was examined in the following manner. Salt diffusion from external reservoir to soil water (salinization path) was accomplished by inundating compacted clay specimens with 0. 4 M and 4 M sodium chloride solutions in oedometer cells at 6. 25 kPa. Salt diffusion from soil water to external reservoir (desalinization path) was accomplished by inundating salt-amended specimens with distilled water in oedometer cells at 6. 25 kPa. Salt-amended specimens refer to expansive clay specimens remolded with 0. 4 M/ 4 M sodium chloride solution at desired moisture content and compacted to the design density. Experimental results illustrated that compacted specimens dissipated matric suction by absorption of distilled water and sodium chloride solutions. The initial osmotic suction difference was dissipated by inward diffusion of salts; salt solutions absorbed to dissipate matric suction also contributed to dissipation of osmotic suction difference. The compacted clay specimens swelled on inundation with sodium chloride solutions as dissipation of matric suction and the attendant growth of diffuse ion layer repulsion dominated compacted clay behaviour exposed to salinization paths. However exposure to salinization path reduced swell magnitudes of compacted clay specimens from reductions in diffuse ion layer thickness. The time-swell plots of the compacted clay specimens exposed to salinization path categorized into initial, primary and secondary swell regions. Rates of primary swell were 5 to 21 times larger than rates of secondary swell. Experimental data suggested that primary swell develops relatively rapidly as it is linked to rate of matric suction dissipation. Secondary swell developed more slowly as it is controlled by diffusion of salts and adsorption-desorption reactions. Increase in dissolved salts concentration in soil water during primary swell occurs from salt solution absorbed in response to matric suction and salt diffused in response to osmotic suction difference. Comparatively, increase in dissolved salts concentration in soil water during secondary swell occurs from diffusion of salts in response to osmotic suction gradients. Exposure of salt-amended clays to desalinization path caused outward diffusion of salts to dissipate osmotic suction difference and absorption of distilled water to quench the matric suction of the salt-amended specimens. The salt-amended specimens developed greater swell potentials than compacted specimens inundated with distilled water owing to reduction in dissolved salt concentration of soil water and replacement of native exchangeable calcium and magnesium ions by sodium ions. The time-swell behaviour of salt-amended specimens exposed to desalinization path categorize into four regions: small initial swell region followed by large primary swell and small secondary swell regions and lastly a large tertiary swell region. Complete dissipation of matric suction coincides with end of primary swell and both processes terminate in 120 - 240 minutes after inundation for salt-amended specimens exposed to desalinization paths. Further, only small fraction (16 to 18 %) of possible salt extrusion occurs at the end of primary swell and bulk of salt extrusion occurs during secondary and tertiary swell. Secondary swell developed at a slower rate than primary swell, as the rate of osmotic suction dissipation during secondary swell was smaller than rate of matric suction dissipation during primary swell. Likewise, tertiary swell developed at similar or faster rate than primary swell, as rate of osmotic suction dissipation during tertiary swell is similar or quicker than rate of matric suction dissipation during primary swell for the salt-amended clays. Analysis of the laboratory results showed that greater magnitude of outward salt diffusion mobilizes larger magnitudes of secondary + tertiary swell in response to dissipation of osmotic suction difference in case of the salt-amended clay specimens. Comparison of swelling behaviour of specimens exposed to salinization and desalinization paths revealed that the direction of salt diffusion impacts their swelling behaviour. Inward salt diffusion during salinization path reduces the swell magnitude of the compacted specimens. Bulk of the swell occurs during primary swell. Outward salt diffusion during desalinization path imparts a larger swell magnitude to the salt-amended specimens in comparison to the compacted specimen inundated with distilled water. Bulk of the swell occurs during secondary + tertiary swell. Dissipation of matric suction was rapid and coincided with the end of primary swell during salinization and desalinization paths. Bulk diffusion of salts during secondary and tertiary swell was a relatively slow process. Chapter 5 examines alterations in the wetting induced volumetric response of compacted clays from modifications in swell pressure upon exposure to salt solutions at range of total vertical pressures (6. 25 kPa to 200 kPa). The chapter delineates the manner in which dissipation of matric suction (arising due to unsaturated status of compacted clay) and osmotic suction difference (arising due to chemical concentration gradients between soil water and chemical reservoir) impacts the DDL repulsion pressure/swell pressure and wetting-induced volume change behaviour of compacted expansive clays as a function of total vertical pressures (6. 25 kPa to 200 kPa). Alterations in the diffuse double layer repulsion pressure of compacted clays from salt diffusion are calculated based on Gouy- Chapman diffuse double theory. The diffuse double layer repulsion pressures of compacted clays exposed to salinization paths are compared with the oedometer swell pressures. The impact of modifications in swell pressure from salt diffusion on the nature of wetting-induced volumetric strains (swell/compression) experienced by the compacted expansive clay specimens exposed to salinization paths is also examined. The nature of wetting-induced volume change behaviour is analyzed in context of the total vertical pressure to swell pressure ratio of specimens exposed to salinization paths. Salinization experiments are performed in conventional oedometers with the chemical boundary conditions imposed in an “open air” fashion. In the salinization experiments, salt solutions in the oedometer reservoir were in contact with the soil water through wet porous stones. Experimental results revealed that dissipation of initial osmotic suction difference between soil water and oedometer reservoir via salt migration impacted the diffuse double layer repulsion pressure and the wetting-induced volume change behaviour of compacted clays. Osmotic suction varies directly; while, the diffuse double layer thickness inversely varies with dissolved salt concentration of soil water. Consequently, inundation with sodium chloride solutions increase the initial osmotic suction difference {{at the expense of the}} diffuse double layer repulsion pressures developed by the compacted clay specimens. Salt diffusion in response to dissipation of osmotic suction difference reduced the theoretical (DDL repulsion pressure) and experimental swell pressures of compacted clays inundated with sodium chloride solutions. The theoretical swell pressures however greatly differed from the experimental swell pressures. The total vertical pressure to modified experimental swell pressure ratio determined the nature of axial strains (swell or compression) experienced by compacted clays on exposure to osmotic suction gradients. When the total vertical pressure to modified swell pressure ratio less than unity, the compacted clay specimens experienced net swelling on inundation with sodium chloride solutions. Conversely, when the total vertical pressure to modified swell pressure ratio exceeded unity, the compacted clay experienced net compression on inundation with sodium chloride solutions. When the total vertical pressure to modified swell pressure ratio was unity, the compacted clay did experience any net axial strains on inundating with sodium chloride solution. The ingress of sodium chloride solutions in response to matric suction saturated the void spaces of the compacted specimens prior to commencement of compression. As a result, compression strains experienced by the compacted specimens on exposure to salt solutions were mainly contributed by osmotic consolidation strains. The amount of salt diffused into soil water had direct bearing on the magnitude of osmotic consolidation strains experienced by the compacted specimens at given total vertical pressure value. The time-rates of primary consolidation are approximately 20 to 100 times quicker than rates of osmotic consolidation. The much slower rates of osmotic consolidation arise, as this process is mainly diffusion controlled in comparison to primary consolidation that is mainly dependent on the soil’s permeability to water flow under load-imposed hydraulic gradients. Primary consolidation strains exceed the osmotic consolidation strains at total vertical pressures of 100 kPa and 200 kPa on exposing the compacted specimen to 1 M sodium chloride solution. The osmotic consolidation strain exceeds the primary consolidation strain on exposing the compacted specimen to 4 M sodium chloride solution at total vertical pressure of 200 kPa. Chapter 6 develops a method to predict the osmotic consolidation strains of saturated clay specimens upon exposure to salinization paths at constant effective stress, examines the influence of cation exchange reactions on the osmotic swelling strains developed by saturated saline clay specimens upon exposure to desalinization path and osmotic consolidation strains developed by saturated desalinated clay specimens upon exposure to salinization path and effect of variation in compaction dry density and water content on the osmotic swell behaviour of saturated saline specimen exposed to desalinization path and osmotic consolidation behaviour of saturated desalinated specimen exposed to salinization path Experimental results illustrated that for a given osmotic suction difference (∆π), larger osmotic consolidation strains are predicted at the lower range of consolidation pressures (25 - 100 kPa), than at the higher range of consolidation pressures (200 - 400 kPa) as physico-chemical effects dominated the deformation behaviour at the lower stresses, while; mechanical effects (frictional effects, particle interference) became important at higher range of stresses due to proximity of particles and pa...|$|R
