5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the video, soil crumbles down, as Björk appears, buried to her waist in the sand, wearing a golden dress (by Michael van der Ham), a brooch on her shoulder designed by the singer herself and a blue wig, holding a rock. As she starts singing, she divides the rock into two pieces. As <b>she</b> <b>waves</b> the pieces, the sand around her stirs. She then lays the two pieces on the sand, and they become part of two rock sprites, that come out of the sand and start writhing around Björk, while strata emerges from them. In {{the end of the first}} verse, the strata of the two rocky sprites try to unite, as Björk grabs the sand and let it slips out from her fingers. During the second verse other rocks emerge from the sand and revolve around Björk, who dances in the sand. Other rocky sprites spring out of the new rocks and link to the main two, which are still spinning around the singer's head. The two parts are irresistibly attracted to each other and try to unite as they are stroked by Björk. The strata of the rocks morph to form a face, similar to that of the singer. As the chorus begins, Björk disappears in the darkness. The two rocky parts, now united, start to bestir themselves, whilst various rocks on the sand start to erupt. Lava, magma, smoke and fire storm while Björk's face appears in the lava. Every rock erupts noisily, causing a rain of volcanic ash.|$|E
500|$|The Emancipation of Mimi spawns {{yet another}} career-redefining {{hit in the}} sweet, soulful [...] "Fly Like a Bird", an honest-to-God {{religious}} mantra about redemption. Set against a low-key, organ-spiced groove that recalls mid-'70s R, Carey opens with a pretty, wispy vocal and buoyant harmonies throughout the first chorus before <b>she</b> <b>waves</b> her arms, parts the clouds and wails to the heavens as a mile-high wall of gospel background vocals joins in for the crescendo. The flight of 'Bird' from humble call for deliverance into a frenzied ecclesiastic hymn is utterly spine-tingling. A joyful noise.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} a {{dictionary}} definition of the word [...] "diva", before cutting to a parking lot outside of a warehouse. Beyoncé, {{wearing a pair of}} [...] "dangle shades", walks past a car full of mannequin parts into the warehouse. From here, she is accompanied by her two dancers and a variety of high fashion outfits. When she states [...] "Diva's gettin' money..." [...] <b>she</b> <b>waves</b> a fan made of $100 bills. During the bridge to the climax, Beyoncé dances on a single light and then during the climax, she is seen very glossy in another wardrobe choice dancing in robotic movements to the beat with gold punctuating the black and white scene. In one scene, Beyoncé is seen dancing robotically in front of a set of gold-tinted mannequins; while in another, she dances against a wall with two large chains hanging from the ceiling. During the last chorus, Beyoncé is in her last wardrobe change in front of window which is where the paparazzi had taken photos of her. At the end of the song, Beyoncé walks back out to the parking lot. She lights up a cigar and throws the lighter into the car, letting it explode. As she walks away, the intro to [...] "Video Phone" [...] (a track from I Am... Sasha Fierce) plays. The explosion retains its original fiery colors in contrast with the black and white.|$|E

2500|$|The news of Mahagonny spreads quickly, and sharks {{from all}} over flock to the bait, {{including}} the whore Jenny Smith, who is seen, with six other girls, singing the [...] "Alabama Song", in which <b>she</b> <b>waves</b> goodbye to her home and sets out in pursuit of whiskey, dollars and pretty boys.|$|E
2500|$|An Egyptian Difficulty in {{the time}} of Augustus (1885, 35 x 23"), {{otherwise}} known as A Young Girl with Flamingoes, and probably the same as Dance of the Flamingos (1885, oil on canvas, 92 x 61.2cm) was exhibited in the Grosvenor Gallery. [...] The catalogue describes the painting as, [...] "a girl with flamingoes; marble arch over bronze door. [...] A characteristic picture by this artist." [...] In one hand, the girl holds a hoop wound with ivy or a similar vine, and in the other a stalk of grass, which <b>she</b> <b>waves</b> toward {{one of a group of}} tame flamingos, apparently trying to coax it through the hoop.|$|E
6000|$|CLEOPATRA. I hope not. But I can't help crying, all the same. (<b>She</b> <b>waves</b> her {{handkerchief}} to Caesar; and {{the ship}} begins to move.) ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Yes, yes!' said Nicholas earnestly. 'There! <b>She</b> <b>waves</b> {{her hand}} again! I have {{answered}} it for you--and {{now they are}} out of sight. Do not give way so bitterly, dear friend, don't. You will meet them all again.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... [106] The {{following}} {{is part of}} a battle-song of the Turks:--"I see--I see a dark-eyed girl of Paradise, and <b>she</b> <b>waves</b> a handkerchief, a kerchief of green; and cries aloud, 'Come, kiss me, for I love thee,'" [...] etc.|$|E
6000|$|We {{shall see}} her no more [...] On the balcony, Smiling, while hurt, at the roar [...] As of surging sea From the stormy sturdy band [...] Who have doomed her lord's cause, Though <b>she</b> <b>waves</b> her little hand [...] As it were applause.|$|E

60|$|Dick {{looked toward}} the grandstand, trying to single out Dora. Instead, his eyes met those of Minnie Sanderson, and <b>she</b> <b>waved</b> both her banner and her handkerchief.

But <b>she</b> <b>waved</b> her flag at Tom.|$|R
6000|$|MRS. ROBERTS: [...] "No, indeed! She {{may come}} in now with all the {{formality}} she chooses, and I will receive her excuses in state." [...] <b>She</b> <b>waves</b> her fan softly to and fro, concealing a murmur of trepidation under an indignant air, till the portiere opens, and MR. WILLIS CAMPBELL enters. Then MRS. ROBERTS breaks in nervous agitation [...] "Why, Willis! Where's Aunt Mary?" ...|$|E
60|$|Lady Kicklebury looks towards Lady X.: {{she makes}} her {{excellency}} an undeveloped curtsy, as it were; <b>she</b> <b>waves</b> her plumed head (Lady K. is got up in great style, in a rich dejeuner toilette, perfectly regardless of expense); she salutes the ambassadress with a sweeping gesture from her chair, and backs before her as before royalty, and turns to her daughters large eyes full of meaning, and spreads out her silks in state.|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{soldier is}} coming to you!" [...] she says to my mother. [...] "See," [...] and she points into the cup. We all crowd near, and I {{perceive}} a leaf with a stem sticking up from its body like a bayonet over a man's shoulder. [...] "He is almost home," [...] the widow goes on. Then with sudden dramatic turn <b>she</b> <b>waves</b> her hand toward the road, [...] "Heavens and earth!" [...] she cries. [...] "There's Richard now!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "The {{breakers}} call ahead," [...] said Eric. [...] "The shape points yonder, where I hear {{no sound}} of sea. Once before, thou mindest, Swanhild walked the waves to warn us and thereby saved {{us from the}} men of Ospakar. Ever she swore she loved me; now she is surely come in love to save us and all our comrades. Say, shall I put about? Look: once more <b>she</b> <b>waves</b> her arms and points," [...] and as he spoke he gripped the helm.|$|E
60|$|The Stranger-man (and {{he was a}} Tewara) thought, 'This is a very, very {{wonderful}} child. <b>She</b> <b>waves</b> {{her arms}} and she shouts at me, but I don't understand a word of what she says. But if I don't do what she wants, I greatly fear that that haughty Chief, Man-who-turns-his-back-on-callers, will be angry.' He got up and twisted a big flat piece of bark off a birch-tree {{and gave it to}} Taffy. He did this, Best Beloved, to show that his heart was as white as the birch-bark and that he meant no harm; but Taffy didn't quite understand.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, little friend," [...] he murmured, [...] "you spoil me {{with your}} sweet phrases! You set the music playing in my heart--the witch music, I think. Come, we must speak to Estermen," [...] he continued, looking resolutely away from her. [...] "We cannot have him sitting there glum, a death's-head at our feast. Estermen, drink, man! Is this a funeral party? Wake up. Mademoiselle who dances there looks towards you. Why not? You see, <b>she</b> <b>waves</b> her hand. You have waltzed with her before. Ask {{her to sit}} down with us. I have ordered supper. See, mademoiselle approaches, Estermen. More glasses, waiter. Open more wine. There is {{champagne}} here for everybody. Mademoiselle does us great honor. Permit me!" ...|$|E

6000|$|The {{meeting is}} held in College Green and is very crowded, and Maud Gonne speaks, I think, {{standing}} upon a chair. In front of her is an old woman with a miniature of Lord Edward Fitzgerald, which <b>she</b> <b>waves</b> in her excitement, crying out, [...] "I was in it before she was born." [...] Maud Gonne tells how that morning {{she had gone to}} lay a wreath upon a martyr's tomb at St. Michael's Church, for it is the one day in the year when such wreaths are laid, but has been refused admission because it is the Jubilee. Then she pauses, and after that her voice rises to a cry, [...] "Must the graves of our dead go undecorated because Victoria has her Jubilee?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The band {{is playing}} [...] "Dixie" [...] once more. George is coming, and some one else. The girls are {{standing}} in a knot bend the old people, dry-eyed, their handkerchiefs in their hands. Some of the prisoners take off their hats and smile at the young lady with the chiselled features and brown hair, who wears the red and white of the South {{as if she were}} born to them. Her eyes are searching. Ah, at last she sees him, walking erect at the head of his dragoons. He gives her one look of entreaty, and that smile which should have won her heart long ago. As if by common consent the heads of the troopers are uncovered before her. How bravely <b>she</b> <b>waves</b> at them until they are gone down the street! Then only do her eyes fill with tears, and she passes into the house.|$|E
6000|$|Let it {{be noted}} that each of M. De Banville's more serious plays ends with the same scene, with slight differences. In Florise (never put on the stage) the {{wandering}} actress of Hardy's troupe leaves her lover, the young noble, and the shelter of his castle, to follow where art and her genius beckon her. In Diane au Bois the goddess [...] "that leads the precise life" [...] turns her back on Eros, who has subdued even her, and passes from the scene as <b>she</b> <b>waves</b> her hand in sign of a farewell ineffably mournful. Nearer tragedy than this M. De Banville does not care to go; {{and if there is}} any deeper tragedy in scenes of blood and in stages strewn with corpses, from that he abstains. His Florise is perhaps too long, perhaps too learned; and certainly we are asked to believe too much when a kind of etherealised Consuelo is set before us as the prima donna of old Hardy's troupe: ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>waved</b> {{her hand}} in scornful {{repudiation}} of any claim upon him, and went swiftly back to the tent.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>waved</b> him back. Something {{of the old}} look, {{which he}} hated so to see, was in her face.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>waved</b> {{the fairy}} wand three times {{around her head}} and blew a shrill blast upon the magic whistle.|$|R
