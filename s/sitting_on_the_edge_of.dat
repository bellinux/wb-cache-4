5|$|The video {{starts with}} Usher {{sitting on a}} sofa with a {{backdrop}} of his girlfriend. When the verse starts, Usher goes to a wide glass window pane, looking at his girlfriend swimming in the pool. The surface is aflame after she is immersed in the water. In the next scene, Usher and his mistress are having sex. While <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the bed, Usher reminisces about the moments he and his girlfriend had have in the same bed. The bedsheets burn, the scene then cutting to Usher riding a silver right-hand drive Aston Martin DB5 with a British registration - EGF 158B (the car was featured in the TV series Fastlane). The video cuts with the backdrop also burning. Continuing to the car scene, Usher stops as he sees his imaginary girl again. He and dances, executing various hand routines. Video intercuts follow and the video ends with Usher standing. Right before the last chorus, the screen changes from a small screen to a full one with no framework.|$|E
25|$|In 1921 Fred Allen and Nora Bayes toured {{with the}} company of Lew Fields. Their musical {{director}} was a nineteen-year-old Richard Rodgers. Many years later, when he and Oscar Hammerstein II appeared as mystery guests on What's My Line?, Rodgers recalled Allen's act, <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the stage, his legs dangling down, playing a banjo while telling jokes.|$|E
25|$|Ocumicho {{produces}} glazed {{figures of}} devils and other fantasies. The settings for {{the figures are}} whimsical, devils <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> a volcano and a Noah's ark where the animals look extremely tired. Some of the best potters here are women. It is difficult {{to travel to the}} small village but the figures are sold in the towns of Uruapan and in the Casa de las Artesanias in Morelia.|$|E

25|$|Afternoon {{television}} news bulletins during {{the mid to}} late 1970s were broadcast from the BBC newsroom itself, rather than one of the three news studios. The newsreader would present to camera while <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> a desk; behind him staff would be seen working busily at their desks. This period corresponded with when the Nine O'Clock News got its next makeover, and would use a CSO background of the newsroom from that very same camera each weekday evening.|$|E
500|$|When Martin Wood became {{unavailable}} {{during one}} day of filming, Amanda Tapping filled in for him as director. Furthermore, a photo double stood in for Leah Cairns in some scenes when Cairns was unavailable to play Tatha. The outdoor scene that featured Kandyse McClure was filmed in the same slot as [...] "Sanctuary for All", because Wood {{wanted to use the}} present rain. One scene was filmed on the same set that was previously used in Stargate SG-1. In total, [...] "Fata Morgana" [...] contained over 400 visual effects shots, more than any other episode in the first season. The scene where Ashley was <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> a tall building was actually done by having Emilie Ullerup sitting on a green beam, and next to a wind machine. Every visual effects shot made for the [...] "Fata Morgana" [...] webisodes were remastered in the episode.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} begins with Miley Cyrus and Nick Jonas <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> a dark stage where Nick, also playing the {{acoustic}} guitar, and Miley singing the first verse. The video then {{changes to the}} two walking onto the brightly lighted stage, singing the chorus, and then being joined by Demi Lovato and Joe Jonas who sing the second verse. The entire group is then shown on the stage as they sing the chorus. Kevin and Joe Jonas then remove a curtain covering the background of stage to reveal a sky-painted backdrop in which Selena Gomez and Kevin Jonas proceed to sing the third verse. The ending of the video follows the entire group running out of a large stage door and through a [...] "park-like" [...] setting while finishing the song. A crowd of minors also begin running behind the group. The video ends with the group jumping onto and sitting on a couch {{in the middle of}} the park with the crowd stopping in the background to watch the sunset.|$|E

Towards {{the end of the}} ride, near the rhinos, a tree blocks the path meaning that the truck needs to take a separate route though a [...] "dangerous cave", a water effects feature, including the vehicle driving through a waterfall. Whilst there is a roof, passengers <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> of <b>the</b> row are liable to get wet.|$|R
500|$|Dave Kehr gave {{a largely}} {{negative}} review; [...] "The film betrays no human impulse {{higher than that}} of a ten-year-old boy trying to gross out his baby sister by dangling a dead worm in her face." [...] Ralph Novak of People complained [...] "The ads that say 'this film may be too intense for younger children' are fraudulent. No parent should allow a young child to see this traumatizing movie; it would be a cinematic form of child abuse. Even Harrison Ford is required to slap Quan and abuse Capshaw. There are no heroes connected with the film, only two villains; their names are Steven Spielberg and George Lucas." [...] The Observer described it as [...] "a thin, arch, graceless affair." [...] The Guardian summarized it as [...] "a two-hour series of none too carefully linked chase sequences ... <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> your seat gives you a sore bum but also a numb brain." [...] Leonard Maltin gave the movie only 2 out of 4 stars, saying that the film is [...] "headache inducing" [...] and [...] "never gives us a chance to breathe", and chiding the gross-out' gags." ...|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews were so critical. Rich Rosell from Digitally Obsessed {{awarded the}} episode 4 out of 5 stars. Although {{he noted that}} the episode was [...] "not Gilligan's best work" [...] and that the writing was [...] "a little spotty", he said [...] "the vibe [...] is very well done." [...] Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, gave the episode a {{moderately}} positive review, writing [...] "My heart wasn't racing and I wasn't <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> my seat as Mulder and Scully unmasked our two magicians [...] But it was fun to put the clues together to see what it all added up to." [...] Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B+" [...] and wrote that he [...] "love it". He praised the episode's [...] "good-naturedness", which he felt was due to Mulder and Scully's interaction. Handlen also enjoyed the writing, noting that the [...] "script also does a good job at doling out its secrets in a way that never makes either the magicians or our heroes come off as idiots". Paul Spragg of Xposé wrote positively of the episode, describing it as a [...] "rather fun tale".|$|E
500|$|The video {{starts with}} a news anchor (played by Kristina Mitchell) saying {{the title of the}} song above a news banner that reads [...] "Britney Spears song lyrics spell out {{obscenity}} in disguise". This is a parody of an America's Newsroom report by Megyn Kelly. It then skips to a house, in which a sex party is coming to an end. Spears starts singing while <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> a bed while the people that surround her are getting dressed. She gets up and looks out the window. As the first verse ends, she picks up a pair of panties from the floor, recalling her personal struggles and the [...] "Piece of Me" [...] video. She dances with four male dancers in the first chorus. During the second chorus, she dances with four other female dancers dressed in cheerleading outfits, while many men are watching them dance. The screen fades to white and Spears begins to change into a conservative '50s-inspired housewife outfit. As the chorus begins again, she comes out of her bedroom. She walks down the stairs, with dancers surrounding her and a woman gives her a potholder, which she uses to pick up a pie. After this, she walks out {{the front door of the}} house and is joined by her seemingly conservative-looking husband and children, one of them dressed with the schoolgirl outfit Spears wore in the [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] video. As they go down the walkway, they are surrounded by paparazzi, who have no idea what goes on behind closed doors. While the kids and husband wave, Spears smiles for the camera and blows a kiss. The video then ends with the news anchor saying, [...] "Doesn't make any sense, does it?".|$|E

6000|$|... "It {{was a great}} leap, and as my feet {{struck the}} ground and my eyes glanced rapidly about me a feeling of great joy filled my breast. I was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> earth again, master of myself, and the tiger was not there. I looked upward. The great beast was drawing up his hind legs and was {{climbing}} into the car, and there was Irene, my Irene, outside of <b>the</b> car, <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> and holding <b>on</b> to <b>the</b> ropes.

2500|$|The ghost {{boy at the}} bridge: At one of {{the bridges}} over Clinton Brook (Dead Man's Curve) near the reservoir, {{if you put a}} quarter {{in the middle of the}} road where the yellow line is, at midnight it will {{supposedly}} be promptly returned by the ghost of a boy who drowned while swimming below or had fallen in while <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the bridge. In some tellings an apparition is seen; in others the ghost pushes the teller into the water if they look over the side of the bridge, in order to save them from being run over as he was in life.|$|E
2500|$|Critically, {{the episode}} {{was very well}} received. The reveal also shocked IGN TV's {{editor-in-chief}} Brian Zoromski, leading him to declare that [...] "The Janus List" [...] was [...] "a great season finale" [...] {{in the midst of}} an unimpressive year of season finales. [...] Cynthia Boris of DVD Verdict stated that the episode [...] "had me literally <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> my seat" [...] and called the episode [...] "incredible" [...] and [...] "a lollapalooza". [...] Jeffrey Robinson, a DVD Talk reviewer, called [...] "The Janus List" [...] "wild". [...] Donald Liebenson, an editor for Amazon.com, stated that [...] "The Janus List" [...] was [...] "thrilling and suspenseful".

2500|$|At the conclave, [...] "it was, if not Ratzinger, who? And as {{they came}} to know him, the {{question}} became, why not Ratzinger?" [...] On 19 April 2005, he was elected {{on the second day}} after four ballots. Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor described the final vote, [...] "It's very solemn when you go up one by one to put your vote in the urn and you're looking up at the Last Judgement of Michelangelo. And I still remember vividly the then Cardinal Ratzinger <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> his chair." [...] Ratzinger had hoped to retire peacefully and said that [...] "At a certain point, I prayed to God 'please don't do this to me'...Evidently, this time He didn't listen to me." [...] Before his first appearance on the balcony of Saint Peter's Basilica, he was announced by Jorge Medina Estévez, Cardinal Protodeacon of the Catholic Church. Cardinal Medina Estévez first addressed the massive crowd as [...] "dear(est) brothers and sisters" [...] in Italian, Spanish, French, German and English, with each language receiving cheers from the international crowd, before continuing with the traditional Habemus Papam announcement in Latin.|$|E

40|$|Based on {{simulation}} data we {{show that}} <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> graphite atoms of a HOPG surface have remarkable influence on water contact angle values. Compared to graphite basal plane, a water droplet <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> atoms experiences two effects on wettability, smaller density of surface carbon atoms {{and the appearance of}} the Wenzel states. The differences between contact angles recorded for samples containing different amounts of <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> atoms are large, even after carbon surface oxidation. Thus, we report anisotropic wettability of the graphite surface. Moreover, changing <b>the</b> content of <b>edge</b> atoms in <b>the</b> substrate, one can induce switchable hydrophilic/hydrophobic properties of graphite...|$|R
