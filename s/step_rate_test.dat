Although these tests are routinely used in conventional oil and gaswells, little research on their behavior or possible application to CO 2 storageoperations has been performed. The primary aim of this work has beento study shut-in and step-rate tests in CO 2 injection wells. This has beendone through collecting and comparing published data and experiences, andby performing simulations. The multiphase flow simulator OLGA was usedto build a saline aquifer injection well model, in which shut-in and step-ratetests were simulated. In addition, the OLGA model was used to simulate wateralternating CO 2 (WAG) injection, which is used in enhanced oil recovery(EOR). The aim of the WAG simulations was to investigate what pressureand temperature responses can be expected in the well during WAG injection. The published data found on shut-in and step-rate tests showed the importanceof the well being thermally stable before the tests are commenced, andenough fluid having been injected before test start to mitigate any near wellskin effects. The OLGA model was used to successfully history match thebottom hole data from one <b>step</b> <b>rate</b> <b>test,</b> with partial success in matchingwellhead data. It was not found possible to match the bottom hole data ofa shut-in test performed on the same well, casting doubt on OLGA's abilityto simulation injection well shut-ins.

While pressure effects were found to stabilize quickly, temperature effects were found to work on a substantially longer time scale.

40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringIn the {{petroleum}} industry pressure (stress) dependent permeability {{is usually not}} considered in reservoir simulations. It’s often {{due to lack of}} laboratory and field data, which determines the level of pressure (stress) dependency. Neglecting pressure (stress) dependency in a reservoir model may cause troubles in history matching and reduce forecast capability. This study focuses on numerical simulation of well test responses for pressure (stress) sensitive formations and interpretation of these responses with analytical models. The goal is to show the value of conventional well testing theory in estimating characteristics of stress-­‐sensitive reservoirs. Generally, a stress-­‐sensitive reservoir may be addressed in coupled simulation of fluid flow and geomechanics where the reservoir properties i. e. permeability are considered as stress-­dependent. However, in a conventional reservoir simulation workflow (only fluid flow) these properties may be considered as pressure-­‐dependent. In principle, permeability is a function of effective stress, but in practice a function of pressure may be used as a simplifying assumption. The thesis investigates dynamic permeability change as a function of pressure in stress-­‐sensitive reservoirs using a conventional reservoir model. The simulations include hydraulic fracture and non-­‐fractured formation. Induced fractures have a strong impact on fluid flow in formations, governing flow paths and sweep efficiency. It was assumed that the numerical simulations provide synthetic well test responses that represent real pressure measurements from a field. Analytical solutions based on the permeability modulus concept have been suggested in the literature to analyze pressure transient tests in pressure (stress) sensitive reservoirs. This concept is also widely used to approximate results of laboratory studies. Using the concept of permeability modulus, the study presents numerical simulations for pressure sensitive reservoirs. Pressure transients with impact of permeability modulus, fractures and outer boundary effects have been numerically studied in detail. A step-­‐rate test in an aquifer was numerically simulated to assist in determining the pressure dependent permeability. The numerical well test responses obtained with constant and pressure dependent permeability were combined with the analytical model responses generated by the well-­test software where single-­phase flow and constant reservoir properties are assumed. Finally, the synthetic <b>step</b> <b>rate</b> <b>test</b> response resulted from numerical simulation of pressure sensitive reservoir was interpreted step-­‐by-­‐step using analytical models conventionally used in pressure transient analysis. The possibility to estimate correct permeability dependence on pressure using the analytical step-­‐by-­‐step interpretation was confirmed. It was shown that the pressure dependent permeability curve (permeability modulus) may be constructed from the interpreted permeability values. Therefore, this step-­‐by-­‐step interpretation approach may be used to estimate pressure dependent permeability for pressure (stress) sensitive reservoirs from actual field data...|$|E
40|$|The {{determination}} of critical pressure through <b>step</b> <b>rate</b> injection <b>tests</b> {{plays a major}} role in environmental engineering (remediation of contaminated aquifer systems) as well as in oil and gas industry. Critical pressure is the pressure at which fracture is created in an un-fractured formation or it will widen an existing fracture in a formation. The {{determination of}} this value is crucial in oil engineering for better operation of water-floods and has extensively used to increase oil and gas recovery fromtight reservoirs. Injection above critical pressure, not only produce an early breakthrough, poor sweep, reduced oil and gas recovery butalso result in loss of costly injection fluids. On the other hand, injection far below the critical pressure decreases oil and gas recovery from reservoir. For groundwater remediation, the identification ofthe critical pressure is an important issue also for the design of field injection of reagents into the contaminated aquifers. Injection below the critical pressure results in permeation delivery of the reactants, and consequently fairly homogeneous distribution in the proximity of the injection point. In turn, injection above it causes fracturing of the porous medium, fluid delivery along preferential flow paths, even at high distances for the injection point, and a final non homogeneous distribution of the reactant. Permeation or fracturing injection can be preferred in specific cases. To enhance the usefulness of <b>step</b> <b>rate</b> injection <b>tests,</b> the current paper presents a methodology for the determination of the critical pressure for reagent injection in aquifer systems and the interpretation of real tests conducted in a shallow aquifer system in Belgium. Although <b>step</b> <b>rate</b> injection <b>tests</b> have been frequently performed for several years in oil and gas industry by using Newtonian fluids (usually water) in order to access formation properties and to determine the critical pressure, for the first time this technique is applied here to aquifers systems and by using non-Newtonian fluids.

40|$|This thesis {{work has}} been {{conducted}} in cooperation with ConocoPhillips Norway {{and looks at the}} stress development in the Eldfisk chalk reservoir. High injection pressures due to the relatively low permeabilities of chalk reservoirs are known to form tensile fractures (Rod and Jørgensen 2005). Tensile fractures may lead to bypassing of hydrocarbons and early water breakthrough in producers. Knowing when and if tensile fractures will form is therefore important to ensure maximum recovery. Analysis of 32 minifrac falloff tests have shown that the Eldfisk minimum principal stress (������ℎ) conforms to a linear trend {{as a function of the}} pore pressure gradient. A linear regression model has been proposed for the closure gradient, with a slope of 0. 72 and intercept of 0. 31 psi/ft. A linear trend is seen for the closure stress data despite significant pore collapse and inelastic deformation, suggesting that plastically deformed chalk continues to behave partially elastic. Analysis of 10 minifrac <b>Step</b> <b>Rate</b> <b>Tests</b> have shown that the additional pressure required to initiate a fracture is on average 600 psi above the closure stress. The difference is independent of pore pressure, and indicates relatively uniform redistribution of stress around the horizontal wellbores. Pressure Transient Analysis of minifrac <b>Step</b> <b>Rate</b> <b>Tests</b> have shown that valuable information on fracture mechanics can be extracted from short test durations. The results indicate that completed zone lengths will influence the fracture development, and suggests that varying fracture half-length may be a consequence in wells with large variation in perforation zone lengths. Time-lapse Pressure Transient Analysis of two injection wells on the Eldfisk Field (B- 22 and B- 8 B) has indicated no tensile fracture growth despite high injection rates and pressures. However, up to ~ 4 -times increase in reservoir conductivity was seen in the area around B- 8 B, while no significant change was seen around B- 22. A conceptual model has been proposed that uses the minimum principal stress to explain the difference in B- 8 B and B- 22 behavior. The increase in conductivity around B- 8 may be a result of natural fracture network expansion when the injection pressures exceed the closure stress. B- 22 sees no change as injection pressures are below the local closure stress. Stress arching is believed to be important as it reduced the closure stress on the crest and increases the closure stress on the flanks. Chemical alterations induced as part of a water weakening mechanism are proposed to influence the conductivity development in areas around injectors. Core experiments indicate that seawater flowing through the natural fracture networks could lead to significant chemical alterations in and around the fractures (Madland et al. 2015). These alterations may lead to partial filling of the fractures, influencing the fracture permeability and reducing the stress dependency of the fracture network conductivity...|$|R

Concentrated {{suspensions}} of microscale and nanoscale zerovalent iron particles (MZVI and NZVI) {{have been}} studied in recent years for the remediation of contaminated aquifers. In {{the framework of the}} research project AQUAREHAB (FP 7 - G. A.

Approach/Activities. A shear thinning guar gum solution (2 g/l) was selected as an environmentally friendly stabilizer of the iron particles. The relevant properties of the iron slurry (iron particles size and concentration, polymeric stabilizer type and concentration, slurry viscosity) were designed in the laboratory based on several tests (namely iron reactivity tests towards contaminants, sedimentation tests and rheological measurements). Since the injection regime of iron slurries depends on subsurface geotechnical parameters, aquifer hydraulic conductivity, and fluid properties, a specific injection well and monitoring strategy have been developed in order to achieve high discharge rates and radii of influence, and a more homogeneous distribution of the iron particles through low pressure injection. The injection well has been designed and sealed in order to sustain average to high discharge rates, preventing the daylighting of the product.

Motion capture, ground reaction forces, and EMG on 5 muscle groups (tibialis anterior, vastus lateralis, biceps femoris, medial head of gastrocnemius, and soleus) were recorded. A series of one-way repeated measures ANOVAs found significant (p< 0. 05) differences in all variables for both Parts.

The forward <b>stepping</b> <b>rate</b> was proportional to the ATP concentration, whereas the backward <b>stepping</b> <b>rate</b> was independent.

40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} test—retest {{reliability}} of the StepWatch Activity Monitor outputs over two periods, a week apart, in participants with stroke. Design: Test—retest reliability study over monitoring periods of one, two and three days. Setting: Participant's usual environment. Participants: Forty participants {{more than six months}} post stroke. Main measures: StepWatch outputs: total step count, number of steps at high medium and low <b>stepping</b> <b>rates,</b> sustained activity indices, peak activity index. Results: The intraclass correlation coefficients were high for all StepWatch outputs and all monitoring periods but were highest for the three-day monitoring period (0. 930 — 0. 989) and lowest for the one-day monitoring period (0. 830 — 0. 950). The coefficient of variation ranged from 6. 7 % to 48. 7 % over the monitoring periods, with higher variation shown for shorter monitoring periods. The most reliable four outputs had 95 % limits of agreement between three-day periods that were less than 40 %. These were total step count (± 37. 8 %), highest <b>step</b> <b>rate</b> in 1 minute (± 23. 0 %), highest <b>step</b> <b>rate</b> in 5 minutes (± 38. 6 %) and peak activity index (± 29. 8 %). The highest <b>step</b> <b>rate</b> in 1 minute was the only StepWatch output that had 95 % limits of agreement less than 40 % for the two-day (± 31. 2 %) and one-day (± 36. 7 %) monitoring periods. Conclusions: Total step count, highest <b>step</b> <b>rate</b> in 1 minute, highest <b>step</b> <b>rate</b> in 5 minutes and peak activity index have good test—retest reliability over a three-day monitoring period, with lower reliability shown by the other StepWatch outputs. In general, monitoring over one or two days is less reliable...|$|R

40|$|Mechanical {{laboratory}} testing {{and interpretation of}} injection tests of the Longyearbyen CO 2 storage pilot are used to evaluate geomechanical conditions for safe CO 2 storage. The {{laboratory testing}} program includes compressive and tensile strength tests of overburden and reservoir core samples, and the injection program consists of various types of injection tests at different depths from the shallow aquifer down to the targeted sandstone reservoir. Water injection <b>tests</b> (leak-off, <b>step</b> <b>rate</b> and fracture <b>tests)</b> were analysed to determine fracture pressure for cap-rock and reservoir formations, and fracture closure pressure for some intervals. In addition, laboratory tests, well-log data and empirical correlations were used to analyse compressive and tensile strength vs. depth. Laboratory tests showed that despite the shallow depth of the reservoir, less than 700 m, the strength and stiffness of intact material is very high, {{and that there is}} significant strength anisotropy in the shale units. The high tensile strength of intact formations in combination with the presence of pre-existing fractures makes fracturing of the intact intervals very unlikely. Interpretation of the injection tests indicates that fracture pressure has a higher magnitude and gradient in the overburden than in the reservoir. In the overburden, fracture closure stress representing the minor horizontal stress is slightly lower than the vertical stress. Fracture pressure in the reservoir interval is significantly less than the vertical stress, which suggests horizontal stress to be the minimum principal stress. Therefore, opening of pre-existing vertical to subvertical fractures is considered the most likely fracturing mode in the reservoir, whereas in the overburden it is uncertain due to the marginal difference between vertical and horizontal stresses...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Pedometers are {{commonly}} used to count accumulated steps while walking and thereby provide a measure of exercise volume. The benefits of exercise and physical activity are also determined by the intensity of exercise, and most physical activity guidelines now include specific recommendations about exercise intensity. This study aimed to determine whether older adults are able to monitor and adhere to a prescribed walking <b>step</b> <b>rate</b> (<b>steps</b> per minute) using a pedometer. Methods: Forty subjects (20 male and 20 female) aged 55 – 75 years participated in the study. Subjects visited the testing venue on four occasions, each separated by at least 72 h, to undertake a series of walking tests on an outdoor athletics track. The first walking test was a three-stage “calibration test” where subjects initially walked 800 m at their self selected pace (SS) to determine average heart rate (SS-HR). After a 2 -min rest, {{this was followed by}} an 800 m walk at a higher pace (HI) where the target heart rate was SS-HR plus 10 bpm, and then a low paced walk (LO) at a target heart rate of SS-HR minus 10 bpm. Steps completed, average walking speed (distance /time), average <b>step</b> <b>rate</b> (number of <b>steps</b> /time), and average heart rate were measured at each pace. During each of the next three visits, subjects completed a 1400 m pedometer-paced walk at either the LO, HI or SS pace, in a random order. Walking pace was governed by the respective <b>step</b> <b>rate</b> determined during the calibration test. Subjects wore a pedometer and were given a hand-held card that listed the total number of steps that were to be accumulated after each minute during the walk. Comparisons were made between LO, HI and SS pedometer-paced walks and the respective stages of the calibration test using repeated measures analysis of variance. Results/conclusion: Average <b>step</b> <b>rate,</b> walking speed and heart rate increased with walking pace and were significantly different between the LO, HI and SS walking intensities. There was no difference in <b>step</b> <b>rate</b> between the pedometer-paced walks and the respective stages of the calibration test, indicating that subjects were able to maintain the prescribed <b>step</b> <b>rate.</b> Despite this, average walking speed was higher during the pedometer-paced walks than during the calibration test, and this difference was consistent (7 %) across all walking intensities. Heart rate during the LO pedometer paced walk was lower than during the calibration test, but this difference was not evident at the SS and HI walking intensities. These data indicate that older adults are able to maintain a prescribed <b>step</b> <b>rate</b> using a pedometer; however it does not seem likely that walking speed and physiological responses can be accurately predicted during pedometer-paced walking...|$|R

Patients and methods: A total of 40 patients with moderate-to-severe COPD (mean forced expiratory volume in 1  second: 45. 7 (± 14. 7), % predicted) performed four 3 -MSTs at randomly assigned <b>stepping</b> <b>rates</b> of 14, 16, 20 and 24  steps/min after inhalation of nebulized ipratropium bromide (500  µg) /salbutamol (2. 5  mg) and saline placebo, which were randomized to order. Patients rated their intensity of perceived dyspnea at the end of each 3 -MST using Borg 0 – 10 category ratio scale. Results: A total of 37 (92. 5 %), 36 (90 %), 34 (85 %) and 27 (67. 5 %) patients completed all 3  minutes of exercise at 14, 16, 20 and 24 steps/min under both treatment conditions, respectively. Compared with placebo, ipratropium bromide/salbutamol significantly decreased dyspnea at the end of the third minute of exercise at 14 steps/min (by 0. 6 ± 1. 0 Borg 0 – 10 scale units, P 0. 05).

Each subject completed 3, 5 -minute workIoads at resistance level 3 on the NSS. They stepped {{in time with}} a metronome set at predetermined rates of 48, 56, and 66 steps per minute (spm), respectively. During all exercise sessions HR and RPE were recorded and expired air was analyzed using an automated open-circuit gas system each minute. There were no significant (p >. 05) differences among <b>step</b> <b>rates</b> for VO 2, (1. min- 1, ml. kg- 1 min- 1), RER, or kcal-min- 1. Heart rate was significantly (p <. 05) lower at rate 48 compared to rates 56 and 64. Peak VO 2, and HR at rate 64 were 25 ml-kg- 1 min- 1 and 145 bpm. Step height was significantly (p <. 05) lower at rate 64. Total work (step height x spm) was significantly (p <. 05) different at each <b>rate</b> of <b>stepping.</b> At a constant workload of 3 on the NSS, variations in <b>step</b> <b>rate</b> did not affect VO 2, and thus, energy expenditure.

This hampers measurement of interbeat intervals (IBIs) and oxygen saturation (SpO 2). Our objective was to develop a generic algorithm to remove periodic motion artifacts, recovering artifact-reduced PPG signals for beat-to-beat analysis. Methods: The algorithm was retrospectively evaluated on forehead PPG signals measured while walking on a treadmill. The <b>step</b> <b>rate</b> was tracked in a motion reference signal via a second-order generalized integrator with a frequency-locked loop. Two reference signals were compared: sensor motion relative to the skin (Δx[n]) measured via self-mixing interferometry and head motion (av[n]) measured via accelerometry. The <b>step</b> <b>rate</b> was used in a quadrature harmonic model to estimate the artifacts. Quadrature components need only two coefficients per frequency leading to a short filter and prevent undesired frequency-shifted components in the artifact estimate. Subtracting the estimate from the measured signal reduced the artifacts. Results: Compared to Δx[n], av[n] had a better signal-to-noise ratio and more consistently contained a component at the <b>step</b> <b>rate.</b> Artifact reduction was effective for distinct <b>step</b> <b>rate</b> and pulse rate, since the artifact-reduced signals provided more stable IBI and SpO 2 measurements. Conclusion: Accelerometry provided a more reliable motion reference signal.
