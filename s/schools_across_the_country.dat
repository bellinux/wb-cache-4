Klonsky is now a retired professor of education after teaching at several universities, including UIC and the Fischler School of Education at Nova Southeastern University.|$|E
25|$|Alexander Sutherland Neill (17 October 1883 – 23 September 1973) was a Scottish {{educator}} and author {{known for his}} school, Summerhill, and its philosophies of freedom from adult coercion and community self-governance. Neill was raised in Scotland, {{where he was a}} poor student but became a schoolteacher. He taught in several <b>schools</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> before attending the University of Edinburgh from 1908 to 1912. He took two jobs in journalism before World War I, and taught at Gretna Green Village School {{during the first year of}} the war, writing his first book, A Dominie's Log (1915), as a diary of his life as headteacher. He joined the staff of a school in Dresden in 1921, founding Summerhill upon his return to England in 1924. Summerhill received widespread renown in the 1920s to 1930s and then in the 1960s to 1970s, due to progressive and counter-culture interest. Neill wrote 20 books in his lifetime, and his best seller was the 1960 Summerhill, a compilation of four previous books about his school. The book was a common ancestor to activists in the 1960s free school movement.|$|E
25|$|While {{the term}} Polish culture refers {{primarily}} to the Polish-language culture in Poland, the Second Polish Republic also had numerous vibrant national minorities, most notably Jewish, Ukrainian, Belarusian, Lithuanian and German. It was a multicultural society whose ethno-cultural makeup was shaped {{over a period of}} centuries. In 1921 according to the first-ever national census, the Catholic Poles constituted 69.2% of the population, the Ukrainians 14.3%, the Jews 7.8%, the Belarusians 3.9% and the Germans 3.9%. The minorities amounted to 30.8% of the total. The rise of new intelligentsia resulted {{in the development of a}} record number of political parties, lobbies and societies. In a dozen or so years the newspaper readership doubled. In 1919, new universities opened in Poznań, Wilno, and Lublin. Universities in Kraków and Lwów were polonized already five years earlier. The Elementary School Teachers Union was formed in 1919. In the first ten years of Poland's redevelopment, the total number of schools increased by almost 10,000 thanks to the official decree on public education. By the time of the Nazi-Soviet invasion of 1939, some 90% of children were in <b>schools</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> the number limited only by the shortage of qualified staff and lack of adequate locales especially in the villages.|$|E

25|$|Aiken {{has been}} a {{dedicated}} advocate for education and for children's causes. His interest in autism issues led him, along with Diane Bubel (whose son Michael is diagnosed with autism and was tutored by Aiken), to found the National Inclusion Project (formerly the Bubel/Aiken Foundation), which supports the integration {{of children with disabilities}} into the life environment of their non-disabled peers. The Foundation runs summer camps which reflect its mission, and also presents Able to Serve awards to support the volunteer efforts of children with physical and mental disabilities. In July 2005, Raleigh's WRAL-TV reported on an internet campaign mounted by critics questioning how Aiken's foundation used its money. WRAL news hired an independent accountant who reported that program services totaled $920,000 in 2004—around 85 cents on every dollar donated—which is considered a solid percentage compared to other charities. CNN picked up the story, and Aiken appeared on Showbiz Tonight to provide details about the Foundation's programs. In late 2004, the Foundation was awarded a $500,000 grant by the US government to develop a K–12 model for inclusion in community service projects to be used in <b>schools</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> In addition, State Farm granted $1.5million to the Foundation to help develop a primary education curriculum focused on teaching social and life skills through service to children of all levels of ability.|$|E
25|$|St Crispin's School was {{the first}} of the Ministry of Education's {{prototype}} prefabricated schools. It was built between 1951 and 1953 by the Ministry of Education's own team of researchers into rational school building (David Medd and Mary Crowley) under the direction of S. A. W Johnson Marshall. The work was inspired by that of the Hertfordshire Architect's Department. In the post-war years, with an increasing demand for school places, the government was under pressure to reduce costs but without compromising the school building programme. The aim was to establish new levels of cost efficiency for both erection and running costs. The building is of light steel construction with components of modular sizes. The classrooms were all originally located in a four-storey block above the main entrance with a central courtyard and a rambling series of inter-connected mostly single-storey buildings which provided accommodation for a hall, a gym and specialised teaching spaces for arts and crafts. The new techniques speeded up the building process so much that the school was able to open five months ahead of the planned schedule. It is widely believed that the school tower was designed with the potential to be modified to a hospital in times of national emergency though no records have been found to substantiate the claim. The informal layout and unassuming architecture influenced the layout and construction of <b>schools</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> St Crispin's was classified as a Grade II listed building by English Heritage on 30 March 1993.|$|E
500|$|For many {{secondary}} schools around England and Wales in areas without a Middle School, accommodating {{for the new}} 5th year students would be a struggle.

This solution proved popular with many <b>schools</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> not least due to the low cost involved for materials and construction, but also the speed which these buildings could be erected.
