2500|$|Carranza {{took off}} after dark {{during a break}} in {{thunderstorms}} in the New York region. [...] He reported before taking off that he would fly towards Washington and then steer a compass course from there. While flying over the Pinelands of southern New Jersey amidst thunderstorms, he crashed into the woods. [...] Investigators from Fort Monmouth conducted the accident probe to determine what happened. They were able to determine the engine throttle was closed and the <b>spark</b> <b>lever</b> was in the advanced position. This showed he was attempting to land.|$|E
50|$|Early {{automobiles}} {{required a}} hand crank for starting. Occasionally, when the <b>spark</b> <b>lever</b> was not properly set, the hand crank kicked back, causing serious injury: a broken wrist, arm, or shoulder. On a winter night in 1908, {{the result was}} much worse.|$|E
5000|$|The Series 80 and Series 90 used a 344 cu. in. version (bore 3 5/16 in., stroke 5 in.) for 104 brake HP. Automatic vacuum-operated {{spark advance}} was another new feature {{replacing}} the steering column mounted <b>spark</b> <b>lever</b> although an emergency lever was now dash mounted. Buick scored another first in 1939 {{when it became}} the first company to introduce turn signals, which did not appear on other car brands until almost a decade later. [...] All 1939 models also had a steering column mounted shift lever.|$|E
5000|$|Tom {{purchased}} {{a very expensive}} motorcycle from his new friend, Mr. Damon. The model year would have been 1909 or 1910. Tom tweaked the sprocket ratios, <b>spark</b> <b>levers</b> and overall performance of his machine by 15%, as well as increasing its range.|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{about you}} {{folks in the}} other auto?" [...] queried Dave Porter, as he let off the hand brake and {{advanced}} the <b>spark</b> and <b>lever</b> of the machine {{he was about to}} run.|$|R
25|$|Third: See that <b>spark</b> control <b>lever,</b> {{which is}} the short lever located {{on top of the}} {{steering}} wheel on the right side, is back as far as possible toward the driver and the long lever, on top of the steering column controlling the carburetor, is pushed forward about one inch from its retarded position.|$|R

50|$|The {{steering}} column {{passes through the}} straight dashboard and <b>spark</b> and throttle <b>levers</b> worked in sectors inside the wheel rim. All main bearing were lubricated by a force feed lubricator, located {{in front of the}} dashboard. Sight glasses were attached to the left-hand side of the engine.|$|R
50|$|The 1904 {{model was}} a larger touring car. Equipped with a rear {{entrance}} tonneau body, it could seat 5 passengers and sold for US$3500. The vertically mounted water-cooled straight-4, {{situated at the}} front of the car, produced 24hp (17.9kW). A 3-speed sliding transmission was fitted. The channel steel-framed car weighed 2350lb (1066kg). This modern Système Panhard car had <b>spark</b> and throttle <b>levers</b> on steering wheel, a novelty at the time.|$|R
50|$|The {{hand-operated}} {{gear and}} rear-wheel brake controls {{are on the}} driver's right {{but there is a}} door for the driver which there was not on the 30-98 or 25. The <b>spark</b> and throttle <b>levers</b> are on the steering wheel together with an air lever working a valve in the induction pipe (after the throttle). There is also a mixture control (choke) on the dash. Gear and brake levers are well to hand. Accelerator and (transmission) brake pedals were set close together.|$|R
2500|$|The {{ignition}} system {{was similar to}} that of the Model T,with a flywheel-mounted low-tension magneto and trembler coils. The ignition timing was manually advanced or retarded with the <b>spark</b> advance <b>lever</b> mounted near the steering column, which rotated the timer. The cooling was by thermosiphon. (In later decades, a high-tension magneto and a water pump would be added.) The transmission was a three-speed spur gear (the three forward speeds ranged from approximately 2 to 6mph). A worm drive reduction set and a differential made up the rear. The design of the rear was patented for its ease of manufacture and service. Brakes were not provided on early Fordsons, as high-ratio worm sets generally transmitted rotation in one direction only, from the worm element to the gear element, because of the high power loss through friction. To stop the tractor, the driver depressed the clutch.|$|R
5000|$|The Model T engine's {{ignition}} system used a flywheel-mounted magneto {{to produce the}} current necessary to produce a spark to initiate combustion. This current was distributed by the timer (analogous to a distributor in a modern vehicle) {{to one of the}} four trembler coils, one for each cylinder. The coil stepped up the voltage and discharged it to the spark plug in the cylinder. Ignition timing was adjusted manually by using the <b>spark</b> advance <b>lever</b> mounted on the steering column, which rotated the timer, advancing or retarding the ignition timing. A battery could be used for starting current: at hand-cranking speed, the magneto did not always produce sufficient current. A starting battery was not standard equipment until sometime in 1926, though all T's had a [...] "BAT" [...] position ("battery") on the coil box switch. A certain amount of skill and experience was required to find the optimal spark timing for any speed and load.|$|R
40|$|This thesis explores whether {{dialogue}} between {{a company and}} a non-profit organisation (NPO) can influence a company’s way of working towards being more conflict sensitive. As a case-study I analysed the {{dialogue between}} the French oil and gas company, Total S. A. (Total), and the US based NPO, CDA Collaborative Learning Projects (CDA) relating to the company’s operations in Myanmar/Burma. The objectives of the research were to ascertain if dialogue had a positive impact, and if so, {{what it was about}} the dialogue that enabled change, what was the process of change that could be observed and how embedded such change was. Drawing on post-modernism, systems thinking and complexity thinking, I have built on organisational change, conflict transformation, dialogue and cross-sector partnership literature to examine the role of dialogue as an enabler of change. While highlighting parallels in the discourses, I analyse the process and degree of change within the company through two conflict transformation models, one by Lederach (1997) and the other by Lederach, Neufeld and Culbertson (2007), which I feel best synthesise these parallels. The research is a longitudinal case-study (2002 - 2012), based on semi-structured interviews and document analysis. The study adds to the limited academic research on conflict sensitivity in general, and on the implications for a company’s way of working in particular. Although I find that within the business sector, the notion of conflict sensitivity is assumed in the wider concept of corporate social responsibility, noteworthy is the relevance of dialogue in change processes. Dialogue is an essential enabler as it <b>sparks</b> transformational <b>levers</b> also recognised in the literature reviewed. However it is not sufficient. The research illustrates that the dialogue between CDA and Total has {{played a critical role in}} facilitating a shift in the company’s way of working, with the contribution of other influences at play. As such, I draw attention to the complexity of the change process and discuss the current nature of the drivers of change within Total...|$|R
