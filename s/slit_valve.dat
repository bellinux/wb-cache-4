5000|$|The feeder's design {{enables the}} feeder to be {{activated}} by tongue and gum pressure, imitating the mechanics involved in breastfeeding, {{rather than by}} sucking. A one-way valve separates the nipple from the bottle. Before starting the feeding, air is squeezed out of the nipple and is automatically replaced by breastmilk or formula through the valve. Milk cannot flow back into the bottle and is replenished continuously as the baby feeds. A <b>slit</b> <b>valve</b> opening near {{the tip of the}} nipple shuts between jaw compressions, preventing the baby from being overwhelmed with milk. Stopping or reducing the flow of milk is controlled by rotation of the nipple in the baby's mouth. Usually the nipple is marked with lines that indicate zero flow, moderate flow, and maximum flow. For infants who need assistance with their feeding efforts, mother—or whoever is feeding the baby—may apply a gentle pumping action to the body of the nipple.The numbers in the cross section are listed below: ...|$|E
40|$|Various {{complications}} of distal {{end of the}} ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt have been described in the literature. We present, here, an extremely rare and potentially severe complication of vesical calculi formation on the <b>slit</b> <b>valves</b> of distal end of VP shunt which erosively migrated into the urinary bladder. Suprapubic cystolithotomy performed, peritoneal end of the tube found to be eroding and entering into the bladder with two calculi firmly stuck to <b>slit</b> <b>valves</b> in the distal end of the tubing were removed. Shunt was functional, therefore, it was pulled out and repositioned on the superior aspect of the liver; the urinary bladder was repaired. Patient did well postoperatively. This complication was revealed 1. 5 years after the shunt was implanted. Although there were symptoms of dysuria and dribbling of urine of short duration, the patient did not show obvious peritoneal signs; suggesting that, penetration of a VP shunt into the urinary bladder can remain asymptomatic {{for a long period}} of time, disclosed late and can lead to considerable morbidity. Careful follow-up is important and management should be individualized...|$|R
50|$|Lesser mouse-tailed bats {{are well}} adapted {{to live in}} hot, dry climates. They have <b>slits</b> or <b>valves</b> just above their {{nostrils}} which they can open or close at will, helping to keep the dust out. The bats have physiological control over their kidneys to reduce water loss. During the hot months, these bats move into covered shelters to escape the heat.|$|R
50|$|They are small, {{delicate}} acrocarpous mosses (meaning {{that the}} capsules are formed at {{the tips of}} vertical branches) that form dark brown or reddish cushions on wet siliceous rocks in mountainous areas. The capsule lacks the peristome teeth and operculum of other mosses, and opens by splitting along 4 vertical <b>slits,</b> the four <b>valves</b> remaining joined at the base and apex. The capsule of Andreaea has no seta, but the sporophyte (Spf in the diagram below) instead {{is supported by a}} pseudopodium (ps) derived from gametophyte tissue, as in Sphagnum and the columella is enclosed within the sporangium. The spores germinate to give thalloid protonemata.|$|R
5000|$|Small perfect flowers, actinomorphic or obliquely zygomorphic, usually pentamerous, sepals, petals and stamens {{arranged}} in opposed whorls. Hypogynous disc present, thin, annular, nectariferous, with lobes (sometimes with hardened discoid glands) alternating with the stamens, sometimes with bifid-shaped teeth. Sepals (4-)5, in a whorl, free or basally fused, equal {{or with the}} 2 internal sepals much smaller, imbricate. Petals (4-)5, in a whorl, free, equal or the 2 internal petals often much smaller (sometimes bifid), imbricate, oppositisepalous, more or less fleshy. Androecium of (4-)5(-6) elements, 5 stamens or even 2 (opposed to the internal petals) and 3 staminodes, oppositipetalous, free from each other but fused {{at the base of}} the petals, filiform filaments, expanded below the anther or forming a collar, unilocular anthers, dithecal, introrse and bent down, enclosed in external cavities belonging to the adjacent staminode, more or less adherent between themselves, leaving a central pore through which the style passes, or even extrorse, connective strongly expanded, dehiscence through transversal <b>slits</b> or <b>valves.</b> Superior gynoecium, of 2(-3) carpels, hemicarpic with apically free styles (stylodious) or sincarpic with one short cylindrical or conic style, capitate stigmas, punctate and moist, or not papillose and dry, ovules (1-)2 per carpel, hemianatropous to campylotropous, apotropous, unitegmic and crasinucelated, horizontal or pendulous, axial placentation.|$|R
40|$|Diagnosis {{of engine}} trouble has been {{performed}} {{by measuring the}} various pressures and temperatures in a running engine. It is often impossible to locate engine trouble with this method. In certain cases, a skilled mechanic may find machine problems by listening to the sound made by the components suspected of causing the trouble; but only by removing and evaluating these components, can be make his hypothesis. In this paper, the means of analysis and discrimination of the engine noise are investigated to diagnose engine troubles. In terms of engine troubles, we have chosen two cases : the first is an increase of clearance between the exhaust valve and the rockerarm; the second involves a blow-by phenomenon through a <b>slit</b> on a <b>valve.</b> The experiments were carried out on {{two different types of}} engines. It then becomes possible to know where the trouble occurs and its cause by investigating the generation time, the power spectrum of noise in each time segment, and the distribution pattern of the spectra...|$|R

The family is represented in Africa only by two small aberrant genera and occurs on the Eurasian mainland only in the Malay Peninsula, the Nicobar Islands and Peninsular Thailand...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies that}} have {{compared}} CT or MRI images of an individual’s nasal anatomy and measures of their olfactory sensitivity have found a correlation between specific anatomical areas and performance on olfactory assessments. Using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques, we have developed a method to quickly (<few days) convert nasal CT scans from an individual patient into an anatomically accurate 3 -D numerical nasal model {{that can be used}} to predict airflow and odorant transport, which may ultimately determine olfactory sensitivity. The 3 -D model can be also be rapidly modified to depict various anatom-ical deviations, such as polyps and their removal, that may alter nasal airflow and impair olfactory ability. To evaluate the degree to which variations in critical nasal areas such as the olfactory <b>slit</b> and nasal <b>valve</b> can alter airflow and odorant transport, inspir-atory and expiratory airflow with odorants were simulated using numerical finite volume methods. Results suggest that anatomical changes in the olfactory region (upper meatus below the cribriform plate) and the nasal valve region will strongly affect airflow patterns and odorant transport through the olfactory region, with subsequent effects on olfactory function. The ability to model odorant transport through individualized models of the nasal passages holds promise for relating anatomical deviations to generalized or selective disturbances in olfactory perception and may provide important guidance for treatments for nasal-sinus disease, occupational rhinitis and surgical interventions that seek to optimize airflow and improve deficien...|$|R
