5|$|A few {{vertebrate}} {{species such}} as the Texas horned lizard are able to shoot squirts of blood from their eyes, by rapidly increasing the blood pressure within the eye sockets, if threatened. Because an individual may lose up to 53% of blood in a single squirt, this is only used against persistent predators like foxes, wolves and coyotes (Canidae), as a last defence. Canids often drop horned lizards after being squirted, and attempt to wipe or <b>shake</b> <b>the</b> blood out of their mouths, suggesting that the fluid has a foul taste; they choose other lizards if given the choice, suggesting a learned aversion towards horned lizards as prey.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} part of the crew's schedule was regular exercise. They had three pieces of equipment for this: a stationary bicycle, a treadmill (TVIS), and a resistance device (IRED) for weight-lifting. The bicycle malfunctioned in mid-December 2000, and wasn't fixed until March. The treadmill, which used bungee cords to keep the crew member in place, was designed to reduce the vibrations caused by running. A normal treadmill would have produced enough vibrations to <b>shake</b> <b>the</b> station, and potentially affect the sensitive science experiments on board. The treadmill malfunctioned near the end of February, but some in-flight maintenance fixed the problem within a week.|$|E
5|$|Because {{she is a}} whale {{and most}} other {{characters}} are small tide pool organisms, Pearl is depicted as extraordinarily tall and heavy. Her size {{compared to the other}} characters is often used for visual gags; for example, she is able to <b>shake</b> <b>the</b> entire Krusty Krab when she jumps and can fill the entire building with tears when she cries. The floors of the Krabs' residence are equipped with drain plugs so the house can be emptied after Pearl cries or spouts water from her blowhole.|$|E
5000|$|An early version {{involved}} {{former world}} Heavyweight boxing champion, John L. Sullivan, {{in which people}} would ask others to [...] "shake <b>the</b> hand that <b>shook</b> <b>the</b> hand that <b>shook</b> <b>the</b> hand that <b>shook</b> <b>the</b> hand of 'the great John L.'" ...|$|R

5|$|Forfeit: A {{player who}} cheats, or violates {{the rules of}} the game, or violates the rules {{specified}} for the particular tournament can be forfeited. In high-level tournaments, players have been forfeited for such things as arriving late for the game (even by a matter of seconds), receiving a call or text on a cell phone, refusing to undergo a drug test, refusing to undergo a body search for electronic devices, and unsporting behavior (such as refusing to <b>shake</b> <b>the</b> opponent's hand).|$|E
5|$|In mythology, {{birds were}} {{sometimes}} monsters, like the Roc and the Māori's Pouākai, a giant bird capable of snatching humans. In Persian mythology, the simurgh was a gigantic bird, {{the first to}} come into existence, and it nested on the tree of plant life that grew in the great ocean beside the tree of immortality. Its task was to <b>shake</b> <b>the</b> seeds of all the plants out of the tree.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the election, Dato' Onn Ja'afar {{had changed}} his approach, forming the Parti Negara after IMP {{suffered}} crushing losses to the Alliance in local elections. Advocating stronger pro-Malay policies recognising Malay political dominance, the Parti Negara failed to <b>shake</b> <b>the</b> Alliance's grip on power. However, some believe Parti Negara's proposals helped sway UMNO politicians towards more radically pro-Malay policies. The British themselves insisted on handing over power only to a multiracial government, and the Alliance was considered to meet this requirement.|$|E

5|$|Sinatra {{with a cold}} is Picasso without paint, Ferrari without fuel--only worse. For {{the common}} cold robs Sinatra of that uninsurable jewel, his voice, cutting into {{the core of his}} confidence, and it affects not only his own psyche but also seems to cause a kind of {{psychosomatic}} nasal drip within dozens of people who work for him, drink with him, love him, depend on him for their own welfare and stability. A Sinatra with a cold can, in a small way, send vibrations through the entertainment industry and beyond as surely as a President of the United States, suddenly sick, can <b>shake</b> <b>the</b> national economy.|$|E
5|$|The {{periscopes}} had two problems, {{the first}} of which was shared with the other masts. They were not streamlined; raising a periscope while moving would create enough drag and turbulence to <b>shake</b> <b>the</b> entire submarine. As with many elements of the submarine, there were disagreements as to who was responsible for the problem. It was solved by modifying the masts to redirect the water flow around them (for example, a spiral wrap was fixed around the head of each periscope).|$|E
5|$|We want a {{national}} literature commensurate with our mountains and rivers... We want {{a national}} epic that shall {{correspond to the}} size of the country... We want a national drama in which scope shall be given to our gigantic ideas and to the unparalleled activity of our people... In a word, we want a national literature altogether shaggy and unshorn, that shall <b>shake</b> <b>the</b> earth, like a herd of buffaloes thundering over the prairies.|$|E

5|$|The crew {{spent the}} {{following}} months {{preparing for the}} forthcoming dash for the pole. They built sledges that would facilitate fast travel over rough terrain and constructed kayaks on the Inuit model, for use during the expected water crossings. There were endless trials of special clothing and other gear. Violent and prolonged tremors began to <b>shake</b> <b>the</b> ship on 3 January 1895, and two days later the crew disembarked, expecting the ship to be crushed. Instead the pressure lessened, and the crew went back on board and resumed preparations for Nansen's journey. After the excitement {{it was noted that}} Fram had drifted beyond Greely's Farthest North record of 83°24, and on 8 January was at 83°34′N.|$|E
5|$|The easternmost {{portion of}} NY117 in Katonah {{passed through a}} {{historic}} district containing several homes {{dating back to the}} late 19th century. Following the construction of nearby I-684 in 1968, this segment of NY117 became a truck route between the Interstate Highway and industrial areas along NY117 south of Katonah. While the Saw Mill River Parkway would have provided an alternate route to I-684 from NY117, commercial traffic was prohibited from using the highway. The trucks that used NY117 would <b>shake</b> <b>the</b> historic homes as it passed through the hamlet, causing small amounts of damage to the structures. A study analyzing the issue of truck traffic along NY117 in Katonah began in 1976 {{at the request of the}} town of Bedford.|$|E
5|$|The player flies {{around in}} a fighter with a first-person, in-cockpit view with a fully {{customizable}} fixed head-up display (HUD) as the visual interface. The HUD displays video communications and relevant data on the ship's status and performance, weapons, objectives, and targets. It can also warn players from which direction missiles are locking onto them from, thus becoming an aide for launching countermeasures or taking evasive maneuvers. Players have to maneuver into position and shoot through both shields and hull to destroy enemy ships. While hull damage is unrecoverable, shields recharge over time. With the game supporting force feedback technology, joystick players will find their controllers vibrating or putting up resistance when they engage the afterburners or collide with objects. Similarly, certain events, such as engaging afterburners and firing powerful weapons, will <b>shake</b> <b>the</b> screen {{as a form of}} visual feedback.|$|E

5|$|When {{the chaos}} began to <b>shake</b> <b>the</b> {{confidence}} of New York's banks, the city's most famous banker {{was out of}} town. J.P. Morgan, the eponymous president of J.P. Morgan & Co., was attending a church convention in Richmond, Virginia. Morgan {{was not only the}} city's wealthiest and most well-connected banker, but he had experience with other similar financial crises—he had helped rescue the U.S. Treasury during the Panic of 1893. As news of the crisis gathered, Morgan returned to Wall Street from his convention late on the night of Saturday, October 19. The following morning, the library of Morgan's brownstone at Madison Avenue and 36th St. had become a revolving door of New York City bank and trust company presidents arriving to share information about (and seek help surviving) the impending crisis.|$|E

By 1973, <b>the</b> <b>shake</b> was merely a green colored vanilla <b>shake,</b> eliminating <b>the</b> lemon/lime sherbet. It is now mint flavored.|$|R

25|$|It {{was shown}} {{that during the}} fight in Connecticut, Giant-Man became enraged when the Wasp was killed by Hobgoblin.
