30|$|Hydrovolcanism is {{the term}} that {{describes}} the interaction between meteoric or connate water and lava, magmatic heat, or gases {{at or near the}} Earth’s surface, and it encompasses the physical and chemical dynamics that determine the resulting intrusive or extrusive behavior and the character of eruptive products and deposits (Valentine and Fisher 1999; Wohletz et al. 2013). Hydrovolcanisms contain subaqueous <b>eruptions</b> and <b>subaerial</b> <b>eruptions</b> involved with water. The statistical results indicate that subaqueous volcanic eruptions on the Earth account for 85 % of the global volcanic eruptions, approximately 3.485  km 3 /yr. and well above <b>subaerial</b> <b>eruptions</b> (White et al. 2003), which demonstrate that hydrovolcanisms widely exist in volcanic eruptions. However, due to the difficulty of field monitoring and the high cost of submarine sampling, current research degree of eruption process and petrological characteristics of hydrovolcanisms is still lower (Carey 2000; White et al. 2003).|$|R
50|$|A <b>subaerial</b> <b>eruption</b> is a {{volcanic}} eruption {{that has occurred}} on the land surface, 'under the air'. They generally produce pyroclastic flows, lava fountains, and lava flows, which are commonly classified in different subearial eruption types, including Plinian, Peléan, and Hawaiian eruptions. Subaerial eruptions contrast with subaqueous, submarine and subglacial eruptions which all originate below differing forms of a water surface.|$|E
50|$|Three {{forms of}} glaciovolcanism are known. Subglacial eruptions occur when a volcano erupts under ice. Such {{activity}} can produce landforms such as tuyas and subglacial mounds. Ice-marginal volcanism takes place when material from a <b>subaerial</b> <b>eruption</b> makes lateral contact with ice. Ice-marginal lava flows are {{a product of}} this phenomenon. Supraglacial eruptions deposit ejecta {{onto the surface of}} an ice sheet.|$|E

The coarseness of the lapillites in the upper unit indicates that the volcanic vents from which this material erupted were close to present day outcrops. The character of the individual flow units suggest that the volcanic strata accumulated at a slightly greater rate than basin subsidence.|$|E

30|$|There are <b>subaerial</b> <b>{{eruption}}</b> and subaqueous eruption as {{types of}} volcanic eruption {{according to their}} different geographical environments.

30|$|On {{the other}} side, {{there are two}} genetic types of peperite, intrusive-type peperite and effusive-type peperite.

The effusive-type peperite is formed by magma flowing on the surface of hydrate loose sediments which are commonly from subaqueous or <b>subaerial</b> <b>eruptions,</b> and is generated at the bottom and/or the front of lava flows. When magma enters the environment of wet deposits (usually underwater), the lava flow will mix with the moist, loose deposits to form peperite, where the magma fragments are characterized by various sizes of the interconnected−irregular sheets, lobes and folds, and generally showed plastic features (Skilling et al. 2002).|$|R

50|$|The Reykjanes Volcano {{is a large}} volcano {{covering}} the Reykjanes Peninsula in Iceland, where the Mid-Atlantic Ridge rises above sea level. The volcanic system consists of lava fields, postglacial basaltic crater rows, and small shield volcanoes. The submarine Reykjaneshryggur volcanic system is contiguous and is {{considered part of the}} Reykjanes volcanic system, which is the westernmost of a series of four closely spaced en-echelon fissure systems they extend across the Reykjanes Peninsula. The highest of the system's multiple vents is 230 metres (754 ft). Dredging operations resulted in recovery of basaltic rocks of probable Holocene age. Most of the subaerial part of the system is covered by Holocene-age lava fields.

30|$|The {{reservoir}} {{space of}} volcanic reservoirs {{is composed of}} primary porosity, secondary porosity and fractures. The differences in explosive degree, quenching, vesicles distribution and cementation between subaqueous eruption and <b>subaerial</b> <b>eruption</b> {{will result in the}} differences in primary−secondary porosity and fractures of volcanic reservoirs in different eruption/depositional environment.|$|E
30|$|Due to {{the lack}} of {{effective}} identification marks of a hydrovolcanism, it is generally assumed that subaqueous eruption is similar to <b>subaerial</b> <b>eruption</b> (Head and Wilson 2003), ignoring the impact of water on volcanic reservoir development.

30|$|Furthermore, the {{identification}} marks of eruption products discussed here are mainly {{developed in the}} process of condensed diagenesis of magma and pyroclasts, mainly reflecting depositional environment. Compared with explosive eruptions, the underwater accumulation of <b>subaerial</b> <b>eruption</b> and/or of subaqueous eruption of effusive eruptions are easy to distinguish. For the explosive eruptions such as pyroclastic surge and pyroclastic flow, the combination of transportation−deposition medium, diagenetic features and environment of associated normal sediments is indispensable for distinguishing the underwater accumulation developed in subaerial or subaqueous eruptions.|$|E
40|$|Magmatic {{volatiles}} from subglacial edifices offer useful {{insights into}} palaeo-ice thicknesses and during <b>subaerial</b> <b>eruptions</b> are {{a strong influence}} on eruptive behaviour. However, pre-eruptive volatile concentrations and degassing paths are lacking from subglacially erupted edifices and thus the role of volatiles in determining the explosivity of subglacial eruptions remains unclear. The eruptive mechanisms of subglacial rhyolite are particularly poorly understood as such an eruption has not occurred during recent history and therefore has never been observed. Furthermore, the pre-eruptive volatile content of Icelandic rhyolite is poorly constrained. I have measured the volatile content of melt inclusions and matrix glasses from five subglacial rhyolitic edifices in Iceland, which formed through contrasting eruptive behaviour. I provide the first chamber to surface degassing profiles for subglacial volcanism and used their residual volatile contents to reconstruct quenching pressures and thus palaeo-ice thicknesses. Volatile-based estimates of the palaeo-ice surfaces for Bláhnúkur (1, 000 m a. s. l.), Dalakvísl, (1, 020 m a. s. l.) and Angel Peak (1, 120 m a. s. l.) are broadly consistent with estimates made from the subglacial-subaerial transition of tuyas thought to have formed at a similar time (1, 090 m a. s. l.). Relative differences between samples have been interpreted as showing intrusive formation {{for some of the}} facies at Bláhnúkur, and a syn-eruptive jökulhlaup during the formation of Dalakvísl, thus offering useful insight into edifice construction and the associated hazards. Pre-eruptive volatiles contents reveal that effusive magma had relatively low pre-eruptive H 2 O contents (up to 2. 9 wt. %), slow ascent rates and experienced open-system degassing, whereas explosive magma had up to 4. 8 wt. % H 2 O, fast ascent rates and closed-system degassing. Thus the role of volatiles in subglacial systems seems similar to the role played in <b>subaerial</b> <b>eruptions</b> in terms of influencing eruptive behaviour. Furthermore, measured H 2 O contents are much higher than was expected of Icelandic rhyolite, which is generally considered to be ‘dry’...|$|R
40|$|Eruptions beneath ice {{sheets and}} glaciers can {{generate}} hazardous ash plumes and powerful meltwater floods, {{as demonstrated by}} the recent Icelandic eruptions at Eyjafjallajökull in 2010 and at Grímsvötn in 2011. A key scientific objective for volcanologists is to better understand the factors controlling subglacial eruptions, but the eruptions are mostly hidden beneath ice that is often hundreds of metres thick, thereby preventing direct observation. New approaches are therefore needed to reconstruct the factors driving explosive activity and the response of the overlying ice. The dissolved volatile content, preserved in glassy volcanic rock, offers a useful means of reconstructing palaeo-ice thicknesses. However, for subglacial rhyolite at least, there seems to be little or no correlation between loading pressure and eruptive style. Instead, there is a strong correlation between the pre-eruptive volatile content, degassing path and eruptive behaviour. It seems that the style of many subglacial eruptions is controlled by the same mechanisms as <b>subaerial</b> <b>eruptions,</b> with explosivity strongly influenced by degassing and magmatic fragmentation...|$|R
40|$|From {{the study}} and {{interpretation}} of the volcanic products and structures of Flores Island, we infer that its volcanic history was dominated by two major periods: (1) proto-insular volcanism, which includes all the submarine and emergent activities; and (2) insular volcanism, consisting exclusively of <b>subaerial</b> <b>eruptions.</b> The first period includes two phases: (1) the oldest (2. 2 to 1. 5  Ma) of shallow submarine volcanism; (2) the youngest (1. 0 to 0. 75  Ma) includes emergent volcanism. Throughout the second period, three volcanic stages are recognized: (1) the first one (0. 7 to 0. 5  Ma) includes the most voluminous volcanism, balanced between effusive and explosive events; (2) an intermediate stage (0. 4 to 0. 2  Ma) that involves {{a larger number of}} small-scale feeder centres, with effusive eruptions prevailing; (3) the third stage is the latest volcanic activity of the Island ([approximate]  0. 003  Ma), with strombolian and subsequent phreatic and phreatomagmatic activity centred at four volcanic vents.

Obviously, formation of the quenching texture and its associated structures has strong correlations with water, for example, quenching texture can be caused by phreatomagmatic eruption, either subaqueous eruption or <b>subaerial</b> <b>eruption,</b> in a littoral environment with abundant underground water.

30|$|The {{content of}} vesicles in {{volcanic}} rocks mainly {{depends on the}} viscosity, volatile components, condensation and consolidation environment of magma, water depth and development of “globoid” with inner cavity (Head and Wilson 2003). On the one hand, {{in the process of}} hydrovolcanism, the hot magma is submerged into the quenching media-water, which is beneficial to seal most vesicles into pyroclasts or plastic fragments. On the other hand, the increase of water depth and static pressure will inhibit the exsolution of volatile components in hydrovolcanism and reduce the primary porosity which is obvious in pillow basalt of deep-sea submarine eruption. The hydraulic pressure impedes the escape of volatiles and makes vesicle development of volcanic rocks in a hydrovolcanism less than that in a <b>subaerial</b> <b>eruption,</b> the latter of which, having 25 % vesicle content, is favorable for hydrocarbon accumulation (Run et al. 1996). Thus, the vesicle development depends on consolidation environment and water depth (pressure) in addition to volatile content and magma properties.|$|E
40|$|Despite {{increasing}} {{recognition of}} silicic pumice-bearing deposits {{in the deep}} marine environment, the processes involved in explosive silicic submarine eruptions remain in question. Here we present data on bubble sizes and number densities (number of bubbles per unit of melt matrix) for deep submarine-erupted pumices from three volcanoes (Healy, Raoul SW and Havre) along the Kermadec arc (SW Pacific) to investigate {{the effects of a}} significant (>~ 1 km) overlying water column and the associated increased hydrostatic pressure on magma vesiculation and fragmentation. We compare these textural data with those from chemically similar, subaerially erupted pyroclasts from nearby Raoul volcano as well as submarine-erupted ‘Tangaroan’ fragments derived by non-explosive, buoyant detachment of foaming magma from Macauley volcano, also along the Kermadec arc. Deep submarine-erupted pumices are macroscopically similar (colour, density, texture) to subaerial or shallow submarine-erupted pumices, but show contrasting microscopic bubble textures. Deep submarine-erupted pyroclasts have fewer small (< 10 ?m diameter) bubbles and narrower bubble size distributions (BSDs) when compared to subaerially erupted pyroclasts from Raoul (35 - 55 ?m vs. 20 - 70 ?m range in volume based median bubble size, respectively). Bubble number density (BND) values are consistently lower than subaerial-erupted pyroclasts and do not display the same trends of decreasing BND with increasing vesicularity. We interpret these textural differences to result from deep submarine eruptions entering the water column at higher pressures than <b>subaerial</b> <b>eruptions</b> entering the atmosphere (~ 10 MPa vs. 0. 1 MPa for a vent at 1000 mbsl). The presence of an overlying water column acts to suppress rapid acceleration of magma, as occurs in the upper conduit of <b>subaerial</b> <b>eruptions,</b> therefore suppressing coalescence, permeability development and gas loss, amounting to closed-system degassing conditions. The higher confining pressure environment of deep submarine settings hinders extensive post-fragmentation clast expansion, coalescence of bubbles, and thinning of bubble walls, causing clasts to have similar BND values regardless of their vesicularity. Although deep submarine-erupted pyroclasts are closely similar to their subaerial counterparts on the basis of bulk vesicularities and macroscopic appearance, they differ markedly in their microscopic textures, allowing them to be fingerprinted in modern and ancient pumiceous marine sediments...|$|R
40|$|Bransfield Strait, {{a narrow}} active rift with three {{submarine}} basins, separates the South Shetland Islands from northern Antarctic Peninsula. Volcanism in Bransfield Strait commenced prior to 0. 75 Ma and continues, with recent <b>subaerial</b> <b>eruptions</b> at Deception, Bridgeman and Penguin islands, submarine hydrothermal activity and numerous young basaltic seamounts located along the rift axis. Gravity cores {{were collected from}} five locations within the central Bransfield basin. Diatomaceous mud interbedded with terrigenous detritus and discrete ash layers up to 10 cm thick are the commonest sediment types in all the cores. The major element compositions of glass shards within the ash layers are, apart from the uppermost layer, compositionally similar to pyroclastic units preserved on Deception Island, a young (< 0. 75 Ma) active stratovolcano. The uppermost ash layer cannot be closely matched compositionally to any known source in the Antarctic-Scotia Sea-southem South America region. Its presence indicates that a volcanic centre other than Deception Island contributed ash to the Bransfield basin. Based on the shallow stratigraphical position of the compositionally distinctive ash layer, only a few decimetres beneath the seafloor, its source volcano was probably active in historical times (< few hundred years) ...|$|R
40|$|Lower Miocene basaltic glass spherules from DSDP Site 32 pelagic sediments in {{the eastern}} Pacific are compositionally diverse, and new {{analyses}} and interpretations {{have been added to}} those of earlier workers. The spherules are of titanian ferrobasalt which is compositionally similar to highly evolved abyssal basalts and to some oceanic island eruptives, and they were most likely shaped during intense lava fountaining during a number of separate eruptions. These eruptions tapped distinct but related magma batches in terms, for example, of distinctively high TiO 2 and FeO* contents. Their age overlaps that of some of the eruptions of the Columbia River Plateau Basalts, but they are compositionally distinct from most of the latter basalts. Although about 15 m. y. old, they show little alteration. The low chlorine and sulfur contents compared to those of abyssal ferrobasalts are consistent with degassing prior to quenching during <b>subaerial</b> <b>eruptions,</b> and rule out production of the spherules by submarine fountaining. Lava fountaining alone is insufficient to account for the distance of about 100 km from even the closest possible seamount source. Instead, large phreatomagmatic eruption columns reaching at least 15 km and including lava fountaining immediately after the initial explosion are required. Alternatively, and deemed less likely, is their deposition by turbidites derived from Pioneer Seamount...|$|R
30|$|Previous {{studies showed}} that rock {{constituents}} of the Wucaiwan depression and the Shixi depression in the Junggar Basin were similar but the reservoir quality of these two depressions was obviously different; the average porosity of the former is 8.14 %, while that of the latter is 14.77 %. This difference is mainly derived from their different eruption environments. The volcanic eruption of the Wucaiwan depression belongs to <b>subaerial</b> <b>eruption</b> without water involving, whereas the volcanic eruption of the Shixi depression is a hydrovolcanism (Zou 2013). The volcanic breccia in the Jiyang depression is characterized by dense vesicles with diameter of 0.01  mm, caused by rapid cooling of magma as it interacted with water generating vitreous materials without vesicles aggregating and overflowing. The basalt of Well Bin 674 is formed by magma overflowing into water and quenching with water, accompanied by generating vesicles among breccia and deformational vesicles between breccia (Xie et al. 1998).|$|E
40|$|The dating of {{material}} from deep boreholes drilled in volcanic ocean islands allows constraints {{to be placed}} on their growth and long-term subsidence rates. We dated lavas from a 3 km geothermal borehole at Ascension Island by the laser-heating 40 Ar/ 39 Ar technique. The samples yield ages of up to 3. 4 Ma and volcanic growth rates of ? 0. 4 km/Myr. The transition from submarine to <b>subaerial</b> <b>eruption</b> occurs at ? 710 m below present sea level and 2. 5 Ma. Since 2. 5 Ma, there has been ? 430 – 500 m of subsidence over and above the expected ? 190 – 260 m due to lithospheric cooling. Plausible elastic thicknesses and growth histories would generate a maximum elastic subsidence since 2. 5 Ma of ? 200 m.

30|$|Following a <b>subaerial</b> <b>eruption,</b> primary tephra grains are transported {{through the}} air before falling onto the water surface and {{settling}} through the water column to the sea floor. During the transportation process, grain separation can occur, potentially resulting {{in the formation of}} normal and/or reverse grading structures in marine tephra beds. For example, large pumice grains might remain afloat on the water surface for extended periods, settling later, and thus forming the upper part of a tephra bed. Large pumice grains might also be transported by ocean currents, forming a drift pumice layer distal to the main tephra distribution. Examples of drift pumices occur on marine terrace deposits along the Japan Sea coastline (Toyokura et al. 1991; Shiraishi et al. 1992). Explosive submarine volcanism has produced tephra beds (e.g., Yuasa 1995; Chun et al. 2007; Allen et al. 2010). In addition, some marine tephra beds have been deposited by primary pyroclastic material flowing from onshore volcanoes into nearby oceans (e.g., Allen et al. 2012; Schindlbeck et al. 2013; Kutterolf et al. 2014).|$|E
40|$|Volcanic eruptions are {{important}} events in Earth's cycle of magma generation and crustal construction. Over durations of hours to years, eruptions produce new deposits of lava and/or fragmentary ejecta, transfer heat and magmatic volatiles from Earth's interior to the overlying air or seawater, and significantly modify {{the landscape and}} perturb local ecosystems. Today and through most of geological history, the greatest number and volume of volcanic eruptions on Earth {{have occurred in the}} deep ocean along mid-ocean ridges, near subduction zones, on oceanic plateaus, and on thousands of mid-plate seamounts. However, deep-sea eruptions (> 500 m depth) are much more difficult to detect and observe than <b>subaerial</b> <b>eruptions,</b> so comparatively little is known about them. Great strides have been made in eruption detection, response speed, and observational detail since the first recognition of a deep submarine eruption at a mid-ocean ridge 25 years ago. Studies of ongoing or recent deep submarine eruptions reveal information about their sizes, durations, frequencies, styles, and environmental impacts. Ultimately, magma formation and accumulation in the upper mantle and crust, plus local tectonic stress fields, dictate when, where, and how often submarine eruptions occur, whereas eruption depth, magma composition, conditions of volatile segregation, and tectonic setting determine submarine eruption style...|$|R
40|$|Rhyolitic eruptions beneath Icelandic glaciers can {{be highly}} explosive, as {{demonstrated}} by Quaternary tephra layers dispersed throughout northern Europe. However, {{they can also be}} small and effusive. A subglacial rhyolitic eruption has never been observed, so behavioral controls remain poorly understood and the influence of pre-eruptive volatile contents is unknown. We have therefore used secondary ion mass spectrometry to characterize pre-eruptive volatile contents and degassing paths for five subglacial rhyolitic edifices within the Torfajökull central volcano, formed in contrasting styles of eruption under ice ~ 400 m thick. This includes the products of the largest known eruption of Icelandic subglacial rhyolite of ~ 16 km 3 at ca. 70 ka. We find pre-eruptive water contents in melt inclusions (H 2 OMI) of up to 4. 8 wt%, which indicates that Icelandic rhyolite can be significantly more volatile rich than previously thought. Our results indicate that explosive subglacial rhyolite eruptions correspond with high H 2 OMI, closed-system degassing, and rapid magma ascent, whereas their effusive equivalents have lower H 2 OMI and show open-system degassing and more sluggish ascent rates. Volatile controls on eruption style thus appear similar to those for <b>subaerial</b> <b>eruptions,</b> suggesting that ice plays a subsidiary role in controlling the behavior of subglacial rhyolitic eruptions...|$|R
