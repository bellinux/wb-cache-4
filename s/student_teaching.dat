25|$|In November 1997, King was {{assigned}} to oversee the union's National Organizing Department, a position created especially for him. UAW members approved making the position an elected vice president in June 1998, and King was elected that year. It was the first new vice presidency created in many years. During his four-year tenure in this latter position, King pushed the UAW to organize retail workers at Kmart, casino workers; state, county, and local government employees; and graduate <b>student</b> <b>teaching</b> and research assistants. Yokich defended King's outreach to these nontraditional constituencies of the UAW. King also established six regional organizing centers to help devolve responsibility for organizing closer to the worksite. By November 2000, he had led organizational drives which added about 50,000 new members to the union. By 2001, more than 22,000 state government workers in Michigan belonged to the UAW, as did some 15,000 graduate student workers. More than 20,000 of the 60,000 new members the UAW organized between 2002 and 2006 worked outside the automotive industry. Under his leadership, the UAW organized another 6,000 new members between 2006 and 2009. But his organizing drives also saw some major setbacks, such as when Nissan workers in Tennessee rejected UAW representation 2-to-1 in what {{was seen as a}} major setback for the union in its Southern organizing effort. Another loss came at Freightliner in North Carolina, and a major organizing effort at Mercedes-Benz never resulted in an election. The union did make organizing headway among auto parts suppliers, however.|$|E

2500|$|Truesdale's term {{as chair}} of the NLRB lasted just over two years, and during that time the Board neither {{overturned}} much precedent nor generated new doctrine. However, in late February 200, the Board did decertify the Major League Umpires Association and certified the World Umpires Association as the new union for umpires in Major League Baseball. Truesdale wrote the three-paragraph opinion certifying the new union. The Board also issued two important rulings in October and November 2000. [...] The first, New York University, 332 NLRB 1205 (2000), found that graduate <b>student</b> <b>teaching</b> and research assistants at private colleges and universities were employees as defined by the NLRA. [...] Truesdale convinced Republican Member Peter J. Hurtgen to join himself and Member Wilma B. Liebman in relying on Boston Medical Center, 330 NLRB 152 (1999) (which reversed precedent and found medical interns and residents to be employees) to find the graduate students to be employees. The same day, in NYP Acquisition Corp., 332 NLRB 1041 (2000), Truesdale convinced Member Sarah Fox to join himself and Hurtgen in significantly modifying the Board's successorship rulings. [...] Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation bought the New York Post in 1976. When News Corp. purchased a New York City television station in 1988, federal regulators required Murdoch to sell the Post. The new publisher went bankrupt in 1991, and News Corp. purchase the paper again in 1993. The New York Post subsequently laid off large numbers of union workers. With the NLRB only at three members due to resignations and delayed confirmations, Truesdale and Hurtgen joined to alter the Board's successorship test by concluding that the subsidiary News Corp. used to buy the paper in 1993 was sufficiently different from the 1976 News Corp. subsidiary and with sufficiently different goals that it did not trigger the Board's successorship duty-to-bargain requirements.|$|E
