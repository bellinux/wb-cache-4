40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate Kollidon SR for the development of extended release Albuterol Sulphate matrix tablets in comparison with other polymers as Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose K 15 M, Carbopol 71 G NF, and Eudragit L 100 - 55. The mechanical properties of the tablets were improved as concentration of Kollidon SR or other polymers increased. It was found that Kollidon SR 30 % (w/w) and HPMC 30 % (w/w) tablets have f 2 similarity factor of 83. 5 in their Albuterol Sulphate dissolution profile. The marketed product was found to release 99. 7 % of drug content within 8 h, while Kollidon SR and HPMC tablets with 30 % (w/w) polymer concentration level released 92. 7 % and 92. 9 % respectively of drug content within 8 h. Kollidon SR has a unique character of maintaining tablets geometric shape until the end of dissolution test, this is mainly due to the water insoluble content, polyvinyl acetate, forming 80 % (w/w) of Kollidon SR, while the remaining content 20 % (w/w) is the water <b>soluble,</b> <b>polyvinylpyrrolidone,</b> responsible for pore formation causing a diffusion controlled release. Drug release from all previous formulations is best described to be controlled by more than one kinetic mechanism of release. In conclusion, Kollidon SR and HPMC and Carbopol were found to be potential candidates for the development of extended release of Albuterol Sulphate tablets...|$|E
40|$|It is {{estimated}} that 90 % of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) {{in research and development}} are insoluble or partially soluble in water. Due to poor solubility, these APIs exhibit poor bioavailability in solid dosage forms. To improve the release rates of APIs, we consider free surface electrospinning of microemulsions as a means of producing submicron size domains of API dispersed in an amorphous excipient. Microemulsions containing vitamin E, a poorly <b>soluble</b> API, and <b>Polyvinylpyrrolidone,</b> an excipient, are electrospun to produce a highly porous and high surface area material, which promotes rapid drug release. The electrospun materials were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and high performance liquid chromatography to determine the morphology of the fibers and the bioavailability of the final material. As the fiber diameter of the electrospun material decreases, the dissolution rate of the API increases rapidly. In addition to improving the bioavailability of APIs, this technique may be utilized to streamline the downstream processing of pharmaceuticals, resulting in lower operating cost and improved uniformity over current batch manufacturing techniques...|$|R
40|$|Phenolic {{compounds}} have robust activity against free radicals, {{thus they}} possess {{potential in the}} treatment of various metabolic disorders such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular, osteoporosis and malaria. The application of the compounds, however, has been hindered by their intrinsic physicochemical properties of having poor solubility and stability in the human gastro-intestinal pathway. As a result, phenolic compounds have low oral bioavailability. Addressing the drawbacks such as those exhibited by phenolic compounds usually focuses on the strategy of processing and formulation. The processing can contribute to improvement of the physical properties of the compounds and exploration of alternative administration, while formulation can facilitate the modification of compound interactions with the targeted site of delivery. In this study, particle engineering and formulation were applied to phenolic compound of curcumin for development composite products. Derived compound of cyclodextrins; hydroxypropylated and methylated beta cyclodextrins, and water <b>soluble</b> polymer of <b>polyvinylpyrrolidone</b> (PVP) were used as excipients to investigate synergistic effect of the co-formulations. The method of dense gas anti-solvent technology was used throughout the study, using compressed CO 2 as processing medium. Processing and formulation had succeeded to improve curcumin performance in term of dissolution property as 80 % of curcumin in 200 min and enhancement of aqueous solubility of 190 times could be obtained. Inhalable powders of curcumin composite having enhanced properties on aerodynamic performance with 61 % - compared to 11 % of the unprocessed material - of fine particle fraction (FPF) was produced. In addition, inhalable powder exhibited improved aqueous solubility as high as 70 times. Further, the ARISE processed pulmonary products had enhanced activity towards lung cancer cells. Process scale-up to evaluate feasibility of the dense gas method of the atomized rapid injection solvent extraction (ARISE) system was also conducted both technically and economically. The applicability of the ARISE method to produce micrometric particle of phenolic para-coumaric acid was examined in the lab and pilot-lab scale processing. An evaluation on the economics has confirmed scalability of the ARISE method to process micro- or nanoscale materials at larger scale operation...|$|R
40|$|Neste trabalho foi investigado o mecanismo de fotodegradação de polímeros e também a ação de agentes estabilizantes. Foi investigada a degradação oxidativa de polímeros solúveis em água como poli(vinilpirrolidona), PVP; poli(acrilamida), PAM e poli(etilenoglicol), PEG na presença de peróxido de hidrogênio, reagente de Fenton e sal de ferro. O PVP apresentou a menor fotoestabilidade enquanto a PAM apresentou a maior fotoestabilidade. O sal de ferro não promoveu a degradação. As soluções de PEG foram fotooxidadas com os sistemas UV/H 2 O 2, Fenton e foto-Fenton e as amostras foram analisadas por GPC e HPLC. A análise por GPC das soluções de PEG mostrou que em todas as condições oxidativas usadas, a fotooxidação leva a uma queda acentuada da Mw, caracterizando um mecanismo de quebra de cadeia aleatório. Para os três sistemas usados, a polidispersidade aumenta após a degradação, confirmando o mecanismo de quebra aleatória de cadeia. As medidas de GPC também mostraram que a velocidade de degradação é muito maior com o sistema foto-Fenton (kd = 1, 010 - 4 mol. g- 1. min- 1), seguida pelo sistema UV/H 2 O 2 (kd = 3, 610 - 5 mol. g- 1. min- 1). O uso do reagente de Fenton apresentou a menor velocidade de degradação (kd = 1, 110 - 6 mol. g- 1. min- 1). Os produtos de degradação do PEG, nos três sistemas analisados, foram analisados por HPLC, sendo identificados produtos de menor peso {{molecular}}, entre eles, EG, 2 EG, 3 EG, 4 EG, e os ácidos glicólico e fórmico. O mecanismo envolve um processo consecutivo em que os etilenoglicóis de maior peso molecular dão origem aos de menor peso molecular. Etilenoglicóis de cadeia curta foram usados com sucesso como moléculas modelo para prever o mecanismo de fotodegradação do PEG. Fenóis primários combinados com antioxidantes secundários contendo fósforo são os sistemas estabilizantes mais efetivos, amplamente usados na estabilização do processamento e na aplicação de olefinas a longo prazo. O mecanismo de reação de hidrólise dos antioxidantes fosfito, escolhidos para diferenciar na estrutura química e no conteúdo de fósforo, é investigado através da espectrometria de massas. Substituintes diferentes em torno do átomo de fósforo mostram um efeito significativo na estabilidade dos fosfitos com substituintes fenol, produzindo estruturas hidroliticamente estáveis. The aim of {{this work}} was to investigate polymer photodegradation mechanisms and stabilizing agents. The course of photooxidative degradation of some water <b>soluble</b> polymers (<b>poly(vinylpyrrolidone),</b> PVP; poly(acrylamide), PAM and poly(ethylene glycol), PEG) {{in the presence of}} hydrogen peroxide, Fenton reagent and iron salt has been investigated. PVP showed the lowest photostability while PAM had the greatest photostability. Iron salt was not efficient promoting degradation. PEG has been photooxidized in Fenton, photo-Fenton and UV/H 2 O 2 systems. Samples were analysed using GPC and HPLC. GPC analysis of PEG solutions showed that in all oxidizing conditions used, the photooxidation of PEG aqueous solutions leads to an abrupt decrease of Mw, which means that the degradation of PEG implies a random chain scission mechanism. Polydispersity increases after degradation in all the systems used, confirming a random chain scission mechanism. GPC analysis also showed that the rate of degradation is much higher for the photo-Fenton system (kd = 1, 010 - 4 mol. g- 1. min- 1), followed by UV/H 2 O 2 system (kd = 3, 610 - 5 mol. g- 1. min- 1). Fenton reagent has the lowest degradation rate (kd = 1, 110 - 6 mol. g- 1. min- 1). The degradation products of PEG in all oxidizing systems, were analyzed by HPLC and lower molecular weight products were detected, i. e., EG, 2 EG, 3 EG, 4 EG, glycolic and formic acids. The mechanism involved a consecutive process, were the larger ethyleneglycols gave rise, successively, to smaller ones. This suggested that the mechanism involved successive scissions of the polymer chain. Ethyleneglycols were successfully used as model molecules to predict PEGs photodegradation mechanism. Primary hindered phenols in combination with phosphorous-based secondary antioxidants {{are one of the most}} effective stabilizing systems, widely used in the processing stabilization and long-term application of polyolefins. The hydrolysis reaction mechanism of phosphite antioxidants, chosen to differ in chemical structure and phosphorus content, is investigated by mass spectrometric means. The analytes under investigation are exposed to accelerated humid ageing conditions and their hydrolytic pathway and stability is investigated. Different substituents around the phosphorus atom are shown to have a significant effect on the stability of the phosphites with phenol substituent producing very hydrolytically stable structures...|$|R
