5|$|Cherry Springs State Park and the {{surrounding}} Susquehannock State Forest have recovered from the clearcutting of the lumber era. However, {{the composition of the}} forests has changed, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> now more hardwoods, including sugar maple and black cherry, and fewer eastern white pine and eastern hemlock. The park also has apple trees from the CCC orchard. Over 400species of birds have been found in Pennsylvania, including 186that breed in the state. Birds such as ospreys, hawks, owls, nightjars, and bald eagles have returned to the park and state forest, and saw-whet owls have been studied in the park.|$|E
5|$|The tooth enamel is well {{preserved}} {{over most}} of the tooth. It consists of prisms—bundles of hydroxyapatite crystals—with an average diameter of 3.8m. Most are entirely surrounded by a sheath, but in some the sheath is open. The prisms are slightly curved toward the outer surface of the tooth. Between the prisms, and oriented at an angle of about 45° to them, are crystals of interprismatic material. On average, the prisms are 6.57μm apart, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> about 27,247 per mm2.|$|E
5|$|Among other {{inhabitants}} of London are 10,000 red foxes, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> now 16 foxes for every square mile (2.6 square kilometres) of London. These urban foxes are noticeably bolder than their country cousins, sharing the pavement with pedestrians and raising cubs in people's backyards. Foxes have even sneaked into the Houses of Parliament, where one was found asleep on a filing cabinet. Another {{broke into the}} grounds of Buckingham Palace, reportedly killing some of Queen ElizabethII's prized pink flamingos. Generally, however, foxes and city folk appear to get along. A survey in 2001 by the London-based Mammal Society found that 80 percent of 3,779 respondents who volunteered to keep a diary of garden mammal visits liked having them around. This sample cannot be taken to represent Londoners as a whole.|$|E

5|$|Spawning is {{generally}} driven by environmental {{factors such as}} changes in the water temperature, and their release is triggered by lighting conditions such as sunrise, sunset or the phase of the moon. Many species of Cnidaria may spawn simultaneously in the same location, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> too many ova and sperm for predators to eat more than a tiny percentage— one famous example is the Great Barrier Reef, where at least 110 corals and a few non-cnidarian invertebrates produce enough gametes to turn the water cloudy. These mass spawnings may produce hybrids, some of which can settle and form polyps, {{but it is not}} known how long these can survive. In some species the ova release chemicals that attract sperm of the same species.|$|E

25|$|The undefinability theorem {{shows that}} this {{encoding}} cannot be done for semantic concepts such as truth. It shows that no sufficiently rich interpreted language can represent its own semantics. A corollary is that any metalanguage capable of expressing the semantics of some object language must have expressive power exceeding that of the object language. The metalanguage includes primitive notions, axioms, and rules absent from the object language, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> theorems provable in the metalanguage not provable in the object language.|$|E

The Mayor and Common Council also appoint members of the Planning and Zoning Board, as well as the Board of Health.|$|E
25|$|Conflict often {{develops}} between queens {{and workers}} of haplodiploid species because workers are more {{related to their}} sisters than their brothers or daughters. This results in them trying to push the sex ratio <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> more females produced by the queen than males. At the same time, however, it {{is best for the}} queen to keep a 1:1 ratio of male and female offspring because she is equally related to both. D. media workers and queens have been observed policing worker laid eggs which helps to push the ratio more towards the females. This may help to keep worker-queen conflict from getting worse since workers do not produce many offspring in the nest.|$|E

25|$|The {{station is}} served by lines 4 and 5 of the Oslo Metro. During regular hours, each {{operates}} at a 15-minute headway. Line 5 passes twice through the Ring, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> services every five minutes to the city center and twice every fifteen minutes to the Ring Line. Travel time to Stortinget is nine minutes. Operations are carried out by Sporveien T-banen on contract with Ruter, the public transport authority in Oslo and Akershus. The infrastructure itself is owned by Sporveien, a municipal company. Service is provided using MX3000 three- and six-car trains. The station had an average 2,009 boarding passengers in 2002, ranking ninth among the metro stations that year. It is located in fare zone 1.|$|E
25|$|Band gaps are {{essentially}} leftover ranges of energy {{not covered by}} any band, {{a result of the}} finite widths of the energy bands. The bands have different widths, with the widths depending upon the degree of overlap in the atomic orbitals from which they arise. Two adjacent bands may simply not be wide enough to fully cover the range of energy. For example, the bands associated with core orbitals (such as 1s electrons) are extremely narrow due to the small overlap between adjacent atoms. As a result, there tend to be large band gaps between the core bands. Higher bands involve comparatively larger orbitals with more overlap, becoming progressively wider at higher energies <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> no band gaps at higher energies.|$|E

25|$|One {{reason is}} the {{official}} policy of cadre deployment, whereby persons loyal to the ruling party, the African National Congress, are given jobs in different branches of government. This intransparent process puts party loyalty ahead of competence and demoralises public service employees, according to a 2012 study by the Human Sciences Research Council. Skilled staff are concentrated at the national and provincial levels, {{but there is a}} skills deficit at the municipal level. South Africa does not have a unified civil service, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> no uniform standards for hiring and promotion at the municipal level. According to the study, there is also a high level of turnover of middle and senior managers in the civil service, due to stressful working conditions and opportunities for qualified professionals in the private sector.|$|E
25|$|Methods {{for study}} of non-equilibrium {{processes}} mostly deal with spatially continuous flow systems. In this case, the open connection between system and surroundings is usually taken to fully surround the system, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> no separate connections impermeable to matter but permeable to heat. Except {{for the special}} case mentioned above {{when there is no}} actual transfer of matter, which can be treated as if for a closed system, in strictly defined thermodynamic terms, it follows that transfer of energy as heat is not defined. In this sense, {{there is no such thing}} as 'heat flow' for a continuous-flow open system. Properly, for closed systems, one speaks of transfer of internal energy as heat, but in general, for open systems, one can speak safely only of transfer of internal energy. A factor here is that there are often cross-effects between distinct transfers, for example that transfer of one substance may cause transfer of another even when the latter has zero chemical potential gradient.|$|E
25|$|A paddy {{field is}} a flooded parcel of arable land used for growing semiaquatic rice. Paddy {{cultivation}} {{should not be}} confused with cultivation of deep water rice, which is grown in flooded conditions with water more than 50cm (20in) deep for at least a month. Genetic evidence shows that all forms of paddy rice, both indica and japonica, spring from a domestication of the wild rice Oryza rufipogon that first occurred 8,200–13,500 years ago South of the Yangtze River in present-day China. However, the domesticated indica subspecies currently appears to be a product of the introgression of favorable alleles from japonica at a later date, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> possibly several events of cultivation and domestication. Paddy fields are the typical feature of rice farming in east, south and southeast Asia. Fields can be built into steep hillsides as terraces and adjacent to depressed or steeply sloped features such as rivers or marshes. They can require a great deal of labor and materials to create, and need large quantities of water for irrigation. Oxen and water buffalo, adapted for life in wetlands, are important working animals used extensively in paddy field farming.|$|E
