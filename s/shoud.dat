In this work we increase systematically {{the slope of the}} repulsive <b>shouder</b> to study the effect on the anomalies.

Reverend Francis Wise put forward a theory, based on local tradition, that the horse had been scoured annually on Palm Sunday to commemorate Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick's participation in the Battle of Towton, while a Reverend William Asplin ridiculed Wise for his theories on this (and other) hill-figures. This incarnation of the horse was both confirmed on contemporary maps and in 1772 measured fairly exactly by Richard Gough, who described it (in an 1806 reference) as [...] "croup to chest, 34 feet; shoulder to ears, under jaw to bottom of chest, 10 feet; <b>shouder</b> to ground, 16 feet or 57 hands; length of off foreleg, 12 feet; length of near foreleg, 9 feet; hindlegs, 10 feet; belly, 19.5 feet; sheath, 8 feet; tail (more like a lion's), 18 feet; width of each leg 1 foot; diameter of the eye, 1 foot 2 inches long".

40|$|<b>Shouder</b> {{replacement}} {{surgery is}} difficult surgery, {{with a relatively}} large risk on limited post-operative range of motion for patients. Adaptations to the anatomy of joints by placing a prosthesis affects the articulation of the joint. In this thesis we present a software system that simulates and visualises these effects. By loading a CT-scan of the shoulder of a patient we can simulate the range of motion of the joint and visualize limitations {{as a result of}} rigid structures of the joint. Surgeons may set up an operation plan and see what the consequences of the operation will be for the range of motion of the patient. The thesis investigates aspects that are relevant for the system. We describe an algorithm to convert the scan data to bone models. In addition, a validation experiment is presented. A method for motion registration and visualisation of recorded kinematic data is presented. Finally, this thesis concerns the application of the system to different surgical problems, such as hip arthroplasty and shoulder fractures. Promotor: R. G. H. H. Nelissen, Co-promotores: C. P.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of two works: a fictionalized biography and an exegesis. The creative work, minya wunyi gu wonga, {{is set in the}} 1940 s and early 1950 s and is based on the early years of my mother, Mercy Coleman, who grew up on Koonibba Aboriginal Lutheran Mission on the far west coast of South Australia. The narrative is told in Aboriginal English {{from the point of view}} of young Grace. Its central themes are identity and survival. Grace is born to a Kokatha Aboriginal woman, Ada, and an already married Anglo-Celtic father, Old Rod. Old Rod‘s relationship to Grace and her sisters is <b>shouded</b> in secrecy due to the shame of their illegitimacy. The era in which Grace grows up is one of strict government policies regulating the lives of Aboriginal people: the Aboriginies Protection Act and, later, the Assimilation Policy. The lives of Grace, her siblings and her mother are also constrained by the mainstream conservative social mores of a remote rural community in the mid-twentieth century. The narrative moves through a maze of questions, discoveries and betrayals that fuel self-loathing and shame. Grace eventually unravels the truth about Old Rod and discovers the complexity of her identity. The theme of survival is a strong and consistent thread throughout the narrative. The exegesis documents and explores the development of minya wunyi gu wonga from the perspective of an Aboriginal daughter working with her Aboriginal mother to tell the mother‘s story. In keeping with Aboriginal traditions, the exegesis incorporates a running dialogue between daughter and mother, with reflective sequences that explore Indigenous/Black and other related texts. It also explores critical theory and its implications for their lives and the text being created. Several connected questions are addressed in the exegesis. Can we as Aboriginal people heal from trans-generational trauma by participating in the process of creating a literary narrative? What approaches/strategies/frameworks can be applied to research to best reach this outcome? To what extent is 're-authoring‘ or ‘re-visioning‘ our stories liberating and what are the implications for this process for the broader community?Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to obtain values on the {{accuracy}} of the position sense of the upper extremities in non-disabled adults, both conditions under normal and under vibratory and anesthetic disturbance. The subject was blindfolded and seated. One of the subject's arms was positioned at the horizontal reference line by the tester and the subject raised the other arm to what he/she perceived as the horizontal. The arms were prevented from touching each other by a transparent barrier with a protractor printed on it. 1) The subject placed one hand at the perceived horizontal, then raised the other to match the position. This was repeated 30 times, then re-performed moving the arms in the opposite order. 2) The subject placed both hands at the perceived horizontal simultaneously. 3) Task 1) was repeated at two speeds; the subjects were given 1 second and 2 seconds to point. 4) Task 1) was repeated with reference lines 30 degrees above and below the horizontal. 5) The subjects raised one arm to the horizontal reference line. 6) Task 1) was repeated while the tester applied a vibrator at 100 Hz to the deltoid musle and at 30, 60 and 100 Hz to the most sensitive portion of the lateral to the scapular spine (determined in a pilot study) on the pointing side. 7) Task 1) was repeated after the tester anesthetized the <b>shouder</b> the subject was using. The subjects were given about 2 seconds to perform the tasks besides task 3). The error magnitudes were assessed in terms of angular displacements from the reference line in task 1) and between finger tips in task 2). The error direction was expressed depending on the directions of indicated finger points above (plus) or below (minus) the reference line, or the direction of points from the reference of nondominant hand. The error magnitudes in the pointing tasks in healthy adults and the factors influencing them are summarized as follows. 1. The dominant hand pointed significantly below the horizontal in the task with either hand: - 0. 7 °± 1. 3 ° (M±SE) in male and - 1. 5 °± 1. 8 ° in female subjects, while the nondominant hand pointed close to the horizontal: - 0. 1 °± 2. 1 ° in male and - 0. 1 °± 1. 6 ° in female subjects. The distribution of most of the errors were very close to zero in tasks 2), - 0. 05 °± 1. 6 ° in male and - 0. 1 °± 1. 8 ° in female subjects. 2. The dominant hand showed no significant difference in the pointing errors with speed in all 10 subjects, while 9 of the 10 showed significant difference in the nondominant hand. 3. The dominant and nondominant hands in all 10 subjects showed no significant difference in errors when the reference line was at 30 degrees. 4. Errors in tasks 5) showed significant difference in comparison with errors in task 1) in the dominant hand of 8 among 10 subjects and in the nondominant hand of 4 among 10 subjects. 5. Vibratory stimuli caused the pointing errors to significantly move upward or downward in either hand, as compared with the pointing without vibration. 6. The pointing errors moved significantly downward immediately after local anesthesia on the skin over the deltoid muscle of the pointing side in all 5 subjects. In summary, these findings suggest that sensory information from the muscle, joint and skin receptors play important roles in the accuracy of the position sense of the upper extremities...|$|R
