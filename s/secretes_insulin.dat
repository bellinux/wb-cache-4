50|$|The {{pancreas}} {{is a major}} organ {{functioning as}} an accessory digestive gland in the digestive system. It is both an endocrine gland and an exocrine gland. The endocrine part <b>secretes</b> <b>insulin</b> when the blood sugar becomes high; insulin moves glucose from the blood into the muscles and other tissues for use as energy. The endocrine part releases glucagon when the blood sugar is low; glucagon allows stored sugar to {{be broken down into}} glucose by the liver in order to re-balance the sugar levels. The pancreas produces and releases important digestive enzymes in the pancreatic juice that it delivers to the duodenum. The pancreas lies below and {{at the back of the}} stomach. It connects to the duodenum via the pancreatic duct which it joins near to the bile duct's connection where both the bile and pancreatic juice can act on the chyme that is released from the stomach into the duodenum. Aqueous pancreatic secretions from pancreatic duct cells contain bicarbonate ions which are alkaline and help with the bile to neutralise the acidic chyme that is churned out by the stomach.|$|E

40|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} {{is due to}} defective secretion and / {{or function}} of insulin. It is a common chronic disease affecting up to 6 % of the world population. This prevalence increases to about 24 % in the island of Nauru and some Middle Eastern countries. Diabetes mellitus is associated with profound changes in the endocrine pancreas. These changes include {{a significant decrease in}} the number of beta cells, the cell type that produces and <b>secretes</b> <b>insulin.</b> A {{decrease in the number of}} insulin producing cells is more evident in type I diabetes. The decrease in the number of insulin-secreting cells is associated with a concomitant increase in the number of glucagon, somatostatin and pancreatic-polypeptide producing cells. The increase in glucagon producing cells results in hyperglucagonaemia, which further exacerbates the hyperglycaemia induced by lack of insulin. In addition to the changes in the number and plasma levels of pancreatic hormones, the number of calcitonin-gene-related peptide- and galanin-positive cells in the islet of Langerhans decreases after the onset of diabetes. Pancreatic amino butyric acid is also decreased in diabetes.

The expression of the adipocyte-specific flotillin gene, the presence of peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor � and Glut 4, and the colocalization of insulin and leptin confirmed the identity of these cells as adipocytes.

40|$|BACKGROUND New {{sources of}} insulin-secreting cells are {{strongly}} {{required for the}} cure of diabetes. Recent successes in differentiating embryonic stem cells, {{in combination with the}} discovery {{that it is possible to}} derive human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) from somatic cells, have raised the possibility that patient-specific β cells might be derived from patients through cell reprogramming and differentiation. AIMS In this study, we aimed to obtain insulin-producing cells from human iPSC and test their ability to <b>secrete</b> <b>insulin</b> in vivo. METHODS: Human iPSC, derived from both fetal and adult fibroblasts, were differentiated in vitro into pancreas-committed cells and their ability to <b>secrete</b> <b>insulin</b> was measured. iPSCderived cells at two different stages of differentiation (posterior foregut and endocrine cells) were transplanted into immunodeficient mice to test their ability to engraft, differentiate and <b>secrete</b> <b>insulin.</b> RESULTS: IPSC were shown to differentiate into insulin-producing cells in vitro, following the stages of pancreatic organogenesis. At the end of the differentiation, the production of INSULIN mRNA was highly increased and up to 14 % of the cell population became insulin-positive. Terminally differentiated cells also produced C-peptide in vitro in both basal and stimulated conditions. In vivo, mice transplanted with pancreatic cells secreted human C-peptide in response to glucose stimulus, but transplanted cells were observed to lose insulin secretion capacity during the time. At histological evaluation, the grafts were composed of a mixed population of cells containing mature pancreatic cells, but also pluripotent cells and rare neuronal cells. CONCLUSION: These data overall suggest that human iPSC have the potential to generate insulinproducing cells and that these differentiated cells can engraft and <b>secrete</b> <b>insulin</b> in vivo...|$|R

40|$|Gli-similar 3 (Glis 3) is a Krüppel-like {{zinc finger}} protein that plays {{critical}} roles in development {{and in the}} maintenance of normal physiological functions {{in a variety of}} tissues. In humans, GLIS 3 deficiency has been linked to a rare syndrome characterized by neonatal diabetes, hypothyroidism, and polycystic kidney disease. In addition, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have implicated Glis 3 as a risk locus for the development of diabetes. While Glis 3 is known to play important roles in the specification of endocrine cell fates during pancreatic development, its role in the mature beta cell and the mechanism by which Glis 3 dysfunction results in type 2 diabetes remains unclear. We have characterized a rat pancreatic hybridoma cell line (BRIN BD 11) that <b>secretes</b> <b>insulin</b> in response to physiologically normal glucose levels but has greatly diminished expression of Glis 3. The cell line exhibited significantly decreased levels of known Glis 3 target genes, Ins 2 and Ccnd 2 in addition to the insulin activator, MafA. We investigated the effects of stable Glis 3 overexpression on BRIN-BD 11 cells and found that Ins 2 and Ccnd 2 levels were increased in the presence of exogenous Glis 3. Interestingly, while chronic exposure of beta cells to high levels of glucose results reduced expression of Ins 1 / 2 and MafA, we found that BRIN BD 11 cells were relatively protected from the effects of glucotoxicity and exogenous Glis 3 expression partially rescued the phenotype. Collectively, these data suggest that BRIN BD 11 cells may be a useful model for the study of beta cell dysfunction preceding the onset of type 2 diabetes...|$|E

The aim {{of this study was to}} det. the antihyperglycemic activity of synthetic Secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) in streptozotocin (STZ) -induced diabetic rats. The synthetic SDG in a single-dose (20 mg/kg b. w.) two-day study showed dose-dependent redn. in glucose levels with max. effect of 64. 62 % at 48 h post drug treatment (p < 0. 05), which is comparable to that of the std. drug tolbutamide (20 mg/kg b. w.). In a multi-dose fourteen-day study, lower doses of SDG (5 and 10 mg/kg b. w.) exhibited moderate redn. in glucose levels, lipid profile, restoration of antioxidant enzymes and improvement of the insulin and c-peptide levels which shows the regeneration of Î²-cell which <b>secretes</b> <b>insulin.</b> Altered levels of lipids and enzymic antioxidants were also restored by the SDG to the considerable levels in diabetic rats. Results of the present investigation suggest that diabetes is assocd. with an increase in oxidative stress as shown by increase in serum malondialdehyde (MDA), decreased levels of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione (GSH). Also, diabetes is assocd. with an increase in serum total cholesterol as well as triglycerides levels and decrease in insulin and c-peptide levels. SDG is effective in retarding the development of diabetic complications. We propose that synthetic SDG exerts anti hyperglycemic effect by preventing the liver from peroxidn. damage through inhibition of ROS level mediated increased level of enzymic and non-enzymic antioxidants. And, also maintaining tissue function which results in improving the sensitivity and response of target cells in STZ-induced diabetic rats to insulin. [on SciFinder(R) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{pancreatic}} β-cell <b>secretes</b> <b>insulin</b> {{in response}} to a raised blood glucose level. Deficiencies in this control system {{are an important part of}} the etiology of diabetes. The biochemical basis of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion is incompletely understood, and a more complete understanding is an important component in the quest for better therapies against diabetes. In this thesis, mathematical modeling has been employed in order to increase our understanding of the biochemical principles that underlie glucosestimulated insulin secretion of the pancreatic β-cell. The modeling efforts include the glycolysis in theβ-cell with particular emphasis on glycolytic oscillations. The latter have earlier been hypothesized to be the cause of normal pulsatile insulin secretion. This model puts this hypothesis into quantitative form and predicts that the enzymes glucokinase and aldolase play important roles in setting the glucose concentration threshold governing oscillations. Also presented is a model of the mitochondrial metabolism in the β-cell, and of the mitochondrial shuttles that connect the mitochondrial metabolism to the glycolysis. This model gives sound explanations to what was earlier thought to be paradoxical behavior of the mitochondrial shuttles during certain conditions. Moreover, it predicts a strong signal from glucose towards cytosolic NADPH formation, a putative stimulant of insulin secretion. The model also identifies problems with earlier interpretations of experimental results regarding the β- cell mitochondrial metabolism. As an aside, an earlier proposed conceptual model of the generation of oscillations in the TCA cycle is critically analyzed. Further, metabolic control analysis has been employed in order to obtain mathematical expressions that describe the control by pyruvate dehydrogenase and fatty acid oxidation over different aspects of the mitochondrial metabolism and the mitochondrial shuttles. The theories developed explain recently observed behavior of these systems and provide readily testable predictions. The methodological aspects of the work presented in the thesis include the development of a new generic enzyme rate equation, the generalized reversible Hill equation, as well as a reversible version of the classical general modifier mechanism of enzyme action...|$|E

40|$|Fundamental to life is {{the ability}} to acquire and {{assimilate}} nutrients. Individual cell types exhibit preferences for different nutrients, but only certain cells utilize nutrients as signaling molecules. The most intensely studied nutrient signaling system is the pancreatic beta cell, which <b>secretes</b> <b>insulin</b> in response to changes in blood glucose. Another glucose sensing system is found in the neurons within the hypothalamus of the brain. To study how single cells sense changes in glucose, a sensitive marker for secretion is required. To this end the human Growth Hormone (hGH) gene was fused to the 5 ' end of the enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) gene and expressed in the RIN- 1038 beta (β) -cell line. The hGH-GFP fusion protein was targeted to secretory granules and its secretion into culture media was detected from cell populations. At stimulatory levels of glucose (5 mM), hGH-EGFP secretion doubled, and potentiators of insulin secretion enhanced glucose-induced hGH-EGFP release. However, at the single cell level, hGH-EGFP fluorescence acted as a sensor for changes in secretory granule pH. Glucose induced granule acidification by increasing activity of the V-type proton ATPase resident in the vesicular membrane. Moreover, potentiators of secretion elicited alkalinization of the vesicle lumen suggesting a mechanism by which they enhance release. To compare components of the glucose-sensing mechanism of hypothalamic neurons to those described for the beta cell, RT-PCR analysis was performed on RNA samples taken from the Arcuate nucleus (ARC), Lateral Hypothalamus (LH), Paraventricular Hypothalamus (PVH) and Ventromedial Hypothalamus (VMH). Tissue-specific expression of Glucokinase (GK), Glucokinase Regulatory Protein (GKRP), Glucose transporter isoforms (GLUT) 1, 2, 3 and X 1 genes were determined. GK gene expression was found in all hypothalamic regions, with highest levels in the ARC. Enzymatic activity assays show that GK activity accounts for approximately 20 % of the total soluble hexokinase activity in pooled samples of ARC and VMH. All regions also express GLUT 1, 3 and X 1. However, no GLUT- 2 or GKRP mRNA was detected in any sample. Because the expression of the low K(m) GLUTS predominates and GKRP expression is absent, the hypothalamic glucose-sensing mechanism is adapted to the lower levels of glucose present in the cerebrospinal fluid compared to blood levels...|$|E

40|$|Background: Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus {{results from}} an {{autoimmune}} {{destruction of the}} pancreatic beta cells, which produce insulin. The lack of insulin leads to chronic hyperglycemia and secondary complications, such as cardiovascular disease.

Normally, pancreatic beta cells produce and <b>secrete</b> <b>insulin</b> only in response to increased blood glucose levels.
