50|$|The {{pattern is}} placed on the plywood so that the wood grain runs across from the tip of one end of the boomerang to the tip of the other end. Try to get the grain of the outer ply running at 45 degrees to the length of the arms. If there is any warp in the wood, make sure that this {{produces}} dihedral on the upper side of the boomerang, i.e., if the airfoil is uppermost and the boomerang is on a flat surface, then the wingtips are raised slightly above the surface. (Any anhedral and the boomerang won't fly.) The pattern is traced on to the boomerang with a pencil. The boomerang shape is cut out of the plywood. This basic cut out is called the blank. An outline is drawn {{on the top of the}} blank to show the areas to be shaped for the leading and trailing edges of the wings. The profiles of the wings are shaped. The top of the leading edge of each wing is decreased at a 45° angle, while the rear of the wing is angled down to leave 1-2 mm thick trailing edge. The bottom face of the leading edge is trimmed back slightly. The tips of the wings are shaped down to the same thickness as the trailing edge. The various layers of the plywood serve as an outline that helps the worker achieve equal slopes. A shallow section may also be cut out from the bottom surface of each wing. For example, this might consist of a 5-cm long strip near the wing tip and behind the leading edge. Using progressively finer sandpaper, the surface of the boomerang is smoothed carefully. Check the boomerang for a slight amount of dihedral (2-3 mm) on both wings at this point. If there isn't any, introduce some by heating the boomerang either over a heat source or a brief spell in the microwave oven (about 30 seconds on high) - if the boomerang is just about uncomfortably hot to handle, you've got it just about right. Bend up the tips of the wings and place the boomerang on a flat surface with a coin under each tip and a weight (bag of sugar?) on the elbow of the boomerang. Allow it to cool for twenty minutes or more. After spraying the surface with <b>sanding</b> <b>sealer,</b> the surface is smoothed with fine steel wool. The boomerang is then painted again.|$|E
40|$|Using <b>sanding</b> <b>sealer</b> for {{woodworking}} {{is a great}} way to seal the surface and allow your final topcoats to lay on the wood much smoother and with finer luster. This study reports on the experimental formulation of <b>sanding</b> <b>sealer</b> using locally sourced materials. The study addresses the problem of high drying time and stickiness of locally produced <b>sanding</b> <b>sealer</b> in Nigeria. This study seeks to obtain a lower drying time than the already existing local ones. The results point out that kerosene appears to outperform thinner in terms of dissolvability and capability to reduce drying time. Also, mixed dryer appears to be more effective in reducing drying time compared to other types of dryers. The optimum drying time obtained for the produced <b>sanding</b> <b>sealer</b> (OVIS) is seven minutes...|$|E
40|$|We {{recently}} {{reported on a}} case of Intoxilyzer Model 5000 interference by solvents in a man chronically exposed to lacquer and paint thinner fumes (1). The present case is similar but involves the Intoxilyzer Model 4011 AS. The subject, a 35 -year-old male weighing 195 lb, has been employed for the past 17 years as a professional painter and in this capacity regularly encounters various commercial products. Although he reported no medical problems, both e subject and his wife indicated {{that he has been}} adversely affected on days when he sprayed with volatile oil-base compounds. He stated that even though he regularly wears a mask when he paints, it does not fully prevent exposure to the compounds. On the day of the study, the subject, using a spray mask, sprayed with Kelly-Moore Lacquer <b>Sanding</b> <b>Sealer</b> thinned with Tru-Test Lacquer Thinner in an 8 x 10 x 12 ft room beginning at 1 : 30 p. m. and ending at 1 : 50 p. m. Breath was analyzed on the Intoxilyzer at 2 : 33 p. m. and blood was collected immediately thereafter. The spraying exposure was repeated from 2 : 45 to 2 : 50 p. m. without a spray mask; testing was performed on the Intoxilyzer at 2 : 57 p. m. and blood was collected soon thereafter. Testing on the Intoxilyzer was repeated at 3 : 15 p. m. At 3 : 20 p. m., the subject consumed one 16 -ounce Budweiser beer; he was then asked to brush his teeth and gargle with water. Breath was again tested at 3 : 40 p. m. and 3 : 43 p. m. and blood collected at approximately the same time. The subject did not manifest any obvious igns of impairment during the study...|$|E
50|$|This species nests in colonies on Subantarctic islands. It breeds on South Georgia in {{the south}} Atlantic and on the Prince Edward Islands, Crozet Islands, Kerguelen Islands and Heard Island and McDonald Islands in the {{southern}} Indian Ocean. In New Zealand, it breeds on Codfish Island, and formerly bred on the Auckland Islands and Stewart Island. It disperses to surrounding seas and vagrants have been recorded in the Falkland Islands and Australia. While 1.5 m nesting burrows are usually built on scree slopes above the vegetation line, they are occasionally built on flat land. On Codfish Island in New Zealand, the population burrows into <b>sand</b> dunes at <b>Sealers</b> Bay.|$|R
50|$|The home {{incorporated}} Wright’s iconic {{precast concrete}} blocks. These were made using metal molds into which concrete was poured and then set. The Tonkens house is built using eleven block variations, which allowed for infinite {{modifications to the}} design. Masonry subcontractors were used to lay the foundation, while carpentry subcontractors were used to lay the blocks. Blocks were two feet wide by one foot high for walls, and two feet high by two feet wide for ceilings. Blocks were adhered to a reinforced concrete slab, unlike Wright’s Californian homes, in which ceiling blocks were adhered to wooden slabs. Concrete blocks for the Tonkens House were made as a lightweight cinder block. Because cinder blocks are porous, a <b>sand</b> based <b>sealer</b> {{was applied to the}} exterior of the building to waterproof the house.By mid-1955 the total cost of construction, including Wright’s 10 percent fee and additional costs for interior furnishings, was up to $59,000. The increase was due in part to rising values of materials such as steel, concrete and wood. Complications associated with casting concrete blocks also raised construction costs. Expenditure continued to increase throughout the duration of the construction and Cindy Damschroder estimates that the final cost of construction was likely to have been around $118,000.|$|R
