25|$|The {{fate of the}} {{immediate}} environment of the church has been a subject of dispute between city planners since 1813. Scotsman William Hastie proposed clearing the space around {{all sides of the}} church and {{all the way down to}} the Moskva River: the official commission led by Fyodor Rostopchin and Mikhail Tsitsianov agreed to clear only the space between the church and Lobnoye Mesto. Hastie's plan could have radically transformed the city, but he lost to the opposition, whose plans were finally endorsed by Alexander I in December 1817 (<b>specific</b> <b>decision</b> on clearing the rubble around the church was issued in 1816).|$|E
25|$|Large {{and swift}} mammals are stalked and shot with bow and arrow. Smaller and {{burrowing}} mammals are usually captured by hand. Because Aché hunting {{has been extensively}} studied using focal follow and other systematic methods, the encounter rates with prey, the time required for a successful pursuit, and the expected energy gains from prey types, are all well known. This has allowed for numerous tests of <b>specific</b> <b>decision</b> models from Optimal Foraging Theory to be tested using Aché data. Results generally {{support the notion that}} Aché hunters pursue only those prey types that would increase their energy return rates, and pass by some species (many small birds, rodents, reptiles, etc.) that would probably lower overall foraging returns if pursued.|$|E

40|$|Background Involvement of {{patients}} in decision-making about medication is currently being advocated. This study examined (the concordance between) inflammatory arthritis patients’ preferred and perceived involvement in decision-making in general, and in four <b>specific</b> <b>decisions</b> about Disease-Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (DMARDs). Furthermore, this study examined how patients’ involvement is related to satisfaction about decision-making and which factors are related to preferred roles, perceived roles and concordance. Methods Using a cross-sectional survey, 894 patients diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis, Psoriatic Arthritis or Ankylosing Spondylitis were sent a questionnaire which focused on medical decisions in general and on four specific decisions: (a) starting with a traditional DMARD; (b) starting to inject methotrexate; (c) starting a biological DMARD; and (d) decreasing or stopping a DMARD. For each decision preferred and perceived involvement in decision-making was assessed using the Control Preference Scale. Concordance was calculated by subtracting the scores for perceived role from scores for the preferred role. Furthermore, satisfaction with the decision process and socio-demographic, health-related, patient-related and physician-related variables were assessed. Results The response rate was 58 %. For all decisions, most patients (59 %- 63 %) preferred Shared Decision-Making (SDM). SDM was perceived frequently (26 %- 55 %) and patients’ preferences were met in 54 % of the respondents. Yet, in some <b>specific</b> <b>decisions,</b> 26 % to 54 % {{of patients}} would have liked more participation. Perceiving less participation then preferred was associated with less satisfaction with the decision-process, but perceiving more participation than preferred was not. Our results did not reveal any meaningful models to predict preferred or perceived participation in decision-making in general or with reference to <b>specific</b> <b>decisions</b> about DMARDs. Conclusions Most arthritis patients prefer {{to be involved in}} decisions about their medication and SDM is perceived frequently. Yet, in some <b>specific</b> <b>decisions</b> patient participation can be further improved. Patients especially prefer more participation in decision-making regarding starting a first traditional DMARD, which occurs most commonly in newly diagnosed patients. Whereas perceiving too little participation was associated with decreased satisfaction, perceiving too much participation was not. Therefore, rheumatologists should urge patients to participate in every medical decisio...|$|R
