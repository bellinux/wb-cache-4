50|$|For legacy reasons {{associated}} with the previous RNP concept, PBN is currently limited to operations with linear lateral performance requirements and time constraints. For this reason, operations with angular lateral performance requirements (i.e. approach and landing operations with GNSS vertical guidance—approach procedure with vertical guidance APV-I and APV-II), as well as instrument landing system (ILS) and microwave landing system (MLS) are not considered. Unlike the lateral monitoring and obstacle clearance, for barometric VNAV systems there is neither alerting on vertical error nor is there a two-times relationship between a 95% required total <b>system</b> <b>accuracy</b> and the performance limit.

5|$|One {{particular}} set of observations is related to eminently useful practical applications, namely to satellite navigation systems such as the Global Positioning System that are used both for precise positioning and timekeeping. Such systems rely on two sets of atomic clocks: clocks aboard satellites orbiting the Earth, and reference clocks stationed on the Earth's surface. General relativity predicts that these two sets of clocks should tick at slightly different rates, due to their different motions (an effect already predicted by special relativity) and their different positions within the Earth's gravitational field. In order to ensure the <b>system's</b> <b>accuracy,</b> the satellite clocks are either slowed down by a relativistic factor, or that same factor is made part of the evaluation algorithm. In turn, tests of the <b>system's</b> <b>accuracy</b> (especially the very thorough measurements {{that are part of}} the definition of universal coordinated time) are testament to the validity of the relativistic predictions.|$|R

5000|$|Accuracy is crucial, because {{doubling}} the accuracy decreases the needed warhead energy {{by a factor}} of four for radiation damage and {{by a factor of}} eight for blast damage. Navigation <b>system</b> <b>accuracy</b> and the available geophysical information limits the warhead target accuracy. Some writers believe [...] that government-supported geophysical mapping initiatives and ocean satellite altitude systems such as Seasat may have a covert purpose to map mass concentrations and determine local gravity anomalies, in order to improve accuracies of ballistic missiles. Accuracy is expressed as circular error probable (CEP). This is simply the radius of the circle that the warhead has a 50 percent chance of falling into when aimed at the center. CEP is about 90-100 m for the Trident II and Peacekeeper missiles.|$|E

Contrarily, photographers wishing to decrease depth of field to create certain effects, such as isolating subjects from their background, need to increase the aperture diameter, which is easier with a larger format where the resulting f-number will be higher.|$|E
