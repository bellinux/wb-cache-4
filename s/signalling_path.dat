40|$|Abstract — Spectrum {{sharing in}} open {{spectrum}} systems is a challenging problem, particularly since users experience dynamic spectrum availabilities that vary {{over time and}} location. In {{the absence of any}} centralize infrastructure, users coordinate their spectrum usage to support fair access of spectrum and avoid interference. One critical challenge is to construct an efficient <b>signalling</b> <b>path</b> in the presence of spectrum dynamics, where users exchange control and negotiation information reliably. In this paper we propose a distributed coordination protocol (HD-MAC) to construct an in-band control path without relying on the existence of a pre-assigned out-of-band control channel. In particular, we propose a distributed group formation to construct coordination path using local common channels, and a heterogeneity-aware ranking scheme to select channels for data transmissions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and reliability of the proposed approach. I...|$|E

40|$|Many {{endogenous}} {{and environmental}} signals control seedling growth, including several phototransduction pathways. We {{demonstrate that the}} circadian clock controls the elongation of the Arabidopsis hypocotyl immediately upon germination. The pattern of hypocotyl elongation in constant light includes a daily growth arrest spanning subjective dawn and an interval of rapid growth at subjective dusk. Maximal hypocotyl growth coincides with the phase during which the cotyledons are raised, in the previously described rhythm of cotyledon movement. The rhythm of hypocotyl elongation was entrained by light-dark cycles applied to the imbibed seed and its period was shortened in the toc 1 - 1 mutant, indicating that it is controlled by a similar circadian system to other rhythmic markers. The daily growth arrest is abolished by the early flowering 3 (elf 3) mutation, suggesting that this defect may cause its long-hypocotyl phenotype. Mutations that affect the circadian system can therefore cause gross morphological phenotypes, not because the wild type gene functions pleiotropically in several <b>signalling</b> <b>path</b> ways, but rather because the circadian clock exerts widespread control over plant physiology...|$|E

Typical presentations with hypercalcemia or eosinophilia have been reported. Radiographic evaluation with combined positron emission tomography/computed tomography may {{assist in the}} diagnosis and surveillance of women with uterine LMS. A recently developed risk-assessment index is highly predictive of disease-specifi c survival. Ovarian preservation {{does not appear to}} negatively impact outcome, and the addition of adjuvant therapy after surgical treatment does not seem to improve survival. It is noteworthy that LMP 2 -defi cient mice exhibit spontaneous development of uterine LMS with a disease prevalence of ∼ 37 % by 12 months of age. The LMP 2 gene is transcribed from a promoter containing an interferon (IFN) -γ-response factor element; thus, the IFN-γ-signal strongly induces LMP 2 expression. Furthermore, a recent report demonstrated the loss of ability to induce LMP 2 expression, which is an interferon (IFN) -γ-inducible factor, in human uterine LMS tissues and cell lines.

40|$|International audienceThe {{water uptake}} {{capacity}} of plants roots (i. e. their hydraulic conductivity, Lp(r)) is determined {{in large part}} by aquaporins of the Plasma membrane Intrinsic Protein (PIP) sub-family. In the present work, we investigated two stimuli, salicylic acid (SA) and salt, because of their ability to induce in Arabidopsis roots a concomitant accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inhibition of Lp(r). Inhibition of Lp(r) by SA was partially counteracted by preventing the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H(2) O(2)) with exogenous catalase. In addition, exogenous H(2) O(2) was able to reduce Lp(r) by up to 90 % in < 15 min. Based on the lack of effects of H(2) O(2) on the activity of individual aquaporins in Xenopus oocytes and on a pharmacological dissection of H(2) O(2) action on Lp(r), we propose that ROS do not gate Arabidopsis root aquaporins through a direct oxidative mechanism but act through cell signalling mechanisms. Expression in transgenic roots of PIP-GFP fusions and immunogold labelling indicated that external H(2) O(2) enhanced in < 15 min the accumulation of PIPs in intracellular structures tentatively identified as vesicles and small vacuoles. Exposure of roots to SA or salt also induced an intracellular accumulation of the PIP-GFP fusion proteins and these effects were fully counteracted by co-treatment with exogenous catalase. In conclusion, the present work identifies SA as a novel regulator of aquaporins and delineates in the Arabidopsis root a ROS-dependent <b>signalling</b> <b>path.</b> Several abiotic and biotic stress-related stimuli potentially share this path, which involves a H(2) O(2) -induced internalization of PIPs, to down-regulate root water transport...|$|E

40|$|Activation of phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) and {{activation}} of the 70 / 85 -kDa S 6 protein kinases (alpha II and alpha I isoforms, referred to collectively as pp 70 S 6 k) have been independently linked to the regulation of cell proliferation. We demonstrate that these kinases lie on the same signalling pathway and that PI 3 K mediates the {{activation of}} pp 70 by the cytokine interleukin- 2 (IL- 2). We also show that the activation of pp 70 S 6 k can be blocked at different points along the signalling pathway by using specific inhibitors of T-cell proliferation. Inhibition of PI 3 K activity with structurally unrelated but highly specific PI 3 K inhibitors (wortmannin or LY 294002) results in inhibition of IL- 2 -dependent but not phorbol ester (conventional protein kinase C [cPKC]) -dependent pp 70 S 6 k activation. The T-cell immunosuppressant rapamycin potently antagonizes IL- 2 -(PI 3 K) - and phorbol ester (cPKC) -mediated activation of pp 70 S 6 k. Thus, wortmannin and rapamycin antagonize IL- 2 -mediated activation of pp 70 S 6 k at distinct points along the PI 3 K-regulated signalling pathway, or rapamycin antagonizes another pathway required for pp 70 S 6 k activity. Agents that raise the concentration of intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) and activate cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) also inhibit IL- 2 -dependent activation of pp 70 S 6 k. In this case, inhibition appears to occur at least two points in this <b>signalling</b> <b>path.</b> Like rapamycin, PKA appears to act downstream of cPKC-mediated pp 70 S 6 k activation, and like wortmannin, PKA antagonizes IL- 2 -dependent activation of PI 3 K. The results with rapamycin and wortmannin are of added interest since the yeast and mammalian rapamycin targets resemble PI 3 K in the catalytic domain...|$|E
40|$|Cancer {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} health problems in the world, affecting a large part of the population. Although there are different treatments such as surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy, the cancer currently has no cure, in the strict sense of the word. The numbers of those affected continue to increase, and the future forecasts are not very comforting. Cancer occurs due to alterations in the genes involved in cell growth, survival and propagation, resulting in a set of common characteristics. These characteristics are known as the hallmarks of cancer, and allow to organize and rationalize this complex disease. ErbB (erythroblastic) receptors play a very important role, they’re essential mediators of cell proliferation and differentiation in the development of the embryo and adult tissues, and their inappropriate activation is associated with the development and severity of the cancer. Members of this tyrosine kinase receptor family are: EGFR (ErbB 1 or HER 1), HER 2 (Neu or ErbB 2), HER 3 (ErbB 3) and HER 4 (ErbB 4). EGFR and HER 2 are associated with cancer, since its alteration is found in most cancers. Recently, it has been seen that HER 3 receptor also has an important role, in addition, it can act as a new target to treat this disease. Each of these receptors have several ligands with which they bind to be activated, with the exception of HER 2 that isn’t known any ligand. Once activated, the receptors dimerize: homodimerization (among them) or heterodimerization (between family members). The heterodimers formed by HER 2 and HER 3 form the most robust signalling complexes of the ErbB family. One of the characteristics of HER 3 is its unique and powerful ability to activate the downstream <b>signalling</b> <b>path</b> PI 3 K and Akt. It’s key to the control of many biological processes critical for tumorigenesis. In addition, HER 3 is also associated with cancer resistance, which is the main problem of current therapies. With these evidences emphasizing the importance of HRE 3 signalling in human cancers and their resistance, today there are more than 40 different therapeutic agents that are being tested targeting HER 3, in addition to combinatorial therapies that act against different combinations of receptor...|$|E
40|$|VoIP {{call routing}} {{involves}} {{all the necessary}} tasks that a VoIP provider must perform in order to setup incoming calls from subscribers. Technology and regulatory developments allow the existence of multiple alternative ways (signalling servers) for routing a call, each one with certain attributes (for example cost, availability and call quality). This dissertation applies techniques from Operational Research and Communication Systems Evaluation. We propose and analyze policies and strategies for VoIP providers that can achieve optimal call routing by considering the expected profit from each successful call. An interesting aspect of these routing policies is the consideration of the time a caller is willing to wait until hearing the ring tone of a pending call. This characteristic allows a provider to make several attempts in order to connect a specific call. The first routing policy proposed is called 'Sequential' and suggests forwarding a call to a single signalling server each time, but allowing redials in case a previously contacted signalling server was found blocked. We propose conditions, that under some assumptions, result in optimal call routing; that is {{the selection of the}} optimal signalling server each time. The second routing policy proposed is called 'Forking' and is more generic than Sequential in the sense that allows forwarding a call request to multiple signalling servers. This policy takes advantage of a very interesting aspect of serving a call, the fact that whatever the number of providers attempting to setup a call only one of them will be able to reserve all necessary resources along the <b>signalling</b> <b>path.</b> This characteristic separates our optimization problem from similar problems found in the related work, as well as makes these routing strategies more attractive for VoIP providers. We also study the impact of Forking policy to the set of VoIP providers and owners of signalling servers. We conclude that there are cases where VoIP providers have the incentive to follow a very aggressive strategy with respect to the number of signalling servers used for each call and in relation to the socially optimum forking level. This results to the appearance of a Tragedy of the Commons type of problem. We propose an incentive mechanism that prompts VoIP providers to limit their forking level to the socially optimum. The proposed mechanism is the introduction of a signalling charge for each call setup that is attempted by a signalling server. ...|$|E
