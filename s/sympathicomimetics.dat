40|$|Retrograde {{ejaculation}} severely compromises male fertility. The use of <b>sympathicomimetics</b> for {{the treatment}} of this condition has poor results, except in patients with partial retrograde ejaculation, whose semen has a higher spermatozoa concentration. The semen of two patients with partial retrograde ejaculation was collected and frozen after the injection of a sympathicomimetic (Midodrine). The frozen/thawed samples were mixed with fresh semen recently ejaculated to obtain a minimal number of motile spermatozoa, and used for intrauterine insemination (> de 1 x 106 motile spermatozoa/ml). In both cases, pregnancies that developed satisfactorily, were obtained. (Rev Méd Chile 2000; 128 : 93 - 97...|$|E
40|$|There is no enough {{evidence}} in literature {{for the effect}} of inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting sympathico-mimetics on dental health in asthmatics. The aim {{of the study is}} to follow up the changes in dental plaque pH and dental health in asthmatics with mild persistent asthma, treated with different combinations of inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting <b>sympathicomimetics.</b> Seventy patients of both sexes, from 20 to 55 years old participated in the study. Changes in plaque pH and dental status are evaluated in two visits, in six months interval. There are no significant differences between asthmatics and controls when plaque pH values are compared. Substantially lower pH values are determined for maxillary teeth in both groups. DMFT index is significantly higher in asthmatics tha...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{investigation}} is to study the effect of inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting <b>sympathicomimetics</b> on dental health in asthmatics. Thirty patients, from 20 to 55 years old, participate in the study. D-, M-, F- and DMFT indexes are determined in a 6 months period. All participants fill in a questionnaire. Asthmatics complain most frequently from oral dryness, take frequently sugar and soft drinks and visit irregularly dental practitioners. A significant increase in M-index is found out at the second visit. F-index increases considerably for patients treated with Beclometasone and Formoterol and D-index decreases significantly when treated with Budesonide and Formoterol. DMFT index increases considerably for all patients. Highest values of DMFT index are registered for patients treated with Fluticasone propionat...|$|E
40|$|The {{number of}} asthmatics is {{continuously}} increasing {{all over the}} world. The aim {{of the study is}} to study the effect of different combinations of inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting <b>sympathicomimetics</b> on salivary and plaque pH in asthmatics with mild persistent asthma. The effect of different quantities of lactose, as gustatory corrector in the inhalers, is traced out. Thirty patients of both sexes, from 20 to 55 years old participated in the study. Salivary and plaque pH values are traced out in 30 minutes period after drug inhalation, at 6 -months interval. It is found out that inhaled drugs cause significant decrease of initial salivary pH values, the lowest ones reported on first and fifth minute after the inhalation. The average salivary pH levels on the 30 th minute remain significantl...|$|E
40|$|The {{diagnostic}} {{phase in}} a child with acute asthma should be short and comprise a brief history-taking, inspection and auscultation of the thorax, transcutaneous oxygen measurement and, if possible, peak flow measurement. Blood picture. sputum culture and chest X-ray may {{be included in the}} diagnostics if indicated. The primary treatment consists of administration of bronchodilators (beta- 2 <b>sympathicomimetics)</b> by inhalation, using a spacer. Repeated inhalation of salbutamol and ipratropium may be necessary. In case of inadequate improvement (spraying necessary every 3 hours for 24 - 48 hours), hospitalization and systemic administration of corticosteroids are indicated. Other reasons for hospitalization are a transcutaneous oxygen saturation lower than 91 %, complications such as subcutaneous emphysema and pneumothorax, exhaustion of child or parents, and rapid aggravation of the clinical picture with rising Pco 2 and falling pH in capillary or arterial bloo...|$|E
40|$|Early repolarization variant (ERV or ERPV) is a enigmatic electrocardiographic phenom-enon, {{characterized}} by prominent J wave and ST-segment elevation in multiple leads. Recently, {{there has been}} renewed interest in ERV because of similarities to the arrhythmogenic Brugada syndrome (BrS). Not much {{is known about the}} epidemiology of ERV and several studies have reported that this condition is associated with a good prognosis. Both syndromes exhibit some similarities including the ionic underlying mechanism, the analogous responses to changes in heart rate and autonomic tone, <b>sympathicomimetics</b> (isoproterenol test) as well as in sodium channel and beta-blockers. These observations raise the hypothesis that ERV may be not as benign as traditionally believed. Additionally, there are documents showing that ST-segment height in the man is greatly influenced by central sympathetic nervous activity, both at baseline and during physiologic and pharmacological stress. Central sympathetic dysfunction regularly results in multilead ST-segment elevation or J wave that decreases or below isoelectric baseline during low dose isoproterenol infusion...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{competitive}} interaction of terbutaline and two beta blockers, metoprolol and oxprenolol, with different cardioselectivity for the beta- 2 adrenoceptor. Using pharmacokinetic-dynamic modeling in nonsteady-state conditions, of the antagonism by the beta blockers of the terbutaline-induced hypokalemia, the beta blocker beta- 2 selectivity was quantitated {{in the terms}} of IC 50 values representing plasma concentrations resulting in half-receptor occupancy. Six healthy subjects were given an 0. 5 -mg s. c. dose of terbutaline on three occasions: 1) 1 hr after p. o. administration of a placebo; 2) 1 hr after 150 mg of metoprolol p. o.; and 3) 1 hr after 80 mg of oxprenolol p. o. During 7 hr after terbutaline administration drug concentrations and effects were monitored. Oxprenolol decreased both terbutaline volume of distribution (- 69 %) and clearance (- 63 %) and increased its area under plasma concentrations vs. time curve (+ 157 %). Such effects of metoprolol on terbutaline pharmacokinetics were not observed. The dynamic model offered a good description of the observed effects. The apparent IC 50 values varied between 42 and 68 ng/ml (mean, 54 ng/ml) for metoprolol and between 3. 6 and 4. 7 ng/ml (mean, 4. 1 ng/ml) for oxprenolol. In view of these results, and comparing them with apparent beta- 1 IC 50 values as reported in the literature, metoprolol can be considered a relatively beta- 1 selective agent. Pharmacokinetic-dynamic modeling of the interaction of beta- 2 <b>sympathicomimetics</b> and beta blocking agents after single dosing, seems to be a suitable method for the determination of the relative beta- 2 selectivity of the antagonis...|$|E
40|$|Background: Chronic asthma is a common, obstructive lung disease, {{affecting}} 300 {{million people}} worldwide. In the past 30 years prevalence has increased. Control of asthma is currently achieved with pharmacotherapeutic interventions such as inhaled <b>sympathicomimetics</b> and glucocorticocoids. High altitude climate therapy {{is an alternative}} method to pharmacological treatment. In the age before antibiotics, high altitude clinics in Europe were popular treatment destinations for those suffering {{from a variety of}} pulmonary disorders. Early 20 th century researchers demonstrated appreciable benefits for asthmatics sojourning at high altitude. Despite a storied history, high altitude therapy is not a common therapy for refractory asthma in the modern era. Furthermore, the efficacy and underlying mechanism of high altitude therapy for the treatment of atopic asthma remains equivocal. Method: The focus {{of this study was to}} review the contemporary literature (1992 - 2012) that focused on the efficacy of high altitude therapy for the treatment of bronchial hyperresponsiveness in atopic asthmatic children. An exhaustive search of Medline, CINAHL, and Web Of Knowledge was conducted with keyword “asthma” and “altitude”. Results: In the four studies reviewed, there was a significant decrease in total eosinophil count, no improvement in methacholine provocation challenge, a significant improvement in histamine provocation challenge, a statistically significant decrease in CD 4 lymphocyte activation, no change in total serum IgE, and weak evidence for improved lung function (FEV 1) in subjects undergoing high altitude therapy. Conclusion: The current literature is thought provoking but lacking in quality, validity, and methodology. Furthermore, small sample sizes yield underpowered outcomes and statistically insignificant results. A large randomized controlled trial, with blinding of group allocation and outcome, is needed to further assess the efficacy of high altitude therapy for the treatment of asthma.
