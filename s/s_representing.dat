In Turkish {{each of these}} are separate letters, rather than versions of other letters, where dotted capital İ and lower case i are the same letter, as are dotless capital I and lowercase ı. Typographically, Ç and Ş are often rendered with a subdot, as in Ṣ; when a hook is used, it tends to have more a comma shape than the usual cedilla.

5000|$|Over time, the {{typically}} fast back {{who played}} fullback, on offense and defense, {{was replaced by}} a heavier one who presented a greater threat to run with the ball more or less straight ahead, and to tackle his opponent trying to do the same. For this purpose, the player tended to be placed closer to the line than previously—often as far forward as the halfbacks (the offensive backs then forming a letter T, sometimes called a [...] "straight T", later to distinguish it from slight variants wherein other backs did not form a line perpendicular to that from the quarterback) or even farther forward. But the position kept being called [...] "fullback". On defense, this necessitated another position name for the fast back who played farthest back: [...] "safety man" [...] or simply [...] "safety" [...] (<b>S),</b> <b>representing</b> the last defense against a breakaway play, and the position from which to field opposing kicks. Approximately, on defense, the quarterback and fullback exchanged positions from what they'd been playing on offense, and the quarterback became the safety.|$|E

5000|$|The {{study of}} linear algebra {{emerged from the}} study of determinants, which were used to solve systems of linear equations. Calculus had two main systems of notation, each created by one of the creators: that {{developed}} by Isaac Newton and the notation developed by Gottfried Leibniz. Leibniz's is the notation used most often today. Newton's was simply a dot or dash placed above the function. In modern usage, this notation generally denotes derivatives of physical quantities with respect to time, and is used frequently in the science of mechanics. Leibniz, on the other hand, used the letter d as a prefix to indicate differentiation, and introduced the notation representing derivatives as if they were a special type of fraction. This notation makes explicit the variable with respect to which the derivative of the function is taken. Leibniz also created the integral symbol. [...] The symbol is an elongated <b>S,</b> <b>representing</b> the Latin word Summa, meaning [...] "sum". When finding areas under curves, integration is often illustrated by dividing the area into infinitely many tall, thin rectangles, whose areas are added. Thus, the integral symbol is an elongated s, for sum.|$|E
5000|$|The {{molecule}} {{can only}} exist in an excited state. The different excited electronic states {{are represented by}} symbols for the outer electron nLΓ with n the principal quantum number, L is the electronic angular momentum, and Γ is the electronic symmetry selected from the D3h group. Extra bracketed symbols can be attached showing vibration in the core: {s,dl} with <b>s</b> <b>representing</b> symmetrical stretch, d degenerate mode, and l vibrational angular momentum. Yet another term can be inserted to indicate molecular rotation: (N,G) with N angular momentum apart from electrons as projected on the molecular axis, and G the Hougen's convenient quantum number determined by G=l+λ-K. This is often (1,0), as the rotational states are restricted by the constituent particles all being fermions. Examples of these states are: 2sA1' 3sA1' 2pA2" [...] 3dE' 3DE" [...] 3dA1' 3pE' 3pA2". The 2p2A2" [...] state has a lifetime of 700 ns. If the molecule attempts to lose energy {{and go to the}} repulsive ground state, it spontaneously breaks up. The lowest energy metastable state, 2sA1' has an energy -3.777 eV below the H3+ and e− state but decays in around 1 ps. The unstable ground state designated 2p2E' spontaneously breaks up into a H2 molecule and an H atom. Rotationless states have a longer life time than rotating molecules.|$|E
50|$|The German {{economist}} Franz Hermann Schulze-Delitzsch {{is credited}} with founding the world’s first credit union in Delitzsch in the Free State of Saxony in Germany in 1850. In 1846 when crop failure and famine struck Germany he organised a mill and bakery cooperative and a “people’s bank” that provided credit to farmers. By the 1890s they had spread through most of Europe and to India. In 1901, after much correspondence with European founders, Gabriel-Alphonse Desjardins founded the first credit union in Quebec, the forerunner of current North American credit unions. In 1908 he helped a group of French American Catholics organise the first credit union in the United States at Ste. Marie Church, Manchester, New Hampshire. The U.S. credit union movement became increasingly popular in the 1920s economy when Edward Filene, a wealthy Bostonian, hired Roy Bergengren to promote the cause in the U.S. and abroad. The movement grew to more than 7,000 credit unions in the U. <b>S.</b> <b>representing</b> 100 million members. Unlike the credit unions of Germany or Quebec, most in the U.S. emerged from an employer-based bond of association. In addition to the traditional information and enforcement advantages resulting {{from the fact that}} members shared the same workplace, the employer-based bond permitted credit unions to use future paychecks as collateral. In 1954 the World Extension Department was created to give international direct assistance to credit unions, often in collaboration with government programs. A World Council of Credit Unions was created in 1971 and it now represents 97 national credit union movements with more than 172 million credit union members.|$|E

5000|$|To {{understand}} {{the way that}} AUG works, {{it is useful to}} think of wordsand phrases as atoms and expressions, respectively, in a typed language ofcombinators. For our simplified version of AUG, there are just two primitivetypes: T representing terms (for example, nouns such as [...] "friend" [...] and nounphrases such as [...] "my friend"), and <b>S</b> <b>representing</b> complete sentences (such as"my friend runs"). The only non-primitive type is of the form Oxy, denotingphrases that transform phrases of type x to modified phrases of type y; this isthe most important concept behind the AUG formalism.For example, the word [...] "my" [...] is treated as having type OTT since it is appliedto a term of type T to obtain a modified term, also of type T (every word ispre-assigned one or more types in this way). Thus the construction of the nounphrase [...] "my friend" [...] can be described by an inference:More generally, we can use the following rule to describe the application of onephrase, p of type Oxy, to another, q of type x:Clearly, types of the form Oxy correspond to function types, written as (x --> y)in more conventional notation, while the typing rule above is the standardmethod for typing the application of a function p to an argument value q.The O for function types is used in the descriptions of AUG cited above, andfor the most part we will continue to use the same notation here to avoid anyconfusion with type expressions in Haskell; in our program, the types of naturallanguage phrases are represented by data values, not by Haskell types. Anotheradvantage of the prefix O notation is that it avoids the need for parentheses andallows a more compact notation for types.The results of parsing a complete sentence can be described by a tree structure labelledwith the types of the words and phrases that are used in its construction. The following example is produced directly by the program described later from the input string [...] "my friend lives in Boston".The results of parsing a complete sentence can be described by a tree structurelabelled with the types of the words and phrases that are used in itsconstruction. The following example is produced directly by the program described later from the input string [...] "my friend lives in Boston".Notice that, to maintain the original word order, we have allowed both forwardand backward application of functions to arguments. The first of these wasdescribed by the rule above, while the second is just:For example, in the tree above, we have used this rule to apply the phrasein Boston to the intransitive verb lives; the function acts as a modifier,turning the action of [...] "living" [...] into the more specific action of [...] "living in Boston".It is sometimes useful to rearrange the trees produced by parsing a phraseso that functions are always written {{to the left of the}} arguments to which theyare applied. This reveals the applicative structure of a particular phrase andhelps us to concentrate on underlying grammatical structure without beingdistracted by concerns about word order -- which vary considerably from onelanguage to another. Rewriting the parse tree above in this way we obtain:In situations where the types of subphrases are not required, we can use aflattened, curried form of these trees, such as in Boston lives (my friend),to describe the result of parsing a phrase. The two different ways of arranginga parse tree shown here correspond to the concepts of phenotype and genotypegrammar, respectively, in AUG, but will not be discussed in any further detailhere.One of the most important tasks in an application of AUG is to assignsuitable types to each word in some given lexicon or dictionary. The type T is anobvious choice for simple nouns like [...] "friend" [...] and [...] "Boston" [...] in the example above.Possessive pronouns like [...] "my" [...] can be treated in the same way as adjectives usingthe type OTT. In a similar way, intransitive verbs, like [...] "lives", can be describedby the type OTS transforming a subject term of type T into a sentence phraseof type S. The word [...] "in", with type OTOOTSOTS, in the example above deservesspecial attention. Motivated by the diagram above, we can think of [...] "in" [...] asa function that combines a place of type T (where?), an action of type OTS(what?), and a subject of type T (who?) to obtain a sentence phrase of type S.|$|E
