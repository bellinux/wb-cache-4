5|$|Positive {{train control}} became a Federal mandate {{with the passing}} of the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008. After review, the FRA waiver was granted in May 2010, marking the first time lighter-weight EMUs were allowed to share rails with freight in the United States. The grant was {{conditioned}} on meeting nine additional requirements, including demonstrating minimum crashworthiness, seating, improving grade crossing, meeting FRA positive train control standards in Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations, part 236 with CBOSS, formalizing the temporal separation plan, and issuing a <b>safety</b> <b>system</b> program.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, the old {{section of}} Nationaltheatret Station was renovated, {{including}} tracks 1 and 2 {{and the two}} original entrances. Upgrades included new lighting, a new public address system, new escalators which have lighting that changes color, a more powerful fire <b>safety</b> <b>system,</b> improved emergency exits and replacement of cables and baldachin. The upgrade made the old section lighter, and visually similar to the new section, as it was previously painted in dark red. Between 2008 and 2012, the Norwegian National Rail Administration performed a major upgrade to the section between Lysaker and Etterstad, including the permanent way past Nationaltheatret. Among the upgrades are axle counters, mounting of an overhead conductor rail, new switches and new tracks.|$|E

40|$|Active <b>safety</b> <b>systems</b> are {{increasingly}} becoming available in trucks and passenger vehicles. Developments {{in the field}} of active safety are shifting from increasing driver comfort towards increasing occupant safety. Furthermore, this shift is seen within active safety systems: safety functions are added to existing comfort systems, rather than adding new <b>safety</b> <b>systems</b> to the vehicle. Comfort systems such as cruise control are extended via ACC to pre-crash braking systems. Testing of active <b>safety</b> <b>systems</b> must follow these developments. Whereas standardized test programs are available for passive <b>safety</b> <b>systems,</b> such test programs are hardly available yet for active <b>safety</b> <b>systems.</b> Furthermore, test programs for passive <b>safety</b> <b>systems</b> consist {{of only a handful of}} scenarios. Test programs for active <b>safety</b> <b>systems,</b> however, should consist of much more scenarios, as those systems should function well in many different situations. It is not feasible to assess the intelligent vehicle <b>safety</b> (IVS) <b>system's</b> performance in all these scenarios by means of testtrack testing. To speed up the introduction of active <b>safety</b> <b>systems,</b> there is a need for an efficient standardized test program, including alternatives to test track testing. This paper describes the vision of TNO Automotive on the developments that are expected {{in the field of}} development and evaluation of active <b>safety</b> <b>systems</b> and it explains the need for an efficient and complete test program for IVS systems, consisting of simulations, hardware-in-the-loop simulations and test track testing. © 2010 SAE International...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION More than 1. 200. 000 {{accidents}} occur {{every year}} in the european traffic with about 1. 600. 000 injured persons and 42. 000 deaths.
