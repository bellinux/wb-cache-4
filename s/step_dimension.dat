40|$|Many {{simulation}} {{data sets}} are so massive {{that they must}} be distributed among disk farms attached to different computing nodes. The data is partitioned into spatially disjoint sets that are not easily transferable among nodes due to bandwidth limitations. Conventional machine learning methods are not designed for this type of data distribution. Experts mark a training data set with different levels of saliency emphasizing speed rather than accuracy due {{to the size of the}} task. The challenge is to develop machine learning methods that learn how the expert has marked the training data so that similar test data sets can be marked more efficiently. Ensembles of machine learning classifiers are typically more accurate than individual classifiers. An ensemble of machine learning classifiers requires substantially less memory than the corresponding partition of the data set. This allows the transfer of ensembles among partitions. If all the ensembles are sent to each partition, they can vote for a level of saliency for each example in the partition. Different partitions of the data set may not have any salient points, especially if the data set has a time <b>step</b> <b>dimension.</b> This means the learned classifier for such partitions can not vote for saliency since they have not been trained to recognize it. In this work, we investigate the performance of different ensembles of classifiers on spatially partitioned data sets. Success is measured by the correct recognition of unknown and salient regions of data points...|$|E

40|$|Since the United Sate Federal Communication Commission (FCC) {{released}} the first Ultra Wide-band (UWB) report on February 14, 2002, {{the interest in}} UWB technology has increased substantially in both academia and industry. Interest is to simulate by the expectation that UWB can solve the shortage of the available frequency recourses. The European Electronics Communications Committee (ECC) has approved the use of UWB devices {{in the range from}} 6 - 8. 5 GHz, subjected to the technical limits embossed by FCC in the US. Therefore one of the main goals is to find an optimal planar-antenna working in the European (UWB) spectrum 6 - 8. 5 GHz, with a bandwidth of 2. 5 GHz. The different ntypes of antennas investigated are the dipole antenna, the square antenna (basic square antenna, square antenna with bevel, square with off set) and the circular disc antenna, designed and simulated in Advance Design System (ADS). Planar antennas implemented in this project have a multi layer PCB structure which includes a flexible foil. The design process is mainly carried out in two steps.

40|$|Potentially {{high energy}} {{dissipation}} on stepped overflow spillways would imply {{a significant reduction}} {{of the size of}} downstream stilling basins. The amount of energy loss on such spillways under skimming-flow conditions is examined experimentally for structures with a moderate number of steps and a width-to-height ratio equal to 0. 7. The experimental results, supported by dimensional considerations, indicate that the most important parameters governing energy dissipation are the ratio of the critical depth of flow passing over the spillway to the step height y(c) /h, and the number of steps N. Dissipation is highest for the small values of y(c) /h tested, near unity, and decreases with increasing y(c) /h; for a certain y(c) /h the dissipation increases with N. The results are compared to those of earlier investigations referring to a large number of steps.

40|$|Application of {{multiband}} {{systems with}} a variety of frequency band combinations is accelerating since the communication capacity is increasing and new functions like GPS or Bluetooth are being added. It is expected, therefore, that all the handsets will probably become compatible with multibands in the near future. In such multiband systems, a multiband antenna is definitely one of the key devices since it is compatible with all the frequency bands without resort to multiple antennas as is usual in today´s practices. This project deals with design of a single antenna module for different standards, i. e., to design an ultra-wideband antenna together with frequency multiplexer. The thesis focuses on the wideband antenna design. In principle, the module must be able to work with GPS, GSM, UMTS, ZigBee, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi in the 1. 5 - 2. 5 GHz band. The antenna type chosen was the dipole antenna and it was implemented using a four metal layer PCB structure wich includes a flexible material. Two different shapes were used for the dipole, square and circular. The design process is mainly carried out in two steps. In the first <b>step</b> <b>dimensions</b> of the antennas were calculated and some results were verified in Linecalc. Then, in the second <b>step,</b> <b>dimensions</b> were experimentally tuned until simulation results fulfilled the demands of the design specifications. Evaluation was done by looking at impedance bandwidth and radiation characteristics. Simulation results showed that with perfect circular discs a correct adaptation could not be obtained in the specificated frequency band and because of this an improved circular discs antenna was designed. With this new design a good result was obtained, the voltage standing wave ratio was under 3 in the whole band. With the rectangular antenna a good result was also obtained, too. In both cases, the worst behaviour {{was in the middle of}} the bandwidth. The multiplexer structure came from a theorical design. Initial transmission line parameters were calculated in Linecalc and filters are implemented with the ADS tool. Finally, the design is experimentally tuned until good simulations results were obtained. The network insertion loss is under 2. 3 dB between input port and all output ports and isolation behavior between all the different ports is satisfactory. In the end, the complete Multi-band Front-end was simulated using both antennas obtaining good behaviour for isolation and return loss parameters. In conclusion, a planar ultra wide-band front-end for GPS, GSM, UMTS, Bluetooth, WiFi, and ZigBee standards in the 1. 5 - 2. 5 GHz band using planar dipole antenna and microstrips has been designed with good simulation results...|$|R

Bedload transport processes operating in a perennial step-pool stream in central England are established using magnetically-tagged particles and bedload pit samplers. Water-surface slope in two step-pool streams is monitored in detail. Water-surface slope measurements show that step-pool bedforms cause large spatial variations in flow depth during floods, and that the temporal variation of watersurface slope during a flood wave differs diametrically from the pattern found in lowgradient rivers that have little roughness. These results demonstrate {{that it is difficult to}} estimate the forces acting on the streambed in steep, rough streams and, therefore, conventionally established flow variables cannot be used to predict bedload transport. rates in step-pool channels. Particle tracing experiments are used to determine the control that step-pool morphology and flow hycfraulics have on particle displacements. Step-pool streams exhibit smaller particle travel distance per flood event than low-gradient rivers. This difference reflects the greater flow resistance and bed rugosity of step-pool streams. Bed morphology dictates flood particle displacement at step-pool bedform scale. It is shown that entrainment, pool export rates and transport distances of coarse sediment are dependent on downstream <b>step</b> <b>dimensions,</b> <b>step</b> permeability and pool form. Large variations in bedload transport rates at any given flow strength are associated with variable sediment supply, and particle tracing demonstrates that sediment availability is controlled at unit pool scale.

40|$|Design of an {{agricultural}} machine {{is a highly}} complex process due to interactions between the operator, machine, and environment. Mountain coffee plantations constitute an economic sector that requires huge investments {{for the development of}} agricultural machinery to improve the harvesting and post-harvesting processes and to overcome the scarcity of work forces in the fields. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop a preliminary design for a virtual prototype of a coffee fruit harvester. In this study, a project methodology was applied and adapted for the development of the following steps: project planning, informational design, conceptual design, and preliminary design. The construction of a morphological matrix made it possible to obtain a list of different mechanisms with specific functions. The union between these mechanisms resulted in variants, which were weighed to attribute scores for each selected criterion. From each designated proposal, two variants with the best scores were selected and this permitted the preparation of the preliminary design of both variants. The archetype was divided in two parts, namely the hydraulically articulated arms and the harvesting system that consisted of the vibration mechanism and the detachment mechanism. The proposed innovation involves the use of parallel rods, which were fixed in a plane and rectangular metal sheet. In this <b>step,</b> <b>dimensions</b> including a maximum length of 4. 7 m, a minimum length of 3. 3 m, and a total height of 2. 15 m were identified based on the functioning of the harvester in relation to the coupling point of the tractor...|$|R
40|$|There exist several {{methods for}} {{clustering}} high-dimensional data. One popular {{approach is to}} use a two-step procedure. In the first <b>step,</b> a <b>dimension</b> reduction technique is used to reduce the dimensionality of the data. In the second step, cluster analysis is applied to the data in the reduced space. This method may be referred to as the tandem approach. An important drawback of this method is that the dimension reduction may distort or hide the cluster structure. As an alternative, various authors have proposed joint dimension reduction and clustering approaches. In this paper we review some of these existing joint dimension reduction and clustering methods for categorical data in a unified framework that facilitates comparison...|$|R

For the simulation of the McKean-Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation, instead, we use Dirichlet boundary conditions and assume the probability and its partial derivatives to be 0 on the boundary and outside the volume.|$|R

In the case where the dimension of the input vectors is two and the training examples are separable, we can prove a finite convergence, i. e., the training procedure for the network weights will stop after finite <b>steps.</b> When the <b>dimension</b> is greater than two, stronger conditions are needed to guarantee the finite convergence. ...|$|R

A path of this walk of N <b>steps</b> in three <b>dimensions</b> represents a conformation of a polymer with excluded volume interaction. Because of the self-avoiding {{nature of this}} model, the number of possible conformations is significantly reduced. The radius of gyration is generally larger {{than that of the}} ideal chain.|$|R
40|$|AbstractTo perform uncertainty, {{sensitivity}} or optimization {{analysis on}} scalar variables calculated by a cpu time expensive computer code, a widely accepted methodology consists in first identifying {{the most influential}} uncertain inputs (by screening techniques), and then in replacing the cpu time expensive model by a cpu inexpensive mathematical function, called a metamodel. This paper extends this methodology to the functional output case, for instance when the model output variables are curves. Our screening approach {{is based on the}} analysis of variance and principal component analysis of output curves. Our functional metamodeling consists in a curve classification <b>step,</b> a <b>dimension</b> reduction <b>step,</b> then a classical metamodeling step. An industrial nuclear reactor application (dealing with uncertainties in the pressurized thermal shock analysis) illustrates all these steps...|$|R
