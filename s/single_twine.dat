40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{preliminary}} revision of selectivity experiments achieved by Spanish scientists in Region 3 is presented. The species analysed were hake, blue whiting, Norway lobster, horse mackerel and megrim. In most ofthem polyamide gears were used, {{with the exception}} of a few (and old) cases with polyethylene gears. The selectivity data included in this revision were obtained in a range of years since 1968 to 1985, and the majority of them were obtained by Robles et al in 1985. All the experiences were carried out using <b>single</b> <b>twine</b> and cover codend, using research vessels. Any attempt to obtain selectivity parameters under cornmercial fishing conditions was not made in this area by Spanish scientist...|$|E
40|$|In India, {{open sea}} cage {{culture has been}} {{successfully}} demonstrated and several experimental offshore cages for mariculture were installed along the coast for on-farm demonstration by the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute, Cochin. In the present study, a model cage was fabricated and tested in a towing tank under different waves and current load conditions. The tension on the mooring chain was measured during the experimental study, besides the towing speed and wave parameters. Based on the experimental data, drag coefficient for the cage net twine was estimated. The tensions in the mooring chain and the cage net twine of the prototype cage were predicted based on the model data. The maximum tension on a <b>single</b> <b>twine</b> of the outer and inner fish net were estimated as 0. 15 N and 0. 028 N respectively. The force on the net was more than 1. 7 times the force on the floating collar and sinker pipe. The tension in the mooring line is mainly due to the force on the net. Further {{it was observed that}} the force on the net due to current was 10 times higher than that due to wave. This information will be useful in future while deciding the diameter of the cage, the type of net to be used for cage according to the site where the cage is to be installed...|$|E
40|$|Four {{different}} methods for calculating forces on and deformation of a net suspended in current have been compared. The four methods are: 1) The method presented by Løland in his PhD thesis. Uses drag and lift coefficients based on experimental values. A zero moment requirement, and iteration {{is used to}} find the deformation and forces on net elements. 2) The solution of the catenary equation adapted to a net problem. 3) FhSim, a simulation software under development by SINTEF. Finds forces by adding contributions on single twines, based on coefficients from the modified cross flow principle. 4) AquaSim by Aquastructures, a commercial analysis software package. Forces on nets found from <b>single</b> <b>twine</b> contribution. A brief presentation of the {{different methods}} is given, with a more detailed discussion of the catenary equation method. The drag and lift coefficients are compared to experimental data. The Løland and catenary equation methods are generally closest to the experimental data. An error analysis of the catenary equation for four different solidity ratios showed decreasing relative error on drag force, lift force and end point angle with increasing current velocity. At current velocity above 0. 6 m/s, all these gave a relative error of 16 % or less. The relative error of maximum tension increase with increasing current velocity. The four methods are compared with respect to drag force, lift force, and deformation. This is done with gradual increase of current velocity (case 1), and gradual increase of solidity ratio (case 2). The catenary equation and Løland method gives consistently almost equal lift force. FhSim and AquaSim also give very similar results for lift force, but the values are considerable lower than those from the other two methods. In FhSim, the low lift force is supported by relative small net deformations. Deformations according to AquaSim are larger, but still lower than those given from Løland and the catenary equation. The drag force from Løland, the catenary equation and FhSim are generally in the same range, with some partial exceptions. At relative high current velocity or solidity ratio, the drag force from AquaSim {{is found to be}} many times larger than those calculated from the other methods. Due to the drag force being calculated as contributions from every <b>single</b> <b>twine,</b> the proportionality with the projected area is reduced, leading to a significant overestimation at large deformations. Drag coefficients in FhSim should be larger for net panels with a angle relative to the current less than 60 °. The lift coefficients for panels with an angle above 45 ° should also be larger. The solidity and angle independent factor in Lølands drag formula should be reduced or neglected. Some sort of shielding effect due to twines upstream should be implemented in AquaSim to reduce the overestimation of drag force at large net deformation. The lift coefficients for the catenary equation are likely high. The method seems to be viable for aquaculture application. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{trend in}} recent years has been that the amount of wild catch is stagnating. In this {{perspective}} the selectivity of fishing gear has become an important issue. The aim of the present work has been to develop a three-dimensional model for the flow in front and inside a net structure, such as a trawl, to be able to predict and calculate selectivity of net structures. A net consist of twines which connect in knots and make up a mesh. The diameter of a twine can be from 1 [mm] in net cages up to a few centimeters in the front part of a trawl. And similar the size of the mesh can be from 1 [cm] up to the order of a meter. Typical Reynolds number range, related to the diameter of a twine, is O(10 2 − 10 4). An examination of numerical results for the drag force on plane net structure demonstrates a strong dependency of the drag force on a net structure with both the geometry, in terms of Solidity ratio, and the Reynolds number. And in particular a non-uniform relation between the drag force and the Solidity ratio. It is evident that for increasing Solidity ratios, flow interaction will become increasingly significant. The physical design of the knot part contributes largely to this flow interaction. The net structure is divided into discrete elements. The twines are modeled as separate cylinders between knots and the knots are modeled as separate spheres. Typically the total number of twines in a trawl could be in the order of 10 6 and it is thus impractical to model every <b>single</b> <b>twine.</b> It is assumed that for a given Reynolds number, keeping the Solidity ratio constant, the total drag on the trawl will be independent on the actual diameter and mesh opening of the net. First each of these different elements is modeled as a set of source distributions and single point sources. The influence from the net on the fluid flow is then calculated by representing the wake generated by each element as source distributions along the structural element. To determine the strength of these sources the principle of Lagally is applied. Then a set of equations is obtained, describing the relation between the fluid velocity and the source strength at every element. Based on this approach, a method is presented to calculate the drag force on net structures with high solidity. The method uses appropriate drag coefficients related to the geometry of the twines and the knots and account for the change in the inflow due to the presence of the net structure and at the same time changes the geometry of the net structure due to the load. Secondly the interaction between the net elements, due to the physical generation of a wake flow behind each individual element of the net, has been studied using a time-averaged wake model. Modifications are applied to the far-field mean velocity deficit mode by Schlichting (1968). This to better describe the the near-field behavior and the added effect of the wake from many individual cylindrical elements. It is shown that the wake model by Blevins (1990) can be used. The method is verified against experiments, as means of calculating the drag on plane nets as a function of Reynolds number, Solidity ratio and angle of attack and gives reasonable good agreement. During the experiments some interesting three-dimensional effects regarding the flow around cylinders were discovered. Negative lift forces occurring on the downstream cylinder in a staggered arrangement is explained as interactions due to upstream generated vortices. To create a three-dimensional method where the inflow on each of the cylinders is corrected due to the presence of all the other cylinders, these two models are added together. Further, a structural analysis of the net structure, using a FEM method, is included in the model. A more complete description of the problem is obtained by combining the change in the inflow due to the presence of the net structure, with a correction of the shape and geometry due to the drag load. Results from numerical simulation of different kinds of net structures, show that the elasticity in the net structure has a significant influence on the resulting geometry and calculated results. Further, the numerical results for net cages have been compared to experimental results. Good agreement between the numerical results and the experimental result is seen. Also the resulting geometry from the experimental results was recreated satisfactory using the present method. For three-dimensional cone shaped net structures, in contrast to net panels and net cages, the presented numerical results do not indicate a large influence on the drag force due to changes in geometry. The agreement between the numerical and experimental results for fluid velocity in front and inside of a three-dimensional net structure, compared to experimental results, was reasonably good. Quantitatively the results do not match exactly, but the characteristics of the flow are recreated. Further, based on the numerical results for the fluid velocity, pressure field in front of a cone is presented. The relative pressure gradient is shown to be minimal, and it is not likely than any fish will detect this change in pressure field neither by direct pressure sensing nor by any sound created from any shed vortices. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E

The pukupuku weaving technique uses the whatu-aho-patahi (<b>single</b> pair <b>twine)</b> method, which is very similar to the decorative geometric tāniko (fine embroidery or weaving in a geometric pattern) border designs usually seen on the kaitaka (fine flax cloak) class of cloak, and forms a thick and heavy protective garment. The awe (the tassels that fringe the outside length of the cloak) is likely to have been taken from the underside of the dog's tail. The kurupatu (plaited hem on the cloak edge) is entirely separate to the main kaupapa and made by threading separate strips together to form a length of collar that has been sewn onto the neck of the finished garment.|$|R

By now, the aliasing effect is shown by twining the cylindrical surface with the same curve: more than one axis coordinate which are not equal to zero appear on the same circle coordinate of the curve. As a result of the addition of their corresponding complex number value, the shape of the digital spectrum is no longer similar with the spectrum of the analog signal used for sampling.|$|R
