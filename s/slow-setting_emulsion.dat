40|$|One of {{the main}} issues with cold mix asphalt (CMA) {{mixtures}} is having poor abrasion resistance with low cohesion, longer curing time and low elasticity. SBR is used to improve the rheological properties of the asphalt emulsion. This paper evaluates the effect of using different percentages of SBR in unaged <b>slow-setting</b> <b>emulsion</b> (SS- 1 K) in CMA. These modified emulsions were blended at various percentages, i. e. 2 %, 4 %, 6 %, 8 % and 10 % {{of the weight of}} asphalt emulsion. The investigation focused on the rheological aspect which correlates the properties of unaged modified asphalt emulsion with its performance. Dynamic Shear Rheometer test (DSR) was used to measure the parameters of complex shear modulus, G* and phase angle, δ of the asphalt samples. Based on the results, it shows that by adding SBR in the asphalt emulsion improve the rutting resistance. From the isochronal curve, the complex modulus, G* of the modified emulsions was found higher than the unmodified emulsion. The modified emulsions show signs of improvement in binder properties in terms of elastic deformation and viscosity reduction. Therefore, it can be concluded that the SBR could improve the performance of the asphalt emulsion used in CMA...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2017 CSS- 1 H is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used <b>slow-setting</b> <b>emulsion</b> grade in Oregon. “New” engineered emulsions were recently developed in Oregon to reduce tracking, the pick-up of tack coats by construction vehicle tires during construction activities, and increase interlayer shear strength (ISS), the amount of adhesive bond present between layers of asphalt pavement. Tracking reduces the amount of tack coat in particular areas and creates a non-uniform tack coat distribution between two pavement layers. The non-uniform tack coat distribution leads to localized distresses and significant reductions in interlayer shear strength, leading to complete failure of the pavement structure. The magnitude of this effect and performance of the tack coat is dependent on tack coat type, residual application rate, temperature, existing surface condition (cracked, milled, overlay), and curing time. For this reason, reducing tracking and increasing interlayer shear strength between pavement layers becomes vital to the longevity of the pavement structure. The performance (ability to reduce tracking and increase ISS) of these emulsions, most effective application rates, the effects of pavement surface texture and traffic on ISS, and curing times were evaluated in this study. Results show that lower temperatures and increased application rates lead to longer curing times, while higher wind speeds will reduce curing times. The results indicate that tracking will decrease with increased curing time. Results show that a positive correlation between pavement surface texture and interlayer shear strength exists and that milled surfaces provide significantly higher ISS than non-milled overlay surfaces. The results indicated that there are positive correlations between rheological tests and interlayer shear strengths from field cores. The results also showed significant variances in application rates by distributor trucks. Hence {{there is a need for}} unified guidelines on tack coat QC/QA and construction practices...|$|E

40|$|An open-graded {{friction}} course (OGFC) is a special-purpose {{surface layer}} of hot-mix asphalt (HMA) pavement {{that is increasingly}} being used around the world. Owing to its numerous benefits, OGFC is being regularly used as a final riding surface on interstate and high-traffic expressways by different highway agencies in the United States. However, some OGFC sections have experienced premature failure due to ravelling only after 6 - 8 years of service life. To maintain an effective, longer service life and enhanced performance of OGFC, preventive maintenance has been considered essential. There are several approaches to maintaining OGFC, {{one of which is}} the application of a fog seal and rejuvenator seal. A fog seal can reduce ravelling and extend the service life of OGFC while a rejuvenator seal can revitalise the existing aged asphalt binder in the top OGFC layer. This research focuses on optimising the fog and rejuvenator seal application rates by evaluating their effectiveness in terms of surface friction and durability. Three types of seal material were evaluated: Pavegaard (PG) and Pavepreserve (PP) asphalt rejuvenators and a cationic <b>slow-setting</b> asphalt <b>emulsion</b> (CSS- 1 H) as a fog seal. Improvement in abrasion resistance of OGFC pavement was observed on application of fog and rejuvenator seals but surface friction was reduced to some extent. Hamburg test clearly shows a trend that the medium application rate of 0. 10 gallon/square yard is better in enhancing resistance to rutting/moisture susceptibility of OGFC...|$|R
