The four missions recommended for earliest implementation by NASA were classified as “Tier 1” missions and included CLARREO. [...] The NRC Decadal Survey concluded that the single most critical issue for current climate change observations was their lack of accuracy and low confidence in observing the small climate change signals over decade time scales.

40|$|The {{death of}} Jesse Gelsinger in 1999 during a gene therapy trial raised many {{questions}} about the ethical review of medical research. Here, the author argues that the principle of justice is interpreted too narrowly and receives insufficient emphasis and that what we permit in terms of bodily invasion affects the value we place on individuals. Medical research is a societally supported activity. As such, the author contends that justice requires that invasive medical research demonstrates sufficiently compelling <b>societal</b> <b>benefit.</b> Many consider this <b>societal</b> <b>benefit</b> to be self evident. However, medical research is a complex activity; it yields new treatments but also creates financial rewards and affects health resource allocation. As research evolves into a multibillion pound, multinational enterprise, justice requires a much broader analysis of <b>societal</b> <b>benefit.</b> Without such evaluation we risk undermining the value of bodily integrity and of research participants...|$|R

30|$|It {{is evident}} in the {{previous}} section, whether ANM or AME is considered, that most current studies of ADS planning aim at the promotion of renewable energy. In other words, they focus on the low-carbon development for the <b>societal</b> <b>benefit.</b> But for consumers, traditional reliability, voltage deviation [45] and some other targets may have failed to meet ADS planning requirements with high penetration of DG. How to coordinate the objective differences and even conflicts between the <b>societal</b> <b>benefit,</b> the consumer benefit and the distribution system companies is a significant issue. Currently, multi-objective programming is the most mature method to deal with this kind of problem. However, it is difficult to achieve satisfactory outcomes because the contradiction among various objectives is not taken into account when the model is solved in single-objective form after transformation or in multi-objective form (e.g. using NSGA-II algorithm). In addition, game theory and multi-agent methods which can well reflect the incompatibility among different goals have already been studied in [68, 69].|$|R
