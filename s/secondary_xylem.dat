5|$|Stems mainly {{provide support}} to the leaves and {{reproductive}} structures, but can store water in succulent plants such as cacti, food as in potato tubers, or reproduce vegetatively as in the stolons of strawberry plants or {{in the process of}} layering. Leaves gather sunlight and carry out photosynthesis. Large, flat, flexible, green leaves are called foliage leaves. Gymnosperms, such as conifers, cycads, Ginkgo, and gnetophytes are seed-producing plants with open seeds. Angiosperms are seed-producing plants that produce flowers and have enclosed seeds. Woody plants, such as azaleas and oaks, undergo a secondary growth phase resulting in two additional types of tissues: wood (<b>secondary</b> <b>xylem)</b> and bark (secondary phloem and cork). All gymnosperms and many angiosperms are woody plants. Some plants reproduce sexually, some asexually, and some via both means.|$|E

50|$|Fossils that appear Ginkgo-like {{are filed}} under a morphogenus called Ginkgoxylon, Ginkgomyeloxylon, or Protoginkgoxylon. Fossilized ginkgophyte wood is not {{commonly}} found in the record, possibly because it degrades easily, and possibly because {{it is difficult to}} tell apart from the much more pervasive conifer samples. Like conifer wood, it has <b>secondary</b> thin-walled <b>xylem</b> and a primary vascular system composed of eustele and bifacial vascular cambium.  The tracheids in the secondary xylem rays have pitting that occurs only on the walls and is circularly bordered.|$|R
25|$|Woody dicots {{and many}} nonwoody dicots have {{secondary}} growth originating from their lateral or secondary meristems: the vascular cambium and the cork cambium or phellogen. The vascular cambium forms between the xylem and phloem in the vascular bundles and connects {{to form a}} continuous cylinder. The vascular cambium cells divide to produce <b>secondary</b> <b>xylem</b> to the inside and secondary phloem to the outside. As the stem increases in diameter due to production of <b>secondary</b> <b>xylem</b> and secondary phloem, the cortex and epidermis are eventually destroyed. Before the cortex is destroyed, a cork cambium develops there. The cork cambium divides to produce waterproof cork cells externally and sometimes phelloderm cells internally. Those three tissues form the periderm, which replaces the epidermis in function. Areas of loosely packed cells in the periderm that function in gas exchange are called lenticels.|$|E
25|$|Secondary growth {{encompasses}} all {{growth in}} diameter, {{a major component}} of woody plant tissues and many nonwoody plants. For example, storage roots of sweet potato have secondary growth but are not woody. Secondary growth occurs at the lateral meristems, namely the vascular cambium and cork cambium. The former forms <b>secondary</b> <b>xylem</b> and secondary phloem, while the latter forms the periderm.|$|E
25|$|<b>Secondary</b> <b>xylem</b> is commercially {{important}} as wood. The seasonal variation in growth from the vascular cambium is what creates yearly tree rings in temperate climates. Tree rings {{are the basis}} of dendrochronology, which dates wooden objects and associated artifacts. Dendroclimatology {{is the use of}} tree rings as a record of past climates. The aerial stem of an adult tree is called a trunk. The dead, usually darker inner wood of a large diameter trunk is termed the heartwood and is the result of tylosis. The outer, living wood is termed the sapwood.|$|E

50|$|Tannins {{are found}} in leaf, bud, seed, root, and stem tissues. An example of the {{location}} of the tannins in stem tissue is that they are often found in the growth areas of trees, such as the <b>secondary</b> phloem and <b>xylem</b> and the layer between the cortex and epidermis.

40|$|Nitrogen (N) is a main {{nutrient}} {{required for}} tree growth and biomass accumulation. In this study, we analyzed {{the effects of}} contrasting nitrogen fertilization treatments on the phenotypes of fast growing Eucalyptus hybrids (E. urophylla x E. grandis) with a special focus on <b>xylem</b> <b>secondary</b> cell walls and global gene expression patterns. Results: Histological observations of the <b>xylem</b> <b>secondary</b> cell walls further confirmed by chemical analyses showed that lignin was reduced by luxuriant fertilization, whereas a consistent lignin deposition was observed in trees grown in N-limiting conditions. Also, the syringyl/guaiacyl (S/G) ratio was significantly lower in luxuriant nitrogen samples. Deep sequencing RNAseq analyses allowed us to identify {{a high number of}} differentially expressed genes (1, 469) between contrasting N treatments. This number is dramatically higher than those obtained in similar studies performed in poplar but using microarrays. Remarkably, all the genes involved the general phenylpropanoid metabolism and lignin pathway were found to be down-regulated in response to high N availability. These findings further confirmed by RT-qPCR are in agreement with the reduced amount of lignin in <b>xylem</b> <b>secondary</b> cell walls of these plants. Conclusions: This work enabled us to identify, at the whole genome level, xylem genes differentially regulated by N availability, some of which are involved in the environmental control of xylogenesis. It further illustrates that N fertilization can be used to alter {{the quantity and quality of}} lignocellulosic biomass in Eucalyptus, offering exciting prospects for the pulp and paper industry and for the use of short coppices plantations to produce second generation biofuels...|$|R
2500|$|In {{plants with}} {{secondary}} growth, the vascular cambium, originating between the xylem and the phloem, forms a cylinder of tissue along the stem and root. The vascular cambium forms new cells {{on both the}} {{inside and outside of}} the cambium cylinder, with those on the inside forming <b>secondary</b> <b>xylem</b> cells, and those on the outside forming secondary phloem cells. As <b>secondary</b> <b>xylem</b> accumulates, the [...] "girth" [...] (lateral dimensions) of the stem and root increases.

2500|$|Wood is a porous and fibrous {{structural}} tissue {{found in}} the stems and roots of trees and other woody plants. It is an organic material, a natural composite of cellulose fibers that are strong in tension and embedded in a [...] of lignin that resists compression. Wood is sometimes defined as only the <b>secondary</b> <b>xylem</b> in the stems of trees, or it is defined more broadly to include {{the same type of}} tissue elsewhere such as in the roots of trees or shrubs. In a living tree it performs a support function, enabling woody plants to grow large or to stand up by themselves. It also conveys water and nutrients between the leaves, other growing tissues, and the roots. Wood may also refer to other plant materials with comparable properties, and to material engineered from wood, or wood chips or fiber.|$|E
2500|$|Auxins are {{compounds}} that positively influence cell enlargement, bud formation and root initiation. They also promote {{the production of}} other hormones and in conjunction with cytokinins, they control the growth of stems, roots, and fruits, and convert stems into flowers. [...] Auxins were the first class of growth regulators discovered. They affect cell elongation by altering cell wall plasticity. They stimulate cambium, a subtype of meristem cells, to divide and in stems cause <b>secondary</b> <b>xylem</b> to differentiate. Auxins act to inhibit the growth of buds lower down the stems (apical dominance), and also to promote lateral and adventitious root development and growth. [...] Leaf abscission is initiated by the growing point of a plant ceasing to produce auxins. [...] Auxins in seeds regulate specific protein synthesis, as they develop within the flower after pollination, causing the flower to develop a fruit to contain the developing seeds. Auxins are toxic to plants in large concentrations; they are most toxic to dicots and less so to monocots. Because of this property, synthetic auxin herbicides including 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T have been developed and used for weed control. Auxins, especially 1-Naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) and Indole-3-butyric acid (IBA), are also commonly applied to stimulate root growth when taking cuttings of plants. [...] The most common auxin found in plants is indole-3-acetic acid or IAA. The correlation of auxins and cytokinins in the plants is a constant (A/C = const.).|$|E
50|$|Herbchronology is the {{analysis}} of annual growth rings (or simply annual rings) in the <b>secondary</b> root <b>xylem</b> of perennial herbaceous plants. While leaves and stems of perennial herbs die {{down at the end}} of the growing season the root often persists for many years or even the entire life. Perennial herb species belonging to the dicotyledon group (also known as perennial forbs) are characterized by secondary growth, which shows as a new growth ring added each year to persistent roots. About two thirds of all perennial dicotyledonous herb species with a persistent root that grow in the strongly seasonal zone of the northern hemisphere show at least fairly clear annual growth rings.|$|R

30|$|Wood {{formation}} (xylogenesis) in vascular {{plants is}} a complex biological process that includes cell division from secondary vascular cambium, cell elongation and differentiation, secondary cell wall deposition, programmed cell death and heartwood formation (Plomion et al., 2001). Wood consists of living and dead cells forming symplasmic and apoplasmic networks in trees. The apoplasmic system contains tracheids, vessels, and dead fibres. The symplasmic system integrates the living parenchyma cells. These living parenchyma cells in the symplasmic system perform multiple roles in sugar transport and storage, embolism repair, defence against pathogens, and <b>secondary</b> modification of <b>xylem</b> cells (Nakaba et al., 2012).|$|R

40|$|The rice {{bacterial}} blight pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae is a vascular pathogen that elicits {{a defensive}} response through interaction with metabolically active rice cells. In leaves of 12 -day-old rice seedlings, the exposed pit membrane separating the xylem lumen from the associated parenchyma cells allows contact with bacterial cells. During resistant responses, the <b>xylem</b> <b>secondary</b> walls thicken within 48 h and the pit diameter decreases, effectively reducing {{the area of}} pit membrane exposed for access by bacteria. In susceptible interactions and mock-inoculated controls, the xylem walls do not thicken within 48 h. <b>Xylem</b> <b>secondary</b> wall thickening is developmental and, in untreated 65 -day-old rice plants, {{the size of the}} pit also is reduced. Activity and accumulation of a secreted cationic peroxidase, PO-C 1, were previously shown to increase in xylem vessel walls and lumen. Peptide-specific antibodies and immunogold-labeling were used to demonstrate that PO-C 1 is produced in the xylem parenchyma and secreted to the xylem lumen and walls. The timing of the accumulation is consistent with vessel secondary wall thickening. The PO-C 1 gene is distinct but shares a high level of similarity with previously cloned pathogen-induced peroxidases in rice. PO-C 1 gene expression was induced as early as 12 h during resistant interactions and peaked between 18 and 24 h after inoculation. Expression during susceptible interactions was lower than that observed in resistant interactions and was undetectable after infiltration with water, after mechanical wounding, or in mature leaves. These data are consistent with a role for vessel secondary wall thickening and peroxidase PO-C 1 accumulation in the defense response in rice to X. oryzae pv. oryzae...|$|R
40|$|Although {{recent studies}} have {{demonstrated}} that annual growth rings are present among perennial forbs species at high northern latitudes, little is known about whether there are demarcated growth rings of perennial forbs in the Loess Plateau of China where plant growth is strongly limited by dry climate conditions and severe soil erosion. In this study, we collected the main roots of 11 perennial forbs species along the precipitation gradient in the Loess Plateau, and analyzed the growth rings in the <b>secondary</b> root <b>xylem.</b> We found that ten species showed distinct annual growth rings, and the anatomical patterns, including vessel size and density, varied considerably among different families. Our results suggest, for forbs species in the Loess Plateau, that vessel diameter in the root xylem was strongly correlated with growth rate of the forb's roots. Ring widths of the forbs showed a significant declining trend, reflecting the deteriorating signal of growth condition with age. In comparison to other families, forb species of Fabaceae usually have the evidently larger vessels that link directly to higher hydraulic capacity and growth rate. In terms of annual ring width patterns, this study provides an applicable approach to detecting effects of limited climatic conditions and life history strategies on herbaceous vegetation in the Loess Plateau.

40|$|Cinnamyl alcohol {{dehydrogenase}} (CAD; EC 1. 1. 1. 195) has been thought {{to mediate the}} reduction of both coniferaldehyde and sinapaldehyde into guaiacyl and syringyl monolignols in angiosperms. Here, we report the isolation of a novel aspen gene (PtSAD) encoding sinapyl {{alcohol dehydrogenase}} (SAD), which is phylogenetically distinct from aspen CAD (PtCAD). Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry-based enzyme functional analysis and substrate level–controlled enzyme kinetics consistently demonstrated that PtSAD is sinapaldehyde specific and that PtCAD is coniferaldehyde specific. The enzymatic efficiency of PtSAD for sinapaldehyde was ∼ 60 times {{greater than that of}} PtCAD. These data suggest that in addition to CAD, discrete SAD function is essential to the biosynthesis of syringyl monolignol in angiosperms. In aspen stem primary tissues, PtCAD was immunolocalized exclusively to xylem elements in which only guaiacyl lignin was deposited, whereas PtSAD was abundant in syringyl lignin–enriched phloem fiber cells. In the developing <b>secondary</b> stem <b>xylem,</b> PtCAD was most conspicuous in guaiacyl lignin–enriched vessels, but PtSAD was nearly absent from these elements and was conspicuous in fiber cells. In the context of additional protein immunolocalization and lignin histochemistry, these results suggest that the distinct CAD and SAD functions are linked spatiotemporally to the differential biosynthesis of guaiacyl and syringyl lignins in different cell types. SAD is required for the biosynthesis of syringyl lignin in angiosperms...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Lignification in Zinnia elegans L. stems is {{characterized}} by a burst in the production of H 2 O 2, the apparent fate of which is to be used by xylem peroxid-ases for the polymerization of p-hydroxycinnamyl alco-hols into lignins. A search for the sites of H 2 O 2 production in the differentiating xylem of Z. elegans stems by the simultaneous use of optical (bright field, polarized light and epi-polarization) and electron-microscope tools revealed that H 2 O 2 is produced on the outer-face of the plasma membrane of both differenti-ating (living) thin-walled xylem cells and particular (non-lignifying) xylem parenchyma cells. From the production sites it diffuses to the differentiating (sec-ondary cell wall-forming) and differentiated lignifying xylem vessels. H 2 O 2 diffusion occurs mainly through the continuous cell wall space. Both the experimental data and the theoretical calculations suggest that H 2 O 2 dif-fusion from the sites of production might not limit the rate of xylem cell wall lignification. It can be concluded that H 2 O 2 is produced at the plasma membrane in dif-ferentiating (living) thin-walled xylem cells and xylem parenchyma cells associated to xylem vessels, and that it diffuses to adjacent <b>secondary</b> lignifying <b>xylem</b> vessels. The results strongly indicate that non-lignifying xylem parenchyma cells are the source of the H 2 O 2 necessary for the polymerization of cinnamyl alcohols in the sec-ondary cell wall of lignifying xylem vessels...|$|R
40|$|To {{secure a}} {{sustainable}} energy {{source for the}} future, {{we need to develop}} an alternative to fossil fuels. Cellulose-based biofuel production has great potential for development into a sustainable and renewable energy source. The thick <b>secondary</b> walls of <b>xylem</b> cells provide a natural source of cellulose. As a result of the extensive production of wood through cambial activity, massive amounts of xylem cells can be harvested from trees. How can we obtain a maximal cellulose biomass yield from these trees? Thus far, tree breeding has been very challenging because of the long generation time. Currently, new breeding possibilities are emerging through the development of high-throughput technologies in molecular genetics. What potential does our current knowledge on the regulation of cambial activity provide for the domestication of optimal bioenergy trees? We examine the hormonal and molecular regulation of wood development with the aim of identifying the key regulatory aspects. We describe traits, including stem morphology and xylem cell dimensions, that could be modified to enhance wood production. Finally, we discuss the potential of novel marker-assisted tree breeding technologies...|$|R
40|$|Overexpression of the Gossypium hirsutum sucrose synthase (SuSy) gene {{under the}} control of 2 {{promoters}} was examined in hybrid poplar (Populus alba × grandidentata). Analysis of RNA transcript abundance, enzyme activity, cell wall composition, and soluble carbohydrates revealed significant changes in the transgenic lines. All lines showed significantly increased SuSy enzyme activity in developing xylem. This activity manifested in altered secondary cell wall cellulose content per dry weight in all lines, with increases of 2 % to 6 % over control levels, without influencing plant growth. The elevated concentration of cellulose was associated with an increase in cell wall crystallinity but did not alter secondary wall microfibril angle. This finding suggests that the observed increase in crystallinity is a function of altered carbon partitioning to cellulose biosynthesis rather than the result of tension wood formation. Furthermore, the augmented deposition of cellulose in the transgenic lines resulted in thicker <b>xylem</b> <b>secondary</b> cell wall and consequently improved wood density. These findings clearly implicate SuSy as a key regulator of sink strength in poplar trees and demonstrate the tight association of SuSy with cellulose synthesis and secondary wall formation...|$|R

40|$|Plant {{vasculature}} {{is required}} for the transport of water and solutes throughout the plant body. It is constituted of xylem, specialized for transport of water, and phloem, that transports photosynthates. These two differentiated tissues are specified early in development and arise from divisions in the procambium, which is the vascular meristem during primary growth. During <b>secondary</b> growth, the <b>xylem</b> and phloem are further expanded via differentiation of cells derived from divisions in the cambium. Almost all of the developmental fate decisions in this process, including vascular specification, patterning, and differentiation, are regulated by transcription factors belonging to the class III homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-ZIP III) family. This review draws together the literature describing the roles that these genes play in vascular development, looking at how HD-ZIP IIIs are regulated, and how they in turn influence other regulators of vascular development. Themes covered vary, from interactions between HD-ZIP IIIs and auxin, cytokinin, and brassinosteroids, to the requirement for exquisite spatial and temporal regulation of HD-ZIP III expression through miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation, and interactions with other transcription factors. The literature described places the HD-ZIP III family at the centre of a complex network required for initiating and maintaining plant vascular tissues...|$|R

We describe the underground system and leaf anatomy of three species of Asteraceae from the Brazilian portion of the Chaco (Pterocaulon purpurascens Malme, Wedelia trichostephia DC., and Pectis gardneri Baker), aiming to describe their structural and adaptive features using standard plant anatomy techniques. Pterocaulon purpurascens and W. trichostephia exhibited slightly thickened xylopodia, with gemmiferous character and self-grafted stem shoots; Pectis gardneri displayed a slightly-thickened tuberous root with storage substances. Longitudinal sequences of cells with highly thickened walls forming globular protrusions were found throughout {{the extension of the}} periderm of Pectis gardneri, while senescent trichomes were found in the periderm of W. trichostephia. Schyzogenous aerenchyma was found in P. purpurascens. Aquifer cells, composing vascular rays of <b>secondary</b> phloem and <b>xylem,</b> are reported for this species. Leaves of the three species are perennial and amphistomatic, with aquifer cells in a variety of tissues. Pectis gardneri exhibits a “Kranz-type” anatomy with lignified bristles with stomata.
