5|$|Rishabhanatha {{is said to}} be {{the founder}} of Jainism by the {{different}} Jain sub-traditions. Jain chronology places Rishabhanatha in ahistorical terms, as someone who lived millions of years ago. He is stated to have lived for 8,400,000 purva years. His height is described in the Jain texts to be 500 arc lengths (800 ells), or about 1,200 feet. <b>Such</b> <b>descriptions</b> of non-human heights and age are also found for the next 21 Tirthankaras in Jain texts, and according to Kristi Wiley – a scholar at University of California Berkeley known for her publications in Jainism, most Indologists and scholars consider all the first 22 of 24 Tirthankaras to be prehistorical, or ahistorical and a part of Jain mythology. However, among Jain writers and some Indian scholars, some of the first 22 Tirthankaras are considered to reflect historical figures, with a few conceding that the inflated biographical statistics as mythical.|$|E
5|$|South American aetosaurs {{have been}} found from Argentina, Brazil, and Chile. In Argentina, they are known from the Carnian Ischigualasto Formation. Common genera from Ischigualasto include Aetosauroides and Stagonolepis. In Brazil, fossils {{have been found}} in the Santa Maria and Caturrita Formations in Rio Grande do Sul (Paleorrota). Chilean aetosaurs are {{represented}} by one genus, Chilenosuchus, from the Antofagasta Region. Aetosaurs have also been found from India, which, along with South America, was part of Gondwana during the Late Triassic. Early descriptions of aetosaurs included material from the Maleri Formation in south-central India, although it was too inadequate to assign specimens to any particular genus. Based on <b>such</b> <b>descriptions,</b> the Indian aetosaurs most closely resemble Longosuchus and Paratypothorax. Reports of aetosaurs from Madagascar are based on probable crocodylomorph scutes.|$|E

2500|$|Academic {{assessments}} of Rajneesh's work {{have been mixed}} and often directly contradictory. Uday Mehta saw errors in his interpretation of Zen and Mahayana Buddhism, speaking of [...] "gross contradictions and inconsistencies in his teachings" [...] that [...] "exploit" [...] the [...] "ignorance and gullibility" [...] of his listeners. The sociologist Bob Mullan wrote in 1983 of [...] "a borrowing of truths, half-truths and occasional misrepresentations from the great traditions"... often bland, inaccurate, spurious and extremely contradictory". Hugh B. Urban also said Rajneesh's teaching was neither original nor especially profound, and concluded that most of its content had been borrowed from various Eastern and Western philosophies. George Chryssides, on the other hand, found <b>such</b> <b>descriptions</b> of Rajneesh's teaching as a [...] "potpourri" [...] of various religious teachings unfortunate because Rajneesh was [...] "no amateur philosopher". Drawing attention to Rajneesh's academic background he stated that; [...] "Whether or not one accepts his teachings, he was no charlatan {{when it came to}} expounding the ideas of others." [...] He described Rajneesh as primarily a Buddhist teacher, promoting an independent form of [...] "Beat Zen" [...] and viewed the unsystematic, contradictory and outrageous aspects of Rajneesh's teachings as seeking to induce a change in people, not as philosophy lectures aimed at intellectual understanding of the subject.|$|E
2500|$|Călinescu {{opined that}} the value of <b>such</b> <b>descriptions</b> within {{individual}} narratives grew with time, and that the author, once he had discarded lyricism, used them as [...] "a means for the senses to enjoy the fleshes and the forms that nature offers man." [...] He added that Sadoveanu's aesthetics could be said to recall the art of the Golden Age in Holland: [...] "One could almost say that Sadoveanu rebuilds in present day Moldavia [...] the Holland of wine jugs and kitchen tables covered in venison and fish." [...] Vianu also argued that Sadoveanu never abandoned himself to purely aesthetic descriptions, and that, although often depicted with Impressionistic means, nature is assigned a specific if discreet role within the plot lines, or serves to render a structure. The traditionalist Garabet Ibrăileanu, referring to Sadoveanu's poetic nature writing, even declared it to have [...] "surpassed nature." [...] At the other end, the modernist Eugen Lovinescu specifically objected to Sadoveanu's depiction of a primordial landscape, arguing that, despite adopting Realism, his rival was indebted to Romanticism and subjectivity. Lovinescu's attitude, critic Ion Simuț notes, was partly justified by the fact that Sadoveanu never truly parted with the traditionalism of Sămănătorul. In 1962, Time also commented that his style was [...] "curiously dated" [...] and recalled not Sadoveanu's generation, but that of Leo Tolstoy and Ivan Turgenev, [...] "although he has nothing like the power or skill of any of them." [...] For Călinescu and Vianu too, Sadoveanu is a creator with seemingly Romantic tastes, which recall those of François-René de Chateaubriand. Unlike Lovinescu, Vianu saw these traits as [...] "not at all detrimental to the balance of [...] art." ...|$|E
