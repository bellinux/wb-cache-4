5|$|The fusion rate in {{the core}} is in a self-correcting equilibrium: a <b>slightly</b> higher rate of fusion would cause the core to heat up more and expand <b>slightly</b> against {{the weight of the}} outer layers, {{reducing}} the density and hence the fusion rate and correcting the perturbation; and a <b>slightly</b> lower rate would cause the core to cool and shrink <b>slightly,</b> increasing the density and increasing the fusion rate and again reverting it to its present rate.|$|E
5|$|A {{loud and}} active bird, the red wattlebird {{is found in}} pairs, in a small family group, or alone during the {{breeding}} season, and gathers in larger groups of up to several hundred birds over winter. It flies straight or with a <b>slightly</b> undulating pattern, alternating between gliding and flapping its wings with quick shallow beats, at or <b>slightly</b> above {{the level of the}} tree canopy. The red wattlebird moves on the ground by hopping, cocking its tail upwards <b>slightly.</b>|$|E

5|$|At , Chad is the world's 22nd-largest country. It is <b>slightly</b> {{smaller than}} Peru and <b>slightly</b> larger than South Africa. Chad is in north central Africa, lying between latitudes 7° and 24°N, and 13° and 24°E.|$|E
5|$|Both {{platforms}} have concrete windscreens {{on either}} end and steel canopies at the portions underneath the center station building. The platforms are offset, with the southbound platform extending <b>slightly</b> to the north, and the northbound platform extending <b>slightly</b> further south. An elevator {{and a set}} of staircases and escalators from each subway platform go up to the shared fare control.|$|E

5|$|Head: The head {{should be}} broad with <b>slightly</b> {{pronounced}} eyebrows. The eyes should be kind and expressive. Appropriate eye colours are brown and hazel. The lining {{around the eyes}} should be black. The ears should hang close to the head and set <b>slightly</b> above the eyes.|$|E
5|$|In July 2015, {{after nearly}} {{ten years of}} Eris being {{considered}} the ninth-largest object known to directly orbit the sun, close-up imagery from the New Horizons mission more accurately determined Pluto's volume to be <b>slightly</b> larger than Eris's, rather than <b>slightly</b> smaller as previously thought. Eris is now the tenth-largest object known to directly orbit the sun by volume, though not by mass.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-6 is {{a yellow}} giant {{situated}} in the constellation Cygnus. The star lies {{within the field of}} view of the Kepler Mission, which discovered it as part of a NASA-led mission to discover Earth-like planets. The star, which is <b>slightly</b> larger, more metal-rich, <b>slightly</b> cooler, and more massive than the Sun, is orbited by at least one extrasolar planet, a Jupiter-sized planet named Kepler-6b that orbits closely to its star.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-9c is a gas giant that {{is smaller}} and <b>slightly</b> less massive than planet Saturn. It is {{approximately}} 0.171 MJ, or 17% {{the mass of}} planet Jupiter. It also has a radius of 0.823 RJ, which makes it <b>slightly</b> smaller (1.5%) than Saturn. The planet is, on average, situated 0.225 AU from the star.|$|E
5|$|More {{members of}} Napoleon's entourage {{can be seen}} <b>slightly</b> behind him, their robust figures accentuating Bonaparte's fragility.|$|E
5|$|On 18 July 1872, two {{passenger}} trains collided {{due to a}} pointsman's error. A few passenger were <b>slightly</b> injured.|$|E
5|$|On August 7, 2001, Gray's team issued {{their first}} mid-season {{forecast}} for the 2001 season, keeping the forecast number at 12 named storms, with 7 becoming hurricanes and 3 becoming a major hurricane, noting that sea surface temperatures and sea level pressures {{continued to be}} favorable for above-average hurricane activity. The estimated potential {{for at least one}} major hurricane to affect the U.S. was upped <b>slightly</b> once again to 69 percent; the East Coast potential also went up <b>slightly</b> to 50%, and from the Florida Panhandle westward to Brownsville, Texas, the probability was also upped <b>slightly.</b>|$|E
5|$|Oxygen {{levels in}} the {{atmosphere}} are trending <b>slightly</b> downward globally, possibly because of fossil-fuel burning.|$|E
5|$|R. r. hyrcanus (Zarudny, 1910). Breeds only in Iran; {{it is like}} R. r. buturlini, but <b>slightly</b> darker.|$|E
5|$|Sanmee {{and colleagues}} {{mention that the}} eastern North American species A.frostiana resembles A.rubrovoltata <b>slightly,</b> but the former has short grooves {{at the edge of}} a yellowish-orange cap, <b>slightly</b> larger spores, a yellow volva, and clamps at the basidial bases. Roger Heim {{reported}} A.frostiana as occurring in Thailand, but this was probably a misidentification of A.rubrovolvata.|$|E
5|$|September 20, 1961– Hurricane Esther passes {{offshore}} with <b>slightly</b> {{above normal}} tides and light winds.|$|E
5|$|Stretford {{comprises}} the local areas of Old Trafford, Gorse Hill, Trafford Park and Firswood. Its climate is generally temperate, with few extremes of temperature or weather. The mean temperature is <b>slightly</b> above {{average for the}} United Kingdom. Annual rainfall and average amount of sunshine are both <b>slightly</b> below the average for the UK.|$|E
5|$|The {{climate of}} Hale Barns – and Greater Manchester {{as a whole}} – is {{generally}} temperate, with few extremes of temperature or weather. The mean temperature is <b>slightly</b> above average for the United Kingdom; whereas annual rainfall and average amount of sunshine is <b>slightly</b> below the average for the UK.|$|E

5|$|The {{manuscript}} is {{dated to}} {{the first half of}} the 4th century and is likely <b>slightly</b> older than Codex Sinaiticus, which was also transcribed in the 4th century. One argument to support this, is that Sinaiticus already has the, at that time, very new Eusebian Canon tables, but Vaticanus does not. Another is the <b>slightly</b> more archaic style of Vaticanus, and the complete absence of ornamentation.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} girdle is well known. Both {{the left and}} right scapulae and coracoids are known, though incomplete. The scapulae are large, and robust, and thicken as they near the glenoids. The scapular blades are flat, although they are both convex along the anterior edge. Where the scapulae and coracoids articulate, the coracoids are thickest, and they become gradually thinner as they gain distance from the scapulae. The younger specimen of Patagosaurus possesses a <b>slightly</b> different morphology of the {{pectoral girdle}}, with <b>slightly</b> differing proportions, such as a <b>slightly</b> smaller scapular blade. The coracoids resemble Barapasaurus in shape, and differ from Camarasaurus, although they cannot be directly compared with those of Cetiosaurus.|$|E
5|$|The penumbral {{phase of}} the eclipse changes the {{appearance}} of the Moon only <b>slightly</b> and is generally not noticeable.|$|E
5|$|The precise {{demographics}} of the readership of street newspapers is unclear. A pair of 1993 surveys conducted by Chicago's StreetWise suggested that the paper's readers at the time tended to be college-educated, with <b>slightly</b> over half being female, and <b>slightly</b> over half unmarried.|$|E
5|$|The {{proportion}} of teachers with {{first and second}} class degrees was <b>slightly</b> lower than in their maintained counterparts.|$|E
5|$|The town's {{population}} {{is almost entirely}} Australian-born; over 90% as of 2011 compared to the average for all Australia of less than 69%. In almost all (96.9%) of homes only English is spoken, again a contrast to the Australian average of 76.8%. Median income is <b>slightly</b> higher than the country's average and {{the unemployment rate is}} <b>slightly</b> lower.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{every other}} {{variant of the}} CFM56, the -5C {{features}} a mixed-exhaust nozzle, which offers <b>slightly</b> higher efficiency.|$|E
5|$|Unlike galagos, {{which have}} longer legs than arms, slow lorises have {{arms and legs}} of nearly equal length. Their intermembral index (ratio of arm to leg length) averages 89, {{indicating}} that their forelimbs are <b>slightly</b> shorter than their hind limbs. As with the slender lorises, their arms are <b>slightly</b> longer than their body, but the extremities of slow lorises are more stout.|$|E
5|$|WASP-44 is a G-type star in {{constellation}} Cetus {{that has}} the Jupiter-size planet WASP-44b in orbit. The star is <b>slightly</b> less massive and <b>slightly</b> smaller than the Sun; it is also <b>slightly</b> cooler, but is more metal-rich. The star was observed by SuperWASP, an organization in search of planets, starting in 2009; manual follow-up observations used WASP-44's spectrum and measurements of its radial velocity led {{to the discovery of}} the transiting planet WASP-44b. The planet and its star were presented along with WASP-45b and WASP-46b on May 17, 2011 by a team of scientists testing the idea that Hot Jupiters tend to have circular orbits, an assumption that is made when the orbital eccentricity of such planets are not well-constrained.|$|E
