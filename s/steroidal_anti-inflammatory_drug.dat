50|$|After surgery {{make sure}} not to smoke or use any {{nicotine}} products as that affects the healing process by limiting blood flow. Also, don’t use any NSAIDS (non <b>steroidal</b> <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>drug)</b> as that will also affect the blood flow and the healing {{to the area of}} fracture. Do not put weight on the area where the fracture and surgery occurred until informed by your doctor and that could lead to other and future problems. After surgery and the surgical stitches are removed you will be put into a cast to complete the healing process. During follow ups an X-ray or a CT scan may be used to verify that the fracture is healing properly and is now in the anatomical correct position.|$|E

(with Andrew Dillin and Richard Morimoto) (a NASDAQ public company) and Misfolding Diagnostics (with Xin Jiang and Justin Chapman; a private corporation). The Kelly laboratory discovered the first regulatory agency-approved drug that slows the progression of a human amyloid disease [...] using a structure-based design approach. This drug, now called Tafamidis or Vyndaqel, slowed the progression of familial amyloid polyneuropathy in an 18-month placebo controlled trial and in a 12-month extension study sponsored by FoldRx Pharmaceuticals (acquired by Pfizer in 2010). Vyndaqel or Tafamidis [...] was approved {{for the treatment of}} Familial amyloid Polyneuropathy by the European Medicines Agency in late 2011 and subsequently has been approved in > 30 countries. A second statistically significant clinical trial with the repurposed Merck Non <b>steroidal</b> <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>drug,</b> diflunisal discovered by Kelly to kinetically stabilize TTR, confirms the validity of the kinetic stabilizer mechanism to ameliorate the TTR amyloidoses. [...] Collectively, the tafamidis and diflunisal data provide compelling pharmacologic evidence supporting the amyloid hypothesis, the idea that active transthyretin aggregation causes the loss of post-mitotic tissue in this degenerative amyloid disease. Moreover, these data validate transthyretin as a key drug target to stop the progression of several degenerative phenotypes linked to transthyretin aggregation.|$|E
