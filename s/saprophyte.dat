5|$|Stropharia caerulea, {{commonly}} known as the blue roundhead, is an inedible species of agaric fungus in the family Strophariaceae. It is a common species found in Europe and North America, where it grows as a <b>saprophyte</b> in meadows, roadsides, hedgerows, gardens, and woodchip mulch. S.caerulea was officially described to science in 1979, although it was known to be a distinct species for about two centuries before that. The taxon Stropharia cyanea, as defined by Risto Tuomikoski in 1953, and used by several later authors, is a synonym of S.caerulea.|$|E
5|$|Auricularia auricula-judae grows {{upon the}} wood of {{deciduous}} trees and shrubs, favouring elder. In up to 90% of cases, the mushroom is found on elder, but it is often incorrectly assumed to grow exclusively on elder. It has also been recorded on Acer pseudoplatanus (known in the United Kingdom as sycamore), beech, ash, spindle, and in one particular case, the sycamore draining board of an old sink in Hatton Garden. Recently, A. auricula-judae has been recorded from semi-evergreen to evergreen and wet evergreen shola forests in the Western Ghats, India. This species occurs scattered and in clusters on dead or dying branches of trees, on main trunk, decaying logs, etc. This species occurs during the monsoon period in large imbricate clusters and under high humid conditions produces exceptionally large sized basidiomes. A. auricula-judae growing in wet evergreen and shola forests shows remarkable variation in size, shape and colour. In Australia, it is found in Eucalyptus woodland and rainforests; in the rainforests, it can grow in very large colonies on fallen logs. It favours older branches, where it feeds as a <b>saprophyte</b> (on dead wood) or a weak parasite (on living wood), and it causes white rot.|$|E
500|$|Like {{all members}} of its genus, Roridomyces austrororidus grows as a <b>saprophyte</b> on rotting wood. In Australia, the fungus fruits in {{clusters}} or groups on rainforest trees, decayed logs, fallen Eucalyptus branches, Bedfordia salicina logs and branches, and Nothofagus cunninghamii [...] logs. Fruiting usually occurs after rainy periods from April to June, although the mushroom has also been collected in August. New Zealand collections {{have been reported to}} grow on Pinus, Leptospermum, and Ripogonum. A study of fungal succession in a wet eucalypt forest in Tasmania demonstrated that R.austrororidus prefers mature forests (with at least 70 years of growth since the last wildfire), and fruits on small diameter wood—typically twigs with a width less than [...]|$|E

2500|$|C. sepidonicus spreads by {{contaminated}} soil, surfaces, infected seed, wash waters, infected potato waste, etc. It {{can survive}} on warehouse walls, boxes, bags etc. On machinery in dry conditions, it can survive {{at least a}} month - sometimes in the form of dried bacterial ooze. [...] It is also able to overwinter in soil in association with plant debris. C. sepidonicus will only survive in the soil as long as the host tissue in which it resides persisits and resists decomposition by saphrophtytic microorganisms in the soil. This poor ability to compete as a <b>saprophyte</b> {{in the absence of a}} susceptible host makes Clavibacter sp. known as soil invaders as opposed to soil inhabitants.|$|E

40|$|The most {{frequent}} cause of {{visits to the}} gynecologist {{in the western world}} is vaginal discomfort (vaginitis and vaginosis) whose origin lies in the uncontrolled proliferation of bacteria, such as haemophilus vaginalis or Candida-type fungi, normally considered as <b>saprophytes.</b> Such uncon-trolled development of <b>saprophytes</b> is caused by some types of aggression against Döderlein bacil-li and/or by a significant decrease in the amount of lactic acid (use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, douches with aggressive products, etc.). Consequently, as the vagina creates a progressively alka-linized and increasingly inadequate environment for the lactobacilli activity, a more favorable en-vironment for the growth of <b>saprophytes</b> is created. The more alkaline the medium becomes, the lower the production of lactic acid. Therefore a vicious circle is created, resulting in the bacillus acidophilus near the lack of metabolism and the disappearance of lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide and bacteriocins. All of the above make it possible for saprophytic bacteria to proliferate and be-come pathogenic. So far, all vaginitis and vaginosis treatments have solely been focused on at...|$|R

50|$|L. monocytogenes {{can act as}} a <b>saprophyte</b> or a pathogen, {{depending}} on its environment. When this bacterium is present within a host organism, quorum sensing causes the up-regulation of several virulence genes. Depending on the location of the bacterium within the host organism, different activators up-regulate the virulence genes. SigB, an alternative sigma factor, up-regulates Vir genes in the intestines, whereas PrfA up-regulates gene expression when the bacterium is present in blood. Little is known about how this bacterium switches between acting as a <b>saprophyte</b> and a pathogen; however, several noncoding RNAs are thought to be required to induce this change.|$|E
