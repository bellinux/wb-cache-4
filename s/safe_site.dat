40|$|Goal: To {{provide an}} {{alternative}} to the usual bet-hedging explanation for delayed germination, one that takes account of known facts about germination in stable, fine-grained environments. Context: Small patches with local environmental conditions (microhabitats) such that seedlings can establish themselves are customarily called <b>safe</b> <b>sites.</b> Key Assumptions: We focus on a single species. Its <b>safe</b> <b>sites</b> become available randomly. Seeds that germinate outside <b>safe</b> <b>sites</b> all die as seedlings. All seeds are equal, i. e. their probability of dying over the year and probabilities to germinate when the right season is there do not depend on their age or any other aspect of their individual history. Moreover, we make the standard assumption of ESS theory that the population is genetically homogeneous but for the occasional mutant 'testing the ESS'. There is a trade-off between the germination probability in <b>safe</b> <b>sites</b> and the probability not to germinate outside <b>safe</b> <b>sites.</b> For germination strategies close to the ESS, the environment does not fluctuate. Procedure: Start with a simple population model, in which the yearly seed survival and the fraction of the area covered by <b>safe</b> <b>sites</b> are fixed quantities. For this model, derive an optimization principle that finds the Evolutionarily Steady Strategy vector consisting of the probabilities to germinate in <b>safe</b> <b>sites</b> and elsewhere. Using this optimization principle, analyse the effect of various trade-offs using Levins' fitness set technique. Analyse how the results extend to ESSs for general life histories and community dynamics subject only to the key assumptions. Conclusion: Seeds in <b>safe</b> <b>sites</b> should not all germinate on the first opportunity if the relationship between the probability to germinate in <b>safe</b> <b>sites</b> and the probability to germinate elsewhere is accelerating and has a sufficiently steep slope at the highest germination probabilities...|$|R

40|$|The {{vegetation}} of fallow {{fields of}} different {{age in the}} terraced agricultural landscape of Pantelleria Island (Sicily) was analysed via vegetation relevés. Five age classes in N-facing {{as well as in}} S-facing slopes of both vine and caper fallows were differentiated. The main questions were to determine the sequence of plant communities in time and to test some environmental factors for their influence on the course and the speed of succession. 	The results show that undisturbed abandoned terraces are subject to rapid renaturation: 50 to 80 years old fallows are now covered by dense maquis communities. Both N- and S-facing slopes seem to converge to a Quercus ilex woodland as the climax community. However, the succession pathways differ in terms of communities included as well as in their temporal occurrence. Woody species invasion into fallows is slower on South-facing than on North-facing slopes. Ordination with DCA revealed that age of a fallow, exposition and the presence of <b>safe</b> <b>sites</b> are the most influential environmental factors. <b>Safe</b> <b>sites</b> were provided by former crop plants traditionally planted in artificial depressions, and are more quickly colonized by maquis saplings than areas not classified as <b>safe</b> <b>sites.</b> The predictable sequence of plant communities in the course of succession can be “frozen” by a few species able to form almost monospecific stands.

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} was to explain black spruce {{regeneration}} in postfire sheep laurel (Kalmia angustifolia L., hereafter referred to as Kalmia) dominated chronosequence in light of <b>safe</b> <b>site</b> density. The concept of <b>safe</b> <b>site</b> was expanded by including germination as well as seedling establishment and growth phases. Proliferation of Kalmia, which dominates heathlands of eastern Newfoundland, {{has been reported to}} severely restrict conifer recruitment and growth. As a result, forest regeneration in Kalmia heath can be delayed by as much as 60 years. Despite numerous studies, the process by which colonization and establishment of black spruce occurs in Kalmia heath is poorly understood. This problem is addressed in two chapters. In chapter one, it was hypothesized that post-fire black spruce stem density, which represents a relative measure of <b>safe</b> <b>site</b> abundance per plot, is a function of variation in microsite conditions, rather than time since fire. The second hypothesis was that the partially safe sites defined by seedling establishment, but poor seedling growth, overtime, become safe sites allowing a growth release. In chapter two, it was hypothesized that microsites created by scarification and microsite mulching (MSM) enhance black spruce growth by removing the inhibitory effects of Kalmia and its organic matter by increased decomposition and soil moisture. The main findings of the research are (1) black spruce <b>safe</b> <b>site</b> density in post-fire sites is low and diminishes over time; (2) relative <b>safe</b> <b>site</b> density is negatively associated with organic matter thickness; (3) most of the recruited black spruce experience a period of stunted growth; (4) with time, stunted black spruce may overcome the growth check; (5) the likelihood of the growth release has an inverse relationship with OM thickness and positive relationship with OM decomposition; (6) young black spruce seedlings planted in artificially created safe sites show significantly higher growth rates compared to those in undisturbed heath. Based on these results, it was concluded that i) safe sites {{play a critical role in}} colonization and growth of black spruce, ii) high OM depth (> 5 cm) makes a microsite unsafe for black spruce regeneration, and iii) safe sites created by scarification and microsite mulching (MSM) can enhance black spruce regeneration in Kalmia health. By examining the problems of black spruce forest regeneration in Kalmia dominated sites, this study advances the current understanding of the <b>safe</b> <b>site</b> concept and its application in forest restoration. From the conceptual point of view, it revealed the need for extending the <b>safe</b> <b>site</b> concept beyond the germination stage to include seedling and adult life stages.
