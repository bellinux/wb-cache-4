40|$|Loss to {{follow-up}} (LTFU) is {{a common}} problem in many epidemiological studies. In antiretroviral treatment (ART) programs for patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), mortality estimates can be biased if the LTFU mechanism is non-ignorable, that is, mortality differs between lost and retained patients. In this setting, routine procedures for handling missing data may lead to biased estimates. To appropriately deal with non-ignorable LTFU, explicit modeling of the missing data mechanism is needed. This can be based on additional <b>outcome</b> <b>ascertainment</b> for a sample of patients LTFU, for example, through linkage to national registries or through survey-based methods. In this paper, we demonstrate how this additional information {{can be used to}} construct estimators based on inverse probability weights (IPW) or multiple imputation. We use simulations to contrast the performance of the proposed estimators with methods widely used in HIV cohort research for dealing with missing data. The practical implications of our approach are illustrated using South African ART data, which are partially linkable to South African national vital registration data. Our results demonstrate that while IPWs and proper imputation procedures can be easily constructed from additional <b>outcome</b> <b>ascertainment</b> to obtain valid overall estimates, neglecting non-ignorable LTFU can result in substantial bias. We believe the proposed estimators are readily applicable to a growing number of studies where LTFU is appreciable, but additional outcome data are available through linkage or surveys of patients LTFU.

This study aimed to estimate key parameters, including effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, for delivering a definitive effectiveness {{trial of a}} pregnancy specific, theory-guided, tailored text message cessation intervention. Methods: Multicentre, single-blinded, randomised controlled trial. Pregnant smokers (< 25 weeks gestation) were recruited from 16 antenatal screening clinics in England. Control participants received usual care and a smoking cessation leaflet. Intervention participants received the control components plus 12 weeks of individually-tailored, automated, interactive, cessation text messages (MiQuit).

40|$|Databases are {{electronic}} filing {{systems that have}} been set up to capture patient data in a variety of clinical and administrative settings. While randomised controlled trials are the gold standard for the evaluation of healthcare interventions, electronic databases are valuable research options for studies of aetiology and prognosis, or where trials are too expensive/not logistically feasible. However, databases exist in many different settings and formats (often developed for administrative or financial reimbursement purposes rather than clinical research), and researchers need to put careful thought into identifying and acquiring relevant data sets. Accuracy of records and validation of diagnoses are key issues when planning a database study. High-quality databases can readily capture outcome data (as part of routine clinical care) without the costs and burden of additional trial-related follow-up, and there are promising hybrid models which combine the benefits of randomisation with the efficiency of <b>outcome</b> <b>ascertainment</b> using existing databases...|$|R

Of 182 relevant studies in the Cochrane review, 49 were related to ART. Statistical pooling was not warranted due to heterogeneity in interventions, participants, treatments, adherence measures and outcomes. Many studies had high risk of bias in elements of design and <b>outcome</b> <b>ascertainment.</b> Only 10 studies improved both adherence and clinical outcomes. These used the following interventions: adherence counselling (two studies); a once-daily regimen (compared to twice daily); text messaging; web-based cognitive behavioral intervention; face-to-face multi-session intensive behavioral interventions (two studies); contingency management; modified directly observed therapy; and nurse-delivered home visits combined with telephone calls.

30|$|Our study {{builds on}} {{existing}} music-exercise literature in several additional ways. First, {{to the best}} of our knowledge, ours is the first study to have examined the longitudinal adherence-effects of an exercise-music strategy within a structured exercise program. Until now, the vast majority of studies exploring the effects of music in exercise have been cross-sectional in design and/or narrow in <b>outcome</b> <b>ascertainment,</b> with most studies limited to ergonomic and/or perceptual outcomes [8 - 16, 44 - 46]. Second, we employed a novel integrated audio-playlist strategy where patient preferences informed the choices of musical genres and artists but where exercise pace restricted the playlist selection to those songs whose music tempos approximated individuals’ program-prescribed steps per minute. Third, our study demonstrated that RAS-enhancements, which were designed to accentuate the auditory cues associated with tempo-pace synchrony [24, 27], were accomplished feasibly using commercially available customized playlists. Moreover, such RAS-enhanced playlists were incrementally efficacious in improving long-term physical activity behaviours. Finally, ours, {{to the best of}} our knowledge, is the first to compare the behavioural outcomes associated with a personalized music strategy against an evidence-based gold-standard usual-care control, which itself, has been associated with a 20 % improvement in long-term survival [4].|$|R
