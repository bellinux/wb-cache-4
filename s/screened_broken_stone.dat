40|$|The {{problem of}} the paper is drawing up of the project on {{protection}} {{the territory of the}} Metallurgical terminal of port Ust’-Luga from flooding by the superficial and ground waters. At first, authors gather and analyze materials about topographic, geological and hydrographic situation on above-stated territory and after that made their own territory research. As a result, to protect Metallurgical terminal from flooding by the superficial and ground waters, it was offered three variants of collectors: 1. Open channel 2. <b>Broken</b> <b>stone</b> absorbing well with punched pipe 3. <b>Broken</b> <b>stone</b> absorbing well Authors calculate parameters of collectors and compare them. The most suitable collector for port conditions is <b>broken</b> <b>stone</b> absorbing well with punched pipe because of this reliability and compactness...|$|R

50|$|Finally a third {{layer of}} hard <b>broken</b> <b>stone,</b> (about {{the size of}} walnuts) was spread by a shovel to produce the surface layer.|$|R

50|$|Rubble is <b>broken</b> <b>stone,</b> of {{irregular}} size, {{shape and}} texture; undressed especially as a filling-in. Rubble naturally {{found in the}} soil is known also as ''''brash'''' (compare cornbrash). Where present, it becomes more noticeable when the land is ploughed or worked.|$|R

6000|$|... "We {{have got}} {{a bit out of}} a <b>broken</b> <b>stone,</b> Bertie. This <b>stone</b> had been <b>broken</b> before, and evidently not by accident. It is only half the {{thickness}} of the others, and, as you can see, there is another slab underneath." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Broken</b> <b>stone</b> was wedged {{into the}} spaces between the tapered {{perpendicular}} faces to provide the layer with good lateral control. Telford kept the natural formation level and used masons to camber the upper surface of the blocks. He placed a 6 in layer of stone no bigger than 6 cm {{on top of the}} rock foundation. To finish the road surface he covered the stones with a mixture of gravel and <b>broken</b> <b>stone.</b> This structure {{came to be known as}} [...] "Telford pitching." [...] Telford's road depended on a resistant structure to prevent water from collecting and corroding the strength of the pavement. Telford raised the pavement structure above ground level whenever possible.|$|R

50|$|Opus emplectum is an {{advanced}} construction art relying on structuring {{both sides of}} the wall with hewn stone blocks and fulfilling area between them with <b>broken</b> <b>stones</b> with mortar. The good example of this technique are ruins of the romanesque tower in Strzelno.|$|R
60|$|The {{next few}} minutes, {{or more likely}} half an hour, passed with Jones and me {{separated}} from each other by a wall of <b>broken</b> <b>stone,</b> waiting impatiently for Jim and Emett, while the hounds bayed one lion and I watched the other.|$|R
60|$|Before his horror-struck {{eyes the}} golden-hair from the <b>broken</b> <b>stone</b> grew and grew; {{and as it}} increased, so his heart got colder and colder, till at last he had not power to stir, and sat with eyes full of terror {{watching}} his doom.|$|R
50|$|Lying loose, {{close to}} these {{monument}}s, is a <b>broken</b> <b>stone</b> crest. There {{is also a}} monument of Sir Robert Tyrwhitt and his wife Elizabeth Oxenbridge in Bigby church, Lincolnshire, dated 1581, which unlike the monument in Leighton church, included effigies of all his twenty-two children.|$|R
5000|$|The novel {{itself is}} an {{expansion}} of an earlier short story, [...] "Eyes I Dare Not Meet in Dreams", that appeared in his 1990 collection Prayers to <b>Broken</b> <b>Stones.</b> Original ideas and characters behind much of Simmons's subsequent works {{can be found in}} this collection.|$|R

A stone crusher was {{installed}} in Manila at the bridge site and stone was crushed for concrete there.|$|R
50|$|The roof is {{supported}} by two sets of stone columns, twelve externally and four internally. The ambalama has two <b>broken</b> <b>stone</b> columns on the northeastern side. The local villagers claim that the columns were constructed this way deliberately when the ambalama was built to ward off inauspicious omens.|$|R
5000|$|In 2015 Anish Kapoor, a Turner Prize-winning artist, created {{controversy}} {{with his}} sculpture entitled [...] "Dirty Corner", a [...] "massive steel funnel set in <b>broken</b> <b>stone,</b> {{placed in the}} garden of the...Palace of Versailles", which he claims is a depiction of the vagina of the former Queen of France.|$|R
5000|$|The Day Cemetery : Con 1 Lot 19 North Oxford. Since the {{cemetery}} was neglected for many years, the <b>broken</b> <b>stones</b> have been gathered and imbedded in cement in four rows, arranged in alphabetical order. Owned by the municipality {{and is considered}} to be an abandoned (inactive) cemetery.|$|R
5000|$|In 1303-06 {{building}} {{works at}} [...] "Aber" [...] {{were carried out}} on a large scale, including the importation of <b>broken</b> <b>stone</b> and of lime for mortar. The remains of the other candidate for such work, the high-status early mediaeval site, on and near the mound known as the Mŵd, do not now have masonry of <b>broken</b> <b>stone</b> and {{may not have been}} large enough to justify the quantities of material recorded. In 1553 Rhys Thomas and his wife Jane acquired the house from the Crown. The present roof timbers were felled between 1619 and 1624. Six phases of the building have been identified, suggesting a long history before the present roof timbers were put on. The tower may be a slightly later addition, and there were further additions in the early eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.|$|R
60|$|The whole party {{moved on}} together. The weather was bad, with {{alternating}} sleet and rain, {{and the path}} broken and difficult. July 4 found them at the Stony Mountains, a rugged and barren set of hills that seemed from a distance like a pile of <b>broken</b> <b>stones.</b> Nine days more of arduous travel brought the warriors in sight of their goal. From the elevation of the low hills that rose above its banks, Hearne was able to look upon the foaming waters of the Coppermine, as it plunged over the <b>broken</b> <b>stones</b> of its bed {{in a series of}} cascades. A few trees, or rather a few burnt stumps, fringed the banks, but the trees which here and there remained unburned were so crooked and dwarfish as merely to heighten the desolation of the scene.|$|R
50|$|<b>Broken</b> <b>stone</b> {{from the}} {{quarries}} was dumped into a storage bin and fed by gravity into a primary jaw crusher. Secondary crushing {{was done by}} a gyratory crusher. The material was elevated to screens, where it was graded and deposited into a bin divided into compartments for the various sizes.|$|R
