We knew nothing where we were, or upon what land it was we were driven—whether an island or the main, whether inhabited or not inhabited. As the rage of the wind was still great, though rather less than at first, we could not so much as hope to have the <b>ship</b> <b>hold</b> many minutes without breaking into pieces, unless the winds, by a kind of miracle, should turn immediately about. In a word, we sat looking upon one another, and expecting death every moment, and every man, accordingly, preparing for another world; for there was little or nothing more for us to do in this. That which was our present comfort, and all the comfort we had, was that, contrary to our expectation, the ship did not break yet, and that the master said the wind began to abate.|$|E

5000|$|The {{capture of}} the three British frigates stimulated the British to greater exertions. More vessels were {{deployed}} on the American seaboard and the blockade tightened. On June 1, 1813, off Boston Harbor, the frigate , commanded by Captain James Lawrence, was captured by the British frigate [...] under Captain Philip Broke. Lawrence was mortally wounded and famously cried out, [...] "Don't give up the <b>ship!</b> <b>Hold</b> on, men!" [...] The two frigates were of near-identical size. Chesapeakes crew was larger but most had not served or trained together. British citizens reacted with celebration and relief that the run of American victories had ended. Notably, this action was by ratio one of the bloodiest contests recorded during this age of sail, with more dead and wounded than HMS Victory suffered in four hours of combat at Trafalgar. Captain Lawrence was killed and Captain Broke was so badly wounded that he never again held a sea command.|$|E

5000|$|Willoughby {{eventually}} {{crossed the}} Barents Sea and reached Novaya Zemlya. He {{spent some time}} sailing along the coast, then turned south towards Scandinavia. However {{at the mouth of}} the Varzina River on the coast to the east of present-day Murmansk the ship became trapped in ice. Willoughby and his crew were found a few years later by Russian fisherman who stumbled across the ship frozen in ice. Forcing entry into the ship, they found the bodies of Willoughby and his men frozen solid. It has been assumed that the men froze after a cold Russian winter aboard the ship, however, Willoughby and his men were well supplied for a winter aboard a ship - they had supplies of food enough for a journey meant for Asia and they had many woollen garments meant for trading in any destination they might have ended up in. It has therefore been posited by historians that Willoughby and his crew died not from exposure to the elements, but from carbon monoxide poisoning. The surrounding bay would have had ample supplies of sea coal and it was likely that men would have been sent out to gather material to keep them warm, and any combustion of sea coal in an enclosed area could easily have led to their deaths in a small <b>ship</b> <b>hold.</b> At any rate, Willoughby sent out scouts in various directions with the instruction to return after three days travelling if they had not found any human contact. All of these journeys failed.|$|E

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of a container terminal depends {{primarily on the}} smooth and orderly process of handling containers, especially during the ship's loading procedure. The loading plan is mainly determined by two considerations: ship stability and minimum number of rehandles required. These two basic considerations are often in conflict. Most containerships have a cellular structure, imposing a strong restriction {{on the order of}} the container loading sequence. To preserve a ship's stability, some containers may be stowed in a <b>ship</b> <b>hold</b> in middle vertical locations. A similar loading problem exists in the stacking of yard containers. If these containers are stacked in the yard under others which are to be picked up later, then the loading process requires a number of container rehandles. This paper is concerned with a ship's container load planning which satisfies these two considerations and minimises the number of rehandles.

40|$|Fire {{environments that}} occur on cargo ships differ {{significantly}} from the fire environments found in land transport. Cargo ships typically carry {{a large amount of}} flammable fuel for propulsion and shipboard power, and may transport large quantities of flammable cargo. As a result, sea mode transport accident records contain instances of long lasting and intense fires. Since Irradiated Nuclear Fuel (INF) casks are not carried on tankers with large flammable cargoes, most of these dramatic, long burning fires are not relevant threats, and transport studies must concentrate on those fires that are most likely to occur. By regulation, INF casks must be separated from flammable cargoes by a fire-resistant, liquid-tight partition. This makes a fire in an adjacent <b>ship</b> <b>hold</b> the most likely fire threat. The large size of a cargo ship relative to any spent nuclear fuel casks on board, however, may permit a severe, long lasting fire to occur with little or no thermal impact on the casks. Although some flammable materials such as shipping boxes or container floors may exist in the same hold with the cask, the amount of fuel available may not provide a significant threat to the massive transport casks used for radioactive materials. This shipboard fire situation differs significantly from the regulatory conditions specified in 10 CFR 71 for a fully engulfing pool fire. To learn more about the differences, a series of simple thermal analyses has been completed to estimate cask behavior in likely marine and land thermal accident situations. While the calculations are based on several conservative assumptions, and are only preliminary, they illustrate that casks are likely to heat much more slowly in shipboard hold fires than in an open pool fire. The calculations also reinforce the basic regulatory concept that for radioactive materials, the shipping cask, not the ship, is the primary protection barrier to consider...|$|E
