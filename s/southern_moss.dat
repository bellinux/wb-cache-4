40|$|Anisotropic (direction-dependent) long-distance {{dispersal}} (LDD) by {{wind has}} been invoked {{to explain the}} strong floristic affinities shared among landmasses in the Southern Hemisphere.

Weused global winds coverage from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration SeaWinds scatterometer to test whether floristic similarities of <b>Southern</b> Hemisphere <b>moss,</b> liverwort, lichen, and pteridophyte floras conform better with (i) the anisotropic LDD hypothesis, which predicts that connection by “wind highways” increases floristic similarities, or (ii) a direction-independent LDD hypothesis, which predicts that floristic similarities among sites increase with geographic proximity. We found a stronger correlation of floristic similarities with wind connectivity than with geographic proximities, which supports the idea that wind is a dispersal vehicle for many organisms in the Southern Hemisphere.

50|$|The {{early years}} of the 'Victoria Park Company' were of mixed fortune. The {{original}} plans to develop land in a slightly different area, did not reach complete fruition, largely due to the fraud which led to the Foss v. Harbottle case. A cul-de-sac of villas was built opposite Whitworth Park, and these were later demolished for the construction of the Royal Infirmary. The fraud, or rather a complex connected series of frauds, related to the original development along Moss Lane East. Drainage techniques of the time were insufficient to support the developers' ambitions, and the large tranche of land they owned was not built on until several decades later. Some of the original villas remain on the <b>southern</b> side of <b>Moss</b> Lane East, between Wilmslow Road and Monton Street. They are attractive and spacious buildings.|$|R
40|$|A TWINSPAN {{classification}} {{divides the}} <b>moss</b> flora of <b>southern</b> Africa (South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Swaziland, and Lesotho) into two main bryofloristic elements: (1) the Xerophytic (south-western) element mainly {{distributed in the}} winter rainfall and semi-arid to arid, temperate areas of southern Africa, and (2) the Mesophytic (subtropical) element distributed in more stable, subtropical habitats of the northern, eastern and southern parts of southern Africa. The Xerophytic element is dominated by acrocarpous mosses, including the ephemerals, while the Mesophytic element contains most of the pleurocarpous mosses. The main Xerophytic element is subdivided into the Eastern Highlands and Cape Elements while the Mesophytic element consists of the Afromontane Grassland and Afromontane Forest Elements. The Afromontane Forest Element is the largest bryofloristic element and contains the most <b>southern</b> African <b>moss</b> endemics. The four bryofloristic elements are subdivided into eight subelements: the Eastern Highlands Element into the Mont Aux Sources and Widespread Subelements, the Cape Element into the West Coast and Boland Subelements, the Afromontane Grassland Element into the Disjunct Cape Peninsula and Drakensberg Subelements, and the Afromontane Forest Element into the Widespread Afromontane and Tropical Afromontane Subelements.

25|$|Experimental warming {{has been}} shown to start {{flowering}} substantially earlier than control cushions experiencing ambient temperature. Both the male and female phases developed faster in the OTCs and capsules (fruits) matured earlier, and the cushions produced more mature seeds and had a higher seed/ovule ratio contributing to an overall positive reproductive response. However, a study on four populations across a latitudinal gradient in North America showed that <b>southern</b> populations of <b>moss</b> campion had lower survival and recruitment, but higher individual growth rates than more northern populations. Furthermore, vital rates such as growth, survival, and fruits per area were shown to increase in moderately warmer years yet declined in the very warmest years, suggesting that a change in climate into warmer conditions or more frequent unusually warm summers may eventually lead to negative impacts. Another study showed that while the short term responses were positive, they turned negative on medium-term, suggestion that moss campion may be at risk in future global warming.|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{integral}} role that caves and rockshelters have traditionally played in archaeological inquiry throughout North America, they {{have largely been}} neglected as a focus of study and recorded examples have been poorly integrated into regional discourse in the Upper Great Lakes region. Most rockshelters in the Upper Great Lakes region formed as sea caves during higher lake level stages and became increasingly terrestrial as lake levels receded, resulting in an abundance of rockshelters and other shoreline features that are now inland from the current shoreline, very few {{of which have been}} subjected to archaeological investigation. To address this disparity, archaeological testing of selected locations on Grand Island was conducted {{under the direction of the}} Grand Island Archaeological Program in June and July 2015 in an attempt to assess the research potential of these features. This field work successfully identified two Woodland period rockshelter sites located on Grand Island 2 ̆ 7 s <b>southern</b> shore, <b>Moss</b> Cave (FS 09 - 10 - 03 - 1076) and Miner 2 ̆ 7 s Pit Cave (FS 09 - 10 - 03 - 1077). These sites are interpreted using a multiscalar approach that articulates site-level patterns with other sources of information to draw comparisons from contemporaneous sites on Grand Island and similar rockshelter sites in the Upper Great Lakes region. Informed by a theoretical framework that seeks to accommodate the multiplicity and complexity of hunter-gatherer relationships with the landscape, and supported by ethnohistorical accounts, this research seeks to widen the interpretive potential of rockshelters in the Upper Great Lakes by arguing that these rockshelters were likely considered ceremonial spaces that provided a space to communicate with other-than-human entities, or the manitous...|$|R
40|$|Ectohydric mosses {{are known}} {{accumulators}} of atmospheric heavy metals. Reliable bioindication of atmospheric heavy metals in the <b>Southern</b> Appalachians using <b>moss</b> {{has been limited}} by poor species distribution in moss used in analogous studies. In this study, Pb, Cu, Cr, and Ni concentrations were quantified in the tissue of fern moss Thuidium delicatulum in the central Blue Ridge of Virginia. The objectives {{of the study were}} to evaluate the suitability of fern moss for moss-monitoring studies in the Southern Appalachians, to compare local terrestrial metal concentrations, and to test the effects of several geographical and environmental variables on deposition. Fern moss was sampled over four mountains in Virginia following the standard protocol of the German moss-monitoring method. Sampling was standardized for monitoring in deciduous forests, and analysis was performed by graphite furnace-atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Overall concentrations of two metals were significantly different depending on the presence of Pinus spp. in the canopy. Positive and negative correlations of heavy metal concentrations with elevation were also observed, suggesting a need for comprehensive sampling at high and low elevations in mountainous areas. A role for similar moss-monitoring is suggested as a complement to current precipitation analysis techniques and as a compendium for landscape-scale metal monitoring projects. The applications of heavy metal bioindication with this particular species throughout the physiographic province of the Blue Ridge an...|$|R
40|$|Black carbon (BC) in the {{atmosphere}} contributes to the human health effects of particulate matter and contributes to radiative forcing of climate. The lifetime of BC, particularly the smaller particle sizes (PM 2. 5) which can be transported over long distances, is therefore {{an important factor in}} determining the range of such effects, and the spatial footprint of emission controls. Theory and models suggest that the typical lifetime of BC is around one week. The frequency distributions of measurements of a range of hydrocarbons at a remote rural site in <b>southern</b> Scotland (Auchencorth <b>Moss)</b> between 2007 and 2010 have been used to quantify the relationship between atmospheric lifetime and the geometric standard deviation of observed concentration. The analysis relies on an assumed common major emission source for hydrocarbons and BC, namely diesel-engined vehicles. The logarithm of the standard deviation of the log-transformed concentration data is linearly related to hydrocarbon lifetime, and the same statistic for BC can be used to assess the lifetime of BC relative to the hydrocarbons. Annual average data show BC lifetimes in the range 4 – 12 days, for an assumed OH concentration of 7 × 105 cm− 3. At this site there is little difference in BC lifetime between winter and summer, despite a 3 -fold difference in relative hydrocarbon lifetimes. This observation confirms the role of wet deposition as an important removal process for BC, as there is no difference in precipitation between winter and summer at this site. BC lifetime was significantly greater in 2010, which had 23...|$|R
40|$|Continuous {{monitoring}} {{of rain and}} cloud water amount and composition has been conducted at Holme <b>Moss</b> (<b>southern</b> Pennines) since 1994. •	Year-to-year variation in rain and cloud amount has been large, but with no temporal trend. •	Wind speed at Holme Moss has increased over the period, especially from the prevailing SW wind direction. The effect on transporting pollutants to the site is not known. •	Concentrations of non-marine sulphate in rain and cloud have decreased significantly over the period, consistent with the large decrease in UK emissions of sulphur dioxide. Concentrations of nitrate in rain and cloud have decreased slightly, not matching changes in NOx emissions in the UK, as noted for other sites in the UK rainfall network. Ammonium concentrations show no significant temporal trend. There is no temporal trend in sea-salt concentrations. •	Deposition of ions follows similar temporal trends to concentrations. •	There were no temporal trends in the ratio of cloud to rain water concentrations of ions at Holme Moss, nor in the ‘scavenging factor’ used to calculate seeder-feeder enhancement of deposition. •	The average scavenging factor for sea-salts of 3. 6 was higher than the default value of 2 used across the whole UK for modelling seeder-feeder enhancement of all ions. Average scavenging factors for other ions were all less than 2. •	Scavenging factors of 2 or less {{are related to the}} presence of gas-phase components of sulphate, nitrate and ammonium which are not included in the seeder-feeder model, and/or to local sources that affect only one of a pair of monitoring sites. •	Uncertainties {{in the use of the}} seeder-feeder model are shown to be within the year-to-year variability for modelled total deposition across the UK as a whole. Uncertainties in Critical Load exceedance are also small for a Critical Load of deposited nitrogen of 10 kg ha- 1 y- 1 which is typical of many upland areas, but could be large for areas with higher Critical Loads if they occurred in areas where seeder-feeder enhancement is an important component of total deposition. •	The results point to deficiencies in our knowledge of the spatial variation of the scavenging factor for different ions across the UK, and in the variation of trace gas concentrations with elevation. •	Options are provided for the extension, continuation or cessation of this monitoring work, with the associated pros, cons and approximate cost implications. •	Recommendations include: stopping cloud water monitoring, {{monitoring of}} additional paired high- and low-elevation sites for rainfall composition, and installation of (conditional) trace gas and particle integrating samplers at paired high- and low-elevation sites for a restricted period. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of fluvial dissection in upland blanket peat erosion is well-established but {{knowledge of the}} significance of peatland gully system development is limited. This thesis investigates the stability of upland blanket peat in relation to recent re-vegetation and historical erosion of peatland gully systems. It combines regional morphological surveys in a GIS framework with detailed field and laboratory analyses. Detailed research was carried out at three study areas across Northern England: The Cheviot (Northumberland), Moor House (North Pennines) and Wessenden Head <b>Moss</b> (<b>Southern</b> Pennines). A regional-scale investigation into gully development at the three sites demonstrated that the end members (Type 1 and Type 2 dissection) in Bower's 1960 classification of dissection types could be identified but a revised dissection classification including a third category of anastomosing dissection was needed. Regional variations in erosion and gully form were observed. The most extensive aerial erosion was on The Cheviot (80 %) and least at Moor House (48 %). Re-vegetation was most well-established at Moor House (80 % of the eroded peat) and least on Wessenden Head Moss (45 % of the eroded peat). The local topography of each site was the key in explaining erosion patterns. Linear dissection dominated on steeply sloping ground and anastomosing dissection on gentle sloping summit areas. Dendritic dissection occurred on intermediate slopes. Approximate slope angles for the dentritic transitional zone vary in relation to the local topography; however, the means for the three study sites are 3. 7 (Moor House), 4. 9 (The Cheviot) and 1. 4 (Wessenden Head Moss). Local-scale variations in erosion were observed on the interfluves and within existing gully systems. On the interfluves peat accumulation rates were estimated from Spheroidal Carbonaceous Particle deposition. Average rates were 0. 5 mm yr(- 1) under moorland grass and 1. 2 mm yr(- 1) under heather. Erosion potential of these sites was estimated from rainfall simulation experiments. The potential for erosion was high (243 t km(- 2), 0. 243 mm yr(- 1)), though not atypical of local directly measured erosion rates. However, experimental results showed that sediment production rarely occurred below a rainfall intensity of 12 mm hr(- 1) (high intensity for the Pennines) and with a presence of an intact vegetation cover sediment is only locally entrained and re-deposited and actual erosion under current climatic conditions is likely to be low. The onset of peat erosion was estimated by comparing eroded and uneroded cores. It is thought the most recent phase of erosion resulted from climatic change and land management and occurred some 570 years ago on Wessenden Head Moss and between 300 - 330 years ago at Moor House and on The Cheviot. Over the last approximate 50 - years, infilling and re-vegetation of the bases of gully systems has been observed. The peat within the gully stratigraphy appears to be eroded, re-deposited or grown in situ. The future of upland blanket peat will likely involve further stabilisation of the gully systems; however, in severely eroded areas where the peat is totally stripped and surface hydrological regime destroyed, the peat will not recover.
