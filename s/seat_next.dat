5|$|Following {{the return}} of the Reactionary Party to the government, Honório Hermeto was {{appointed}} by PedroII to the prestigious Council of State. Under advice from the Council of State, PedroII in May 1842 dissolved the new Chamber of Deputies, elected in the fraudulent 1840 elections, before it could be convened. Instead of attempting to get reelected, Honório Hermeto ran for a Senate seat, and being among the three candidates with the most votes, in late 1842 he was selected by the Emperor as the senator representing Minas Gerais. On 2 January 1843, he took his <b>seat</b> <b>next</b> to his rival, Aureliano Coutinho, who had been elected senator for the province of Alagoas. Having already secured two lifetime positions (councillor and senator), on 4 October 1841 Honório Hermeto received an appointment as president (governor) of the province of Rio de Janeiro, and assumed this office on 1 December.|$|E

25|$|It is said by {{some that}} Zia-Junejo rift was {{encouraged}} by late Mahboob-ul-Haq and Junejo's insistence on signing Geneva pact without deciding the composition of next government of Afghanistan before Soviet withdrawal. Junejo also gave Benazir a <b>seat</b> <b>next</b> to him in parleys before that. Junejo did not strengthen the Islamization drive and rather weakened it. His era led to serious disturbances in Karachi and ultimately Karachi went into the secular control of MQM from the clutches of Sunnis Jamaat-e-Islami.|$|E
25|$|Election to the United States House of Representatives came in 1888 {{when he won}} {{the race}} to {{represent}} Wisconsin's 9th congressional district. His service in the Congress was largely undistinguished but the friends he made there were influential to his future career. Chief among his new friends was William McKinley who was assigned to the <b>seat</b> <b>next</b> to McCord. Attempts by McCord to win reelection in 1890 and 1892 were unsuccessful. During this time period, McCord experienced a serious financial set back that resulted in him declaring bankruptcy.|$|E
25|$|The Newark Light Rail {{system uses}} a new-model vehicle built by Kinki Sharyo of Japan. This vehicle, {{the same one}} used by the HBLR system, is a double-articulated vehicle with three {{sections}}. Each of the two end sections has an operator's cab at the far end, thus {{eliminating the need for}} the vehicle to turn itself around physically in order to reverse direction. Each end section also has seating for 16 passengers on an upper level, and seating for 13 passengers on the lower level, including one special fold-down <b>seat</b> <b>next</b> to an empty space that a passenger using a wheelchair may use. With these two sections, and a middle section that seats ten passengers (five on each side), the vehicle can comfortably accommodate 68 seated passengers and two wheelchairs. An additional 122 passengers could stand in the vehicle, if necessary. Vehicles can be coupled into two-unit sets. A contract to expand 10 of the 20 LRVs assigned to the Newark Light Rail system for the purpose of increasing passenger capacity was approved on July 9, 2014.|$|E

25|$|On September 17, 1948, Bernadotte came to Jerusalem in a {{car with}} General Åge Lundström on his way to meet Israeli {{official}} Dov Yosef, who was then the military governor of the Israeli-controlled portion of Jerusalem's New City. Bernadotte's car was stopped by an Israeli Army Jeep at a roadblock in the Katamon neighborhood. Cohen ran from the Jeep pointed a gun inside the car and shot at Bernadotte and the others {{in the back seat of}} the car at point-blank range, riddling him with bullets. Bernadotte had been hit six times, killing him almost instantaneously. The car was driven at full speed to Hadassah Hospital on Mount Scopus, but doctors there were unable to do anything for Bernadotte, who was bleeding profusely from his wounds. French Army Colonel André Serot, who had been sitting in the back <b>seat</b> <b>next</b> to Bernadotte, was also killed. The tires of the other vehicles in Bernadotte's convoy had been shot out, and the hit team fled to Shaarei Pina, where they were hidden by haredi supporters of Lehi, before moving on to Tel Aviv in a furniture truck.|$|E

At the Southern Conference on Human Welfare in 1938, held in Birmingham, Alabama, Eleanor Roosevelt {{requested}} a <b>seat</b> <b>next</b> to Bethune despite state segregation laws. Roosevelt frequently referred to Bethune as [...] "her closest friend in her age group." [...] Bethune told black voters about the work being done on their behalf by the Roosevelt Administration, and made their concerns known to the Roosevelts. She had unprecedented access to the White House through her relationship with the First Lady.|$|E

[...] Regular broadcasts began in 1936 by A. K. ′′Rosey′′ Rowswell, a local humorist and friend of owner Bill Benswanger. [...] Rowswell is quoted as describing his broadcasting with, [...] "It's not just play-by-play that matters. [...] It's what you say in between the pitches that counts." [...] His style influenced junior partner Bob Prince, who began broadcasting in 1948. Rowswell broadcast games at Forbes Field until his death in 1955.|$|E

500|$|Initially, {{the chief}} villain, Hugo Drax, {{was to be}} played by British actor James Mason, but once the {{decision}} was made that the film would be an Anglo-French co-production under the 1965–79 film treaty, French actor Michael Lonsdale was cast as Drax and Corinne Cléry was chosen for the part of Corinne Dufour, to comply with qualifying criteria of the agreement. Stewart Granger [...] and Louis Jourdan was considered also for the role of Drax. [...] Jourdan later portrayed prince Kamal Khan, chief villain of Octopussy. American actress Lois Chiles had originally been offered the role of Anya Amasova in The Spy Who Loved Me (1977), but had turned down the part when she decided to take temporary retirement. Chiles was cast as Holly Goodhead by chance, when she was given the <b>seat</b> <b>next</b> to Lewis Gilbert on a flight and he believed she would be ideal for the role as the CIA scientist.|$|E
500|$|Casablanca Records {{commissioned}} a music video {{to be directed}} by Jake Nava, who previously worked {{in the same year}} with Britney Spears on her music video for [...] "My Prerogative" [...] (2004). The music video for [...] "Rumors" [...] premiered on October 14, 2004 and October 20, 2004 through Disney Channel and MTV. In the beginning of the video, Lohan is followed by paparazzi as she is entering her car. It is revealed that this is a Lindsay-look-alike, and that the real Lohan is entering another car to go to a club. The car comes to a stop, and she then steps into an elevator and sings the first verse of the song, while she is filmed by a CCTV camera in the elevator. The next sequence shows her running through a hallway, dressed up, before getting into the club. There, she dances in the crowd, where she takes a picture of one of the paparazzi herself to get back at him. In the next sequence, she is walking slowly through the club where she finds the man who seems to be her boyfriend. She takes a <b>seat</b> <b>next</b> to her lover and they begin kissing and touching each other, all the while being constantly filmed by cameras in the club. While Lohan sings the second chorus, she is trapped in a cage {{in the middle of the}} club and the whole crowd is watching her. After this Lohan is shown dancing in the club with her friends. At the end of the music video Lohan and her friends enter the top of a high-rise and perform a dance routine while helicopters are circling around them. Finally Lohan gets into a helicopter and escapes. In the end, she throws her camera away with all the pictures taken of her.|$|E
500|$|In June 1941, LeHand {{collapsed}} at a White House {{dinner party}} {{and two weeks}} later suffered a major stroke that left her partially paralyzed with little speech function. Goodwin says a factor that {{may have led to}} her illness was stress stemming from fears that the exiled Princess Märtha of Sweden, a Washington-area resident during World War II, had replaced her as FDR's favorite companion, occupying the <b>seat</b> <b>next</b> to him that had long been LeHand's in automobile rides. Kathryn Smith cites the stress of the world crisis that spring, as Britain stood alone against the Nazis, and the ill health of FDR, who had expected her to be at his bedside for weeks on end. [...] She had also become critical of FDR's leadership {{for the first time that}} spring, sharing her disappointment with Interior Secretary Harold L. Ickes, a close friend. FDR paid LeHand's medical bills and later made provisions for her in his will, stating that half the income of his estate would go to Eleanor and half to [...] "my friend Marguerite A. LeHand...for medical attention, care and treatment during her lifetime." [...] He also sent her to Warm Springs, where he hoped she could recover with the help of the physical therapy staff there. She was very unhappy in Warm Springs and may have tried to kill herself by eating chicken bones during the 1941 Christmas season. In early 1942, she spent some weeks in her old room at the White House, but quickly deteriorated due to her frustrations at not being able to help. After an incident in which she set the bed on fire—probably while smoking—it was agreed that LeHand would return to her sister's home in Somerville, Massachusetts, and she departed from Washington on May 15, 1942.|$|E

2500|$|Liz is {{generally}} portrayed {{as something of}} a [...] "geek". So, while she is an apparently skilled writer, she seems to have very few social skills (in [...] "Rosemary's Baby", Jack describes her as [...] "socially retarded"). For example, while she was trying to pick up men at a karaoke bar, a man asked her if the <b>seat</b> <b>next</b> to her was taken, leading her to ask him why she should have to move her coat just so he could sit there. Liz is often shown to be generally insecure and holds a strong concern for how she is perceived by others. Liz is sometimes dismissive of others, a personality flaw that can be connected to her lack of social skills. Assessing Liz's personality up to near the end of season 3, Jonah Weinerslav described her as [...] "an eternal 13-year-old tomboy—scared of sex, obsessed with Star Wars and meatball subs" [...] and as [...] "cling to a fantasy of presexual, junk-food-munching adolescence".|$|E

In the letter, a Muslim woman asked if taxi companies allowed uncaged pets to be transported in taxis, as she had seen a dog standing on a taxi <b>seat</b> <b>next</b> to its owner. She said that [...] "dogs may drool on the seats or dirty them with their paws". Her concerns had a religious basis as, according to Ustaz Ali Haji Mohamed, chairman of Khadijah Mosque: [...] "There are various Islamic schools of thought which differ in views. But most Muslims in Singapore are from the Shafi'i school of thought. This means they are not allowed to touch dogs which are wet, which would include a dog's saliva. This is a religious requirement." [...] In the judgment entitled Public Prosecutor v. Koh Song Huat Benjamin, Senior District Judge Magnus sentenced Koh to one month's imprisonment as he found the statements Koh made to have been [...] "particularly vile"– among other things, Koh had placed the halal logo of the Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura (Islamic Religious Council of Singapore) next to a picture of a pig's head, mocked Muslim customs and beliefs, and compared Islam to Satanism. As Lim's statements were not as serious, he was sentenced to one day in jail and the maximum fine of $5,000.|$|E
