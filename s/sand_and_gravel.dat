5|$|The geology of {{the borough}} is unremarkable; the bedrock is mainly {{composed}} of sand with patches of clay {{to the east}} and west, and superficial deposits (drift) of <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> <b>gravel</b> cover the entire area. The extraction of <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> <b>gravel</b> for construction purposes is carried out in the borough and the opening of more sites is planned.|$|E
5|$|Near its mouth, the {{surficial}} geology in {{the vicinity}} of Nanticoke Creek mainly consists of alluvium (which mainly consists of stratified silt, <b>sand,</b> <b>and</b> <b>gravel,</b> with some boulders), Wisconsinan Outwash (which contains stratified <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> <b>gravel),</b> and urban land (which is highly disrupted by cut and fill). Further upstream, the surficial geology mainly consists of coal dumps and surface mining land (both of which are rich in rick waste), as well as a glacial or resedimented till known as Wisconsinan Till, and bedrock consisting of sandstone and shale. The upper reaches of the creek mainly are around surficial geology consisting of surface mining land, bedrock, and Wisconsinan Till.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the Green Line near Berwyn Heights, Maryland {{resulted}} {{in the creation of}} Lake Artemesia. In 1976, WMATA removed <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> <b>gravel</b> needed for construction from open space adjacent to the Green Line. In exchange, WMATA paid to develop the area as a lake surrounded by a park.|$|E
50|$|Also common are {{patches of}} locally derived {{materials}} such as clay-with-flints and head, the latter including clays, <b>sands</b> <b>and</b> <b>gravels</b> which in the dry valleys of the Downs have a chalky and flinty composition. Along the coastal zone, wind-blown deposits of brick earth, mostly silt, are widespread as are <b>sands</b> <b>and</b> <b>gravels</b> whose age <b>and</b> origin are uncertain.|$|R

5|$|The {{reserve is}} also the {{headquarters}} of the Warwickshire Wildlife Trust. Formerly used for <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> <b>gravel</b> quarrying, the 92 hectare (228 acre) site is owned by French industrial company LaFarge Industries and is leased to the Trust.|$|E
5|$|The rocks {{exposed in}} the park were formed in the Devonian and Carboniferous periods between 370and 340million years ago, when the land {{was part of the}} {{coastline}} of a shallow sea that covered a great portion of what is now North America. The high mountains to the east of the sea gradually eroded, causing a build-up of sediment made up primarily of clay, <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> <b>gravel.</b>|$|E
50|$|Trinidad Head is {{composed}} of metamorphosed gabbro embedded in the surrounding Franciscan melange, topped with Pleistocene <b>sands</b> <b>and</b> <b>gravels.</b>|$|R
50|$|Soils of the {{immediate}} streambed and its vicinity are classified as the riverwash series, recent deposition of <b>sands</b> <b>and</b> <b>gravels.</b>|$|R
25|$|Deposits of glacial <b>and</b> fluvial <b>sands</b> <b>and</b> <b>gravels</b> {{have been}} <b>and</b> {{continue}} to be worked in numerous areas, principally for the construction industry.|$|R
5|$|Generally {{the bedrock}} of {{the west of the}} town {{consists}} of coal measures, which were exploited by the coal mining industry, while the east is mainly millstone grit. Overlying the bedrock are deposits of glacial <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> <b>gravel,</b> clay, and some alluvial deposits. Ashton Moss, a peat bog, lies {{to the west of the}} town and was originally much larger. The River Tame forms part of the southern boundary, dividing the town from Stalybridge and Dukinfield, and the River Medlock runs to the west.|$|E
5|$|In {{its lower}} reaches, the {{surficial}} geology {{in the vicinity}} of Shickshinny Creek consists of urban land highly disrupted by cut and fill, alluvium, alluvial terrace, fill, Wisconsinan Ice-Contact Stratified Drift containing stratified <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> <b>gravel,</b> Wisconsinan Ice-Contact Delta containing <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> <b>gravel,</b> Wisconsinan Bouldery Till (a glaicial or resedimented till containing boulders, and bedrock consisting of sandstone and shale. The bedrock mainly occurs on the mountains {{in this part of the}} watershed. In the middle reaches of the creek, the surficial geology mainly features bedrock consisting of sandstone and shale, alluvium, and a glacial or resedimented till known as Wisconsinan Till. Some Wisconsinan Outwash and alluvial terrace is also present near Koonsville. Some patches of Wisconsinan Bouldery Till and wetlands are also present. In its upper reaches, the creek is almost entirely dominated by Wisconsinan Till, bedrock, and some lakes. However, there is a patch of alluvial fan immediately north of Shickshinny Lake and some Wisconsinan Bouldery Till and Wisconsinan Outwash not far from the creek's source.|$|E
5|$|Meanders are sinuous bends in rivers {{or other}} channels, which form as a fluid, most often water, flows around bends. As {{soon as the}} path is {{slightly}} curved, the size and curvature of each loop increases as helical flow drags material like <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> <b>gravel</b> across the river {{to the inside of}} the bend. The outside of the loop is left clean and unprotected, so erosion accelerates, further increasing the meandering in a powerful positive feedback loop.|$|E
50|$|The area lies on Matangi soils, {{formed on}} the edge of the Komakorau Bog and the Waikato's {{alluvial}} plains of <b>sands</b> <b>and</b> <b>gravels.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{underlying}} geology of {{the forest}} area is mostly clay or <b>sands</b> <b>and</b> <b>gravels.</b> There are also peatland bogs {{to the south of}} Feckenham.|$|R
50|$|Softer sandy {{deposits}} {{occur within}} the Corallian, found for example at Faringdon, Shellingford and Hatford in Oxfordshire, where the <b>sands</b> <b>and</b> <b>gravels</b> are extensively quarried.|$|R
5|$|Presque Isle is a recurved, sand spit {{that formed}} {{during the last}} glacial period, or ice age, when the Laurentide Ice Sheet {{advanced}} into the basin now occupied by Lake Erie, and, when it retreated to the north between 12,370BC and 12,790BC, left behind a moraine consisting of clay, <b>sand,</b> <b>and</b> <b>gravel</b> that initially formed the Presque Isle peninsula. The deposits are constantly being re-worked by wave action and are gradually migrating to the northeast due to longshore drift.|$|E
5|$|Smythe is {{also known}} for having served in both World Wars, {{organizing}} his own artillery battery in the Second World War. The horses of Smythe's racing stable won the Queen's Plate twice among 145 stakes race wins during his lifetime. Smythe started and ran a successful <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> <b>gravel</b> business. He was a big supporter of the Ontario Society for Crippled Children and the Variety Club and founded the Conn Smythe Foundation philanthropic organization.|$|E
5|$|Smythe married Irene Sands on March 17, 1920, at Central Methodist Church. The couple {{lived in}} an {{apartment}} on St. Clair Avenue, then moved to the Runnymede area of Toronto {{to be close to}} Smythe's <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> <b>gravel</b> business, which operated a gravel pit north-west of Jane Street and St. Clair. (Smythe Park exists on the site today). In 1927, after their first two children, Stafford and Miriam, were born, they moved to the Baby Point enclave of Toronto, where they would live {{for the rest of their}} lives. Irene and Smythe had two other children, Hugh and Patricia. Hugh became a doctor; a specialist in rheumatology, and later a director of Maple Leaf Gardens. Patricia died due to an allergic attack at the age of ten, in 1945. Stafford became involved in the Smythe <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> <b>gravel</b> business and Maple Leaf Gardens before dying of complications from a bleeding ulcer in 1971. Stafford's son Thomas was a stick boy with the Maple Leafs and later was involved with the Toronto Marlboros and Doug Laurie Sporting Goods at Maple Leaf Gardens, before becoming director of the Smythe Charitable Foundation after Conn's death.|$|E
50|$|The {{formation}} of Kaitorete Barrier {{began at the}} end of the Last Glacial Maximum 20,000 years ago valley glaciers advanced in Canterbury and subsequent glacial outwash rivers delivered vast quantities of <b>sand,</b> <b>gravel</b> <b>and</b> silt to the coast. Sea level in Canterbury was 130 meters lower than the present day due to glaciation and the coast was as far as 50 km east of its present-day position, meaning the Canterbury plains were double their present width. Subsequent rapid sea-level rise then drowned what is now the continental shelf, causing rapid westward migration of the coast. 10,000 years ago the Canterbury coast was approaching the area presently occupied by Lake Ellesmere / Te Waihora. The coast consisted then, as it does now of the unconsolidated <b>sands</b> <b>and</b> <b>gravels</b> of the fans of major rivers in the area such as the Rakaia and Waimakariri. The Canterbury Bight was exposed to powerful southerly waves. The combination of weakly resistant unconsolidated <b>sands</b> <b>and</b> <b>gravels</b> <b>and</b> high energy wave action caused rapid coastal erosion and strong net northward transport of the resulting load of <b>sands</b> <b>and</b> <b>gravels</b> fed to the shore.|$|R
50|$|Garry Lakes {{are a part}} of the Churchill craton—Rae craton {{geological}} province. It is a low relief area including sedge/grass meadows along lake shores, and substrates of glacial silts, <b>sands,</b> <b>and</b> <b>gravels.</b>|$|R
50|$|Achnahannet Burn {{flows in}} the area; it is a {{tributary}} of the River Dulnain.The land westward from Achnahannet to Lynmore contains a belt of morainic <b>sands</b> <b>and</b> <b>gravels</b> between the River Dulnain terraces.|$|R
5|$|Texas {{leads the}} nation in the {{production}} of cattle, horses, sheep, goats, wool, mohair and hay. The state also {{leads the nation}} in production of cotton which is the number one crop grown in the state in terms of value. The state grows significant amounts of cereal crops and produce. Texas has a large commercial fishing industry. With mineral resources, Texas leads in creating cement, crushed stone, lime, salt, <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> <b>gravel.</b>|$|E
5|$|The area {{through which}} the Wheeldale {{structure}} runs is predominantly uncultivated heather moorland. Hayes believes its appearance has remained fundamentally unchanged since the Bronze Age when its forest cover was removed to permit cultivation and grazing. Wheeldale Moor is poorly drained in places making it susceptible to flooding in both the ancient and modern eras. The underlying geology consists of patches of <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> <b>gravel</b> on top of mixed sandstone and oolitic limestone, known as Ravenscar Group strata.|$|E
5|$|The land {{on which}} Worlds End State Park sits has {{undergone}} tremendous change over the last 350million years. It was once part of the coastline of a shallow sea that covered a great portion {{of what is now}} North America. The high mountains to the east of the sea gradually eroded, causing a buildup of sediment made up primarily of clay, <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> <b>gravel.</b> Tremendous pressure on the sediment caused the formation of the rocks that are found today in the Loyalsock Creek drainage basin: sandstone, shale, conglomerates, coal, and limestone.|$|E
50|$|Sediments {{carried in}} the bedload of a stream, mostly <b>sands</b> <b>and</b> <b>gravels,</b> are {{deposited}} in deltas that form {{at the edges of}} lakes. These deposits will only be found near the edges of the lake.|$|R
5000|$|Construction materials: {{dredging}} <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> <b>gravels</b> from offshore licensed {{areas for}} use in construction industry, principally {{for use in}} concrete. Very specialist industry focused in NW Europe using specialized trailing suction hopper dredgers self discharging dry cargo ashore.|$|R
50|$|Metamorphic rock of Cambrian age—mostly schist and phyllite—underlies the area. Quaternary {{glaciation}} left {{deposits of}} stony loam till plus outwash <b>sands</b> <b>and</b> <b>gravels.</b> Brown podzolic <b>and</b> podzol soils are most common. Gleysols and peats occur in poorly drained areas.|$|R

The high mountains to the east of the sea gradually eroded, causing a build-up of sediment made up primarily of clay, <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> <b>gravel.</b> Tremendous pressure on the sediment caused the formation of the rocks that are found {{in the park}} and in the Kitchen Creek drainage basin: sandstone, shale, siltstone, and conglomerates.|$|E
5|$|The {{village of}} Lymm lies {{to the south}} west of Warburton in the borough of Warrington, with the River Bollin forming {{the border between the}} two villages. The Bollin joins the River Mersey in the village; however the Mersey in Warburton has dried up, as it was {{diverted}} into the Manchester Ship Canal further upstream. To the east lie Dunham Town, Dunham Massey, Bowdon and Altrincham, with Little Bollington to the south, and Partington and Urmston to the north. The local geology is lower keuper marl, with a ridge of <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> <b>gravel</b> running from Warburton to Dunham.|$|E
5|$|During the {{following}} phase of work, {{four types of}} lake margin were constructed. On the southern side of the Central Basin, low reinforced concrete retaining walls were used, while on the eastern side, grouted rock wall can be seen near Commonwealth Park, as well {{as much of the}} East Basin. <b>Sand</b> <b>and</b> <b>gravel</b> beaches were built to cater for lakeside recreational pursuits. These are mostly prevalent on the western half of the lake complex. Rocky outcrops, steeply sloping stable shores with water vegetation such as bullrushes were also used. This treatment is evident in the West Lake in Yarralumla. William Holford and Partners were responsible for the foreshore landscaping, and over 55,000 trees were planted in accordance with a detailed scheme. Eucalypts were preferred so as to maintain the natural colour of the city landscape.|$|E
50|$|HSG Group A (low runoff potential): Soils {{with high}} {{infiltration}} rates even when thoroughly wetted. These consist chiefly of deep, well-drained <b>sands</b> <b>and</b> <b>gravels.</b> These soils {{have a high}} rate of water transmission (final infiltration rate greater than 0.3 in./h).|$|R
50|$|Kames are {{sometimes}} compared to drumlins, but their formation is distinctively different. A drumlin is not originally shaped by meltwater, {{but by the}} ice itself and has a quite regular shape. It occurs in fine-grained material, such as clay or shale, not in <b>sands</b> <b>and</b> <b>gravels.</b> <b>And</b> drumlins usually have concentric layers of material, as the ice successively plasters new layers in its movement.|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the parish}} lies on a {{relatively}} high plain which drains northwards to the River Stour and southwards to the River Colne. From the Stour the ground rises southwards to reach a height of more than 225 ft (70 m) in the south-west. A band of alluvium runs beside the Stour and there are river terrace deposits south of that, then, as the ground rises, bands of London clay, <b>and</b> <b>sands</b> <b>and</b> <b>gravels.</b> Most of the higher south part {{of the parish}} is boulder clay, good farming land, with a small pocket of <b>sands</b> <b>and</b> <b>gravels</b> running south-east from Wood Hall. Wormingford Mere of 12 acre is a natural feature formed by the Stour.|$|R
