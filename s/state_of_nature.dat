25|$|James L. Richardson {{identified}} five central {{themes in}} Locke's writing: individualism, consent, {{the concepts of}} the rule of law and government as trustee, the significance of property and religious toleration. Although Locke did not develop a theory of natural rights, he envisioned individuals in the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> as being free and equal. The individual, rather than the community or institutions, was the point of reference. Locke believed that individuals had given consent to government and therefore authority derived from the people rather than from above. This belief would influence later revolutionary movements.|$|E

The two principles of justice are the equal liberty principle and the principle which governs the distribution of social and economic inequalities. From this, Rawls argues for a system of distributive justice in accordance with the Difference Principle, which says that all social and economic inequalities must be to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged.|$|E
25|$|The {{philosophy}} of Cumberland is expounded in De legibus naturae. Its main design is {{to combat the}} principles which Hobbes had promulgated as to the constitution of man, the nature of morality, and the origin of society, and to prove that self-advantage is not the chief end of man, that force is not the source of personal obligation to moral conduct nor the foundation of social rights, and that the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> is not a state of war. The views of Hobbes seem to Cumberland utterly subversive of religion, morality and civil society. He endeavours, as a rule, to establish directly antagonistic propositions. He refrains, however, from denunciation, and is a fair opponent up to the measure of his insight.|$|E

The characteristic of the former is the elimination of that struggle, by the removal of the conditions which give rise to it. The tendency of the cosmic process is to bring about the adjustment of the forms of plant life to the current conditions; the tendency of the horticultural process is the adjustment of the conditions {{to the needs of the}} forms of plant life which the gardener desires to raise.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{social theory}} {{contains}} {{a tension between}} the realization of human freedom {{and the necessity of}} social rules. Liberal political theorists of the seventeenth century, such as Hobbes and Locke, saw the issue as one of sacrificing some individual freedoms in order to gain others. They understood social rules as enabling constraints—necessary impositions that limited activity in some spheres in order to expand it in others. (For example, traffic laws compel us to drive {{on one side of the}} road but allow us to travel more freely than if we were constantly assailed by oncoming traffic.) In the socio-political realm, these early liberal thinkers argued that we agree to surrender our freedom for political authority in order to gain greater freedom from a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature.</b> The sovereign authority is a constraint, but it allows freedom from the constraints that other individuals might impose upon us. In this way, rules are always seen as a means of increasing freedom rather than rescinding it.|$|E

2500|$|Spinoza, in his Tractatus theologico-politicus, {{tried to}} give Van den Enden's {{political}} ideas a foundation in his own philosophy, {{by pointing out that}} democracy is the best form of government [...] "approaching most closely to that freedom which nature grants to every man". Other than Thomas Hobbes, Spinoza posited that Man does not give up the rights he possesses in the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nature</b> to the State, when he enters the social contract. To him therefore leaving Man {{as close as possible to}} that <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nature</b> is important, and he thinks that democracy accomplishes this best, as it is [...] "the most natural" [...] and [...] "rational" [...] form of government. This theme runs through most Dutch republican doctrine of the 17th century, before resurfacing in the work of the mid-18th-century French republican philosophers, and ultimately in the French Revolution.|$|E

2500|$|Enlightenment {{philosophers}} {{are given}} credit for shaping liberal ideas. These ideas were first drawn together and systematized as a distinct ideology, by the English philosopher John Locke, generally regarded {{as the father of}} modern liberalism. Thomas Hobbes attempted to determine the purpose and the justification of governing authority in a post-civil war England. Employing the idea of a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> – a hypothetical war-like scenario prior to the State – he constructed the idea of a social contract that individuals enter into to guarantee their security and in so doing form the State, concluding that only an absolute sovereign would be fully able to sustain such a peace. Hobbes had developed the concept of the social contract, according to which, individuals in the anarchic and brutal <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> came together and voluntarily ceded some of their individual rights to an established state authority, which would create laws to regulate social interactions. Whereas Hobbes advocated a strong monarchical authority (the Leviathan), Locke developed the then radical notion that government acquires consent from the governed which has to be constantly present for the government to remain legitimate. John Locke, while adopting Hobbes's idea of a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> and social contract, nevertheless argued that when the monarch becomes a tyrant, that constituted a violation of the social contract, which bestows life, liberty and property as a natural right. He concluded that the {{people have a right to}} overthrow a tyrant. By placing life, liberty and property as the supreme value of law and authority, Locke formulated the basis of liberalism based on social contract theory. To these early enlightenment thinkers, securing the most essential amenities of life – liberty and private property among them – required the formation of a [...] "sovereign" [...] authority with universal jurisdiction.|$|E

[...] They clear away the native vegetation, extirpate or drive out the animal population, so far as may be necessary, and take measures to defend themselves from the re-immigration of either. In their place, they introduce English grain and fruit trees; English dogs, sheep, cattle, horses; and English men; in fact, they set up a new Flora and Fauna and a new variety of mankind, within the old <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature.</b> Their farms and pastures represent a garden on a great scale, and themselves the gardeners who have to keep it up, in watchful antagonism to the old regime.
