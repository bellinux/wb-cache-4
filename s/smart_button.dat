40|$|Abstract—Continuous {{advances}} in sensors, semiconductors, wireless networks, mobile and cloud computing enable {{the development of}} integrated wearable computing systems for continuous health monitoring. These systems {{can be used as}} a part of diagnostic procedures, in the optimal maintenance of chronic conditions, in the monitoring of adherence to treatment guidelines, and for supervised recovery. In this paper, we describe a wearable system called <b>Smart</b> <b>Button</b> designed to assess mobility of elderly. The <b>Smart</b> <b>Button</b> is easily mounted on the chest of an individual and currently quantifies the Timed-Up-and-Go and 30 -Second Chair Stand tests. These two tests are routinely used to assess mobility, balance, strength of the lower extremities, and fall risk of elderly and people with Parkinson’s disease. The paper describes the design of the <b>Smart</b> <b>Button,</b> parameters used to quantify the tests, signal processing used to extract the parameters, and integration of the <b>Smart</b> <b>Button</b> into a broader mHealth system. Keywords—mobile sensing; health monitoring; wearable devices; timed-up-and-go test; 30 -second chair stand test. I...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Services {{based on}} Internet of Things (IoT) {{technologies}} {{have emerged in}} various business environments. To enhance service quality at conventions and maximize the experience of attendees, this study developed a customer-driven smart and sustainable service, applying a <b>smart</b> <b>button</b> as an IoT technology. An application of the IoT technology-based <b>smart</b> <b>button</b> was adopted by comparing {{advantages and disadvantages of}} technologies. We also identified the need for customer-driven smart and sustainable service by analyzing cases. Then, we designed, constructed and evaluated the service with the action research framework, which includes phases such as diagnosis, action planning, action taking, evaluation, and specify learning. In the first phase, various challenges and problems of the smart convention were diagnosed through interviews with organizers. In the action planning phase, service models were designed to solve the problems. In the action taking phase, which IoT technology would be the most appropriate was discussed and it was applied to the convention space. In the evaluation phase, we derived the role of IoT technology for smart conventions and summarized the results of the smart convention service. Finally, we presented implications for a business...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a system for}} monitoring the safety of workers who are exposed to unhealthy environments. The system {{is based on a}} low-cost wireless network of <b>smart</b> wearable <b>buttons</b> that can be applied inside the protective suits and that embed the measurement device along with a 2. 4 GHz radio. The proposed solution is conceived to be employed with elements that use textile fibres as intrinsic sensors and with discrete sensors as well. The network allows both the measurement strategy and the program code of the wearable sensors to be remotely updated in order to adapt and optimize the power consumption. The real-time operability is also permitted by introducing proxy elements that allow the network area to be extended in a solution {{similar to that of the}} Zigbee but optimized for the required architecture. The system can be employed in a wide class of indoor medical applications; an example is provided that is intended to monitor temperature and humidity for workers inside refrigerated chamber...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSmart phone {{technology}} creates {{new opportunities}} for farm management applications in small farms. Farmers working on small farms are now able with a low cost smart phone and the specialized software (in our case FarmManager) to obtain facilities that couldn’t have on their hands before. The use of the FarmManager software in a smart phone can overleap the high difficulties of farm management requirements which were stand as obstacle for many years so far. Tasks such as field definition, task operations, lists and reports and all farming use data can be submitted and carried on together in a smart phone at any farm working condition. In this paper we present the FarmManager which is an Android smart phone application and how it creates the management base for recording and browsing of ground fields, field relations (occupied or rented land), cultivation and its tasks, equipment, employees and European cultivations reports {{and all of them}} to be performed by the touch of <b>smart</b> phone screen <b>button.</b> The use of software is currently freely available and there are more than one thousand farmers using it in Greece...|$|R
