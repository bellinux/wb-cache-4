40|$|Aim of {{the study}} : The aim {{of the study}} was to report on seven cases of BRONJ treated with {{surgical}} debridement, oral antibiotics and gentamicin-collagen sponge (Collatamp EG) placed in the bone wound. Material and methods : Seven patients with 9 sites of BRONJ stage 2 were included in the study. Perioperative oral antibiotics, surgical debridement and/or <b>sequestrotomy</b> and gentamicin-collagen sponge (Collatamp EG) were used. Postoperative monitoring was carried out for the next 3 months. Results : Three weeks after the surgery, six sites of BRONJ in five patients were treated successfully. In two patients on three sites BRONJ stage 1 was observed. Three months after surgery another two sites healed fully. In one patient there was still BRONJ stage 1, however, the area of exposed bone was visibly reduced. Conclusions : The use of surgical debridement together with oral antibiotic therapy and collagen-gentamycin sponge indicates positive results regarding the surgical treatment of BRONJ...|$|E
40|$|Background. Bisphosphonates are drugs which act on bone metabolism. They act on osteoclastic {{activity}} and inhibit neoangiogenesis. In the bisphosphonate class the most clinically used molecules are pamidronate and zolendronate. They represent “the gold standard” {{and are used}} in multiple myeloma treatment, solid tumors with bone metastases, and prevention of pathological fractures. In recent years it has been supposed that bisphosphonates may lead to jaws osteonecrosis, expecially after dentistry procedures such as dental extractions, implant surgery and periodontics interventions. Our work aim is to delineate clinical aspects of patients’ lesions come to our observation for jaws osteonecrosis. These belonged to a patients’ group treated by bisphosphonates for multiple myeloma, osteoporosis, hyperparathyroidism, Paget’s disease. Patients and methods. We examinated clinical data of 9 patients(8 females, 1 male), with jaws osteonecrotic lesions and treated by bisphosphonates, for a mean time of 42 months. Six of the 9 patients were treated for multiple myeloma. In 4 cases osteonecrotic were located on superior maxillary, in 5 ones on jaw. Clinically exposed bone area was infected, with radiated and burning pain, and antibiotic therapy was necessary. Results. Most clinically represented lesion was an area of ulcerated mucosa with not vital exposed bone. Flogosis was typical in area surrounding the necrosis. Neither bleeding nor pain could be appreciated in the exposed bone area. Painful lesions make more difficult oral hygiene, with frequent onset of local parodontosis. At radiographic exams typical illness marks are not corresponded instead. A standardized protocol for jaws osteonecrosis doesn’t exist. In our clinical trial we performed several clinical plans, with different results. The suspension of bisphosphonate therapy {{does not appear to}} hasten recovery of the osteonecrosis. Despite antibiotic therapy, resective surgery, osteoplastics and hyperbaric oxygen therapy most of the lesions did not respond well to therapy. Discussion. Although bisphosponates use started about 30 years ago, first osteonecrotic lesions were described in 2003 (Max and Stern). The pathogenesis is correlated to the modifications of vascularization induced from such drugs, but would compete even factors as masticatory stress, iatrogenic procedures, local bacterial position, association with other rugs and some systemic pathologies. Surgical treatment may lead to not predictable results and recurrences. Antibiotic therapy reduces the inflammation and the pain, but did not assure healing; therapies with disinfectant and irrigantes have not produced results; in our clinic the hyperbaric oxygen therapy has gotten good results toward in the comparisons of the inflammation and in the improvement of the course-operating after <b>sequestrotomy.</b> Conclusions. Bisphosphonates are essential drugs in the treatment of several diseases other than osteoporosis. But considering the impact on {{the quality of life of}} the patients on which rise up osteonecrosis of the maxillary, it is necessary to perform odontostomatologic visit before the therapy, and to evaluated the relationship between benefit of the treatment and the risk of such lesions...|$|E
