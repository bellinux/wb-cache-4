5|$|Aisles {{were added}} to the nave in the 14th century, first on the north side and then on the south, {{doubling}} the seating capacity. More windows were also installed in the nave. A century later, a timber porch was built on the north side, the chancel arch was widened and a rood screen was installed, a <b>standard</b> <b>feature</b> of churches in the medieval era, as were wall decorations and paintings. Ecclesiastical feeling moved in favour of austere, whitewashed walls, screens and pillars by the 17th century, and Parliament decreed these changes in the 1640s. The vicar of Ifield, Reverend Robert Goddin, was a strict Protestant who was strongly opposed to Catholic-style worship, ceremony and church decoration, and he enforced the new style rigorously. The rood screen and all internal decoration were removed at this time.|$|E
5|$|Attempting {{to combine}} his two main product lines, cars and stereos, Muntz invented the Muntz Stereo-Pak 4-track tape cartridge. 4-track was the direct {{predecessor}} of the Stereo 8 cartridge, {{also known as}} the 8-track, later developed by American inventor Bill Lear. The Stereo-Pak cartridge was based on the endless-loop Fidelipac cartridge, which was being used by radio stations, designed by inventor George Eash. Muntz chose stereo recording as a <b>standard</b> <b>feature</b> because of its wide availability. Before Muntz developed the Stereo-Pak, the only in-car units capable of recorded playback were phonograph-based players, such as the Highway Hi-Fi invented by Peter Goldmark. These units played special 16 rpm records or 45 rpm records, however they tended to skip whenever the vehicle hit a bump in the road, and attempts to alleviate this by increasing the pressure on the arm caused discs to wear out prematurely.|$|E

25|$|Automatic {{volume control}} or {{automatic}} gain control (AGC) is an adaptive system found in many electronic devices.

25|$|Charro Westerns, often {{featuring}} musical {{stars as}} well as action, have been a <b>standard</b> <b>feature</b> of Mexican cinema since the 1930s. In the 1930s and 1940s, these were typically films about horsemen in rural Mexican society, displaying a set of cultural concerns {{very different from the}} Hollywood meta-narrative, but the overlap between 'charro' movies and westerns became more apparent in the 1950s and 1960s.|$|E
25|$|Isis had {{a central}} role in Egyptian magic spells and ritual, {{especially}} those of protection and healing. In many spells her powers are merged with those of her son Horus. His power accompanies hers whenever she is invoked. In Egyptian history the image of a wounded Horus became a <b>standard</b> <b>feature</b> of Isis's healing spells, which typically invoked the curative powers of Isis' milk.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, the National Captioning Institute {{noted that}} English {{as a foreign}} or second {{language}} (ESL) learners were the largest group buying decoders in the late 1980s and early 1990s before built-in decoders became a <b>standard</b> <b>feature</b> of US television sets. This suggested that the largest audience of closed captioning was people whose native language was not English. In the United Kingdom, of 7.5 million people using TV subtitles (closed captioning), 6 million have no hearing impairment.|$|E
25|$|Their {{weapons were}} spears, swords, longbow (on the coins of Agathokleia) and arrows. Interestingly, around 130 BC, the Central Asian recurve {{bow of the}} steppes with its gorytos box started to appear {{for the first time}} on the coins of Zoilos I, {{suggesting}} strong interactions (and apparently an alliance) with nomadic peoples, either the Yuezhi or the Scythians. The recurve bow becomes a <b>standard</b> <b>feature</b> of Indo-Greek horsemen by 90 BC, as seen on some of the coins of Hermaeus.|$|E
25|$|Galton was a polymath {{who made}} {{important}} contributions in many fields of science, including meteorology (the anti-cyclone {{and the first}} popular weather maps), statistics (regression and correlation), psychology (synaesthesia), biology (the nature and mechanism of heredity), and criminology (fingerprints). Much of this was influenced by his penchant for counting or measuring. Galton prepared the first weather map published in The Times (1 April 1875, showing the weather from the previous day, 31 March), now a <b>standard</b> <b>feature</b> in newspapers worldwide.|$|E

Acton was extremely influential because she was the first cookery book writer to list the ingredients needed in a recipe and to note how long a dish takes to cook - an innovation which has become a <b>standard</b> <b>feature</b> of modern recipes.|$|E
25|$|Contrary to what Heilmann believed, paleontologists now {{accept that}} clavicles {{and in most}} cases furculae are a <b>standard</b> <b>feature</b> not just of theropods but of saurischian dinosaurs. Up to late 2007 ossified furculae (i.e. made of bone rather than cartilage) have been found in all types of theropods except the most basal ones, Eoraptor and Herrerasaurus. The {{original}} report of a furcula in the primitive theropod Segisaurus (1936) was confirmed by a re-examination in 2005. Joined, furcula-like clavicles have also been found in Massospondylus, an Early Jurassic sauropodomorph.|$|E
25|$|The 1930s saw major {{advances}} in pinball design {{with the introduction}} of electrification. A company called Pacific Amusements in Los Angeles, USA produced a game called Contact in 1933. Contact had an electrically powered solenoid to propel the ball out of a bonus hole {{in the middle of the}} playfield. Another solenoid rang a bell to reward the player. The designer of Contact, Harry Williams, would eventually form his own company, Williams Manufacturing, in 1944. Other manufacturers quickly followed suit with similar features. Electric lights soon became a <b>standard</b> <b>feature</b> of all subsequent pinball games, designed to attract players.|$|E

For 1986, the Caravelle was given a facelift, which rounded many of the sharp angles, giving it a more aerodynamic appearance. Also from 1986 onward, a base model was offered, without some of the <b>standard</b> <b>features</b> of the [...] "SE". The Caravelle continued in the U.S. until 1988, when it was replaced by the new A body Acclaim for 1989. Unlike the identical Canadian Caravelle, a 2-door coupe model was never offered in the U.S.|$|R
