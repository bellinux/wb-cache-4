500|$|Sugarcane {{refers to}} any of several species, or their hybrids, of giant grasses in the genus Saccharum [...] in the family Poaceae. They have been {{cultivated}} in tropical climates in South Asia and Southeast Asia since ancient times for the sucrose that is found in their stems. A great expansion in sugarcane production {{took place in the}} 18th century with the establishment of slave plantations in the Americas. The use of slavery meant that {{this was the first time}} that sugar became cheap enough for most people, who previously had to rely on honey to sweeten foods. It requires a frost-free climate with sufficient rainfall during the growing season to make full use of the plant's great growth potential. The crop is harvested mechanically or by hand, chopped into lengths and conveyed rapidly to the processing plant (commonly known as a sugar mill). Here, it is either milled and the juice extracted with water or extracted by diffusion. The juice is then clarified with lime and heated to destroy enzymes. The resulting thin syrup is concentrated in a series of evaporators, after which further water is removed by evaporation in vacuum containers. The resulting <b>supersaturated</b> <b>solution</b> is seeded with sugar crystals and the sugar crystallizes out and is separated from the fluid and dried. Molasses is a by-product of the process and the fiber from the stems, known as bagasse, is burned to provide energy for the sugar extraction process. The crystals of raw sugar have a sticky brown coating and either can be used as they are or can be bleached by sulfur dioxide or can be treated in a carbonatation process to produce a whiter product. [...] About [...] of irrigation water is needed for every one kilogram of sugar produced.|$|E

Here, we present a method for observing rotational dynamic structures that can detect the interaction of nanoscale lysozyme protein networks via diffracted X-ray tracking (DXT). Our DXT analysis demonstrated that the rearrangement behaviours of lysozyme networks or clusters, which are driven by local density and concentration fluctuations, generate force fields on the femtonewton to attonewton (fN - aN) scale.

40|$|Formulation of poorly {{water-soluble}} {{drugs is}} a challenging problem encountered during the drug development process. To improve drug delivery, the amorphous {{form of a}} poorly water-soluble drug compound {{is often used to}} generate <b>supersaturated</b> <b>solutions.</b> The <b>supersaturated</b> <b>solutions</b> generated from the dissolution of amorphous solids may lead to an increase in absorption compared to that of a saturated solution if supersaturation can be maintained for a physiologically-relevant type period.. The phase behavior of <b>supersaturated</b> <b>solutions</b> is complex and poorly understood, with the formation of drug colloidal aggregates often being reported. Little is known about the mechanism by which colloidal aggregates are produced from <b>supersaturated</b> <b>solutions,</b> although {{it has been suggested that}} they are important to the bioavailability enhancement often seen with amorphous solid dispersions. However, in order to maintain supersaturation, crystallization must be prevented and so the presence of an effective crystallization inhibitor in solution is desirable to prolong supersaturation. Maintaining supersaturation by using polymeric additives depends on their ability to inhibit nucleation and crystal growth. Although the inhibition of crystallization from aqueous <b>supersaturated</b> <b>solutions</b> by polymeric additives has been extensively documented, there is very little mechanistic understanding of the underlying factors that affect the ability of polymeric additives to inhibit nucleation and crystal growth for a given drug compound. The insights into that mechanism of colloidal aggregate formation has important implications for understanding the phase behavior of amorphous solid dispersions upon dissolution as well as the delivery of compounds with low aqueous solubility. The elucidation of the key polymer properties important for crystallization inhibition of chemically and structurally different drug molecules will provide important insights about how polymers inhibit the crystallization of molecular crystals, and help to guide the development of new excipients with superior crystallization inhibitory properties. ...|$|R
40|$|Solid oral {{formulations}} such as {{amorphous solid}} dispersions that {{give rise to}} <b>supersaturated</b> <b>solutions</b> are collectively termed as enabling formulations. These formulations have had tremendous success in enhancing in vivo drug uptake and bioavailability of poorly soluble molecules. For a successful amorphous solid dispersion strategy it is important to address stability in the solid as well as the solution state. Amorphous solids tend to crystallize over time and although polymers have been used to impede precipitation from solution there is a gap in our mechanistic understanding of how polymers impact dissolution, stabilize <b>supersaturated</b> <b>solutions</b> and affect polymorphic transitions. There is a need to characterize solution-state crystallization tendency particularly in the presence of polymers and ascertain their impact on phase behavior of <b>supersaturated</b> <b>solutions.</b> Phase behavior of <b>supersaturated</b> <b>solutions</b> is extremely complex, poorly understood and plagued with numerous phase transitions viz. solid-liquid phase transitions such as crystallization and amorphous-amorphous phase precipitation and as our research efforts have recently uncovered, liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). LLPS is a novel phenomenon that occurs in highly <b>supersaturated</b> <b>solutions</b> once a certain threshold concentration is exceeded. According to data presented in the forthcoming pages, this threshold concentration corroborates to amorphous solubility and is a startling discovery. LLPS is known to occur in polymer blends, proteins and peptides, in industrial crystallization when recrystallizing small molecules from a mixture of aqueous and organic solvent and has even been documented as promiscuous aggregation on the pharmaceutical discovery end. However, this is the first such report of LLPS in a binary system comprising of drug and water. The focus of this thesis work is to understand the underlying theromdynamics of LLPS and its relationship with amorphous solubility and stabilizing such systems using pharmaceutical excipients such as polymers, lipids and surfactants. A consequence of this work is the development of ultraviolet (UV) and fluorescence spectroscopic techniques to detect LLPS onset as well as a simple diffusion cell approach to predict thermodynamic activity and passive drug uptake of LLPS systems in the absence and presence of additives. Understanding phase behavior of <b>supersaturated</b> <b>solutions</b> and the impact of excipients will enable us to exploit enabling formulation strategy, stabilize such systems against crystallization and drive drug exposure in vivo. ...|$|R

2500|$|A {{solubility}} equilibrium exists when {{a chemical}} compound in the solid state is in chemical equilibrium {{with a solution}} of that compound. The equilibrium {{is an example of}} dynamic equilibrium in that some individual molecules migrate between the solid and solution phases such that the rates of dissolution and precipitation are equal to one another. When equilibrium is established, the solution is said to be saturated. The concentration of the solute in a saturated solution is known as the solubility. Units of solubility may be molar (moldm−3) or expressed as mass per unit volume, such as μgml−1. Solubility is temperature dependent.

6000|$|Nothing of {{the sort}} is going to happen, or, at any rate, if it happens, it will happen as an interlude, as no {{necessary}} part in the general progress of the human drama. The world is no more to be recast by chance individuals than a city is to be lit by sky rockets. The purpose of things emerges upon spacious issues, and the day of individual leaders is past. The analogies and precedents that lead one to forecast the coming of military one-man-dominions, the coming of such other parodies of Cæsar's career as that misapplied, and speedily futile chess champion, Napoleon I. contrived, are false. They are false because they ignore two correlated things; first, the steady {{development of a new}} and quite unprecedented educated class as a necessary aspect of the expansion of science and mechanism, and secondly, the absolute revolution in the art of war that science and mechanism are bringing about. This latter consideration the next chapter will expand, but here, in the interests of this discussion, we may in general terms anticipate its gist. War in the past has been a thing entirely different in its nature from what war, with the apparatus of the future, will be--it has been showy, dramatic, emotional, and restricted; war in the future will be none of these things. War in the past was a thing of days and heroisms; battles and campaigns rested in the hand of the great commander, he stood out against the sky, picturesquely on horseback, visibly controlling it all. War in the future will be a question of preparation, of long years of foresight and disciplined imagination, there will be no decisive victory, but a vast diffusion of conflict--it will depend less and less on controlling personalities and driving emotions, and more and more upon the intelligence and personal quality of a great number of skilled men. All this the next chapter will expand. And either before or after, but, at any rate, in the shadow of war, it will become apparent, perhaps even suddenly, that the whole apparatus of power in the country {{is in the hands of}} a new class of intelligent and scientifically-educated men. They will probably, under the development of warlike stresses, be discovered--they will discover themselves--almost surprisingly with roads and railways, carts and cities, drains, food supply, electrical supply, and water supply, and with guns and such implements of destruction and intimidation as men scarcely dream of yet, gathered in their hands. And they will be discovered, too, with a growing common consciousness of themselves as distinguished from the grey confusion, a common purpose and implication that the fearless analysis of science is already bringing to light. They will find themselves with bloodshed and horrible disasters ahead, and the material apparatus of control entirely within their power. [...] "Suppose, after all," [...] they will say, [...] "we ignore these very eloquent and showy governing persons above, and this very confused and ineffectual multitude below. Suppose now we put on the brakes and try something a little more stable and orderly. These people in possession have, of course, all sorts of established rights and prescriptions; they have squared the law to their purpose, and the constitution does not know us; they can get at the judges, they can get at the newspapers, they can do all sorts of things except avoid a smash--but, for our part, we have these really most ingenious and subtle guns. Suppose instead of our turning them and our valuable selves in a fool's quarrel against the ingenious and subtle guns of other men akin to ourselves, we use them in the cause of the higher sanity, and clear that jabbering war tumult out of the streets."... There may be no dramatic moment for the expression of this idea, no moment when the new Cromwellism and the new Ironsides will come visibly face to face with talk and baubles, flags and patriotic dinner bells; but, with or without dramatic moments, the idea will be expressed and acted upon. It will be made quite evident then, what is now indeed only a pious opinion, namely, that wealth is, after all, no ultimate Power at all, but only an influence among aimless, police-guarded men. So long as there is peace the class of capable men may be mitigated and gagged and controlled, and the ostensible present order may flourish still in the hands of that other class of men which deals with the appearances of things. But as some <b>supersaturated</b> <b>solution</b> will crystallize out with the mere shaking of its beaker, so must the new order of men come into visibly organized existence through the concussions of war. The charlatans can escape everything except war, but to the cant and violence of nationality, to the sustaining force of international hostility, they are ruthlessly compelled to cling, and what is now their chief support must become at last their destruction. And so it is I infer that, whether violently as a revolution or quietly and slowly, this grey confusion that is Democracy must pass away inevitably by its own inherent conditions, as the twilight passes, as the embryonic confusion of the cocoon creature passes, into the higher stage, into the higher organism, the world-state of the coming years.|$|E
