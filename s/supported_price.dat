In addition, the California State Legislature would sometimes push Davis to act decisively by taking over power plants which were {{known to have been}} gamed and place them back under control of the utilities, ensuring a more steady supply and slapping the nose of the worst manipulators [...] Meanwhile, conservatives argued that Davis signed overpriced energy contracts, employed incompetent negotiators, and refused to allow prices to rise for residences statewide much like they did in San Diego, which they argue could have given Davis more leverage against the energy traders and encouraged more conservation. More criticism is given in the book Conspiracy of Fools, which gives the details of a meeting between the governor and his officials; Clinton Administration Treasury officials; and energy executives, including market manipulators such as Enron, where Gray Davis disagreed with the treasury officials and energy executives. They advised suspending environmental studies to build power plants and a small rate hike to prepare for long-term power contracts (Davis eventually signed overpriced ones, as noted above), while Davis <b>supported</b> <b>price</b> caps, denounced the other solutions as too politically risky, and allegedly acted rudely. The contracts Davis signed locked Californians into high electric costs for the next decade. As of October 2011 electric rates in California had yet to return to pre-contract levels.|$|E
40|$|Trade-based market manipulation, {{which is}} usually {{described}} as trading shares to initiate a price change or to cause an artificial price, has received wide attention in policy and academic discussions, although the behavior is still poorly defined in both legal and economic literature. This Article contributes {{to an understanding of}} manipulation by providing a precise definition. A differentiation is made between supported and unsupported price pressure. <b>Supported</b> <b>price</b> pressure contributes to price efficiency, while unsupported price pressure creates societal costs. Trade-based market manipulation, thus, should be defined as exercising unsupported price pressure. The analysis sheds light on the long-standing debate about the possibility of formulating an objective definition of manipulation, refuting the assertion that a mens rea element is necessary. Existing prohibitions should be interpreted in line with the 'unsupported price pressure' -standard, that is allow <b>supported</b> <b>price</b> pressure but bar unsupported price pressure...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is on models that {{accommodate}} dynamic phenomena and include consumer-focused and competitor-centered approaches. The consumer focus is represented in demand functions while the competitor orientation is captured in reaction functions. Although the extant literature has tended to restrict the competitive reactions to marketing decision variables, we also allow for feedback effects which model reactions to consequences of actions. These consequences may show both in own brand and in other brands' performance variables. We develop a VARX model with all relevant dynamic and interactive effects. Such a model is especially useful for situations in which causality, feedback and dynamic phenomena matter. Our model simultaneously includes all relevant individual brands, and we include lags that are brand-and variable-specific. We use Impulse Response Analysis to estimate the gross and net effects of marketing actions. To show how variables causally depend on each other, we use a Forecast Error Variance Decomposition. We apply the modeling process first to market-level tuna data, consistent with typical time series applications. Given a nonlinear model we use geometric averaging so as to avoid one source of aggregation bias. We apply the same modeling process then separately for each store so that we can also determine the heterogeneity in effects between stores. The variables of interest include two price promotion variables, one with support (feature and/or display), the other without. We find, as expected, that the nonsupported price elasticities are usually closer to zero than the <b>supported</b> <b>price</b> elasticities. Also, cumulative effects tend to be larger than the immediate effects, due to a tendency for some continuation of price discounting. Specifically, it appears that <b>supported</b> <b>price</b> cuts are often followed by non-supported price cuts. The Forecast Error Variance Decomposition results show that the variance of a <b>supported</b> <b>price</b> variable is explained largely by its own shocks, while a non-supported price variable's variance depends primarily on the same brand's <b>supported</b> <b>price</b> variable. The results based on store data show more evidence of dynamic effects than the market data do. Nevertheless, the average effects show somewhat similar magnitudes between the market and store-data. Importantly, there is a large amount of store heterogeneity in the effects. Thus, it appears that managers should consider the benefits from store-specific management of promotions relative to the costs. ...|$|E

40|$|THIS paper {{explores the}} attitudes of the {{business}} community toward wage and price controls in the World War II. While it is obvious that business would support restrictions on wages, the paradox is that during the war the business community overwhelmingly <b>supported</b> <b>price</b> controls as well? Indeed, businessupported controls before they were imposed, during the war itself, and to some extent in the immediate postwar period, when the question was how long the controls should be continued. If anyone supports capitalism, one might argue, it would be the capitalists. And since economic theory teaches us that the price system is essential to the etficient operation of capitalism, we would expect business to strongly oppose a complete system of wage, price, and production controls. Given this conventional wisdom, the fact that business not only gave vocal support to controls, but also provided {{a large part of the}} manpower to implement and enforce them, demands documentation and explanation. Support for controls was not, of course, unqualified or universal...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{includes}} {{the concepts of}} land rent {{from the standpoint of}} modern economics and accounts for the contributing factors {{in the formation of the}} agricultural land price during the pre-war and the post-war periods. It can be said the agricultural land price in the later Taisho period was conditioned by farm rent and as far as the pure farming region is concerned, the agricultural land price in the post-war period is also explained considerably by net returns per 10 ares of land, which is capitalized by an 8 percent interest rate. Furthermore, the increase in agricultural land price, based on the premises of constant return to scale and the <b>supported</b> <b>price</b> of farm products, has demonstrated that the rise in the agricultural land price is sufficiently explained by technological progress in rice production. Though various factors are considered important in the contribution to the formation of the agricultural land price in this paper the main emphasis is based upon the fact that the interior factors of agriculture considerably elucidate its formation throughout the pre-war and the post-war period. This is especially applicable to the agricultural land price in pure farming regions...|$|E

40|$|Sales {{promotions}} generate substantial short-term sales increases. To {{determine whether}} the sales promotion bump is truly beneficial from a managerial perspective, we propose a system of store-level regression models that decomposes the sales promotion bump into three parts: cross-brand effects (secondary demand), cross period effects (primary demand borrowed from other time periods), and category-expansion effects (remaining primary demand). Across four store-level scanner datasets, we find {{that each of these}} three parts contribute about one third on average. One extension we propose is the separation of the category-expansion effect into cross-store and market-expansion effects. Another one is to split the cross-item effect (total across all other items) into cannibalization and between-brand effects. We also allow for a flexible decomposition by allowing all effects to depend on the feature/display support condition and on the magnitude of the price discount. The latter dependence is achieved by local polynomial regression. We find that feature-supported price discounts are strongly associated with cross-period effects while display-only <b>supported</b> <b>price</b> discounts have especially strong category-expansion effects. While the role of the category-expansion effect tends to increase with higher price discounts, the roles of cross-brand and cross-period effects both tend to decrease...|$|E
40|$|Background: Several {{options are}} {{advocated}} by policy experts to mitigate alcohol-related harms, although {{the most effective}} strategies often have the least public support. While knowledge of tobacco-related health risks predicts support for relevant public health measures, {{it is not known}} whether knowledge of alcohol health risks is similarly associated with the acceptability of policies intended to reduce alcohol consumption and related harms. This study aims to gauge public support for a range of alcohol policies and {{to determine whether or not}} support is associated with knowledge of a long-term health risk of alcohol consumption, specifically cancer. Methods: 2482 adults in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, participated in an online survey. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association between demographic data, alcohol consumption, smoking status, knowledge of alcohol as a risk factor for cancer and support for alcohol-related policies. Results: Most participants were supportive of health warnings, restricting access to internet alcohol advertising to young people, and requiring information on national drinking guidelines on alcohol containers. Almost half of participants supported a ban on sport sponsorship, while less than 41 % <b>supported</b> <b>price</b> increases, volumetric taxation, or reducing the number of retail outlets. Only 47 % of participants identified drinking too much alcohol as a risk factor for cancer. Knowledge of alcohol as a risk factor for cancer was a significant predictor of support for all policies, while level of alcohol consumption had a significant inverse relationship with policy support. Conclusion: The finding that support for alcohol management policies is associated with awareness that drinking too much alcohol may contribute to cancer could assist in the planning of future public health interventions. Improving awareness of the long term health risks of alcohol consumption may be one avenue to increasing public support for effective alcohol harm-reduction policies...|$|E
40|$|As {{part of the}} 2006 {{reform of}} the European Union (EU) sugar regime, {{national}} quotas on the supply of sugar for domestic human consumption (for which beet producers receive a <b>supported</b> <b>price)</b> were renewed only up to 2014 / 15. It is {{the intention of the}} European Commission that they should not be renewed beyond that date, although this position is currently coming under renewed discussion. Three recent studies (LEI, 2010; European Commission, 2011 a; Nolte et al., 2012) have examined the effects of sugar quota abolition on the EU market and its trade position. These studies suggest that the net importer status of the EU would be maintained, although net imports decrease. However, there exist no studies investigating changes in bilateral trade flows between EU and third countries. This paper analyses the impacts of quota sugar cessation on the bilateral trade flows between the EU and third countries in 2020 against a reference scenario in which quotas remain in force. The study uses the partial equilibrium model CAPRI, which covers 77 countries grouped into 40 trade blocks. It models bilateral trade flows and bilateral trade measures between the various trade blocks. The results show that, with the expiry of EU sugar quotas, total EU sugar imports would be 43 % lower in 2020, while total EU sugar exports would decline by 16 %. Sugar imports from high-cost third countries decline very substantially, but those from the low-cost producer Brazil decrease only slightly. However, Brazil suffers loss of market share in third countries, notably in Africa, due to trade diversion. The net result is that, despite its strong comparative advantage in the production and marketing of sugar, Brazil suffers a welfare loss of EUR 40 million, whereas most other non-EU sugar-producing countries experience negligible welfare effects or small welfare gains. The largest welfare gain occurs in the EU (+EUR 845 million). JRC. J. 4 -Agriculture and Life Sciences in the Econom...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The main {{objective}} of this research were to analyze the impact of some agricultural investments in rice production, The increasing trend of rice production in Jambi {{during the years of}} study (1986 - 2010) has been resulted from considerable increase in government improving policy programs, such as <b>support</b> <b>price,</b> and input subsidy programs. The variations of acreage, yield, and output have been affected also by the price of output and input such as fertilizer. The more effectiveness between <b>price</b> <b>support</b> policy and input subsidy policy depend on the higher magnitude between the significant coefficients of these two variables. The first policy implication from {{the findings of this study}} is that the <b>price</b> <b>support</b> policy is more effective and efficient to increase the acreage. The effect of government <b>support</b> <b>prices</b> for rice is very important in analyzing the acreage response. Since the role of government <b>support</b> <b>prices</b> in this new environment has received very much attention in policy implications.
