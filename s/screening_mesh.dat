Thus, present study was planned (1) to evaluate the comparative efficacy of different insecticides (Trichlorphon, Malathion, Spinosad, Endosulfan, Deltamethrin, Spintoram, Imidacloprid, Diafenthuron and Permethrin) against these flies, (2) to evaluate the potential of six botanical (Neem nut. Neem leaves, Eucalyptus leaves, Nerium indicum leaves, Castor bean leaves and Tobacco leaves), (3) to determine the effectiveness of cultural/physical control (Light traps, <b>Screening</b> <b>mesh,</b> Hygiene and Temperature) and finally, (4) the integration of all these control measures in a compatible manners during three successive years of study. All the treatments were evaluated {{on the basis of}} reduction in adult of mushroom flies emergence (RAE), mushroom damage rate (MDR) in percentage and yield in three successive growing periods. Six insecticides viz., Trichlorphon, Malathion, Spinosad, Deltamethrin, Spintoram and Permethrin, out of nine, caused 77. 42 % to 90 % mortality of 3 rd instar larvae of phorid and sciarid fly under lab condition, while 73 % to 88 % in mushroom houses. Four plant extracts [Neem nut, Neem, Tobacco and Kanair (Nerium indicum) ] out of six caused 41 % to 72 % mortality of 3 rd instar larvae of phorid and sciarid fly under lab conditions, while 40 % to 68 % in mushroom houses. Pink colour flap light trap trapped maximum average mushroom flies per week (85. 50) followed by yellow (57. 00), blue (33. 95) and white (19. 45), respectively. <b>Screening</b> <b>mesh</b> and hygiene proved best reducing adult emergence up 51. 18 % and 45. 79 %, respectively.

40|$|The PhD thesis {{with the}} title “Investigation of several {{critical}} issues in <b>screen</b> <b>mesh</b> heat pipe manufacturing and operation” presented hereafter describes work carried out in four main areas. Initially the relevant literature is reviewed and presented, followed by the presentation of theoretical work regarding <b>screen</b> <b>mesh</b> heat pipe fill calculations, heat pipe processing and {{an investigation into the}} capillary or lifting height for <b>screen</b> <b>mesh</b> heat pipes. Further, the possibility of tailoring <b>screen</b> <b>mesh</b> heat pipes towards certain applications was investigated and it was found that further work is required in this area to allow a conclusive judgement whether a coarser or finer wick at the wall provides a distinguish advantage over two wraps of a medium coarse type. Within this approach a calculation method for the determination of the optimum working fluid fill of a <b>screen</b> <b>mesh</b> heat pipe based on geometrical parameters of the wick was developed and successfully implemented for the production of the later tested samples. The investigation into the effects of bending on the heat pipe performance, both using single phase flow CFD as well as experimentation, was performed using five different geometrical cases, each with five samples. These were tested in order to minimise the effects of sample variation. The test cases investigated contained the deformation angles of 0 ° (straight), 45 °, 90 °, 135 ° and 180 °. During all test cases the orientation of the samples was kept constant at 0 ° to minimise additional influences like the effects of gravity on the reduction of available power handling capability. The test results show in deviation from CFD results that <b>screen</b> <b>mesh</b> heat pipe performance is significantly affected when bends are introduced and the reduction in power handling capability can be up to nearly 50 % of a straight heat pipe value. Finally this thesis advances into the field of water heat pipe freeze thaw and the possibility of <b>screen</b> <b>mesh</b> heat pipes with changed shapes to withstand multiple freeze thaw cycles. It was found that correctly engineered <b>screen</b> <b>mesh</b> copper water heat pipes can be used in applications where they are subjected to multiple freeze thaw cycles. The fluid charge for water heat pipes subjected to these conditions needs to be adjusted in such a way, that accumulation of working fluid in certain areas, regardless of orientation or process variation during filling, is avoided.

In a PTR, the pulse tube is only filled with working gas and there exists secondary flow {{due to a}} large temperature difference between cold-end and warm-end. The stability of secondary flow is affected by orientation of cold-head and thus, the cooling performance is deteriorated by gas mixing due to secondary flow. In this study, a single stage GM-type pulse tube refrigerator is fabricated and tested. The cooing performance of the fabricated PTR is measured as varying cold-head orientation angle {{and the results are}} used as reference data. Then, we divided interior space of pulse tube into three segments, and fixed the various size of <b>screen</b> <b>mesh</b> at interface of each segment to suppress the performance degradation due to secondary flow. For various configuration of pulse tube, no-load test and heat load test are carried out with the fixed experimental condition of charging pressure, operating frequency and orifice valve turns.

The three cultivars were Hegazi, a local cultivar, and two exotic cultivars (Cuf 101 and Siriver). They were subjected to three water treatments (bore hole water, river water with <b>screen</b> <b>mesh</b> at the entrance of plots and river water without <b>screen</b> <b>mesh)</b> and three levels of weeding (monthly weeding, every two months and every three months). The treatments were assigned in a splitsplit plot design (watering as the main plots, weeding as the subplots and cultivars as the sub-subplots), replicated four times. The parameters studied were fresh and dry yields, crude protein and crude fiber content and number of weeds per unit area. The two introduced cultivars, Siriver and Cuf 101, were significantly better than the local cultivar, Hegazi, in forage fresh and dry yields and crude protein content. The local cultivar Hegazi gave a higher crude fiber content. Irrigation water treatments were not significantly different in crude protein and fiber contents.

40|$|In-space {{propulsion}} often necessitates {{the use of}} {{a capillary}} liquid acquisition device (LAD) to assure that gas-free liquid propellant is available to support engine restarts in microgravity. If a capillary screen-channel device is chosen, then the designer must determine the appropriate combination <b>screen</b> <b>mesh</b> and channel geometry. A <b>screen</b> <b>mesh</b> selection which results in the smallest LAD width when compared to any other screen candidate (for a constant length) is desirable; however, no best screen exists for all LAD design requirements. Flow rate, percent fill, and acceleration are the most influential drivers for determining screen widths. Increased flow rates and reduced percent fills increase the through-the-screen flow pressure losses, which drive the LAD to increased widths regardless of screen choice. Similarly, increased acceleration levels and corresponding liquid head pressures drive the <b>screen</b> <b>mesh</b> selection toward a higher bubble point (liquid retention capability). After ruling out some screens on the basis of acceleration requirements alone, candidates can be identified by examining screens with small flow-loss-to-bubble point ratios for a given condition (i. e., comparing screens at certain flow rates and fill levels). Within the same flow rate and fill level, the screen constants inertia resistance coefficient, void fraction, screen pore or opening diameter, and bubble point can become the driving forces in identifying the smaller flow-loss-to-bubble point ratios...|$|R
