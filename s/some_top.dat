5|$|For the Canadian contingent, Laurence and Mackenzie set out {{to recruit}} <b>some</b> <b>top</b> nuclear physicists, of whom there were few in Canada. The first was George Volkoff at the University of British Columbia, {{who had worked with}} Robert Oppenheimer on the physics of neutron stars. They also tried to recruit Harry Thode from McMaster University, but found that Harold Urey from the Manhattan Project's SAM Laboratories was also {{interested}} in Thode's expertise in testing heavy water with mass spectrography, and had made a more attractive offer. A compromise was reached whereby Thode did work for the Montreal Laboratory, but remained at McMaster University. Promising young Canadian scientists were also recruited, including J. Carson Mark, Phil Wallace and Leo Yaffe.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before the}} Oberhof sprint in January 2010, Neuner injured her back during warm-up {{and had to}} withdraw. She {{returned}} in Ruhpolding where she came in third in both the sprint and the mass start race. In her first relay of the season, she dealt {{a blow to the}} German team by incurring two penalty loops, with Germany finishing fourth eventually. With <b>some</b> <b>top</b> competitors missing in Antholz at the last World Cup before the 2010 Winter Olympics, Neuner won two events—the first individual race of her career as well as the sprint, giving her 16 career World Cup wins. She also came in second in the pursuit, which marked her seventh consecutive podium finish.|$|E
5|$|<b>Some</b> <b>top</b> riders receive special frames to {{give more}} {{stability}} and comfort. Different materials make the ride more comfortable. Tom Boonen, using a Time frame with longer wheelbase for the first time, won the race in 2005 and has since continued to use a bike with a longer wheelbase. George Hincapie had a frame featuring a 2mm elastomer insert {{at the top of}} the seat stays. The manufacturers claimed this took nearly all the shock out of the cobbles. Hincapie's Trek bicycle fared less well in 2006: his aluminum steerer tube snapped with 46km to go, the crash injuring his shoulder.|$|E

Lenin, sought to concentrate state funding on the basic education {{of the working class}} rather than on whimsical artistic endeavors.

25|$|In late 1938, {{during the}} great crisis in Europe over Czechoslovakia that culminated in the Munich Agreement, Canadians were divided. Francophones insisted on neutrality, as did <b>some</b> <b>top</b> {{advisers}} like Oscar D. Skelton. Imperialists stood behind Britain and were willing to fight Germany. King, who served as his own {{secretary of state for}} external affairs (foreign minister), said privately that if he had to choose he would not be neutral, but he made no public statement. All of Canada was relieved that the British appeasement at Munich, while sacrificing the rights of Czechoslovakia, seemed to bring peace.|$|E

25|$|As the North Vietnamese chipped {{away more}} and more at South Vietnam, {{internal}} opposition to President Thiệu continued to accumulate. For instance, in early April, the Senate unanimously voted through a call for new leadership, and <b>some</b> <b>top</b> military commanders were pressing for a coup. In response to this pressure, Thiệu made some changes to his cabinet, and Prime Minister Trần Thiện Khiêm resigned. This did little to reduce the opposition to Thiệu. On April 8 a South Vietnamese pilot and communist spy, Nguyễn Thành Trung, bombed the presidential palace and then flew to a PAVN-controlled airstrip; Thiệu was not hurt.|$|E
25|$|Golf {{instruction}} {{involves the}} teaching and learning of the game of golf. Proficiency in teaching golf instruction requires not only technical and physical ability but also knowledge of the rules and etiquette of the game. In some countries, golf instruction is best performed by teachers certified by the Professional Golfers Association. <b>Some</b> <b>top</b> instructors who work with professional golfers have become quite well known in their own right. Professional golf instructors can use physical conditioning, mental visualization, classroom sessions, club fitting, driving range instruction, on-course play under real conditions, and review of videotaped swings in slow motion to teach golf to prepare the golfer for the course.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, in two handed bowling, {{two fingers}} are {{inserted}} into the ball with the thumb left out. The dominant hand is then used to cradle the ball and creates extra spin on the release. Then, the opposite hand is used to guide the ball through the throwing motion, with the ball delivered shovel-style. Two handed bowlers are forced to flex forward farther and rotate their hips {{more than a single}} handed bowler. These bowlers are placing more torque through the spine in order to increase the ball speed and revolution rate. This form of bowling, if done correctly, increases force, revolutions and pin carry. A two handed bowler's revolution rate can reach up to 700 revolutions per minute, which is up to 17% more rotation than the nearest elite single handed bowler and twice what <b>some</b> <b>top</b> professional bowlers generate.|$|E

25|$|A {{higher than}} average {{concentration}} of hagwon in the Gangnam-gu (강남구) area, specifically Daechi-dong (대치동), has been cited as {{the primary reason for}} an increase in real estate costs in the area. In the 1970s the Seoul government made <b>some</b> <b>top</b> schools relocate to the area; however, the schools there have become associated with entry into elite high schools and then elite universities. Many residents feel their children need to be associated with these schools in order to reach the upper levels of business and success. As more parents try to move to the area to allow their children to attend these schools, the prices of real estate in the area have risen to 300percent of similar areas in Seoul. In 2003 the government had planned to develop a hagwon center in Pangyo to relieve some of the pressure on Gangnam, yet after heavy criticism for only shifting the problem around and not solving it, the government canceled the plan only a couple weeks later.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} widely known tour is the PGA Tour, which tends to attract the strongest fields, outside the four Majors and the four World Golf Championships events. This is due mostly {{to the fact that}} most PGA Tour events have a first prize of at least 800,000 USD. The European Tour, which attracts a {{substantial}} number of top golfers from outside North America, ranks second to the PGA Tour in worldwide prestige. <b>Some</b> <b>top</b> professionals from outside North America play enough tournaments to maintain membership on both the PGA Tour and European Tour. Since 2010, both tours' money titles have been claimed by the same individual three times, with Luke Donald doing so in 2011 and Rory McIlroy in 2012 and 2014. In 2013, Henrik Stenson won the FedEx Cup points race on the PGA Tour and the European Tour money title, but did not top the PGA Tour money list (that honour going to Tiger Woods).|$|E
25|$|Before the Melbourne Park stadium era, tournament dates fluctuated as well, in {{particular}} {{in the early years}} because of the climate of each site or exceptional events. For example, the 1919 tournament was held in January 1920 (the 1920 tournament was played in March) and the 1923 tournament in Brisbane took place in August when the weather was not too hot and wet. After a first 1977 tournament was held in December 1976– January 1977, the organisers chose to move the next tournament forward a few days, then a second 1977 tournament was played (ended on 31 December), but this failed to attract the best players. From 1982 to 1985, the tournament was played in mid-December. Then it was decided to move the next tournament to mid-January (January 1987), which meant there was no tournament in 1986. Since 1987, the Australian Open date has not changed. However, <b>some</b> <b>top</b> players, including Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, have said that the tournament is held too soon after the Christmas and New Year holidays, thus preventing players from reaching their best form, and expressed a desire to shift it to February. Such a change, however, would move the tournament outside the summer school holiday period, potentially impacting attendance figures.|$|E

50|$|The {{motion of}} a top is {{produced}} in the most simple forms by twirling the stem using the fingers. More sophisticated tops are spun by holding the axis firmly while pulling a string or twisting a stick or pushing an auger. In the kinds with an auger, an internal weight rotates, producing an overall circular motion. <b>Some</b> <b>tops</b> can be thrown, while firmly grasping a string that had been tightly wound around the stem, and the centrifugal force generated by the unwinding motion of the string will set them spinning upon touching ground.|$|R
25|$|The club's {{management}} {{took the}} 2003 season very seriously, appointing as its new coach the former World Player of the Year Lothar Matthäus, and brought <b>some</b> <b>top</b> and experienced players like Taribo West from 1.FC Kaiserslautern, Ljubinko Drulović from Benfica and Tomasz Rząsa from Feyenoord. For {{the first time}} in its history, the club played in the UEFA Champions League after eliminating Bobby Robson's Newcastle United. In Belgrade, Partizan lost by 0–1, but in rematch at St James's Park, they won by Ivica Iliev's goal in regular time and reached the group stages after a penalty shoot-out. Later on, Partizan was drawn in a tough group with Real Madrid (the previous year's Champions League semi-finalist), Porto (the winner of the 2002–03 UEFA Cup and the eventual winner of the competition) and Marseille (the eventual runners-up of the 2003–04 UEFA Cup). The Partizan Stadium was a tough ground for the opposition and the team did not lost a home game, playing out a 0–0 draw with Real Madrid's famous Galácticos, which included players such as Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo, Luís Figo, Roberto Carlos, Raúl and David Beckham; a 1–1 draw with Porto, led by coach José Mourinho; and Marseille, with its superstars Fabien Barthez and Didier Drogba, while playing some inspired football in the away match in Madrid (0–1), Marseille (0–3) and Porto (1–2). They are the first, and so far the only, Serbian team to qualify for the main draw of this elite European club competition since its inception in 1992.|$|E
500|$|Starting in 1983, the Vlaams Blok {{increasingly}} began {{focusing on}} immigration (inspired {{by the success}} of other European right-wing populist parties), and on the international day against racism in 1984 held its first conference to discuss the [...] "foreigner problem." [...] The same year, Dillen proposed a bill in the Chamber of Representatives to offer cash incentive for immigrants to return to their native country. In April 1987, a group around Roger Frankinouille of the only right-wing competitor to the Vlaams Blok, the anti-tax Respect for Labour and Democracy, switched to the party. The party campaigned for the 1987 general election with the slogan [...] "Own people first" [...] (Eigen volk eerst!, inspired by French National Front slogan [...] "The French first"), and saw a slight victory, winning their first seat in Senate (taken by Dillen), {{and for the first time}} two seats in the Chamber (Dewinter and Annemans). The party's shift towards focusing on immigration was however criticised by some Vlaams Blok members, and ultimately also led to the defection of <b>some</b> <b>top</b> party figures. The party nevertheless made a clear choice of focussing on the immigration issue, which had, and would, give results in elections.|$|E
