40|$|The {{results of}} {{toxicity}} testing of additional materials is presented. Relative toxicity data on polymers by generic type are presented and include wood, polyurethane flexible foam, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), acrylonitrile/butadiene/styrene (ABS), and polyisoprene (natural rubber). A second table gives relative toxicity data on fibers and fabrics including wool, nylon, rayon, polyester, and aromatic polyamide. Sulfur-containing materials seemed to exhibit the <b>shortest</b> <b>times</b> {{to death of}} laboratory animals. Some chlorine-containing polymers tended to exhibit <b>shortest</b> <b>time</b> to death also while some halogen-containing polymers gave the <b>shortest</b> <b>time</b> to incapacitation. Among fibers and fabrics, wool, silk, and polyester exhibited the <b>shortest</b> <b>times</b> to incapacitation and times to death. Difficulty in restricting generally accepted materials is discussed and attention is given to other factors important in comparing materials, such as backcoatings and relative weights...|$|R

30|$|Among the {{stations}} {{to which the}} vehicle request could be addressed, the providing one is selected according to two criteria: the closest one (<b>shortest</b> <b>time</b> criterion) and the station having {{the highest number of}} vehicles (inventory balancing). The <b>shortest</b> <b>time</b> criterion relates mainly to service levels, while the inventory balancing mainly focuses on cost efficiency. Therefore, an appropriate choice of relocation technique should be made according to the current system situation: in periods of low usage, the most appropriate relocation technique is by inventory balancing whilst in periods of high usage, then the <b>shortest</b> <b>time</b> technique performs best [7, 10].|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the short-time dynamics of a delta-function potential barrier on an initially confined wave-packet. There are mainly two conclusions: A) At <b>short</b> <b>times</b> the probability {{density of the}} first particles that passed through the barrier is unaffected by it. B) When the barrier is absorptive (i. e., its potential is imaginary) it affects the transmitted wave function at <b>shorter</b> <b>times</b> than a real potential barrier. Therefore, {{it is possible to}} distinguish between an imaginary and a real potential barrier by measuring its effect at <b>short</b> <b>times</b> only on the transmitting wavefunction.

5|$|Although {{sometimes}} {{interpreted as}} the result of a single catastrophe, the Bernissart finds instead are now interpreted as recording multiple events.
