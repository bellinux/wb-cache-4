In environmental ecology homogeneity threatens diversity through the spread of destructive agents (weeds, feral animals, aircraft noise); similarly, homogenising agents in urban soundscapes (mediatisation, motorised traffic and ventilation systems) threaten the diversity of <b>social</b> <b>ecologies</b> and mental ecologies. This paper describes two public soundscape installations that challenge homogenisation by creating multiplicities of acoustic ecologies through transformations of everyday sounds for the diversification of <b>social</b> <b>ecologies</b> and mental ecologies...|$|R

25|$|<b>Social</b> <b>ecology</b> {{is closely}} related to the work and ideas of Murray Bookchin and {{influenced}} by anarchist Peter Kropotkin.

50|$|<b>Social</b> <b>ecology's</b> <b>social</b> {{component}} {{comes from}} its position {{that nearly all}} of the world's ecological problems stem from social problems; with these social problems in turn arising from structures and relationships of dominating hierarchy. They argue that apart from those produced by natural catastrophes, the most serious ecological dislocations of the 20th and 21st centuries have as their cause economic, ethnic, cultural, and gender conflicts, among many others. Present ecological problems, social ecologists maintain, cannot be clearly understood, much less resolved, without resolutely dealing with problems within society.|$|R

25|$|Green anarchism (or eco-anarchism) is {{a school}} of thought within anarchism which puts an {{emphasis}} on environmental issues. An important early influence was {{the thought of the}} American anarchist Henry David Thoreau and his book Walden as well as Leo Tolstoy and Elisee Reclus. In the late 19th century there emerged anarcho-naturism as the fusion of anarchism and naturist philosophies within individualist anarchist circles in France, Spain and Portugal. Important contemporary currents are anarcho-primitivism and <b>social</b> <b>ecology.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Social</b> <b>ecology</b> is a {{philosophy}} developed by Murray Bookchin in the 1960s; it holds that present ecological problems {{are rooted in}} deep-seated social problems, particularly in dominatory hierarchical political and social systems. These have resulted in an uncritical acceptance of an overly competitive grow-or-die philosophy. It suggests that this cannot be resisted by individual action such as ethical consumerism but must be addressed by more nuanced ethical thinking and collective activity grounded in radical democratic ideals. The complexity of relationships between people and with nature is emphasised, along with the importance of establishing social structures that take account of this.|$|E
500|$|According to Murray Bookchin, {{the idea}} that humans must {{dominate}} nature is common in hierarchical societies. Bookchin contends that capitalism and market relationships, if unchecked, {{have the capacity to}} reduce the planet to a mere resource to be exploited. Nature is thus treated as a commodity: [...] "The plundering of the human spirit by the market place is paralleled by the plundering of the earth by capital." [...] <b>Social</b> <b>ecology,</b> founded by Bookchin, is based on the conviction that nearly all of humanity's present ecological problems originate in, indeed are mere symptoms of, dysfunctional social arrangements. Whereas most authors proceed as if our ecological problems can be fixed by implementing recommendations which stem from physical, biological, economic etc., studies, Bookchin's claim is that these problems can only be resolved by understanding the underlying social processes and intervening in those processes by applying the concepts and methods of the social sciences.|$|E

While formal scientific data on the biological and <b>social</b> <b>ecologies</b> of most NTF'Ps are limited to nonexistent, long-time gather-ers often have extensive experiential knowledge bases.

2500|$|Though Kovel {{recognises}} <b>Social</b> <b>Ecology</b> {{as part of}} {{a similar}} radical tradition as eco-socialism, he still distinguishes one from the other because Social Ecologists see hierarchy [...] "in-itself" [...] as the cause of ecological destruction, whereas eco-socialists focus on gender and class domination embodied in capitalism and recognise that forms of authority that are not [...] "an expropriation of human power for... self-aggrandizement", such as a student-teacher relationship that is [...] "reciprocal and mutual", are beneficial. In practice, Kovel describes <b>Social</b> <b>Ecology</b> as continuing the anarchist tradition of non-violent direct action, which is [...] "necessary" [...] but [...] "not sufficient" [...] because [...] "it leaves unspoken the question of building an ecological society beyond capital". Furthermore, Social Ecologists and anarchists tend to focus on the state alone, rather than the class relations behind state domination (in the view of Marxists). Kovel fears that this is political, springing from historic hostility to Marxism among anarchists and sectarianism, which he points out as a fault of the [...] "brilliant" [...] but [...] "dogmatic" [...] founder of <b>Social</b> <b>Ecology,</b> Murray Bookchin.|$|E

2500|$|Bookchin later {{developed}} a political philosophy to complement <b>social</b> <b>ecology</b> {{that he called}} [...] "Communalism" [...] (spelled with a capital [...] "C" [...] to differentiate it from other forms of communalism).

2500|$|Since the 1950s, <b>social</b> <b>ecology</b> {{studies have}} {{built on the}} social {{disorganization}} theories. [...] Many {{studies have found that}} crime rates are associated with poverty, disorder, high numbers of abandoned buildings, and other signs of community deterioration.

2500|$|Social anarchism is an {{umbrella}} {{term used to}} identify a broad category of anarchism independent of individualist anarchism.

[...] Social anarchism is used to specifically describe anarchist tendencies within anarchism that have {{an emphasis on the}} communitarian and cooperative aspects of anarchist theory and practice. Social anarchism includes (but is not limited to) collectivist anarchism, anarcho-communism, libertarian socialism, anarcho-syndicalism and <b>social</b> <b>ecology.</b>|$|E
