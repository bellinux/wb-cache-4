50|$|For routing pre-terminated cables (cables with connectors), split {{cable glands}} can be used. These cable glands consist of three parts (two gland halves and a split <b>sealing</b> <b>grommet)</b> which are screwed with a {{hexagonal}} locknut (like normal cable glands). Thus, pre-assembled cables can be routed without removing the plugs.|$|E
50|$|Alternatively, split {{cable entry}} {{systems can be}} used (normally {{consisting}} of a hard frame and several <b>sealing</b> <b>grommets)</b> to route {{a large number of}} pre-terminated cables through one wall cut-out.|$|R
50|$|Santoprene TPV {{is used in}} weatherseals, {{underhood}} and under-car applications, {{and interior}} components. In weatherseals, TPV {{is used as a}} lightweight alternative to thermoset rubber materials in semi-dynamic and static parts, while in underhood and under-car applications it is well-suited for air ducts, tubing, molded <b>seals,</b> <b>grommets,</b> suspension bellows, cable jacketing, plugs, bumpers and many other parts. This is due to its sealing performance and resistance to extreme temperatures, chemical exposure and harsh environments.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is used in}} the {{automotive}} and aeronautical industry to make fuel and oil handling hoses, <b>seals,</b> <b>grommets,</b> and self-sealing fuel tanks, since ordinary rubbers cannot be used. [...] It {{is used in the}} nuclear industry to make protective gloves. NBR's ability to withstand a range of temperatures from [...] makes it an ideal material for aeronautical applications. Nitrile butadiene is also used to create moulded goods, footwear, adhesives, sealants, sponges, expanded foams, and floor mats.|$|R
50|$|For routing cables {{which are}} already {{assembled}} with connectors, split cable entry {{systems have been}} developed. The divisibility of these systems provides two advantages. The warranty on pre-terminated cables remains since the connectors donâ€™t have to be cut and soldered again after entering the cables. The other advantage is that assembly can be done subsequently because the split cable entries are usually built around the existing lines.Most split cable entries consist of a split hard frame, made of plastic or sometimes aluminium (e.g. utilised in food industry) and one or several split <b>sealing</b> <b>grommets,</b> usually made of elastomer. The grommet matching the cable diameter is placed around the cable and fixed inside the cable entry frame. Thus allowing strain relief for the cables (in some cases according to EN 50262) as well as ingress protection of up to IP 65/66/67.|$|R
50|$|In plumbing, Santoprene TPV is used {{to create}} {{long-term}} <b>seals,</b> gaskets and <b>grommets</b> that are resistant to flex fatigue, harsh temperatures and chemicals. It {{can be used in}} a variety of sealing applications including pipe seals, bridge expansion joints and curtain walls, parts for potable water and pipe seals for sewer and drainage.|$|R
2500|$|The {{pressurised}} {{cabin was}} used to counter the physiological problems encountered by pilots at high altitudes. The cabin was not like the fully pressurised cabin of a modern airliner; the pressure differential provided by the modified cockpit of the VI was only two {{pounds per square inch}} (which was double the Air Ministry requirement). To achieve this, the forward and rear cockpit bulkheads were completely enclosed, with all control and electrical cables exiting though special rubber <b>sealing</b> <b>grommets.</b> In addition, the side cockpit door was replaced with alloy skin and the canopy was no longer a sliding unit: externally there were no slide rails. Once the pilot was in, the canopy was locked in place with four toggles and sealed with an inflatable rubber tube. It could be jettisoned by the pilot in an emergency. The windscreen of production Mk VIs was the same as the type fitted to the Mark III and some Mk Vs although it was fitted with an inward opening clear-view panel on the port quarter pane. The effect was to make [...] seem like [...] to the pilot, who would still have to wear an oxygen mask. Pressurisation was achieved by a Marshall-manufactured compressor located on the starboard side of the engine, fed by a long intake below the starboard exhaust stubs. Mk VIs were built with the Coffman cartridge starter, with a small teardrop fairing just ahead of the compressor intake.|$|R
50|$|Pressure cookers {{usually have}} two safety valves to prevent explosions. On older designs, {{one is a}} nozzle upon which a weight sits. The other is a <b>sealed</b> rubber <b>grommet</b> which is ejected in a {{controlled}} explosion if the first valve gets blocked. On newer generation pressure cookers, if the steam vent gets blocked, a safety spring will eject excess pressure and if that fails, the gasket will expand and release excess pressure downwards between the lid and the pan. Also, newer generation pressure cookers have a safety interlock which locks the lid when internal pressure exceeds atmospheric pressure, to prevent accidents from a sudden release of very hot steam, food and liquid, which {{would happen if the}} lid were to be removed when the pan is still slightly pressurised inside (however, the lid will be very hard or impossible to open when the pan is still pressurised).|$|R
