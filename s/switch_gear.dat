All Japanese Supras came with either a 5-speed manual transmission or the 4-speed automatic transmission with ECT-s except the G and the S where ECT-S wasn't available. In Japan the 3.0 GT Turbo Limited, the 3.0 GT Turbo and the GT Twin Turbo were installed standard with a digital instrument panel, the 3.0 L installed versions came with an AM/FM Cassette stereo with an integrated CD player and cruise control. Climate control was also standard on all turbo equipped vehicles, and leather interior was only available on the GT Turbo Limited.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the provision of}} the data communication of the new protection relays via 6 kV <b>switch</b> <b>gears</b> to the electro monitoring system at the Dukovany Nuclear Power Station. These protection relays will replace the current analog protection. The replacement process will start in 2015 and will finish in 2018. Given the overall complexity of the project, this thesis deals only with the following 6 kV <b>switch</b> <b>gears</b> 9 BB and 9 BD. The thesis is divided into a theoretical and a practical part. The theoretical part concerns the actual consumption and output of the Dukovany Nuclear Power Station. The following chapters describe the electro monitoring system and GRAF and LOGA software programs that are closely connected with it and {{that were used in}} the practical part. The last chapter of the theoretical part deals with the actual replacement of the protection relays of the 6 kV <b>switch</b> <b>gears.</b> Also, it describes a new optical network, which will be set up at the Dukovany Nuclear Power Station {{as a part of the}} process of replacement. The segment of the practical part concerns laboratory verification of the data communication of the new protection relays. Next, it describes actions that had to be taken in order to ensure and verify correct functionality of the data communication. This part is followed up by a closely related practical activity, which describes examination and verification of the protection functions of each of the 9 BB and 9 BD <b>switch</b> <b>gears</b> protection relays...|$|R

50|$|Switches, circuit breakers, {{transformers}} {{and other}} apparatus may be interconnected by air-insulated bare conductors strung on support structures. The air space required increases with system voltage {{and with the}} lightning surge voltage rating. For medium-voltage distribution substations, metal-enclosed <b>switch</b> <b>gear</b> may be used and no live conductors exposed at all. For higher voltages, gas-insulated <b>switch</b> <b>gear</b> reduces the space required around live bus. Instead of bare conductors, bus and apparatus are built into pressurized tubular containers filled with sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) gas. This gas has a higher insulating value than air, allowing {{the dimensions of the}} apparatus to be reduced. In addition to air or SF6 gas, apparatus will use other insulation materials such as transformer oil, paper, porcelain, and polymer insulators.|$|E

50|$|For {{an overall}} power {{transmission}} system, {{this means that}} for a given amount of power, AC requires more expensive wire, insulators, and towers but less expensive equipment like transformers and <b>switch</b> <b>gear</b> on {{either end of the}} line. For shorter distances, the cost of the equipment outweighs the savings in the cost of the transmission line. Over longer distances, the cost differential in the line starts to become more significant, which makes high-voltage direct current (HVDC) economically advantageous.|$|E
