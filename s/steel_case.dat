5|$|The legal Underbelly DVD was {{released}} 8 May 2008 by Roadshow Entertainment, {{a day after}} the final episode was aired on television. In accordance with the legal suppression, the release was not distributed through any retail or rental outlets in Victoria or on the internet. Roadshow Entertainment has confirmed that all box sets and point of sale displays will carry a sticker or stamp reminding buyers the series is not for sale, distribution or exhibition in Victoria. Legal experts said Victorians who bought the box set interstate and watched it themselves at home would likely not fall foul of the law, but anyone who showed it more widely could be charged with contempt. The DVD has sold 265,000 copies around Australia. In September 2008, a Limited Edition DVD {{was released}}, containing a numbered <b>steel</b> <b>case</b> and an extra disc with a documentary entitled Carl Williams– A Day of Reckoning. The Underbelly soundtrack was released on 29 March 2008, both as a CD and online. It features elements of the score by Burkhard Dallwitz in addition to music tracks that were featured in the series. Underbelly was released on Blu-ray on 5 August 2010.|$|E

25|$|The torso of an {{executed}} {{person would}} have normally been given to friends or family; but Montrose {{was the subject of}} an excommunication which was why it was originally buried in unconsecrated ground. In 1650 his niece, Lady Napier, had sent men by night to remove his heart. This relic she placed in a <b>steel</b> <b>case</b> made from his sword and placed the whole in a gold filigree box, which had been presented to her family by a Doge of Venice. The heart in its case was retained by the Napier family for several generations until lost amidst the confusion of the French Revolution.|$|E
25|$|The {{attack was}} carried out by 16 partisans of the Communist-dominated {{resistance}} organisation Gruppo d'Azione Patriottica ("Patriotic Action Group") or GAP. An improvised explosive device was prepared consisting of 12 kilograms of TNT packed in a <b>steel</b> <b>case.</b> This was inserted into a bag containing an additional six kilograms of TNT and TNT filled iron tubing. Although reported as having been thrown from a building, the bomb had actually been hidden in a rubbish cart, pushed into position by a Partisan disguised as a street cleaner, while others acted as lookouts. The fuse was lit when the police were forty seconds from the bomb. The blast caused the immediate deaths of 28 SS policemen and may have killed two civilian bystanders, one of whom, Piero Zuccheretti, was an eleven-year-old boy, although he might have been killed by the Germans firing in response; it is unknown. More would die over the next few days. All sixteen Partisans—some of whom fired on the German column—succeeded in melting away into the crowd unscathed.|$|E
50|$|Steel {{is used in}} some plinking ammunition, {{as well as in}} some {{military}} ammunition (mainly from the former Soviet Union and China). Steel is less expensive than brass, but it is not feasible to reload and reuse <b>steel</b> <b>cases.</b> Military forces typically consider small arms cartridge cases to be disposable, one-time-use devices. However, case weight (mass) affects how much ammunition a soldier can carry, so the lighter <b>steel</b> <b>cases</b> do have a military advantage. Conversely, steel is more susceptible to contamination and damage so all such cases are varnished or otherwise sealed against the elements.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Steel</b> <b>Casing</b> Pipe, {{also known}} as {{encasement}} pipe, is most commonly used in underground construction to protect utility lines of various types from getting damaged. Such damage might occur due to the elements of nature or human activity.|$|R
50|$|If {{mounted on}} a utility pole, they are called pole-mount transformers. If the {{distribution}} lines are located at ground level or underground, distribution transformers are mounted on concrete pads and locked in <b>steel</b> <b>cases,</b> thus known as pad-mount transformers.|$|R

It also included a [...] "Don Comic Book". A <b>steel</b> <b>case</b> limited edition DVD was released in January 2007 with the same bonus features. The VCD version was released at the same time. A single-disc DVD pack was also released later. The Blu-ray version was released on 27April 2011.|$|E
2500|$|At the game's release, Epic Games {{released}} a Limited Collectors Edition. Some of the notable differences are a <b>steel</b> <b>case</b> {{instead of the}} regular plastic case and an extra disc which contains artworks of environments and stages including Locust that {{never made it to}} the game, and extra content and behind footage of the making of Gears of War. The disc also contains a time-lapse on the creation of the [...] "Emergence" [...] mural. The game's disc and case has a different cover and instead features the Omen background. Another of the Collector's Edition extras is a book titled Destroyed Beauty which illustrates the game's back-story and includes concepts, sketches, and descriptions of the game's characters. The Collector's Edition also includes the same instruction manual and 48-hour Xbox Live Gold trial as the regular game does.|$|E
2500|$|The Signature Edition is {{exclusive}} to Europe, Australia and New Zealand. It includes a retail {{version of the}} game, a <b>steel</b> <b>case</b> finished in 'Obsidian Black' (official Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG colour choice), a coffee table book that details the cars and locations in GT5, a 300-page APEX book with hints on driving technique, car tuning, future technologies and more, a Gran Turismo-branded wallet containing a competition entry card giving one person the opportunity to win a real Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG car (the competition will {{be similar to the}} GT Academy), a GT-branded USB pen drive containing an exclusive GT5 dynamic theme and a Polyphony Digital/Mercedes-Benz exclusive trailer, a custom etched Keychain, a 1:43 scale Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG model in an exclusive livery, an e-voucher for six unique [...] "Stealth" [...] edition cars and an e-voucher for five unique [...] "Chrome Line" [...] edition cars.|$|E
50|$|The P-40 mine is a Vietnamese anti-personnel {{fragmentation}} stake mine. The mines {{were produced}} using the spherical <b>steel</b> <b>cases</b> of U.S. BLU-24/B and BLU-66 submunitions {{on top of}} which is a plastic adaptor to accept an MUV style tripwire fuze.|$|R
50|$|The {{need for}} point-focal {{penetration}} {{led to the}} development of the Vulcan shaped charge system. After initial experiments using the precursor of the Vulcan to inject liquids which reacted hypergolically with the explosive fill of <b>steel</b> <b>cased</b> munitions, Alford realised that a magnesium cone, which was much manageable than the liquids required for hypergolic reaction, formed a jet which ignited as it was formed. This was quickly shown to provide a simple and reliable means of bringing about relatively gentle deflagration of small and large <b>steel</b> <b>cased</b> munitions with only a low probability of causing detonation. Since then a range of projectiles has been developed for the Vulcan for various other applications.|$|R
50|$|Console noise {{comes from}} {{magnetic}} components on or within the console. These include ferrite in cores in inductors and transformers, steel frames around LCD's, legs on IC chips and <b>steel</b> <b>cases</b> in disposable batteries.

2500|$|Their ninth album, Quaristice, was {{released}} in early 2008. In contrast to Untilted, it {{is made up of}} twenty tracks, more than any other Autechre release, each typically around 2–5minutes in length. The download-only Quaristice.Quadrange.ep.ae EP that accompanies it (as well as the Versions bonus disc and three tracks released exclusively through the Japanese iTunes Store) brings the total length of music released during their Quaristice era to over five hours. Among this is the hour-long [...] "Perlence subrange 6-36" [...] that closes the EP. Each track on Quaristice was edited down from lengthy improvised sessions between Booth and Brown, some of which were released in longer versions on Quaristice. Quadrange.ep.ae. Although Sean Booth has stated that the FLAC release of Quaristice is the actual product, the album was also released by Warp Records as a double LP and a single CD as well as an elaborate two CD edition by Warp Records. Limited to only 1000 copies, and containing both the regular album and Quaristice (Versions), this special edition was packaged in a photo-etched <b>steel</b> <b>case.</b> It sold out within 12 hours of being announced.|$|E

5000|$|The ATM-72 is a <b>steel</b> <b>cased</b> {{circular}} North Korean anti-tank mine. It {{is similar}} to the Russian TM-46, with a thick wire carrying handle and a filling plug. The mine uses a four pronged fuze, downward pressure on any of the levers will trigger the mine. The lever action of the mine makes it resistant to overpressure and blast.|$|R
50|$|The {{shortage}} of brass {{in the later}} stages of World War II led {{to the use of}} <b>steel</b> <b>cases</b> for this new cartridge. The Kurz cartridge incorporated more taper than the parent <b>case</b> because <b>steel</b> is less elastic than brass and more difficult to extract (and because the fact that the cartridge retained the same base diameter and caliber as the longer, full size round, requiring a more abrupt taper). This led to the distinctive curved magazine for weapons that used this cartridge, which became popularly known as banana clips, due to their curved shape, and which can be seen on other weapons using distinctly tapered cartridges, like the Kalashnikov rifle. The <b>steel</b> <b>cases</b> were typically lacquer-coated to prevent corrosion. The weight of the 7.92mm Kurz S.m.E. round was 17.05 g, the bullet taking up 8.1 g and the cartridge and powder the remaining 8.95 g.|$|R
5000|$|... "There {{were many}} German {{military}} {{versions of the}} cartridge, and Germany never stopped its development of different variations until the end" [...] of World War II. [...] "The bullet lengths varied a great deal through the different types, but all were loaded to an overall length" [...] of 80.5 mm. The Germans had started using <b>steel</b> <b>cases</b> in World War I, [...] "and {{by the end of}} 1943, most German ammunition had that type of case." [...] The weights and case capacities of the World War II military cartridge cases varied somewhat. The German military ammunition manufacturer Polte produced brass cartridge cases weighing 10.32 g (159 gr) with 4.03 ml (62 gr) H2O <b>case</b> capacity and <b>steel</b> cartridge <b>cases</b> weighing 10.90 g (168 gr) with 3.95 ml (61 gr) H2O <b>case</b> capacity. The <b>steel</b> cartridge <b>cases</b> were produced in copper plated and lacquered executions.|$|R
