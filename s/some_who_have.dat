25|$|Although women's cricket has a {{long history}} in Samoa, the {{national}} team was only formally organised in 2010, with assistance from a New Zealand association, Auckland Cricket. The team has often included Samoan expatriate players based in Australia and New Zealand (including <b>some</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> played for state or provincial teams), which has presented difficulties in training. Samoa's first regional tournament came later in 2010, and it has since regularly participated in ICC East Asia-Pacific events, generally ranking behind only Japan and Papua New Guinea in the region. Its most notable achievement is winning the gold medal in the women's tournament at the 2015 Pacific Games. The team is currently coached by Ian West, an Englishman who gained Samoan citizenship through his wife, and subsequently played for the Samoan men's team. , one unofficial ranking system places Samoa 27th in the world, behind Kenya.|$|E

500|$|Arctic Monkeys {{wasted no}} time in {{recording}} new material, and released a five-track EP on 24 April 2006, titled Who the Fuck Are Arctic Monkeys?. Due to its length, the EP was ineligible to chart as a UK single or album. Furthermore, the record's graphic language has resulted in significantly less radio airplay than previous records, although this was not a reported concern according to an insider – [...] "since they made their name on the Internet... they don't care if they don't get radio play". The release of the EP Who the Fuck Are Arctic Monkeys? just three months after their record-breaking debut album has been criticised by <b>some,</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> seen it as [...] "money-grabbing" [...] and [...] "cashing in on their success". The band countered that it regularly releases new music not to make money, but to avoid the [...] "boredom" [...] of [...] "spending three years touring on one album".|$|E

This is {{certainly}} the view of Superman producer Ilya Salkind and <b>some</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> interviewed him, {{as well as of}} film production assistant Brad Lohan. Other observers of film history tend to credit the resurgence of science fiction films simply to the Lucas and Spielberg productions, and see Superman as the first of the new cycle of films launched by the first two. Ilya Salkind denies any connection between Superman—which began filming in March 1977—and the other films, stating that [...] "I did not know about 'Star Wars'; 'Star Wars' did not know about 'Superman'; 'Close Encounters' did not know about 'Superman.' It really was completely independent—nobody knew anything about anybody." [...] Superman also established the superhero film genre as viable outside the production of low-budget Saturday matinee serials. Director Christopher Nolan cited Richard Donner's vision and scope of Superman when pitching the concept for Batman Begins to Warner Bros. in 2002.|$|E
500|$|The V-22 has triple-redundant {{fly-by-wire}} {{flight control}} systems, which included computerized damage control to automatically isolate damaged areas. With the nacelles pointing {{straight up in}} conversion mode at 90° the flight computers command the aircraft to fly like a helicopter, with cyclic forces being applied to a conventional swashplate at the rotor hub. With the nacelles in airplane mode (0°) the flaperons, rudder, and elevator fly similar to an airplane. This is a gradual transition, occurring over the nacelles' rotation range; the lower the nacelles, the greater effect of the airplane-mode control surfaces. The nacelles can rotate past vertical to 97.5° for rearward flight. The V-22 can use the [...] "80 Jump" [...] orientation with the nacelles at 80° for takeoff to quickly achieve high altitude and speed. The control systems automate and simplify {{to the extent that}} the V-22 can hover in low wind with no hands on the controls. According to <b>some</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> flown the aircraft, former fixed-wing pilots may be preferable over helicopter ones as they are not trained to constantly adjust the controls while hovering.|$|E

2500|$|Interest in {{the latter}} part of the 20th century would be {{concentrated}} among academics, collector/“experts” and tourists. Among the artisans themselves, there has been some movement since the 1970s to break from the tradition of anonymity to having the individual’s talents recognized as artists. <b>Some</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> managed to do this include Roberto Ruiz, who specializes in works made from bone, Teresa Nava who makes maquettes, Teodoro Torres who makes lead figures and many more.

2500|$|In 1916, while {{observing a}} 14-year-old Bobby Jones, Travis is {{reported}} to have commented that Jones' putting methods were [...] "faulty". [...] There are accounts that suggest that young Jones held Travis in high esteem and eagerly agreed to meet Travis the following morning at 8 am for a putting lesson. [...] Unfortunately, Jones and his party awoke late and were over an hour behind schedule. [...] When they arrived, Travis had left. The lesson did not occur until years later, when Travis suggested a change in Jones's grip, altered his stance and recommended a longer and more sweeping stroke. A key point was to try to [...] "drive an imaginary tack {{into the back of the}} ball". [...] There are <b>some</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> expressed the opinion that the Travis putting lesson helped Jones to become one of the great putters of all time.|$|E
2500|$|Even in 2007, at {{the tenth}} {{anniversary of the}} massacre, members of Las Abejas {{reported}} {{that some of the}} killers have not been brought to justice. [...] Diego Perez Jimenez, then president of Las Abejas, expressed his frustration with those who claim that justice has already been served, or that <b>some</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> been prosecuted ought not to be imprisoned: [...] "They tell so many lies," [...] he says. [...] "These guys in jails were killers, and there are more killers out there. [...] That's the truth," [...] he insists. [...] Many of those imprisoned, however, insist that they are not guilty, such as Agostin Gomez Perez, who has been imprisoned for more than a decade. [...] "What happened in Acteal is very sad," [...] he says, [...] "But I wasn't involved in it. [...] I didn't kill a soul." [...] Some human rights groups say that many of the arrested have been innocent scapegoats, and that successive governments have protected the real perpetrators and the masterminds behind the massacre.|$|E
2500|$|However, visuo-spatial {{short-term}} memory can retain visual and/or spatial information over brief periods of time. [...] When this memory is in use, individuals {{are able to}} momentarily create and revisit a mental image that can be manipulated in complex or difficult tasks of spatial orientation.There are <b>some</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> disparities {{in the areas of}} the brain that allow for this to happen from different types of brain damage. There can also be a misunderstanding here in the differences between transient memories such as the visual sensory memory. A transient memory is merely a fleeting type of sensory memory. [...] Therefore, as the visual sensory memory is a type or sensory memory, there is a store for the information, but the store last for only a second or so. [...] A common effect of the visual sensory memory is that individuals may remember seeing things that weren't really there or not remembering particular things that were in their line of sight. [...] The memory is only momentary, and if it isn't attended to within a matter of seconds, it is gone.|$|E
