40|$|Study on {{richness}} {{diversity and}} potential <b>species</b> <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> in two {{locations in the}} Buton Utara Game Reserve had been conducted. One hundred and seventy nine <b>species</b> <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> are collected from this area, and 137 <b>species</b> <b>of</b> them are reported as the potential <b>of</b> <b>species.</b> The largest group is timber (76 species) {{and the other is}} medicinal plants (41 species).

5|$|The {{park has}} sub-Himalayan belt {{geographical}} and ecological characteristics.

5|$|Because of the {{presence}} of auxins in Lactifluus piperatus metabolites, it can be applied as a rooting hormone to aid the growth of seedlings of various <b>species</b> <b>of</b> <b>plants,</b> including hazel, beech and oak. In the 19th century, it was used as a folk cure for tuberculosis, though it had no effect. In more recent times, it has been found that L. piperatus can be used as an antiviral agent, and the latex has been used against viral warts.|$|E
5|$|Butterflies feed {{primarily}} on nectar from flowers. Some also derive nourishment from pollen, tree sap, rotting fruit, dung, decaying flesh, and dissolved minerals in wet sand or dirt. Butterflies are important as pollinators for some <b>species</b> <b>of</b> <b>plants.</b> In general, {{they do not}} carry as much pollen load as bees, but {{they are capable of}} moving pollen over greater distances. Flower constancy has been observed for at least one species of butterfly.|$|E

5|$|Chad's {{animal and}} plant life {{correspond}} to the three climatic zones. In the Saharan region, the only flora is the date-palm groves of the oasis. Palms and acacia trees grow in the Sahelian region. The southern, or Sudanic, zone consists of broad grasslands or prairies suitable for grazing. As of 2002, {{there were at least}} 134 species of mammals, 509 species of birds (354 species of residents and 155 migrants), and over 1,600 <b>species</b> <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> throughout the country.|$|E

5|$|Darjeeling {{is a part}} of the Eastern Himalayan zoo-geographic zone. Flora around Darjeeling {{comprises}} sal, oak, semi-evergreen, temperate and alpine forests. Dense evergreen {{forests of}} sal and oak lie around the town, where a wide variety of rare orchids are found. The Lloyd's Botanical Garden preserves common and rare <b>species</b> <b>of</b> <b>plants,</b> while the Padmaja Naidu Himalayan Zoological Park specialises in conserving and breeding endangered Himalayan species. The town of Darjeeling and surrounding region face deforestation due to increasing demand for wood fuel and timber, as well as air pollution from increasing vehicular traffic.|$|E

5|$|In the wild, the diets of Campbell's dwarf hamsters vary {{across the}} {{population}} range. A total of 51 different <b>species</b> <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> were identified {{to be consumed}} by the Transbaikalia population, the most common being Stipa capillata and species of Allium. However, in Tuva, only 10 species of plant were identified to be consumed by the population, the most common being Potentilla.

5|$|Since {{classical}} {{times and}} possibly much earlier, hundreds of <b>species</b> <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> have provided drugs {{to treat a}} wide range of conditions. Dioscorides's De Materia Medica, written by 70 AD, listed some 600 medicinal plants and around 1000 drugs made from them, including substances known to be effective such as aconite, aloes, colocynth, colchicum, henbane, opium and squill. The book remained a standard reference for nearly two thousand years, and was the basis of the European pharmacopoeia {{until the end of the}} 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Svalbard has {{permafrost}} and tundra, {{with both}} low, {{middle and high}} Arctic vegetation. 165 <b>species</b> <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> have been found on the archipelago. Only those areas which defrost in the summer have vegetations, which accounts for about 10% of the archipelago. Vegetation is most abundant in Nordenskiöld Land, around Isfjorden and where affected by guano. While there is little precipitation, giving the archipelago a steppe climate, plants still have good access to water because the cold climate reduces evaporation. The growing season is very short, and may last only a few weeks.|$|E

5|$|The {{dominant}} {{vegetation cover}} of coastal sage scrub typically goes through approximately 25-year cycles, with its peak biodiversity reached in roughly 10 {{years after the}} beginning of a new 25-year period. Such periods are typically separated by wildfires, which clear away dead or dying vegetation and leave bare ground for new growth. The canyon is one of the last remaining sanctuaries for many plants native to Southern California. Approximately one hundred <b>species</b> <b>of</b> <b>plants,</b> most native to California, are found in Laurel and Willow Canyons alone. These include monkey flower, goldenrod, and sagebrush.|$|E
5|$|The {{eastern area}} of Birbhum {{is a part}} of the rice plains of West Bengal, and the {{vegetation}} includes usual characteristics of rice fields in Bengal, such as species of Aponogeton, Utricularia, Drosera, Philcoxia, Scrophulariaceae and similar aquatic or palustrine genera. In the drier western region of the district, the characteristic shrubs and herbs include species of Wendlandia, Convolvulaceae, Stipa, Tragus, Spermacoce, Ziziphus, Capparis and similar plants that grows on laterite soil.
