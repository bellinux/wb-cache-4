If true economic depreciation is <b>stochastic,</b> <b>pro</b> fit taxes with expected-value depreciation allowances decrease risk-taking. However, if real capital is used {{only in the}} risky sector, more generous depreciation allowances increase risk-taking. It is also shown that the incentive effect of risk-taking-revenue taxes to increase the risky fraction of investment is stronger {{in the case of}} more generous depreciation allowances.

40|$|Gravity theory {{missed a}} key {{dynamical}} process that became ap parent only when ex- pressed {{in terms of}} a velocity field, instead of the Newtonian gravitational acceleration field. This dynamical process involves an additional self-i nteraction of the dynam- ical 3 -space, and experimental data reveals that its streng th is set by the fine struc- ture constant, implying a fundamental link between gravity and quantum theory. The dynamical 3 -space has been directly detected in numerous li ght-speed anisotropy ex- periments. Quantum matter has been shown to exhibit an accel eration caused by the time-dependence and inhomogeneity of the 3 -space flow, givi ng the first derivation of gravity from a deeper theory, as a quantum wave refraction effect. EM radiation is also refracted in a similar manner. The anisotropy experiments have all shown 3 -space wave / turbulence effects, with the latest revealing the fractal structure of 3 -s pace. Here we report the prediction of a new effect, namely a reverberation effect, when the gravi- tational waves propagate in the 3 -space inflow of a large mass. This effect arises from the non-linear dynamics of 3 -space. These reverberations c ould offer an explanation for the Shnoll effect, in which cosmological factors influence <b>stochastic</b> <b>pro</b> cesses, such as radioactive decay rates...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of {{quantization}} {{on the performance of}} the Neyman-Pearson test. It is assumed that a sensing unit observes samples of a correlated stationary ergodic multivariate process. Each sample is passed through an N-point quantizer and transmitted to a decision device which performs a binary hypothesis test. For any false alarm level, it is shown that the miss probability of the Neyman-Pearson test converges to zero exponentially as the number of samples tends to infinity, assuming that the observed process satisfies certain mixing conditions. The main contribution {{of this paper is to}} provide a compact closed-form expression of the error exponent in the high-rate regime i. e., when the number N of quantization levels tends to infinity, generalizing previous results of Gupta and Hero to the case of non-independent observations. If d represents the dimension of one sample, it is proved that the error exponent converges at rate N 2 /d to the one obtained in the absence of quantization. As an application, relevant high-rate quantization strategies which lead to a large error exponent are determined. Numerical results indicate that the proposed quantization rule can yield better performance than existing ones in terms of detection error.
