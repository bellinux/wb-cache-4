40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{methods to}} {{institute}} a sustainable <b>safety</b> <b>inspection</b> system for extent multiple dwellings in Korea are presented.

First, {{on the basis of a}} study on the <b>safety</b> <b>inspection</b> systems for multiple dwellings in Japan and the United States, the state of the <b>safety</b> <b>inspection</b> systems and the policies for multiple dwellings in Korea is examined. Subsequently, the weaknesses of the Korean <b>safety</b> <b>inspection</b> systems and the need to revise them are discussed. Second, the housing circumstances in Korea, Japan, and the United States are analyzed and compared, including laws on <b>safety</b> <b>inspection</b> for multiple dwellings, targets and items of inspection, qualifications for inspection, building history systems, and qualified professionals for <b>safety</b> <b>inspection.</b> On the basis of the analysis and comparison, the differences between the systems of the three nations and the issues that need to be introduced in Korea are presented. Third, based on the <b>safety</b> <b>inspection</b> experiences in Japan and the United States, new directions of <b>safety</b> <b>inspection</b> and methods to enhance current systems for multiple dwellings in Korea are proposed...|$|R

5|$|Initially, {{forecasts}} {{from the}} JMA and Korea Meteorological Administration indicated that Bolaven would strike {{the country at}} an intensity {{greater than that of}} the nation's worst typhoon disaster in decades: Typhoon Rusa in 2002. On August27, nearly all of South Korea was placed under a typhoon warning as the storm approached. The state disaster relief board went to its highest alert level prior to the storm's arrival. More than 400 flights were canceled across the country, including 109 international flights from Incheon International Airport. The majority of cancellations were domestic flights, mainly from Ningbo to Jeju Island. Local authorities conducted <b>safety</b> <b>inspections</b> of areas prone to landslides and closed off beaches and seawalls. Residents in flood-prone areas were encouraged to evacuate for their own safety as well. Along the coast, hundreds of ships sought refuge from rough seas in various harbors and ports. Numerous ports banned sea travel and shut down activities by August27, and 68 of the nation's 87 ferry routes were canceled. In Busan, all ships were not allowed access to the docks until the typhoon's passage.|$|E
5|$|In {{the buildup}} to the game, the Welsh manager Mike England was unhappy {{that the game}} was to be played at Ninian Park in Cardiff instead of the Racecourse Ground in Wrexham. Wales at the time had an {{excellent}} record at the Racecourse, both in qualifying tournaments for the World Cup and European Championships, and in the British Home Championship. During the early 1970s, Wrexham had embarked on making significant improvements to the Racecourse, with two new stands built and a new roof installed over the Kop End. Ninian Park however had had its capacity cut {{as a result of}} various <b>safety</b> <b>inspections</b> until improvements were made. The smaller capacity of the Racecourse additionally meant that home games were more likely to sell out. This had led to the FAW choosing the Racecourse {{for the majority of the}} national team's home games from 1977 onwards. Before the game against Scotland, Wales had played twenty home games since the beginning of 1980, with eight each of those played at Cardiff and Wrexham. Of those, Wales had won 6 and drawn 2, including two wins against England, and the 3–0 victory over Spain earlier in the qualifying tournament at the Racecourse, while they had won 3, drawn 2 and lost 3 at Ninian Park. However, in spite of Wales' exceptional record at the Racecourse, the interest in the game led to the FAW to name the larger Ninian Park as the venue.|$|E

5|$|Chennai {{was officially}} {{declared}} a disaster {{area on the}} evening of 2 December. At the MIOT Hospital, 14 patients died after power and oxygen supplies failed. With a letup in rainfall, floodwaters gradually began to recede in Chennai on 4 December, though 40 percent of the city's districts remained submerged and safe food and drinking water remained in short supply. Though relief efforts were well underway across most of the area by 3 December, the lack of any coordinated relief response in North Chennai forced thousands of its residents to evacuate on their own. As intermittent rains returned, thousands of displaced residents from Chennai, Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur districts attempted to flee the stricken region by bus or train and travel to their family homes. Chennai International Airport was partly reopened for cargo flights on 5 December, with passenger flights scheduled to resume from the following morning. By 6 December, rescue efforts had largely concluded and relief efforts intensified, with the Chennai Corporation beginning to disburse relief packages. Mobile, banking and power services were gradually restored; fuel and food supplies were reaching their destinations, the airport had fully reopened and rail services slowly resumed. Many city neighbourhoods, however, remained flooded with some lacking basic necessities due to the uncoordinated distribution of relief materials. With the city slowly beginning to recover, state and national health officials remained watchful against disease outbreaks, warning that conditions were right for epidemics of water-borne illnesses to occur. Chennai Corporation officials reported at least 57,000 homes in the city had suffered structural damage, mostly those of working class pincodes. State housing boards said they would conduct <b>safety</b> <b>inspections</b> of both public and residential buildings. After being closed for the past month, schools and colleges across the affected districts began to reopen from 14 December. Relief operations were largely wound up by 19 December.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSES: This {{study is}} to analyze {{expected}} effect of a accident decrease when motorcycle <b>safety</b> <b>inspection</b> is introduced. METHODS: Based on the literature review of effect of 4 -wheel vehicle inspection, probability of occurring accidents among defective motorcycles are calculated by using the number of estimated defective motorcycles and accidents resulting from defects of motorcycles. Then, the number of decreased accidents which is resulting from eliminating defects of motorcycles by <b>safety</b> <b>inspection</b> is estimated by using probability of occurring accidents among defective motorcycles. RESULTS: If the ratio of eliminating defects of motorcycles is 95 % after motorcycle <b>safety</b> <b>inspection,</b> the effects of accident decrease of motorcycle <b>safety</b> <b>inspection</b> are analyzed from 2005 to 2008. As a result, 46, 292 defective motorcycles are repaired and 1, 376 accidents are prevented when the probability of occurring accidents among defective motorcycles is 2. 97 %. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests the expected effect of motorcycle <b>safety</b> <b>inspection</b> is that the inspection can prevent 1, 376 motorcycle accidents. However, the number of preventing motorcycle accidents are small, compared with {{the total number of}} motorcycle accidents because there are limitations to investigate the causes of defective motorcycle accidents.
