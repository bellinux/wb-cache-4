40|$|A {{method and}} {{apparatus}} for measuring thermally induced warpage in test {{elements such as}} <b>printed</b> <b>wiring</b> boards and <b>printed</b> <b>wiring</b> assemblies, including a heating chamber having a transparent window and support structure for supporting a <b>printing</b> <b>wiring</b> board in an observation orientation and position parallel to the transparent window. A glass grating placed adjacent the window and a light source shines through the window onto the <b>printed</b> <b>wiring</b> board under test. A camera is positioned for capturing images of shadow moire fringes formed over time as the oven heats up the <b>printed</b> <b>wiring</b> board or <b>printed</b> <b>wiring</b> assembly to simulate actual process conditions. A computer is used for controlling operation of the apparatus and for evaluating the captured images of the moire fringes {{in relation to the}} temperature as a function of time.

The signal-conditioning electronics are disposed on a <b>printed</b> <b>wiring</b> board, which is assembled with another <b>printed</b> <b>wiring</b> board including the sensor windings to provide a sub-assembly. A mu-metal shield is interposed between the <b>printed</b> <b>wiring</b> boards to prevent magnetic interference. The sub-assembly is disposed in the sensor housing adjacent to an inductor board which turns on a shaft. The inductor board emanates an internally or externally generated excitation signal that induces a signal in the sensor windings. The induced signal represents the rotary position of the inductor board relative to the sensor winding board...|$|R
