5|$|Beginning in the mid-6th century, as Buddhism {{was brought}} to Japan from Baekje, new styles of shrine {{architecture}} were introduced; today's Shinto shrine blueprint is of Buddhist origin. The concept of temples {{as a place of}} assembly was applied to shrines. <b>Spaces</b> <b>for</b> worship were added in the form of extended roofs or worship halls (haiden) in addition to the main hall (honden). The following stylistic elements of Buddhist temple architecture were assimilated and applied to Japanese shrines: column-base stones, brackets, curved roofs, painted surfaces, metal ornaments, corridors and pagodas.|$|E
5|$|In the past, the baths {{served as}} {{community}} <b>spaces</b> <b>for</b> gay men. Even now, some men {{choose to go}} to the baths with their friends (even though they may not necessarily have sex with each other). While many men talk to each other at the baths, even forming long-lasting friendships or relationships, many others do not, preferring, for various reasons, anonymity.|$|E
5|$|Like the {{fundamental}} group or the higher homotopy groups of a space, homology groups are important topological invariants. Although some (co)homology theories are computable using tools of linear algebra, many other important (co)homology theories, especially singular (co)homology, are not computable directly from their definition for nontrivial <b>spaces.</b> <b>For</b> singular (co)homology, the singular (co)chains and (co)cycles groups are often {{too big to}} handle directly. More subtle and indirect approaches become necessary. The Mayer–Vietoris sequence is such an approach, giving partial information about the (co)homology groups of any space by relating it to the (co)homology groups of two of its subspaces and their intersection.|$|E

5|$|Queen Mary 2 {{is not a}} {{steamship}} {{like many}} of her predecessors, but is powered primarily by four diesel engines, with two additional gas turbines used when extra power is required; this integrated electric propulsion configuration is used to produce the power to drive her four electric propulsion pods as well as powering the ship's hotel services.

5|$|Several inner-city neighborhoods {{have begun}} to gentrify in recent years. Areas on both the west side (Ohio City, Tremont, Detroit-Shoreway, and Edgewater) and the east side (Collinwood, Hough, Fairfax, and Little Italy) have been {{successful}} in attracting increasing numbers of creative class members, which in turn is spurring new residential development.

5|$|The Malé Friday Mosque is {{oriented}} west. Its prayer carpet is angled {{towards the}} mosque's northwest corner, so worshippers can face Mecca while they pray.

5|$|The {{network has}} over 390 artworks by over 170 artists across its stations, ranging from {{historic}} murals to modern art.

Many stations {{are decorated with}} intricate ceramic tile work, some of which date back to 1913 when the Underground first opened its doors. Featured artists include painters and reproductions by Quino, Molina Campos, Raúl Soldi, Rodolfo Medina and Jorge Schwarz. In addition, they provide <b>spaces</b> <b>for</b> music and theatre events, including an underground iteration of the Pepsi Music Festival on Line H.|$|E
5|$|Women and men {{religious}} {{engage in}} a variety of occupations, from contemplative prayer, to teaching, to providing health care, to working as missionaries. While Holy Orders are reserved for men, Catholic women have played diverse roles {{in the life of the}} church, with religious institutes providing a formal space for their participation and convents providing <b>spaces</b> <b>for</b> their self-government, prayer and influence through many centuries. Religious sisters and nuns have been extensively involved in developing and running the Church's worldwide health and education service networks.|$|E

5|$|Centralized {{buildings}} of circular or octagonal plan also became used for baptistries and reliquaries {{due to the}} suitability of those shapes for assembly around a single object. Baptisteries began {{to be built in}} the manner of domed mausolea during the 4th century in Italy. The octagonal Lateran Baptistery or the baptistery of the Holy Sepulchre may have been the first, and the style spread during the 5th century. The Church of the Holy Apostles, or Apostoleion, probably planned by Constantine but built by his successor Constantius in the new capital city of Constantinople, combined the congregational basilica with the centralized shrine. With a similar plan to that of the Church of Saint Simeon Stylites, four naves projected from a central rotunda containing Constantine's tomb and <b>spaces</b> <b>for</b> the tombs of the twelve Apostles. Above the center may have been a clerestory with a wooden dome roofed with bronze sheeting and gold accents.|$|E
5|$|In 1988 Regalian Properties {{purchased}} the site, and appointed Terry Farrell as architect.

Regalian disliked the proposals and requested Farrell design a single large office block. Despite containing 50% more office space than the rejected Green Giant proposal, the design was accepted. The government then bought {{the site and}} design as a future headquarters for the Secret Intelligence Service, and the design was accordingly modified to increase security. In 1995 the SIS Building was opened on the site, and today dominates other buildings {{in the vicinity of}} the bridge.|$|E
