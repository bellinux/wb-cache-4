The studies were carried out on 104 bulls fattened from 120 days of life until the weight of 500 kg. The bulls were group fed using mainly farm feeds. After slaughter the carcasses were dissected and meat was subjected to physico-chemical and organoleptic analyses. The obtained data were used for the development of an artifi cial neural network model of <b>slaughter</b> <b>value</b> prediction. It was found that some <b>slaughter</b> <b>value</b> traits (hot carcass, cold half-carcass, neck and round weights, bone content in dissected elements in half-carcass, meat pH, dry-matter and protein contents in meat and meat tenderness and juiciness) can be predicted with a considerably high accuracy using the artifi cial neural network...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} was the {{comparison}} of <b>slaughter</b> <b>value</b> and muscle properties of dual-purpose cattle most common in Poland with that of beef type, from which high quality culinary meat is obtained. Four breeds were compared: {{two of them were}} dual-purpose type i. e. Holstein-Fresian of Black and White variety and Polish Red and the other two – of beef type i. e. Limousine and Hereford. There are discussed factors influencing cattle <b>slaughter</b> <b>value</b> and muscle properties, i. e. the impact of the utility type, gender, age, feeding systems, as well as maturation rate of animals. The <b>slaughter</b> <b>value</b> was presented using the dressing percentage and the content of main components in the carcass i. e. the muscle tissue, fat and bones. The tissue composition of analysed cattle breeds and the share of main cuts in their carcasses were presented. Higher daily gains of beef type or dual-purpose breeds are connected with a higher number of muscle fibers (hyperplasia) and also with a bigger size of their diameter (hypertrophy). These phenomena are accompanied by increased lightness of meat colour what is the result of changes in the muscle fibers metabolism and the proportion of myosin heavy chains (MHC) of the I, IIa and IIx type. Observed differences in the <b>slaughter</b> <b>value</b> existed not only between breeds, but also inside them indicating the need for further improvement of animal selection and deeper analysis of factors influencing it. It was stated that the amount of culinary meat obtained from carcasses may be increased not only through the selection of corresponding genotypes, but also through the modification of the system of carcass cutting. The performed analysis of the <b>slaughter</b> <b>value</b> emphasizes special significance of the domestic Polish Red cattle also as a breed for production of good quality meat similar to beef cattle breeds...|$|E

40|$|A dynamic {{probabilistic}} PC-model is used {{to compare}} six management strategies on reproduction and replacement in sow herds. The model uses the Markov chain approach to simulate herd dynamics, and derives from that technical and economic results of the herd. Under the circumstances studied, strategies based {{on the use of}} an economic culling index I and II, including age and productive history of individual sows, are the best. In the basic situation annual culling rate (CR) amounts to 47. 4 % and gross margin per sow per year (GM) Dfl. 1086. Economic differences between strategies depend mainly on realised differences in CR. Strategies that refer to guidelines given by extension service lead to an increase in CR (plus 5 – 6 %) and a decrease in GM (minus Dfl. 15). The most strict strategy (no reinseminations) achieved the highest CR (24. 5 %) and the lowest GM (minus Dfl. 62). A very liberal strategy, allowing in all cases 4 inseminations, resulted in almost the same results as strategies I and II.

The study was carried on 276 offspring of hyperprolific sows. The sows gave birth to at least 12 live-born piglets. On the first day after birth, litters were equalised to 12 piglets in litter. The body weight was examined on the 21 st (21 BW), 28 th (28 BW), 63 rd (63 BW) and 180 th (180 BW) days of life. During evaluation, the live average daily gain (LADG) from birth to day 180 of life and the average daily gain (ADG) from day 63 to day 180 of life were determined. The percentage meat content (PMC), backfat thickness (BFT) and loin eye thickness (LET) was determined using PIGLOG 105 ultrasound apparatus. Two alleles of the RYR 1 gene (RYR 1 C, RYR 1 T) and three genotypes (C/C, C/T and T/T) were identified. The 21 BW and 28 BW of the T/T genotype were significantly lower than that of the C/C and C/T.

40|$|Title of the paper: <b>Slaughter</b> <b>value</b> {{and meat}} quality of Skudde lambs The {{investigations}} {{were conducted on}} 100 -day-old lambs of the Skudde breed and were aimed at determining the <b>slaughter</b> <b>value</b> of lambs and quality of their meat. The <b>slaughter</b> <b>value</b> was evaluated based on: body weight before slaughter, dressing percentage, loin »eye« area, perinephric fat content, contribution of valuable cuts in the carcass (leg, loin, steak) and tissue composition of legs. In turn, meat quality was assessed based on samples collected from the muscle of the thigh (M. quadriceps femoris) and included: dry matter, total protein, crude fat, crude ash, pH after 24 h, water/protein index, energy value, water holding capacity, colour brightness, muscle fibre diameter, levels of cholesterol, vitamin A and E, protein amino acid profile, fatty acid composition of intramuscular fat, as well as sensory attributes, namely: aroma, taste, juiciness and tenderness. Analyses conducted in the study demonstrated that the <b>slaughter</b> <b>value</b> of the lambs was at a relatively good level. A low body weight before slaughter (12. 56 kg) was compensated for by very low adiposity of carcasses and by a favourable tissue composition of legs, i. e. 76. 38 % of meat, 5. 68 % of fat and 17. 94 % of bones. Dressing percentage accounted for 44. 03 %, {{and the percentage of}} primal cuts in the half-carcass was 38. 77 %. Meat of the 100 -day-old Skudde lambs was found to be of high quality. It was characterized by dark colour and specific sensory attributes, which makes it comparable to game meat. Low contents of fat – 1. 56 % and cholesterol – 34. 47 mg/ 100 g, a high concentration of vitamin A – 5. 25 μg/g as well as a favourable fatty acid profile of intramuscular fat indicate high health-promoting values of that meat. In addition, the finefibrous structure of muscles (fibre diameter of 17. 24 μm) suggests that the meat is light and easy digestible.

Spermidine content significantly (P ≤ 0. 01) increased from 2. 04 to 9. 91 mg. kg- 1 and spermine significantly increased (P ≤ 0. 05) from 20. 05 to 48. 27 mg. kg- 1 on the 21 th day of the experiment...|$|R
40|$|A model {{analyzing}} {{the economics of}} sheep farming is formulated. The basic idea is simple. Sheep are capital and they are held by farmers {{as long as their}} capital <b>value</b> exceeds their <b>slaughter,</b> or meat, <b>value.</b> Farmers are therefore portfolio managers aiming to find the optimal combination of different categories of animals. Yields are compared with the yields from other assets. The model is formulated within a Northern Scandinavian economic and biological setting with a crucial distinction between the outdoors grazing season and the indoors season, and with adult sheep and lambs being different categories. In the first step, the management problem is analyzed with only the meat income of the farmers taken into account. In the next step, income from wool production is considered as well. The analysis provides several results that differ from standard harvesting theory. Copyright 2008 International Association of Agricultural Economists. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the performance of multiple imputation method in case that missing observation structure is at random and completely at random from the approach of general linear mixed model. The application data of study was consisted of a total 77 heads of Norduz ram lambs at 7 months of age. After <b>slaughtering,</b> pH <b>values</b> measured at five different time points were determined as dependent variable. In addition, hot carcass weight, muscle glycogen level and fasting durations were included as independent variables in the model. In the dependent variable without missing observation, two missing observation structures including Missing Completely at Random (MCAR) and Missing at Random (MAR) were created by deleting the observations at certain rations (10 % and 25 %). After that, in data sets that have missing observation structure, complete data sets were obtained using MI (multiple imputation). The results obtained by applying general linear mixed model to the data sets that were completed using MI method were compared to the results regarding complete data. In the mixed model which was applied to the complete data and MI data sets, results whose covariance structures were the same and parameter estimations and standard estimations were rather close to the complete data are obtained. As a result, in this study, it was ensured that reliable information was obtained in mixed model in case of choosing MI as imputation method in missing observation structure and rates of both cases...|$|R
