The obtained mechanical parameters were correlated with laboratory measured parameters such as plasticity index, density, shear strength and compressibility and, GPR and seismic profiles were correlated with the mapped fracture systems in the study area. Once calibrated, the profiles allowed to identify the lithological contact between lacustrine and volcanic sequences, their variations of thicknesses in depth and to assess the deformation area in the surface.

40|$|The use of seismic {{methods in}} hard rock environments in Western Australia for mineral {{exploration}} {{is a new}} and burgeoning technology. Traditionally, mineral exploration has relied upon potential field methods and <b>surface</b> <b>prospecting</b> to reveal shallow targets for economic exploitation. These methods have been {{and will continue to}} be effective but lack lateral and depth resolution needed to image deeper mineral deposits for targeted mining. With global need for minerals, and gold in particular, increasing in demand, and with shallower targets harder to find, new methods to uncover deeper mineral reserves are needed. Seismic reflection imaging, hard rock borehole data analysis, seismic inversion and seismic attribute analysis all give the spatial and volumetric exploration techniques the mineral industry can use to reveal high value deeper mineral targets. In 2002, two high resolution seismic lines, the East Victory and Intrepid, were acquired along with sonic logging, to assess the feasibility of seismic imaging and rock characterisation at the St. Ives gold camp in Western Australia. An innovative research project was undertaken combining seismic processing, rock characterization, reflection calibration, seismic inversion and seismic attribute analysis to show that volumetric predictions of rock type and gold-content may be viable in hard rock environments. Accurate seismic imaging and reflection identification proved to be challenging but achievable task in the all-out hard rock environment of the Yilgarn craton. Accurate results were confounded by crocked seismic line acquisition, low signal-to-noise ratio, regolith distortions, small elastic property variations in the rock, and a limited volume of sonic logging. Each of these challenges, however, did have a systematic solution which allowed for accurate results to be achieved. Seismic imaging was successfully completed on both the East Victory and Intrepid data sets revealing complex structures in the Earth as shallow as 100 metres to as deep as 3000 metres. The successful imaging required homogenization of the regolith to eliminate regolith travel-time distortions and accurate constant velocity analysis for reflection focusing using migration. Verification of the high amplitude reflections within each image was achieved through integration of surface geological and underground mine data as well as calibration with log derived synthetic seismograms. The most accurate imaging results were ultimately achieved on the East Victory line which had good signal-to-noise ratio and close-to-straight data acquisition direction compared to the more crooked Intrepid seismic line. The sonic logs from both the East Victory and Intrepid seismic lines were comprehensively analysed by re-sampling and separating the data based on rock type, structure type, alteration type, and Au assay. Cross plotting of the log data revealed statistically accurate separation between harder and softer rocks, as well as sheared and un-sheared rock, were possible based solely on compressional-wave, shear-wave, density, acoustic and elastic impedance. These results were used successfully to derive empirical relationships between seismic attributes and geology. Calibrations of the logs and seismic data provided proof that reflections, especially high-amplitude reflections, correlated well with certain rock properties as expected from the sonic data, including high gold content sheared zones. The correlation value, however, varied with signal-to-noise ratio and crookedness of the seismic line. Subsequent numerical modelling confirmed that separating soft from hard rocks can be based on both general reflectivity pattern and impedance contrasts. Indeed impedance inversions on the calibrated seismic and sonic data produced reliable volumetric separations between harder rocks (basalt and dolerite) and softer rock (intermediate intrusive, mafic, and volcaniclastic). Acoustic impedance inversions produced the most statistically valid volumetric predictions with the simultaneous use of acoustic and elastic inversions producing stable separation of softer and harder rocks zones. Similarly, Lambda-Mu-Rho inversions showed good separations between softer and harder rock zones. With high gold content rock associated more with “softer” hard rocks and sheared zones, these volumetric inversion provide valuable information for targeted mining. The geostatistical method applied to attribute analysis, however, was highly ambiguous due to low correlations and thus produced overly generalized predictions. Overall reliability of the seismic inversion results were based on quality and quantity of sonic data leaving the East Victory data set, again with superior results as compared to the Intrepid data set. In general, detailed processing and analysis of the 2 D seismic data and the study of the relationship between the recorded wave-field and rock properties measured from borehole logs, core samples and open cut mining, revealed that positive correlations can be developed between the two. The results of rigorous research show that rock characterization using seismic methodology will greatly benefit the mineral industry...|$|E

40|$|The {{objects of}} “Neolithic plastic art” from Belica, made from baked clay, stone and bone, have been {{arriving}} at the Regional Museum in Jagodina since 1991. These are accidental finds which never {{caught the attention of}} experts, even though one of them, a figurine from black rock which arrived at the museum in 1992, {{has been a part of}} a permanent exhibition. Almost two decades after its arrival at the museum, the archaeologist Dr Milorad Stojić would place it among the most substantial finds of Neolithic figural plastic, identifying it as the Proto-Starčevo culture, dated to 6000 years BC and named it the “Great Mother”, linking her to the Neolithic cult of fertility (Stojić 2011, 344) Asignificantly greater number of objects from Belica since 2001, first as accidental finds by Života Milanović, an associate of the Regional Museum in Jagodina, arrived to Dr Milorad Stojić who undertook a one-day protective intervention at the site of Pojate-Pojilo in Belica village, the exact area from which previously collected finds originated. Ashort excavation, which was “less than two full hours of work” (according to the Report of the excavation), was carried out in January 2002. On that occasion a pit, which was only 10 cm deep and located on the surface of the village dirt road, was investigated (fig. 1). The excavation, together with the appropriate technical documentation, has not yet been published. The discovered pit was located in the middle of the dirt road which was used by agricultural machinery and which had, on several occasions prior to the exploration in 2002, been repaired by heavy construction machinery. In the years following 2003, two more groups of finds of art objects from the Early Neolithic were discovered in Belica and Lozovik (Stojić 2008, 73). In the Livade site in Belica, which is 500 m from the site of Pojate-Pojilo, four objects made of stone were found. In Lozovik, in the Repuška site, three figurines made of deer bone were discovered. In both sites the finds of the aforementioned objects were followed, according to the author, by finds of Proto- Starčevo ceramics. More detailed descriptions of the locations, conditions of discovery and subsequent finds do not exist. In August 2003, within the usual activities of the project Permanent Archaeological Workshop - Central Pomoravlje in Neolithisation of South East Europe, under the supervision of S. Perić, in the Pojate-Pojilo site in Belica, some sondage excavation was performed. One of the reasons this precise location was chosen for exploration was that stone plastic finds are attributed to it, for which there are no suitable analogies within the Middle or Late Neolithic Starčevo culture. Two sondages of 5 x 5 m (fig. 2) were explored. The results of the exploration were modest, which was in accordance with expectations based on several visits made to all three Neolithic sites in Belica village. One smaller Late Neolithic settlement from the Proto-Starčevo period existed on this location. In conclusion, it should be mentioned that none of the finds from this exploration could be connected to the accidental finds of stone plastic from the village road even though, during the time of the exploration, daily <b>surface</b> <b>prospecting</b> of this and the two neighbouring Neolithic sites was carried out. A detailed inspection of the profile, which is cut by the village road where it is believed that there was a Neolithic pit of about 1 m in depth, was also performed. The village road, as we originally found it, worn out and uneven, with around twenty centimetre deep tracks made by tractor wheels and with no clods of turf on it, didn’t leave the impression that an only 10 cm deep bottom of a pit could be preserved (fig. 3). The objects discovered in the pit explored in 2002 include: 60 stone, 9 ceramic and 11 bone and deer horn objects. Within this number are also included the objects found in 2001 in the immediate vicinity of the pit (Stojić 2011, 341 - 342). The most numerous are anthropomorphic figurines, and besides them there are several examples of sacrificial altars, conical objects (pintadera), axe figurines and one rectangular plate. Ceramic figurines from Belica, which in their form resemble the Palaeolithic Venus figurines, were made from insufficiently refined soil, which is a practice completely opposite to the one noticed on the figurines from the other Neolithic sites of the Central Balkans. The soil from which they were made resembles that used for making rough ceramics or for building houses (daub). Therefore, our doubt that we are dealing here with figurines which resulted from the mechanical treatment of already baked soil, and not with objects which got their final form in raw clay prior to baking, is not surprising. The same is true with bone objects in which subsequent work is visible on a piece of bone which remained in the ground for a number of centuries. By courtesy of Dr Milorad Stojić, an archaeologist to whom Života Milanović, the sole discoverer of these objects, was bringing finds from Belica, and who was digging the pit with the group of art objects finds, the authors of this paper had an opportunity to thoroughly microscopically examine several stone and bone objects from Belica (the Pojate-Pojilo and Livade sites) and from Lozovik (the Repuška site). Specifically, we are talking about five stone and four bone objects (fig. 4). The examination of traces of the treatment on the surface of these objects clearly showed that we are dealing with objects which had been mechanically treated by grinding tools spinning at a large number of rotations per minute. The results of this kind of treatment are fine, narrow, uninterrupted parallel grooves (fig. 5 - 10). After manual treatment with a grindstone of natural sandstone or by using only sand, only short grooves, which are significantly wider and not perfectly parallel, remain (fig. 11). With bone objects the situation is slightly different. Bones from the archaeological stratum were used, on which a subsequent treatment was performed which removed the darker coloured patina. Microscopic evidence of the working of the bone also shows the use of a grinding tool spinning at a large number of rotations (fig. 9 - 10). The case of the “Serpentine figurine” is particularly interesting. On a simply crafted awl, which can be dated to the Neolithic period and beyond, a spirally carved embellishment was added (fig. 13). The difference in colour between the spiral detail and the rest of the awl indicates a large time interval between the making of the awl and the addition of the decoration. A fortunate circumstance in the story about the “Neolithic art objects” from Belica is that they have not been accepted in Serbian archaeology. If we exclude the works of M. Stojić, the finds from Belica, glorified for their beauty, symbolism and originality, have not yet found their place in archaeological literature. There are no texts which even mention them as analogies for some other cult or art creations from the Neolithic. For this reason, this critical approach also happened at the right moment. If Serbian archaeology had not made any comments about the finds from Belica, for which there is some doubt as to whether they actually are of Neolithic origin, perhaps the damage caused by it would have been deeper and more noticeable. The question as to whether we could then talk about the Serbian “Neolithic deception from Belica” is one whose answer the authors of this paper did not want to wait for with their arms folded.

40|$|Surface {{confined}} dehalogenation {{reactions are}} versatile bottom-up approaches for {{the synthesis of}} carbon-based nanostructures with predefined chemical properties. However, for devices generally requiring low conductivity substrates, potential applications are so far severely hampered by {{the necessity of a}} metallic surface to catalyze the reactions. In this work we report the synthesis of ordered arrays of poly(p-phenylene) chains on the surface of semiconducting TiO 2 (110) via a dehalogenative homocoupling of 4, 4 "-dibromoterphenyl precursors. The supramolecular phase is clearly distinguished from the polymeric one using low energy electron diffraction and scanning tunneling microscopy as the substrate temperature used for deposition is varied. X ray photoelectron spectroscopy of C 1 s and Br 3 d core levels traces the temperature of the onset of dehalogenation to around 475 K. Moreover, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and tight-binding calculations identify a highly dispersive band characteristic of a substantial overlap between the precursor's π states along the polymer, considered as the fingerprint of a successful polymerization. Thus, these results establish the first spectroscopic evidence that atomically precise carbon based nanostructures can readily be synthesized on top of a transition-metal oxide <b>surface,</b> opening the <b>prospect</b> for the bottom-up production of novel molecule-semiconductor devices...|$|R
40|$|Density {{functional}} {{theory is}} a very important method for calculating ground-state properties for atoms, molecules and solids. Albeit exact in principle, its implementation requires an approximation for the so-called exchange-correlation energy. The most popular of these approximations, the local-density and generalized-gradient approximations, are local or semi-local and do not include the highly non-local van der Waals interaction. In this thesis a density functional for calculating the asymptotic van der Waals interaction energy for objects of different sizes and geometries is proposed. It is based on the adiabatic-connection formula for the exchange-correlation energy, where two basic approximations are made. First, the density response function is calculated {{at the level of the}} random phase approximation. Second, a local approximation is made for the screened response. In practice a doubly local approximation for the dielectric function is used when evaluating the interactions, together with a cutoff of each interacting object. This real-space cutoff prevents spurious overestimates of the response in the density tails otherwise caused by the local approximation. Explicit forms of the functional are derived for three model systems [...] - interacting atoms or molecules, an atom or molecule outside a surface and finally two interacting surfaces. Also the derivation of a correction to the 1 / z 2 -dependence for the asymptotic interaction between two surfaces is accounted for. The functional is applied to and found very reasonable for a number of different objects, such as atoms, fullerenes, and other molecules. Surfaces at different levels of approximation are treated successfully, from jellium surfaces to low-indexed Al surfaces calculated within a plane-wave pseudopotential code, with both surface structure and relaxation of the outermost atomic layers. Anisotropic effects for interacting molecules and molecules outside a surface are also considered. In summary, this thesis demonstrates that it is indeed possible to restore van der Waals interactions in density functional theory. An explicit van der Waals density functional that is proposed for long-ranged interactions is successfully applied to a range of test cases with mutual interactions of atoms, molecules, and <b>surfaces.</b> The <b>prospects</b> for a working van der Waals functional, applicable to problems within solid state physics, chemistry, and biology look very good...|$|R
40|$|Fuel {{cells are}} {{promising}} due to advantages with higher {{energy conversion efficiency}} and lower emissions of SOX, NOX and CO 2 than conventional power systems. Solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is a high temperature fuel cell, which operates at 600 - 1000 ºC. The high operating temperature and the anode material allow SOFCs to operate with different types of fuels from both fossil and renewable sources due to their general higher tolerance to contaminants than other fuel cells. It opens up for an easier transition from conventional power generation with hydrocarbon-based fuels to hydrogen energy by fuel cells. Due to the increasing global awareness of how energy production and utilization affect the environment, the interest of use of renewable energy has increased and fuel cells {{have the potential to}} be a part of a sustainable solution. Attractive fuels, which are considered in this study, are methanol, ethanol, di-methyl-ether, ammonia and biogas. It is concluded that it is feasible for SOFCs to handle all the studied fuels. An analysis of the fuels at the same temperature (298 K and 1000 K) is conducted and evaluates the heat required for each mole H 2 converted. It shows that methane is possibly more efficient as it uses twice as much heat as methanol and DME do. More advanced methods to investigate <b>surface</b> reactions are <b>prospected</b> to contribute, in combination with better catalysts, to more efficient reforming of the fuels...|$|R
40|$|Many {{technological}} processes, such as catalysis, electrochemistry, corrosion, {{and some}} materials synthesis techniques, involve molecules bonding to and/or reacting on surfaces. For {{many of these}} applications, transition metals have proven to have excellent chemical reactivity, and this reactivity is strongly tied to the surface 2 ̆ 7 s adsorption properties. This thesis focuses on predicting adsorption properties {{for use in the}} design of transition metal surfaces for various applications. First, it is shown that adsorption through a particular atom (e. g, C or O) can be treated in a unified way. This allows predictions of all C-bound adsorbates from a single, simple adsorbate, such as CH 3. In particular, consideration of the adsorption site can improve the applicability of previous approaches, and gas-phase bond energies correlate with adsorption energies for similarly bound adsorbates. Next, a general framework is presented for understanding and predicting adsorption through any atom. The energy of the adsorbate 2 ̆ 7 s highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) determines the strength of the repulsion between the adsorbate and the surface. Because adsorbates with similar HOMO energies behave similarly, their adsorption energies correlate. This can improve the efficiency of predictions, but more importantly it constrains catalyst design and suggests strategies for circumventing these constraints. Further, the behavior of adsorbates with dissimilar HOMO energies varies in a systematic way, allowing predictions of adsorption energy differences between any two adsorbates. These differences are also useful in surface design. In both of these cases, the dependence of adsorption energies on surface electronic properties is explored. This dependence is used to justify the unified treatments mentioned above, and is used to gain further insight into adsorption. The properties of the surface 2 ̆ 7 s d band and p band control variations in adsorption energy, as does the strength of the adsorbate-surface coupling. A single equation, with only a single adsorbate-dependent fitting parameter as well as a few universal fitting parameters, is developed that can predict the adsorption energy of any radical on any close-packed transition metal surface. The surface electronic properties that are input into this equation can be estimated based on the alloy structure of the <b>surface,</b> improving <b>prospects</b> for high-throughput screening and rational catalyst design. The methods discussed in this thesis are used to design a novel catalyst for ethylene epoxidation, which is experimentally synthesized and tested. Initial tests indicate that this catalyst may have improved selectivity over pure A...|$|R
40|$|We present {{here the}} first {{description}} of recorded sexual differences in flight behaviour and space use of lesser kestrel Falco naumanni. Lesser kestrel is a migratory, colonial, small falcon breeding mainly in holes and crevices in large historic buildings within towns and villages, or in abandoned farm houses across the countryside. Using accurate GPS data-loggers, we gathered {{data on the}} activities of lesser kestrels in the two of main colonies of lesser kestrels in Italy, i. e. Gravina in Puglia and Altamura (Apulia, Southern Italy) and the surrounding rural areas in a 20 -days monitoring during the reproductive period. We tested for sex differences in space use (home range's circularity ratio) and flight attributes (5 -minute flight length, instantaneous speed, distance from nest, flight altitude above ground level) of 9 monitored individuals (4 males and 5 females). We found significant sexual differences for all the observed traits. Our results demonstrate that female lesser kestrels during the monitoring period employed a lower amount of energy in local movements as measured by four flight attributes that resulted significantly different (and lower) than for males. Compact home ranges for females could represent a maximization of the benefit-cost ratio between <b>prospected</b> <b>surface</b> and distance from nest, i. e. the optimal trade-off between foraging requirements (explored surface) and costs {{in terms of time}} and energy (distance from nest). On the contrary, males showed a significantly different space use with very elongated home ranges and mean distance from nest almost three times as elevated as females' one. We argue that the detected sexual divergence was the product of their respective ways to optimize the relationship between resource acquisition and reproductive activity. ...|$|R
