5|$|However, the discontent {{within the}} locker room and the team's overall struggles culminated with Holmes criticizing and arguing with {{teammates}} in the huddle against Miami. Holmes was benched in the fourth quarter while the Jets subsequently lost 19–17, ending their postseason pursuit. After the Jets finished the season with a disappointing 8–8 record, Ryan admitted to having lost the pulse of the team. Then free agent running back LaDainian Tomlinson remarked that Ryan's Super Bowl predictions had an adverse effect on {{the locker room}} by placing undue pressure on the players. Ryan conceded this point and announced that he would refrain from making <b>such</b> <b>statements</b> publicly in the future.|$|E
5|$|Freedom for the Thought That We Hate {{discusses}} the capability and liberty of citizens to criticize their government. Lewis {{asserts that the}} U.S. has the most unreserved speech of any nation. Law professor Jeremy Waldron gave the example {{of his ability to}} criticize the president or call the vice president and Secretary of Defense war criminals, without fear of retribution from law enforcement for <b>such</b> <b>statements.</b> The book contrasts present-day free speech liberties afforded to Americans and those possessed by citizens in earlier centuries. The author argues that the scope of civil liberties in the U.S. has increased over time owing to a desire for freedom among its people being held as an integral value. Lewis observes in contemporary application of the law, presidents are the subject of satire and denunciation. He notes that it is unlikely a vociferous critic would face a jail sentence simply for voicing such criticism.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes {{during the}} {{testimony}} of a witness, the witness may be questioned about statements he previously made outside court on an earlier occasion, to demonstrate either {{that he has been}} consistent or inconsistent in his account of events. The Act did not change the circumstances in which <b>such</b> <b>statements</b> could become admissible in evidence (which are still prescribed in the Criminal Procedure Act 1865), but it did change the evidential effect of <b>such</b> <b>statements</b> once admitted. Formerly, <b>such</b> <b>statements</b> were not evidence of the facts stated in them (unless the witness agreed with them in court): they only proved that the witness had kept his story straight or had changed his story, and so were only evidence of his credibility (or lack of it) as a witness. They were not hearsay. Under the 2003 Act, however, <b>such</b> <b>statements</b> are now themselves evidence of any facts stated in them, not just of credibility, and so are now hearsay.|$|E

The name is a little misleading as the theory has plenty of infinite models. Ax proved that the theory is decidable.|$|E
25|$|A notable {{factor of}} {{continuous}} or continuing revelation {{as a source}} of divine commandments and statements is the written recording of <b>such</b> <b>statements</b> in a more open scriptural canon, {{as is the case with}} the Latter-Day Saints; while more frequent with the Latter-Day Saints, it is less frequent with the Baha'i Faith, with progressive revelation only being periodically expanded over an extremely long period.|$|E
25|$|Samuel ibn Tibbon was an {{enthusiastic}} adherent of Maimonides and his allegorical {{interpretation of the}} Bible. He held that many Bible narratives are to be considered simply as parables (meshalim) and the religious laws as guides (hanhagot) to a higher, spiritual life. While <b>such</b> <b>statements</b> were not unusual in his age, adherents of the literal interpretation of the Bible, the anti-Maimonidean party (see Maimonides for more details), created strong opposition to the work.|$|E

25|$|<b>Such</b> <b>statements</b> of {{the first}} law for closed systems assert the {{existence}} of internal energy {{as a function of}} state defined in terms of adiabatic work. Thus heat is not defined calorimetrically or as due to temperature difference. It is defined as a residual difference between change of internal energy and work done on the system, when that work does not account for the whole of the change of internal energy and the system is not adiabatically isolated.|$|E
25|$|The {{health effects}} of smoking have been {{significant}} {{for the development of}} the science of epidemiology. As the mechanism of carcinogenicity is radiomimetic or radiological, the effects are stochastic. Definite statements can be made only on the relative increased or decreased probabilities of contracting a given disease. For a particular individual, it is impossible to definitively prove a direct causal link between exposure to a radiomimetic poison such as tobacco smoke and the cancer that follows; <b>such</b> <b>statements</b> can only be made at the aggregate population level. Tobacco companies have capitalized on this philosophical objection and exploited the doubts of clinicians, who consider only individual cases, on the causal link in the stochastic expression of the toxicity as actual disease.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s, then-Apostle Ezra Taft Benson {{was quoted}} by the Associated Press {{that it would}} be {{difficult}} for a faithful Latter-day Saint to be a liberal Democrat. Although the LDS Church has officially repudiated <b>such</b> <b>statements</b> on many occasions, Democratic candidates—including LDS Democrats—believe that Republicans capitalize on the perception that the Republican Party is doctrinally superior. Political scientist and pollster Dan Jones explains this disparity by noting that the national Democratic Party is associated with liberal positions on gay marriage and abortion, both of which the LDS Church is against. The Republican Party in heavily Mormon Utah County presents itself as the superior choice for Latter-day Saints. Even though Utah Democratic candidates are predominantly LDS, socially conservative, and pro-life, no Democrat has won in Utah County since 1994.|$|E

Baez also asked Judge Perry to instruct the jury about this search information, but prosecutors disputed this {{and it was not}} done. Also on June 27, the defense called two private investigators who, in November 2008, had searched the area where the body was later found. The search was videotaped, but nothing was found. On June28, the defense called a Texas EquuSearch team leader who did two searches of the area and found no body. The defense then called Roy Kronk, who recounted the same basic story he told police about his discovery of Caylee Anthony's remains in December 2008. He acknowledged receiving $5,000 after the remains were identified, but denied that he told his son that finding the body would make him rich and famous. The next day, his son testified he had made <b>such</b> <b>statements.</b>|$|E
25|$|Lodge was a Christian Spiritualist. In 1909 he {{published}} the book Survival of Man which expressed {{his belief that}} life after death had been demonstrated by mediumship. His most controversial book was Raymond or Life and Death (1916). The book documented the séances {{that he and his}} wife had attended with the medium Gladys Osborne Leonard. Lodge was convinced that his son Raymond had communicated with him and the book is a description of his son's experiences in the spirit world. According to the book Raymond had reported that people who had died were still the same people when they passed over, there were houses, trees and flowers and the Spirit world looked similar to earth but there is no disease. The book also claimed that when soldiers died in World War I they had smoked cigars and received whisky in the spirit world and because of <b>such</b> <b>statements</b> the book was criticised. Walter Cook wrote a rebuttal to Lodge Reflections on Raymond (1917) that directly challenged Lodge's beliefs in Spiritualism.|$|E
25|$|In {{parallel}} to his university job, he travelled throughout India {{under the name}} Acharya Rajneesh (Acharya means teacher or professor; Rajneesh was a nickname he had acquired in childhood), giving lectures critical of socialism, Gandhi and institutional religions. He said that socialism would only socialise poverty, and he described Gandhi as a masochist reactionary who worshipped poverty. What India needed to escape its backwardness was capitalism, science, modern technology and birth control. He criticised orthodox Indian religions as dead, filled with empty ritual, oppressing their followers with fears of damnation {{and the promise of}} blessings. <b>Such</b> <b>statements</b> made him controversial, but also gained him a loyal following that included a number of wealthy merchants and businessmen. These sought individual consultations from him about their spiritual development and daily life, in return for donations—a commonplace arrangement in India—and his practice grew rapidly. From 1962, he began to lead 3- to 10-day meditation camps, and the first meditation centres (Jivan Jagruti Kendra) started to emerge around his teaching, then known as the Life Awakening Movement (Jivan Jagruti Andolan). After a controversial speaking tour in 1966, he resigned from his teaching post {{at the request of the}} university.|$|E

25|$|There {{have been}} two interpretations of Chen's actions during the {{election}} in terms of independence politics. The first {{is that he is}} ideologically committed to advancing Taiwan independence and that his actions are intended to systematically remove the constraints which prevent this from occurring. Seen in this light, his actions are intended to provoke a crisis in which the PRC must either start a war or accept independence, with the expectation that the PRC would back down. Ironically, this interpretation of his actions is shared both among his most fervent supporters (who think it is a good thing) and his most bitter opponents (who think that it is a bad thing). It is largely to counter this possibility that the PRC has issued statements that it will definitely go to war if certain red lines are crossed. However, they in reality carry little meaning, as Beijing has made <b>such</b> <b>statements</b> warning against electing former President Lee and Chen in the 1996 and 2000 elections, which both failed to materialize. Some people regard these statements now as reverse psychology, as Lee and Chen may help to weaken ROC and advance the unification process.|$|E
