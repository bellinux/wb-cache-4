6000|$|... "Oh, Joe," [...] {{was all she}} whispered. But the {{happiness}} and welcome in that whisper could never have been better expressed in longer speech. Then slightly, ever so slightly, <b>she</b> <b>tilted</b> <b>her</b> sweet face up to his.|$|E
6000|$|But Mrs. Barker, though inexperienced in love, {{was a good}} fighter. The best of the sex are. She {{dropped into}} the rocking-chair, and began rocking {{backwards}} and forwards while still tugging at her gloves, and said, in a gradually warming voice, [...] "I certainly shall not magnify Mr. Van Loo's silliness to that importance. And I have yet to learn {{what you mean by}} talking about a rendezvous! And I want to know," [...] she continued, suddenly stopping her rocking and tilting the rockers impertinently behind her, as, with her elbows squared on the chair arms, <b>she</b> <b>tilted</b> <b>her</b> own face defiantly up into Mrs. Horncastle's, [...] "how a woman in your position--who doesn't live with her husband--dares to talk to ME!" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{girl would}} have been {{striking}} in any company. Neale thought her neither beautiful nor pretty, but he kept on looking. Her arms were bare, her dress cut very low. Her face offered vivid contrast to the carmine on her lips. It was a round, soft face, with narrow eyes, dark, seductive, bold. <b>She</b> <b>tilted</b> <b>her</b> {{head to one side}} and suddenly smiled at Neale. It startled him. It was a smile with the shock of a bullet. It held Neale, so that when she crossed to him he could not move. He felt rather than saw Hough return to his side. The girl took hold of the lapels of Neale's coat. She looked up. Her eyes were dark, with what seemed red shadows deep in them. She had white teeth. The carmined lips curled in a smile--a smile, impossible to believe, of youth and sweetness, that disclosed a dimple in her cheek. She was pretty. She was holding him, pulling him a little toward her.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> laughed, <b>tilting</b> <b>her</b> chin; and {{her voice}} began at once to sing, as if at the {{scarcely}} opened door of her throat, and a tune so plain it seemed but the words speaking:-- ...|$|R
40|$|Photograph of the {{painting}} "An Evening Song" by Max Ring, depicting a woman reading sheet music in a meadow, [s. d. ]. The woman is shown in full figure at center, dressed in {{what appears to be}} a bridal gown. <b>She</b> <b>tilts</b> <b>her</b> head back and rolls her eyes to the sky, while holding a sheaf of sheet music in her hands, as well as a violin, which she carries by the neck. In the background, a clearing is visible, moving back towards thicker forest...|$|R
6000|$|She {{stood before}} her work eying it intently for several minutes; then, with an {{expression}} of great contempt for the whole thing, <b>she</b> suddenly <b>tilted</b> <b>her</b> cherished Venus on to the floor, gave the classical face a finishing crunch, and put on her hat in a decisive manner, saying briefly to the dismayed damsels,-- ...|$|R
60|$|Now {{that the}} queen was {{at ease in}} her mind once more, and measurably happy, her wine {{naturally}} began to assert itself again, and it got a little the start of her. I mean it set her music going--her silver bell of a tongue. Dear me, she was a master talker. It would not become me {{to suggest that it}} was pretty late and that I was a tired man and very sleepy. I wished I had gone off to bed when I had the chance. Now I must stick it out; there was no other way. So she tinkled along and along, in the otherwise profound and ghostly hush of the sleeping castle, until by and by there came, as if from deep down under us, a far-away sound, as of a muffled shriek --with an expression of agony about it that made my flesh crawl. The queen stopped, and her eyes lighted with pleasure; <b>she</b> <b>tilted</b> <b>her</b> graceful head as a bird does when it listens. The sound bored its way up through the stillness again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Him lack for friends!" [...] and <b>she</b> <b>tilted</b> <b>her</b> head {{up with a}} frank pride-- [...] "why, Washington, you can't name a man that's {{anybody that}} isn't fond of him. I'll tell you privately, that I've had Satan's own time {{to keep them from}} {{appointing}} him to some office or other. They knew he'd no business with an office, just as well as I did, but he's the hardest man to refuse anything to, a body ever saw. Mulberry Sellers with an office! laws goodness, you know what that would be like. Why, they'd come from {{the ends of the earth}} to see a circus like that. I'd just as lieves be married to Niagara Falls, and done with it." [...] After a reflective pause she added--having wandered back, in the interval, to the remark that had been her text: [...] "Friends?--oh, indeed, no man ever had more; and such friends: Grant, Sherman, Sheridan, Johnston, Longstreet, Lee--many's the time they've sat in that chair you're sitting in--" [...] Hawkins was out of it instantly, and contemplating it with a reverential surprise, and with the awed sense of having trodden shod upon holy ground-- ...|$|E

When he returns, he finds Christine waiting for him, like [...] "a real living wife" [...] and he swore <b>she</b> <b>tilted</b> <b>her</b> forehead toward him, and he kissed it. Then {{he says he was}} so happy that he fell at her feet, crying, and she cries with him, calling him [...] "poor, unhappy Erik" [...] and taking his hand. At this point, he is [...] "just a poor dog ready to die for her" [...] and he returns to her the ring she had lost and said that she was free to go and marry Raoul.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Kenton {{had gone}} to Ellen's room again when she had got the judge off upon his mission. She rather flung in upon her. [...] "Oh, you are up!" [...] she apologized to Ellen's back.

6000|$|... "I {{know what}} I'm talking about!--don't I go there twice a week? And Mr. Clemens, {{if you could}} only see her wooden and {{satisfied}} face when she snubs me for forgetting myself and showing by a thoughtless remark that to me weather is still weather, instead of being just an abstraction and a superstition--oh, it's the funniest thing you ever saw!

Dismounting, the Queen draws her rapier and dagger to face Antonio similarly armed. <b>She</b> <b>tilts</b> <b>her</b> head back, {{her long hair}} flowing, and they take up the same stance and clash swords and daggers. Antonio recognizes her style as having been taught by Maestro Torres. He is shocked when she calls his name and they clash again and Antonio loses his dagger and the Queen retreats to be confronted again by Antonio more determined than ever, and as he forces her against a wall and {{with his free hand}} removes her mask, he gasps upon discovering it is Tessa Alvarado.He leaves and returns to Santa Helena and Montoya's office and finds Captain Grisham and demands the gold, throwing down the Queen's mask. Grisham refuses without proof and Antonio knocks him out and takes the gold, killing a guard on his exit.|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY A 5 {{year old}} girl with gross {{gastro-oesophageal}} reflux had pronounced dystonic neck movements that resolved after fundoplication and {{resolution of the}} oesophagitis (Sandifer's syndrome). Oesophageal manometry before operation showed that peristalsis improved when <b>she</b> <b>tilted</b> <b>her</b> head to one side. Dystonic posturing may promote acid clearance from the distal oesophagus. Case report A 5 year old girl was referred with a 12 week history of belching and vomiting, mainly after food. A barium swallow examination was reported to show {{the presence of a}} hiatus hernia. Her appetite had decreased appreciably, and she was thought to have lost weight. She vomited about three times a day...|$|E
60|$|There are {{few things}} sweeter {{in this world}} than the guileless, hot-headed, intemperate, open admiration of a junior. Even {{a woman in her}} blindest devotion does not fall into the gait of the man <b>she</b> adores, <b>tilt</b> <b>her</b> bonnet to the angle at which he wears his hat, or interlard her speech with his pet oaths. And Charlie did all these things. Still it was {{necessary}} to salve my conscience before I possessed myself of Charlie's thoughts.|$|R
6000|$|... "I must go now," [...] he said, slowly, {{as though}} the bald words had a higher significance. She tried to look at him, and could not. His arms circled her, with frightened happiness. <b>She</b> <b>tilted</b> back <b>her</b> head, {{and there was the}} ever-new {{surprise}} of blue irises under dark brows. Uplifted wonder her eyes spoke. His head drooped till he kissed her lips. The two bodies clamored for each other. But she unwound his arms, crying, [...] "No, no, no!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's kind of you. I feel to want it, tu." [...] And, {{putting it}} to <b>her</b> lips, <b>she</b> drank, <b>tilting</b> back <b>her</b> head. Perhaps {{it was the}} {{tell-tale}} softness of her u's, perhaps the naturally strong lines of her figure thus bent back, but somehow the plumage of the town bird seemed to drop off her suddenly.|$|R
5000|$|Eames {{appeared}} in the fourteenth season of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, having been promoted to Lieutenant in the joint City/Federal Homeland Security Task Force. She {{appeared in}} the fourth episode, [...] "Acceptable Loss", as the SVU squad crosses paths with Eames when their investigation of a sex trafficking ring uncovers a connection to a terrorism case on which Eames is working. She tells the detectives to stand down and briefs them on her investigation. After SVU goes forward with their prostitution investigation, Eames blames SVU for making her lose her target. When Detective Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay) realizes {{that one of the}} alleged working girls was connected to the terrorism plot, Captain Don Cragen (Dann Florek) calls Eames in and Benson pleads with her to let them work the raid with her. Eames agrees, and they foil the terrorism plot. At the end of the episode, Benson asks Eames why <b>she</b> <b>tilts</b> <b>her</b> head at suspects while interrogating them, and Eames responds that it was something her former partner (presumably Goren) taught her. She briefly mentions that her partner moved on after 11 years of working together, and for her it was also time for a change. Eames returns to help SVU track down a sniper who injured Detective Amanda Rollins (Kelli Giddish) in the episode [...] "Poisoned Motive".|$|R
6000|$|The sky had cleared. <b>She</b> <b>tilted</b> up <b>her</b> {{chin and}} adored the stars--stars like the hard, cold, {{fighting}} sparks that fly from a trolley-wire. Carl looked down fondly, noting how fair-skinned was her forehead {{in contrast to}} her thick, dark brows, as the arc-light's brilliance rested on her worshiping face--her lips a-tremble and slightly parted. She raised her arms, her fingers wide-spread, praising the star-gods. She cried only, [...] "Oh, all this----" [...] {{but it was a}} prayer to a greater god Pan, shaking his snow-incrusted beard to the roar of northern music. To Carl her cry seemed to pledge faith in the starred sky and the long trail and a glorious restlessness that by a dead fireplace of white, smooth marble would never find content.|$|R
60|$|There {{she stood}} real and solid, a little {{unfamiliar}} in her tweeds {{and with her}} shining eyes intimate and unforgettable, as though I had never ceased to see them for all those intervening years. And bracing us both and holding back our emotion was, quite unmistakably, Miss Summersley Satchel, a blonde business-like {{young woman with a}} stumpy nose very cruelly corrugated and inflamed by a pince-nez that savagely did much more than its duty by its name. <b>She</b> remained seated, <b>tilting</b> <b>her</b> chair a little, pushing herself back from the table and regarding me--intelligently.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the start}} of her career, Kayah sang in choirs and {{recorded}} backing vocals {{for a number of}} bands, such as <b>Tilt.</b> <b>She</b> made <b>her</b> solo debut with the song [...] "Córeczko" [...] (Little Daughter) in 1988 at the National Festival of Polish Song in Opole. The same year, her first full-length eponymous album was released. It was a commercial and artistic disappointment and today is not included in Kayah official discography.|$|R
50|$|Jerry is puzzled {{because he}} can't {{figure out why}} his girlfriend (whom he met at the antique shop) seems to be wearing the same dress (a mid-thigh length one which is white on the chest and arms and black {{from the bottom of}} the ribs down and paired with dark stockings) every day he sees her. He tries various schemes to find out if she has any other outfits, but they are all {{frustrated}} by circumstances and fail to definitively answer the question. Elaine bumps into her and Jerry tries to get her to tell him what his girlfriend was wearing, but because of her neck trouble, <b>she</b> had to <b>tilt</b> <b>her</b> head straight up and she could only see the girlfriend's face. When he wrangles a visit to her apartment, he sees a 1992 photo of her wearing the same outfit. Consumed with curiosity, he finally loses control and starts rummaging through her closet looking for other different outfits but she catches him and dumps him on the spot, insisting that he leave before he can find out.|$|R
40|$|Jean Paul Sartre is waiting, {{waiting to}} become {{what he wants}} to become through writing, writing about what he is {{still trying to figure out}} a way to put his {{thoughts}} into words. So he spends hours that turn into days that turn into weeks that turn into months that turn into a lifetime of asking himself: Is this really what I’m meant to be doing? Sartre is marking his presence on the Earth, trying to make sense of a situation through writing words, words that will eventually represent his thoughts as if those thoughts were still alive. Does that make sense? Sartre thinks. Can a thought have a life of its own? He doesn’t like the words, but he starts to write them down, just in case. Can - ‘scratch’ - a thought – ‘scratch, scratch’ - have a life – ‘scratch, scratch’ - of its own – ‘scratch, scratch, scratch’… Oh no! What is happening? Now we are travelling through time and space. “Losing you Sartre, we are losing you”, flying across an ocean, entering another time zone, no longer in Paris, we’re in New York, and oh my goodness it is, isn’t it, it is Carrie Bradshaw. We see her through an open window, until the camera moves us into the room where we see her typing a script from which the actress Sarah Jessica Parker who plays Carrie in the television series Sex and the City and two subsequent movies, is just about to say the words that will enable us to understand these words represent Carrie’s thoughts, as those thoughts are escaping from somewhere that is deep within her subconscious, some might call it her soul, or others might call it … I don’t know what they might call it, but whatever it is, it is deep, very deep, and it’s late at night, and Carrie is alone in her room with her thoughts. The walls in the apartment are painted blue, an ocean blue, but the shade is very close to Benjamin Moore’s Electric Blue. There’s an undercurrent of white elements in the room, including billowing curtains, ceramic lamps, an old leather armchair and a mid-century credenza with sliding doors that might hide an amount of clutter. Of course Carrie is totally unaware of our presence. “Hmm!” she exclaims, while she continues to click, click, click away at <b>her</b> computer, before <b>she</b> <b>tilts</b> <b>her</b> head to one side, and then to the other “Hold it there, Sarah, beautiful. Now let your eyes drift to one side a little but don’t look at anything. You’re lost in that thought, whatever it is, as you start to lift your arm… no your right arm Sarah, lift your right arm above your head, and move your hand across your forehead, relax your fingers and yes - touch your eyebrow, it might loosen the thought. And it does the trick. “Now you’re ready to say the words that you’re already typing into the computer as you are thinking out-loud: “Hmm! I wonder if a thought can ever have a life of its own?...|$|R

50|$|Some mothers {{may choose}} the all-fours {{position}} instinctively. It {{can help the}} baby turn around {{in the case of}} a malpresentation of the head. Since this position uses gravity, it decreases back pain, as the mother is able to <b>tilt</b> <b>her</b> hips.|$|R
