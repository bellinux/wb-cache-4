40|$|In {{the present}} work, we report {{measurements}} of the effective thermal conductivity of dispersions of single-walled carbon nanotube suspensions in ethylene glycol. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) were synthesized using the alcohol catalysed chemical vapour deposition method [1]. Resonant Raman spectroscopy was employed to determine the diameter of SWNTs by measuring {{the frequency of the}} vibration of its radial breathing mode. The nanofluid was prepared by dispersing the SWNTs using <b>sodium</b> deoxy <b>cholate</b> (SDC) as the surfactant. Nanotube loading of up to 0. 3 wt % was used. Thermal conductivity measurements were performed by the transient hot-wire technique. Good agreement, within an uncertainty of 2 %, is found in published thermal conductivities of the pure fluids. The enhancement of thermal conductivity increases linearly with respect to the nanotube loading. The maximum enhancement in thermal conductivity was found to be 15 % at 0. 3 wt % loading. The experimental results were compared with the Hamilton-Crosser model [2], the Lu-Lin model [3], the Nan et al. model [4] and the Hashin-Strikman model [5].

40|$|In {{the present}} work, the {{effective}} thermal conductivity of single walled carbon nanotube dispersions in water was investigated experimentally using a transient hot wire technique at room temperature. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) were synthesized using the alcohol catalyzed {{chemical vapour deposition}} method [1]. The diameters of the SWNTs were determined using resonant Raman spectroscopy and photoluminescence spectroscopy. <b>Sodium</b> deoxy <b>cholate</b> (SDC), a bile salt {{was used as the}} surfactant to prepare the nanofluid dispersion. Nanotube loading of up to 0. 3 vol % was used. The maximum enhancement in thermal conductivity was found to be 13. 9 % at 0. 3 vol % loading. Many mechanisms such as particle clustering, Brownian motion, ordered liquid layering were considered to be responsible for the thermal conductivity enhancement in the open literature [2]. Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy reveals that majority of the nanotubes were highly individualized when SDC was employed as the surfactant. Based on our PL measurements we conclude that the particle clustering was not the major reason for the thermal conductivity enhancement. The possible mechanisms for the enhancement observed may be attributed to the Brownian motion of the micelles and percolation of the nanotubes to form a tridimensional network. The experimental results were compared with previous findings in the literature and classical theoretical models.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{separation}} of single-walled carbon nano-tubes (SWNTs) by chirality {{is of great}} interest to enable the next generation of optical and optoelectronic devices. Many separation schemes employ the surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), with or without a bile salt surfactant such as <b>sodium</b> <b>cholate</b> (SC). In this study, we observe and explain the effect of these mixed surfactant systems on the hydrogel-based selective adsorption separation method. We find that <b>sodium</b> <b>cholate</b> outcompetes SDS more effectively on smaller diameter tubes and quantify this difference as the <b>sodium</b> <b>cholate</b> concentration is increased and (6, 5) separation is diminished. These changes in separation efficiency with surfactant composition are understood using a theoretical model developed previously and predict that surfactant mixtures alter the charge per unit length of specific (n,m) SWNTs, altering the separation.

In this study, {{the effect}} of the natural {{surfactants}} octylglucoside and <b>sodium</b> <b>cholate</b> in inhibiting Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa adhesion to conventional and silicone-hydrogel contact lenses (CL) was assessed. Hydrophobicity was also evaluated to conditioned and nonconditioned CL. Methods. The inhibiting effect of the tested surfactants was determined through “in vitro ” adhesion studies to conditioned and nonconditioned CL followed by image acquisition and cell enumeration. Hydrophobicity was evaluated through contact angle measurements using the advancing type technique on air. Results. <b>Sodium</b> <b>cholate</b> exhibits a very low capability to inhibit microbial adhesion. Conversely, octylglucoside effectively inhibited microbial adhesion in both types of lenses. This surfactant exhibited an even greater performance than a multipurpose lens care solution used as control. Octylglucoside was the only tested surfactant able to lower the hydrophobicity of all CL, which can explain its high performance. Conclusions.

In the presence of 10 mM <b>sodium</b> <b>cholate,</b> the CEH activity was maximal near pH 7 but was significant between pH 6 and 8. Monospecific immune IgG raised against rat pancreatic CEH completely inhibited the CEH expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, a serine enzyme inhibitor, was inhibitory to the expressed CEH activity, whereas p-chloromercuribenzoate (up to 5 mM), a potent thiol-blocking agent, did not significantly inhibit the expressed activity. These experiments clearly demonstrate that the liver contains an mRNA encoding a bile salt-dependent CEH activity and suggest that the uptake of pancreatic enzyme is not necessarily the source of liver CEH as has been speculated...|$|E
40|$|Membrane-bound neutral proteinase {{was found}} in the microsomal {{fraction}} of rat skeletal muscle as assayed with heat-denatured casein as a substrate. The enzyme was solubilized from 1 M KCl-washed microsomal fraction by 1 % <b>sodium</b> <b>cholate</b> containing 0. 1 M NaCl, and partially purified by chromatography on a column of Sepharose CL- 6 B in the presence of 0. 5 % <b>sodium</b> <b>cholate</b> and 0. 1 M NaCl. The enzyme was eluted from the Sepharose column as a single but rather broad peak at a position corresponding to a molecular weight of about 190, 000. The pH optimum for hydrolysis of heat-denatured casein was about 8. 0. It was inhibited to signifi-cant extents by various reagents including diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate, phenyl-methanesulfonyl fluoride, iVMosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, iVMosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone, p-chloromercuriphenyl sulfonate, chymostatin, EDTA, EGTA, and o-phenanthroline. This inhibition profile suggests that the present muscle proteinase is a mixture of proteinases, such as a serine proteinase and a metallo-proteinase similar to those occurring in the microsomal membranes of liver and kidney (or small intestine), respectively. Among urea-denatured proteins teste...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{describes}} {{the production and}} characterization of monoolein aqueous dispersions (MAD) as drug delivery systems for curcumin (CR). MAD based on monoolein and different emulsifiers have been produced and characterized. Morphology and dimensional distribution have been investigated by Cryogenic Transmission Electron Microscopy (cryo-TEM), x-ray and Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (PCS). The cytotoxicity of free CR and CR associated to three MAD were evaluated in chondrocyte cells by MTT test. Monoolein in different mixture with <b>sodium</b> <b>cholate,</b> sodium caseinate, bentonite and poloxamer resulted in heterogeneous dispersions constituted of unilamellar vesicles, cubosomes and sponge type phases, depending on the employed components, as found by cryo-TEM and X-ray studies. CR was encapsulated with entrapment efficiencies depending on the MAD composition, particularly the highest was reached {{in the case of}} monooleine/poloxamer/sodium cholate mixture. The MTT test demonstrated that sodium caseinate in mixture with <b>sodium</b> <b>cholate</b> exerts an hyperproliferative effect on chondrocyte cells. Further studies are required in order to verify trhe suitability of Cr-MAD fot the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) ...|$|E
40|$|This {{work has}} focused on the {{rational}} development of polymers capable of acting as traps of bile salts. Computational modeling was combined with molecular imprinting technology to obtain networks with high affinity for cholate salts in aqueous medium. The screening of a virtual library of 18 monomers, which are commonly used for imprinted networks, identified N-(3 -aminopropyl) -methacrylate hydrochloride (APMA·HCl), N,N-diethylamino ethyl methacrylate (DEAEM) and ethyleneglycol methacrylate phosphate (EGMP) as suitable functional monomers with medium-to-high affinity for cholic acid. The polymers were prepared with a fix cholic acid:functional monomer mole ratio of 1 : 4, but with various cross- linking densities. Compared to polymers prepared without functional monomer, both imprinted and non-imprinted microparticles showed a high capability to remove <b>sodium</b> <b>cholate</b> from aqueous medium. High affinity APMA-based particles even resembled the performance of commercially available cholesterol-lowering granules. The imprinting effect was evident in most of the networks prepared, showing that computational modeling and molecular imprinting can act synergistically to improve the performance of certain polymers. Nevertheless, both the imprinted and non-imprinted networks prepared with the best monomer (APMA·HCl) identified by the modeling demonstrated such high affinity for the template that the imprinting effect was less important. The fitting of adsorption isotherms to the Freundlich model indicated that, in general, imprinting increases the population of high affinity binding sites, except when the affinity of the functional monomer for the target molecule is already very high. The cross-linking density was confirmed as a key parameter that determines the accessibility of the binding points to <b>sodium</b> <b>cholate.</b> Materials prepared with 9 % mol APMA and 91 % mol cross-linker showed enough affinity to achieve binding levels of up to 0. 4 mmol g− 1 (i. e., 170 mg g− 1) under flow (1 mL min− 1) of 0. 2 mM <b>sodium</b> <b>cholate...</b>|$|E
