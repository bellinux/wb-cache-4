A key element of our work was the study of invariant random subgroups (IRSs) of G. Any sequence of lattices has a subsequence converging to an IRS, and when G has higher rank, the Nevo-Stuck-Zimmer theorem classifies all IRSs of G. Using the classification, one can deduce asymptotic <b>statments</b> about spectral invariants of lattices. When G has real rank one, the space of IRSs is more complicated. We construct here several uncountable families of IRSs in the groups SO(n, 1).

40|$|In {{his famous}} letter “Go To {{statement}} considered harmful ” Dijkstra started a discussion finally resulting in banning of most unstructured control flow statements from modern high level programming languages. To overcome limitations of todays programming languages, aspect oriented programming has been proposed. Unfortunately language elements {{used by many}} AO languages are in a way similar to the Go To <b>statment,</b> so we ask the provocative: AOP considered harmful? 1 Go To considered harmful In his famous letter “Go To statemnt considered harmful ” [2] Dijkstra argued that programmers should {{always be able to}} create a sound mapping from their variables to values only based on a ’coordinate system’, which of course should not depend on program values but on external values. For a sequential program including conditional and branch statements this for example is a single textual index (the line number). Adding loops introduces an additional loop counter but nevertheless maintains the ability for the programmer to reason about variable values. Even procedures do not destroy this ability, although the necessary coordinate system now also comprises the call stack. However, with unstructured control flow as represented by the Go To <b>statment,</b> such a coordinate system does no longer exist. As a conclusion, Dijkstra claimed that – even though he did not claim that the list of programming language elements covered by his article was complete – any programming language construct has to maintain the property that it does not destroy the coordinate system for the programmer...|$|E

Some {{of the individual and}} situational factors that were associated with the variance in performance were identified. One hundred and twenty children between nine and twelve years of age in three widely separated schools participated in the study. The children were provided with lists of words to learn by using five learning tasks. A learning task that involved affect achieved memory performances that were quantitatively greater than the results achieved after other learning tasks. The empathic ability of the children was measured through an analogue. The children responded how individuals felt in certain video excerpts. The empathic ability of the children was related significantly to memory performances achieved after the learning task that involved affect. A questionnaire was answered by the children that gave their perceptions of their mother's and their father's behaviours and feelings. Various <b>statments</b> appeared that were consistently and significantly related to the empathic ability of the children.
