25|$|Potato (<b>Solanum</b> <b>tuberosum</b> <b>L.)</b> is {{the major}} food and cash crop after banana, in the {{highland}} region. Next in order of priority are maize, beans and wheat. In order to increase the growth of these crops in the highland region, inter cropping of bean, potato, pea and wheat was tested on an experimental basis with Seasbani sesban (Sesbania); lime and manure were added as supplements for the growth. Species of shrubs such as Sasbania, Leucaena, Calliandra and Markamia showed better growth than in the Central Plateau Region where similar studies were conducted. Studies have been conducted since 1987 by the National Agricultural Research Institute (ISAR) who maintains a substation in Rwerere, Western Province within the highlands. In order to increase agricultural production with use new commercial crops have been adopted in the project area. The crops adopted are maracuja (passion fruit), an export item, and potatoes. In addition, modern livestock breeding techniques have also been adopted.

5000|$|Induced defences require plant {{sensing the}} nature of injury, such as {{wounding}} from herbivore attack as opposed to wounding from mechanical damage. Plants therefore {{use a variety of}} cues, including the sense of touch, and salivary enzymes of the attacking herbivore. For example, in a study to test whether plants can distinguish mechanical damage from insect herbivory attack, Korth and Dixon (1997) discovered that the accumulation of induce defence transcription products occurred more rapidly in potato (<b>Solanum</b> <b>tuberosum</b> <b>L.)</b> leaves chewed on by caterpillars than in leaves damaged mechanically. [...] Distinct signal transduction pathway are activated in response either to insect damage or mechanical damage in plants. While chemicals released in wounding responses are the same in both cases, the pathway in which they accumulate are separate. Not all herbivore attack begins with feeding, but with insects laying eggs on the plant. The adults of butterflies and moths (order Lepidoptera), for example, do not feed on plants directly, but lay eggs on plants which are suitable food for their larva. In such cases, plants have been demonstrated to induce defences upon contact from the ovipositing of insects.|$|E

The amino acid sequences were analyzed by automated Edman degradation, and the amino acid sequence of Potide-J was determined to be Ala-Val-Cys-Glu-Asn-Asp-Leu-Asn-Cys-Cys.

40|$|Background: The {{object of}} this work was to {{determine}} the genetic and allelic diversity of Solanum species present in Chile, assessing allelic distribution among native varieties and commercial cultivars of <b>Solanum</b> <b>tuberosum</b> ssp. <b>tuberosum</b> <b>L.,</b> using microsatellite markers. [br/] Results: A high level of allelic richness was found in the potatoes studied. The seven microsatellite markers used presented a total of 64 allelic variants among native varieties and commercial cultivars of <b>Solanum</b> <b>tuberosum</b> ssp. tuberosum. The SSR loci generated an average of 9. 16 alleles/locus. The group with the highest PIC was that of native varieties collected in the Chiloe archipelago. The high PIC values found indicate that the native varieties from Chiloe have a low level of interrelation, representing wide genetic diversity. [br/] Conclusions: The markers with the highest number of alleles in native varieties corresponded to loci STG 0016 and LEMALX. Commercial cultivars do not present the same genetic variability as native varieties, and the allelic richness of commercial cultivars is lower than that of native varieties of S. tuberosum ssp. tuberosum. Most of the native varieties were clustered in accordance with their geographical location, while commercial cultivars, were clustered in accordance with their breeding programs in Chile and Europe, with the exception of Shepody...|$|R

The aim was to determine the optimal length of the cultivation the nodal segments of stems on the induction medium with reduced content of inorganic nitrogen 12 micromolar, 80 g/l sucrose and the addition 10 mg/l BA for the formation of tubers. And to confirm the assumption that reduced the amount of inorganic nitrogen in the medium generally leads to a significant induction of tuberization potato (<b>Solanum</b> <b>tuberosum</b> <b>L.).</b> Morphological changes were observed during tuberization and recorded the frequency of tuberization. It was founded the four variants and the control variant was differing length cultivation on the induction medium. It was watched the changes in the content of endogenous ABA in the nodal segment of stem, leaf, stem and tuber during tuberization. It was found that a longer period cultivation on induction medium with a reduced content of inorganic nitrogen in the nitrate form leads to a higher and earlier tuberization of potato (<b>Solanum</b> <b>tuberosum</b> <b>L.).</b> By measuring the content of ABA, {{it was found that the}} content of ABA increases with the time during which explants are subjected to stress.

Electron microscopy revealed the presence of rod-shaped particles (300 × 17 nm). Sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) indicated the 34 kDa viral coat protein and agarose gel of the immunocapture reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (IC-RT-PCR) products indicated the 800 bp cp gene. The sequences were aligned together, narrowed to six (one PVY-N and five PVY-O isolates) and then aligned with all published worldwide PVY cp sequences. The highest similarity index among the six isolates was shown between PVY-saudi-O 1 and PVY-saudi-O 4 (99. 9 %), while the least involved PVY-saudi-N and PVY-saudi-O 3 (99. 1 %). The phylogenetic analysis of the cp gene nucleotide sequence revealed a cluster of PVY-saudi-N and the Egyptian strain GU 980964. The results indicate the need for more sensitive detection of the virus in the imported seeds or tubers from countries, especially in the Middle East like Egypt, to avoid high threat to the Saudi potato trade.
