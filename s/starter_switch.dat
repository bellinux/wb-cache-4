25|$|In 2014, as part {{of running}} changes {{consistent}} with those of the MY15 Toyota 86 GTS, the Subaru BRZ also featured a new key fob and two new colours, including ‘WR Blue Pearl’ metallic finish. In addition, Subaru also launched special editions both for the United States and Australia markets. For the former, one thousand BRZ Series. Blue editions were marketed at additional cost, half painted in Blue Pearl and the other half in Crystal Pearl White. This model featured STI body kit parts, 17-inch STI black alloy wheels and red brake calipers. For Australia, Subaru launched a similar variant known as the Special Edition, also at additional cost.

25|$|Quick-start {{ballasts}} {{use a small}} auto-transformer to {{heat the}} filaments when power is first applied. When an arc strikes, the filament heating power is reduced and the tube will start within half a second. The auto-transformer is either combined with the ballast or may be a separate unit. Tubes need to be mounted near an earthed metal reflector {{in order for them}} to strike. Quick-start ballasts are more common in commercial installations because of lower maintenance costs. A quick-start ballast eliminates the need for a <b>starter</b> <b>switch,</b> a common source of lamp failures. Nonetheless, Quick-start ballasts are also used in domestic (residential) installations because of the desirable feature that a Quick-start ballast light turns on nearly immediately after power is applied (when a switch is turned on). Quick-start ballasts are used only on 240nbsp&V circuits and are designed for use with the older, less efficient T12 tubes.|$|E
2500|$|Although an {{inductive}} pulse {{makes it more}} likely that the lamp will start when the <b>starter</b> <b>switch</b> opens, it is not actually necessary. The ballast in such systems can equally be a resistor. A number of fluorescent lamp fittings used a filament lamp as the ballast in the late 1950s through to the 1960s. [...] Special lamps were manufactured that were rated at 170volts and 120watts. [...] The lamp had a thermal starter built into the 4 pin base. The power requirements were much larger than using an inductive ballast (though the consumed current was the same), but the warmer light from the lamp type of ballast was often preferred by users particularly in a domestic environment.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a typical}} hard wired motor {{start and stop}} circuit (called a control circuit) a motor is started by pushing a [...] "Start" [...] or [...] "Run" [...] button that {{activates}} a pair of electrical relays. The [...] "lock-in" [...] relay locks in contacts that keep the control circuit energized when the push button is released. (The start button is a normally open contact and the stop button is normally closed contact.) Another relay energizes a switch that powers the device that throws the motor <b>starter</b> <b>switch</b> (three sets of contacts for three phase industrial power) in the main power circuit. Large motors use high voltage and experience high in-rush current, making speed important in making and breaking contact. This can be dangerous for personnel and property with manual switches. The [...] "lock in" [...] contacts in the start circuit and the main power contacts for the motor are held engaged by their respective electromagnets until a [...] "stop" [...] or [...] "off" [...] button is pressed, which de-energizes the lock in relay.|$|E

50|$|Two or more {{contactors}} {{may be used}} {{to provide}} reduced voltage starting of a motor. By using an autotransformer or a series inductance, a lower voltage is present at the motor terminals, reducing starting torque and inrush current. Once the motor has come up to some fraction of its full-load speed, the <b>starter</b> <b>switches</b> to full voltage at the motor terminals. Since the autotransformer or series reactor only carries the heavy motor starting current for a few seconds, the devices can be much smaller compared to continuously rated equipment. The transition between reduced and full voltage may be based on elapsed time, or triggered when a current sensor shows the motor current has begun to reduce. An autotransformer starter was patented in 1908.|$|R

50|$|A glow <b>switch</b> <b>starter</b> {{is a type}} of preheat starter {{used with}} {{fluorescent}} lamp. It is commonly filled with neon gas or argon gas and contains a bimetallic strip and a stationary electrode. The operating principle is simple, when current is applied, the gas inside ionizes and heats a bimetallic strip which in turn bends toward the stationary electrode thus shorting the starter between the electrodes of the fluorescent lamp After a second the starter's bimetallic strip will cool and open the circuit between the electrodes and the process repeats until the lamp has lit. One disadvantage of glow <b>switch</b> <b>starters</b> is that when the lamp {{is at the end of}} its life it will continuously blink on and off until the glow <b>switch</b> <b>starter</b> wears out or an electrode on the fluorescent lamp burns out.|$|R

5000|$|An {{ignition}} switch or <b>starter</b> <b>switch</b> is a switch {{in the control}} system of an internal combustion engined motor vehicle that activates the main electrical systems for the vehicle. Besides providing power to the starter solenoid and the ignition system components (including the engine control unit and ignition coil) it also usually switches on power to many [...] "accessories" [...] (radio, power windows, etc.). The {{ignition switch}} usually requires a key be inserted that works a lock built into the switch mechanism. It is frequently combined with the <b>starter</b> <b>switch</b> which activates the starter motor. The ignition locking system may be bypassed by disconnecting the wiring to the switch and manipulating it directly; {{this is known as}} hotwiring.|$|E

2500|$|Semi-resonant start {{circuits}} {{are mainly}} restricted {{to use in}} commercial installations because of the higher initial cost of circuit components. However, there are no <b>starter</b> <b>switches</b> to be replaced and cathode damage is reduced during starting making lamps last longer, reducing maintenance costs. Due to the high open circuit tube voltage, this starting method is particularly good for starting tubes in cold locations. Additionally, the circuit power factor is almost 1.0, and no additional power factor correction is needed in the lighting installation. As the design requires that twice the supply voltage must be lower than the cold-cathode striking voltage (or the tubes would erroneously instant-start), this design cannot be used with [...] AC power unless the tubes are at least [...] length. [...] Semi-resonant start fixtures are generally incompatible with energy saving T8 retrofit tubes, because such tubes have a higher starting voltage than T12 lamps and may not start reliably, especially in low temperatures. Recent proposals in some countries to phase out T12 tubes will reduce the application of this starting method.|$|R

5000|$|Ford {{issued a}} nonstandard starter, a {{direct-drive}} [...] "movable pole shoe" [...] design that provided cost reduction rather than electrical or mechanical benefits. This type of starter eliminated the solenoid, {{replacing it with}} a movable pole shoe and a separate starter relay. This starter operates as follows: The driver turns the key, activating the <b>starter</b> <b>switch.</b> A small electric current flows through the solenoid actuated starter relay, closing the contacts and sending large battery current to the starter motor. One of the pole shoes, hinged at the front, linked to the starter drive, and spring-loaded away from its normal operating position, is swung into position by the magnetic field created by electricity flowing through its field coil. This moves the starter drive forward to engage the flywheel ring gear, and simultaneously closes a pair of contacts supplying current {{to the rest of the}} starter motor winding. Once the engine starts and the driver releases the <b>starter</b> <b>switch,</b> a spring retracts the pole shoe, which pulls the starter drive out of engagement with the ring gear.|$|E
50|$|Before Chrysler's 1949 {{innovation}} of the key-operated combination ignition-starter switch, {{the starter}} was often {{operated by the}} driver pressing a button mounted on the floor or dashboard. Some vehicles had a pedal in the floor that manually engaged the starter drive pinion with the flywheel ring gear, then completed the electrical circuit to the starter motor once the pedal {{reached the end of}} its travel. Ferguson tractors from the 1940s, including the Ferguson TE20, had an extra position on the gear lever that engaged the <b>starter</b> <b>switch,</b> ensuring safety by preventing the tractors from being started in gear.|$|E

5000|$|Being a British made {{car of the}} 1960s, {{there are}} some rather rare sub-types of Series 1 E-Types, {{particularly}} {{at the beginning and}} end of the Series 1 production.

It is not known exactly how many of these Series 1 cars (sometimes referred to as for convenience sake as [...] "Series 1.25," [...] but per Jaguar, Series 1) were produced, but given that 1,508 Series 1 OTS cars were produced worldwide for 1967, combined with the fact that these examples were made in just the last several months of Series 1 production, means that these, like the flat floor examples that began the Series 1 production run, are the lowest volume Series 1 variant, save of course for the special lightweights.|$|R
25|$|Opening {{the final}} {{series of the}} homestand against the Florida Marlins, manager Charlie Manuel <b>switched</b> <b>starters</b> Moyer and Halladay in the {{rotation}} to keep the latter on normal rest; Halladay responded by allowing two runs in eight innings in an 8–6 victory, supported by Chase Utley's fourth consecutive contest with a home run.

The Marlins took the rubber game of the series with a 2–0 shutout despite eight innings of two-run baseball by Cole Hamels. Kyle Kendrick followed Hamels' performance with eight shutout innings on April 20, allowing four hits and walking two, but interim closer Ryan Madson allowed back-to-back home runs with two outs in the ninth inning to tie the game and José Contreras gave up another home run in the tenth, sealing the Phillies' third consecutive loss. The next night, Halladay posted the third straight strong performance by the Phillies' rotation, and played the role of stopper by holding the Braves scoreless on five hits to notch his second complete game of the season and the sixteenth shutout of his career. With the win, Halladay became the first pitcher of the season to reach a 4–0 record. The rotation's streak of innings without allowing an earned run extended to 23, as Moyer allowed two unearned runs in six innings; the Phillies won the game, 8–3, and the series, two games to one. The streak was broken, however, the following night, as Hamels allowed four home runs in the span of two innings, and the Phillies lost to the Arizona Diamondbacks in their first trip west, 7–4.|$|R
