50|$|The {{survivors}} {{retreat to}} the town hall and hold the Blob off with furniture-barricades and fire extinguishers, {{but it is a}} losing battle; the Blob engulfs half the building and devours Briggs. Brian goes to the town's garage and gets a <b>snow</b> <b>maker</b> truck that has canisters of liquid nitrogen attached. As the Blob is about to consume Meg and her family, Brian shoots snow at the creature, which is angered and knocks the truck over. As the Blob surges toward Brian, Meg lures it away from him toward the canisters, which she has rigged with an explosive charge taken from a dying soldier. She tries getting clear, but snags her foot between two pieces of metal, trapping her. Brian regains consciousness and runs over to free her. The Blob is about to overrun them when the charge goes off, blowing up the canisters and covering the Blob in liquid nitrogen. The creature is flash-frozen, shattering into a mass of crystallized pieces. Moss Woodley has its remains stored in the town ice house.|$|E

5000|$|In late 2005 Struumwasser left Wall Street {{to found}} <b>Snow</b> Beverages, <b>makers</b> of natural soda. [...] "To get Snow Beverages in gear, Stu Strumwasser tapped his savings..." [...] Strumwasser {{has been a}} {{vegetarian}} {{since the age of}} 14 (in 1980) and was determined to manufacture and distribute a natural alternative to commercial and unhealthy soda. In December 2005, with the brand merely a few months old, the Wall Street Journal referenced it as one of the new natural sodas with [...] "catchy names such as Fizzy Lizzy, GUS, Steaze, IZZE, or Snow..." [...] Launched initially as a single-flavor natural mint soda, Snow evolved in 2007 to add a, [...] "few new additions to the fizzy family" [...] and in 2010 Snow, [...] "dropped mint and launched three familiar flavors."
