5|$|Lampard {{then put}} Chelsea 3–2 ahead, but Hargreaves {{levelled}} {{things up with}} a shot into the top corner. Ashley Cole was the next up, and Van der Sar got a <b>strong</b> <b>hand</b> to the ball but could not keep it out. Nani then {{knew he had to}} score to keep United in it, and he did, leaving it up to John Terry to win the cup for Chelsea; however, Terry lost his footing when planting his standing foot by the ball, and, even though Van der Sar was sent the wrong way, Terry's mis-hit effort struck the outside of the right post and went wide.|$|E
50|$|Another variant advocates two strong forcing openings, 2 for <b>strong</b> <b>hands</b> {{with fewer}} than four spades and 2 for <b>strong</b> <b>hands</b> with four or more spades.|$|R
50|$|One major {{advantage}} of the artificial opening bid of 2 {{for all types of}} <b>strong</b> <b>hands</b> is that other opening bids at the two-level (2, 2 and 2) become available for weak two bids, thus eliminating many possible bids for the opponents. These weak two hands appear 20 times as often as the very <b>strong</b> <b>hands,</b> which illustrates the inefficiency of reserving all opening bids at the two-level for very <b>strong</b> <b>hands.</b>|$|R

In Roman, it includes weak balanced <b>hands,</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>hands</b> with secondary club suit, and very <b>strong</b> <b>hands.</b> Other 1-bids are made in strict accordance with canapé principle (shorter suit first).|$|R
5|$|In September 1941 Japan {{began its}} southward {{expansion}} by expanding its {{military presence in}} Indochina ("securing 'points d'appui'") and decisively {{increased the number of}} stationed personnel and planes. This provoked the United States, the United Kingdom, and other Western governments to freeze Japanese assets, while the US (which supplied 80 percent of Japan's oil) responded by placing a complete oil embargo on the Japanese Empire. As a result, Japan was essentially forced to choose between abandoning its ambitions in South-East Asia and its prosecution of the war against China, or seizing the natural resources it needed by force. The Japanese military did not consider the former an option as attacking Soviet Russia instead of expanding into South Asia had become a more and more unpopular choice since Japan's humiliating defeat at the Battle of Khalkin Gol in 1939 and the final rejection of any near-term action in Siberia shortly after Germany began its invasion of the USSR. Moreover, many officers considered America's oil embargo an unspoken declaration of war. With the harsh oil sanctions imposed by the United States, the Japanese leadership was now even more determined to remain in China. Germany had refused to sell Japan the blueprints to make synthetic oil, so Japan's only hope for oil was to invade the Dutch East Indies, which would result in war with the United States and Britain. To succeed the Japanese had to neutralize the powerful United States Pacific Fleet, so they could prevent it from interfering with future Japanese movements in South-East Asia and negotiate peace terms from a <b>strong</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E

25|$|The arts of Southeast Asia have {{affinity}} with {{the arts of}} other areas. Dance in much of Southeast Asia includes movement of the hands {{as well as the}} feet, to express the dance's emotion and meaning of the story that the ballerina is going to tell the audience. Most of Southeast Asia introduced dance into their court; in particular, Cambodian royal ballet represented them in the early 7th century before the Khmer Empire, which was highly influenced by Indian Hinduism. Apsara Dance, famous for <b>strong</b> <b>hand</b> and feet movement, is a great example of Hindu symbolic dance.|$|E

In contrast to their father, the Deemster's children, Ewan and Mona, grow up to become a conscientious and diligent priest and a caring and good woman. In contrast, without the <b>strong</b> <b>hand</b> to admonish him, the Bishop's son, Dan, grows up to become “thoughtless, brave, stubborn,” likeable but unreliable.

5000|$|The basic {{motivation}} of strong pass systems is to reserve as much bidding room {{as possible for}} <b>strong</b> <b>hands,</b> and to be as preemptive as is safely possible with weak <b>hands.</b> <b>Strong</b> pass systems are often coupled with relay systems for precisely describing <b>strong</b> <b>hands,</b> and limited bids are heavily oriented towards finding low-level major-suit contracts, with [...] "major-suit" [...] bids (i.e. bids that promise a certain major-suit holding, which are not necessarily natural heart or spade bids — most strong-pass systems are highly artificial) typically promising only four cards in a particular major.|$|R
25|$|Under Thutmose III (1479–1426BC) and Amenhotep II (1427–1400BC), {{the regular}} {{presence}} of the <b>strong</b> <b>hand</b> of the Egyptian ruler and his armies kept the Amorites and Canaanites sufficiently loyal. Nevertheless, Thutmose III reported a new and troubling element in the population. Habiru or (in Egyptian) 'Apiru, are reported for the first time. These {{seem to have been}} mercenaries, brigands or outlaws, who may have at one time led a settled life, but with bad-luck or due to the force of circumstances, contributed a rootless element of the population, prepared to hire themselves to whichever local mayor, king or princeling prepared to undertake their support.|$|E
25|$|Economic sacrifices were made, however, in {{the name}} of {{defeating}} the enemy. In 1915 Liberal politician David Lloyd George took charge of the newly created Ministry of Munitions. He dramatically increased the output of artillery shells—the main weapon actually used in battle. In 1916 he became secretary for war. Prime Minister H. H. Asquith was a disappointment; he formed a coalition government in 1915 but it was also ineffective. Asquith was replaced by Lloyd George in late 1916. He had a <b>strong</b> <b>hand</b> in the managing of every affair, making many decisions himself. Historians credit Lloyd George with providing the driving energy and organisation that won the War.|$|E
25|$|Uthman was {{a shrewd}} {{businessman}} and a successful trader from his youth, which contributed {{greatly to the}} Rashidun Empire. Umar had fixed the allowance {{of the people and}} on assuming office, Uthman increased it by about 25%. Umar had placed a ban on the sale of lands and the purchase of agricultural lands in conquered territories. Uthman withdrew these restrictions, {{in view of the fact}} that the trade could not flourish. Uthman also permitted people to draw loans from the public treasury. Under Umar, it had been laid down as a policy that the lands in conquered territories were not to be distributed among the combatants, but were to remain the property of the previous owners. The army felt dissatisfied at this decision, but Umar suppressed the opposition with a <b>strong</b> <b>hand.</b> Uthman followed the policy devised by Umar and there were more conquests, and the revenues from land increased considerably.|$|E

25|$|Crescentius the Elder, {{the brother}} of Pope John XIII, had {{previously}} deposed and had strangled Pope Benedict VI, and helped install Antipope Boniface VII in Rome {{in opposition to the}} imperial candidates, Pope Benedict VII and Pope John XIV, the latter of which perished in the Castel Sant'Angelo like Benedict V. Crescentius the Younger, the son of Crescentius the Elder, likely had a <b>strong</b> <b>hand</b> in the election of Pope John XV, although the details of that papacy are incomplete and disputed. However, it is known that Crescentius the Younger deferred to Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor for the choice of the successor of John XV: Pope Gregory V, Otto III's cousin. Yet, not long afterward, disputes with the emperor and Gregory V caused Crescentius the Younger to support Antipope John XVI, who was deposed with some difficulty by Otto III, who proceeded to have John XVI mutilated and Crescentius the Younger killed.|$|E
25|$|In February 1941, Papen's <b>strong</b> <b>hand</b> in Ankara {{was greatly}} {{strengthened}} when the Wehrmacht entered Bulgaria {{as a prelude}} to the invasion of Greece, which meant {{for the first time that}} German forces were on the border with Turkish Thrace, which greatly increased the fear of Germany in Turkey. Papen hinted more than once to the Turks that Germany was prepared to support Bulgarian claims to Thrace if Turkey did not prove more accommodating to Germany. When King Boris III of Bulgaria met Hitler, Papen attended the German-Bulgarian summit as a senior adviser on the Balkans to give the impression that the long-standing Bulgarian claims to Thrace were on the agenda, which as planned frightened the Turks. In May 1941 Papen offered İnönü parts of Greece if Turkey were to enter the war on the Axis side, an offer İnönü declined. In May 1941 when the Germans dispatched an expeditionary force to Iraq to fight against the British as the Iraqis had joined the war on the Axis side, İnönü refused Papen's request that the German forces be allowed transit rights to Iraq across Turkey. Papen had offered the Turks parts of Bulgaria, Greece, Iraq and Syria in exchange for transit rights to Iraq, an offer that led to a draft treaty according to German records while the Turks denied having signed such a treaty. The Auswärtige Amts records state that the treaty was aborted shortly after being signed when the Turks become frightened as the British swiftly gained the upper hand over the Iraqis. The Turkish historian Selim Deringil argued the treaty was indeed signed, but only as a stalling tactic as the Turks were afraid that the Germans might invade their country to reach Iraq, and İnönü had no intention of going through with the treaty. Instead, the Germans used the French mandate of Syria to send their expeditionary force to Iraq. However, one of the railroads linking Syria to Iraq crossed Turkish territory, and Papen persuaded the Turks to allow arms in Syria to be shipped along that line to Iraq, which was a violation of Turkish neutrality that led to furious protests from Knatchbull-Hugessen.|$|E
500|$|According to Rikky Rooksby, {{author of}} The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, {{the lyrics of}} [...] "Express Yourself" [...] make it a simple love song, with Madonna exhorting the women in her {{audience}} not to go for second-best, to express their feelings and get their men to express theirs. Lucy O'Brien, author of Madonna: Like an Icon, described them as a [...] "feminist call-to-arms", with Madonna dismissing the satin sheets and gold baubles of material pleasures. As she said in the interview with Rolling Stone, [...] "the lyrics are my way of saying if it doesn't work, then you're better off on your own. Quite possibly there were some personal feelings mixed in the lyrics as well." [...] Subtexts are employed throughout the song, especially in the line [...] "What {{you need is a}} big <b>strong</b> <b>hand,</b> to lift you to your higher ground", where the [...] "big strong hand" [...] is implied as one's own hand, and not the typical male helping hand.|$|E
