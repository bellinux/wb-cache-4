5|$|After {{crossing}} a bridge, {{they reached the}} gardens {{in front of the}} palace, and Moberly noticed a lady sketching on the grass who looked at them. She later described what <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> great detail: the lady was wearing a light summer dress, on her head was a shady white hat, and she had lots of fair hair. Moberly thought she was a tourist at first, but the dress appeared to be old-fashioned. Moberly came to believe that the lady was Marie Antoinette. Jourdain, however, did not see the lady.|$|E
5|$|Because {{little was}} known about the region, the {{elements}} of its climate, citrus, water, and general ideas about illness and health, Stowe was possibly first among several authors and advertising schemes that portrayed Florida as an exotic place of natural wonders and powers that could rejuvenate frail health. What travel writers published on Florida were exaggerated claims, readily accepted by audiences hungry for escapist literature. Biographer Forrest Wilson considers the finished product, Palmetto Leaves—published in 1873—to be the first promotional writing about Florida ever. Occasionally letters about the state were printed in local newspapers in the North, but because Florida was {{still very much a}} rugged wilderness, Northerners really had no concept of what the region was like. Rather besotted with the marvelous properties <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> the orange, Stowe intended to call the book Orange Blossoms, but changed the title to better express the plant that proliferated the region the most.|$|E
5|$|When You Reach Me is a Newbery Medal-winning {{science fiction}} and mystery novel by Rebecca Stead, {{published}} in 2009. It {{takes place in}} the Upper West Side in New York during 1978 and 1979 and follows the protagonist, Miranda Sinclair. She receives a strange note asking her to record future events and write down the location of her spare key. As the novel progresses, Miranda receives three more notes with requests. The novel contains three story lines— the appearance of Miranda's mom on the game show, The $20,000 Pyramid, Miranda's best friend Sal suddenly not talking with Miranda, and the appearance of a laughing man. Central themes in the novel include independence, redemption and friendship. Stead also wanted to demonstrate the possibilities that <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> time travel. The author hoped to show her children what New York was like in her childhood, and demonstrate how in an earlier time children were more independent.|$|E

25|$|Recognizing her talent, Kollwitz's father {{arranged}} {{for her to}} begin lessons in drawing and copying plaster casts when she was twelve. At sixteen she began making drawings of working people, the sailors and peasants <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> her father's offices. Wishing to continue her studies {{at a time when}} no colleges or academies were open to young women, Kollwitz enrolled in an art school for women in Berlin. There she studied with Karl Stauffer-Bern, a friend of the artist Max Klinger. The etchings of Klinger, their technique and social concerns, were an inspiration to Kollwitz.|$|E
25|$|World War II saw Basildon {{used as a}} billet for troops, {{while the}} park became a {{training}} ground for troops deployed in tank and ground warfare. George Ferdinando continued to live at Basildon during this time. Eric served in the navy {{during the war and}} on his return set about mending the walls that had been damaged by bridging units used on the river and the huge holes left in the demolition area. The house was then requisitioned for the Ministry of Works, whose caretaker stole the lead from the roofs. He was caught and imprisoned for two years. Unfortunately the ministry were only willing to pay back one tenth {{of the cost of the}} repair to the roof and other damage done including a fire. Having lived at Basildon now for twenty years George moved to Shoreham-by-sea in Sussex where he died in 1949, but was buried in Basildon. Unable to foot the cost of repairing the house and the inheritance tax the house had to be sold and Eric and family moved to the converted barn house formerly part of the estate. The second Lord Iliffe, who lived in the area, visited the house at this point which was in rather a sad state. However, encouraged by the potential <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> the mansion, Lady Iliffe persuaded her husband to buy it. This was the beginning of Basildon Park's salvation and renaissance.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the death}} of her husband in 1994, Smith began devoting time to what she terms [...] "pure photography" [...] (a method of {{capturing}} still objects without using a flash).

500|$|Deal got {{the idea}} for the album's name from a {{painting}} that <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> Boston. Pods cover was designed by Vaughan Oliver with photography by Kevin Westenberg. Oliver attached a belt of dead eels over his underwear, and performed a fertility dance while Westenberg took pictures of him, using a long exposure. Oliver's inspiration included the need for [...] "a strong male response" [...] (via the [...] "phallic" [...] eels) to the music of the mostly female Breeders. Another motivation was his attempt to charm Kim Deal, and speak to her sense of humor, as he had become enamored with her.|$|E

Gale McCall's [...] "A Relic in the Garden" [...] consists of two large magnifying glasses in the planter boxes {{on the side of the}} station platforms, and four bronze baskets at the station's entrances that are illuminated at night. The magnifying glasses have open lenses that are filled with outlines of flowers, guarden faucets, baseball bats, and other [...] "relics".|$|E

500|$|One of Walter's {{subjects}} {{is young}} Olivia Dunham (Karley Scott Collins), aka [...] "Subject 13". Walter suspects Olivia's stepfather (Chris Bradford) is abusing her based on bruises she carries and frightening drawings in her sketchbook, but Olivia refuses {{to talk about}} it. One night, as Olivia {{is about to be}} struck by her stepfather, she temporarily finds herself in a different place; the next day, she draws in her sketchbook a picture of what <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> the other place: a zeppelin (which are a common mode of transportation in the alternate universe). Walter realizes that Olivia crossed over to the parallel universe, and can be the means for returning Peter. Walter puts Olivia under several tests to try to coax her to cross over, eventually eliminating all emotions but fear as the triggering mechanism. He arranges a traumatic test for Olivia, but instead of crossing over, she exhibits pyrokinesis and sets the room afire. In the confusion of extinguishing the blaze, she disappears.|$|E
500|$|Will's wife, Terri, {{returns to}} the series in [...] "Funk", giving her first vocal performance. Murphy planned a redemptive storyline for Terri, in which she realizes that Finn is similar to Will. He explained: [...] "She met Will at 16, so she sees a way to redemption... a way to redo that {{relationship}} {{in a positive way}} [...] almost as Finn's guardian angel, his fairy godmother. She gives him proper moral advice." [...] Murphy enjoyed seeing Gilsig and Monteith work together, so much so that he stated their friendship will continue into the show's second season. On June 2, 2010, Megan Masters of E! Online reported that Gilsig had yet to be officially invited back for the second season, but was confident that she would be. Discussing Terri's relationship with Finn, Gilsig explained: [...] "She sees in Finn so much of what <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> Will when she first met him because he's the same age as Will was. It's her way of remembering happier times—when she used to be kind to Will. And she realizes, here's a chance to be supportive of this kid." ...|$|E

On writing to Meaker, she said, [...] "To this day I {{have no idea why}} she responded to me out of the thousands of letters she was getting at that time. Thank God she did. I was both thrilled and terrified." [...] Bannon visited Meaker and was introduced to Greenwich Village, which made a significant impression on Bannon: she called it [...] "Emerald City, Wonderland, and Brigadoon combined—a place where gay people could walk the crooked streets hand in hand." [...] Meaker set up a meeting with Gold Medal Books editor Dick Carroll, who read Bannon's initial 600-page manuscript. It was a story about the women in her sorority whom she admired, with a subplot consisting of two sorority sisters who {{had fallen in love with}} each other. Carroll told her to take it back and focus on the two characters who had an affair. Bannon claims she went back and told their story, delivered the draft to Carroll and saw it published without a single word changed. While raising two young children, Bannon lived in Philadelphia and took trips into New York City to visit Greenwich Village and stayed with friends. She said of the women <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> Greenwich Village, [...] "I wanted to be one of them, to speak to other women, if only in print.
