5|$|Romney {{and its environs}} {{within the}} South Branch <b>Survey</b> <b>were</b> {{originally}} settled in the 1730s by Job Pearsall, and by 1748 approximately 200 people had settled at what was then known as Pearsall's Flats. Prior to 1762, Lord Fairfax sent surveyors into Hampshire County, who were charged with {{the selection of a}} site for what would later become the town of Romney. Pearsall's Flats was selected as the site due to its already having Fort Pearsall, a courthouse, and natural topographical advantages. Lord Fairfax commissioned a survey of Romney, and the town was laid out into 25 2-acre blocks with eight streets in a grid pattern in 1762. On December 13, 1762, the Virginia General Assembly recognized the stability of the upper Potomac frontier when it passed a bill establishing the town of Romney, and the bill was signed by Governor Francis Fauquier on December 23, 1762.|$|E
5|$|The parkway {{was to be}} {{built as}} a two-lane {{alternative}} to Route31 defining {{the border of the}} suburban and rural portions of Flemington Borough and Raritan Township. Along with the new parkway, a brand-new local street network was proposed to help support the new alignment. These would minimize the pressure of traffic on Route31 and include better roads for bicycles and pedestrians. More direct routes to different portions of the community would be provided to maintain the community's character. The proposed parkway was to also help upgrade the sensitive history along the South Branch River. According to the 2008 highway plans, the South Branch Parkway would cost the state more than $2.2 million (2008 USD) in funds to put together the survey of lands in the proposed alignment. Some of these funds for the <b>survey</b> <b>were</b> originally intended to go towards the removal of the Flemington Circle.|$|E
5|$|The {{survey showed}} that the breeds suffer from similar rates of ongoing health conditions, with one exception. Whereas {{more than a quarter}} of Pembroke Welsh Corgis {{surveyed}} suffered from some type of eye condition, only 6.1% of the Cardigan Corgis did. Eye conditions typical in the Corgi breeds include progressive retinal atrophy, which occurs more often in dogs over six years of age, and canine glaucoma, which again is more common in older dogs. Similar percentages in the <b>survey</b> <b>were</b> seen in both breeds for issues relating to reproduction, such as requiring caesarian sections and having false pregnancies. Further similarities were also seen related to musculoskelatal issues, including arthritis. However, Hip dysplasia, common in some types of dogs, is rare in the Corgi breeds.|$|E
