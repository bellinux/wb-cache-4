5|$|Bone, {{both human}} and animal, was also sculpted; human bones may have been trophies, or relics of ancestors. The Maya valued Spondylus shells, and worked them to remove the white {{exterior}} and spines, to reveal the fine orange interior. Around the 10th century AD, metallurgy arrived in Mesoamerica from South America, and the Maya began to make small objects in gold, silver and copper. The Maya generally hammered sheet metal into objects such as beads, bells, and discs. In the last centuries before the Spanish Conquest, the Maya began to use the lost-wax method to cast <b>small</b> <b>metal</b> pieces.|$|E

After Scully leaves it is revealed that the Cigarette Smoking Man was waiting in an adjacent room to question Skinner about the exchange. Leaving the building, Scully has a hunch upon seeing the metal detector again that leads to locating metal {{in the back of}} her neck.

50|$|Copper-based {{chips are}} {{semiconductor}} integrated circuits which use copper for interconnections in the metalization layer, the BEOL. Since copper {{is a better}} conductor than aluminium, chips using this technology can have <b>smaller</b> <b>metal</b> components, and use less energy to pass electricity through them. Together, these effects lead to higher-performance processors. They were first introduced by IBM, with assistance from Motorola, in 1997.|$|R
