5|$|All of this cosmic {{evolution}} {{after the}} inflationary epoch can be rigorously described and modeled by the ΛCDM model of cosmology, which uses the independent frameworks {{of quantum mechanics}} and Einstein's General Relativity. There is no well-supported model describing the action prior to 10−15 <b>seconds</b> <b>or</b> <b>so.</b> Apparently a new unified theory of quantum gravitation is needed to break this barrier. Understanding this earliest of eras {{in the history of}} the universe is currently one of the greatest unsolved problems in physics.|$|E
500|$|At the {{professional}} level, sprinters begin the race by assuming a crouching {{position in the}} starting blocks before leaning forward and gradually moving into an upright position as the race progresses and momentum is gained. Athletes remain in the same lane on the running track throughout all sprinting events, with the sole exception of the 400m indoors. Races up to 100m are largely focused upon acceleration to an athlete's maximum speed. All sprints beyond this distance increasingly incorporate an element of endurance. Human physiology dictates that a runner's near-top speed cannot be maintained for more than thirty <b>seconds</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> because lactic acid builds up once leg muscles begin to suffer oxygen deprivation. [...] Top speed can only be maintained for up to 20metres.|$|E
500|$|Once a {{duty of care}} (or duty to act, as required) {{has been}} shown, the jury should then be asked, {{following}} Lord Mackay in R v Adamoko: [...] "having regard {{to the risk of}} death involved, [...] the conduct of the defendant... so bad in all the circumstances as to amount to a criminal act or omission". This has two elements: firstly, the breach of the duty of care must relate to the risk of death (confirmed in R v Singh), and not to any lesser harm. In other words, the breach of the duty of care must cause the victim's death. Secondly the breach of the duty of care must be so egregious as to amount to a crime. For example, on the fact of Adomako itself, the defendant, an anaesthetist, failed to spot a problem with the victim's breathing tube for 11 minutes, something expert evidence suggested a competent anaesthetist would spot within thirty <b>seconds</b> <b>or</b> <b>so.</b> The defendant was convicted. This definition has been opposed as being circular, as defining the crime of manslaughter as gross negligence as being negligence to a criminal degree. The jury may, under this characterisation, be ruling upon a point of law and not a point of fact.|$|E

The first broadcast on RTÉ 2 was on 6 June 1978, it was largely aimed at those in [...] "single channel land". Programmes included The Streets of San Francisco and Duchess of Duke Street.|$|E
2500|$|The gunshots {{triggered}} {{an almost}} immediate response {{by the white}} men, many of whom fired on the blacks, who fired back at the whites. The first [...] "battle" [...] was said to last a few <b>seconds</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> but took a toll, as ten whites and two blacks lay dead or dying in the street. The black contingent retreated toward Greenwood. A rolling gunfight ensued. The armed white mob pursued the blacks toward Greenwood, with many stopping to loot local stores for additional weapons and ammunition. Along the way innocent bystanders, {{many of whom were}} leaving a movie theater after a show, were caught off guard by the mob and began fleeing. Panic set in as the white mob began firing on any blacks in the crowd. The mob also shot and killed at least one white man in the confusion.|$|E

So {{you can use the}} same source material in different contexts. If you're in a different place at a different time and in a different frame of mind you can use stuff that originally didn't go anywhere, and make something of it. So yeah, we keep everything, but, man, it's a lot of music and ideas lying on the backups these days. I'm guessing 10 per cent of what we start ends up as something presentable. We feel like a lot of things are interesting for 30 <b>seconds</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> but then what? We could probably sell riffs to rock bands, sell hundreds of riffs or piano themes or whatever, but our main problem is to tie elements together—to 'bring it home,' as they say.

2500|$|The {{estimate}} of cooperative time presented {{below is a}} minimum estimate, since data were not originally collected {{with a focus on}} recording all cooperative activity. Short cooperative activities were especially unlikely to be recorded in field notes. For example, examination of videotapes from hunting episodes during the sample period reveals that very short cooperative activities are frequently embedded into longer hunting segments that we have not coded as cooperative time. [...] While pursuing monkeys, hunters often call to others to [...] "stay put", [...] "don't make noise", [...] "don't shoot", [...] "shake a branch", [...] "pound a vine" [...] etc. [...] Other multi-hunter pursuits contain numerous similar requests. [...] The recipient of such a command almost always complies immediately, at a cost to his own chances of making the kill. [...] These events were extremely common, but of very short duration (usually only 10 <b>seconds</b> <b>or</b> <b>so)</b> and are not included in the analyses. Aché men spent an average of 41 (s.e. 7) minutes per day in food acquisition activities scored as cooperative, and women spent 33 (s.e. 14) minutes per day cooperating in foraging. This represents about 10% of total foraging time in the men's sample, and 11% of total foraging time in the women's sample. [...] Both sexes show some sample days with more than 50% of total foraging time being spent helping other individuals to acquire resources.|$|E

6000|$|We {{turned him}} into the library {{for a couple of}} hours, with the {{materials}} he needed; and by tea-time he had completed his first rough sketch of the elements common to the two faces. He brought it out to us in the drawing-room. I glanced at it first. It was a curious countenance, slightly wanting in definiteness, and not unlike those [...] "composite photographs" [...] which Mr. Galton produces by exposing two negatives on the same sensitised paper for ten <b>seconds</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> consecutively. Yet it struck me at once as containing something of Colonel Clay in every one of his many representations. The little curate, in real life, did not recall the Seer; nor did Elihu Quackenboss suggest Count von Lebenstein or Professor Schleiermacher. Yet in this compound face, produced only from photographs of David Granton and Medhurst, I could distinctly trace a certain underlying likeness to every one of the forms which the impostor had assumed for us. In other words, though he could make up so as to mask the likeness to his other characters, he could not make up so as to mask the likeness to his own personality. He could not wholly get rid of his native build and his genuine features.|$|E

The first trial was bound to be the worst; it was an experiment I made with life, and the chance of death or injury was, I supposed, about equal to the chance of success. I believed that with a dawn-like lucidity. I had begun with a glider that I imagined was on the lines of the Wright brothers' aeroplane, but I could not be sure. It might turn over. I might upset it. It might burrow its nose at the end and smash itself and me. The conditions of the flight necessitated alert attention; it wasn't a thing to be done by jumping off and shutting one's eyes or getting angry or drunk to do it. One had to use one's weight to balance. And when at last I did it it was horrible--for ten seconds. For ten <b>seconds</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> as I swept down the air flattened on my infernal framework and with the wind in my eyes, the rush of the ground beneath me filled me with sick and helpless terror; I felt as though some violent oscillatory current was throbbing in brain and back bone, and I groaned aloud.
