The Tudor Royal house of England was also descended from them. See also:Powell (surname), and Welsh surnames.|$|R

40|$|In the English-language naming conven-tion, a given (“first”) <b>name,</b> a <b>surname</b> (<b>family</b> <b>name),</b> and {{sometimes}} a middle name are used.

40|$|We {{have used}} names, {{particularly}} surnames, to identify {{people who are}} related. However, this {{has been done in}} various ways in different societies. While in many western countries we use a given (first) <b>name</b> and a <b>surname</b> (<b>family</b> <b>name)</b> to identify a person, in Arab countries, there are in fact no surnames; people use their given name followed by their father’s given name. For example, while my name in a western system is “Farrokh Habibzadeh” (Farrokh is my first name and Habibzadeh is my <b>family</b> <b>name),</b> my name in Arabic documents, say in a visa, would be “Farrokh Naser” (Naser is my father’s first name). Chinese use another style. They usually use their surname followed by their given name. Then, my name in a Chinese system would be “Habibzadeh Farrokh...|$|R
50|$|Occasionally, Scandinavians {{choose to}} use their middle name as their surname in {{everyday}} life. So Per Gottfrid Svartholm Warg has Per and Gottfrid as his given names, where Gottfrid, not Per, is his name of address, Svartholm as his middle name and Warg as his last name, but in practice he uses Svartholm as a surname. This usage, however, is unofficial. Historically, a middle name could {{become part of a}} double-barreled <b>surname</b> (<b>family</b> <b>name)</b> and hence cease to be a middle name, especially if used for several generations. There are many <b>family</b> <b>names</b> of this kind, which contributes to the confusion about middle names that shall not be hyphenated. Some of these double-barreled surnames are combined with a hyphen, while others are not, so a double surname without a hyphen can sometimes be indistinguishable from a middle name followed by a <b>family</b> <b>name.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The name [...] "Hartland" [...] presumably {{derives from}} the Old English word [...] "heort" [...] for a deer (compare with Swedish [...] "hjort" [...] and Dutch [...] "hert") and it is {{therefore}} surprising {{that it is not}} more common in England. The many places in other English-speaking countries called Hartland probably bear witness to the historic importance of Hartland rather than being independent derivations, since the word [...] "hart" [...] was largely obsolete before the European discovery of the New World. Before the discovery of America, the word Hart was common in <b>surnames.</b> <b>Family</b> <b>names</b> such as Hartshorne were first mentioned in the Domesday Book. The nearby Hartland Point was named [...] "promontory of Hercules" [...] during the Roman occupation, which could have influenced later naming of the village and parish.|$|R

40|$|<b>Surnames</b> (<b>family</b> <b>names)</b> show {{distinctive}} geographical patterning {{and remain}} an underutilised {{source of information}} about population origins, migration and identity. In this paper we investigate the geographical structure of surnames in 16 European countries through the use of the Lasker Distance, consensus clustering and multidimensional scaling. Our analysis is both data rich and computationally intensive, entailing as it does the aggregation, clustering and mapping of 8 million surnames collected from 152 million individuals. The resulting regionalisation demonstrates the utility of an innovative inductive approach to summarising and analysing large population datasets across cultural and geographic space, the outcomes of which can provide the basis to hypothesis generation about social and cultural patterning and the dynamics of migration and residential mobility in Europe. The research also contributes a range of methodological insights for future studies concerning spatial clustering of surnames...|$|R
50|$|The common naming {{convention}} throughout the United Kingdom is {{for everyone to}} have a given name (a forename, still {{often referred to as}} a Christian name) usually (but not always) indicating the child's sex, often followed by one or more middle <b>names,</b> and a <b>surname</b> (<b>family</b> <b>name).</b> A four-year study by the University of the West of England, which concluded in 2016, analysed sources dating from the 11th to the 19th centuries to explain the origins of the surnames in the British isles. The study found that over 90% of the 45,602 surnames in the dictionary are native to the British isles, with the most common in the UK being Smith, Jones, Williams, Brown, Taylor, Johnson, and Lee. Since the 19th century middle names have become very common and are often taken from the <b>name</b> of a <b>family</b> ancestor.|$|R
