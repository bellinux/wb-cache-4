Two hundred members are elected from national party lists; the other 200 are elected from provincial party lists {{in each of}} the nine provinces. The President of South Africa was chosen by the National Assembly after the election.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to activities run by individual Scout groups, {{a large number}} of rallies, activities, competitions, and training courses are held by the different Regions. The biggest of these are probably the Kon-Tiki raft building competitions held annually in Cape Town and Gauteng. Nationally, the Senior Scout Adventure is held every two years in the Cederberg mountains. In the past, <b>South</b> <b>Africa</b> <b>has</b> also held a national Jamboree, known as SANJAMB.|$|E

5|$|Currently, {{no country}} in Africa has a {{permanent}} {{seat on the}} Security Council. Although no one nation from Africa has formally been put forward {{as a candidate for}} membership on the Security Council, Algeria, Egypt, Ethiopia, South Africa, and Nigeria are seen as the strongest choices. Algeria has gained {{a great deal of respect}} for its neutrality over the years and its great commitment to African development; Egypt has the second-largest economy in Africa and the biggest military on the continent, was one of the founding members of the United Nations, enjoys great influence in Africa and in the Arab world, and hosts the headquarters of the Arab League; Ethiopia was also one of the founding members of the United Nations and holds the seat of the African Union Commission; <b>South</b> <b>Africa</b> <b>has</b> the third-largest economy on the continent; and Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa, has the continent's largest economy, and is one of the largest contributors of military and civilian personnel to UN peacekeeping missions.|$|E
5|$|<b>South</b> <b>Africa</b> <b>has</b> {{long been}} {{associated}} with the origins of Scouting. Robert Baden-Powell, the founder of the movement, spent most of the years from 1884 to 1905 as a soldier in Southern Africa. South Africa's most prominent role in the origin of Scouting was the Siege of Mafeking in 1899–1900. Baden-Powell successfully lead the defense of the town for 217days. During the siege, he was inspired by the boys of the Mafeking Cadet Corps, and later used them as an example of bravery in the first chapter of his handbook Scouting for Boys. The Mafeking Cadets are not regarded as the first Boy Scouts, as Scouting was only born later, in 1907 at Brownsea Island in Britain. However, it was Mafeking that resulted in Baden-Powell becoming a national hero in Britain, and it was his fame that enabled his Scout movement to catch on so rapidly.|$|E
