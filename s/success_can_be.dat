5|$|Some of Palairet's early <b>success</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{attributed}} to his father, who paid the professionals Frederick Martin and William Attewell, both later Wisden Cricketers of the Year, to bowl at {{his two sons}} during the Easter holidays, to help them prepare for the upcoming cricket season. During the later part of the 1889 season, Palairet made his first appearances for Somerset County Cricket Club. At the time, Somerset were a second-class county, and their fixture list that summer was against a variety of first- and second-class opposition. Although a Lancastrian by birth, Palairet's family home was at Cattistock in Dorset, {{and it was in}} the south west that he chose to play his cricket. On completion of his studies at Repton, he attended Oriel College, Oxford.|$|E
5|$|The Cook Islands compete {{as a part}} of netball's Oceania region. More than 1,000 {{players have}} {{registered}} to play the sport. Participation in the game grew during the 1970s. Much of this is possible because of the national governing organisation, the Cook Islands Netball Association which is a member of Oceania Netball Federation. Because of the level of organisation and the game's development, the country has participated at several international events including the Pacific Games, the Commonwealth Games, the World Games, the Oceania Netball Tournament, the World Youth Netball Championship, and the International Challenge Men’s and Mixed Netball Tournament. A demonstration of the Cook Islands <b>success</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> found by looking at the national team: It {{is one of the top}} ranked in the world.|$|E
5|$|Dissident {{success was}} mixed. Jews wanting to emigrate from the Soviet Union in the 1970s formed the most successful, and most organised, {{dissident}} movement. Their <b>success</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{attributed to the}} movement's support abroad, most notably from the Jewish community in the United States. In addition, as a group they were not advocating a transformation of Soviet society; the Jewish dissident movement was simply interested in leaving the Soviet Union for Israel. The Soviet Government subsequently sought to improve diplomatic ties with the First World by allowing the Jews to emigrate. The emigration flow was reduced dramatically as Soviet–American tension increased in the later half of the 1970s, though it was revived somewhat in 1979, peaking at 50,000. In the early 1980s, however, the Soviet leadership decided to block emigration completely. Despite official claims that anti-Semitism was a bourgeois ideology incompatible with socialism, {{the truth was that}} Jews who openly practiced their religion or identified as Jewish from a cultural standpoint faced widespread discrimination from the Soviet system.|$|E

25|$|Interlingua {{gained a}} {{significant}} speaker community, perhaps {{roughly the same}} size as that of Ido (considerably less than the size of Esperanto). Interlingua's <b>success</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{explained by the fact that}} it is the most widely understood international auxiliary language by virtue of its naturalistic (as opposed to schematic) grammar and vocabulary, allowing those familiar with a Romance language, and educated speakers of English, to read and understand it without prior study. Interlingua has some active speakers currently on all continents, and the language is propagated by the Union Mundial pro Interlingua (UMI), and Interlingua is presented on CDs, radio, and television.|$|E
25|$|In Australia, Monomorium {{species is}} {{particularly}} successful. This fact is particularly curious {{because of the}} presence of a very aggressive ant family, Iridomyrmex, which is quite proficient at interference competition. Iridomyrmex ants are able to quickly seek out food sources and prevent other ant species from reaching them. However, unlike other ant species, Monomorium species, despite their unaggressive nature and small size, are able to thrive even in areas where Iridomyrmex dominates. This <b>success</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> attributed to their efficient foraging strategy, and their novel use of venom alkaloids, repellant chemical signals. With these two behaviors, Monomorium species can rapidly monopolize and defend food sources.|$|E
25|$|The spin quartet {{played a}} {{combined}} 231 Tests for India from 1962 to 1983, and grabbed 853 wickets, with 43 five-wicket inning hauls. Much of this <b>success</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{attributed to the}} different bowling styles these bowlers possessed. Bedi was an orthodox left arm-spinner, while Chandrasekhar an attacking leg-break bowler. On the other hand, Prasanna and Venkataraghavan were both off-spinners. This way, they could target all kinds of batsmen in the opposition and give their captains plenty of options. It was Chandrasekhar and Bedi who were {{the leaders of the}} attack. The two played 42 Tests alongside each other and had almost similar figures, of 184 wickets each. Bedi averaged 27.22, while Chandra averaged 28.70 in these games.|$|E

25|$|Part of this {{relative}} lack of <b>success</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> attributed to President Colgate Darden's de-emphasis of football after the 1952 season, leading the program to turn down {{an invitation to the}} 1953 Cotton Bowl Classic against the Texas Longhorns in the first televised football game. Most significantly, Darden also reduced the number of football scholarships by 80% relative to competing teams when joining the Atlantic Coast Conference later that year, leading Art Guepe to resign and coach Vanderbilt. While future Presidents would allow the same number of scholarships as its rivals after Darden retired in 1959, Virginia would remain a shadow of its former football self until the 1981 hiring of Welsh some twenty-two years later.|$|E
25|$|More than 60 years later, Bateman’s Principle has {{received}} considerable attention. Sutherland argued that males' higher variance in reproductive success {{may result from}} random mating and coincidence. Hubbell and Johnson suggested that variance in reproductive <b>success</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> greatly influenced by the time and allocations of mating. In 2005, Gowaty and Hubbell suggested that mating tendencies {{are subject to change}} depending on certain strategies. They argued that there are cases in which males can be more selective than females, whereas Bateman suggested that his paradigm would be “almost universal” among sexually reproducing species. Critics proposed that females might be more subject to sexual selection than males, but not in all circumstances. An example of a species that flouts Bateman's principle is the pseudoscorpion, Cordylochernes scorpioides. Female pseudoscorpions that mated with more than one male had higher reproductive success.|$|E
25|$|Human capital {{explanations}} {{are those that}} argue that an individual's and a group's occupational and economic <b>success</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> at least partially attributed to accumulated abilities developed through formal and informal education and experiences. Human capital explanations for occupational segregation, then, posit that a difference in educational levels {{of men and women}} is responsible for persistent occupational segregation. Contrary to this theory, however, over past 40 years, women's educational attainment has outpaced men's. One area of education that might play a substantial role in occupational segregation, however, is the dearth of women in science and mathematics. STEM fields tend to be pipelines to higher paying jobs. Therefore, the lack of women in higher paying jobs might be partially because they do not pursue science and mathematics in school. This can be seen in areas such as finance, which is very mathematics heavy and is also a very popular field for those who eventually rise to high status positions in the private sector. This choice, like others, is often a personal preference or made because of the cultural idea that women are not as good as men at mathematics.|$|E
