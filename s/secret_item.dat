5|$|The {{original}} Metroid {{was influenced}} by two other major Nintendo franchises: Mario, from which it borrowed extensive areas of platform jumping, and The Legend of Zelda, from which it borrowed non-linear exploration.

25|$|In mid-1940, the British and American governments {{made the}} {{decision}} to exchange information on their defense technologies and enter into shared developments. The Tizard Mission initiated this exchange, bringing to America their most <b>secret</b> <b>items.</b> Among these was the cavity magnetron.

The painting is an enormous photo-realistic picture of Karabekian's experience of World War Two where he and five-thousand two-hundred and eighteen other prisoners of war, gypsies, and concentration camp survivors were dumped in a valley when the German forces realized {{that the war was}} lost. The painting, which becomes enormously successful as a tourist attraction, is meant to be the only painting that Karabekian created which contained [...] "soul." ...|$|E

However, they cannot return to Peckham due to a deal between the Driscoll brothers and Boycie - he {{would allow them to}} bury a <b>secret</b> <b>item</b> (later revealed to be 5 million Spanish pesetas in cash) on his land and he must protect it. The events of 2006 still had repercussions in 2007 even though Farm Idol was accepting auditions and Earl was missing in the woods. Also, Boycie began to worry about his health after finding out about a genetic similarity between him and past generations (but still worrying about it after finding out that his biological father was a captured Nazi-German pilot). A death was about to hit the farm hard though, but luckily, it was only Brian's pet turkey, Paxo.|$|E

The obvious reference point here is the Zelda series, which routinely features similar 'what's in the box' type moments. I like Zelda, {{and most of the}} other ' 80 s and ' 90 s games that Fez plays on...|$|E

40|$|Games {{have become}} an {{integral}} part of our lives, which is why they are increasingly being used for other purposes than pure entertainment, such as learning, training, informing, or advertising. In information systems (IS) research, this type of games has also been discussed under the notion of serious games, which are aimed at engaging users to elicit behavior change through motivation. In this research-in-progress paper, we propose a research model on user engagement with serious games and draw on the example of eco-effective behaviors toward renewable energy. We present an experimental design with which we plan to test our model empirically and aim to manipulate the presence and absence of two salient game design elements: storytelling and <b>secret</b> <b>item...</b>|$|E

Big Brother informed the housemates about her fate after she left. Carlo, who was with Deniesse at the confession room {{at the time of the}} announcement, kept quiet. A box of <b>secret</b> <b>items</b> was also put in the living room, with each housemate ordered to keep watch on it as an hourglass kept track of time.|$|R
5|$|Three {{types of}} <b>secret</b> <b>items</b> are available: gold bricks, minikits, and power bricks. Within each level is hidden one power brick. When a power brick is collected, its {{corresponding}} extra, such as invincibility or stud multipliers, becomes available for purchase. Each level also contains ten hidden minikits, that is, ten {{pieces of a}} Star Wars vehicle. When all ten have been collected, the player is awarded a gold brick. Collecting {{a certain number of}} gold bricks unlocks free rewards, such as a spigot that spews out studs. Gold bricks are also awarded when levels are completed, and when a predefined number of studs is accumulated in a level; ninety-nine gold bricks are available. The vehicles represented by the minikits are displayed outside the cantina. As each vehicle is completed (all ten minikits collected), it becomes available for play in a bonus level.|$|R
40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. The research investigated the development of verbal intimacy in young children's (3. 5 - 6. 5 years of age) friendships by measuring their capacity for restrictive self-disclosure (i. e. the greater disclosure of information of highly personal content to friends than other individuals, {{as opposed to the}} equal disclosure of information of low personal content to all individuals). Young children's capacity for intimate friendships is ill understood, partly due to limited or unsubstantiated data regarding the types of information that are considered high and low in personal content at this age, as the First Study (N = 110) showed. The Second Study (N = 93) attempted to fill this gap in our knowledge by investigating the sort of information that children consider secret. The results showed that children's ability to differentiate secret and non-secret information increased with age: 4 -year-old children could not systematically differentiate secret from non-secret information, 5 -year-old children systematically identified information that was not secret but were not consistent in their identification of <b>secret</b> <b>items,</b> while 6 -year-old children systematically identified and differentiated <b>secret</b> and non-secret <b>items.</b> However, children of all ages identified as secrets the statements which included a specific cue, such as the word surprise, in their wording. The Third Study (N = 209) investigated whether young children employ the restrictive disclosure-to-friends pattern when revealing the secret pieces of information. Moreover, the study investigated whether specific cues influence young children in applying the restrictive disclosure pattern, and to this effect participants were allocated randomly to either the 'clue condition' group (where they were given a clue that some information might be secret) or the 'no clue condition' group. Children in the 'clue condition' group treated the majority of the statements as secret information and therefore tended to only share it with a friend or with nobody. In contrast, in the `no clue condition' group statistically significant differences were found only in the <b>secret</b> <b>items,</b> suggesting that, when not influenced by an adult, children have the ability to identify highly personal/secret information and to treat it by accordingly applying the restrictive disclosure-to-friends pattern. Taken together, the findings suggest that young children engage in restrictive self-disclosure to friends in some, but not all, circumstances, and thus display signs of verbal intimacy in their friendships. This study is funded by the Alexandros S. Onassis Foundation...|$|R

50|$|MIS-X {{was based}} in Fort Hunt, Virginia. Secret {{equipment}} such as small compasses, maps, and radios were smuggled into German prisoner of war camps; to avoid compromising legitimate aid organizations like the Red Cross, MIS-X invented its own aid organizations and created aid packages from these, in which <b>secret</b> <b>items</b> were hidden. A radio code was devised to send messages via BBC broadcasts; this was based on Morse code: a one-syllable word was a dot, a two syllable word a dash. Such messages were preceded by a bell tone. A method of hiding a message in innocuous-looking outgoing letters to the United States was devised: all incoming letters were screened for such messages before delivery. These were signaled by having the date in numbers rather than letters. American officers who were privy to the secret and codes debriefed incoming prisoners and sent any useful information back to the United States.|$|R
50|$|There {{are a few}} {{differences}} between the GameCube and PlayStation 2 versions of the game. The GameCube version makes use of the Nintendo GameCube Game Boy Advance Cable, in which players can connect a Game Boy Advance (GBA) to the GameCube, enabling {{the use of a}} special radar function to find <b>secret</b> <b>items.</b> A radar screen appears on the GBA screen, showing the immediate area around the player, the direction the player is facing and the location of any hidden items. The PlayStation 2 version features an unlockable demo of Mega Man X8 instead. The frequency of enemy encounters is higher in the GameCube version. Also, if a player takes too many turns to defeat an enemy, they experience penalties far quicker in the GameCube version than in the PlayStation 2 version. The GameCube version also runs at a higher framerate and has faster loading times than the PlayStation 2 version.|$|R

Later in life, Choe embarked on a quest to bring the recipe of gunpowder to Korea. He visited China, which was then ruled by the Mongolian Yuan Dynasty. In general, technology of that region, such as cotton growing and gunpowder manufacture, was kept secret. Choe sought to smuggle some examples of <b>secret</b> <b>items,</b> and eventually was able to obtain knowledge of the three key ingredients of gunpowder: sulfur, slack or fine coal, and potassium nitrate.
