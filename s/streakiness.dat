Based on this work, and on an earlier study of dyed fabric nonuniformity [23, a range of options for reducing or eliminating fabric <b>streakiness</b> has been investigated. The visual assessment of realistic printed images of computer simulated fabrics was used to evaluate the different options. Of several successful options identified only two seem generally applicable. One involves reducing the variances substantially. In the case of dyeability, for example, the %CV needs to be reduced from the- 3 % currently encountered to less than 1 %. A second option, programmed creeling to minimize local contrast, was found to completely eliminate the perception of <b>streakiness</b> with currently feasible product variabilities.

40|$|The {{so called}} “hot hand” {{phenomenon}} (phrase coined by American basketball fans) {{refers to the}} commonly held belief amongst sports fans, coaches and players that sports players can, on occasion, produce sequences of consistently superior (compared to their normal) performance. Gilovich, Vallone and Tversky (1985) first alerted the scientific community to this phenomenon but concluded that {{the belief in the}} hot hand {{was nothing more than a}} misperception of random sequences. Researchers have argued that the statistical methods used to test the hypothesis of randomness and its antithesis <b>streakiness</b> (a more inclusive term for hot hand) were flawed. Golf was used as an exemplar for a sport where there is no clear success and fail outcome, unlike basketball shooting. Success in golf has usually been compared against “par or better” or “birdie or better” although these measures are the same for all players irrespective of their standard and don’t account for the hole difficulty on the day the hole is played. A momentum chart was used to identify potentially streaky performance and this data was then compared with the non-streaky data using the chi square test of independence. This approach would seem to satisfy a perceived limitation in previous approaches to evaluating <b>streakiness</b> where the whole sequence of performances is assessed for <b>streakiness</b> as opposed to just the streaky portions. Furthermore this approach allows streaky performance to contain a few non-successful performances. However future research needs to test this methodology out more rigorously using an appropriate criterion for success that is relevant to the skill level of the performer and the hole difficulty...|$|E
40|$|The hot hand {{phenomenon}} {{refers to}} the popular notion that the performance of sports players is punctuated by streaks of exceptional performance. During these streaks, the player {{is said to be}} ‘hot’, or even ‘on fire’. Unfortunately, when it comes to assessing evidence for the hot hand phenomenon, human intuition is inadequate—people are known to perceive streaks even in sequences that are purely random. Here we develop a new statistical test for the presence of the hot hand phenomenon for binary sequences of successes and failures. The test compares a constant performance model to a hidden Markov model with two states (one representing hot performance, and one representing cold performance) and one probability of switching from one state to the other. We assume appropriately restricted uniform priors on the model parameters and compute the Bayes factor by integrating the likelihood over the prior. The test is assessed in a simulation study and applied to real data sets from basketball and from psychology. Our analysis suggests {{that it is difficult to}} find compelling evidence for and against <b>streakiness</b> except for very long data sequences and extreme forms of <b>streakiness...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{detectability}} {{of patterns}} in random dot arrays was measured {{as a function}} of dot density and compared with the statistical limit set by different methods of detecting the pattern. For filtering, cross-correlation, convolution, or template matching, the limit is expected to be inversely proportional to the square root of dot density. But for auto-correlation, which can detect symmetries of various types, the limit is unaffected by dot density under many conditions. Confirming previous results, we found that the coherence-threshold is often constant for Glass patterns, but the range of constancy depends on details of the display procedure. Coherence-thresholds were found to increase when the average number of dots expected at each location rose towards or exceeded a value of one; we therefore think it results from the non-linear effects of occlusion that occur when a later-programmed dot falls in the same location as an earlier one. To test this, these non-linear effects were prevented by arranging the luminance of each location to be directly proportional to the number of times that location was covered by a dot. Millions of dots can be used for these images, and they retain the <b>streakiness</b> of Glass patterns, while discrete dots disappear. The constant coherence threshold for detecting this <b>streakiness</b> is maintained over a huge range of dot densities, extending right down to the range where discrete dots become visible and up to patterns that are essentially full-tone images with no discrete dots. At threshold, all these patterns have similar auto-correlation functions, as we can see from the way both low dot-number Glass-patterns and these mega-dot, multi-tone, Glass-like images are formed. This startling fact raises the question whether primary visual cortex computes auto-correlations as well as, or even instead of, the local, Fourier-type, wavelet analysis of the currently popular paradigm...|$|E

Sometimes people believe such sequences will continue (the ‘‘hot hand”), and sometimes people {{believe they will}} reverse (the ‘‘gambler’s fallacy”). These contradictory intuitions can be partly explained by considering the perceived intentionality of the agent generating the streak. The intuition that streaks will continue (reverse) should emerge in contexts involving agents that {{are perceived to be}} intentional (unintentional), and should be most common among those who are most inclined to attribute intentions to other agents. Four studies support these predictions, identifying both situational and dispositional determi-nants of the perceived continuity of streaks. Discussion focuses on the foundational nature of intentionality for perceptions of interdependence between events, the relationship between these findings and existing theoretical accounts, and the inverse possibility that people use perceptions of <b>streakiness</b> as a cue for an agent’s intentionality. 2010 Elsevier B.

40|$|Despite the {{conventional}} wisdom among players and fans {{of the existence of}} the “hot hand” in basketball, studies have found only no evidence or weak evidence for the hot hand in game situations, although stronger evidence in controlled settings. These studies have considered both free throws and field goals. Given the heterogeneous nature of field goals and several potential sources that could cause a positive or negative correlation between consecutive shots (such as having a weak defender), free throws may provide for a more controlled setting to test for the hot hand. Almost all studies have tested for the hot hand at the individual level in univariate frameworks, and as some have pointed out, the studies may not have had enough power to detect the hot hand. In this study, I use a sample based on every free throw attempted during the 2005 - 06 NBA season. I used a multivariate framework with individual player fixed effects.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that changes in shot difficulty may have rendered the hot-hand effect in basketball unobservable and are potentially a result of defensive adjustments. However, it has not been directly analysed whether strategic changes indeed take place in response to <b>streakiness</b> and whether they are effective with respect to winning games. The current work consists of an experimental study with 18 professional coaches and 20 players based on video sequences from National Basketball Association games, where the shown player displayed a streaky performance in half of the sequences. While coaches were asked to devise a defensive strategy after each viewed sequence, players had to assume the role of the shown player and decide whether to shoot or pass the ball. We find that coaches tended to increase the defensive pressure significantly more often on presumably hot players and thus make use of the hot-hand heuristic. Meanwhile, players chose to shoot more frequently in low-pressure and streaky situations but selected "pass" regardless of the previous performance when they faced increased defensive pressure. Assuming that a streaky player's performance is indeed elevated during hot phases, hot-hand behaviour can be considered adaptive in certain situations as it led hot players to pass instead of shoot...|$|E
40|$|The {{hydrodynamic}} {{response of}} the inviscid small shearing box model of a midplane section of a rotationally supported astrophysical disk is considered. We consider comparatively the predictions to disturbances subject to different boundary conditions. All linear disturbances subject to shearing boundary conditions decay algebraically at long times {{and the quality of}} the decay, whether monotonic or oscillatory, depends on whether the parameter Sigma, defined as a function of the disturbance's vertical and azimuthal wavelengths as well as the background linear shear, is greater or less than 1. These observations agree with recent published results. There is also short time growth of flow quantities and the degree of this growth depends directly on the streamwise <b>streakiness</b> of the mode. Linear disturbances subject to channel boundary conditions have normal-modes exhibiting inertial oscillations if Sigma > 1 - otherwise disturbances must in general be treated as an initial value problem. An energy functional E can also be formulated for the general nonlinear problem irrespective of the boundary conditions employed. It is found that the fate of disturbances is related to the conservation of this quantity which depends on the boundary conditions utilized. We relate these results and their implications to the question of nonlinear activity in such flows...|$|E
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of bursting, in which streaks in turbulent boundary layers oscillate and then eject low-speed fluid {{away from the}} wall, has been studied experimentally, theoretically and computationally for more than 50 years because of its importance to the three-dimensional structure of turbulent boundary layers. Five new threedimensional solutions of turbulent plane Couette flow are produced, {{one of which is}} periodic while the other four are relative periodic. Each of these five solutions demonstrates the breakup and re-formation of near-wall coherent structures. Four of our solutions are periodic, but with drifts in the streamwise direction. More surprisingly, two of our solutions are periodic, but with drifts in the spanwise direction, a possibility that {{does not seem to have}} been considered in the literature. It is argued that a considerable part of the <b>streakiness</b> observed experimentally in the near-wall region could be due to spanwise drifts that accompany the breakup and re-formation of coherent structures. A new periodic solution of plane Couette flow is also computed that could be related to transition to turbulence. The violent nature of the bursting phenomenon implies the need for good resolution in the computation of periodic and relative periodic solutions within turbulent shear flows. This computationally demanding requirement is addressed with a new algorithm for computing relative periodic solutions one of whose features is a combination of two well-known ideas – namely the Newton–Krylov iteration and the locally constrained optimal hook step.

40|$|The hot-hand phenomenon, {{according}} to which a player’s performance is significantly elevated during certain phases relative to the expected performance based on the player’s base rate, has left many researchers and fans in basketball puzzled: The vast majority of players, coaches and fans believe in its existence but statistical evidence supporting this belief has been scarce. It has frequently been argued that the hot hand in basketball is unobservable because of strategic adjustments and defensive interference of the opposing team. We use a dataset with novel metrics, such {{as the number of}} defenders and the defensive intensity for each shot attempt, which enable us to directly measure defensive pressure. First, we examine how the shooting percentage of NBA players changes relative to the attributes of each metric. We find that it is of lesser importance by how many defenders a player is guarded but that defensive intensity, e. g., whether a defender raises his hand when his opponent shoots, has a larger impact on shot difficulty. Second, we explore how the underlying metrics and shooting accuracy change as a function of streak length. Our results indicate that defensive pressure and shot difficulty increase (decrease) during hot (cold) streaks, so that defenders seem to behave {{according to}} the hot-hand belief and try to force hot players into more difficult shots. However, we find that shooting percentages of presumably hot players do not increase and that shooting performance is not related to <b>streakiness,</b> so that the defenders ’ hot-hand behavior cannot be considered ecologically rational. Therefore, we are unable to find evidence in favor of the hot-hand effect even when accounting for defensive pressure...|$|E

The “dry-line ” at the cT/mT boundary is shown to be characterized by an extremely abrupt gradient of watervapor content and temperature, accompanied by a wind-shift zone with appreciable horizontal convergence. On the moist air side, there were pronounced wavelike perturbations in the nioisture and temperature fields, connected with systematic variations of the vector wind velocity. Special pilot-balloon observations show the low-level jet as a flat sheet of southerly winds, with maximum strength generally 300 to 500 m. above ground, and illustrate the great variations of wind speed associated with diurnal variability of stability in the surface layers. Appreciable <b>streakiness</b> of the velocity field is indicated by both pibal and aircraft measurements. A description is given {{of a series of}} intense low-pressure systems observed at the surface, in association with the northwest sides of radar echoes. These depressions, which form at night, are warm and very dry relative to their surroundings, and are attended by strong, gusty surface winds. High-level aircraft observations are illustrated, demonstrating particularly the significant disturbances of the wind field around cloud tops. An example of gust measurements in the upper portion of a thunderstorm (imbedded in strong vertical shear) shows that the lateral gust components, up to 30 m. /sec., are of the same order as the vertical gusts. Movements of thunderstorms as shown by radar, and certain aspects of the reflectivities of tornado-bearing storms, are discussed briefly.

METHODS: In this prospective study, nasopharyngeal aspirates {{were taken from}} children aged < 18 years with symptoms of acute respiratory infection admitted to Queen Mary Hospital on one fixed {{day of the week}} during August 2001 -July 2002 for detection of common respiratory viruses by immunofluorescence, viral culture, and for rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, and coronaviruses by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The clinical features of rhinovirus infections were analyzed and hospitalization disease burden was estimated. RESULTS: Altogether 239 of the 426 nasopharyngeal aspirates (56. 1 %) were positive for respiratory viruses, including 151 patients with rhinovirus (35. 4 %). The median age was 2. 34 years. Upper respiratory infection, asthma exacerbation, pneumonia, and acute bronchiolitis were diagnosed in 44. 4 %, 19. 9 %, 11. 3 %, and 7. 9 %, respectively. The most common symptoms were cough (81. 5 %), runny nose (76. 8 %), and fever (68. 9 %). Shortness of breath, wheezes, and crepitation were present in 25. 8 %, 29. 1 %, and 18. 5 %, respectively. Fifty-five of 99 patients (55. 6 %) had chest radiographic abnormalities, most commonly perihilar <b>streakiness.</b> Children with chronic diseases {{were more likely to have}} lower respiratory tract infection and these children required longer hospitalization (mean 0. 6 days longer).

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] In {{tropical}} Africa {{the role}} of microbial agents of acute respiratory infections in acute exacerbations of bronchial asthma remains largely unexplored. However, empirical antibacterial therapy is frequently initiated in moderate to severe cases of acute asthma with symptoms of acute respiratory infection. A study {{was set up to}} determine how often acute respiratory infection is associated with acute asthma, to identify the associated pathogens, and to proffer appropriate therapeutic suggestions. METHODS [...] Over a 16 month period, 86 episodes of acute asthma were studied for clinical and laboratory features of acute respiratory infection at the University College Hospital (UCH), Ibadan. Virological diagnosis was based on immunofluorescence studies of nasopharyngeal aspirates and/or serological tests using the microtitre complement fixation technique. Throat swabs and blood were cultured for bacterial agents. RESULTS [...] Of the 64 cases who presented with rhinorrhoea, 51 (79. 7 %) were pyrexial (T > or = 37. 6 degrees C). Inflammatory changes (frequently interstitial <b>streakiness)</b> were identified in 10 (19. 6 %) of the 51 chest radiographs; only two of these had lobar shadowing. Significant bacterial isolates were made in only three (3. 5 %) of the throat swabs and two (2. 4 %) of the blood cultures from the 86 cases; none had clinical septicaemia. On the other hand, 55 viral agents were identified from 39 (53 %) of the 74 subjects studied; 16 (41. 0 %) had dual viral identifications. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) accounted for 20 (36. 4 %) identifications, parainfluenza virus (PIV) type 3 for 15 (27. 3 %), and influenza type A (Flu A) for 12 (21. 8 %). Viral identifications were significantly higher in infants and preschool subjects (< 5 years) and in those presenting with either rhinorrhoea or pyrexia. CONCLUSIONS [...] The results of this study underscore the importance of viral upper respiratory infections in asthma exacerbations in a tropical setting. The paucity of clinical and investigative features of bacterial acute respiratory infection suggests that there is little rationale for routine antibiotic cover in children with acute exacerbations of asthma in the tropics...|$|E
40|$|The {{spatial and}} orientational {{behaviour}} of fibres within a suspension influences the rheological and mechanical properties of that suspension. An Eulerian-Lagrangian framework {{to simulate the}} behaviour of fibres in turbulent flows is presented. The framework is intended for use in simulations of nonspherical particles with high Reynolds numbers, beyond the Stokesian regime, and is a computationally efficient alternative to existing Stokesian models for fibre suspensions in turbulent flow. It is based on modifying available empirical drag correlations for the translation of non-spherical particles to be orientation dependent, accounting for the departure in shape from a sphere. The orientational dynamics of a particle {{is based on the}} framework of quaternions, while its rotational dynamics is obtained from the solution of the Euler equation of rotation subject to external torques on the particle. The fluid velocity and turbulence quantities are obtained using a very high-resolution large eddy simulation with dynamic calibration of the sub-grid scale energy containing fluid motions. The simulation matrix consists of four different fibre Stokes numbers (St = 1, 5, 25 and 125) and five different fibre aspect ratios (λ = 1. 001, 3, 10, 30 and 50), with results considered at four distances from a channel wall (in the viscous sublayer, buffer and fully turbulent regions), which are taken as a measure of the flow velocity gradient, all at a constant fibre to fluid density ratio (ρp/ρ = 760) and shear Reynolds number Reτ = 150. The simulated fibre orientation, concentration and <b>streakiness</b> confirms previous experimentally observed characteristics of fibre behaviour in turbulence, and that of direct numerical simulations of fibres in Stokesian, or creeping flow, regimes. The fibres exhibit translational motion similar to spheres, where they tend to accumulate in the near-wall (viscous sub-layer and buffer) region and preferentially concentrate in regions of low-speed streaks. The current results further demonstrate that the fibres’ translational dynamics, in terms of preferential concentration, is strongly dependent on their inertia and less so on their aspect ratio. However, the contrary is the case for the fibre alignment distribution as this is strongly dependent on the fibre aspect ratio and velocity gradient, and only moderately dependent on particle inertia. The fibre alignment with the flow direction is found to be mostly anisotropic where the velocity gradient is large (i. e. viscous sub-layer and buffer regions), but is virtually non-existent and isotropic where the turbulence is near-isotropic (i. e. channel centre). The present investigation highlights that the level of fibre alignment with the flow direction reduces as a fibre’s inertia decreases, and as the shape of the fibre approaches that of a sphere. Short fibres, and especially near-spherical λ  1. 001 particles, are found to exhibit isotropic orientation with respect to all directions, whilst sufficiently long fibres align themselves parallel to the flow direction, and orthogonal to the other two co-ordinate directions, and the vorticity and flow velocity gradient directions...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{orientation}} of macro-sized fibres in turbulent flows is studied, {{as well as the}} effect of nano-sized fibrils on hydrodynamic stability. The focus lies on enabling processes for new materials where cellulose is the main constituent. When fibres (or any elongated particles) are added to a fluid, the complexity of the flow-problem increases. The fluid flow will influence the rotation of the fibres, and therefore also effect the overall fibre orientation. Exactly how the fibres rotate depends to a large extent on the mean velocity gradient in the flow. In addition, when fibres are added to a suspending fluid, the total stress in the suspension will increase, resulting in an increased apparent viscosity. The increase in stress is related to the direction of deformation in relation to {{the orientation of}} the particle, i. e. whether the deformation happens along the long or short axis of the fibre. The increase in stress, which in most cases is not constant neither in time nor space, will in turn influence the flow. This thesis starts off with the orientation and spatial distribution of fibres in the turbulent flow down an inclined plate. By varying fibre and flow parameters it is discovered that the main parameter controlling the orientation distribution is the aspect ratio of the fibres, with only minor influences from the other parameters. Moreover, the fibres are found to agglomerate into streamwise streaks. A new method to quantify this agglomeration is developed, taking care of the problems that arise due to the low concentration in the experiments. It is found that <b>streakiness,</b> i. e. the tendency to agglomerate in streaks, varies with Reynolds number. Going from fibre orientation to flow dynamics of fibre suspensions, the influence of cellulose nanofibrils (CNF) on laminar/turbulent transition is investigated in three different setups, namely plane channel flow, curved-rotating channel flow, and the flow in a flow focusing device. This last flow case is selected since it is can be used for assembly of CNF based materials. In the plane channel flow, the addition of CNF delays the transition more than predicted from measured viscosities while in the curved-rotating channel the opposite effect is discovered. This is qualitatively confirmed by linear stability analyses. Moreover, a transient growth analysis in the plane channel reveals an increase in streamwise wavenumber with increasing concentration of CNF. In the flow focusing device, i. e. at the intersection of three inlets and one outlet, the transition is found to mainly depend on the Reynolds number of the side flow. Recirculation zones forming downstream of two sharp corners are hypothesised to be the cause of the transition. With that in mind, the two corners are given a larger radius in an attempt to stabilise the flow. However, if anything, the flow seems to become unstable at a smaller Reynolds number, indicating that the separation bubble is not the sole cause of the transition. The choice of fluid in the core flow is found to have no effect on the stability, neither when using fluids with different viscosities nor when a non-Newtonian CNF dispersion was used. Thus, Newtonian model fluids can be used when studying the flow dynamics in this type of device. As a proof of concept, a flow focusing device is used to produce a continuous film from CNF. The fibrils are believed to be aligned due to the extensional flow created in the setup, resulting in a transparent film, with an estimated thickness of 1 um. QC 20141003 </p...|$|E
