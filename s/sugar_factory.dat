5|$|Remains of Pennatomys nivalis {{come from}} several Amerindian archeological sites {{on each of}} the three islands where it has been found; it was eaten by the native Amerindian population. The oldest site is Hichmans' Shell Heap on Nevis, which is from the Archaic age and is dated to 790 to 520BCE. The youngest, Sulphur Ghaut (900–1200 CE), is also on Nevis, and is from the post-Saladoid period. Other sites on Nevis include Hichmans (Saladoid, 100 BCE – 600 CE), Indian Castle (post-Saladoid, 650–880 CE), and Coconut Walk (post-Saladoid, no {{absolute}} dates known). The only site on Sint Eustatius is the Saladoid and post-Saladoid site Golden Rock (80 BCE – 980 CE).

40|$|There {{is a need}} {{to upgrade}} the Combined Heat and Power (CHP) systems of our local cane <b>sugar</b> <b>factories</b> in view of {{generating}} more electricity from bagasse. The local <b>sugar</b> <b>factories</b> require some 450 - 500 kg of steam / t of cane for sugar processing, and it actually generates about 20 kWh/tc (based on total cane production) for export to the national grid. By lowering the process of steam consumption and by adopting new technologies, it is possible to increase electricity production from the local <b>sugar</b> <b>factories.</b> This paper looks at the measures which all the <b>sugar</b> <b>factories</b> should adopt to improve the performance of their CHP systems...|$|R
5|$|Jacob Borch {{constructed}} Liebe House in 1804 on {{the site}} next to the <b>sugar</b> <b>factory.</b> It replaced a modest house with timber framing and a straw roof dating from the 17th century. The building {{takes its name from}} the Liebe family who owned the property for two generations later in the century. On the occasion of his death in 1900, Liebe left the entire building complex to Roskilde Municipality. In 1908, the Sugar House came into use as a fire station. Roskilde Local History Museum was founded on 12 November 1929 {{on the ground floor of}} the Liebe House. When the fire station moved to new premises in 1989, Roskilde Museum took over the Sugar House. The museum has exhibits from prehistory, through the Viking Era and the Middle Ages to modern times. The Museum of Tools, housed in separate premises, contains a collection of tools used by craftsmen such as wheelrights, carpenters, shoemakers and wood carvers from around 1850 to 1950.|$|E
5|$|Production {{moved to}} the Czech Republic later in May, {{scheduled}} for 12 weeks of shooting, which included a scene in Pernštejn Castle. Using a former <b>sugar</b> <b>factory</b> in Prague, production designer John Myhre constructed a large textile factory {{as part of an}} industrial world, the setting of a mythological environment in which looms create fabrics that weavers interpret as assassination orders. Afterward, filming moved to Budapest, then returned to Chicago in August. While the actors performed many of their own stunts, with free running and parkour in some of the action scenes, and Angelina Jolie being actually strapped to the hood of a moving Dodge Viper, some of the especially high-risk sequences required digital doubles instead. Two full-sized train cars were built, a Chicago 'L' for a training scene where Fox and Wesley run atop a train, and a Czech Pendolino for the derailment, which was stationed in a gimbal equipped with hydraulics to allow the car to tilt and roll as the train crashed. The film originally had both an alternate opening and an alternate ending. The alternate opening, a flashback to ancient times describing the history of the Fraternity and the Loom of Fate, is available on the special edition DVD and Blu-ray.|$|E
