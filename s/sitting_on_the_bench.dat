5|$|As the town, where Hamasaki is <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bench,</b> {{starts to}} rain, the {{atmosphere}} where Hamasaki is the doll starts to rain as well. Just after Hamasaki finishes singing the second chorus, an instrumental break happens and has Hamasaki {{looking at the}} now abandoned puppet show. A truck then drives past, which vibrates the puppet show's stage, causing the doll to fall {{on the ground and}} its strings become tangled. This happens to Hamasaki as the doll; she faints in the dark atmosphere land, with strings attached to her. Hamasaki, <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bench,</b> starts to cry and sings the remaining of the song. It ends with the taxi driver, who finishes day dreaming about the marionettes dolls, opening the door for Hamasaki to enter.|$|E

5|$|When the Anteaters {{defeated}} the Washington Huskies men's basketball team on November 14, 2013, N'Diaye recorded a season-high 18 points. He also added 8 rebounds and 9 blocks. The game was also his first {{experience in the}} 2K Sports Classic. His blocked shots total broke the school's single-game record under the category. He recorded his first career double-double with Irvine on December 28, 2013 against Arizona State, with 12 points, 4 blocks, and a career-high 12 rebounds. In January, in a game at rival Long Beach State, coach Dan Monson told reporters that he believed his team was still afraid to attack the paint even when N'Diaye was <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bench.</b> In early February, N'Diaye broke the school's single-game block record {{for the second time}} in the season, totaling with 11 blocked shots and 10 rebounds against Long Beach State. N'Diaye also broke the conference's all-time record. It was his first career game in which he recorded a double-double without scoring over ten points.|$|E

25|$|In {{professional}} ice hockey, the back-up goaltender fills {{an important}} team role. Although the back-up will spend most games <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bench,</b> the back-up {{must be prepared}} to play every game. A back-up may be forced into duty at any time to relieve the starting goaltender {{in the event of an}} injury or poor game performance. The back-up will also be called upon to start some games to give the starter the opportunity to rest from game-play during the season.|$|E

Although his health prevented his <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bench</b> after 1792, he held the post until he died on January 23, 1795, aged 54, at his home in Durham. He was interred in the family cemetery there.|$|E

25|$|Worth noting in {{a regular}} season meeting between the two rivals in April 2007, a game which the Spurs won 91–86, Tim Duncan {{suffered}} his first career ejection for supposedly laughing while <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bench.</b> Joey Crawford, the referee who ejected Duncan, allegedly asked Duncan to a fight {{which led to the}} longtime ref's season-ending suspension. As Duncan was heading into the locker room, American Airlines Center erupted into a huge cheer, applauding Duncan's ejection. The game saw chippy play, with Jerry Stackhouse and Manu Ginóbili getting into an altercation after a rebound.|$|E
25|$|On April 3, 2009, Scottish {{football}} players Barry Ferguson and Allan McGregor were permanently {{banned from the}} Scottish national squad for showing the V sign while <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bench</b> during the game against Iceland. Both players were in their hotel bar drinking alcohol after the Scottish defeat to The Netherlands until around 11am the next morning, meaning that both of the players breached the SFA discipline code before the incident as well, but the attitude shown by the V sign {{was considered to be}} so rude that the SFA decided never to include these players in the national line-up again. Ferguson also lost the captaincy of Rangers {{as a result of the}} controversy. McGregor's ban was lifted by then SFA manager Craig Levein and he returned to Scotland national squad in 2010.|$|E
25|$|Prior to Bracton, {{there was}} little use of stare decisis. This was because the rolls {{containing}} the court records were largely unavailable for scrutiny, even by judges <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bench.</b> Bracton's use of the rolls led to promulgation of recorded cases {{in the form of}} a gloss. This had been an important innovation based on the glossator's practice from the Continent. The availability of previous decisions, even if 20 or more years old proved to be of great interest to nearly all practitioners of the law. This led directly to the Year Books. A single unique decision did not make precedent. Custom began to be dictated when several cases of similar fact pattern were decided by different courts in the same way. This was the beginning of stare decisis.|$|E

25|$|Beckham {{missed the}} next four LA Galaxy matches – three in the North American SuperLiga and an MLS game away at Toronto FC though he still made the trip with his teammates, <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bench</b> in street clothes. It was in Toronto on 5 August that the team got its first taste of what life would be like {{on the road with}} Beckham on the roster. Due to {{security}} concerns, {{it was the first time}} the team flew on a charter for a road match, rather than flying commercial (MLS normally forbids charter flights for away matches, claiming they provide competitive advantage, but in this case they made an exception due to the frenzy created around Beckham and resulting security issues). Also, instead of the usual MLS-mandated modest hotels, LA Galaxy stayed at the five-star Le Méridien King Edward in downtown Toronto (an expense paid for by the local Toronto promoter), while the glitz and glamour continued with the velvet rope, red carpet party at the Ultra Supper Club with Beckham as the centerpiece guest.|$|E
25|$|In , {{the rivalry}} hit {{an all-time high}} when Darcy Tucker {{attacked}} the Senators' Chris Neil, who was <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bench.</b> This resulted in numerous players exchanging punches before order was restored. Tucker, Neil and Shane Hnidy all received fighting majors and game misconducts for the same incident. After the game, Tucker claimed Neil spit on him, an allegation which Neil denied. The NHL board looked into this claim and concluded that Tucker's allegation was false. Tempers remained frayed, especially with 1:23 to play, when Toronto's Tie Domi went after Magnus Arvedson and threw several punches at Arvedson. Video evidence showed Arvedson spearing Domi just prior, awaiting the faceoff. Domi received a roughing minor, instigator minor, fighting major, misconduct and game misconduct. Arvedson {{did not get a}} penalty on the play. Suspensions were announced a few hours after Tucker and Domi appeared at NHL head offices in Toronto for a hearing. Tucker was suspended for five games, without pay, after it was determined that Neil did not spit at Toronto's bench. Domi was suspended for three games, also without pay. A total of 163 minutes in penalties were called in the game.|$|E

500|$|A {{first-round pick}} from Morris Brown College by the Green Bay Packers in 1977, Johnson {{was known as}} one of the best {{defensive}} linemen in his first few years in the league.

(Quarterback sacks were not an official NFL statistic until 1982.) [...] However, by 1981, Johnson's career was marred by a series of back injuries and allegations of his lack of discipline on the field, including one incident in which he ate a hot dog while <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bench</b> during a preseason game, and being inconsistent at times. He lost and regained his starting job multiple times during that period.|$|E
500|$|His {{elevation}} came {{despite his}} known opposition to apartheid. South Africa's National Party government occasionally promoted [...] "opposition" [...] barristers to the Supreme Court Bench {{to demonstrate its}} claimed commitment to an independent judiciary and to confer legitimacy on the system through the presence of judges who enjoyed a reputation for independence and integrity. This raised obvious moral issues for Goldstone – as a judge, he {{would be expected to}} uphold South Africa's apartheid laws. Some eminent lawyers did refuse to become judges, but liberal lawyers had already served as judges; throughout the apartheid era, no one <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bench</b> had ever resigned for overtly political reasons. Goldstone sought the advice of prominent anti-apartheid lawyers, who urged him to take up the position on the basis that he could do more to undermine apartheid as a judge working within the system than as an attorney working on the outside.|$|E
500|$|<b>Sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bench</b> as {{the game}} entered the final minute of play, Henderson [...] "had a feeling" [...] that he could score.

Rushing into the Soviet zone, Henderson missed a pass from Yvan Cournoyer {{in front of the}} net and was tripped by a Soviet defenceman. [...] As he got to his feet, Phil Esposito recovered the puck and sent it towards Henderson in front of the net. The first shot was stopped by Vladislav Tretiak, but Henderson recovered the rebound and slid it past the fallen goaltender to give Canada a 6–5 lead with only 34 seconds left to play. [...] It was his seventh goal of the tournament, tying him for the series lead with Esposito and Alexander Yakushev. The goal won the game, and the series, for Canada. [...] The team returned home to massive crowds in Montreal and Toronto, and Paul Henderson had become a national hero.|$|E

The window sill was a stage, with <b>the</b> audience <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>benches,</b> which were usually in front of the washing machines. In the show's original version, Deuser stood on a platform next to tumble dryers. Often, unsuspecting customers or passers-byers were incorporated into the program with a comedian.|$|R
