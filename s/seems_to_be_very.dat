25|$|Though {{scholars}} {{may differ}} in their interpretation of text, the central idea <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> clear. Sonnet 126 deals with a marked lapse of time and leads the reader {{to the realization that}} the relationship between author and subject has continued on for years but has now begun to wane or fizzle out. Ramsey too believes that the central idea rests in the reality of the natural relation that must be paid and the truth that must be faced by the author. Through these words, it is divulged that love changes; beauty passes; and men die.|$|E
25|$|Workers {{lower in}} the {{hierarchy}} forage individually for food items on the substrate and do not recruit other nestmates to assist with food transport. Although foraging workers do not recruit nestmates, Nascimento et al. (2012) found a positive feedback between incoming food and stimulation of new foragers as well as task partitioning once food was brought into the nest. Lower ranking females processed protein resources while higher ranking females handled small food pieces and distributed them to the larvae. Fourcassié & Oliviera (2002) found Dinoponera gigantea foraging to be concentrated {{in the early morning}} and afternoon but did not sample at night. Morgan (1993) observed the highest activity at night in Dinoponera longipes. Dinoponera quadriceps has a marked seasonal pattern in activity. It is most active in May–August, the late rainy season to early dry season in the semiarid Caatinga. Activity was strongly negatively correlated to temperature and positively correlated to prey abundance. The diets of both Dinoponera gigantea and Dinoponera quadriceps {{have been shown to be}} predominantly scavenged invertebrates, but include live prey, seeds and fruits. Araújo & Rodrigues (2006) state that the taxonomic diversity of prey is comparable to other tropical ponerines, but has an optimal prey size of 2–3cm in Dinoponera. Diet <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> similar across the genus, regardless of habitat.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{prevalence}} and devastation of ant attacks, M. drewseni {{has developed a}} way to protect themselves, but mainly their brood, from their predators. Females have a gland on their gaster that secretes a liquid; females are commonly seen rubbing their gaster along the stem of the nest. This secretion, which is spread on the stem, then, somehow prevents ants from climbing on the stem to reach the nest and the brood. In experiments, when ants {{come in contact with}} this secretion, they have a violent reaction and retract away from the secretion, suggesting that it is a chemical repellant of sorts. In addition, the structure of the nest itself and the morphology of the wasp seems to support a co-evolution of this defensive mechanism. The length of the stem separates the nest from any place that an ant would be. In addition, the elongated first abdominal piece of the wasp serves to allow the secretion to be spread over the whole stem, whose narrow diameter makes secretions economical. This system of defense is also very practical because it allows the female to forage and leave the brood unattended without putting them at risk. This repellant <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> effective with some ants, but not strong enough to derail army ants, as they travel in huge groups.|$|E

He continues to appear under this guise throughout the second season, only revealing his beard to be fake in the finale. M. C.

The producers describe Tom as [...] "friendly", earning him the nickname [...] "Mr. Friendly". One critic has described him as [...] "sarcastic" [...] and [...] "bright". Tom's dislike of blood causes him to struggle while supervising Ben's operation, which Emerson believes makes him [...] "cuddly". Gainey does not think he is very similar to Tom, commenting, [...] "He <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> loyal and I'm a very loyal person so I have that in common, but other than that, I don't really know what he's about. He seems much more socially awkward than I am." [...] After Tom was revealed to be gay during season four, M. C. Gainey stated that [...] "anytime you've got a group of people, somebody's got to be marching to a different drummer- that would be Tom Friendly." ...|$|E

2500|$|There is no {{difficulty}} whatsoever in obtaining models of static spherically symmetric stellar models, {{in which a}} perfect fluid interior is matched across a spherical surface, {{the surface of the}} star, to a vacuum exterior which is in fact a region of the Schwarzschild vacuum. [...] In fact, it is possible to write down all these static stellar models in a way which makes clear that they exist in plenitude. [...] Given this success, it may come as a nasty shock that it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> difficult, mathematically speaking, to construct rotating stellar models in which a perfect fluid interior is matched to an asymptotically flat vacuum exterior.

2500|$|The {{coelacanths}} which {{live near}} Sodwana Bay, South Africa, rest in caves at depths of 90 to 150 m during daylight hours, but disperse and swim to depths as shallow as 55 m when hunting at night. The depth {{is not as}} important as their need for very dim light and, more importantly, for water which has a temperature of 14 to 22°C. [...] They will rise or sink to find these conditions. The amount of oxygen their blood can absorb from the water through the gills is dependent on water temperature. [...] Scientific research suggests the coelacanth must stay in cold, well-oxygenated water or else its blood cannot absorb enough oxygen.

2500|$|Athena was {{originally}} the Aegean goddess of the palace, {{who presided over}} household crafts and protected the king. A single Mycenaean Greek inscription [...] a-ta-na po-ti-ni-ja /Athana potnia/ appears at Knossos in the Linear B tablets from the Late Minoan II-era [...] "Room of the Chariot Tablets"; these comprise the earliest Linear B archive anywhere. Although Athana potnia often is translated Mistress Athena, it could also mean [...] "the Potnia of Athana", and thus perhaps the Lady of Athens. However, any connection {{to the city of}} Athens in the Knossos inscription is uncertain. In the still undeciphered corpus of Linear A tablets—written in the unclassified Minoan language—a sign series a-ta-no-dju-wa-ja is to be found. This could be connected with the Linear B Mycenaean expressions a-ta-na po-ti-ni-ja and di-u-ja or di-wi-ja (Diwia, [...] "of Zeus" [...] or, possibly, related to a homonymous goddess), resulting in a translation [...] "Athena of Zeus" [...] or [...] "divine Athena". Similarly, in the Greek mythology and epic tradition, Athena figures as a daughter of Zeus (Διός θυγάτηρ; cfr. Dyeus). However, the inscription quoted <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> similar to [...] "a-ta-nū-tī wa-ya", quoted as SY Za 1 by Jan Best. Best translates the initial a-ta-nū-tī, which is recurrent in line beginnings, as [...] "I have given".|$|E
2500|$|The common {{intention}} of these {{several types of}} experiments is to first do something that, some interpretations of theory say, would make each photon [...] "decide" [...] whether {{it was going to}} behave as a particle or behave as a wave, and then, before the photon had time to reach the detection device, create another change in the system that would make it seem that the photon had [...] "chosen" [...] to behave in the opposite way. Some interpreters of these experiments contend that a photon either is a wave or is a particle, and that it cannot be both at the same time. Wheeler's intent was to investigate the time-related conditions under which a photon makes this transition between alleged states of being. His work has been productive of many revealing experiments. He may not have anticipated the possibility that other researchers would tend toward the conclusion that a photon retains both its [...] "wave nature" [...] and [...] "particle nature" [...] until the time it ends its life, e.g., by being absorbed by an electron which acquires its energy and therefore rises to a higher-energy orbital in its atom.
