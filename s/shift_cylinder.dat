50|$|Multiple-tune {{cylinders}} {{have more}} than one set of pins intertwined on the same cylinder, with, for example, the B pins for a second song lying halfway between the B and C pins of the first song, etc. Offsetting the cylinder slightly relative to the comb brings the different set of pins into contact with the teeth, thereby playing an alternate piece of music. Many modern music boxes will have as many as four sets of pins intertwined, with a mechanism automatically <b>shifting</b> the <b>cylinder</b> from one song or movement to the next.|$|R
50|$|Air pilot control: {{converting}} {{from air}} to oil results in locking of the <b>cylinder.</b> <b>Shifting</b> the four-way valve to either extreme position applies the air pilot through the shuttle valve, holding the two air-operated valves open and applying oil under air {{pressure to the}} corresponding side of the cylinder. Positioning a manual valve to neutral exhausts the air pilot pressure, closing the two-way valves, and trapping oil {{on both sides of}} the cylinder to lock it in position.|$|R

We consider the rapidity shift at the longitudinal direction in the geometrical picture of the collisions. The calculated results are in agreement with the experimental data.

50|$|In {{fractured}} rock, shielded {{hard rock}} TBMs can be used, which erect concrete segments to support unstable tunnel walls behind the machine. Double Shield TBMs have two modes; in stable ground they grip the tunnel walls to advance. In unstable, fractured ground, the thrust is <b>shifted</b> to thrust <b>cylinders</b> that push against the tunnel segments behind the machine. This keeps the thrust forces from impacting fragile tunnel walls. Single Shield TBMs {{operate in the}} same way, but are used only in fractured ground, as they can only push against the concrete segments.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Synchronization {{torsion bar}} {{is a key}} part in {{independent}} and dependent impression mechanism which ensures synchronization motion {{at both ends of}} blanket cylinder. Due to frequent action of the mechanism in high-speed printing, synchronization torsion bar would cause huge impact torque so as to affect parallel <b>shifting</b> of blanket <b>cylinder</b> and uniformity of printing impression. Based on structure features and force of synchronization torsion bar, finite element model of synchronization torsion bar was established by adopting structural mechanics and finite element method, then static stiffness of synchronization torsion bar was solved by adopting principle of minimum potential energy. The result of computation shows that the maximum torsion deformation of torsion bar in X direction happens at the left connection point. Because the deformation is very small, the bar can meet the requirements that blanket cylinder...|$|R
40|$|In {{everyday}} life our reaching behaviour {{has to be}} guided {{not only by the}} location and properties of the target object, but also by the presence of potential obstacles in the workspace. Recent evidence from neglect and optic ataxia patients has suggested that this automatic obstacle avoidance is mediated by the dorsal, rather than the ventral, stream of visual processing. We tested this idea in two studies involving patients with visual form agnosia resulting from bilateral ventral-stream damage. In the first study, we asked patient DF to reach out and pick up a target object in the presence of obstacles placed at varying distances to the left or right of the target. We found that both DF and controls shifted their trajectories away from the potential obstacles and adjusted their grip aperture {{in such a way as}} to minimize risk of collision. In a second study, we asked DF and a second patient, SB, to either reach between, or to bisect the space between, two cylinders presented at varying locations. We found that both patients adjusted their reach trajectories to account for <b>shifts</b> in <b>cylinder</b> location in the reaching task, despite showing significantly worse performance than control subjects when asked to make a bisection judgement. Taken together, these data indicate that automatic obstacle avoidance behaviour is spared in our patients with visual form agnosia. We attribute their ability to the functional intactness of the dorsal stream of visual processing, and argue that the ventral stream plays no important role in automatic obstacle avoidance. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn cyanobacteria, {{photoprotection}} from overexcitation of photochemical centers can {{be obtained}} by excitation energy dissipation {{at the level of the}} phycobilisome (PBS), the cyanobacterial antenna, induced by the orange carotenoid protein (OCP). A single photoactivated OCP bound to the core of the PBS affords almost total energy dissipation. The precise mechanism of OCP energy dissipation is yet to be fully determined, and one question is how the carotenoid can approach any core phycocyanobilin chromophore at a distance that can promote efficient energy quenching. We have performed intersubunit cross-linking using glutaraldehyde of the OCP and PBS followed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS) to identify cross-linked residues. The only residues of the OCP that cross-link with the PBS are situated in the linker region, between the N- and C-terminal domains and a single C-terminal residue. These links have enabled us to construct a model of the site of OCP binding that differs from previous models. We suggest that the N-terminal domain of the OCP burrows tightly into the PBS while leaving the OCP C-terminal domain on the exterior of the complex. Further analysis shows that the position of the small core linker protein ApcC is <b>shifted</b> within the <b>cylinder</b> cavity, serving to stabilize the interaction between the OCP and the PBS. This is confirmed by a ΔApcC mutant. Penetration of the N-terminal domain can bring the OCP carotenoid to within 5 - 10 Å of core chromophores; however, alteration of the core structure may be the actual source of energy dissipation...|$|R
40|$|The binary polymer {{system of}} {{polystyrene}} and poly(n-pentyl methacrylate) was recently found to exhibit closed-loop type phase behavior. This {{is the first}} known example of a weakly interacting system exhibiting such a phase diagram. At atmospheric pressure the block copolymer displays both a lower disorder-to-order and upper-order-to-disorder transition, representing the lower and upper bounds of the closed-loop phase diagram. The application of hydrostatic pressure served to shrink the closed-loop, yielding pressure coefficients of the lower disorder-to-order and upper order-to-disorder transitions of 725 °C/kbar and - 725 °C/kbar respectively. These pressure coefficients were consistent with those calculated from the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, using the experimentally determined ΔHdisorder and ΔV disorder for each transition. The χeff determined from small angle neutron scattering (SANS) was found to decrease, pass through a minimum, increase to a maximum, and then decrease with increasing temperature. Swelling the system with carbon dioxide served to promote {{an expansion of the}} closed-loop. This was due to the entropic nature of both transitions, with differential dilation of the copolymer domains resulting in dissimilar compressibilities of the blocks. In addition to influencing block copolymer phase behavior, carbon dioxide can have a profound impact on resulting morphological structure. A 42 / 58 PS-b-PnPMA diblock copolymer was found to exhibit lamellar morphology at ambient pressures. With the application of 2500 psi carbon dioxide the morphology <b>shifted</b> to hexagonally-packed <b>cylinders</b> due to preferential absorption into the PnPMA block. Furthermore, the influence of carbon dioxide sorption on the morphology of the PS/poly(n-alkyl methacrylate) block copolymer series was studied both in thin films and in the bulk. ...|$|R
40|$|In this master thesis the {{validity}} of the independence principle(I. P) on an inclined infinite circular cylinder has been investigated. Normalized Reynolds numbers 150 and 1000 for inclination angles 0 °- 65 ° were studied. Themain objective was to investigate wake dynamics for an inclined circular cylinder that eventually lead to the break down of the independence principle. Reynolds number 150 has been the primary focus in this study. Wake behaviour, as well as individual velocity components, were investigated. The inclined circular cylinders were also compared to equivalent elliptic cylinders to improve the understanding of the limitations of the I. P. The simulations were carried out using the computer software MGLET, which solves the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on a staggered non-equidistant Cartesian grid. The infinite circular cylinder was modelled by periodic boundary conditions, and the body implemented by the use of an Immersed Boundary Method. Zonal grid and periodic boundary conditions on {{the top and bottom of}} the computational domain prohibits the use of an inclined circular cylinder. The inclination of the cylinder is therefore given by inclining the inflow and keeping the cylinder straight For Re_n = 150 the simulations resulted in a break down of the independence principle between 35 ° and 45 °. The break down is characterized by a deviation in the Strouhal number, as well as the lift coefficient. Measured flow quantities were normalized, and compared to the quantities of the normal flow in order to investigate {{the validity}} of the independence principle. For the pressure coefficient a deviation was only noticeable at angles larger than 45 °. This deviation could be caused by the transient effects associated with the breakdown of I. P. The drag coefficient seem to be well predicted by the I. P for all investigated angles at this Reynolds number. As the inclination angle increases the r. m. s of the lift coefficient, C_L, decreases in magnitude. The decrease is due to the increased three-dimensionality of the flow as the inclination angle is increased. v- and w-velocities are phase <b>shifted</b> behind the <b>cylinder</b> in the spanwise direction and no longer independent of z when the independence principle breaks down. This means that the vortices along the cylinder are not shed simultaneously, which contributes to the drop observed. The shedding angles on the vortex filaments were found to remain constant at an angle of 61 ° for angles where I. P was found invalid. This non-physically locked shedding angle is assumed to be caused by the periodic boundary conditions. When the flow becomes inclined the periodic boundary conditions do not account for the inclination. It is believed that the angle locking is due to the boundary condition being too stiff for this flow configuration. Flow around elliptic cylinders in normal flow equivalent to inclination angles 35 °- 65 ° were simulated. Good agreementwith the literature was achievedwhen verifying the results. Comparisons against the inclined circular cylinders resulted in the the ellipses in normal flow being unsuitable to represent inclined circular cylinders. This result is in agreement with the literature, and lack of three-dimensionality is to blame. For Re_n = 1000 the independence principle was found to be valid for all flow quantities, except the r. m. s lift coefficient, C_L, up to an inclination angle of 55 °. The deviation in C_L is suspected to be due to a combination of inclination angle and Reynolds number, for which both have been found to reduce the correlation length. Increased validity range for the independence principle is assumed to be caused by the boundary layer becoming thinner for increasing Reynolds number. The required simulation time has been evaluated by comparing contour lines for omega_z, by evaluating the differences visually. Simulation time was found sufficient for t = 300 s. Indications of locked shedding angles in the vortex filaments, as for Re_n = 150, were not found for this Reynolds number. Periodic boundary conditions are thus considered less stiff, and plausible as no indication of solution pollution is found...|$|R
