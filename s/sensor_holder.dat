30|$|In {{order to}} measure the film {{thickness}} and leakage rate, a <b>sensor</b> <b>holder</b> is fixed on the test stationary ring. An eddy current displacement sensor is installed on the holder by thread and a stainless steel sheet is fixed on the test rotor by super glue. The on-line measurement of gas film thickness is carried out by measuring the displacement change between the eddy current sensor and the sheet during testing. The leaking gas goes out from the leakage rate measurement hold on the <b>sensor</b> <b>holder,</b> connected to leakage rate sensor, a digital MEMS gas mass flow meter, through pipe. Pressurized seal gas provided by a low pressure air compressor flows into the seal chamber after filtered (filter precision is less than 1  μm) and dehumidified by tertiary filters, and the pressure of which is adjusted by a pressure value and measured by a pressure sensor. All the data (including {{the data from the}} pressure sensor, the speed control system, the eddy current sensor and the gas mass flow meter) collected from the sensors are fed into a data acquisition system and interfaced with a computer.|$|E

40|$|Small leaks in pipes cause huge {{losses of}} water, wasting {{the energy and}} money put into {{cleaning}} the water and pumping it {{to the point of}} the leak. Detecting these small leaks is currently not very accurate or practical to do over an entire system of pipes. A device is being developed which detects leaks from within the pipe using the drop in pressure at the point of a leak. This thesis addresses the geometric needs for deploying the sensors in the pipe. The housing for the device needs to navigate pipes while keeping the sensors close enough to the wall to get a good reading. The housing is made up of a frame with flexible cantilevers which <b>sensor</b> <b>holders</b> pivot about to stay flush with the wall. After looking at other devices which navigate pipes, the geometric constraints of the pipe were used to create an initial design. The first iteration was manufactured to check for validity of the design. Many changes have to be made to the design based on the results from manufacturing the first iteration. by Naomi W. Zabel.

They also examined the scope for simplifying, through recourse to digital systems, certain procedures used in endodontic treatment, namely the realisation, filing and management of radiographic images. The Visualix HDI, Denoptix, Trophy RVG 5 Gold, Trophy- Kodak RVG Ultimate, RVG Anthos DSX, and RVG Schick CDR digital systems were considered. A total of 138 examinations (74 using stiff sensors, 18 using Denoptix system phosphorus sensors, and 46 using conventional F speed film) were carried out. Similar projections of the examined teeth were used in all the examinations, both conventional and digital. Dental clamps were applied to the examined teeth in order to simulate digital clinical procedures. The possibility of using rigid sensors in the presence of different oral morphologies was evaluated. Conventional images and projections were compared qualitatively with digital ones. The visual definition of the apical third of 08 - 10 - 15 Kfiles, used in the digital examination of the root canal length of 17 extracted teeth, was also considered.

40|$|The {{velocities}} of propagating {{elastic waves}} {{can be used}} to determine the amount of damage in form of induced microcracks in rock materials and other materials. An increasing number of microcracks yields lower propagation velocities. To assess the damage, e. g. around tunnels caused by the excavation, is of interest since the damage affects the material properties, such as mechanical and thermal properties and permeability. A new ultrasonic testing system ULT- 100 from GCTS (Geotechnical Consulting and Testing Systems), aimed for measurement of p- and s-wave velocities, was evaluated. Reference cylindrical specimens in aluminium with different sizes were manufactured and a series of tests were conducted in order to find suitable wave arrival picking methods and to determine equipment specific constants which are needed to be determined. The procedure to do this was according to an ASTM standard. Expanded measurement uncertainties for the wave velocity measurements were calculated according to Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM). Equipment such as <b>sensor</b> <b>holders</b> and fixtures were manufactured {{in order to be able}} to conduct repeatable measurement on specimens. One test rig was made to carry out tests on nearly unloaded specimens in one direction and another was made for tests on axially loaded cylinders in a standard load frame with measurements in the axial plus two lateral directions. A Round Robin test was carried out on the three different types of testing equipment, one at SP, one at Swedish Cement and Concrete Research Institute (CBI), and one at Finnish Geological Survey (GTK) in Finland to evaluate the measurement results on p-wave velocity measurements. The results of the measurements were mainly in line with the calculated measurement uncertainties.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop and test in vitro an {{opto-electronic}} positioning device for serial direct digital images of oral structures, i. e. to associate direct digital imaging with the principles of computer-aided surgery. This system registered positions of infrared light emitting diodes (LED) on carriers, establishing local coordinate systems. With LED markers attached on the <b>sensor</b> <b>holder,</b> the X-ray tube and a fix reference, the opto-electronic camera (Optotrak®) registered the geometric source/detector relation. A specially designed tracking and guidance software was developed which enabled the operator to reposition the X-ray source. A graphical user interface guided the operator in aligning 2 circles to the reference axis, one indicating the origin of the beam, the other its tip. In addition, depth control was provided. An in vitro calibration was performed. A sensor holder/bite block carried the Sens-A-Ray® sensor with a hair-cross. In front of the object a second hair-cross was fixed. A steel ball fixed to the center of the X-ray cone allowed to verify the alignment. The mean angulation error in the vertical plane was 0. 06 ° and 0. 04 ° in the horizontal one. Translation mean errors were small and ranged between - 0. 02 mm and 0. 37 mm. The translation in the Z axis is negligible. This resulted in pairs of images suitable for digital subtraction. Although still in an experimental state, the results showed that opto-electronic navigation was useful to standardize projection geometry without any mechanical link and to achieve digital subtraction images based on direct digital imaging. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{focused on}} bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) measurements of Fagus sylvatica leaves, using {{a state of}} the art new multispectral Compact Laboratory Spectro-Gonioreflectometer (CLabSpeG). The BRDF was based on 4356 reflectance measurements covering the electromagnetic spectrum from 350 nm to 2500 nm. These measurements were acquired by independent positioning of the <b>sensor,</b> sample <b>holder,</b> and light source, with an azimuth and zenith resolution of 30 and 15 degrees, respectively. A series of BRDF data of leaves were collected using CLabSpeG in a limited acquisition time of 2 hours and 36 minutes. Data were collected from 12 leaves for two seven year old Fagus trees. Our methodology protocol focused on BRDF behavior and modeling of leaves. The primary research objective was to represent the nonlambertian state of leaf reflectance, while investigating which wavelengths produce a more profound reflectance effect at certain angular positions. The topological position of leaves in a tree was found to be significant in terms of BRDF variation, resulting in reflectance differences between varying leaf positions at certain wavelengths, especially in the visible domain. A reflectance change also was recorded during the BRDF measurements due to drying effects from the laboratory illumination source. Moreover, when goniometric changes are involved we found inadequate the collection of data in reflectance mode, due to sensor’s software rounding errors, and we suggest the use of raw digital number values...|$|R

40|$|Background and {{objective}} Magnetic Resonance Guided Focused Ultrasound (MRgFUS) for liver tumour ablation is a challenging task due to motion caused by breathing and occlusion due the ribcage between the transducer and the tumour. To overcome these challenges, a novel system for liver tumour ablation during free breathing has been designed. Methods The novel TRANS-FUSIMO Treatment System (TTS, EUFP 7) interacts with a Magnetic Resonance (MR) scanner and a focused ultrasound transducer to sonicate to {{a moving target}} in liver. To {{meet the requirements of}} ISO 13485; a quality management system for medical device design, the system needs to be tested for certain process parameters. The duration of sonication and, the delay after the sonication button is activated, are among the parameters that need to be quantified for efficient and safe ablation of tumour tissue. A novel methodology is developed to quantify these process parameters. A computerised scope is programmed in LabVIEW to collect data via hydrophone; where the coordinates of fiber-optic sensor assembly was fed into the TRANS-FUSIMO treatment software via Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to sonicate to the tip of the sensor, which is synchronised with the clock of the scope, embedded in a degassed water tank via <b>sensor</b> assembly <b>holder.</b> The sonications were executed for 50  W, 100  W, 150  W for 10 s to quantify the actual sonication duration and the delay after the emergency stop by two independent operators for thirty times. The deviation of the system from the predefined specs was calculated. Student's-T test was used to investigate the user dependency. Results The duration of sonication and the delay after the sonication were quantified successfully with the developed method. TTS can sonicate with a maximum deviation of 0. 16  s (Std 0. 32) from the planned duration and with a delay of 14  ms (Std 0. 14) for the emergency stop. Student's T tests indicate that the results do not depend on operators (p > . 05). Conclusion The evidence obtained via this protocol is crucial for translation- of-research into the clinics for safe application of MRgFUS.

40|$|Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) is {{commonly}} stored in highly pressurized cylinder tank {{and needs to}} be measured using a non-invasive way. This approach has been constructed to facilitate the process of LPG level measurement inside a cylinder tank. Currently, liquid level of LPG inside a cylinder is measured using a weighing scale. In this research, a new method is developed by using a non-invasive ultrasonic instrumentation system for monitoring LPG level in the 14 kilogram cylinder. The instrumentation system was integrated with the designed experimental rig. Module ultrasonic sensors Truma. LC-V 1. 15 were attached vertically outside of the cylinder wall on the <b>sensor</b> <b>holder</b> of the experimental rig. The ultrasonic sensors emit the ultrasonic signals and the signals will then propagate through the cylinder wall. The reflected signal was recorded again by the ultrasonic sensors. The reflection of the ultrasonic signal depends on the type of the medium's impedance.

The magnetic bearings are made of high temperature resistant permanent magnets (up to 1000 degrees F). A test rig has been developed to test these magnetic bearings. The test rig mainly consists of two radial bearings, one axial thrust bearing and two catcher bearings. The test rig that the catcher bearing is inserted in is the first ultra-high temperature rig with permanent magnet biased magnetic bearings and motor. The magnetic bearings are permanent magnet based which is a novel concept. The Graphalloy bearings represent a new approach for ultra-high temperature backup bearing applications.

Some assemblies and accessories required for the whole assembly need to be designed. The assembly methods need to be designed. The preliminary tests for coefficient of friction, Young's modulus and thermal expansion characteristics for catcher bearing material need to be done. A dynamic model needs to be designed for studying and simulating the rotor drop of the shaft onto the catcher bearing using a finite element approach in MATLAB.

This project is a feasibility study to investigate if existing material sensors {{can be used as a}} non-invasive, non-destructive method to help veterinaries/farriers getting a better knowledge of: 1. 	the exact location and extent of abscesses 2. 	the depth and length of cracks 3. 	the size of keratomes. The method is based on the ability of the hoof to conduct heat Utilizing the Hot Disk Sensors and method developed in ISO 22007 - 2, with a novel computational procedure, the variations of thermal conductivity versus depth from a surface can be measured. Sub-surface structural variations can be monitored in a non-destructive manner. Applications can be found in a range of areas. For instance, verifying homogeneity of structure versus depth. The <b>sensor,</b> and its <b>holder,</b> has approximately the shape and size of a stethoscope. It is thus an object that a farrier/veterinary can handle with ease. An area of about one square inch of the hoof is heated 1 - 2 degrees with a single step-wise heat pulse. The thermal depth of probing follows a relationship: = 2, Where d represents the thermal depth of probing (from the sensor position into the hoof), a represents the weighted average of the thermal diffusivity of the hoof (from the surface position to the position d), and t represents test time. Hence, the depth position can be determined for the different time positions. A typical time for measuring to a depth of 10 mm in a hoof capsule is 160 seconds. So far, tests in laboratory environment have established that the existing equipment works on the material that a hoof capsule consists of. Tests have been done on hoof capsules from dead horses, 3 D-printed model hooves and the hooves of one live horse at a veterinary clinic. All results are reproducible. Results show the curve of the thermal conductivity versus depth changing when the heat flow reaches a place where there is an inhomogeneity in the hoof. To conclude, tests indicate the method being able to detect inhomogeneities in hooves. Further measurements will be needed to show the exact response of different problems in the hooves. LP The method offers a possible new non-invasive, non-destructive method of finding the position and extent of abscesses, cracks and other inhomogeneities in hooves. The technique is well established in other areas of material studies, and based on the analysis of thermal convection and diffusion...|$|R
40|$|Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) are {{promising}} materials in nanofabricat ion, pharmacology, sensor devices, as anticorrosion material, and medica l implants. SAMs grow spontaneously onto surfaces from solution or the g as-phase. They are strongly {{bound to the}} surface and easily prepared whi ch make them {{one of the most important}} and broadly studied families of c omplexes. Schematically, SAM molecules contain three main parts: a head group responsible for binding of the molecule to the surface, a spacer r esponsible for molecular interactions and electronic conductivity, and a terminal functional group determining the surface properties. The forma tion of SAMs is driven by a complex, subtle balance between optimization of a metal-molecule bond, total coverage, intermolecular interactions, and the bending potential (for thiols corresponding to a C-S-Au angle wi th 180 &# 176; for sp-hybridization or 104 &# 176; for sp 3 -hybridization). The most po pular and well established group of SAMs remains thiols on a Au(111) sur face. However, recently selenol-based SAMs on a Au surface have gained m ore interest. In this work two examples of SAMs are considered: biphenyl-substituted a lkanethiols (CH 3 (C 6 H 4) 2 (CH 2) nSH, BPnS, n= 1 - 6), and &# 969;-(4 -methy lbiphenyl- 4 -yl) alkaneselenolates CH 3 (C 6 H 4) 2 (CH 2) nSe- (BPnSe, n = 1 - 6). Both types reveal pronounced odd-even effects with respe ct to the number of CH 2 units n in the spacer. Odd-even effects of BPnS (n= 1  6) have been broadly studied with many dif ferent techniques. Several odd-even effects were found for biphenyl thio ls such as staggering of packing density, thickness, inhomogeneity of ad sorption sites, thermal stability, tilt angle of the biphenyl moiety, su rface binding, and different orientation on Au(111) and Ag(111) surfaces. Also, the packing density was found to be higher for n-odd structures than for n&# 8209;even ones on Au(111) while this is opposite for Ag(111) surfaces. Most information about the parameters for biphenyl alkaneselenolates (BP nSe) is adopted from the thiol analogs. Scanning tunneling microscopy im ages show that BPnSe SAMs are well-ordered monolayers, with two types of structures depending on the number of alkyl units in the linker. The experimental capabilities of ion-sputtering based mass spectrometry allow performing an elemental, isotopic, and molecular examination of su rface material, even at low concentrations. Particle ejection occurs upo n primary ion irradiation and a subsequent collision cascade formation w ithin the target. Although the mechanism of sputtering of a material is fairly well known, desorption of molecules upon energetic projectile imp act remains largely unsolved because of the large variety of competing p rocesses involved. Ejection of intact molecules may occur only if they a re knocked by at least two target atoms at the same time. Additionally, the internal energy of a system must be sufficiently low in order to avo id fragmentation. There are two mechanisms for desorption of the molecul es: physical sputtering (collisional effect) and chemical sputtering (so -called thermal effect). Chemical sputtering is basically driven by chem ically induced reactions between the projectiles and target atoms and be cause of that the dynamic information of a surface can be provided. Because most of the sputtering material is neutral and detection of neut ral particles is difficult, additional ionization techniques are impleme nted. In combination with mass spectrometry, the technique is referred t o as Secondary Neutral Mass Spectrometry (SNMS). The most applied method involves laser photoionization. Photoionization may involve resonant or nonresonant transitions, although nowadays, schemes combining both ofte n are most convenient, i. e., resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI). Additionally, thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS) provides information about the thermodynamics of chemical reactions, as well as energetics o f molecules adsorbed at a surface. With this technique it is possible to monitor the decomposition of adsorbed material as function of temperatu re. All experiments were performed in a home-built, ultra-high vacuum (UHV), resonance ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (RIMS). Samples a re mounted on a home-designed sample holder, equipped with a heater and a resistance temperature <b>sensor.</b> The sample <b>holder</b> is introduced into a precision XYZ&# 952; manipulator, located in the center of the chamber, s urrounded by liquid nitrogen cooling tubes. The ion beam is directed to the sample under an incident angle of 45 &# 176; to the sample surface normal. The laser beam used for ionization is passing by the sample at a fixed 3. 5 mm distance from the surface. The desorption of thiol SAMs has been broadly studied in our group. One of the reasons that there has been a focus on (bi) phenyl containing mole cules is that these molecules are relatively easily ionized. This is due to the presence of the resonant excitation transition at 259 nm of the phenyl chromophore, which is well within the range of the available tunable laser systems. BPnS molecules reveal pronounced odd-even desorption profiles depending on the number n of CH 2 units in the alkane spacer. The parent molecules are very pronounced in the mass spectra collected at room temperature in the case of molecules with n=even, while for the molecules with n=odd t hey were hardly visible. The molecular fragments common for all BPnS mol ecules, i. e., the tail part with a mass-to-charge ratio of 168 and the d esulphurized fragment (BPnS&# 8209;S), show an odd-even effect as well. T he tail part reveals the same odd-even effect as the parent molecules, w hile BPnS-S has the opposite one. The observed odd-even features have be en related to a combined effect of the different orientation of the mole cules on the Au(111) surface, the different strengths of the S-Au bondin g and intramolecular bonds, as well as different intermolecular interact ions. Replacing the thiol headgroup by the selenium-based group better stabili ty of the molecule-substrate bond is introduced. This is revealed in our experiments, e. g., by the absence of parent molecules in the observed d esorption profiles. On the other hand, the deselenized fragments (BPnSe& # 8209;Se) follow precisely the same odd-even effect as was observed befo re for the thiol analogs of molecules without a headgroup (BPnS-S). A co mprehensive explanation of the effect is still missing, with the studies on selenium-based molecular layers still under development. However, ou r desorption measurements provide clear evidence that the Se-Au bond is much stronger and more stable in comparison to the S-Au bond in the thio l SAM systems. The final topic dealt with in this thesis work is the study of organic l ayers of BHA derivates grown on copper surfaces. Several species with di fferent substituents (p-h-BHA, p-Cl-BHA, p-methoxy-BHA, and p-nitro-BHA) and different preparation solvents (H 2 O, MeOH, and DMSO) were studied. The reported measurements show that the presence of oxides on the copper surface is important for adsorbing molecules, with both mole cular oxygen atoms of the moiety likely connected to the copper surface. The observed sputtering flight time profiles of copper from sputter-cle aned, solvent-purified, or molecule-covered surfaces show that the BHA m olecules can be considered as promising corrosion inhibitors. These examples show the power of the combined SNMS and REMPI technique f or the surface analysis of a broad range of organic overlayers. Of cours e this one technique alone is not sufficient to draw final conclusions o n the molecular orientation on the surface. Nevertheless, the obtained r esults do reveal the high sensitivity to the electronic and geometric st ructures, as well as to subtle changes of them. One important issue is t hat the comparison of odd and even BPnS molecules prepared at room tempe rature shows that during ion irradiation different chemical bonds are af fected and consequently different ratios of desorbed fragments are obtai ned. However, the same molecules with n=even prepared at elevated temper ature show different ratios, which is attributed to the phase change as observed with other techniques. Another key example is the comparison of results obtained for similar types of molecules, BPnS and BPnSe, which only differ by their headgroup. This study provides important insights o n the sensitivity to the chemistry of a system. It has already been sugg ested that the Se-Au bond is more stable than the S-Au bond. Our desorpt ion spectra show no sign of parent molecules desorbed from BPnSe/Au surf aces, which provides clear evidence for the higher stability of the Se-A u bond in the SAM-surface complex with respect to the thiol analogue. Finally, the thermal desorption experiments  albeit in a limited temper ature range  of SAMs in combination with resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization appears to be a promising method for surface analysis of org anic overlayers. So far this technique only has been used in aerosol com pounds measurements. We have demonstrated that the method can be used as well as a desorption-induced tool with high sensitivity to study the su rface chemistry of a material.
