40|$|Direct current SQUIDs (superconducting quantum {{interference}} devices) {{have been}} successfully fabricated by using a Pb-doped BiSrCaCuO superconducting thin film made by mixed evaporation of a single source composed of related components with a resistance heater. The dc SQUID comprises a <b>square</b> <b>washer</b> with a small hole. These SQUIDs show perfectly periodic voltage-flux characteristics without magnetic shield, that is, typically, the flux noise and energy resolution at a frequency range from dc to 1 Hz and at 78 K being 1. 7 x 10 (- 3) PHI- 0 / square-root Hz and 3. 6 x 10 (- 26) J/Hz, respectively. Meanwhile, we have found out {{that one of the}} SQUIDs still was able to operate on flux-locked mode without bias currents and showed voltage-flux second harmonic characteristics. This phenomenon is not well understood, but it may be related to I-V (current-voltage) characteristics of the dc SQUID...|$|E
40|$|We {{have carried}} out {{experimental}} investigation of multi-DC-SQUID magnetometer configuration fabricated on YBa 2 Cu 30 7 -δ thin films onto 24 degree SrTiO 3 bicrystal substrates by directly coupling the pick-up loop to DC-SQUIDs. The {{layout of the}} magnetometer pick-up loop was chosen as a <b>square</b> <b>washer</b> configuration by maximizing loop effective area and minimizing loop inductance. We have used De-Magnetron Sputtering technique for deposition of the films and chemical etching process for patterning the Josephson junctions having 4 μm widths. The use of multi-SQUID configuration {{is related to the}} selection of the best proper junctions for SQUID to improve the chip sensitivity with selectivity option of choosing the squid junctions rather than multichannel operation. Selection of the best junctions compared to each other depending on the junction critical currents and noise levels caused by the fabrication process and placements of the junctions on the grain boundary enable having an increased output signal of the DC-SQUID. © 2007 IEEE...|$|E
