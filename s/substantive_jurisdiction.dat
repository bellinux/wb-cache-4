40|$|It is time {{to rethink}} the role of Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) in {{approving}} social science research. While most law professors conduct their research in an almost unregulated environment - pouring through cases, statutes, and each other 2 ̆ 7 s articles, all without the kind of human interaction subject to IRB regulation - their colleagues elsewhere in the university have been coping for decades with an increasingly intrusive bureaucracy that sometimes undermines basic academic values. Three things seem very clear. First, {{there are a lot}} of IRBs - at least 4, 000 - and their numbers are growing. Second, they have recently 2 ̆ 2 increased their scrutiny of social science protocols and all indications suggest even more scrutiny is imminent. 2 ̆ 2 Third, social scientists are 2 ̆ 2 increasingly frustrated, annoyed, and upset by IRB decisions, inconsistencies, delays, and misunderstandings. 2 ̆ 2 There is much less consensus on what, if anything, should be done about these developments. Some experts favor even more IRB oversight, expanded IRB jurisdiction, and larger budgets and staffs for IRBs. The cure for the ills of IRBs, on this view, is more IRBs. In this article, I suggest a different and more liberalized path. In Part I, I describe the regulatory metastasis of IRBs and some problems it is causing for social science research. In Part II, I offer some thoughts on the ways in which these problems might arise from the pro-regulatory incentives to which IRBs are exposed. Finally, in Part III, I outline some modest liberalizing reforms to counter the effects of these pro-regulatory incentives. The reforms I propose broadly fall into three categories: IRB membership and structure, <b>substantive</b> IRB <b>jurisdiction,</b> and institutional liability. In the first category, IRB membership and structure, I propose that we should require basic First Amendment training for IRB members and include a First Amendment expert as a member of the IRB; that we should require that more than one, perhaps even a majority, of the members of the IRB have the expertise and competence to evaluate the risks and benefits of the particular research being reviewed; and that every research institution using IRBs should establish separate boards for biomedical and social science research. In the second category, <b>substantive</b> IRB <b>jurisdiction,</b> I propose that oral history and other interview-based research should be exempt from IRB approval; that IRBs should be permitted to prohibit or alter research in the social sciences only where the risks of the research substantially outweigh the anticipated benefits; that rather than have IRBs screen social science research before it is performed, they should review it (and enforce internal discipline on researchers, if necessary) only after ethical breeches cause some harm; and that social science researchers themselves, rather than IRBs, should determine at the threshold whether their research is exempt from prior IRB approval. In the third category, institutional liability, I propose that evidentiary rules in civil trials should exclude evidence of a university 2 ̆ 7 s failure to adopt the Common Rule for non-federally-funded research. Many details of these proposals will need to be worked out, but I offer them in this Article as a starting point for reform efforts...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the tasks, activities, competences and {{education}} system of police and city police in order to comparing and proposing of the methodological tools for effective and efficient cooperation between the two components. Although each component has a very different structure and organization and <b>substantive</b> and territorial <b>jurisdiction,</b> activities of city police in some areas closely linked with the activities of police (supervision of public order in the city) or it {{is linked to the}} activities of police (reporting of crimes the police). Currently, there is necessary that the both components cooperated with one another, have functional channels and are constantly informed about important matters that take place within the activity of the components (police inform about search persons, about robberies, burglaries). Similarly, the education system and its form in the police and local police is very different simply because the police as a component of the state is organized from the central level, while the individual city police is controlled from the local level. Therefore depends on the decision of who controls the local city police, what kind of above standard training would provide police officers and what funds can allocate to this training. Currently, many city police have more available funds for equipment, instrumentation or training than the police, but on the other side missing some permissions that would help them operate more efficiently. The minor modification of an existing legislative authority of the municipal police would often resolve cases without the same time necessary police assistance The aim of this thesis is to outline how the city police could cooperate with the police more intensively and effectively in cities, provided that they solved some minor problems, and also propose optimal level of police officeres training in cities...|$|R
40|$|The Court Jurisdiction and Proceedings Transfer Act (CJPTA) codifies the <b>substantive</b> law of <b>jurisdiction</b> in British Columbia, Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan. One of the {{questions}} that may be posed by the future of the CJPTA is how the jurisdictional system that it enacts would function in relation to two potential international conventions that are contemplated by the Hague Conference on Private International Law. One, a convention on the enforcement of judgments, is in an advanced stage of negotiation and may well be adopted by the Hague Conference. It deals with jurisdiction indirectly, by defining jurisdictional standards or “filters” that must be satisfied for civil and commercial judgments to be recognized under its rules. A remoter possibility, but expressly on the Conference’s agenda, is a further convention dealing with jurisdiction directly, potentially including acceptable standards of jurisdiction and dealing with issues of forum non conveniens (declining jurisdiction) and lis alibi pendens (parallel proceedings pursued concurrently in a foreign court). This paper compares the CJPTA’s jurisdictional rules with those included as “filters” in the latest draft of the judgments convention in February 2017, and with those that might form part of a further convention to harmonize jurisdictional rules directly. It concludes that the CJPTA could operate without difficulty in relation to the proposed judgments convention and, very probably, an eventual jurisdiction convention, because its jurisdictional standards are, almost without exception, more liberal than those incorporated in the Hague models. The paper also suggests that {{there is no reason to}} modify the CJPTA so as to bring it closer to the rules being developed in The Hague, since the CJPTA regulates jurisdiction, not just in international, but also in interprovincial cases, where different standards are appropriate...|$|R
40|$|In Mabo v. State of Queensland (No. 2) (1992) 175 C. L. R. 1, the {{majority}} of the High Court held that native title had survived the acquisition of sovereignty over the Australian continent and is recognised by the common law. However, all the judgments failed to articulate clearly either the nature of native title as a legal form, and the relationship of that legal form to the common law, or what is meant by recognition. Twelve years later the High Court has still not provided a satisfactory understanding of any of these matters. The central problem investigated by this thesis is the nature of that relationship and of the legal interest of native title. It is contended that this relationship can be understood and ordered as a matter of jurisdiction. This thesis seeks to recuperate a <b>substantive</b> concept of <b>jurisdiction,</b> and specifically of a particular jurisdiction, that of the common law, and to demonstrate how the interest of native title results from the jurisdictional relationship between common law and indigenous law. Part I is a genealogy of native title, drawn out through a history of ideas about common law jurisdiction. It is an account of the legal practice of jurisdiction, through a conceptual elaboration of a particular jurisdiction: the common law. This part traces the history of the common law from its origins in a pluralistic, fragmented, jurisdictional landscape, to its current position as the law of the land. It considers the traditional mechanisms and techniques through which the common law has ordered its relationships with other jurisdictions, and how it has appropriated matters traditionally within the purview of other jurisdictions, accommodating them within the common law as custom. The thesis demonstrates that the same gestures and practices can be seen in modern native title decisions, and contends that the ordering which underpins both native title, and the Australian legal system, is jurisdictional. Part II examines the practice of jurisdiction through an examination of three technologies of jurisdiction, all of which contributed to the construction of the legal entity of native title as an act of jurisdiction: mapping, accommodation and categorisation...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the evolution of}} the doctrine of conspiracy {{during the course of the}} trial at the International Military Tribunal for the Far East (hereinafter the Tokyo Trial). The Tokyo Trial is a neglected foundation of international criminal law, long in the shadow of Nuremberg, condemned as victor’s justice because of the prosecution of Japanese war time leaders for crimes against peace. Professor Cherif Bassiouni’s comment is typical: "Tokyo [...] . was a precedent that legal history can only consider with a view not to repeat it". Bassiouni’s comment, however, is an invitation not to ignore the trial but to learn from its mistakes. The trial’s treatment of conspiracy is particularly relevant today because conspiracy was intimately linked to the crime of aggression at Tokyo, and aggression is part of the <b>substantive</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> of the International Criminal Court (ICC) ...|$|E

It considers the public international law aspects of the appeal and asks if the court’s acceptance that a pleaof state immunity is procedural (and does not therefore affect the state’s underlying duty or obligation) means that the UK approach to the relationship between immunity and Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights (access to justice) needs to be re-examined. The UK courts have hitherto heldthat Article 6 is not automatically engaged by a plea of immunity on the basis that such a plea deprives the court of <b>substantive</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> so there can be no denial of access as access does not exist in the first place. The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg has consistently maintained the opposite view and Nolan may have an impact on appeals touching on this issue pending before the Supreme Court...|$|E
40|$|As {{a general}} proposition, when a state asserts <b>substantive</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> over {{the subject matter}} of a tax, the state should also have {{enforcement}} jurisdiction over a person who can effectively remit the tax. Administrative and compliance considerations may justify an exception when the item to be taxed falls below a certain threshold. Because the administrative and compliance costs associated with foreign persons may be higher than for domestic persons, the appropriate thresholds for foreign persons may be higher. An alternative to granting a tax exemption to persons who fall below a threshold is to lower their administrative and compliance costs through a simplified compliance regime. In the American sub-national system, the major impediments to the alignment of substantive and enforcement jurisdiction are the Quill physical presence test and the income tax safe-harbor of P. L. 86 - 272. These physical presence tests have had the unintended consequence of stimulating “economic development nexus ” rules that are even more protective of remote businesses, thus driving substantive and enforcement jurisdiction even further out of alignment. Finally, the tax law has responded to mobility in various ways, as illustrated by the diverse approaches to the problem of sourcing intangibles for income tax purposes...|$|E
40|$|The current {{international}} {{tax system}} {{based upon the}} principles of source and residence is no longer suited to a globalised world economy, and the fundamentals of the international tax system need to be re-examined. An R+F based cash-flow tax {{based on the principle}} of destination has been proposed as a suitable alternative to taxing corporations in an international setting. The aim {{of this paper is to}} discuss the legal and practical issues which would arise in the implementation of such a tax, namely how a destination-based tax could be effectively designed and implemented. For this purpose we draw on experiences with designing VAT systems worldwide. It is proposed that the destination principle should be implemented through use of the customers’ location as the main legal proxy. We argue that the country where the customer is located has both the <b>substantive</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> to tax, i. e. the legitimacy to impose tax, and enforcement jurisdiction to tax, i. e. the effective legal and implementing means of collecting the proposed tax. As regards enforcement jurisdiction to tax, we propose that a one-stop-shop system similar to that being experimented in VAT as the most effective means of collecting tax. Other potential implementing issues are addressed, namely deductibility of expenses and tax credits, susceptibility to avoidance and fraud, treatment of financial transactions, and treatment of small businesses. We conclude that, if it were applied in an international cooperation setting, it would indeed be legitimate and administratively possible to implement a destination-based corporate tax...|$|E
