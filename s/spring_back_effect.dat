Prediction of such a <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> <b>effect</b> is a major challenging problem in industry involving sheet metal forming operations.

40|$|International audienceIn this project, it {{is planned}} {{to carry out}} a {{complete}} microstructural characterization of advanced high strength steels (AHSS) currently used in the automotive industry. These steels have an elastic effect, called <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> <b>effect,</b> during the sheet metal forming of parts. This spring back is the main problem of this family of steels during the production process of the structural components of the automotive industry: especially for dimensional problems in automotive structural components. It is therefore necessary to evaluate changes in microstructure during the stages of sheet metal forming in order to know precisely the microstructural and mechanical behavior of material after being subjected to this effect. Steels studied in this research work are currently used by all major automobile industries, which are dual-phase (DP) 600 and 780. The <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> <b>effect</b> mechanical characterization was performed by means of a mechanical bending test, called as Air Bending. The results indicate that the <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> <b>effect</b> in the DP 780 has the highest spring back rate due to its high mechanical strength due to Hall-Petchphenomenom. The comparison of analyses EBSD before and after bending tests showed a relation between the misorientation of grains and the <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> <b>effect.</b> The results obtained by microstructure analysis of EBSD confirmed the tendency of DP 780 absorb a greater amount of energy during the deformation, thus resulting in greater springback effect...|$|E

40|$|Compact {{and highly}} loaded {{composite}} components experience extensive transverse shear stress concentrations {{in areas of}} load introduction and curved sections. Standard 3 D multilayered composite brick elements are employed to analyze UTL. For the purpose of validation several full-scale test components with T-cross section have been manufactured with thicknesses ranging from 60 - 90 mm. In a first approach single non interactive failure criteria have been used due to the uncertainty of out of plane material properties. Despite {{the fact that the}} used element type provides a simple mean of modeling and analyzing UTL, it is found that the element formulation strictly limits the accuracy of transverse shear stress prediction. The quadratic or even linear approximation of in plane displacements does not account for the irregular distribution in thickness direction [1]. Global deformations of the geometry can however be calculated with good results. Most failure modes experienced, are found to be dominated by transverse shear or out of plane peeling stresses. Particularly in the region of load introduction. For the analysis of the final landing gear fitting material restricted correction factors are introduced. In addition to the T-Sections, large so called ‘Double Corners’ are tested in both in plane and out of plane direction to develop effective countermeasures for premature failure modes, such as throat washers and load distribution plates. The utilized modified VAP cycle has significant benefits compared to closed mould processes, such as reduced tooling costs and high flexibility.

From this it follows an increased application of high strength steels as well as stainless steels in the car body production. The forming of these materials is associated with high requirements to forming procedure and forming tools. In comparison with forming of low strength steels the risk of <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> <b>effects</b> is increased caused by higher amount of elastic deformation. Furthermore during deep drawing processes tearing nearby the die corner may occur because load strengths {{in this area are}} too large. These load strengths are so called "plane strain" states. In order to avoid or reduce failure a monitoring of the stress states during the deep drawing process should be implemented. Basically the non-destructive electromagnetic testing method 3 MA (Micromagnetic Multiparameter Microstructure and Stress Analysis) is convenient to characterize stress states. A special miniaturized electromagnetic probe, a so called rotating field probe, which is able to detect multiaxial stress states, was developed. In a first step measurements in a cross tensile test, which allows the generation of the critical "plane strain" state, were performed. Systematic dependencies between the electromagnetic signals and the strain states could be observed. Based on these measuring results the rotating field probe was integrated in a deep drawing tool.

Cold bending of metal tubes is very important production method considering that metal tubes are widely used in {{a great variety of}} engineering products, such as automobile, aircraft, air conditioner, air compressor, exhaust systems, fluid lines. During tube bending, considerable in-plane distortion and thickness variation occurs.

40|$|Rubber forming is {{a common}} process for the {{fabrication}} of flanged metallic parts in the aerospace industry. The process enables cheap tooling, which is important since the product series are limited. In the process a rigid and a soft tool are combined to form a metal blank into the required shape. Most components made in this way are “flanged parts”, i. e. parts with a rather flat web plate and curved flanges at {{the periphery of the}} web plate. For flanged parts the determination of <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> of the flanges, straight or curved, is important, since the forming dies compensated with the <b>spring</b> <b>back,</b> should result in accurate products. Like all metal forming processes elastic and plastic deformations are combined in the same process cycle. The elastic deformations result in <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> and residual stresses, the ratio between these two depends on the shape of the product and the distribution of the plastic and elastic deformations. In this research an aluminium alloy was used. The low Young’s modulus of this alloy results in rather high elastic responses upon deformation. Other aspects that have been evaluated are the effect of processing parameters like friction and distribution of strains. For stretch flanges the strain is distributed evenly along the flange, but not for shrink flanges, where buckling plays a role. Experimental research shows that the <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> of the flanges depend on a number of variables like the thickness, flange geometry, and material parameters. The <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> of a flange is also a mixture of different contributions: <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> due to the bending over the bend line, <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> due to the curvature of the flange, and <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> due to in-plane deformations. The research performed focused on the different components of the <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> and their interaction. Analysis of the data resulted in a new parameter by which a number of variables could be captured.

Retraction {{spring is}} a type of {{orthodontic}} apparatus that is used to move a tooth with respect to another by utilizing its <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> <b>effect.</b> It is made of metallic wire formed to individual orthodontic cases.

40|$|Creep-age forming (CAF) is an {{interesting}} process for the airframe industry, as {{it is able to}} form or shape panels into smooth, but complex, curvatures. In the CAF process, the ageing cycle of the alloy is used to relax external loads imposed to the part, through creep mechanisms. Those relaxed stresses impose a new curvature to the part. At the end of the process, significant spring back (sometimes about 70 %) is observed and the success in achieving the desired form depends on how the spring back can be predicted in order to compensate it by tooling changes. Most of the applications relate to simple (non stiffened) panels. The present work deals with the CAF of aluminum panels for aircraft wing skin application.

Emphasis has been placed on full utilization of shape memory effect without compromising on structural stiffness of the composite beam. Koryo Miura et a 1 (ref. 2) explain about adaptive structures and their use in aerospace applications. Here a variable geometry (VG) truss concept is presented. Comparison is made between tetrahedral and octahedral truss elements. Since octahedral is richer in symmetry, it is considered to be adequate for adaptive structures. DC motor is used as an actuator. It is shown that VG truss is the basic form of adaptive structures. The basic formulations for its geometrical as well as vibrational properties are established. Some applications such as second generation manipulator arm, support architecture for a space station and others are discussed here. Deepak. S. Ramrakhyani et a 1 (ref. 3) explains about the use of compliant cellular truss where tendons are used as active elements. This tendon actuated elements can be used for local or global shape changes. Here an octahedral unit cell is developed for bending deformations and compliant joints are made of cylindrical elements of superelastic shape memory alloys. Several concepts of morphing skin were also presented. Tendon actuators are presently under development. The tendons could be actuated locally or combined from a remote location such as the root of the wing.
