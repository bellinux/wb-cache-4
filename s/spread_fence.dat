40|$|Red-tailed phascogales (Phascogale calura) were reintroduced to Wadderin Sanctuary in {{the eastern}} wheatbelt of Western Australia in April 2009 with {{individuals}} sourced from remnant native vegetation on farmland some 180 km to the west. Their establishment was monitored initially by radio-telemetry and trapping, and subsequently by the checking of nest boxes {{both within and outside}} the sanctuary. Translocated phascogales established well and bred successfully in their first season. Phascogales remain extant at Wadderin more than five years after release and appear to be abundant and to occupy all available habitat. They have <b>spread</b> beyond the <b>fenced</b> sanctuary to adjoining woodland and to shrubland and woodland habitat in a remnant 1. 4 km away. Comparison with two other reintroductions of this species (one apparently successful, one not) suggests management and habitat factors that {{may have contributed to the}} outcomes...|$|R
40|$|REASONS FOR PERFORMING STUDY: Fatalities {{resulting}} from horse falls occurring during the cross-country phase of eventing competitions initiated epidemiological {{investigation of the}} risk factors associated with horse falls. OBJECTIVES: To identify variables that increased or decreased {{the risk of a}} horse fall during the cross-country phase of an eventing competition. METHODS: Data were collected from randomly selected British Eventing competitions held in Great Britain during 2001 and 2002. Data were obtained for 173 cases (jumping efforts resulting in a fall of the horse-and-rider partnership) and 503 matched controls (jumping efforts not resulting in a fall). The risk of falling was modelled using conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: An increased risk of a horse fall was associated with jumping into or out of water; taking off from good-to-soft, soft or heavy ground; fences with a drop landing; nonangled <b>fences</b> with a <b>spread</b> > or = 2 m; and angled fences. Other risk factors included riders who knew that they were in the lead within the competition before the cross-country phase; an inappropriate speed of approach to the fence (too fast or too slow); horse-and-rider partnerships that had not incurred refusals at earlier fences; and riders who received cross-country tuition. CONCLUSIONS: This study has identified modifiable course- and fence-level risk factors for horse falls during the cross-country phase of eventing competitions. The risk of horse and rider injury at eventing competitions should be reduced by 3 simple measures; maintaining good to firm take-off surfaces at fences, reducing the base <b>spread</b> of <b>fences</b> to < 2 m and reducing the use of fences at which horses are required to jump into or out of water. Risk reduction arising from course and fence modification needs to be confirmed by intervention studies. POTENTIAL RELEVANCE: Knowledge of factors that increase or decrease the risk of a horse fall can be used by UK governing bodies of the sport {{to reduce the risk of}} horse falls on the cross-country phase of eventing competitions, and reduce the risk of horse and rider injuries and fatalities. As one in 3 horses that fall injure themselves and one in 100 horse falls results in fatality to the horse, we suggest that immediate consideration is given to these recommendations...|$|R

50|$|The {{competition}} {{involves a}} maximum of five rounds - opening round followed by four jump-offs, not against the clock. The first round consists of four to six large single obstacles including the puissance wall, the starting height of which may vary from 1.70 to 1.80 m in height. For the jump-offs, in which the fences are raised for each round, {{there are only two}} obstacles—a <b>spread</b> <b>fence</b> and the wall—although an optional practice fence is included. In the event of equality after the fifth round, riders share first prize.|$|E
40|$|The {{cross-country}} {{phase of}} eventing competitions {{has been associated}} with injuries and fatalities to horses and riders. A case-control study was carried out to identify variables that were associated with increased or decreased risk of a horse fall on the cross-country phase at event competitions. After initial analysis, the dataset was split according to the categories of one-day events as compared to two- or three-day events to establish whether significant risk factors varied between the different types of eventing competitions. Data were collected for 121 cases (horse falls) at one-day events, 59 cases at two- or three-day events and for their 540 matched controls. The data were analysed using conditional logistic regression. The variables of no previous refusals on the course, fences with a landing in water and the combined variable of the angle and the <b>spread</b> of the <b>fence</b> were significantly associated with the risk of a horse fall in both datasets. Additional risk factors for one-day event falls were: fences requiring a take-off from water, a drop landing, the rider's knowledge of their position before the cross-country phase and if the rider received cross-country tuition. Three-day event risk factors in the multivariable model included: the camber of the fence and participation in non-equestrian sports by the rider. This study identified variables that were significantly associated with an increase or a decrease in the risk of a horse fall during the cross-country phase of different types of eventing competitions. Some of these variables are modifiable and {{the results of this study}} have been reported to the governing body of the sport of eventing in the UK so that possible interventions might be considered...|$|R
