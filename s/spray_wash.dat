50|$|The Voluntary Initiative works towards {{promoting}} safe Pesticide use. It’s {{important when}} using pesticides to plan ahead, ensure proper application time, ensure proper application, {{and clean up}} properly. To plan ahead farmers should avoid erosion and run off, be certain to use pesticides from a trusted source, and be certain to fill pesticides away from drains and waterways. To ensure proper timing according to the Voluntary Initiative the sprayer should be checked for leaks on a regular basis, do not apply pesticides to dry cracked surfaces and saturated soils, and don’t spray within 48 hours of rainfall. This specifically allows for easier transportation of the pesticides into the water supply. To ensure proper application of pesticides avoid spills and splashes when filling the sprayer, make sure no pesticides get into the water supply, clean up any spills, and apply with care. The final step is to clean up when finished with the application. <b>Spray</b> <b>wash</b> on the crop and target area when finished, and clean off any mud or surfaces that could have {{come into contact with}} the pesticides before leaving the target area.|$|E

40|$|Savannah River Remediation (SRR) is {{preparing}} Tank 6 F for closure. The {{first step in}} preparing the tank for closure is mechanical sludge removal. In mechanical sludge removal, personnel add liquid (e. g., inhibited water or supernate salt solution) to the tank to form a slurry. They mix the liquid and sludge with pumps, and transfer the slurry to another tank for further processing. Mechanical sludge removal effectively removes {{the bulk of the}} sludge from a tank, but is not able to remove all of the sludge. In Tank 6 F, SRR estimated a sludge heel of 5, 984 gallons remained after mechanical sludge removal. To remove this sludge heel, SRR performed chemical cleaning. The chemical cleaning included two oxalic acid strikes, a <b>spray</b> <b>wash,</b> and a water wash. SRR conducted the first oxalic acid strike as follows. Personnel added 110, 830 gallons of 8 wt % oxalic acid to Tank 6 F and mixed the contents of Tank 6 F with two submersible mixer pumps (SMPs) for approximately four days. Following the mixing, they transferred 115, 903 gallons of Tank 6 F material to Tank 7 F. The SMPs were operating when the transfer started and were shut down approximately five hours after the transfer started. SRR collected a sample of the liquid from Tank 6 F and submitted it to SRNL for analysis. Mapping of the tank following the transfer indicated that 2, 400 gallons of solids remained in the tank. SRR conducted the second oxalic acid strike as follows. Personnel added 28, 881 gallons of 8 wt % oxalic acid to Tank 6 F. Following the acid addition, they visually inspected the tank and transferred 32, 247 gallons of Tank 6 F material to Tank 7 F. SRR collected a sample of the liquid from Tank 6 F and submitted it to SRNL for analysis. Mapping of the tank following the transfer indicated that 3, 248 gallons of solids remained in the tank. Following the oxalic acid strikes, SRR performed Spray Washing with oxalic acid to remove waste collected on internal structures, cooling coils, tank top internals, and tank walls. The Acid <b>Spray</b> <b>Wash</b> was followed by a Water <b>Spray</b> <b>Wash</b> to remove oxalic acid from the tank internals. SRR conducted the <b>Spray</b> <b>Wash</b> as follows. Personnel added 4, 802 gallons of 8 wt % oxalic acid to Tank 6 F through the spray mast installed in Riser 2, added 4, 875 gallons of oxalic acid through Riser 7, added 5, 000 gallons of deionized water into the tank via Riser 2, and 5, 000 gallons of deionized water into the tank via Riser 7. Following the <b>Spray</b> <b>Wash,</b> they visually inspected the tank and transferred 22, 430 gallons of Tank 6 F material to Tank 7 F.

40|$|An {{all-metal}} High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filter {{has been}} recently developed {{as an alternative}} to traditional HEPA filters fabricated with conventional glass fibers. This metal filter was developed utilizing sintered porous metal media fabricated from nickel metal powder. One specific application is the potential for replacement of glass fiber HEPA filters currently used in High Level Waste (HLW) tank ventilation systems at various Department of Energy (DOE) nuclear waste storage sites in the US. The glass filters are subject to a shortened life span due to their deterioration from moisture condensation and therefore must be disposed of when spent. The disposal process is costly, creates solid waste, and is hazardous since the site personnel are at risk of exposure to radiation. Savannah River Technology Center (SRTC) began investigating the use of porous metal as a HEPA filter material in 1996. This effort subsequently lead to a DOE funded development. This project, under DOE funding, developed novel technology to replace the glass fiber HEPA filters with a regenerable and more durable filter.

Washing treatment by using the electrolytic water was the major processing and its high oxidant ability or bactericidal ability would inhibit and kill the microorganism, in hope to extend the preservation period. The scallion (Allium fistulosum L.) at Sunshin area in Yilan County of Taiwan and water convolvulus (Ipomoea aquatica Forsk.) was selected in this study because the volatility of their price was easily influenced by typhoons and festivals. The experimental {{results indicated that the}} optimal preservation conditions for scallions were washed with 40 ppm electrolytic water (as ClO 2 at 5 ℃) for 3 minutes and stored in the sealed polyethylene (PE) bags without ethylene absorbent at 5 ℃ and the shelf life was able to reach to 3 weeks and very low yellowing or decaying index were performed. The optimal preservation conditions for water convolvulus were that 30 ppm electrolytic water (as ClO 2 at 5 ℃) with ultrasonic <b>spray</b> <b>washing</b> for 5 minutes and stored in the PE bags without ethylene absorbent at 10 ℃ and the shelf life was also able to reach to 21 days and kept visual quality...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that pre-slaughter stress of cattle reduces beef quality because of its effect on post mortem muscle pH. <b>Spray</b> <b>washing</b> in the cattle yard is a hygiene requirement of the New Zealand Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (MAF) {{in order to reduce the}} contamination of carcasses. However, the washing stresses the animal. This study investigated the effect of spray-washing cattle on beef quality. <b>Spray</b> <b>washing</b> of cattle resulted in considerably more variation in the ultimate pH (pHu) of the meat (5. 52 to 6. 48) compared to meat from dry animals (5. 50 to 5. 79). The increased variability in pHu was reflected in the meat shear force values from the spray-washed animals, which ranged from 5. 2 to 14. 5 kgF, while that from the dry animals ranged between 4. 8 and 8. 6 kgF. There was a tendency for meat from spray-washed animals to be tougher than meat from dry animals (p = 0. 089). The effect of <b>spray</b> <b>washing</b> on calpain I autolysis, desmin and troponin T degradation during post mortem period was determined. Results showed that <b>spray</b> <b>washing</b> tended to cause an increase (p = 0. 07) in post mortem degradation of desmin but had no significant effect on troponin T degradation or calpain I autolysis. The second part of the research investigated the effect of post-slaughter processing conditions on turkey breast meat tenderness, and the biochemical basis for the toughening of turkey breast meat. Anecdotal evidence showed that consumers perceived turkey breast meat as being tough. The preliminary results of this research indicated that the tenderness of turkey breast meat was variable and the mean shear force was higher than would be acceptable to consumers. The observed toughening of turkey breast meat may be a result of post-slaughter treatments of turkey carcasses, such as the rate of carcass cooling, stunning method and carcass deboning time. The effect of these factors on turkey breast meat tenderness were investigated in this research. Post-slaughter temperature and pH of turkey breast muscle was measured at different times. The carcass temperature ranged from 32 °C to 36 °C at 15 minutes post slaughter. Immersion chilling (1 st water bath and 2 nd ice slush bath) rapidly reduced the internal breast muscle temperature to about 10 °C by 75 min after stunning. In all three experiments (2, 3 & 4), cold blast treatment significantly decreased the internal breast muscle temperature compared to the breast muscle that was chilled only. The breast muscle temperature immediately after a cold blast treatment (about six hours post-slaughter) ranged from 2 - 6 °C. In this study, the mean pH of turkey breast muscle at 15 min post-slaughter was 6. 52, indicating that turkey breast muscle exhibited accelerated rigor mortis compared to lamb or beef. The pH of turkey breast muscle at six hours post-slaughter was close to the ultimate pH, which ranged from 5. 80 to 5. 96. Results of this research showed that turkey processing conditions have a toughening effect on the resulting breast meat. Deboning of turkey breast muscle three hours post-slaughter caused between a 80 % and 90 % increase in toughness of the meat compared to muscle aged on the bone for 24 hours. The use of a blast freezer to rapidly cool the breast also toughened the meat by an average of 30 %. The mechanisms responsible for the meat toughening were both muscle contraction and a reduction of proteolysis. The sarcomere length of muscles deboned three hours post mortem was significantly shorter than muscles deboned at 24 hours post mortem. The myofibrillar fragmentation index (MFI), which is a measure of proteolysis, was significantly higher for muscles aged on bone for at least 24 hours compared to muscles deboned three hours post-slaughter. It is known that meat tenderness improves during post mortem ageing. Results of experiment 4 showed that six days extended ageing of pre-rigor or post-rigor deboned turkey breast muscle significantly improved the meat tenderness. In both muscles deboned at 3 hand 24 h post mortem, there was a 25 % decrease in the shear force values after the 6 -day ageing period. During the ageing period, MFI increased significantly both for muscles deboned at three hours post-slaughter (p = 0. 025) and for the muscles aged on bone for 24 hours prior to deboning (p = 0. 018). Activities of calpain I, II and calpastatin were measured at three different times during post-slaughter ageing (0, 3 and 24 hours) in muscles aged on bone for 24 hours and muscles deboned three hours post-slaughter and then, aged for 24 hours. The activity of calpain I rapidly declined with increasing post mortem time to the extent that only trace levels were detected at three hours, and no calpain activity was detected at 24 hours post mortem. In contrast, there was no loss in calpain II activity over the post mortem period. Calpastatin retained only 35 % of its at-death activity in turkey breast muscle at three hours post-slaughter and there was no calpastatin activity at 24 hours post-slaughter. Furthermore, deboning time had no significant effect on the activity of calpain I, II and calpastatin at 24 hours post mortem. Based on these results, it can be concluded that the observed toughening of turkey breast meat originates from the rapid cooling of turkey carcasses and the three hours post slaughter deboning time. The mechanism of the toughening of turkey breast muscle deboned three hours post mortem is likely to be a direct result of cold shortening rather than reduced calpain activity. This suggests that the reduced proteolysis as measured by MFI is a result of reduced accessibility of the cal pain to myofibrillar protein because of the shortened sarcomere length of muscles deboned at three hours post slaughter and then aged for 24 hours...|$|R
