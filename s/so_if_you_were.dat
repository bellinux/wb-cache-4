500|$|The Gunnerkrigg Court webcomic is told in {{a series}} of episodic {{chapters}} such that each, while forming part of the overall storyline, also functions individually as a stand-alone story arc."Each of the chapters individually is sort of a self-contained thing, <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> to just read one of them it wouldn't be like you {{had no idea what was}} going on." [...] The themes and topics of the chapters vary widely: as one reviewer describes, [...] "You are also not subjected to 400-plus pages of intricate plot movement. While there is an overall story arc, there are also lighter chapters that focus on unusual classes ... or small moments that build the main characters." [...] Each chapter begins with a title page and ends with one or more [...] "bonus pages," [...] which are not integral to the main storyline but often offer ancillary details about the world of Gunnerkrigg Court or about minor characters. [...] The chapters have varied in length from four pages to more than eighty. [...] Each page is drawn in traditional (A4; 210 × 297mm) page format and divided arbitrarily into frames. At the bottom of the most recent page is a link to a comments thread for that page, in which readers may comment on and discuss that day's comic.|$|E
2500|$|The {{alternate}} U.S. {{version of}} Lammy's Stage 6, however, drew mixed praise and criticism. IGN called it [...] "a far off island [...] has that Japan-idol-talk influence... <b>So</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> {{expecting to see}} one of the levels being in hell, well, it's not in there." [...] Similarly, GameSpot's Gerstmann made a later update on his March 26, 1999, review by commenting on the U.S. alterations to Stage 6, exclaiming, [...] "It doesn't really affect the game too much, since much of the game doesn't {{make a lot of sense}} to begin with." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The {{guy who did}} {{the artwork}} for the first record, Jacob Escobedo, {{came up with that}} concept for the artwork , and in that moment we began talking about retro-futurism: <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> to {{go back and look at}} the science fiction books {{released}} in the fifties and just how fascinating it is to see what people thought about the future. And for us, that kind of became like a theme. Brian's got all of this ancient gear - synthesisers from the time that synthesisers were being made - and they were incredibly futuristic at that time. And then as we got more into it ... the whole aesthetic started to evolve from there." ...|$|E

They will work together for a great good!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But you'll have to wait," [...] said Lady Aylmer, turning {{upon her}} {{companion}} almost fiercely. [...] "That <b>is,</b> <b>you</b> certainly {{will have to}} do <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> to depend upon Frederic's income alone." ...|$|R

"That's odd, my dear," [...] {{returned}} the captain, [...] "because my object in coming {{here is to}} take you to a certain place in Yarmouth, and, although I have not had the opportunity of letting you slip through my fingers, I've no doubt you'd do <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> tempted away by a bait that begins with a D." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Nay, my love; but {{you should}} not {{misunderstand}} me," [...] she said, stopping and facing him on the path {{in which they were}} walking. [...] "I suppose I ought to protest, according to the common rules, that I would rather wait. Young ladies are expected to say <b>so.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> pressing me to marry at once, I should say so, no doubt. But now, as it is, I will be more honest. I have only one wish in the world, and that is, to be your wife,--to be able to share everything with you. The sooner we can be together the better it will be,--at any rate, for me. There; will that satisfy you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why if a boy continues," [...] said Wallace, [...] "when he {{is quite}} old, to take {{pleasure}} in amusements which generally please only young children, that is boyishness of a harmless kind. For example, suppose we should see a boy, eighteen years old, playing marbles a great deal, we should {{say that he was}} boyish. <b>So</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> to have a rattle or any other such little toy for a plaything, and should {{spend a great deal of}} time in playing with it, we should say that it was very boyish or childish. Still that kind of boyishness does little harm, and we should not probably do any thing about it, but should leave you to outgrow it in your own time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Better {{let her go}} perhaps, John," [...] he said, {{addressing}} his own effigy in the water. [...] "After all, it will be {{best for}} you to let things to take their course, and not to burn your own fingers or commit yourself in any way, John. You will trap them more securely <b>so.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> to warn the girl now, you would only expose them; if you wait till he has married her, you will altogether destroy them {{with the help of}} that young Heigham. And perhaps by that time you will have touched those compromising letters, John, and made a few other little arrangements, and then {{you will be able to}} enjoy the sweets of revenge meted out with a quart measure, not in beggarly ones or twos. But you are thinking of the girl--eh, John? Ah! you always were a pitiful beggar; but tread down the inclination, decline to gratify it. If you do, you will spoil your own hand. The girl must take her chance--oh! clearly the girl must take her chance. But all the same, John, you are very sorry for her--very. Come, come, you must be off, or her ladyship and the gentle George will be kept waiting," [...] and away he went at a brisk pace, cheerfully singing a verse of a comic song. Sir John was a merry little man.|$|E

6000|$|She {{felt that}} at the rate she was now {{progressing}} she would only run from one little suggestion to another, and that he, either wilfully or in sheer simplicity, would take such suggestions simply as jokes; and she was aware that she lacked the skill to bring the conversation round gradually to the point which she was bound to reach. She must make another dash, let it be ever so sudden. Her mode of doing so would be crude, ugly,--almost vulgar she feared; but she would attain her object and say {{what she had to}} say. When once she had warmed herself with the heat which argument would produce, then, she was pretty sure, she would find herself at least as strong as he. [...] "I don't know that the thing ought to be done at all," [...] she said. During the last moment or two he had put his arm round her waist; and she, not choosing to bid him desist from embracing her, but unwilling in her present mood to be embraced, got up and stood before him. [...] "I have thought, and thought, and thought, and feel that it should not be done. In marriage, like should go to like." [...] She despised herself for using Wallachia's words, but they fitted in so usefully, that she could not refrain from them. [...] "I was wrong not to know it before, but it is better to know it now, than not to have known it till too late. Everything that I hear and see tells me that it would be <b>so.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> simply an Englishman, I would go anywhere with you; but I am not fit to be the wife of an English lord. The time would come when I should be a disgrace to you, and then I should die." ...|$|E
6000|$|They all {{helped him}} in their {{different}} ways: Grizel, by declining his company; Corp, by being far away at Look-about-you, adding to the inches of a farm-house; Aaron Latta, by saying nothing but looking [...] "college or the herding;" [...] Mr. McLean, who had settled down with Ailie at the Dovecot, by inquiries about his progress; Elspeth by--but did Elspeth's talks with him about how they should live in Aberdeen and afterwards (when {{they were in the}} big house) do more than send his mind a-galloping (she holding on behind) along roads that lead not to Aberdeen? What drove Tommy oftenest to the weary drudgery was, perhaps, the alarm that came over him when he seemed of a sudden to hear the names of the bursars proclaimed and no Thomas Sandys among them. Then did he shudder, for well he knew that Aaron would keep his threat, and he hastily covered the round table with books and sat for hours sorrowfully pecking at them, every little while to discover that his mind had soared to other things, when he hauled it back, as one draws in a reluctant kite. On these occasions Aaron seldom troubled him, except by glances that, nevertheless, brought the kite back more quickly than if they had been words of warning. If Elspeth was present, the warper might sit moodily by the fire, but when the man and the boy were left together, one or other of them soon retired, as if this was the only way of preserving the peace. Though determined to keep his word to Jean Myles liberally, Aaron had never liked Tommy, and Tommy's avoidance of him is easily accounted for; he knew that Aaron did not admire him, and unless you admired Tommy he was always a boor in your presence, shy and self-distrustful. Especially was this <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> a lady (how amazingly he got on in after years with some of you, what agony others endured till he went away!), and it is the chief reason why there are such contradictory accounts of him to-day.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think it's {{the sight}} of so many women here who don't look at all like her that has {{reminded}} me by the law of contraries of my charming friend at Saint-Germain and my promise {{to introduce you to}} her," [...] she wrote. [...] "I believe I spoke to you of her rather blighted state, and I wondered afterwards whether I hadn't been guilty of a breach of confidence. But you would certainly have arrived at guesses of your own, and, besides, she has never told me her secrets. The only one she ever pretended to was that she's the happiest creature in the world, after assuring me of which, poor thing, she went off into tears; so that I prayed to be delivered from such happiness. It's the miserable story of an American girl born neither to submit basely nor to rebel crookedly marrying a shining sinful Frenchman who believes a woman must do {{one or the other of}} those things. The lightest of US have a ballast that they can't imagine, and the poorest a moral imagination that they don't require. She was romantic and perverse--she thought the world she had been brought up in too vulgar or at least too prosaic. To have a decent home-life isn't perhaps the greatest of adventures; but I think she wishes nowadays she hadn't gone in quite so desperately for thrills. M. de Mauves cared of course for nothing but her money, which he's spending royally on his menus plaisirs. I hope you appreciate the compliment I pay you when I recommend you to go and cheer up a lady domestically dejected. Believe me, I've given no other man a proof of this esteem; <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> to take me in an inferior sense I would never speak to you again. Prove to this fine sore creature that our manners may have all the grace without wanting to make such selfish terms for it. She avoids society and lives quite alone, seeing no one but a horrible French sister-in-law. Do let me hear that you've made her patience a little less absent-minded. Make her WANT to forget; make her like you." ...|$|E

5000|$|A {{shooting}} foul {{will receive}} one shot {{for the number}} of attempt point attempt (2, 3, 4 points, <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> foul behind the three-point line, that free throw is worth 3 points.) AND-1 shots applies on every made basket after shooting fouls.|$|R
5000|$|The court {{thinks that}} a man with normal sexual {{instincts}} is incapable of committing the crime, {{and that it is}} only a person of abnormal sexual sense that is capable of committing it. <b>So</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> satisfied that one was possessed of this unnatural or abnormal sexual sense, you might infer that he had a motive, a reason or a force, impelling him to do such an act.|$|E
5000|$|In {{nearly all}} settings, a shared set of darts is used, rather than every {{competitor}} having their own darts. <b>So</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> {{to retrieve the}} darts you just threw, all you would then do is immediately hand them to the next player. With that in mind, it is simply quicker for the incoming shooter to remove the darts from the board, rather than the awkward process of the preceding shooter removing them, then (carefully) passing a handful of three sharpened steel darts to the next player.|$|E
5000|$|The early {{problems}} {{led to a}} raft of aerodynamic {{changes in}} the first half of the season, the first coming for the ill-fated San Marino GP at Imola. The front wing was a significant area of development.“The problem is that the front wing is too sensitive to the rideheight,” said Patrick Head in 1994. “If you were in a corner and went over a bump, the car could pick up a lot more front downforce than rear. <b>So</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> balanced at that point, with the car neutral, you’d lose the rear very quickly.” ...|$|E
