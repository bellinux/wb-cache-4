25|$|A Web crawler, {{sometimes}} called a spider, is an Internet bot that systematically browses the World Wide Web, typically {{for the purpose}} of Web indexing (web <b>spidering).</b>|$|E
25|$|Web {{search engines}} {{and some other}} sites use Web {{crawling}} or <b>spidering</b> software to update their web content or indices of others sites' web content. Web crawlers can copy all the pages they visit for later processing by a search engine which indexes the downloaded pages so the users can search much more efficiently.|$|E
50|$|Any general {{search engine}} would be {{indexing}} all {{the pages and}} searches in a breadth-first manner to collect documents. The <b>spidering</b> in domain-specific search engines more efficiently searches a small subset of documents by focusing on a particular set. <b>Spidering</b> accomplished with a reinforcement-learning framework {{has been found to}} be three times more efficient than breadth-first search.|$|E

50|$|An Internet bot, {{also known}} as web robot, WWW robot or simply bot, is a {{software}} application that runs automated tasks (scripts) over the Internet. Typically, bots perform tasks that are both simple and structurally repetitive, {{at a much higher}} rate than would be possible for a human alone. The largest use of bots is in web <b>spidering</b> (web crawler), in which an automated script fetches, analyzes and files information from web servers at many times the speed of a human. More than half of all web traffic is made up of bots.|$|E
50|$|Some {{social media}} {{monitoring}} and analytics companies use calls to data providers each time an end-user develops a query.

40|$|Spider bite {{continues}} to be a controversial subject worldwide and attribution of clinical effects to different <b>spiders</b> is problematic because of poor case definition and paucity of clinical evidence. The effects of medically important <b>spiders</b> are sometimes underestimated and simultaneously there is misattribution of effects to harmless <b>spider</b> groups. The majority of suspected <b>spider</b> bites present as skin lesions or necrotic ulcers where the history of a <b>spider</b> bite must be confirmed. To be a definite <b>spider</b> bite, the patient must immediately observe the <b>spider</b> and there be evidence of the bite, such as pain. Important groups of <b>spiders</b> worldwide include the widow <b>spiders</b> (latrodectism), recluse <b>spiders</b> (loxoscelism) and some mygalomorph <b>spiders</b> including the Australian Funnel web <b>spider.</b> Most <b>spiders</b> only cause minor effects, including a large number of groups that have been implicated in necrotic arachnidism...|$|R

[...] In 2002, NAAG gave the UCSF Library a large number of document index records and images to further develop the LTDL. Documents are continually added to the MSA collections through the use of <b>spidering</b> (also known as [...] "web crawling") applications that identify and download index records and document images directly from the tobacco companies’ websites.|$|E
50|$|It is {{dependent}} on the pre-analysis of the entire IP address space. There are more than 4 billion possible IP addresses, and detailed analysis of each of them is a Herculean task, {{especially in light of the}} fact that IP addresses are constantly being assigned, allocated, reallocated, moved and changed due to routers being moved, enterprises being assigned IP addresses or moving, and networks being built or changed. In order to keep up with these changes, complex algorithms, bandwidth measurement and mapping technology, and finely tuned delivery mechanisms are necessary. Once all of the IP space is analyzed, each address must be periodically updated to reflect changes in the IP address information, without invading a user's privacy. This process is similar in scale to the task of Web <b>spidering.</b>|$|E
5000|$|U.S. {{courts have}} {{acknowledged}} that users of [...] "scrapers" [...] or [...] "robots" [...] may {{be held liable}} for committing trespass to chattels, which involves a computer system itself being considered personal property upon which the user of a scraper is trespassing. The best known of these cases, eBay v. Bidder's Edge, resulted in an injunction ordering Bidder's Edge to stop accessing, collecting, and indexing auctions from the eBay web site. This case involved automatic placing of bids, known as auction sniping. However, in order to succeed on a claim of trespass to chattels, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant intentionally and without authorization interfered with the plaintiff's possessory interest in the computer system and that the defendant's unauthorized use caused damage to the plaintiff. Not all cases of web <b>spidering</b> brought before the courts have been considered trespass to chattels.|$|E
