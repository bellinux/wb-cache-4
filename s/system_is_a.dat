5|$|A multi-star system {{consists}} {{of two or more}} gravitationally bound stars that orbit each other. The simplest and most common multi-star <b>system</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> binary star, but systems of three or more stars are also found. For reasons of orbital stability, such multi-star systems are often organized into hierarchical sets of binary stars. Larger groups called star clusters also exist. These range from loose stellar associations with only a few stars, up to enormous globular clusters with hundreds of thousands of stars. Such systems orbit their host galaxy.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{star of the}} <b>system</b> <b>is</b> Type-B and Class-IV and sub {{component}} of the <b>system</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> Algol-type eclipsing binary. The <b>system</b> <b>is</b> also considered <b>a</b> visual double star.|$|R

5|$|A toxin-antitoxin <b>system</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> set {{of two or}} {{more closely}} linked genes that {{together}} encode both a protein 'poison' and a corresponding 'antidote'. When these systems are contained on plasmids– transferable genetic elements– they ensure that only the daughter cells that inherit the plasmid survive after cell division. If the plasmid is absent in a daughter cell, the unstable antitoxin is degraded and the stable toxic protein kills the new cell; this is known as 'post-segregational killing' (PSK). Toxin-antitoxin systems are widely distributed in prokaryotes, and organisms often have them in multiple copies.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, various optical {{systems were}} tested. Kohler {{generators}} were installed in 1949 {{along with the}} stationary electric light system. A new rotating light system (EMV-3) was installed in 1963, making the lighthouse fully automated. It was in use until 1982, when an experimental EMV-930M system (made in Ukraine) was installed. The rotation mechanism of the optical <b>system</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> novel solution– there are no electric motors; it uses a revolving magnetic field instead. The optics brought a six to eight hundredfold increase to {{the efficiency of the}} light radiated by a 1kW quartz lamp. The same light system is still in use.|$|E
5|$|An expert <b>system</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{program that}} answers {{questions}} or solves problems about a specific domain of knowledge, using logical rules that {{are derived from}} the knowledge of experts. The earliest examples were developed by Edward Feigenbaum and his students. Dendral, begun in 1965, identified compounds from spectrometer readings. MYCIN, developed in 1972, diagnosed infectious blood diseases. They demonstrated the feasibility of the approach.|$|E

The train of a triple <b>system</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> functional graph having a vertex for each possible triple of symbols; each triple pqr is mapped by ƒ to stu, where pqs, prt, and qru are the triples that belong to the triple system and contain the pairs pq, pr, and qr respectively.

5|$|As of 2017, {{there are}} 39 National Parks and eight National Park Reserves (Kluane {{is the name}} for two areas–a {{national}} park and an adjacent proposed national park (a National Park Reserve)). National Park Reserves are areas intended to become national parks pending settlement of native land claims. Until then, they are managed under the National Parks Act as quasi-parks, but are included here in the main list. This page also includes the country's three National Marine Conservation Areas (NMCAs), a single NMCA Reserve, the lone National Landmark, and proposed parks. National parks currently cover an area of 303,571km², or about 3.0% of the total land area of Canada. Rounding out the national park <b>system</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> collection of National Historic Sites, listed separately.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, the German {{government}} {{introduced the}} first large-scale feed-in tariff system, under the German Renewable Energy Act, {{which resulted in}} explosive growth of PV installations in Germany. At the outset the FIT was over 3x the retail price or 8x the industrial price. The principle behind the German <b>system</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> 20-year flat rate contract. The value of new contracts is programmed to decrease each year, {{in order to encourage}} the industry to pass on lower costs to the end users. The programme has been more successful than expected with over 1GW installed in 2006, and political pressure is mounting to decrease the tariff to lessen the future burden on consumers.|$|E
