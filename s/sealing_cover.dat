40|$|The thermal wave {{technique}} has been explored {{for the use}} of liquid thermal conductivity measurement and flow property diagnostics in this dissertation. For liquid thermal conductivity measurements, an experimental technique based on the thermal wave approach is developed. A stainless steel strip functions as both a heating element and a <b>sealing</b> <b>cover</b> for a chamber containing a test liquid. A periodic current passing through this metal strip generates a periodic Joule heating source. An infrared detector measures the temperature response at the front surface of the stainless steel strip.

A one-dimensional, two-layered transient heat conduction model is developed to predict the temperature response. The phase information of this temperature response shows high sensitivity to the change of thermal properties of the liquid layer and is employed to match experimental data to find the thermal properties of the test liquid. The measured thermal conductivities of water and ethylene glycol agree quite well with data from the literature and support the validity of this measurement technique.

40|$|AbstractDeep {{drawing is}} a forming {{process in which}} a blank of sheet metal is {{radially}} drawn into a forming die by the mechanical action of a punch and converted to required shape. Deep drawing involves complex material flow conditions and force distributions. Radial drawing stresses and tangential compressive stresses are induced in flange region due to the material retention property. These compressive stresses result in wrinkling phenomenon in flange region. Normally blank holder is applied for restricting wrinkles. Tensile stresses in radial direction initiate thinning in the wall region of cup. The thinning results into cracking or fracture. The finite element method is widely applied worldwide to simulate the deep drawing process. For real-life simulations of deep drawing process an accurate numerical model, {{as well as an}} accurate description of material behavior and contact conditions, is necessary. The finite element method is a powerful tool to predict material thinning deformations before prototypes are made. The proposed innovative methodology combines two techniques for prediction and optimization of thinning in automotive <b>sealing</b> <b>cover.</b> Taguchi design of experiments and analysis of variance has been applied to analyze the influencing process parameters on Thinning.

30|$|Primary and {{auxiliary}} boxes. As {{shown in}} Fig.  2 a, the primary box {{is used to}} contain the experimental coal sample. The walls of the box body are 40 -mm-thick steel plate welded into a tight complete structure, with a cover plate thickness of 60  mm, and the design pressure is 6  MPa. The primary box’s length, width and height are 1600, 1200 and 1200  mm, respectively. The maximum experimental coal sample mass is about 1200  kg. The front and rear surfaces of the main box body contain 24 holes with different height distributions in three layers; 23 of these have a 14  mm diameter for conveying sensor cables and the remaining holes with 12  mm diameters are standard screw drills for gas injection. A special high-pressure hose {{is connected to the}} external side, and the hole’s internal side is connected with a cribriform ventilation device {{at the bottom of the}} primary box (Fig.  2 b). The cribriform ventilation device is designed as a cribriform pectinate strip. The height of the pectinate strip is 20  mm, and the upper surface of the strip contains well-distributed ventilation holes. In this way, plane-charging can be fulfilled to simulate natural gas sources. A thread-cutting coal drill pipe exists inside the box body, which is used to simulate the mining work face. Two auxiliary boxes are located on both sides of the primary box, where the coal cutting power transmission shaft is located. The side boxes are also used as a container for drilled coal. Two strip holes lie on both sides of the overlap of the primary and the auxiliary boxes, which provides a moving pathway for the coal drill pipe. To observe the coal drill pipe movement, a window is set at the <b>sealing</b> <b>cover</b> of one of the auxiliary boxes.|$|E

40|$|An {{improved}} promoted-combustion {{system has}} been developed for studying the effects of elevated temperatures on the flammability of metals in pure oxygen. In prior promoted-combustion chambers, initial temperatures of metal specimens in experiments have been limited to the temperatures of gas supplies, usually near room temperature. Although limited elevated temperature promoted-combustion chambers have been developed using water-cooled induction coils for preheating specimens, these designs have been limited to low-pressure operation due to the hollow induction coil. In contrast, the improved promoted-combustion chamber can sustain a pressure up to 10 kpsi (69 MPa) and, through utilization of a solid induction coil, is capable of preheating a metal specimen up to its melting point [potentially in excess of 2, 000 F (approximately equal to 1, 100 C) ]. Hence, the improved promoted combustion chamber makes a greater range of physical conditions and material properties accessible for experimentation. The chamber consists of a vertical cylindrical housing with an inner diameter of 8 in. (20. 32 cm) and an inner height of 20. 4 in. (51. 81 cm). A threaded, <b>sealing</b> <b>cover</b> {{at one end of}} the housing can be unscrewed to gain access for installing a specimen. Inlet and outlet ports for gases are provided. Six openings arranged in a helical pattern in the chamber wall contain sealed sapphire windows for viewing an experiment in progress. The base of the chamber contains pressure-sealed electrical connectors for supplying power to the induction coil. The connectors feature a unique design that prevents induction heating of the housing and the pressure sealing surfaces; this is important because if such spurious induction heating were allowed to occur, chamber pressure could be lost. The induction coil is 10 in. (25. 4 cm) long and is fitted with a specimen holder at its upper end. At its lower end, the induction coil is mounted on a ceramic base, which affords thermal insulation to prevent heating of the base of the chamber during use. A sapphire cylinder protects the coil against slag generated during an experiment. The induction coil is energized by a 6 -kW water-cooled power supply operating at a frequency of 400 kHz. The induction coil is part of a parallel-tuned circuit, the tuning of which is used to adjust the coupling of power to the specimen. The chamber is mounted on a test stand along with pumps, valves, and plumbing for transferring pressurized gas into and out of the chamber. In addition to multiple video cameras aimed through the windows encircling the chamber, the chamber is instrumented with gauges for monitoring the progress of an experiment. One of the gauges is a dual-frequency infrared temperature transducer aimed at the specimen through one window. Chamber operation is achieved via a console that contains a computer running apparatus-specific software, a video recorder, and real-time video monitors. For safety, a blast wall separates the console from the test stand...|$|E

A one-dimensional, two-layered transient heat conduction model is developed to predict the temperature response. The phase information of this temperature response shows high sensitivity to the change of thermal properties of the liquid layer and is employed to match experimental data to find the thermal properties of the test liquid. The measured thermal conductivities of water and ethylene glycol agree quite well with data from the literature and support the validity of this measurement technique. An aqueous fluid consisting of gold nanoparticles was also tested and anomalous thermal conductivity enhancement was observed. Our measurement results also showed a divergence of thermal transport behavior between nanofluids and pure liquids. This suggests a need to carefully examine the role of the measurement technique in the heat transfer experimental studies of nanofluids. For the study of flow property diagnostics, a heat transfer system with a periodic boundary condition in a steady flow field is examined. Due to linearity and homogeneity of the heat transfer system under certain conditions, a thermal wave field generated by a periodic heating flux at the boundary of the flow field may be used to detect important flow field parameters, such as the velocity gradient at the wall, and therefore, the wall shear stress. A wall shear stress sensor design with a heater and two temperature sensors on a silicon dioxide substrate is analyzed. The heater with a periodic heating source generates an oscillating temperature field which interacts with the flow field. The temperature sensors pick up the temperature response that contains information on the velocity gradient at the wall. Based on the above sensor design, a two-dimensional conjugate heat convection model is developed with a periodic heating flux at the solid/fluid interface and a linear velocity profile in the fluid domain. Two designs are studied, one with a silicon heat sink under the silicon dioxide substrate and another without the heat sink. The effects of the two main design parameters, the operating frequency and the distance between the heater and the temperature sensor, are discussed. A reasonable sensitivity of the phase information to the velocity gradient suggests a practical sensor design. A preliminary experimental test on a water channel flow has been conducted to support the concept of applying the thermal wave method to wall shear stress measurements...|$|E
