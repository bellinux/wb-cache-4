5|$|By this time, {{the first}} wave of what would {{eventually}} be more than four million letters, telegrams, postcards, and phone calls had flooded into RNC headquarters and other political offices. While a later study found that only about 7 percent of these communications addressed any <b>substantive</b> <b>issue,</b> they still ran 75 to one in favor of Nixon. Nixon skeptics joined in; both Stassen and Dewey sent congratulatory telegrams. Many letters included contributions {{to help pay for the}} cost of the broadcast; the RNC eventually recouped four-fifths of the $75,000 cost. Newspaper switchboards were jammed with calls from people seeking the RNC's address, while Western Union was caught off guard by Nixon's request that listeners wire the RNC, and had no extra help on hand. Checkers herself received enough dog food to last a year, and hundreds of collars, leashes, and toys.|$|E

500|$|The case, {{brought by}} Jackson {{and two other}} members of the Countryside Alliance, {{challenged}} the use of the Parliament Acts to enact the Hunting Act 2004. The appellants claimed that the Parliament Act 1911 could not be used to pass the Parliament Act 1949 which amended the 1911 Act; the Hunting Act, which was passed only in accordance with the modified as opposed to the original requirements of the Parliament Acts procedure, was therefore invalid. The Divisional Court and Court of Appeal both rejected this claim, although the Court of Appeal held that Parliament Acts procedure could not be used to effect [...] "fundamental constitutional changes". The case was appealed again to the House of Lords. In relation to preliminary issues, the court held that it had jurisdiction to examine the validity of the Hunting Act as a question of statutory interpretation (whether the 1911 Act could be used to enact the 1949 Act); standing was not challenged. On the <b>substantive</b> <b>issue,</b> the court ruled there were no limits to the type of legislation that could be passed using the Parliament Acts except for the express limitations contained in the legislation. The Parliament Act 1949 had therefore been validly passed using the 1911 Act and the Hunting Act was consequently also held to be an Act of Parliament. In obiter comments made in the judgment, Lord Steyn, Lord Hope and Baroness Hale suggested that there might be limits to parliamentary sovereignty (although Lord Bingham and Lord Carswell impliedly supported the orthodox view that there are no limits to parliamentary sovereignty).|$|E

2500|$|The {{question}} {{returned to}} the High Court in May 1907 in two cases heard together, Baxter v Commissioners of Taxation (NSW), in which the judgement addressed the <b>substantive</b> <b>issue,</b> and Flint v Webb, which addressed the applications for a certificate {{to appeal to the}} Privy Council. The decision of the Privy Council in Webb v Outtrim had been followed by Murray DCJ in the NSW District Court, finding that Baxter was liable to pay NSW income tax in respect of his salary as a Customs officer. Similarly the Court of Petty Sessions of Victoria had followed the Privy Council and had found that Flint was liable to pay Victorian income tax in respect of his salary in the Postmaster-General's Department. Both Baxter and Flint appealed directly to the High Court. [...] The Court held that these appeals concerned an inter se question such that an appeal lay to the High Court. The High Court [...] held that it was, {{in the absence of a}} certificate under s 74 of the Constitution, the ultimate arbiter on all inter se questions such that it was not bound to follow the decision of the Privy Council in Webb v Outtrim. The High Court reconsidered the position, but reaffirmed its decision in D'Emden v Pedder. Griffith CJ delivered the [...] "rather pugnacious judgment" [...] of the majority as follows : ...|$|E
