5|$|Historically, {{elephants}} {{were considered}} formidable instruments of war. They were equipped with armour {{to protect their}} sides, and their tusks were given <b>sharp</b> <b>points</b> of iron or brass if they were large enough. War elephants were trained to grasp an enemy soldier and toss him to the person riding on them or to pin the soldier {{to the ground and}} impale him.|$|E
5|$|Unlike earlier pterosaurs such as Rhamphorhynchus and Pterodactylus, Pteranodon had toothless beaks, {{similar to}} those of birds. Pteranodon beaks were made of solid, bony margins that {{projected}} {{from the base of the}} jaws. The beaks were long, slender, and ended in thin, <b>sharp</b> <b>points.</b> The upper jaw was longer than the lower jaw. The upper jaw was curved upward; while this normally has been attributed only to the upward-curving beak, one specimen (UALVP 24238) has a curvature corresponding with the beak widening towards the tip. While the tip of the beak is not known in this specimen, the level of curvature suggests it would have been extremely long. The unique form of the beak in this specimen led Alexander Kellner to assign it to a distinct genus, Dawndraco, in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Jasper <b>Sharp</b> <b>points</b> {{out that}} the Japanese and western views of Takechi's legacy are quite different. While western sources assess him as a major figure in the early {{development}} of the pink film, many current Japanese sources on the subject ignore his work. Sharp notes, however, that during his lifetime, he was covered prominently in Japanese sources. He speculates that his legacy has been largely forgotten in his homeland partly because of his status as an outsider in the Japanese film communities—both mainstream and pink. Since his films were self-produced and distributed by major film companies rather than through the eroduction circuit, they are not technically pink films. Also, his right-wing political background conflicts with the generally revolutionary stance more often associated with the pink film. Since his death in 1988, {{the lack of a}} studio or other publicist, or coverage by writers on the pink film has kept his work out of the public's eye in Japan. In the west, however, some of Takechi's films, such as Daydream were shown during their first runs, reviewed by major publications such as Variety, and have been preserved and remained available to genre audiences on home video releases.|$|E

5|$|The {{crinoline}} {{needed to}} be rigid enough to support the skirts in their accustomed shape, but also flexible enough to be temporarily pressed out of shape and spring back afterwards. Other materials used for crinolines included whalebone, gutta-percha and vulcanised caoutchouc (natural rubber). The idea of inflatable hoops was short-lived as they were easily punctured, prone to collapse, and due {{to the use of}} brimstone in the manufacture of rubber, they smelled unpleasant. Although hard rubber hoops of gutta-percha worked satisfactorily at first, they were brittle and easily crushed without recovering their form. Despite objections that the <b>sharp</b> <b>points</b> of snapped steels were hazardous, lightweight steel was clearly the most successful option. It reduced the number of petticoats and their weight, and offered increased freedom of movement of the legs. However, hasty or careless movements in a hoop skirt could lead to accidentally revealing more than intended. An advertisement published in The Lady's Newspaper in 1863 for a cage crinoline with waved hoops attempted to reassure the potential customer that while wearing it, activities such as climbing stairs, passing to her theatre seat, dropping into armchairs and leaning against furniture would be possible without hindrance either to herself or to others around her.|$|E
5|$|Wooden carvings in {{the shape}} of hawks, ancient gods, serpents and turtles are also popular. The Grand Huts, also known as grande case (chef's hut), are {{decorated}} with the filial of fleche faitiere representing the ancestral spirits, symbolic of transition between the world of the dead and the world of the living. The wood carving is shaped like the spear-like carving that adorns the top of the grande case. It comprises three parts; the flat crowned face representing the ancestor with a long, the rounded pole run through by conch shells mounted on it that represents the ancestor’s voice, and a base with the pole fixed to it to symbolise the link between the clan and the chief. The central piece is also flanked by wooden pieces with <b>sharp</b> <b>points</b> (facing downwards) that are intended to prevent bad spirits enveloping the ancestor in the central part. As it represented the power of the chiefs over their subjects, it was adopted as flag of the Kanaks by the organization leading the independent movement in New Caledonia. The arrow or the spear normally has a needle at the end to insert threaded shells from bottom to top. After the death of a Kanak chief, the fleche faitière is removed and his family takes it to their home. Though it was allowed to be used again as a sign of respect it is normally kept at burial grounds of noted citizens or at the mounds of abandoned grand houses.|$|E

25|$|On all claws {{preserved}} in the fossil — those of the feet have all been lost — horn sheaths are visible. These have a darker colouration on top than on the bottom {{which suggests that the}} original horn material is still present — but this has not yet been directly tested by a chemical analysis for fear of damaging these delicate structures that were seen as forming {{an essential part of the}} integrity of the precious specimen. The horn sheaths of the hand claws extend the bony cores by about 40%, scythe-like continuing the bone curve and ending in <b>sharp</b> <b>points.</b> On some claws the sheaths have partly detached; on others they have been flattened or split.|$|E
25|$|Hot {{shoes are}} placed in water to cool them off. The farrier then nails the shoes on, by driving the nails into the hoof wall at the white line of the hoof. The nails are shaped {{in such a way}} that they bend outward as they are driven in, {{avoiding}} the sensitive inner part of the foot, so they emerge on the sides of the hoof. When the nail has been completely driven, the farrier cuts off the <b>sharp</b> <b>points</b> and uses a clincher (a form of tongs made especially for this purpose) or a clinching block with hammer to bend the rest of the nail so it is almost flush with the hoof wall. This prevents the nail from getting caught on anything, and also helps to hold the nail, and therefore the shoe, in place.|$|E
25|$|There are older, {{traditional}} plant holders {{that may}} be used or one of the following modern counterparts can be selected: Pinpoint Holder, or kenzan, which is a steel or lead block with <b>sharp</b> <b>points</b> for use with thick and soft stems; Turtle Holder, or kame-dome, which is glass, metal, or actual turtle shells with holes made for stems; Crab Holder, or kani-dome, which is comparable to Turtle Holder, but with crab instead; Whirlpool holder, or kazesui-domei, that has two oblong shapes that are attached to imitate swirling water; and Tripod, or gotoku-dome, which is used to keep a kettle over a hibachi stove. Other plant holders include bundled straw or water lily stems, or komi-wara, which are utilized for portable arrangements, and another holder similar to komi-wara, florist oasis, which is a light foam usually used commercially. A Branch Holder, or kubari; Horse-Bit Holder, or kutsuwa-dome; Circle Holder, or shippo; and Slatty Holder, or yaen-kubari, may all be used to keep the arrangement in place.|$|E

500|$|North American had {{scoured the}} {{literature}} {{to find any}} additional advantage. This led them to an obscure report by two NACA wind tunnel experts, who wrote a report in 1956 titled [...] "Aircraft Configurations Developing High Lift-Drag Ratios at High Supersonic Speeds". Known today as compression lift, {{the idea was to}} use the shock wave generated off the nose or other <b>sharp</b> <b>points</b> on the aircraft as a source of high-pressure air. By carefully positioning the wing in relation to the shock, the shock's high pressure could be captured {{on the bottom of the}} wing and generate additional lift. To take maximum advantage of this effect, they redesigned the underside of the aircraft to feature a large triangular intake area far forward of the engines, better positioning the shock in relation to the wing. The former individually podded engines were repositioned in a single large duct under the fuselage.|$|E
500|$|With {{the rise}} of scholasticism {{and the decline of}} the Roman Empire, the atomic theory was {{abandoned}} for many ages in favor of the various four element theories and later alchemical theories. The 17th century, however, saw a resurgence in the atomic theory primarily through the works of Gassendi, and Newton. Among other scientists of that time Gassendi deeply studied ancient history, wrote major works about Epicurus natural philosophy and was a persuasive propagandist of it. He reasoned that to account for {{the size and shape of}} atoms moving in a void could account for the properties of matter. [...] Heat was due to small, round atoms; cold, to pyramidal atoms with <b>sharp</b> <b>points,</b> which accounted for the pricking sensation of severe cold; and solids were held together by interlacing hooks. Newton, though he acknowledged the various atom attachment theories in vogue at the time, i.e. “hooked atoms”, “glued atoms” (bodies at rest), and the “stick together by conspiring motions” theory, rather believed, as famously stated in [...] "Query 31" [...] of his 1704 Opticks, that particles attract one another by some force, which “in immediate contact is extremely strong, at small distances performs the chemical operations, and reaches not far from particles with any sensible effect.” ...|$|E

500|$|Banksia canei {{was first}} {{described}} in 1967 by James H. Willis, who had collected it on 27 November 1962 along the Mt. Seldom Seen {{track in the}} vicinity of Wulgulmerang, Victoria. Earlier collections include a specimen Ferdinand von Mueller had collected near Omeo in 1853, and one found by Richard Hind Cambage in 1908 near Kydra Peak. However, neither botanist considered this to be a new species at the time, instead holding it to be an unusual mountain form of the locally widespread B.marginata. Willis named the species after Victorian plantsman Bill Cane who had alerted authorities to the existence of an unusual banksia that was distinct from B.marginata some years previously. At the time, a plant collected from Mount Fulton near Port Davey in South West Tasmania was thought to be B.canei, but it was later reassessed as B.marginata. B.canei can be distinguished by its larger follicles and <b>sharp</b> <b>points</b> to the leaves. In his 1981 monograph of the genus Banksia, Alex George noted that despite a superficial resemblance to B.marginata, its bare old cones and stouter foliage indicated a closer relationship to B. integrifolia and [...] B.saxicola, although it lacks the latter species' whorled leaf arrangement. A fossil species, B. kingii from the late Pleistocene of Melaleuca Inlet in southwestern Tasmania, has robust foliage and infructescence resembling those of B.canei and B.saxicola, and appears to be a recently extinct relative. The leaf of a much older fossil species Banksieaephyllum acuminatum from Oligocene deposits in the Latrobe Valley closely resembles B.canei in shape, anatomy and vein pattern.|$|E

The stars of most Chicago Police officers (patrolmen through captain) are of silver-colored metal, with broad points. Command ranks have gold-colored stars with <b>sharp</b> <b>points.</b> A ring surrounding the full-color city seal in the star's center changes color for each rank within these two classifications. Like most American police forces, the officer's rank is written in an arc above the center element.|$|E
50|$|Holes {{could be}} ground out of stones {{with the use}} of <b>sharp</b> <b>pointed</b> stones or {{hardened}} sticks. By spinning the ground stone with one's hands and applying substantial pressure to the <b>sharp</b> <b>point</b> into the ground stone, a hole could be drilled into the stone with a large amount of time and effort. Sand would be used to help quicken the process by putting it in the partially formed hole as the <b>sharp</b> <b>point</b> was being pressed. The sand would help grind more of the stone away. To put a hole all the way through a piece of stone, it would be first drilled half way in one direction and be finished on the opposite side.|$|R
