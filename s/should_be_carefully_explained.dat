40|$|The {{study of}} Asia badly needs a {{paradigm}} shift. The difficulty is to manage its diversity. Merely to establish more centres for Asian studies within the continent {{is not the}} answer. It {{is more important to}} examine how the subject is being taught. It may appear that what ought to be advocated is an Asian-centric approach to the study of Asian societies. This same call was made at least half a century ago but the results have been disappointing because while this may sound right, it must be borne in mind that the traditional Asian approach to education has certain in-built weaknesses. An Asian-centric approach should not be an endeavour to revive and preserve the past even if it is no longer relevant. It should mean that common cultural practices in Asian societies <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>carefully</b> <b>explained,</b> not by assigning reasons which are culled from the cultural practices of other societies but by identifying, as accurately as possible, local beliefs even if they appear illogical...|$|E
40|$|Drug-drug {{interaction}} (DDI) is {{a challenging}} {{problem in the}} process of drug utilization. Inhibition of glucuronidation reaction of drugs is a major reason for DDI. The aim of the present study is to predict propofol-thienorphine interaction from the perspective of propofol’s inhibition towards thienorphine glucuronidation. The human liver microsomes (HLMs) incubation system supplemented with uridine 5 ’-diphosphoglucuronic acid (UDPGA) was used. The results showed that propofol inhibited HLMscatalyzed thienorphine glucuronidation in a concentration-dependent manner. Both Dixon plot and Lineweaver-Burk plot showed that the inhibition of thienorphine glucuronidation by propofol was best fit to competitive inhibition, and the second plot using slopes from Lineweaver-Burk plot versus thienorphine concentration was used to determine the inhibition kinetic parameter (Ki) value to be 365. 9 μM. Whether the in vitro inhibition of propofol towards thienorphine glucuronidation can induce the in vivo propofolthienorphine interaction might be influenced by many factors, including various pharmacokinetic factors influencing the in vivo concentration of propofol. These data <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>carefully</b> <b>explained</b> due to complicated factors influencing the in vitro-in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) results...|$|E
40|$|Pervasive games combine {{real world}} and virtual game {{elements}} in game design. A player might need to find WiFi hot spots, move to different locations based on mobile network cell IDs, or to do certain tasks {{at different times of}} the day. These are just few examples how the real world elements can be utilized in game design. The possibilities for using this kind of context information seem versatile, but there is very little knowledge about how players perceive these features. In this paper, we describe a user study where we investigated utilization of multiple context information types in a pervasive mobile game. The results indicate that context information creates a new challenge layer to the game as the players also need to consider issues outside the game world. In addition, the players found context utilization interesting, but it <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>carefully</b> <b>explained</b> for what purposes context elements are used in the game design. If the players do not understand the connection between the context and the game design, the feature is not attractive. In our study, time of the day was perceived as the most interesting context information in the game because the utilization was straightforward and easily understood by the players...|$|E
40|$|Annually {{reproducing}} wild yam species (Dioscorea praehensilis and D. semperflorens) {{are considered}} {{to be the most important}} food for hunter-gatherer subsistence in terms of energy sources in the central African rainforests. Despite their importance in the rainforest hunter-gatherer's diet, annual yams are not widely distributed over the forest but locally concentrated in particular areas. In this study, I carried out vegetation censuses in two areas, one with abundant annual yam patches and one with few in southeastern Cameroon. The results indicate that the area with abundant annual yam patches is closely associated with the semi-deciduous forest, while the area with few patches was associated with the evergreen forest. Thus the difference in vegetation seems to affect the distribution and the availability of annual yam patches. However, recent studies have found evidence of historical human interventions that may have influenced the formation of semi-deciduous forest over the Congo Basin. Therefore, the degree of human influence on the distribution of the semi-deciduous forest itself, as well as that of annual yam patches, <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>carefully</b> examined to <b>explain</b> the abundance of annual yams...|$|R

40|$|To date, most {{genome-wide}} association studies (GWAS) {{and studies}} of fine-scale population structure {{have been conducted}} primarily on Europeans. Han Chinese, the largest ethnic group in the world, composing 20 % of the entire global human population, is largely underrepresented in such studies. A well-recognized challenge {{is the fact that}} population structure can cause spurious associations in GWAS. In this study, we examined population substructures in a diverse set of over 1700 Han Chinese samples collected from 26 regions across China, each genotyped at ∼ 160 K single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Our results showed that the Han Chinese population is intricately substructured, with the main observed clusters corresponding roughly to northern Han, central Han, and southern Han. However, simulated case-control studies showed that genetic differentiation among these clusters, although very small (FST = 0. 0002 ∼ 0. 0009), is sufficient to lead to an inflated rate of false-positive results even when the sample size is moderate. The top two SNPs with the greatest frequency differences between the northern Han and southern Han clusters (FST > 0. 06) were found in the FADS 2 gene, which associates with the fatty acid composition in phospholipids, and in the HLA complex P 5 gene (HCP 5), which associates with HIV infection, psoriasis, and psoriatic arthritis. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) showed that most differentiated genes among clusters are involved in cardiac arteriopathy (p < 10 − 101). These signals indicating significant differences among Han Chinese subpopulations <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>carefully</b> <b>explained</b> in case they are also detected in association studies, especially when sample sources are diverse...|$|E
40|$|Growing {{evidence}} indicates {{that the effects of}} antiepileptic drugs on childhood epilepsies are partly linked to the specific type of epilepsy or epilepsy syndrome. Most (but not all) types of epilepsy can be classified into categories that are conceptually meaningful. It is likewise logical to set treatment targets and to estimate the risks according to the main syndromic groups, as they share common, electroclinical presentations and long-term prognosis. Treatment should then be adjusted to each patient chracteristics. Treatment should be started soon, whenever there is indication that delay would harm the child. However, if seizures are not disabling, treatment may be delayed, in order to acquire more pression of the disorder and the plan thoughtfully explained to the parents. In children presenting with partial symptomatic or cryptogenic epilepsy, it is important to assess the patient's response to several different drugs. However, in patients regarded as having refractory epilepsy, possibilities for a surgical solution must be evaluated early {{in the course of the}} disease. In severe epileptic encephalopathies, complete seizure control is impossible and, ideally, treatment should provide as much integration and autonomy, with alleviation of frequent seizures. Again, this <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>carefully</b> <b>explained</b> to the parents. In children with severe epileptiform EEG abnormalities coexisting with brain dysfunction (diffuse or specific), the extent of EEG-related neurological dysfunction should be determined, and vigorous treatment should be started to abate its effects. Finally, seizures could be worsened by inappropriate drugs, paradoxical reaction or intoxication. Severe childhood epilepsies are particularly at risk and mild idiopathic epilepsies may be transformed into severe disorders, priming a vicious circle of heavy treatment, whereby the original disorder is no longer recognizable...|$|E
40|$|Background: Blacks {{have one}} of the highest rates of end stage renal disease in the U. S. but receive living kidney {{donations}} at a far lower rate than Whites. Transplant programs in the U. S. work to promote autonomous decision making in living organ donors. However, there may be racial differences in preferences for involving family in important decisions such as donation and in the amount of family stress prior to donation. Purpose: To explore differences in preferred family involvement in the decision to donate and to examine differences in family and financial stress between Black and White kidney donor candidates. Methods: In interviews during donor evaluation, we asked how donors preferred to involve family in the decision to donate. We also measured family stress and family income. Three months after donation we interviewed donors about their satisfaction with their care while in the hospital and after discharge. Results: Among 174 living kidney donors, Blacks who made up 21 % of the sample, were younger (p =. 01), had higher levels of family stress in the year before donation, p =. 01) and {{were more likely to report}} a total household annual income of 40, 000 or less (p =. 001) than Whites. Blacks were more likely to donate to a family member than a non-family member but were more likely to say that they made the decision to donate without family input (p =. 01) than Whites. At three months, there were no significant differences in satisfaction with care during and after hospitalization between Blacks and Whites respectively. Conclusions: Transplant professionals should be aware that Black donor candidates may have greater levels of family stress than White donors. The lack of racial differences in the experience of donation may provide some reassurance to Black donor candidates who worry that they might have a more negative experience compared to White donor candidates. Financial risks <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>carefully</b> <b>explained</b> or support considered for donors with limited income who might more readily suffer negative financial consequences if recovery takes longer than anticipated. ...|$|E

40|$|The Aboriginal Land Rights Commission {{ran from}} 1973 to 1974 {{and had the}} purpose of inquiring into {{appropriate}} ways to recognise Aboriginal land rights in the Northern Territory. Gough Whitlam had appointed Justice Edward Woodward to run the Commission, which {{became known as the}} 2 ̆ 7 Woodward Royal Commission 2 ̆ 7. This is the first time digitised versions of the Commission 2 ̆ 7 s reports have been made publically available. The Commission produced two reports. The first report was presented to the Australian Government in July 1973. One of its key recommendations was the establishment of land councils in the Central and Northern regions of the NT to represent the views of Aboriginal people. These councils were subsequently established. The Commission 2 ̆ 7 s second report was presented to the Australian Government in April 1974 was based on the land councils 2 ̆ 7 submissions. The second report recommended that land rights legislation be introduced with the following requirements: "(i) Aboriginal land rights legislation should be introduced into the Australian Parliament. It should not be capable of being affected by Northern Territory Ordinances. (ii) A number of consequential changes to Ordinances of the Northern Territory will be required. (iii) The operation of existing legislation relating to Aboriginal reserves should be preserved, at least for some time. (iv) The establishment of Aboriginal regional councils in the States should be encouraged. (v) Those councils should have administrative assistance to hold meetings and legal aid to formulate land rights claims. (vi) There should be consultation between regions, which could be arranged under the guidance of the National Aboriginal Consultative Committee. (vii) The respective claims of the regional councils should finally be sent to the government for consideration. (viii) The Central Australian Reserves in Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory should be jointly administered if common or reasonably parallel legislation can be agreed upon. (ix) In the meantime there should be as much co-operation as possible across the State borders. The communities in the States having affiliations with Northern Territory communities should be represented on the Central Land Council. Any requests by the Central Land Council for action in the States should be sympathetically considered. The costs of the Council of its involvement across State borders should be separately funded from appropriate government sources. (x) All arrangements resulting from this report should be formally reviewed in conferences between the Land Councils and the government at regular intervals. The first such conference should be held after three years and thereafter at seven year intervals. (xi) The main recommendations of this report <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>carefully</b> <b>explained</b> to Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory. To assist in achieving that purpose they should be translated into Aboriginal languages. " These reports were the foundation of Australia 2 ̆ 7 s first land rights legislation, introduced by the Fraser government in 1976 and passed with bipartisan support.
