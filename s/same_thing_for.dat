5|$|As {{a thought}} {{experiment}} in economics, many international trade economists {{have found this}} simplified and idealized {{version of the story}} important due to its ability to simplify the complexities of the real world. The implicit assumption is that the study of a one agent economy will provide useful insights into the functioning of a real world economy with many economic agents. This article pertains to the study of consumer behaviour, producer behaviour and equilibrium as a part of microeconomics. In other fields of economics, the Robinson Crusoe economy framework is used for essentially the <b>same</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>For</b> example, in public finance the Robinson Crusoe economy is used to study the various types of public goods and certain aspects of collective benefits. It is used in growth economics to develop growth models for underdeveloped or developing countries to embark upon a steady growth path using techniques of savings and investment.|$|E
25|$|Some {{commentators}} also {{assert that}} there is an inconsistent reaction towards various countries whose media is guilty of the <b>same</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>For</b> example, the Egyptian newspaper El Fagr published 6 of the Muhammad cartoons during Ramadan with no apparent adverse reaction.|$|E

For your faith to be more important than your job, for your family to be more important than that job.... We all know that's the way it should be, but we're afraid to say that sometimes. Lovie's not afraid to say it and I'm not afraid to say it.|$|E

25|$|During {{this entire}} period, {{there had been}} a {{constant}} stream of Errata, and later Addenda (which amounted to the <b>same</b> <b>thing).</b> <b>For</b> a long time, {{the vast majority of the}} mail received was from the top few fanatical SFB players, who constantly campaigned for new rules, rules fixes, and rules changes. This became a source of discontent for most of the rest of the players, who did not appreciate a game that changed every few months, and needed a sheaf of notes along with the voluminous rules. However, it was generally believed nearly impossible to repair the damage by properly re-writing and re-integrating such a large and complex system into a new edition before doomsday, especially without bringing the product line to a halt while only new versions of old products were released.|$|E
25|$|To {{preserve}} the dramatic opening sequences of his films, Lucas wanted the screen credits {{to come at}} the end of the films. While this practice has become more common over the years, this was a highly unusual choice at the time. The Writers and Directors Guilds of America had no problem allowing it on Star Wars, back in 1977, because the writer-director credit (George Lucas) matched the company name, but when Lucas did the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> the sequel it became an issue because Lucas had his last name on the start of the film (Lucasfilm), while the director and the writers had theirs on the end. They fined him over $250,000 and attempted to pull Empire out of theaters. The DGA also attacked Kershner; to protect his director, Lucas paid all the fines to the guilds. Due to the controversy, he left the Directors and Writers Guilds, and the Motion Picture Association.|$|E
25|$|A dog's cranium is 15% {{smaller than}} an equally heavy wolf's, {{and the dog}} is less {{aggressive}} and more playful. Other species pairs show similar differences. Bonobos, like chimpanzees, are a close genetic cousin to humans, but unlike the chimpanzees, bonobos are not aggressive and {{do not participate in}} lethal inter-group aggression or kill within their own group. The most distinctive features of a bonobo are its cranium, which is 15% smaller than a chimpanzee's, and its less aggressive and more playful behavior. In other examples, the guinea pig's cranium is 13% smaller than its wild cousin the cavy, and domestic fowl show a similar reduction to their wild cousins. Possession of a smaller cranium for holding a smaller brain is a telltale sign of domestication. Bonobos appear to have domesticated themselves. In the farm fox experiment, humans selectively bred foxes against aggression, causing domestication syndrome. The foxes were not selectively bred for smaller craniums and teeth, floppy ears, or skills at using human gestures, but these traits were demonstrated in the friendly foxes. Natural selection favors those that are the most successful at reproducing, not the most aggressive. Selection against aggression made possible the ability to cooperate and communicate among foxes, dogs and bonobos. Perhaps it did the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> humans. The more docile animals have been found to have less testosterone than their more aggressive counterparts, and testosterone controls aggression and brain size. One researcher has argued that in becoming more social, we humans have developed a smaller brain than those of humans 20,000 years ago.|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} {{business model}} of the company was commercial hat production of harvest straw hats. [...] On the micro-economic level, St. Louis had become a center of hat manufacturing during the Second Industrial Revolution. [...] In 1900, 129 businesses in St. Louis were producing custom hats for women, with approximately 600 employees in the industry. [...] Within the decade, St. Louis was the fifth largest producer of fur felt hats. [...] International Harvest Hat proposed to do the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> straw harvest hats, by ramping up production capacity and challenging the manufacturing centers in Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey. [...] The timing of market entry was favorable to the company's goals, as the organization was established at the peak decade of the commercial hat apparel market. [...] In 1910, over 42 million hats were produced in the United States, an all-time record for domestic production.|$|E
500|$|As a child, Mars {{spent time}} impersonating Elvis Presley. This playact {{had a major}} impact on his musical evolution; he later reflected: I watch the best. I'm a big fan of Elvis. I'm a big fan of 1950s Elvis when he would go on stage and scare people because he was a force and girls would go nuts! You can say the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> Prince or The Police. It's just guys who know that people are here to see a show, so I watch those guys and I love {{studying}} them because I'm a fan." [...] He also impersonated Michael Jackson and Little Richard, both of whom are major inspirations of his. Mars was raised on his father’s doo-wop collection — “simple four-chord songs that got straight to the point” and on Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis,and Frankie Lymon. The hip-hop productions by The Neptunes and Timbaland, that were played on the radio constantly, also influenced him.|$|E

He noted the negative reception from fans concerning the low number of recognizable characters like Coulson, but pointed out that fans seemed to have grown to like the series' original characters as they had been developed over time. He explained that with the increasing number of characters and complex relationships in the series, having different pairings and building new emotional relationships was important, and stated that [...] "whether it's a quiet moment or in action, we [...] deepen the audience's love and concern, and hopes for these characters." [...] A year later he reiterated the producer's intention to create a tradition moving forward of [...] "finding new combinations and new conflicts" [...] between different sets of characters, given [...] "a lot of procedurals [...] the same people doing the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> five years and the character don't evolve or change at all." ...|$|E

500|$|The season {{shifts to}} the later 10 pm timeslot, {{allowing}} it {{to take on a}} darker, more mature tone than previous seasons. According to Tancharoen, [...] "The whole tagline for this year is Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. After Dark'." [...] The timeslot gave the series the opportunity to present an increased level of violence and partial nudity, as well as take more risks and present edgier themes. Following the third-season finale, Tancharoen stated that the fourth season would explore the guilt Daisy Johnson has over Lincoln Campbell's death. Executive producer Jeffrey Bell noted the writers tried to continue the tradition of [...] "finding new combinations and new conflicts" [...] between different sets of characters, given [...] "a lot of procedurals [...] the same people doing the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> five years". Pairings that would be explored included Coulson and Mack, continuing from the end of season three, who have a mutual respect for one another due to their relationships with Johnson, and Leo Fitz and Holden Radcliffe, who work together. The Fitz-Simmons relationship was also explored more, examining the new challenges it presented for the two [...] "working together, loving each other and living together." ...|$|E
500|$|Businessweek {{attributed}} the sales success of Mandatory Fun to the viral music video campaign. ABC World News elaborated that Yankovic's success {{is in part}} due to the Internet's interest in viral and humorous videos catching up with what Yankovic has been doing for his entire career. Yankovic himself was amazed with the response he got from the album and video releases, stating that [...] "I've been doing the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> 30 years {{and all of a sudden}} I'm having the best week of my life" [...] and that he [...] "kind of stumbled on my formula for the future". He also stated, [...] "A No. 1 album is something I never had in my wildest dreams ever thought would be a reality." [...] The total collection of videos had acquired more than 46 million views within 10 days of the album's release, and six of the eight videos reached the top position on the Billboard Twitter Real-Time Trending 140 chart during that week. In contrast, Yankovic's video for [...] "Perform This Way", the lead single off Alpocalypse, only received 16.8 million views in the three years since its release, while an individual video from Mandatory Fun, like [...] "Tacky", received 12.8 million views within the first week.

5000|$|The term [...] is {{sometimes}} referred to as the centrifugal term, and the term [...] as the Coriolis term. For example, see Shankar. Although these equations bear some resemblance in form to the centrifugal and Coriolis effects found in rotating reference frames, nonetheless these are not the <b>same</b> <b>things.</b> <b>For</b> example, the physical centrifugal and Coriolis forces appear only in non-inertial frames of reference. In contrast, these terms, that appear when acceleration is expressed in polar coordinates, are a mathematical consequence of differentiation; these terms appear wherever polar coordinates are used. In particular, these terms appear even when polar coordinates are used in inertial frames of reference, where the physical centrifugal and Coriolis forces never appear.|$|R

In the second view, people are most likely to rebel when a consistently improving situation (especially an improving economy) stops and makes a turn for the worse.
