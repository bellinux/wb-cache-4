A name has a type, and a taxonomist (having defined the taxon) can determine which existing types fall within the scope of the taxon.

40|$|Background: It is {{essential}} to have a proper vessel route to do hemodialysis that is done by applying A-V fistula. In the current study complications and patency rate of side to side anastomosis with distal limb venous ligation have been evaluated during one year follow up. Materials and methods: This study was carried out on 62 randomized CRF patients who received AVF <b>by</b> <b>side</b> to side anastomosis and patency rate of this technique were evaluated in six months and one year periods. Results: Complications were reported in 12. 9, {{the vast majority of}} which were mild and none of them needed reoperation. The patency rate revealed to be 93. 56. Conclusion: AVF <b>by</b> <b>side</b> to side anastomosis with distal venous limb ligation can have low complication and high patency rate. However, a longer time follow up and comparing with other techniques are needed for more accurate conclusions...|$|R

The fact that pennies of different specifications circulated <b>side</b> <b>by</b> <b>side</b> precluded the weighing of quantities of copper coin to ascertain the value. Both sorts of pennies were deemed too heavy for daily use. The copper coins were so heavy that Charles Dickens in Nicholas Nickleby had Mr Mantalini contemplate suicide by drowning himself in the Thames, his pockets filled with halfpennies.|$|E

Certainly the knight bears the Willington armorials on the chest of his surcoat: (gules) a saltire vair, as can be seen from the Stothard drawing, but which is now barely visible on the monument itself.
