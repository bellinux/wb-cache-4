5|$|As {{described}} in attachment theory, infants {{need to develop}} a relationship with a primary caregiver to achieve normal social and emotional development. A key part of the ability to develop this relationship may be joint attention. In addition to language development, joint attention serves the function of preparing infants for more complex social structures involved in adult conversation. Children's skills in initiating and responding to joint attention predict their social competence at 30 months of age. Anticipatory <b>smiling</b> (a low level form of joint attention involving <b>smiling</b> at an object then turning the smile to one's communicative partner) at 9 months positively predicts parent-rated social competence scores at 30 months in infants. Early joint attention abilities account for differences in social and emotional abilities in later life.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: This {{study was}} undertaken: (1) To {{establish}} static norms {{in the central}} India population for the various <b>smile</b> parameters. (2) To analyze and quantify the sexual dimorphism of esthetic <b>smile.</b> Settings and Design: Hundred subjects (50 males and 50 females) {{with an average age}} of 14. 5 years with a pleasing <b>smile</b> were selected for the study. Static photographs with posed <b>smile</b> in natural head position (NHP) were taken. Materials and Methods: Following <b>smile</b> parameters were quantified using Adobe Photoshop ruler software: Maxillary incisor exposure (MIE) (mm), <b>smile</b> index (SI) (mm), <b>smile</b> arc, buccal corridor ratio (%), Most posterior maxillary tooth visible, anterior height of the <b>smile</b> (%), posterior height of the <b>smile</b> (%). Statistical Analysis: The data were compiled systematically. Statistical analysis was done using Statistical Package of Social Sciences (SPSS version 17. 0). For MIE and SI, Unpaired t-test was applied. Chi-square test was applied for most posterior maxillary tooth visible, <b>smile</b> arc buccal corridor, anterior height of <b>smile,</b> and posterior height of <b>smile.</b> Results: The mean value of MIE was found to be 7. 76 mm and 8. 82 mm in boys and girls, respectively. SI showed a mean value of 8. 26 for boys and 7. 91 for girls. Girls displayed second premolar commonly in contrast to boys, who displayed first premolar.

40|$|<b>SMILE</b> (small {{heterodimer}} partner interacting {{leucine zipper}} protein) {{has been identified}} as a coregulator in ER signaling. In this study, we have examined the effects of <b>SMILE</b> on other NRs (nuclear receptors). <b>SMILE</b> inhibits GR, CAR and HNF 4 α-mediated transactivation. Knockdown of <b>SMILE</b> gene expression increases the transactivation of the NRs. <b>SMILE</b> interacts with GR, CAR and HNF 4 α in vitro and in vivo. <b>SMILE</b> and these NRs colocalize in the nucleus. <b>SMILE</b> binds to the ligand-binding domain or AF 2 domain of the NRs. Competitions between <b>SMILE</b> and the coactivators GRIP 1 or PGC- 1 α have been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, an intrinsic repressive activity of <b>SMILE</b> is observed in Gal 4 -fusion system, and the intrinsic repressive domain is mapped to the C-terminus of <b>SMILE,</b> spanning residues 203 – 354. Moreover, <b>SMILE</b> interacts with specific HDACs (histone deacetylases) and SMILE-mediated repression is released by HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A, in a NR-specific manner. Finally, ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation) assays reveal that <b>SMILE</b> associates with the NRs on the target gene promoters. Adenoviral overexpression of <b>SMILE</b> represses GR-, CAR- and HNF 4 α-mediated target gene expression. Overall, these results suggest that <b>SMILE</b> functions as a novel corepressor of NRs via competition with coactivators and the recruitment of HDACs...|$|R

40|$|<b>Smile</b> is a non-verbal {{communication}} to express spontaneous feelings and emotions. Most patients {{that come to}} have orthodontic treatments {{want to have an}} attractive <b>smile,</b> but before the treatment <b>smile</b> has not yet been studied. There are eight components to make ideal frontal smile: lip line, <b>smile</b> arc, upper lip curve, buccal corridor, symmetry of <b>smile,</b> occlusal plane, dental and gingival components. This study was descriptive in design, in order to obtain frontal <b>smile</b> description before orthodontic treatment of RSGMP FKG UI patients that were grouped according to facial form, age, and gender. The results of the study show that patient <b>smile</b> before orthodontic treatment frequently exhibits medium lip line and the mean of incisor display at 75 % of clinical crown.

On the <b>smile</b> arc, the most common features are straight <b>smile</b> and consonant <b>smile.</b> Equally common <b>smile</b> arc positions are those touching and not touching lower lip.
