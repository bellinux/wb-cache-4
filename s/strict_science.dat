50|$|Creationism arose {{during the}} 20th {{century as a}} result of various other {{historical}} developments. When the modern evolutionary synthesis overcame the eclipse of Darwinism {{in the first half of}} the 20th century, American fundamentalist Christians began opposing the teaching of the theory of evolution in public schools. They introduced numerous laws to this effect, one of which was notoriously upheld by the Scopes Trial.In the second half of the century the Space Race caused a renewed interest in science and worry that the USA was falling behind on the Soviet Union. <b>Stricter</b> <b>science</b> standards were adopted and led to the re-introduction of the theory of evolution in the curriculum. The laws against teaching evolution were now ruled unconstitutional, because they violated the separation of church and state. Attempting to evade this ruling, the Christian fundamentalists produced a supposedly secular alternative to evolution, Creationism. Perhaps the most influential publication of this new pseudoscience was The Genesis Flood by young earth creationists John C. Whitcomb and Henry M. Morris.|$|R

Friendship, like the immortality[289] of the soul, is too good to be believed. The lover, beholding his maiden, half knows that she is not verily that which he worships; and in the golden hour of friendship, we are {{surprised}} with shades of suspicion and unbelief. We doubt that we bestow on our hero the virtues in which he shines, and afterward worship the form to which we have ascribed this divine inhabitation. In strictness, the soul does not respect men as it respects itself. In <b>strict</b> <b>science,</b> all persons underlie the same condition of an infinite remoteness. Shall we fear to cool our love by mining for the metaphysical foundation of this Elysian temple?[290] Shall I not be as real as the things I see? If I am, I shall not fear to know them for what they are. Their essence is not less beautiful than their appearance, though it needs finer organs for its apprehension. The root of the plant is not unsightly to science, though for chaplets and festoons we cut the stem short. And I must hazard the production of the bald fact amid these pleasing reveries, though it should prove an Egyptian skull at our banquet.[291] A man who stands united with his thought, conceives magnificently to himself. He is conscious of a universal success,[292] even though bought by uniform particular failures. No advantages, no powers, no gold or force can be any match for him. I cannot choose but rely on my own poverty, more than on your wealth. I cannot make your consciousness tantamount to mine. Only the star dazzles; the planet has a faint, moon-like ray. I hear what you say of the admirable parts and tried temper of the party you praise, but I see well that for all his purple cloaks I shall not like him, unless he is at least a poor Greek like me. I cannot deny it, O friend, that the vast shadow of the Phenomenal includes thee, also, in its pied and painted immensity,--thee, also, compared with whom all else is shadow. Thou art not Being, as Truth is, as Justice is,--thou art not my soul, but a picture and effigy of that. Thou hast come to me lately, and already thou art seizing thy hat and cloak. It is not that the soul puts forth friends, as the tree puts forth leaves, and presently, by the germination of new buds, extrudes the old leaf?[293] The law of nature is alternation forevermore. Each electrical state superinduces the opposite. The soul environs itself with friends, that it may enter into a grander self-acquaintance or solitude; and it goes alone, for a season, that it may exalt its conversation or society. This method betrays itself along the whole history of our personal relations. The instinct of affection revives the hope of union with our mates, and the returning sense of insulation recalls us from the chase. Thus every man passes his life in the search after friendship, and if he should record his true sentiment, he might write a letter like this, to each new candidate for his love:-- ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} James Conant’s pragmatic {{theory of}} science – {{a theory that}} has been neglected by most commentators {{on the history of}} 20 th-century philosophy of science – and it argues that this theory occupied an important place in Conant’s strategic thinking about the Cold War. Conant drew upon his wartime science policy work, the history of science, and Quine’s epistemological holism to argue that there is no <b>strict</b> distinction between <b>science</b> and technology, {{that there is no such}} thing as “the scientific method,” and that theories are better interpreted as policies rather than creeds. An important consequence that he drew from these arguments is that science is both a thoroughly value-laden, and an intrinsically social, enterprise. These results led him to develop novel proposals for reorganizing scientific and technological research – proposals that he believed could help to win the Cold War. Interestingly, the Cold War had a different impact upon Conant’s thinking than it did upon many other theorists of science in postwar America. Instead of leading him to “the icy slopes of logic,” it led him to develop a socially- and politically-engaged theory that was explicitly in the service of the American Cold War effort...|$|R

Indicators from eight areas of knowledge, used by CAPES (Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education) to assess the level of internationalization of the postgraduate programs, are presented to support the arguments. The authors contend that: a) internationalization is not a theme limited to the <b>strict</b> framework of <b>science</b> and technology, requiring knowledge of cultural, educational, economic and political aspects; b) different axioms and rules apply to different areas of knowledge; c) collaboration with researchers from different centers can be more beneficial than focusing only on publishing in foreign periodicals; d) coordination and collaboration between researchers does not require alignment of national research agenda {{to the standards of}} foreign research centers. Indeed, internationalization is recognized and is rapidly developing in academic institutions and support agencies. In this process, challenges are presented to postgraduate programs: a) to ensure that communication extrapolates the limit of the Portuguese language and is in the language appropriate to the context of the student/researcher; b) to reduce bureaucratic obstacles that hinder cooperation in Brazilian universities; c) to support arrangements and policies that facilitate joint funding proposals with other countries that benefit Brazilian science and technology...|$|R

40|$|The current {{scientific}} methods describing {{gardens and}} landscapes {{all over the}} world are not always sufficient for the purpose of deep understanding of specific and close relations between landscape/garden and its inhabitants/visitors. A new dimension of qualitative investigation of these phenomena and relations between humans and the environment, as distinguished from the common mechanistic methods, has to be acquired. While a systematic anti-mechanistic research on the interaction of humans and living space is carried out especially in the United Kingdom and the United States, Continental Europe persist mechanistic in its core. In Continental Europe phenomenology as well as hermeneutics are regarded mostly as the particular areas of abstract philosophical studies that do not refer enough to practical sciences such as, for example, garden and landscape architecture. However, there are some especially transatlantic centres of applied phenomenological research. This article examines the phenomenological and hermeneutical approach as it might be used to explore the specific field of garden and landscape issues. In the first step, the nature of hermeneutics and phenomenology as compared to the common mechanistic scientific methods is discussed and the parallels between hermeneutics and phenomenology are outlined. Then, using the phenomenological method helps we give evidence on the fundamental categories of garden and landscape. These categories, in contrast to mechanistic constructions, represent garden and landscape as they are intimately experienced by humans. The focus of this research is both methodological (it is an effort to articulate a method alternative to the objectivity and abstraction of <b>strict</b> <b>science,</b> to be used in the field of garden and landscape architecture and related areas) and hermeneutical (it is an effort to achieve a deeper and profound understanding of garden and landscape as the irreplaceable base for every responsible interaction, whether scientific, creative, or other, with garden and landscape) ...|$|E

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} {{students}} in first year environmental science degree programs where traditionally mathematical emphasis {{has been much}} less than the <b>strict</b> <b>science</b> or math majors. The importance now placed in applied mathematics means that students need to gain more conceptual and quantitative knowledge in not only the environmental degree programs but also in most if not all non-mathematical majors. In this study, the authors attempt to gain insights into why students fail in mathematical courses where the mathematical requirements are not as demanding as other strict math degree programs. This is done by examining student conceptual thinking patterns and strategies as evident in student prepared scripts. A total of 133 students were requested to prepare a focus sheet to summarize their knowledge on topics learned but they were also told that the focus sheets could be used in exams for notes. This motivated their sheet preparation. The students prepared weekly summaries and later revised and summarized them for later use. Detailed examination of such sheets allowed researchers to study studentsâ knowledge in terms procedural work, math skills, strategies and conceptual knowledge. A study of linear, quadratic and limit sections led to interesting insights not only regarding revision strategies, knowledge of content, but also conceptual and procedural knowledge base and higher order skills such as problem solving focus. Logical and creative competencies were assessed in terms of how and what student focused upon or linked to in order to facilitate application of knowledge. The results show average levels of procedural and conceptual competence but rather low levels in logical and creative competence in preparation of scripts. Almost 50 % lacked competency in procedural work while around 54 % lacked conceptual competency. Given the emphasis placed procedural skills by students, the levels were lower than expected. However, the lack of structure in their work and deeper levels of understanding of links between the topics learned was concerning. These findings have implications for the first year mathematics teaching teams at universities especially the non-specialist mathematical majors...|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{there have}} been intense discussions about the {{humanities}} and their role in society. Internationally, {{as well as in}} a Swedish context, the humanities have been regarded to be in a state of crisis. However, these discussions usually demonstrate a lack of historical perspectives based on thorough empirical research. The notion of a crisis needs to be historicized. In this study, a case is being examined where the relationship between science and society was renegotiated. In the context of World War II, a discourse has been identified in a borderland between science and politics through an analysis of Swedish journals and anthologies during the time period 1937 - 1947. Historical actors were then highlighting that the humanities faced several challenges. The study argues that these discussions should be regarded as parts of a renegotiation of the humanities’ social contract. In the context of the war and fundamental societal changes, there occurred a greater pressure than before to mobilize science socially in order to make science appear as a legitimate undertaking. For the humanities, such demands seemed to conflict with their scientific ethos. During the interwar period this ethos was often based on a norm that demanded the drawing of a <b>strict</b> boundary between <b>science</b> and politics. But if they did not mobilize socially, scholars risked getting blamed for being isolated in the so-called ‘ivory tower’. How the humanities could be effectively mobilized in order to satisfy the needs of society while still maintaining their legitimacy in a scientific context emerged as a fundamental problem with no clear solutions. Part of this problem was the exclusion of the humanities from politically hegemonic narratives of society’s development, in contrast to natural and social sciences. Reactions to specific historical experiences and distinct expectations for the future thus seem – at least on a discursive level – to have put the humanities in a state of marginalization as early as the time period examined in this thesis...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis is to reconstruct and analyse the dynamic emergence and the institutionalization of the Flemish environmental health arrangement. More precisely, the impact of new discourses on environmental health and changing thoughts regarding complexity on the institutionalization process is investigated. Complexity reveals at two levels. Complexity {{at the level of}} variables refers to its multi-dimensional character (its embeddedness in a broader physical, social, economic and political context), multi-causality (multiple sources, agents, pathways, exposures, health effects), non-linear behaviours, long delay periods between cause and effect, cross-bordering time and scale, and the unclear sense of all consequences and/or the cumulative impact of collective action. As a consequence, complex problems are intrinsically clouded with uncertainties and imperfect understanding. Second, environmental health problems are complex at the societal level. After all, these problems are interwoven with moral, financial, economic, environmental, socio-cultural, and socio-political norms and values, resulting in a plurality of legitimate – often conflicting and controversial – perspectives. These two key features of complexity – radical uncertainty and a plurality of legitimate perspectives – induce challenges for science, politics, and the science-policy interface. As such, complexity goes parallel with three related shifts: 1) beyond the modern positivistic epistemology, characterized by rationality, full knowability and disciplinary reductionism towards Post-Normal Science and co-production of knowledge; 2) from traditional, sectoral policy arrangements and levels within government towards multi-actor and multi-sector governance; and 3) towards new types of boundary arrangements at the science-policy interface, reconsidering the role of knowledge, as science is no longer the unquestioned source of legitimacy for policy arguments. From a discursive institutional perspective, the assumption is that new and changing discourses are the driving forces behind institutional dynamics, challenging the development of novel organizational facilities and methodological tools, within the (scientific) knowledge-production as well as the (political) decision-making processes. In order to study the impact of the newly emerging discourses about environmental health and complexity on the institutionalization process of the Flemish environmental health arrangement, a historical analysis was performed, which covered a forty years period, from the Nineteen Seventies until {{the first decade of the}} twenty-first century. The developments within the Flemish environmental health arrangement are studied against the background of the international and European context in order to determine the strongest triggers and drivers for institutional change and continuity. Data were gathered, analysed and interpreted according to a qualitative approach, and using a triangulation of methods (document analysis, in-depth interviews and participated observation) to get a detailed and balanced picture of this institutionalization process. Although, a historical analysis is in most cases not associated with policy oriented research, and the institutionalization process of the Flemish environmental health arrangement is still on its way, an attempt was made to evaluate the performance of the arrangement. Based on a non-exhaustive list of indicators, concrete recommendations were formulated to optimize the content as well as the organizational structures of the Flemish environmental health arrangement. The following paragraphs present the main conclusions of this thesis. The establishment of the Flemish environmental health arrangement is characterized by a process of gradual, but eventually far-reaching institutional transformation. The impact of the top-down approach, characterized by a more systematic, proactive, forward-thinking, and realistic environmental health policy and planning approach, enforced by the European governmental level, was limited. The identified primary triggers for institutional dynamics were the gradual discursive shifts in response to four local environmental health incidents related to: 1) the metallurgic activities in Hoboken, 2) the cadmium pollution in the Northern Kempen, 3) the dioxin deposition by two waste incinerators in Wilrijk near Antwerp, and 4) the Belgian dioxin crisis in the food chain. More precisely, the series of environmental health incidents gradually shifted the discourses of Flemish politicians, scientists, and the population in general, about environmental health risks and uncertainties. This epistemological shift, in turn, led to new scientific organizational and methodological challenges, on the one hand, and changing discourses about the environmental health policy arrangement and the science-policy-society interface, on the other. Related to the (scientific) knowledge-production, an increased need was determined: 1) to manage uncertainties appropriately, 2) to extend the research team with several scientific disciplines as well as non-scientific forms of expertise, and 3) to shift the research focus from mortality and severe health effects to moderated health effects and negative effects on well-being. To summarize, these discourses altogether require a more integrated approach of the knowledge-production process, at the organizational (interdisciplinary and trans-disciplinary research teams) as well as methodological (integrated risk assessment) level. The observed key discursive governmental changes reflect: 1) the need to differentiate various target groups when establishing environmental quality standards, as one realized that some societal groups are more vulnerable; 2) the need to better coordinate and even integrate the environmental and public health policy (multi-sector governance or policy integration); 3) the need to increase stakeholders’ participation in order to take into account all types of knowledge, perceptions, values, etc. in the decision-making process (multi-actor governance); and 4) the need to develop efficient and effective communication strategies in response to scientific uncertainty. These gradually changing epistemological and governmental discourses caused by the accumulation of incidents within a short time period, shortly followed by elections that enabled the Green Party to profit from public concern and ultimately join the newly formed government from 1999 until 2004, created a window of opportunity to rethink the current affairs about environmental health and to achieve institutional change. Through the years, each discursive shift transformed – to a greater or lesser extent – the Flemish environmental health arrangement into a rather stable arrangement. After all, the changing discourses gave the opportunity to new agencies and organizational structures to enter the arena (e. g., Local Environmental Health Officers, Administrative Services on Environment and Health, the interdisciplinary Flemish Centre of Expertise on Environment and Health), establishing new rules, legislation and decision-frameworks (e. g., Guidelines on Risk Communication, Decision-framework for uncertain risks, Flemish Decree on Preventive Health Policy), and developing tools and methods to ameliorate the science-policy interface (e. g., Flemish Programme on human biomonitoring, Phased Action Plan, environmental health indicators). The institutionalization occurred across the boundaries of science and policy and the increased interaction between science, policy and society is also considered as one of its strengths. Related to the science-policy interface, the Flemish environmental health arrangement evolved from the Enlightenment and Bureaucratic Model, characterized by a <b>strict</b> demarcation between <b>science</b> and politics, towards the Advocacy Model and the Mutual Learning Model in which all stakeholders are involved. The performance analysis has made it clear that the current Flemish environmental health arrangement succeeds in increasing the exchange of information: 1) between the local, the Flemish, the federal and European governmental level; 2) between scientists and policymakers; 3) between environmental civil servants and public health civil servants; 4) between the general people and the experts or policymakers. Moreover, the human biomonitoring surveys, in combination with the work of the local environmental health officers, succeed in detecting potential environmental health problems quickly, thus preventing concerns or problems from evolving into crises. Nevertheless, the analysis also provided insights into some shortcomings and recommendations to ameliorate the content and the organizational structure of the arrangement in the future. The contents’ recommendations regard: 1) the development of a formalized procedure to ensure appropriate uncertainty management, 2) the integration of environmental health objectives structurally and explicitly in all relevant policy domains, 3) the optimization and strengthening of the Phased Action Plan as a boundary object, 4) the optimization of the Flemish decision framework for uncertain risks and making it operational in practice, and 5) further research and a socio-political debate about good environmental health indicators. At the organizational level, points of interest in future research relate to: 1) the strategies facilitating co-production of knowledge and multi-actor governance, and 2) mechanisms that facilitate and ensure the innovative capacity of the Flemish Centre of Expertise on Environment and Health in the long run. nrpages: 288 status: publishe...|$|R
