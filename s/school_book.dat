5|$|After the {{calendar}} stories, Hebel wrote Biblische Geschichten (Bible stories), a new <b>school</b> <b>book</b> for evangelical religious education. His criteria were {{that it should}} be clearly written and tell biblical stories in an exciting narrative style aimed at children from ten to fourteen. It took five years to write and was completed and released in 1824. It was used as a textbook until 1855.|$|E
5|$|Altgens was on {{assignment}} for the AP when he captured two historic images on November 22, 1963. The second photograph, showing First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy {{toward the rear}} of the presidential limousine and Secret Service agent Clint Hill on its bumper, was reproduced on the front pages of newspapers around the world. Within days, Altgens' preceding photograph became controversial after people began to question whether accused assassin Lee Harvey Oswald was visible in the main doorway of the Texas <b>School</b> <b>Book</b> Depository as the gunshots were fired at JFK.|$|E
5|$|After his death, Grayburn's {{was buried}} {{on the bridge}} {{embankment}} close {{to where he was}} killed. It was recovered in 1948 and added to the Arnhem Oosterbeek War Cemetery. Although most graves in the cemetery are organised by unit, Grayburn's is separate from the other parachute formations. His VC is in the care of the Parachute Regiment and Airborne Forces Museum and there are plaques in his memory at Chalfont St Giles parish church, and at the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation war memorial in Hong Kong, where Grayburn's uncle worked before the war. He is also commemorated on the Sherborne School War Memorial and in the Sherborne <b>School</b> <b>Book</b> of Remembrance. A room in the clubhouse of Amersham and Chiltern Rugby Club is named after him.|$|E

5|$|Stone {{wanted to}} {{recreate}} the Kennedy assassination in Dealey Plaza. His producers had to pay the Dallas City Council {{a substantial amount of}} money to hire police to reroute traffic and close streets for three weeks. He only had ten days to shoot all of the footage he needed and so he used seven cameras (two 35mm and five 16mm) and 14 film stocks. Getting permission to shoot in the Texas <b>School</b> <b>Book</b> Depository was more difficult. They had to pay $50,000 to put someone in the window from which Oswald was supposed to have shot Kennedy. They were allowed to film in that location only between certain hours with only five people on the floor at one time: the camera crew, an actor and Stone. Co-producer Clayton Townsend has said that the hardest part was getting the permission to restore the building to the way it looked back in 1963. It took five months of negotiation.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of a discourse and queer theoretical text and image analysis of <b>school</b> <b>books</b> in English used in the Swedish upper secondary school.   The whole content of two <b>school</b> <b>books</b> have been analysed from a norm critical perspective but one chapter in each of them has been analysed more thoroughly than the rest. These two chapters form the {{major part of the}} analysis. The thesis’ problem formulation and objective derive from a personal experience of being a teacher student and part time teacher in Swedish schools. This experience shows the prevalence of a strong heteronormativity both in the schools’ every day life and in the used <b>school</b> <b>books.</b> The thesis therefore wants to examine if the <b>school</b> <b>books</b> cement or challenges this heteronormativity. The question posed to the material is: Which norms surrounding romantic and sexual relationships and romantic and sexual desire is seen in the examined <b>school</b> <b>books?</b> The analysis showed that both books, even if some conflicting text and images came up, cement rather than challenge dominant norms. A clear heteronormativity was seen in both texts and images...|$|R
25|$|On February 14th, Roger Craig, a Dallas deputy sheriff, {{testified that}} during the {{assassination}} {{he was standing on}} the far side of Dealey Plaza across from the Texas <b>School</b> <b>Book</b> Depository. Craig said that immediately afterwards he ran to where the shooting occurred and saw a man that he later identified as Oswald run down the slope away from the building and get into a green station wagon driven by a man with dark complexion. That same day, Carolyn Walther, a Dallas resident, testified that she observed within an open window of the <b>School</b> <b>Book</b> Depository a man in a white shirt holding a gun accompanied by another man wearing a brown suit coat.|$|E

25|$|Dealey Plaza is bounded on the south, east, {{and north}} sides by 100+ foot (30+m) tall {{buildings}}. One of those buildings {{is the former}} Texas <b>School</b> <b>Book</b> Depository building, from which, both the Warren Commission and the House Select Committee on Assassinations concluded, Lee Harvey Oswald fired a rifle that killed President Kennedy. There is also a grassy knoll on the northwest side of the plaza. At the plaza's west perimeter is a triple underpass beneath a railroad bridge, under which the motorcade raced after the shots were fired.|$|E
25|$|In September 1964, the Warren Commission {{released}} its findings {{and concluded that}} Oswald acted alone in assassinating Kennedy by firing three shots from the Texas <b>School</b> <b>Book</b> Depository. This conclusion was supported by previous investigations {{carried out by the}} FBI, the Secret Service, and the Dallas Police Department. Despite forensic, ballistic, and eyewitness evidence supporting the lone gunman theory, public opinion polls taken over the years have shown that most Americans believe that Oswald did not act alone, but conspired with others to kill the president. The assassination has spawned numerous conspiracy theories.|$|E
