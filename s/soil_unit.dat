40|$|ABSTRACT: Soils {{of a large}} {{tropical}} {{area with}} differentiated landscapes cannot be treated uni-formly for ecological applications. We intend to develop a framework based on physiography {{that can be used}} in regional applications. The study region occupies more than 1. 1 million km 2 and is located at the junction of the savanna region of Central Brazil and the Amazon forest. It includes a portion of the high sedimentary Central Brazil plateau and large areas of mostly peneplained crystalline shield on the border of the wide inner-Amazon low sedimentary plain. A first broad subdivision was made into landscape regions followed by a more detailed subdivi-sion into soil regions. Mapping information was extracted from soil survey maps at scales of 1 : 250000 - 1 : 500000. <b>Soil</b> <b>units</b> were integrated within a homogenized legend using a set of selected attributes such as taxonomic term, the texture of the B horizon and the associated vegetation. For each region, a detailed inventory of the <b>soil</b> <b>units</b> with their area distribution was elaborated. Ten landscape regions and twenty-four soil regions were recognized and delineated. Soil cover of a region is normally characterized by a cluster composed of many <b>soil</b> <b>units.</b> <b>Soil</b> diversity is comparable in the landscape and the soil regions. Composition of the soil cover is quantitatively expressed in terms of area extension of the <b>soil</b> <b>units.</b> Such geographic divisions characterized by grouping <b>soil</b> <b>units</b> and their spatial estimates must be used for regional eco-logical applications...|$|R

40|$|Author's final manuscriptIn situ {{measurements}} of <b>soil</b> <b>unit</b> weight and moisture content {{play a critical}} role in conventional compaction quality assurance and quality control procedures. Recently, there have been a number of attempts to develop alternative electrically-based test devices that can be used to measure the in situ unit weight and/or moisture content of a compacted soil; these devices are intended to serve as alternatives to more traditional tests such as sand cone, rubber balloon, drive cylinder, or nuclear density gauge tests. The study described in this paper focuses on the use of a relatively new electrically-based in situ soil test device that uses {{measurements of}} soil complex impedance, soil capacitance, and soil resistance to infer in situ <b>soil</b> <b>unit</b> weight and moisture content; this device is typically referred to as a complex-impedance measuring instrument (CIMI). This paper provides a detailed explanation of current CIMI operating principles and also describes the utilization of a CIMI for field- and laboratory-based testing. The CIMI used in this study was calibrated and assessed in two field compaction projects in which different silty sands were used for construction. A mold-based calibration approach was developed for building an electrically-based soil model using the CIMI; this approach provides an alternative to field calibration of the device. In order to perform a more complete assessment of the CIMI in a controlled environment, a series of CIMI tests were conducted in a large ???field box,??? and the resulting in situ measurements of <b>soil</b> <b>unit</b> weight and moisture content made using the CIMI are compared with the results from nuclear density gauge, sand cone, and drive cylinder tests. The advantages and disadvantages of field versus mold calibration of the CIMI are discussed, and side-by-side assessment of the CIMI relative to other conventionally used compaction control tests allows the reader to assess the accuracy of this device.

40|$|A slope {{stability}} model is derived for an infinite slope subjected to unsaturated infiltration flow above a phreatic surface. Closed form steady state solutions are derived for the matric suction {{and degree of}} saturation profiles. <b>Soil</b> <b>unit</b> weight, consistent with the degree of saturation profile, is also directly calculated and introduced into the analyzes, resulting in closed-form solutions for typical soil parameters and an infinite series solution for arbitrary soil parameters. The solutions are coupled with the infinite {{slope stability}} equations to establish a fully realized safety factor function. In general, consideration of soil suction results in higher factor of safety. The increase in shear strength due to the inclusion of soil suction is analogous to making an addition to the cohesion, which, of course, increases the factor of safety against sliding. However, for cohesive soils, the results show lower safety factors for slip surfaces approaching the phreatic surface compared to those produced by common safety factor calculations. The lower factor of safety {{is due to the}} increased <b>soil</b> <b>unit</b> weight considered in the matric suction model but not usually accounted for in practice wherein the soil is treated as dry above the phreatic surface.

Landsat thematic mapper (TM) data were analyzed to determine how well they enable us to discriminate different <b>soil</b> <b>units</b> in Central Saudi Arabia (A 1 -Qasseem).

This study shows that there is an agreement between soil maps made by traditional soil survey at regional and reconnaissance levels for certain areas and the Landsat TM image. This agreement may be due to a number of factors which include: 1) Scale similarity. 2) The studied soil profile is homogeneous throughout or derived from unique parent material. 3) The base map in traditional soil survey is derived from photo interpretation which considers the landforms as a base in discriminating various mapping units.

40|$|Abstract. Regardless {{of farming}} systems practiced, fertility, {{inherent}} agricultural land, {{is the core}} of these systems. The quality of soils, seen as a measure of their fertility, presents regional differences. The main objectives of this study are, on the one hand, spatial representation of soil quality and analysis of eroded soil quality and on the other hand, show the influence of culture on the development of quantitative of surface erosion. Cartographic materials used were obtained using ArcGIS software and based on topographic maps, vector map of soil and erosion vector map. Determining the average amount lost by erosion at the surface is based on the relation derived from the Universal Soil Erosion Equation, which sets the contribution of each factor. For each <b>soil</b> <b>unit</b> affected by erosion processes was calculated average annual soil loss in two types of crops (wheat and maize) at different values of the slope and slope length. For each <b>soil</b> <b>unit,</b> using ArcGIS software, the average slope was calculated, value being subsequently introduced into the relation computing. Soils in the territory Traian Vuia falls a large percentage in classes III and IV quality. The quality of eroded soils, at the category of use "arable", corresponds also mostly the classes III and IV quality. Under the wheat crop, the average annual amount lost through erosion at the surface is significantly lower than under the maize. Agricultural land planted with corn lose an average annual soil 4. 67 times higher than in those cultivated by wheat...|$|E

40|$|Current soil maps contain {{qualitative}} attributes {{which are}} challenging to integrate into agronomic models or decision support systems. In this paper, {{a new approach}} is proposed that will enable the use of soil maps as a suitable information system of soils hydrostructural properties for agronomic and environmental models. This enhancement is possible through a new methodology for characterizing the <b>soil</b> <b>units</b> {{on the basis of}} the multi-scale soil-water functionality of the pedon which is a representative <b>soil</b> mapping <b>unit</b> delineated by pedologists according to the geomorphology. The hydro-functional mapping <b>units</b> should represent <b>soil</b> mapping <b>units</b> that are theoretically homogenous from the perspective of the pedostructure parameters of the pedon. For the purpose of this study, the Haggerty-Cox property, West Lafayette, Indiana, USA was selected. The soil data "soil mapping units and physical characteristics" of the study area were obtained from SSURGO. Due to time and cost constraints, the research was restricted to three SSURGO <b>soil</b> <b>units</b> (SwA, Starks-Fincastle complex with 0 - 2 % slope: MsC 2, Miami silt loam, 6 - 12 % slopes: and HoA, Hononegah fine sandy loam with 0 - 2 % slopes) to check their spatial homogeneity according to the pedostructure parameters (PS). The discriminant statistical analysis for the area of study shows that the PS parameters are unique for each <b>soil</b> mapping <b>unit</b> and can be effectively used to characterize these units and validate their delineation. The resulting hydro-functional <b>soil</b> mapping <b>units</b> match SSURGO units but have additional physical attributes. In general, subsurface horizons (B) are more distinguishable than surface horizons (Ap), and using pedostructure parameters from both potential and shrinkage curves gives the highest distinguishing value. Results confirm that the pedostructure parameters are discriminant characteristics of the hydrostructural functioning of soils as delineated by pedologists.
