(eds) Tectonics of Western Himalaya & KarakoramInternational audienceDuctile strain {{localisation}} commonly forms {{a pattern}} of <b>shear</b> <b>zones</b> anastomosing around lenses of less deformed rock. Initiation and development history of anastomosing <b>shear</b> <b>zones,</b> which are little documented, are studied through {{the description of the}} structures and the deformation history of plutonic rocks that form the lower crust of the Kohistan Complex. Structures and textures developed in these rocks result from primary magmatic to solid state regional strain overprinted by anastomosing <b>shear</b> <b>zones.</b> The primary strain was mainly acquired during magmatic emplacement at 100 - 90 Ma. Strain localisation took place continuously from magmatic emplacement to solid state deformation during cooling of the plutons and formed 3 successive sets of <b>shear</b> <b>zones.</b> Set 1 is composed of associated discrete Riedel and thrust <b>shear</b> <b>zones</b> developed above solidus conditions during SW-ward thrusting. Continuous deformation from solidus to amphibolite facies conditions between 100 and 83 Ma formed the second set of <b>shear</b> <b>zones.</b> The lower amphibolite facies set 3 <b>shear</b> <b>zones</b> are differentiated by larger strain recorded in the thicker mylonitic zones and enlargement of the spacing between <b>shear</b> <b>zones</b> during cooling. The anastomosing pattern of <b>shear</b> <b>zones</b> described here probably represents arc-related deformation during subduction of the Tethys oceanic lithosphere below the Kohistan Arc Complex...|$|R

40|$|The mylonitised {{granitic}} rocks were {{object of}} the study in the Zobor part of the Tribeč Mts. They were metamorphosed under greenschist facies conditions during simple shear deformation. The <b>shear</b> (mylonite) <b>zones</b> are oriented in the NE–SW direction in the investigated area. Prevailing of the <b>shear</b> <b>zones</b> has sinistral sense of displacement. The origin of the sinistral <b>shear</b> <b>zones</b> is connected with compression oriented in the N–S direction during the Latest Cretaceous to Palaeocene. The dextral <b>shear</b> <b>zones</b> together with folds observed in the Lower Triassic sediments of the Lúžna Fm. were generated under the WNW–ESE oriented compression. The origin of the dextral <b>shear</b> <b>zones</b> is interpreted {{as a consequence of}} thrusting of the Central Carpathians tectonic units (Veporic and Fatric units) during the Late Cretaceous (Cenomanian). The sinistral <b>shear</b> <b>zones</b> were most probably superposed on dextral <b>shear</b> <b>zones</b> because of reorientation of the stress field to the N–S direction during the Latest Cretaceous–Earliest Palaeogene...|$|R

Detailed field studies and fabric analysis show a close relationship between the impoverishment in calcium of the Arinteiro massif amphibolites and the ductile <b>shear</b> <b>zones.</b> A model to explain the evolution of Ca-poor amphibolites is proposed in which fluids are channelized by the <b>shear</b> <b>zones,</b> extracting calcium from the normal amphibolites. Moreover, calc-silicate rocks occur far from deformation zones and are considered to be metasomatic products of the interaction between Ca-rich fluids/common amphibolite...|$|R

25|$|While sulfide {{minerals}} do {{not change}} their mineralogy during metamorphism as silicates do, the yield strength of the nickel sulfide pentlandite, and copper sulfide chalcopyrite is {{less than that of}} pyrrhotite and pyrite, resulting in a potential to segregate the sulfides mechanically throughout a <b>shear</b> <b>zone.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{surface finish}} is {{sometimes}} {{used to measure}} the machinability of a material. Soft, ductile materials tend to form a built up edge. Stainless steel and other materials with a high strain hardening ability also want to form a built up edge. Aluminium alloys, cold worked steels, and free machining steels, as well as materials with a high <b>shear</b> <b>zone</b> don't tend to form built up edges, so these materials would rank as more machinable.|$|E
25|$|Noise {{barriers}} {{force the}} pollution plumes {{coming from the}} road to move {{up and over the}} barrier creating the effect of an elevated source and enhancing vertical dispersion of the plume. The deceleration and the deflection of the initial flow by the noise barrier force the plume to disperse horizontally. A highly turbulent <b>shear</b> <b>zone</b> characterized by slow velocities and a re-circulation cavity is created in the lee of the barrier which further enhances the dispersion; this mixes ambient air with the pollutants downwind behind the barrier.|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} the {{mineralogy}} of some Laxfordian <b>shear</b> <b>zones</b> at Scourie shows that they formed at about 600 °C, 6 kb, and were zones of intense metasomatism.

The nanostructure in secondary <b>shear</b> <b>zones</b> was less homogeneous than that in primary <b>shear</b> <b>zones.</b> In addition, a heavily deformed layer was formed in a subsurface of Ti- 15 V- 3 Cr- 3 Al- 3 Sn work-pieces, replicating the microstructure of secondary <b>shear</b> <b>zones</b> of the machining chips, and elongated nanocrystalline grains in this layer were aligned with a tangential direction of turning...|$|R
40|$|Ductile <b>shear</b> <b>zones</b> {{can occur}} as {{relatively}} isolated single structures, as arrays, or as characteristic paired zones. In continuous glaciated exposures of metagranodiorites from the Tauern window (Eastern Alps), {{the control of}} initial dilatant brittle fracture and associated fluid–rock interaction on the geometry of subsequent ductile <b>shear</b> <b>zones</b> can be unequivocally established. Shearing occurred under amphibolite facies conditions. Fractures in weakly deformed metagranodiorites are often less than 1 mm thick but extend for tens of metres. Many are healed joints without shear offset. Others show minor (mm–cm), discrete dextral offset. Such brittle faults commonly display a low-angle en-échelon arrangement, with displacement transferred between discrete fracture segments by ductile compressive bridges. The geometry of more strongly reactivated zones depends on the degree and heterogeneity of fluid–rock interaction, which is related to fluid infiltration and veining along the primary fractures. With little fluid–rock interaction, reactivation produces single heterogeneous ductile <b>shear</b> <b>zones</b> centred on and immediately flanking the pre-existing fracture. With increased fluid–rock interaction, a bleached halo is developed symmetrically {{to either side of}} a central epidote–quartz (±garnet±calcite) vein. Ductile <b>shear</b> <b>zones</b> commonly flank this bleached zone, to develop a characteristic paired pattern. Strain is partitioned, localizing in the central fracture/vein and the flanking <b>shear</b> <b>zones.</b> Paired zones may anastomose in accordance with changes in the width of the central bleached zone, but are always symmetrically spaced with regard to the central fracture/vein. With increasing deformation, the ductile <b>shear</b> <b>zones</b> broaden into the adjacent metagranodiorite but not into the bleached zone, which remains preserved as a low strain region. Paired <b>shear</b> <b>zones</b> can also develop to either side of aplite dykes. Examples of characteristic paired <b>shear</b> <b>zones,</b> usually with a clear central vein, are found in many areas ranging from greenschist to eclogite facies, suggesting that the mechanism of their formation is quite general...|$|R
25|$|During the {{formation}} of the GLTZ, the MRV protocontinent consumed the Superior province's oceanic crust as the subprovince came in from the south. Suturing of one continental block onto another usually occurs because a subduction zone exists beneath one of the blocks. The subduction zone consumes the oceanic crust connected to the other block. After the oceanic crust is consumed, the two blocks meet and the subducting oceanic crust pulls the attached continental block under the other. During the collision with the Superior province, the MRV gneissic block was thrust up onto the Superior province's edge; this resulted in a thrusted crumpled fault tens of kilometers wide producing a mountain range, and a <b>shear</b> <b>zone</b> which defines the boundary between the two terranes. Tectonism along the zone began during the docking of the two terranes into a single continental mass, and culminated in the early Proterozoic, where deformation took place under low to intermediate pressures.|$|E

2500|$|Extending from Net Lake to Vermilion Lake lies a northeast-southwest {{trending}} high strain zone {{known as}} the Net Lake-Vermilion Lake Deformation Zone. Because geologic mapping has not been done comprehensively throughout this zone, its exact width is unknown. The expression of this deformation zone is clearly identifiable by the intense change in volcanic rocks of the TGB. Volcanic units comprising the northwestern portion of the <b>shear</b> <b>zone</b> have shifted to the northeast while the volcanic rocks comprising its southeastern portion have shifted to the southwest. Along the northeastern arm of Lake Temagami in Strathcona Township lies the Northeast Arm Deformation Zone. This northeast-trending <b>shear</b> <b>zone</b> has not been studied in detail, but casual studies of many islands along the northeastern arm of Lake Temagami have shown that there is severe foliation and minor ferroan carbonate across an area about [...] wide. The Link Lake Deformation Zone, also {{known as the}} Link Lake <b>Shear</b> <b>Zone,</b> is an area of deformation [...] wide and over [...] long in Strathy Township. It extends through Link Lake to east of Highway 11, but it is uncertain whether it extends west of Link Lake because no expression of it has been found in the Sherman Mine area. Therefore, the Link Lake <b>Shear</b> <b>Zone</b> might be a northern extension of the Northeast Arm Deformation Zone further south. Strain intensity of the Link Lake <b>Shear</b> <b>Zone</b> is diverse. Generally, the greatest strain intensity is throughout pyroclastic rocks. Extending from the western boundary of central Chambers Township through Tasse Lake to the east is the Tasse Lake Deformation Zone. This deformation zone is roughly [...] long and at least [...] wide. It is uncertain if this deformation zone extends east of Tasse Lake.|$|E

2500|$|Many north-trending shear zones {{intersect}} iron-rich tholeiitic basalts of the Arsenic Lake Formation. These zones {{range in}} width {{from less than}} [...] up to , and might maintain a larger area of weakness that was tectonically active over the past billion years. Evidence for early tectonism, likely related to volcanic activity, include the greater density of felsic dikes concentrated immediately around these zones. An example is the north-south trending Big Dan <b>Shear</b> <b>Zone</b> situated near the former garbage dump of Temagami. The felsic dikes near this zone are interpreted to represent a subvolcanic feeder system to the overlying felsic volcanic rocks. It is probable that the dikes maintained a former zone of weakness now demonstrated by the shear zones. Renewed tectonic activity along the Big Dan <b>Shear</b> <b>Zone</b> is manifested by offset of clastic sediments east of the Ontario Northland Railway. This phase of tectonic activity displaced felsic dikes north of the exposed part of this <b>shear</b> <b>zone.</b> However, considerable displacement of the dikes at this location is unknown. The most recent phase of tectonic activity along the Big Dan <b>Shear</b> <b>Zone</b> resulted in the displacement of a Proterozoic dike composed of diabase, which intersects the zone. A similar abundance of felsic dikes are adjacent to Arsenic Lake just west of Highway 11, indicating similar repetitive tectonism also occurred along that structural zone. Therefore, the north-trending shear zones may have been active {{for at least a}} billion years.|$|E

40|$|In the Mont Blanc Helvetic massif, granites record {{mesoscale}} Alpine structures, {{which include}} joints, veins, cataclastic to mylonitic <b>shear</b> <b>zones</b> and foliated granites. A detailed structural analysis indicates that brittle deformation predates plastic strain. Joints never pass through, and veins are offset by, cataclastic <b>shear</b> <b>zones</b> and mylonites. The mylonites progressively develop by plastic reactivation of cataclastic <b>shear</b> <b>zones</b> during greenschist facies metamorphic conditions. Plastic deformation is first localized in the brittle discontinuities and the fine-grained matrix of cataclasites. Then {{it involves the}} granite within brittle <b>shear</b> <b>zones,</b> and this is initially accomplished mainly by flow of reaction-softened aggregates of sericite, widely replacing the strain-supporting magmatic plagioclase. The brittle-to-plastic evolution has resulted in highly localized discontinuous plastic <b>shear</b> <b>zones</b> with high lateral continuity, and these characteristics are derived from reactivation of, and focusing along, pre-existing brittle discontinuities. In addition, mylonites may inherit high angles of intersection, and may contain granite porphyroclasts. These features may allow the inference of a precursor brittle deformation where the plastic overprint has completely erased the initial brittle fabrics...|$|R

Some theorize that this is a section of the Mojave–Sonora Megashear, but this theory is not universally accepted; however, the Megashear is important, and, in fact, is necessary for reconstructions of the opening of the Gulf of California, as of 2003.|$|E

40|$|The Main Fault in the shaly facies of Opalinus Clay {{is a small}} {{reverse fault}} formed in {{slightly}} overconsolidated claystone at around 1  km depth. The fault zone is up to 6  m wide, with micron-thick <b>shear</b> <b>zones,</b> calcite and celestite veins, scaly clay and clay gouge. Scaly clay occurs in up to 1. 5  m wide lenses, providing hand specimens for this study. We mapped the scaly clay fabric at 1  m– 10  nm scale, examining scaly clay {{for the first time}} using broad-ion beam polishing combined with scanning electron microscopy (BIB-SEM). Results show a network of thin <b>shear</b> <b>zones</b> and microveins, separating angular to lensoid microlithons between 10  cm and 10  µm in diameter, with slickensided surfaces. Our results show that microlithons are only weakly deformed and that strain is accumulated by fragmentation of microlithons by newly formed <b>shear</b> <b>zones,</b> by <b>shearing</b> in the micron-thick zones and by rearrangement of the microlithons. The scaly clay aggregates can be easily disintegrated into individual microlithons because of the very low tensile strength of the thin <b>shear</b> <b>zones.</b> Analyses of the microlithon size by sieving indicate a power-law distribution model with exponents just above 2. From this, we estimate that only 1  vol % of the scaly clay aggregate is in the <b>shear</b> <b>zones.</b> After a literature review of the hypotheses for scaly clay generation, we present a new model to explain the progressive formation of a self-similar network of anastomosing thin <b>shear</b> <b>zones</b> in a fault relay. The relay provides the necessary boundary conditions for macroscopically continuous deformation. Localization of strain in thin <b>shear</b> <b>zones</b> which are locally dilatant, and precipitation of calcite veins in dilatant shear fractures, evolve into complex microscale re-partitioning of shear, forming new <b>shear</b> <b>zones</b> while the microlithons remain much less deformed internally and the volume proportion of the µm-thick <b>shear</b> <b>zones</b> slowly increases. Grain-scale deformation mechanisms are microfracturing, boudinage and rotation of mica grains, pressure solution of carbonate fossils and pore collapse during ductile flow of the clay matrix.
