Both drew on elements of castle architecture such as castellation and towers, but served no military purpose and were solely for display.|$|E
5|$|The Vaishnava writers {{consisted}} of two groups who <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> interaction with each other: the Brahmin commentators who typically wrote under the patronage of royalty; and the Bhakti (devotion) poets who played no role in courtly matters, instead taking the message of God {{to the people in}} the form of melodious songs composed using folk genres.

25|$|The {{pandemic}} outbreak of influenza {{in the spring}} of 1918, along with a major economic slowdown in the postwar period, hit Spain particularly hard, and the country went into debt. From that moment the social conflict was to come to a head. The post-World War I economic difficulties heightened social unrest among urban industrial workers and rural peasants, with a period of strikes and agitation in both the city and the countryside. The Cortes (Spanish parliament) under the constitutional monarchy <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> solution to Spain's unemployment, labor strikes, and poverty. The socialists and anarchists pressed for radical changes, but the government proved unable to reform itself or the nation and frustration mounted.|$|E
25|$|After the Great Fire of Rome in 64 AD, Emperor Nero {{accused the}} Christians as {{convenient}} scapegoats, who were later persecuted and killed. From that point on, Roman official policy towards Christianity tended towards persecution. During the various Imperial crises of the 3rd century, “contemporaries were predisposed to decode any crisis in religious terms”, {{regardless of their}} allegiance to particular practices or belief systems. Christianity drew its traditional base {{of support from the}} powerless, who <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> religious stake in the well-being of the Roman State, and therefore threatened its existence. The majority of Rome’s elite continued to observe various forms of inclusive Hellenistic monism; Neoplatonism in particular accommodated the miraculous and the ascetic within a traditional Graeco-Roman cultic framework. Christians saw these practices as ungodly, and a primary cause of economic and political crisis.|$|E
25|$|Li Na {{followed}} her strong showing at the Medibank tournament with an equally strong showing at the 2007 Australian Open, where she {{advanced to the}} fourth round. Seeded 19th, Li dispatched Elena Bovina and Lourdes Domínguez Lino in straight sets through the first two rounds, leading to a matchup with no. 9 Dinara Safina. The match was postponed due to rain, but Li handily beat Safina {{to advance to the}} fourth round to play Swiss star, no. 6 Martina Hingis. Due to a rain delay and the fact that Hingis played on Rod Laver Arena, a roofed court, on the originally scheduled day, Hingis had an extra day of rest. The match the previous day <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> effect, as Li took the first set from Hingis. However, Na faded as the match went on and lost while committing 69 unforced errors. Despite the loss, the tournament was a success for Na, as it marked the third straight time in a Grand Slam that she advanced at least to the fourth round.|$|E

25|$|Today I have {{experienced}} my hardest combat. But {{at the same}} time it has been my most wonderful experience of comradeship in the air. We were eight Messerschmitts in the midst of an incredible whirling mass of enemy fighters. I flew my 109 for my life. I worked with every gram of energy and by the time we finished I was foaming at the mouth and utterly exhausted. Again and again we had enemy aircraft fighters on our tails. I was forced to dive three or four times, but I pulled up again and rushed back into the turmoil. Once I <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> escape; I had flown my 109 to its limits, but a Spitfire still sat behind me. At the last moment Marseille shot it down, 50 metres from my 109. I dived and pulled up. Seconds later I saw a Spitfire behind Marseille. I took aim at the enemy— I have never aimed so carefully— and he dived down burning. At the end of the combat only Marseille and I were left in the dogfight. Each of us had three kills. At home we climbed out of out planes and were thoroughly exhausted. Marseille had bullet holes in his 109 and I had 11 hits in mine. We embraced each other, but were unable to speak. It was an unforgettable event.|$|E

In New York City he became {{involved}} with O'Horgan's theater company as a [...] "general aide", signing on as associate producer for Lenny and for Eve Merriam's Inner City. The time he had spent with the cast of flower children wore away much of Milk's conservatism. A contemporary New York Times story about O'Horgan described Milk as [...] "a sad eyed man—another aging hippie with long, long hair, wearing faded jeans and pretty beads".

500|$|The {{circumstances}} of Mackintosh's death have led commentators to emphasise his impetuousness and incompetence. This generally negative view {{of him was}} not, however, unanimous among his comrades. Stevens, [...] the [...] party's [...] scientist, found Mackintosh [...] "steadfast and reliable", and believed that the Ross Sea party would have achieved much less [...] but for Mackintosh's unwearying drive. John King Davis, too, admired Mackintosh's dedication and called the depot-laying journey a [...] "magnificent achievement". Shackleton was equivocal. In South he acknowledges that Mackintosh and his men achieved their object, praises the party's qualities of endurance and self-sacrifice, and asserts that Mackintosh died for his country. On the other hand, in a letter home, he is highly critical: [...] "Mackintosh <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> idea of discipline or organisation...". Shackleton did, however, donate part of the proceeds from a short New Zealand lecture tour to assist the Mackintosh family. His son, Lord Shackleton, in a much later assessment of the expedition, wrote: [...] "Three men in particular emerge as heroes: Captain Aeneas Mackintosh, ... Dick Richards, and Ernest Joyce." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Spice Up Your Life" [...] was {{directed}} on 6 September 1997, by Marcus Nispel in a two-day shoot located in New York City. The video features {{the group in}} a futuristic setting, inspired by the 1982 film Blade Runner, and the music video for Janet Jackson's 1989 single Rhythm Nation controlling every aspect of society in a dark futuristic post apocalyptic cityscape. Nispel {{came up with the}} concept based on a sketch that was faxed to him signed [...] "Ginger Spice". He recalls: [...] "I looked at what Disney did to Times Square in NYC and tried to imagine how the Spice Girls would transform it, as their career <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> limits—at the time." [...] The group was not consulted about the concept. According to Brown's autobiography, they wanted a carnival party theme, but were too tired to fight about it with the label, and ended up with a concept linked to the theme of world domination. Brown commented: [...] "It wasn't right. I don't think any of us liked it much, even though we enjoyed making it. I still can't understand what's going on in it half the time." [...] The video exclusively premiered on MTV in September 1997.|$|E
500|$|Though the Vaishnava courtly {{writings}} in Kannada {{began with}} the Hoysala poet Rudrabhatta and the devotional song genre was initiated by Naraharitirtha, the Vaishnava movement began to exert a strong influence on Kannada literature only from the 15th century on. The Vaishnava writers consisted of two groups who <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> interaction with each other: the Brahmin commentators who typically wrote under the patronage of royalty, and the Bhakti (devotion) writers (also known as haridasas) who played no role in courtly matters. [...] The Bhakti writers took the message of God {{to the people in}} the form of melodious songs composed using folk genres such as the kirthane (a musical composition with refrain, based on tune and rhythm), the suladi (a composition based on rhythm) and the ugabhoga (a composition based on melody). Kumara Vyasa and Timmanna Kavi were well-known among the Brahmin commentators, while Purandara Dasa and Kanaka Dasa were the most notable of the Bhakti writers. The philosophy of Madhvacharya, which originated in the Kannada-speaking region in the 13th century, spread beyond its borders over the next two centuries.

500|$|Few female {{respondents}} reported engaging in sex {{play with their}} siblings, and it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> {{role in the development}} of sexual preference. Homosexual women were less likely to report having enjoyed typical girls' activities, but more likely to report having enjoyed typical boys' activities, such as football, and to describe themselves as having been very masculine while they were growing up. These and other variables were combined into a [...] "Childhood Gender Nonconformity" [...] measure, which proved to be the second strongest predictor of homosexuality. Bell et al. noted, however, that childhood gender nonconformity did not seem to have been important in the way proposed by psychoanalytic theory, in that it was not a crucial link between family influences and their respondents' sense of womanhood, and nor was it explained by relationships within the family. Homosexual women were more likely to recall having felt different from other girls their age during grade school and high school years, and to say that they felt different because they were more masculine than other girls, more interested in sports, or not interested in boys. Homosexual women were also more likely to have felt sexually different. However, these feelings did not appear to play a {{role in the development of}} female homosexuality. Homosexual women, unlike heterosexual women, were sometimes labeled sexually different or homosexual before the age of 19, but such labeling also appeared to play no significant role in the development of female homosexuality.|$|E
500|$|The {{characters}} {{introduced in}} XIII-2 received a mixed reception, with some praising their inclusion and others {{saying they were}} too weak. Ryan Clements felt that the characters <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> clear focus, with the only driving force being the quest for Lightning. VanOrd thought the characters were good, but said that the game focused too much on Serah and Noel, rather than the more engaging characters of Lightning and Caius. Dale North of Destructoid was the most positive, finding the characters very well fleshed out, understandable and well-voiced by the cast. den Ouden thought that the characters alright and well voiced, but [...] " [...] flat when the actors [...] awkward dialogue to work with". Juba was extremely critical of the characters and their story, seeing the company taking the [...] "weakest" [...] characters and placing them center stage, while the [...] "best" [...] characters, such as Lighting and Fang, were relegated to the background. Parish was disappointed in the character's development, saying that Serah was never given any true power within the game's narrative, and that Noel was under-developed beyond his original premise, with the [...] "stronger" [...] characters from the original game being a noticeable loss. On top of this, he disliked how the two [...] "least liked" [...] characters from XIII (Serah and Hope) were given such large roles. Parkin was especially critical, saying the characters were [...] "irritating or forgettable, full of fuzzy or weak motivations and stuffed with tortuous, posturing dialogue". Despite this, he said that Serah's warmth endowed {{the game with a}} comforting atmosphere.|$|E
500|$|An {{early morning}} {{kick-off}} away to fierce rivals Liverpool {{ended in a}} routine victory for United. Losing to Juventus in the last match of the Champions League before hiatus had <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> effect on United's domestic dominance. They comprehensively defeated Aston Villa thanks to a solitary Giggs goal and followed {{it up with a}} heroic Schmeichel performance to deny Newcastle United at St James' Park. British Prime Minister Tony Blair, a lifelong fan of the Geordies, was among the crowd and was in awe over Ferguson's team, believing that the manager had assembled [...] "one of the greatest sides of the century". Two out of two became three as Everton found no answer to deny the league leaders, who extended their lead {{at the top of the}} table to six points on Boxing Day. The win marked the end of Karel Poborský's spell, coming on for David Beckham in the second half ahead of a switch to Graeme Souness' Benfica. However, what was to come at the end of December exemplified the vulnerability of the defence during the second half of the season. In losing to mid-table Coventry City two days after the Everton win, United blew the chance to open up a nine-point lead at the top of the table, which would virtually slam the door shut on the challengers. They again found themselves a goal down, this time courtesy of Noel Whelan, Solskjær and Sheringham responded to restore the advantage back on the champions but a Dion Dublin penalty and mazy run from youngster Darren Huckerby in the last minute ensured an implausible victory, given the fact that Coventry were 2–1 down with five minutes to go. Prior to the game, Ferguson highlighted the fact that the league [...] "wasn't won in December", but following the defeat blasted his side's display as [...] "silly" [...] and [...] "on the verge of complacency".|$|E
