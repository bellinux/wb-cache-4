6000|$|Here is a {{singular}} piece of magic in which Europeans and Australian blacks agree. Boris Godunoff made his servants swear never to injure him by casting spells with the dust on which his feet or his carriage wheels had left traces.(1) Mr. Howitt finds the same magic among the Kurnai.(2) [...] "Seeing a Tatungolung very lame, I {{asked him what}} was the matter. He said, 'Some fellow has put BOTTLE in my foot'. I found he was probably suffering from acute rheumatism. He explained that some enemy must have found his foot-track and have buried in it a piece of broken bottle. The magic influence, he believed, caused it to enter his foot." [...] On another occasion a native told Mr. Howitt {{that he had seen}} black fellows putting poison in his foot-tracks. Bosman mentions a similar practice among the people of Guinea. In Scottish folk-lore a <b>screw</b> <b>nail</b> is fixed into the footprint of the person who is to be injured.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is based}} on the study of a new soil nail called <b>screw</b> <b>nail.</b> The research is focused on the design, fabrication and analysis of a new <b>screw</b> <b>nail</b> and its interaction mechanisms between the soil and nail in two cohesive and non-cohesive soil materials that are compacted in a suitably fabricated large box. The interaction behaviour of the nail was investigated by a series of fully instrumented pullout tests that were carried under different surcharge load conditions and the observed behaviours were compared with the results of pullout tests by various other investigators. Numerical modelling was also carried out in an attempt to investigate and understand the performance and the shear mechanism of the <b>screw</b> <b>nail</b> under different boundary conditions. For this purpose, a full three-dimensional finite element computer program was used to study the soil and nail displacements associated with the axial loading. Comprehensive laboratory soil tests were carried out prior and after the pullout tests to fully characterise the soils conditions. The box was instrumented with load cells and LVDTs and strain gauges were adhered to the <b>screw</b> <b>nail.</b> For the non-cohesive soil, thin vertical sand bands were cast to analyse the soil deformation patterns after the completion of the pullout tests. The pullout tests of the <b>screw</b> <b>nail</b> show that its performance is better when compared to the results of other investigators due to the efficient geometry of the <b>screw</b> <b>nail</b> and its interaction with the surrounding soil...|$|E
40|$|The {{ultimate}} {{shear strength}} at {{the interface between}} the soil nail and surrounding soil is of practical importance {{in the design and}} performance of a soil nail system. The most commonly adopted method of measuring this interface shear strength is by a soil nail pullout testing. This study introduces a novel soil nail system {{in the form of a}} <b>screw</b> <b>nail</b> and compares its performance with a conventional grouted soil nail. Both types of soil nails are tested in a controlled laboratory setting using residual soil in a large purpose made pullout box. The development of the new <b>screw</b> <b>nail</b> and the laboratory testing procedures are briefly mentioned first followed by presentation and discussion of the results on the interface shear behaviour measured from pullout tests. It is shown that the <b>screw</b> <b>nail</b> offer many advantages in terms of pullout load-displacement behaviour and the interface shear mechanism than that the grouted soil nai...|$|E

40|$|Experimental {{results of}} a series of {{laboratory}} pullout tests on a new screw soil nail are presented. A review of the literature for the screw soil nails as well as a comparison of its performance with other conventional types of soil nails is discussed. The present investigation also examines the fundamental interface mechanism and attempts to define the associated rupture zones in cohesionless material with the aid of thin vertical bands of coloured sand cast in a large distinctly fabricated pullout box. The philosophy behind the design and development of the new <b>screw</b> <b>nail</b> is briefly described first followed by presentation of the laboratory testing procedure and its instrumentation. The results of the testings indicate that the slip mechanism, which controls the pullout behaviour, is rather different to the conventional soil nails and the resultant pullout capacity is higher when compared to this type soil nails. This effect is attributed to the geometry of the <b>screw</b> <b>nail</b> and the installation processes that result in the development of different soil stresses around the soil nail. In addition, the experimental pullout results demonstrate, contrary to the conventional soil nail, that the <b>screw</b> <b>nail</b> pullout capacity is dependent on the overburden pressure and that the failure planes extends out a certain radial distance from the soil-nail interface. From the test results, it is shown that the failure of the <b>screw</b> <b>nail</b> satisfies the Mohr-Coulomb failure condition, which is similar behaviour seen in the conventional soil nail tests...|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} is to {{describe}} and evaluate new technique for treatment of unilateral vocal cord paralysis giving the same results of the standard procedure but minimizing the surgical trauma. Patients and methodsA prospective study was carried out between November 2009 and November 2011 in the Otorhinolaryngology Department, Zagazig University Hospitals, Egypt. It included 12 patients with unilateral idiopathic vocal cord paralysis who were managed by this new technique. Preoperative and postoperative video-laryngoscopy was done, maximal phonation time was calculated and ratings grade of dysphonia was compared. ResultsPostoperative video-laryngoscopy relieved complete glottic gap closure in 83. 3 % of cases and partial glottic gap in the remaining 16. 7 % of cases. The mean preoperative maximal phonation time was 9. 42 s and the postoperative value was 21. 5 s with a mean difference of 11. 6 s. The rating of the grade of dysphonia showed great improvement in the patient’s voice quality from severe dysphonia preoperatively to normal or near-normal voice postoperatively. All patients were satisfied with the results of the procedure except one patient (8. 3 %). ConclusionThe <b>screw</b> <b>nail</b> medialization technique gives a good reliable and easy procedure under local anesthesia for managing unilateral vocal cord paralysis and avoids the disadvantages of infection laryngoplasty and medialization thyroplasty using implants...|$|E

30|$|As {{commercial}} products, {{the exact}} materials’ composition and fabrication {{process of the}} aforementioned absorbable magnesium implants are not publicly available in scientific publications. However, one may {{have a look at}} patent databases such as that of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). The following examples are three US patents assigned to the three companies who already commercialized the absorbable metals technology. First, the US Patent #US 9700652 B 2 was assigned to Biotronik claiming an absorbable medical implant made of fiber-reinforced magnesium or fiber-reinforced magnesium alloys (Loeffler et al. 2017). It is comprised of a matrix of crystalline magnesium or magnesium alloy reinforced by amorphous or nanocrystalline fibers made of Mg-(10 – 40  wt%) Zn-(0 – 20  wt%)X, wherein X is selected from the group of lanthanum, yttrium, silicon, aluminum, and calcium. This composite-like structure allows an increased strength and tunable corrosion behavior which are desirable for coronary stent applications. Second, Syntellix assigned the US Patent # US 9402669 B 2 which claims a method for producing a medical implant, such as bone <b>screw,</b> <b>nail,</b> pin, plate, and suture anchor, from a magnesium alloy which contains 2.5 – 5  wt% RE, 1.5 – 5  wt% yttrium, 0.1 – 2.5  wt% zirconium, and 0.01 – 0.8  wt% zinc (Neubert and Schavan 2016). The method consists of melting the alloy at 700 – 900  °C, atomizing the molten alloy into alloy powder under a protective-gas atmosphere, shaping the powder into a green body, extruding it at 300 – 400  °C to obtain a molded part, and finally producing the medical implant from it. Third, the US Patent US 20170119922 A 1 was assigned to U&I claiming a magnesium alloy for forming a medical implant, comprising 0 – 23 wt % calcium and 0 – 10 wt % zinc (Koo et al. 2017). The alloy possesses controlled corrosion resistance properties due to the electrical potential difference between magnesium phase and Mg 2 Ca phase which is not greater than 200  mV as measured in a biomimetic solution specified in the patent. As can be seen, the inventions claimed in those patents based on the material composition that leads to a controlled corrosion resistance, the composite structure that leads to an improved strength, and the processing method that results into a molded semi-finished material.|$|E

30|$|Several {{references}} provide overviews of fire testing {{data and}} performance of steel connections in timber (Austruy, Fragiacomo, Moss, & Buchanan, 2007) (Lau, 2006) (Gerard, 2010). Embedded connections such as <b>screws,</b> <b>nails</b> and bolts tend to demonstrate better fire performance than fasteners and plate connections.

Utilization of <b>screws</b> and <b>nails</b> in longitudinal connections should be avoided. Although the nail WR at 28  % MC was higher than at 12  % MC, nails should be used at 12  % MC to avoid problems after drying, such as splitting, and shrinking.

50|$|There {{are many}} forms of wall plug, but the most common {{principle}} {{is to use a}} tapered tube of soft material, such as plastic.

40|$|Background: The {{failure of}} the {{conventional}} nailing of both forearm bones or isolated fractures of radius and ulna pose a potential problem of nail migration and rotational instability, despite the best reduction. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to evaluate the results of <b>screw</b> elastic intramedullary <b>nail</b> for the treatment of adult diaphyseal fractures of both forearm bones, which effectively addresses the problems associated with the conventional nailing systems for the forearm fractures. Materials and Methods: Seventy-six adults with forearm fractures (radius and ulna or isolated fracture of the single bone) were retrospectively evaluated. Fifty males and 26 females with the mean age of 38 years (range, 18 - 70 years) underwent closed reduction and <b>screw</b> intramedullary <b>nail</b> fixation. Ten patients required limited open reduction. The fractures were classified according to the AO/OTA system. The average followup was 12 months (range, 6 to 18 months). Results: The mean surgical time was 45 minutes (35 to 65 minutes). The meantime to union was 14 weeks (10 - 21 weeks). The results were graded as excellent in 50, good in 18 patients, and acceptable in eight patients, using the criteria of Grace and Eversman. We had superficial infection in three cases, one case of delayed infection, painful bursa in two cases, delayed union in two cases, malunion with dislocation of the DRUJ in two cases, injury to the extensor tendon of the thumb in one case, and one case of incomplete radioulnar synostosis. Conclusion: Closed reduction and internal fixation of forearm fractures by <b>screw</b> intramedullary <b>nails</b> reestablishes the near normal relationship of the fractured fragments. <b>Screw</b> intramedullary <b>nail</b> effectively controls both rotatory forces and the migration of the nail. It produces excellent clinical results in isolated fractures of either bones, as well as both bones of the forearm in adults...|$|R
