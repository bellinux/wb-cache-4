5|$|The {{exterior}} of the temple is richly decorated. The frieze depicts a continuous line of acanthus. Furthermore, there are ornaments on the capital, architrave, and <b>soffit.</b> The stones in the front cornice have projecting sculptures of lion heads. A fragment of the architrave bearing a lion head was removed by Captain J Buchan Telfer {{in the late nineteenth}} century and bequeathed by him to the British Museum in 1907.|$|E
5|$|This ceiling conceals the mediaeval trusses of {{the fifteenth}} century ceiling. The wagon roof over the chancel was boarded or plastered, as slots in the {{principals}} show, in 1491 by William Stratford, DTh, Abbot of Vale Royal Abbey (in post 1476–1516, with gaps); the exact dating was derived from the timbers, which retain complete sapwood. The original ceiling can still be reached from the ringing chamber in the central tower, and includes an arch-braced collar-beam truss, with traces of five cross-ribs equally spaced on the <b>soffit</b> of the four-centred moulded arch. The truss had slots for the panels of a boarded ceiling (a wagon roof).|$|E
25|$|In the archway <b>soffit</b> {{there are}} various abbreviations, {{such as in the}} first arch (M, z, y, /, ///) and on the second arch various created from {{vertical}} lines.|$|E
50|$|The <b>soffits</b> of {{the panels}} have a smooth uniform finish {{as a result}} of casting them in {{polished}} steel molds. This reduces the labor cost and time typically required to grind and patch the <b>soffits</b> of cast-in-place concrete decks to achieve an acceptable aesthetic finish.|$|R
25|$|There are 14th-century {{decorative}} {{designs on}} the easternmost {{pillar of the}} south arcade and in the <b>soffits</b> of its arches.|$|R

25|$|The <b>soffit</b> of the axial archway {{is deeply}} coffered with a relief of the apotheosis of Titus at the center. The sculptural program also {{includes}} two panel reliefs lining the passageway within the arch. Both commemorate the joint triumph celebrated by Titus {{and his father}} Vespasian {{in the summer of}} 71.|$|E
25|$|The {{windows are}} mullioned and transomed, with {{originally}} {{eight or ten}} lights. The mullions and transoms are in wood and have ovolo mouldings with narrow fillets. Two eight-light windows are believed to date from the 17th century. The High Street bays have modern shop windows to the ground floor. The visible beams are ovolo moulded and feature brattishing, a form of decorative cresting. There is a slate roof, although like the other rebuilt merchants' houses on the High Street, number 46 probably originally had a tiled rather than thatched roof, a sign of wealth that was also an effective protection against the fires that destroyed parts of Hospital Street and Welsh Row in the 17th century. The timber frame uses <b>soffit</b> tenons with diminished haunch, a particularly high-quality type of carpentry joint invented early in the 16th century.|$|E
25|$|Employing asymmetry, heavy massing, {{high quality}} brickwork, {{semi-circular}} forms and simplified ornamentation, {{the design of}} St Paul's combines characteristics of Gothic, Romanesque and Arts and Crafts styles. The church is constructed in dark-red-brown Flemish bond brickwork, with painted render dressings defining features such as string courses, copings, lintels and sills (internally and externally). Stepped and plain buttresses support the exterior walls, and arched openings are constructed from multiple rowlock (brick-on-edge) courses. The prominent roof form is clad with rib-and-pan profile metal sheeting (replaced in 1997), and features flared eaves supported on decoratively trimmed rafters with a raked <b>soffit</b> of tongue-and-groove boards. The nave end walls are topped with stone cross finials, and gable ends to the vestries and entrance porch are finished with basket weave patterned brickwork. The entrance porch features a radiating arch with deep angled brick jambs, rounded window openings and a boarded ceiling. The belfry atop the octagonal bell tower is enclosed with fixed timber louvres between brick piers of alternating, three-course bands of rendered and face brickwork capped by a concrete hemispherical cupola.|$|E
50|$|The {{bridge is}} 659 m long and {{constructed}} in stone except for brick <b>soffits</b> to the arches. It has 28 arches, each spanning 60 ft. The railway is carried 37 m {{above the river}} level.|$|R

2500|$|Phase 2, {{also known}} as One Snowhill, {{comprises}} a 13 storey, [...] office building. There are three basement levels with car parking facilities and 12 floors of offices. The office building was designed by Sidell Gibson Architects, who were the concept architects, and also by Fairhursts. It was built by the Kier Group, who won the £66million contract in January 2007. The building has an overhanging, slanting wall, facing Livery Street car park. There is a colonnade at the entrance, the columns of which are faced with reconstituted slate-coloured stone whilst {{the roof of the}} colonnade is a dark grey colour-coated metal panel <b>soffit.</b> Above the edge of the colonnade are reconstituted slate-coloured stone panels and dark grey-coloured spandrel panels. Above this, although below the roof of the colonnade, is the first office floor with a floor-to-ceiling height of [...] All the office floors above this have the same floor to ceiling height. The entrance will be surrounded by clear glass with colour-coated metal frames.|$|E
2500|$|The tunnel was 2,966 yard (2712m) long, [...] wide at water level, and [...] {{from water}} to <b>soffit</b> (depending {{on the water}} level). At the time of {{building}} {{it was the third}} longest canal tunnel in the World after Sapperton and Dudley. Thirty-three shafts were sunk during construction with the workings dewatered using a Woodhouse steam engine. Water was provided for the Cromford Canal from the [...] Butterley Reservoir situated on the hill above the tunnel. The Butterley Reservoir is itself crossed by a stone railway embankment currently used by the locomotives of the Midland Railway - Butterley's preserved steam railway. Water flowed from the reservoir directly into the tunnel via an adit [...] along the tunnel from the Western Portal. Above the Eastern portal the Butterley Park Reservoir once provided water to the canal. This Reservoir was filled in during 1935. Both the tunnel and reservoirs were constructed by the Butterley Company, formed in 1790 by Benjamin Outram (1764–1805) and Francis Beresford (died 1801) with William Jessop (1745–1814) and John Wright (1758–1840) joining by 1793.|$|E
2500|$|Existing and new walls, alike, {{were covered}} in uniform, lightly textured, pale stucco {{from the ground up}} to – and {{including}} – the eave <b>soffit.</b> A continuous canted ledge of painted redwood stretched around the house below the second floor windows. Additional redwood trim was employed in rectangles to wrap around each corner on the second floor. [...] All windows and doors in the home were fashioned in leaded glass with nickel caming. The unvarying glass pattern was a variation of the typical Prairie muntin bar design and consisted of a frame of narrow rectangular and trapezoidal panes surrounding a single large glass pane. Wright arranged most windows into one of two ensembles – one for each floor – to unify his design. In five locations on the first floor, double casement windows or full length French doors were flanked by two more isolated, narrow casements. All openings on the second floor were composed of paired casements topped by a single transom light. A cantilevered, rectangular bay, which formed a focal point on the second level of the street (east) elevation, contained a band of four such three-piece windows and was subtly bookended by two deeply inset casements.|$|E

2500|$|On February 12, 2008, the Twins {{announced}} $22.4 {{million in}} upgrades {{to the original}} design, increased the Twins ownership stake in the ballpark to $167.4 million, bringing the total ballpark cost to $412 million. The upgrades were mainly based around increasing fan experience and comfort. The upgrades included an enlarged canopy <b>soffit</b> (the largest in baseball), protecting fans further from the elements despite the stadium not having a roof. The Twins also upgraded the scoreboard – the fourth-largest in Major League Baseball – from standard definition to a high definition display from Daktronics measuring [...] long and [...] high. [...] Other upgrades included warming shelters, changing [...] of the exterior surface to Kasota stone, and {{increasing the number of}} restrooms and concessions areas. The park features a modernized version of the original [...] "Minnie and Paul Shaking Hands" [...] logo used on the team's original uniforms from 1961 until 1986 (the logo has also been on the home uniforms since 2001). When a Twins player hits a home run, the Minnie and Paul sign lights up with strobe lights surrounding the Minnesota state outline and Minnie and Paul shake hands, akin to the Liberty Bell used at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia. The original flagpole from Metropolitan Stadium – completely restored – is located on the right field plaza. The flagpole was located at the American Legion post in Richfield after the Metropolitan Stadium's closing, and was donated back to the Twins by the Legion as a gesture of goodwill.|$|E
2500|$|The Marble Saloon is {{the grandest}} {{interior}} in the House, located immediately behind the south portico. Based on the Pantheon. It is elliptical in plan, , the domed ceiling is over [...] high. The room was probably designed by Vincenzo Valdrè, {{the basic structure}} was built between 1775 and 1777 but decoration was probably only complete by 1788 {{at a cost of}} £12,000. The lower half of the walls are surrounded by 16 unfluted Roman Doric columns made from red scagliola with white veins that mimics Sicilian Jasper the work of Domenico Bartoli and with white marble capitals and bases, supporting a richly detailed Doric entablature of white plaster with satyrs on the metopes. Hanging from the <b>soffit</b> of the entablature between each pair of columns are replica brass lanterns with glass domes, these are copies of the original light fittings. These columns flank four doors on the cardinal directions, the rest flank plain niches that once contained eight Ancient Roman statues these were sold in 1848, new plaster casts of eight statues from the Berlin State Museums were added to the niches flanking each door and were unveiled in September 2009. Added {{at the same time to}} the niches between each pair of statues were fibreglass copies of the original gilded Athéniennes (or Torchieres), the originals were made of timber and painted and gilded to resemble metal. Above the niches and doorways are white plaster rectangular reliefs depicting arms and trophies. Above the entablature is the very elaborate frieze, this consists of over 280 human and 14 animals in plaster all alto-relievo, the sculptor was probably Charles Peart. The subject of the frieze is the suovetaurilia. The dome is coffered of white plaster, there are 160 coffers nearly all of unique shape. The coffers contain highly decorated rosettes, and the ribs in between are also very elaborately decorated. There is a central skylight also elliptical. The floor is made of 72 four-foot-square slabs of white Carrara marble resting on a brick vault, in the centre of the floor is a metal grill part of the heating system. This is the first room to be fully restored to its pre-1848 condition.|$|E
6000|$|In Plate VIII., opposite, are {{arranged}} in one view all the conditions of Byzantine archivolt employed in Venice, on a large scale. It will be seen in an instant {{that there can be}} no mistaking the manner of their masonry. The <b>soffit</b> of the arch is the horizontal line at the bottom of all these profiles, and each of them (except 13, 14) is composed of two slabs of marble, one for the <b>soffit,</b> another for the face of the arch; the one on the <b>soffit</b> is worked on the edge into a roll (fig. 10) or dentil (fig. 9), and the one on the face is bordered on the other side by another piece let edgeways into the wall, and also worked into a roll or dentil: in the richer archivolts a cornice is added to this roll, as in figs. 1 and 4, or takes its place, as in figs. 1, 3, 5, and 6; and in such richer examples the facestone, and often the <b>soffit,</b> are sculptured, the sculpture being cut into their surfaces, as indicated in fig. 11. The concavities cut in the facestones of 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 are all indicative of sculpture in effect like that of Fig. XXVI. Vol. II., of which archivolt fig. 5, here, is the actual profile.

6000|$|... § VIII. This, then, will be {{the first}} great head under which we shall in future find it {{convenient}} to arrange a large number of archivolt decorations. It is the distinctively Southern and Byzantine form, and typically represented by the section a, of Fig. LXX.; and it is susceptible of almost every species of surface ornament, respecting which only this general law may be asserted: that, while the outside or vertical surface may properly be decorated, and yet the <b>soffit</b> or under surface left plain, the <b>soffit</b> is never to be decorated, and the outer surface left plain. Much beautiful sculpture is, in the best Byzantine buildings, half lost by being put under soffits; but the eye is led to discover it, and even to demand it, by the rich chasing of the outside of the voussoirs. It would have been an hypocrisy to carve them externally only. But there is not the smallest excuse for carving the <b>soffit,</b> and not the outside; for, in that case, we approach the building under the idea of its being perfectly plain; we do not look for the <b>soffit</b> decoration, and, of course, do not see it: or, if we do, it is merely to regret that it should not be in a better place. In the Renaissance architects, it may, perhaps, for once, be considered a merit, that they put their bad decoration systematically in the places where we should least expect it, and can seldomest see it:--Approaching the Scuola di San Rocco, you probably will regret the extreme plainness and barrenness of the window traceries; but, if you will go very close to the wall beneath the windows, you may, on sunny days, discover a quantity of panel decorations which the ingenious architect has concealed under the soffits.|$|E
60|$|It will {{be noticed}} that 2, 5, 6, and 8 are {{sculptured}} on the soffits {{as well as}} the faces; 9 is the common profile of arches decorated only with colored marble, the facestone being colored, the <b>soffit</b> white. The effect of such a moulding is seen in the small windows at the right hand of Fig. XXVI. Vol. II.|$|E
