40|$|Graduation date: 1991 A {{trial was}} {{conducted}} May 1 to September 4, 1989 at the Eastern Oregon Agricultural Research Center (EOARC) Burns, OR {{to examine the}} effects of strip or continuous grazing management on the diet and performance of steers grazing native flood meadows. The objective was to determine if <b>strip</b> <b>grazing</b> would be a more efficient means of grazing management than continuous grazing. The experiment was designed to test diet quality, botanical composition of the diet, daily dry matter (DM) intake and performance of yearling steers. Eighty yearling steers weighing 253 ± 17 kg were selected from cattle at the Squaw Butte Experiment Station. The experimental design was a randomized complete block, with blocking based on past forage production. Treatments were continuous or <b>strip</b> <b>grazing.</b> A representative meadow of approximately 22. 4 ha was divided into four equal pastures. Continuous grazing steers had access to 5. 6 ha pastures for the duration of the study. Animals on <b>strip</b> <b>grazing</b> were confined to an area that was estimated to provide 5 - 7 days of forage using New Zealand portable electric fencing. Strip sizes were predetermined based on standing forage crop. Steers were not allowed to graze more than 7 days in any one strip. Diet quality was estimated from bi-weekly esophageal samples. Extrusa was collected from 4 esophageal fistulated steers per treatment on two consecutive days. Collections were timed to coincide with the mid point of the strip being currently grazed. Samples were pooled by collection dates and analyzed for CP and IVOMD. Dietary OM intake was estimated from biweekly, 24 hr total fecal collections starting the day following esophageal collections. Total DM fecal output from 6 fecal collection steers per treatment was corrected with the...|$|E
40|$|Although grazing {{of dairy}} cows {{is very common}} in the Netherlands, the number of grazing cows is decreasing. Mobile milking robots might support grazing, in {{particular}} in situations of large herds, in remote grassland areas and in extensive natural grasslands. In the Netherlands, a stand-alone mobile milking robot has been developed using caterpillar tracks. Every day, this milking robot moves to a new part of the pasture and every two days concentrates, fuel, water and milk are separately transported from and to the mobile milking robot. The system was tested in the 2008 grazing season using a herd of 35 dairy cows. During the 2009 grazing season the project was scaled up to a herd of 60 cows on an area of 20 ha peat soil. In 2009 a <b>strip</b> <b>grazing</b> system with controlled as well as free cow traffic was used {{in order to increase}} the visit and milking frequency.

40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was aimed at}} studying the diurnal rhythm of dairy cows eating behaviour at different stocking systems, and quantifying the effect of daily ambient temperature on this diurnal rhythm. In two experiments {{carried out in the}} summer of 2003 in The Netherlands, eight dairy cows were offered fresh pasture of perennial ryegrass. In the first experiment, four cows were given access to 1 ha pasture under a continuous stocking system (CSS), whereas, in the second experiment, four cows were given access to 528 m 2 of a pasture daily, under a 1 -day <b>strip</b> <b>grazing</b> system (SGS). In both experiments, grazing behaviour was measured repeatedly using jaw recorders. Under CSS, dairy cows had the longest meal at the evening, whereas under SGS, they had the longest meal in the afternoon. Under both systems, bite rate was maximal and chewing rate minimal during the evening bout. Dairy cows reduced their daylight eating time when maximum daily ambient temperature exceeded 25 °C. Bite rate and chewing rate were not influenced by management or ambient temperature. It appears to be possible to influence the timing and length (duration) of grazing bouts by management, mainly by changing the timing of allocating the new plot. However, it seems to be harder to influence the daily rhythm in bite rate and chewing rate, as both appeared not be influenced by ambient temperature or managemen...|$|E

40|$|Abstract – Animal trials {{cannot be}} used in routine in a forage grass-breeding {{programme}} or in a cultivar testing procedure. An alternative to these animal trials is to identify plant traits associated with a high animal production under grazing {{that could be used}} as selection criteria. For this, the effect of sward structure on milk production was studied, comparing four late-heading diploid per-ennial ryegrass cultivars (Lolium perenne L.) under grazing. They were rotationally <b>strip</b> <b>grazed</b> with forty-eight autumn calving dairy cows during three periods in spring 1999. Herbage allowance was 18 kg DM·cow– 1 ·day– 1 and the rotation interval was 3 weeks. Differences in milk production were small but significant. Cows that grazed cultivar 1 exhibited an extra milk production of 0. 4 kg·cow– 1 ·day– 1 than those that grazed cultivar 4. Total biomass, digestibility and nitrogen con-tents were similar irrespective of the cultivar. Cultivar 4 exhibited a higher biomass per tiller but a lower tiller density, bulk density and green leaf mass in the upper layers of the sward compared to cultivar 1. Cows likely ingested more pseudostems formed by the sheath tubes and the stem growing inside grazing cultivar 4 than the others (14 vs. 8 cm). The intermediate layers of the sward, con-taining pseudostems, were 6. 7 points less digestible than the upper layers. Therefore, the ingested herbage of cultivar 4 was likely to be less digestible and less palatable than the others...|$|R
40|$|In 2010, the National Organic Program {{implemented}} a rule for the US stating that pasture {{must be a}} significant source of feed in organic ruminant systems. This article will focus on how the pasture rule has impacted the management, economics and nutritional value of products derived from organic ruminant systems and the interactions of grazing cattle with pasture forages and soils. The use of synthetic fertilizers is prohibited in organic systems; therefore, producers must rely on animal manures, compost and cover crops to increase and maintain soil nitrogen content. Rotational and <b>strip</b> <b>grazing</b> are two of the most common grazing management practices utilized in grazing ruminant production systems; however, these practices are not exclusive to organic livestock producers. For dairy cattle, grazing reduces foot and leg problems common in confinement systems, but lowers milk production and exposes cows to parasites that can be difficult to treat without pharmaceuticals. Organic beef cattle may still be finished in feedlots for no more than 120 days in the US, but without growth hormones and antibiotics, gains may be reduced and illnesses increased. Grazing reduces the use of environmentally and economically costly concentrate feeds and recycles nutrients back to the soil efficiently, but lowers the rate of beef liveweight gain. Increased use of pasture can be economically, environmentally and socially sustainable if forage use efficiency is high and US consumers continue to pay a premium for organic beef and dairy products...|$|E
40|$|Livestock face complex {{foraging}} options {{associated with}} optimizing nutrient intake while {{being able to}} avoid areas posing risk of parasites or disease. Areas of tall nutrient-rich swards around fecal deposits may be attractive for grazing, but might incur fitness costs from parasites. We use the example of dairy cattle and the risks of tuberculosis transmission posed to them by pastures contaminated with badger excreta to examine this trade-off. A risk may be posed either by aerosolized inhalation through investigation or by ingestion via grazing contaminated swards. We quantified the levels of investigation and grazing of 150 dairy cows at badger latrines (accumulations of feces and urine) and crossing points (urination-only sites). Grazing behavior was compared between strip-grazed and rotation-grazed fields. <b>Strip</b> <b>grazing</b> had fields subdivided for grazing periods of 3 ̆c 24 h, whereas rotational grazing involved access to whole fields for 1 to 7 d each. A higher proportion of the herd investigated badger latrines than crossing points or controls. Cattle initially avoided swards around badger latrines but not around crossing points. Avoidance periods were shorter in strip- compared with rotation-grazing systems. In rotation-grazing management, latrines were avoided for longer times, but there were more investigative contacts than with strip-grazing management. If investigation is a major route of tuberculosis transmission, the risk to cattle is greatest in extensive rotation-grazing systems. However, if ingestion of fresh urine is the primary method of transmission, strip-grazing management may pose a greater threat. Farming systems affect the level and type of contact between livestock and wildlife excreta and thus the risks of disease...|$|E
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} {{study the effects of}} sward height (experiment I) and the distance between barn and pasture plot (experiment II) on cows’ visits to an automatic milking system (AMS) and other behaviour. The study was carried out in a situation in which grazing was combined with fully automatic milking. The cows had to visit the system voluntarily without interference of the farmer. The AMS was continuously available in the barn adjacent to the pasture. The pasture was divided into ten plots of 1 ha for the two experiments and the preceding habituation. The same group of 24 Holstein Friesian cows was used in both experiments. The cows were allowed to spend up to 15 h at pasture daily. The results of experiment I (rotational grazing) showed that the total number of AMS visits increased from 4. 4 to 7. 3 and that the number of milkings increased from 2. 6 to 3. 0 when sward height decreased (P< 0. 01). The results of experiment II (<b>strip</b> <b>grazing)</b> showed that a distance of 360 m between pasture and barn did not affect the cows’ visits to the AMS. In both experiments, cows preferred to lie in the pasture, when available, rather than in the cubicles, and tended to visit the barn group-wise and to enter the AMS in close succession. As a consequence, in the period that the cows had access to the pasture there were peaks in AMS visits, and the AMS was unvisited for several hours...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1990 The {{objective}} of this thesis is to assess four winter feeding programs of spring-calving brood cows that may improve profitability to ranching operations of the Harney Basin, Oregon. The four feeding strategies include <b>strip</b> <b>grazed</b> rake-bunched hay, supplemented range <b>grazing,</b> <b>strip</b> <b>grazed</b> meadow pasture, and baled hay feeding. These first three alternatives were compared to baled hay feeding, the preferred practice of the region, in terms of profitability to the operation and management requirements. To evaluate the alternatives a deterministic biophysical-economic simulation model was constructed. The biophysical model simulates relationships between (1) the physiological status and nutritional requirements of mature gestating cows, (2) the forage base being utilized, and (3) {{the effects of the}} physical environment upon the nutritional requirements of cows and their ability to forage successfully for food. The biological simulation is designed to provide, as output, measures of cow reproductive performance and forage utilization. This information is integrated into herd and pasture management subroutines to yield measures of herd production, and pasture and feed utilization. An economic subroutine uses results from the herd production and forage utilization subroutines to estimate costs and net returns to each feeding strategy. Risk is introduced into the simulation by varying the climatic components of the physical environment. Four winter scenarios are represented, ranging from mild to very severe. Probabilities are assigned to each winter scenario for each feeding program. The probabilities under each alternative {{for each of the four}} climate scenarios are combined to yield estimates of the expected net return of the feeding strategy. Analysis of the results indicate that raked-bunched hay is the best alternative to baled hay feeding. Returns are substantially higher as a result of reduced wintering costs. Cow performance factors remain nearly identical to hay fed cows, and management of the winter operation is simplified. In addition, there appears to be little risk associated with management of the raked hay alternative. The range grazing program also yields superior economic results to the operation when compared to baled hay feeding. Although there is considerable variation in net returns to the alternative over the climate scenarios, the expected return to range grazing is substantially higher than the baled hay strategy. Variability in net returns to range grazing is due to effects of ground snow depth levels which may prevent cows from feeding on range forages. When these conditions occur emergency hay feeding is required. Management of the operation is intensified, increasing with the severity of the winter. Based upon the economic results of the simulation it appears that range grazing is a promising alternative to baled hay. However, because empirical data are limited regarding the adaptability of this alternative in the Harney Basin, more information is needed regarding (1) ground snow depth level effects upon the feeding success of cows, and (2) reproductive performance of cows following severe winters. The results of the meadow grazing alternative indicate that this strategy is not a viable alternative to baled hay feeding. Returns to the operation are reduced as the result of poor cow reproductive factors, and the vulnerability of this strategy to relatively shallow snow cover requiring large amounts of emergency feeding...|$|R

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} on 14 ha of Caducifolia thorny forest with an average total dry matter yield of 800 kg/ha/year. The area of study was divided into two 7 ha camps. Thirty-five Alpine goats were allocated {{to one of the}} camps in a continuous grazing system, called the free grazing (FG) camp treatment. Another 35 goats were placed in the other camp where <b>strip</b> <b>grazing</b> was controlled by means of a solar mobile grazing (SMG) system. A high (163 AU/ha) and a low (40. 8 AU/ha) stocking rate, allocating 625 m 2 and 1. 250 m 2, respectively, were applied in the SMG treatment. The number of goats varied to adjust stocking rate daily. The goats were allowed to graze five hours/day. Herbage utilization was measured, using as initial markers the grass length of 24 to 30 cm and number of leaves (156 ± 17) on selected shrub branches, 40 cm long. The botanical composition was determined {{at the beginning and end}} of the grazing period. Chemical analyses of forage selected by the goats were performed monthly. In the SMG treatment the average grass height changed from 37. 1 cm in June to 65. 2 cm in February, while percentage leaves changed from 18. 4 % to 5. 9 %, compared to changes of 41. 4 cm to 42. 3 cm and 16. 3 % to 0. 91 % in the FG treatment, respectively. In the SMG treatment the goats spent 80 % of their time browsing in July and August and 100 % of their time from December until March. It is concluded that the economical and social status of the rural community would be improved using the SMG system. ______________________________________________________________________________________...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compile {{practical}} feeding guidelines for donkeys in the UK. Current guidelines are to feed 0. 75 of horse feeding recommendations on a body weight basis. However, the superior digestive efficiency of donkeys, compared to horses, may render the use of horse recommendations inappropriate. The formulation of guidelines specific to donkeys would enable owners to calculate their donkey‟s requirements with greater accuracy and prevent overfeeding. A postal survey, used to gain information on the body condition score of donkeys in the UK, and the husbandry and feeding practices used to manage them, indicated that approximately 24 % of donkeys in the UK are overweight. Feeding practices indicated that although owners were aware of their donkey‟s requirement for fibrous forages, the practice of feeding unnecessary concentrates, chaffs and high energy forages, in addition to grazing, was the likely cause of donkeys becoming overweight. The finding that the majority (85 – 90 %) of donkeys were kept as non-working companion animals also reduced the need for owners to feed higher energy foods to their donkeys. Results also suggested that owners were unsure of how to adjust their donkey‟s diet to account for seasonal changes in requirements and pasture availability, as most owners‟ adjusted grazing access, and not the feeding of supplementary feeds. From a study of dry matter (DM) and digestible energy (DE) intakes by 20 mature donkeys maintaining weight during each UK season, the maintenance DE requirements of donkeys were calculated. Results showed no effect of sex on DM or DE intake. Season significantly (P< 0. 001) affected DM and DE intakes, implying increased requirements in winter compared to spring, summer and autumn. Dry matter intakes (DMI) increased from 51 g/kg BW 0. 75 in spring, summer and autumn to 66 g/kg BW 0. 75 in winter. Digestible energy requirements increased from 0. 32 MJ/kg BW 0. 75 in spring, summer and autumn to 0. 43 MJ/kg BW 0. 75 in winter. Comparison of results with horse recommendations showed considerably reduced requirements by donkeys. Horse recommendations overestimated DE requirements in summer and winter by 82 and 30 %, respectively, making horse recommendations unsuitable for calculating donkey energy requirements. Husbandry practices commonly used by owners to manage their donkeys grazing access (grazing time, grazing area, <b>strip</b> <b>grazing),</b> were assessed for their effect on DMI by grazing donkeys in summer and autumn, using n-alkanes. The effect of grazing time was assessed by restricting donkeys to 8, 12 or 23 hours grazing per day. Season significantly affected food intake with donkeys in the 8 and 23 hour grazing groups eating more during summer when pasture availability was greater. Donkeys responded to the poorer quality summer pasture by grazing more intensively but less selectively, increasing the rate at which food was consumed. Grazing time was only influential over grass intake in summer, when pasture was more abundant. Restricting donkeys to 12 hours or less grazing per day significantly (P< 0. 001) reduced their grass intake compared to that of donkeys with 23 hours access. When grazing sparse pastures (autumn), grazing time did not influence grass intake, indicating an effect of herbage mass on grazing behaviour. Herbage mass was the most influential factor over diet composition (percentage of grass and straw consumed) in a second grazing study assessing the affect of <b>strip</b> <b>grazing</b> and set stocking systems on intake by grazing donkeys during summer and autumn. Herbage mass per donkey was higher in the set stocking system during both seasons, resulting in higher grass intakes. Determining if either grazing system was more effective at regulating grass intake was prevented due to differences in pasture availability between study sites. It is concluded that donkeys have lower DMI and maintenance DE requirements than horses, requiring donkey feeding guidelines to be formulated. Excess body weight in donkeys is caused in part, by the feeding of energy dense feeds in addition to low energy forages. Most owners place little nutritional importance on pasture, despite its potential to provide a large percentage of daily DM, DE and nutrient intake. Therefore nutritional guidelines must include advice on how to manage access to grazing, and how to feed donkeys with access to pasture. Restricting grazing time to 8 hours a day did reduce grass intake by donkeys, but was only effective when grazing abundant pastures. Providing ad libitum straw to grazing donkeys allows them to satisfy their DM and dietary fibre requirements without consuming excess energy.

40|$|The {{nonpoint source}} {{pollution}} {{problem can be}} controlled by implementing various best management practices (BMPs) in the watershed. However, before such practices are adopted, their effectiveness at various spatial and temporal scales must be evaluated. The objective {{of this research was}} to evaluate a suite of BMPs in a pasture-dominated watershed in their effectiveness at controlling nutrient losses. A total of 171 different BMP combinations incorporating grazing and pasture management, riparian and buffer zones, and poultry litter applications were evaluated for their effectiveness using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. The SWAT model was parameterized using detailed farm and watershed-scale data. The stochasticity in weather was captured by generating 250 various possible weather realizations for a 25 -year period, using measured historical climate data for the watershed. Model results indicated that losses of both total nitrogen, mineral phosphorus, and total phosphorus increased with an increase in litter application rates. For the same application rates, greatest losses were predicted for fall application timings compared to spring and summer applications. Overgrazing resulted in greater nutrient losses compared to baseline conditions for all application rates, timings, and litter characteristics, indicating that overgrazing of pasture areas must be avoided if any improvement in the water quality is to be expected. Variability in weather conditions significantly affected BMP performance; under certain weather conditions, an increase in pollutant losses can be greater than reductions due to BMPs implemented in the watershed.

40|$|In my bachelor's thesis I give an {{overview}} of sheep farming and grazing using sheepdogs. In the first part, I focus on rearing sheep [...] especially {{on the characteristics of}} types and breeds reared for profit, on nutrition, housing and grazing. In the second part, I focus on rearing sheepdogs, especially on their characteristics and selected breeds, choice of pups, upbringing, care, and problem behaviour. I have tried to point out the differences in temperament and type of sheepdogs compared with regularly reared dog breeds. Sheep farming has a long tradition in the Czech Republic and remains an important sector of livestock production. The importance of sheep farming lies mainly in the versatile usableness of sheep (meat, milk, wool and by-products, e. g. manure) and, in the recent years, also in ecological farming. Sheep are being reared in sheepfolds or adapted buildings. Sheep are typical grazing animals. There are various grazing systems: set stocking, paddock grazing, <b>strip</b> <b>grazing,</b> and grazing of sheep in combination with other farm animals. To feed sheep, we usually either let them graze or [...] in the winter [...] feed them hay; alternatively we use sillage, high-energy feeds or root crops. There are a large number of breeds of sheep used for grazing. Based on their purpose, we distinguish combined breeds (e. g. Merino, Merinolandschaf, Tsigai), meat- (e. g. Suffolk, Charollais, Texel) and milk-breeds (e. g. East Friesian sheep), and prolific breeds (e. g. Romanov sheep). Both pure breeding and crossbreeding are being used. Together with the return to sheep grazing, breeders are increasingly using sheepdogs for the protection of their herds. A sheepdog can independently guard a herd and its constant presence deters predators, stray dogs and thieves. Sheepdogs live with herds on pastures. The breeds used include Bernese Mountain Dog, Caucasian, Anatolian Shepherd Dog and Central Asian Shepherd Dog. These dogs are strong and massive, confident, and fearless even when facing large predators. These breeds have no tests of performance so we choose pups from litters where the parents work and use their instincts on a daily basis. These dogs have genetic dispositions for guarding and only need time for the development of their skills. Training sheepdogs is therefore focused primarily on managing unwanted behaviour and upbringing near herds of sheep so that the dog can form a strong bond with sheep...|$|E
40|$|The EU {{regulations}} for organic farming require outdoor access for pigs, {{as one of}} the main organic principles is to establish sustainable farming systems including harmonious relationships between animals, plants and environment. Outdoor access for pigs provides benefits in terms of animal welfare as pigs are able to express their natural and social behaviour. However, it is still common to keep organic growing pigs indoors with access to outdoor concrete yards. Main reasons for not keeping growing pigs on pasture are high nutrient inputs to the free-range area and high feed costs due to an increased energy demand in outdoor pigs. Reasons for the high nutrient loads on free range areas are the not-random excretory behaviour as well as the high input of supplemental feed. The reduction and better distribution of nutrients on the field can be achieved by different strategies. Considering the excretory behaviour and foraging activity of pigs the main focus in this study was to identify suitable environmental friendly paddock management systems for organic growing pigs with high animal welfare standards. For identifying those, an experiment with growing pigs was conducted in Denmark. Within this experiment growing pigs got access to two strategies of land allocation. They got either access to 3 x 12 m of new land right away (allocation strategy 3) or to 1 x 12 m of new land on three days in a row (allocation strategy 1). In combination with new land they got one of the forage crops alfalfa or grass-clover and access to either high or low protein content in the supplemental feed. During the experiment behavioural observations were performed. Rooting, grazing, urinating and defecating were recorded to investigate the effect of management system on the pig’s behaviour. It was shown that pigs are rooting and grazing significantly more often in new land. However, urinating in this study is performed to a significantly lower extent in new land compared to old land. The allocation strategy affects foraging activity and excretory behaviour when the three observation days are regarded separately. From the present study it became clear that paddock management strategies should be based on mobile systems including frequent allocation of new land, e. g. <b>strip</b> <b>grazing</b> or pasture rotations and mobile huts, feeders and drinkers. An interesting approach is to establish mobile paddock systems such as the mobile organic piggery (MOP). Nevertheless, more research in the field of paddock management systems is required. In particular more knowledge on mobile fence systems is necessary to make these systems common on farms...|$|E
40|$|Energy is the first-limiting {{nutrient}} for cows grazing pasture therefore, energy supplementation {{is necessary}} for high producing animals. In pasture-based systems, the concentrate is fed twice {{a day in the}} dairy parlour during the milking procedure. Consumption of large amounts of fermentable carbohydrates results in a drop in rumen pH and this may induce rumen acidosis. This may lead to reduced intake, lower fibre digestion and depressed milk yield. Supplemental yeast offer great possibilities in stabilising the rumen fermentation patterns and, therefore, improving dry matter intakes (DMI). This may increase milk production, milk composition parameters, rumen volatile fatty acid concentrations (VFA) which leads to higher profits. Investigating these responses, a trial was conducted, where live yeast (Levucell SC 10 ME-Titan) was supplemented to Jersey cows grazing ryegrass/kikuyu pastures, supplemented with 6 kg (as is) dairy concentrate per day split over two milking periods. Thirty multiparous high-producing Jersey cows between 30 and 120 days in milk (DIM) were selected, blocked and randomly allocated to control (no yeast) or live yeast treatment groups. Ten fistulated lactating cows were added in a cross-over design (two periods and two treatments) and all 40 cows <b>strip</b> <b>grazed</b> Italian ryegrass (Lollium multiflorum) and kikuyu pastures as one group. A new pasture strip was allocated after each milking and pasture was measured using a rising plate meter (RPM). The yeast product Levucell SC 10 ME – Titan containing Saccharomyces cerevisiae CNCM I- 1077 was supplied by Lallemand S. A. S (19 rue des Briquetiers, 31702 Blagnac cedex, France). The Levucell SC 10 ME – Titan is a micro-encapsulated formulation for premix and pelleted feeds. The yeast treatment group had the yeast pelleted in with the dairy concentrate at a concentration of 167 g of yeast per ton of concentrate, to obtain the required intake of 1 g yeast per cow per day as specified by Lallemand. Milk yields were recorded daily and composite milk samples were taken every two weeks to determine, milk fat, protein, lactose, milk urea nitrogen (MUN) and somatic cell count (SCC) contents. The fistulated cows were adapted to their respective diets and treatments for 21 days after which the pH measurment, rumen fluid sampling, and In sacco study were conducted. Milk yield, 4 % fat corrected milk (FCM) yield, milk protein and lactose percentages, SCC, body condition score (BCS), and live weight did not differ (P > 0. 05) between treatments. The milk fat% however, was higher for the yeast supplemented cows at 4. 24 % compared to the control group of cows of 3. 99 % (P 0. 05). The mean In sacco neutral detergent fibre (NDF), organic matter (OM) and DM disappearance was higher for the yeast treatment group of cows after a 12 and 24 hour incubation compared to the control group (P < 0. 05). The mean ruminal NDF disappearance of ryegrass in cows supplemented with yeast increased by 11. 9 % and 6. 3 % compared to the control at the 12 and 24 hour incubation periods, respectively. With higher fibre digestibilities in the rumen and more acetate available at the mammary gland and subsequently higher milk fat percentages, the yeast effects on stimulating the cellulolytic bacteria in the rumen, may be a possible explanation for the results in the current study and it is well documented in previous studies. Live yeast supplementation resulted in higher milk fat percentages which improved milk price. Dissertation (MSc(Agric)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2011.

40|$|Ruminant feed {{supplements}} are price {{sensitive and}} are effected by the continuous fluctuation of other raw material feed prices. Therefore, improving {{the efficiency of}} production and reducing cost of supplement concentrates for dairy cows are becoming increasingly important both for the smallholder and commercial dairy farmer. This can be overcome by replacing expensive energy and protein feeds with cheaper by-products. During periods of high maize prices, replacing maize with lower cost high fibre by-products becomes an economically viable option. Palm kernel expeller (PKE) fits {{the profile of a}} low cost, high fibre by-product. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the effect of different inclusion levels of PKE in dairy concentrates for Jersey cows on milk production, milk composition, body weight (BW) and body condition score (BCS) change, rumen parameters and in situ ruminal kikuyu/ryegrass pasture degradability of dry matter (DMd) and neutral detergent fibre (NDFd) as well as NDFd rate (NDF kd). The study was conducted at the Outeniqua Research Farm situated near George in the Western Cape and cows grazed high quality kikuyu/ryegrass pasture during spring. Forty eight multiparous high producing Jersey cows were blocked according to 4 % fat corrected milk (FCM), days in milk (DIM) and lactation number and randomly allocated to three treatments (control, low PKE, and high PKE). The PKE inclusion level in the control, low PKE, and high PKE treatment concentrates was 0, 20, and 40 %, respectively. The PKE replaced part of the maize and protein sources in the concentrate. Milk yield was recorded daily and milk composition was determined in two week intervals over a 60 d period, after a 21 d adaptation period. Additionally, eight lactating rumen-fistulated cows were randomly allocated to the control and high PKE treatment in a two period crossover design. Ruminal pH, volatile fatty acids (VFA’s), ruminal ammonia-nitrogen (NH 3 -N), and in situ ruminal kikuyu/ryegrass pasture DMd, NDFd and NDF kd were measured. Cows received 6 kg (as is) concentrate per day divided over two milking periods and <b>strip</b> <b>grazed</b> kikuyu/ryegrass pasture as one group. Milk yield and milk fat content did not differ (P > 0. 05) between treatments and were 21. 3, 21. 3 and 20. 7 kg/cow/d and 4. 63, 4. 65, and 4. 66 % for cows receiving the control, low PKE and high PKE treatments, respectively. Milk protein, milk urea nitrogen (MUN), BW and BCS did not differ (P > 0. 05) between treatments. Total VFA’s, average ruminal pH, ruminal NH 3 -N, and in situ ruminal kikuyu/ryegrass pasture DMd and NDFd as well as NDF kd did not differ (P > 0. 05) between treatments. The acetic to propionic acid ratio was, however, higher (P < 0. 05) for cows supplemented with the high PKE treatment. It can be concluded that partial replacement of maize with 20 or 40 % PKE in a lactating dairy cow concentrate did not affect milk yield, milk fat content, milk protein content, somatic cell count (SCC), BW, or BCS. Rumen fermentation was unaffected and a healthy rumen environment was sustained. The replacement of higher cost maize and soybean oilcake by a lower cost PKE decreased feed cost. It is however not recommended to include PKE at 40 % in the concentrate due to the increased time spent by cows in the milking parlour and the low palatability of PKE, which could lead to the tendency of increased concentrate refusals. It can be extrapolated from the data obtained from this study that milk production will be sustained when PKE is fed to cows on pasture at 2. 4 kg/cow/day.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} during the period May to September, 1999 {{to determine the effect}} of phosphorus (P) supplementation to beef weaners grazing kikuyu (Pennisetum clandestinum) foggage during winter followed by hay towards the end of winter at Dundee in northern KwaZulu-Natal. Foggaging is defined as the practice of allowing herbage to accumulate on a pasture during the growing season (Gertenbach, 1998). This accumulated herbage is then utilized by grazing animals during the dormant season. A total of 200 crossbred beef weaners (average age six months and average weight 175 kg) was used in the trial. Animals were randomly allocated into five groups, each receiving a different supplemental treatment. The treatments were different levels of P supplementation, administered through free-choice P lick supplements, viz. at levels of 0 g P, 2 g P, 4 g P, 6 g P and 8 g P per animal per day. The experiment was divided into two phases. During the first phase (08 - 06 - 99 to 20 - 07 - 99) the weaners grazed kikuyu foggage and during the second phase (05 - 08 - 99 to 16 - 09 - 99) they received Smutsfinger(Digitaria eriantha) hay ad libitum. During phase 1 the average weight gain of the animals in Group 1 (receiving 8 g P/animal/day) was significant higher (6 kg/animal during trial) than that of the control group, which received 0 g P/day/animal. Phase 2 which represented a transition from winter to summer showed that Group 1 had an average weight loss of 0. 88 kg/animal but the control group lost an average of 5. 13 kg/animal. Throughout the trial blood was collected from five animals randomly selected from each group. Plasma inorganic P (Pi) concentrations remained between 1. 94 and 2. 58 mmol/L. The average trend during phase 1 was that the Pi concentrations increased, while during phase 2, Pi concentrations dropped more (P ¡Ü 0. 5) in the animals of Group 1 (8 g P/animal/day) than in the control. This resulted that during the entire experimental period plasma Pi in Group 5 increased while that in Group 1 decreased. Before the animals entered a <b>grazing</b> <b>strip,</b> herbage samples were collected at 14 to 20 day intervals from the five <b>strip</b> <b>grazed</b> kikuyu camps. Samples were divided into leaves and stems which were analysed separately. Mean foggage calcium (Ca) and P concentrations ranged from 25. 0 to 29. 0 g/kg DM and 20. 0 to 27. 0 g/kg DM, respectively, while the Ca:P ratios ranged from 1. 20 : 1 to 1. 60 : 1. Calcium concentrations were significantly lower (P = 0. 0026) in the stems than in the leaves of the kikuyu foggage, while P concentrations decreased significantly over time, resulting in extremely low foggage P concentrations {{towards the end of the}} grazing season. This decrease in P concentrations resulted in Ca:P ratios of above 1 : 1 instead of the reported ratios of below 1 : 1 in kikuyu herbage due to low herbage Ca concentrations. The Ca concentrations in the kikuyu in this study were in the same range as herbage concentrations reported in the literature, but P concentrations were much lower than the reported herbage P concentrations. As with the summer pastures we found that magnesium (Mg) concentrations (ranging from 2. 1 to 2. 6 g/kg DM) were adequate in terms of the requirements of most classes of ruminants. However, potassium (K) concentrations (ranging from 11. 4 to 20. 3 g/kg DM) were well in excess of animal requirements, and Mg absorption could be severely inhibited by the oversupply of K The sodium (Na) concentration in kikuyu foggage was, as with herbage, inadequate in terms of animal requirements. Zinc (Zn) and manganese (Mn) concentrations were well above animal requirements but below toxic levels. Copper (Cu) concentrations was above animal requirements during May (onset of the study) but decreased significantly to levels below minimum animal requirements. Selenium (Se) concentrations were found to be largely inadequate in terms of animal requirements. The neutral detergent fibre (NDF) levels in kikuyu foggage tended to increase with maturity while acid detergent fibre (ADF) levels did not vary significantly. Crude protein (CP) concentrations decreased as winter progressed to reach levels of < 60 g/kg DM in the dry foggage, indicating that supplementation of CP would be required by animals grazing the kikuyu foggage in mid-winter. It is concluded that if little or no gain is expected from weaners in winter, the Ca and P concentrations in the kikuyu foggage should be adequate. However, if even slight weight gains are required, supplementation of Ca and P would be necessary when the foggage is dry. The P and CP composition of pastures in general were closely correlated and had a seasonal pattern with maximum levels during summer and minimum levels during winter. We can therefore expect that pastures and kikuyu foggage low on protein will also have a P deficiency. In the dry winter we should therefore firstly supplement for protein and energy and then P. The supplementation of P during winter has not only been very positive (in other studies) with positive results on weight gain during the winter period but also during the months thereafter. It is concluded that beef weaners grazing kikuyu foggage in northern KwaZulu-Natal would require supplemental P to maintain their body weights during winter as well as beef weaners on Smutsfinger hay. The recommended level of P supplementation is 8 g P/animal/day. Dissertation (MSc (Animal Science)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2007. Animal and Wildlife Sciencesunrestricte...|$|R
40|$|Kikuyu (Pennisetum clandestinum) is {{a summer}} growing {{tropical}} pasture species well {{adapted to the}} Midlands of KwaZulu-Natal. Kikuyu foggage (standing hay) could {{play an important role}} in a fodder flow programme to sustain dry ewes during late winter after their lambs have been weaned in mid-winter. The potential of kikuyu foggage to supply in the feed requirements of dry ewes was evaluated over four winter periods. The foggage was obtained by closing off the kikuyu to grazing during either late January or late February. The foggage was grazed for eight weeks, from mid-July to mid-September, using either <b>strip</b> or continuous <b>grazing</b> systems. Closing off date did not significantly influence the chemical composition of the material on offer. The ewes in the different treatments lost between 4. 7 and 10. 3 % of their initial body weight over the grazing period. In vitro digestible organic matter (IVDOM) of the foggage declined as winter progressed and was positively correlated with the body weight loss of the ewes. Foggage utilization varied between 36. 7 and 43. 5 %, indicating a high proportion of fodder wastage. The body weight loss of the dry ewes during the grazing period suggested that kikuyu foggage in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands was unable to sustain the body weight of the dry ewe...|$|R

40|$|Waterborne {{outbreaks}} of gastrointestinal diseases are {{of great concern}} to drinking water producers and can give rise to substantial costs to the society. The World Health Organisation promotes an approach where {{the emphasis is on}} mitigating risks close to the contamination source. In order to handle microbial risks efficiently, {{there is a need for}} systematic risk management. In this paper we present a framework for microbial risk management of drinking water systems. The framework incorporates cost-benefit analysis as a decision support method. The hydrological Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model, which was set up for the Stäket catchment area in Sweden, was used to simulate the effects of four different mitigation measures on microbial concentrations. The modelling results showed that the two mitigation measures that resulted in a significant (p < 0. 05) reduction of Cryptosporidium spp. and Escherichia coli concentrations were a vegetative filter strip linked to cropland and improved treatment (by one Log 10 unit) at the wastewater treatment plants. The mitigation measure with a vegetative filter <b>strip</b> linked to <b>grazing</b> areas resulted in a significant reduction of Cryptosporidium spp., but not of E. coli concentrations. The mitigation measure with enhancing the removal efficiency of all on-site wastewater treatment systems (total removal of 2 Log 10 units) did not achieve any significant reduction of E. coli or Cryptosporidium spp. concentrations. The SWAT model was useful when characterising the effect of different mitigation measures on microbial concentrations.

Alum-treated litter applications resulted in greater TN losses, and fewer TP losses than the losses from untreated poultry litter applications. For the same litter application rates, sediment and TP losses are greater for summer applications than fall and spring applications, while TN losses are greater for fall applications. Overgrazing management resulted in the greatest sediment and phosphorus losses, and VFS is the most influential management practice in reducing pollutant losses. Simulations also indicate that climate change impacts TSS losses the most, resulting in a larger magnitude of TSS losses. However, the performance of selected BMPs in reducing TN and TP losses was more stable in future climate change conditions than in the BMP performance in the historical climate condition. We recommend that selection of BMPs to reduce TSS losses should be a priority concern when multiple uses of BMPs that benefit nutrient reductions are considered in a watershed. Therefore, the BMP combination of spring litter application, optimum grazing management and filter strip with a VFS ratio of 42 could be a promising alternative for use in mitigating future climate change...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWhite clover (Trifolium repens) is an {{important}} legume for grazed grassland that can increase the profitability and environmental sustainability of milk production. Previous experiments on mown grass-clover plots suggest that low postgrazing heights (PGH) can increase sward clover content and herbage production. However, {{this has not been}} tested in actual <b>strip</b> or rotational <b>grazing</b> systems with dairy cows. Furthermore, lowering PGH in grass-only swards (typically perennial ryegrass without white clover) has previously been associated with reduced milk yields per cow. The objective of this experiment was to investigate the effect of PGH by dairy cows on clover content, herbage production, and milk production from strip-grazed grass-white clover swards in Ireland. Three target PGH treatments of 4, 5, and 6 cm were in place for entire grazing seasons (February to November) for 3 consecutive years (2007 to 2009). Each treatment had a mean of 21 Holstein-Friesian dairy cows that strip-grazed a mean annual area of 10. 2 ha. Postgrazing height was measured twice a day with a rising plate meter, and cows were moved to the next strip once the target PGH was reached. Annual fertilizer nitrogen input was 90 kg of N/ha for each treatment. The PGH treatment did not significantly affect annual milk yield (6, 202 kg/cow), solids-corrected milk yield (6, 148 kg/cow), fat, protein, or lactose yields (265, 222, and 289 kg/cow, respectively), cow liveweight (592 kg) or body condition score (3. 01). The PGH treatment also had no significant effect on sward white clover content (196 g/kg). However, herbage production of both grass and clover were significantly higher with the 4 -cm PGH treatment compared with the 6 -cm treatment. Mean annual herbage yields were 11. 1, 10. 2, and 9. 1 t of organic matter (OM) /ha for the 4 -, 5 -, and 6 -cm PGH treatments, respectively. The lower herbage production in the 6 -cm PGH treatment resulted in lower annual silage production, greater housing requirements, and a substantially higher net silage deficit (− 1, 917 kg of OM/cow) compared with the 5 - or 4 -cm treatments (− 868 and − 192 kg of OM/cow, respectively).
