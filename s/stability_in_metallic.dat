40|$|The first {{fast breeder}} reactors, {{constructed}} in the 1945 - 1960 time period, used metallic fuels composed of uranium, plutonium, or their alloys. They were chosen because most existing reactor operating experience had been obtained on metallic fuels and because they provided the highest breeding ratios. Difficulties in obtaining adequate dimensional <b>stability</b> <b>in</b> <b>metallic</b> fuel elements under conditions of high fuel burnup led in the 1960 s to the virtual worldwide choice of ceramic fuels. Although ceramic fuels provide lower breeding performance, this objective {{is no longer an}} important consideration in most national programs. Mixed uranium and plutonium dioxide became the ceramic fuel that has received the widest use. The more advanced ceramic fuels, mixed uranium and plutonium carbides and nitrides, continue under development. More recently, metal fuel elements of improved design have joined ceramic fuels in achieving goal burnups of 15 to 20 percent. Low-swelling fuel cladding alloys have also been continuously developed to deal with the unexpected problem of void formation in stainless steels subjected to fast neutron irradiation, a phenomenon first observed in the 1960 s...|$|E

40|$|The {{varying degrees}} of configurational {{disorder}} <b>in</b> <b>metallic</b> glasses are investigated quantitatively by molecular dynamics studies. A parameter, the quasi-nearest atom, is used to characterize the configurational disorder <b>in</b> <b>metallic</b> glasses. Our observations suggest configurational disorder {{play a role in}} structural heterogeneity, plasticity and dynamic relaxations <b>in</b> <b>metallic</b> glasses. The broad configurational disorder regions distribution is the indicator of abundant potential deformation units and relaxations. Plastic flow, as well as relaxation, is believed to start at configurational disorder regions. The width of the shear bands and dynamic relaxations can then be regulated by the degree of configurational disorder regions <b>in</b> <b>metallic</b> glasses.

40|$|One {{considerable}} concern <b>in</b> <b>metallic</b> {{glass is}} enhancing ductility by suppressing catastrophic failure by the instantaneous propagation of shear bands. Compressed nanopillars with alternating CuZr metallic glass and polyisoprene nanolaminates exhibit > 30 % enhancement in plastic flow, {{as compared with}} monolithic glass, without sacrifice of strength. A suppression of stochastic strain burst signature <b>in</b> these <b>metallic</b> glass-polymer composites is reported, which is an undesirable characteristic ubiquitously present <b>in</b> monolithic <b>metallic</b> glass and <b>in</b> <b>metallic</b> glass-metal composites. The intermittent stochastic signature is quantified <b>in</b> each <b>metallic</b> glass-containing nanolaminate system by constructing histograms of burst size distributions and provide theoretical foundation for each behavior. The exceptional mechanical properties emergent in these MG-polymer nanolaminate composites are attributed to the combination of nanometer size-induced shear band suppression <b>in</b> <b>metallic</b> glasses and the damping capability of the polyisoprene layers. close...|$|R

40|$|The {{electronic}} structure inheritance of lanthanide-solvent atoms <b>in</b> lanthanide-based <b>metallic</b> glasses has been proposed. Is a polyamorphism possible <b>in</b> lanthanide-solute <b>metallic</b> glasses? So far, polyamorphic phase transitions <b>in</b> <b>metallic</b> glass containing lanthanide {{have been observed}} only <b>in</b> lanthanide-solvent <b>metallic</b> glasses. Here, a pressure-induced transition between two distinct amorphous states, accompanied by a 7 % volume collapse at ambient pressure, was observed <b>in</b> LaPrAlCu <b>metallic</b> glass, with low lanthanide content, by using in situ X-ray total scattering method. The transformation also indicated by changes in short range and medium range order. Thus, it is proposed that the lanthanide-solute metallic glasses also inherit 4 f electronic transition from pure lanthanide element in polyamorphic transition. This discovery offers a supplement to research on lanthanide-based metallic glasses, which further provides a new perspective of the polyamorphic transformation <b>in</b> <b>metallic</b> glasses containing lanthanide element...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{research}} is the development of high strength, high conductivity copper films. Pure copper is soft and traditional strengthening mechanisms cause substantial decrease in conductivity. To address the challenge, epitaxial nanotwinned copper films are synthesized on HF etched Si (110) substrates. These films show high hardness (~ 2. 8 GPa) due to high density of coherent twin boundaries (CTBs) which effectively block the motion of dislocations similar to grain boundaries (GBs). Resistivity of CTBs is calculated to be an order of magnitude lower than that of GBs. Hence, conductivity of nanotwinned copper is still comparable to that of pure copper. In addition, it is shown that average twin spacing can be controlled by adjusting deposition rate. Analytical studies together with experimental evidence show that nanotwins can improve the strength-to-resistivity ratio significantly in copper. In general, nanocrystalline metals suffer from low ductility. To study plastic deformation via rolling, thick polycrystalline nanotwinned copper foils are sputtered on SiO 2 and then peeled off the substrate. Despite the high strength, room temperature rolling experiments show that nanotwinned copper films exhibit stable plastic flow with no shear localization or fracture even at thickness reduction of over 50 %. Postdeformation studies of microstructure reveals that the plastic deformation is facilitated by the migration of CTBs normal to the twin boundary plane due to the glide of twinning dislocations in the twin plane. X-ray pole figure measurements show insignificant out of plane rotation as a result of 50 % rolling thickness reduction. Thermal stability of nanocrystalline metals is also a concern. Free standing nanotwinned polycrystalline copper films show remarkable thermal stability after annealing at 800 degrees C. The driving force for twin growth is much lower than that for grain coarsening because the energy stored in CTBs is an order of magnitude lower than that of GBs. As a result, the average twin spacing stays below 20 nm after annealing. Such high thermal stability of nanotwins leads to the retention of hardness of 2. 2 GPa. Low energy twin boundary may provide a unique way to achieve both high strength and high temperature thermal <b>stability</b> <b>in</b> certain <b>metallic</b> materials...|$|R
