50|$|Two {{inert gases}} or gas {{mixtures}} are employed. The orifice gas at lower pressure and flow rate forms the plasma arc. The {{pressure of the}} orifice gas is intentionally kept low to avoid weld metal turbulence, but this low pressure {{is not able to}} provide proper shielding of the weld pool. To have suitable shielding protection same or another inert gas is sent through the outer <b>shielding</b> <b>ring</b> of the torch at comparatively higher flow rates. Most of the materials can be welded with argon, helium, argon+hydrogen and argon+helium, as inert gases or gas mixtures. Argon is very commonly used. Helium is preferred where a broad heat input pattern and flatter cover pass is desired without key hole mode weld. A mixture of argon and hydrogen supplies heat energy higher than when only argon is used and thus permits keyhole mode welds in nickel base alloys, copper base alloys and stainless steels.|$|E

40|$|The multi-needle electrospinning {{system is}} a {{convenient}} way to produce fibers with special structures such as core-shell morphologies at a high production rate. In this paper, a specially designed multi-needle electrospinning system is presented. The spinnerets were built-up with an equilateral hexagon array. Each set of 3 needles of the spinnerets were distributed as an equilateral triangle. A coaxial <b>shield</b> <b>ring</b> was used to create an approximate uniform electric field near {{the tips of the}} needles and to restrict the collection area. The simulation results also show that the outside needles can help to create a more uniform electric field near the inside tips of the needles and restrict the path of the inside jets, which works almost the same as the additional <b>shield</b> <b>ring.</b> Based on the simulation results, several multi-needle systems were tested. A 7 cm diameter <b>shield</b> <b>ring</b> was used in a 7 needle system, a 9 cm diameter <b>shield</b> <b>ring</b> was used in a 19 needle system and a 10. 5 cm diameter <b>shield</b> <b>ring</b> was used in a 37 needle system. Polyethylene Oxide (PEO) aqueous solution was used as the test solution in experiments. The electrospinning results demonstrated that the use of multi-needle spinnerets is robust and that uniform nanofibers can be produced. The more needles used, the smaller the mean fiber diameter for larger mean electric field strengths. These distributions of needles show the scale up possibility of special structure electrospun nanofiber manufacturing.

40|$|IGLO {{calculations}} {{of the magnetic}} susceptibility tensors {{as well as of}} the 13 C and 'H shielding tensors areperformed and analyzed for benzene (l), the hypothetical cyclohexatriene (2) with alternating single and double bonds,some benzene isomers like fulvene (3), and other related molecules, including ethylene (8), the two 1, 3 -butadienes (9,lo), and eight hexatrienes (11 - 18). The susceptibilities of the noncyclic polyenes as well as the benzene isomers 4 and 5 are rather well described by an increment system both for the in-plane and out-of-plane components, that of benzeneonly for the in-plane component, while for the out-of-plane component there is an additional shielding of 42 ppm cgs,which is reduced to 33 ppm cgs in cyclohexatriene. The other two molecules of this study with a somewhat enhancedout-of-plane susceptibility are fulvene (13 ppm cgs) and cyclopentadiene (17 ppm cgs). Evidence is accumulated thatthe increased susceptibility in benzene comes from the n-electron system and is an indication of a nearly-free circularcurrent in the n-system of benzene. This becomes particularly manifest if one uses the center of the molecule as a gaugeorigin for the zz-component of the shielding due to the occupied PMOS. For this gauge the shielding is almost entirelydiamagnetic, as required for a free current. In cyclohexatriene this current is somewhat attenuated, as seen from largerparamagnetic contributions. The increased susceptibilities in fulvene and cyclopentadiene are also due to the x-system,though no genuine ring current effects can be detected. In the case of the 1 H shielding a different mechanism isresponsible for the deshielding in ethylene (and polyenes) with respect to methane (or paraffins) and for the extradeshielding in benzene relative to ethylene. The latter is due to the occupied n-MOs and related to the ring current. It is calculated to be - 5 ppm in the out-of-plane component, but it is reduced to less than 2 ppm in the isotropic <b>shielding.</b> <b>Ring</b> current effects are not detectable in any other molecules of this study, but in complementary investigations ofother Huckel or anti-Huckel annulenes. The 13 C shift tensors show a very complicated pattern with large variationsalready between the isomeric hexatrienes, which are hard to interpret within an increment system. While the shifttensors in fulvene don't differ too much from what one expects for carbon atoms in a similar bonding situation, bis-(methy 1 ene) cyclobutene and tris(methy 1 ene) cyclopropane are affected by strong ring strain effects. Benzene differsfrom polyenes mainly in a shielding of the out-of-plane component that is unusually strong for a CH carbon in anunsaturated system. Conclusions on a ring current effect would be premature...|$|E

The {{bearing support}} {{breakage}} of screw coal powder conveyor in power plant boiler went through four stages: axial displacement of shaft sleeve, shaft sleeve wearing by <b>shield</b> <b>ring</b> and by bearing, and {{the wearing of}} skeleton seal rings and dustproof felts by shaft sleeve.

40|$|The {{large number}} of bolts and screws that {{attached}} to the subway <b>shield</b> <b>ring</b> plates, along with the great amount of accessories of metal stents and electrical equipments mounted on the tunnel walls, make the laser point cloud data include lots of non-tunnel section points (hereinafter referred to as non-points), therefore affecting the accuracy for modeling and deformation monitoring.

The original laser point cloud data was firstly projected onto a horizontal plane, and a searching algorithm was given to extract the edging points of both sides, which were used further to fit the tunnel central axis. Along the axis the point cloud was segmented regionally, and then fitted as smooth elliptic cylindrical surface by means of iteration. This processing enabled the automatic filtering of those inner wall non-points. Experiments of two groups showed coincident results, that the elliptic cylindrical model based method could effectively filter out the non-points, and meet the accuracy requirements for subway deformation monitoring.

A {{portable}} quantitative {{model of}} the geospace electromagnetic structure {{is the foundation of}} many researches in the area of space plasma physics. Work described in this dissertation uses both the analytical and numerical approaches to bring the existing models several steps closer to the ultimate model. An analytical model is developed to simulate the magnetic effect of the magnetopause current by solving the Laplace equation in a complex geometry. The procedure involves the minimization of an integral quantity to determine the coefficients of a harmonic expansion for the magnetic scalar potential of the magnetopause field. This procedure can shield any kind of interior magnetic field, or open the closed magnetosphere up with an arbitrary normal component distribution over the magnetopause. The Toffoletto and Hill 1993 open magnetosphere model is improved by adding a new physical module of the <b>shielded</b> <b>ring</b> current field, and modifying its additional tail field to eliminate the shortcomings that are evident. The new improved version has a better representation of the magnetic field in the inner magnetosphere. A numerical model for the electric potential on closed field lines is developed by extending the polar-cap potential into the low-latitude ionosphere using a finite element method. This significantly enhances the model's capability. By mapping the electric potential into the magnetosphere, the associated magnetospheric plasma convection can be examined to assess the reasonability of the normal component distribution on the magnetopause...|$|R
