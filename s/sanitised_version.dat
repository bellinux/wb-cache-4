40|$|Women Writing Independence, Partition and Communal Violence {{explores the}} {{important}} role literature has played in interrogating and supplementing historical accounts of women's experiences of Independence and Partition. It analyses how fiction highlights recurrent absences and inconsistencies in most historical accounts {{with regard to the}} significance of 1947 to women. Chapter One, Representing Partition, considers the descriptions of women's lives in the mid- 1940 s in historical texts, newspaper accounts and autobiographies. It emphasises how the effects of events upon women have often been elided or understated. Chapter Two, Gestures of Defiance and Subversion, focuses on Attia Hosain's Sunlight on a Broken Column (1961) and Anita Desai's Clear Light of Day (1980). It examines their portrayal of women's status in Indian society pre and post- 1947 and investigates whether national freedom was matched by equal progress in the rights of women. Chapter Three, Woman as Sign, concentrates on Jyotirmoyee Devi's The River Churning (1967) and Bapsi Sidhwa's Cracking India (1988). It explores how Devi and Sidhwa delineate the repercussions for women of the brutalities of 1946 - 47. It contends that these novels' particular strengths lie in their revelations of women's lives after assault/abduction and of their participation in social work. Chapter Four, Learningfrom Past Lives, analyses Manju Kapur's Difficult Daughters (1998) and Shauna Singh Baldwin's What the Body Remembers (1999). It scrutinises how the texts present the transmission of memories across generations and how family or community recollections can unsettle selective and <b>sanitised</b> <b>versions</b> of history. This thesis underlines the vital function of literature in depicting the direct impact of this cataclysm upon women in 1947 and in the decades thereafter. It argues that, while such fiction is not the 'only witness' to women's experiences of Independence and Partition, it remains the most 'eloquent'EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|The {{nineteenth century}} {{witnessed}} {{the consolidation of}} a triadic model of class {{with those in the}} middle, especially the educated professional classes, assuming much greater power in the social and political arena. With that power came the ability to be able to shape the world, including sports, in their own image and in the latter stages of the century traditional working class sports such as pedestrianism were superseded by the rationalised, standardised and <b>sanitised</b> <b>versions</b> of athletics preferred by the middle classes. The Amateur Athletic Association (AAA), formed in 1880, centralised the organisation of track and field athletics, established common written rules for events, standardised the dimensions for tracks and equipment, and framed regulations so as to enforce the doctrine of amateurism, particularly the abhorrence of professionalism and gambling. So effective was this programme of rationalisation that professional pedestrianism, a vibrant and widespread working class sport for over two hundred years, had almost disappeared by the time the final blow was delivered with the 1906 Street Betting Act which enacted that anyone loitering in public places for the purpose of bookmaking, betting or wagering should be liable to summary conviction. For many pedestrians the sport had traditionally provided a career path from competitor to trainer and official but the growing influence of amateurs from the 1860 s and the institutionalisation of the sport under middle class control from 1880 created changes, some more subtle than others, {{in the nature of the}} working environment for the experienced ‘ped’. This chapter uses the life course of one pedestrian exponent, Harry Andrews, as an exemplar of how such men adapted their working lives to accommodate the shifting nature of the sporting milieu. Andrews (1831 / 3 – 1885), who ran his first race in 1854 and was still competing over twenty years later, was typical of the pedestrians of his day. Although not the most prominent competitor of the period he had a lasting association with the sport and found ways to continue working within the emergent amateur athletics scene. While recognising that the use of a biography, especially of a man like Andrews who lacked the political and social status to effect change, only provides a narrative of one man’s life in one location it can, and does, reinforce the impact that national modifications in sporting structures could have on an individual and the way in which they responded. Harry was not the only pedestrian faced with these challenges and the indications are that others adopted similar strategies although the hidden histories of many of these working-class men make confirmation difficult and reinforce the need for further research, particularly using a prosopographical methodology (Oldfield, 2011), into those who were directly affected by the standardisation of sport by the middle classes. ...|$|R
40|$|Sir Llewellyn Woodward’s {{official}} diplomatic history, though part of Britain’s Second World War official histories, had a {{very different}} history {{from the rest of}} the series. Commissioned originally during the war as confidential internal histories intended to help future policymakers learn from the wartime past, from 1946 onwards the official histories were targeted through publication at a wider academic and public audience outside Whitehall. The American audience proved a high priority. Unlike other volumes, in 1950 Woodward’s diplomatic history, though still in preparation, was subjected to a prime ministerial ban on publication because of infringements of the rules concerning official histories. Completed in 1956, the five-volume official history was not published until the 1970 s, although a <b>sanitised</b> one-volume <b>version</b> was cleared for publication in 1962. Prior to publication Woodward’s full history was available for confidential use by policymakers, but in reality remained locked away in the departmental cupboard, excepting occasional access by politicians like Lord Avon writing their memoirs. Highlighting government efforts to manage the presentation of Britain’s wartime past as well as the difficulties of integrating history into the policymaking process, this study offers illuminating insights into Woodward’s experience of writing official history. In particular, as an academic historian based at Oxford and then Princeton’s Institute for Advanced Study, his work as an official historian required him constantly to balance professional standards and reputation against government demands and pressures...|$|R
40|$|Alexandre Dumas père {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{prolific}} and popular French writers of all times; he wrote over 1, 200 volumes comprising of 250 plays, novels and travelogues, and was among the first writers in France to use the roman feuilleton (serialised novel). Without ever attaining the literary stature of the giants of his day like Hugo, Balzac, Stendhal, Flaubert, and Zola, he was, nevertheless, the most flamboyant and the most widely read of them all. All his writings brought him great success and popularity, and his exuberant imagination was equalled by no one except perhaps by Victor Hugo. He is especially known for his novels Le Comte de Monte Cristo, Les Trois Mousquetaires and La Reine Margot which have all been translated in various languages, made into films, adapted and serialised for television. Although his novels are placed in Hachette’s “bibliothèque verte” for young adolescents, these are only the <b>sanitised</b> or expurgated <b>versions</b> of his novels. With their sudden plot developments and high entertainment value, they represent the perfect examples of the typical action-packed swashbuckling novels, filled with swordfights, beautiful women, heroic men, cloak and dagger episodes and narrow escapes. Yet, there is another dimension to his writings: no other French writer of the 19 th century has depicted scenes of political intrigues, vengeance, perversion, graphic eroticism, poisonings, torture, executions and beheadings quite like him. Due to his prolific output, questions concerning his collaboration with other writers such as Auguste Maquet have often been raised, and critics have judged his work harshly. Recently, however, he seems to have gained favour with the establishment and French critics alike, especially since the French President Jacques Chirac had his body exhumed and transported to the Panthéon in Paris, in 2002, and where he is now enshrined alongside such illustrious authors like Victor Hugo and Émile Zola...|$|R

The article provides a reflexive account of the struggles of analysing Internet and interview data in relation to sustainable tourism via the dominant version of Foucauldian Discourse Analysis familiar to many qualitative/critical psychologists. Turning to an account of Foucault’s later work on ethics, this article presents an alternative approach to Foucauldian Discourse Analysis that adopts a hybrid reading of Foucault’s work on power, knowledge, and ethics. Drawing on Foucault’s four precepts helps us explore the ways individuals “cultivate the self as an ethical subject,” and interview data are presented to highlight the ways such an approach can enrich analysis. It is concluded that while presenting issues surrounding understandings of structure and agency, such an approach did offer a pragmatic solution to an ethical question and may indeed be useful in a range of other areas...|$|E

40|$|David Lowenthal has {{observed}} that in today's museums, "nothing seems too horrendous to commemorate" (Lowenthal 1985). Yet museums frequently portray a <b>sanitised</b> <b>version</b> of warfare. The twentieth century saw {{the development of}} commemorative traditions: customs and narratives by which individuals, groups and nations remember, commemorate and attempt to resolve memories of the traumatic experience that is war. These conventions often also govern museum interpretation of war. This dissertation examines the representation of war in two very different museums: Britain's national Imperial War Museum, and the regional In Flanders Fields Museum at Ypres, Belgium. The Imperial War Museum tends to follow established commemorative traditions. In its recently-opened Holocaust exhibition, however, it has made use of a different style of commemoration. In Flanders Fields has consciously attempted to avoid traditional forms of commemoration, which {{could be seen as}} glamorising or sanitising war.

What transpired was an illuminating debate, eliciting responses from around the globe about learning in practice, mentors, and student support that lasted over 3 h. More importantly, the Twitter chat also included qualified nurses and mentors, listening and responding in real time, offering thoughts and solutions to how support and mentoring could be improved. This was in contrast to how students, locally, currently use a paper based questionnaire to give feedback in isolation.

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2008. Hegemonic masculinity (HM) is {{considered}} by many boys and men to be the "gold standard" of masculinity to which they are expected to conform (Connell & Messerschmidt, 2005). However, many boys feel that they fall short of this standard and are thus challenged to negotiate their sense of masculinity through positioning themselves in relation to masculine standards in various ways (Wetherell & Edley, 1999). This research therefore aims to explore the process of subject positioning in relation to HM and, if it occurs, the process of successfully aligning masculine identity with alternative (non-hegemonic) forms of masculinity. Eight late adolescent boys from rural KwaZulu-Natal were interviewed, and the data were qualitatively analysed by focussing on the boys' narratives used to describe masculinity and how they position themselves in relation to the various norms of masculinity. The results indicate that these boys did not show signs of having non-hegemonic masculinities. However, all boys reframed HM into a new discourse still based on the acceptance of the hegemonic domination over women and femininity (including less masculine boys), while disavowing practices relating to alcohol use, crime and risky sexual practices. This discourse represented a <b>sanitised</b> <b>version</b> of HM. It was suggested that boys maintain these multiple versions of masculinity in parallel, and use psychological splitting to maintain them. Soccer emerged as serving an important function for the creation and maintenance of these sanitised masculinities...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2009. While debates rage {{over the}} {{relevance}} and worth of school history, {{history has been}} one of the five compulsory subjects up to Ordinary Level in Zimbabwe. However, far away from the corridors of power, it is essential that research be conducted on what school history is for and what represents that which the learner of school history acquires through at least eleven years of school history studies in Zimbabwe. Using the concept of historical literacy as its framework, this study is an analysis of three Ordinary Level history textbooks in Zimbabwe to explore how historical literacy manifests itself in Zimbabwean school history textbooks. In a context of increased government concern over what and how school history should be taught, the study explains how the textbooks that were produced more than ten years ago can still be turned into resources for the propagation of patriotic history, which emerged in the last decade. While conceptualisations of historical literacy continue, I argue for multiple historical literacies, that is, historical literacy which actually takes different forms in different times, spaces and contexts. Thus, what is represented as historical literacy in Zimbabwean history textbooks is not necessarily what historical literacy is elsewhere. This research is a qualitative textual analysis which was conducted in an interpretivist paradigm. I employed historical discourse analysis, question analysis and visual analysis as the analysis methods. The analysis was conducted through an instrument created from the benchmarks of the conceptual framework. The study concluded that despite attempt to push for an activitybased curriculum, historical knowledge, especially the nationalist narrative, is still the dominant benchmark of historical literacy in Zimbabwean textbooks. As a result, the current textbooks can be used, not only for a state <b>sanitised</b> <b>version</b> of historical literacy, but also a version of political literacy...|$|E
40|$|Donald Card (1928 –) is {{a former}} {{policeman}} in South Africa who {{became the subject of}} international media attention on 21 September 2004. In a highly publicised and symbolic ceremony of reconciliation inaugurating the Nelson Mandela Centre of Memory Project, he handed back to Mandela two notebooks containing 78 hitherto unknown letters written by Mandela on Robben Island. A starkly contrasting image of Card as a torturer had, however, come to light during the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) hearings in the Eastern Cape in 1996 and 1997. This article begins by making a case for a direct connection between these two events. We argue that the <b>sanitised</b> <b>version</b> of his life history in recent scholarship traces back to his own attempts to defend his reputation from these allegations of torture and that the Mandela notebooks served both to obscure these allegations and provide Card with a respectable, even heroic, biography. We then present our alternative version of his life history. Drawing on Robert Morrell’s periodisation of masculinities in southern Africa, we read the story of Card’s life in early–mid-twentieth century South Africa in terms of changing masculine identities, each strongly associated with violence: first the ‘oppositional’ masculinity of a child growing up in an abusive patriarchal Irish settler family, second the ‘settler’ masculinity of an athletic teenager at a white school in the former Transkei, and third his ‘hegemonic’ white South African masculine identity defined in opposition to emergent black masculinities into which he was initiated as a young adult during four months of intensive training at a police college in Pretoria. It is in this context, along with extensive new independently acquired oral and documentary evidence of his human rights abuses in East London in the 1950 s and the early 1960 s, that we situate the TRC testimonies about Card’s torture between 1962 and 1964.

40|$|The {{status quo}} in Australia is shifting, writes George Williams WHEN it comes to freedom of speech we {{are in danger of}} losing our sense of perspective, as well as our sense of humour. The latest {{proposal}} from Attorney-General Philip Ruddock is to ban books that praise terrorism and to censor TV shows like Big Brother. As Australians, we take freedom of speech for granted. It is one of the bedrocks upon which our democracy is built, an assumption that underpins our law and politics. Yet far from being liberal about what we can say, the law already prohibits may things that are the subject of public debate in other nations. We cannot hear on the radio, and are unable to buy, the most popular musical work of political satire in Australia from the past decade. We even now have laws that {{make it more difficult to}} express an unpopular opinion or to hold government to account. People can find themselves in jail for what they say and not just for what they do. Over the past decade there have been clear signals that when it comes to speech Australians are not nearly as free as we like to think. Our democracy depends upon voters being able to speak freely during elections. We must be able to criticise policies, parties and candidates without fear of prosecution and tell others about how the electoral process works. But in 1996 Albert Langer was jailed for advocating a formal, valid vote. Langer, a political agitator, described John Howard and Paul Keating as “Tweedledum and Tweedledee” and urged voters to put them and their parties equal last on the ballot paper. The Commonwealth Electoral Act specifically allowed for such a vote. But it also made it a crime to advocate the vote, something that Langer did with great gusto. About 46, 000 people voted in 1996 using the Langer method, an increase of 500 per cent from 1993. Langer was prosecuted. An appeal to the High Court failed and he was sent to jail for ten weeks for telling people about a method of voting that was perfectly legal. Amnesty International declared him to be the “first prisoner of conscience in the country for over 20 years”. The law has since been changed to make such a vote informal - it will no longer count. Australia is also plagued with undue censorship, even about matters of obvious political importance. In 1997, Pauline Pantsdown released her hit song Backdoor Man, a parody of One Nation Party founder Pauline Hanson, then nearing the height of her fame and political influence. The song, a ridiculous compilation of Hanson’s own words, contained the famous lines: “I’m a backdoor man. I’m homosexual. I’m proud of it... I’m a backdoor man for the Ku Klux Klan with a very horrendous plan. I’m a very caring potato... Please explain. ” It was a huge hit on youth radio network Triple J, where it was requested so often that it leapt to No 5 on the hottest 100 list of that year. Six days after Triple J began playing Backdoor Man Hanson sought and gained a court injunction, under defamation law, that made it illegal to play the song. The injunction has never been lifted, and though it only applies to the ABC, other radio stations do not play the song. When I tried to buy Backdoor Man to play to my students, I was told by the store that it did not stock it because it was illegal to sell. In fact, I found out that the song had never been released as a single because of how quickly it was banned. It is listed in, but the track is not actually contained on, Triple J’s hottest 100 for 1997. This would not occur in New Zealand, the US, Canada or Britain, which, unlike Australia, have protected freedom of speech in a bill or charter of rights. My next two examples fall after September 11. We have gained new laws that were unthinkable prior to the attack. One of those laws allows ASIO to detain Australian citizens for questioning for up to a week even when they are not suspected of any crime. While detained, a person can be compelled to reveal information about family members, sources or anything else they may know, upon pain of five years’ jail. The ASIO detention regime makes it an offence to disclose “operational information” about a person’s detention within two years of that person being detained. Operational information is defined very widely to include information that ASIO “has or had” or “an operational capability, method or plan” of ASIO’s. Revealing such information, even the mere fact that someone was detained, can incur up to five years’ imprisonment. There are no exceptions for cases of fair reporting, such as a story revealing that ASIO has abused its powers or mistreated (or even tortured) detainees. If someone is mistreated while being detained, we may have to wait at least two years to find this out. Combined with the secrecy that surrounds so many of our new terror laws, and the fact that it is a crime to even identify an ASIO officer, this is a grave threat to government accountability. Then there is the sedition law passed in Australia late last year. This law criminalises people for what they say if, among other things, they urge by force or violence the overthrow of the constitution or the government. The penalty is jail for up to seven years. Sedition had, at least until recently, been regarded as a discredited offence because of its use in Australia and other nations against political oppositions. Those charged with sedition include Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela and even Peter Lalor after the 1854 Eureka Stockade. To define terrorism is notoriously hard, and our law provides no leeway for why someone has committed violence or damaged property. Former South African leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner Mandela was called a terrorist by many during his fight against the apartheid regime. He would certainly have been classified as such under Australia’s new laws. Sedition has been re-enacted in a form that suggests that it is an important part of the government’s war on terror. While it has been “modernised”, it provides few exceptions. There is no clear protection for academic works or even comedy or satire. Black humour, such as on ABC TV’s The Chaser’s War on Everything, that uses the words or an image of Osama bin Laden has the potential to become a criminal offence. Attorney-General Philip Ruddock has said he will not use the sedition law in such circumstances. But there is no guarantee about how this or future governments will apply the law, and this also neglects the larger problem of self-censorship. Sedition and other laws have an inevitable chilling effect on what we say. Artists and commentators are now less likely to use robust critical speech about the war on terror or other sensitive topics due to concern they may breach the law. When people do not have free on-the-spot legal advice, they may not speak for fear of the consequences. Exactly how the new sedition law will make Australians safer from terrorism has not been made clear. Indeed, there is a risk that the law will further ostracise members of those communities that feel, rightly or wrongly, that they are already the target of government action. There is also the potential that the law will push speech underground that promotes political violence rather than enabling it to be contested in public debate. Unfortunately, banning speech can even make the ideas it embodies more popular to some. These examples, among many others, demonstrate how fragile freedom of speech is in Australia. They expose how we assume, rather than actually protect, freedom of speech. The changes since September 11 are especially troubling. To a greater extent even than nations such as Britain and the US, our law has come to reflect the maxim of President George Bush that “you’re either with us or against us”. Unlike Australia, those nations protect free speech through a clear statement of law. The US has its 1791 constitutional Bill of Rights; Britain has an act of Parliament, the 1998 Human Rights Act. In Australia, the vulnerability of freedom of speech and other rights, such as to vote and freedom of association, has led to renewed calls for a rights bill or charter. While John Howard has said that this will never occur under his watch, change is afoot. The ACT was the first to move, with its Human Rights Act passed in 2004. Victoria has followed, with its Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities enacted just this week. Tasmania has also begun an inquiry into a charter and Western Australia may not be far behind. These new laws are ordinary acts of parliament that can be changed but cannot bind the federal government. Nonetheless, they provide better protection than is now the case for freedom of speech. They show that the {{status quo in}} Australia is shifting. In the meantime, though, there is less space for comment by the critical writer or thinker. Such a person may see shades of grey rather than black and white, or right and wrong. If Philip Ruddock gets his way there may soon be more books that we cannot buy. TV shows like Big Brother may also only be able to provide more <b>sanitised</b> <b>version</b> of reality.
