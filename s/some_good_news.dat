5|$|In {{its first}} bowl {{appearance}} since 2007, Michigan traveled to Jacksonville {{to play the}} Mississippi State Bulldogs in the Gator Bowl. This game was the first meeting between the two schools, and the first game against a Big Ten opponent for Mississippi State since 1980. Michigan entered the game in search of its 20th total bowl victory, and played an SEC opponent for the 30th time in school history. Two days before the game, Michigan learned that backup QB Tate Forcier was declared academically ineligible and would {{not participate in the}} Gator Bowl. In response, Michigan named freshman Devin Gardner the backup QB to Denard Robinson. The team did, however, receive <b>some</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> during the week leading up to the game, as WR Martavious Odoms was cleared to play in his first game since October 9 against Michigan State, during which he suffered a broken foot.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, Jenner {{encountered}} {{a group of}} men from the Glanton Exclusive Brethren {{standing in front of the}} National Australia Bank on Collins Street. One of the men was engaging in open-air preaching. Jenner interrupted the man to say that he would listen to the man's good news provided that he was allowed to share <b>some</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> first. The man agreed, so Jenner taught the group of Brethren how to play craps there on the pavement. One of the Brethren invited Jenner into his home for tea and told him about the gospel. Jenner converted to Christianity and, when he went home, told Jessie that she was a sinner bound for hell and therefore in need of salvation. According to Wilson's biography of Jenner, Jessie thought that Jenner had become manic or insane. They had a young daughter named Ann by this point and Jenner was gambling so much that he was not providing for his family. For both of these reasons, Jessie left Jenner and moved to Corowa to work on a farm, taking Ann with her. She said that she would return only when Jenner regained his sanity. On several occasions, he aggressively told Jessie's brothers that they needed to become Christians, which angered them. On one of these occasions, their conversation became physical and they began punching each other. The brothers rejected Jenner and were never reconciled to him. He wrote to his family back in England informing them of his conversion and asking them to become Christians too, but he received no reply.|$|E

2500|$|The Titans {{were also}} {{the first team to}} play in the Regular season, when they played the Steelers on September 10. Ringer was used to return kicks. In the 10-13 {{overtime}} loss, Ringer had 3 Kick Returns, a 19 yard average, including a long of 21 yards. He also played on special teams, and had one tackle. Ringer was again used as a kick returner, this time in a 31-34 loss to the Houston Texans. Ringer had 6 returns for a 20 yard average, with a long of 25, and no touchdowns. He also played on special teams, but had no tackles. In a 17-24 week 3 loss to the New York Jets, Ringer was benched as the kick returner, and, while active, did not play in the game. Ringer's kick return replacement, Ryan Mouton, had two fumbles during returns. Despite this, Titan's coach Jeff Fischer stood behind his decision to bench Ringer. In a 37-17 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars, Ringer was again active, but only played as a reserve on special teams. Ringer was one of three Titans who did not register a stat. The Titans, who last year had 13 wins, only three losses, started the season out zero wins four losses. They had their fifth loss of the season in a 31-9 loss to the Colts, a game in which Ringer was once again active, but only played special teams, not registering a stat. Ringer was one of two Titans that did not record an offensive stat. In a record-breaking 59-0 loss to the New England Patriots, Ringer had his first NFL carries, having 7 carries for 47 yards (6.7 average), including a 32 yard run, for no touchdowns, all amounting in Garbage time. The Titans finished the game with negative 7 passing yards as their record moved to 0 wins 6 losses, putting them in a tie for the worst record in the NFL alongside the St. Louis Rams and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Despite his performance in the loss, head coach Jeff Fisher said that Chris Johnson and LenDale White will continue to get the majority of the carries. [...] "There's not enough balls to go around. I wouldn't hesitate to put Ringer in if there's an issue," [...] Fisher said. During a practice on October 28, 2009, Ringer injured his back and had to be carted off in an ambulance. Fisher said of the injury [...] "It could be any number of things and it would be unfair for me to speculate right now. He is obviously in some pain." [...] The call to the hospital was initially phoned to treat a potentially [...] "traumatic" [...] injury, but tests have revealed that the injury is [...] "not considered serious". After spending a night with back problems, Ringer was released from the hospital early morning on October 29. Ringer's expected to miss a few weeks, as he's listed on the injury report with a back injury. Fisher commented on the injury, [...] "We got <b>some</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> on Javon. He obviously didn’t practice today, but he’s going to be OK. We were really concerned about it. We feared the worst and we got good results," [...] but would not elaborate as to {{the full extent of the}} injury. In a 30-13 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars, Ringer was declared inactive before the game, and did not play. It was however, the Titans first victory of the season. In week 9, Ringer was again inactive and did not play. In week 10, Ringer was listed as questionable, but was declared inactive, and did not play. In a 20-17 win against the Houston Texans, Ringer was inactive, and did not play. In 20-17 win against the Arizona Cardinals, Ringer was listed as the #2 running back. He had one yard on one carry. Ringer played because LenDale White, the team's usual #2 Running back, was benched due to being late to a team meeting. Ringer was then inactive for the rest of the season. Ringer finished the season with 8 attempts for 48 yards, playing in 7 games.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} was {{to better understand the}} concept of celebratory support. This form of support is different from comforting messages and most other forms of social support, which typically focus on trying to help people who are feeling bad to feel better; celebratory support aims to enhance the already positive feelings of someone who has received <b>some</b> kind of <b>good</b> <b>news.</b> In order to enhance understanding of this unique form of support, this dissertation (a) reviewed the literature relevant to this form of support, (b) presented detailed conceptualization of celebratory support, and (c) described four different types of 2 ̆ 2 <b>good</b> <b>news</b> 2 ̆ 2 that often merit a celebratory response. Two studies were presented in this dissertation. Study 1 identified effective features of general celebratory support messages as well as some important contextual variations in better and worse forms of these message features. Study 2 identified effective features of context-specific celebratory support messages. Additionally, both studies also were able to hypothesis and test various mechanisms by which each set of features “work”. ...|$|R

Yet, social, cultural, and institutional arrangements frame how these interests see these opportunities, creating a barrier to mixed-motive analyses. In this article, the authors use an institutional perspective to analyze how the economics versus environment debate emerges from institutions as presently structured. They present an analysis of its present framing based on three aspects of institutions—regulative, normative, and cognitive—and consider the prescriptive implications they expose at the managerial and organizational level of action.
