Objective: Our purpose was {{to find out if}} a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) specific for Leishmania organisms might be more sensitive than the traditional diagnostic techniques, thereby decreasing the number of false-negative diagnoses. Methods: In a prospective study, <b>smear,</b> <b>culture,</b> and histopathology of skin biopsy specimens from 46 patients with a possible diagnosis of CL were compared with PCR specific for Leishmania. In addition, the Montenegro test as a measure Of Cellular immunity against the Leishmania parasite was performed. Proven CL was defined as a case in which at least 1 of the 3 traditional tests showed the presence of Leishmania parasites. Results: Of Our 46 patients, 22 had leishmaniasis. Of the traditional tests, Culture was the most sensitive but there were no Statistically significant differences between the sensitivities of the various tests. PCR results were positive in all cases of proven leishmaniasis. Moreover, 3 patients with the clinical diagnosis of CL and negative findings on traditional tests had positive PCR results.

40|$|Background: Bone {{and joint}} {{tuberculosis}} (BJTB) constitutes about 10 – 20 % of the extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) cases in China. The GenoType MTBDRplus assay (MTBDR) has {{been endorsed by}} the World Health Organization (WHO) for the diagnosis of pulmonary TB (PTB), while the Xpert MTB/RIF assay (Xpert) has also been endorsed by the WHO for the diagnosis of both PTB and EPTB. The diagnostic utility of these two techniques for BJTB was investigated prospectively. Methods: Sixty pus specimens were obtained from orthopedic patients. <b>Smear,</b> <b>culture,</b> Xpert, and MTBDR assays were performed for each specimen, and MGIT 960 -based drug susceptibility testing (DST) was conducted {{for all of the}} isolates recovered. The diagnostic efficiency of Xpert and MTBDR was evaluated on the basis of bacteriological examination and the composite reference standard (CRS). Results: Fifty of the 60 patients were considered to have BJTB according to the CRS. The sensitivities of <b>smear,</b> <b>culture,</b> Xpert, and MTBDR were 26 % (13 / 50), 48 % (24 / 50), 82 % (41 / 50), and 72 % (36 / 50) respectively, while the specificities of all of the tests were 100 % (10 / 10). Xpert was 100 % concordant with MGIT 960 -based DST for the detection of rifampicin resistance. MTBDR had a sensitivity of 83. 3 % and a specificity of 100 % for the detection of rifampicin resistance and a sensitivity of 85. 7 % and specificity of 100 % for the detection of isoniazid resistance. Conclusion: With their high sensitivities, short turnaround times, and ability to diagnose TB and detect drug resistance simultaneously, both Xpert and MTBDR are feasible as diagnostic tools for BJTB in clinical practice...|$|E

Aims: to determine the time to sputum <b>smear</b> and <b>culture</b> conversion following initiation of DOts treatment and study {{the factors that influence}} it. Methods: A prospective study was undertaken at a tertiary care teaching hospital in Mumbai over a one year period on a cohort of 71 sputum smear positive patients on Category I DOts treatment. Patients were followed up weekly for upto 20 weeks or until they underwent <b>smear</b> and <b>culture</b> conversion whichever was earlier. At each follow up, specimens were collected and processed for microscopy and culture using standard protocol. Results: 60 / 71 [84. 55 %] patients completed the study. 56 / 60 [93. 3 %] patients underwent sputum <b>smear</b> and <b>culture</b> conversion. the median time to <b>smear</b> and <b>culture</b> conversion was end of 5 th week [day 35] and 6 weeks [day 45] respectively. univariate and stepwise regression analysis showed that patients who had cavitatory disease, high pretreatment smear grade and a past history of tuberculosis were more likely to undergo delayed or non-conversion [P < 0. 05]. Conclusion: the time to sputum <b>smear</b> and <b>culture</b> conversion under DOts is similar to previous antituberculosis regimens. since viable bacilli continue to be expelled for upto two months, infection control measures should be maintained for such time.

40|$|A novel, robust, reproducible, and {{multipurpose}} universal sample processing (USP) {{methodology for}} highly sensitive <b>smear</b> microscopy, <b>culturing</b> on {{solid and liquid}} media, and inhibition-free PCR which is suitable for the laboratory diagnosis of both pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis (TB) has been developed. This method exploits the chaotropic properties of guanidinium hydrochloride for sample processing and involves incubating the specimen with USP solution, concentrating bacilli by centrifugation, and using the processed specimen for <b>smear</b> microscopy, <b>culture,</b> and PCR. The detection limit for acid-fast bacilli in spiked sputum by smear microscopy is approximately 300 bacilli per ml of specimen. USP solution-treated specimens are fully compatible with culturing on solid and liquid media.

Furthermore, the USP method is also compatible with <b>smear</b> microscopy, <b>culture,</b> and PCR of mycobacteria other than tubercle bacilli. In summary, the USP method provides <b>smear</b> microscopy, <b>culture,</b> and nucleic acid amplification technologies with a single sample-processing platform and, {{to the best of}} our knowledge, is the only method of its kind described to date.

Prevalence of <b>smear,</b> <b>culture,</b> and bacteriologically positive PTB was highest amongst men aged 55 - 64 years.
