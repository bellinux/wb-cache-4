40|$|The <b>static</b> <b>volumetric</b> <b>method,</b> {{described}} in ISO 6144 : 2001, {{is a common}} tool to generate primary reference gas mixtures. As it is a manual and bulky system it was aimed at developing an automatic and more compact device resulting in a prototype of an automatic <b>static</b> <b>volumetric</b> <b>method.</b> Based on the injection of a pure compound {{by means of a}} loop instead of a syringe and housed in a portable 19 ” rack it fits for both laboratory use and field measurements. The generation of the gas mixture is controlled by computer running software elaborated during the construction and testing period. The most crucial point, the evaluation of the loop volumes, was solved developing two techniques allowing traceability to SI units. So far gas mixtures of nitrogen monoxide in nitrogen in the range 10 - 9 mol/mol and carbon monoxide in air in the range 10 - 6 mol/mol have been generated and the uncertainties of the gas mixtures were calculated. Comparisons to other calibration techniques like dynamic volumetric method (NO), permeation (NO 2) and direct sampling of primary reference material (CO) confirmed the differences of the methods within their uncertainties.

40|$|This {{document}} summarises {{the findings}} of an external independent review of the storage plan for the proposed Peterhead Carbon Capture and Storage project which aims to store up to 20 million tonnes (Mt) of CO 2 {{within the framework of}} the European Directive on the geological storage of CO 2. The Peterhead Carbon Capture and Storage Project proposes to capture carbon dioxide (CO 2) from an existing gas-fired power-station at Peterhead and to store this in geological strata at a depth of around 2600 m beneath the outer Moray Firth. The plan is to store 10 - 15 Mt of CO 2 over a ten to fifteen-year period commencing around 2020, but the site is being qualified for 20 Mt to allow for potential extension of the injection period. Storage will utilise the depleted Goldeneye gas condensate field with the Captain Sandstone reservoir as the primary storage container. The Storage Site covers some 70 km 2, and comprises the Captain Sandstone and underlying strata of the Cromer Knoll Group, bounded by a polygon some 2 to 3 km outside of the original Goldeneye oil-water contact. The Storage Complex is larger, around 154 km 2, bounded some 2 to 7 km outside of the original oil-water contact, and extending upwards to the top of the Dornoch Mudstone at a depth of more than 800 m. The top-seal of the primary container is a proven caprock for natural gas and is formed by the mudstones of the Upper Cromer Knoll Group, the overlying Rødby and Hidra formations and the Plenus Marl. A number of additional seals are present in the overburden within the Storage Complex, as are a number of potential secondary containers which could also serve as monitoring horizons. The geological interpretation of the storage site is based on the comprehensive datasets acquired during the discovery, appraisal and development of the Goldeneye field, and also data from other wells, fields and seismic surveys in the surrounding area. The static geological model of the storage site and adjacent aquifer has been stress tested for the key uncertainties, and it is considered to be robust. The storage capacity of the Goldeneye structure has been calculated using both <b>static</b> (<b>volumetric)</b> <b>methods</b> and dynamic flow modelling together with uncertainty analysis. Total estimated capacity of the structural closure is in the range 25 to 47 Mt and so robustly exceeds the proposed injected amount...|$|R
30|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{we assumed}} a homogeneous elastic half-space in our {{calculation of the}} coseismic <b>static</b> <b>volumetric</b> strain changes. This elastic half-space decreases the coseismic <b>static</b> <b>volumetric</b> strain changes in inverse proportion to the cubic of the hypocentral distance. Since most of the coseismic and/or postseismic groundwater level changes observed in our study were caused by relatively distant earthquakes (Fig. 1; Table 4), it seems natural that those <b>static</b> <b>volumetric</b> strain changes should scarcely {{have an effect on}} the earthquake-related changes (Itaba et al., 2008 a, b). However, the actual crust is inhomogeneous, and it is known that observed coseismic strain changes are often different from those calculated in the same manner. The local strain accumulation due to inhomogeneous structures and its subsequent release by ground shaking is one possible explanation of the difference (Watanabe, 1991). This strain release, which is a type of <b>static</b> <b>volumetric</b> strain change due to the presence of inhomogeneous structures, is another possible causal factor of earthquake-related changes; ground shaking is also important in this context.|$|R

40|$|Thermo-physical properties, surface {{characteristics}} and water vapor uptake capacity are key parameters {{in the selection}} of adsorbent for an adsorption desalination (AD) cycle. In the AD cycles, silica gel is used as adsorbent due to their high water vapor uptake capacity, reliability, repeatability and inexpensiveness as compared to other adsorbents. Three types of commercially available silica gels (Type-RD 2560,Type-A 5 BW and Type-A++) are investigated using a surface characteristic analyzer and their thermo-physical properties are evaluated using several analysis methods. The instrument used in this investigation employs the <b>static</b> <b>volumetric</b> <b>method</b> with liquid Nitrogen at 77 K as the filing fluid. The surface area of each adsorbent is studied using Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method whilst the pore size distribution (PSD) analysis is conducted with the Non-Local Density Functional Theory (NLDFT). It is observed that the Type-A++ silica gel (granular type) possesses the highest surface area of 863. 6 m 2 /g amongst the three parent silica gels studied. It has a two-maxima or bimodal distribution pattern where the pore diameters are distributed mostly between 10 Å and 30 Å. Water vapor uptake capacity of silica gels are studied with water vapor dosage apparatus and the results show that the Type-A++ silica gel exhibits a highest equilibrium uptake at 537 cm 3 /g. These thermo-physical properties are essential for the design and the numerical simulation of AD cycles. © 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
40|$|The {{equilibrium}} {{adsorption isotherms}} {{of carbon dioxide}} on a commercial granular activated carbon (GAC) and an ammonia-modified GAC (OXA-GAC) were measured using a <b>static</b> <b>volumetric</b> <b>method.</b> CO 2 adsorption measurements were performed at three different temperatures (303, 318, and 333 K), and pressures up to 1 atm. The obtained equilibrium data were fitted to the Freundlich, Sips, and Toth isotherms using a semi-empirical approach to differentiate the contributions of physical and chemical adsorption to the total CO 2 uptake. The isotherm parameters were determined independently for each mechanism by non-linear regression. To evaluate {{the adequacy of the}} fit of the isotherm models, two different error functions (i. e., the average relative error and the nonlinear regression coefficient) were calculated. The Toth semi-empirical equilibrium model provided the best fit to the experimental data, with average relative errors of less than 3 % observed at all temperatures. The isosteric heats of CO 2 adsorption onto the ammonia-modified adsorbent and onto the untreated adsorbent were determined using the Clausius–Clapeyron equation. The loading dependence of the isosteric enthalpy of CO 2 adsorption over the OXA-GAC reflected an energetic heterogeneity of the adsorbent surface. The initial isosteric heats of adsorption of 70. 5 kJ mol− 1 and 25. 5 kJ mol− 1 correspond to the adsorption of CO 2 on the modified and untreated adsorbents, respectively, and these values were in excellent agreement with the zero-coverage heats of adsorption obtained using the temperature-dependent parameters of the proposed model...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAccording to the {{low power}} and the {{chemical}} modifiction properties of organic gas-sensing material, the organic semiconductor material of molecule hybrid CuPc and PANI was used as gas-sensing film, and the gas sensor which has high selectivity to toxic gas was investigated. CuPc was synthesized with Phthalonitrile and p-Cresol as the source material of benzene ring by the template synthesis method of two steps reaction. Through doping with perchloric acid, vitriol and nitric acid, semiconducting doped PANI was obtained. By means of molecular hybrid modification, the intermediate substance of CuPc and PANI was polymerized and formed a kind of new organic semiconductor material CuPcxPANI 1 -x. Sensor chip was made by virtue of semiconductor technology; the combination of chip and new sensitive material was achieved by virtue of vacuum coating technology. The film surface morphology were characterized through SEM, and it showed that the sensitive material was made of rounded particles whose diameter was about 200 nm; the surface of film was deposited by odontoid particals, whose diameter is 200 nm or so, and relatively uniform, and its aperture is ordered.
