5|$|Winds can shape landforms, via {{a variety}} of aeolian {{processes}} such as the formation of fertile soils, such as loess, and by erosion. Dust from large deserts can be moved great distances from its <b>source</b> <b>region</b> by the prevailing winds; winds that are accelerated by rough topography and associated with dust outbreaks have been assigned regional names {{in various parts of}} the world because of their significant effects on those regions. Wind also affects the spread of wildfires. Winds can disperse seeds from various plants, enabling the survival and dispersal of those plant species, as well as flying insect populations. When combined with cold temperatures, wind has a negative impact on livestock. Wind affects animals' food stores, as well as their hunting and defensive strategies.|$|E

25|$|The 256-element free Boolean algebra {{on three}} {{generators}} is deployed in computer displays based on raster graphics, which use bit blit to manipulate whole regions consisting of pixels, relying on Boolean operations to specify how the <b>source</b> <b>region</b> should {{be combined with}} the destination, typically {{with the help of}} a third region called the mask. Modern video cards offer all 223=256 ternary operations for this purpose, with the choice of operation being a one-byte (8-bit) parameter. The constants SRC = 0xaa or 10101010, DST = 0xcc or 11001100, and MSK = 0xf0 or 11110000 allow Boolean operations such as (SRC^DST) (meaning XOR the source and destination and then AND the result with the mask) to be written directly as a constant denoting a byte calculated at compile time, 0x60 in the (SRC^DST) example, 0x66 if just SRC^DST, etc. At run time the video card interprets the byte as the raster operation indicated by the original expression in a uniform way that requires remarkably little hardware and which takes time completely independent of the complexity of the expression.|$|E
500|$|In meteorology, an {{air mass}} is {{a volume of}} air defined by its {{temperature}} and water vapor content. [...] Air masses cover many {{hundreds or thousands of}} square miles, and adapt to the characteristics of the surface below them. They are classified according to latitude and their continental or maritime source regions. [...] Colder air masses are termed polar or arctic, while warmer air masses are deemed tropical. [...] Continental and superior air masses are dry while maritime and monsoon air masses are moist. [...] Weather fronts separate air masses with different density (temperature and/or moisture) characteristics. [...] Once an air mass moves away from its <b>source</b> <b>region,</b> underlying vegetation and water bodies can quickly modify its character. [...] Classification schemes tackle an air mass' characteristics, as well as modification.|$|E
500|$|Tropical and {{equatorial}} air masses are hot as they develop over lower latitudes. [...] Those that develop over land (continental) are drier and hotter {{than those that}} develop over oceans, and travel poleward on the western periphery of the subtropical ridge. [...] Maritime tropical air masses are {{sometimes referred to as}} trade air masses. [...] Monsoon air masses are moist and unstable. [...] Superior air masses are dry, and rarely reach the ground. [...] They normally reside over maritime tropical air masses, forming a warmer and drier layer over the more moderate moist air mass below, forming what is known as a trade wind inversion over the maritime tropical air mass. Continental Polar air masses (cP) are air masses that are cold and dry due to their continental <b>source</b> <b>region.</b> Continental polar air masses that affect North America form over interior Canada. Continental Tropical air masses (cT) are a type of tropical air produced by the subtropical ridge over large areas of land and typically originate from low-latitude deserts such as the Sahara Desert in northern Africa, which is the major source of these air masses. Other less important sources producing cT air masses are the Arabian Peninsula, the central arid/semi-arid part of Australia and deserts lying in the Southwestern United States. Continental tropical air masses are extremely hot and dry.|$|E

500|$|Heinrich's {{original}} {{observations were}} of six layers in ocean sediment cores with extremely high proportions of rocks of continental origin, [...] "lithic fragments", in the 180μm to [...] size range (Heinrich 1988). The larger size fractions cannot be transported by ocean currents, {{and are thus}} interpreted as having been carried by icebergs or sea ice which broke off glaciers or ice shelves, and dumped debris onto the sea floor as the icebergs melted. Geochemical analyses of the IRD can provide information {{about the origin of}} these debris: mostly the large Laurentide ice sheet then covering North America for Heinrich events 1, 2, 4 and 5, and on the contrary, European ice sheets for the minor events 3 and 6. The signature of the events in sediment cores varies considerably with distance from the <b>source</b> <b>region.</b> For events of Laurentide origin, there is a belt of IRD at around 50° N, known as the Ruddiman belt, expanding some 3,000km (1,865mi) from its North American source towards Europe, and thinning by an order of magnitude from the Labrador Sea to the European end of the present iceberg route (Grousset et al., 1993). During Heinrich events, huge volumes of fresh water flow into the ocean. For Heinrich event 4, based on a model study reproducing the isotopic anomaly of oceanic oxygen 18, the fresh water flux has been estimated to 0.29±0.05Sverdrup with a duration of 250±150years (Roche et al., 2004), equivalent to a fresh water volume of about [...] or a [...] sea-level rise.|$|E
500|$|Io orbits {{within a}} belt of intense {{radiation}} {{known as the}} Io plasma torus. The plasma in this doughnut-shaped ring of ionized sulfur, oxygen, sodium, and chlorine originates when neutral atoms in the [...] "cloud" [...] surrounding Io are ionized and carried along by the Jovian magnetosphere. Unlike the particles in the neutral cloud, these particles co-rotate with Jupiter's magnetosphere, revolving around Jupiter at 74km/s. Like the rest of Jupiter's magnetic field, the plasma torus is tilted with respect to Jupiter's equator (and Io's orbital plane), so that Io is at times below {{and at other times}} above the core of the plasma torus. As noted above, these ions' higher velocity and energy levels are partly responsible for the removal of neutral atoms and molecules from Io's atmosphere and more extended neutral cloud. The torus is composed of three sections: an outer, [...] "warm" [...] torus that resides just outside Io's orbit; a vertically extended region known as the [...] "ribbon", composed of the neutral <b>source</b> <b>region</b> and cooling plasma, located at around Io's distance from Jupiter; and an inner, [...] "cold" [...] torus, composed of particles that are slowly spiraling in toward Jupiter. After residing an average of 40 days in the torus, particles in the [...] "warm" [...] torus escape and are partially responsible for Jupiter's unusually large magnetosphere, their outward pressure inflating it from within. Particles from Io, detected as variations in magnetospheric plasma, have been detected far into the long magnetotail by New Horizons. To study similar variations within the plasma torus, researchers measure the ultraviolet light it emits. Although such variations have not been definitively linked to variations in Io's volcanic activity (the ultimate source for material in the plasma torus), this link has been established in the neutral sodium cloud.|$|E

The focal mechanism can be derived from observing the pattern of [...] "first motions", that is, whether the first arriving P waves break up or down. This method was used before waveforms were recorded and analysed digitally and this method is still used for earthquakes too small for easy moment tensor solution.

A weak but detectable positive correlation between hematite and goethite contents could indicate that Al-hematite and Al-goethite could have both formed during pedogenesis. For ferrimagnetic minerals, PSD/MD magnetite particles were partially oxidized in the dust <b>source</b> <b>regions.</b> In addition, significant differences exist between the magnetic properties of eolian material from source to sink on the CLP. CLP sediments have relatively uniform magnetic properties, while the source material does not. By comparing the magnetic properties between the CLP loess and material from potential dust <b>source</b> <b>regions</b> (MG, GB + BJ, MU, and TG), {{it is clear that}} coarse-grained (MD) magnetite has been winnowed deposit during transportation so that such particles are not common in loess deposits.

3000|$|By {{integrating}} {{information from}} both ferrimagnetic and antiferromagnetic minerals, the dust provenance of the CLP loess samples can be reasonably discriminated to first order. In {{terms of the}} remanence contribution (Figures  9 and 10; Table  1), samples from the CLP <b>source</b> <b>regions</b> (MG, GB + GJ, MU, and TG) and other non-CLP <b>source</b> <b>regions</b> differ significantly. For the CLP sources, detrital maghemite (oxidized magnetite) dominates the magnetic behavior and accounts for > 70 % of the remanence, while low coercivity magnetite as well as high coercivity hematite and goethite only play a minor role. This behavior is consistent with that of loess samples from the CLP (Eyre, 1996). By correlating HC% and the L-ratio (Figure  10), we observe that samples from the CLP <b>source</b> <b>regions</b> have a rather uniform coercivity distribution and relatively low L-ratios. In contrast, samples from other regions have higher AFM concentrations. Therefore, the composition and grain size of magnetic minerals from the non-CLP <b>source</b> <b>regions</b> are more variable.

2500|$|Oil is {{generally}} {{a product of}} thermal breakdown of type I and type II kerogen during catagenesis. The deuterium content should reflect the source kerogen signal, generation fractionation, isotopic exchange and other maturation effects. The thermal maturation at the oil window can erase much of the primary signals of hydrogen isotopes. The formation of oil involves breaking C-C and C-H bonds, resulting in depletion of 13C and D in the products and enrichment in the residual reactants due to kinetic isotope effects. Yongchun Tang and his colleagues modeled this process based on laboratory-calibrated kinetics data {{and found that the}} frequency factor ratio for D/H is 1.07. Moreover, oil is also affected by the isotope fractionation from phase-change. However, the behavior of oil gas-liquid fractionation differs from water as the vapor phase of oil is enriched in D. This will deplete residual oil as it gets evaporated. Biological degradation of oil is also expected to fractionate hydrogen isotopes, as enzymatic breaking of C-H bond have a normal kinetic isotope effect. Several degradation experiments show that this fractionation {{is generally}} mild, ranging from -11‰ to -79‰. This process should also enrich partially degraded oil. Finally, oil stored in a reservoir often had migrated through subsurface (also known as [...] "geochromatography") from another <b>source</b> <b>region,</b> interacting with water. No data has been published to confirm the fractionation associated with migration, yet theoretical prediction shows that this is likely to be very small.|$|E
