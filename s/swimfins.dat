5|$|To avoid injury during descent, divers must be {{competent}} at equalising the ears, sinuses and mask; {{they must}} also learn not to hold their breath while ascending, to avoid barotrauma of the lungs. The speed of ascent must be controlled to avoid DCS, which requires buoyancy control skills. Good buoyancy control and trim also allow the diver to manoeuvre and move about safely, comfortably and efficiently, using <b>swimfins</b> for propulsion.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} logo of {{this edition}} of the Mediterranean Games featured simple graphical illustrations of mountains and sea of the Abruzzo region. Pescara is the capital of Province of Pescara which is situated in the Abruzzo region. The official mascot was a Marsican brown bear, called Aua`, wearing a diving mask and flip-flops with <b>swimfins</b> in his hands. The Marsican brown bear is a highly threatened, unrecognised subspecies of the Brown bear, with a range restricted to the Abruzzo National Park. The mascot was unveiled by the Mediterranean Games Executive Committee during their meeting in Pescara from 24 to 28 March 2008.|$|E

50|$|A monofin {{is a type}} of <b>swimfin</b> {{typically}} used in underwater sports such as finswimming, free-diving and underwater orienteering. It consists of a single or linked surfaces attached to both of the diver's feet. The diver's appearance is then reminiscent of a mermaid or merman.|$|R

Another poster featuring Babbar and Koechlin was released alongside the first look; the former {{was dressed in}} a leisure suit, while the latter wore a Traje de flamenca (a flamenco dress).

2500|$|December 17, 1942: Six Italians {{on three}} torpedoes left the Olterra {{to attack the}} three British {{warships}} , , and [...] in Gibraltar. A British patrol boat killed one torpedo's crew (Lt. Visintini and Petty Officer Magro) with a depth charge. Their bodies were recovered, and their <b>swimfins</b> were taken and used by two of Gibraltar's British guard divers (who dived with Davis Escape Sets and (up to here) breaststroke swimming and no fins) (Sydney Knowles and Commander Lionel Crabb). Another British patrol boat spotted another torpedo, and chased and shot at it and captured its two crewmen. The remaining torpedo returned to the Olterra without its rear rider.|$|E
50|$|A monofin {{is a type}} of <b>swimfin</b> {{typically}} used in underwater sports such as finswimming, free-diving and underwater orienteering, and in recreational freediving. It consists of a single surface attached to footpockets for both of the diver's feet. First introduced in 1972 by a Ukrainian finswimming club, they have become popular with the mermaiding community due to excellent propulsion during swimming and their realistically mermaidish silhouette. Monofins can be made of glass fiber or carbon fiber. The swimmer's muscle power, swimming style, and the type of aquatic activity the monofin is used for determines the choice of size, stiffness, and materials.|$|R

50|$|In 1949 Ivor Howitt or {{a friend}} of his mailed to the Dunlop Rubber Company for swimfins; Dunlop {{answered}} that they had no plans to make <b>swimfins</b> and saw no use for them in peacetime.

50|$|In Britain, Dunlop made frogman's fins for World War II, {{but after}} the war saw no market for them in peacetime, and, after the first supply of war-surplus frogman's kit was used up, the British public had no access to <b>swimfins</b> (except for home-made {{attempts}} such as gluing marine plywood to plimsolls), until Oscar Gugen began importing <b>swimfins</b> and swimming goggles from France.|$|E
50|$|Early inventors, {{including}} Leonardo da Vinci and Giovanni Alfonso Borelli, {{toyed with}} the concept of <b>swimfins.</b> Benjamin Franklin made a pair of early <b>swimfins</b> (for hands) {{when he was a young}} boy living in Boston, Massachusetts near the Charles River; they were two thin pieces of wood, about the shape of an artist's palette, which allowed him to move faster than he usually did in the water.|$|E

50|$|Bodysurfing {{is the art}} {{and sport}} of riding a wave without the {{assistance}} of any buoyant device such as a surfboard or bodyboard.

50|$|On 8 December 1942, {{during one}} such attack, {{two of the}} Italian frogmen, Lieutenant Visintini and Petty Officer Magro died, {{probably}} killed by depth charges.

50|$|<b>Swimfins,</b> swim fins, fins or {{flippers}} are finlike accessories worn on {{the foot}} or leg and made from rubber, plastic or combinations of these materials, to aid movement through the water in water sports activities such as swimming, bodyboarding, bodysurfing, kneeboarding, riverboarding, underwater hockey, underwater rugby and various other types of underwater diving.|$|E

50|$|Snorkeling (British and Commonwealth English spelling: snorkelling) is the {{practice}} of swimming on or through {{a body of water}} while equipped with a diving mask, a shaped breathing tube called a snorkel, and usually <b>swimfins.</b> In cooler waters, a wetsuit may also be worn. Use of this equipment allows the snorkeler to observe underwater attractions for extended periods with relatively little effort and to breathe while face-down at the surface.|$|E
