5|$|Buckets {{began to}} be {{replaced}} with plastic bags, which allowed people to see at a distance how much <b>sap</b> had been collected. Syrup producers also began using tractors to haul vats of <b>sap</b> from the trees being tapped (the sugarbush) to the evaporator. Some producers adopted motor-powered tappers and metal tubing systems to convey <b>sap</b> from the tree to a central collection container, but these techniques were not widely used. Heating methods also diversified: modern producers use wood, oil, natural gas, propane, or steam to evaporate <b>sap.</b> Modern filtration methods were perfected to prevent contamination of the syrup.|$|E
5|$|In {{temperate}} climates {{there is}} a sudden movement of <b>sap</b> {{at the end of}} the winter as trees prepare to burst into growth. In North America, the <b>sap</b> of the sugar maple (Acer saccharum) is most often used in the production of a sweet liquid, maple syrup. About 90% of the <b>sap</b> is water, the remaining 10% being a mixture of various sugars and certain minerals. The <b>sap</b> is harvested by drilling holes in the trunks of the trees and collecting the liquid that flows out of the inserted spigots. It is piped to a sugarhouse where it is heated to concentrate it and improve its flavour. One litre of maple syrup is obtained from every forty litres of <b>sap</b> and has a sugar content of exactly 66%. Similarly in northern Europe the spring rise in the <b>sap</b> of the silver birch (Betula pendula) is tapped and collected, either to be drunk fresh or fermented into an alcoholic drink. In Alaska, the <b>sap</b> of the sweet birch (Betula lenta) is made into a syrup with a sugar content of 67%. Sweet birch <b>sap</b> is more dilute than maple sap; a hundred litres are required to make one litre of birch syrup.|$|E
5|$|The {{higher the}} sugar {{content of the}} <b>sap,</b> the fewer the gallons of <b>sap</b> are needed to obtain one gallon of syrup. 57 gallons of <b>sap</b> with 1.5% sugar content will yield 1 gallon of syrup, but only 25 gallons of <b>sap</b> with a 3.5% sugar content are needed to obtain one gallon of syrup. The sap's sugar content is highly {{variable}} and will fluctuate even within the same tree.|$|E

The performance of mortars with different curing methods was also tested. The results showed that <b>SAPs</b> in the mortars played a role of reserving water and the mechanical properties of hardened mortars with <b>SAPs</b> were better than those had no <b>SAPs</b> and exposed to the air, which suggested that incorporating <b>SAPs</b> {{can be an effective}} self-curing method...|$|R

In this paper, <b>SAPs</b> with different water absorption and size were selected to discuss their effect on autogenous deformation of cement paste and strength of mortars.

The influence of <b>SAPs</b> on mortar mechanical properties revealed that SPAs {{seemed to have no}} negative effect on the strength of cement past.

5|$|The Algonquians {{recognized}} maple <b>sap</b> as {{a source}} of energy and nutrition. At the beginning of the spring thaw, they used stone tools to make V-shaped incisions in tree trunks; they then inserted reeds or concave pieces of bark to run the <b>sap</b> into buckets, which were often made from birch bark. The maple <b>sap</b> was concentrated either by dropping hot cooking stones into the buckets or by leaving them exposed to the cold temperatures overnight and disposing of the layer of ice that formed on top. While there was widespread agriculture in Mesoamerica and the Southeast and Southwest regions of the United States, the production of maple syrup is one of only a few agricultural processes in the Northeast that is not a European colonial import.|$|E

The characteristics of the Hawaiian <b>sapping</b> valleys are compared to Martian valleys and experimental systems, and good correlation between the data is detected.

40|$|AbstractSingle {{nucleotide}} polymorphisms (SNPs) are {{one type}} of genomic DNA variations in a population.

40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{insight into}} how structural adjustment policies (<b>SAPs)</b> may have affected deforestation and forest degradation in the lowland tropical forests of Bolivia, Cameroon and Indonesia.

The indirect effects of <b>SAP's</b> on forests resulting from changes in overall economic growth, inflation rates, employment and consumption are difficult to measure and predict. The experience of Cameroon and Indonesia indicate that <b>SAPs</b> that sucees in creating new off-farm employment opportunities probably reduce deforestation, while {{those that do not}} succeed have the opposite effect, but this is still inconclusive. There is little evidence that government spending restrictions associated with <b>SAPs</b> diminished governments' ability to promote sustainable forest management or control deforestation, largerly because there was minimal capacity in the first place.

40|$|Sustainable {{agricultural}} practices (<b>SAPs)</b> {{that lead to}} an increase in productivity are central to the acceleration of economic growth; this will alleviate poverty and help to overcome the recurrent food shortages that affect millions of households in Africa. However, the adoption rates of <b>SAPs</b> remain below expected levels. This paper analyzes the factors that facilitate or impede the probability and level of adoption of interrelated <b>SAPs,</b> using recent data of multiple plot-level observations. Multivariate and ordered probit models are applied to the modeling of adoption decisions by farm households facing multiple <b>SAPs</b> which can be adopted in various combinations. The results show that there is a significant correlation between <b>SAPs,</b> suggesting that adoptions of <b>SAPs</b> are interrelated. The analysis further shows that both the probability and the level of decisions to adopt <b>SAPs</b> are influenced by many factors: a household’s trust in government support, credit constraint, spouse education, rainfall and plot-level disturbances, household wealth, social capital and networks, including the number of traders known by a farmer in his vicinity, his participation in rural institutions, and the number of relatives he has inside and outside his village, labor availability, and plot and market access. These results imply that policy makers and development practitioners whose aims are to strengthen local institutions and service providers, maintain or increase household asset bases, and establish and strengthen social protection schemes, can speed up the adoption of <b>SAPs...</b>|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades, {{multiple}} {{studies have been conducted}} and many articles published about Structural Adjustment Programmes (<b>SAPs).</b> These studies mainly describe the characteristics of <b>SAPs</b> and analyse their economic consequences as well as their effects upon a variety of sectors: health, education, agriculture and environment. However, very few focus on the sociological and cultural effects of <b>SAPs.</b> Following a summary of <b>SAP's</b> content and characteristics, the paper briefly discusses the historical course of <b>SAPs</b> and the different critiques which have been made. The cultural consequences of <b>SAPs</b> are introduced and are described on four different levels: political, community, familial, and individual. These levels are analysed through examples from the literature and individual testimonies from people in the Southern Hemisphere. The paper concludes that <b>SAPs,</b> alongside economic globalisation processes, are responsible for an acute breakdown of social and cultural structures in societies in the South. It should be a priority, not only to better understand the situation and its determining factors, but also to intervene and act with strategies that support and reinvest in the social and cultural sectors, which is vital in order to allow for individuals and communities in the South to strengthen their autonomy and identity.
