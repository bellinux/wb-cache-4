40|$|Approximately {{one-third of}} all {{patients}} with renal cell carcinoma have metastasis {{at the time of}} diagnosis. Metastatic lesions of renal cell car-cinoma are most commonly seen in the lung, and they are frequently seen in the bone and liver. However, spleen and rectal metastases are extremely rare. A 63 -year-old man had undergone left radical nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma. About 22 months later, computed tomography revealed multiple enhanced masses in the spleen. Spleen metastasis was suspected and splenectomy was then performed. One year later, the patient visited with complaints of voiding difficulty. A huge pelvic mass was detected by performing <b>prostate</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> and MRI. The mass was 13 cm in diameter and it was between the rectum and the prostate. Removal of the pelvic mass and lower anterior resection with end colostomy was done. Histologically, the resected specimens were diagnosed as metastases from the renal cell cancer. Herein, we report on a case of metachronous splenic and rectal metastasis from renal cell carcinoma. (Korean J Uro...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Blood {{perfusion}} regulates intraprostatic temperatures during transurethral microwave thermotherapy (TUMT). We evaluated baseline intraprostatic vasculature, as {{a predictor}} of efficacy of TUMT. METHODS: Twenty-two patients, with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) suggestive of bladder outflow obstruction, were treated with TUMT (Prostatron). At baseline, three-dimensional contrast-enhanced power-flow-Doppler <b>prostate</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> (3 D-CE-PFD) was performed. Assuming that the percentage of perfused area (PPA) is a realistic measure of blood flow, it was used to quantify intraprostatic vasculature. RESULTS: The median (range) age, prostate size, and energy delivered were 66 years (48 - 80), 47 cm(3) (30 - 121), 110 kJ (29 - 136), respectively. The response was 77 % (5 failures). The median (range) PPA was 2. 76 % (0. 7 - 11. 3). No difference in PPA among good and poor responders was detected nor was any correlation between PPA and baseline parameters. CONCLUSIONS: The baseline intraprostatic vascularization, documented by CE-PFD studies, has no predictive value for the efficacy of TUMT. It seems that "static" baseline blood flow does not reflect the "dynamic" thermoregulatory role of blood flow during treatmen...|$|R
40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the efficacy of}} high energy transurethral microwave thermotherapy for treating urinary retention due to benign prostatic hyperplasia. Between October 1993 and March 1999, 41 patients with urinary retention were treated with high energy transurethral microwave thermotherapy. Initial evaluation consisted of a history, clinical examination, urethrocystoscopy, transrectal <b>prostate</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> and urodynamic investigation with a pressure flow study. Followup visits at 12, 26 and 52 weeks included International Prostate Symptom Score (I-PSS), uroflowmetry and post-void residual urine volume determination. At 26 weeks the urodynamic study was repeated. Kaplan-Meier plots were constructed to evaluate the risk of re-treatment adjusted for patients lost to followup. At baseline median patient age was 74 years and median prostate size was 67 ml. Median 133 kJ. were administered. Nine patients underwent re-treatment and 11 were lost to followup. The re-treatment rate after 1 year was 25 % (95 % confidence interval 11 to 40). In good responders at 12, 26 and 52 weeks median maximal urine free flow was 15, 11 and 15 ml. per second, post-void residual urine volume was 61, 8 and 35 ml., and I-PSS was 7, 5 and 2, respectively. Quality of life (I-PSS question 8) was 1 at all visits. In patients with severe co-morbidity transurethral microwave thermotherapy is often the only alternative to an indwelling catheter with obvious quality of life advantages.

40|$|Introduction 					Published {{data suggest}} that {{patients}} with acromegaly have an increased prevalence of prostate disorders. 				 				 					Objective 					To evaluate prostatic disorders in acromegalic patients comparing these results after one year of treatment of acromegaly and {{with a group of}} healthy men. 				 				 					Materials and Methods 					This study was composed of two parts: sectional study comparing patients with healthy controls (baseline) and prospective, longitudinal study (at baseline and after one year of treatment). Forty acromegalic patients were enrolled and evaluated at baseline and after one year with the application of international prostatic symptoms score (IPSS), digital rectal examination, measurements of growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), insulin-like growth factor-binding protein- 3 (IGFBP- 3), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), prolactin, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), total testosterone, total and free prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and <b>prostate</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> (US). Thirty healthy men were selected as control group. 				 				 					Results 					We stratified patients and controls according to age, considering 40 years-old as cut off. Healthy controls under 40 had IPSS values lower than acromegalic patients. When considering only older patients and controls prostate hyperplasia and structural abnormalities were more frequent in acromegalics. After one year of treatment there was significant decrease in GH, IGF-I and prostate volume in acromegalics over 40 years-old. 				 				 					Conclusions 					Acromegalics under 40 have more urinary symptoms according to IPSS and above 40 years-old higher frequency of structural changes and increased prostate volume than healthy men. Significant reduction of GH and IGF-I levels during treatment of acromegaly leads to decrease in the prostate volume...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Chronic {{prostatitis}} (CP) /chronic {{pelvic pain}} syndrome (CPPS) {{has been studied}} mainly in adults; reports in adolescents are rare. We compared the clinical characteristics of adolescent CP/CPPS patients with those of young adults. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 20 adolescents with CP/CPPS aged < 20 years who visited our outpatient department from August 2005 to April 2012. The control group comprised 120 young adult CP/CPPS patients. A complete medical history, physical examination, {{the national institute of}} health-chronic prostatitis symptoms index (NIH-CPSI) questionnaire, urinalysis, expressed prostatic secretion (EPS) or semen analysis, transrectal <b>prostate</b> <b>ultrasonography,</b> and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were performed. Based on the EPS or semen analysis, patients were divided into category III-A or III-B. Results: The mean age was 16. 5 ± 2. 0 and 32. 8 ± 5. 0 years in the adolescent and control groups, respectively. A sexual activity history was seen in 2 patients; 9 and 11 patients were in category III-A and III-B, respectively. The PSA was 0. 65 ± 0. 39 and 1. 22 ± 0. 48 ng/ mL in the adolescent and control groups, respectively. The prostate size was 12. 4 ± 4. 4 and 21. 0 ± 4. 9 g in the adolescent and control groups, respectively. The NIH-CPSI scores in the adolescent group were 9. 2 ± 5. 2, 5. 5 ± 3. 5, 7. 5 ± 3. 2, and 22. 2 ± 8. 1 for pain, voiding, quality of life (QoL) domains, and total scores, respectively. The adolescent group showed a tendency to exhibit high voiding symptom scores. Conclusions: CPPS has an equally severe impact on QoL in adults and adolescents. Apart from high voiding symptom scores in adolescents, no difference was found in terms of urologic clinical parameters...|$|R
40|$|For years {{endocrine}} {{effects have}} been considered as a topic of increasing interest, both in science and in the public, and at the regulatory level. Many in vitro and in vivo methods are described for detecting endocrine effects. As examples for in vitro methods, non-specific tests, oestrogen related tests systems, and androgen related test systems on different human and animal cell lines or cell cultures, as well as cell free assays for detecting oestrogenic/androgenic activities have been proposed and were used. These tests {{play an important role}} in screening of high numbers of compounds for their endocrine potential, and in giving helpful informations for further in vivo investigations. Examples for in vivo methods are non-specific tests (e. g. : rodent teratology screen, rodent pregnancy maintenance test, rat implantation model, rodent vaginal assay, rodent behavioural modification), and oestrogen related tests on rodents (e. g. : rodent uterine assay, rodent endometriosis assay, rodent vaginal assays, rodent mammary gland, the ´neoDES ´ mouse model, rodent behavioural modification), and androgen related tests (chicken cockscomb topical bioassay, quail uropygial gland assay, rodent submandibular gland sensivity, rat prostate models, mouse seminal vesicles, hamster flank organ, dog <b>prostate</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> model, dog sialic acid depletion test). To propose validated methods to the scientific community and to the investigators in the industry, the chemical industry is working with the scientific community on a series of world-wide research initiatives to gain a clearer understanding of endocrine related effects. New non-invasive techniques are needed to reveal the oestrogenic or anti-androgenic capacity of different substances quickly and reliably to investigate the relation between possible endocrine active compounds and diseases in humans. Therefore, worldwide different authorities have started research projects to investigate the effects of endocrine active compounds and to adopt a strategy with short-, medium-and long-term actions in order to respond quickly and effectively to the problem (e. g.

40|$|To {{facilitate}} {{prostate cancer}} imaging using targeted molecules, we constructed ultrasonic nanobubbles coupled with specific anti-PSMA (prostate specific membrane antigen) nanobodies, and evaluated their in vitro binding capacity and in vivo imaging efficacy. The "targeted" nanobubbles, which were constructed via a biotin-streptavidin system, {{had an average}} diameter of 487. 60 ± 33. 55 nm and carried the anti-PSMA nanobody as demonstrated by immunofluorescence. Microscopy revealed targeted binding of nanobubbles in vitro to PSMA-positive cells. Additionally, ultrasonography indicators of nanobubble imaging (including arrival time, peak time, peak intensity and enhanced duration) were evaluated for the ultrasound imaging in three kinds of animal xenografts (LNCaP, C 4 - 2 and MKN 45), and showed that these four indicators of targeted nanobubbles exhibited significant differences from blank nanobubbles.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The role of IGF-I in {{prostate}} {{development is}} currently under thorough investigation {{since it has}} been claimed that IGF-I is a positive predictor of prostate cancer. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of chronic GH and IGF-I deficiency alone or associated with testosterone deficiency on prostate pathophysiology {{in a series of}} patients with hypopituitarism. DESIGN: Pituitary, androgen and prostate hormonal assessments and transrectal <b>prostate</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> (TRUS) were performed in 30 men with adulthood onset GH deficiency (GHD) and 30 age-matched healthy controls, free from previous or concomitant prostate disorders. RESULTS: Plasma IGF-I levels were significantly lower in GHD patients than in controls (Pearson's coefficient P 30 ml) was significantly lower in hypogonadal and eugonadal GHD patients, without any difference between them (15. 3 % and 5. 8 %), than in controls (43. 3 %) (chi(2) = 6. 90, P= 0. 005). No difference was found in PV between patients with normal or deficient IGF-I levels both in the hypogonadal group (19. 9 +/- 4. 7 vs 17. 3 +/- 4. 0 ml) and in the eugonadal group (22. 6 +/- 2. 3 vs 21. 8 +/- 2. 5 ml). When controls and patients were divided according to age (60 years), PV was significantly lower in hypogonadal GHD patients aged below 60 years than in age-matched controls (P< 0. 01) or eugonadal GHD patients (P< 0. 01), without any difference between controls and eugonadal GHD patients. Controls aged above 60 years had significantly higher PV than both hypogonadal and eugonadal GHD patients (P< 0. 01). Calcifications, cysts or nodules were found in 56. 7 % of patients and in 50 % of controls (chi(2) = 0. 067, P= 0. 79). In controls, but not in GHD patients, PV and TZV were correlated with age (r= 0. 82, r= 0. 46, P< 0. 0001 and P< 0. 01 respectively). PV was also correlated with GH (r=- 0. 52, P= 0. 0026), IGF-I (r=- 0. 62, P= 0. 0002) and IGF-binding protein 3 (IGFBP- 3) levels (r=- 0. 39, P= 0. 032) but neither with testosterone or dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels. In GHD patients TZV but not PV was correlated with age (r= 0. 58, P= 0. 0007) and neither TZV nor PV were correlated with GH, IGF-I or IGFBP- 3 levels. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic GH deficiency in adulthood causes a decrease in prostate size, mostly in patients with concomitant androgen deficiency and age below 60 years, without significant changes in the prevalence of structural prostate abnormalities...|$|R
40|$|In {{experimental}} models, prolactin (PRL) displays independent hypertrophic {{effects on}} the prostate. To investigate whether hyperprolactinemia is associated with prostate enlargement in humans, we designed this open, prospective, case-control study enrolling 20 men with prolactinoma (aged 34 +/- 10 yr) and 20 age-matched healthy men. The endocrine profile and <b>prostate</b> transrectal <b>ultrasonography</b> were performed before and after 12 and 24 months of cabergoline treatment in the patients and at study entry and after 24 months in the controls. The patients had lower serum testosterone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and IGF-I levels and prostate volume (15. 4 +/- 3. 5 vs. 19. 6 +/- 5. 1 ml; P < 0. 001) and higher PRL levels and prostate-specific antigen density than controls. There {{was no difference in}} prostate and transitional zone volumes between patients with normoandrogenemia (n = 8) or hypoandrogenemia (n = 12). After 12 and 24 months of treatment, PRL, testosterone, and DHT levels were normal in all cases, as were IGF-I and IGF-binding protein- 3 levels. After 24 months, prostate volume was comparable to that in controls (21. 7 +/- 4. 5 vs. 22. 5 +/- 4. 7 ml). There were no changes in prostate structure throughout the study period in either the patients or the controls. In conclusion, in young men with prolactinoma PRL excess is unlikely to have {{effects on the}} prostate per se, because it is accompanied by low testosterone and DHT levels that produce the major effects...|$|R

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the accuracy of}} the TRIMprob in the diagnosis of prostate neoplasm. METHODS Consecutive patients referred for prostate biopsy were prospectively enrolled. Patients had history taken, physical examination by digital rectal examination (DRE) of the prostate, assessment of total and free serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, <b>prostate</b> transrectal <b>ultrasonography</b> (TRUS), and TRIMprob test. Indications for prostate biopsy included {{one or more of the}} following conditions: total serum PSA levels of 4. 0 ng/mL or more, free/total serum PSA ratio of 0. 18 or less, positive results on DRE, and suspicious findings on TRUS. Twelve-core, TRUS-guided biopsies were performed with local anesthesia. A blinded investigator performed the TRIMprob test; the lowest value of the signal at 465 MHz was looked for and recorded, although data of the electromagnetic signal at 930 and 1295 MHz were also recorded. RESULTS One hundred eleven patients (aged 64. 9 8. 1 years, mean standard deviation), enrolled between November 2004 and August 2005, were analyzed. Total serum PSA level was 8. 4 3. 6 ng/mL, and free/total serum PSA ratio was 0. 15 0. 7. TRIMprob sensitivity for the diagnosis of prostate cancer was 0. 86 %; specificity and positive and negative predictive values were 0. 60 and 0. 88; accuracy was 72 %. TRIMprob accuracy outperformed any other diagnostic parameter considered, including the rule of chance. The association of TRIMprob and DRE offered a sensitivity and a negative predictive value of 0. 86 % or greater. CONCLUSIONS TRIMprob had the highest accuracy rate, among all other tests, for the diagnosis of prostate cancer.

40|$|Harm {{caused by}} {{preventive}} programs may be physical, psychological, social or, if informed consent {{has not been}} obtained, ethical. Adverse effects of preventive screening programs may occur {{at any of the}} three levels of the "screening cascade", the screening procedure itself, the investigation of abnormal results of screening tests or the treatment of detected abnormalities or diseases. The greatest harm occurs at the second and third levels. Examples of procedures that may cause physical harm are venipuncture, mammography, colonoscopy, breast biopsy, transrectal <b>ultrasonography,</b> <b>prostate</b> biopsy, weight-reducing and cholesterol-lowering diets and radical prostatectomy. The psychological and social harm of preventive programs involves anticipated discomfort or perception of adverse effects of preventive interventions; unpleasant interactions with health care workers, time required for preventive programs, excessive overall awareness of health, anxiety over the results of a screening test implications of a positive screening test, consequences of being labelled as "sick" or "at risk," psychopathologic effects induced directly by preventive programs and, {{in the case of a}} false-negative test result, false assurance of disease-free status.

40|$|This review {{discusses}} {{the current and}} emerging techniques in urinary tract imaging. Recent technical advances and novel discoveries make this an exciting but challenging time for urinary tract imaging. The first section describes the imaging of the adrenal gland which has made great strides in the last decade, the current major adrenal imaging modalities {{as well as new}} applications are discussed with particular attention to the role of imaging in the incidentally detected adrenal lesion. In the second section the role of ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) in evaluation of the renal tract are discussed with the new technical advances leading to earlier detection and characterization of renal lesions. Complementary to this is the emerging role of CT and MR urography in assessment of the urinary tract and bladder in contrast to the demise of plain film studies/intravenous urography. The role of CT angiography in assessment of the renal vasculature is also discussed.

40|$|Despite {{limitations}} {{considering the}} presence, staging and aggressiveness of <b>prostate</b> cancer, <b>ultrasonography</b> (US) -guided systematic biopsies (SBs) {{are still the}} 'gold standard' for the diagnosis of prostate cancer. Recently, promising results have been published for targeted prostate biopsies (TBs) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasonography (MRI/US) -fusion platforms. Different platforms are USA Food and Drug Administration registered and have, mostly subjective, strengths and weaknesses. To our knowledge, no systematic review exists that objectively compares prostate cancer detection rates between the different platforms available. To assess {{the value of the}} different MRI/US-fusion platforms in prostate cancer detection, we compared platform-guided TB with SB, and other ways of MRI TB (cognitive fusion or in-bore MR fusion). We performed a systematic review of well-designed prospective randomised and non-randomised trials in the English language published between 1 January 2004 and 17 February 2015, using PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library databases. Search terms included: 'prostate cancer', 'MR/ultrasound(US) fusion' and 'targeted biopsies'. Extraction of articles was performed by two authors (M. G. and A. A.) and were evaluated by the other authors. Randomised and non-randomised prospective clinical trials comparing TB using MRI/US-fusion platforms and SB, or other ways of TB (cognitive fusion or MR in-bore fusion) were included. In all, 11 of 1865 studies met the inclusion criteria, involving seven different fusion platforms and 2626 patients: 1119 biopsy naïve, 1433 with prior negative biopsy, 50 not mentioned (either biopsy naïve or with prior negative biopsy) and 24 on active surveillance (who were disregarded). The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS- 2) tool was used to assess the quality of included articles. No clear advantage of MRI/US fusion-guided TBs was seen for cancer detection rates (CDRs) of all prostate cancers. However, MRI/US fusion-guided TBs tended to give higher CDRs for clinically significant prostate cancers in our analysis. Important limitations of the present systematic review include: the limited number of included studies, lack of a general definition of 'clinically significant' prostate cancer, the heterogeneous study population, and a reference test with low sensitivity and specificity. Today, a limited number of prospective studies have reported the CDRs of fusion platforms. Although MRI/US-fusion TB has proved its value in men with prior negative biopsies, general use of this technique in diagnosing prostate cancer should only be performed after critical consideration. Before bringing MRI/US fusion-guided TB in to general practice, {{there is a need for}} more prospective studies on prostate cancer diagnosi...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Ultrasonography (USG) is the commonest {{modality}} for ascertaining prostate volume. Urologists commonly {{encounter a}} discrepancy between prostate volume on USG and actual volume of <b>prostate,</b> whereas transrectal <b>ultrasonography</b> (TRUS) gives near correct prostate volume. We undertook a prospective study {{to compare the}} relationship between changing bladder volumes to the volume of prostate. Materials and Methods: After approval of the Institutional Ethics Committee and informed consent, 25 patients (age group: 52 - 78 years) with lower urinary tract symptoms were assessed for prostate volume by USG at different bladder volumes and final comparison was done with TRUS in one setting. Each USG and TRUS was done by one urology resident {{under the guidance of}} one qualified radiologist with experience of over 15 years in this field. Equipment used was SIEMENS SONNOLINE ADARA with 3. 5 MHz probe for USG and 7. 5 MHz Endo p- 2 (biplaner) probe for TRUS. First, patients were asked to empty their bladder and post void residual urine was measured along with prostate volume. Patients were given oral fluids and USG was repeated serially at three intervals with bladder volume of 100 - 200 ml, 200 - 300 ml and > 300 ml. Finally uroflowmetry was carried out followed by TRUS. Results were recorded in a tabulated form on ′Excel spread sheet′. Results: 1. Measurement of prostate volume increases with increase in bladder volume. 2. Calculated prostate volume at minimal bladder capacity (100 - 200 ml) was found to be the closest to the volume calculated by TRUS. Conclusion: Minimal bladder volume (100 - 200 ml) is essential for near correct estimation of prostate volume by USG. With increasing bladder volume, the volume of prostate increases disproportionate to its actual volume...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Approximately 20 % to 30 % of {{patients}} with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) require medication or supplementary treatment for their continuous irritative bladder symptoms after transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). The {{purpose of this study}} was to identify any factors related to continuous bladder irritation in patients after TURP. Materials and Methods: Of all patients who underwent TURP from January 2000 to December 2007, 160 who underwent long-term follow-up were selected for this study. The International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) was assessed 12 months after TURP, and the patients were divided into two groups: one group with an irritative bladder symptom score on the IPSS of 7 or less (non-irritative group) and another group with an irritative bladder symptom score on the IPSS of 8 or greater (irritative group). Preoperative urodynamic study variables, preoperative and postoperative IPSS, and the shape of the <b>prostate</b> upon transrectal <b>ultrasonography</b> (TRUS) were analyzed. Results: Of the 160 patients, 93 patients were assigned to the non-irritative group, and 67 were assigned to the irritative group. Initial irritative bladder symptoms were significantly different between the two groups (p< 0. 05). Also, a retrourethral enlarged prostate was more frequently observed upon TRUS in the irritative group. Symptoms of urinary frequency, incontinence, and urgency were significantly greater in the irritative group. Although there was no significant difference in the preoperative quality of life between the two groups, postoperative quality of life was significantly worse in the irritative group. Conclusions: The shape of the prostate and the preoperative irritation score correlated significantly with the postoperative severity of irritative bladder symptoms. Therefore, physicians should be cautious when performing TURP in patients with a retrourethral enlarged prostate and severe irritative symptoms...|$|R

A total of 1574 treatment-naïve men with LUTS/BPH were included in this study. All patients underwent routine evaluation for LUTS/BPH including the International Index of Erectile Function and a 5 -item questionnaire developed to assess ejaculatory volume/force/pain/satisfaction/latency time. Patients who had sexual intercourse over the past 4 weeks were classified as sexually active group. A total of 783 patients were categorized as sexually active group. Decreased ejaculatory volume and force were reported by 53. 4 % and 55. 7 % of 783 sexually active men, respectively. There was {{a strong correlation between}} ejaculatory volume and force. Ejaculatory pain/discomfort, premature ejaculation (PE), and delayed ejaculation (DE) were reported in 41. 0 %, 16. 3 %, and 41. 4 % of the patients, respectively. Over 40. 0 % of men without decreased ejaculation volume/force were satisfied with ejaculatory function, whereas approximately 6. 0 % of men with decreased volume/force were satisfied with ejaculatory function. About 30. 0 % of men with decreased volume/force had orgasmic dysfunction, while approximately 10. 0 % of men without decreased volume/force did. Decreased ejaculatory volume or force was associated with LUTS severity after adjusting for other influential factors including testosterone level, erectile function, and <b>prostate</b> size on <b>ultrasonography,</b> but PE or DE or ejaculatory pain/discomfort was not. In conclusion, a considerable portion of men with LUTS/BPH appear to have a variety of EjDs. Ejaculatory volume/force and satisfaction/orgasm do not always appear to be concordant. Ejaculatory volume or force is independently associated with LUTS severity, whereas PE or DE or ejaculatory pain/discomfort is not...|$|R

Finally, we compared the prevalence of erectile dysfunction in our patients with its occurrence in a sample of 207 age-matched men who were randomly selected from a larger group of 2010 Italian men previously investigated for complaints of erectile dysfunction. 5 We performed <b>prostate</b> transrectal <b>ultrasonography</b> to exclude neoplastic disorders of the prostate and seminal vesicles in all HCV-positive patients with erectile dysfunction. Statistical analysis was performed using the χ 2 test with Yates correction and unpaired t test; P<. 05 was considered significant. Erectile dysfunction was diagnosed in 80 (39 %) HCV-positive patients and in 29 (14 %) control subjects (P<. 001) on the basis of IIEF score and nocturnal penile tumescence testing. Erectile dysfunction was more common in patients with cryoglobulinemic vasculitis than in those with chronic HCV infection (44 % vs 33 %), although this difference was not statistically significant (Table 1). Erectile dysfunction was significantly more common in both HCV groups than in control subjects (P<. 001). Plasma levels of total and free testosterone were generally lower in HCV-positive patients, but they were significantly lower in patients with erectile dysfunction vs those without (Table 1). In addition, neither erectile dysfunction nor testosterone level was significantly correlated with the severity of liver involvement, as defined on the basis of ultrasound examination (ie, irregular margins of the liver, coarse echoic pattern, and hypertrophy of caudate lobus) and laboratory tests (ie, low levels of serum albumin and pseudo-cholinesterase and prolonged prothrombin time). It has been speculated that neurovascular and hormonal effects of chronic HCV infection may contribute to the pathogenesis of erectile dysfunction. We found that hepatic failure and interferon alfa therapy were unrelated to erectile dysfunction, thus suggesting that chronic HCV infection itself may play a causal role. Nonetheless, both liver failure and interferon alfa may also contribute to erectile dysfunction, and treatment should be individualized. It is also possible, however, that antiviral treatment may improve erectile function in some HCV-positive patients, and this should be evaluated in prospective clinical trials. Finally, given the increasing prevalence of HCV, the possibility of HCV infection should be considered in the differential diagnosis of erectile dysfunction...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} if, {{in patients}} with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), measurement of the transition zone (TZ) of the <b>prostate</b> by transrectal <b>ultrasonography</b> (TRUS) and the ratio between the TZ volume and total prostate volume (TZ index) correlates better with clinical and urodynamic investigations than total prostate volume alone. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In total, 150 consecutive patients with LUTS underwent a standardized screening programme including the International Prostate Symptom Sore (IPSS), a physical examination, TRUS of the prostate and urodynamic investigations with pressure-flow studies. The total prostate volume and TZ volume were assessed from TRUS using the ellipsoid formula. Spearman's rank correlation coefficients were calculated between different prostate volume measurements and specific symptomatic and urodynamic variables. RESULTS: The relationships between specific IPSS symptoms, symptom scores and the prostate volume measurements {{were not statistically significant}} except for one domain, nocturia, that appeared to be statistically significantly correlated with the TZ index (r = 0. 25). The correlations for free flow, pressure-flow variables and prostate volume measurements were stronger, but only moderate at best. The highest correlations were between TZ volume and the linear passive urethral resistance obstruction category, urethral resistance factor and detrusor pressure at maximum flow (r = 0. 43, 0. 44 and 0. 40, respectively). The differences between the correlations of prostate volume and TZ index and these variables were small (r = 0. 39, 0. 38 and 0. 37, respectively for prostate volume and r = 0. 38, 0. 40 and 0. 33 respectively for TZ index). CONCLUSIONS: There were very small differences between the correlations of total prostate volume, TZ volume and TZ index, and clinical and pressure-flow variables. In the assessment of the last two, the estimation of the total prostate volume by TRUS was a reasonable way to obtain the required information about prostate size and measuring TZ volume and calculating TZ index was of limited additional value. Symptoms and bladder outlet obstruction were mainly determined by other factors than the prostate and, specifically, TZ volume. As earlier studies have indicated that including pressure-flow data in the pre-operative evaluation and selection of patients for interventional therapies may improve the overall clinical results, we think that prostate volume, TZ volume or symptoms alone should not be used as the main indication for deciding on the appropriate invasive treatment option...|$|R
40|$|Purpose For T {{staging of}} <b>prostate</b> cancer, transrectal <b>ultrasonography</b> and {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI) are the established imaging studies in many institutions. The use of CT and MRI for N staging is of limited value because of the low sensitivity in the detection of lymph node metastases. Bone scintigraphy is generally used to exclude the presence of bone metastases. We aimed to compare the diagnostic accuracies of 18 F-Choline PET/CT (FCH) and CI in patients with prostate cancer at initial staging and in case of suspicious of biochemical relapse. Methods and Materials A retrospective analysis of 74 patients (age: 72 ± 8 years) with histologically proven prostate cancer was performed at our Institution. All patients underwent FCH PET/ CT and CI including CT, bone scan, radiography and ultrasonography for staging and restaging of disease. Histopathology, imaging or clinical follow-up served as the standard of reference. A patient- and a lesion-based analyses were performed. Results Twenty-two patients had a Gleason score (Gs) < 7, 40 had a Gs # 7 while it was not available in 12 subjects. In patients with suspicious of disease relapse, the PSA value ranged between 0. 20 and 434 ng/mL (median: 4. 6 ng/mL). On a patient base, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and accuracy for detecting local and distant metastases were calculated to be 88 %, 67 %, 77 %, 82 %, 78 % compared with 85 %, 97 %, 97 %, 84 %, 91 % with CI. In case of initial staging the accuracy of FCH PET/CT was lower than CI (77 % vs. 92 %), whereas in case of biochemical relapse the sensitivity of FCH PET/CT was slightly higher than CI (89 % vs. 82 %). On a lesion base more lymph node and more bone metastases were detected by using FCH PET/CT compared with CI. In particular, FCH PET/CT demonstrated lymph node involvement in three patients and bone lesions in two subjects. Moreover, one patient showed a diffuse bone medullary involvement. Conclusion FCH PET/CT demonstrates apparent advantages for the restaging of prostate cancer in case of biochemical relapse compared with CI on a patient base. The advantage of PET/CT in depicting lymph node and bone metastasis in one-step should be further studied in highly-selected subset of patient...|$|R
