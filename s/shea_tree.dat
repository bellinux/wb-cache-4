40|$|The {{population}} of <b>shea</b> butter <b>tree</b> (Vitellaria paradoxa C. F. Gaertn.) —a priority tree with enormous {{economic and cultural}} values to the parkland communities in Uganda, is rapidly declining due to rapid human population growth, increasing land fragmentation, and high demand for woodfuel especially charcoal. Reversing this trend {{will depend on the}} rural community involvement in the planting, facilitating natural regeneration, and tending of <b>shea</b> <b>trees</b> on farm. As such a survey was conducted in Amuria district, eastern Uganda, to assess local strategies and constraints to on-farm management of <b>shea</b> <b>trees,</b> and document socio-demographic factors influencing the on-farm conservation. About 93 % of the households protected naturally regenerated V. paradoxa trees mainly on farms. V. paradoxa was mostly propagated through coppices and seedlings. Although insecure land tenure, insecurity, pests, disease, and shortage of planting materials were reported as major hindrances, farmsize, family size, and gender significantly (P≤ 0. 05) influenced people’s willingness to conserve V. paradoxa. Byelaws and policies on shea conservation need to be properly enforced, and further propagation research is required especially towards shortening the juvenile period of V. paradoxa so that more farmers can start propagating the tree other than relying on its natural regeneration...|$|R
40|$|The {{ecological}} adaptation of <b>shea</b> butter <b>trees</b> was assessed {{based on their}} dendrometric and production traits in four <b>shea</b> butter <b>tree</b> parks occurring in different climatic zones of Bénin. A total of 99 rectangular plots of 50 × 30 m were established within the four parks according to a random sampling scheme. In each plot, all trees with a diameter at breast height (dbh) > 10 cm were inventoried and measured for stem and crown diameters, and total height. The production of 120 productive <b>shea</b> butter <b>trees</b> was quantified. Collected data were used to compute structural parameters for each park. Moreover, stem diameter and height structures of the trees were established. Principal component analysis {{was performed on the}} dendrometric variables, and the first three components were correlated with the climatic parameters. Results revealed significant differences between parks in most of the dendrometric and production parameters of <b>shea</b> butter <b>trees.</b> For all the four parks, stem diameter and height structures present a Gaussian shape with left dissymmetry. In the Guinean zone, <b>shea</b> butter <b>trees</b> develop large crowns but produce little quantities of fruits, whereas in the Sudanian regions, the opposite trend was observed...|$|R

5000|$|Poverty {{means that}} {{deforestation}} {{is a problem}} in the country and each year the country loses approximately 32,000 hectares of forests, to make way for agriculture and for fuelwood, which around 90% of the national population are dependent upon. Numerous NGOs are active in the country, educating farmers and encouraging them to minimize land clearing and plant trees as well as cultivate the land.Trees of note include the <b>shea</b> <b>tree</b> (known as [...] "Karité" [...] in the local Dioula language and the baobab. Although the <b>shea</b> <b>tree</b> is indigenous to the semi-arid Sahel region of West Africa, Burkina Faso contains the largest number of them. The <b>shea</b> <b>tree</b> is extremely important to the Burkinabe people and is termed as [...] "women's gold" [...] by the villagers, because the nuts of <b>shea</b> <b>tree</b> can be collected and then processed by crushing and grinding to yield shea butter, important in cuisine and in exports, for use in the manufacture of chocolate and cosmetics such as soap. Shea nuts are the country's third most important export, after cotton and livestock; in 1997, an average tonne of unprocessed shea nuts sold domestically for CFA70,000 (US$980) and overseas for CFA1,00,000 (US$1400). The most important centres of shea butter production are in Sissili Province and Ziro Province. The bark of the tree is also used as an ingredient in traditional medicines and the shell of nut is said to be able to repel mosquitoes and is also said to protect existing trees. The Bambara groundnut (Vigna subterranea) is also grown in abundance; Burkina Faso produced some 20,000 tonnes in 1989, after peanuts (160,000 tonnes) and cowpeas (74,000 tonnes). Between 1982 and 1985, an attempt was made to improve the Bambara groundnut, an initiative which involved the participation of plant breeders in the Grain Legumes Programme.|$|E
50|$|Accounts from {{as early}} as Cleopatra's Egypt (1st century BCE) speak of caravans bearing clay jars of {{valuable}} shea butter for cosmetic use.

40|$|In recent times, {{climate change}} {{has become one}} of the most {{important}} phenomena and a serious global concern to humans due to the severe threat it poses to life and property. As a result, carbon (C) storage potential of agroforestry systems has been recognized by the Kyoto Protocol as an alternative for mitigating greenhouse gases. Shea (Vitellaria paradoxa) parklands in sub-Saharan Africa provide ingredients to the multi-billion euro confectionery, cosmetic and food industries. These parklands occupy millions of hectares in twenty-one African countries, including Ghana, and serve as excellent sinks for atmospheric carbon. With increasing fears of how these useful trees are in serious danger due to logging and bush burning, there have been urgent calls for the trees to be properly managed and conserved. Farmers in shea-growing communities, in the midst of financial difficulties, manage these parklands using traditional methods. There is however a possibility of the farmers deriving cash benefits from the sale of carbon stored by their <b>shea</b> <b>trees.</b> To be able to assess how much farmers can benefit financially from such carbon credits it is useful to find out how much C shea parklands store as there is limited information on C stocks of the trees in these regions. This research postulates that shea parklands are capable of storing more C, and with the right policies farmers would be willing to continue managing the trees to obtain cash benefits. The research was divided into four components. The first component assessed the C stocks of shea parklands in the Transitional, Guinea and Sudan Savannah agroecological zones of Ghana. In each zone, field and fallow lands were subdivided into new (land under crop cultivation or fallow for 1 - 5 years), medium (land under crop cultivation or fallow for 6 - 10 years) and old (land under crop cultivation or fallow for over 10 years). The results indicate that the three zones differed significantly (p< 0. 05) in C stored, with Sudan savannah recording the most C (16. 20 Mg ha- 1). There was however no significant difference between the two phases of landuse, although the field plots stored more C. In terms of age of land-use, the three age groups were not significantly different in carbon stock, but the medium plots stored the most C (9. 59 Mg ha- 1). The second component of the research was to find out the policies formulated by Ghana in response to the UNFCCC international agreements and their impact on shea production in Ghana. The findings show that Ghana has responded appropriately to these international agreements and has implemented policies for the mitigation and adaption of climate change and boosting shea production in the country. In the third component, a study was conducted in the study area to identify the strategies and practices used by farmers in managing <b>shea</b> <b>trees</b> and their perceived impact on the local communities. Results of the research indicate that farmers managed <b>shea</b> <b>trees</b> using practices such as raising seedlings by natural regeneration and creation of fire-belts around farms and trees. These improved growth and yields of trees and accrued many benefits such as income, sheabutter and other shea products. The fourth aspect of the research was to find out shea farming systems that could be developed into shea carbon project models suitable for the international carbon markets. In line with the criteria of the international carbon markets, five shea carbon project models were developed. The findings also show that carbon stored in these shea project models could be significantly enhanced if the recommended tree densities and agroforestry practices are adopted. With the required policies, if these models are implemented they would help conserve <b>shea</b> <b>trees</b> to yield carbon credits that could be traded on the international forest carbon markets and the accruing incomes paid to farmers to motivate them to continue managing and protecting the <b>shea</b> <b>trees.</b> In the end, it would be a win-win situation for all; shea parklands would be conserved to store carbon to mitigate climate change for the benefit of all while cash incomes from traded shea carbon credits would be paid to the farmers to improve their livelihoods...|$|R

30|$|Both {{optimized}} shea butters had {{the same}} fatty acids composition, but {{a difference in the}} content was noticed and could difficultly be explained. However, the higher proportion of UFA (51.19  ±  0.19  %) recorded by the beige shea butter was in conformity with Marantz et al. (2004) repartition about west Africa shea butters. The palmitic and linoleic acids proportions were, at far more important than those of Marantz et al. (2004), despite of the absence of adulteration supposed by Mégnanou and Niamké (2014) for Ivorian marked shea butters. This situation far from constituting a scientific problem could be taken into account for a best detail in shea butter characterization as function to the country. More precisely, a correlation might be established between <b>shea</b> <b>trees</b> genetic and agro-morphological characters and their butters physicochemical and biochemical characteristics.|$|R

40|$|Shea {{butter is}} a plant fat {{extracted}} from kernels of shea nuts, {{the seeds of}} <b>shea</b> <b>trees</b> (Vitellaria paradoxa). The extracted fat, which {{has a long history}} of use in sub-Saharan Africa for medicinal, culinary, and other applications, serves as cocoa butter equivalents (CBEs) in the manufacture of chocolate and is an ingredient for cosmetics in the international market. Since shea butter contains relatively high levels of unsaturated fatty acids (more than 50 %), oxidation can occur during extraction and during post-harvest processing and storage. This study investigated the protective effects of synthetic butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and selected natural antioxidants (rosmarinic acid and gallic acid) on shea butter against oxidation. Each antioxidant (0. 02 %) was added to shea butter and the mixtures were placed at 90 °C for 0, 72, and 144 h to accelerate oxidation. Measures of oxidation indicated the shea butter was protected from oxidation by addition of the antioxidants.
