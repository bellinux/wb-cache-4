5|$|Where {{the shot}} is {{tracking}} with Superman as he flies (such {{as in the}} Superman and Lois Metropolis flying sequence), front projection was used. This involved photographing the actors suspended {{in front of a}} background image dimly projected from the front onto a <b>special</b> <b>screen</b> made by 3M that would reflect light back at many times the original intensity directly into a combined camera/projector. The result was a very clear and intense photographic reproduction of both the actors and the background plate, with far less image deterioration or lighting problems than occur with rear projection.|$|E

2500|$|Cinemas in Brighton and {{elsewhere}} faced various {{difficulties in the}} 1950s. Television became popular, many cinema managers faced pay cuts, greater restrictions were placed on children visiting cinemas, and government regulations forced cinema buildings to be adapted to incorporate separate film-rewinding rooms {{if they wanted to}} show films recorded on older nitrocellulose film stock, which was flammable. Specific local problems included a smallpox epidemic which forced public buildings to close for several months, and the opening in 1953 of a popular [...] "public television theatre" [...] near the West Pier, which opened daily and showed television broadcasts on a large screen. Many cinemas in Brighton were forced to close. The Astoria initially carved out a niche by becoming the local centre for 3D films during the [...] "golden era" [...] of that technology. A <b>special</b> <b>screen</b> was fitted, and films such as House of Wax, Sangaree, The Maze and Kiss Me Kate had successful runs. Then in 1958 a major renovation took place with the aim of establishing the cinema as [...] "a roadshow house for [...] extended runs outside London's West End". The little used theatre facility was removed completely and the building became a dedicated cinema. A new, larger screen was erected in front of the proscenium, the Compton organ was taken out, the balconies were altered and some space was used to house a new projector, and the auditorium was hidden behind curtains. The changes, which cost £20,000 (£ as of [...] )) and reduced the capacity to 1,200, were completed during the summer, and on 2 August 1958 the Astoria reopened with a five-month run of South Pacific. No film had ever had such a long run in Brighton, and the cinema had further success with Gigi (1959), The Nun's Story (1959–60), Ben-Hur (1961) and Lawrence of Arabia (1962). Also, for several years until 1962, no other cinema in Sussex was able to show films recorded on 70 mm stock, so the Astoria dominated this market locally.|$|E
