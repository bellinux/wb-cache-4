40|$|A concise legal-historical {{overview}} of the requirements for establishing a legally valid marriage Within the Reformational tradition it is commonly accepted that marriage does not only have a typical and unique character, but that it also reflects the relationship between Christ and his church. This article focuses on the legal requirements for the <b>solemnisation</b> <b>of</b> a <b>marriage</b> in contemporary South African law against the legalhistorical background to the issue. In {{view of the fact}} that the formalities for solemnisation are aimed at legal certainty and the prevention <b>of</b> clandestine <b>marriages,</b> the conclusion is reached that the church may prescribe requirements for the establishment <b>of</b> a <b>marriage</b> within the parameters of its own dogma and for its own internal purposes. It is argued that the church should apply this perspective regarding members of a congregation who are involved in a long-standing relationship, but for reasons of their own, prefer not to enter into a legally recognised marriage...|$|R
40|$|This note {{investigates the}} {{validity}} of commercial universal and complete universal partnerships with reference to <b>marriages</b> out <b>of</b> community of property and without profit and loss and accrual. The validity is examined with reference to three recent cases. The matter is not new and relates to the informal amendment of the matrimonial property system. The research reveals that a distinction should be made between partnership agreements concluded before the <b>solemnisation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>marriage</b> {{on the one hand}} and between partnership agreements reached after conclusion <b>of</b> the <b>marriage</b> on the other hand. With reference to the first-mentioned partnership agreements a distinction is made between agreements concluded before the antenuptial contract where the parol evidence rule applies and agreements concluded after the antenuptial contract, where the parol evidence rule does not apply. The first-mentioned partnership agreement is void if it changes the written antenuptial agreement because the parol evidence rule prohibits {{the validity of}} extrinsic evidence. However, when the partnership agreement is concluded after the written antenuptial contract, the conclusion is reached that the partnership agreement (whether complete or commercial) is valid and enforceable between the parties but not against third parties. A complete universal partnership agreement concluded after the marriage ceremony is always invalid, because its effect changes the matrimonial property system informally. A commercial universal partnership agreement is enforceable and valid unless the written antenuptial contract prohibits it. [URL]...|$|R
2500|$|A Senate {{committee}} was subsequently launched {{to discuss the}} text of the Government's draft same-sex marriage bill, which was published by the Attorney-General's office during the parliamentary debate on the plebiscite. The bill was to have been debated in (and likely passed by) the parliament in the event the plebiscite proceeded and achieved a majority 'yes' vote. The committee gathered submissions from lawyers, religious and social service groups, with particular consternation regarding provisions in the bill allowing civil celebrants to refuse to officiate at same-sex marriages. The bill would also allow [...] religious bodies and organisations scope to refuse to provide goods and services [...] "reasonably incidental" [...] to the <b>solemnisation</b> <b>of</b> a same-sex <b>marriage.</b> During committee hearings, opponents <b>of</b> same-sex <b>marriage</b> requested additional religious freedom protections in the event <b>of</b> same-sex <b>marriage</b> ever being legalised. The committee issued its findings to the Senate and public on 15 February 2017. Significant among the committee's findings was a unanimous recommendation that a new subdivision <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> celebrant, titled Religious Marriage Celebrants, be created to capture civil celebrants of a religious inclination who would be given the same protections afforded to ministers of religion. The committee also rejected the proposal to allow civil celebrants to refuse to perform same-sex weddings on the basis of [...] "conscientious belief", declaring {{there was no need to}} [...] "disturb decades of anti-discrimination law and practice in Australia".|$|R

In addition, the legal position is complicated by the fact that the latter Act not only allows both heterosexual and homosexual couples to conclude a civil union, but also provides that a civil union may take the form <b>of</b> either a <b>marriage</b> or a civil partnership, both of which enjoy the same legal recognition as, and give rise to the same legal consequences, as a civil marriage under the Marriage Act. In January 2008, a draft Domestic Partnerships Bill saw the light of day, the potential enactment of which casts significant doubt as to whether the prevailing framework should be retained. With this potential development in mind, this paper considers the desirability of maintaining the "separate but equal" status quo by: (a) comparing the South African Law Reform Commission's pre-Civil Union Act proposals with the approach eventually adopted by the legislature; (b) comparing and contrasting the post-Civil Union Act position in South Africa with that of an established and wellordered jurisdiction such as the Netherlands and, in the light hereof, considering the cases for and against repealing the Civil Union Act; and (c) by considering the desirability and practicality of the civil partnership's potential co-existence with the Domestic Partnerships Bill (as modified in accordance with a recent study). A proposal is made that could provide a less complex and better streamlined family law dispensation in South Africa...|$|R

40|$|During the pre-constitutional era, a civil <b>marriage</b> {{in terms}} <b>of</b> the <b>Marriage</b> Act 25 <b>of</b> 1961 between two {{heterosexual}} persons {{was the only}} family form recognised by South African law. The common-law definition <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> did not make provision for same-sex marriage and consequently deprived same-sex couples of certain benefits that accrue to married couples. The introduction of a new constitutional order with the constitutional commitment to human dignity and equality and the inclusion of sexual orientation as a {{prohibited ground of discrimination}} in terms of section 9 (3) of the Constitution, created a fertile ground for homosexuals to question the validity and constitutionality of the common law definition <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> and certain statutes that excluded them from recognition during the pre-constitutional dispensation. This led to the recognition of same-sex life partnerships and, inevitably, same-sex <b>marriage</b> by means <b>of</b> a Civil Union Act 17 of 2006. The object {{of this study was to}} investigate whether and to what extent there are grounds to consider the Civil Union Act unconstitutional. The constitutional inquiry will include a critical analysis of the effect of the Act on the constitutional rights of same-sex couples. The main issue will be whether the Act achieved what the Constitutional Court in Minister of Home Affair v Fourie 2006 1 SA 542 (CC) required the legislator to do, namely to afford same-sex couples the same status, benefits and responsibilities accorded to opposite-sex couples. This investigation is conducted with reference to relevant legislation, comments of various authors and case law. The dissertation concludes by recommending that both heterosexual couples and same-sex couples should be provided with a single statute to formalise their marriage. In this regard, it is suggested that a repeal of the Civil Union Act with a concomitant expansion <b>of</b> the <b>Marriage</b> Act to accommodate the <b>solemnisation</b> and registration <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> for both heterosexual and same-sex couples should be the preferred option. The Marriage Act should be secular in nature and should include the registration of domestic partnerships. Mini Dissertation (LLM) [...] University of Pretoria, 2016. Private LawLLMUnrestricte...|$|R
