We usually have Big Jim Wright sit in on those kind of sessions to work out the chords. he wasn't there so I had to work on the chord myself. So I was playing and there was a part where I said 'Man, what chord am I <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> here?' and Mariah has such a good ear that she sang me the chord.|$|E
5|$|Homer {{introduces}} {{himself and}} Bart to Kashmir, who is preoccupied with getting on stage for her performance, though she understands what Homer {{is trying to}} get through for his son. Without knowing it, Homer accidentally finds himself on stage at the burlesque show. Homer is about to be thrown offstage when the audience recognize him from the picture. The audience applauds and Homer gets caught up in the fanfare and starts dancing with the showgirls, until he sees Bart and realizes what he is <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Homer stops the show and successfully manages to make a plea to the audience to treat women with respect. Marge, who is in the audience, accepts Homer's apology and the two make up.|$|E
5|$|Hardboiled had no {{specific}} {{goal for the}} Allies, other than to convince the Germans of an imminent invasion threat against Norway. Clarke had already established that deception operations should have {{a clear idea of}} what the enemy was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> (rather than what they were expected to think). Stanley was unaware of this, not being in communication with Clarke's department in Cairo. As a result, the objective for Hardboiled was chosen because the resources existed and it would not affect real future operations (planners had already rejected Norway as a viable target), rather than for any strategic advantage it brought the Allies. Stanley was also unaware of the extensive double agent network {{under the control of the}} Twenty Committee, having merely been told that MI5 had an avenue through which to pass information to the enemy.|$|E

5|$|Juliet {{arrives at}} an airport with her sister, where Richard Alpert and Ethan Rom are there to escort her {{the rest of the}} way. Juliet says good-bye to her sister, Rachel, {{promising}} to be back before her baby is born. In the airport terminal, Alpert pours sedative into a glass of orange juice and gives it to Juliet to drink, explaining that the trip is very intense. Juliet is wary of drinking the juice, even though she is okay with the other circumstances surrounding the trip. Alpert interrupts and tells her the place she is going is very special and that she has a gift with which she is <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something significant. Juliet drinks the orange juice and passes out. She wakes up in a submarine with her arms and waist strapped down for safety.|$|E

25|$|A {{prominent}} {{minister of}} the time, Thomas Parker, was also against the idea of women writing and {{sent a letter to}} his own sister saying that publishing a book was outside of the realm of what women were <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> No doubt he was opposed to the writing of Bradstreet as well. These negative views were likely augmented by the fact that Puritan ideologies stated that women were vastly inferior to men.|$|E
25|$|According to West, he was {{originally}} <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{the voice of}} both Ren and Stimpy (and performed both characters on the tape {{that was used to}} sell the show to Nickelodeon), but then Kricfalusi decided to do the voice of Ren himself once the show was sold and he had West on board as part of the selling point. However, West provided Ren's maniacal laughter when John Kricfalusi was the voice of Ren.|$|E
25|$|Procedural {{programming}} {{could be}} considered a step towards declarative programming. A programmer can often tell, simply by looking at the names, arguments, and return types of procedures (and related comments), what a particular procedure is <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> without necessarily looking at the details of how it achieves its result. At the same time, a complete program is still imperative since it fixes the statements to be executed and their order of execution to a large extent.|$|E

25|$|Herbert began researching Dune in 1959. He {{was able}} to devote himself wholeheartedly to his writing career because his wife {{returned}} to work full-time as an advertising writer for department stores, becoming the breadwinner during the 1960s. He later told Willis E. McNelly that the novel originated when he was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a magazine article on sand dunes in the Oregon Dunes near Florence, Oregon. He became too involved and ended up with far more raw material than needed for an article. The article was never written, but instead planted the seed that led to Dune.|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{rather than}} {{treating}} the essay as an honest {{analysis of a}} painful, complex issue, critics accused the AJC of stifling the debate. Such hysteria makes intellectuals look spoiled, thin-skinned and brittle. Best-selling authors like Noam Chomsky or billionaires like George Soros ritualistically applaud their own bravery and pretend they are lonely voices when joining the trendy intellectual pile-on against Israel. How it {{is that people who}} viciously criticize Israel and Zionism, who lecture the Jewish world about tolerating diverse opinions, suddenly cannot stomach vigorous debate when they are criticized? Nothing in the AJC essay advocates hate laws, suppressing free speech, shunning, or any other intimidation. Professor Rosenfeld did what thinkers are <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> – identify, catalogue, analyze, explain, and challenge.|$|E

500|$|Savides' first {{experience}} with the Viper Filmstream camera was shooting a Motorola commercial with Fincher. From there, he used it on Zodiac. Fincher {{wanted to make sure}} that the camera was more inclined towards film production so that the studio would be more comfortable about using it on a project with a large budget. To familiarize himself with the camera, he [...] "did as many things 'wrong' as I possibly could. I went against everything I was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the camera." [...] Savides felt comfortable with the camera after discovering its limitations.|$|E
500|$|The {{gameplay}} did {{not escape}} criticism, however, with Tom Chick of IGN criticising {{the layout of}} the levels: [...] "The levels can be awfully linear, throwing you up against some frustrating brick walls where you don't know where to go or what you're <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> next. There are some bald key hunts." [...] The artificial intelligence of hostile NPCs received mixed reactions. GameSpot's Ron Dulin praised the AI, saying that they help the suspension of disbelief. Chi Kong Lui of Gamecritics.com, however, gave the opposite view: [...] "Enemy artificial intelligence is still pretty mindless and blasting them doesn't require much skill." ...|$|E

I got so frightened my heart fell in my shoe. When he finally walked away, the director yelled 'Cut' and I had to take a long breather. But I could really relate to the lion.

500|$|Taborn's first {{recording}} {{as leader}} came in 1994, {{and was released}} by DIW. Craig Taborn Trio, with bassist Jaribu Shahid and drummer Tani Tabbal, featured Taborn playing {{in a range of}} styles on piano and included several of his own compositions. At this stage in his career, his comments on his tastes in composition and performance were: [...] "Even though I like avant garde jazz and classical music, I like to swing. I like to work with harmony and melody in my own music, and I like acoustical instruments. But I can be quite dictatorial about the composed section, and lay down in great detail what everyone is <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> and how they should do it." ...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{appealing}} and fundamental aspects of Literate Programming is the change of perspective towards the reader.
