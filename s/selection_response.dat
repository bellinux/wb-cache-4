The comparison was done both in replicated tanks (separate rearing) and in mixed tanks (mixed rearing) where sire origins were recovered by genotyping of eight microsatellite markers. Weight, length and growth rate were measured from day 238 post-fertilization (69 g mean weight) to day 611 post-fertilization (390 g mean weight). Both in mixed and separate tanks, both selected groups (P, M) were larger than unselected groups (W, D). No difference was seen at any time between W and D, nor between M and P. The <b>selection</b> <b>response</b> estimate on weight was larger in mixed tanks when compared to separate tanks (+ 42 % in mixed tanks, + 23 % in separate tanks at day 611), yielding realized heritability estimates of 0. 60 and 0. 34, respectively, and confirming the excellent potential of the species for growth improvement through selective breeding.

A control line from the same base population, dwarf and segregating for the NA gene, was maintained during the selection experiment under random mating. The average clutch length was normalized using a Box-Cox transformation. Genetic variability and <b>selection</b> <b>response</b> were estimated either with the mixed model methodology, or with the classical methods for calculating genetic gain, as the deviation from the control line, and the realized heritability, as the ratio of the <b>selection</b> <b>response</b> on cumulative selection differentials. Heritability of average clutch length was estimated to be 0. 42 ± 0. 02, with a multiple trait animal model, whereas the estimates of the realized heritability were lower, being 0. 28 and 0. 22 in lines L 1 and L 2, respectively. REML estimates of heritability were found to decline with generations of selection, suggesting a departure from the infinitesimal model, either because a limited number of genes was involved, or their frequencies were changed. The yearly genetic gains in average clutch length, after normalization, were estimated to be 0. 37 ± 0. 02 and 0. 33 ± 0. 04 with the classical methods, 0. 46 ± 0. 02 and 0. 43 ± 0. 01 with animal model methodology, for lines L 1 and L 2 respectively, which represented about 30 % of the genetic standard deviation on the transformed scale. <b>Selection</b> <b>response</b> appeared to be faster in line L 2, homozygous for the NA gene, but the final cumulated <b>selection</b> <b>response</b> for clutch length was not different between the L 1 and L 2 lines at generation 16. </p...|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{aquaculture}} and captive breeding have commenced for a raft {{of large}} fish species, including bluefin tuna (Thunnus orientalis), kingfish (Seriola lalandi) and giant grouper (Epinephelus lanceolatus). With captive breeding, there is often interest to conduct selection and genetic improvement, but these large species present many and substantial challenges to selective breeding. Indeed there are no reports or examples that <b>selection</b> <b>response</b> and forward genetic gain has been achieved for such large and problematic species. These large species, typified by kingfish, are characterized by immense fecundity with ensuing opportunity for intense domestication selection, either adverse or synergistic, that can impact on planned <b>selection</b> <b>response.</b> Moreover, because of size and logistics, typically few broodstock are held and chance sampling of few broodstock individuals {{has the potential to}} confound <b>selection</b> <b>response</b> and the repeatability of response. The main objective here was to assess if forward <b>selection</b> <b>response</b> could be achieved after selection for adult weight of kingfish in sea cages. <b>Selection</b> <b>response</b> was estimated by comparing the performance of F 1 offspring from wild parents with F 2 offspring from selected parents during the larval rearing and adult growout. Pedigree data, from genotyping approximately 1000 individuals using up to 17 DNA microsatellite loci, was added to the larval and adult performance data to resolve the contributions of different sire and dam lineages. For most traits measured, whether larval survival, incidence of larval deformity, adult weights or adult condition factor, the offspring of selected parents outperformed those from wild parents, whether animals were grown separately in replicate (larval rearing tanks) or communally as adults in tanks. Larval survival was not deliberated selected, yet the dropout of specific parental sire or dam lineages suggest in part genetic differences account for some {{of the differences between the}} F 1 and F 2. Observed selection responses for adult weights and condition factor were greater than those predicted from covariances of relatives. Either (synergistic) domestication selection or some type of magnification of line differences under communal rearing may account for these data. The chance sampling of particularly good or bad broodstock sires or dams did not seem to have been a major contributor to the strain testing results. Whether this means that selection responses are repeatable even when using few broodstock, a situation unavoidable for large marine species, is discussed in terms of how intense deliberate and possible domestication selection could narrow the variances of breeding values of selected broodstoc...|$|E

The overall breeding goal included traits for production, reproduction, and parasite resilience and resistance to ensure a balanced selection outcome. The production traits were BW and dressing percentage (DP). The reproduction trait was fertility (FER), which {{was the number of}} doe kiddings per mating. The resistance trait was worm fecal egg count (FEC), which is a measurement of the number of gastro-intestinal parasite eggs found in the feces. The resilience trait was the packed cell volume (PCV), which is a measurement of the volume of red blood cells in the blood. Dressing percentage, BW, and FEC were measured at 11 mo of age, which is the mating or selling age. Fertility and PCV were measured on females at each kidding period. The breeding program accounting for the overall breeding goal and a selection index including all traits gave annual <b>selection</b> <b>responses</b> of 800 g for BW, 3. 75 % for FER, 0. 08 % for DP, − 0. 005 ln(eggs/g) for FEC, and 0. 28 % for PCV.

40|$|Background The genetic {{architecture}} of a quantitative trait influences the phenotypic response to natural or artificial selection. One {{of the main}} objectives of genetic mapping studies is to identify the genetic factors underlying complex traits and understand how they contribute to phenotypic expression. Presently, we are good at identifying and locating individual loci with large effects, {{but there is a}} void in describing more complex genetic architectures. Although large networks of connected genes have been reported, there is an almost complete lack of information on how polymorphisms in these networks contribute to phenotypic variation and change. To date, most of our understanding comes from theoretical, model-based studies, and it remains difficult to assess how realistic their conclusions are as they lack empirical support. Results A previous study provided evidence that nearly half of the difference in eight-week body weight between two divergently selected lines of chickens was a result of four loci organized in a 'radial' network (one central locus interacting with three 'radial' loci that, in turn, only interacted with the central locus). Here, we study the relationship between phenotypic change and genetic polymorphism in this empirically detected network. We use a model-free approach to study, through individual-based simulations, the dynamic properties of this polymorphic and epistatic genetic architecture. The study provides new insights to how epistasis can modify the <b>selection</b> <b>response,</b> buffer and reveal effects of major loci leading to a progressive release of genetic variation. We also illustrate the difficulty of predicting genetic architecture from observed <b>selection</b> <b>response,</b> and discuss mechanisms that might lead to misleading conclusions on underlying genetic architectures from quantitative trait locus (QTL) experiments in selected populations.

40|$|Abstract Some {{analytical}} and simulated criteria {{were used to}} determine whether a priori genetic differences among groups, which are not accounted for by the relationship matrix, ought to be fitted in models for genetic evaluation, depending on the data structure and the accuracy of the evaluation. These criteria were the mean square error of some extreme contrasts between animals, the true genetic superiority of animals selected across groups, i. e. the <b>selection</b> <b>response,</b> and the magnitude of selection bias (difference between true and predicted selection responses). The different statistical models studied considered either fixed or random genetic groups (based on six different years of birth) versus ignoring the genetic group effects in a sire model. Including fixed genetic groups led to an overestimation of <b>selection</b> <b>response</b> under BLUP selection across groups despite the unbiasedness of the estimation, i. e. despite the correct estimation of differences between genetic groups. This overestimation was extremely important in numerical applications which considered two kinds of within-station progeny test designs for French purebred beef cattle AI sire evaluation across years: the reference sire design and the repeater sire design. When assuming a priori genetic differences due to the existence of a genetic trend of around 20 % of genetic standard deviation for a trait with h 2 = 0. 4, in a repeater sire design, the overestimation of the genetic superiority of bulls selected across groups varied from about 10 % for an across-year selection rate p = 1 / 6 and an accurate selection index (100 progeny records per sire) to 75 % for p = 1 / 2 and a less accurate selection index (20 progeny records per sire). This overestimation decreased when the genetic trend, the heritability of the trait, the accuracy of the evaluation or the connectedness of the design increased. Whatever the data design, a model of genetic evaluation without groups was preferred to a model with genetic groups when the genetic trend was in the range of likely values in cattle breeding programs (0 to 20 % of genetic standard deviation). In such a case, including random groups was pointless and including fixed groups led to a large overestimation of <b>selection</b> <b>response,</b> smaller true <b>selection</b> <b>response</b> across groups and larger variance of estimation of the differences between groups. Although the genetic trend was correctly predicted by a model fitting fixed genetic groups, important errors in predicting individual breeding values led to incorrect ranking of animals across groups and, consequently, led to lower <b>selection</b> <b>response.</b> </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{heritability}} as generally used, involves {{the assumption that}} additive genetic variance is a constant proportion of total variance over {{the entire range of}} phenotypes. If this assumption holds, <b>selection</b> <b>response</b> will be linearly related to selection differential.

In the field of applied animal breeding, for example, this will affect such important questions as the increase in rate of genetic improvement to be expected from the use of artificial insemination. Milk production records from 5740 first lactation dam-daughter pairs were studied to determine if the heritable fraction of total variation is related to selection differential. Heritability was essentially constant over the entire range of phenotypic variability, there being no evidence for curvilinearity of the offspring-parent regression line.

Results A previous study provided evidence that nearly half of the difference in eight-week body weight between two divergently selected lines of chickens was a result of four loci organized in a 'radial' network (one central locus interacting with three 'radial' loci that, in turn, only interacted with the central locus). Here, we study the relationship between phenotypic change and genetic polymorphism in this empirically detected network. We use a model-free approach to study, through individual-based simulations, the dynamic properties of this polymorphic and epistatic genetic architecture. The study provides new insights to how epistasis can modify the <b>selection</b> <b>response,</b> buffer and reveal effects of major loci leading to a progressive release of genetic variation. We also illustrate the difficulty of predicting genetic architecture from observed <b>selection</b> <b>response,</b> and discuss mechanisms that might lead to misleading conclusions on underlying genetic architectures from quantitative trait locus (QTL) experiments in selected populations. Conclusion Considering both molecular (QTL) and phenotypic (<b>selection</b> <b>response)</b> data, as suggested in this work, provides additional insights into the genetic mechanisms involved in the response to selection. Such dissection of genetic architectures and in-depth studies of their ability to contribute to short- or long-term <b>selection</b> <b>response</b> represents an important step towards {{a better understanding of the}} genetic bases of complex traits and, consequently, of the evolutionary properties of populations. </p...|$|E
40|$|Personality {{has been}} {{associated}} with reproductive success in humans and other animals, suggesting potential evolutionary selection pressures. However, studies to date have only examined these associations on a phenotypic level, which may be inadequate in estimating evolutionary change. Using a large longitudinal twin dataset of contemporary Finns, we compared the phenotypic (breeder’s equation) and genetically informed (the Robertson–Price identity) associations between lifetime reproductive success (LRS) and two personality traits—neuroticism and extraversion. Neuroticism was not associated with LRS at the phenotypic nor genetic level, while extraversion was associated with higher LRS in men both phenotypically and genetically. Compared to the univariate phenotypic analysis, the genetic analysis suggested a larger <b>selection</b> <b>response</b> of extraversion, and a <b>selection</b> <b>response</b> of neuroticism due to indirect selection. We estimated that neuroticism decreases by. 05 standard deviations and extraversion increases by. 11 standard deviations by one generation. Our results highlight the importance of considering genetic associations between personality and fitness and investigating several inter-related personality traits and their covariance with each other to predict responses to selection more accurately...|$|E
40|$|It is well {{established}} that we can pick up action effect associations when acting in a free-choice intentional mode. However, it is less clear whether and when action effect associations are learnt and actually affect behavior if we are acting in a forced-choice mode, applying a specific stimulus-response (S-R) rule. In the present study, we investigated whether <b>response</b> <b>selection</b> difficulty imposed by S-R rules influences the initial rapid learning and the behavioral expression of previously learnt but weakly practiced action effect associations when those are re-activated by effect exposure. Experiment 1 showed that the rapid acquisition of action effect associations is not directly influenced by <b>response</b> <b>selection</b> difficulty. By contrast, the behavioral expression of re-activated action effect associations is prevented when actions are directly activated by highly over-learnt response cues and thus <b>response</b> <b>selection</b> difficulty is low. However, all three experiments showed that if <b>response</b> <b>selection</b> difficulty is sufficiently high during re-activation, the same action effect associations do influence behavior. Experiment 2 and 3 revealed {{that the effect of}} <b>response</b> <b>selection</b> difficulty cannot be fully reduced to giving action effects more time to prime an action, but seems to reflect competition during <b>response</b> <b>selection.</b> Finally, the present data suggest that when multiple novel rules are rapidly learnt in succession, which requires a lot of flexibility, action effect associations continue to influence behavior only if <b>response</b> <b>selection</b> difficulty is sufficiently high. Thus, <b>response</b> <b>selection</b> difficulty might modulate the impact of experiencing multiple learning episodes on action effect expression and learning, possibly via inducing different strategies...|$|R
40|$|Research on {{automatic}} behavior has shown how social category priming can activate unique responses toward such categories. Recently, {{the importance of}} the context in which social category members are perceived has been demonstrated for the <b>response</b> <b>selection</b> process. While <b>response</b> <b>selection</b> has been investigated, other dependent variables, such as visual attention processes, have yet not been tested. In line with top-down perception theories, visual attention {{plays an important role in}} <b>response</b> <b>selection.</b> The attention processes that precede <b>response</b> <b>selection</b> in social encounters remain unclear, namely which functional means are focused on to determine a response proper. We conducted two gaze-tracking studies in order to test how attention for context cues is influenced by changing environments. Our results show that context also determined attention to functional means for the behavioral response. Our study provides first evidence that contextualized social category primes affect visual attention for response functional means...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{set out to}} {{test the}} {{prediction}} of the dual-route <b>response</b> <b>selection</b> account of the Simon effect, which maintains that the Simon effect, and its facilitation and interference components, should {{show up at the}} <b>response</b> <b>selection</b> stage irrespective of when it takes place during processing. Previous works have shown {{that in the case of}} a movement response, two strategies can be adopted for responding. The main difference between these two response strategies consists of when <b>response</b> <b>selection</b> operations take place. The two experiments reported in the present study showed that when <b>response</b> <b>selection</b> operates clearly before movement initiations, the Simon effect shows up in reaction time and not in movement time...|$|R
