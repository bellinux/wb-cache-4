40|$|The latest legal {{requirements}} call to an increasing degree of purification for plastics, for both virgin and recycled material. Abidance {{by the law}} demands new processing technologies for purifying plastics. The extraction with supercritical carbon dioxide could be an approach. Supercritical carbon dioxide {{is characterized by a}} high diffusion coefficient, a low viscosity and a high density. These properties are determining the outstanding solubility in scCO 2 even for higher molecular substances. Furthermore CO 2 is non flammable, ecologically safe, inexpensive and non toxic. One disadvantage of CO 2 is its low polarity and thus its low solubility for polar substances. The polarity of the extracting agent can be influenced specifically by dosing additional cosolvents like methanol in scCO 2. Carbon dioxide also is a gas which causes the greenhouse effect and should therefore be recycled. The usage of scCO 2 as an extracting agent in a twin screw extruder offers high potential for decreasing the amount of contaminations in the polymer melt. The extraction process is examined in the present paper for cleaning polymer melts. Main objective of the extraction is to remove foreign substances as monomers, solvent residues, processing aids and contaminations, which are diffusing into the interior material by using the plastics. These contaminations are dispersed or dissolved in the polymer. The applicability of a twin screw extruder for purifying polymer melt is analysed for both virgin material (two types of polyamide 12) to remove monomers and specifically contaminated high density polyethylene. To implement the extraction process on a twin screw extruder the compounding process has to be modified regarding this process technology, {{in order to keep the}} CO 2 in its overcritical state at high pressures > 75 bar. This is an additional requirement for common twin screw extruders. Pressure tightness was achieved by using a copper sealing in combination with a <b>sealing</b> <b>paste.</b> For dimensioning the extruder for extraction purposes, the processing unit should feature few linkage points. Besides the pressure tightness of the extruder the screw configuration has to be determined and optimised. A reflow zone following the zone for the CO 2 -outlet is proved to provide the possibility for the carbon dioxide, which is swept away with the polymer, to flow against the polymer flow back to the CO 2 outlet. After elaborating a sufficient process for taking samples, dependences of different processing parameters the extraction effect were researched. In general the highest extraction effect can be realised by increasing pressure, screw speed, processing temperature and the CO 2 -flow. Contrary to this an increased temperature level results in charred melt and a high CO 2 flow has a negative effect on the economy of the extraction process. The integration of a degassing unit and a counter flow process were also investigated. To do so an extruder cascade is inevitable due to safety reasons. Furthermore the extruder cascade facilitates stable processing conditions and simplified process control. Regarding the counter flow processing, the used screw configuration is inappropriate. Due to this improvement of the screw design is inevitable. Industry is reluctant using supercritical fluids despite of the considerable advantages. Reasons for the scepticism can be found in the high investment cost al well as using hegh pressure processing technology. However the increasing relevance of {{legal requirements}} and the progressive development will promote this technology...|$|E

The majority of mandibular canines have one root and root canal, but 15 % may have two canals and a smaller number may have two distinct roots. The following clinical reports describe endodontic treatment of mandibular canines with two roots and two root canals. Outline of Cases. Four clinical case reports are presented to exemplify anatomical variation in the human mandibular canine. Detailed analysis of the preoperative radiographs and careful examination of the pulp chamber floor detected the presence of two root canal orifices in all canines.

40|$|High-performance {{cementitious}} {{materials are}} sensitive to early age cracking, mainly due to the large magnitude of autogenous shrinkage, which {{is closely related to}} the internal relative humidity (RH) decrease and capillary pressure induced by self-desiccation in the cement matrix.

40|$|Alkali silica {{reaction}} (ASR), {{a reaction}} which occurs between reactive siliceous mineral {{components in the}} aggregate and the alkaline pore solution in concrete, is responsible for substantial damage to concrete structures in the U. S. and across the world. Lithium admixtures, including lithium nitrate (LiNO 3), have been demonstrated to mitigate ASR damage, and are of particular interest for use in concrete airfield pavement construction, where ASR damage has been recently linked {{to the use of}} certain de-icing chemicals. Although the effectiveness of lithium admixtures at ASR-mitigation is well-researched, relatively less is known regarding the potential effects, including negative effects, on overall concrete behavior. The goal of this research is to better understand the influence of LiNO 3 admixture on early age concrete behavior, and to determine if a maximum dosage rate for its use exists. 	Isothermal calorimetry, rheology and bleed water testing, time of setting, chemical shrinkage, autogenous shrinkage, free and restrained concrete shrinkage, and compressive and flexural strength were measured for pastes and concretes prepared with a range of LiNO 3 dosages (i. e., 0, 50, 100, 200, and 400 % of the recommended dosage). In addition, the interaction of LiNO 3 with cement was evaluated by comparing results obtained with six cements of varying alkali and tricalcium aluminate (C 3 A) contents. Additionally, one of these cements, was examined alone and with 20 % by weight Class F fly ash replacement. 	Results indicate that the hydration of the tricalcium silicate and tricalcium aluminate components of cement are accelerated by the use of LiNO 3, and that low alkali cements (typically specified to avoid damage by ASR) may be particularly susceptible to this acceleration. However, inclusion of Class F fly ash at 20 % by weight replacement of cement (also common in applications where ASR is a concern) appears to diminish these possibly negative effects of LiNO 3 on early age hydration acceleration and heat generation. Dosages higher than the current standard dosage of LiNO 3 may have minor effects on fresh concrete workability, causing slight decreases in Bingham yield stress, corresponding to slightly higher slump. Fresh concrete viscosity may also be affected, though more research is necessary to confirm this effect. LiNO 3 had no effect on quantity of bleed water in the mixes tested. Generally, LiNO 3 had no effect on initial and final setting times, although increasing dosages caused faster set times in the lowest alkali (Na 2 Oeq = 0. 295 %) cement examined. In shrinkage testing, higher LiNO 3 dosages appeared to cause initial expansion in some <b>sealed</b> <b>paste</b> specimens, but in all cases the highest dosage led to greater autogenous shrinkage after 40 days. In concrete specimens, however, the restraining effect of aggregates diminished shrinkage, and no effect of the LiNO 3 was apparent. In no cases, with any dosage of lithium tested, with or without fly ash replacement, did restrained shrinkage specimens show any cracking. Strength testing produced mixed results, with laboratory specimens increasing in 28 -day compressive strength, but companion specimens cast in the field and tested by an outside laboratory, exhibited lower 28 -day compressive strength, with increasing lithium dosages. Flexural specimens, also cast in the field and tested by an outside laboratory, appeared to show an increase in 28 -day flexural strength with increasing lithium dosages. However, because of the conflicting results when comparing the various strength data, further research is necessary for conclusive evidence of LiNO 3 effects on concrete strength. M. S.
