In view of the cost-efficiency and abundant <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> in China, more and more Hong Kong organizations have set up software development labs in China {{in the form of}} wholly-owned establishments or joint ventures. Due to different environmental factors, there are differences in software project management issues in China and Hong Kong. This study focuses on two variables that impact the success of a project: software development management practices and organizational factors. Through a questionnaire survey, we have identified a list of good management practices adopted in the two regions. We have also developed a list of organizational factors that affect the adoption of management practices. The adoption of management practices and differences in organizational factors in the two regions are then compared against those of European countries. In view of the growing importance and close connection of software industries in both regions, this study contributes {{to a better understanding of}} project management issues in an organizational context.

40|$|Objective: To {{document}} the organisational response of Furness General Hospital {{to the large}} outbreak of legionnaire’s disease in April 2002 and assess the contribution made by the hospital’s major incident plan. Method: Qualitative analysis of interview transcripts and written comments from some staff involved {{in the management of}} the incident. Documentary analysis of major incident plan and other written materials. Results: The incident posed considerable managerial and clinical problems and this paper describes how they were overcome. In particular, strategies for dealing with <b>supply</b> (<b>of</b> <b>staff,</b> beds, and resources) and managing demand (by liaising with primary care and the public) seem to have been successful. Many functions necessary for managing the incident were poorly dealt with in the plan, especially procedures for handling the news media and liaison with agencies outside the hospital. Lack of explicit guidance appeared not to hinder the organisational response. There may have been an unspoken high level decision to allow staff to draw on their skills and experience in improvising a response to the initial challenge and learning adaptively as the incident unfolded. There was also evidence that staff disregarded existing job and role boundaries and focused instead on tasks, working flexibly to ensure that these tasks were completed. Conclusions: Protracted major incidents pose particular management challenges and may benefit from an approach different from that set out in typical major incident plans. Staff must be able to act flexibly and responsively. Some form of checklist or toolkit may be preferable to a detailed plan for some types of incident...|$|E

This study primarily focuses on the T&D initiatives undertaken to facilitate organizational development of the company. This report points out the existing conditions regarding employee training, problems and possible solutions for improving employee development initiatives for the company. The report also emphasizes on relating generally accepted theories and models of training to actual existing T&D processes in the organization. This report partly focuses on HR policy component and as it is a confidential issue, discussion about the policies are omitted. The report also derives the employee satisfaction level of T & D based on HQ. As BI just began its journey in 2009, they are new in international arena.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{examines}} {{issues related}} to the future <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> registered nursing <b>staff,</b> midwives and health visitors in the National Health Service (NHS) in England {{at a time when there}} are major public sector funding constraints and as more <b>of</b> these <b>staff</b> are reaching retirement age. Based on available workforce data, the paper reviews different possible scenarios for the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> NHS nurses over a ten year period, assessing the impact of different numbers <b>of</b> new <b>staff</b> being trained and of varying retirement patterns from the ageing profession. The government in England has more policy levers available than is the case in many other countries. It determines the number of pre-registration training places that are commissioned and funded, it is the major employer, and it also controls the inflow of nurses from other countries through migration policies. Scenario models provide a picture of what the future might look like under various assumptions. These outcomes can be quantified and the results used to assess the risks and opportunities of alternate policy decisions. The approach used in this paper is that of the aggregate deterministic supply model. As part of this exercise, eight scenarios were selected and modelled. These were: A. “No change”- current inflows and outflows B. “Redundancies” - current inflow with higher outflow C. “Improved retention” - current inflow with lower outflow D. “Reduced training intakes A” - lower inflows with lower outflow E. “Reduced training intakes B” - lower inflow with higher outflows F. “Pension time-bomb”- current inflow with a higher rate of retirement G. “Pension delayed”- current inflow with a lower rate of retirement H. “Worst case” - lower inflow and higher outflow including higher retirement Most of the scenarios indicate that a reduction in the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> nursing <b>staff</b> to NHS England is possible over the next ten years. Small changes in assumptions can make a substantial difference to outcomes and therefore emphasize the point that it is unwise to base policy decisions on a single projection. It is important that different scenarios are considered that may be regarded as possible futures, based on a realistic assessment of the available workforce data, policies and broader labour market and funding outlook. </p...|$|R
