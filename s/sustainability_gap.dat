If the composite S0 indicator is above 0.43, it signals existence of too high risk for fiscal stress in the short-term, which call on implementation of immediate counter measures. If the fiscal gap indicators S1 and/or S2 indicators are positive, it means debt levels are forecast to become unsustainable in the medium-term and/or long-term under a no-policy-change assumption, because of increasing public expenditures caused by demographic factors. If such S1 or S2 sustainability issues arise, {{they are to be}} addressed through implementation of fiscal consolidation leading to sufficient annual improvements for the structural budget balance and/or by increasing the sustainability of pensions, health care and social benefits systems through the following expenditure saving reforms: ...|$|E

40|$|EU taxes play a {{key role}} in {{political}} and economic discussions about the future of the EU own resource system, and their desirability can vary accordingly. It is therefore essential to clearly articulate the goals which are to be achieved by the introduction of this new financing tool. This paper provides a critical overview of advantages and disadvantages of EU taxes. Reviewing the conventional fiscal federalism and political economy literature on this topic it can be concluded that there is no obvious (overall) case for funding the EU budget with EU taxes rather than with contributions by Member States which currently make up for the lion’s share of EU own resources. There are, however, some specific issues arising from a sustainability perspective, which could be addressed with the introduction of EU taxes. Departing from a comprehensive concept of sustainability, which is based on the economic, the social, the environmental and the cultural/institutional pillar of sustainability, the paper reviews <b>sustainability</b> <b>gaps</b> in taxation in the EU. EU taxes if designed accordingly may be suitable instruments to reduce these <b>sustainability</b> <b>gaps.</b> The paper also develops criteria based on the four dimensions of sustainability that may be used in a next step to evaluate potential candidates for EU taxes.

40|$|One of {{the most}} serious criticisms of the status quo with respect to the EU budget {{represents}} the lack of a link between the EU policy and the system of own resources. Strengthening the link between reaching smart, sustainable and inclusive growth and the EU system of own resources by introducing tax-based own resources could contribute to decrease the existing <b>sustainability</b> <b>gaps</b> in taxation in the European Union. This research demonstrates that the introduction of the Common (Consolidated) Corporate Tax Base (hereinafter as C(C) CTB) could be an important contribution to close the existing <b>sustainability</b> <b>gaps</b> in tax regimes in the EU. To research the revenue potential of the C(C) CTB, a model based on a remittance system was designed. The system foresees the replacement of the VAT-based own resource (resp. GNI-based own resource) through the transfer of a part of the corporate tax revenues based on the C(C) CTB raised on the national level to the EU budget. The results of the research show that the C(C) CTB-based own resource would be able to fully replace the VAT-based own resource, with the only exception of Cyprus. However, the C(C) CTB-based own resource cannot be considered to be a sufficient resource to fully replace the GNI-base own resource. Therefore, we recommend C(C) CTB only in connection with the replacement of the VAT-based own resource. FairTa...|$|R
40|$|There are two {{principle}} {{approaches for}} measuring the “sustainability gap”, the indi-cator and the accounting approach. The <b>sustainability</b> <b>gap</b> indicates how far {{the present state of}} a society differs from a situation that meets the requirements of the sustainability paradigm. Work on sustainable development indicator sets (SDI) is usually carried out more or less independently from the accounting work. In this paper it is argued that linking these two approaches could yield considerable synergies. The indicator approach describes the <b>sustainability</b> <b>gap</b> by a selected number of issu-es considered to be most relevant under a sustainability perspective. The selection of the indicators is based on facts and value judgements. In order to establish broad acceptance of the SDI as being suitable for describing the state of the society objectively, a consensus about the underlying value judgements has to be found among the major protagonists. Ideally all indicators are linked to quantitative development goals. In that case the diffe-rence between the present development and the goal indicates the <b>sustainability</b> <b>gap</b> for an individual indicator and subsequently the need for action.

Geographic information systems (GIS) and statistical analyses used data derived from documents, statistical records, publications, on-site inspections and field research. The key cities were divided into seven groups based on eight environmental indicators.

Longevity adjustment of pension benefits and introduction of an NDC pension system would reduce the expected problem and narrow the <b>sustainability</b> <b>gap</b> distribution.

40|$|Most {{countries}} in the European Union are facing a structural deterioration of their public budget {{as a result of}} the financial and economic crisis. The European Commission (2009) projects an average structural deficit for 2010 of 4. 7 % for the euro area and a corresponding figure of 5. 5 % for the entire EU. 2 Actual deficits are generally higher due to the negative output gaps. Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and the UK all feature double digit deficit figures. Further, virtually all EU countries are on exploding debt paths if policies do not change. By 2060, Greece, Latvia and Ireland would all have debt ratios of over 800 % of GDP, a number that in reality would of course never be reached as those countries would be forced into default long before reaching those levels.

Hence the current study is saying that environmental management systems are not strategic; while they tend to reactively fix issues contingent upon their occurrence and may miss opportunities to avoid problems before they occur. Further, environmental management itself is seen in isolation of a socio-ecological context, which makes environmental management lose ground and operate in a virtual vacuum. The current study shows about the way of sustainability integration into environmental management systems directed by those possibilities. In the current analysis of the study, a framework for strategic sustainable development (FSSD) and other methods integrating “backcasting from principles of sustainability” – has been used.

40|$|AbstractAt the Rio+ 20 Conference in 2012, the United Nations {{declared}} that a “green {{economy in the}} context of sustainable development” is a chance for economic development in the institutional framework of sustainable development [1]. The German Government supports the UN approach for a green economy [2]. We intend to analyse German society and its CLEW systems (climate, land, energy and water) because the UN defined the latter as key issues in the green economy [1]. Against this background, we developed an integrated sustainability assessment framework to monitor and measure the development of the green economy in Germany based on the EU Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) Directive framework [3, 4]. Whether sustainable development has been achieved in Germany and its CLEW systems will be determined by an analysis of all quantifiable indicators of the enlarged German sustainability strategy [5]. Our measuring approach aggregates the indicators of the German sustainability strategy into one index [6]. Our <b>sustainability</b> <b>gap</b> index reveals the heterogeneity of the development of the sustainability indicators of the German sustainability strategy. The index calculates the degree to which sustainability is achieved and our integrated assessment approach enables us to identify contradictions and similarities between the CLEW systems and the overall German socio-economic system...|$|E

This process has gained significant government support resulting in the introduction of policies and support for “safe vegetable production” and recently the establishment of Vietnamese Good Agricultural Practice (VietGAP) standards. VietGAP is a government decree laying out the principles for sustainable and safe agricultural production supported by certification and auditing systems. These consumer driven market transformations together with government policies has increased the pressure on farmers to adopt more sustainable production practices. This paper examines GAP as a framework to secure food safety and sustainable production, and farmer field schools (FFSs) as a platform for GAP learning and establishment of GAP collective action and practices under specific Vietnamese smallholder conditions where the GAP process is strongly driven by government. Our results indicate that a participatory approach to GAP implementation resulted in successful joint government‐private sector intervention in citrus production. It is, however, too early to draw conclusions about the <b>sustainability</b> of <b>GAP</b> certification since the economic benefits for the GAP certified farmers in comparison to non‐certified farmers are not yet clear.

40|$|In {{the debate}} about {{sustainable}} development, {{the key question is}} whether natural capital can be substituted by man-made capital. Proponents of weak sustainability maintain that man-made and natural capital are substitutable in the long term whilst followers of strong sustainability believe they are not. This insightful book assesses whether science can unambiguously endorse either paradigm and explores the extent to which, and at what cost, certain forms of natural capital should be preserved. The book explores the limits of the two opposing paradigms of sustainability in an accessible and illuminating way. The author begins by examining the availability of natural resources for the production of consumption goods and the environmental consequences of economic growth. He also identifies the critical forms of natural capital in need of preservation given risk, uncertainty and ignorance about the future, and addresses the important topic of sustainability indicators. In doing so, he analyses indicators of weak sustainability such as Genuine Savings and the Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare, and indicators of strong sustainability including ecological footprints, material flows, <b>sustainability</b> <b>gaps</b> and other measures which combine the setting of environmental standards with monetary valuation. For the most part, requiring only a basic knowledge and understanding of economics, this accessible book will ensure the important theoretical and empirical debates surrounding sustainable development are available for a wide audience including undergraduate and postgraduate students of environmental and ecological economics. It will also be of interest to researchers and policymakers involved in the sustainable management of environmental resources...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} existing tax competences in EU law, in {{the light}} of European and international obligations, and their evolution since the initial founding of the European Economic Community. It approaches this task not just from the perspective of competences, but examines values, objectives, obligations and actual governance capacities underpinning the implementation and realisation of these aims and duties in the field of taxation. The analysis is linked to discourses addressing <b>sustainability</b> <b>gaps</b> within EU taxation law and policy, in particular: a prevailing focus on economic growth; a lack of EU-level environmental taxation; an absence of tax measures that tackle, much less consider inequalities in income and wealth; and, persisting socio-economic inequalities between men and women. The concept of sustainable development features prominently in the objectives of the European Union and is closely linked to the function of the internal market. The implications of sustainability for legal obligations, however, remain unclear, and particularly so in the context of taxation. This paper provides an outline of the current legal framework for positive and negative integration of taxation, and considers the evolution of values, objectives and obligations in European and International law with a particular focus on the legal concept of sustainable development. From this basis, it examines legislative capacities to address the economic, ecological and social dimensions of sustainable development in the area of taxation and offers preliminary options for the amendment of hard and soft law mechanisms, so as fully to support European values and objectives in the field of taxation...|$|R

In this paper, we operationalize and update the footprint-boundary ESA framework, with a particular focus on its methodological and application extensions to the national level. By using the latest datasets available, the planetary boundaries for carbon emissions, water use and land use are allocated to 28 selected countries {{in comparison to the}} corresponding environmental footprints. The environmental sustainability ratio (ESR) —an internationally comparable indicator representing the <b>sustainability</b> <b>gap</b> between contemporary anthropogenic interference and critical capacity thresholds—allows one to map the reserve or transgression of the nation-specific environmental boundaries.

There are two different approaches to the assessment of sustainability: the use of <b>sustainability</b> <b>gap</b> indicators (Blanchard et al., 1990) and the time series approach (Trehan and Walsh, 1988). In this paper we analyze the sustainability of public debt in Italy following the latter approach. We examine almost the entire life of the Italian State, i. e. 1861 - 2010, by employing a database containing several statistical novelties: new time series estimates of public debt and GDP (respectively Banca d'Italia, 2008 and Baffigi, 2011) and an original reconstruction of the revenues of the State.

This has been done by comparing the two Indian cities Mumbai and Bangalore with selected mega cities of the worlds representing different stages of development (Shanghai, London, and Singapore) using an indicator-based approach under a sustainability framework. The prioritised indicators under the three dimensions of sustainability - economic, social and environmental - are included for the comparison. The approach is used for developing dimension-wise sustainability indices as well as composite urban sustainability indices (USIs) for all the chosen cities. In the next step, these index values are compared with the hypothetical benchmark urban sustainability index values and <b>sustainability</b> <b>gaps</b> are identified. These gaps essentially represent the targets for achieving sustainable urbanization.

Resource/supply constraints faced by conventional energy sources, techno-economic constraints faced by renewable energy sources, and the bounds imposed by climate change on fossil fuel use are likely to undermine India's quest for having a robust electricity system that can effectively contribute to achieving accelerated, sustainable and inclusive economic growth. One possible way out could be transitioning into a sustainable electricity system, which is a trade-off solution having taken into account the economic, social and environmental concerns. As {{a first step toward}} understanding this transition, we contribute an indicator based hierarchical multidimensional framework as an analytical tool for sustainability assessment of electricity systems, and validate it for India's national electricity system. We evaluate Indian electricity system using this framework by comparing it with a hypothetical benchmark sustainable electrical system, which was created using best indicator values realized across national electricity systems in the world. This framework, we believe, can be used to examine the social, economic and environmental implications of the current Indian electricity system as well as setting targets for future development. The analysis with the indicator framework provides {{a deeper understanding of the}} system, identify and quantify the prevailing <b>sustainability</b> <b>gaps</b> and generate specific targets for interventions. We use this framework to compute national electricity system sustainability index (NESSI) for India. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
50|$|VLOM has {{undoubtedly}} {{brought the}} answer to sustainability a little closer; however, the goal of easy maintenance remains elusive. Perhaps the greatest lesson {{is that there are}} currently no ‘off-the-shelf’ solutions which can bypass the need for effective government institutional community water point support. Wherever this problem is unresolved, and where there are no NGOs or other agencies to fill the <b>gap,</b> <b>sustainability</b> will always be in doubt.|$|R
