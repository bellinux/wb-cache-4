5|$|The AG {{considers}} salvation, baptism in the Holy Spirit {{with the}} evidence of speaking in tongues, divine healing and the <b>Second</b> <b>Coming</b> <b>of</b> Christ to be its four core beliefs.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{adoption}} of the article of faith on the baptism of the Holy Spirit in 1908, the Pentecostal Holiness Church has taught the following beliefs as their five cardinal doctrines: justification by faith, entire sanctification, the baptism in the Holy Spirit evidenced by speaking in tongues, Christ's atonement (including divine healing), and the premillennial <b>second</b> <b>coming</b> <b>of</b> Christ.|$|E
5|$|The Assemblies of God holds to a conservative, evangelical and Arminian {{theology}} {{as expressed}} in the Statement of Fundamental Truths and position papers, which emphasize such core Pentecostal doctrines as the baptism in the Holy Spirit, speaking in tongues, divine healing and the <b>Second</b> <b>Coming</b> <b>of</b> Christ. It defines for itself a fourfold mission to evangelize others, worship God, disciple believers, and show compassion.|$|E

5|$|The PHC {{believes}} in the imminent, personal, premillennial <b>second</b> <b>coming</b> <b>of</b> Jesus Christ. It will occur in two stages: the first stage will be the rapture of the saints before the Tribulation, and the second stage {{will be at the}} end of the Tribulation when Christ will return to defeat the Antichrist, judge the nations of the world, and begin his millennial reign.|$|E
5|$|The series {{centers on}} FBI special agents Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{and her new}} partner John Doggett (Robert Patrick)—following the alien {{abduction}} of her former partner, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny)—who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, Scully, working alone, pursues a cult that worship a slug-like organism and {{believe it to be}} the <b>Second</b> <b>Coming</b> <b>of</b> Jesus Christ; but in her efforts to save an injured stranger, she discovers she is in over her head.|$|E
5|$|As he lies dying {{under the}} abbey's rubble, Zerchi is startled to {{encounter}} Mrs Grales/Rachel, a bicephalous tomato peddler and mutant. However, Mrs. Grales has been rendered unconscious by the explosion, {{and may be}} dying herself. As Zerchi tries to conditionally baptize Rachel, she refuses, and instead takes the ciborium and administers the Eucharist to him. It is implied that she is, like the Virgin Mary, Eve and Jesus, exempt from original sin, and may even be the <b>Second</b> <b>Coming</b> <b>of</b> Christ to begin a new cycle on Earth. Zerchi soon dies, having witnessed an apparent miracle.|$|E

Amillennialism is the view essentially held by the Roman Catholic Church, {{as well as by}} many conservative and liberal Protestant churches and by the Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox and the Assyrian Church of the East.|$|R

5|$|Born in Salem, Massachusetts to two unwed first cousins, Jones Very became {{associated}} with Harvard University, first as an undergraduate, {{then as a}} student in the Harvard Divinity School and as a tutor of Greek. He heavily studied epic poetry and was invited to lecture on the topic in his home town, which drew the attention of Ralph Waldo Emerson. Soon after, Very asserted that he was the <b>Second</b> <b>Coming</b> <b>of</b> Christ, which resulted in his dismissal from Harvard and his eventual institutionalization in an insane asylum. When he was released, Emerson helped him issue a collection called Essays and Poems in 1839. Very lived the majority of his life as a recluse from then on, issuing poetry only sparingly. He died in 1880.|$|E
5|$|Branham {{claimed to}} have had a prophetic revelation in June, 1933 that {{comprised}} seven major events that would occur before the <b>Second</b> <b>Coming</b> <b>of</b> Christ. He believed that five of the seven predictions, relating to world politics, science, and the moral condition of the world, had been fulfilled. The final two visions, one related to the Roman Catholic Church gaining power in the United States and the second detailing the destruction of the United States, would be fulfilled by 1977, subsequent to which Christ would return. A comparison of Branham's descriptions of the prophecies reveals his tendency to exaggerate and embellish his actual predictions.|$|E
5|$|Christian doctrines {{include the}} beliefs that Jesus was {{conceived}} by the Holy Spirit, {{was born of}} a virgin named Mary, performed miracles, founded the Church, died by crucifixion as a sacrifice to achieve atonement, rose from the dead, and ascended into Heaven, from where he will return. Most Christians believe Jesus enables humans to be reconciled to God. The Nicene Creed asserts that Jesus will judge {{the living and the}} dead either before or after their bodily resurrection, an event tied to the <b>Second</b> <b>Coming</b> <b>of</b> Jesus in Christian eschatology. The great majority of Christians worship Jesus as the incarnation of God the Son, the second of three persons of a Divine Trinity. A minority of Christian denominations reject Trinitarianism, wholly or partly, as non-scriptural.|$|E
5000|$|In Romanian territories, the {{movement}} became {{the subject of}} renewed media and political interest, while coming into conflict with the prevalent Romanian Orthodox Church. The new keepers of Inochentist doctrines, described as by [...] "charlatans" [...] by Clark, were self-appointed patriarchs, deemed incarnations of the Holy Spirit or <b>Second</b> <b>Comings</b> <b>of</b> Christ. The government perceived {{the movement}} as [...] "harmful" [...] for Romanian society and in contradiction with public order, so, in 1925, the Inochentist church was officially banned. In 1926, a church leader was arrested by Romanian authorities as he tried to set up a new congregation in Budești.|$|R

5|$|Growth in the Northeast was {{accompanied}} by the creation of moral reform organizations, such as Sunday schools, temperance associations, tract and Bible societies, and orphanages. The proliferation of voluntary organizations was encouraged by postmillennialism, {{the belief that the}} <b>Second</b> <b>Coming</b> <b>of</b> Christ would occur {{at the end of an}} era of peace and prosperity fostered by human effort. The 1815 General Assembly recommended the creation of societies to promote morality. Organizations such as the American Bible Society, the American Sunday School Union, and the American Colonization Society, while theoretically interdenominational, were dominated by Presbyterians and considered unofficial agencies of the Presbyterian Church.|$|E
5|$|Scully is {{eventually}} {{captured by the}} townspeople and the worm is inserted into her body. Eventually, Doggett finds Scully, cuts the worm out of her, and shoots the creature dead. Later, Scully is packing her things in the hospital when Doggett comes in to inform her about {{the trial of the}} cult members; they are offering little defense except that they claim that they are being persecuted for their religious beliefs. Scully muses that they thought the worm was the <b>Second</b> <b>Coming</b> <b>of</b> Jesus Christ. She apologizes to Doggett for going out on the mission alone and promises to never do it again.|$|E
5|$|Christians {{believed}} in a bodily {{resurrection of the}} dead at the <b>Second</b> <b>Coming</b> <b>of</b> Christ, and the Catholic Church only relaxed its opposition to cremation in 1963. Although mass ossuaries have also been used, burial {{has always been the}} preferred Christian tradition, at least until recent times. Burial was, for as long as there was room, usually in a graveyard adjacent to the church, with a gravestone or horizontal slab, or for the wealthy or important clergy, inside it. Wall tombs in churches strictly include the body itself, often in a sarcophagus, while often the body is buried in a crypt or under the church floor, with a monument on the wall. Persons of importance, especially monarchs, might be buried in a free-standing sarcophagus, perhaps surrounded by an elaborate enclosure using metalwork and sculpture; grandest of all were the shrines of saints, which became the destinations of pilgrimages. The monument to MaximilianI, Holy Roman Emperor in the Hofkirche, Innsbruck took decades to complete, while the tomb of Saint Dominic in Bologna took several centuries to reach its final form.|$|E
50|$|Into {{the middle}} of this (3:13-4:22) is a Christian apocalypse called the Testament of Hezekiah, {{describing}} a vision <b>of</b> the <b>coming</b> <b>of</b> Jesus, the subsequent corruption of the Christian church, the rule of Beliar, and the <b>second</b> <b>coming.</b> All <b>of</b> which is phrased {{in such a way that}} it is clearly a code for the persecution of the Church by Nero, and the belief that Nero was an Antichrist.|$|R

5|$|Initially {{presented}} {{as the primary}} antagonist who he must capture, Nero’s encounters with Dante {{over the course of}} the game reveal that the Order of the Sword is in fact responsible for a number of atrocities. Chief among them, is the Order's High-Ranking Scientist Agnus, who has succeeded in transforming himself, Credo, and a very-much-alive Sanctus into Demons with incredible power by siphoning demonic energy from Yamato, the long lost Devil Arm of Dante's twin brother Vergil. Furthermore, Sanctus has used Agnus' research to summon an army of demons to attack Fortuna, while simultaneously awakening a long dormant weapon called The Savior (a giant colossus made in Sparda's image) to destroy the threat; posing as the <b>second</b> <b>coming</b> <b>of</b> Sparda in order to eliminate non-believers, and strengthen his congregation’s worship.|$|E
5|$|Queer as Folk 2 was {{broadcast}} in February 2000 and {{was driven by}} the plot element of Vince's half-sister's wedding. The specials place emphasis on Vince and Stuart's relationship, and ends with their departure for another gay scene in a pastiche of Grease, as Nathan took the role {{as the leader of}} the Manchester scene's next generation. On the heels of the special, Davies pitched the spin-off Misfits, a late-night soap opera set in a boarding house owned by Vince's mother, Hazel, and The Second Coming, a series that depicted the <b>Second</b> <b>Coming</b> <b>of</b> Christ in contemporary Manchester. Misfits was rejected in December 2000 and The Second Coming was initially approved by Channel 4 but later rejected after a change of executive personnel. Instead of contesting the cancellation of The Second Coming, he left Channel 4 and vowed to not work with them again.|$|E
