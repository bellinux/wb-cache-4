5|$|The Voluntary Human Extinction Movement (VHEMT) is an {{environmental}} movement {{that calls for}} all people to abstain from reproduction to cause the gradual voluntary extinction of humankind. VHEMT supports human extinction primarily because, in the group's view, it would prevent environmental degradation. The group states that {{a decrease in the}} human population would prevent a significant amount of human-caused suffering. The extinctions of non-human species and the <b>scarcity</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> required by humans are frequently cited by the group as evidence of the harm caused by human overpopulation.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} many {{hypotheses}} that have attempted to explain why lemurs exhibit female social dominance while other primates with similar social structures do not, but no consensus has been reached after decades of research. The dominant view in the literature states that female dominance is an advantageous trait given {{the high costs of}} reproduction and the <b>scarcity</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> available. Indeed, female dominance {{has been shown to be}} linked to increased maternal investment. However, when reproductive costs and extreme seasonality of resources were compared across primates, other primates demonstrated male dominance under conditions that were similar to or more challenging than those faced by lemurs. In 2008, a new hypothesis revised this model using simple game theory. It was argued that when two individuals were equally matched in fighting capacity, the one with the most need would win the conflict since it would have the most to lose. Consequently, the female, with higher resource needs for pregnancy, lactation, and maternal care, was more likely to win in resource conflicts with equally sized males. This, however, assumed monomorphism between sexes. The following year, a new hypothesis was proposed to explain monomorphism, stating that because most female lemurs are only sexually receptive for a day or two each year, males can utilize a more passive form of mate guarding: copulatory plugs, which block the female reproductive tract, preventing other males from successfully mating with her, and thus reducing the need for aggression and the evolutionary drive for sexual dimorphism.|$|E

25|$|Serotonin mediates the animal's {{perceptions}} of resource; In less complex animals, such as some invertebrates, resources simply mean food availability.

In response to the perceived abundance or <b>scarcity</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources,</b> an animal's growth, reproduction or mood may be elevated or lowered. This may somewhat depend on how much serotonin the organism has at its disposal.|$|E

In terms of access to education, China's system represented a pyramid; because of the <b>scarcity</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> allotted to higher education, student numbers decreased sharply at the higher levels.

25|$|Bangladesh Krishak Sramik Awami League (BAKSAL) {{the only}} legally {{recognized}} party of Bangladesh founded on 7 June 1975 following the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of Bangladesh. Mujib's government soon began encountering increased dissatisfaction and unrest. His programs of nationalization and industrial socialism suffered {{from lack of}} trained personnel, inefficiency, rampant corruption, and poor leadership. Mujib focused almost entirely on national issues and thus neglected local issues and government. The party and central government exercised full control and democracy was weakened, with virtually no elections organized at the grass roots or local levels. Political opposition included communists as well as Islamic fundamentalists, who were angered by the declaration of a secular state. Mujib was criticized for nepotism in appointing family members to important positions. A famine in 1974 further intensified the food crisis, and devastated agriculture– the mainstay of the economy. Intense criticism of Mujib arose over the lack of political leadership, a flawed pricing policy, and rising inflation amidst heavy losses suffered by the nationalized industries. Mujib's ambitious social programs performed poorly, owing to <b>scarcity</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources,</b> funds, and personnel, and caused unrest amongst the masses.|$|E

According to Prothero, the best living analogues for Paraceratherium may be large mammals such as elephants, rhinoceroses and hippopotamuses. To aid in thermoregulation, these animals cool down during the day by resting in the shade or by wallowing in water and mud. They also forage and move mainly at night. Because of its large size, Paraceratherium {{would not have been able}} to run and move quickly, but they would have been able to cross large distances, which would be necessary in an environment with a scarcity of food. They may therefore have had large home ranges and have been migratory. Prothero suggests that animals as big as indricotheres would need very large home ranges or territories of at least [...] and that, because of a <b>scarcity</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources,</b> there would have been little room in Asia for many populations or a multitude of nearly identical species and genera.

30|$|It {{follows from}} the above that the {{pastoral}} mode of subsistence in Soqotra has always encompassed multiple means <b>of</b> drawing <b>resources</b> from the environment.
