5|$|A {{high-profile}} <b>success</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> company {{came in the}} 1960s, {{again in}} Egypt. The rising waters of the River Nile (a result {{of the construction of}} the Aswan High Dam) threatened the ancient Abu Simbel temple complex. The entire site was dismantled and reassembled 200 m further from the river, and 65 m higher, at a cost of around US$36 million.|$|E
5|$|Moana, a CGI fantasy-adventure film, was {{released}} in November 2016. The film was shown in theaters with the animated short Inner Workings. Moana was another commercial and critical <b>success</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> studio, grossing over $600 million worldwide and receiving two Academy Award nominations.|$|E
5|$|According to Ito, the Super Famicom {{release was}} a great <b>success</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> company, helping {{establishing}} it as both a developer and publisher. While a success, the game also received criticism from players for its high encounter rate and difficulties using the map and in-game instructions. At the end of 2001, the PlayStation version was the 119th best selling video {{game of the year}} in Japan, with 85,991 sold copies.|$|E

5|$|Akroinon {{was a major}} <b>success</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Byzantines, as it was {{the first}} {{large-scale}} victory they had scored in a pitched battle against the Arabs. Seeing it as evidence of God's renewed favour, the victory also served to strengthen Leo's belief in the policy of iconoclasm that he had adopted some years before. In the immediate aftermath, this success opened up the way for a more aggressive stance by the Byzantines, who in 741 attacked the major Arab base of Melitene. In 742 and 743, the Umayyads were able to exploit a civil war between Constantine V and Artabasdos and raid into Anatolia with relative impunity, but the Arab sources do not report any major achievements.|$|E
5|$|Although the UN {{casualties}} were moderate during the battle, the Third Battle of Seoul {{was a significant}} <b>success</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Chinese military in Korea, and the UN forces' morale had sunk to its lowest point during the war. Ridgway was also extremely displeased {{with the performance of}} Eighth Army, which he had no control over due to the sudden death of Walker. Ridgway then took immediate steps to restore the morale and fighting spirit of the UN forces in Korea. With Ridgway leading the Eighth Army, MacArthur started to regain confidence in UN forces' ability to hold Korea, and the UN evacuation plan was abandoned on January 17.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of its {{original}} pressing, Like a Virgin & Other Big Hits! did not peak on any record chart, but its re-release later experienced moderate commercial <b>success.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> week ending May 7, 2016, the album debuted and peaked at number three on Billboards Dance/Electronic Albums chart, becoming the week's third highest debut. While dropping off the chart the next week, the EP additionally opened and peaked at number eight on the Top Tastemaker Albums chart, having a similar course.|$|E

5|$|Cleph {{kept his}} throne for only 18 months before being assassinated by a slave. An {{important}} <b>success</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Byzantines {{was that no}} king was proclaimed to succeed him, opening a decade of interregnum and making the Lombards who remained in Italy more vulnerable to attacks from Franks and Byzantines. It was only {{when faced with the}} danger of annihilation by the Franks in 584 that the Lombard dukes elected a new king in the person of Authari, son of Cleph, who began the definitive consolidation and centralization of the Lombard kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{holding a}} {{monopoly}} on cases in the Court of Common Pleas, Serjeants also took most of the business in the Court of King's Bench. Although required to make the Common Pleas their principal place of work, {{there is evidence of}} Serjeants who did not; one, Robert Mennell, worked entirely in the North of England after his creation in 1547 and was not known in Westminster, where the Common Pleas was located. This was also a time of great judicial <b>success</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Serjeants; since only Serjeants could be appointed to the common law courts, many also sat in the Exchequer of Pleas, a court of equity. This period was not a time of <b>success</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> profession overall, however, despite the brisk business being done. The rise of central courts other than the Common Pleas allowed other lawyers to gain advocacy experience and work, drawing it away from the Serjeants, {{and at the same time}} the few Serjeants could not handle all the business in the Common Pleas, allowing the rise of barristers as dedicated advocates.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{territorial}} gains {{following the}} Paris Peace Conference, the Greeks still hoped {{to achieve the}} Megali Idea and annex Constantinople and larger areas of Ottoman Asia Minor; they invaded Anatolia beyond Smyrna and sought to take Ankara, {{with the aim of}} destroying the Turkish resistance led by Mustafa Kemal (later known as Atatürk). Thus began the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922). Although Alexander's reign saw success after <b>success</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Greek armies, it was eventually Atatürk's revolutionary forces that obtained victory in 1922.|$|E

5|$|Development {{within the}} Albert Dock was rapid {{and the newly}} renovated Edward Pavilion (formerly north east stack) was ready {{in time for the}} 1984 Cutty Sark Tall Ship Race. The race was a big <b>success</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> city with over one million {{visitors}} into Liverpool over a period of four days, of which 160,000 visited the Albert Dock. In total it is estimated that the two flagship regeneration schemes of the MDC, the tall ships race and International Garden Festival, attracted over 3.5 million visitors to Liverpool in 1984. Also completed in 1984 was the renovation of the dock traffic office, which was fitted out and leased to Granada Television.|$|E
5|$|During {{her second}} {{season with the}} Pilots in 2002, Sinclair led Division I in goals with 26. She scored two goals during the {{national}} championship game against conference rival Santa Clara, the second {{of which was a}} golden goal that won the Pilots the national championship. Sinclair earned three different national Player of the Year honours, and was a finalist for the Hermann Trophy. Named West Coast Conference Player of the Year, she earned All-American honours for the second consecutive year. In the wake of her <b>success</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Canadian national teams and American collegiate soccer, she was named by The Globe and Mail as one of the 25 most influential people in Canadian sports the same year.|$|E
5|$|Gneisenau and Prinz Eugen had {{continued}} their journey to Norway while Scharnhorst was immobilized. At 14:45, the ships {{were attacked by}} five Whirlwind fighter-bombers—German fighters beat them back. Several more air attacks followed {{over the next two}} hours, though without <b>success</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> British. At 16:17, five British destroyers attempted to torpedo the German ships, but heavy fire from Gneisenau and Prinz Eugen mauled one and forced the others to turn away. Near Terschelling, Gneisenau struck a mine that did minor damage to the hull, though the explosive shock damaged one of her three turbines. Her captain ordered the ship to stop while temporary repairs were conducted, which lasted for about 30minutes. By 03:50 on 13February, the ship had reached Helgoland.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, KFC International {{launched}} the Krusher (Krushem in some markets) line of frozen beverages. The product {{was an attempt}} to introduce a between-meals snack to KFC, and was marketed towards teenagers. In April 2010, the Double Down sandwich was launched. Criticised as an unhealthy product, it featured two pieces of fried chicken in lieu of a conventional bread bun. It {{has proved to be a}} <b>success</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> company, with 15 million Double Downs sold worldwide between March 2011 and March 2013. In September 2012, the Chicken Little sandwich returned in the US.|$|E
5|$|Members of Picidae are {{typically}} monogamous, {{with a few}} species breeding cooperatively and some polygamy reported in a few species. Polyandry, where a female raises two broods with two separate males, has also {{been reported in the}} West Indian woodpecker. Another unusual social system is that of the acorn woodpecker, which is a polygynandrous cooperative breeder where groups of up to 12 individuals breed and help to raise the young. Young birds from previous years may stay behind to help raise the group's young, and studies have found reproductive <b>success</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> group goes up with group size, but individual success goes down. Birds may be forced to remain in groups {{due to a lack of}} habitat to disperse to.|$|E
5|$|Operation Donnerkeil {{had been}} an {{outstanding}} <b>success</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Luftwaffe. The measure of success lay not in the ratio of losses, which amounted to 2:1 in the German favour, but {{the failure of the}} RAF, FAA and Royal Navy to intercept or at least inflict severe damage to the German warships. The meagre forces committed by the Navy had been repulsed easily by the German warships and their escorts. Heavy AAA fire had offered a helpful defence against air attack, but the German air defence had succeeded, along with poor weather, in breaking up RAF assaults on the ships. Galland, responsible for the plan, called it the high point of his career.|$|E
50|$|At Granada, Plowright was {{a defender}} of the often {{controversial}} current affairs programme, World in Action. Under his leadership, dramas such as Brideshead Revisited and The Jewel In <b>The</b> Crown became <b>successes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> company.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{last two}} <b>successes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Austrians: the Conquest of Romania and the Caporetto Offensive, were German-assisted operations. Due {{to the fact}} that the empire had become more and more {{dependent}} on German assistance, the majority of its people, not of Hungarian or Austrian ethnicity, became aware of the empire's destabilization.|$|R
50|$|The 1974-75 {{season of}} the European Cup Winners' Cup club {{football}} tournament was won by Dynamo Kyiv in a convincing final victory against Ferencváros. It {{was the first of}} two Cup Winners' Cup <b>successes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> club.|$|R
5|$|Operation Heiderose was a {{significant}} <b>success</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> division, inflicting serious losses on the Partisans. More than 900 Partisans were killed and {{a large amount of}} equipment was captured: one anti-tank gun, two mortars, 22 machine guns, over 800 rifles and nearly 500,000 rounds of small arms ammunition. The division suffered 24 killed and over 150 wounded. Communist sources hold that the Partisans suffered serious losses, with the 12th Corps alone having 250 dead, wounded and missing. However, Partisan reports estimate that German losses were significantly larger than their own. Erich Braun was recommended for the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross but the recommendation was not supported, apparently due to disagreements between the divisional staff and Phleps that had occurred during the division's formation.|$|E
5|$|Since 1991, Maribor has {{competed in}} the Slovenian PrvaLiga, {{the highest level of}} {{football}} in the country. The team was one of the league's founding members and is one of only three clubs that has never been relegated from the top division. The first major <b>success</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> club was during its first season as part of the Slovenian football system when it won the Slovenian Cup, a feat it has repeated nine times to date. The club has won the league championship 14 times in 26 seasons and is the most successful club in the country. In 2009 the club also won the Slovenian Supercup for the first time, the last domestic trophy missing among the club's honours.|$|E
5|$|Temperatures Rising {{was one of}} two sitcoms {{that the}} ABC network premiered in its 1972–73 prime time schedule, the other being The Paul Lynde Show.

Asher and Screen Gems made a deal with ABC to cancel Bewitched a year earlier than contracts stipulated, thereby allowing them the opportunity to develop the two new sitcoms. Ackerman served as executive producer and Asher as producer.|$|E
