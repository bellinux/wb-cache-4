2500|$|Two {{types of}} field {{research}} {{were carried out}} in Pretoria to identify beetles that would be suitable for export to Australia. Firstly, researchers took <b>stocktaking</b> trips to locations around South Africa in order {{to collect data on}} the biodiversity and ecological abundance of the beetle fauna of an area, as well as the environmental conditions preferred by different species. Secondly, species earmarked as being potential candidates for biological control were then collected and taken back to the research base laboratory where experiments were carried out to determine such things as beetle biology, habits, dung-disposing capacity, reproductive cycles and the ability to withstand quarantining procedures. It was necessary to devise and record methods of propagating dung beetles in large numbers, and this information forwarded onto the research base in Australia. In addition, extensive studies were carried out in the beetles’ native habitat to study their likely distribution patterns in Australia and thus aid in the selection of sites for their introduction. Later research [...] has found that habitat specificity matching {{is one of the most}} important factors in determining whether or not an introduced species is successful in becoming established.|$|E

40|$|Aid {{policy and}} {{practice}} have been thoroughly shaken up {{over the past few}} years. One of the crucial reform areas relates to monitoring and evaluation (M&E). In short, aid recipients are asked to elaborate sound, results-oriented frameworks while donors are expected to harmonise and align their own policies and frameworks. Evidence has revealed that implementation on the ground is slow. This discussion paper examines the extent to which joint sector reviews (JSRs) could take the M&E reform agenda forward. JSRs are M&E exercises at the sector level which have the potential to satisfy the existing M&E needs of various stakeholders while, at the same time, also contributing to the M&E reform agenda. They are increasingly utilised on the ground, yet, so far, there do not exist any systematic <b>stocktakings</b> and/or analyses of them. Our own analysis of a sample of JSRs from the education sectors of Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger indicate that JSRs score highly on harmonisation, coordination, leadership and broad-based participation; but poorly on alignment. They generally prioritise accountability over learning needs; focus more on implementation than results; and largely neglect accountability and learning {{at the level of the}} sector institutional apparatus (including the M&E system). In this paper, findings from the field are contrasted with insights from evaluation theory and practice so as to provide suggestions for on the ground JSR improvements. ...|$|R
40|$|Discussion paperThe overall {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to develop an appropriate conceptual and analytical framework to better understand how prospects for growth and poverty reduction can be stimulated in rural Honduras. We employ complementary quantitative and qualitative methods of analysis, driven by an asset-base approach. Emphasis on assets is appropriate given high inequalities in the distribution of productive assets among households and geographical areas in Honduras. Such inequalities are likely to constrain how the poor share in the benefits of growth, even under appropriate policy regimes. We focus on household assets (broadly defined to include natural, physical, human, financial, social and locational assets) and their combinations necessary to take advantage of economic opportunities. We examine the relative contributions of these assets, and identify the combinations of productive, social, and location-specific assets that matter most to raise incomes and take advantage of prospects for poverty-reducing growth. Factor and cluster analysis techniques are used to identify and group different livelihood strategies; and econometric analysis is used to investigate the determinants of different livelihood strategies and the major factors that impact on income. Spatial analysis, community livelihood studies and project <b>stocktakings</b> are brought in to complement some of the more quantitative household survey data used.

The year given {{at the beginning of}} each bibliographical entry is, in the majority of cases, the year in which the text was first published (not necessarily the year of the edition cited). For all writings written by Boulez, I have provided the original title under which the text in question was first published (usually in French). Many articles have subsequently been translated into English and therefore I have decided to provide page references for both versions. For all texts by writers other than Boulez, I have cited the version of the text I have used. Wherever possible, I have cited the existing English translations of texts originally written in French. However, on many occasions I have considered it necessary to make alterations to the published translations. This is particularly applicable to Boulez on Music Today (1971) and Orientations (1986), both of which display an often heavy-handed and rather inaccurate approach to the task of translating specific concepts employed by Boulez. In contrast. <b>Stocktakings</b> of an Apprenticeship (1991) has required only occasional minor amendments.

40|$|The overall {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to develop an appropriate conceptual and analytical framework to better understand how prospects for growth and poverty reduction can be stimulated in rural Honduras. We employ complementary quantitative and qualitative methods of analysis, driven by an asset-base approach.

Such inequalities are likely to constrain how the poor share in the benefits of growth, even under appropriate policy regimes. We focus on household assets (broadly defined to include natural, physical, human, financial, social and locational assets) and their combinations necessary to take advantage of economic opportunities. We examine the relative contributions of these assets, and identify the combinations of productive, social, and location-specific assets that matter most to raise incomes and take advantage of prospects for poverty-reducing growth. Factor and cluster analysis techniques are used to identify and group different livelihood strategies; and econometric analysis is used to investigate the determinants of different livelihood strategies and the major factors that impact on income. Spatial analysis, community livelihood studies and project <b>stocktakings</b> are brought in to complement some of the more quantitative household survey data used. Our conclusions and recommendations are mainly focused on hillsides and hillside areas since the majority of the available data is for these areas. Our research resulted in five key findings with important strategic implications. First, there exists significant heterogeneity of rural areas in Honduras in terms of their asset endowments. But even areas with good economic potential often have persistent high rates of poverty because the poor lack the basic asset base to be able to capitalize on this potential. Second, poverty is widespread and deep in rural Honduras, particularly in hillside areas where most households have limited assets on which to base their livelihood strategies. High poverty density in hillside areas and the fact that some 80 percent of all rural poor are located in these areas, should make these areas a target of national rural poverty reduction strategies. Overlap between high poverty rates and high poverty densities in many hillside areas means that investments there should reach significant proportions of the country 9 ̆ 2 s rural poor with minimal leakages. Third, agriculture should form an integral part of the rural growth strategy in hillside areas, but its potential is limited. Over the past 25 years, agriculture has not been a strong engine of growth in rural Honduras. But high reliance of rural households on agricultural and related income means that any strategy targeted to these areas will have to build upon the economic base created by agriculture. Even though agriculture alone cannot solve the rural poverty problem, those remaining in the sector need to be more efficient, productive and competitive. Strategic actions and investments involving food security, security and access to land and forests, infrastructure provision, improved natural resource management, non-agricultural rural employment and migration are needed to achieve broad-based and sustainable agricultural growth and reduced rural poverty. Fourth, there is a need to move from geographically untargeted investments in single assets to a more integrated and geographically based approach of asset enhancement with proper complementarities. A multisectoral investment program is required to upgrade and improve access to household assets, with proper and more explicit complementarities. Finally, asset investment programs need to be adapted according to the specific needs of regions and households. While some household assets programs should be national in nature, others require more local adaptation and must be carried out in tandem, according to specific needs of regions and households. Investment strategies should be formulated on broad regional bases, but options within regions should be tailored to local asset bases...|$|R
