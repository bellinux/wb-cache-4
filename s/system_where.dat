5|$|Multifactorial sex {{determination}} occurs in numerous Neotropical species and involves both XY and ZW systems. Multifactorial systems involve rearrangements of sex chromosomes and autosomes. For example, the darter characine has a ZW multifactorial <b>system</b> <b>where</b> the female {{is determined by}} ZW1W2 and the male by ZZ. The wolf fish has a XY multifactorial <b>system</b> <b>where</b> females are determined by X1X1X2X2 and the male by X1X2Y. Some teleosts, such as zebrafish, have a polyfactorial <b>system,</b> <b>where</b> there are several genes which {{play a role in}} determining sex. Environment-dependent {{sex determination}} has been documented in at least 70 species of teleost. Temperature is the main factor, but PH levels, growth rate, density and social environment may also play a role. For the Atlantic silverside, spawning in colder waters creates more females, while warmer waters create more males.|$|E

The figure includes the entire Istrian Y system, i.e. the A9 motorway and the A8 motorway.

5|$|Battles {{play out}} using a turn-based <b>system</b> <b>where</b> each unit {{on both sides}} is given their chance to move and act. Characters move and attack within the same turn, {{and in a few}} cases units can take two moves in a turn. A key part of combat is the Weapons Triangle, a new {{addition}} which governs the opposing strengths and weaknesses of weapon types based on a rock–paper–scissors system - lances are stronger than swords, swords are stronger than axes, and axes are stronger than lances. A secondary system governs the magic <b>system,</b> <b>where</b> Fire, Lightning, and Wind spells have varying strengths and weaknesses against each other. Each unit has a character class which determines their weapon, skill set, movement and attack range, how much effect they have on other units, which latent skills they possess, and whether they use passive or aggressive skills when in combat. Different weapon types also affect character movement and battle performance: for instance, a powerful sword deals damage while slowing a character's movement.|$|E

This allows direct measurements of the planets' periods and relative diameters (compared to the host star) by monitoring each planet's transit of the star.

40|$|It is {{well-known}} that the Liouville equation of statistical mechanics {{is restricted to}} <b>systems</b> <b>where</b> {{the total number of}} particles (N) is fixed. In this paper, we show how the Liouville equation can be extended to <b>systems</b> <b>where</b> the number of particles can vary, such as in open systems or in <b>systems</b> <b>where</b> particles can be annihilated or created. A general conservation equation for an arbitrary dynamical variable is derived from the extended Liouville equation following Irving and Kirkwood's 2 technique. From the general conservation equation, the particle number conservation equation is obtained that includes general terms for the annihilation or creation of particles. It is also shown that the grand canonical ensemble distribution function is a particular stationary solution of the extended Liouville equation, as required. In general, the extended Liouville equation can be used to study nonequilibrium <b>systems</b> <b>where</b> the total number of particles can vary. Comment: under revie...|$|R
