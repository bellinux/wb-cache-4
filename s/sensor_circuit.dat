50|$|The {{light from}} LEDs can be {{modulated}} very quickly {{so they are}} used extensively in optical fiber and free space optics communications. This includes remote controls, such as for TVs, VCRs, and LED Computers, where infrared LEDs are often used. Opto-isolators use an LED combined with a photodiode or phototransistor to provide a signal path with electrical isolation between two circuits. This is especially useful in medical equipment where the signals from a low-voltage <b>sensor</b> <b>circuit</b> (usually battery-powered) in contact with a living organism must be electrically isolated from any possible electrical failure in a recording or monitoring device operating at potentially dangerous voltages. An optoisolator also lets information be transferred between circuits that don't share a common ground potential.|$|E
50|$|The {{simplest}} type of {{burglar alarm}} control {{consists of a}} single relay. In this type, the <b>sensor</b> <b>circuit</b> (called the loop in industrial terminology) holds the relay energized. Since the path for the loop goes {{through a set of}} contacts which are normally open (when the relay is restored they are open, when the relay is energized they are closed), when the loop opens, even momentarily, the relay will drop out and stay that way. A second set of contacts on the relay, normally closed (when the relay is restored they are closed, when the relay is energized they are open) is used to operate the annunciator, usually a bell. The system is disarmed by a key-operated shunt which forces the relay to energize, and is armed by closing all traps and then by opening the shunt. While burglar alarm controls are now very elaborate, the single-relay control incorporates all the functionality of any control. These controls and a closely related dual-relay design are still widely used in stand-alone applications, powered by lead-acid batteries.|$|E

However, {{there are still}} limitations with the current passive wireless sensors such as a short detection distance and limited parameters to monitor. In this thesis work, we further develop a new concept called Zero Power to overcome challenges related to the state-of-art of passive wireless sensors. Zero Power sensor is claimed to exhibit a long read-out distance and being capable to monitor several quantities. The concept utilizes the intermodulation communication principle, in which the sensor rejects a signal which contains sensing information at the intermodulation frequency while illuminated by the reader device at two closely located frequencies.
