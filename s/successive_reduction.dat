50|$|Their {{submission}} however {{was still}} but imperfect; {{and though they}} regained tranquil throughout the First Punic War, the successes of Hannibal in the Second proved too much for their fidelity, and the Bruttians {{were among the first}} to declare in favor of the Carthaginian general after the Battle of Cannae. The defection of the people did not indeed in the first instance draw with it that of the towns: but Petelia and Consentia, which had at first held aloof, were speedily reduced by the Bruttians, assisted by a small Carthaginian force, and the more important cities of Locri and Crotona followed not long after. Rhegium alone remained firm, and was able to defy the Carthaginian arms throughout the war. In 215 BC, Hanno, the lieutenant of Hannibal, after his defeat at Grumentum by Tiberius Gracchus, threw himself into Bruttium, where he was soon after joined by a body of fresh troops from Carthage under Bomilcar: and from this time he made that region his stronghold, from whence he repeatedly issued to oppose the Roman generals in Lucania and Samnium, while he constantly fell back upon it as a place of safety when defeated or hard pressed by the enemy. The physical character of the country rendered it necessarily a military position of the greatest strength: and after the defeat and death of Hasdrubal Hannibal himself put forces into some Bruttian territory, where he continued to maintain his ground against the Roman generals. There is very little information concerning the operations of the four years during which Hannibal retained his positions in this province: he appears to have made his headquarters for the most part in the neighbourhood of Crotona, but the name of Castra Hannibalis retained by a small town on the Gulf of Squillace, points to his having occupied this also as a permanent station. Meanwhile, the Romans, though avoiding any decisive engagement, were continually gaining ground on him by the <b>successive</b> <b>reduction</b> of towns and fortresses, so that very few of these remained in the hands of the Carthaginian general when he was finally recalled from Italy.|$|E

30|$|It {{is worth}} {{mentioning}} that the contraction and the removal operations, which {{play a vital}} role in this category of algorithms, can be carried out simultaneously, independent of each other. As a result, these algorithms can be efficiently executed in parallel, if multiple processors are available. Then the time taken will be optimized significantly. In social network analysis, spanning tree plays an important role in the identification of relationships among individuals or groups. Inherently, the social networks are sparse in nature, which means the actual number of links is relatively small compared to the maximum possible links. Therefore, in case of social network graphs, it is recommended to pick and choose an algorithm which has been categorized under the <b>successive</b> <b>reduction</b> of graph method to make use of the inherent parallel nature of the proposed algorithms. Moreover, if from a given graph we want to construct the spanning trees with or without a specific edge, then the contraction and removal procedure of <b>successive</b> <b>reduction</b> algorithms are most appropriate.|$|E

30|$|In this paper, we have {{attempted}} to refer and analyze most of the important/prime algorithms given by different academicians {{in the domain of}} all possible spanning tree generation of a simple, undirected, and connected graph. After analyzing the above-mentioned three classifications of algorithms, we have drawn some inferences regarding the suitability of an algorithmic technique in a particular scenario or circumstance. For example, test and select method is supposed to give better performance for sparse graphs rather than dense ones. <b>Successive</b> <b>reduction</b> of graphs is the most suited method if multiple processors are available, as they are inherently parallel in nature. There are some algorithms of other categories too which can also be executed in parallel. Another very important observation is that some algorithms serve dual purposes.

Again, if from a given graph we want to construct the spanning trees with or without a specific edge, then the <b>successive</b> <b>reduction</b> algorithms are to be selected.|$|E
