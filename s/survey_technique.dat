25|$|The {{simplest}} <b>survey</b> <b>technique</b> is surface survey. It involves combing an area, {{usually on}} foot but sometimes {{with the use}} of mechanized transport, to search for features or artifacts visible on the surface. Surface survey cannot detect sites or features that are completely buried under earth, or overgrown with vegetation. Surface survey may also include mini-excavation techniques such as augers, corers, and shovel test pits. If no materials are found, the area surveyed is deemed sterile.|$|E

[...] Other studies have shown the brain activity that characterizes men's preference for sports cars, and even differences between Democrats and Republicans in their reaction to campaign commercials with images of the 9/11 attacks.

2500|$|All {{streets and}} avenues in Miami-Dade County follow the [...] "Miami grid," [...] {{with a few}} exceptions, most notably Coral Gables, Hialeah, and Miami Beach. The grid pattern was adopted after World War I as the common naming system proved too confusing, {{particularly}} for mail carriers. The grid pattern is laid out primarily in 1mi x 1mi format based on a <b>survey</b> <b>technique</b> called metes and bounds. Within those larger squares, individual developers and cities platted the lots differently, {{and they do not}} always cross the major roads that create the macro-grid. These major roads usually are [...] able to cross physical boundaries such as canals and highways, while the intermediate streets within them typically do not. [...] One off-grid neighborhood in Miami, The Roads, is thus named because its streets run off the Miami grid in an approximately 45-degree angle, and therefore all streets are known by their number with the suffix [...] "Road" [...] vs Street. Another busy off-grid road is Okeechobee Road (U.S. Route 27), which travels diagonally through the urban area from the northeast corner of Miami International Airport through Hialeah. Additionally, U.S. Route 1, known better locally as South Dixie Highway, Brickell Avenue and Biscayne Boulevard, does not follow grid pattern.|$|E

50|$|Psychic {{archaeology}} {{is the use}} of {{extrasensory perception}} to locate sites for archaeological digs, or describe context of artifacts. Psychic archaeology is alluring for several reasons, respective to the type of psychic archaeology employed. For instance, <b>surveying</b> <b>techniques</b> such as dowsing are less costly in terms of time and equipment than conventional noninvasive <b>surveying</b> <b>techniques</b> such as Ground Penetrating Radar or magnetometery <b>surveys.</b> <b>Techniques</b> for locating sites and test pits such as automatic writing and various scrying techniques are easy to perform. Psychic archaeologists claim that many of their techniques address lives of the past directly. Whereas accepted archaeologists make inferences about lives of the past based on material culture, some psychic archaeologists say they have visions of non-material aspects of the lives they study.|$|R

40|$|An {{investigation}} was undertaken to compare airborne and ground-based radiometric <b>survey</b> <b>techniques</b> and to {{compare and contrast}} their relative merits {{and how they can}} be used in determining the environmental distribution of environmental radioisotopes, particularly those in the decay chains of 238 U, 232 Th and 40 K. Before a detailed {{investigation was}} done of the <b>survey</b> <b>techniques,</b> it was necessary to look at the underlying physical principles of detection of ionizing radiation and the types of detector that are generally used in these different types of <b>survey</b> <b>techniques.</b> Having looked at the physics of detection, a detailed examination of the potential distribution of these environmental radioisotopes was undertaken. In these surveys, an assumption is often made, that the daughter isotopes in a decay chain are in secular equilibrium with one another. This assumption was examined and the various possible ways in which secular equilibrium could break down were considered, these included looking at biological, meteorological and chemical processes. Only after all the influences on assumptions used in these survey processes and the physical limitations on the measurements taken during surveys were considered, was a comparison made of a set of airborne and ground-based measurements taken at a chosen survey site compared. These measurements compared uranium, thorium and potassium activity concentrations, which had been determined by the two <b>survey</b> <b>techniques,</b> and a correlation was found particularly when the uranium measurements were examined...|$|R
40|$|Since GPS {{technology}} {{which is}} intensively used in surveying application today, can not directly {{be employed to}} measure some details such as building boundaries, {{it is still a}} necessity to establish control points on the ground and coordinate them by GPS and then measure the details by a total station set up on these control points. Establishment of control points on the ground and their compulsory use increase the cost and course of a detail surveying project. In this research, GPSSIT technique is transferred into a motorized <b>surveying</b> <b>technique</b> adapted on a pickup by a low cost mechanism that enables GPS and laser total station integration. So that, this technique makes possible to measure details in a remote distance without establishing any control point on the ground and carrying out all measurement processes on a pickup not on the ground. Motorized GPSSIT provides great advantages in term of course and cost of work and applicability contrary to conventional <b>surveying</b> <b>technique.</b> Technique was applied to measure details in lodging area of Selcuk University, campus area. The results obtained in this area were then used to analyze the practical applicability of the technique by comparing the results from conventional and other ground based <b>surveying</b> <b>techniques...</b>|$|R
