5|$|Susan {{suspects}} Karl {{is having}} an affair with Jade Mitchell (Gemma Pranita), but is disappointed to learn that it was Malcolm. Karl and Susan get stuck in a storage shed and they reminisce about their past. They share a kiss goodbye and Susan goes to stay with Toadie and Sonya. Susan notices Audrey is not herself and she and Karl learn Audrey is dying. They care for her before she is put to sleep. When Karl goes to bury Audrey in the garden, Susan stops him and says she wants Audrey to be buried <b>somewhere</b> <b>that</b> she can visit often. They argue, but put aside their differences when Audrey's body, which was placed in an esky, is collected by a hard rubbish collector. Karl rescues the esky and he and Susan bury Audrey at Sonya's nursery. Susan soon finds an apartment to move into. Susan accompanies Karl to the funeral of an old friend and they share a drink together. Paul asks Susan to write a negative article about Ajay Kapoor (Sachin Joab) and the community centre plans, but she refuses. She later discovers Paul sabotaged Natasha Williams's (Valentina Novakovic) party by inviting gatecrashers to it, so he could continue his vendetta against Ajay and the police station merger. Susan tells Paul to publish a retraction or she will write an exposé.|$|E
500|$|Even if {{the subject}} of the film is political, Weingartner said, [...] "the whole idea of 'Edukating' is playful. The movie is full of jokes. And happiness. I read <b>somewhere</b> <b>that</b> kids laugh out loud more than 150 times a day. Adults laugh only 10 times a day. Well, I want people to laugh. I want people to go see the film and have fun." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} co-written by co-creators Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz, and was {{directed}} by The Mentalist veteran David M. Barrett. Guest actor Giancarlo Esposito made his second appearance in the series as Magic Mirror/Sidney Glass. Meghan Ory returned as Ruby/Red Riding Hood, while Scott Heindl made his only appearance for the series as Bartholomew. Leading up to the episode broadcast, Kitsis and Horowitz noted that [...] "The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter" [...] would feature consequences of events {{that occurred in the}} previous episode. Horowitz explained, [...] "Emma is in a raw emotional place, trying {{to come to terms with}} her feelings about what she discovered about Graham. Graham is also in a very raw emotional place because he's clearly conflicted and it's this cauldron of emotions that leads to the kiss." [...] Kitsis added that, [...] "We're really excited that the kiss that you've seen is really just the jumping off point of the story we're telling. It's not like it ends with the kiss, it starts with that and it takes us <b>somewhere</b> <b>that</b> we're excited to show you." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode further {{develops}} {{the relationship between}} Bree and Chuck, which is complicated by her involvement in the cover-up. [...] "Bree’s dilemma {{is the fact that}} she’s falling for a cop and trying to cover up this crime that she was sort of the ringleader on," [...] Daily explained. [...] "So her thing is instead of balancing work and pleasure, it’s balancing crime and pleasure." [...] Cross stated, [...] "I think we’ll figure out if that’s really a big love for her or if she’s able to let it go." [...] Jonathan Cake, who appeared as Chuck in four episodes during the seventh season, was promoted to series regular with this episode. On the relationship between Bree and Chuck, Cake stated: [...] "As a detective, he's sort of drawn to this woman who seems both quite proper and conservative and yet can't seem to stop herself from being drawn into these sort of crazy, lurid scenarios. There's a sort of wild streak in Bree <b>somewhere</b> <b>that</b> he thinks is really interesting." [...] To prepare for the role, Cake watched key episodes of the series focusing on Bree's previous relationships.|$|E
500|$|The film {{originally}} {{had a different}} ending to the one later released in America under the title Shades of Fear. Miramax co-founder Harvey Weinstein requested that the ending be reworked prior to distribution, and Winterson was highly unhappy at being asked to write an additional conclusionary scene. Winterson's preferred ending sees Rex Goodyear burn the painting he believes to be fraudulent, only to discover he actually had the genuine item in his possession all along, and has now destroyed it. This ties in with the major theme of the film in Winterson's eyes, whereby [...] "Duncan, Gabriel, Miss Bead and Miss Quim all find something valuable where they least expected it, Rex Goodyear finds that the things we value are very often worthless." [...] Winterson has called Weinstein [...] "a bully who knows the gentle touch", referring to the new ending as [...] "the most expensive words I will ever write". While she believes that the new ending is satisfying, she feels the film has lost some dimensions which were important to her and concludes: [...] "It is a good movie {{but it is not}} the movie I thought we could make. [...] I do like Great Moments but there is another film in there <b>somewhere</b> <b>that</b> has got lost." ...|$|E
500|$|In a {{contemporary}} review, George Kimball of Rolling Stone magazine said that [...] "The Allman Brothers had many fine moments at the Fillmores, and this live double album (recorded March 12th and 13th of this year) must surely epitomize all of them." [...] Kimball cited the band as [...] "the best damn {{rock and roll}} band this country has produced {{in the past five}} years" [...] and said of comparisons to the Grateful Dead at the time, [...] "The range of their material and the more tenuous fact that they also use two drummers have led to what I suppose are inevitable comparisons to the Dead in its better days." [...] Album Reviews|work=Rolling Stone|publisher=Wenner Media|date=August 19, 1971|accessdate=2011-09-25}} In a less enthusiastic review for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau gave At Fillmore East a [...] "B–" [...] grade and said the songs [...] "sure do boogie", but ultimately found it musically aimless: [...] "even if Duane Allman plus Dickey Betts does equal Jerry Garcia, the Dead know roads are for getting <b>somewhere.</b> <b>That</b> is, Garcia (not to bring in John Coltrane) always takes you someplace unexpected on a long solo. I guess the appeal here is the inevitability of it all." ...|$|E

500|$|When {{designing}} the game's main setting, the team {{moved away from}} the traditional enclosed Japanese mansions from previous games in favor of <b>somewhere</b> <b>that</b> blended Eastern and Western architectural tastes to create different gameplay opportunities, described in-game as a Meiji-era hotel. Traditional mansion settings were also included, with more locations being present than in previous games. The color yellow was chosen as the game's image color, while the key words used to describe the plot were [...] "memory", [...] "moon" [...] and [...] "mask". The subtitle refers to the mask that is key to the Kagura Dance Ritual. The mask in turn tied into story themes of the phases of the moon, the nature of memory, and music. During development, Shibata and Kikuchi felt that Grasshopper and Nintendo's involvement helped them reevaluate the series formula and try out new things. After development, Kikuchi said that the three companies' varying ideas on the project made the development [...] "a complete and utter mess", though it ultimately worked out well. The characters were designed by Takeyasu Sawaki, who had previously worked in that capacity on Ōkami and [...] The music was composed by Masafumi Takada and Etsuko Ichikawa. As with the previous two games, Mask of the Lunar Eclipse features songs by Japanese singer Tsuki Amano: the theme song [...] "Zero Tuning", and the ending theme [...] "Noise".|$|E
500|$|Following Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons, Joe 90 was {{purposely}} {{conceived and}} developed to {{be a different}} kind of Supermarionation series, placing the narrative emphasis less on action, advanced technology and visual effects and more on characterisation and plotlines subscribing more to the spy thriller genre than science fiction. Co-creator Gerry Anderson explained, [...] "The show majored on its characters, which I thought were all very good. The puppets had become so lifelike, I now strongly believed that they could carry the action without the usual massive assistance from futuristic hardware." [...] Explaining his inspiration for the series, Anderson remembered his pre-Supermarionation days when he served as an assistant editor for such films as The Wicked Lady, handling recording tape on a daily basis. While pondering on the blanking and re-use of such tape, Anderson made a connection to the human brain's electrical activities, explaining, [...] "I read <b>somewhere</b> <b>that</b> the human brain is controlled by electrical impulses and how thoughts are stored electronically. I started toying with the story potential of a process that would allow the recording of brain patterns and transferring them to another brain. I was really likening it to magnetic recording, where material could be stored or transferred to another tape." [...] When it came to naming the lead character and, from that, the name of the new series, Anderson recalled that on one of his earlier productions, Fireball XL5, the surname [...] "Ninety" [...] had been an early proposal for Colonel Steve Zodiac, and selected it for the new schoolboy protagonist.|$|E

2500|$|Instead, Nelson {{argues that}} the contest must have taken place 40 miles away at the Lewis Tunnel, between Talcott and Millboro, Virginia, where records {{indicate}} that prisoners did indeed work beside steam drills night and day. Nelson also {{argues that the}} verses of the ballad about John Henry being buried near [...] "the white house", [...] "in sand", <b>somewhere</b> <b>that</b> locomotives roar, mean that Henry's body {{was buried in the}} cemetery behind the main building of the Virginia State Penitentiary, which photos from that time indicate was painted white, and where numerous unmarked graves have been found.|$|E
2500|$|Leone {{built upon}} the screenwriter's {{original}} concept to [...] "show {{the absurdity of}} war... the Civil War which the characters encounter. In my frame of reference, it is useless, stupid: it does not involve a 'good cause.'" [...] An avid history buff, Leone said, [...] "I had read <b>somewhere</b> <b>that</b> 120,000 people died in Southern camps such as Andersonville. I was not ignorant {{of the fact that}} there were camps in the North. You always get to hear about the shameful behavior of the losers, never the winners." [...] The Batterville Camp where Blondie and Tuco are imprisoned was based on steel engravings of Andersonville. Many shots in the film were influenced by archival photographs taken by Mathew Brady. As the film took place during the Civil War, it served as a prequel for the other two films in the trilogy, which took place after the war.|$|E

2500|$|Prior to Colbert's announcement, Colbert Report {{staff had}} {{consulted}} representatives of both parties. Joe Werner, {{executive director of}} the State Democratic Party, had been called by a Colbert representative three weeks before the announcement, for queries regarding filing dates and other requirements. Katon Dawson, chairman of the State GOP, had been called on October 15, a handful of hours before the show declaring Colbert's candidacy was taped. Estimations of Colbert's chances were mixed, but neither party disputed his ability to place himself on their respective ballots. The dual Republican–Democrat nature of the run, however, elicited opposing responses from the party representatives. Dawson found nothing in his party's regulations preventing Colbert from running on both ballots, but Werner was more leery at the suggestion. Said Werner: [...] "I don’t believe you can do that." [...] "It's in our rules <b>somewhere</b> <b>that</b> you can't be on two ballots." ...|$|E
2500|$|Barton {{achieved}} widespread {{recognition by}} delivering lectures {{around the country}} about her war experiences in 1865–1868. During this time she met Susan B. Anthony and began a long association with the woman's suffrage movement. She also became acquainted with Frederick Douglass and became an activist for civil rights. [...] After her country wide tour she was both mentally and physically exhausted and under doctor's orders to go <b>somewhere</b> <b>that</b> would take her far from her current work. She closed the Missing Soldiers Office in 1868 and traveled to Europe. In 1869, during her trip to Geneva, Switzerland, Barton {{was introduced to the}} Red Cross and Dr. Appia; who later would invite her to be the representative for the American branch of the Red Cross and even help her find financial beneficiaries {{for the start of the}} American Red Cross. She was also introduced to Henry Dunant's book A Memory of Solferino, which called for the formation of national societies to provide relief voluntarily on a neutral basis.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{legal issue}} related to Let's Play is disclosure. More popular YouTube {{channels}} will sometimes receive free promotional copies of games from developers and publishers {{in advance of}} release to promote the title. According to the US Federal Trade Commission, players that review or create commentary for such games should disclose the game if they subsequently make money from the review to stay within ethical business practices. In one specific scenario, John Bain, who has previously argued for clear disclosure of paid reviews, has revealed that he and several others were approached by Plaid Social, a marketing outlet for Warner Bros. Entertainment and offered promotional copies of the upcoming [...] in exchange for meeting very specific tasks in their presentation. Bain refused on these terms, but other commentators had taken the deal without disclosure of the deal, raising {{the issue of how}} many of these works were made through paid reviews. If an advertiser or marketer is offering to someone to write a review that is favorable it, should be disclosed <b>somewhere</b> <b>that</b> is quite visible. According to Mary Engle, associate director for Advertising Practices at the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), [...] "disclosure should basically be unavoidable by the viewer. Perhaps the most important line to note. If a viewer doesn't automatically see or hear the disclosure without having to go hunting for it, it's not legal disclosure". In the aforementioned situation with Plaid Social and Warner Bros., the FTC issued a fine against the two companies, which Warner Bros. settled with in July 2016 and agreed to new regulations that would fine them in the future should such sponsored videos not be disclosed. A similar situation arose {{as a result of the}} skin gambling issues raised in mid-2016, with the FTC further refining its guidelines related to promotional advertising on social media in September 2017.|$|E

[...] After she recorded the vocals, McKee pulled Luke and Martin aside and told them her idea, to which they responded, [...] "Well why didn't you {{say that in the}} first place?". The chorus was rewritten, and the line [...] "Skin tight jeans" [...] was taken from the early [...] "trying me on" [...] version. When the final version was finished, McKee said, [...] "We were all so pumped that it had paid off. I remember Max sitting back and saying 'I wish we could bottle this feeling'. It was really magical." [...] Perry commented that even though the song was rewritten many times, she was [...] "so happy to finally get <b>somewhere</b> <b>that</b> we all agreed on" [...] after it was finished. During an interview in June 2010, Perry confirmed [...] "Teenage Dream" [...] as the second single from the album, and said that the song was about [...] "kind of like feeling that way when you were a teenager: really emotional, really invested..... It's intense being in love and being a teenager." [...] After confirming that [...] "Teenage Dream" [...] was also the title of the album, she explained that it was a throwback to her teenage years, as she thought back to her youth while contemplating marriage to her boyfriend Russell Brand. She added, [...] "To me, this year is pretty heavy. I am going to be getting married and putting out this record, and there is so much going on that it's nice to think of those young dreams." ...|$|E
