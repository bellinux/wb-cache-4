The focus is on countries with sufficiently adequate universal health care for their citizens. The article argues for equal access to this kind of health care for citizens and migrants alike—including migrants at special risk such as asylum seekers or undocumented migrants. Several objections against equal access are raised, such as the cosmopolitan approach being too restrictive or too permissive, or the consequences being undesirable; but the objections are largely refuted. Some special cases in which a restriction of equal access to health <b>care</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> justified are described: humanitarian crisis, short term tourism, and the case of a migrant or refugee who will stay only very briefly on a state’s territory...|$|R

30|$|Of course, process {{measures}} {{of quality of}} care for diabetes patients exist {{in the form of}} the guidelines of the American Diabetes Association (2007). These guidelines have been developed based on the best available evidence and, where conclusive evidence is still lacking, consensus of expert opinion. Yet, many aspects of a patient’s care are beyond the purview of the guidelines. Also, using clinical guidelines to measure quality of care for patients with multiple diseases can be problematic because guidelines focus on the optimal treatment of a single condition (Kerr et al. 2001). For an individual with several coexistent disorders the treatment demands for one disease may conflict with recommendations for others. Finally, intangible aspects of <b>care</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> difficult to capture in written guidelines.|$|R

In the early 1990 s, the Florida Healthy Kids (FHK) demonstration extended Medicaid-like HMO coverage to indigent children {{in the public schools}} of Volusia County, Florida. The study finds that uninsured student months in area public schools were likely reduced by one-half. Utilization and cost levels for these indigent enrollees proved to be indistinguishable from commercial clients; and measures of access, utilization, and satisfaction for enrollees were in line with (and in some cases, superi-or to) non-enrollees with private insurance. Overall, these results suggest the value of using schools as a medium for providing coverage, and the importance of taking deliberate steps to manage access to reduce non-financial barriers to care...|$|R

40|$|A {{total of}} 19 people with {{dementia}} were interviewed {{as part of}} a study into unmet respite care need amongst caregivers and day-care attenders in Shef eld. Some important contextual debates associated with conducting social research with people with dementia are considered. These include informed consent, competency, and how the interests of caregivers and people with dementia are bound together. A form of process consent was used in conducting semi-structured interviews with day-care attenders. Day-care attenders spoke about ‘being here’ in a number of ways. These include their initial experiences, their sources of satisfaction and their sense of being in families. These substantive ndings and the associated methodological insights suggest day-care attenders have important things to say as service-users if appropriate strategies for listening are employed.

40|$|Providing health {{services}} to drug abuse treatment clients improves their outcomes. Using {{data from a}} 1995 national survey of 597 outpatient drug abuse treatment units, {{this article examines the}} relationship between these units' organizational features {{and the degree to which}} they provided onsite primary care and mental {{health services}}. In two-stage models, Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations-certified and methadone programs delivered more on-site primary care services. Units affiliated with mental health centers provided more on-site mental health services but less direct medical care. Units with more dual-diagnosis clients provided more on-site mental health but fewer on-site HIV/AIDS treatment services. Organizational features appear to influence the degree to which health services are incorporated into drug abuse treatment.

30|$|Taking public {{transportation}} {{has been associated}} with greater commute times and increased number of modes of travel (Beirao and Cabral 2007; van Vugt et al. 1996), which can be an added inconvenience in accessing health services. One way to address these travel-related barriers to <b>care</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> to improve connectivity and frequency of available transit (1) between different clinic locations within a medical system that are highly accessed by HIV patients, and (2) in areas of high poverty and HIV prevalence, in which a large proportion of people living with HIV may rely on {{public transportation}} as a sole means for travel. Although rarely utilized to specifically deliver HIV care in the United States, mobile clinics may also help address travel-related barriers for those with limited transportation options.

40|$|Veterinary {{medicine}} has advanced considerably {{over the past}} 100 years. Nowhere is this {{more evident than in}} companion animal medicine. The extant veterinary literature is replete with therapies and techniques, procedures and protocols, all designed to enhance animal health. These all depend on the assumption that animals displaying signs of ill health will be presented for veterinary care, as no amount of knowledge can be brought to bear on an animal of which the veterinary surgeon is unaware. In a short communication summarised on p 584 of this week's Veterinary Record, Mike Davies (2011) calls this assumption into question by demonstrating that a percentage of owners would not seek veterinary attention for an older dog displaying signs of ill health. This, in turn, means that much veterinary knowledge is rendered immaterial, as it cannot be applied. By identifying this lacuna in our understanding, Davies's short communication makes a considerable contribution, as it causes us to look afresh at how optimal veterinary <b>care</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> provided. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{consider}} family day {{care as a}} site in which to explore the personal and social consequences of home-based work. The data are from a questionnaire sent to all registered day care providers in Vermont (N= 225) and from interviews with 28 registered and 34 unregistered family day care providers.

40|$|It is {{proposed}} that an appropriate {{measure of the}} quality of hospital <b>care</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> a measure of its outcome—the death rate, corrected {{to take into account the}} fact that certain types of hospitals have a larger proportion of seriously ill patients than others. Various indicators of case severity are assessed, under the constraints of simplicity and practicality of data collection and of calculation; and it is shown that the easily determined factor of length of hospital stay, especially when corrected so as to exclude external factors not related to the patient's condition, offers a valuable approach to such an adjustment of the crude death rate. An equation {{is proposed}} by which the crude death rate in general hospitals may be adjusted for case severity by the length of stay, corrected in turn by the occupancy rate, to give a more objective measure of hospital performance than the currently used measures based chiefly on evaluation of the hospital's staffing, equipment, and services...|$|R
40|$|AIM: The {{objectives}} {{of the study were}} to investigate the lived experience of older people in residential aged care facilities (RACFs) in Australia, to explore their perceptions of their lives in RACFs and how <b>care</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> improved. METHODS: This qualitative study used a phenomenological approach to explore the lived experience of older persons in RACFs across two Australian states. In-depth interviews regarding independence, dignity, autonomy, communication and relationships were conducted with 18 participants. The interviews were audiotaped, transcribed and thematically analysed. RESULTS: Three themes emerged reflecting the reality of RACF life for these participants: (i) loss of autonomy, dignity and control; (ii) valuing important relationships; and (iii) resigned acceptance. CONCLUSION: Older people were not included in decision-making and found it difficult to maintain their autonomy and dignity, and forge meaningful relationships. They traded their independence and dignity for the safety and assistance they needed; however, they accepted this trade-off with stoicism and remained positive...|$|R
