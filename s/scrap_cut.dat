40|$|Abstract: A {{continuous}} production aluminum smelter produces S tons/day of molten metal which is cast as long cylindrical rods and swan into logs according to customer's specification for the dimensions and {{the composition of}} the logs.

Meeting demand leads to the over production of order lengths (inventory) and sawing yields unwanted off <b>cuts</b> (<b>scrap)</b> which have to be recycled. The price of aluminum and the competitiveness of the industry mean that inventory and scrap costs have to be minimized while meeting demand. This leads to a multiobjective cutting stock problem which, in its general form, is an integer nonlinear problem. It is considered that the scrap is a fuzzy parameter and a technique for the solution is presented. A practical problem example of the method implementation for the solution algorithm is proposed...|$|R
