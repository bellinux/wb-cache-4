5|$|In April 2009 it {{was decided}} by CITES that an {{in-depth}} review of the commercial dolphin trade conducted from the Solomon Islands should take place, this after the IUCN Cetacean Specialist Group {{came to the conclusion}} that insufficient population data exists to prove the <b>sustainability</b> <b>of</b> the wild captures and the current export quota of 100 animals per year. The Solomon Island Dolphin Abundance Project was established to provide data on the size of the local Indo-Pacific Bottlenose population and the <b>sustainability</b> <b>of</b> the dolphin hunts. A report published in March 2013 as a result of this effort indicated that the capture of dolphins in the Solomon Islands can only be sustainable at a very low rate and that previous rates of capture as seen between 2003 and 2013 would not be sustainable in the future.|$|E

The international community has identified many industries whose practices have been known to violate social sustainability, and many of these industries have organizations in place that aid in verifying the social <b>sustainability</b> <b>of</b> products and services. The Equator Principles (financial industry), Fair Wear Foundation (garments), and Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition are examples of such organizations and initiatives. Resources are also available for verifying the life-cycle of products and the producer or vendor level, such as Green Seal for cleaning products, NSF-140 for carpet production, and even labeling of Organic food in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Even though {{geothermal}} {{power is}} globally sustainable, extraction {{must still be}} monitored to avoid local depletion. Over the course of decades, individual wells draw down local temperatures and water levels until a new equilibrium is reached with natural flows. The three oldest sites, at Larderello, Wairakei, and the Geysers have experienced reduced output because of local depletion. Heat and water, in uncertain proportions, were extracted faster than they were replenished. If production is reduced and water is reinjected, these wells could theoretically recover their full potential. Such mitigation strategies have already been implemented at some sites. The long-term <b>sustainability</b> <b>of</b> geothermal energy has been demonstrated at the Lardarello field in Italy since 1913, at the Wairakei field in New Zealand since 1958, and at The Geysers field in California since 1960.|$|E

40|$|A {{growing demand}} for {{sustainability}} makes <b>sustainability</b> as one <b>of</b> the significant debates of nowadays. Energy saving {{is one of the}} main criteria to be considered in the context <b>of</b> <b>sustainability.</b> Reducing energy use in buildings is one of the most important ways to reduce humans’ overall environmental impact. Taking this into consideration, study of different design strategies, which can assist in reducing energy use and subsequently improving the <b>sustainability</b> level <b>of</b> today's buildings would be an essential task. The <b>sustainability</b> level <b>of</b> a building is highly affected by the <b>sustainability</b> performance <b>of</b> its components. One of the main building components, which can have a great impact on energy saving and <b>sustainability</b> level <b>of</b> the building, is its facade. The aim of this study is to investigate on the role <b>of</b> facade in <b>sustainability</b> enhancement <b>of</b> the contemporary buildings of Iran. In this study, the concept <b>of</b> <b>sustainability</b> in architecture, the building facades, and their relationship to sustainability are explained briefly. Following that, a number of contemporary Iranian buildings are discussed and analyzed in terms of different design strategies used in their facades in accordance to the sustainability concepts. The methods used in this study are descriptive and analytic.

He angrily denounced French nuclear testing in the Pacific, and after consistently voting for the ruling Liberal Party coalition as it ruled for the past few decades, signed an open letter backing the opposition Labor Party of Gough Whitlam, which took power in 1972. However, he soon spoke out against Whitlam's lack of action against tobacco advertising and French nuclear tests.

Intermittent supply, which was common in many cities, has become less frequent. In 2004, 61% of the wastewater collected through sewers was being treated. Remaining challenges include the need to further increase wastewater treatment, to reduce the high level of non-revenue water hovering around 50% and to expand access to adequate sanitation in rural areas. The investment required to comply with EU standards in the sector, especially in wastewater treatment, is estimated to be in the order of €2 billion per year, more than double the current level of investment.|$|E

5|$|Wood small-reed (Calamagrostis epigejos) {{is present}} {{in the center of the}} site and threatens to spread into {{herbaceous}} areas. It compromises <b>sustainability</b> <b>of</b> stations, including man orchid and bee orchid populations. Two distinct zones can be distinguished. The first, where the wood small-reed has a very high rate of recovery, is not hosting any heritage value. It is mowed early and disposed of. Grazing is not possible at the moment. The second, on the contrary, not densely colonized by this plant is much more of a fragile situation due to the presence of orchids and the sickle-bearing bush cricket or long-horned groundhopper. Differentiated management is applied depending on the issues. At orchid stations, slight thinning is done early by hand pruning. The less dense areas where the grass is sparse (conducive to the long-horned groundhopper (Tetrix tenuicornis)) are pulled. In the newly opened areas, a systematic and annual pulling avoids expansion. Finally, dense areas, well exposed, are left in that state.|$|E

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{formulate}} the process of measuring and benchmarking the performance <b>of</b> <b>sustainability</b> development <b>of</b> organizations as a multi-criteria analysis problem and presents an objective approach for solving the problem in a simple manner. Design/methodology/approach - An objective approach is developed for benchmarking the <b>sustainability</b> development performance <b>of</b> individual organizations in the context of multi-criteria analysis. The relative importance <b>of</b> the <b>sustainability</b> indicators is determined independent of the subjective preferences of the decision maker using the concept of information entropy. A modified technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solutions is used for effectively incorporating the objective indicator weights into the process of determining the overall performance <b>of</b> <b>sustainability</b> development <b>of</b> each organization. As a result, an unbiased overall ranking of individual organizations on the performance <b>of</b> their <b>sustainability</b> development can be obtained. Findings - The proposed approach is applicable for measuring and benchmarking the performance <b>of</b> organizational <b>sustainability</b> development through the presentation of an example. Originality/value - The originality of the paper is on the development of the objective approach within the context of multi-criteria analysis for measuring and benchmarking the performance <b>of</b> <b>sustainability</b> development <b>of</b> individual organizations...|$|R
