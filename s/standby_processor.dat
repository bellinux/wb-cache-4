50|$|Standby mode of {{operation}} is the simplest of a dual-processor configuration. Normally one processor is in standby mode. The <b>standby</b> <b>processor</b> is brought online only when the active processor fails. An important requirement of this configuration is ability of <b>standby</b> <b>processor</b> to reconstitute the state of exchange system when it takes over the control; means to determine which of the subscriber lines or trunks are in use.|$|E
50|$|In small exchanges, {{this may}} be {{possible}} by scanning the status signals {{as soon as the}} <b>standby</b> <b>processor</b> is brought into action. In such a case only the calls which are being established at the time of failure are disturbed. In large exchanges {{it is not possible to}} scan all the status signals within a significant time. Here the active processor copies the status of system periodically into secondary storage. When switchover occurs the recent status from the secondary memory is loaded. In this case only the calls which change status between last update and failure are affected. The shared secondary storage need not to be duplicated and simple unit level redundancy would suffice. 1ESS switch was a prominent example.|$|E
40|$|Because {{replacement}} parts for the existing facility data acquisition interface system at TA- 55 have become scarce and {{are no longer}} being manufactured, reliability studies were conducted to assess various possible replacement systems. A new control system, based on Allen-Bradley Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), {{was found to have}} a likely reliability 10 times that of the present system, if the existing Continuous Air Monitors (CAMS) were used. Replacement of the old CAMs with new CAMs will result in even greater reliability as these are gradually phased in. The new PLC-based system would provide for hot <b>standby</b> <b>processors,</b> redundant communications paths, and redundant power supplies, and would be expandable and easily maintained, as well as much more reliable. TA- 55 is the Plutonium Processing Facility which processes and recovers Pu- 239 from scrap materials...|$|R
