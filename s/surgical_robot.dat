25|$|Surgical {{removal of}} the prostate, or prostatectomy, is a common {{treatment}} either for early stage prostate cancer or for cancer that has {{failed to respond to}} radiation therapy. The most common type is radical retropubic prostatectomy, when the surgeon removes the prostate through an abdominal incision. Another type is radical perineal prostatectomy, when the surgeon removes the prostate through an incision in the perineum, the skin between the scrotum and anus. Radical prostatectomy can also be performed laparoscopically, through a series of small (1cm) incisions in the abdomen, with or without the assistance of a <b>surgical</b> <b>robot.</b>|$|E

30|$|Originating {{from the}} military’s vision for telemedicine, <b>surgical</b> <b>robots</b> were {{intended}} to provide patients (e.g. injured soldiers) in remote locations access to advanced medical care. In their present realization however, <b>surgical</b> <b>robots</b> are used to perform on-site complex procedures in which the surgeon is decoupled from the patient. Instead of controlling the surgical instruments by direct hand manipulation, surgeons use a console, which in turn tele-manipulates surgical instruments that are mounted on {{the arms of a}} robot. This type of robot-assisted surgery provides increased precision, flexibility and control to a surgeon compared to traditional practice. For example, the surgeon is in a seated position at the console, has the freedom to relax or reorient his/her hands without moving the surgical instruments and has better access to the surgical area. Additionally, compared to traditional laparoscopic surgical systems, robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery (RALS) offers stereoscopic vision that offers better depth perception for the surgeon.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The paper {{describes}} a design specification {{process for the}} development of novel and intelligent <b>surgical</b> <b>robots.</b> Nowadays, <b>surgical</b> <b>robots</b> are usually controlled by the sur-geons manually by using teleoperation. The possibility to carry out simple surgical actions automatically {{has been the subject of}} academical research, but very few real-world applications exist. The main objective of this research is to address realistic case studies and develop systems and methods to provide surgeons with autonomous robotic assistants, performing basic surgical actions by combining sensing, dexterity and cognitive capabilities. This goal can only be achieved by means of a formal and rigorous assesment of surgical requirements, so that they can be analysed and translated into behavioral specifications for an autonomous robotic system. Therefore, the paper describes the application of Requirements Engineering to surgical knowledge formalization and propose a methodology for the transformation of requirements into formal models of robotic tasks.
