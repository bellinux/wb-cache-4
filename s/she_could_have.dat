5|$|The Polícia Judiciária {{questioned}} why, when Kate discovered Madeleine was missing, she had {{run to the}} tapas restaurant {{leaving the}} twins alone in 5A, when <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> used her cell phone or shouted to the group from 5A's rear balcony.|$|E
5|$|Grant Ellis {{is taken}} to Susanne Modeski by Scully so she can confront him about why he gave the drug to the {{government}}. She is furious as <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been killed had she not checked Langly the night before. Ellis admits that he only betrayed her because the government threatened his own life. Timmy arrives, guns down Grant Ellis, and takes Susanne to the Lone Gunmen's suite.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Nagle had a Pomeranian and a Bulldog, but {{was promised}} <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> a larger dog once her {{schooling}} was completed. In 1913 her dream came to fruition with {{the purchase of}} her first Irish Wolfhound, Manin Michael, for £5. James Nagle subsequently registered the dog with the Kennel Club, before it {{was transferred to the}} ownership of Mr and Mrs Nagle, and its name changed to Sir Michael of Sheppey in May 1917. Food shortages during the First World War resulted in an official prohibition on dog breeding, but Nagle ignored it and bred her first litter from a bitch called Lady Alma of Sheppey.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the war Rodd {{returned}} home, but {{the marriage}} was essentially over; although remaining on friendly terms, the couple led separate lives. Mitford's visit to France in late 1945 had revived her longing to be there, and in April 1946, having given up working in the shop the previous month, she left London to make her permanent home in Paris; she never lived in England again. She was a prolific letter writer, and kept contact with her large cohort of friends by a voluminous correspondence. According to Hastings, she developed many of her friendships far further on paper than <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> done through normal social intercourse.|$|E
5|$|Foster and Eddy {{finally arrived}} at Truckee Lake on March 14, {{where they found}} their {{children}} dead. Keseberg told Eddy that he had eaten the remains of Eddy's son, and Eddy swore to murder Keseberg if they ever met in California. George Donner and one of Jacob Donner's children were still alive at Alder Creek. Tamsen Donner had just arrived at the Murphy cabin, and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> walked out alone but chose {{to return to her}} husband, even though she was informed that no other relief party was likely to be coming soon. Foster and Eddy {{and the rest of the}} third relief left with four children, Trudeau, and Clark.|$|E
5|$|On 17 April 1555, Elizabeth was {{recalled}} {{to court}} to attend {{the final stages of}} Mary's apparent pregnancy. If Mary and her child died, Elizabeth would become queen. If, on the other hand, Mary gave birth to a healthy child, Elizabeth's chances of becoming queen would recede sharply. When it became clear that Mary was not pregnant, no one believed any longer that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> a child. Elizabeth's succession seemed assured.|$|E
60|$|THE NEWLY BORN. Oh yes: I will be {{more than}} <b>she</b> <b>could</b> ever <b>have</b> been.|$|R

5|$|There was {{no blood}} on her feet or other debris, such as the sugar {{that was on the}} downstairs floor. Low traces of lead were found on her hands and {{forehead}} at postmortem, but the levels were consistent with the everyday handling of things around the house. A scientist, Mr Elliott, testified that if she had loaded 18 cartridges into a magazine he would expect to see more lead on her hands. The {{blood on her}} nightdress was consistent with her own, and no trace of firearm-discharge residue was on it. Given that she was wearing just a nightdress, {{it was hard to see}} how <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> carried the cartridges.|$|E
5|$|Todd {{discovers that}} the beggar woman {{was his wife}} Lucy, whom he {{believed}} to be dead, and that Mrs. Lovett deliberately misled him so <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> him to herself. Todd pretends to forgive her and dances with her before hurling her into the bakehouse oven, then cradles Lucy's dead body in his arms. Toby appears, enraged at Mrs. Lovett's death, and Todd allows Toby to slit his throat with his own razor. Toby leaves as Todd bleeds to death over his dead wife.|$|E
5|$|Taking {{precautions}} against further resistance, Darius sent {{soldiers to}} seize Intaphernes, {{along with his}} son, family members, relatives and any friends who were capable of arming themselves. Darius believed that Intaphernes was planning a rebellion, {{but when he was}} brought to the court, there was no proof of any such plan. Nonetheless, Darius killed Intaphernes's entire family, excluding his wife's brother and son. She was asked to choose between her brother and son. She chose her brother to live. Her reasoning for doing so was that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> another husband and another son, but she would always have but one brother. Darius was impressed by her response and spared both her brother's and her son's life.|$|E

5|$|The Michiganensian {{described}} the defeat as follows:"There had been {{every reason to}} expect a victory from Chicago. Michigan had played strong and consistent foot ball throughout her schedule – Chicago had been erratic and unsteady. But there is certainly no sport more full of surprises than foot-ball, and the Thanksgiving Day contest of '96 furnished as sensational a surprise in as exciting a contest as had ever come off on a western gridiron. There was one great difference {{in the character of}} the play of the two teams. Michigan was playing her stock game of football, hard and steady, the game <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been depended on to play at any time. Chicago seemed to have been trained and nerved to this one game. There could have been little doubt what the result of a series of contests would have been. But this one game, Chicago won by good generalship, by the most advantageous use of her greatest resource – a magnificent player in a telling place.|$|E
5|$|Yuri, {{also known}} as , has a {{determined}} personality but is secretly very sensitive and protective. She invites Otonashi to join the SSS, an organization she founded and leads which fights against God. She is smart and decisive when making operations and decisions. She carries a silver Beretta 92. Not only is she skilled with a gun, but she is also capable in close range hand-to-hand combat, which is shown when she fends off Angel's hand sonic with a combat knife. She vowed to fight against God after her three younger siblings were murdered by burglars looking for valuables and never forgave herself for failing to prevent their deaths. She is an effective leader, but does not think so. She regrets even fighting with Kanade later in the story, because she feels <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been great friends with her. She disappears after the graduation ceremony.|$|E
5|$|On October 14, 1853, {{following}} the National Woman's Rights Convention held in Cleveland, Ohio, Stone and Lucretia Mott addressed Cincinnati’s first women’s rights meeting, arranged by Henry Blackwell, a local businessman {{from a family}} of capable women, who had taken an interest in Stone. After that successful meeting, Stone accepted Blackwell's offer to arrange a lecturing tour for her in the western states – considered then to be those west of Pennsylvania and Virginia. Over the following thirteen weeks, Stone gave over forty lectures in thirteen cities, during which a report to the New York Tribune said she was stirring the West on women’s rights “as it is seldom stirred on any subject whatsoever.” After four lectures in Louisville, Stone was begged to repeat the entire course and told she was having more effect there than <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> anywhere else. An Indianapolis newspaper reported that Stone “set about two-thirds {{of the women in the}} town crazy after women’s rights and placed half the men in a similar predicament.” St. Louis papers said her lectures attracted the largest crowds ever assembled there, filling the city’s largest auditorium beyond its capacity of two thousand. Chicago papers praised her lectures as the best of the season, and said they were inspiring discussion and debate in the city’s homes and meeting places. When Stone headed home in January, 1854, she left behind incalculable influence.|$|E

5|$|Ripley's {{performance}} in the first series won her a nomination for Best TV Comedy Actress at the British Comedy Awards 1999. For her {{performance in}} the third series (2000), in which her character separates from her husband and dates another man (played by Ben Miles), she was nominated for the British Academy Television Award for Best Actress. During pre-production of the fourth series (2001), Ripley announced to the producers {{that she would be}} leaving the show, partly because {{she did not want to}} spend five months living in Manchester away from her home in London and wanted to spend more time with her husband, and partly to take other roles which she would otherwise not be able to do. She asked the writer Mike Bullen to either kill off Jenny or have her lose a limb. Bullen refused and instead wrote a plot in which Jenny moves to New York. Ripley returned to the series for a guest appearance in the final episode (2003). She had originally planned not to return to the show, but reprised the role so <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> an on-screen record of the final stages of her pregnancy with her first child.|$|E
5|$|In Final Fantasy XIII-2, Serah is {{the only}} one who remembers Lightning being on Gran Pulse after she is taken to Valhalla, with all the others believing she sacrificed herself to save Cocoon. She {{eventually}} becomes a teacher in the village of New Bodhum, the town she and Snow help build on Gran Pulse, before it is invaded by monsters three years after the fall of Cocoon. Serah is aided by Noel Kreiss, who tells her of Lightning's fate and his own mission. After Serah accepts Noel's offer to be brought to Lightning, the two embark on a journey across time to find her sister. In the process, Serah encounters Caius Ballad, while learning from Paddra Nsu-Yeul that she possesses the same detrimental ability as her to see the future. Despite learning that she would die herself if she continues seeing visions of the future, Serah resolves to change the future for everyone's sake. However, after Caius's defeat and returning to Gran Pulse five hundred years in her future, Serah has another vision and dies moments before Gran Pulse is infected by Valhalla's chaos. Serah appears to Lightning in Valhalla as a spirit, telling her she knew that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> died from her visions but still took the risk regardless. Serah promises Lightning that they will see each other again as long as Lightning promises to remember her. In Lightning Returns, Serah's soul, which has been kept safe within Lightning, is removed and cast away by Bhunivelze. Lumina acts as a shelter for Serah's soul, resulting in the two being similar in appearance. Bhunivelze also creates a false version of Serah to keep Lightning in line. This false Serah, who develops feelings for her 'sister' arrives when Lightning intends to become the protector of the new world and persuades her to accept her vulnerabilities and call for aid. The real Serah reunites with Lightning and her allies, and travels with them to the new world.|$|E
