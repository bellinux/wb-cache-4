25|$|More recently, {{the problem}} of {{definition}} has been addressed by observing overall brain activity {{in the form of}} characteristic EEG patterns. Each stage of sleep and wakefulness has a characteristic pattern of EEG which can be used to identify the stage of sleep. Waking is usually characterized by beta (12–30Hz) and gamma (25–100Hz) depending on whether there was a peaceful or stressful activity. The onset of sleep involves slowing down of this frequency to the drowsiness of alpha (8–12Hz) and finally to theta (4–10Hz) of Stage 1 NREM sleep. This frequency further decreases progressively through the higher stages of NREM and REM sleep. On the other hand, the amplitude of sleep waves is lowest during wakefulness (10–30μV) and shows a progressive increase through the various stages of sleep. Stage 2 is characterized by sleep spindles (intermittent clusters of waves at sigma frequency i.e. 12–14Hz) and K complexes (sharp upward deflection followed by slower downward deflection). Stage 3 sleep has more sleep spindles. Stages 3 and 4 have very high amplitude delta waves (0–4Hz) and are known as slow wave sleep. REM sleep is characterized by low amplitude, mixed frequency waves. A <b>sawtooth</b> <b>wave</b> pattern is often present.|$|E
25|$|A {{waveform}} generator {{is a fundamental}} module in a sound synthesis system. A {{waveform generator}} usually produces a basic geometrical waveform with a fixed or variable timbre and variable pitch. Common waveform generator configurations usually included two or three simple waveforms and often a single pseudo-random-noise generator (PRNG). Available waveforms often included pulse wave (whose timbre can be varied by modifying the duty cycle), square wave (a symmetrical pulse wave producing only odd overtones), triangle wave (which has a fixed timbre containing only odd harmonics, but is softer than a square wave), and <b>sawtooth</b> <b>wave</b> (which has a bright raspy timbre and contains odd and even harmonics). Two notable examples of systems employing this technology comprise the Nintendo Game Boy portable game console, and the Commodore 64 personal computer. The Game Boy uses two pulse channels (switchable between 12.5%, 25%, 50% and 75% wave duty cycle), a channel for 4-bit PCM playback, and a pseudo-random-noise generator. The Commodore 64, however, used the MOS Technology SID chip which offered 3 channels, each switchable between pulse, saw-tooth, triangle, and noise. Unlike the Game Boy, the pulse channels on the Commodore 64 allowed full control over wave duty cycles. The SID was a very technically advanced chip, offering many other features including ring modulation and adjustable resonance filters.|$|E

2500|$|The Gibbs {{phenomenon}} {{was first}} noticed and analyzed by Henry Wilbraham in a 1848 paper. The paper attracted little attention until 1914 {{when it was}} mentioned in Heinrich Burkhardt's review of mathematical analysis in Klein's encyclopedia. In 1898, Albert A. Michelson developed a device that could compute and re-synthesize the Fourier series. A widespread myth says that when the Fourier coefficients for a square wave were input to the machine, the graph would oscillate at the discontinuities, and that {{because it was a}} physical device subject to manufacturing flaws, Michelson was convinced that the overshoot was caused by errors in the machine. In fact the graphs produced by the machine were not good enough to exhibit the Gibbs phenomenon clearly, and Michelson may not have noticed it as he made no mention of this effect in his paper [...] about his machine or his later letters to Nature. [...] Inspired by some correspondence in Nature between Michelson and Love about the convergence of the Fourier series of the square wave function, in 1898 J. Willard Gibbs published a short note in which he considered what today would be called a <b>sawtooth</b> <b>wave</b> and pointed out the important distinction between the limit of the graphs of the partial sums of the Fourier series, and the graph of the function that is the limit of those partial sums. [...] In his first letter Gibbs failed to notice the Gibbs phenomenon, and the limit that he described for the graphs of the partial sums was inaccurate. [...] In 1899 he published a correction in which he described the overshoot at the point of discontinuity (Nature: April 27, 1899, p.606). In 1906, Maxime Bôcher gave a detailed mathematical analysis of that overshoot, coining the term [...] "Gibbs phenomenon" [...] and bringing the term into widespread use.|$|E

When slewing occurs, further {{increases in the}} input signal {{have no effect on}} the rate of change of the output. Slewing is usually caused by the input stage saturating; the result is a constant current [...] driving a capacitance [...] in the amplifier (especially those capacitances used to implement its frequency compensation); the slew rate is limited by [...]Slewing is associated with the large-signal performance of an op-amp. [...] Consider, for example, an op-amp configured for a gain of 10. [...] Let the input be a 1 V, 100kHz <b>sawtooth</b> <b>wave.</b> That is, the amplitude is 1 V and the period is 10 microseconds. Accordingly, the rate of change (i.e., the slope) of the input is 0.1 V per microsecond. [...] After 10x amplification, the output should be a 10 V, [...] 100kHz sawtooth, with a corresponding slew rate of 1 V per microsecond. [...] However, the classic 741 op-amp has a 0.5 V per microsecond slew rate specification, so that its output can rise to no more than 5 V in the sawtooth's 10 microsecond period. Thus, if one were to measure the output, it would be a 5 V, 100kHz sawtooth, rather than a 10 V, 100kHz sawtooth.Next consider the same amplifier and 100kHz sawtooth, but now the input amplitude is 100 mV rather than 1 V. [...] After 10x amplification the output is a 1 V, 100kHz sawtooth with a corresponding slew rate of 0.1 V per microsecond. [...] In this instance the 741 with its 0.5 V per microsecond slew rate will amplify the input properly.Modern high speed op-amps can have slew rates in excess of 5,000 V per microsecond. However, it is more common for op-amps to have slew rates in the range 5-100 V per microsecond. [...] For example, the general purpose TL081 op-amp has a slew rate of 13 V per microsecond. [...] As a general rule, low power and small bandwidth op-amps have low slew rates. [...] As an example, the LT1494 micropower op-amp consumes 1.5 microamp but has a 2.7kHz gain-bandwidth product and a 0.001 V per microsecond slew rate.|$|E
40|$|The rhythmic {{movement}} of the microtubular axostyle in the termite flagellate, Pyrsonympha vertens, was analyzed with polarization and electron microscopy. The protozoan axostyle is birefringent {{as a result of}} the semi-crystalline alignment of- 2, 000 microtubules. The birefringence of the organelle permits analysis of the beat pattern in vivo.

The anterior portion of the beating axostyle has effective and recovery " phases with each beat thereby simulating the flexural motion of a beating cilium.
