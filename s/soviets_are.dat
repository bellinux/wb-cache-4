5|$|In {{a seminar}} at the Woodrow Wilson Institute on May 20, 2009, {{and based on}} an {{extensive}} analysis of the Vassiliev notebooks taken from the KGB archives, John Earl Haynes, Harvey Klehr, and Alexander Vassiliev concluded that Oppenheimer never was involved in espionage for the Soviets. The KGB tried repeatedly to recruit him, but were never successful. Allegations that he had spied for the <b>Soviets</b> <b>are</b> unsupported, and in some instances, contradicted by voluminous KGB and Venona documentation released {{after the fall of}} the Soviet Union. In addition, he had several persons removed from the Manhattan project who had sympathies to the Soviet Union.|$|E

In the novel, the real-life {{destruction of the}} fighter is a cover for a secret US-Canadian continental air-defense initiative that fields a fleet of Arrows. A Polish-Canadian RCAF pilot flies one Arrow on a high-speed reconnaissance flight over Russia to find proof that the <b>Soviets</b> <b>are</b> planning an airstrike on North America.|$|E

50|$|Despite having {{far fewer}} troops than the Soviets, the Finnish forces (12th division) {{repelled}} the Red Army because the <b>Soviets</b> <b>were</b> only prepared to proceed along roads.

25|$|Turing {{discovers that}} Cairncross is a Soviet spy. When Turing confronts him, Cairncross {{argues that the}} <b>Soviets</b> <b>are</b> allies working for the same goals, and threatens to retaliate by {{disclosing}} Turing’s homosexuality if his role as an agent is revealed. When the MI6 agent Stewart Menzies appears to threaten Clarke, Turing reveals that Cairncross is a spy. Menzies reveals he knew this already, and planted Cairncross among {{them in order to}} leak messages to the Soviets for British benefit. Fearing for her safety, Turing tells Clarke to leave Bletchley Park, revealing that he is gay and lying about never having cared for her. After the war, Menzies tells the cryptographers to destroy their work and that they can never see one another again or share what they have done.|$|E
500|$|When, in September 1943, Joseph Goebbels was {{informed}} that the German army had {{to withdraw from the}} Katyn area, he wrote a prediction in his diary. His entry for 29 September 1943 reads: [...] "Unfortunately we have had to give up Katyn. The Bolsheviks undoubtedly will soon 'find' that we shot 12,000 Polish officers. That episode is one that is going to cause us quite a little trouble in the future. The <b>Soviets</b> <b>are</b> undoubtedly going to make it their business to discover as many mass graves as possible and then blame it on us".|$|E
500|$|From Russia, with Love {{is one of}} the few {{stories by}} Fleming in which the <b>Soviets</b> <b>are</b> the main enemy, {{although}} Eco considers Bond's Russian opponents [...] "so monstrous, so improbably evil that it seems impossible to take them seriously". Fleming introduced what was a new development for him, a female opponent for Bond, although much like the former adversaries in the series, Rosa Klebb is described as being physically repulsive, with poor hygiene and gross tastes. Eco—and Anthony Synnott, in his examination of aesthetics in the Bond novels—consider that despite Klebb being female, the character is more akin to a [...] "sexually neuter" [...] individual. Red Grant was Fleming's first [...] "psychotic opponent" [...] for Bond, according to Benson. Charlie Higson—who later wrote the Young Bond series—finds Grant to be [...] "a very modern villain: the relentless, remorseless psycho with the cold dead eyes of a 'drowned man'." ...|$|E

500|$|The adventurers {{evade the}} city's guardians, {{gain access to}} the temple, and find it filled with {{artifacts}} from many ancient civilizations, identifying the aliens as extra-dimensional [...] "archaeologists" [...] studying the different cultures of Earth. They find and enter a chamber containing the crystal skeletons of thirteen alien beings, one missing its skull. Spalko arrives and presents the skull to its skeleton, whereupon the aliens reanimate and telepathically offer a reward in ancient Mayan through Oxley. A portal to their dimension becomes activated, and the other remaining <b>Soviets</b> <b>are</b> drawn into the portal. As Jones, Marion, Mutt, and Oxley–who has regained his sanity–escape, the thirteen beings fuse into one, and in the process of receiving the overwhelming knowledge, Spalko is disintegrated and sucked into the portal. Mac is caught in the vortex while trying to scrounge some of the treasure, and even though Jones offers him his whip to pull him to safety, he willingly lets go and is sucked in. Jones and the others escape and watch as the city crumbles, revealing a flying saucer rising from under the ground and vanishing, while the hollow in the valley floor left by its departure is flooded by the waters of the Amazon.|$|E
2500|$|In his 2009 book, Andrzej Leon Sowa of the Jagiellonian University {{states that}} about 325,000 Polish {{citizens}} were deported by the Soviets in 1940–41. The {{number of the}} deaths for which the <b>Soviets</b> <b>are</b> responsible [...] "probably did not exceed 100,000", and {{the same applies to}} the killings perpetrated by Ukrainian nationalists.|$|E

Over a bridge game with Captain Daniel McClafferty of the submarine [...] and Commander Edward Morris of the destroyer , Toland deduces that the <b>Soviets</b> <b>are</b> actually preparing for war. He is then stationed to Intentions, an intelligence unit who is tasked to assess intentions of the Soviets, {{under the command of}} Marine Colonel Chuck Lowe, who supports Toland's conclusions. Impressed by Toland's findings, the Commander of the United States Fleet Forces Command promotes Toland and transfers him to active duty aboard the [...]|$|E

The <b>Soviet</b> {{government}} <b>was</b> able to regain majority control of the CER by playing the secret protocols off each other and outmaneuvering the Chinese. The Soviets allowed the Chinese to think they were adding workers loyal to their government. However, in reality, the <b>Soviets</b> <b>were</b> creating more jobs on the railway and hiring Soviet workers. In the end, the Soviets controlled 67% of all positions on the CER.|$|R

2500|$|With {{regard to}} {{strategic}} planning, Brown shared {{much the same}} concerns as his Republican predecessors—the need to upgrade U.S. military forces and improve collective security arrangements—but with a stronger commitment to arms control. Brown adhered {{to the principle of}} [...] "essential equivalence" [...] in the nuclear competition with the Soviet Union. This meant that [...] "Soviet strategic nuclear forces do not become usable instruments of political leverage, diplomatic coercion, or military advantage; nuclear stability, especially in a crisis, is maintained; any advantages in force characteristics enjoyed by the <b>Soviets</b> <b>are</b> offset by U.S. advantages in other characteristics; and the U.S. posture is not in fact, and is not seen as, inferior in performance to the strategic nuclear forces of the Soviet Union." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, {{most of the}} Soviet gains {{listed above}} were matched by the United States within a year, and {{sometimes}} within weeks. In 1965, the United States started to achieve many firsts (such as the first successful space rendezvous), which were important steps in a mission to the Moon. Furthermore, NASA and others say that these gains by the <b>Soviets</b> <b>are</b> not as impressive as they seem; {{that a number of}} these firsts were mere stunts that did not advance the technology greatly, or at all, e.g., the first woman in space. In fact, {{by the time of the}} launch of the first manned Earth-orbiting Apollo flight (Apollo 7), the USSR had made only nine spaceflights (seven with one cosmonaut, one with two, one with three) compared to 16 by the United States. In terms of spacecraft hours, the USSR had 460 hours of spaceflight; the United States had 1,024 hours. In terms of astronaut/cosmonaut time, the USSR had 534 hours of manned spaceflight whereas the United States had 1,992 hours. By the time of Apollo 11, the United States had a lead much wider than that. (See List of human spaceflights, 1961–1970, and refer to individual flights for the length of time.) ...|$|E

50|$|Although the Nationalist 5th Route Army {{was ready}} later {{for another round}} of offensives after resting and regrouping, the {{nationalist}} high command had a different idea. The nationalist high command reasoned that its 5th Route Army was better deployed for another siege of the central communist base area instead of further encirclement of the Hunan-Jiangxi <b>Soviet.</b> This <b>was</b> because if the central leadership in the Jiangxi-Fujian <b>Soviet</b> <b>was</b> destroyed, the smaller Hunan-Jiangxi <b>Soviet</b> <b>was</b> estimated as {{not being able to}} last for long; thus, it was not worth wasting the valuable troops to be tied down on smaller local communist bases. Accordingly, the Nationalist 5th Route Army was ordered away to complete its deployment for its original purpose against their main target, and the Hunan-Jiangxi <b>Soviet</b> <b>was</b> left alone for the time being.|$|R
