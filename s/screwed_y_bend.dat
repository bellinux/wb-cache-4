The intrinsic curvature of the vesicle leads to an enhanced coupling between bending and stretching modes which acts to suppress the shape fluctuations on large scales. This effect is explicitly calculated for a cylindrical shape of the vesicle. For a cylinder with radius r 0, the shape fluctuations exhibit the crossover scale L*≃(r 02 κ/Y) 1 / 4, where κ and <b>Y</b> are the <b>bending</b> rigidity and the (2 –dimensional) Young modulus of the polymerized membrane.

40|$|AbstractThe long wavelength, low-frequency {{modes of}} motion are the {{relevant}} motions {{for understanding the}} continuum mechanical properties of biomolecules. By examining these low-frequency modes, {{in the context of}} a spherical harmonic basis set, we identify four elastic moduli that are required to describe the two-dimensional elastic behavior of capsids. This is in contrast to previous modeling and theoretical studies on elastic shells, which use only the two-dimensional Young's modulus (<b>Y)</b> and the <b>bending</b> modulus (κ) to describe the system. Presumably, the heterogeneity of the structure and the anisotropy of the biomolecular interactions lead to a deviation from the homogeneous, isotropic, linear elastic shell theory. We assign functional relevance of the various moduli governing different deformation modes, including a mode primarily sensed in atomic force microscopy nanoindentation experiments. We have performed our analysis on the T = 3 cowpea chlorotic mottle virus and our estimate for the nanoindentation modulus is in accord with experimental measurements...|$|R

Often patient expose to x-ray until the surgeon get it right. The gap between manual distal locking procedure and fully automatic distal locking procedure is huge. The biggest and hardest is the system must able to recognize an X-ray image and all the relevant content inside it.

40|$|Graduation date: 1985 Presentation date: 1984 - 06 - 07 The Bend pumice and Tumalo tuff are {{products}} of a plinian eruption which occurred sometime between 0. 89 and 2. 6 m. <b>y.</b> The <b>Bend</b> pumice is a poorly consolidated, air-fall vitric lapilli tuff, which overlies a zone of reworked tephra. Perlitic obsidian in the reworked zone probably represents {{the remains of a}} dome which filled the eruptive vent and is chemically related to the Bend pumice magma. Detailed grain size analysis of the air-fall part of the Bend pumice shows that the eruptive vent was located approximately 10 - 20 km west of Bend, Oregon. Grain size variations in vertical section are probably related to fluctuations in the diameter of the vent rather than interruptions in deposition of the Bend pumice. The Tumalo tuff is nonwelded to moderately welded ash-flow tuff which directly overlies the Bend pumice. Lack of discernable normal grading in the upper 50 cm of the Bend pumice indicates that the Tumalo tuff was emplaced before the Bend pumice was completely deposited and leads {{to the conclusion that the}} Tumalo tuff is the product of collapse of the Bend pumice eruption column. The Tumalo tuff was formed by one episode of flow and has a well developed basal 2 a layer. Variations in the distal character of layer 2 a are thought to represent complex flow conditions in the head of the Tumalo tuff ash flow. Mixed pumices also are found in proximal Tumalo tuff deposits. The Bend pumice and Tumalo tuff are peraluminous and rhyodacitic. Within analytical uncertainties, they have identical major, minor, and trace element abundances. Both contain fresh hornblende in the mineral assemblage Plg + Opx + Mgt + Zr + Ap. The hornblende appears to have been a liquidus phase and indicates that the rhyodacite evolved under high pressure, hydrous conditions. A hight La to Ce ratio and a strong negative Eu anomaly in the B-T rhyodacite further indicates that the Bend pumice and Tumalo tuff evolved under physical conditions quite distinct from other rhyodacites in the central Oregon High Cascades analysed by Hughes (1982). Mixed pumices in the Tumalo tuff represent the incomplete mixing between Bend-Tumalo rhyodacite and a dacitic magma. Trace element modeling fails to provide an unequivocally common path of crystal fractionation between these two magmas. The magmas can not be directly related through thermogravitational diffusion or assimilation. While mixed pumice formation is usually attributed to mixing of genetically related magmas, Tumalo tuff mixed pumices were produced through the mixing of genetically unrelated magmas...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, expeditious {{developments}} in the electrical and electronic territory due to endless demands from the markets have driven the operation frequency of the system into the gigahertz region. This had evolved into a more effectual-performance system, but also inflicts a lot of difficulties to the designers, for examples Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) problem and Signal Integrity (SI) issue. The integrity of circuit layout is inevitably compromised by bifurcated traces for examples T -junctions, <b>Y</b> -junctions, right-angle <b>bends</b> or left-angle-bends and steps planar transmission lines in order to fulfil {{the needs of a}} denser printed circuit boards. However, bifurcation often induces impedance mismatching resulting in reflection, radiated emission and power loss. This research is to investigate the radiated emission of 0 °, 45 ° and 90 ° bent microstrip lines by using an analytical fomulation followed by computer simulation and experimental measurements for validation purposes. The novelty of this research is the implementation of travelling wave mode (TWM) method on bent microstrip line by adopting the equivalent wire model. The reliability of the formulation is proven from the agreement between the analytical results and computer simulation, especially in predicting the E¢ component. The analytical results clearly showed the significance of the bent in altering the radiation pattern of the microstrip line. Increasing the operating frequency and microstrip's width tend to produce more emission. One of the electric field components, Eo is almost symmetrical with respect to the bent angle/ 2 line on the plane of the microstrip line, while the E¢ component radiates strongly into the bent angle + bent anglel 2 direction. The magnetic field on the bent microstrip line experiences an abrupt change at the location of the bent. This change becomes apparent as the bent angle increases. Future work should focus on improving the analytical formulation so that it can predict the Eo component with higher accuracy. Furthermore, effort can also be made on generating algorithm which takes into consideration the composite electric field radiation of all the bents on a practical printed circuit board...|$|R
40|$|The Adriatic region {{forms an}} {{intermediate}} continental foreland overthrust along its northeastern margin by the southwest vergent Dinaric thrust belt in Eocene-Oligocene time and along its southwestern margin by the northeast vergent Apennine thrust belt in Pliocene-Quaternary time. Orogenic activity within these thrust belts {{was accompanied by}} the development of two superposed foredeep basin systems of opposite polarity and different ages. Using well log, biostratigraphic, and seismostratigraphic data, the geometry of this composite basin system was reconstructed along three profiles at beginning of Quaternary, middle Pliocene, beginning Pliocene, and beginning Eocene time. Modeling of reconstructed geometries using a thin elastic sheet approximation yields a range of acceptable effective elastic plate thicknesses for the central Adriatic region of Te = 5 – 10 km for Eocene-Oligocene flexure and Te = 10 – 15 km for Pliocene-Quaternary flexure (although an upper bound for Te could not be established on one of the three profiles). These results are consistent with a constant effective elastic plate thickness of Te = 10 km for the Adriatic lithosphere and preclude the possibility that significant weakening of the Adriatic plate occurred between flexural events. Modeling of incremental deflections between Pliocene and Quaternary time gives results consistent with constant values of Te = 10 km in the central Adriatic and Te = 15 km in the northern Adriatic and Po Plain and shows little evidence for weakening of the plate during Pliocene-Quaternary time. Thus within the resolution of the data presented in this paper, there is little evidence for viscous relaxation of the lithosphere on time scales between about 2 and 50 m. <b>y.</b> Analysis of <b>bending</b> of an idealized lithosphere with a simple brittle-elastic-ductile rheology, and a low to moderate thermal gradient suggests that the small values of Te observed within the Adriatic region can be readily understood as the result of bending of the lithosphere to unusually high curvature (4 × 10 − 6 m− 1) and do not require unusually high temperatures within the foreland lithosphere. The same rheological model is also consistent with the absence of significant inelastic yielding for at least 50 m. y. after the cessation of loading. An apparent unbending of the Adriatic lithosphere began in early Quaternary time, approximately coeval with the cessation of major thrusting within the Apennine thrust belt. The three-dimensional pattern of Quaternary deflection makes it difficult to attribute this phenomenon to local depositional processes and suggests that unbending reflects a fundamental change in the subduction process in early Quaternary time. Our preferred interpretation is that unbending {{is the result of a}} diminution of forces acting on the subducted Adriatic lithosphere at mantle depths...|$|R
40|$|With the {{expanding}} use of automation in machining technology, the modern manufacturing aims toward achieving high productivity without close human supervision. This aim requires reliable machining processes. The chip control {{is one of}} major concern in automated machining system. It {{is essential for the}} safety of the machining operation, the maintenance of good surface finish on the machined parts, the convenience of chip disposal, and the possible power reduction. This thesis major deals with theoretical modelling for the 3 -D chip curling process, including geometry and mechanics consideration. These models are then used to develop a computer animation system to simulate the process of chip curling in 3 -D metal cutting. Hence the work described in this thesis is devoted to developing an effective theoretical technique for chip control in automated machining systems. Firstly, a new method to describe the development process of 3 -D chip curling is developed in accord with the mechanics and kinematics characters of chip curling in 3 -D machining. This analysis divided the process of 3 -D chip development into different stages based on the deformation mechanism and characteristics, i. e. chip forming stage, chip curling stage, chip breaking stage, and the kinematical characters according to whether the curled chip, after leaving the rake face, hits the backwall of breaker/groove, or/and workpiece, or/and backface of tool, or/and extends along the chip breaker. Then new basic chip curling forms, up-curling, side-curling and twisting, are proposed based on the continuum mechanics theory. It reveals that a 3 -D curling chip body m a <b>y</b> undergo longitudinal <b>bending,</b> transversal bending and torsional deformations. The analysis provides the fundament for the theoretical modelling of the 3 -D chip curling and breaking. Secondly, a general geometric model of 3 -D chip curling generated by typical chip breakers is developed by introducing the three-dimensional deformation state of the chip curling. The model, so developed, can be used to predict the 3 -D chip curling forms. The prediction includes a group of criteria for the effects of ωx, ω ʸ, ωz and ηo on the chip forms/shapes. The varying tendency of the chip radius and chip pitch with varying ωx, ω ʸ, ωz and ηO is further discussed based on a sensitivity analysis the results of which are summarised graphically. The sensitivity analysis provides a quantitative assessment of the significance of three basic chip curling forms, namely up-curling, side-curling and twisting to the general helical chip form. Thirdly, a set of 3 -D mechanics models of chip curling with chip breaker for the internal resisting forces is developed for the 4 basic chip deformation cases of chip curling process based on the structural mechanics theory, These internal forces, in particular the bending moments and torques are expressed as variations along the length of the curled chip. The set of models considers a spatial force system including the longitudinal bending moment, transversal bending moment and the torsional torque. Then the distribution of the bending moments and torques along the chip body are discussed based on graphically presented calculated results. The models reveal, in theory, new insights into the chip breaking mechanisms. More importantly it provides a new approach to theoretically asses the curling chip breakability. Notably it is shown that the bending moment and torque are the main causes of chip breaking. Furthermore the bending moment and torque in the chip body are caused by the chip breaker and the obstacle the curling chip contacts. Finally, a computer animation system for 3 -D chip curling in machining process is developed based on the 3 -D chip curling developing process, geometry model and mechanics models of 3 -D chip curling presented in the research work. The 3 -D chip animation integrates the chip flow equation, chip curling patterns, chip geometrical features and mathematical expressions for the 3 -D helix surface. Based on the input conditions (namely chip breaker parameters and cutting conditions), a computer program is developed to convert the parametric prediction into a series of dynamic graphs demonstrating the chip formation process. Then the animation results are analysed and compared with the experimental observations. The methodology presented will provide assistance for machine operators to select machining conditions or for process planning designers to confidently and thoroughly plan the cutting process, control chip breakage and evaluate the chip control effect...|$|R
