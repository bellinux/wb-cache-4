60|$|Across {{the park}} to the olfactories of Mr. Coulson came other unmistakable, characteristic, copyrighted smells of spring that belong to the-big-city-above-the-Subway, alone. The smells of hot asphalt, {{underground}} caverns, gasoline, patchouli, orange peel, sewer gas, Albany grabs, Egyptian cigarettes, mortar and the undried ink on newspapers. The inblowing air was <b>sweet</b> <b>and</b> <b>mild.</b> Sparrows wrangled happily everywhere outdoors. Never trust May.|$|E
60|$|Years rolled by, and the Mustang Valley prospered. Missionaries went there, and {{a little}} church was built, and to the blessings of a fertile land were added the far greater blessings of Christian light and knowledge. One sad blow fell on the Widow Varley's heart. Her only brother, Daniel Hood, was murdered by the Indians. Deeply and long she mourned, and it {{required}} all Dick's efforts {{and those of the}} pastor of the settlement to comfort her. But from the first the widow's heart was sustained by the loving hand that dealt the blow, and when time blunted the keen edge of her feelings, her face became as <b>sweet</b> <b>and</b> <b>mild,</b> though not so lightsome, as before.|$|E
5|$|Sweet onions have {{a greater}} water and sugar content than cooking onions. This makes them <b>sweeter</b> <b>and</b> <b>milder</b> tasting, but reduces their shelf life. Sweet onions can be stored refrigerated; they have a shelf life of around 1 month. Irrespective of type, any cut pieces of onion are best tightly wrapped, stored away from other produce, and used within two to three days.|$|R

Ben Lomond and the three pointed-topped mountains of [...] Loch Lomond, which we had seen from the garrison, were very majestic [...] under the clear sky, the lake perfectly calm, the air <b>sweet</b> <b>and</b> <b>mild.</b> [...] I felt that it was much more interesting to visit a place where we [...] have been before than it can possibly be the first time, except under [...] peculiar circumstances.

40|$|This NebGuide {{discusses}} {{the possibilities for}} and needs of a fall garden. Though often overlooked by the gardener, planting vegetables in July and August for fall production is an excellent practice. Late plantings of cool- and warm-season vegetables can extend the harvest long after spring-planted crops have ceased production. Most cool-season vegetables grow as well as or better than those planted in the spring as they mature during shorter, cooler days. Flavors of vegetables maturing in the cool, crisp days of autumn are often <b>sweeter</b> <b>and</b> <b>milder</b> than those grown during hot summer weather. This {{is especially true for}} cole crops such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower and kale. Plants such as lettuce and spinach which tend to bolt (develop flower stalks) in late spring, stay productive due to the shorter day lengths. For those who love to garden, extending the harvest as long as possible helps ward off the dreariness of cloudy autumn days...|$|R

50|$|As {{the name}} sweet lime suggests, the flavor is <b>sweet</b> <b>and</b> <b>mild,</b> but retains {{the essence of}} lime.

The flavor is a bit flatter than most citrus due to its lack of acidity. It can be {{compared}} to limeade and pomelo.|$|E

The flavor in good conditions and when fully ripe is pleasingly sweet when sliced raw - excellent for hors d'oeuvres. The ripe flesh is soft, juicy and extremely tender.|$|E
50|$|The {{process begins}} by {{pressing}} the tobacco leaves into a cake {{about an inch}} thick. Heat from fire or steam is applied, and the tobacco is allowed to ferment.

These slices must be broken apart, as by rubbing in a circular motion between one's palms, before the tobacco can be evenly packed into a pipe. Flavoring is often added before the leaves are pressed. English Cavendish uses a dark flue or fire cured Virginia (DEC), which is steamed and then stored under pressure to permit it to cure and ferment for several days or weeks.|$|E
5000|$|Gujarati {{food has}} famously been {{described}} as [...] "the haute cuisine of vegetarianism" [...] and meals have a subtle balance of <b>sweet,</b> tart <b>and</b> <b>mild</b> hot sensations on the palate.

Far beneath them, the waves tossed {{themselves}} tumultuously in mid-sea, or rolled a white surf-line upon the long beaches, or foamed against the rocky cliffs, with a roar that was thunderous, in the lower world; although it became a gentle murmur, like the voice of a baby half asleep, before it reached the ears of Perseus.

The level of heat varies according to the capsaicin of each pepper. Although it's not always the case, the peppers grown towards August/September tend to contain more capsaicin than the ones of June/July.|$|E
