In samples which are largely free of survivorship bias, look-ahead biased methodologies and missing returns still affect statistics. In samples with no true persistence, the spurious persistence caused by survivorship bias in the presence of single-period <b>survival</b> <b>criteria</b> never reaches the magnitude found in recent empirical studies. When fund returns are truly persistent, the simulations reveal an attrition effect, distinct from survivorship bias. The systematic disappearance of poor performers causes mean persistence measures to differ from those in a hypothetical sample in which funds never disappear, even in tests which incorporate all data on disappearing funds. The magnitude and direction of this effect depends on the return generating process. We also examine the specification and power of the persistence tests. The t-test for the difference between top and bottom portfolios ranked by past performance is the best specified under the null and among the most powerful against the alternatives we consider. ...|$|E

For {{this to be a}} viable mechanism, a significant fraction of organic compounds must survive the high temperatures due to impact. We have undertaken three-dimensional numerical simulations to track the thermodynamic state of a comet during oblique impacts. The comet was modeled as a 1 -km water-ice sphere impacting a basalt plane at 11. 2 km/s; impact angles of 15 {sup o} (from horizontal), 30 {sup o}, 45 {sup o}, 65 {sup o}, and 90 {sup o} (normal impact) were examined. The survival of organic cometary material, modeled as water ice for simplicity, was calculated using three criteria: (1) peak temperatures, (2) the thermodynamic phase of H{sub 2 }O, and (3) final temperature upon isentropic unloading. For impact angles {{greater than or equal to}} 30 {sup o}, no organic material is expected to survive the impact. For the 15 {sup o} impact, most of the material survives the initial impact and significant fractions (55 %, 25 %, and 44 %, respectively) satisfy each <b>survival</b> <b>criterion</b> at 1 second. Heating due to deceleration, in addition to shock heating, plays a role in the heating of the cometary material for nonnormal impacts.

40|$|The greater {{empirical}} {{backdrop of}} this thesis is the apparent paradox {{of why the}} flat tax has not been adopted in any Western European country, while it has been implemented in many Central and Eastern European countries. Limiting my scope, I explain how Estonia became the first European country to introduce the flat tax under the Laar 1 government and why the same proposal was not chosen when Norway underwent a tax reform under the Bondevik 2 government. My theoretical ambition is to incorporate the explanations of the path dependence theory into the Multiple Streams model. My claim is that what Kingdon (1984) calls âsurvival criteriaâ in the âproposal streamâ, which I shorten down to value acceptability, technical and political feasibility and budgetary implications, provide the path dependence theory with a direction in which {{to search for the}} existence of mechanisms that inhibit change. The path dependence theory, on the other hand, provides the Multiple Streams model with an explanation of the forces that make the existence of a "policy window" and the coupling of the problem, proposal and politics streams by a "policy entrepreneur" necessary conditions for radical reform. I argue that whether or not a proposal is adopted depends {{on the extent to which}} these conditions are fulfilled, that is, the seriousness of the problem that the proposal is coupled to, the extent to which it fulfills the three <b>survival</b> <b>criteria,</b> the favorability of the political conditions, the centrality of the policy entrepreneurs and the size of the policy window. The case studies show important differences in the two countries in all of these seven conditions. The <b>survival</b> <b>criteria</b> were clearly influenced by path dependence mechanisms and proved to be important obstacles hindering the adoption of the proposal in Norway, while the short experience with progressive income taxes meant that these mechanisms were of little importance in Estonia. The proposalâs chances of adoption were in Estonia enhanced by it being coupled to a problem perceived as extremely serious, the fact that the most important policy entrepreneur was the prime minister, and the existence of an extraordinary large policy window, caused primarily by what I choose to call the "limited attention" mechanism. In Norway the problem was attempted coupled to a problem not considered serious enough to justify a radical reform, the proposal lacked a well placed entrepreneur who was willing to invest time, energy and reputation, and the policy window for reform was considerably smaller. Case studies of two countries do not provide results that are generalizable to the whole universe of European states. However, many of the features that made it difficult to introduce the flat tax in Norway are common to most Western European countries and the transition from Communism means that the Central and Eastern European countries also share many of the same characteristics that made it possible to introduce the reform in Estonia. I therefore argue that my findings are relevant also to the understanding of the greater empirical backdrop...|$|E
40|$|From {{its early}} {{beginnings}} onwards mankind has put to test many different society forms, and this fact raises {{a complex of}} interesting questions. The objective {{of this paper is}} to present a general population model which takes essential features of any society into account and which gives interesting answers on the basis of only two natural hypotheses. One is that societies want to survive, the second one that individuals in a society would in general like to increase their standard of living. We start by presenting a mathematical model which may be seen as a particular type of a controlled branching process. All conditions of the model are justified and interpreted. After several preliminary results about societies in general we can show that two society forms should attract particular attention, both from a qualitative and a quantitative point of view. These are the so-called weakest-first society and the strongest-first society. In particular we prove then that these two societies stand out since they form an envelope of all possible societies in a sense we will make precise. This result (the Envelopment Theorem) is seen as significant because it is paralleled with precise <b>survival</b> <b>criteria</b> for the enveloping societies. Moreover, given that one of the "limiting" societies can be seen as an extreme form of communism, and the other one as being close to an extreme version of capitalism, we conclude that, remarkably, humanity is close to having already tested the limits.

In addition, electronic screening was made of the ?grey literature? using the System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe - Open Grey, covering the period from January 2005 up to and including April 2016. A total of 728 articles were obtained from the initial screening process. Of these articles, 24 fulfilled the inclusion criteria.

40|$|Water {{distribution}} networks optimization is {{a challenging}} problem {{due to the}} dimension and the complexity of these systems. Since {{the last half of}} the twentieth century this field has been investigated by many authors. Recently, to overcome discrete nature of variables and non linearity of equations, the research has been focused on the development of heuristic algorithms. This algorithms do not require continuity and linearity of the problem functions because they are linked to an external hydraulic simulator that solve equations of mass continuity and of energy conservation of the network. In this work, a NSGA-II (Non-dominating Sorting Genetic Algorithm) has been used. This is a heuristic multi-objective genetic algorithm based on the analogy of evolution in nature. Starting from an initial random set of solutions, called population, it evolves them towards a front of solutions that minimize, separately and contemporaneously, all the objectives. This can be very useful in practical problems where multiple and discordant goals are common. Usually, one of the main drawback of these algorithms is related to time consuming: being a stochastic research, a lot of solutions must be analized before good ones are found. Results of this thesis about the classical optimal design problem shows that is possible to improve results modifying the mathematical definition of objective functions and the <b>survival</b> <b>criterion,</b> inserting good solutions created by a Cellular Automata and using rules created by classifier algorithm (C 4. 5). This part has been tested using the version of NSGA-II supplied by Centre for Water Systems (University of Exeter, UK) in MATLABÂ® environment. Even if orientating the research can constrain the algorithm with the risk of not finding the optimal set of solutions, it can greatly improve the results. Subsequently, thanks to CINECA help, a version of NSGA-II has been implemented in C language and parallelized: results about the global parallelization show the speed up, while results about the island parallelization show that communication among islands can improve the optimization. Finally, some tests about the optimization of pump scheduling have been carried out. In this case, good results are found for a small network, while the solutions of a big problem are affected by the lack of constraints on the number of pump switches. Possible future research is about the insertion of further constraints and the evolution guide. In the end, the optimization of water distribution systems is still far from a definitive solution, but the improvement in this field can be very useful in reducing the solutions cost of practical problems, where the high number of variables makes their management very difficult from human point of view. ...|$|R
