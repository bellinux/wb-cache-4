40|$|The RS:X Olympic <b>sailboard</b> is an all-round board {{designed}} to be raced in 4 to 25 knots of wind, and {{is an example of}} the current state-of-the-art in <b>sailboard</b> design. This board has been chosen as the specific example for an overview of <b>sailboard</b> aero-hydrodynamics. The current article brings together previous research on <b>sailboard</b> sail and fin lift, and applies it to the case of the RS:X <b>sailboard.</b> Measured sail camber and twist, as well as mast stiffness and deflection, are described for realistic upwind racing settings. The three-dimensional force and moment balance of an RS:X sailing upwind is investigated, in order to determine the limits on righting moment, sail lift and fin lift for different wind strengths. Finally a planing analysis is performed on the RS:X <b>sailboard</b> to calculate trim, wetted length and resistance. 1...|$|R

25|$|Windsurfing, or <b>sailboarding,</b> is {{a surface}} water sport using a windsurf board, also {{commonly}} called a <b>sailboard,</b> usually {{two to five}} meters long and powered by wind pushing a sail. In 1948, 20-year-old Newman Darby {{was the first to}} conceive the idea of using a handheld sail and rig mounted on a universal joint so that he could control his small catamaran—the first rudderless <b>sailboard</b> ever built that allowed a person to steer by shifting his or her weight in order to tilt the sail fore and aft. Darby did not file for a patent for his invention. However, he is widely recognized as the inventor of the first <b>sailboard.</b>|$|R
50|$|Twelve-year-old Peter Chilvers {{is often}} cited for inventing a <b>sailboard</b> in 1958. In the 1960s, Jim Drake {{was the first to}} solve many {{problems}} of getting the board to sail while Hoyle Schweitzer was the first to be successful in marketing the <b>sailboard.</b>|$|R

50|$|Speed sailing {{is the art}} {{of sailing}} a craft as fast as {{possible}} over a predetermined route, and having its overall or peak speed recorded and accredited by a regulatory body.
