5|$|In Stage four (authority {{and social}} order {{obedience}} driven), {{it is important}} to obey laws, dictums, and social conventions because of their importance in maintaining a functioning society. Moral reasoning in stage four is thus beyond the need for individual approval exhibited in stage three. A central ideal or ideals often prescribe what is right and wrong. If one person violates a law, perhaps everyone would—thus there is an obligation and a duty to uphold laws and rules. When <b>someone</b> <b>does</b> violate a law, it is morally wrong; culpability is thus a significant factor in this stage as it separates the bad domains from the good ones. Most active members of society remain at stage four, where morality is still predominantly dictated by an outside force.|$|E
5|$|People with prolonged, frequent, {{or close}} contact with people with TB are at {{particularly}} high risk of becoming infected, with an estimated 22% infection rate. A person with active but untreated tuberculosis may infect 10–15 (or more) other people per year. Transmission should occur from only people with active TB – those with latent infection are not thought to be contagious. The probability of transmission {{from one person to}} another depends upon several factors, including the number of infectious droplets expelled by the carrier, the effectiveness of ventilation, the duration of exposure, the virulence of the M. tuberculosis strain, the level of immunity in the uninfected person, and others. The cascade of person-to-person spread can be circumvented by segregating those with active ("overt") TB and putting them on anti-TB drug regimens. After about two weeks of effective treatment, subjects with nonresistant active infections generally do not remain contagious to others. If <b>someone</b> <b>does</b> become infected, it typically takes three to four weeks before the newly infected person becomes infectious enough to transmit the disease to others.|$|E

[...] In another part, during the motivational encouragement, she informs that [...] "there's only two letters difference between 'I Can't' and 'Icon'," [...] while also inspiring the listeners {{to find their own}} greatness, singing: [...] "Just shine your light like a beautiful star / Show the world who you are." [...] Tyson opening speech talks about how he's ‘the best the world's ever seen' and that he [...] "worked hard and sweated [...] tears." [...] He later proclames: [...] "I'm never falling again and if I did, I'll come back." [...] Chance, on the other hand, raps about idolatry.|$|E

His said he left the band for [...] "private and personal reasons, and the physical damage I have done to myself over the years while playing the music that I love". During a Playboy interview with Metallica, Newsted {{said he wanted to}} release an album with his side project, Echobrain. Hetfield was opposed to the idea and said, [...] "When <b>someone</b> <b>does</b> a side project, it takes away from the strength of Metallica", and that a side project is [...] "like cheating on your wife in a way". Newsted said Hetfield had recorded vocals for a song used in the film , and appeared on two Corrosion of Conformity albums. Hetfield replied, [...] "My name isn't on those records. And I'm not out trying to sell them", and pondered questions such as, [...] "Where would it end? Does he start touring with it? Does he sell shirts? Is it his band?" ...|$|E
500|$|In May 1956 Bessie's {{concerns}} about the treatment of prisoners in Walton Prison led to an investigation by Sir Godfrey Russell Vick, which revealed numerous instances of violence {{by members of the}} prison staff, and brought about reforms. In July that year, during a home affairs debate, Bessie demanded tougher regulations on the supply and licensing of air pistols, which under the existing law were readily available to juveniles. She alarmed the house by brandishing two such pistols which, she explained, she had confiscated in the course of her duties as a juvenile court magistrate. When rebuked by the Deputy Speaker, she replied that she had deliberately used shock tactics, reprising her earlier council chamber argument that [...] "no one takes any notice unless <b>someone</b> <b>does</b> something which is out of order, or is unusual". She also campaigned for the rights of larger women to obtain fashionable clothes; using her substantial 50" [...] – 40" [...] – 50" [...] measurements to advantage, she took part in a fashion show aimed at the larger-than-average woman.|$|E

500|$|The trust {{must then}} be {{formally}} constituted, by {{the transfer of}} its property to the trustees. For chattels, merely handing the property to the trustees is sufficient, assuming it comes with the relevant intention to create a trust. In some circumstances, providing the intention and telling the trustees {{where to find the}} property is sufficient, as in Thomas v Times Books. Where the property is land or an equitable interest in land, it must be transferred by writing in accordance with Sections 52-3 of the Law of Property Act 1925. When dealing with shares, the transfer is not complete until a transfer document has been completed and the company has entered the change of ownership in its books. One of the equitable maxims is that [...] "equity will not assist a volunteer"; if <b>someone</b> <b>does</b> not have an interest in property, they cannot bring a court case. When trusts are not properly constituted, the trustees and beneficiaries have no equitable interest in the property, and so are volunteers. There are several exceptions to this maxim. The courts are willing to hear cases where the transfer was not completed, providing the intended beneficiaries or trustees have gained an interest through being made executor of the settlor's estate (the rule in Strong v Bird), or the gift was given donatio mortis causa, or where the settlor did all he could do, as in Re Rose, or where it would be [...] "unconscionable" [...] to hold the gift invalid, as in Pennington v Waine.|$|E

2500|$|Bisexuality is romantic {{or sexual}} {{attraction}} to males and females. The American Psychological Association states that [...] "sexual orientation falls along a continuum. In other words, <b>someone</b> <b>does</b> {{not have to}} be exclusively homosexual or heterosexual, but can feel varying degrees of both. Sexual orientation develops across a person's lifetime–different people realize at different points in their lives that they are heterosexual, bisexual or homosexual." ...|$|E

Chris distracts Kurt, while Max persuades Nancy to stay a virgin. Vicki sticks with Paula, the movie's final girl and Gertie bonds with Blake, a counselor. When Gertie brings up the topic of Billy Murphy, the counselors are alerted {{to the fact that}} the [...] "urban legend" [...] of Billy is [...] "real" [...] and will come to kill them. In a panic, the counselors try to flee the camp. Kurt and Paula drive off, but when Duncan emerges still alive, the car hits him then crashes into a totem pole, resulting in their deaths.|$|E

Driven by his ambition to make ENI a player on par with the Exxons and Totals of the world, Mattei expanded abroad and {{turned his attention to the}} international oil markets. He invented (or at least, used to tell very often) the story of the little cat: [...] "A little cat arrives where a few big dogs are eating in a pot. The dogs attack him and toss him away. We Italians are like that little cat: in that pot there is oil for everybody, but <b>someone</b> <b>does</b> not want to let us get close to it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May and June 2006, Russian media cited {{discrimination}} against Russian companies as one possible {{reason why the}} contemplated merger between the Luxembourg-based steelmaker Arcelor and Russia's Severstal did not finalize. According to the Russian daily Izvestiya, those opposing the merger [...] "exploited the 'Russian threat' myth during negotiations with shareholders and, apparently, found common ground with the Europeans", while Boris Gryzlov, speaker of the State Duma observed that [...] "recent events show that <b>someone</b> <b>does</b> not want {{to allow us to}} enter their markets." [...] On 27 July 2006, the New York Times quoted the analysts as saying that many Western investors still think that anything to do with Russia is [...] "a little bit doubtful and dubious" [...] while others look at Russia in [...] "comic book terms, as mysterious and mafia-run." ...|$|E

2500|$|Though {{her speech}} {{was met with}} much praise from the media, on August 17, it was {{announced}} that anti-gay Russian campaigners would sue Madonna for $10.4 million, arguing that she was promoting [...] "homosexual propaganda" [...] which was against the law, and allegedly [...] "insulted their feelings when she spoke out for gay rights" [...] at the concert. According to one of the 10 activists who filed the lawsuit, [...] "She (Madonna) had been warned with words that she should behave in line with the law and she ignored it. So we will speak in the language of money...maybe <b>someone</b> <b>does</b> not see the link but after Madonna's concert maybe some boy becomes gay, some girl becomes lesbian, fewer children are born as a result and this big country cannot defend its borders—for me it causes moral suffering." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jyotirao Phule (1827–1890) vehemently criticised any {{explanations}} {{that the}} caste system was natural and ordained by the Creator in Hindu texts. If Brahma wanted castes, argued Phule, {{he would have}} ordained the same for other creatures. There are no castes in species of animals or birds, so why should there be one among human animals. In his criticism Phule added, [...] "Brahmins cannot claim superior status because of caste, because they hardly bothered with these when wining and dining with Europeans." [...] Professions did not make castes, and castes did not decide one's profession. If <b>someone</b> <b>does</b> a job that is dirty, {{it does not make}} them inferior; {{in the same way that}} no mother is inferior because she cleans the excreta of her baby. Ritual occupation or tasks, argued Phule, do not make any human being superior or inferior.|$|E
2500|$|If someone {{suspects}} {{they have}} vaginismus, sexual penetration {{is likely to}} remain painful or truly impossible until their vaginismus is addressed. This is a highly frustrating condition, as other people, including doctors, may speculate negatively on the origin or existence of their difficulties. Vaginismus does not mean that <b>someone</b> <b>does</b> not want intercourse or does not love their partner. People with vaginismus may be able to engage in a variety of other sexual activities, as long as penetration is avoided. Sexual partners of vaginismic people may come to believe that vaginismic people do not want to engage in penetrative sex at all, though this may not be true for most such people. There is currently no indication that vaginismus reduces the sexual drive or arousal of affected people, and as such it is likely that many vaginismic people wish to engage in penetrative sex to the same degree as unaffected people, but are deterred by the pain and emotional distress that accompanies each attempt. Psychological pressure to [...] "perform" [...] sexually or become aroused quickly with a partner can deter the person from future attempts and/or cause their vaginismus to become more severe.|$|E

2500|$|During {{a meeting}} between the members of Metallica in January 2001, Newsted {{proposed}} that the band should take a year-long hiatus, and he would use that time to focus on his side-project Echobrain. When the other band members rejected Newsted's proposals, he chose to quit the band. On January 17, as plans were being made for the band to enter the recording studio to record its eighth studio album, Newsted announced his departure. Newsted's statement revealed his departure was based on [...] "private and personal reasons and the physical damage I have done to myself over the years while playing the music that I love." [...] During a Playboy interview with Metallica, Newsted revealed {{that he wanted to}} release an album with Echobrain. Hetfield was against the idea and said, [...] "When <b>someone</b> <b>does</b> a side project, it takes away from the strength of Metallica." [...] Newsted countered his statement by citing Hetfield's contributions to other musical outlets. Hetfield replied, [...] "My name isn't on those records, and I'm not out trying to sell them," [...] and pondered questions such as Where would it end? Does he start touring with it? Does he sell shirts? Is it his band? Newsted's departure from Metallica, along with Hetfield's decision to go to rehab a few months later, almost led to a breakup of the band. After Hetfield rejoined Metallica, the band finished recording St. Anger, with record producer Bob Rock filling the bass slot. Robert Trujillo became the band's new bassist in 2003.|$|E
