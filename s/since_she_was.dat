5|$|Because New Jersey {{had been}} {{recalled}} for {{service in the}} Vietnam War her modernization differed from her sisters {{for a number of}} reasons. When reactivated in 1967 New Jersey had her 20mm Oerlikon and 40mm Bofors anti-aircraft guns removed, and received improved electronic warfare capabilities. This alteration helped reduce the time it took get New Jersey recommissioned: <b>since</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not in her World War II format the only major physical alteration to New Jersey involved the removal of four of her ten 5inch gun mounts {{to make room for the}} Armored Box Launchers. In addition to saving time, this also made New Jersey cheaper to reactivate since the cost needed to modernize the battleship only included the addition of missile and gun system mounts, electronic warfare suites, and improved radar and gun spotter technology.|$|E
5|$|Billie Burke {{objected to}} her role being cast with another actress (Myrna Loy) <b>since</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> also an actress under {{contract}} to the studio and could play herself, but the producers concluded that at that point {{she was not a}} big enough star to play herself in The Great Ziegfeld. However, according to Emily W. Leider, Burke was not keen on playing her younger self and says that Billie Burke's biographer stated that Miriam Hopkins would have been her first choice to play her part, not Loy. Burke herself worked as technical consultant, and although she did not object to Marilyn Miller performing a number, she was influential in the studio's refusal to give her the higher billing and salary she had demanded, which led to Miller walking away from the film.|$|E

That being the case, she was careful not to neglect her studies. She led protests that included a sit-in at the Presidential Palace in Nanjing, where the students were met by Chiang Kai-shek.|$|E

5|$|To {{reinforce}} {{the connection with}} Love's Last Shift and capitalise on its unexpected success, Vanbrugh designed the central roles of Loveless, Amanda, and Sir Novelty for the same actors: John Verbruggen, Jane Rogers, and Colley Cibber. Keeping Rogers as Amanda was not a problem, <b>since</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not an actress that the companies fought over, but holding on to John Verbruggen and Colley Cibber posed challenges, to which Rich rose with energetic campaigns of bribery and re-seduction. Filling {{the rest of the}} large Relapse cast presented a varied palette of problems, which forced some unconventional emergency casting.|$|E
