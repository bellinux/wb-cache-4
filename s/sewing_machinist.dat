Before any garment is made a pattern needs to be produced from the initial garment design. The pattern is usually adapted from a block shape that fits the human form. This is adapted and manipulated to create the desired shape and look of the design. It is then placed onto cloth and the shape of the pattern is cut out. The <b>sewing</b> <b>machinist</b> will then sew the garment together. The exhibition emphasizes the creativity of pattern cutting. The display includes calico garments produced by students and staff in the fashion department at University of Huddersfield.

50|$|The musical {{is based}} on the 2010 film Made in Dagenham, which in turn centred around the true-life events of the Ford <b>sewing</b> <b>machinists</b> strike of 1968. The film principally follows the main {{character}} of Rita O'Grady, who acts as the spokesperson for a group of female workers at Ford's Dagenham plant, who go on strike to fight the inequality that becomes apparent when women workers were to be paid less as they were classed as unskilled. In contrast, their male colleagues were classed as skilled and ultimately received more pay. These actions {{led to the creation of}} the Equal Pay Act 1970. It received four British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) nominations, including Outstanding British film.|$|R

Public memory of the strike's legacy was transmitted to a wider audience through the 2010 feature film Made in Dagenham. This article shows that this was not necessarily how the <b>sewing</b> <b>machinists</b> understood the strike's outcome at the time, or in the period since.

50|$|On 20 February 2002, full {{production}} was discontinued due to overcapacity in Europe {{and the relative}} difficulty of upgrading the 60-year-old site compared with other European sites such as Almussafes (Valencia, Spain) and Cologne. Other factors leading to {{the closure of the}} Auto-assembly line were the need of the site for the new Diesel Centre of Excellence, which produces half of Ford's Diesel Engines worldwide, and the UK employment laws when compared to Spanish, German and Belgian laws. In 2005 Cummins went into a joint venture and offered $15 million (US) to reinstate the factory. Ford and Cummins offered a good redundancy package, billed {{as one of the best}} in UK manufacturing. It is the location of the Dagenham wind turbines. Some 4,000 people now work at the Ford plant.

50|$|As wage-labor became {{increasingly}} formalized during the Industrial Revolution, women were often paid {{less than their}} male counterparts for the same labor, whether for the explicit reason that they were women or under another pretext. The principle of equal pay for equal work arose at the same time, as part of first-wave feminism, with early efforts for equal pay being associated with nineteenth-century Trade Union activism in industrialised countries: for example, a series of strikes by unionised women in the UK in the 1830s. Pressure from Trade Unions has had varied effects, with trade unions sometimes promoting conservatism. However, following the Second World War, trade unions and the legislatures of industrialized countries gradually embraced the principle of equal pay for equal work; one example of this process is the UK's introduction of the Equal Pay Act 1970 in response both to the Treaty of Rome and the Ford <b>sewing</b> <b>machinists</b> strike of 1968. In recent years European trade unions have generally exerted pressure on states and employers for progress in this direction.|$|R
50|$|Brian Harrison says {{polls in}} 1968-69 showed public opinion was moving {{strongly}} {{in favour of}} equal pay for equal work; nearly three-quarters of those polled favoured the principle. A trigger cause for {{the introduction of the}} legislation was the 1968 Ford <b>sewing</b> <b>machinists</b> strike, though the legislation also {{paved the way for the}} UK's entry to the European Community, helping to bring it towards conformity with Article 141 of the Treaty of Rome, which says that 'each Member State shall ensure that the principle of equal pay for male and female workers for equal work or work of equal value is applied.'. The Act came into force on 29 December 1975. The term pay is interpreted in a broad sense to include, on top of wages, things like holidays, pension rights, company perks and some kinds of bonuses. The legislation has been amended on a number of recent occasions to incorporate a simplified approach under European Union law that is common to all member states. The 1970 Act only dealt with equal pay for the same work but in 1975 the EU directive on Equal Pay was passed based on article 119.|$|R

40|$|Background Factors {{influencing}} work-related {{musculoskeletal disorders}} might differ {{in developing and}} developed countries. Aims To assess the prevalence and determinants of musculoskeletal pain in four occupational populations in Sri Lanka. Methods As part of the international Cultural and Psychosocial Influences on Disability study, samples of postal workers, <b>sewing</b> <b>machinists,</b> nurses and computer operators were interviewed about pain at each of six anatomical sites in the past month, and about possible physical and psychosocial risk factors. Associations with prevalent pain were assessed by binomial regression. Results Analysis was based on 852 participants (86 % response rate). Overall, the lower back {{was the most common}} site of pain, with 1 -month prevalence ranging from 12 % in computer operators to 30 % in nurses. Postal workers had the highest prevalence of shoulder pain (23 %), but pain in the wrist/hand was relatively uncommon in all four occupational groups (prevalence rates ranged from 8 % to 9 %). Low mood and tendency to somatize were consistently associated with pain at all six sites. After adjustment for psychosocial risk factors, there was a higher rate of low back pain in nurses and postal workers than in computer operators, a higher rate of shoulder pain in postal workers than in the other occupational populations, and a relatively low rate of knee pain in computer operators. Conclusions Rates of regional pain, especially at the wrist/hand, were lower than have been reported in Western countries. As elsewhere, pain was strongly associated with low mood and somatizing tendency. Differences in patterns of pain by occupation may reflect differences in physical activities...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1997 The {{threat to}} move {{manufacturing}} offshore is perhaps more potent in the garment industry {{than in any}} other. The 1992 campaigners for NAFTA put the garment industry {{in the list of}} likely losers; amidst the winners of expanded free trade, the public was constantly reminded, were consumers. Workers in the industry are thus subjected to extremes in the insecurity that is reported to plague more and more workers. This insecurity serves the economy well, according to the reactions on Wall Street and the Federal Reserve, by reducing the likelihood of inflation and undermining any attempt to organize workers. In the hegemonic neoliberal discourse of free trade, the jobs of <b>sewing</b> <b>machinists</b> are discursively reduced to the unskilled jobs that developing nations (the Third World) are comparatively advantaged to perform as they join the global economy. The outcomes of this marginalization (in the domestic economy) for sewing are complex. First, it rationalizes the low wages paid not only to machinists in the U. S. but also to people sewing in offshore export processing zones. A closer look at the garment industry in this case study of the Seattle manufacturers of outdoor wear reveals that machinists are not only more skilled than this picture suggests, but also that the current trends in garment manufacturing makes those skills even more essential as retailers demand greater flexibility in inventory management. In other words, the information technology that is transforming the industry depends, but rarely acknowledges its dependence, on a skilled workforce. By reifying sewing as low wage women's work (reproducing the gender relations of production) appropriately performed in the Third World and by immigrants in the First, machinists are cast as the Other, people whose interests {{are not the same as}} "ours". I argue that the geography of garment manufacturing can only be understood by looking at the industry as the on-going ever-changing outcome of interwoven processes that are social, cultural, political and economic. For instance, the media paid an enormous amount of attention to the revelation of the "slave-like" conditions of Thai immigrant women working in El Monte, California. These stories are an example of how discourse about the garment industry reproduces the social and cultural relations of the industry, within the larger industrial structure, and within communities...|$|R
