500|$|Juices, {{as well as}} wines, of a {{multitude}} of fruits and berries had been known at least since Roman antiquity and were still consumed in the Middle Ages: [...] pomegranate, mulberry and blackberry wines, perry, and cider which was especially popular in the north where both apples and pears were plentiful. Medieval drinks that have survived to this day include prunellé from wild plums (modern-day <b>slivovitz),</b> mulberry gin and blackberry wine. Many variants of mead {{have been found in}} medieval recipes, with or without alcoholic content. However, the honey-based drink became less common as a table beverage {{towards the end of the}} period and was eventually relegated to medicinal use. Mead has often been presented as the common drink of the Slavs. This is partially true since mead bore great symbolic value at important occasions. When agreeing on treaties and other important affairs of state, mead was often presented as a ceremonial gift. It was also common at weddings and baptismal parties, though in limited quantity due to its high price. In medieval Poland, mead had a status equivalent to that of imported luxuries, such as spices and wines. Kumis, the fermented milk of mares or camels, was known in Europe, but as with mead was mostly something prescribed by physicians.|$|E

50|$|<b>Slivovitz</b> {{was also}} {{distilled}} {{in large quantities}} by local Jewish communities in Poland mainly before World War II. As a popular Passover alcohol <b>Slivovitz</b> had a strong standing among the traditional Orthodox communities in cities of Alexandrów, Stryków, Łódź, Warsaw, and Kraków. Since the end of World War II some state-owned distillers tried to reintroduce the <b>Slivovitz</b> based on Jewish traditions. Pejsachówka was a fitting example of that. The name of this <b>Slivovitz</b> comes directly from the name of Passover holiday which in Polish is called Święto Paschy. At the end of communism in Poland (1989), Pejsachowka has disappeared from the market. One of the Polish distillers created a brand called Śliwowica Paschalna. It was originally attempted as the relaunch of Pejsachowka, but has never reached the standards of its predecessor. This is because originally Pejsachowka was made only from plums, sugar, yeast and water. It is absolutely {{not allowed to be}} combined with any other spirit. Sliwowica Paschalna is <b>slivovitz</b> base mixed with grain spirit to achieve desired alcohol level and mostly to cut production cost. This means it cannot be Kosher for Passover and certainly cannot be compared to Pejsachówka in quality. Another example is Śliwowica Strykowska which is made by a local distiller in cooperation with Łódź Jewish Community. Its brand in English is called Strykover <b>Slivovitz.</b> It holds a Kosher for Passover certificate. Its roots and concept is again tied with the traditions of Pejsachówka and Jewish heritage in past Poland.|$|E
