30|$|As the {{temperature}} in the autoclave dropped to 60 – 70  °C, the bags of substrate were moved to a biosafety cabinet for further cooling and UV light sterilization of surface microorganisms (2 – 3  h). When the substrate was cooled thoroughly each bag was inoculated with about 20  g solid <b>spawn</b> previously cultured <b>in</b> <b>bags</b> with spent P. eryngii substrate. Then the mycelium <b>bags</b> were cultured <b>in</b> the dark (with a closed curtain) at room temperature (18 – 23  °C), with air relative humidity maintained at 65 – 70 % by occasionally adding moisture with a spray humidifier.|$|R
40|$|Sex steroids {{have long}} been known to exist in molluscs, but few {{studies have focused on}} the roles of these {{substances}} in molluscan reproduction. In this study, we demonstrate that injections of estradiol into ripe sea scallops induced <b>spawning</b> <b>in</b> both sexes, testosterone injections induced <b>spawning</b> <b>in</b> males only and progesterone blocked <b>spawning</b> <b>in</b> both sexes. We also show that injections of sex steroids significantly affected subsequent 5 -HT-induced spawning. Injection of estradiol promoted 5 -HT-induced <b>spawning</b> <b>in</b> both sexes and testosterone potentiated <b>spawning</b> <b>in</b> males only. In addition, progesterone inhibited 5 -HT-induced <b>spawning</b> <b>in</b> females while potentiating the <b>spawning</b> <b>in</b> males. These findings are consistent with a hormonal role for steroids in molluscan reproduction and also suggest the possible development of more efficient methods for <b>spawning</b> induction <b>in</b> molluscan aquaculture...|$|R
25|$|Several {{life history}} forms of Arctic {{grayling}} occur: fluvial populations that live and <b>spawn</b> <b>in</b> rivers; lacustrine populations that live and <b>spawn</b> <b>in</b> lakes; and potamodromous populations that live <b>in</b> lakes and <b>spawn</b> <b>in</b> tributary streams.|$|R
50|$|<b>Spawning</b> begins <b>in</b> {{spring and}} {{continues}} to mid-summer depending on water temperature. The western blacknose dace <b>spawn</b> <b>in</b> areas with gravel bottoms unlike other daces who <b>spawn</b> <b>in</b> the beds of other Cyprinids. Since the western blacknose dace is so short lived, only living up to four years, daces begin reproducing after 2 years. Unlike other species of dace the two Ohio Rhinichthys species do not <b>spawn</b> <b>in</b> the nests of larger minnow species.|$|R

50|$|Most of {{the species}} studied <b>spawn</b> <b>in</b> the {{intertidal}} zone, but one species has been observed <b>spawning</b> <b>in</b> freshwater rivers. The eggs are generally attached to the undersides of rocks or are buried in the gravel or stone substrate.|$|R
25|$|Despite <b>spawning</b> <b>in</b> {{estuaries}}, Australian bass rely on floods {{coming down}} river systems into the estuaries throughout the winter period, both to stimulate migration and <b>spawning</b> <b>in</b> adult Australian bass and for strong survival and recruitment of Australian bass larvae.|$|R

They released gametes {{at the same time}} as in the laboratory. One of them, which <b>spawns</b> <b>in</b> April <b>in</b> the laboratory, <b>spawned</b> <b>in</b> the middle of December. This was caused by low sea water temperature in the laboratory. Experimentally, fertilization among the three Types was possible, and the resulting embryos gave rise to nomal young adults.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{diadromous}} gobies, notably Sicydium spp. and Sicyopterus spp., support fisheries based on return migrations of postlarvae (fry) to rivers. Most species are tropical, although close relatives occur in Japan. The life {{history of this}} group has often been incorrectly described as catadromous (<b>spawning</b> <b>in</b> the sea or estuary), whereas anadromous (<b>spawning</b> <b>in</b> rivers) would be more accurate...|$|R
50|$|The {{anadromous}} {{fish populations}} in the lake became landlocked, because those fish could not ascend Lyre River Falls, making a barrier in that direction. Over time, two different subspecies of fish evolved in the lake: the endemic Beardslee trout, a relative of rainbow trout, <b>spawns</b> <b>in</b> the Lyre River above the falls, while the Crescenti Cutthroat Trout <b>spawns</b> <b>in</b> Barnes Creek.|$|R
50|$|Little {{is known}} about their {{reproductive}} habits, but they are thought to <b>spawn</b> <b>in</b> mid-summer and perhaps hybridize with both roundtail and humpback chubs. <b>Spawning</b> <b>in</b> Lake Mohave has been observed during May, while in the upper Green River, it occurs in the months of June and July. Eggs are laid randomly over the bottom, and no parental care occurs.|$|R
50|$|This fish is anadromous, {{living in}} marine systems and <b>spawning</b> <b>in</b> deep, swift {{freshwater}} rivers with hard substrates. It migrates to <b>spawning</b> grounds <b>in</b> the spring. In Connecticut, blueback shad <b>spawn</b> <b>in</b> 14 to 17 C water, usually {{later in the}} spring than the alewife. During spawning, many eggs are deposited over the stream bottom, where they stick to gravel, stones, logs, or other objects. Juveniles spend three to seven months in fresh water, then migrate to the ocean. The blueback shad is a planktivorous forage species.|$|R
