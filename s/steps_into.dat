On June 26, 1950, he was rewarded with his own 30-minute CBS early-evening talk-variety TV program, The Garry Moore Show, which was a shorter version of his radio show. Until September 1950, it was also simulcast on radio. During 1950 and 1951, he hosted prime-time variety hour summer replacements for Arthur Godfrey and his Friends.

5|$|The {{chemical}} reactions of metabolism are organized into metabolic pathways, {{in which one}} chemical is transformed {{through a series of}} <b>steps</b> <b>into</b> another chemical, by a sequence of enzymes. Enzymes are crucial to metabolism because they allow organisms to drive desirable reactions that require energy that will not occur by themselves, by coupling them to spontaneous reactions that release energy. Enzymes act as catalysts that allow the reactions to proceed more rapidly. Enzymes also allow the regulation of metabolic pathways in response to changes in the cell's environment or to signals from other cells.|$|E

Bowie had insisted on the cropped black-and-white image as he felt that in the original coloured full-size image the sky looked artificial; when Rykodisc reissued Bowie's catalogue in the early 1990s the colour version was used.

5|$|To {{the south}} of the church there are the {{remnants}} of a stone preaching cross. The cross was originally situated on Poulton's boundary and marked a resting place for mourners travelling long distances to bury corpses at St Chad's. Only the two circular <b>steps</b> <b>into</b> which the original structure was set remain; the cross shaft has been replaced by an octagonal pillar. The pillar was used as a sundial until the early 20th century when the gnomon was stolen. The steps function as a memorial for present-day mourners at St Chad's, in a small garden of remembrance. The churchyard is noted locally for its display of crocuses and other flowering bulbs in early springtime.|$|E

Trying to save Dr. Webber, she accidentally <b>steps</b> <b>into</b> a puddle and electrocutes herself while hitting her head as she falls. Bailey moves a cancer patient in Webber's room to force some perspective and make him take the treatment. Also introduced in the tenth season was Dr. Karev's estranged father Jimmy Evans (James Remar) who tries to form a relationship with his son but fails repeatedly and ultimately dies in a botched surgery. The conclusion of season 10 has Cristina leaving Grey Sloan for Dr. Burke's job overseas while Dr. Ross makes a last-minute decision to follow her in order to study under her. Dr. Maggie Pierce (Kelly McCreary) unknowingly drops a bombshell that she is the adopted love child of Dr. Webber and the late Dr. Grey, which makes for yet another half sister of Dr. Meredith Grey. Also, Dr. Yang leaves her seat on the board to Dr. Karev while Dr. Webber all but promises the seat to Dr. Bailey. Introduced in season eleven is Dr. Nicole Herman (Geena Davis), who is Chief of Fetal Surgery at Grey Sloan Memorial.

5|$|Wetherall {{was one of}} four senior {{players to}} act as Bradford City manager for two weeks during November 2003, {{following}} the sacking of Nicky Law. He, as well as Peter Atherton, Wayne Jacobs and Dean Windass oversaw training but just one game when Bradford City lost 1–0 to Stoke City with Jacobs taking charge from the touchline. Wetherall took his first full <b>steps</b> <b>into</b> management on a caretaker basis when he was appointed player-manager at Bradford City following the sacking of Colin Todd on 12 February 2007. The side were on a poor run of form but Wetherall, whose role was extended in March, could not reverse the fortunes and the side were relegated to League Two. During Wetherall's short stint in charge the club won just two games and drew another four. During his spell in charge of Bradford, Wetherall appointed his former Leeds teammate Nigel Martyn as goalkeeping coach, a position he kept under McCall. Wetherall returned to concentrate on his playing career after Stuart McCall was named full-time manager during the summer of 2007.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they all}} share the forest, {{relationships}} between different Clans are tense. They often come {{into conflict with}} one another, becoming aggressive if a cat from a neighboring Clan accidentally crosses a border. This rivalry can increase in times of deprivation, such as if one Clan is suffering from a shortage of prey but another is thriving. An attempt for one Clan to steal all of or part of another Clan's territory is not unusual. To prepare for this, cats in all Clans are taught battle moves {{in order to protect}} their territory. Each Clan has signature battle moves that are taught to them from an early age (6 months/moons old). Border fights are the most common source of battle (a cat intentionally or unwittingly <b>steps</b> <b>into</b> another Clan's territory), and are often short-lived and cause no real damage to either side. However, bigger and more brutal battles can occur; at this point, casualties are to be expected. Despite this rivalry, the Clans can also show concern for another's well being; the idea of one Clan being destroyed causes deep distress, and will prompt urgent action on behalf of all four Clans. On the night of every full moon, the Clans will meet at a designated spot in order to share stories and news in peace. This is known as a 'Gathering', and is the only time in which fighting is prohibited.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) {{has started}} {{spending}} more time with Cathy Simms (Lindsey Broad) because Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker) keeps trying to rope Jim into having an affair. During the night at the hotel, Cathy asks to hang out for a while in Jim's room under the pretext that the heat in her room is malfunctioning. She repeatedly makes seductive signals, making Jim uncomfortable, so he calls Dwight saying he has bed bugs. Dwight arrives and forces Cathy off Jim's bed so he can lure out the bed bugs with his nearly naked body. This fails to sufficiently disgust Cathy, who merely <b>steps</b> <b>into</b> the bathroom to take a shower until Dwight leaves. Cathy gets out of the shower wearing only a bath robe. After ordering some desserts from room service and asking Jim to touch her legs, he finally comes out saying that he is happily married, and {{does not want to be}} with her. Cathy gets defensive and insists that she did not have any romantic intentions whatsoever, so Jim relents, but Cathy immediately resumes her seductive technique. After Jim goes to the bathroom, he comes out to find her in only her underwear under his blanket. Fed up, he demands that she leave and lets Dwight, armed with spray chemicals, into the room. Jim claims to see a bed bug near Cathy, making her flee from Dwight's spraying. However, because of the chemicals, Dwight suggests Jim sleep in Cathy's room. Jim instead spends the night with Dwight in his room, eating Cathy's desserts and watching TV, while a drunken Nellie is outside, trying unsuccessfully to get in.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Tony follows Chastity into a cave in {{the woods}} and stumbles upon a bizarre shaft of light. Once Tony <b>steps</b> <b>into</b> the light, he is possessed with the same {{abilities}} that Max and Chastity have, the ability to vibrate at high frequencies, allowing Tony to move faster than normal vision can detect. At the same time, however, Max collapses and is sent to the hospital where it is found he is suffering from exhaustion, withdrawal, a concussion, muscular tears and skeletal fractures - basically, his abilities are killing him. Mulder eventually deduces that he possesses superhuman speed. Chastity sneaks Max out of the hospital where he returns to the cave (even though she suggested they go somewhere else for help but Max refused). Later, the sheriff finds the flashlight in Max's room and confronts his son about the murders. Max confesses and then attempts to kill his father, but Tony intervenes, taking the sheriff's gun; the sheriff is promptly taken to the hospital. That night, Tony and Chastity head to the cave so that Max won't use up any more of the remaining power. Once there, Chastity has been knocked unconscious by Max, who then confronts Tony, using his abilities to take back the gun before throwing it away. However, Chastity (having come to and using her abilities) takes the gun and shoots Max from behind, then allows herself to be shot by the same bullet; she tells Tony that she can't go back to the way things were before. Afterwards, Tony is seen in the hospital recuperating while numerous geological experts examined the cave, but were unable to identify anything unusual. The city then fills the cave with concrete, sealing it forever, leaving the question as to what caused the teenager-related ability a mystery.|$|E
