500|$|While {{arranging}} {{dates for}} the band's world tour, Epstein {{agreed to a}} proposal by journalist Maureen Cleave for the Beatles to be interviewed separately {{for a series of}} articles that would run in London's Evening <b>Standard</b> <b>newspaper</b> in March 1966. Cleave's observations reflected the band members' more sophisticated personalities beyond the simplistic portrayals that were commonplace at the time. Of the two principal songwriters, she found Lennon to be intuitive, lazy and dissatisfied with fame and his surroundings in the Surrey countryside, while McCartney conveyed confidence and a hunger for knowledge and new creative possibilities. In his book Revolver: How the Beatles Reimagined Rock 'n' Roll, Robert Rodriguez writes that, whereas Lennon had been the Beatles' dominant creative force before Revolver, McCartney now attained an approximately equal position with him. In a further development, Harrison's interest in the music and culture of India, and his study of the Indian sitar, had inspired him as a composer. According to author Ian Inglis, Revolver is widely viewed as [...] "the album on which Harrison came of age as a songwriter".|$|E
