5|$|Most of {{the diverse}} bovid species occur in Africa. The maximum {{concentration}} is in the savannas of eastern Africa. Depending on their feeding habits, several species have radiated over large stretches of land, and hence several variations in dental and limb morphology are observed. Duikers inhabit the equatorial rainforests, <b>sitatunga,</b> and lechwe occur near swamps, eland inhabit grasslands, springbok and oryx occur in deserts, bongo and anoa live in dense forests, and mountain goats and takin live at high altitudes. A few bovid species also occur in Europe, Asia, and North America. Sheep and goats are found primarily in Eurasia, though the Barbary sheep and the ibex form part of the African fauna. The muskox is confined to the arctic tundra. Several bovid species have been domesticated by human beings. The domestication of goats and sheep began 10 thousand years ago, while cattle were domesticated about 7.5 thousand years ago.|$|E
25|$|Other paddocks on {{the west}} side of the zoo support grazing herds of Grévy's zebras, <b>sitatunga,</b> Kirk's dik-diks, eastern bongo, and roan antelope.|$|E
25|$|Papyrus swamps are {{considered}} the crown jewels of Kasanka with vast marshes supporting large tracts of thick papyrus swamp and home to the elusive <b>sitatunga.</b>|$|E
25|$|Other animals {{found in}} the park include dwarf crocodiles, red river hog, <b>sitatunga,</b> warthog, civet cat, Maxwell's duiker, grass cutter, mona monkey, Thomas's galago and tree pangolin.|$|E
25|$|The {{national}} parks {{are also part of}} the wetlands of Tanzania. The wild animals tend to be closer to the wetlands, particularly the water loving species such as the hippopotamus, waterbuck, common warthog, elephant, crocodile, <b>sitatunga</b> as well as water birds such as flamingoes and ducks.|$|E
25|$|Many mammal species live in {{the region}} of Lake Victoria, and some of these are closely {{associated}} with the lake itself and the nearby wetlands. Among these are the hippopotamus, African clawless otter, spotted-necked otter, marsh mongoose, <b>sitatunga,</b> bohor reedbuck, defassa waterbuck, cane rats, and giant otter shrew.|$|E
25|$|Mammal species {{abound in}} this remote and not easily {{accessible}} park and consist of indigenous species of hippos, vervet monkeys, genets and mongooses, which coexist with introduced species of chimpanzee, black-and-white colobus, elephant and giraffe, bushbucks, shaggy-coated aquatic <b>sitatunga.</b> Fish eagles are seen near {{the bay and}} so also crocodiles.|$|E
25|$|The western lowland gorilla, chimpanzee, black colobus, {{mandrill}} {{and golden}} potto {{have all been}} listed on the IUCN Red List. The riparian areas of the Minkébé forest provide for creatures who require a water habitat, including the dwarf crocodile, spotted-necked otter, crested mangabey, <b>sitatunga,</b> and water chevrotain. The swampy areas interspersed with vegetation also includes habitat for parrots and python. The park contains some animals which are rare in Gabon including the bongo and the giant forest hog.|$|E
25|$|A {{total of}} 114 mammal {{species have been}} {{recorded}} in the park including Elephant, Hippopotamus and <b>Sitatunga.</b> A number of species have been reintroduced in the park by Kasanka Trust - the most successful of which are Zebra and Buffalo. Close to ten million Eidolon helvum (African fruit bat) migrate to the Mushitu swamp evergreen forest in the park for three months during October to December, making it the largest mammal migration in the world. Over 471 bird species {{have been identified in}} the park.|$|E
25|$|All {{species are}} found in a {{majority}} of sub-Saharan Africa in various woodland habitats such as rainforests, swamps, open savannahs, mountains, and sub-deserts. With {{the exception of the}} eland and <b>sitatunga,</b> spiral-horned antelopes are all browswers. All species forage on green foliage as well as rely on them for cover. During the dry seasons their diet consists mostly foliage from bushes and trees, shoots, twigs and herbs. They also supplement fruit, flowers, and fresh grass when the rainy season arrives. In response to living in dense cover, spiral-horned antelopes are able to move through the thickett by bounding, rushing, and dodging through the vegetation. Most species are water dependent though kudus and elands do not rely on it as they live in more arid environments. Unlike most species of bovids, spiral-horned antelopes are primarily nocturnal though some species {{can be seen in the}} early morning and late afternoon. As with all species of antelope, spiral-horned antelopes (especially the young, the old and the weak) are susceptible to some of Africa's major predators, such as lions, leopards, cheetahs, spotted hyenas, and African wild dogs.|$|E
25|$|Douala Edéa Wildlife Reserve, a {{wildlife}} reserve in the Littoral Region of Cameroon, {{is located on}} either side of the mouth of the Sanaga River along the shores of the Bight of Biafra opposite the island of Bioko. The reserve was established in 1932. As of 2000, it covered 160,000 hectares (400,000 acres). Cameroon designated the reserve as {{a wildlife}} park for scientific purposes in 1971, Lake Tissongo, a lagoon connected to the south bank of the Sanaga river by a 5 kilometres (3.1mi) tidal channel, is included in the reserve. 80% of the reserve is covered by tropical lowland equatorial forest, and 15% by Atlantic mangrove forests. Fauna include forest elephants, primates (chimpanzees, monkey species such as black colobus), antelopes (<b>sitatunga,</b> blue duiker, etc.), West African manatees, sea turtles, dolphins, crocodiles, alligator, many fish species, terrestrial and water bird species. The red-capped mangabey was reported to be common in the reserve in 1972. The endangered red-eared nose-spotted guenon was reported in the Lombé part of the reserve in densities of 2-3 groups per square kilometers, but populations had dropped elsewhere due to hunting.|$|E

500|$|The {{blackbuck}} shows {{variation in}} its diploid chromosome number. Males have 31-33 while females have 30-32. Males have a XY1Y2 sex chromosome. Unusually large sex chromosomes had earlier been described {{only in a}} few species, all of which belonged to Rodentia. However, in 1968, a study found that two artiodactyls, the blackbuck and the <b>sitatunga,</b> too showed this abnormality. [...] Generally the X chromosome constitutes 5 percent of the haploid chromosomal complement; but the X chromosome of the blackbuck this percentage is 14.96. Portions of both peculiarly large chromosomes show delayed replication.|$|E

The hybridization of these species adds further support in the bongo and <b>sitatunga</b> being each other's closet relatives. Other hybrids have been documented, such as a male common eland x greater kudu resulting from an accidental crossing from the San Diego Zoo Safari Park in the 1970s. Notable mixed inherited traits were pointed ears as the eland's, but a bit widened like kudu's. The tail was half the length of that of an eland, with a terminal tuft of hair as in kudu. The individual was, however, azoospermic as analysis showed that it completely lacked germ cells, which produce gametes.|$|E

Since they were closely related the previous female departed for a zoo in Spain shortly after, and the zoo are in the progress of creating a breeding situation– Baabu has now been exchanged for 'Beni' from Pilsen Zoo. The paddocks formerly housed barasingha, Ankole cattle, blackbuck and <b>sitatunga.</b>|$|E
2500|$|A {{total of}} 114 mammal {{species have been}} {{recorded}} in the park. Although severely depleted in the past, due to an ongoing anti-poaching presence, game populations in Kasanka have recovered. Puku are the most plentiful antelope and graze on the grassy floodplains and dambo’s throughout the Park. Common duiker, bushbuck, warthog, vervet monkey and Kinda baboon (related to the yellow baboon (Papio cynocephalus)) are common throughout the park and hippo can frequently be encountered in Kasanka’s rivers and lakes, including in Lake Wasa, opposite the main lodge. [...] Kasanka is perhaps {{the best place in}} the world to spot the shy and reclusive <b>sitatunga,</b> of which the park holds an estimated 500-1,000 animals, and offers great opportunities for sightings of the rare blue monkey.|$|E

50|$|Within Tragelaphus, the kéwel, bongo, <b>sitatunga</b> and nyala (T. angasii) are {{particularly}} close relatives. The bushbuck, that includes both imbabala (T. sylvaticus) and kéwel, and <b>sitatunga</b> are genetically similar enough to hybridise. Hybrids between bongo and <b>sitatunga</b> {{have proved to}} be fertile. The <b>sitatunga</b> is more variable in its general characters than any other member of the tribe Strepsicerotini, that consists of the genera Taurotragus (elands) and Tragelaphus, probably because of their confinement to swampy and marshy habitats.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Sitatunga</b> {{can feed}} or rest close to {{southern}} lechwe herds, {{but do not}} interact with them. They often attract yellow-billed oxpeckers, African jacanas and great egrets. <b>Sitatunga</b> are good swimmers, but limit themselves to water with profuse vegetation in order to escape crocodiles. In some cases, for instance when troubled by flies or pursued by predators, the <b>sitatunga</b> might fully submerge themselves in the water except for the nose and the eyes, which they keep slightly above the water surface. Due to its close association with water, the <b>sitatunga</b> are often described as [...] "aquatic antelopes", like the waterbuck. They often dry themselves under the sun after feeding in water. Predators of the <b>sitatunga</b> include lions, wild dogs, crocodiles and leopards.|$|E
50|$|Habitat loss is {{the most}} severe threat to the {{survival}} of the <b>sitatunga.</b> Other threats include the increasing loss of wetlands, that has isolated populations; and long-term changes in the water level, that affects the nearby vegetation and thus bears upon their diet. Vast areas of Bangweulu and Busanga are burnt every year, placing animals like the <b>sitatunga</b> at grave risk given the inflammability of swamps. The <b>sitatunga</b> has been classified under the Least Concern category by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), and under Appendix III (Ghana) of the Washington Convention (CITES).|$|E
