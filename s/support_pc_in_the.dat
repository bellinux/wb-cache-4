40|$|Business {{transactions}} (a. k. a., business conversations) are {{series of}} message exchanges that occur between software applications coordinating {{to achieve a}} business objective. Web service has been {{proven to be a}} promising technology in supporting business transactions. Business transaction can either be long-running or short-lived. A transaction whether in a database or web service paradigm consists of an “all-or-nothing” property. A transaction could either succeed or fail. Web Service Atomic Transactions (WS-AT) is a specification that currently supports Two-Phase Commit (2 <b>PC)</b> protocol <b>in</b> a short-lived transaction. WS-AT is developed by OASIS–a standards development organization. However, not all business process scenarios require a 2 <b>PC,</b> <b>in</b> that case, just a One-Phase Commit (1 PC) would be sufficient. But unfortunately, WS-AT currently does not <b>support</b> 1 <b>PC</b> optimization. The ideal scenario where 1 PC can be used instead of 2 PC is when there is only a single participant. Short-lived transactions involving only one participant can commit without requiring initial “prepare” phase. Thus, there is no overhead to check whether the participant is prepared to either commit or rollback. This research focuses on designing a mechanism that can add 1 <b>PC</b> <b>support</b> <b>in</b> WS-AT. <b>The</b> technical implementation of this mechanism is developed by using JBoss Transaction API. As a part of this thesis, 1 PC mechanism for a single participant scenario was implemented. This mechanism optimizes the web service transaction process in terms of overhead and performance in terms of execution time. The technical implementation solution for 1 PC mechanism was evaluated using three different business process scenarios in a controlled experiment as a presence or absence test. Evaluation results show that 1 PC mechanism has a lower mean for execution time and performed significantly better than 2 PC mechanism. Based on the contributions made by this thesis, we recommend OASIS to consider including 1 PC mechanism {{as a part of the}} WS-AT specification...|$|R

40|$|Of the {{thousands}} of dividing progenitor cells (<b>PCs)</b> generated daily <b>in</b> <b>the</b> adult brain {{only a very small}} proportion survive to become mature neurons through the process of neurogenesis. Identification of the mechanisms that regulate cell death associated with neurogenesis would aid <b>in</b> harnessing <b>the</b> potential therapeutic value of PCs. Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is suggested to regulate death of <b>PCs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> adult brain as overexpression of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl- 2), an anti-apoptotic protein, enhances the survival of new neurons. To directly assess if Bcl- 2 is a regulator of apoptosis <b>in</b> <b>PCs,</b> this study examined the outcome of removal of Bcl- 2 from <b>the</b> developing <b>PCs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> adult mouse brain. Retroviral mediated gene transfer of Cre into adult floxed Bcl- 2 mice eliminated Bcl- 2 from developing <b>PCs</b> and resulted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> complete absence of new neurons at 30 days post viral injection. Similarly, Bcl- 2 removal through the use of nestin-induced conditional knockout mice resulted in reduced number of mature neurons. The function of Bcl- 2 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>PCs</b> was also dependent on Bcl- 2 -associated X (BAX) protein, as demonstrated by an increase in new neurons formed following viral-mediated removal of Bcl- 2 in BAX knockout mice.
