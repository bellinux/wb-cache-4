Major Harry Gem and Augurio Perera {{demonstrated}} their game of Pelota (Spanish for ball) and in 1872 created the world's first lawn tennis club at Leamington Spa. In February 1874 Major Clopton Wingfield introduced {{his version of}} lawn tennis, called Sphairistikè; on his patent application, he {{described it as a}} [...] "New and Improved Court for Playing the Ancient Game of Tennis", and its rules were published in an eight-page booklet. Wingfield is widely credited with popularising the new game through his energetic promotional efforts. The Sphairistikè court was hourglass-shaped, wider at the baseline than at the net. The service was made from a single side in a lozenge <b>shaped</b> <b>box</b> situated {{in the middle of the}} court and it had to bounce beyond the service line. In November 1874 Wingfield published a second, expanded edition of The Book of the Game, which had 12 rules and featured a larger court and a slightly lower net.|$|E

The legs were also more angular in support compared to the mostly vertical legs used by other manufacturers.

40|$|The {{governing}} {{differential equations}} of equilibrium for flexural-torsional-distortional analysis of thin-walled box girder structures with various shapes were derived {{in this work}} using V. Z. Vlasov’s theory. The obtained equations were {{used to evaluate the}} cross sectional deformations of some box girder structures having rectangular (doubly symmetric) and trapezoidal (mono symmetric) shapes. Evaluation of Vlasov’s coefficients for the obtained differential equations of equilibrium formed a major part of this work. This was accomplished by examining the strain modes interaction diagrams for the various cross sections and by using Morh’s integral chart for displacement computations. Cross sectional deformations of the box girder structures were obtained by integration of the differential equations of equilibrium using method of trigonometric series with accelerated convergence. For irregular (asymmetric) box girder shapes, complex differential equations of equilibrium were obtained {{as a result of the}} interaction between all the strain modes of flexure, torsion and distortion. Application of these set of equations for the analysis of irregular <b>shaped</b> <b>box</b> girder structures is presented in another work...|$|E
