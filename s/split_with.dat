40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} the tree/stack <b>splitting</b> <b>with</b> {{remainder}} algorithm for distributed {{medium access control}} in a wireless network with multipacket reception. In {{order to reduce the}} length of a cycle and increase the network throughput, when the <b>splitting</b> <b>with</b> remainder algorithm is used, some nodes that attempt to transmit packets {{at the beginning of a}} cycle might have to postpone their packet retransmissions until the beginning of the next cycle. We demonstrate that the <b>splitting</b> <b>with</b> remainder algorithm outperforms the erasure algorithm and the probe algorithm. For the <b>splitting</b> <b>with</b> remainder algorithm, we analytically and accurately derive the network throughput and the average packet delay. We show that our analytical results are consistent with packet-based simulation results.

5|$|Clements had {{supported}} Bert T. Combs for governor against Chandler in 1955, {{and did so}} again against Harry Lee Waterfield in 1959. Combs defeated Waterfield and rewarded Clements by appointing him state highway commissioner. In 1961, Clements and Combs split over a proposed deal to lease dump trucks from a Louisville car dealer. State newspapers charged that the deal was payback to the dealer, a Combs supporter. When Combs canceled the deal Clements {{took it as a}} public rebuke and soon after resigned to work on the presidential campaign of his friend, Lyndon Johnson. Following his <b>split</b> <b>with</b> Combs, Clements allied himself with the Chandler faction, opposing Combs' lieutenant governor, Wilson Wyatt in his bid to unseat Senator Thruston Morton. Clements' influence declined rapidly after the <b>split</b> <b>with</b> Combs, and by the 1963 gubernatorial race, he was unable to deliver his home county for Chandler in the primary against Edward T. Breathitt. Clements died in his hometown of Morganfield, Kentucky on March 12, 1985.|$|E

5|$|Like {{other state}} {{highways}} in Michigan, I-196 is {{maintained by the}} Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT). In 2011, the department's traffic surveys showed that on average, 77,500vehicles used the highway daily between Lane Avenue and US131 in Grand Rapids and 12,778vehicles did so each day north of the <b>split</b> <b>with</b> US31 near Holland. These are the highest and lowest counts along the highway, respectively. As an Interstate Highway, all of I-196 is listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. In addition, the highway has been named by the Michigan Legislature the Gerald R. Ford Freeway to honor the 38th President of the United States. The original legislation from 1974 extended that name to {{the full length of}} the freeway, but when the various memorial highway names were re-codified in 2001, the name was not applied to the Berrien County segment.
