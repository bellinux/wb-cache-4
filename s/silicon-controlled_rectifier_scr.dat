50|$|Since 1961, an {{alternative}} method, using thyristors, {{has been in}} use. Both <b>silicon-controlled</b> <b>rectifiers</b> (<b>SCR)</b> and TRIACs {{are members of the}} thyristor family. The term thyristor includes all the semiconductor devices, which show inherent ON-OFF behavior, as opposed to allowing gradual changes in conduction. All thyristors are regenerative switching devices, and they cannot operate in linear manner. Thus, a transistor is not a thyristor even though it can operate like a switch (ON-OFF). The transistor is not inherently an ON-OFF device, and it is possible for a transistor to operate linearly.|$|R

5000|$|Quadracs are {{a special}} type of {{thyristor}} which combines a [...] "diac" [...] and a [...] "triac" [...] {{in a single}} package. The diac is the triggering device for the triac. Thyristors are four-layer (PNPN) semiconductor devices that act as switches, rectifiers or voltage regulators {{in a variety of}} applications. When triggered, thyristors turn on and become low-resistance current paths. They remain so even after the trigger is removed, and until the current is reduced to a certain level (or until they are triggered off). Diacs are bi-directional diodes that switch AC voltages and trigger triacs or <b>silicon-controlled</b> <b>rectifiers</b> (<b>SCRs).</b> Except for a small leakage current, diacs do not conduct until the breakover voltage is reached. Triacs are three-terminal, silicon devices that function as two SCRs configured in an inverse, parallel arrangement. They provide load current during both halves of the AC supply voltage. By combining the functions of diacs and triacs, quadracs eliminate the need to buy and assemble discrete parts.|$|R
40|$|Adverse {{effects of}} starting-torque {{transients}} and high in-rush currents in induction motors are typically mitigated by employing electronically controlled soft starting voltages through <b>silicon-controlled</b> <b>rectifiers</b> (<b>SCRs).</b> However, the heat dissipation {{in the soft}} starter must be carefully managed {{in the design of}} motor drives. The objective of this study is both to address the heat dissipation in the soft starter by implementing analytical solutions to the heat diffusion equations inside the soft starter, and to investigate the use of a phase change material (PCM) based heat sink for thermal management of the device. The analytical modeling approach is, however, general, and {{can be applied to the}} solution of a range of thermal problems in power electronics. The transient analytical thermal model, based on the thermal quadrupole approach, allows a determination of the transient performance of a soft starter by evaluating the thyristor junction temperature. Predictions from the model are first compared to results obtained using a coupled thermal and electricalmodel based on a resistance/capacitance network approach. Experimental results obtained with the soft starter connected to a low-voltage 200 hp induction machine are then used to validate the model. Additionally, the performance improvement resulting from the use of a hybrid heat sink (plate fin heat sink immersed in a PCM) is evaluated and compared to a conventional air-cooled heat sink without a PCM under identical conditions...|$|R

50|$|An {{opto-isolator}} {{contains a}} source (emitter) of light, almost always a near {{infrared light-emitting diode}} (LED), that converts electrical input signal into light, a closed optical channel (also called dielectrical channel), and a photosensor, which detects incoming light and either generates electric energy directly, or modulates electric current flowing from an external power supply. The sensor can be a photoresistor, a photodiode, a phototransistor, a <b>silicon-controlled</b> <b>rectifier</b> (<b>SCR)</b> or a triac. Because LEDs can sense light in addition to emitting it, construction of symmetrical, bidirectional opto-isolators is possible. An optocoupled solid state relay contains a photodiode opto-isolator which drives a power switch, usually a complementary pair of MOSFETs. A slotted optical switch contains a source of light and a sensor, but its optical channel is open, allowing modulation of light by external objects obstructing the path of light or reflecting light into the sensor.|$|E

[...] The motors are supplied by traction converters with integrated gate-commutated thyristor (IGCT) rather than <b>silicon-controlled</b> <b>rectifier</b> (<b>SCR)</b> components as in the KTX-I. [...] IGCT was the most advanced version of the Gate turn-off thyristor (GTO) used for control of high-power applications at the time, {{and the use of}} ABB-supplied IGCTs as the switching element in the rectifier and inverter modules of HSR-350x converters was a world's first in rail vehicles. [...] However, testing found limited improvements in efficiency and noise levels, and problems with reliability. [...] Each traction converter consists of two parallel-switched four-quadrant converters, which function as rectifier modules by converting single-phase alternating current (AC) from one main transformer winding each to direct current (DC), a 2,800 V DC intermediate circuit, one inverter module converting the DC supply to the three-phase AC supply for traction motors, an auxiliary inverter for the supply of motor and converter cooling fans, and resistors for rheostatic braking that are also connected to the DC circuit. [...] The variable voltage variable frequency (VVVF) inverters are voltage-sourced with pulse-width modulation (PWM) control, rather than current-sourced with phase fired control (PFC) as in the KTX-I. [...] Each converter supplies the motors on two axles of a bogie, providing for individual bogie control. [...] New main transformers with a 15% weight reduction and a 20% power increase were also developed. [...] The single-arm pantograph is a new development for the planned higher speed.

40|$|Abstract—The {{pin-to-pin}} {{electrostatic discharge}} (ESD) issue for a differential low-noise amplifier (LNA) was studied in this work. A new design of ESD protection diodes with an embedded <b>silicon-controlled</b> <b>rectifier</b> (<b>SCR)</b> was proposed {{to protect the}} giga-hertz differential LNA. The proposed ESD protection design was modified from the conventional ESD protection design without adding any extra device.

In this paper, an SCR device assisted with an inductor is proposed to improve the turn-on efficiency for ESD protection.

Experimental results of the ESD protection design with inductor-triggered SCR in a nanoscale CMOS process have been successfully verified at 60 -GHz frequency. The ESD protection de-sign with inductor-triggered SCR has been implemented in cell configuration with compact size, which can be directly used in the RF receiver circuits.
