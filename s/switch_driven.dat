The ALE-39 can fire flares in a synchronized pattern, very rapidly {{and with great}} reliability. The intervalometer used in the ALE-39 is essentially a solenoid-actuated rotary <b>switch</b> <b>driven</b> by a separate programmer which gives timing intervals and channel enabling to either {{of one or two}} channels. Intervalometers that contain internal interval clocks include the Lau-68, Suu-13 and similar electromechanically sequenced switches.

50|$|In time, the {{trembler}} coil {{system was}} seen as obsolete and was replaced, first by the ignition magneto and later by Kettering's battery ignition system, using battery, coil and contact breaker. These systems used a single ignition coil for the engine, supplying the spark to each cylinder in turn. A device called the distributor (previously used with magnetos) was used to switch the high-voltage current to each plug in turn. The high voltage distributor evolved from the timer and it too was a rotary <b>switch</b> <b>driven</b> at camshaft speed. The first high voltage distributors likewise used a wiping-contact, but as the current was at such a high voltage, these gave trouble with arcing and erosion of the contacts leading to a poor connection. It was realised that a jump-spark distributor would work equally well at high voltages and would be less susceptible to problems from erosion.|$|E
5000|$|Because {{eukaryotic}} cell cycle involves {{a variety of}} proteins and regulatory interactions, dynamical systems approach {{can be taken to}} simplify a complex biological circuit into a general framework for better analysis. Among the four possible input/output relationships, the relationship between Sic1 level and mitotic exit seems to show the characteristics of an irreversible bistable <b>switch,</b> <b>driven</b> by feedback between APC-Cdh1, Sic1, and Clb2-Cdk1. [...] Bistability is known to control biological functions such as cell cycle control and cellular differentiation and {{play a key role in}} many cellular regulatory networks. Bistable input/output relationship is characterized by two stable states with two bifurcation points. Multiple outputs are possible for one specific input in the region of bistability, marked by two bifurcation points. In addition, the bistable relationship displays hysteresis: the final state/output depends on the history of the input as well as the current value of input because the system has a memory. One bifurcation point has a negative control parameter value (the bifurcation point is on the other side of the axis), resulting in disconnection between the two stable states and irreversibility of the transition from one state to the other. With regard to mitotic exit, the two stable states are defined by mitosis and G1 phase. Once Sic1 level (input) accumulates beyond the threshold, irreversible transition occurs from mitosis (stable state I) to G1 phase (stable state II). In the imperfect environment, the only bifurcation that remains intact is saddle-node bifurcation. Saddle-node bifurcation does not break down (saddle-node is the expected generic behavior), while transcritical and pitchfork bifurcations break down in the presence of imperfections. Thus, the only one-dimensional bifurcation that can exist in imperfect biological world is the saddle-node bifurcation. The bistable relation between M-G1 transition and Sic1 level can be represented as a diagram of two saddle-node bifurcations in which the system’s behavior changes qualitatively with a small change in control parameter, the amount of Sic1.|$|E

40|$|SummaryIn {{cerebral}} cortex {{there is a}} developmental switch from NR 2 B- to NR 2 A-containing NMDA receptors (NMDARs) driven by activity and sensory experience. This subunit switch alters NMDAR function, influences synaptic plasticity, and its dysregulation is associated with neurological disorders. However, the mechanisms driving the subunit switch are not known. Here, we show in hippocampal CA 1 pyramidal neurons that the NR 2 B to NR 2 A <b>switch</b> <b>driven</b> acutely by activity requires activation of NMDARs and mGluR 5, involves PLC, Ca 2 + release from IP 3 R-dependent stores, and PKC activity. In mGluR 5 knockout mice the developmental NR 2 B-NR 2 A switch in CA 1 is deficient. Moreover, in visual cortex of mGluR 5 knockout mice, the NR 2 B-NR 2 A switch evoked in vivo by visual experience is absent. Thus, we establish that mGluR 5 and NMDARs are required for the activity-dependent NR 2 B-NR 2 A switch and {{play a critical role}} in experience-dependent regulation of NMDAR subunit composition in vivo...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a solution for}} battery-less power management circuits for micro-power energy converters, allowing energy harvesting systems to operate under continuous and intermittent conditions. The proposed trigger circuit is a fully passive, normally open, single pole, single throw, analog <b>switch</b> <b>driven</b> by a nano-power CMOS control unit. The trigger circuit starts in an OPEN state until the voltage, at its input terminal, reaches a high threshold, when it toggles to the CLOSED state. Once the input voltage drops below a low threshold, the trigger circuit returns to the OPEN state. In the CLOSED state, the trigger circuit creates a low resistance path between the input and output terminals, while at the OPEN state the input is isolated from the output. A first prototype was breadboarded by using discrete components {{for the sake of}} performance evaluation. Low threshold voltages (2. 15 V and 1. 15 V), sub-ohm CLOSED-state resistance, and power consumption requirements (in the order of 55. 9 and 167. 7 nW), coupled with relatively high energy extraction capabilities are confirmed by experimental results.

The mains current in an ac/dc converter contains periodic current pulses due to the action of rectifier and output filter capacitor. The high current peaks cause harmonic distortion of the supply current and low power factor. This results in a poor power quality, voltage distortion, poor power factor at input ac mains, slowly varying rippled dc output at load end and low efficiency. Many input wave shaping methods have been proposed {{to solve the problem of}} poor power factor which can be classified as active and passive methods. The main focus of this study is to review various existing wave shaping methods in terms of their efficiency, total harmonic distortion and power factor. Among the passive wave shaping techniques, the improved passive current wave shaping method and the novel method are analyzed and are simulated in ORCAD software.

Further the same circuit is Hardware implemented and tested using NI ELVIS Suite.

This unregulated voltage is chopped using a MOSFET <b>switch,</b> <b>driven</b> by PWM feedback signal, to control the output voltage level. An Isolation Transformer is used to isolate the DC output from input supply. The transformer output is again rectified by the high frequency Diode bridge rectifier and is filtered using a capacitor to give the regulated DC output. A Voltage regulator is connected to give the precise voltage output. The feedback network generates a high frequency PWM signal to drive the MOSFET switch. The dc voltage at the output depends on the width of the switching pulse. The pulse width is varied with the changes in the DC output voltage level, this change in the pulse width cancels the output voltage change and the SMPS output remains constant irrespective of load variations. ...|$|E

The study of host-guest complexes and mechanical interlocked molecules, important examples in this field, is necessary in order to characterize self-assembly processes, achieve more control over the molecular organization and develop sophisticated structures by using properly designed building blocks.

In Chapter 1 a brief overview of the principal concepts of supramolecular chemistry, the spin labelling approach and the development of ESR methods applied to paramagnetic systems are described.
