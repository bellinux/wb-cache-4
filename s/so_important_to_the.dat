5|$|As the Merlin was {{considered}} to be <b>so</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> war effort, negotiations were soon started to establish an alternative production line outside the UK. Rolls-Royce staff visited a number of North American automobile manufacturers in order to select one to build the Merlin in the U.S. or Canada. Henry Ford rescinded an initial offer to build the engine in the U.S. in July 1940, and the Packard Motor Car Company was subsequently selected to take on the $130,000,000 Merlin order. Agreement was reached in September 1940, and the first Packard-built engine, a Merlin XX designated the V-1650-1, ran in August 1941.|$|E

25|$|Although Pullen {{was able}} {{to play the piano}} in almost any style, the {{attribute}} that had made his contributions <b>so</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wide-ranging music of Mingus was his ability to place extremely precise singing runs or glissandi over heavy chords, reminiscent of traditional blues, while never losing contact with the melodic line. His technique for creating these runs, where he seemed to roll his right hand over and over along the keys, received much comment from critics, was studied by pianists, and heavily filmed and investigated, but could never be totally explained, even by Pullen, who had developed it. His piano technique can be seen on the DVDs Mingus At Montreux 1975 and Roots Salutes The Saxophones.|$|E

25|$|While {{the art of}} wine making {{reached the}} Hellenic {{peninsula}} by about 2000 BC, the first alcoholic beverage to obtain widespread popularity {{in what is now}} Greece was mead, a fermented beverage made from honey and water. However, by 1700 BC, wine making was commonplace. During the next thousand years wine drinking assumed the same function so commonly found around the world: It was incorporated into religious rituals. It became important in hospitality, used for medicinal purposes, and became an integral part of daily meals. As a beverage, it was drunk in many ways: warm and chilled, pure and mixed with water, plain and spiced. Alcohol, specifically wine, was considered <b>so</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Greeks that consumption was considered a defining characteristic of the Hellenic culture between their society {{and the rest of the}} world; those who did not drink were considered barbarians.|$|E
25|$|Cod {{has been}} an {{important}} economic commodity in international markets since the Viking period (around 800 AD). Norwegians traveled with dried cod and soon a dried cod market developed in southern Europe. This market has lasted for more than 1,000 years, enduring the Black Death, wars and other crises, and is still an important Norwegian fish trade. The Portuguese began fishing cod in the 15th century. Clipfish is widely enjoyed in Portugal. The Basques {{played an important role in}} the cod trade, and allegedly found the Canadian fishing banks before Columbus' discovery of America. The North American east coast developed in part due to the vast cod stocks. Many cities in the New England area are located near cod fishing grounds. The fish was <b>so</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> history and development of Massachusetts, the state's House of Representatives hung a wood carving of a codfish, known as the Sacred Cod of Massachusetts, in its chambers.|$|E

[...] Mast displacements could significantly alter cable length and tension and redistribute loads through the superstructure contrary to design. [...] The key to successful design was control of the foundation settlement. [...] The sites natural underlying subsurface conditions were stiff silty clay below a medium dense sand layer, which {{was determined to be}} too accommodating to settlement to host the structure. [...] Ground improvement, consisting of triple-fluid jet grouting, was performed to reduce the compressibility of the silty clay, stiffen the sand deposit and provide a desirable shallow foundation system. [...] This site marked the first time that these geotechnical ground improvement techniques were employed.|$|E

His most popular pamphlet, entitled Coin's Financial School, was published in 1893. Sales were buoyed by Harvey's involvement in the 1896 presidential campaign of William Jennings Bryan, and it sold two million copies. Though Bryan lost his bid for President, Harvey had become <b>so</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> campaign that he was made chairman of the Democratic Ways & Means Committee to collect money for the 1900 campaign.
