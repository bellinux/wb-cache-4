40|$|Environment and {{sustainability}} are key {{issues for the}} policy maker. A policy should be first designed and realistically inserted in his proper context (regional, national, european) {{in order to be}} correctly assessed. After that, suitable models need to be choose consistently with the policy context and with the evaluation purpose, to make easier the policy maker task. The aim of this paper is twofold. Firstly to propose a <b>Statistical</b> <b>Information</b> <b>System</b> (SIS) approach in order to correctly write the policy and verify its internal and external consistency, secondly to conceive model building with an evaluation purpose and not only with an analytical one. It means that the model could be able to produce indicators useful to monitoring the policy other then macro indicators whose function is to verify its long term sustainability. We apply these concepts to a specific regional environmental policy - the premium/penalty system conceived to implement the separate collection in waste management. The SIS approach allows us to verify the quality of disposable information, to complete and eventually integrate them with ad hoc surveys, in order to build the environmental extended Social Accounting Matrix, the ESAM.

To take up this challenge, modules on "Governance, Democracy and Multiple Dimensions of Poverty" have been appended to household surveys by National Statistics Institutes in twelve African and Latin American developing countries. This paper presents the issues addressed and the methodological lessons learnt along with a selection of findings to illustrate this innovative approach and demonstrate its analytic potential. We investigate, for instance, the population's support for democratic principles, the respect for civil and political rights and the trust in the political class; the 'need for the State', particularly of the poorest; the extent of petty corruption; the reliability of expert surveys on governance; the perception of decentralization policies at local level; the level and vitality of social and political participation, etc. The conclusive appraisal made opens up prospects for the national <b>statistical</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> in the developing countries.
