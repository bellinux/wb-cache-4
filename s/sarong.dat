5|$|Batik is {{traditionally}} sold in 2.25-metre lengths used for kain panjang or <b>sarong.</b> It is worn by wrapping {{it around the}} hip, or made into a hat known as blangkon. The cloth can be filled continuously with a single pattern or divided into several sections.|$|E
5|$|The head is a {{rectangular}} {{section of the}} cloth which is worn at the front. The head section can be at {{the middle of the}} cloth, or placed at one or both ends. The papan inside of the head can be used to determine whether the cloth is kain panjang or <b>sarong.</b>|$|E
5|$|Local {{residents}} have {{developed their own}} style in clothing and jewellery, using local products, such as shells. Giving somebody a shell necklace and placing it around the recipients neck is a goodwill and love gesture. They make a type of <b>sarong,</b> called a pareu, which is typically brightly coloured. Like the other islands of Melanesia such as Fiji and Samoa, the Cook Islanders {{are known for their}} hand-painted and silk-screened dress fabrics. An important practice among women is tivaevae, a type of quilting.|$|E
40|$|In Malaysia, batik <b>sarongs</b> were {{introduced}} from the Island of Java. The batik technique is a continuous tradition, which contributed new decorative techniques for fabric printing. <b>Sarongs</b> were adapted as common comfortable clothing and were {{suitable for the}} tropical climate. Malaysian batik makers began {{to make their own}} <b>sarongs</b> to meet the demand of the local market and over time developed their own expression of the art form. Malaysian batik was influenced by its location, history and cultural diversity. The position of batik in art and culture was interrelated to the issues of cultural development in the country. This research explores the preservation and maintenance of batik <b>sarongs</b> {{as an integral part of}} the textile cultural heritage. The specific focus of this study is on traditional batik <b>sarongs</b> produced in Malaysia with their design characteristics identified. The overview of related literature examined models of analysis of textiles &minus; such as kimonos, shawls, saris and Javanese batik <b>sarongs</b> &minus; to organize this research. These provided important interpretive tools for cataloguing the fabric designs. Documents and pictures of batik <b>sarongs</b> were selected from the earliest records made by Malaysian and foreign writers. A diverse range of samples of Malaysian traditional batik <b>sarongs</b> were viewed, photographed and catalogued. They were gathered from personal collections, museums, and galleries in Malaysia. In addition, samples of Malay batik <b>sarongs</b> were sourced from museums and galleries in Singapore, Jakarta and Melbourne. In this research, I was able to draw directly on my experience with Malay traditional batik <b>sarongs,</b> which I have worn every day and collected over the years. A digital camera and scanner were the primary tools used in documenting the batik motifs that came from drawings, slides, photographs or actual samples. The digital images were important in the process of tracing, which was aided by the use of Adobe Illustrator&copy; software. The drawings from the tracing were used to analyse the characteristics of design layout and motifs to show their complexity, influences and development. The photos and tracing method assisted in cataloguing batik archival data to be stored in cultural heritage organizations. These significant design influences have impacted on the clothing traditions and craft techniques in Malaysia. Moreover, the implementation of the national cultural policy identified key characteristics in Malaysian batik design, and promotes batik makers to adhere to design principles as a form of maintaining national heritage and to avoid disputes over cultural ownership. The research recommends ways to study Malaysian traditional batik <b>sarongs</b> and improve the conservation quality, while safeguarding the textile heritage...|$|R

25|$|Outside Western cultures, male {{clothing}} includes {{skirts and}} skirt-like garments. One common form {{is a single}} sheet of fabric folded and wrapped around the waist, such as the dhoti/veshti or lungi in India, and <b>sarong</b> in South and Southeast Asia, and Sri Lanka. In Myanmar {{both women and men}} wear a longyi, a wraparound tubular skirt like a <b>sarong</b> that reaches to the ankles for women and to mid-calf for men. There are different varieties and names of <b>sarong</b> depending on whether the ends are sewn together or simply tied. There is a difference in the way a dhoti and lungi is worn. While a lungi is more like a wrap around, wearing the dhoti involves the creation of pleats by folding it. A dhoti also passes between the legs making it more like a folded loose trouser rather than a skirt.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, Somali men {{typically}} {{wear the}} macawis. It is a <b>sarong</b> that is worn around the waist. On their heads, they often wrap a colorful turban or wear the koofiyad, {{which is an}} embroidered fez.|$|E
25|$|Traditional Buru {{houses were}} made from bamboo, often on stilts. The roofs were covered with palm leaves or reeds. Cement, metal and tiles were {{introduced}} in the 20th century and urged to build more permanent dwelling, but with limited results, as the locals continued to relocate. This was {{partly due to the}} habits of relocation and partly due to local disputes or superstitions, such as cursing a place where a certain number of people died within a short period. Presence of a church in a village might hindered relocation for a century, but not always. Traditional Buru costumes are similar those of most other Indonesia peoples. Men wear <b>sarong</b> (a kind of kilt) and a long-skirted tunic, and women are dressed in <b>sarong</b> and a shorter jacket. However, the dress color systematically varies between the different tribes of the island.|$|E

50|$|Unlike {{the brightly}} colored Southeast Asian <b>sarongs,</b> the Kerala variety (the mundu) {{is more often}} plain white and is worn for {{ceremonial}} or religious purposes. In Kerala, the brightly coloured <b>sarongs</b> are called kaily and the white ones are called mundu. The more formal, all-white dhoti is worn for formal and religious occasions. While there are dresses based on the mundu which can be worn by women, they more commonly wear the sari.|$|R
25|$|The fashion {{influences}} between colonials and natives was {{a reciprocal}} phenomenon. Just as the Europeans influences the natives, the natives too influenced the European colonials. For example, the thick European fabrics was considered {{too hot to}} wear in tropical climate. Thus, the light clothing of thin kebaya fabrics and the comfortable and easy to wear batik <b>sarong</b> are considered quite suitable for everyday clothing in hot and humid climate of the East Indies.|$|E
25|$|Tongan men wear a tupenu, a cloth that {{is similar}} to a <b>sarong,</b> which is wrapped around the waist. It should be long enough to cover the knees or the shins of the legs. In daily life, any shirt (T-shirt, jersey, woven shirt) will do to top the tupenu. Usually shirts are used {{clothing}} imported from overseas. Some men will go shirtless working on their plantations, but by law they are not allowed to go shirtless in public.|$|E
25|$|The actual {{determination}} of cross-dressing is largely socially constructed. For example, in Western society, trousers {{have long been}} adopted for usage by women, {{and it is no}} longer regarded as cross-dressing. In cultures where men have traditionally worn skirt-like garments such as the kilt or <b>sarong,</b> these are not seen as female clothing, and wearing them is not seen as cross-dressing for men. As societies are becoming more global in nature, both men's and women's clothing are adopting styles of dress associated with other cultures.|$|E

50|$|In North and South America {{as well as}} Europe, hip wraps {{are worn}} as beach wear or as a {{cover-up}} over swimwear. The wrap is often made of a thin, light fabric, often rayon, and may feature decorative fringing on both sides. They may have ties, which are long thin straps of fabric which the wearer can tie together to prevent the wrap from falling down. These wraps are mostly worn by women as beach cover ups and do not usually resemble traditional Asian or African <b>sarongs</b> in size, pattern or design. Western men who wear male <b>sarongs</b> {{are influenced by the}} Scottish kilt or lava-lava within the Polynesian or Samoan culture. Typically <b>sarongs</b> are worn by men when they are at home or at the beach or as a cover up on a nude beach or by the pool or on a cruise.|$|R

25|$|Tonga {{has evolved}} {{its own version}} of Western-style clothing, {{consisting}} of a long tupenu, or <b>sarong,</b> for women, and a short tupenu for men. Women cover the tupenu with a kofu, or Western-style dress; men top the tupenu either with a T-shirt, a Western casual shirt, or on formal occasions, a dress shirt and a suit coat. Preachers in some Methodist sects still wear long frock coats, a style that has not been current in the West for more than a hundred years. These coats must be tailored locally.|$|E
25|$|The {{culture of}} Christmas Island is unique, {{for people of}} many {{different}} ethnicities inhabit the area. The majority of residents are Chinese, but Europeans and Malays reside there as well with small Indian and Eurasian communities too. The main languages of Christmas Island are English and Chinese. Dress is usually modest, and tourists should keep a wrap, such as a <b>sarong</b> or pareo, on hand to cover shorts, bathing suits, and tank tops. It is common to remove shoes when entering a house and to also avoid touching anyone's head.|$|E
25|$|Dressed in {{a version}} of the <b>Sarong</b> Kebaya {{designed}} by Pierre Balmain in 1968, the uniform of the Singapore Girl has remained largely unchanged. Stewards previously wore light-blue business jackets and grey trousers. Since June 2008, this has been redesigned by Christophe Galibert, artistic Director of Balmain Uniformes. The new steward's uniform now features a single-breasted navy blue suit (jacket and trousers), a sky blue shirt and different coloured striped ties. The tie colours differentiates the four ranks of cabin crew: inflight supervisor, chief steward(ess), leading steward(ess), and steward(ess).|$|E

The Fijian sulu is a long bark cloth skirt for men as well as women. It is still worn as Fijian national dress, {{in one of the}} more obvious versions of invented traditions, though today the cloth will be cotton or other woven material. A Fijian aristocrat will even wear a pin-stripe sulu to accompany a dress and tie, as full court dress.|$|E
25|$|The Datuk Gong is {{presented}} in many forms; an idol bearing his likeness, a tablet with an inscription of his title, a rock, a songkok, a stack incense and flags are all used to denote {{the presence of the}} spirit. Shrines are usually decorated with items related to the Datuk and his position as a Malay guardian; a Malay <b>sarong,</b> songkok, keris, rattan cane, baju Melayu are among the items one can find placed right next to the idol.

25|$|While the sari {{is typical}} to South Asian {{traditional}} wear, clothing worn by South-East Asian countries like Myanmar, Malaysia, the Philippines, Cambodia, Thailand and Laos resemble it, where a long rectangular {{piece of cloth}} is draped around the body. These {{are different from the}} sari as they are wrapped around the lower-half of body as a skirt, worn with a shirt/blouse and resemble a <b>sarong,</b> as seen in the Burmese Longyi, Filipino Malong and Tapis, Laotian Xout lao and Suea pat, Thai Sbai and Sinh, Cambodian Sampot and Timorese Tais.

The Ao Dai was created when tucks which were close fitting and compact were added in the 1920s to this Chinese style. Trousers and tunics on the Chinese pattern in 1774 were ordered by the Vo Vuong Emperor to replace the <b>sarong</b> type Vietnamese clothing. The Chinese clothing {{in the form of}} trousers and tunic were mandated by the Vietnamese Nguyen government. It was up to the 1920s in Vietnam's north area in isolated hamlets where skirts were worn.
