50|$|Conventionally, {{the first}} {{transaction}} in a block is <b>special</b> <b>transactions</b> that starts a new coin {{owned by the}} creator of the block adding an incentive for master nodes to start supporting the network, and provides away to initially distribute coins into circulation, since there is no central authority to issue at the creator. The steady addition of a constant of amount of new coins is analogous to gold miners expending resources to add gold to circulation. In Vic Coin case, it is CPU time and electricity that is expended. The incentive can as well be funded through transaction fees. If the output value of a transaction is less than its input value, the difference is a transaction fee that is added to the incentive value of the block containing the transaction. Once a predetermined number of coins have entered circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation free. The incentive may help encourage master nodes to stay honest. If a greedy attacker is able to assemble more CPU power than all the honest master nodes, the attacker would have to choose between using it to defraud people by stealing back his payments, or using it to generate new coins. He ought to find it more profit able to play by the rules, such rules that favour the attacker with more new coins than everyone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth.|$|E

It is demonstrated that the opposition of transaction cost and transformation cost is not rigid and there are costs that contain both transaction and transformation component. In addition the amount of transaction cost depends on parameters of company’s activity. This {{is why it is}} hardly possible to find the precise minimum of transaction cost and the model of organization of transactions within firm will be flexible. The firm’s structure contains <b>special</b> <b>transaction</b> divisions (centers of transaction cost) that are necessary for existence of the firm as a mechanism of organization of transactions (opposed to market). The status of these divisions depends on firm’s size. Transaction divisions can also exist outside the firm. They will minimize transaction costs of other economic agents on the basis of external effect of scale. External transaction divisions can exist both as collective structures (coordinating centers of strategic alliances) as well as independent ones (franchisors). A comparative analysis of transaction divisions and centers of cost was done. It was demonstrated that these elements of the firm have different economic and organizational structure. The notion of cost of external profitability was introduced. This notion can be used to analyze reasons for merger of companies or for their existence as independent structures. It is demonstrated that one of the functions of the firm is to use resources that cannot be used within independent production units...|$|R

40|$|Hardware lock elision (HLE) {{concurrently}} executes lock critical sections as hardware transactions, but fallbacks to {{the original}} se-quential lock fallback path when some hardware transaction fails. Recent software-assisted lock-removal based schemes provide a better concurrency by sacrificing safety (opacity). Hardware trans-actions can execute {{at the same time}} with the lock fallback path {{as long as they do}} not try to commit. This limited concurrency is ben-eficial, but enables hardware transactions to see inconsistent mem-ory states, that may lead to illegal instructions, corrupted memory, and other unsafe behaviors. We propose a novel reduced hardware lock elision algorithm (RH-LE). It provides a safe (and opaque) concurrency between hardware transactions and the lock fallback path. The core idea behind the RH-LE approach is to execute the lock fallback path as a rollback-only hardware transaction, that tracks only the mem-ory writes of the <b>transaction.</b> This <b>special</b> hardware <b>transaction</b> is already introduced in the IBM Power 8 ISA specification with the intention to be used only for non-shared writes. We propose to use the rollback-only hardware transaction for all of the writes, shared or non-shared, and in this way to hide all of the write modifica-tions of the lock fallback path till its successful commit. The hiding process preserves opacity of concurrent hardware transactions, and allows read-only hardware transactions to commit even when there is a concurrent fallback execution. Currently, IBM Power 8 processors are unavailable for public use, and therefore we implement a software-based simulation of the RH-LE algorithm. It shows that the new lock elision scheme has the potential to be almost 2 times faster than other lock elision techniques. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- The Ad Hoc {{network has}} {{attracted}} {{more and more}} attention with its good performance and <b>special</b> application. Many <b>transactions,</b> such as real-time multimedia and audio-video transmission have strict demand for QoS parameters, which requires that we find a QoS routing in multi-constrained conditions. Generally, multiconstrained QoS routing is an NP-Complete problem. The drawbacks of the ad hoc network—poor quality of network links, frequent topology change and low capacity, make it more complicated for the QoS guarantee because the time and information needed for the algorithm to search path is relatively limited. We propose a modified ant colony algorithm based on the orientation factor to solve multi-constrained QoS routing problem by recurring to GPS location. This algorithm employs the orientation factor to adjust the search act of ants and update pheromones according to objective function values, thus guaranteeing the speed and effeciency of the search，and avoiding falling into local optimization.
