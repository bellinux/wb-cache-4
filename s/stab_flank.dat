40|$|Stress Engineering Services (SES) was {{contracted}} by Mr. John Watts to {{test his}} threaded connection developed for oilfield oil and gas service. This particular test required {{the application of a}} variety of loads including axial tension and compression, internal pressure (gas), external pressure (water), bending and both low and elevated temperature. These loads were used to determine the sealing and structural limits of the connection. The connection design tested had tapered threads with 10 threads per inch. A square thread form and a round thread form were tested. The square thread form had a 2 {sup o} load flank and 15 {sup o} <b>stab</b> <b>flank.</b> The round thread had a 0 {sup o} load flank and 20 {sup o} <b>stab</b> <b>flank.</b> Most of the testing was performed on the round thread form. Both a coupled connection design and an integral connection design were tested. The coupling was a pin by pin (male) thread, with the pipe having a box (female) thread. Both designs have outside and inside diameters that are flush with the pipe body. Both designs also contain a small external shoulder. The test procedure selected for this evaluation was the newly written ISO 13679 procedure for full scale testing of casing and tubing connections. The ISO procedure requires a variety of tests that includes makeup/breakout testing, internal gas sealability/external water sealability testing with axial tension, axial compression, bending, internal gas thermal cycle tests and limit load (failure) tests. This test was performed with four coupled samples and included most of these loads. Two integral samples were also included for limit load testing ISO makeup/breakout tests are divided into three types [...] initial makeup, IML 1, repeated makeup within the same sample, MBL, and repeated makeup using several samples called round robin, RR. IMU and MBL were performed in this project. The ISO sealing and structural procedure is divided into four primary tests and identified as Series A, B, C and Limit Load (failure). Series A and B test to 95 % actual yield of the pipe and Series C uses 90 % of actual yield. Samples 1 and 3 were tested to Series A and the loads are shown in Figure 1. For these samples, the axial compression was limited to 75 % pipe body yield, which was set by Mr. Watts {{at the beginning of the}} test. Samples 2 and 4 were tested to Series B with loads shown in Figure 2. This series included 20 degrees per 100 feet bending but no external pressure. Due to premature leaks, no samples were subjected to Series C which included mechanical and thermal cycles. Samples 5 and 6 were tested to failure. The project started with the selection and purchase of a popular size of oilfield pipe, which was 7 -inch OD, 32 pound per foot, P- 110 casing. While the connections were being threaded, material tensile tests were performed to get the actual strength of the 7 -inch pipe. The first samples contained a square thread form. Excessive galling was experienced during the first series of makeup/breakout tests and Mr. Watts decided to change the thread form and remachine the samples. The second samples had a round thread form and performed very well in the makeup/breakout tests. Basically no galling occurred of any consequence. Samples 1 and 3 were to be tested with external water (ISO Series A) while samples 2 and 4 were to be tested with bending (ISO Series B, no external pressure). Testing of all four samples started with tension and internal gas pressure. During this initial pressure testing, samples 1, 3 and 4 developed leaks and the test was stopped before any external pressure or bending was applied. Sample 2 successfully tested to ISO Load Point 5 which included bending before developing a leak. Figure 3 shows the loads at which the samples leaked and the relative pipe body performance capability. Sample 1 and end A of sample 2 held a high pressure while samples 3, 4 and end B of sample 2 leaked at relatively low pressures. All of these leaks were with nitrogen gas pressure. After reviewing the results, it was believed that several conditions may have contributed to the premature leaks: The BOL 2000 thread lubricant contains solid particles that are larger than the solid particles in API 5 A 2 compound. Possibly the large particles prevented tight thread contact necessary for gas leak tightness. The BOL 2000 lubricant may have caused or at least contributed to the yielding of the pin end during makeup. Pin inward deformation was found in some pins subsequent to testing and breakout. Excessive yielding of the pin or box will contribute to poor thread contact and leakage. The connections were made up to full or near full shoulder contact. This causes the end of the pin to be stressed near the yield strength. This along with the interference caused by the thread compound may cause excessive pin hoop stresses and yielding which in turn gives relatively loose thread contact. This behavior is present when repeated makeup and breakout occurs...|$|E
40|$|When {{establishing}} oil wells, pipe sections {{are connected}} {{by means of}} threaded couplings. In an effort to minimize the possibility of failure by jumpout, standard buttress connections were introduced. Part of their strength is directly acquired {{as a result of}} radial interference during make-up. This paper discusses the results of a numerical study evaluating the effect of make-up on the performance of a standard 4. 5 inch API buttress connection when axial tensile force is applied. In order to characterize the structural performance, the load distribution along the coupling length is evaluated, combined with a parameter defining thread separation. The latter is indicative for jumpout and the tendency of creating a leak path throughout the thread helix. From the results it is clear that relative axial displacement within the coupling occurs, even when made up, because of an initial clearance among the load and <b>stab</b> <b>flanks.</b> This clearance may cause a connection to leak through the thread helix when available thread compound cannot heal this leak path. Despite undesirable effects on the sealability and rigidness of this joint, such a clearance is required to decrease frictional forces during make-up while maintaining the desired radial interference...|$|R
40|$|The {{amount of}} torque {{required}} to either further tighten or loosen the connection under tension and pressure was determined from the threaded {{model and the}} same method of summing thread forces x radii. Using 0. 021 friction coef-ficient, the torques were: Nominal tapers at three turns, torque = 5 5 3 8 ft â€¢ lb Addition of 500 kips tension = 5628 ft*lb Addition of 11, 220 psi pressure = 10, 480 ft-lb Therefore, tension has negligible effect and pressure has a significant effect. The lack of effect by tension is due to loss of preload force on the <b>stab</b> <b>flanks</b> being equal to the increase of force on the load flanks, thereby producing no change on total torque. This behavior was also recognized by Clinedinst. Effect of Yielding on Torque Part II of this paper discusses elastic and plastic solutions with the threaded finite element model that used to determine maximum strain for 5. 4 turns, 9350 psi and 660 kips tension. The assembly interference was for a fast pin and slow box, with interferences of 0. 0079 in. at the pin end and 0. 0231 in. at the box end. Stresses were compared in Fig. 12 of Part II and showed significant reductions due to yielding of the P-l 10 material with the stress/strain relationship shown in Fig. 11 of Part II. The same solutions were {{used to compare the}} effects of load and yielding on torque with results given in Table 7. Torque reduction due to yielding when assembled was 11 percent and the reduction at full load was 16 percent. The reductions are not particularly high but do show a source of variation in the torque/turn relationship that can occur for makeup. The elastic assembly solution {{can also be used to}} check above equation (3) for torque. The radius at the middle of the 3. 25 in, length of threads was 3. 418 in. The inside radius was 3. 116 in. and the outside radius was 3. 833 in., which gives the following calculated values...|$|R
40|$|Controversy {{about the}} {{appropriate}} evaluation of penetrating abdominal, flank, and back injuries prompted this retrospective review of 311 patients at an urban level I trauma center over 5 years. Seventy-five (24 %) patients sustained gunshot wounds to the abdomen. All patients with gunshot wounds underwent exploratory laparotomy; results of 67 laparotomies (89 %) were positive. Of 236 patients sustaining stab wounds (140 abdominal wounds, 51 flank wounds, 26 back wounds, and 19 wounds to multiple sites), 147 were treated {{according to a}} selective protocol, based on results of physical examination, wound exploration, peritoneal lavage, and ancillary diagnostic studies. No injuries were found at celiotomy in three (2 %) of these 147 patients. One false-negative result of evaluation of a flank wound occurred. Significant injuries were found in 13 patients (68 %) with stab wounds to multiple sites, 61 patients (44 %) with abdominal stab wounds, 15 patients (29 %) with <b>flank</b> <b>stab</b> wounds, and four patients (15 %) with back stab wounds. Mandatory exploration of gunshot wounds is justified. Physical findings of intra-abdominal injury or positive results of peritoneal lavage identify stab wound victims likely to benefit from surgical exploration. A policy of mandatory observation or routine celiotomy for treatment of stab wounds is not justified...|$|R
