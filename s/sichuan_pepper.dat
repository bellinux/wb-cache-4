Song restaurant and tavern menus are recorded which list entrées for feasts, banquets, festivals, and carnivals. They reveal a diverse and lavish diet for those of the upper class. They could choose {{from a wide variety}} of meats and seafood, including shrimp, geese, duck, mussel, shellfish, fallow deer, hare, partridge, pheasant, francolin, quail, fox, badger, clam, crab, and many others. Dairy products were rare in Chinese cuisine at this time. Beef was rarely consumed since the bull was a valuable draft animal, and dog meat was absent from the diet of the wealthy, although the poor could choose to eat dog meat if necessary (yet it was not part of their regular diet). People also consumed dates, raisins, jujubes, pears, plums, apricots, pear juice, lychee-fruit juice, honey and ginger drinks, pawpaw juice, spices and seasonings of <b>Sichuan</b> <b>pepper,</b> ginger, soy sauce, oil, sesame oil, salt, and vinegar.|$|E

According to Harold McGee in On Food and Cooking, they are not simply pungent; [...] "they produce a strange, tingling, buzzing, numbing sensation that is something like the effect of carbonated drinks or of a mild electric current (touching the terminals of a nine-volt battery to the tongue). Sanshools appear to act on several different kinds of nerve endings at once, induce sensitivity to touch and cold in nerves that are ordinarily nonsensitive, and so perhaps cause a kind of general neurological confusion." ...|$|R

However, unlike <b>Sichuan</b> <b>pepper</b> where only the pericarp of the fruit is used, uziza is used whole (both pericarp and seed). This may explain why uziza has a spicier flavour and greater pungency than <b>sichuan</b> <b>pepper.</b> However, Cary Cairncross of Raw Decadence South Africa (http://www.spiceclub.co.za/) writes (personal communication): [...] "I have an Igbo tribe supplier from Nigeria and he disagrees and says it is a local name for ashanti pepper (piper guineense)".|$|E
