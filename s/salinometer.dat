25|$|Salinity {{appears to}} play a role in the degree of {{deuterium}} fractionation as well; more saline waters affect growth rate, the rate of hydrogen exchange, and evaporation rate. All of these factors influence lipid δD upon hydrogen being incorporated into biomass. In coccolithophores Emiliania huxleyi and Gephyrocapsa oceanica, alkenone δD has been found to correlate strongly to organism growth rate divided by salinity. The relationship between deuterium fractionation and salinity could potentially be used in paleoenvironment reconstruction with preserved lipids in the rock record to determine, for example, ocean salinity at the time of organismal growth. However, the degree of fractionation is not necessarily consistent between organisms, complicating the determination of paleosalinity with this method. There also appears to be a negative correlation between growth rate and fractionation in these coccolithophores. Further experiments on unicellular algae Eudorina unicocca and Volvox aureus show no effect of growth rate (controlled by nitrogen limitation) on fatty acid δD. However, sterols become more D-depleted as growth rate increases, in agreement with alkenone isotopic composition in coccolithophores. Overall, although there are some strong trends with lipid δD, the specific fractionations are compound-specific.

40|$|The {{determination}} of salinity {{by means of}} electrical conductivity relies on stable salt proportions in the North Atlantic Ocean, because standard seawater, which is required for <b>salinometer</b> calibration, is produced from water of the North Atlantic. To verify the long-term stability of the standard seawater composition, it was proposed to perform measurements of the standard seawater density. Since the density is sensitive to all salt components, a density measurement can detect {{any change in the}} composition. A conversion of the density values to salinity can be performed by means of a density–salinity relation. To use such a relation with a target uncertainty in salinity comparable to that in salinity obtained from conductivity measurements, a density measurement with an uncertainty of 2  g m − 3 is mandatory. We present a new density–salinity relation based on such accurate density measurements. The substitution measurement method used is described and density corrections for uniform isotopic and chemical compositions are reported. The comparison of densities calculated using the new relation with those calculated using the present reference equations of state TEOS- 10 suggests that the density accuracy of TEOS- 10 (as well as that of EOS- 80) has been overestimated, as the accuracy of some of its underlying density measurements had been overestimated.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{salinity}} on the elemental and isotopic skeletal composition of modern zooxanthellate scleractinian corals (Acropora sp., Montipora verrucosa and Stylophora pistillata) {{was investigated in}} order to evaluate potential salinity proxies. Corals were cultured in the laboratory at three salinities (36, 38 and 40). The other environmental parameters were kept constant. For all species analyzed, Sr/Ca, Mg/Ca, U/Ca and Li/Ca ratios were not influenced by salinity changes. The Ba/Ca ratio also lacks a systematic relationship with salinity and exhibits high inter-generic variations, up to one order of magnitude. On the contrary, the Cd/Ca ratio decreases {{as a function of}} increasing salinity, and δ 18 O and δ 13 C also presented a significant response, but with opposite trends to salinity variations. Since Cd/Ca is usually considered as an upwelling proxy, its salinity dependence could compromise the upwelling signal, unless some corrections can be carried out. Regardless, if the dependence found in the present dataset proved to be widespread and systematic, the Cd/Ca ratio could represent a promising <b>salinometer</b> awaiting further investigation. This study also confirmed the reliability of the well-established temperature proxies Sr/Ca, Mg/Ca and U/Ca, as these ratios were insensitive to salinity variations. Moreover, our results showed that δ 18 O or δ 13 C can be considered as reliable temperature recorders as far as the salinity effect is removed from the parameter reconstructed (e. g., temperature).
