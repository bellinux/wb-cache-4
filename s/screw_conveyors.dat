5000|$|There {{are many}} options for moving grain from one {{location}} to another. Some of these options include conveyors such as belt conveyors, drag conveyors, <b>screw</b> <b>conveyors,</b> and pneumatic conveyors. Belt conveyors cause the least damage to grain {{due to the}} lack of contact forces, however, they cannot be used for steep inclines. Another commonly used conveyor is <b>screw</b> <b>conveyors.</b> <b>Screw</b> <b>conveyors,</b> also known as augers, are conveyors made from a helical blade with rotational motion to move grain. They are on many types of farm equipment, including combines and grain carts for example. Augers generally have a high power requirements, but are portable and low cost. In addition, augers tend to cause high levels of mechanical damage to the grain. Much research has been completed to quantify the amount of grain damage caused by various <b>screw</b> <b>conveyors.</b> The percentage of grain damage is decreased when the auger is operated at capacity because the grain cannot bounce around and strike surfaces as easily. In addition, grain damage increases with increased rotational speed. For this research with <b>screw</b> <b>conveyors,</b> the angle of the incline was found to have no significant effect on the grain damage.Pneumatic conveyors use a moving air-stream to propel grain, and are used in situations when the path of the grain is complex. Grain damage can occur especially at any changes in the tube path, but can be minimized when air speeds are kept below 25 meters per second. [...] It is shown that grain damage increases exponentially above air velociities of 20 meters per second. [...] In research by Baker et al. breakage levels of maize in pneumatic conveyors were found to be similar to those of bucket or drag conveyors.|$|E

5000|$|A screw {{conveyor}} or auger conveyor is a mechanism {{that uses a}} rotating helical screw blade, called a [...] "flighting", usually within a tube, to move liquid or granular materials. They are used in many bulk handling industries. <b>Screw</b> <b>conveyors</b> in modern industry are often used horizontally or at a slight incline as {{an efficient way to}} move semi-solid materials, including food waste, wood chips, aggregates, cereal grains, animal feed, boiler ash, meat and bone meal, municipal solid waste, and many others. The first type of {{screw conveyor}} was the Archimedes' screw, used since ancient times to pump irrigation water.|$|E
50|$|Conveyors {{are used}} when {{material}} {{is to be}} moved frequently between specific points over a fixed path and {{when there is a}} sufficient flow volume to justify the fixed conveyor investment. Different types of conveyors can be characterized by the type of product being handled: unit load or bulk load; the conveyor’s location: in-floor, on-floor, or overhead, and whether or not loads can accumulate on the conveyor. Accumulation allows intermittent movement of each unit of material transported along the conveyor, while all units move simultaneously on conveyors without accumulation capability. For example, while both the roller and flat-belt are unit-load on-floor conveyors, the roller provides accumulation capability while the flat-belt does not; similarly, both the power-and-free and trolley are unit-load overhead conveyors, with the power-and-free designed to include an extra track in order to provide the accumulation capability lacking in the trolley conveyor. Examples of bulk-handling conveyors include the magnetic-belt, troughed-belt, bucket, and <b>screw</b> <b>conveyors.</b> A sortation conveyor system is used for merging, identifying, inducting, and separating products to be conveyed to specific destinations, and typically consists of flat-belt, roller, and chute conveyor segments together with various moveable arms and/or pop-up wheels and chains that deflect, push, or pull products to different destinations.|$|E
