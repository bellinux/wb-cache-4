5|$|Massaquoi {{spent her}} first seven years with her father's sister, Mama Jassa, in Njagbacca in the Garwula District of Grand Cape Mount County. While she was there, {{one of her}} father's six wives, Ma Sedia, seriously injured Fatima's hands for a misdemeanor. This caused her {{considerable}} pain throughout her childhood, hampering her ability to play the violin. She later became a highly competent player, though she remained <b>self-conscious</b> <b>about</b> the scarring even as an adult. After elementary school, she was sent to boarding school at Julia C. Emery Hall, attached to the Bromley Mission near Clay-Ashland in Montserrado County.|$|E
5|$|Many {{people start}} {{to show up at}} the Quahog's Men's Club and Lois and her friends start to get annoyed. In order to get back at them, they enter the club. Everyone dances, except for Bonnie, because her husband is handicapped. Joe feels <b>self-conscious</b> <b>about</b> his disability, and decides to get surgery so that {{he will be able to}} walk again. When Joe comes out of the operation, he invites his friends to go do {{physical}} activities such as rock climbing, karate, and dance. Joe starts to not care about his friends and his wife, and finds three new jock friends that share his status. Lois and Peter are worried about Joe, and Lois suggests that Peter should find a new friend to replace him. Meanwhile, Joe realizes that he has outgrown Bonnie and leaves her. Desperate to get their friend back, Peter, Cleveland and Quagmire try to re-cripple Joe, failing miserably until Bonnie comes along with Joe's handgun and shoots (and misses) Joe's spine. Sick of waiting in pain, Joe takes the gun and shoots himself in the spine, re-crippling himself. They all then go to the Drunken Clam where Joe apologizes to Peter, Cleveland and Quagmire for how he acted and they all forgive him.|$|E
5|$|Kotarou invites {{three other}} girls into the occult {{research}} society {{who are also}} heroines in the game. One is Kotori Kanbe, Kotarou's childhood friend in his class who has few friends and starts attending school regularly after joining the club. She has a playful personality and has an extremely strong pet dog named Chibi-Moth, which is actually a familiar created by Kotori {{from the body of}} her dead pet dog Pero. However, she is not affiliated with Gaia or Guardian, and instead follows in the path of an ancient sect of summoners called Druids who revered nature and protected Kagari with familiars. Another heroine is first-year student Sizuru Nakatsu, a shy girl on the public morals committee who has excellent hearing, eyesight and can read lips. She has heterochromia, though wears an eyepatch over her golden-colored right eye as she is very <b>self-conscious</b> <b>about</b> it; her left eye is blue. Sizuru is a member of Guardian who has the ability to produce various chemicals inside her body which can be used to heal herself and others, paralyze and cause amnesia. Sizuru joins the club with her close friend Lucia Konohana, another heroine and the class representative of Kotarou's class. Lucia is easily agitated by the antics of boys and often punches Kotarou when he annoys her. She is obsessed with cleanliness and always wears gloves. Like Sizuru, Lucia is a member of Guardian and has the ability to produces poisonous miasma and pus {{as a result of an}} experiment by Guardian, which she takes medication for to suppress. She can also create vibrations within the objects she touches and break glass at a distance. Both Lucia and Sizuru have superhuman speed, agility, and reflexes in addition to their other abilities.|$|E

The most celebrated segment of her act was her progressive shedding of clothing until she wore just a jeweled bra and some ornaments upon her arms and head. She was seldom seen without a bra as she was <b>self-conscious</b> <b>about</b> being small-breasted. She wore a bodystocking for her performances that was similar in color to her own skin.|$|E
25|$|John Sitaras {{was born}} in Chios, Greece, in 1972. His family moved to the United States when he was 3 months old and {{he grew up in}} Brooklyn, in a rough neighborhood. <b>Self-conscious</b> <b>about</b> his 5-foot-11, 145-pound frame, Sitaras started {{bodybuilding}} at the age of 17, competing in bodybuilding within a year, and finishing fourth in his first regional competition in 1992.

25|$|Rivette's {{next film}} was L'amour fou. Frustrated by filmmaking convention, {{he wanted to}} create an improvisational atmosphere. Rivette {{disposed}} of a script, shot list and specific direction, experimenting with scenarios and groups of actors. On a limited budget, he shot the film in five weeks. After seeing performances by director Marc'O's experimental-improvisational theater group, Rivette cast Marc'O actors Jean-Pierre Kalfon and Bulle Ogier as the leads; other Marc'O performers appeared in supporting roles. According to the director, he cast Kalfon because of his dissimilarity to Rivette since he was <b>self-conscious</b> <b>about</b> the character's autobiographical aspects.|$|E
40|$|Open {{government}} data answers cities' {{need for}} new capital resources in a post-recession context and addresses a <b>self-conscious</b> concern <b>about</b> the lagging technological modernization of public institutions. This understanding promotes data-centric management strategies and encourages a mechanistic {{understanding of how to}} solve city problems; it leads to new data hybrids born out of data-sharing partnerships between government and the private sector. This proceeding focuses specifically on how, through open data work, staff view their records as administrative and commercial assets and fonts of innovation that improve private and public sector services. Some employees see city records as a source of easy capital, whether cost-saving efficiencies internally or innovation by the private sector. Others see open data as a solution for managing outsized, complex city problems...|$|R
40|$|In 1977 Robert Garioch {{was asked}} by Duncan Glen, as editor of 'Akros', to {{describe}} his poetic language. He did so very succinctly; "My language is my native local Scots, plus words and expressions of any other date or provenance, from speech, dictionaries and books: I follow the practice of most writers in Scots, at least since they became <b>self-conscious</b> sometime <b>about</b> the eighteenth century. Latterly I have been inclined to spell less phonetically, assuming, e. g. that a reader will not usually pronounce the final letters of 'and' and 'of'. Also I use Scots of different styles for different purposes, and try {{to use it as}} any writer would use any language. " This description is very helpful and what this paper aims to do is largely to flesh out these comments with details. In particular it takes up Garioch's comment that he used "Scots of different styles for different purposes". Indeed, the whole question of his language will be examined from this particular angle...|$|R
40|$|The {{forceful}} {{impact of}} Michel Foucault’s {{work in the}} {{humanities and social sciences}} is apparent from the sheer abundance of its uses, appropriations, and refigurations. This article calls for greater <b>self-conscious</b> reflexivity <b>about</b> the relationship between our uses of Foucault and the opportunities afforded by his work. We argue for a clearer distinction between analytics and concepts in Foucault-inspired work. In so doing we draw on key moments of methodological self-reflection in Foucault’s Collège de France lectures and elsewhere. This distinction helps identify different ways that Foucault might be put to productive use today as well as what can go wrong therein, a concern we develop with reference to Giorgio Agamben’s post-Foucaultian contributions to political theory. We are eager to open up a possibility that has been infrequently explored despite Foucault’s contemporary influence—-the idea that critique in and through Foucault is empirical critique. This idea can help facilitate a gain in reflexivity in the broader landscapes of contemporary theory, inquiry, and critique...|$|R

However, Blackwell never permitted Barry to develop her own interests. She didn't {{make an effort to}} introduce Barry to young men or women of her age. Barry herself was rather shy, awkward and <b>self-conscious</b> <b>about</b> her slight deafness. Barry followed Blackwell during her many trans-Atlantic moves, during her furious house hunt between 1874 and 1875, during which they moved six times, and finally to Blackwell's final home, Rock House, a small house off Exmouth Place in Hastings, Sussex, in 1879.|$|E
25|$|Adams {{attended}} Primrose Hill Primary School in Brentwood. At nine, {{he passed}} the entrance exam for Brentwood School, an independent school whose alumni include Robin Day, Jack Straw, Noel Edmonds, and David Irving. Griff Rhys Jones was a year below him, {{and he was in}} the same class as Stuckist artist Charles Thomson. He attended the prep school from 1959 to 1964, then the main school until December 1970. Adams was six feet tall (1.83m) by age 12 and stopped growing at 6ft 5in (1.96m). His form master, Frank Halford, said his height had made him stand out and that he had been <b>self-conscious</b> <b>about</b> it. His ability to write stories made him well known in the school. He became the only student ever to be awarded a ten out of ten by Halford for creative writing, something he remembered {{for the rest of his}} life, particularly when facing writer's block.|$|E
25|$|Developing {{a sexual}} {{self-concept}} {{is an important}} developmental step during adolescence. This is when adolescents {{try to make sense}} and organize their sexual experiences so that they understand the structures and underlying motivations for their sexual behavior. This sexual self-concept helps adolescents organize their past experiences, but also gives them information to draw on for their current and future sexual thoughts and experiences. Sexual self-concept affects sexual behavior for both men and women, but it also affects relationship development for women. Development of one’s sexual self-concept can occur even before sexual experiences begin. An important part of sexual self-concept is sexual esteem, which includes how one evaluates their sexuality (including their thoughts, emotions and sexual activities). Another aspect is sexual anxiety; this includes one’s negative evaluations of sex and sexuality. Sexual self-concept is not only developed from sexual experiences; both girls and boys can learn from a variety of social interactions such as their family, sexual education programs, depictions in the media and from their friends and peers. Girls with a positive self-schema {{are more likely to be}} liberal in their attitudes about sex, are more likely to view themselves as passionate and open to sexual experience and are more likely to rate sexual experiences as positive. Their views towards relationships show that they place high importance on romance, love and intimacy. Girls who have a more negative view often say they feel <b>self-conscious</b> <b>about</b> their sexuality and view sexual encounters more negatively. The sexual self-concept of girls with more negative views are highly influenced by other people; those of girls who hold more positive views are less so.|$|E

Roger Gelwicks of Jesus Freak Hideout.com says that [...] "Diamond doesn't feel very surprising in its execution, although {{this is probably the}} most radio-friendly Velasquez has ever been...songs with innovation and vibrancy just aren't to be found here".

His overseer and advisor throughout his world domination plots is Uka Uka, whom Cortex ironically feared at first {{to the point that}} he got down {{on his hands and knees}} in his presence. Overtime, this fear of Uka Uka would disappear, leading to Cortex opposing his own replacement in Crash of the Titans and eventually revolting against him in Crash: Mind over Mutant, citing a desire to [...] "run this operation ... again" [...] as justification for his actions. Cortex has been described as having an ego [...] "the size of a hot air balloon".

40|$|Philosophy {{has long}} become a key {{term in the}} study of Buddhism, {{defining}} the moral and rational essence of the Buddha’s teaching, emblematic of its Indian origins. In this essay, I suggest that the relation of Buddhism and philosophy, which prior to the mid-nineteenth century was framed as the relation of the Religion of Fo to the cult of voidness, was reformulated in the self-styled language of science {{in the wake of the}} study of Buddhism from Sanskrit sources. Specifically, I suggest that the philosophical dimension of Eugène Burnouf’s reading of the Divyāvadāna and his idea of “simple sūtra” played a crucial role in defining Buddhism as a philosophy for the late nineteenth and into the twentieth century. The idea of a “simple moral philosophy” emerged in Burnouf’s particular reading of the story of the Buddha’s last days in the Divyāvadāna and the Mahāparinibbāṇa Sutta, as the play of magic and death unfolds in the theme of the master’s denial of the will to live. Burnouf’s philosophical reading rests on the purification, in the theme of the Buddha’s parinirvāṇa, of the foundations of magical power (catvāra ṛddhipāda) that articulate knowledge of this world and beyond in the Buddha’s discourses. In the conclusion, I reformulate Burnouf’s question about the Buddha’s moral philosophy in his study of the simple sūtras vis-à-vis the historically <b>self-conscious</b> question <b>about</b> the Buddha’s ability to defer death by magic that traces back to the early debate of Buddhist exegetical traditions...|$|R

40|$|In my {{dissertation}} I {{show that}} we cannot conceive of ourselves as embodied beings unless we know some of our physical features without observation or inference. I also argue {{that we have the}} requisite sort of self-knowledge, and that it consists in our knowledge of ourselves as intentional agents. Descartes claimed that when one is self-consciously aware of oneself, one is aware of oneself as a purely psychological being. In chapter two I argue that if his claim were correct, it would be unclear what it could mean for one to identify oneself with a human being. I then argue that <b>self-conscious</b> beliefs <b>about</b> oneself are beliefs about oneself that are not grounded on observation or inference. In chapter three I take up the task of making it plausible that we do possess the required sort of self-knowledge. I offer a novel interpretation of Anscombe's thesis that we know what we are doing intentionally without observation or inference. The key lies in the Aristotelian doctrine that action itself can be the conclusion of practical reasoning. In chapter four I reply to two objections to my account. The first is an argument for volitionalism, or the thesis that events that are describable as an agent's moving her body are acts of trying that occur prior to her bodily movements. In response, I argue for an alternative, according to which bodily action is a temporally extended process that is complete only when one's body has moved. The second argument begins from the premise that we can act intentionally without knowing that we are succeeding. I argue that this shows only that our self-conscious capacity to act intentionally is fallible in a certain respect. Conditions which potentially inhibit the success of one's doing such-and-such intentionally also inhibit one's capacity to know that one is doing so when the action is successful. Finally, in chapter five I defend a non-reductionistic account of intentional action in contrast to dominant reductionistic models. I conclude that an intentional action is simply an exercise of a rational agent's will, described as such...|$|R
40|$|Stich {{begins his}} paper "What is a Theory of Mental Representation?"

This is quite remarkable, he thinks, because if we bother to engage in such reflection, some very surprising conclusions begin to emerge. The most surprising conclusion of all, according to Stich, {{is that most of the}} philosophers in this field are undertaking work that is quite futile: It is my contention that most of the players in this very crowded field have no coherent project that could possibly be pursued successfully with the methods they are using. (p. 244) Stich readily admits that this is a startling conclusion; so startling, he thinks, that some may even take it as an indication that he has simply "failed to figure out what those who are searching for a theory of mental representation are up to" (p. 244). But it is a conclusion that he is willing to stand by, and he sets about it defending it in the body of his paper. Stich, I think, is right about thisI do take his conclusion to indicate that he has failed to figure out what those who are searching for a theory of mental representation are up to. And he has failed to do this largely because he has failed to distinguish between the theory of mind that is implicit in our folk psychology and the mental mechanism that is responsible for our capacity to make folk psychological judgements. When this conflation is undone, so too is the reasoning that takes Stich to his startling conclusion. This is not to say that the conclusion itself is clearly false; it is merely to say that Stich has failed to show that it is true. In what follows I will defend this analysis of Stich's self-conscious reflections on what a theory of mental representation is supposed to do. I will begin with a very brief exposition of Stich's survey of the logical terrain in this part of the philosophical landscape and the line of reasoning that subsequently delivers up the aforementioned conclusion. I will then go on to argue that the latter line of reasoning is fundamentally misdirected because of an error in the former survey...|$|R
