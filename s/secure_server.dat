2500|$|As {{this would}} have been too {{expensive}} for Plex to register directly to a certificate authority a certificate each time a Plex user subscribes to a Plex account, Plex had to become a registration authority (RA) (also called subordinate CA). They choose DigiCert to partner with. This kind of offer is often called a private PKI. In DigiCert terms, this is called Managed PKI. In this way of configuration, each user domain name will have a wildcard certificate as [...] Each user's certificate is thus not signed directly by the sub CA of DigiCert (currently DigiCert SHA2 <b>Secure</b> <b>Server</b> CA) anymore, but by Plex directly (Plex Devices High Assurance CA2) which itself is signed by DigiCert root certificates.|$|E
