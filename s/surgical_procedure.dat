40|$|Context: Periodontal <b>surgical</b> <b>procedures</b> produce {{varying degree}} {{of stress in}} all patients. Nitrous oxide-oxygen {{inhalation}} sedation is very effective for adult patients with mild-to-moderate anxiety due to dental procedures and needle phobia. Aim: The present {{study was designed to}} perform periodontal <b>surgical</b> <b>procedures</b> under nitrous oxide-oxygen inhalation sedation and assess whether this technique actually reduces stress physiologically, in comparison to local anesthesia alone (LA) during lengthy periodontal <b>surgical</b> <b>procedures.</b> Settings and Design: This was a randomized, split-mouth, cross-over study. Materials and Methods: A total of 16 patients were selected for this randomized, split-mouth, cross-over study. One surgical session (SS) was performed under local anesthesia aided by nitrous oxide-oxygen inhalation sedation, and the other SS was performed on the contralateral quadrant under LA. For each session, blood samples to measure and evaluate serum cortisol levels were obtained, and vital parameters including blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and arterial blood oxygen saturation were monitored before, during, and after periodontal <b>surgical</b> <b>procedures.</b> Statistical Analysis Used: Paired t-test and repeated measure ANOVA. Results: The findings of the present study revealed a statistically significant decrease in serum cortisol levels, blood pressure and pulse rate and a statistically significant increase in respiratory rate and arterial blood oxygen saturation during periodontal <b>surgical</b> <b>procedures</b> under nitrous oxide inhalation sedation. Conclusion: Nitrous oxide-oxygen inhalation sedation for periodontal <b>surgical</b> <b>procedures</b> is capable of reducing stress physiologically, in comparison to LA during lengthy periodontal <b>surgical</b> <b>procedures...</b>|$|R
5|$|Placement {{of dental}} {{implants}} is a <b>surgical</b> <b>procedure</b> and carries the normal risks of surgery including infection, excessive bleeding and necrosis of the flap of tissue around the implant. Nearby anatomic structures, {{such as the}} inferior alveolar nerve, the maxillary sinus and blood vessels, can also be injured when the osteotomy is created or the implant placed. Even when {{the lining of the}} maxillary sinus is perforated by an implant, long term sinusitis is rare. An inability to place the implant in bone to provide stability of the implant (referred to as primary stability of the implant) increases the risk of failure to osseointegration.|$|E
5|$|Stephanie Brown {{became the}} {{featured}} {{character of the}} Batgirl series from 2009 to 2011. DC subsequently relaunched all their monthly publications during The New 52 relaunch.

These changes were retained {{as part of the}} 2016 DC Rebirth event. As Batgirl, Barbara Gordon has been adapted into various media relating to the Batman franchise, including television, film, animation, video games, and other merchandise. The character's popularity from adaptations factored into the decision to have her return to the comics, and Dan DiDio, co-publisher of DC Comics, expressed that she is the best-known version of the character.|$|E
5|$|Anomalies and malformations of the pinna are common. These {{anomalies}} include chromosome syndromes such as ring 18. Children {{may also}} present cases of abnormal ear canals and low ear implantation. In rare cases no pinna is formed (atresia), or is extremely small (microtia). Small pinnae can develop when the auricular hillocks do not develop properly. The ear canal can fail to develop {{if it does}} not channelise properly or if there is an obstruction. Reconstructive surgery to treat hearing loss is considered as an option for children older than five, with a cosmetic <b>surgical</b> <b>procedure</b> to reduce the size or change the shape of the ear is called an otoplasty. The initial medical intervention is aimed at assessing the baby's hearing and the condition of the ear canal, as well as the middle and inner ear. Depending on the results of tests, reconstruction of the outer ear is done in stages, with planning for any possible repairs {{of the rest of the}} ear.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Extracting {{complete}} and accurate records of <b>surgical</b> <b>procedures</b> from case-notes is time consuming and laborious. We compared the completeness and time taken to extract data on <b>surgical</b> <b>procedures</b> from case-notes and from pathology reports. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Information on <b>surgical</b> <b>procedures</b> was extracted from pathology reports and hospital case-notes for 111 women {{with breast cancer}} in three centers. The time taken to perform this task was recorded. <b>Surgical</b> <b>procedures</b> were classified into diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, and analysis was performed to determine the completeness and accuracy of the documentation of the procedures. RESULTS: The average time taken to extract relevant information from the pathology reports (3. 0 minutes) was one-fifth that for the case-notes (14. 4 minutes). The case-notes documented slightly fewer procedures than the pathology records: 94 vs. 108 diagnostic and 108 vs. 110 therapeutic procedures, respectively. Of the 219 therapeutic and diagnostic <b>surgical</b> <b>procedures</b> recorded by both data sources, for 216 procedures there was exact agreement as to the specific type of procedure performed. CONCLUSIONS: Extraction of information on <b>surgical</b> <b>procedures</b> is faster from pathology records than from case-notes. The level of agreement for the specific type of procedure performed is excellent and, if anything, the pathology records are more complete than the case-notes...|$|R

5|$|A patient, Jillian Miller (Jessica Stroup), is {{admitted}} in obstetrics and gynaecology, and is revealed {{to suffer from}} advanced cervical cancer, which leads to her contacting her parents, from whom she ran away from years ago, along with her best friend Rachel Meyer (Rachel Boston). Stevens quickly becomes emotionally involved in the patient's situation and encourages her to return home, after learning that the two girls were Amish, shunned from their natal village. Torres and Yang operate on a runner who {{is admitted}} in orthopedics, coping {{with the news that}} he {{will never be able to}} compete in races after the extensive <b>surgical</b> <b>procedure.</b> Sloan announces his plans of returning to New York City, but abruptly decides to stay in Seattle, following Grey accidentally revealing Webber's retirement plans. Shepherd is displeased with Sloan's decision, which results in an argument between him and Grey, which threatens putting damage on their relationship. Webber returns to his wife, Adele (Loretta Devine), seeking forgiveness, but is left devastated at the realization that she has been spending the night with another man. Bailey ultimately finds support in Stevens, who proves enthusiastic to spend her entire US$8 million inheritance, for the opening of the free clinic.

5|$|Tracheal {{intubation}} is not {{a simple}} procedure and the consequences of failure are grave. Therefore, the patient is carefully evaluated for potential difficulty or complications beforehand. This involves taking the medical history of the patient and performing a physical examination, the results of which can be scored against one of several classification systems. The proposed <b>surgical</b> <b>procedure</b> (e.g., surgery involving the head and neck, or bariatric surgery) may lead one to anticipate difficulties with intubation. Many individuals have unusual airway anatomy, such as those who have limited movement of their neck or jaw, or those who have tumors, deep swelling due to injury or to allergy, developmental abnormalities of the jaw, or excess fatty tissue of the face and neck. Using conventional laryngoscopic techniques, intubation of the trachea can be difficult or even impossible in such patients. This is why all persons performing tracheal intubation must be familiar with alternative techniques of securing the airway. Use of the flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope and similar devices has become among the preferred techniques in the management of such cases. However, these devices require a different skill set than that employed for conventional laryngoscopy and are expensive to purchase, maintain and repair.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} the surgical outcome {{for patients with}} rhegmatogenous retinal detachment {{and to find out}} the factors influencing the anatomic reattachment and visual results. Material and Method: Retrospective review of the medical records of patients for the following details: age, sex, time to diagnosis, time to surgery, phakic status, types, numbers and locations of the retinal breaks, macular status, presence of proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR), types of <b>surgical</b> <b>procedures,</b> anatomic reattachment and visual improvement. Results: Two hundred and twelve patients were surgically treated by pneumatic retinopexy, scleral buckling, pars plana vitrectomy or combined procedures. Initial anatomic reattachment was found in 157 cases (74. 06 %) and final reattachment in 193 cases (91. 04 %). Several factors including age, phakic status, number of the retinal breaks, macular detachment, PVR and types of <b>surgical</b> <b>procedures</b> have been identified to have a correlation with the anatomic success rate. Types of <b>surgical</b> <b>procedures</b> and time to surgery within 8 weeks of detachment have also been demonstrated to have a correlation with final visual improvement. However, only types of <b>surgical</b> <b>procedures</b> had statistically significant difference. Pneumatic retinopexy had a lower anatomic reattachment rate, but obtained a higher visual improvement than did other <b>surgical</b> <b>procedures.</b> Moreover, after repeated pneumatic retinopexy or further <b>surgical</b> <b>procedures,</b> the final anatomic success rate improve...|$|R
40|$|The {{outcome of}} various <b>surgical</b> <b>procedures</b> {{carried out in}} {{patients}} with severe (homozygote) factor XII deficiency were investigated for the appearance of blood coagulation-related complications with particular emphasis on thrombotic complications. The <b>surgical</b> <b>procedures</b> were total mastectomy, tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy, placement of a hip prosthesis, and double hernia repair. None of the patients slowed any complication. Several other reported cases of <b>surgical</b> <b>procedures</b> carried out in several patients ware found in the literature. Bleeding or thrombotic complications were noted in none of these cases. The <b>surgical</b> <b>procedures</b> in some cases were minor such as adenoidectomy, tonsillectomy, or nasal polyp removal. However several major <b>surgical</b> <b>procedures</b> were carried out in some patients (cholecystectomy, gastrectomy, repair of atrial septal defect, coronary bypass). All patients remained asymptomatic. In some cases whole blood and/or plasma were used as requested by the caring surgeons. In a few patients, the plasma was given prophylactically because of the long partial thromboplastin time. Finally, three patients (two for cardiac surgery and one after hip replacement) received heparin prophylaxis as foreseen by accepted procedures without the undue sequels. These data supply further evidence that factor XII deficiency does not only show any bleeding tendency but also can withstand even major <b>surgical</b> <b>procedures</b> without thrombotic complications...|$|R
40|$|Several studies {{reported}} in the literature show that <b>surgical</b> <b>procedures</b> can be carried out for other than clinical indications. In Switzerland, no statistics on the "demography" of <b>surgical</b> <b>procedures</b> are available. But an earlier analysis of the "Swiss Health Survey 1992 / 93 " gave first indications on differences in rates of <b>surgical</b> <b>procedures</b> (hysterectomy, appendectomy, tonsillectomy and operation of the hip and gallbladder) by sex, educational status and region. This study, based on the same datasource (N = 10792), reveals an additional link with the health insurance status. The prevalence of <b>surgical</b> <b>procedures</b> is higher in privately insured than in persons with only basic insurance, independent of age, sex and region. The highest rates of <b>surgical</b> <b>procedures</b> (except tonsillectomy) are found among privately insured persons with a low educational status. Among 25 - 74 year old privately insured women, the lifetime-prevalence of a hysterectomy is 30 % with low and 13 % with high educational status (p <. 001). The corresponding prevalences of {{at least one of the}} mentioned <b>surgical</b> <b>procedures</b> (without tonsillectomy) are 49 % versus 28 % (p <. 001). As these are lifetime-prevalences, these rates do not necessarily reflect the actual <b>surgical</b> <b>procedures.</b> However, an analysis of the period of operation for hysterectomy and for the gallbladder shows the same pattern as the mentioned lifetime-prevalences. Higher rates among privately insured are also a frequent finding in the international literature. These findings should stimulate patients to ask for a "second opinion". Furthermore, there is an urge for the implementation of general hospital statistics to verify such findings. In addition, the scientific consensus on the indication of several <b>surgical</b> <b>procedures</b> should be promoted on the way to more evidence-based-medicine...|$|R
