50|$|There {{are several}} methodologies that allow a mobile handset to be {{integrated}} into a VoIP network.

50|$|Another {{method of}} {{spoofing}} {{is that of}} emulating the Bell 202 FSK signal. This method, informally called orange boxing, uses software that generates the audio signal which is then coupled to the telephone line during the call. The object is to deceive the called party into thinking {{that there is an}} incoming call waiting call from the spoofed number, when in fact there is no new incoming call. This technique often also involves an accomplice who may provide a <b>secondary</b> <b>voice</b> to complete the illusion of a call-waiting call. Because the orange box cannot truly spoof an incoming caller ID prior to answering and relies to a certain extent on the guile of the caller, it is considered as much a social engineering technique as a technical hack.|$|R

Rockwell Intl purchased Wescom in 1980 solving Wescom's cash problems and embarking the company onto the common carrier market, creating the SCX product line. SCX provided the early backbone for the early MCI network after the break-up of AT&T.

No prior scheduling of resources is required and there is no central point of control, thereby providing the user with the spontaneity desired in audio conference control...|$|R

50|$|Design of {{infinity}} transmitters has varied, according to developments in telephone systems. In some instances, the bug is activated after the target answers and hangs up their phone. In countries {{where there is}} a delay between connection and the first ring, the bug can be activated before the target phone rings, so that the infinity transmitter essentially 'answers' the call. In more advanced systems, the transmitter can be placed in a parallel telephone line to prevent the victim's phone line remaining engaged.As modern telephone lines no longer establish a <b>voice</b> <b>path</b> until the call is answered a variant of this now exists that uses CND, or caller ID.Usually an unusual sequence of non printing characters is used and thus will not show up on a display device.Sometimes the caller ID device itself has the bug but it can be nearly anywhere.In much the same manner a cellphone can be configured for silence on ring and auto answer and hidden, frequently placed inside something that has power available to maintain the battery.This allows the infinity transmitter to be hidden inside an automobile or other location where a land line is not an option.|$|R
