25|$|After commencing her 11th patrol upon departing Majuro Atoll on 15 July 1944, Tuna {{roamed the}} sea lanes of the Japanese home islands, off Shikoku and Kyūshū. Her radar picked up tempting targets, but bad luck {{continued}} to dog the ship's {{efforts to make}} contact and launch attacks. On occasion, the superior <b>surface</b> <b>speed</b> of the hunted enabled it to easily outrun the hunter, and good antisubmarine measures by the Japanese escort ships forced Tuna to proceed cautiously.

Triton generated [...] on sea trials, reaching her design <b>surface</b> <b>speed</b> of , and achieved a <b>surface</b> <b>speed</b> well in excess of [...] [...] Triton subsequently executed a four-hour, full-power submerged run and a crash-back maneuver. [...] The only significant problem encountered during her initial sea trials was the overheating of the lubricating oil system for the starboard propshaft spring bearing.

The Austro-Hungarian Navy selected the Germaniawerft 506d design, also known as the Type UD, for the U-7 class over the Type 48 design submitted by Whitehead & Co., primarily because of the lower cost. The Navy ordered five boats on 1 February 1913.|$|E
