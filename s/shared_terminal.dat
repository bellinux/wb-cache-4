40|$|Nowadays, bus lines {{commonly}} <b>share</b> <b>terminals,</b> {{especially in}} urban areas, because an independent operation of each line {{would cause a}} large waste of resources. In addition, if lines <b>share</b> <b>terminal</b> all lines can be monitored by unified management, while the vehicles of different sizes can complement each other. Although the dispatcher generally sets up fixed departure intervals for bus lines, {{there are differences between}} bus lines in terms of operating time distribution and line volume. Thus, a new optimization model for multi-vehicle-type structure in urban bus system is proposed in this paper. The optimization was conducted according to two main characteristics of bus systems, bus company expense and bus service quality. The optimization model was designed based on minimal possible expense and maximal possible quality. At the same time, we proposed a Markov method based on alternative relations to solve the model. The proposed model was verified by real urban bus system. Moreover, the simulations in MATLAB software environment have proven a high efficiency and applicability of the proposed method...|$|R

40|$|The {{etiology}} of autoimmunity in humans remains poorly defined, and animal models provide {{a unique opportunity}} to study potential autoimmune mechanisms. A novel model of autoimmune inflammatory arthritis results from a point mutation in the ζ-associated–protein of 70 kDa (ZAP- 70), which causes abnormal thymic T cell selection and survival of autoreactive clones. Although the resulting clinical and pathologic abnormalities are clearly T cell–dependent, macrophage and fibroblast cytokines such as IL- 1 and TNF-α are required for full expression of the disease. The studies of Hata et al. raise the intriguing possibility that traditional proinflammatory cytokine networks represent common effector mechanisms in inflammatory joint diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Hence, effective therapeutic interventions can target either unique etiologic pathways related to adaptive immune responses or <b>shared</b> <b>terminal</b> mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} whether antibodies to acidic glycolipids of nervous tissue {{are present in}} patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), sera from patients with GBS and appropriate control subjects were tested by a thin-layer chromatogram overlay technique. Chromatograms on which the whole ganglioside fractions from peripheral nerve and brain had been separated were overlaid with appropriate dilutions of the patients' sera (1 : 100 or greater), and antibody binding was revealed with a radiolabeled or peroxidase-labeled second antibody. Antibodies to ganglioside antigens were detected in 5 of 26 patients with GBS. IgG antibodies in 1 patient reacted strongly with LM 1 (sialosyl paragloboside), the major ganglioside of human peripheral nervous system myelin, and its hexaose analog (sialosyl lactosaminyl paragloboside), a minor ganglioside of human peripheral nervous system myelin. The antibody titer in this patient fell 8 -fold over 6 weeks coincident with clinical improvement. IgG from 2 other patients with GBS reacted with GD 1 b ganglioside, and the antibody titers in these patients also decreased substantially with clinical improvement. IgM antibodies in the sera from 2 other patients reacted with GD 1 a and GT 1 b gangliosides, which have a <b>shared</b> <b>terminal</b> carbohydrate sequence. Antibodies to gangliosides were not detected in the sera from 19 patients with other neurological diseases or from 10 normal subjects, and {{the frequency with which}} antiganglioside antibodies occurred in the patients with GBS was significantly greater than that in the combined control subjects (p less than 0. 01).

40|$|Welcome to {{this special}} issue of Journal of Networks (JNW) on “Performance Evaluation of Communication Networks. ” The papers {{included}} in this special issue are based mainly on selected extended versions of best papers accepted in the 2008 International Conference on E-Business and Telecommunication, ICETE 2008. This means that these accepted papers have undergone a thorough and a critical review process by experts in the field. Xiong and Thuente proposed novel schemes for secure dynamic localization in sensor networks. These proposed schemes can tolerate up to 50 % of beacon nodes being malicious, and they have linear computation time {{with respect to the}} number of reference nodes. The security analysis has shown that the schemes are applicable and resilient to attacks from adversaries. The authors further conducted simulations to analyze and compare the performance of these schemes, and to find out when each should be used. Lee, Narayan and Parampalli presented a provably secure efficient certificateless encryption scheme. The security of the method has been proven against adaptive-chosen ciphertext-attack in the random oracle model assuming k-BDHI holds. Moreover, the authors have shown that the proposed scheme is resistant to the malicious KGC attack. It was shown that the scheme is a god choice for key establishment in OLSR based MANET when coupled with Resurrecting Duckling idea. Pozo, Ceballos, and Gasca presented an analysis of the consistency diagnosis problem in firewall ACLs. Based on this analysis, the authors suggested to split the process in several parts that can be solved sequentially: inconsistency detection and isolation, inconsistent rules identification, and inconsistency characterization. The algorithms are considered the first ones which can solve the detection, isolation, and identification problems in quadratic time complexity, giving complete but not necessarily minimal results. In addition, the papers gave a theoretical complexity analysis as well as experimental results with real ACLs. Kuzuu, Hirano, Mase and Watanabe proposed the way to set up a roaming user profile without depending on Windows domain composition when building a <b>shared</b> <b>terminal</b> system for smart card users. This proposal aims at using a LDAP server as a data base of user information, and enabling each terminal user to construct his own work environment. In order to reach this aim, the authors related the user profile with the user ID extracted from smart card, and stored that profile on shared data storage. Moreover, they built a shared file system besides the data storage, and placed the user’s work space on that file system. In the actual proof experiments, applying the above system to the terminal on network, they confirmed that the user work environment was constructed on the <b>shared</b> <b>terminal</b> according to the smart card user. Finally, Vergara, Vázquez, Martin, Dubus and Lepareux proposed an approach to react to network attacks in which a set of alerts are used to automatically generate new security policies. For this, an ontology-based approach has been used, in which the alert and the policy information models can be combined to aid in the instantiation of the policies. The use of OWL and SWRL provides several advantages, including the availability of generic tools for parsing and reasoning. The nature of OWL as a Semantic Web component allows merging distributed ontologies. This approach has been validated in a VoIP use case scenario, defining as instances of the policy ontology the set of elements {{that are going to be}} used for the policy instantiation. We would like to thank all the authors and reviewers for their contributions and devoted efforts. A special thank goes the technical program committee of ICETE 2008 for their valuable time and superior work. Thanks are also due to the editors and editorial assistants for their fine support.

Taking a forward genetic approach, I analyzed three mutants that perturb connectivity: oak gall (okg), conjoined (cnj) and disjointed (dsj). The connectivity defects resulted from branching and invasion of WT stalk cells into mutant terminal cells. To determine the mechanisms that induce branching of WT stalk cells we mapped the mutations. We found that okg and cnj encode two vATPase subunits and dsj encodes an Archease. Terminal cells deficient for vATPase activity mis-localize apical proteins and stall apical membrane growth, which stimulates compensatory stalk cell hypertrophy and branching. While dsj, okg and cnj terminal cells <b>shared</b> <b>terminal</b> cell pruning defects were genetically downstream of the Target of Rapamycin (Tor) pathway, the compensatory branching of WT stalk cells adjacent to dsj terminal cell was independent of apical polarity. Additionally, we found that terminal cell injury induced adjacent stalk cell compensatory branching and stalk cells next to injured and genetically compromised terminal cells activate Jun Kinase and endoreplicate during invasion. Finally, inactivation of the Hippo growth pathway in stalk cells is sufficient to induce hypertrophy and branching. We conclude that genetically compromised or injured terminal cells activate hypertrophy and branching in a neighboring stalk cell. ...|$|E
