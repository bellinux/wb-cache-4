5|$|Interest rate parity {{rests on}} certain assumptions, the first being that capital is mobile - investors can readily {{exchange}} domestic assets for foreign assets. The second {{assumption is that}} assets have perfect <b>substitutability,</b> following from their similarities in riskiness and liquidity. Given capital mobility and perfect <b>substitutability,</b> investors {{would be expected to}} hold those assets offering greater returns, be they domestic or foreign assets. However, both domestic and foreign assets are held by investors. Therefore, it must be true that no difference can exist between the returns on domestic assets and the returns on foreign assets. That {{is not to say that}} domestic investors and foreign investors will earn equivalent returns, but that a single investor on any given side would expect to earn equivalent returns from either investment decision.|$|E
5|$|Interest rate parity is a no-arbitrage {{condition}} representing an {{equilibrium state}} under which investors will be indifferent to interest rates available on bank deposits in two countries. The {{fact that this}} condition does not always hold allows for potential opportunities to earn riskless profits from covered interest arbitrage. Two assumptions central to interest rate parity are capital mobility and perfect <b>substitutability</b> of domestic and foreign assets. Given foreign exchange market equilibrium, the interest rate parity condition implies that the expected return on domestic assets will equal the exchange rate-adjusted expected return on foreign currency assets. Investors then cannot earn arbitrage profits by borrowing {{in a country with}} a lower interest rate, exchanging for foreign currency, and investing in a foreign country with a higher interest rate, due to gains or losses from exchanging back to their domestic currency at maturity. Interest rate parity takes on two distinctive forms: uncovered interest rate parity refers to the parity condition in which exposure to foreign exchange risk (unanticipated changes in exchange rates) is uninhibited, whereas covered interest rate parity refers to the condition in which a forward contract has been used to cover (eliminate exposure to) exchange rate risk. Each form of the parity condition demonstrates a unique relationship with implications for the forecasting of future exchange rates: the forward exchange rate and the future spot exchange rate.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a financial contracting setting {{to explore the}} effects of strategic <b>substitutabilities</b> in venture capital financing. Strategic <b>substitutabilities</b> between a VC’s portfolio firms may induce a VC to provide soft entrepreneurial incentive schemes in order to limit cannibalization.

Strategic <b>substitutabilities</b> can thus be employed to incentivize entrepreneurs to perform (and compete) more aggressively.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the effects of}} strategic <b>substitutabilities</b> on performance and incentives in venture capital financing. The analysis points to a subtle link between two pivotal roles of venture capitalists: (i) monitoring ventures and setting performance incentives, and (ii) coordinating and shaping the product market strategies of ventures operating in similar product spaces. When strategic <b>substitutabilities</b> are strong, the VC’s role is to soften potentially too aggressive product market strategies. In contrast, small strategic <b>substitutabilities</b> can lead to more aggressive performance incentives. This is because they enhance the VC’s commitment to weed out losers, which strengthens entrepreneurial incentives and results in overall efficiency gains.

25|$|The main {{defensive}} {{response of}} the Dutch economy was in capital investment. The enormous capital stock amassed during the Golden Age was redirected away from investment in commerce, agricultural land (where rents went down appreciably {{in a short period}} of time), and real estate (house rents also sharply declined), and instead in the direction of other, rather high-risk investments. One of these was the whaling industry in which the Noordsche Compagnie had held a Dutch monopoly in the first half of the century. After its charter expired other companies entered this market, leading to an expansion of the Dutch whaling fleet from about 75 ships to 200 ships after 1660. The results were disappointing, however, due to overfishing, a high price elasticity of demand due to <b>substitutability</b> of vegetable oils for whale oil, and the competition of foreign whalers.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{contrasts}} {{the views}} of expectational coordination in a stylised economic model under two polar assumptions: Strategic Complementarities (StCo) dominate or on the contrary are dominated by Strategic <b>Substitutabilities</b> (StSu). Although in the StCo case, "uniqueness" often "buys" "eductive stability", the two issues are strikingly different in the second case. Furthermore if, in the first case, incomplete information often improves "expectational coordination", it may have the converse effect in the StSu case. It is finally argued that, in macroeconomic contexts, StSu often unambiguously dominate StCo, even in a large class of models with Keynesian features, and even in an aggregate framework that magnifies the StCo effects. The "remains" of StCo in general cases are discussed. Strategic Complementarities (StCo); Strategic <b>Substitutabilities</b> (StSu) ...|$|R

However, {{the extent to which}} technology producers can shift from more expensive to cheaper inputs, or modify technology toward the use of cheaper complement goods is bound by technical constraints. Such constraints emerge because inputs are characterized by low <b>substitutability</b> due to the physical and chemical limits involved in the production process. Consequently, the upstream incentives given by market signals affect only the rate of use of certain inputs as well as the rate of development of a trajectory but not the direction of technical change, which is bound by the technical constraints of production.|$|E

2500|$|In addition, Georgescu {{finds that}} neoclassical {{economics}} tends to overlook, or, at best, to misrepresent {{the problem of}} how to allocate the exhaustible mineral resources between present and future generations. Georgescu points out that the market mechanisms of supply and demand are systematically unable to work out the intergenerational allocation problem in a satisfactory way, since future generations are not, and cannot be, present on today's market. This anomaly of the market mechanisms — or ecological market failure — is described by Georgescu as 'a dictatorship of the present over the future'. [...] On this issue, notable economists and Nobel Prize laureates Robert Solow and Joseph Stiglitz, Georgescu's two main adversaries in academia in the 1970s, have stated their account of the mainstream neoclassical approach to the economics of exhaustible resources: They both claim that across the board <b>substitutability</b> of man-made capital for natural capital constitutes a real possibility. Hence, any concern with intergenerational allocation of the mineral stock should be relaxed somewhat (according to Solow); or even ignored altogether (according to Stiglitz).|$|E
40|$|Answers {{to various}} {{questions}} of applied macroeconomics {{depend on the}} values given toelasticities of substitution between the demands for factors, these demands being aggregatedacross productive sectors. Such elasticities reflect not only <b>substitutabilities</b> within productiveprocesses, but also <b>substitutabilities</b> in the system of demand functions for goods. The lattersubstitutabilities show how demand for goods react to changes in relative prices of goods,which are themselves induced by changes in factor prices. A fairly general model leads to arelationship directly linking changes in factor prices {{to changes in the}} aggregate demands forthese factors. The relation is applied to particular specifications : first, to a simple CESeconomy and, second, to a nested-CES economy with three factors, a case which points todifficulties for the establishment of general transparent properties.

40|$|The {{prevailing}} view of {{the economic}} consequences of financing government deficits, {{as reflected in the}} recent economics literature and in recent public policy debates, reflects serious misunderstandings. Debt-financed deficits need not "crowd out" any private investment, and may even "crowd in" some. Using a model including three assets - money, government bonds, and real capital - the analysis in this paper shows that the direction of the portfolio effect of bond issuing on private investment depends on the relative <b>substitutabilities</b> among these three assets in the public's aggregate portfolio. Since the all-important <b>substitutabilities</b> that make the difference between "crowding out" and "crowding in" are determined in part by the government's choice of debt instrument for financing the deficit, this analysis points to the potential importance of a policy tool that public policy discussion has largely neglected for over a decade - debt management policy. When monetary policy is non-accommodative, within limits debt management policy can take its place in augmenting the potency of fiscal policy, or in improving the trade-off between short-run stimulation and investment for long-run growth. ...|$|R

50|$|<b>Substitutability</b> and recombinability {{are closely}} related constructs. The former refers {{to the ability to}} {{substitute}} one component for another as in John Blair’s “systemic equivalence” while the latter may refer both to the indeterminate form of the system and the indeterminate use of the component. In college curricula, for example, each course is designed with a credit system that ensures a uniform number of contact hours, and approximately uniform educational content, yielding <b>substitutability.</b> By virtue of their <b>substitutability,</b> each student may create their own curricula (recombinability of the curriculum as a system) and each course may be said to be recombinable with a variety of students’ curricula (recombinability of the component within multiple systems). Both <b>substitutability</b> and recombinability are immediately recognizable in Blair’s social processes and artifacts, and are also well captured in Garud and Kumaraswamy's discussion of economies of substitution in technological systems.|$|E

40|$|How the {{financing}} of government budget deficits affects the structure of expected asset returns depends on assets' relative <b>substitutabilities</b> in investors' aggregate portfolio, and these <b>substitutabilities</b> in turn depend on how investors perceive {{the risks associated with}} the respective assets' returns. The empirical results reported in this paper, based on three different ways of representing investors' risk perceptions, consistently indicate that government deficit financing raises expected debt returns relative to expectedequity returns, regardless of the maturity of the government's financing. More specifically, financing government deficits by issuing short-term debt lowers the return on long-term debt, and lowers the return on equity by even more, relative to the return on short-term debt. Financing deficits by issuing long-term debt raises the return on long-term debt, but lowers the return on equity, again in comparison to the return on short-term debt. The indicated magnitudes of these effects differ according to the method used to represent investors' risk perceptions, but the qualitative results are consistent throughout. Moreover, many of the indicated magnitudes are large enough to matter economically. These results imply that continuing large government deficits at full employment lead to market incentives for individual business corporations to emphasize reliance on equity (including retentions), and reduce reliance on debt, in comparison with the composition of corporate financing that would prevail {{in the absence of the}} need to finance the government budget deficit. ...|$|R

50|$|The long-run price {{elasticity}} of supply is quite high. George Fallis (1985) estimates it as 8.2, but in the short run, supply tends to be very price inelastic. Supply {{price elasticity}} depends on the elasticity of substitution and supply restrictions. There is significant <b>substitutability,</b> both between land and materials and between labour and materials. In high-value locations, multi-story concrete buildings are typically built {{to reduce the amount}} of expensive land used. As labour costs have increased since the 1950s, new materials and capital-intensive techniques have been employed {{to reduce the amount of}} labour used. However, supply restrictions can significantly affect <b>substitutability.</b> In particular, the lack of supply of skilled labour (and labour union requirements) can constrain the substitution from capital to labour. Land availability can also constrain <b>substitutability</b> if the area of interest is delineated (i.e., the larger the area, the more suppliers of land, and the more substitution that is possible).

40|$|We {{consider}} an economic model that features : 1. {{a continuum of}} agents 2. an aggregate {{state of the world}} over which agents have an infinitesimal influence. We first review the connections between the eductive viewpoint that puts emphasis for example on strongly rational expectations equilibrium and the standard game-theoretical rationalizability concepts. Besides the Cobweb tâtonnement outcomes, which mimic an eductive reasoning subject to homogenous expectations, we define, characterize (and prove the convexity of) the sets of rationalizable states and point-rationalizable states, which respectively incorporate heterogenous point-expectations and heterogenous stochastic expectations. In the case where our model displays strategic complementarities, we find unsurprisingly that all the eductive criteria under scrutiny support rather similar conclusions, particularly when the equilibrium is unique. With strategic susbstitutabilities, the success of expectational coordination, in the case where a unique equilibrium does exists, relates with the absence of cycles of order 2 of the Cobweb mapping : in this case, again, heterogenity of expectations does not matter. However, when cycles of order 2 do exist, our different criteria predict different set of outcomes, although all are tied with cycles of order 2. Under differentiability assumptions, the Poincaré-Hopf method leads to global results for strong rationality of equilibrium. At the local level, the different criteria under scrutiny can be adapted to the analysis of expectational coordination. They leads to the same stabilty conclusions, only when there are local strategic complementarities or strategic <b>substitutabilities.</b> However, so far as the analysis of local expectational coordination is concerned, it is argued and shown that the stochastic character of expectations can most often be forgotten. expectational coordination; rational expectations; iterative expectational stability; eductive stability; strong rationality; strategic complementarities; strategic <b>substitutabilities...</b>|$|R
