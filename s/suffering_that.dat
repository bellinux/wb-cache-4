5|$|Fei {{sets out}} to destroy Deus and free the Wave Existence and Elly. In Merkaba, the party defeats Deus, but they realize that the energy {{released}} from the Wave Existence's shift will destroy the planet. Elly, inside Deus, tries to move {{it away from the}} planet and Fei, in his Xenogears, follows to save her, but both disappear in the rift. Krelian confronts them, telling Fei he only sought to end the pain and <b>suffering</b> <b>that</b> comes with human existence by reverting everything back to when it all began, when all was one, to ascend to the realm of God. Fei rejects Krelian's ideology with his love for Elly, but Krelian challenges Fei, telling him to prove this love that could make him independent of God, and calls forth Urobolus, a gigantic serpent-like incarnation of Miang. Xenogears appears and Fei uses it to defeat Urobolus. Krelian releases Elly and reveals to Fei that he had planned to become one with God along with Elly. During her time with Krelian, Elly had seen inside his heart and realized it was full of sadness and despair for all the atrocities he had committed. Despite everything, Elly says that Krelian truly loved people more than anyone else. Because no one will forgive his sins, he declines Fei's offer to return and ascends to a higher plain of existence along with the Wave Existence, telling Fei and Elly that he envies them. Fei and Elly then return to their planet along with Xenogears and reunite {{with the rest of the}} party.|$|E

25|$|The last {{objection}} that {{he makes}} draws on the widely discussed problem of evil. He argues that all the daily unnecessary <b>suffering</b> <b>that</b> goes on everywhere within the world is yet another factor that pulls away from the idea that God is an 'omnipotent' 'benevolent' being.|$|E
25|$|Compromises in {{countries}} with animal cruelty laws that prohibit such practices involve stunning the animal to lessen the <b>suffering</b> <b>that</b> occurs while the animal bleeds to death. However, the use of electric shocks to daze the animal is often not accepted by some markets as producing meat which is kosher.|$|E

25|$|Other {{subjects}} {{that have become}} central to the medical anthropology worldwide are violence and social suffering {{as well as other}} issues that involve physical and psychological harm and <b>suffering</b> <b>that</b> are not a result of illness.

25|$|Doehring {{was known}} {{to the general public}} thanks to an open-air church service he gave to an {{audience}} {{of tens of thousands of}} believers on the steps of the Reichstag building on August 2, 1914, at the outbreak of the First World War. His sermon was a call to stand firmly and fearlessly together under the leadership of the Kaiser, with loyalty and with faith in God, through all the <b>suffering</b> <b>that</b> was to come. It was widely reprinted.|$|E
25|$|The {{state of}} nirvana is also {{described}} in Buddhism as cessation of all afflictions, cessation of all actions, cessation of rebirths and <b>suffering</b> <b>that</b> are {{a consequence of}} afflictions and actions. Liberation is described as identical to anatta (anatman, non-self, lack of any self). In Buddhism, liberation is achieved when all things and beings are understood to be with no Self. Nirvana is also described as identical to achieving sunyata (emptiness), {{where there is no}} essence or fundamental nature in anything, and everything is empty.|$|E

5000|$|Dukkha (Sanskrit duhkha) means [...] "unsatisfactoriness, suffering, pain".

50|$|Regulation 27C {{ordered that}} no {{pamphlet}} or similar publication {{dealing with the}} war or the making of peace should be issued without being first passed by the Censor.

25|$|Claude Malhuret {{was elected}} {{as the new}} {{president}} of Medicins Sans Frontieres in 1977, and soon after debates began over the future of the organisation. In particular, the concept of témoignage ("witnessing"), which refers to speaking out about the <b>suffering</b> <b>that</b> one sees as opposed to remaining silent, was being opposed or played down by Malhuret and his supporters. Malhuret thought MSF should avoid criticism of the governments of countries in which they were working, while Kouchner believed that documenting and broadcasting the suffering in a country was {{the most effective way to}} solve a problem.|$|E
25|$|In classic Greek mythology, below Heaven, Earth, and Pontus is Tartarus, or Tartaros (Greek Τάρταρος, deep place). It {{is either}} a deep, gloomy place, a pit or abyss used as a dungeon of torment and <b>suffering</b> <b>that</b> resides within Hades (the entire underworld) with Tartarus being the hellish component. In the Gorgias, Plato (c. 400 BC) wrote that souls were judged after death and those who {{received}} punishment were sent to Tartarus. As a place of punishment, it {{can be considered a}} hell. The classic Hades, on the other hand, is more similar to Old Testament Sheol.|$|E

5000|$|Ariyaratne reinterprets the Four Noble Truths. The First Noble Truth is <b>suffering</b> {{which means}} <b>that</b> {{one needs to}} {{recognise}} <b>that</b> <b>suffering</b> occurs throughout the world. The Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement reinterprets this to mean that [...] "villagers should recognize problems such as poverty, disease, oppression, and disunity in their environment." [...] Ariyaratne argues that these things are types of <b>sufferings</b> <b>that</b> occur throughout Sri Lanka {{and the rest of}} the world. It is important for all people to recognise <b>that</b> these <b>sufferings</b> exist and they should be addressed by those who have the ability to help with the suffering on both an individual level as well as with the community as a whole.|$|R
5000|$|... `Abdu'l-Bahá {{writes about}} {{the virtues of the}} Covenant {{established}} by Bahá'u'lláh, and writes about its power.

5000|$|In one {{particular}} moment, the performer takes {{the role of}} an Israeli doctor commenting on the various <b>sufferings</b> <b>that</b> the character has witnessed.

Trauma is trauma." ...|$|R
25|$|Lord Lowborough, {{a friend}} of Huntingdon's and Anabella's husband, is apathetic but devoted. Melancholic, dour and gloomy, he is in {{complete}} contrast to Huntingdon. He used to gamble and drink too much alcohol and developed an addiction to opium, but after his financial ruin gradually reforms himself. Lowborough truly loves Annabella, and her infidelity brings him such <b>suffering</b> <b>that</b> only his Christian faith and strong will keep him from suicide. Later he divorces her and after some time marries a plain middle-aged woman, who makes a good wife to him and a stepmother to his children with Annabella — {{a son and a}} nominal daughter. Lord Lowborough also has some resemblances to Branwell, such as a life of debauchery, periods of remorse/religious torments, and opium, as well as moral weakness.|$|E
25|$|At {{the first}} {{hearings}} of the Seventh, most listeners wept. This was true even when Shostakovich played the {{piece on the}} piano for friends. The requiem pages of the first movement made a special impression, much as the Largo of his Fifth Symphony had done. Some scholars believe that, {{as he had done}} in the Fifth, Shostakovich gave his audience a chance to express thoughts and <b>suffering</b> <b>that,</b> {{in the context of the}} Great Purges, had remained hidden and accumulated over many years. Because these previously hidden emotions were expressed with such power and passion, the Seventh became a major public event. Alexei Tolstoy, who played a pivotal role in the life of the Fifth Symphony, was the first to note the significance of the spontaneous reaction to the Seventh. After hearing an orchestral rehearsal of it, Tolstoy wrote a highly positive review of the work for Pravda.|$|E
25|$|A {{panel of}} The Heart Rhythm Society, a {{specialist}} {{organization based in}} Washington, DC {{found that it was}} legal and ethical to honor requests by patients, or by those with legal authority to make decisions for patients, to deactivate implanted cardiac devices. Lawyers say that the legal situation is similar to removing a feeding tube, though there is currently no legal precedent involving pacemakers in the United States of America. A patient in the United States is thought to have a right to refuse or discontinue treatment, including a pacemaker that keeps him or her alive. Physicians have a right to refuse to turn it off, but are advised by the HRS panel that they should refer the patient to a physician who will. Some patients believe that hopeless, debilitating conditions, like those brought on by severe strokes or late-stage dementia, can cause so much <b>suffering</b> <b>that</b> they would prefer not to prolong their lives with supportive measures, such as cardiac devices.|$|E

6000|$|Mary was not listening. [...] "The difficulty," [...] she said, [...] "makes itself acutely felt {{in matters}} of sex. If one {{individual}} seeks intimate contact with another individual in the natural way, she is certain to receive or inflict suffering. If on the other hand, she avoids contacts, she risks the equally grave <b>sufferings</b> <b>that</b> follow on unnatural repressions. As you see, it's a dilemma." ...|$|R

25|$|It {{was late}} winter and snow still {{fell in the}} region. Without even enough {{blankets}} to keep their sick and wounded warm, the bedraggled Confederates who returned to Santa Fe must have made a pitiable sight. Louisa went to visit their wounded and was so moved by their <b>suffering</b> <b>that</b> she revealed hidden stores of blankets and turned her home into a field hospital; she personally led a hastily organized company of nurses {{to care for the}} sick and dying men and made trips to outlying encampments to bring her patients into Santa Fe or, failing that, to treat in situ those soldiers who could not be brought into the city. It was not until April 1 or 2 that General Sibley, who had been at Albuquerque most of this time, arrived at Santa Fe and personally met with Louisa. It is not known what transpired between them, but it can be presumed that he thanked her for caring for his men and reminisced about their earlier encounters when he and her husband had been on the same side.|$|E
500|$|The National Weather Service {{bulletin}} for the New Orleans {{region of}} 10:11a.m., August 28, 2005 {{was a particularly}} dire warning issued by the local Weather Forecast Office in Slidell, Louisiana, warning of the devastation that of Hurricane Katrina could wreak upon the Gulf Coast of the United States, and the torrent of pain, misery and <b>suffering</b> <b>that</b> would follow once the storm left the area.|$|E
