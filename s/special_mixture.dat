In the past, before the availability of standardized wax sheets made specifically for foundry use, the molds were made out of either beeswax (talo) or candle wax (kandilà). The wax mold is covered with a <b>special</b> <b>mixture</b> of finely powdered coal/mud, which is applied on the wax surface using a brush.|$|E
2500|$|Silk strings {{are made}} by {{gathering}} a prescribed number of strands of silk thread, then twisting them tightly together. The twisted cord of strings is then wrapped around a frame and immersed in a vat of liquid composed of a <b>special</b> <b>mixture</b> of natural glue that binds the strands together. The strings is taken out and left to dry, before being cut into the appropriate length. The top thicker strings (i.e. strings one to four) are further wrapped in a thin silk thread, coiled around the core to make it smoother. According to ancient manuals, there are three distinctive gauges of thickness that one can make the strings. The first is taigu [...] which is the standard gauge, the zhongqing [...] is thinner, whilst the jiazhong [...] is thicker. According to the Yugu Zhai Qinpu, zhongqing is the best. The currently used silk string gauge standard was defined by Suzhou silk string maker Pan Guohui (潘國輝).|$|E

50|$|In pyrotechnics, {{it is used}} as fuel to make <b>special</b> <b>mixtures,</b> e.g. for {{production}} of smokes, in flash compositions, and in percussion caps. Specification for pyrotechnic calcium silicide is MIL-C-324C. In some mixtures it may be substituted with ferrosilicon. Silicon-based fuels are used in some time delay mixtures, e.g. for controlling of explosive bolts, hand grenades, and infrared decoys. Smoke compositions often contain hexachloroethane; during burning they produce silicon tetrachloride, which, like titanium tetrachloride used in smoke-screens, reacts with air moisture and produces dense white fog. Gum arabic is used in some mixtures to inhibit calcium silicide decomposition.|$|R

40|$|In a {{microgravity}} environment, {{molecular diffusion}} {{is the primary}} mechanism by which fuel and oxidizer that are initially separated are brought together to the reaction zone. Combustion systems in microgravity are therefore primed to diffusive-thermal instabilities. One such instability appears {{in the form of}} spontaneous oscillations. Oscillations were observed in condensed-phase fuels and gas-jet diffusion flames, and in microgravity jet-flames, candle flames and spherical flames surrounding large fiber-supported fuel droplets. The nature of oscillations is quite different in each of these cases: the droplet flame exhibits radial oscillations, the edge of the candle flame is seen to move back and forth along the hemispherical flame surface and the jet-flame oscillations are primarily up and down along the axis. Despite these differences, associated mainly with the mode of oscillation, one may identify some common factors: in all cases the flame exhibits low-frequency oscillations, oscillations are only observed in <b>special</b> <b>mixtures</b> and their onset occur only at near-extinction conditions...|$|R

40|$|In {{my thesis}} I {{will try to}} analyze the two shows from a {{perspective}} that presents the new additional elements and innovations that The Cosby Show and Married…With Children brought {{into the world of}} sitcoms.

They are both <b>special</b> <b>mixtures</b> of these previous innovations, previously used elements and the really new, fresh ideas and individual kind of humor. This individual style and humor comes from the creators of the shows and the actors/artists featured in the shows. The creators of Married…With Children, Ron Leavitt and Michael G. Moye did something absolutely brave. They dared {{to come up with a}} politically incorrect, saucy, scornful and critical sitcom in the program of a brand new broadcasting company called Fox.

40|$|Magnetorheological {{suspensions}} {{with different}} particle sizes including bimodal particle size distributions have been rheologically investigated. The results show a continuous {{decrease in the}} base viscosity without magnetic field when increasing the ratio of coarse to fine particles, which is {{in accordance with the}} observed trend of sedimentation stability of the samples. However, measurements of the shear stress with a rising magnetic flux density demonstrate higher values for MR suspensions with <b>special</b> <b>mixtures</b> of coarse and fine particles indicating a strengthening of the particle interactions in the magnetic field. The change of the viscoelastic properties of the MR suspensions in dependence on the field strength and shear load (amplitude) have been studied with oscillatory experiments. As expected, at low field strengths, the viscous behavior dominates and, at high field strengths, the elastic behavior, but differences in the crossover field strengths between the two regimes occur for the different particle size distributions. The shear load variation also shows differences between the various MR suspensions indicating the highest yield stress for the sample with only fine particles without magnetic field, but the lowest yield stress at moderate field strengths...|$|R

50|$|A <b>special</b> <b>mixture</b> of quark {{flavours}} is an eigenstate of {{the weak}} interaction part of the Hamiltonian, so will interact in a particularly simple way with the W bosons. (Charged weak interactions violate flavor). On the other hand, a fermion of a fixed mass (an eigenstate of the kinetic and strong interaction parts of the Hamiltonian) is an eigenstate of flavour. The transformation from the former basis to the flavor-eigenstate/mass-eigenstate basis for quarks underlies the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix (CKM matrix). This matrix {{is analogous to the}} PMNS matrix for neutrinos, and quantifies flavour changes under charged weak interactions of quarks.|$|E
