2500|$|As {{a result}} of winning a Student Academy Award at USC for his film, A Field of Honor, Zemeckis came to the {{attention}} of Steven Spielberg. Spielberg said, [...] "He barged right past my secretary and <b>sat</b> <b>me</b> <b>down</b> and showed me this student film...and I thought it was spectacular, with police cars and a riot, all dubbed to Elmer Bernstein's score for The Great Escape." [...] Spielberg became Zemeckis's mentor and executive produced his first two films, both of which Zemeckis co-wrote with Gale. He later executive produced other Zemeckis films, including the Back to the Future trilogy and Who Framed Roger Rabbit.|$|E
2500|$|Jordison {{was born}} at Mercy Hospital in Des Moines, Iowa on April 26, 1975 to Steve and Jackie Jordison. He is the oldest and only boy of 3 children. He {{grew up in a}} rural area outside of Waukee where he used to play {{basketball}} on {{the street in front of}} his house. He embraced music at an early age, which he attributes to his parents' influence: [...] "They always <b>sat</b> <b>me</b> <b>down</b> in front of the radio, rather than the TV." [...] He played guitar until receiving his first drum kit as a gift from his parents at age eight, and started his first band while in elementary school.|$|E
2500|$|Popović self-identified as a Yugoslav from {{an early}} age: [...] "During World War II, my parents sent me away to a village near Mladenovac to stay with their friends {{because there was no}} {{electricity}} and running water in Belgrade. One night we huddled around a burning stove when a group of Chetniks barged in. One of them I guess had kids of his own so he <b>sat</b> <b>me</b> <b>down</b> on his lap and asked me if I'm a Serb. I answered 'no, I'm a Yugoslav'. I've always been a Yugoslav. First things I learned in life were my own name, the name of the street I live in, and that I'm a Yugoslav".|$|E

2500|$|In 2001, {{executive}} producer John Yorke decided to reintroduce the character once again. The {{decision was made}} to recast the role to another actress, Kim Medcalf, as Danniella Westbrook was still overcoming her drug problems at this time. During the audition process, EastEnders have said that they had to keep the part they were casting for [...] "top secret", meaning auditionees were not told about the part they were auditioning for until their actual interview. In the documentary, EastEnders Revealed - A Year In The Life Of Sam Mitchell, Medcalf has explained the audition process: [...] "They kind of <b>sat</b> <b>me</b> <b>down</b> and said 'actually we haven't been 100% truthful here, this [...] is not for...a new character at all, it's for the part of Sam Mitchell. Do you know who she is?' and I said, 'yes of course I do!' [...] Because my attitude was so laid back, it helped me a lot." [...] Producer Paul Annett has revealed: [...] "I saw Kim Medcalf along with two other actresses that had been short-listed, and I think almost immediately I knew that she was the right one." [...] Medcalf was an inexperienced actress, and her casting {{has been described as a}} [...] "big risk" [...] because of this. Annett has commented, [...] "she'd done...no television, secondly, she was coming into an immensely popular and beloved show, and the third thing was that she was taking over a role played by Danniella Westbrook...for [...]" [...] Medcalf revealed that she had reservations about taking on a role that was associated with another actress: [...] "I said 'that's going to be hard' [...] but they said 'we think we can do it, we're going to write it in quite cleverly, and part of it will be that we meet Sam away from Walford'." [...] She added, [...] "It was scary finding out I'd be taking over someone else's character because you wonder whether the public will accept it. I loved the show so I just decided to go for it". Commenting on Medcalf's casting, Sam's original actress Danniella Westbrook said, [...] "I wish her all the luck in the world. It's a great part and I'm sure she'll be great." ...|$|E
