5|$|Amaral {{was himself}} an arguido in {{relation}} to his investigation of another case, the disappearance of Joana Cipriano. One day after Madeleine's disappearance, Amaral was made arguido, and a month later {{he was charged with}} making a false statement. Four other officers were charged with assault. Eight-year-old Joana had vanished in 2004 from Figueira, seven miles (11km) from Praia da Luz. Her body was never found, and no murder weapon was identified. Her mother and the mother's brother were convicted of her murder after confessing, but the mother retracted her confession, <b>saying</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been beaten by police. Amaral was not present when the beating is alleged to have taken place, but he was accused of having covered up for others. The other detectives were acquitted. Amaral was convicted of perjury in May 2009 and received an 18-month suspended sentence.|$|E
5|$|Amid notable controversy, Sörenstam {{was invited}} {{to play in the}} PGA Tour's Bank of America Colonial golf tournament in Fort Worth, Texas, in May 2003, making her the first woman to play in a PGA Tour event since Babe Zaharias, who {{qualified}} for the 1945 Los Angeles Open. Vijay Singh, fourth in the world rankings at the time, was particularly critical of her presence; he was quoted <b>saying</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> no business playing and he hoped she missed the cut, although this statement was later proven to be misquoted and he later apologized. Cheered through each hole, she shot five over par, tying for 96th out of the 111 who finished the first two rounds, missing the cut. After shooting 1-over-par 71 in the first round, finishing in 73rd and on pace to challenge for a weekend spot, Sörenstam said she was nervous all day but pleased by her performance.|$|E

25|$|As {{to whether}} her {{comments}} about Waters {{had been as}} continuous and negative as Perkins-Graham and Ballew had asserted, Churchill testified {{that she had not}} had a problem with Waters and felt she could have a good working relationship with her.

25|$|On {{the night}} of 14 February 1876 a {{domestic}} servant Estelle Faguette lay in Pellevoisin dying of pulmonary tuberculosis, and reportedly saw the Virgin Mary. Four days later, during the fifth apparition, Estelle seemed to be healed instantaneously. Altogether she said she experienced fifteen apparitions {{in the course of}} 1876. On 9 September the apparition drew attention to a small piece of white cloth, a scapular resting over her chest. Faguette had seen it there before, as plain white cloth, but on this day it bore the red image of the Sacred Heart of Jesus.

She adds, however, that she would like to think Harry made Snape's true loyalty and heroism known in the Wizarding world, and that he lobbied to ensure that a portrait be installed in the office. In a separate interview, Rowling discussed Snape's back story, <b>saying</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> planned it ever since she wrote the first book because the whole series is built around it and she considers him {{one of the most important}} characters of the seventh book.|$|E
25|$|After the German reunification {{the united}} German {{government}} decided to merge the abortion laws. It would be legal {{within the first}} twelve weeks of pregnancy but only after the woman received counseling on her decision. If she still decided to proceed {{she would have to}} present a certificate <b>saying</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> completed the counseling sessions. The German Bishops' Conference established counseling centres that saw 20,000 women. After being counseled, roughly 5,000 decided not to have the abortion. In 1997 Pope John Paul II ordered the German bishops to withdraw the counseling support. Cardinal Ratzinger, as prefect of the Congregation for the Faith, was given the task of carrying out John Paul's instructions. In 1999 the German bishops unanimously rejected the demands of the CDF. Only in 2000 did the bishops conference end the counseling service, which was preventing 5,000 abortions a year.|$|E

25|$|Hannah Hanson {{was born}} in 1805 in Lisbon, Maine. At seventeen, she met Ward Witham, and {{they were married in}} January 1822, in Portland, Maine. After {{the first few months of}} their marriage, Hanson was accused by two neighbors, Mr. and Mrs. Weymouth, of {{stealing}} their personal items. Witham defended his wife at the time, but later suspected her in the theft when he came to believe that she had been involved in an extra-marital affair. In October 1822, Hanson and Witham moved out of the home they had shared with the Weymouth family. In July 1823, Kinney gave birth to her first child, a daughter. Witham came to suspect Kinney had been involved in an affair during the winter of 1824. In 1825, Hanson gave birth to her second child, a son. In the winter of 1825, Witham worked outside the home gathering lumber. He suspected his wife was involved in a second affair, this time with a young man. Rozilla Moody, a ward of the Witham family, signed an affidavit in 1826 <b>saying</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> witnessed another man in the Witham household during the previous winter.|$|E
25|$|Her {{place on}} the Kenyan world cross country team looked {{uncertain}} in 2009 as head coach Julius Kirwa dismissed her chances, <b>saying</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> run too many races that season. Cherono replied by taking the lead immediately at the Kenyan Trials and winning the junior race {{by a margin of}} thirteen seconds. At the 2009 World Cross Country Championships in Amman, Cherono engaged in a race-long duel with Genzebe Dibaba in the junior race. Cherono took the lead in the final stages but a difficult stretch with a 40-metre climb enabled Dibaba to overtake her and Cherono ended up with the silver medal. At the 2009 African Junior Athletics Championships, Cherono eased to the 3000m title by some 13 seconds but found herself beaten again by Genzebe Dibaba in 5000m race, finishing with the silver medal. She competed on the senior track circuit that year and was third at the Rieti IAAF Grand Prix, recording a personal best of 8:44.67 for the 3000m. She took third for a second time at the Memorial van Damme in September, recording personal bests in the 1500 metres and 2000 metres and beaten only by reigning world champions Gelete Burka and Vivian Cheruiyot.|$|E
