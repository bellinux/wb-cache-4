500|$|According to biographer Peter Manso, The Prisoner of Sex {{was written}} by Norman Mailer in {{response}} to Millett's Sexual Politics. [...] "The Prisoner of Sex is structured as a contest. His rhetoric against her prose, his charm against her earnestness, his polemic rage against her vitriolic charges. The aim is to convert the larger audience, the stronger presence as the sustaining truth. The Prisoner of Sex combines self parody and satire...", <b>said</b> <b>Andrew</b> Wilson, author of Norman Mailer: An American Aesthetic.|$|E
500|$|The {{people in}} the {{wardrobe}} are uncomfortable, not least because of John's odour. Geraldine passes around mints as Andrew tells Mark {{that he no longer}} has contact with Dicky Lawrence, a potential business contact of Mark's. Andrew sings the [...] "sardine song", but Carl angrily stops him. Andrew and Geraldine reminisce about a scout jamboree held in the house many years ago, but Geraldine remembers that a boy named Phillip Harrison, nicknamed [...] "Little Pip", <b>said</b> <b>Andrew</b> did [...] "terrible things", and that the police were involved. Carl says how Andrew paid Pip's family to move away, and Andrew counters by claiming he did nothing to Pip and was only teaching him how to wash himself. Carl implies that he and John were not as lucky as Pip, and John says he can smell carbolic soap. There is silence, and Stuart points out no one else is looking for them, but they realise Ian has not yet returned from the bathroom. Jeremy says Ian is the person he was going to pick up from the station, but when Mark claims Ian is already at the party, Jeremy reveals the person Mark is referring to is not Ian. Outside, [...] "Ian" [...] locks the wardrobe and sprays it with lighter fluid while singing the sardine song. Carl realises Ian is actually Phillip, and the episode ends with Phillip leaning against the wardrobe, a lighter in his hand.|$|E
500|$|While {{his group}} escapes from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, Jenner whispers to Rick about {{the virus that}} has caused the zombie apocalypse. Initially there was no {{indication}} as to what Jenner said to him; the dialogue was previously inserted into the episode's script but was later removed. [...] "I'm so pleased they didn't reveal it," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Andrew</b> Lincoln, [...] "because it was scripted, and extremely powerful, and I said to everyone, 'Burn this page: No one should know apart from Rick and Frank.' It's brilliant that they left it â€”it's perfect, it's so classy." [...] Kirkman was content with the idea of teasing Jenner's revelation in lieu of blatantly revealing anything about the origins of the virus. [...] "I {{thought it was a great}} addition. I'm very much opposed to showing what the actual cause [...] is and explaining how things work, but teasing a little bit is a great thing. If it adds an extra layer to the drama, then I'm all for it," [...] he stated. [...] "It also led up to the fantastic mystery of the whisper Jenner gives to Rick at the end of that scene. That's going to play into Season 2 quite a bit. I know where that's going and it's really a cool bit." [...] It is not until the second season finale, [...] "Beside the Dying Fire", that Rick reveals Jenner's message to the group.|$|E
6000|$|... "Faith, then," [...] <b>said</b> Sir <b>Andrew,</b> [...] "he {{will have}} many more {{opportunities}} of studying the shape of that small scarlet flower." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come {{back to the}} Island of Pines {{whenever}} you feel inclined," [...] he <b>said,</b> and <b>Andrew</b> and Geraldine {{walked down to the}} pier.|$|R
6000|$|... "Chauvelin {{knows of}} this inn, from the papers he stole," [...] <b>said</b> Sir <b>Andrew,</b> earnestly, [...] "and on landing will make {{straight}} for it." ...|$|R
2500|$|NYU {{has often}} been at odds with {{residents}} of both the East and West Villages due to its expansive development plans; urban preservationist Jane Jacobs battled the school in the 1960s. [...] "She spoke of how universities and hospitals often had {{a special kind of}} hubris reflected in the fact that they often thought it was OK to destroy a neighborhood to suit their needs", <b>said</b> <b>Andrew</b> Berman of the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation.|$|E
2500|$|He said in {{the first}} test the machine carried 220 pounds of sand ballast and flew to an {{altitude}} of 40 to 50 feet for 1/8 of a mile (...) [...] On the second test Whitehead said the machine flew a distance of 1/2 mile (...) for one and one-half minutes before crashing into a tree. The report <b>said</b> <b>Andrew</b> Cellie and Daniel Varovi were Whitehead's financial backers and assistants. Whitehead expressed his desire to keep the location of any future experiments hidden to avoid drawing a crowd that might make a [...] "snap-shot verdict of failure".|$|E
2500|$|Nonetheless, the City Attorney {{stood behind}} its legal opinion and {{environmentalist}} and former Sierra Club president Adam Werbach was later sworn in. The second appointee, architect Robin Chiang, was rescinded because Brown {{had already made}} one appointment, Andrew Lee, son of one of Brown's fund-raiser Julie Lee, {{who was convicted of}} mail fraud and witness tampering on July 12, 2008. Daly and his allies on the board <b>said</b> <b>Andrew</b> Lee represented political patronage at its worst. According to John Rizzo, vice chairman of the Bay chapter of the Sierra Club, Daly's appointments would add [...] "expertise to the SFPUC that was greatly lacking and is a great improvement" [...] Brown said that Daly's action went beyond betrayal and that he considers his relationship with Daly, who he had praised in recent months, over. The custom of assigning the acting mayor position to supervisors on a [...] basis was discontinued as a result of Daly's appointments. Daly said by way of explanation for his actions, [...] "I'm an activist. I had an opportunity, and I took it. I stand by what I did. It was the right thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bide you here, Richard, {{with your}} companion," [...] <b>said</b> Sir <b>Andrew.</b> [...] "Hugh, follow me, {{and let us}} learn whether I have trusted to God in vain." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Confound the brute!" [...] <b>said</b> Sir <b>Andrew,</b> {{with native}} British wrath, as Brogard leant {{up against the}} table, smoking and looking down superciliously at these two SACRRRES ANGLAIS.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will forgive}} me, Lady Blakeney," [...] <b>said</b> Sir <b>Andrew,</b> now as calm {{as she was}} herself, [...] "if I resume the {{interesting}} occupation which you have interrupted?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Andrew,</b> thoughtfully, [...] "I'd {{prefer the}} Eskdale. The obvious way's {{sometimes}} safest; it's the unusual thing that excites suspicion." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Did she?" [...] <b>said</b> <b>Andrew,</b> {{with some}} embarrassment. [...] "Ethel's a good friend. But it's rather {{trying to have}} things said about you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You were right," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Andrew.</b> [...] "It isn't a {{pleasant}} situation. I don't mind its not being flattering; that's the least trouble." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've got the grub {{and brought}} our mail," [...] he <b>said,</b> {{throwing}} <b>Andrew</b> a packet. [...] "Here's your lot; you can wade through it while I fix supper." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We can but hope, Lady Blakeney," [...] <b>said</b> Sir <b>Andrew</b> Ffoulkes after a while, [...] "that {{you will}} be allowed out of Paris; but from what Armand says--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bide {{where you}} are, O man of blood," [...] <b>said</b> Sir <b>Andrew</b> sternly: [...] "and pray that a better mood {{be given to}} you {{before it is too}} late." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Andrew.</b> [...] "Dick's debts must be met; but I {{would pay}} what he {{borrowed}} with reasonable interest, and nothing more." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose so," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Andrew.</b> [...] "Whether {{it leads}} you right {{or not is}} another matter. I'm thankful I haven't your fervid imagination." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The session knew best," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Andrew</b> sharply. [...] "And the minister--you're {{not going}} to set your opinion up against his, are you, Craig?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{drawbridge}} is down, thanks be to God!" [...] <b>said</b> Sir <b>Andrew,</b> [...] "which {{shows that}} no attack is feared. I doubt me, son, we shall find Acour flown." ...|$|R
6000|$|When Whitney and Dick had gone, Mackellar rang a bell {{that stood}} on the table. [...] "Ye'll join me with a glass o' wine," [...] he <b>said</b> to <b>Andrew.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{wants you}} and Hastings {{to meet him}} at Calais," [...] <b>said</b> Sir <b>Andrew,</b> more quietly, [...] "on the 2nd of next month. Let me see! that will be next Wednesday." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There's {{no doubt}} about it," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Andrew.</b> [...] "I've {{arranged}} matters satisfactorily with your president. You have only {{to say that you}} will come." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I see," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Andrew,</b> {{and turned}} to his companions. [...] "Boys, I'll stand for a ten-dollar bonus if this job's {{finished}} in half an hour." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I see," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Andrew.</b> [...] "Prospectors might scare away {{animals with}} skins worth {{a good deal}} of silver. But I didn't mean to {{interrupt}} you." ...|$|E
25|$|Callum {{tell the}} rest of the gang what Sephy <b>said</b> about <b>Andrew.</b> The members agree to split up and keep a low profile for six months and not meet up until Callum's birthday.|$|R
6000|$|... "You have strange dreams, Eve," [...] <b>said</b> Sir <b>Andrew,</b> [...] "yet {{there is}} truth in their madness. Now be strong lest joy should kill you, {{as it has}} done by many a one before." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{certainly}} seems incredible," [...] <b>said</b> Sir <b>Andrew.</b> [...] "You {{say that she}} actually denounced the Marquis de St. Cyr? Why should she have done such a thing? Surely {{there must be some}} mistake--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will engage}} {{that not a}} penny shall be unprofitably spent," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Andrew.</b> [...] "If the thing prove a failure, I will bear the expense." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Andrew.</b> [...] "Dick's {{capable of}} {{anything}} when he's worked up. The curious {{thing is that}} his head is steadier than usual then." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In such a {{gathering}} as this," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Andrew,</b> pointing an imaginary pistol at a lecturer on Socialism, [...] "you could hardly go wrong to let fly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{it is as}} well," [...] <b>said</b> Sir <b>Andrew</b> drily, [...] "though were I their age--well, {{let that}} be. Now, son Hugh, before you eat do you and Eve come with me into the church." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "As If We Never <b>Said</b> Goodbye" [...] (<b>Andrew</b> Lloyd Webber/Don Black/Christopher Hampton/Amy Powers) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{should have}} cut Mappin {{right out of}} this business," [...] Carnally <b>said</b> to <b>Andrew.</b> [...] "His first trick hasn't stopped us, but I feel uneasy about leaving him to handle the food we'll need when coming down." ...|$|R
