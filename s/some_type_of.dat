5|$|A {{patient may}} be {{discharged}} by revocation {{if he or}} she chooses to relinquish the hospice benefit. Revocation could be due to hospitalization, if the patient chooses to pursue <b>some</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> curative treatment or experiences dissatisfaction with hospice care. However, not all hospitalizations of patients require revocation; should the admitting diagnosis to the hospital be unrelated to the condition for which they are in hospice, the patient may remain on hospice while undergoing treatment for it.|$|E
5|$|A {{spontaneous}} CSF leak is idiopathic, {{meaning the}} cause in unknown.

It may also run in families and be associated with aortic aneurysms and joint hypermobility. Up to two thirds of those afflicted demonstrate <b>some</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> generalized connective tissue disorder. Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease are the three most common connective tissue disorders associated with SCSFLS.|$|E

In 1985, the Canadian historian Robin Yates visited the Buddhist cave temples when he saw a sculpture on the wall depicting a demon holding a hand-held bombard. The muzzle seems to have a blast and flames coming from it which some believe is proof of <b>some</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> super gun. Yates examined the cave and believed the drawings dated back to the late 12th century.|$|E
5|$|Communication {{between human}} and horse is {{paramount}} in any equestrian activity; to aid this process horses are usually ridden with a saddle {{on their backs}} to assist the rider with balance and positioning, and a bridle or related headgear to assist the rider in maintaining control. Sometimes horses are ridden without a saddle, and occasionally, horses are trained to perform without a bridle or other headgear. Many horses are also driven, which requires a harness, bridle, and <b>some</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> vehicle.|$|E

5|$|These {{processes}} use a welding {{power supply}} to create and maintain an electric arc between an electrode and the base material to melt metals at the welding point. They can use either direct (DC) or alternating (AC) current, and consumable or non-consumable electrodes. The welding region is sometimes protected by <b>some</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> inert or semi-inert gas, known as a shielding gas, and filler material is sometimes used as well.|$|E
5|$|Approximately {{one out of}} one {{thousand}} children suffer <b>some</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> congenital deafness related {{to the development of}} the inner ear. Inner ear congenital anomalies are related to sensorineural hearing loss and are generally diagnosed with a computed tomography (CT) scan or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Hearing loss problems also derive from inner ear anomalies because its development is separate from that of the middle and external ear. Middle ear anomalies can occur because of errors during head and neck development. The first pharyngeal pouch syndrome associates middle ear anomalies to the malleus and incus structures as well as to the non-differentiation of the annular stapedial ligament. Temporal bone and ear canal anomalies are also related to this structure of the ear and are known to be associated with sensorineural hearing loss and conductive hearing loss.|$|E

5|$|As {{a direct}} result of {{watching}} his fellow martial artists train with a fixed-blade fighting knife in class, yet carry <b>some</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> a folding knife when they left the training area, Emerson decided there was a need for a sturdy folding knife designed primarily for combat. Although Emerson had always maintained that the knives he made were built as fighting knives first and foremost, in October 1985 he stripped down five of these designs to simpler materials. He continued his use of linen or canvas micarta because of its high tensile strength and superior gripping surface when wet; he decided on black or dark grey for the color instead of the brighter colors used previously. He retained the titanium for the liners and bolsters but chose to bead-blast them a flat grey matte color as opposed to the colorful anodizing which used to appear on his knives. The reasons for using titanium were its exceptional strength-to-weight ratio and corrosion resistance.|$|E
5|$|Kehoe {{drove up}} to the school about half an hour after the explosion. He saw Superintendent Huyck and summoned him over to his truck. Charles Hawson testified at the inquest that he saw the two men {{struggle}} over <b>some</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> long gun before Kehoe detonated the dynamite stored in his truck, killing himself, Superintendent Huyck, Nelson McFarren (a retired farmer), and Cleo Clayton, an eight-year-old second grader. Clayton had survived the first blast and had wandered out of the school building debris; he was killed by the fragmentation from the exploding vehicle. The explosion also mortally wounded postmaster Glenn O. Smith, who lost a leg and died later that day of his wounds, and injured several others.|$|E
5|$|Modulation {{of neural}} {{responses}} may correlate with phenomenal experiences. In {{contrast to the}} raw electrical responses that do not correlate with consciousness, the modulation of these responses by other stimuli correlates surprisingly well with {{an important aspect of}} consciousness: namely with the phenomenal experience of stimulus intensity (brightness, contrast). In the research group of Danko Nikolić {{it has been shown that}} some of the changes in the subjectively perceived brightness correlated with the modulation of firing rates while others correlated with the modulation of neural synchrony. An fMRI investigation suggested that these findings were strictly limited to the primary visual areas. This indicates that, in the primary visual areas, changes in firing rates and synchrony can be considered as neural correlates of qualia—at least for <b>some</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> qualia.|$|E

5|$|Silviculture is the {{practice}} of controlling the establishment, growth, composition, health, and quality of forests, which are areas that have a high density of trees. Cultivated trees are planted and tended by humans, usually because they provide food (fruits or nuts), ornamental beauty, or <b>some</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> wood product that benefits people. An area of land planted with fruit or nut trees is an orchard. A small wooded area, usually with no undergrowth, is called a grove and a small wood or thicket of trees and bushes is called a coppice or copse. A large area of land covered with trees and undergrowth is called woodland or forest. An area of woodland composed primarily of trees established by planting or artificial seeding {{is known as a}} plantation.|$|E
5|$|The {{first use}} of horses in warfare {{occurred}} over 5,000 years ago. The earliest evidence of horses ridden in warfare dates from Eurasia between 4000 and 3000BC. A Sumerian illustration of warfare from 2500BC depicts <b>some</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> equine pulling wagons. By 1600BC, improved harness and chariot designs made chariot warfare common throughout the Ancient Near East, and the earliest written training manual for war horses was a guide for training chariot horses written about 1350BC. As formal cavalry tactics replaced the chariot, so did new training methods, and by 360BC, the Greek cavalry officer Xenophon had written an extensive treatise on horsemanship. The effectiveness of horses in battle was also revolutionized by improvements in technology, including {{the invention of the}} saddle, the stirrup, and later, the horse collar.|$|E
5|$|The {{survey showed}} that the breeds suffer from similar rates of ongoing health conditions, with one exception. Whereas {{more than a quarter}} of Pembroke Welsh Corgis {{surveyed}} suffered from <b>some</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> eye condition, only 6.1% of the Cardigan Corgis did. Eye conditions typical in the Corgi breeds include progressive retinal atrophy, which occurs more often in dogs over six years of age, and canine glaucoma, which again is more common in older dogs. Similar percentages in the survey were seen in both breeds for issues relating to reproduction, such as requiring caesarian sections and having false pregnancies. Further similarities were also seen related to musculoskelatal issues, including arthritis. However, Hip dysplasia, common in some types of dogs, is rare in the Corgi breeds.|$|E
