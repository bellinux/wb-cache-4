5|$|During the <b>shutdown,</b> some 19,000 state {{employees}} were laid off. State {{and federal government}} employees in Minnesota lost approximately $65 million in wages {{over the course of}} the <b>shutdown.</b> Because of court rulings, some of the 36,000 {{state employees}} who received layoff notices leading up to the <b>shutdown</b> continued or returned to work during the <b>shutdown.</b> Laid-off employees were immediately eligible for unemployment benefits, and continued to receive health insurance, costing the state millions a week.|$|E
5|$|Since Minnesota had divided {{government}}s {{for decades}} before 2010, {{a number of}} past budgets had brought the state close to a <b>shutdown,</b> {{and there had been}} one <b>shutdown</b> before in state history. After Governor Pawlenty and the Republican-majority House could not agree on a budget with the DFL-majority Senate in 2005, the state government went through a nine-day <b>shutdown.</b>|$|E
5|$|The 2006 New Jersey state {{government}} <b>shutdown</b> {{was the first}} <b>shutdown</b> {{in the history of}} the U.S. state of New Jersey. The <b>shutdown</b> occurred after the New Jersey Legislature and Governor Jon Corzine failed to agree on a state budget by the constitutional deadline. Furthermore, Corzine and the Legislature clashed on the issue of raising the state sales tax to help balance budget. Exercising his constitutional powers as governor, Corzine ordered the <b>shutdown</b> as a means of pressuring the Legislature to pass a budget. The <b>shutdown</b> began at midnight on July 1, 2006, when Corzine called for an orderly <b>shutdown</b> of non-essential government services, which was followed by a second round of shutdowns three days later on July 4.|$|E

5|$|While {{public schools}} {{remained}} open during the <b>shutdown,</b> and teachers {{continued to be}} paid following Gearin's ruling, the <b>shutdown</b> interfered with their operations, and would have caused serious problems if it had continued. Teachers could not renew or receive new licenses during the <b>shutdown,</b> creating a backlog, and property tax levy approvals could have been delayed. No fishing, hunting, and boating licenses or new drivers' licenses were issued during the <b>shutdown.</b> Taxes continued to be due, but tax refunds stopped.|$|E
5|$|During {{the casino}} <b>shutdown,</b> 36,000 casino workers were given leave. The <b>shutdown</b> of casinos {{resulted}} in lost {{revenue for the}} state, as an estimated $1.3 million per day was collected in gambling taxes plus an additional $2 million per day due to {{the closure of the}} lottery system. However, the sum of revenue not collected during the <b>shutdown</b> from gambling amounted to just {{a small fraction of the}} state's annual budget. Atlantic City's 12 casinos suffered losses estimated at $16–20 million per day during the <b>shutdown.</b> Revenue losses to lottery vendors and casino employees have not been calculated. Legislation signed by Governor Corzine in June 2008 would keep casinos and racetracks open in the event of a future budget showdown, with the Governor noting that the casino industry is vital to the New Jersey economy and that it should not operate under the threat of closure as it did in 2006.|$|E

5|$|The 2011 Minnesota state {{government}} <b>shutdown</b> was a government <b>shutdown</b> affecting the U.S. state of Minnesota. The <b>shutdown</b> {{was the result}} of a fiscal dispute between the Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party (DFL) Governor Mark Dayton and the Republican-majority Minnesota Legislature, that was not resolved by the constitutional deadline on June 30. The Republican caucuses and their leaders demanded bigger spending cuts, and for the budget shortfall to be met without tax increases, while Dayton demanded some tax increases. The <b>shutdown</b> started at midnight on July 1, and ended after a budget bill was passed and signed on July 20.|$|E

5|$|According to a MinnPost poll, Minnesotans {{blamed the}} Republican {{legislature}} {{more for the}} <b>shutdown.</b> Overall, 42% said Republicans in the legislature were more responsible, 21% said the DFL governor was more responsible, and 22% volunteered an answer that they were equally to blame. As expected, partisans blamed the other party more; only 10% of Republicans blamed the legislature more, and only 2% of DFLers blamed Dayton more. Following the <b>shutdown,</b> DFL Representative Phyllis Kahn authored a continuing appropriations bill that would prevent government shutdowns {{in the event of}} disagreements between the governor and legislature, as she had done in several past sessions. The House commissioned a policy brief from its research department, published in December 2011, that looked into what such a bill would require. The brief noted that such ideas had been considered before, including after the 2005 <b>shutdown,</b> and had been abandoned.|$|E
50|$|Between 1976 and 2013, {{there have}} been 18 Government <b>shutdowns</b> in the United States. Most of these <b>shutdowns</b> {{revolved}} around budget issues including fights over the debt ceiling {{and led to the}} furlough of certain 'non-essential' personnel.

40|$|When federal {{agencies}} and programs lack appropriated funding, they experience a funding gap. Under the Antideficiency Act, they must cease operations, except in certain emergency situations or when law authorizes continued activity. Failure of the President and Congress to reach agreement on interim or full-year funding measures occasionally has caused government <b>shutdowns,</b> the longest of which lasted 21 full days, from December 16, 1995, to January 6, 1996.

5|$|At {{that time}} the <b>shutdown</b> began, all state {{government}} spending and operations {{not considered to be}} critical stopped. Suspended state services included driving tests, childcare assistance, senior and disability linkage lines, criminal background checks, and road construction. State government offices, state parks, highway rest areas, and sites run by the Minnesota Historical Society, among others, closed. The commissioner of the Department of Human Services, Lucinda Jesson, said that letters had to be sent to over 580,000 households that relied on the department for social services to notify them about the possible <b>shutdown.</b> More critical parts of the state government, including public safety, health care, benefit payments, and care for residents of state facilities continued. Services that were continued during the <b>shutdown</b> could have amounted to as much as 80 percent of state spending.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} two weeks of the <b>shutdown,</b> there was little {{progress}} and neither the governor nor the Republican leaders made proposals accepted by the other side. On July 4, Republican lawmakers affirmed their commitment to not agree to a budget of over $34 billion. Documents leaked after June 30 stated that the Republican leadership included anti-abortion provisions, a voter ID requirement, and a ban on stem cell research during the budget negotiations. Both the Republican legislative leaders and Dayton (along with DFL legislative leaders) toured Minnesota to make their case to Minnesotans. The government <b>shutdown</b> ended after Governor Dayton announced on July 14 that he would accept the last Republican offer before the <b>shutdown,</b> albeit with certain conditions.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to {{the costs associated with}} staff, Minnesota lost some revenue during the <b>shutdown.</b> The Minnesota State Lottery did not sell tickets during the <b>shutdown,</b> which meant the state could have lost about $1.25 million in revenue daily. Minnesota stopped selling tax stamps for cigarettes, which must be affixed to each pack before sale. The Star Tribune reported that cigarette sales would come to a halt by mid-August if no more tax stamps were issued. The state also stopped issuing liquor purchasing cards, which businesses need in order to purchase liquor from wholesalers. Many stores, bars, and restaurants renewed their liquor purchasing cards before the <b>shutdown.</b> However, the purchasing cards for approximately three hundred establishments expired {{on the first day of}} the <b>shutdown,</b> July 1. Liquor purchasing cards would have continued to expire on the first day of each month. Alcohol brand licenses expired, so MillerCoors lost their license to sell 39 brands of beer in Minnesota, and had to have them removed from shelves.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} days of the <b>shutdown,</b> many {{programs}} requested that their funding continue, especially social service organizations that relied on state funding. To hear their pleas, the courts appointed retired State Supreme Court judge Kathleen Blatz as a special master. Dayton and State Attorney General Lori Swanson also both submitted petitions to the Ramsey County District Court when the <b>shutdown</b> began, asking for the court to clarify whether some programs could continue. Judges Kathleen Gearin and Bruce W. Christopherson issued their rulings on July 7, finding that some programs could start again, including criminal background checks, public schools, and local government aid. Gearin complained that the governor and legislature should have been responsible for making decisions about which services could stay open. Gearin had previously heard a case from the Minnesota Zoo, which asked to remain open despite the <b>shutdown,</b> and another from the Canterbury Park horse racing track in Shakopee. While both pay for themselves at least during the summer, Gearin determined that only the Zoo was allowed to operate without legislative appropriations, so she allowed the Zoo to open on July 2 but ordered Canterbury Park to remain closed the same day.|$|E
