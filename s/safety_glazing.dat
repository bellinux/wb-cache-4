40|$|A {{composite}} façade system {{concept was}} {{developed at the}} University of Michigan by Professor Harry Giles that considered the use of various transparent and composite materials in building construction. Particular aspects of this transparent composite façade system (TCFS) were investigated in this dissertation and involved the use of recyclable polymers and biofiber composites. This dissertation addresses research questions related to structural and environmental performance of the transparent composite façade system (TCFS) compared to a glass curtain wall system (GCWS). In order {{to better understand the}} context for the TCFS and establish performance evaluation methods, an extensive literature review was conducted focusing on material performance, structural performance requirements, life cycle assessment (LCA) techniques, composite panel principles, product surveys and building codes. Structural design criteria were established for the TCFS with respect to the strength and stiffness requirements of the International Building Code (IBC). A new testing frame was fabricated and installed at the architectural department of the University of Michigan to conduct static and impact tests in accordance with Safety Performance Specifications and Methods of Test (ANSI Z 97. 1). Initial static tests were carried out to measure bending stiffness of TCFS specimens in order to compare the results with theoretical predictions. Impact tests were also carried out to examine whether TCFS specimens conformed to the <b>safety</b> <b>glazing</b> criteria specified in ANSI Z 97. 1. In addition, a comparative LCA of a TCFS and a GCWS was performed on each system to assess their respective environmental implications. Structural testing results indicated that the bending stiffness according to simple beam theory is in agreement with measured stiffness under two-edge supported conditions. Impact tests demonstrated that TCFS specimens satisfy the Class B of the <b>safety</b> <b>glazing</b> requirements of ANSI Z 97. 1. Comparative LCA results showed that the total life cycle energy of the TCFS was estimated to be 93 % of that of the uncoated GCWS and the total emission of kg CO 2 equivalent for the TCFS was determined as 89 % of the uncoated GCWS. The impact associated with transportation and the end-of-life management was estimated to be insignificant in this study...|$|E
40|$|Bisphenol A (BPA) {{is one of}} {{the highest}} {{production}} volume chemicals in the world. Global production capacity of BPA was about 5, 160 kilotons in 2008 (Chemical Weekly 2009). The U.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Explosions within {{urban areas}} can inflict great damage to {{building}} envelopes and facades, particularly glazed areas, following which, fragments {{of broken glass}} can then cause damage to building interiors and pose significant safety hazards to occupants. The aim of this thesis {{is to develop a}} new probabilistic framework {{that can be used to}} quantify the risks of glass damage and <b>glazing</b> <b>safety</b> hazards associated with explosive blast loads; indeed, the framework has utility for all manner of blast-load/structural-response scenarios. In any blast-load scenario there is considerable uncertainty and variability associated with many parameters, such as: explosive mass, stand-off, net equivalent quantity, explosive shape, confinement, the inherent variability of a blast wave, errors in predicting blast-load parameters, and so forth. The new framework uses well-accepted methods of structural reliability and probability theory to undertake assessments of two topical blast load scenarios: (i) an aerially delivered military weapon (where collateral damage risks are paramount), and (ii) a terrorist style vehicle borne improved explosive device (where the risk of any safety hazard is of interest). A new probabilistic blast load model propagates the uncertainty and variability through the computations to reveal estimates of probable blast-load values, such as: pressure, impulse and the duration time of a blast wave’s first positive pulse. These probabilistically derived values are compared against classical (deterministically calculated) blast-load predictions with a view to assess their degree of conservatism (or otherwise). The two blast load scenarios are then used within a new probabilistic glazing-response model that considers a typical 20 -story urban structure containing normal facade glazing. The glazing system (both pre and post fracture) also contains uncertainty and variability in items such as: glass dimensions, the strength of glass, Poisson’s ratio, Young’s Modulus, the drag coefficients of different (and randomly sized/shaped) glass fragments, and so forth. Values of uncertainty and variability are again propagated through the calculations to reveal estimates of the risk of glazing failure and the risk of <b>glazing</b> <b>safety</b> hazards to building occupants. Different glazing options are considered (in a number of case studies) where risk, reliability and cost-benefit analyses allows comparisons to be made between the relative effectiveness of security measures, weapon selection, delivery method or other mitigation measures. The intent for the framework presented in this thesis is that it represents a rational approach to predicting blast damage risks which can then be used: (a) As a decision support tool to mitigate damage (risk-cost-benefit analysis), (b) By emergency services to predict the extent and likelihood of damage and casualty levels in contingency planning and emergency response simulations, (c) For collateral damage estimation for military planners (i. e., minimise risk of collateral damage when selecting military ordinance), and (d) In forensics to back-calculate charge mass based on the extent of observed damage and a known stand-off distance...|$|R
40|$|Tragic {{world events}} have opened {{our eyes to}} the {{vulnerability}} and {{false sense of security}} in today’s buildings around the globe. The horrific loss of life and property from terrorist attacks on these structures has forced building owners, investors, government authorities, building occupants and insurance companies to seek new solutions to protect people from these events as well as from extreme climatic natural disasters. As a result, building designers face ever increasing stringent standards in today’s modern building construction. These designers are relying on the unique properties and uncompromising strength of silicone structural glazing products to play an added active role in new protective and <b>safety</b> <b>glazing</b> systems. These advances are helping to defend against extreme events such as bomb blast resistance, hurricane and earthquake protection, burglary protection, noise control and fire resistance. This paper will review developments with silicone sealants in safety and security systems. The primary focus of this paper will be on facades which are designed to mitigate bomb blast. The basic design requirements of a bomb blast mitigating window design are similar to those for windows designed to withstand hurricanes, earthquakes, burglary protection and the like. It also explains how the use of silicone sealants will further open up new possibilities for protective functionality in façade and window systems...|$|E
40|$|In {{the world}} of {{structural}} engineering glass is an innovative material. Compared to other conventional structural materials like concrete, steel and timber, it is especially the transparency property {{that makes it a}} valued material. Due to the increasing demand for transparency in contemporary architecture, much more structural components as beams, plates, portals and columns are developed in glass. Besides the transparency property, the brittleness of glass makes it essentially an unsafe structural material as the residual capacity is limited. Therefore, the structural glass column is still in its early phases of development. As architects and clients, in general, do not like columns, they are said to block the view and stand in the way. Engineers need to add columns to buildings to provide support. These conflicting desires can be solved by developing a more attractive column, a glass column. The aim of this research project was to focus on further knowledge and understanding of the structural design aspects specifically related to structural glass columns and, {{on the basis of these}} findings, to design a glass column as a structural element in a pavilion. The considered slender columns were assembled from rectangular monolithic flat glass plates into different configurations. An exploratory study to the design aspects of glass columns was performed by doing experiments. One-metre-high glass columns were assembled from glass plates 8 millimetres thick, 100 millimetres wide and 1000 millimetres long and glued with a two-component adhesive based on epoxy resin (Araldite 2000 PLUS 2013) into five different configurations. These columns were compressed by a test bench with felt as the interlayer material to distribute the stresses uniformly over the cross-sectional area. A thorough analysis of the columns and their structural behaviour resulted in four design aspects that should be considered in the design process of a structural glass column: - a difference in the vertical position between the assembled glass plates; - susceptibility to peak stresses at the edges of the glass column; - the stiffness properties of the glue; - imperfections like holes and scratches. A two-dimensional numerical model was developed to study two of the considered design aspects. The effect of a difference in the vertical position between the assembled glass plates (which results in protruding edges) and the stiffness properties of the glue on the stress development in the glass were studied. Another series of experiments was performed to study the effect of several design options on the load bearing capacity of the column. The experiments revealed that, among others, avoiding the chance of uneven loading due to a difference in the vertical position between the glass plates and applying an adhesive with low stiffness results in more uniformly distribution of the stresses over the glass column. Finally, the findings of the experimental and numerical investigations were integrated into the structural design of a glass column for a pavilion. The preliminary design of a pavilion, which consists of ten columns, served as a context for the structural glass columns (each four metres high). Two main aspects were distinguished in the design process of the column: the boundary connection system and the related cross-section. Finally, a safety concept was developed for the monolithic glass column by applying an outer layer of <b>safety</b> <b>glazing</b> around the structural glass column. To conclude, from this research it is found that different design aspects play an important role in the bearing capacity of slender glass columns assembled from rectangular monolithic flat glass plates. On the basis of the experimental and numerical results the most relevant aspects related to designing a structural glass column were listed in the report.

40|$|Laminated {{glass is}} for a few decades a {{well-known}} product {{in the construction industry}} for conferring <b>safety</b> performances to <b>glazing</b> units. Besides to the safeguarding of persons, laminated glass products are contributing to a variety of other safety performances, in case of accidental or attack situations leading to breakage of or crack propagation in the glass panes of a laminated glass unit. The ultimate residual load-bearing capacity of a damaged element can be resumed to one critical load-transfer mechanism, in the form of interlayer ligaments bridging the glass fragments. The characterization for design purposes of the mechanical properties of the interlayer involved in this load-transfer mechanism through the ligament appears however far from obvious. This results from specificities on the one hand of adhesive polymer components and on the other of design and control processes in the building industry. These specificities are mainly related to two aspects : firstly to the time- and temperature dependent behaviour of interlayer materials and their possible sensitivity to ageing effects, and secondly to initially vaguely defined intended fields of use, especially when non-conventional structural applications are within the considered application scope. The combination of these two aspects raises constraints for the development of experimental methods, test configurations and assessment strategies for laminated glass products. This research proposes analysis grids to get an overview of the constitutive elements of application scopes and of the possibilities and limitations for experimental assessment, with purpose to distinguish and estimate different types of border effects. These are used to evaluate the representativeness and the robustness of different test methods and test configurations, corresponding to different experimental scales. An incremental experimental approach has been developed for investigating the time- and temperature dependent performances of damaged laminated glass elements, on the basis of tests on pre-cracked specimens of small dimensions. The assessment of the residual load-bearing capacity of damaged elements used in structural applications was the main focus of these investigations. This research highlights the need for adapting experimental assessment approaches to characterize properties of laminated glass products for design purposes with respect to their post-fracture performances, in comparison with other construction materials. It also explains specific difficulties for obtaining quantitatively meaningful results and the challenges for harmonizing experimental assessment strategies for different applications and products made with a same type of interlayer material...|$|R
