The main objective of this paper, however, is to study the submerged body problem.

This critical value varies {{as a function of the}} separation of the two bodies.

The increment of drag associated with the change of nose shapes was found to be critically dependent on the afterbody of the nacelle. Two streamline afterbodies were tested. The results fo the tests with the more streamlined afterbody showed that the added drag due to the open-nose cowling was only one-fourth of the drag increase obtained with the other afterbody. The results of this research indicate that the power cost, in excess of that with a streamline nose, of using an N. A. C.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to develop a {{numerical}} model to reproduce the bubbly flow field created by ventilated cavity which includes three different regions. The model was established based on the Eulerian-Eulerian two-fluid model coupled with a population balance approach which is solved by the Homogeneous Multiple-Size-Group (MUSIG) model to predict bubble size distribution. Base on the model, the simulation was carried out at the experimental condition of Su et al. (1995). Firstly three regions were successfully captured proved by the spatial voidage distribution and <b>streamline</b> <b>shape.</b> Then distributions of void fraction and Sauter mean bubble diameter at various sections below the cavity corresponding to three regions respectively were plotted against experimental data. A close agreement was observed in the void fraction distribution which indicates that qualitative details of the structure of the two-phase flow field below the cavity was successfully produced. The Sauter mean bubble diameter in the pipe flow region was under-predicted for about 10 %. In conclusion, the proposed model was validated in predicting the multi-region flow field below the ventilated cavity which will provide a valuable insight in designing and controlling of the two phase systems with the detailed flow field information obtained. 1...|$|E

Flow pictures of the vortex core and vorticity measurements in the core show that an axial momentum injection of approximately 35 % of the total wing drag alters the vortex structure and behavior quite drastically by effectively inducing a more rapid dispersion of the vorticity in the core. The data indicate that the phenomenon is governed by the rate of injection of the momentum rather than the mass flow rate. There also seems to be an optimum rate of injection beyond which increased injection does not bring about equally significant changes in the vortex core. Flow patterns of the region of interaction between the flow field of a lifting surface and the vortex core show two modes of vortex response; (1) the vortex core bends, following the <b>streamline</b> <b>shape</b> until it intercepts the wake of the wing where it is abruptly dispersed, or (2) the vortex core may be sliced into two similar vortices when the vortex hits the leading edge of the wing...|$|E

In a wooden boat processing, the easy forming into a curve shape and strength are main factor, because of the <b>streamline</b> <b>shape</b> of boats. LVL material is able to meet those requirements. As an endless-length LVL is made from a log limited-length hence LVL always contain joints. Butt joint have numerous drawbacks, but they are inherently simple and less time to manufacture than other joints types. The purposes of this experiment are to investigate the basic characteristics of LVL which are important for deck and hull planking in the wooden boat constructions. Yellow meranti and red meranti were peeled by a veneer lathe and phenol formaldehyde adhesive were used. Result of experiment indicated that at the position 0 o (β), the flexibility and strength of LVL up to proportional limit increased with increasing number of layer and spacing of butt-joint (d/t). LVL at the position 45 o and 90 o (β), all types of LVL had lower flexibility and strength than the standard value for deck and hull planking.

In order to achieve this <b>streamline</b> <b>shape</b> as a boundary, the corrugated airfoil was tightly wrapped with paper. Tests were then conducted in the chord Reynolds number range of 5. 8 x 104 to 1. 23 x 105; corresponding to the Reynolds number regime for MAVs. The results show that the corrugated airfoil out performs the 2 ̆ 7 smooth 2 ̆ 7 airfoil and flat plate in low Reynolds number flows. However, as the Reynolds number increases, the performance of the smooth airfoil also increases and the advantage of the corrugation diminishes.;Chapter 3 details a very preliminary study of the phenomena employed by most all natural flyers; flapping wings.

40|$|The nozzle {{afterbody}} {{is one of}} {{the main}} drag-producing components of an aircraft propulsion system. Thus, considerable effort has been devoted to developing techniques for predicting the afterbody flow field and drag. The RAXJET computer program was developed to predict the transonic, axisymmetric flow over nozzle afterbodies with supersonic jet exhausts and includes the effects of boundary-layer displacement, separation, jet entrainment, and inviscid jet plume blockage. RAXJET iteratively combines the South-Jameson relaxation procedure, the Reshotko-Tucker boundary-layer solution, the Presz separation model, the Dash-Pergament mixing model, and the Dash-Thorpe inviscid plume model into a single, comprehensive model. The approach taken in the RAXJET program requires considerably less computational time than the Navier-Stokes solutions and generally yields results of comparable accuracy. In RAXJET, the viscous-inviscid interaction model is constructed by dividing the afterbody flow field into six separate computational regions: (1) The inviscid external flow solution is based on the relaxation procedure of South and Jameson for solving the exact nonlinear potential flow equation in nonconservative form. (2) The flow field in the inviscid jet exhaust is solved by explicit spatial marching of the conservative finite-difference form of the inviscid flow equations for a uniform composition gas mixture. (3) The properties in the attached boundary-layer region are solved by a modified version of the Reshotko-Tucker integral method for turbulent flows. (4) The analysis of the separated flow region consists of predicting the separation location and calculating the discriminating <b>streamline</b> <b>shape.</b> (5) The jet wake region is determined by either a simple extrapolation model or by an integral method that accounts for entrainment effects. (6) The displacement-thickness distribution arising from entrainment into the jet mixing layer is calculated by the overlaid mixing model. The inviscid external flow solution and inviscid jet exhaust solution provide the necessary flow conditions to calculate the flow in the viscous regions. The viscous and inviscid flow fields are iteratively solved until a final solution is obtained. Input to the RAXJET program consists of body geometry data, free-stream conditions, main logic control parameters, and condition and control parameters for each of the six computational flow regions.

40|$|Abstract: Friction Stir Welding (FSW) is {{regarded}} as the most significant development in joining over the past two decades. In FSW, process parameters and tool geometry play a fundamental role in obtaining desirable mechanical properties and microstructures in the welded zone. The tool geometry {{plays an important role in}} producing sound friction stir welds. Tool designs are however, generally propriety to individual researchers and only limited information is available in open literature. There are however, continuous efforts to understand the material flow and the influence that the FSW tool design has on the friction stir welded material. Within industries that use various welding techniques it well known that FSW is particularly suited for the welding of aluminium; there is great potential for FSW of copper. Given the limited supply, high cost, copper theft and commercial demand associated with copper, engineers and scientists will either attempt to reduce the quantity of copper consumed by industries or alternatively replace copper with a substitute metal that exhibits similar attributable properties. On account of the limited supply and consequently the high cost associated with copper and copper alloys; the need to join aluminium and copper and its’ alloys is anticipated to increase in the near future. FSW of dissimilar alloys/metals has attracted extensive research interest due to potential engineering prominence and inherent problems associated with conventional welding methods. This research identifies the choice of suitable tool designs and process parameters to produce sound dissimilar friction stir welds of 5754 aluminium and C 11000 copper. This research focuses primarily on determining the effect of FSW process parameters on the forces experienced by the FSW tool and the relationship that this has on the electrical conductivity properties of the friction stir dissimilar weld. The experimental work was performed by completing dissimilar friction stir welds on 3 mm thick butt welds of the two materials by means of an I-stir FSW platform. During the experimental work, the rotational speed was varied between 600 and 1200 rpm in intervals on 300 related to low, medium and high rotational speeds respectively and four different FSW tool geometries were tested. The first tool was a new design with a unique shoulder topography and a cylindrical pin named the “Reddy tool”. The second tool was a tool consisted of a concave shoulder and conical pin. Tests were performed using the second tool at a 0 degree tilt and at a 2 degree tilt relative to the work-piece. The third tool consisted of a concave shoulder and cylindrical pin. The forth tool design consisted of a flat shoulder and a cylindrical pin. This research forms part of the initial experimental work to determine the forces and electrical resistance of dissimilar friction stir welds of aluminium and copper by employing different tool shoulder designs. The welds were characterised through visual inspection, weld defect and material flow analysis, microstructural evaluation, electrical resistance measurements and tool forces and tool torque analysis. Microstructural evaluation results revealed complex flow patterns of copper and aluminium material. Lamellae structures composed of copper particles with a <b>streamline</b> <b>shape</b> and continuous aluminium strips were present. Some evidence of dynamic recrystallization was observed in the nugget of the defect free welds.
