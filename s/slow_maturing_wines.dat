50|$|The <b>matured</b> <b>wine</b> {{contains}} 10.5-12.5% {{alcohol and}} has 6.0-7.0% titrated acidity. It has been produced since 1888.|$|R
50|$|Bacalhau {{is often}} served with potatoes. Green (Vinho Verde) or <b>mature</b> <b>wines</b> (Alentejo Wine, Dão Wine, or Douro Wine) are served alongside.|$|R
25|$|There were no bonded {{warehouses}} in England in the 18th Century, so warehouses {{were built in}} Guernsey to store and <b>mature</b> <b>wine</b> and spirits until they were needed in England.|$|R
40|$|Wine {{maturation}} {{can take}} a long time and consumes storage space which can be a drawback while considering commercial aspect of wine making. In the past scientists have carried out experiments on <b>maturing</b> <b>wine</b> quickly using ultrasounds or gamma radiations. This study reports about <b>maturing</b> <b>wine</b> with high electric field at different frequencies applied for a short time duration. The electric field intensity and the frequency of the field along with the exposure time of wine to this field seem to be important parameters that could affect the the treated wine. Results obtained are encouraging and have a potential for commercial interest...|$|R
5000|$|Maduro: Mature (in {{opposition}} to verde). <b>Mature</b> <b>wines</b> are Portuguese wines produced in all regions except the ones produced in Vinho Verde region; due to this, the term [...] "maduro" [...] rarely appears on bottles.|$|R
50|$|Its primary land usage is as {{vineyards}} {{and produces}} very high quality <b>slow</b> <b>maturing</b> cool weather grapes.|$|R
25|$|Ageing {{also brings}} other {{flavours}} to the wine. Barrel ageing creates scents of vanilla, butter, brioche, toast, caramel, etc. The long <b>maturing</b> <b>wines</b> like yellow wine or sherry have typical aromas of fresh walnuts, almonds, and hazelnuts.|$|R
50|$|Malolactic {{fermentation}} {{occurs when}} {{lactic acid bacteria}} metabolize malic acid and produce lactic acid and carbon dioxide. This is carried out either as an intentional procedure in which specially cultivated strains of such bacteria are introduced into the <b>maturing</b> <b>wine,</b> or it can happen by chance if uncultivated lactic acid bacteria are present.|$|R
50|$|Second hand wine auctions are {{arranged}} by many major auction houses, such as Christie's and Sotheby's. Prices for many wines at these auctions {{are used as}} a price indication for collectible wine when traded through other channels, such as First Growth Bordeaux wines sold by rare wine dealers, or when négociants sell <b>mature</b> <b>wines</b> from their stock to restaurants.|$|R
50|$|The {{average life}} span of a SuperAuto is 90 to 110 days from seed {{as opposed to the}} shorter 55-85 days with most common autoflowers. The added {{advantage}} of the longer life span is that <b>slow</b> <b>maturing</b> sativa phenotype have more time to develop and larger yields can be obtained.|$|R
5000|$|The State Enterprise Quality Wines Industrial Complex [...] "Mileștii Mici" [...] {{was founded}} in 1969 to store, {{preserve}} and <b>mature</b> high-quality <b>wines.</b>|$|R
50|$|Once {{the wines}} have been blended {{on a large}} scale, they are matured in tanks (in the case of {{smoother}} vintages) or in barrels (in the case of more robust vintages). <b>Maturing</b> a <b>wine</b> means storing it for long periods in cellars where the temperature is controlled and where it remains undisturbed apart from rackings that take place every three months. <b>Maturing</b> a <b>wine</b> that is stored in barrels can take between six and eighteen months.|$|R
5000|$|Boars are {{generally}} about 250 kg in weight and sows {{range from about}} 150 to 200 kg. In the nineteenth century, the Welsh was described to have rather long legs {{and to be a}} razorback whilst being a <b>slow</b> <b>maturer</b> and coarse-haired. The Welsh pig is a hardy animal and thrives both indoors and in more extensive outdoor systems.|$|R
50|$|Tokajský výber (in Hungarian: aszú): This is {{the wine}} which made Tokaj world famous. It is a sweet dessert wine made by {{individually}} picking botrytised grapes and trampling them in huge vats {{to form a}} paste. Must is then poured on the paste and left to soak before the wine is transferred to wooden casks where fermentation in completed. The wines are graded from 3 to 6 putňa (puttony), representing the level of sugar and sugar-free extract in the <b>mature</b> <b>wine.</b>|$|R
50|$|Berenson envisaged Villa I Tatti as a “lay monastery” for the leisurely {{study of}} Mediterranean culture through its art. He was against {{academic}} production, specialization, degrees, {{and what are}} now called in the Italian academic world “titoli,” and instead prized the <b>slow</b> <b>maturing</b> of ideas in tranquil contemplation. He considered his own achievement to lie as much in conversation as in writing.|$|R
5000|$|The {{developmental}} psychologist Helmuth Nyborg {{said that}} a testable hypothesis can be made using his General Trait Covariance-Androgen/Estrogen (GTC-A/E) model with regards to [...] "neoteny". Nyborg said that the hypothesis is that [...] "feminized", <b>slower</b> <b>maturing,</b> [...] "neotenic" [...] "androtypes" [...] will differ from [...] "masculinized", faster maturing [...] "androtypes" [...] by having bigger brains, more fragile skulls, bigger hips, narrower shoulders, less physical strength, live in cities (as opposed to living in the countryside) and by receiving higher performance scores on ability tests. Nyborg {{said that if the}} predictions made by this hypothesis are true, then the [...] "material basis" [...] of the differences would be [...] "explained". Nyborg said that some ecological situations would favor the survival and reproduction of the [...] "masculinized," [...] faster maturing [...] "androtypes" [...] due to their [...] "sheer brutal force" [...] while other ecological situations would favor the survival and reproduction of the [...] "feminized," [...] <b>slower</b> <b>maturing,</b> [...] "neotenic" [...] "androtypes" [...] due to their [...] "subtle tactics." ...|$|R

5000|$|Beers are {{sometimes}} aged in barrels which were previously used for <b>maturing</b> <b>wines</b> or spirits. This is {{most common in}} darker beers such as stout, which is sometimes aged in oak barrels identical to those used for whiskey. Whiskey distiller Jameson notably purchases barrels used by Franciscan Well brewery for their Shandon Stout to produce a whiskey branded as [...] "Jameson Caskmates". Cask ale is aged in the barrel (usually steel) {{for a short time}} before serving. Extensive barrel aging is required of many sour beers.|$|R
25|$|After {{harvest the}} grapes are destemmed and crushed {{with a short}} {{maceration}} period, often with the must warmed up to aid in extraction of color and phenolics before the wines are pressed and put into barrel. The wine almost always goes through malolactic fermentation. Some Saint-Nicolas-de-Bourgueil producers with vineyards planted in lighter soils will produce an early <b>maturing</b> <b>wine,</b> with an even shorter maceration period and much less oak aging, that can be released {{as early as the}} summer after vintage while other examples will see 15 to 18 months of aging before being bottled.|$|R
25|$|The red-wine {{production}} process involves extraction {{of color and}} flavor components from the grape skin. Red wine is made from dark-colored grape varieties. The actual color of the wine can range from violet, typical of young wines, through red for <b>mature</b> <b>wines,</b> to brown for older red wines. The juice from most purple grapes is actually greenish-white; the red color comes from anthocyan pigments (also called anthocyanins) present in {{the skin of the}} grape; exceptions are the relatively uncommon teinturier varieties, which actually have red flesh and produce red juice.|$|R
2500|$|The {{most common}} style {{of wine in}} ancient Greece was sweet and aromatic, though drier wines were also produced. Color ranged from dark, inky black to [...] to nearly clear. Oxidation was {{difficult}} to control, a common wine fault that meant many wines did not retain their quality beyond the next vintage. However, wines that were stored well and aged were highly prized: Hermippus described the best <b>mature</b> <b>wines</b> as having a bouquet of [...] "violets, roses and hyacinth." [...] Comedic poets noted that Greek women liked [...] "old wine but young men." ...|$|R
40|$|Presented {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} focused on laboratory monitoring and determination of the selected parameters of grape wine which includes specific gravity, alcoholic content, reducing sugar content, total titratable acidity, volatile acidity and total solids, sulfur dioxide content and protein and crystalline wine stability.

50|$|The {{concentration}} of aszú was traditionally {{defined by the}} number of puttony of dough added to a Gönc cask (136 liter barrel) of must. Nowadays the puttony number is based on the content of sugar and sugar-free extract in the <b>mature</b> <b>wine.</b> Aszú ranges from 3 puttonyos to 6 puttonyos, with a further category called Aszú-Eszencia representing wines above 6 puttonyos. Unlike most other wines, alcohol content of aszú typically runs higher than 14%. Annual production of aszú is {{less than one percent of}} the region's total output.|$|R

50|$|Red wine {{is a type}} of wine {{made from}} dark-colored (black) grape varieties. The actual color of the wine can range from intense violet, typical of young wines, through to brick red for <b>mature</b> <b>wines</b> and brown for older red wines. The juice from most purple grapes is greenish-white; the red color comes from anthocyan {{pigments}} (also called anthocyanins) present in the skin of the grape; exceptions are the relatively uncommon teinturier varieties, which produce a red colored.

50|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Master of Wine and senior {{consultant}} of Christie's auction Michael Broadbent developed {{a guide for}} evaluating the ullage levels of <b>matured</b> <b>wines.</b> While the focus of his guide was primarily on Bordeaux, it has been generally accepted and widely used in the wine market as an evaluation tool {{for all sorts of}} wine. The terms are used to describe the levels of wine in a wine bottle. They are commonly used to describe old wine bottles offered for sale in wine auctions and by dealers in rare wine. Despite the guide's popularity, Broadbent has been quoted as regretting his decision not to copyright it.|$|R
5000|$|A wine auction is {{an auction}} devoted to wine, {{sometimes}} {{in combination with}} other alcoholic beverages. There are two basic types of wine auctions: first hand wine auctions, where wineries sell their own wines, and second hand wine auctions, arranged by auction houses or other auctioneers {{to make it possible for}} any owners of wine to trade it. In most cases, the wines traded at wine auctions are collectible wine, so-called [...] "fine wine". These are wines which are typically suitable for extended cellaring, and where some of the buyers are looking for <b>mature</b> <b>wines</b> which are no longer available through first-hand retail channels.|$|R
