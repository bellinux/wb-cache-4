Not far away a wavy wall of fire was moving down on them out of the prairie, and there were two more some distance to the left, though it would evidently be a little while before the last of them rolled up. Already a thick and acrid vapour whirled among the oats, and, when it melted a little, and a brighter blaze sprang up, he could see the men's tense faces and the curious rigidity of their attitudes.|$|R

40|$|This study {{utilized}} leaf stage-based defoliation intervals {{to describe}} the concentrations and contents of watersoluble carbohydrate (WSC) and nitrogen (N) in stubble and root reserves and their effect on the regrowth of prairie grass (Bromus willdenowii Kunth.) plants. The priority sequence for allocation of WSC reserves during the regrowth period was also investigated. There were substantially higher concentrations of WSC and N in the stubble compared with the roots following defoliation, confirming the stubble as the primary site for energy storage, with roots playing a lesser role. However, high R 2 values for the relationships between WSC concentration in roots and regrowth variables suggested that plants of prairie grass were reliant on WSC reserves from the roots {{in addition to the}} stubble to meet the energy requirements of plants until adequate photosynthetic tissue had been produced. The sequence of priority for allocation of WSC reserves followed the order of leaf growth, root growth and tillering during the regrowth period. Although WSC reserves were identified as the primary contributor to plant regrowth following defoliation, there was also a strong relationship <b>between</b> <b>stubble</b> N concentration and regrowth variables...|$|R

50|$|Pisonia is a genus of {{flowering}} {{plants in the}} four o'clock flower family, Nyctaginaceae. It was named for Dutch physician and naturalist Willem Piso (1611-1678). Certain species in this genus are known as catchbirdtrees, birdcatcher trees or birdlime trees because their sticky seeds reportedly trap small birds. These sticky seeds are postulated to be an adaptation of some island species to ensure the dispersal of <b>seeds</b> <b>between</b> islands by attaching them to birds. These island species include P. brunoniana of Australasia and Polynesia and P. umbellifera, which is widespread in the tropical Indo-Pacific region.|$|R
