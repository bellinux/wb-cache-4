5|$|The Fairy Queen, {{also known}} as the East Indian Railway 22 class is an 1855-built <b>steam</b> <b>locomotive,</b> {{restored}} and housed at the Rewari Railway Heritage Museum. It regularly runs between New Delhi and Alwar, in Rajasthan. In 1998 it was listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the world's oldest <b>steam</b> <b>locomotive</b> in regular service. The Fairy Queen runs on the same route as the Palace on Wheels, the tourist train launched in 1982, and in 1999 was awarded a National Tourism Award.|$|E
5|$|None of the {{original}} engines survived into preservation, however {{progress is being made}} by a Registered Charity (No. 1062320), the Standard <b>Steam</b> <b>Locomotive</b> Company, on constructing a new locomotive {{that would have been the}} first of the uncompleted batch of 15, number 72010 Hengist. As 999 BR standard steam locomotives were built in the years up to 1960 the builders consider this is the 1000th locomotive build to be commenced to a British Railways standard design. The Standard <b>Steam</b> <b>Locomotive</b> Company believes that significant costs will be avoided as many of the required cast parts can be made from patterns held by fellow members of the British Railways Standard Locomotive Owners Group (BRSLOG).|$|E

5|$|In 1958, {{as part of}} the commemorations of the 70th {{anniversary of}} the {{creation}} of the Wood Green Local Board, the railway goods depot was used for a three-day exhibition of locomotives and other railway rolling stock.

50|$|Though it was {{apparent}} to knowledgeable people in the railroad industry that reciprocating piston driven <b>steam</b> <b>locomotives</b> might soon be replaced by diesel power, Lima and C&O set out to build the ultimate in high power <b>steam</b> <b>locomotives</b> and they succeeded. No diesel engine ever surpassed the output of these giants, which were the heaviest <b>steam</b> <b>locomotives</b> ever constructed (by engine-only weight). The three-axle trailing truck supporting the firebox was unusual, carrying over 190,000 lbs, allowing the huge firebox needed for the high power. As it turned out, <b>steam</b> <b>locomotives</b> continued in service for almost another 20 years.|$|R
50|$|CIÉ soon {{replaced}} its remaining <b>steam</b> <b>locomotives</b> with diesels {{and sold}} {{four of its}} former GNRI <b>steam</b> <b>locomotives</b> - all three S class and one VS class - to the UTA in 1963.|$|R
5|$|In 2010, {{two of the}} disused {{platforms}} {{hosted a}} theatrical performance of The Railway Children by E. Nesbit. The audience was seated {{either side of the}} actual railway track. The show included the use of a <b>steam</b> <b>locomotive</b> coupled to one of the original carriages from the 1970s film (propelled by a diesel locomotive). The performance moved to London after two acclaimed summer runs at the National Railway Museum in York.|$|E
5|$|LNER Class A3 4472 Flying Scotsman is a Pacific <b>steam</b> <b>locomotive</b> {{built in}} 1923 for the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) at Doncaster Works to a design of Nigel Gresley.

5|$|Most of the {{detailed}} {{design for the}} Merchant Navy class was undertaken by the drawing office at Brighton works, but some work was also undertaken by Ashford and Eastleigh. This division of responsibility was possibly due to Bulleid's wish to restrict knowledge of the new class to {{a limited number of}} personnel. The design incorporated a number of novel features, compared to then-current <b>steam</b> <b>locomotive</b> practice in Great Britain.|$|E
50|$|The {{railroad}} {{has four}} <b>steam</b> <b>locomotives</b> in regular service, {{as well as}} several diesel engines. Most of the railroad's engines are geared <b>steam</b> <b>locomotives.</b> These specialized types of <b>steam</b> engines—Shay <b>locomotives,</b> Heisler locomotives, Climax locomotives, and a Willamette locomotive were used in the early 20th century for logging. Compared to traditional side-rod <b>steam</b> <b>locomotives,</b> geared locomotives were better-suited for steep grades and hastily laid track. Thus, the MRSR seeks to preserve and operate historic geared locomotives and related logging technology in order to present visitors with a sense of a bygone logging era critical {{to the development of the}} Pacific Northwest.|$|R
50|$|For {{most of the}} museum's history, {{nearly all}} trains were pulled by <b>steam</b> <b>locomotives</b> {{although}} since February 2000, all trains have been pulled by diesel-electric locomotives pending the restoration or repair of the museum's <b>steam</b> <b>locomotives.</b>|$|R

5|$|The BR Standard Class 8 was a {{class of}} 4-6-2 Pacific <b>steam</b> <b>locomotive</b> {{designed}} by Robert Riddles for use by British Railways. Only the prototype was constructed, which was named Duke of Gloucester. Constructed at Crewe Works in 1954, the Duke, as it is popularly known, was a replacement for the destroyed LMS Princess Royal Class locomotive number 46202 Princess Anne, which {{was involved in the}} Harrow and Wealdstone rail disaster of 1952.|$|E
5|$|The first Zephyr (9900) was {{completed}} by the Budd Company on April 9, 1934, powered by an eight-cylinder, 600-horsepower (447kW), 8-201-A model Winton engine. Like the diesel-electric locomotives that soon displaced the <b>steam</b> <b>locomotive</b> on American railroads, this engine powered an electrical generator; the electricity it generated was then fed to electric traction motors connected to the axles in the train's front truck.|$|E
50|$|<b>Steam</b> <b>locomotives</b> {{are still}} used in Zimbabwe; they have proven so popular with {{tourists}} {{that there are}} plans to refurbish several more <b>steam</b> <b>locomotives.</b> However, funding is constrained, and diesel-hauled freight transport is a higher priority.|$|R
2500|$|In the 19th {{and early}} 20th centuries, most Swedish <b>steam</b> <b>locomotives</b> were {{manufactured}} in Britain. Later, however, most <b>steam</b> <b>locomotives</b> were built by local factories including NOHAB in Trollhättan and ASJ in Falun. One {{of the most}} successful types was the class [...] "B" [...] (4-6-0), inspired by the Prussian class P8. Many of the Swedish <b>steam</b> <b>locomotives</b> were preserved during the Cold War in case of war. During the 1990s, these <b>steam</b> <b>locomotives</b> were sold to non-profit associations or abroad, which is why the Swedish class B, class S (2-6-4) and class E2 (2-8-0) locomotives can now be seen in Britain, the Netherlands, Germany and Canada.|$|R
50|$|Following {{the full}} {{opening of the}} line in 1950, {{passenger}} and freight services on the line were hauled by JNR Class D50 2-8-2 <b>steam</b> <b>locomotives,</b> necessary to negotiate the steep gradients on the line of up 25 ‰. A couple of JNR Class 8620 <b>steam</b> <b>locomotives</b> were also used for shunting at Kamaishi Station. JNR Class C58 2-6-2 <b>steam</b> <b>locomotives</b> were also used on both passenger and freight services running {{to and from the}} Yamada Line. Six JNR Class D51 2-8-2 <b>steam</b> <b>locomotives</b> were subsequently transferred to the line, displacing some of the earlier D50s, but steam haulage on the line was entirely replaced by diesel haulage from March 1967.|$|R
