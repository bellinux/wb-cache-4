500|$|Kosar, {{who wanted}} to play for Cleveland because his family lived {{in a suburb of}} nearby Youngstown, Ohio, signed a five-year {{contract}} worth nearly $6 million in 1985 and was immediately embraced by the Browns organization and the team's fans. [...] "It's not an everyday occurrence that <b>somebody</b> <b>wants</b> to play in Cleveland", Modell said. [...] "This has lent such an aura to Bernie." [...] Kosar saw his first action in the fifth week of the 1985 season against the New England Patriots, when he substituted before halftime for Gary Danielson, a 34-year-old veteran who the Browns had acquired in the offseason from the Lions. Kosar fumbled his first-ever NFL snap, but rebounded and led the team to a 24–20 win. A mix of success and failure followed, but Kosar progressed a bit more each Sunday and led the team to an 8–8 record. Two young running backs, Earnest Byner and Kevin Mack, complemented Kosar's aerial attack with more than 1,000yards rushing each.|$|E

Some sources suggest that Keaton herself was mainly responsible for the look, and Ralph Lauren has often claimed credit, but only one jacket and one tie were purchased from Ralph Lauren for use in the film. Allen recalled that Lauren and Keaton's dress style almost did not end up in the film. [...] "She came in," [...] he recalled in 1992, [...] "and the costume lady on Annie Hall said, 'Tell her not to wear that. She can't wear that. [...] It's so crazy.' And I said, 'Leave her. She's a genius. Let's just leave her alone, let her wear what she wants.'" ...|$|E
