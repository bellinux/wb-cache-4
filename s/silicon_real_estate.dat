This invention describes a means to implement the spindle speed control loop in digital way with a fully integrated filter. It is desirable to design a system capable to include a complete speed control loop in order to alleviate the micro from the task to monitor the speed and correct it. It is also desirable to implement the speed control loop with a digital filter to get flexibility through coefficients setting, reliability (in the case of analog filter, the charge pump pin is a very sensitive node), low cost (measure in terms of <b>silicon</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate),</b> board space and cost reduction with the removal of the passive external components and finally speed accuracy. The implementation described here is a second order IIR filter with setting of three coefficients embedded in a FLL speed control. In Chapter 1 a mathematical model of the spindle motor will be derived. The mechanical and electrical characteristics will be studied in order to obtain a simplified transfer function of the motor. An example with real spindle parameters will be considered and frequency analysis will be performed. Chapter 2 talks about designing of an analog compensator. Based on the desired requirements, a second order filter will be derived. At the end an example describes how the filter improve the performances of the overall system.
