40|$|Abstract. When <b>space</b> <b>points</b> {{and camera}} optical center lie on a twisted cubic, {{no matter how}} many {{corresponding}} pairs there are from <b>space</b> <b>points</b> to their image points, camera projection matrix cannot be uniquely determined, in other words, the configuration of camera and <b>space</b> <b>points</b> in this case is critical for camera parameter estimation. In practice, it is important to detect this critical configuration before the estimated camera parameters are used. In this work, a new method is introduced to detect this critical configuration, which is based on an effective cri-terion function constructed from an invariant relationship between six <b>space</b> <b>points</b> and their corresponding image points. The advantage of this method is that no explicit computation on camera projection matrix or optical center is needed. Simulations show it is quite robust and stable against noise. Experiments on real data show the criterion function can be faithfully trusted for camera parameter estimation. ...|$|R

50|$|In {{probability}} and statistics, a point process operation or point process {{transformation is}} a type of mathematical operation performed on a random object known as a point process, which are often used as mathematical models of phenomena that can be represented as points randomly located in space. These operations can be purely random, deterministic or both, and are used to construct new point processes, which can be then also used as mathematical models. The operations may include removing or thinning points from a point process, combining or superimposing multiple point processes into one point process or transforming the underlying space of the point process into another <b>space.</b> <b>Point</b> process operations and the resulting point processes are used in the theory of point processes and related fields such as stochastic geometry and spatial statistics.|$|E
