5|$|In Atlantic Canada, Bertha brought strong {{tropical}} storm force winds and heavy rainfall. Two weather stations in Braddeck, Nova Scotia and Hunter's Mountain recorded 7inches (177.8mm) of rainfall. In Prince Edward Island, the storm produced a wind gust of 71mph (115km/h) and 4.72inches (101.6mm) of rain. A weather station in Port-aux-Basques, Newfoundland and Labrador reported a wind gust of 63mph (102km/h) and 2.51inches (50mm) of rain. The high winds brought by Bertha caused moderate damage to tobacco and corn crops in Prince Edward Island and damaged a suspension bridge in Nova Scotia.

500|$|Hina was {{the first}} of three {{tropical}} cyclones to affect Tonga during a ten-month period, with Cyclones Keli and Ron affecting the island nation during June 1997 and January 1998. Late on March 15, ahead of the system affecting Tonga, gale warnings were issued for the Southern Tongan island groups of Haʻapai, Tongatapu and Vavaʻu. During the next day, Hina took less than two hours to inflict considerable damage on the Tongan islands and became the worst tropical cyclone to affect Tonga since Cyclone Isaac during 1982.

In this study we investigated damage to catches caused by seals in the inshore gillnet fishery for cod in the central Baltic <b>Sea.</b> <b>Damage</b> by seals includes both visible catch losses such as fish remains found and hidden losses where fish are removed entirely without leaving any visible fish remains in the net.

When hauling the nets, the number of marked fish either damaged or lost was used to calculate the “hid-den ” losses. A total of 324 fleets of nets were set and on 169 of these settings, damaged fish were found in the nets when hauled. 59 previously set fleets were selected for experimental trials in which fish were marked and replaced in the nets in order to estimate the extent of the hidden losses, and 39 of these set fleets were found to have been visited by seals.

40|$|The {{conflict}} between grey seals, Halichoerus grypus, and the Swedish cod fisheries in the Baltic Sea has steadily increased {{during the past}} 10 years. Seals locate the fishermen’s nets, damage the catch and tear holes in the nets. In this study we investigated the damages caused by seals on the net fishery for cod, Gadus morhua, in the central Baltic <b>Sea.</b> <b>Damage</b> includes both the visible damage and the hidden damage i. e. the fish that are taken whole without leaving any visible trace or damages to the nets. To gather the required data an observer joined two professional fishermen {{for a period of}} tree months in 2005. During that period all catch were recorded together with any visible damages. On some experimental links of nets the caught fish were marked without being removed from the net. The net was reset and when retrieved again the number of damaged or lost marked fish was noted. Corrections to the data were made to account for fish that spontaneously fall off. On 101 out of 184 links set out damaged fish were found. Damaged fish was most often found as small remains or with only the head of the fish left. At 20 out of 31 occasions when fish were left in the net, marked fish were missing or found damaged indicating a seal visit. 64. 3 percent of the marked cod were removed from the damaged links without leaving any visible trace, and an additional 10. 1 percent were damaged adding up to a total damage of 74. 4 percent of the catch. There was also a significant difference in catch per effort (cod caught per 100 m* 24 h) between damaged and non-damaged experimental links. Our findings show that the damage to the cod fishery caused by seals is large and that damage can not only be estimated by observing and counting retrieved damaged fish.
