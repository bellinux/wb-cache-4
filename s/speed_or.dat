Due to bus access constraints, the effective throughput of the High Speed signaling rate is limited to 280Mbit/s or 35MB/s.|$|E
5|$|Defeated enemies {{would drop}} {{two types of}} items: cards, which either {{unlocked}} new characters or allowed the player to boost their characters' stats when increasing their level; and bullets, {{which could be used}} on cards that had been increased to their maximum level, to transform them into higher-ranking cards. The player could also find other power-up items scattered in the arenas, which could be used to increase the <b>speed</b> <b>or</b> strength of their characters, recover health points, or make aiming easier.|$|E
5|$|Galileo {{put forward}} the basic {{principle}} of relativity, {{that the laws}} of physics are the same in any system that is moving at a constant speed in a straight line, regardless of its particular <b>speed</b> <b>or</b> direction. Hence, there is no absolute motion or absolute rest. This principle provided the basic framework for Newton's laws of motion and is central to Einstein's special theory of relativity.|$|E

5|$|In 1914, Franck {{teamed up}} with Hertz to perform an {{experiment}} to investigate fluorescence. They designed a vacuum tube for studying energetic electrons that flew through a thin vapour of mercury atoms. They discovered that when an electron collided with a mercury atom it could lose only a specific quantity (4.9electron volts) of its kinetic energy before flying away. A faster electron does not decelerate completely after a collision, but loses precisely {{the same amount of}} its kinetic energy. Slower electrons just bounce off mercury atoms without losing any significant <b>speed</b> <b>or</b> kinetic energy.|$|E
5|$|One {{study has}} shown {{theoretically}} that, while a bike leaned in a turn, road undulations can excite the weave mode at high <b>speed</b> <b>or</b> the wobble mode {{at low speed}} if either of their frequencies match the vehicle speed and other parameters. Excitation of the wobble mode can be mitigated by an effective steering damper and excitation of the weave mode is worse for light riders than for heavy riders.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} armed with four 30-calibre BL 13.5-inch Mk I–IV guns in two twin gun turrets, one each {{fore and aft}} of the superstructure. Each gun was {{provided}} with 80 shells per gun. Hoods secondary armament consisted of ten 40-calibre 6-inch Mk I-III guns mounted in casemates in the superstructure. A major problem with the four of these guns mounted on the upper deck {{was that they were}} mounted low in the ship and were unusable at high <b>speed</b> <b>or</b> in heavy weather. They were removed as useless in 1904. The ship carried 200 rounds for each gun.|$|E

5|$|The turn-based battles are {{triggered}} through random encounters. The {{player has}} several options, including fighting and fleeing from battle. The number of enemies are indicated by small sprites {{on the bottom}} of the battle screen. During their turn in combat, the protagonist and current companion can perform an action such as attacking using melee or ranged attacks such as magic, or use an item which can weaken the enemy or strengthen the player party. Upon successfully completing a battle, the party is awarded with experience points, skill points, items and money. Skill points are assigned to the protagonist's attributes such as <b>speed</b> <b>or</b> magic, modifying future performance in battle.|$|E
5|$|To {{eliminate}} this danger, if a USB hub detects {{a mix of}} high <b>speed</b> <b>or</b> {{full speed}} and low speed devices, it will by default disable communication to low speed device unless requested to switch to low speed mode. On reception of a PRE packet however, it will temporarily re-enable the output port to all low speed devices, to allow the host to send a single low speed packet to low speed devices. After the low speed packet is sent, an end of packet (EOP) signal will tell the hub to disable all outputs to low speed devices again.|$|E
5|$|While {{remaining}} upright may be {{the primary}} goal of beginning riders, a bike must lean in order to maintain balance in a turn: the higher the <b>speed</b> <b>or</b> smaller the turn radius, the more lean is required. This balances the roll torque about the wheel contact patches generated by centrifugal force due to the turn with that of the gravitational force. This lean is usually produced by a momentary steering in the opposite direction, called countersteering. Countersteering skill is usually acquired by motor learning and executed via procedural memory rather than by conscious thought. Unlike other wheeled vehicles, the primary control input on bikes is steering torque, not position.|$|E

5|$|A precise search {{area was}} {{difficult}} to define, as even small differences in estimates of the aircraft's <b>speed,</b> <b>or</b> the environmental conditions along the flight path (which varied significantly by location and altitude), changed Cooper's projected landing point considerably. An important variable was {{the length of time}} he remained in free fall before pulling his rip cord—if indeed he succeeded in opening a parachute at all. Neither of the Air Force fighter pilots saw anything exit the airliner, either visually or on radar, nor did they see a parachute open; but at night, with extremely limited visibility and cloud cover obscuring any ground lighting below, an airborne human figure clad entirely in black clothing could easily have gone undetected. The T-33 pilots never made visual contact with the 727 at all.|$|E
5|$|Both {{enemies and}} their bullets can be shot down. Defeating enemies will {{sometimes}} reveal item boxes, which can hold precious metals such as {{gold and silver}} for extra points, and bombs. Only five bombs can be held at a time, {{which can be used}} to clear the screen of enemies. Weapon upgrades may appear after defeating certain enemies. These weapons, such as shotguns and machine guns, will increase the player's firing <b>speed</b> <b>or</b> damage output. When a player's bullets hit an enemy, a gauge {{at the bottom of the}} screen will gradually fill. Once filled, the player will be awarded with a Vulcan gun, the most powerful weapon in the game which grants invincibility. The gauge will then begin to deplete and the Vulcan gun will disappear once empty.|$|E
5|$|Each planet {{offers a}} {{possible}} quest or {{challenge to the}} player. Challenges are tactical battles in which the player must fight against a variety of enemies. However, ships can only be harmed from behind or below; attacks from any other position will be countered by the ships' shields. Upon succeeding, a new chapter {{is added to the}} player's character's story, and the player is rewarded with ship upgrades. These upgrades are used to customize ships with improvements, such as increased firing <b>speed</b> <b>or</b> heavier rear armor. The upgrades available to the player upon finishing each encounter with an enemy can vary, so the player may not receive the same upgrade by playing the same encounter in two different adventures. Flotilla has cooperative and split-screen multiplayer modes that can be played with an additional Xbox 360 controller.|$|E

5|$|The player gains {{points by}} {{defeating}} multiple enemies consecutively and {{can participate in}} a bonus round to gain more points. Enemies are defeated by kicking them over once they have been flipped on their back. This is accomplished by hitting the platform the enemy is on directly beneath them. If the player allows too much time to pass after doing this, the enemy will flip itself back over, changing in color and increasing speed. Each phase has {{a certain number of}} enemies, with the final enemy immediately changing color and increasing to maximum speed. Hitting a flipped enemy from underneath causes it to right itself and start moving again, but it does not change <b>speed</b> <b>or</b> color.|$|E
5|$|Many {{actors were}} {{considered}} to replace Reeves including: Simon Baker Denny, Jon Bon Jovi, Patrick Muldoon, Johnathon Schaech, Christian Slater, and Billy Zane. Bullock initially suggested Matthew McConaughey, who passed on the role, prompting her to suggest Jason Patric, {{with whom she had}} wanted to work since seeing his performance in After Dark, My Sweet (1990). De Bont was skeptical of featuring a relatively unknown actor such as Patric, but was reminded by the studio that Bullock and Reeves were also relatively unknown prior to Speed, and ultimately chose Patric based on his role in Sleepers (1996). Patric was paid a reported $4.5–$8 million for his role in Speed2 and used his salary to finance a 1998 drama, Your Friends & Neighbors. After accepting the role, Patric stated that he never saw <b>Speed</b> <b>or</b> had any intentions of seeing it; Reeves said he was looking forward to seeing Patric star in the sequel. After Reeves declined to appear in Speed2, the screenplay was rewritten to remove his character from the story, which De Bont wanted to deal with early in the film. His absence is explained in the first scene, where Annie talks about how her relationship with Jack did not work out, and mentions her current relationship with Alex (Patric), before his character is introduced in the film.|$|E
5|$|Ideas {{from the}} Deep, now {{formally}} established as id Software, {{used some of}} these to prototype ideas for their own games. Adrian Carmack used them to push his preferred, dark art style, while John Carmack began to experiment with 3D computer graphics, which until then was largely the purview of flight simulation games such as Wing Commander (1990). Carmack found that this was {{largely due to the}} limitations of personal computers of the time, which had difficulty displaying a fast action game in 3D due to the number of surfaces it needed to calculate. During 1991, he experimented with limiting the possible surfaces the computer needed to display, creating game levels with walls designed only on a flat grid rather than with arbitrary shapes or angles. He also took the unusual approach of creating the displayed graphics through ray casting, in which only the surfaces visible to the player were calculated rather than the entire area surrounding the player. After six weeks of development, Carmack had created a rudimentary 3D game engine that used animated 2D sprites for enemies. Id Software then used the engine for the April 1991 Softdisk game Hovertank 3D, in which the player drives a tank through a plane of colored walls and shoots nuclear monsters. In the fall of 1991, after the team—sans Wilbur—had relocated to Madison, Wisconsin, and he had largely finished the engine work for Commander Keen in Goodbye, Galaxy, Carmack learned about , a role-playing game in development by Blue Sky Productions. Ultima Underworld was planned to display texture-mapped 3D graphics without Hovertanks restrictions of flat walls and simple lighting. Deciding that he could add texture mapping without sacrificing the engine's <b>speed</b> <b>or</b> greatly increasing the system requirements as Underworld was doing, Carmack enhanced the engine over six weeks from Hovertank 3D for another Softdisk game, the November 1991 Catacomb 3-D. Upon seeing it, Scott Miller of Apogee began to push the team to make a 3D shareware action game.|$|E
