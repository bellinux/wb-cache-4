5|$|Although Taft was {{successful}} as <b>Solicitor</b> <b>General,</b> winning 15 of the 18 cases he argued before the Supreme Court, {{he was glad}} when in March 1891, the United States Congress created a new judgeship {{for each of the}} United States Courts of Appeal and Harrison appointed him to the Sixth Circuit, based in Cincinnati. In March 1892, Taft resigned as <b>Solicitor</b> <b>General</b> to resume his judicial career.|$|E
5|$|Murray had {{repeatedly}} refused {{to become a}} Member of Parliament, saying he {{had no interest in}} politics. In 1742, however, the government of Sir Robert Walpole fell, and Murray's brother-in-law, the Earl of Nottingham, became First Lord of the Admiralty in the new Cabinet. With this added political influence, Murray hoped to be appointed to a government office, and when Sir John Strange resigned as <b>Solicitor</b> <b>General,</b> Murray was made a Member of Parliament for Boroughbridge on 15 December 1742 and immediately succeeded Strange as <b>Solicitor</b> <b>General.</b>|$|E

5|$|In response, Assistant to the <b>Solicitor</b> <b>General</b> Matthew D.

Following a promotion to Attorney General he led the prosecution in several notable cases, including those against Robert Devereux, Sir Walter Raleigh, and the Gunpowder Plot conspirators. As a reward for his services he was first knighted and then made Chief Justice of the Common Pleas.|$|E
5|$|Monsanto {{argued that}} the Federal Circuit's {{decision}} was correct because Bowman had created a new product that infringed on their patent. They further argued {{that this was not}} an appropriate case to hear, as the decision was not decided on patent exhaustion via a conditional sale. The Supreme Court requested the United States to brief the Court, and the <b>Solicitor</b> <b>General</b> filed a brief generally in support of the Monsanto position. The United States asked the Court to deny certiorari. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on October 5, 2012.|$|E

5|$|The debating {{chamber of}} the Scottish Parliament has seating {{arranged}} in a hemicycle, a design which is common across European legislatures, intended to encourage consensus and compromise.

As such, the Law Officers may attend and speak in the plenary meetings of the Parliament but, as they are not elected MSPs, cannot vote.|$|E
