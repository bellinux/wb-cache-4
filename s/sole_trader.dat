25|$|Companies {{occupy a}} special place in private law, because they have a legal {{personality}} separate from those who invest their capital and labour to run the business. The general rules of contract, tort and unjust enrichment operate in the first place against the company as a distinct entity. This differs fundamentally from other forms of business association. A <b>sole</b> <b>trader</b> acquires rights and duties as normal under the general law of obligations. If people carry on business together with a view to profit, they are deemed to have formed a partnership under the Partnership Act 1890 section 1. Like a <b>sole</b> <b>trader,</b> partners will be liable on any contract or tort obligation jointly and severally in shares equal to their monetary contribution, or according to their culpability. Law, accountancy and actuarial firms are commonly organised as partnerships. Since the Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2000, partners can limit the amount they are liable for to their monetary investment in the business, if the partnership owes more money than the enterprise has. Outside these professions, however, the most common method for businesses to limit their liability is by forming a company.|$|E
2500|$|Southard {{built his}} first shipa {{schooner}} named Texasbefore {{the age of}} 29 (in about 1837). He then designed {{a series of small}} [...] "coasters" [...] intended for the Southern coastal trade, with names such as Savannah, Richmond and Wilmington. According to Little's Genealogy, Southard then formed a partnership with a talented young shipbuilder named Stanwood Alexander, the two of them building sixteen ships together from 1845 until Alexander's death in 1852. Southard then continued as a <b>sole</b> <b>trader,</b> operating the business under the name T. J. Southard & Co..|$|E
6000|$|In the meantime, the State was {{tightening}} {{its grip}} upon {{the land with}} its products, and was working up the system which was destined to produce such grim results in the near future. The independent traders were discouraged and stamped out, Belgium, as well as Dutch, English and French. Some of the loudest protests against the new order may be taken from Belgian sources. Everywhere, in flagrant disregard of the Treaty of Berlin, the State proclaimed itself to be the sole landlord and the <b>sole</b> <b>trader.</b> In some cases it worked its own so-called property, in other cases it leased it. Even those who had striven to help King Leopold in the earlier stages of his enterprise were thrown overboard. Major Parminter, himself engaged in trade upon the Congo, sums up the situation in 1902 as follows: [...] "To sum up, {{the application of the}} new decrees of the Government signifies this: that the State considers as its private property the whole of the Congo Basin, excepting the sites of the natives' villages and gardens. It decrees that all the products of this immense region are its private property, and it monopolizes the trade in them. As regards the primitive proprietors, the native tribes, they are dispossessed by a simple circular; permission is graciously granted to them to collect such products, but only on condition that they bring them for sale to the State for whatever the latter may be pleased to give them. As regards alien traders, they are prohibited in all this territory from trading with the natives." ...|$|E

50|$|An {{example is}} a <b>sole</b> <b>trader</b> or one-man {{business}}(proprietorship): the <b>sole</b> <b>trader</b> takes money from the business by way of 'drawings': money for his own personal use. Despite it being his business and technically his money, there are still two aspects to the transaction: the business is 'giving' money and the individual is 'receiving' money. Even {{though there is no}} other legal distinction between the <b>sole</b> <b>trader</b> and the business, and the <b>sole</b> <b>trader</b> is liable for all of the debts of the business, business transactions will probably still be taxed separately from personal transactions, and the proprietor of the business may also find it useful to see the financial results of the business. For these reasons, the affairs of the individuals behind a business should be kept separate from the affairs of the business itself.|$|E
