[...] In a 7 November 2014 interview with SiriusXM's Town Hall series, Page confirmed again that he did not play on the song, saying [...] "Oh, Crikey! I wasn't on 'You Really Got Me,' but I did play on the Kinks' records. That's all I'm going to say about it. But every time I do an interview, people ask me about 'You Really Got Me.' <b>So</b> <b>maybe</b> somebody can correct Wikipedia so people won't keep asking me." ...|$|E

500|$|Marvel Studios co-president Louis D’Esposito later {{stated that}} Marvel was {{considering}} {{the idea of}} introducing established characters who may not yet be ready to carry their own feature films in future One-Shots, stating, [...] "There’s always a potential to introduce a character. We have 8,000 of them, and they can’t all be at the same level. <b>So</b> <b>maybe</b> {{there are some that}} are not so popular, and we introduce them [...] – and they take off. I could see that happening." [...] When asked whether a Marvel superhero would ever appear in a One-Shot, D'Esposito replied that [...] "We would love to, but it’s difficult because there’s a cost to that. If Iron Man is flying around doing something, that [...] very costly. And first of all, what’s the story? Is it important that that superhero is in the story?" ...|$|E
500|$|It {{was later}} {{revealed}} that Harkins had {{reported in a}} cable that Wilson had seen him around 15:00 on behalf of Khánh to determine whether Washington would support a [...] "counter-coup" [...] against those who [...] "planned to seize control and immediately announce a position of neutralization". Harkins stated that he ordered Wilson to report to Lodge. Harkins then reported that he was undertaking [...] "a field trip", believed to {{be an attempt to}} lobby Saigon-based forces to join the coup. Harkins was later reported to have said in response to Khánh's asking whether he objected to a coup, [...] "No, I think you are a very fine general." [...] Afterwards, when asked why he had not tipped off the junta, Harkins said that the ruling officers [...] "weren't getting along anyway, <b>so</b> <b>maybe</b> it was a change for the better. I thought it was." ...|$|E
500|$|Back in Los Angeles, Beck {{began to}} work at a video store in Silver Lake [...] "doing things like {{alphabetizing}} the pornography section". He began performing in arthouse clubs and coffeehouses such as Al's Bar and Raji's. In order to keep indifferent audiences engaged in his music, Beck would play in a spontaneous, joking manner. [...] "I'd be banging away on a Son House tune and the whole audience would be talking. <b>So</b> <b>maybe</b> out of desperation or boredom, or the audience's boredom, I'd make up these ridiculous songs just to see if people were listening," [...] he later remarked. Virtually an unknown to the public and an enigma to those who met him, Beck would hop onstage between acts in local clubs and play [...] "strange folk songs", accompanied by [...] "what could best be described as performance art" [...] while sometimes wearing a Star Wars stormtrooper mask. Beck met someone who offered to help record demos in his living room, and he began to pass cassette tapes around.|$|E

500|$|In August 2011, Marvel {{announced}} {{a series of}} direct-to-video short films called Marvel One-Shots, the name derived from the label used by Marvel Comics for their one-shot comics. Co-producer Brad Winderbaum said [...] "It's a fun way to experiment with new characters and ideas, but more importantly it's a {{way for us to}} expand the Marvel Cinematic Universe and tell stories that live outside the plot of our features." [...] Each short film is designed to be a self-contained story that provides more backstory for characters or events introduced in the films. In July 2012, D'Esposito stated that Marvel was considering the idea of introducing established characters who may not yet be ready to carry their own feature films in future One-Shots, stating, [...] "There's always a potential to introduce a character. We have 8,000 of them, and they can't all be at the same level. <b>So</b> <b>maybe</b> there are some that are not so popular, and we introduce them [...] – and they take off.

500|$|... "Two Black Cadillacs" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Billy Dukes of Taste of Country stated that [...] "vocally, Underwood is brilliant as always, and lyrically, she, Hillary Lindsey and Josh Kear have penned a tight story", but {{went on to}} say that [...] "compared to Underwood's other hits, this song doesn't stand out after one digests the macabre storyline. <b>So,</b> <b>maybe</b> it'll only sell a million singles and reach No. 2", giving the song three-and-a-half stars. Daryl Addison of Great American Country praised the song, saying that [...] "even with heavy thematic elements, the songs impressively maintain a pop/crossover shine and accessible sound, courtesy of Carrie's pristine voice and modern delivery." [...] Writing for Country Universe, Kevin Coyne gave the song an A, complimenting the singer's versatility, saying that [...] "it's a credit to her ambition as an artist. For someone so frequently accused of getting to the top without having to earn it, she continues to work harder than the rest of her peers just to stay there." ...|$|E
500|$|The Simpsons writer Mike Reiss {{feels that}} episodes such as [...] "Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment" [...] are his {{favorite}} episodes to write {{because they have}} a [...] "solid theme or an issue" [...] (in this case, religion and theft), that one can [...] "discuss endlessly and just have it present itself in so many different ways." [...] Producer Jeff Martin said that the writers tried to use a [...] "very strict construction of the Eighth Commandment," [...] considering cable theft to be [...] "essentially a victimless crime." [...] "Homer vs. the 8th Commandment" [...] was produced at a time when illegal cable hookups were becoming commonplace in many homes. This episode later inspired the season four episode [...] "Homer the Heretic", in which Homer stops going to church on Sundays. Based on the Fourth Commandment, [...] "remember the Sabbath and keep it holy", that episode originated when Jean commented to Reiss, [...] "We had a lot of luck with Homer stealing cable, <b>so</b> <b>maybe</b> we could look to other commandments?" ...|$|E

500|$|Her thirteenth album, Reba, {{was issued}} in 1988 {{and was not}} well {{received}} by critics, who claimed she was moving farther away from her [...] "traditional country" [...] sound. Stereo Review disliked the album's contemporary style, stating, [...] "After years of insisting that she'd stick to hard-core country 'because I have tried the contemporary-type songs, and it's not Reba McEntire—it's just not honest,' McEntirehas gone whole-hog pop. The album peaked at No. 1 on the Top Country Albums chart and remained there for six consecutive weeks. Okay, <b>so</b> <b>maybe</b> that's not so terrible." [...] Although it was reviewed poorly, the album itself was certified platinum in sales and produced two number-one singles: [...] "I Know How He Feels" [...] and [...] "New Fool at an Old Game". In addition, the release's cover version of Jo Stafford's [...] "A Sunday Kind of Love" [...] became a Top 5 hit on the Billboard country music chart. Also in 1988, McEntire founded Starstruck Entertainment, which controlled her management, booking, publishing, promotion, publicity, accounting, ticket sales, and fan club administration. The company would eventually expand into managing a horse farm, jet charter service, trucking, construction, and book publishing.|$|E
500|$|Ted Shackelford, {{who plays}} Gary, {{described}} the love story, [...] "I can't complain. I mean, Gary spent {{six or seven}} years being led down the primrose path by one stupid broad after another. So with Val... You'd think after 13 years, at the age they are [...] and the amount of bullshit they've been through, they would have learned something! They'd probably have a very comfortable life by now. But it makes for a dead story line." [...] When asked about working with Van Ark, he said: [...] "I don't know how it could get any better. [...] She's remarkable, and I'm not blowing smoke up your ass. I'd tell you if I thought she was a pain in the ass, although sometimes she is a pain in the ass. But my best work is done with Joan." [...] Van Ark also discussed Valene's relationship with her daughter, Lucy Ewing. She said, [...] "The spine or the beginning of the series was Gary and Val, coming over from Dallas, <b>so</b> <b>maybe</b> there should have been more Lucy. I do know that CBS and the producers of both shows wanted to keep the two shows separate but in the beginning you had Larry Hagman and others going over to Knots." ...|$|E
500|$|Connor again {{returns for}} Angel:After the Fall. Brian Lynch was {{initially}} confused {{about how to}} incorporate Connor into the story. It was Whedon who hit upon the arc that Connor would follow in the series. He said, [...] "Connor's a young kid, he's got powers, he doesn't {{have any of the}} bad things, he's not a vampire, <b>so</b> <b>maybe</b> he would enjoy it, and maybe he would be {{the closest thing to a}} superhero hell has". Well-adjusted now, Connor is shown [...] "fully embracing his qualities and role of a hero" [...] for the comic series. Originally Lynch had planned for Nina Ash to be more involved in his storyline, but with time it became clear to him that Connor's story is more about his relationship with Angel. So Nina fell to the wayside and Connor-Angel went on to become a much closer father-son unit. Connor also went from the character Lynch had the most trouble with to the character he enjoys writing most. Regarding Connor's upcoming role in Angel & Faith, Whedon joked about time-traveling him to the early 1960s and making him an ad executive, referencing Kartheiser 's recent role in the critically acclaimed television series Mad Men. Author Christos Gage describes the necessity of Connor's appearance with [...] "otherwise Angel is just a deadbeat Dad!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So that ye can be {{charitable}} in some ways!" [...] He laughed softly. [...] "Glory be, now, I {{should be}} thankful for <b>so</b> much. <b>Maybe</b> I'm presumptuous.

5000|$|The romantic side is {{just such}} a sweet thing and I love it. Their storyline is so, so, so endearing, and I always enjoy working with Jacob (Anderson). He's just wonderful. <b>So</b> to <b>maybe</b> explore that some more would be really fun. It's so nice to watch. Whenever I see our scenes together, or our little moments together, I'm always like, [...] "yay." [...] It makes me really happy.|$|R
500|$|This episode {{originated}} when Al Jean commented to Mike Reiss, [...] "We {{had a lot}} of {{luck with}} Homer stealing cable, which was based on the eighth commandment, <b>so</b> <b>maybe</b> we could look to other commandments. So we thought, 'Honor the Sabbath' would be a good one. So the 'Homer doesn't go to church' storyline was given to George Meyer." [...] Reiss and Jean thought that as a lapsed Catholic, Meyer would [...] "bring the proper degree of rage" [...] to the episode. Meyer {{had a lot of}} fun making the episode, thinking that most people could relate to the bliss of staying home from church. One of the main problems Meyer had writing this episode is that whenever Homer saw God, he had to have fallen asleep so that it appeared to be a dream. Meyer did not want to show that God was literally appearing to Homer. This resulted in him falling asleep so many times during the first draft of the episode that it was almost as if Homer had narcolepsy. This was also the first episode from season four that was read to the production team. Although first reads on previous seasons had not been well received by the production team, [...] "Homer the Heretic" [...] read very well, particularly some of the visuals in the third act, such as the house on fire and Homer being rescued by Flanders.|$|E
500|$|... "I Am the Walrus" [...] was {{met with}} mostly {{positive}} reviews from critics. Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave the episode a positive review. In his review for the episode, he opined: [...] "The episode itself didn't disappoint either, as [...] this was a quality half-hour of jokes. Kaiser praised the argument between Stan and Steve, calling it a [...] "superb sequence". Concluding his review, Kaiser went on to write, [...] "Despite all the absurdity, the episode even manages to successfully come around to an emotional resolution when Stan, realizing that Steve is an utter failure at attempted mating, resolves to see Steve as a son instead of potential masculine competition. Then [...] there's a rape joke. But, it being American Dad, it's actually a surprisingly funny rape joke." [...] He went on to give the episode an [...] "A-", scoring higher than The Simpsons episode [...] "Love Is a Many Strangled Thing", but scoring lower than Bob's Burgers episode [...] "Spaghetti Western and Meatballs". Jason Hughes of TV Squad also reacted positively, writing, [...] "It was good to have American Dad back in the lineup. Roger was in fine form, and I can at least appreciate that they're {{trying to figure out}} how to make Hayley and Jeff work in the family dynamic. They never quite got there with Hayley alone, <b>so</b> <b>maybe</b> things will work better this way." [...] However, he was more critical on the sub-plot. In his review for the episode, Hughes opined: [...] "The B-story left me wanting. The writers are still trying to figure out the new dynamic of having Hayley married and Jeff living in the house with the Smiths. The whole thing has been barely addressed, and this week we got a fairly weak exploration of them having fairly standard marital problems." ...|$|E
500|$|The voice cast {{was signed}} on to do the film in 2001, and work then began on the script. The {{producers}} were initially worried that creating a film would {{have a negative effect}} on the series, as they did not have enough crew to focus their attention on both projects. As the series progressed, additional writers and animators were hired so that both the show and the film could be produced at the same time. Groening and James L. Brooks invited back Mike Scully and Al Jean (who continued to work as showrunner on the television series) to produce the film with them. They then signed David Silverman (who, in anticipation of the project, had quit his job at Pixar) to direct the film. The [...] "strongest possible" [...] writing team was assembled, with many of the writers from the show's early seasons being chosen. David Mirkin, Mike Reiss, George Meyer, John Swartzwelder, and Jon Vitti were selected. Ian Maxtone-Graham and Matt Selman joined later, and Brooks, Groening, Scully, and Jean also wrote parts of the script. Sam Simon did not return having left the show over creative differences in 1993. Former writer Conan O'Brien expressed interest in working with the Simpsons staff again, although he later joked that [...] "I worry that the Simpsons-writing portion of my brain has been destroyed after 14 years of talking to Lindsay Lohan and that guy from One Tree Hill, <b>so</b> <b>maybe</b> it's all for the best." [...] The same went for director Brad Bird who said he had [...] "entertained fantasies of asking if [...] could work on the movie", but did not have enough time due to work on Ratatouille. The producers arranged a deal with Fox that would allow them to abandon production of the film at any point if they felt the script was unsatisfactory.|$|E
5000|$|Really, after '78 {{things went}} {{downhill}} for us. I don't {{know what it}} was.

5000|$|Yet Wegner {{does all}} of the above with a sense of light-heartedness. As he states in a 2007 interview, “I’d like the humor of the work to make itself {{available}} to you slowly, <b>so</b> that <b>maybe</b> a couple hours after you’ve been exposed to it, it’s still sinking in. You’re not actually laughing until the second or third day, and by that time, you can’t quite remember what was funny.” ...|$|R

500|$|Jordan Farley from SFX {{magazine}} {{named the}} episode the eighth of the [...] "Top Groundhog Days" [...] episodes. Farley applauded the show's gall to seemingly kill {{one of the}} leads in the teaser and appreciated the entry's mix of humor—during the scenes with Mulder and his water bed—and its alternative scenarios in the bank. Natalie Prado from Just Press Play gave the episode an A– and wrote, [...] "The episode is well-written and tense. As an audience, we become increasingly frustrated that the two people that we know can solve the problem are unaware that it exists, which makes the payoff when they finally {{find a way out}} much more satisfying. There are a few leaps in logic, especially towards the end, but overall it’s solid and enjoyable." [...] Jamie Jeffords, writing for the Dallas Morning News, awarded the episode four out of five stars and praised Hamilton's performance, saying, [...] "What makes 'Monday’ is the performance of Hamilton [...] When she is killed in the end, she almost possesses a quiet glee when she realizes her death never happened before, <b>so</b> <b>maybe</b> it is over now. Her performance is haunting. Very powerful." [...] Michigan Daily writer Melissa Runstrom, in a review of the sixth season, said [...] "Monday" [...] was [...] "well made and entertaining." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a largely positive review and awarded it three-and-a-half stars out of four. Vitaris called the episode [...] "ingenious and heart-wrenching," [...] and noted that David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson's acting was the best of the season. Furthermore, she praised Kim Manners' directing style, calling the same scenes shot in different ways [...] "new". UGO Networks listed the episode as number 95 in a countdown of the [...] "100 Greatest Moments in Time Travel".|$|E

2500|$|The film also {{contains}} motifs from Greek mythology, in which gods manipulate humans {{in a higher}} agenda.
