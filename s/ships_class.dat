5000|$|In the 21st century, [...] "tall ship" [...] {{is often}} used generically for large, classic, sailing vessels, but is also a {{technically}} defined term by Sail Training International for its purposes and of course, STI helped popularize the term. The exact definitions have changed somewhat over time, and are subject to various technicalities, but by 2011 there were 4 classes (A, B, C, and D). Basically {{there are only two}} size classes, A is over 40 m LOA, and B/C/D are 9.14 m to under 40 m LOA. The definitions have to do with rigging: class A is for square sail rigged <b>ships,</b> <b>class</b> B is for [...] "traditionally rigged" [...] <b>ships,</b> <b>class</b> C is for [...] "modern rigged" [...] vessels with no [...] "spinnaker-like sails", and class D is the same as class C but carrying a spinnaker-like sail.

40|$|The West Valley Demonstration Project (WVDP) has {{successfully}} pretreated and vitrified {{nearly all of}} the 600, 000 gallons of liquid high-level radioactive waste that was generated {{at the site of the}} only commercial nuclear fuel reprocessing plant to have operated in the United States. Low-level waste (LLW) generated during the course of the cleanup effort now requires disposal. Currently the WVDP only <b>ships</b> <b>Class</b> A LLW for off-site disposal. It has been shipping Class A wastes to Envirocare of Utah, Inc. since 1997. However, the WVDP may also have a future need to ship Class B and Class C waste, which Envirocare is not currently authorized to accept. The Nevada Test Site (NTS), a U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) facility, can accept all three waste classifications. The WVDP set a goal to receive certification to begin shipping Class A wastes to NTS by 2001. Formal certification/approval was granted by the DOE Nevada Operations Office on July 12, 2001. This paper discusses how the WVDP contractor, West Valley Nuclear Services Company (WVNSCO), completed the activities required to achieve NTS certification in 2001 to ship waste to its facility. The information and lessons learned provided are significant because the WVDP is the only new generator receiving certification based on an NTS audit in January 2001 that resulted in no findings and only two observations [...] a rating that is unparalleled in the DOE Complex...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The U. S. Navy has {{established}} a Probability of Raid Annihilation (PRA) Assessment Process {{to be used for}} each new <b>ship</b> <b>class.</b> Papers presented at previous SIW meetings have described the PRA and the development of certain aspects of the PRA Assessment Process, including the PRA Federation Testbed. This paper provides an overview of the total PRA Assessment Process to illustrate how the process provides the PRA <b>ship</b> <b>class</b> results to meet OPEVAL requirements across <b>ship</b> <b>classes</b> in a consistent and adequate manner. The PRA Assessment Process as applied to each new <b>ship</b> <b>class</b> will build on the products and results, including the PRA Federation Testbed as implemented, from previous <b>ship</b> <b>class</b> work. To facilitate this reuse, all relevant material, collectively referred to as the PRA Assessment Process Standards and Architecture (PS&A), is documented in one module. The PS&A module is the roadmap for any new <b>ship</b> <b>class’s</b> program manager and technical team to implement the PRA Assessment Process, including documentation and products. The PS&A shows how the steps in the PRA Assessment Process correlate to the steps in the FEderation Development &...|$|R

40|$|Design and {{optimization}} of the {{propulsion system}} is a crucial task of the ship design. In fact the behaviour of the propulsion {{system is a}} key aspect of the global behaviour of a ship, mainly if the ship is a naval vessel. Simulation techniques can be very effective to predict the propulsion plant behaviour during normal working conditions as well as during critical situations. Numerical simulation gives the possibility to foresee, at design stage, the behaviour of the ship propulsion plant during manoeuvres and gives the designer the possibility to optimise {{the choice of the}} system parameters (choice of a suitable pitch/r. p. m. combination law, engine governor calibration, scantling of the shaft line) in order to prevent engine and mechanical overloads or faults. Moreover by simulation it is possible to study and optimise the machinery control system. The paper presents a comprehensive approach to simulate the propulsion system behaviour during transients and off design conditions to be used for the control system setting and overall ship propulsion plants study. The presented approach was successfully used for the design of the new high speed Italian Frigates FREMM class. This <b>ships</b> <b>class</b> has a new propulsion plant concept: the COmbined Diesel eLectric And Gas (CODLAG) type, with single gear and two shaft lines. The application presented in this paper concerns the design of the propulsion control system with a detailed simulation of the Gas Turbine Control System (TCS) and of the controllable pitch propeller system. A comparison between simulation transients results and reference data is reported in the paper...|$|E
40|$|Na engenharia mecânica há cada vez mais necessidade de utilizar e de prever o comportamento das máquinas térmicas, mais propriamente dos motores de combustão interna, em especial na área da manutenção e da prevenção de falha num dos componentes vitais de um motor a 4 tempos: o veio de manivelas. Esta situação já tem sido bastante observada na indústria mecânica naval, nomeadamente na Marinha Portuguesa e, devido ao seu elevado grau de importância no desempenho de qualquer motor, decidiu-se focar o trabalho desta tese no estudo dos motores {{a diesel}} S. E. M. T Pielstick das unidades navais da Marinha Portuguesa, mais especificamente das corvetas da classe “João Coutinho” e da classe “ Baptista de Andrade”, devido ao historial de ocorrência de falhas no veio de manivelas nesta classe de navios e em outras da Marinha Portuguesa. Para efetuar este estudo, utilizaram-se todos os dados relativos ao historial de ocorrências de falhas destes motores, bem como todos os dados disponíveis do fabricante destes motores, por forma a reproduzir da forma mais fiável possível um modelo {{tridimensional}} do veio de manivelas no programa de modelação informática CAD Solidworks®, e possibilitar a análise cinemática do veio de manivelas. Desta forma, foi possível simular as condições de funcionamento do motor, assim como analisar e determinar {{a causa de}} falha do veio de manivelas, visando prolongar a vida útil dos veios de manivelas, contribuindo não só para menores custos de manutenção mas também para o aumento da operacionalidade destes navios. In mechanical engineering there is an increasingly growing need to know and predict the behaviour of thermal machines more specifically of internal combustion engines. One of these behaviours concerns about the maintenance area and is the prevention of failure in a crankshaft, one of the vital components of a 4 -stroke engine. This is a situation widely observed in the marine engineering industry, particularly in the Portuguese Navy and due to it´s high degree of importance {{in the performance of}} any engine, including naval engines such as the engines of Navy ships, it was decided to focus this work in the Portuguese Navy ships. In this particular case, the aim is to study the S. E. M. T Pielstick diesel engines from the Portuguese Navy <b>ships</b> <b>class</b> “João Coutinho” and “Baptista de Andrade”, due to the crankshaft failure history in this class and other classes of Portuguese Navy ships. To perform this study, we used all the data that was related to the engines’ failure history, as well as all the available data from the engine manufacturer in order to model as accurately as possible 3 D model the crankshaft in the modelling and simulation computer program CAD SOLIDWORKS® in order to analyse the crankshaft through the finite elements method. Therefore it was possible to simulate the most representative engine operation conditions obtaining in the most detailed way the operating data and internal behaviour of these engines to thereby analyse and determine the cause of failure of the crankshaft. The performed numerical simulations consisted of cinematic analysis of the crankshaft in order to characterize the quality of the manufacture and determine the failure causes, in order to promote possible changes in the crankshaft geometry to minimize the stress concentration and therefore extend the longevity of these crankshafts, contributing not only to reduce the maintenance costs of this crankshafts but also to increase the operability of the Portuguese Navy ships using them...|$|E
