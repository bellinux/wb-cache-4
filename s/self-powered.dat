5|$|Some {{humanitarian}} {{organizations like}} Ears to Our World distribute portable, <b>self-powered</b> shortwave radios to less developed {{parts of the}} globe, enabling people in remote, impoverished {{parts of the world}} to get educational programming, local and international news, emergency information and music. Recently, the group was involved in sending radios to Haiti so victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake could stay abreast of local disaster recovery efforts.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the {{ambulance}} begins in ancient times, {{with the use of}} carts to transport incurable patients by force. Ambulances were first used for emergency transport in 1487 by the Spanish, and civilian variants were put into operation during the 1830s. Advances in technology throughout the 19th and 20th centuries led to the modern <b>self-powered</b> ambulances.|$|E
5|$|A bus-powered hub is a {{high-power}} device providing low-power ports. It draws 1 {{unit load}} for the hub controller and 1 unit load {{for each of}} at most 4 ports. The hub may also have some non-removable functions in place of ports. A <b>self-powered</b> hub is a device that provides high-power ports. Optionally, the hub controller draw power for its operation as a low-power device, but all high-power ports draw from the hub's self-power.|$|E
5|$|The London Underground {{has also}} owned several {{departmental}} <b>self-powered</b> vehicles designed for other duties. These include a tunnel cleaning train, {{consisting of two}} 1938 stock motor cars and three purpose-built cars, which act like a giant vacuum cleaner, and can hold 6 tons of dust before the filter tanks need to be emptied. Three Plasser & Theurer track tamping machines were purchased in 1980, and two Unimog road-rail vehicles were obtained in 1983 and 1986, for use as depot shunters.|$|E
5|$|In the present, Rick's {{group has}} entered the CDC {{building}} in Atlanta with help from its sole remaining scientist, Dr. Edwin Jenner (Noah Emmerich). Jenner makes them undertake a blood test to prove they are not infected. The group enjoys the luxuries of the facility, which is <b>self-powered</b> and still has running water, food, alcohol, and other amenities. Jenner admits {{he is the only}} researcher that stayed behind, many of the others having left for their families or committed suicide. A drunk Shane approaches Lori Grimes (Sarah Wayne Callies) about her callous attitude towards him with Rick's return and attempts to rape her, but backs off when she scratches his neck.|$|E
5|$|The Hotel Victoria {{opened in}} 1887, its name commemorating the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria held that year. It held 500 {{bedrooms}} {{and was the}} second largest hotel in London of its type on opening, overrunning its budget by around £520,000 (now £). The hotel was <b>self-powered,</b> generating its own electricity from dynamos. It was bought by Frederick Gordon in 1893, giving him a monopoly on all hotels on Northumberland Avenue. A refurbishment was started in 1911, though delayed due to the First World War, {{which resulted in a}} new annexe, the Edward VII Rooms. It closed in 1940 and was used by the War Office in need of extra accommodation. The War Office bought the building outright in 1951, renaming it the Victoria Buildings. It was subsequently renamed Northumberland House.|$|E
5|$|With {{effect from}} 1 September 2008, under the Public Entertainments and Meetings (Speakers' Corner) (Exemption) Order 2008 ("2008 PEMA Order"), {{responsibility}} for registering people wishing to speak or stage an exhibition or performance at Speakers' Corner {{was taken over}} from the police by the Commissioner of Parks and Recreation by way of {{an amendment to the}} Parks and Trees Regulations. To provide greater convenience, the National Parks Board made it possible for people to register online at its website. In addition, it became possible to hold demonstrations provided that they are organized by Singapore citizens and the participants are only citizens and permanent residents. As the time period restriction was lifted, events can now be held around the clock. In addition, rules on voice amplification were revised to allow the use of <b>self-powered</b> amplification devices like loudhailers from 9:00a.m. to 10:30p.m. This relaxation of the rules potentially allows for speakers' messages to be heard by larger audiences. A minor change was also introduced to the conditions for the use of Speakers' Corner – no banner, film, photograph, placard or poster containing any violent, lewd or obscene material may be displayed or exhibited whether before, during or after the event.|$|E

25|$|In 1953 Emerson Radio and Phonograph {{purchased}} Quiet Heet Corp., which {{entered the}} company into air conditioning. Although radio represented only 15 percent of Emerson's revenue by 1954, the company credited itself as creating the firsts {{of the clock}} radio, <b>self-powered</b> radio, and transistorized pocket radio; production of tape recorders began in 1955.|$|E
25|$|Power {{options include}} {{batteries}}, solar power panels, and human-powered generators, which make the XO <b>self-powered</b> equipment. 10 batteries at once can be charged {{from the school}} building power in the XO multi-battery charger. The low power consumption combined with these power options are useful in many countries that lack a power infrastructure.|$|E
25|$|March 2011: A team of {{researchers}} from UC Berkeley, DCU and University of Valparaíso have developed lab-on-a-chip that can diagnose diseases within 10 minutes {{without the use of}} external tubing and extra components. It is called <b>Self-powered</b> Integrated Microfluidic Blood Analysis System (SIMBAS). It uses tiny trenches to separate blood cells from plasma (99 percent of blood cells were captured during experiments). Researchers used plastic components, to reduce manufacturing costs.|$|E
25|$|From 1941 on, United States {{aircraft}} {{production was}} {{much greater than}} the combined output of Japan and Germany, and the force of 3,305 combat planes in December 1941 grew to 41,000 in August 1945. Not all of these aircraft were of <b>self-powered</b> metal construction: in March 1942, Echols told the joint Senate-House committee that the Army Air Corps had ordered 1000 wooden gliders, each capable of carrying 50 soldiers.|$|E
25|$|Pangolins, {{a type of}} mammal {{covered in}} thick scales, roll into a tight ball when threatened. Pangolins have been {{reported}} to roll away from danger, by both gravity and <b>self-powered</b> methods. A pangolin in hill country in Sumatra, to flee from the researcher, ran {{to the edge of a}} slope and curled into a ball to roll down the slope, crashing through the vegetation, and covering an estimated 30 metres or more in 10 seconds.|$|E
25|$|Tritium is {{the active}} {{substance}} in <b>self-powered</b> lighting and controlled nuclear fusion, its other uses including autoradiography and radioactive labeling. It {{is also used}} in nuclear weapon design for boosted fission weapons and initiators. Some tritium is created in heavy water moderated reactors when deuterium captures a neutron. This reaction has a small cross-section (probability of a single neutron-capture event) and produces only small amounts of tritium, although enough to justify cleaning tritium from the moderator every few years to reduce the environmental risk of tritium escape.|$|E
25|$|A {{multiple}} unit has powered wheels {{throughout the whole}} train. These are used for rapid transit and tram systems, {{as well as many}} both short- and long-haul passenger trains. A railcar is a single, <b>self-powered</b> car, and may be electrically-propelled or powered by a diesel engine. Multiple units have a driver's cab {{at each end of the}} unit, and were developed following the ability to build electric motors and engines small enough to fit under the coach. There are only a few freight {{multiple unit}}s, most of which are high-speed post trains.|$|E
25|$|As piezo energy {{harvesting}} {{has been investigated}} only since the late 1990s, it remains an emerging technology. Nevertheless, some interesting improvements were made with the <b>self-powered</b> electronic switch at INSA school of engineering, implemented by the spin-off Arveni. In 2006, the proof of concept of a battery-less wireless doorbell push button was created, and recently, a product showed that classical wireless wallswitch can be powered by a piezo harvester. Other industrial applications appeared between 2000 and 2005, to harvest energy from vibration and supply sensors for example, or to harvest energy from shock.|$|E
25|$|One type of {{device that}} {{integrates}} CobraNet {{is the audio}} DSP. As <b>self-powered</b> speakers became more common, Cobranet was frequently used to distribute the audio signal from the DSP. These devices typically receive audio from CobraNet (and often from other digital or analog sources simultaneously), and process the audio using digital filters and effects (for example, volume control, EQ, compression, delay, crossovers, etc.) and then output the audio via CobraNet (or other digital or analog outputs). Some DSPs even have an integral telephone hybrid, and can incorporate CobraNet and other sources into a teleconferencing application.|$|E
25|$|When the World's Columbian Exposition closed, lack of {{development}} {{along the southern}} portion of the route led to plummeting passenger numbers. The Chicago and South Side Rapid Transit Railroad Company went into receivership in 1895 and was sold under foreclosure on September 16, 1896 for $4,100,100. The South Side Elevated Railroad was formed {{to take over the}} route in 1897. Service was extended into the newly built Union Loop on October 18, 1897 connecting the South Side Elevated Railroad with the Lake Street Elevated Railroad, the Metropolitan West Side Elevated Railroad, and (after 1900) the Northwestern Elevated Railroad. These other companies used third rail electrification to power their trains so the South Side Elevated Railroad enlisted Frank Julian Sprague to convert its rolling stock to electrical power. Sprague used his previously untested system of multiple-unit train control (MU) whereby multiple <b>self-powered</b> cars could be linked together and controlled by a single person, making the South Side Elevated Railroad the first in the world to use MU operation.|$|E
500|$|... {{is known}} as tritium and {{contains}} one proton and two neutrons in its nucleus. It is radioactive, decaying into helium-3 through beta decay with a half-life of 12.32 years. It is so radioactive {{that it can be}} used in luminous paint, making it useful in such things as watches. The glass prevents the small amount of radiation from getting out. Small amounts of tritium are produced naturally by the interaction of cosmic rays with atmospheric gases; tritium has also been released during nuclear weapons tests. It is used in nuclear fusion reactions, as a tracer in isotope geochemistry, and in specialized <b>self-powered</b> lighting devices. Tritium has also been used in chemical and biological labeling experiments as a radiolabel.|$|E
500|$|In the 20th century, the Gjøa was {{the first}} vessel to {{accomplish}} the Northwest Passage in 1906. From 1921, the International Hydrographic Organization in Monaco has standardized surveying and charting of the sea and, from 1924, the Discovery Investigations studied whales and mapped the seas around Antarctica. The spherical Bathysphere was able to descend to [...] in 1930 on a cable and, in the 1940s, Jacques Cousteau helped develop the first successful scuba gear and popularize underwater diving. The Cold War and oil exploration funded further deep sea research: by 1960, the <b>self-powered</b> Trieste could take her crew [...] into the Mariana Trench and a US Navy diver in an atmospheric diving suit reached [...] below sea level in 2006.|$|E
500|$|Where devices (for example, {{high-speed}} disk drives) {{require more}} power than a high-power device can draw, they function erratically, if at all, from bus power of a single port. USB provides for these devices as being <b>self-powered.</b> However, such devices may come with a Y-shaped cable that has two USB plugs (one for power and data, the other for only power), so as to draw power as two devices. Such a cable is non-standard, with the USB compliance specification stating that [...] "use of a 'Y' cable (a cable with two A-plugs) is prohibited on any USB peripheral", meaning that [...] "if a USB peripheral requires {{more power than}} allowed by the USB specification {{to which it is}} designed, then it must be self-powered." ...|$|E
500|$|It was {{launched}} on 1 September 2000 as a [...] "free speech area" [...] where speaking events {{could be held}} without the need {{to apply for a}} licence under the Public Entertainments Act (Cap. 257, 1985 Rev. Ed.), now the [...] ("PEMA"). However, it was necessary for people to register their intention to speak at the venue with a police officer at the Kreta Ayer Neighbourhood Police Post any time within 30 days before the event, though there was no requirement for the police to be informed of the topic of the proposed speech. Other conditions imposed were that speeches had to take place between 7:00a.m. and 7:00p.m., and the use of sound amplification devices was prohibited. In 2002, exhibitions and performances were permitted to be held at Speakers' Corner. Conditions for the use of Speakers' Corner were further liberalized in 2008. Responsibility for registering people wishing to speak or stage an exhibition or performance was taken over by the Commissioner of Parks and Recreation, and online registration was introduced. It became possible to hold demonstrations provided they are organized by Singapore citizens and the participants are only citizens and permanent residents. Events can now be held around the clock, and <b>self-powered</b> amplification devices like loudhailers may be used between 9:00a.m. and 10:30p.m.|$|E
500|$|The {{sound was}} {{provided}} by Solotech. Front of house engineer Blake Suib explained that, [...] " [...] and Solotech were asked {{to come up with}} a design that blocked the least amount of seats but provided the quality and coverage that [...] expects and that we were looking for". The public address (PA) was made of 64 Milos that split into four hangs of 16 per hang. Two at the 50 yard line pointed one way and directly behind, two at the 50 yard line pointed the opposite way. Also present were 32 Micas; 16 per hang, pointing to the sides. Each one of the four hangs had its own equalization (EQ) and level control, so in case one of the speakers were louder there would be a separate EQ to compensate for any change in the tone due to the distance. All the components and tools used in the public address were designed by Meyer Sound Laboratories, including a software called Mapp, used to decide where to point the PA; the Simm, to analyze and time align the PA accurately; and the Galileo, used to EQ and balance all the sections of the PA. The speakers were <b>self-powered</b> with amplifiers also built by Meyer Sounds. There were 24 HP700 subwoofers positioned all over the arena floor, and the Simm and Galileo were used to time align. Spears used a Crown CM-311AE headset microphone wearing the mic's beltpack (usually hidden in color matching material) on her top or pants, she did not use in-ear monitors; instead 12 Meyer CQs were positioned, eight flown around the center ring and two on each of the smaller stages. Spears specifically asked Suib to make the show sound similar to a dance club. Solotech provided the lighting package, including a mostly Vari-Lite rig, with 80 each VL3000s and VL3500s in various positions, and 60 VL500s built into the stage deck. Whitehouse also had 18 PRG Bad Boy luminaires, 16 of which sat in pods that hung in various positions lower than the rest of the rig, with two more at either end of the stage. Each of the eight pods housed two Bad Boys, two of the VL3500s, one Robert Juliat Ivanhoe followspot with scroller under DMX control, and a Molefay. Fifty Martin Professional Atomic Color strobes and four front of house Robert Juliat Aramis followspots rounded out the lighting package. The lightning team had to rehearse for a month to prepare. The tour was also the first to use the touring version of the PRG Virtuoso V676 console to control the system, which was used from the beginning of the European leg until the end of the tour. Pyrotechnics and jets of smoke used in the show were created by Lorenzo Cornacchia of Pyrotek Special Effects and Tait Towers.|$|E

2500|$|THX {{gave their}} {{approval}} to the BGW M2200 <b>self-powered</b> subwoofer introduced in 1993. The subwoofer contained four 15" [...] drivers, crossover circuitry, and an internal amplifier {{based on the}} Grand Touring series design. THX quality assurance also approved the BGW M1100 subwoofer (basically half of an M2200) in 1995 and the Millennium amplifier line in 1996.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{researchers}} independently {{proposed the}} installation of degassing columns from rafts in the lake. The principle is simple: a pump lifts water {{from the bottom of}} the lake, heavily saturated with , until the loss of pressure begins releasing the gas from the diphasic fluid and thus makes the process <b>self-powered.</b> In 1992 at Monoun, and in 1995 at Nyos, a French team directed by Michel Halbwachs demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. [...] In 2001, the U.S. Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance funded a permanent installation at Nyos.|$|E
2500|$|Although the {{technology}} of the Bathysphere was eventually rendered obsolete by more advanced diving vessels, Beebe and Barton's Bathysphere represented {{the first time that}} researchers attempted to observe deep-sea animals in their native environment, setting a precedent which many others would follow. [...] Beebe's Bathysphere's dives also served as an inspiration for Jacques Piccard, the son of the balloonist Auguste Piccard, to perform his own record-setting descent in 1960 to a depth of seven miles using a <b>self-powered</b> submersible called a bathyscaphe. [...] The Bathysphere itself served as a model for later submersibles such as the DSV Alvin.|$|E
2500|$|The beta {{particles}} {{emitted by}} the radioactive decay of {{small amounts of}} tritium cause chemicals called phosphors to glow. [...] This radioluminescence is used in <b>self-powered</b> lighting devices called betalights, which are used for night illumination of firearm sights, watches, exit signs, map lights, knives {{and a variety of}} other devices. [...] Tritium has replaced radioluminescent paint containing radium in this application, which can cause bone cancer and has been banned in most countries for decades. As of the turn of the millennium, commercial demand for tritium is 400grams per year and the cost is approximately US$30,000 per gram.|$|E
2500|$|Pangolins {{have also}} been {{reported}} to roll away from danger by <b>self-powered</b> methods. Witnessed by a lion researcher [...] in the Serengeti in Africa, a group of lions surrounded a pangolin, but could not get purchase on it when it rolled into a ball, and so the lions sat around it waiting and dozing. Surrounded by lions, it would unroll itself slightly and give itself a push to roll some distance, until by doing this multiple times it could get {{far enough away from}} the lions to be safe. Moving like this would allow a pangolin to cover distance while still remaining in a protective armoured ball.|$|E
2500|$|Returning {{to work in}} 1953, he {{accepted}} a position as a Mechanical Engineering Specialist with Shell, where he developed {{a new type of}} <b>self-powered</b> drill driven by a turbine running on the lubricating mud that is pumped into the borehole during drilling. Normally a well is drilled by attaching rigid sections of pipe together and powering the cutting head by spinning the pipe from the surface, but Whittle's design removed the need for a strong mechanical connection between the drill and the head frame, allowing for much lighter piping to be used. [...] He gave the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures in 1954 on The Story of Petroleum.|$|E
2500|$|The museum also {{displays}} {{railroad equipment}} used to transport logs {{out of the}} forest, including a Baldwin locomotive used in the Mount Shasta area to haul redwood logs to saw mills in northern California. There is a <b>self-powered</b> McGriffert Log Loader built in 1926 which was in active use until 1962. The museum also owns a 1923 Clyde track laying machine, {{one of only two}} still in existence. It was used by at various locations around Klamath County by Weyerhaeuser until 1959. The museum even has a diesel-powered tug boat used to tow rafts of logs from an Agency Lake collection site to a saw mill {{at the south end of}} Upper Klamath Lake, a [...] trip. The tug was operated on the lake from 1937 until 1943.|$|E
2500|$|The {{distribution}} of power density in the reactor is measured by ionization chambers located {{inside and outside the}} core. The physical power density distribution control system (PPDDCS) has sensors inside the core; the reactor control and protection system (RCPS) uses sensors in the core and in the lateral biological shield tank. The external sensors in the tank are located around the reactor middle plane, therefore do not indicate axial power distribution nor information about the power in {{the central part of the}} core. [...] There are over 100 radial and 12 axial power distribution monitors, employing <b>self-powered</b> detectors. Reactivity meters and removable startup chambers are used for monitoring of reactor startup. Total reactor power is recorded as the sum of the currents of the lateral ionization chambers. The moisture and temperature of the gas circulating in the channels is monitored by the pressure tube integrity monitoring system.|$|E
2500|$|The Wrockwardine Wood {{inclined}} plane was [...] long {{and lifted the}} canal by [...] The Windmill {{inclined plane}} was much longer at [...] dropping the level by , while the Hay inclined plane was the steepest, descending [...] in [...] While the Wrockwardine Wood plane was worked by a steam engine from the start, the engines for the other two planes were not ready when they began operation, and the initial movement of the boats was assisted by horses until 1793, when the engines were commissioned. The canal joined the Ketley Canal at Oakengates. However, {{there was a difference}} in the water levels and a lock was required to compensate for the 1ft (0.3m) drop. At its southern end, to the south of Southall wharf, the canal split into two, with the main line continuing to Coalport via the two inclined planes, and the Horsehay branch running to Brierly Hill, terminating on the hill about [...] above the Coalbrookdale works. A tramway from the works tunnelled into the hill, ending in a cavern below the terminus of the canal. From here two vertical shafts [...] were constructed, with coal and iron ore descending and limestone ascending in crates. Because the bulk of the transfers were from the canal to the tramway, and limestone was lighter by volume than ironstone, the system was <b>self-powered.</b> Expenditure on the apparatus was £2,742, and the system was operational by 4 October 1792. The shafts and tunnel belonged to the Dale Company, and the Shropshire Canal decided not to take them over when they were completed. Instead the Dale Company charged tolls for their use. Despite heavy usage, with 1,801 tons of coal descending in the six weeks from 2 September 1793, the system was not a success, and was replaced by a tramway inclined plane in 1794. The tramway was soon extended {{along the length of the}} Horsehay branch, making the canal redundant.|$|E
