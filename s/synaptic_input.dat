5|$|Purkinje cells {{form the}} heart of the {{cerebellar}} circuit, and their large size and distinctive activity patterns have made it relatively easy to study their response patterns in behaving animals using extracellular recording techniques. Purkinje cells normally emit action potentials at a high rate {{even in the absence of}} the <b>synaptic</b> <b>input.</b> In awake, behaving animals, mean rates averaging around 40Hz are typical. The spike trains show a mixture of what are called simple and complex spikes. A simple spike is a single action potential followed by a refractory period of about 10ms; a complex spike is a stereotyped sequence of action potentials with very short inter-spike intervals and declining amplitudes. Physiological studies have shown that complex spikes (which occur at baseline rates around 1Hz and never at rates much higher than 10Hz) are reliably associated with climbing fiber activation, while simple spikes are produced by a combination of baseline activity and parallel fiber input. Complex spikes are often followed by a pause of several hundred milliseconds during which simple spike activity is suppressed.|$|E
5|$|Purkinje {{cells are}} among the most {{distinctive}} neurons in the brain, and one of the earliest types to be recognized—they were first described by the Czech anatomist Jan Evangelista Purkyně in 1837. They are distinguished by the shape of their dendritic tree: The dendrites branch very profusely, but are severely flattened in a plane perpendicular to the cerebellar folds. Thus, the dendrites of a Purkinje cell form a dense planar net, through which parallel fibers pass at right angles. The dendrites are covered with dendritic spines, each of which receives <b>synaptic</b> <b>input</b> from a parallel fiber. Purkinje cells receive more synaptic inputs than any other type of cell in the brain—estimates of the number of spines on a single human Purkinje cell run as high as 200,000. The large, spherical cell bodies of Purkinje cells are packed into a narrow layer (one cell thick) of the cerebellar cortex, called the Purkinje layer. After emitting collaterals that affect nearby parts of the cortex, their axons travel into the deep cerebellar nuclei, where they make on the order of 1,000 contacts each with several types of nuclear cells, all within a small domain. Purkinje cells use GABA as their neurotransmitter, and therefore exert inhibitory effects on their targets.|$|E

40|$|Neurons in {{the brain}} receive {{thousands}} of <b>synaptic</b> <b>inputs</b> from other neurons. Synaptic integration is the term used to describe how neurons ‘add up’ these inputs before the generation of a nerve impulse, or action potential. The ability of <b>synaptic</b> <b>inputs</b> to effect neuronal output is determined {{by a number of}} factors, including the size, shape and relative timing of electrical potentials generated by <b>synaptic</b> <b>inputs,</b> the geometric structure of the target neuron, the physical location of <b>synaptic</b> <b>inputs</b> within that structure, as well as the expression of voltage-gated channels in different regions of the neuronal membrane.

25|$|Both single neurons {{and groups}} of neurons can {{generate}} oscillatory activity spontaneously. In addition, they may show oscillatory responses to perceptual input or motor output. Some types of neurons will fire rhythmically {{in the absence of}} any <b>synaptic</b> <b>input.</b> Likewise, brain-wide activity reveals oscillatory activity while subjects do not engage in any activity, so-called resting-state activity. These ongoing rhythms can change in different ways in response to perceptual input or motor output. Oscillatory activity may respond by increases or decreases in frequency and amplitude or show a temporary interruption, which is referred to as phase resetting. In addition, external activity may not interact with ongoing activity at all, resulting in an additive response.|$|E
25|$|Forward {{propagation}} of dendritic spikes is initiated due to synaptic activity. Forward propagation serves to amplify signals {{that may not}} reach the soma through normal passive transmission. The strength of synaptic stimulation required to generate a dendritic spike varies among neuronal types. Neurons which receive relatively few inputs cannot rely on spatial summation and therefore must rely on stronger synaptic inputs. Some relatively unbranched neurons, such as the globus pallidus neuron, bypass the need of strong <b>synaptic</b> <b>input</b> by increased concentrations of voltage-gated sodium channels at the synapse. Other more branched neurons, such as the pyramidal neurons, rely on spatial summation of multiple inputs to generate forward propagating dendritic spikes. Forward propagation is not well understood and much research {{is devoted to the}} subject. It is thought by most experts that this phenomenon does not occur in neurons outside of the brain.|$|E
25|$|Initiation of a {{dendritic}} spike {{through a}} single strong <b>synaptic</b> <b>input</b> {{does not guarantee}} that the spike will propagate reliably over long distances. If multiple synapses are simultaneously activated, dendritic spikes may be formed through spatial summation. Spatial summation involves the addition of multiple input signals resulting in a larger signal and possibly a dendritic spike. Hippocampal CA1 neurons {{have been shown to}} produce reliable dendritic spike propagation through spatial summation of multiple synaptic inputs. In the hippocampus, the CA1 neurons contain two distinctive regions that receive excitatory synaptic inputs: the perforant path (PP) through the apical dendritic tuft (500-750 μm from soma) and the Schaffer-collateral (SC) through the basal and apical dendrites (250-500 μm from soma). Studies show that individual stimulation of either the PP or SC was not sufficient enough to allow a dendritic spike to initiate an action potential. However, it was shown that when a dendritic spike occurred due to PP stimulations, the presence of a SC stimulation determined whether or not the signal would propagate to the soma.|$|E

50|$|Heterosynaptic {{plasticity}} {{may play}} an important homeostatic role in neural plasticity by normalizing or limiting the total change of <b>synaptic</b> <b>input</b> during ongoing Hebbian plasticity. Hebbian plasticity, an ubiquitous form of homosynaptic, associative plasticity, is believed to underlie learning and memory. Moreover, Hebbian plasticity is induced by and amplifies correlations in neural circuits which creates a positive feedback loop and renders neural circuits unstable.

40|$|We have {{analyzed}} {{the action of}} nitric oxide on the <b>synaptic</b> <b>inputs</b> of spiking local interneurons that form part of the local circuits in the terminal abdominal ganglion of the crayfish, Pacifastacus leniusculus. Increasing the availability of NO in the ganglion by bath applying the NO donor SNAP, or the substrate for its synthesis, L-arginine, caused a depression of <b>synaptic</b> <b>inputs</b> onto the interneurons evoked by electrically stimulating mechanosensory neurons in nerve 2 of the terminal ganglion. Conversely, reducing the availability of NO by bath application of an NO scavenger, PTIO, and an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, L-NAME, increased the amplitude of the evoked potentials. These results suggest that elevated NO concentration causes a depression of the <b>synaptic</b> <b>inputs</b> to spiking local interneurons. To determine whether these effects could be mediated through an NO/cGMP signaling pathway we bath applied a membrane permeable analogue of cGMP, 8 -br-cGMP, which decreased the amplitude of the inputs to the interneurons. Bath application of an inhibitor of soluble guanlylyl cyclase, ODQ, produced {{an increase in the}} amplitude of the <b>synaptic</b> <b>inputs.</b> Our results suggest that NO causes a depression of <b>synaptic</b> <b>inputs</b> to spiking local interneurons probably by acting through an NO/cGMP signaling pathway.

40|$|There is an {{emerging}} {{body of evidence}} that glycinergic and GABAergic <b>synaptic</b> <b>inputs</b> onto motor neurons (MNs) help regulate the final number of MNs and axonal muscle innervation patterns. Using mutant glutamate decarboxylase 67 (GAD 67) and vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter (VGAT) deficient mice, we describe the effect that deficiencies of presynaptic GABAergic and/or glycinergic release have on the post-synaptic somato-dendritic structure of motor neurons, {{and the development of}} excitatory and inhibitory <b>synaptic</b> <b>inputs</b> to MNs.

40|$|The {{withdrawal}} of <b>synaptic</b> <b>inputs</b> from the somata and proximal dendrites of spinal motoneurons following {{peripheral nerve injury}} could contribute to poor functional recovery. Decreased availability of neurotrophins to afferent terminals on axotomized motoneurons has been implicated as one cause of the withdrawal. No reduction in contacts made by <b>synaptic</b> <b>inputs</b> immunoreactive to the vesicular glutamate transporter 1 and glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 is noted on axotomized motoneurons if modest treadmill exercise, which stimulates the production of neurotrophins by spinal motoneurons, is applied after nerve injury.

Both cell types receive monosynaptic excitatory <b>synaptic</b> <b>inputs</b> from the auditory nerve, but have different responses to sound and project to different target regions and cells. Although the intrinsic physiology and <b>synaptic</b> <b>inputs</b> to planar neurons have been previously characterized, the radiate neurons are less common and have not been as well studied. We studied both types of multipolar neurons and characterized their properties including intrinsic excitability, synaptic dynamics of their auditory nerve inputs, {{as well as their}} neural firing properties to auditory nerve stimulation. Radiate neurons had a faster member time constant and higher threshold current to fire spikes than planar neurons, but the maximal firing rate is the same for both cell types upon large current injections. Compared to planar neurons, radiate neurons showed spontaneous postsynaptic currents with smaller size, and slower but variable kinetics. Auditory nerve stimulation progressively recruited <b>synaptic</b> <b>inputs</b> that were smaller and slower in radiate neurons, over a broader range of stimulus strength. <b>Synaptic</b> <b>inputs</b> to radiate neurons showed less depression than planar neurons during low rates of repetitive activity, but the synaptic depression at higher rates was similar between two cell types. However, due to the slow kinetics of the <b>synaptic</b> <b>inputs,</b> <b>synaptic</b> transmission in radiate neurons showed prominent temporal summation that contributed to greater synaptic depolarization and a higher firing rate for repetitive auditory nerve stimulation at high rates. Taken together, these results show that radiate multipolar neurons integrate a large number of weak <b>synaptic</b> <b>inputs</b> over a broad dynamic range, and have intrinsic and synaptic properties that are distinct from planar multipolar neurons.
