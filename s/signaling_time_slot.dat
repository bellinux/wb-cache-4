30|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} communication between a source and a destination, {{and the source}} is possibly assisted with a relay node. All the channels (source to destination, source to relay and relay to destination) {{are assumed to be}} frequency selective and in order to cope with that, OFDM modulation with proper cyclic extension is used. The relay operates in a DF mode. This mode is known to be suboptimum [4, 5]. Decode-and-forward is adopted here as a relaying strategy for its simplicity and its mathematical tractability. Two protocols (P 1 and P 2) are considered. Each protocol is made of two <b>signaling</b> periods, named <b>time</b> <b>slots.</b> The first <b>time</b> <b>slot</b> is identical for both protocols. During this period, on each carrier, the source broadcasts a symbol. This symbol (affected by the proper channel gain) is received by the destination and the relay. The relay may retransmit the same carrier-specific symbol to the destination during the second <b>time</b> <b>slot.</b> Whether the relay does it or not will be indicated by the optimization problem which is formulated and solved in this paper. The protocol P 2 differs from the protocol P 1 in that, in the latter, the source does not transmit during the second <b>time</b> <b>slot,</b> irrespective to whether the relay is active or not during the second <b>time</b> <b>slot.</b> For P 2, on a per carrier basis, the source sends a new symbol if the relay is inactive. The reason for not having the source and the relay transmitting at the same time is to avoid the interference that would occur in this case, thus rendering the optimization problem somewhat tedious. Moreover in practice source and relay will have different carrier frequency offsets which is likely to require involved precorrection mechanisms. A scenario with interference will be investigated in the future.|$|R

We ap-proach this problem by comparing the mutual information between the channel and the received <b>signals</b> over two <b>time</b> <b>slots</b> of a radar system which does / does not use TR. Besides evaluating this mutual information, and showing that for this setup it is equal to directed information which might be of interest in feedback-like channels, we also provide a low-rank interpretation of this mutual informa-tion for Gaussian channels.
