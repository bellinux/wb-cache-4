Cable television is also attractive because today, all CATV operators in Romania are also providing Internet access at various speeds (ranging from 20 MBPS to 1000 MBPS - depending on the provider and region), in many cases subscribers are contracting an Internet and TV package, at a fairly low price (as low as 50 lei/month or even less for [...] "NET and CATV" [...] for a basic package - depending on the provider). Internet access is, in many cases, granted by cable TV operators, as it was cheaper to implement it over the existent CATV networks in some cases.|$|R

We present that many Uzbek travel companies are not used to do proper marketing research, only the biggest are. There are not rare cases of situations when management does not know how to define strategic behavior and strategy itself (as majority of companies lack long-term vision and orient themselves primarily on short run profits).

30|$|Generally, {{two types}} of brokers in a Cloud market can be distinguished. Firstly, there are brokers that {{concentrate}} on negotiating relationships between consumers and providers without owning or managing the Cloud infrastructure. They provide, for example, consultancy services to the potential CCs for moving their IT resources into a suitable Cloud. Secondly, there are brokers that add extra services {{on top of a}} CPs’ infrastructure / platform / software to enhance and secure the Cloud environment for the consumers. For example, a broker might offer identity and access management service on top of CP’s <b>basic</b> <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> to consumers. As an example, such a broker may develop APIs in order to make Cloud services interoperable and portable. In both cases, the broker act as a CP that offer value added or bundled services to the CCs. DaaS, IPMaaS and NaaS are three types of service delivery models that offer services on top of other services (e.g., SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS). Thus, the CPs, that offer add-on services (e.g., DaaS, IPMaaS, and NaaS), plays the role as a broker in Cloud computing market.|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{selection}} of transport operators {{has become a}} complex decision making process with multi-criteria aspects. Deciding on which transport operator to use depends on various <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> that can be different for each company. Retailers such as those from France, the Netherlands, Sweden and UK look to improve logistical performance {{in areas such as}} lead time, flexibility and reliability, and improve customer relations. In the past the main critical aspects of retailers were cost and service optimisation. An additional factor could play a role in their {{selection of}} transport operators and this is green <b>service</b> <b>offerings.</b>   Research question: Which <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> are important for French, Dutch, Swedish and UK retailers in their selection of transport operators? Sub question 1 : Are the retailers willing to use green <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> and why? Sub question 2 : Which of the green <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> are important for French, Dutch, Swedish and UK retailers in their selection of transport operators?   Purpose: The {{purpose of this paper is}} to find out what the most important <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> are for French, Dutch, Swedish and UK retailers in their selection of transport operators. It also aims to determine if French, Dutch, Swedish and UK retailers are willing to use green <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> and explain why. Finally, it will attempt to identify which of the green <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> are important for French, Dutch, Swedish and UK retailers in their selection of transport operators.   Method: This thesis was conducted by applying the deductive approach and is based on a quantitative research method. The sampling method used for this thesis is non-probability sampling. Data was collected through questionnaires with French, Dutch, Swedish and UK retailers. French, Dutch, Swedish and UK retailers have been selected for the sample population in order to find out how important green <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> might be for them when they are purchasing the services of a transport operator. French, Dutch, Swedish and UK retailers from different sectors were chosen in order to achieve an objective overview of the retail industry from each country when selecting transport operators.         Conclusion: Traditional <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> are more important than green <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> for French, Dutch, Swedish and UK retailers that participated in this research paper. However, when looking at the results of the data, some green <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> were perceived to be important. The authors therefore believe that when French, Dutch, Swedish and UK retailers are selecting transport operators their first focus is on the traditional <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> that are very important to them. However, if a French, Dutch, Swedish or UK retailer is encouraged by the following motivators: customer expectations, measurable improvement or economic incentives.

40|$|Our {{research}} on Web Services is organized into two related projects. First, we develop Web <b>Service</b> <b>Offerings</b> Language (WSOL) for formal specification of various constraints and classes of service for Web <b>Services.</b> A <b>service</b> <b>offering</b> in WSOL is a formal representation of one {{class of service}} of one Web Service. It contains formal representation of various constraints: functional (pre-, post-, and future -conditions), non-functional (a. k. a. Quality of Service - QoS), and access rights. It also contains statements about price/penalty and management responsibility. The Web Service, its consumer, or one or more designated third parties (usually SOAP message intermediaries) can evaluate WSOL constraints. For easier specification of similar <b>service</b> <b>offerings,</b> WSOL enables specification of constraint groups (CGs) and constraint group templates (CGTs). We have also developed a format for representation of dynamic relationships between <b>service</b> <b>offerings.</b> WSOL <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> are simple contracts and SLAs (Service Level Agreements) between Web Services...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. WSOL (Web <b>Service</b> <b>Offerings</b> Language) is an XML (Extensible Markup Language) {{notation}} {{compatible with}} the WSDL (Web Services De-scription Language) standard. While WSDL is used for describing operations provided by Web Services, WSOL enables formal specification of multiple classes of service for one Web <b>Service.</b> A <b>service</b> <b>offering</b> is a formal represen-tation of one class of service for a Web Service. As classes of service for Web Services are determined by combinations of various constraints, WSOL enables formal specification of functional constraints, some QoS (a. k. a., non-functional) constraints, simple access rights (for differentiation of service), price, and rela-tionships with other <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> of the same Web Service. Describing a Web Service in WSOL, in addition to WSDL, enables selection of a more ap-propriate Web <b>Service</b> and <b>service</b> <b>offering</b> for particular circumstances. Fur-ther, it supports dynamic adaptation and management of Web Service composi-tions using manipulation of <b>service</b> <b>offerings.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|As a book {{on public}} policy, this book is unique in {{addressing}} explicitly the role of human nature. Only with {{a good understanding of}} human nature can policy makers address their foremost needs and anticipate how people may respond to specific designs in policy. This way policy makers can avoid 2 ̆ 2 unintended consequences. 2 ̆ 2 The book also provides a new perspective on the meaning of public interest, which is based on intellectual roots dating back to J. S. Mill and more recently Harsanyi and Rawls. Traditionally, economists have referred to either the Hicksian criterion or the Kaldorian criterion as the yardstick to whether a policy is welfare enhancing, not realizing that both of these criteria fail abjectly in producing a convincing test for welfare improvement. This is because ex post, typically some people will gain and some people will lose from any policy. The author argues for an alternative, ex ante welfare increase criterion that is based on how people would assess a policy if they were completely impartial and totally ignored their personal interests. It applies the principles to key policy concerns such as health policy, tort law reform, education and cultural policy, and pension reform. The healthcare reform proposals in the book illustrate the application of the principles. The author proposes a basic protection plan under which <b>standard</b> <b>basic</b> healthcare <b>services</b> are priced the same whether they are provided by public or private caregivers—at levels that can contain both demand side and supply side moral hazard.
