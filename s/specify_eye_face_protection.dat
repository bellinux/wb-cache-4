50|$|Sports of {{all types}} may require <b>eye</b> or <b>face</b> <b>protection</b> {{depending}} on the players’ need. Face masks come in different forms for different types of sports. In lacrosse and American football, the masks are metal rods attached to the helmet to cover the face. While optional face masks that might be seen in basketball or rugby are plastic masks that are usually molded to fit the players’ face. Such masks are worn to minimize additional damage to an already injured part of the <b>face.</b> <b>Eye</b> <b>protection</b> is an additional support provided by sports goggles. Goggles may be worn in lieu of glasses or contacts. Goggles are reliable {{in the fact that}} they do not move around while the player is in motion and they protect the eye from foreign objects.|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of {{personal protective equipment}} (PPE) and its contribution to increase personal safety in usual work places has to be proven by tests. One potential hazard for people are electric fault arcs occurring with short-circuits in electric power installations. There are very high risks for persons especially in case of direct exposure, e. g. during live working or working in the vicinity to live parts. Particularly radiation and convective heat is converted. With the box test according to IEC or EN 61482 - 1 - 2 a method for testing protection textiles and clothing against the thermal hazards of electric fault arcs has already been existing and used in certification for several years. But as shown by arc accidents the face is also particularly affected by severe damages. Protective equipment for <b>eye</b> and <b>face</b> <b>protection</b> which is also tested for arc resistance and protection is necessary. Based on basic investigations test principles for <b>eye</b> and <b>face</b> <b>protection</b> equipment against the thermal hazards of electric fault arcs have been developed and laid down in a new German test guide. The test set-up of the box test is suitable. It has been adapted and modified by a test head where test samples such as visors, visorhelmet combinations, face shields etc. are placed. The tests are carried out in accordance to the box test method of protective clothing (IEC/EN 61482 - 1 - 2). The paper gives information on tests made according to this test guide. Furthermore general conclusions are drawn on how to test and how to standardize tests of PPE for <b>eye</b> and <b>face</b> <b>protection.</b> The principles will be introduced in E DIN 58118 becoming a supplementation to the German edition of EN 166. It can also be the base for an international or European standard later on...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{industries}} such as the mining, petrochemistry {{or power}} industries, personal protective equipment is often used in explosive atmospheres. What causes the occurrence of explosive hazards is ever-present in the work environment they include, electrostatic phenomena {{as well as the}} build-up of electrical charges {{on the surface of the}} protective equipment used. This paper presents the results of studies which were aimed at determining the fundamental electrostatic parameters of protective helmets as well as <b>eye</b> and <b>face</b> <b>protection,</b> surface resistance and the voltage of electrostatic fields. Examinations on the typical structure of the above mentioned equipment was conducted including the variable values of ambient humidity, which can occur in the working environment and with the use of various types of materials used to generate a charge. The adopted methods and testing equipment have been presented. Using the current, general requirements regarding the electrostatic properties of materials, the examined helmets and eye protection were assessed for their use in explosive atmospheres...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe ISO TC 94 SC 6 Committee for <b>Eye</b> and <b>Face</b> <b>Protection</b> {{requested}} that the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) develop standard headforms for possible incorporation into ISO standards. The objective {{of this study was}} to develop headforms representative of workers throughout the world for testing <b>eye</b> and <b>face</b> protective devices. MethodsThe 3 D scan data for 1169 U. S. workers and 350 Chinese workers were analyzed to define the variation of the dimensions that are important to <b>eye</b> and <b>face</b> protective devices using 3 D processing techniques. Measurements for 317 Japanese workers were also obtained from the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) in Japan for comparison purposes. Fourteen existing headforms were compared to determine their representation of the world's working population. Included were five sizes to represent U. S. workers and five sizes for Chinese workers, two EN 168 sizes, and two Japanese headforms. ResultsThe largest head shape variation among the U. S. workers is between a small female head and a large male head. When comparing the average head for each dataset, the U. S. average is larger than the Chinese average except in the cheek areas. This is also true when comparing the U. S. average to the Japanese data. Comparisons revealed that the existing NIOSH small, medium and large headforms can cover the world population variation very well. The Chinese small, medium and large headforms can also represent Japanese workers. However, the ear positions for the NIOSH and Chinese headforms were not representative of the population data. ConclusionsNew headforms were developed by revising existing NIOSH and Chinese headforms. Designers and manufacturers of <b>eye</b> and <b>face</b> related products such as safety glasses may need to consider the differences between U. S. and Asian workers...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To provide {{guidance}} in minimizing employee exposure to hazards {{in the work}} place by the proper selection and use of personal protective equipment. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has many controls and work procedures, including administrative and engineering controls, in place which reduce employee exposure to hazards. However, many times these controls are not sufficient to fully protect every worker for all work place hazards encountered. Personal protective equipment (PPE) is the next line of defense against job-related hazards. PPE acts as a barrier between the employee and potentially hazardous chemicals, machines, tools, and processes. This policy provides general information and guidance for the use of several types of PPE to protect employees. A chart is included for the selection of <b>eye</b> and <b>face</b> <b>protection.</b> Various glove-types and protection qualities are listed. References are listed to other relevant Oregon/Washington (OR/WA) policies and programs as well as the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Policy/Action: In order to provide for proper employee protection on the job, the following initiatives will be implemented. (Reference attachment (1) for specific policy requirements) 1. Supervisors are responsible for providing employees and volunteers with the appropriate PPE for the assigned work tasks. Each supervisor will review the work environments and activities to identify potential hazards. A Risk Assessment (RA) or a Job Hazard Analysis (JHA) will be completed for each wor...|$|R

40|$|The {{threat of}} {{emerging}} infectious diseases including Ebola hemorrhagic fever, pandemic influenza, avian influenza, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and SARS has highlighted {{the need for}} effective personal protective equipment (PPE) to protect healthcare workers (HCWs), patients, and visitors. PPE is a critical component {{in the hierarchy of}} controls used to protect HCWs from infectious hazards. HCW PPE may include gowns, respirators, <b>face</b> masks, gloves, <b>eye</b> <b>protection,</b> <b>face</b> shields, and head and shoe coverings. Important research has been conducted in certain areas, such as respirators and protective masks, but studies in other areas, particularly gowns, are scarce. Gowns are identified as the second-most-used piece of PPE, following gloves, in the healthcare setting. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Guideline for Isolation Precautions, isolation gowns should be worn to protect HCWs' arms and exposed body areas during procedures and patient-care activities when anticipating contact with clothing, blood, bodily fluids, secretions and excretions. Isolation gowns currently available on the marketplace offer varying resistance to blood and other bodily fluids {{depending on the type of}} the material, its impermeability, and wear and tear. While some studies show no benefit of the routine use of isolation gowns, others demonstrate that its use is associated with a reduced infection rate. This paper reviews isolation gowns in healthcare settings, including the fabrics used, gown design and interfaces, as well as critical parameters that affect microorganism and liquid transmission through fabrics.
