5|$|Malacostracans {{live in a}} {{wide range}} of marine and {{freshwater}} habitats, and three orders have terrestrial members: Amphipoda (Talitridae), Isopoda (Oniscidea, the woodlice) and Decapoda (terrestrial hermit crabs, crabs of the families Ocypodidae, Gecarcinidae, and Grapsidae, and terrestrial crayfish). They are abundant in all marine ecosystems, and most species are scavengers, although <b>some,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the porcelain crabs, are filter feeders, and <b>some,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> mantis shrimps, are carnivores.|$|E
50|$|Parks {{can also}} benefit pollinators, and <b>some</b> parks (<b>such</b> <b>as</b> Saltdean Oval) have been {{redesigned}} to accommodate them better. <b>Some</b> organisations, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Xerces Society are also promoting this idea.|$|R
50|$|In {{competition}} the forelock is braided for <b>some</b> events, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> {{those in}} the dressage and hunt seat disciplines. Conversely, <b>some</b> breeds, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the Andalusian, are usually shown with a long, full, forelock that is never braided. Other breeds may confine the forelock with rubber bands and anchor it to the bridle. The forelock may also be roached (shaved off) in <b>some</b> competitions, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> polo.|$|R

5|$|Assessments of Sorabji's music vary widely. While <b>some,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> {{the pianist}} John Ogdon and the organist Kevin Bowyer, speak {{of him as}} {{comparable}} to such composers as Bach, Beethoven, Chopin and Messiaen, others dismiss him altogether. Reviews of concerts featuring Sorabji's music tend to be similarly mixed, some reviewers elevating him to the ranks of figures such as Debussy, and others describing his music as vacuous.|$|E
5|$|Beetles {{typically}} have a particularly hard exoskeleton including the elytra, though <b>some</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the rove beetles have very short elytra while blister beetles have softer elytra. The general {{anatomy of a}} beetle is quite uniform and typical of insects, although there are several examples of novelty, such as adaptations in water beetles which trap air bubbles under the elytra for use while diving. Beetles are endopterygotes, {{which means that they}} undergo complete metamorphosis, with a series of conspicuous and relatively abrupt changes in body structure between hatching and becoming adult after a relatively immobile pupal stage. <b>Some,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> stag beetles, have a marked sexual dimorphism, the males possessing enormously enlarged mandibles which they use to fight other males. Many beetles are aposematic, with bright colours and patterns warning of their toxicity, while others are harmless Batesian mimics of such insects. Many beetles, including those that live in sandy places, have effective camouflage.|$|E
5000|$|In the 4th and 5th centuries, <b>some</b> writers <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Gregory of Nyssa and Maximus the Confessor {{held that}} human life already began at conception, <b>some</b> writers <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Lactantius - {{following}} Aristotle's view - spoke rather {{of the soul}} that was [...] "infused" [...] in forty days or more, and <b>some</b> writers <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Jerome and Augustine of Hippo left {{the mystery of the}} timing of the infusion to God.|$|R

5|$|Construction {{lasted for}} {{nine and a}} half years, from April 1902 until October 1911, with the tower {{construction}} alone taking three years (1908–11). Different departments of the city administration moved in at different times with <b>some,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the police department, moving in as early as March 1908. The building was formally opened by Mayor Martin Kirschner on October 29, 1911.|$|E
5|$|During the 1920s and 1930s, {{the city}} re-emerged {{as a major}} tourist {{destination}} centered on casinos and other vice businesses. Featuring venues, such as the famed Balinese Room, the city became nationally known as the sin city of the Gulf. The illegal businesses were finally closed in the 1950s, leading to a long, stagnant economic period. Many businesses relocated off of the island, though <b>some,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the insurance businesses and the medical school, remained.|$|E
5000|$|In <b>some</b> words, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> hamer, short [...] is in free {{variation}} with long [...] {{despite the fact}} that the spelling suggests the latter. In <b>some</b> words, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> laat, the pronunciation with short [...] occurs only in colloquial language. In <b>some</b> other words, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> aambeeld [...] 'anvil', the pronunciation with short [...] is already a part of the standard language. The shortening of [...] has been noted as early as 1927.|$|R

5|$|In the autumn, species {{arrive from}} the north, <b>some,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> black-tailed godwits, curlew {{sandpipers}} and little stints just passing through, pausing {{for a few}} days to refuel, others staying for the winter. This is also a good time to see bearded reedlings. Offshore, great and Arctic skuas, northern gannets and black-legged kittiwakes may pass close by in favourable winds.|$|E
5|$|Like Icelandic and Faroese, the {{development}} of English on the British Isles isolated it from the continental Germanic languages and influences, and has since undergone substantial evolution. English is thus not mutually intelligible with any continental Germanic language, differing in vocabulary, syntax, and phonology, although <b>some,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Dutch or Frisian, do show strong affinities with English, especially with its earlier stages.|$|E
5|$|Many of Oldham's present {{divisions}} and suburbs have origins as pre-industrial hamlets, manorial commons and ancient chapelries. <b>Some,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Moorside, exist as recently constructed residential suburbia, whilst places like Hollinwood exist as electoral wards and thoroughly industrialised districts. Throughout {{most of its}} recorded history, Oldham was surrounded by large swathes of moorland, which {{is reflected in the}} placenames of Moorside, Greenacres moor, Littlemoor, Northmoor among others.|$|E
50|$|Today, {{all nations}} use {{standard}} time zones for secular purposes, {{but they do}} not all apply the concept as originally conceived. North Korea, Newfoundland, India, Iran, Afghanistan, Burma, Sri Lanka, the Marquesas, as well as parts of Australia use half-hour deviations from standard time, and <b>some</b> nations, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Nepal, and <b>some</b> provinces, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the Chatham Islands of New Zealand, use quarter-hour deviations. <b>Some</b> countries, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> China and India, use a single time zone even though the extent of their territory far exceeds 15° of longitude.|$|R

Though its films were screened at least into the late 1940s, the company's output is likely lost.|$|E
5|$|The New World warblers are a {{group of}} small, often {{colorful}} passerine birds restricted to the New World.
