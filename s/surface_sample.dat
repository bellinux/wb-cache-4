40|$|Carbonyl sulfide (OCS) is emitted to the {{atmosphere}} through the outgassing of ocean surface waters. OCS is also {{the primary source of}} sulfur-containing compounds in the stratosphere and contributes to the formation of the stratospheric sulfate layer, an essential controller of the radiative balance of {{the atmosphere}}. During the 2016 Student Airborne Research Program (SARP), 15 whole air samples were collected on the NASA DC- 8 aircraft over the Santa Barbara Channel. Five additional <b>surface</b> <b>samples</b> were taken at various locations along the Santa Barbara Channel. The samples were analyzed using gas chromatography in the Rowland-Blake lab at UC Irvine, and compounds associated with ocean emissions including OCS, dimethyl sulfide (DMS), carbon disulfide (CS 2), bromoform (CHBr 3), and methyl iodide (CH 3 I) were examined. Excluding OCS, the vertical distribution of marine tracers that were analyzed showed dilution with increasing altitude. For OCS, the <b>surface</b> <b>samples</b> all exhibited elevated concentrations of OCS in comparison to samples taken from the aircraft, with an average of 666 ± 26 pptv, whereas the average concentration of OCS in the aircraft samples was 581 ± 9 pptv. 2016 <b>Surface</b> <b>samples</b> were compared to <b>surface</b> <b>samples</b> from SARP campaigns between 2009 - 2015 taken near or within the 2016 study region. The 2009 - 2015 samples exhibited an average OCS concentration of 526 ± 8 pptv. It is evident that the 2016 <b>surface</b> <b>samples</b> measured higher concentrations of OCS than ever recorded during previous SARP campaigns and in comparison to global averages: 525 ± 17 pptv in the Northern hemisphere and 482 ± 13 pptv in the Southern hemisphere (Sturges et al., 2001). OCS emissions should be measured using <b>surface</b> <b>samples</b> if emission estimates from the ocean are to be evaluated since measurements from the aircraft (500 ft) are not sufficiently capturing surface concentrations. Additionally, OCS enhancements seen in 2016 had never before been detected by <b>surface</b> <b>samples,</b> revealing a potential phenomenon at work causing the elevation during this year’s campaign...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to evaluate the detection efficiency of micro-vacuum <b>surface</b> <b>sampling</b> and <b>surface</b> wet wipe <b>sampling</b> in homes that had been identified with vermiculite attic insulation and/or other asbestos containing materials. <b>Surface</b> <b>samples</b> were collected pre and post weatherization activities and analyzed by transmission electron microscopy. Baseline sampling revealed that wet wipe sampling was more likely to detect surface asbestos contamination than micro-vacuum sampling; 55 % of <b>surface</b> wet wipe <b>samples</b> revealed detectable asbestos compared to 17 % of micro-vacuum samples. In addition, 16 % of the <b>surface</b> wet wipe <b>samples</b> revealed asbestos concentrations above the established background level of 10, 000 s/cm² compared with 3 % of micro-vacuum samples. Results of this study suggest that <b>surface</b> wet wipe <b>sampling,</b> in accordance with other sampling methods, is recommended for baseline testing to assess potential living space asbestos contamination...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability to}} place <b>surface</b> <b>samples</b> with Poisson disk {{distribution}} can benefit {{a variety of}} graphics applications. Such a distribution satisfies the blue noise property, i. e. lack of low frequency noise and structural bias in the Fourier power spectrum. While many techniques are available for sampling the plane, challenges remain for <b>sampling</b> arbitrary <b>surfaces.</b> In this paper, we present new methods for Poisson disk sampling with spectrum analysis on arbitrary manifold surfaces. Our first contribution is a parallel dart throwing algorithm that generates high-quality <b>surface</b> <b>samples</b> at interactive rates. It is flexible and can be extended to adaptive sampling given a user-specified radius field. Our second contribution is a new method for analyzing the spectral quality of <b>surface</b> <b>samples.</b> Using the spectral mesh basis derived from the discrete mesh Laplacian operator, we extend standard concepts in power spectrum analysis such as radial means and anisotropy to arbitrary manifold surfaces. This provides a way to directly evaluate the spectral distribution quality of <b>surface</b> <b>samples</b> without requiring mesh parameterization. Finally, we implement our Poisson disk sampling algorithm on the GPU, and demonstrate practical applications involving interactive sampling and texturing on arbitrary surfaces. © 2010 ACM. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

30|$|Difference in the ‘baking’ {{temperatures}} {{between the}} floor <b>surface</b> <b>samples</b> and the − 20 -cm level samples would probably also cause {{the differences in}} the rock magnetic characters. In the former samples, there are much more SD and/or SP titanomagnetite grains compared with the latter samples, and the former samples have high remanence intensities (e.g., ARM 0 s). From the view of the rock magnetic properties, the floor <b>surface</b> <b>samples</b> seem to be much more preferable for high-fidelity archeointensity researches.|$|R
50|$|Mathematically {{the surface}} {{embedded}} into a non-plane closed curve is called minimum if its area is minimal amongst all the surfaces passing through this curve. The best-known minimum <b>surface</b> <b>sample</b> is a soap film bounded by wire frame. Usually {{to create a}} minimum surface, a fictitious constitutive law, which maintains a constant prestress, independent of any changes in strain, is used. The alternative approximated approach to the minimum surface problem solution is based on SGM. This formulation allows one to minimize the surface embedded into non-plane and plane closed contours.|$|E

They found an excellent <b>surface</b> <b>sample,</b> staked several claims, and started their return trip to Haileybury to register them. When they arrived they were mobbed by a crowd who formed to see the samples. They received backing from a group in Scotland to develop the plots, forming the Scottish-Ontario Mine. The name later changed to Canusa (Canada-USA) and finally to Banner Porcupine over the years. The mine proved to have excellent surface gold veins, but stopped shortly underground and was never very productive.|$|E

40|$|A {{principle}} in <b>surface</b> <b>sampling</b> and mesh generation is that highly curved area should be sampled densely and vice versa. This paper presents an approach for automated <b>surface</b> <b>sampling</b> and adaptive mesh generation {{in accordance with}} the principle. The approach is self-organizing, forming topology-preserving mesh from random initialization. Mesh spacing versus surface curvedness can be easily controlled by a single parameter in the shape function. Key locations can be prescribed by imposing additional boundary conditions.

40|$|Objectives: Mycological {{contamination}} of occupational environments {{can be a}} result of fungal spores’ dispersion in the air and on surfaces. Therefore, {{it is very important to}} assess it in both types of the samples. In the present study we assessed fungal contamination in the air and in the <b>surface</b> <b>samples</b> to show relevance of <b>surfaces</b> <b>sampling</b> in complementing the results obtained in the air samples. Material and Methods: In total, 42 settings were assessed by the analysis of air and <b>surfaces</b> <b>samples.</b> The settings were divided into settings with a high fungal load (7 poultry farms and 7 pig farms, 3 cork industries, 3 waste management plants, 2 wastewater treatment plants and 1 horse stable) and a low fungal load (10 hospital canteens, 8 college canteens and 1 maternity hospital). In addition to culture-based methods, molecular tools were also applied to detect fungal burden in the settings with a higher fungal load. Results: From the 218 sampling sites, 140 (64. 2 %) presented different species in the examined surfaces when compared with the species identified in the air. A positive association in the high fungal load settings was found between the presence of different species in the air and surfaces. Wastewater treatment plants constituted the setting with the highest number of different species between the air and surface. Conclusions: We observed that <b>surfaces</b> <b>sampling</b> and application of molecular tools showed the same efficacy of species detection in high fungal load settings, corroborating the fact that <b>surface</b> <b>sampling</b> is crucial for a correct and complete analysis of occupational scenarios...|$|R

50|$|The alpha-scattering surface {{analyzer}} {{was designed to}} measure directly the abundances of the major elements of the lunar surface. The instrumentation consisted of an alpha source (curium 242) collimated to irradiate a 10 mm diameter opening {{in the bottom of}} the instrument where the sample was located and two parallel but independent charged particle detector systems. One system, containing two sensors, detected the energy spectra of the alpha particles scattered from the lunar surface, and the other, containing four sensors, detected energy spectra of the protons produced via reaction (alpha and proton) in the surface material. Each detector assembly was connected to a pulse height analyzer. A digital electronics package, located in a compartment on the spacecraft, continuously telemetered signals to earth whenever the experiment was operating. The spectra contained quantitative information on all major elements in the samples except for hydrogen, helium, and lithium. The experiment provided 46 hours of data accumulated from three lunar <b>surface</b> <b>sample</b> measurements. These measurements were of a portion of undisturbed local lunar surface, a lunar rock, and an extensively trenched area of the lunar surface. Data were obtained during the first and second lunar days, January 12 to 23, 1968, and February 13 to 21, 1968.|$|E
