2500|$|In March 1985, Capital Cities Communications {{announced}} it was purchasing ABC, a move that stunned the broadcast industry since ABC was some four times larger than Capital Cities at the time. Some have said that Capital Cities was only able {{to pull off the}} deal because WPVI-TV, the company's flagship property, had become very profitable in its own right. However, the merged company almost had to sell off Channel 6 due to a large <b>signal</b> <b>overlap</b> with WABC-TV. In the FCC's view, the merger gave the new company a de facto duopoly prohibited by the regulations of the time—the same [...] "one-to-a-market" [...] rule that forced Triangle to split its newspaper/broadcast combination in Philadelphia many years earlier. Capital Cities sought a waiver of the rules to keep WPVI, citing CBS' then-ownership of WCBS-TV in New York City and WCAU-TV locally in Philadelphia. The FCC granted the waiver, and when the transaction was finalized in early 1986, WPVI-TV became an ABC owned-and-operated station. A decade later, in 1996, The Walt Disney Company purchased Capital Cities/ABC.|$|E
50|$|XETV {{retained}} {{virtual channel}} 6 after a major reshuffle of Mexican virtual channels in October 2016, which ordered all existing Mexican national networks to realign their virtual channels {{based on the}} flagship channel numbers in Mexico City. XETV became the only channel 6 in Mexico, because the IFT reserved channel 6 for a potential fourth national network. Virtual channel 5 is not available to XETV because of <b>signal</b> <b>overlap</b> between XETV and KTLA (owned by Tribune, and broadcasting on virtual channel 5), primarily around Oceanside, California; most Tijuana stations face similar <b>signal</b> <b>overlap</b> issues in this area to Los Angeles stations that preclude them from using the virtual channels that correspond to their networks.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{the large}} <b>signal</b> <b>overlap</b> between WZPX and WPXD, local cable {{providers}} opted to carry WZPX as the Ion Television station since its signal is transmitted closer from Vermontville Township, within the Lansing television market. WPXD has since moved its transmitter to a tower in Southfield; as a result, its signal no longer covers Lansing or Jackson.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{fundamental}} {{theories of}} OFDM and WPM have many similarities in their functions and performance {{but there are}} some significant differences which give two systems to be distinctive.

50|$|In early 2001, Hearst bought Clarksburg-based NBC {{affiliate}} WBOY-TV, {{which has}} a significant <b>signal</b> <b>overlap</b> with WTAE-TV (a year earlier, the FCC began to allow companies to own television stations with overlapping coverage areas).

50|$|Jefferson Standard {{sold the}} station to the Shott family of Bluefield, West Virginia, {{publishers}} of the Bluefield Daily Telegraph and owners of WHIS-AM-FM-TV in Bluefield, in 1968. The move came because WBTV and WBTW had a fairly significant grade B <b>signal</b> <b>overlap,</b> and neither station {{would have been able}} to expand its signal if Jefferson Standard had kept them both.|$|E
5000|$|The Susquehanna Radio Corporation sold WSBA to Mohawk Broadcasting in 1983 and relaunched it as {{independent}} station WPMT (now a Fox affiliate).

30|$|A {{plethora of}} {{advanced}} signal processing mechanisms aim at reducing or eliminating potential interferences[20 – 22] has been proposed. SIC[20] decodes a relatively stronger <b>signal</b> from <b>overlapped</b> <b>signals</b> and then distracts a weaker signal by subtracting the stronger <b>signal</b> from the <b>overlapped</b> <b>signals.</b> This mechanism requires complex symbol level signal manipulation. Similarly, ZigZag[23] requires signal manipulation {{to recover the}} signal from the collided frames. It does not increase the wireless capacity but only reduces the number of retransmissions similar to PPR[24]. On the other hand, IAC[21], SAM[22], CSMA/CN[25] support concurrent transmissions by the interference alignment and interference cancellation using multiple signal streams obtainable in MIMO environments. It is worthwhile noting that our proposal, DOMCT, targets single antenna systems.|$|R

50|$|Capital Cities/ABC {{originally}} planned to retain WPVI-TV in Philadelphia, but FCC rules could have forced a sale of that station as well {{due to a}} large <b>signal</b> <b>overlap</b> with WABC-TV. Citing CBS' ownership of television stations in New York City (WCBS-TV) and Philadelphia (at the time WCAU-TV) under grandfathered status, Capital Cities/ABC requested, and received a permanent waiver from the FCC allowing it to keep WPVI. Had the request been denied, WXYZ-TV would have been retained instead.|$|E
50|$|As a result, CBS {{opted to}} keep WBZ-TV and sell WPRI to Clear Channel Communications (now iHeartMedia) on July 1, 1996 {{after less than}} ten months of ownership. Just months after the sale was announced, the FCC {{eliminated}} the requirement of a waiver for common ownership of television stations in adjacent markets with substantial grade B <b>signal</b> <b>overlap.</b> It began to permit common ownership of stations whose city-grade signals overlap when duopolies began to be permitted in 2000.|$|E
50|$|A {{short time}} later, Westinghouse {{announced}} it was buying CBS outright, a transaction which closed in late 1995. As a condition of the merger, both CBS and Group W were forced to sell off several radio stations due to the FCC's then-current ownership limits. CBS also had to sell recently acquired WPRI-TV in Providence, Rhode Island due to a significant <b>signal</b> <b>overlap</b> with WBZ-TV. At the time, the FCC normally did not allow common ownership of stations with overlapping signals.|$|E
40|$|An {{ultrasound}} contact {{imaging technique}} for detecting the restoration faults under the fillings in human tooth is proposed. A linear frequency modulated chirp signal {{is used to}} improve the signal-to-noise ratio and increase the penetration depth to allow the detection of the echoes from restoration-tooth boundary at 200 kPa acoustic pressure. Although the detection threshold is improved, {{it is observed that}} the duration of the excitation signal is longer than the duration of time of flight in the restoration, which causes <b>signal</b> <b>overlapping</b> between consecutive internal reflections. Due to these reverberations, the applied chirp signals interfere arbitrarily with the successive reflections, where the received echoes are not identifiable in the time domain. Separation in the frequency domain is not possible, since all reflections have the same bandwidth and the center frequency. In this work, the fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) is employed to separate chirp <b>signals</b> <b>overlapping</b> in both time and frequency domains. By analyzing the received echoes with FrFT, this work presents the ultrasonic non-destructive evaluation of dental restorations in human teeth...|$|R

50|$|The network gained {{its third}} station on December 1, 1977, when KOET (channel 3) in Eufaula was {{launched}} as a satellite of KOED-TV to serve areas of east-central Oklahoma (KOET's <b>signal</b> <b>overlaps</b> with OETA's two original stations {{in some areas}} of east-central Oklahoma: KOET's <b>signal</b> <b>overlaps</b> with that of KOED near and to the adjacent north of the Interstate 40 corridor portions of McIntosh County {{in that part of the}} state, and with KETA in portions of Creek, Okfuskee and Hughes Counties near State Highway 56). The expansion was made possible in part by a federal grant that was awarded to OETA in 1966, the proceeds of which were intended to fund the network's statewide expansion, in addition to being proportioned for the acquisition of color broadcasting equipment. In 1978, OETA produced the first program to be syndicated nationally by the member network to other public television stations, when it broadcast the U.S. Open Table Tennis Championships; that year also saw the premiere of OETA's first regionally syndicated series, The Other School System, a 13-part program co-hosted by Art Linkletter and former Miss America (and Clinton native) Jane Jayroe.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of simple mono- and {{oligosaccharide}} molecules, all proton signals are typically separated from one another (usually at 500 MHz or better NMR instruments) and can be assigned using 1D NMR spectrum only. However, bigger molecules exhibit significant proton <b>signal</b> <b>overlap,</b> especially in the non-anomeric region (3-4 ppm). Carbon-13 NMR overcomes this disadvantage by larger range of chemical shifts and special techniques allowing to block carbon-proton spin coupling, thus making all carbon signals high and narrow singlets distinguishable from each other.|$|E
50|$|In its June 2014 bill, Comcast {{systems in}} central New Jersey stated that KVNV would {{be added to}} its lineup on July 31, 2014. This was delayed because of {{objections}} from WFSB in Hartford, Connecticut, who voiced concerns to the FCC about the <b>signal</b> <b>overlap</b> of the two virtual channel 3s, as well as carriage on channel 3 in Fairfield County. WFSB's owner, Meredith Corporation, also suggested that the FCC assign virtual channel 33 (which is WFSB's RF channel) to KVNV instead of 3.|$|E
5000|$|Most jurisdictions {{have only}} a limited number of {{frequencies}} legally available for use by wireless networks. Usually, adjacent APs will use different frequencies (Channels) to communicate with their clients in order to avoid interference between the two nearby systems. Wireless devices can [...] "listen" [...] for data traffic on other frequencies, and can rapidly switch from one frequency to another to achieve better reception. However, the limited number of frequencies becomes problematic in crowded downtown areas with tall buildings using multiple APs. In such an environment, <b>signal</b> <b>overlap</b> becomes an issue causing interference, which results in signal droppage and data errors.|$|E

50|$|A {{variation}} of the omega wrap, such as that used by Echo Science Corporation of Mountain View, California in its instrumentation and high resolution video recorders in the late 1970s and 1980s, wraps the 1-inch tape about 190 degrees around the two-headed drum, so there is <b>signal</b> <b>overlap</b> between the two heads. Head switching in video recorders occurs instantaneously in the video models, during an horizontal sync interval. With a standard NTSC video signal a head can cover one sixth of a field each time it passed across the tape. Switching in instrumentation models is gradual, so the signals from both heads overlaps briefly, producing a transient-free output signal where the original signal does not contain convenient dead intervals during which a switching transient can be hidden.|$|E
50|$|For many years, {{the station}} {{operated}} at 26,000 watts {{from a tiny}} 540 ft tower, which was short-spaced to prevent interference with CBS affiliate WAFB-TV in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and later PBS member station KETG-TV in Arkadelphia, Arkansas. In the early 1980s, KTRE installed a new antenna and transmitter, operating at an increased power of 131 kilowatts, but never reached full power because of the short-space interference it would cause to those other stations. On another front, the new transmitter antenna was directional to minimize overlap with KLTV to comply with FCC duopoly rules, which until 2000, forbade one company to own stations in adjacent markets that had significant <b>signal</b> <b>overlap</b> (constituting them as an illegal duopoly, {{even though they were}} licensed to different television markets).|$|E
5000|$|The station first {{signed on}} the air on July 4, 1953. It was owned by Commonwealth Communications, as was WHP radio (580 AM and 97.3 FM, now WRVV). WHP-TV {{operated}} from studios located on Locust Street in Harrisburg {{as a member of}} the DuMont Television Network. The station lost DuMont when that network folded in 1956. WHP-TV later began to share CBS programming with WLYH-TV (channel 15) in Lebanon and WSBA-TV (channel 43) in York as part of the Keystone Network. This arrangement was necessary in the days before cable television, since the Harrisburg/Lancaster/York market is very mountainous and UHF signals do not travel very far in rugged terrain.

50|$|In 1998, after Argyle {{merged with}} Hearst Corporation's {{broadcasting}} unit (creating Hearst-Argyle Television), it swapped WNAC along with WDTN in Dayton, Ohio to Sunrise Television {{in exchange for}} WPTZ in Plattsburgh, New York, WNNE in Hartford, Vermont, and KSBW in Salinas, California. This was due to a significant <b>signal</b> <b>overlap</b> with WCVB-TV, Boston's ABC affiliate.

At the time, the FCC normally did not allow common ownership of two stations with overlapping signals and would not even consider granting a waiver for a city-grade overlap.

50|$|The company {{held onto}} the {{television}} station until 1985 {{when it was}} sold to AFLAC. It added the -TV suffix to its call sign on July 31, 1978. In 1997, AFLAC sold its broadcasting group to Retirement Systems of Alabama which merged with Ellis Communications to form Raycom Media. However, Raycom could not keep WITN for long due to a significant <b>signal</b> <b>overlap</b> with Wilmington's WECT, an Ellis property {{that was part of}} the deal. WITN's city-grade signal reaches the northern portion of the Wilmington market. At the time, the FCC normally did not allow one company to own two stations with overlapping signals, and would not even consider a waiver for a city-grade overlap.

50|$|WGBI {{went into}} a limited {{partnership}} with the Philadelphia Bulletin in 1958 and was renamed WDAU-TV after WCAU-TV in Philadelphia, which was also owned by the newspaper.

Even with new ownership, WDAU continued to rebroadcast WCBS's signal for network programming until the 1970s, when complaints about the poor quality of color network programming led it to buy a network feed. The limited partnership was short-lived, as the Bulletin sold its share of WDAU back to the Megargee family in 1959.
