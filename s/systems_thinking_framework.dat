This {{is the case}} of Carnegie Mellon University Silicon Valley's masters of science in {{software engineering}}. In this context, we have been using Essence Reflection Meetings for five semesters with 17 teams and approximately 70 students. During these meetings, the teams reflect on various project's dimensions based on a <b>systems</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>framework.</b> The positive results have been published in research papers. Activity and DiscussionsParticipants will learn about Essence Reflection Meetings for team-based project courses by practicing in a classroom environment. They will discuss challenges and solutions for team-based project courses, and how the proposed approach could potentially be leveraged in their own teaching environment. OrganizationWe will start the tutorial with a discussion revealing the participants positive and negative experiences with team-based projects. After briefly introducing the Essence's <b>systems</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>framework</b> and our research results, we will use hands-on training exercises to demonstrate how to use the approach. This will be followed with guided debriefing. Finally, we will go deeper into the Essence framework, and discuss our research results and their applicability in various teaching environments. Learning ObjectivesBy the end of the tutorial, participants will be familiar with a <b>systems</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>framework</b> that they can leverage to coach their students teams and monitor their progress.

40|$|Critical <b>systems</b> <b>thinking</b> (CST) and {{community}} based participatory research (CBPR) are distinct approaches to inquiry which share a primary commitment to holism and human emancipation, {{as well as}} common grounding in critical theory and emancipatory and pragmatic philosophy. This paper explores their intersections and complements on a historical, philosophical, and theoretical level, and then proposes a hybrid approach achieved by applying CBPR’s principles and considerations for operationalizing emancipatory practice to traditional <b>systems</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>frameworks</b> and practices. This hybrid approach is illustrated in practice with examples drawn from of {{the implementation of the}} learning organization model in an action research setting with the Autistic community. Our experience of being able to actively attend to, and continuously equalize, power relations within an organizational framework that otherwise has great potential for reinforcing power inequity suggests CBPR’s principles and considerations for operationalizing emancipatory practice could be useful in CST settings, and CST’s vocabulary, methods, and clarity around <b>systems</b> <b>thinking</b> concepts could be valuable to CBPR practitioners...|$|R

40|$|Empathic {{design is}} often {{described}} as a creative process that translates observations - typically of people and their behaviours into design ideas. Another similar and closely related expression is user centred design, which attempts to turn the attention away from an object or product towards its usefulness and usability. The central premise of empathic design is that the best-designed products and services result from understanding the needs of the people who will use them. User-centred designers engage actively with end-users to gather insights that drive design from the earliest stages of product and service development, right through the design process. [1] Our standard definitions and understanding of empathic design or user centred design are well recognised and widely practiced, particularly taught in design schools and in professional creative business. This paper extends and explores a deeper understanding of empathy within a <b>systems</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>framework</b> where the observer and subject are both components of empathic design.

40|$|As {{engineering}} systems {{become more}} complex, the roles involved {{in developing and}} managing such systems also become more complex. Thus, there is increasing interest in educating and training engineering professionals to think more systemically. In particular, there is an increasing need to accelerate the development of senior systems engineers. As new educational degree programs in systems rapidly emerge and as companies scurry to establish systems training programs to meet this need, fundamental questions still remain about how systems thinking develops in engineers. Increased understanding of the mechanisms that develop systems thinking will enable effective and efficient development of senior systems professionals. After reviewing related literature, an exploratory and inductive {{study was designed to}} gather data on enablers, barriers, and precursors to systems thinking development in engineers. In a field study conducted primarily in the United States aerospace sector, 205 interviews were conducted in 10 host companies. Senior systems engineers were studied to better understand how they developed systems thinking, and information was collected on company procedures for developing systems engineers. Using interview and survey data, comparisons were made of two control groups and senior systems engineers. (cont.) Proven stellar systems thinkers were also interviewed. To summarize the results, even though systems thinking definitions diverge, there is consensus on primary mechanisms that enable or obstruct systems thinking development in engineers. In order to reconcile the divergent definitions observed, a <b>systems</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>framework,</b> definition, and accompanying conceptual illustration are given. The data show that the primary mechanisms that enable systems thinking development include experiential learning, specific individual characteristics, and a supporting environment.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} {{with some of the}} major dilemmas in modern senior-secondary music education: attracting enrolments, devising relevant and engaging curriculum that is rigorous and capable of satisfying a range of future aspirations of music students, dealing with the disparity of students’ prior learning and experience levels, issues affecting pedagogy in an increasingly outcomes-driven environment, and so forth. The aims of this research are to improve the rigour and relevance of centralised, state-administered senior secondary music programmes via a multi-faceted approach that acknowledges the complexity and probable inter-relatedness of these dilemmas. The proposed approach provides a framework for understanding the interplay between curriculum design and content, assessment issues, pedagogy, and preparation for further musical pursuits, especially post-secondary studies. Once these relationships are understood, the underlying and most critical problems can be exposed and solutions proposed that are cognisant of this complex interplay. While such a systems thinking perspective has been applied widely in engineering, business and various social structures, the integration of such an approach to consider the issues surrounding education as a system is indeed very novel. A case study of the (1995 - 2000) Victorian (Australia) Certificate of Education (VCE) music and music performance study designs is used to demonstrate the application of such a multi-faceted approach towards improving senior-secondary music education models. Essential to the case study is an identification of the various strengths and weaknesses of the VCE music study designs, isolating problems and understanding their nature and scope. This is achieved via a research design involving extensive use of surveys of five demographic groups (VCE music students and teachers, tertiary students from VCE backgrounds, and tertiary lecturers and faculty/department heads), interviews, and literature-informed analysis. Detailed statistical analysis is presented, synthesised and cross-tabulated with demographic data to provide the necessary insights into differing perspectives and perceptions. The advantage of undertaking such a detailed case study is its capacity to illuminate a broad range of issues and allow the nexus between the various facets under consideration to be explored thoroughly. Thus, the primary aim of the case study is to enable an understanding of the complex interplay of factors at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. A secondary aim of the case study is to demonstrate that workable solutions to improve the rigour and relevance of the VCE music subjects can be, and indeed should be, devised from within such a multi-faceted perspective. Based on the insights obtained from the case study research, arguments for changes to the curriculum and assessment practices for each of the subjects are presented. Further, improved models of curricular content and assessment instruments are designed that consider their nexus with each other as well as with pedagogical issues and preparation for further musical pursuits. Implications for improvements to senior secondary music pedagogy, a consequence of modifications to curriculum and assessment, are discussed. Many of the recommendations of this research, as well as these proposed modifications, were adopted for the re-designed and reaccredited VCE music studies of 2000 - 2005 and beyond. This thesis thus makes significant contributions to policy-making, pedagogy, performance assessment methodology, and music education in general. It features an eclectic approach, drawing upon both quantitative and qualitative analysis, socio-historical research, and combined with a <b>systems</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>framework.</b> It is a novel attempt to understand the complex interplay affecting modern senior secondary music education in state-administered environments, and to demonstrate how this multi-faceted perspective is critical to achieving genuine and far-reaching improvements in music education...|$|E

NBSs can be divided into two main groups of strategies: soil solutions and landscape solutions. Soil solutions aim to enhance the soil health and soil functions through which local eco-system services will be maintained or restored. Landscape solutions mainly focus on the concept of connectivity. Making the landscape less connected, facilitating less rainfall to be transformed into runoff and therefore reducing flood risk, increasing soil moisture and reducing droughts and soil erosion we can achieve the sustainability.

40|$|The role of Manganese and {{minerals}} towards sustainable development in South Africa {{is a topic}} {{that has not been}} widely researched, despite the country’s dominant endowment of these mineral resources (SAMI, 2009). An alternative approach to evaluate beneficiation opportunities in the Manganese mining value chain as a resource, by investigating dynamic parameters that describe the pattern of sustainable development in the industry’s value chain, was addressed in this research. A systems thinking approach was investigated as a tool to review and solve sustainable development problems in the Manganese resources value chain. The research focused on the application of system dynamics modelling within the <b>systems</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>framework.</b> This was intended to establish a pattern of relationship and causality between the input parameters of the Manganese mining value chain and the key drivers of sustainable development. A system dynamics model was developed based on the primary published works of Forrester (1969, 1971), Schumpeter (1962), Meadows et al (1972) which were most recently reviewed by Meadows et al (2007) in their work on “Thinking in Systems” and Saeed (2010) in his work on “Economic Development, Creative Destruction and Urban Dynamics”. A specific focus on Manganese mining in the Northern Cape’s Kalahari basin was chosen to illustrate the impact of mineral resource beneficiation and the different value chain decisions over a 10 -year period, based on the dynamic sensitivities of the selected input parameters. A systems dynamic model was developed, inspired by the works of Meadows et al (2007) in systems thinking to describe the dynamic behaviour of the Manganese mining value chain {{and its impact on the}} economic activity of the Northern Cape region of John Taolo Gaetsewe (JTG), over the simulation period. Three value chain scenarios from “upstream mining” through “primary beneficiation” to “secondary beneficiation” of Manganese minerals were simulated on a system dynamics software platform and based upon the same Manganese Ore and input cost parameters. The patterns of feedback on each value chain scenario performance were evaluated based on a sensitivity analysis against power cost, rail cost and market price, as key dynamic parameters in the value chain. An improvement of the system dynamics model was developed, integrating the performance of the ”Secondary beneficiation” stage of the Manganese value chain to the system dynamics model describing the impact of infrastructure development on the economic activity of the Northern Cape, notwithstanding other industry contributions. Further system dynamics modelling of the secondary beneficiation as an integrated part of the economic system that includes human development and housing development, was conducted to further establish the impact of the secondary beneficiation scenario on infrastructure development and overall economic activity of the JTG region. The socio-economic development model was based upon the principle of relative attractiveness (Forrester, 1969) and the assertion by Perkins et al (2005) of the causal relationship between infrastructure development and economic development. Based upon the analysis of the research result of the dynamic simulation of the secondary beneficiation scenario, a framework for developing, evaluating and selecting beneficiation opportunities in South Africa‘s Manganese industry was established. The framework describes the key policy and investment decisions along the value chain in the Manganese industry, and identifies key drivers of performance at each stage of the value chain investment. The framework also highlights the potential areas of impact. The research introduces the ability to integrate the feedback loop system when simulating the potential performance of a Manganese resources value chain stage. The feedback mechanism that system dynamics modelling provides in the Vensim tool makes the tool relevant for the simulation of policy intervention in the Manganese mineral beneficiation scenario analysis and the same could be applied in other mineral commodities. The system dynamics model has demonstrated, by using the balance feedback variable, the impact of power (Eskom, 2012) and logistics capacity (Transnet, 2012), constraints on the ability of the Manganese resource value chain to meet the targeted depletion rates, irrespective of market demand. The second important contribution of this research is the ability to integrate the impact of single and multiple variables, and observe the impact of each variable using the integrated Monte Carlo function in the Vensim DSS (Vensim, 2010). By establishing a pattern of performance in various output elements in the model and their sensitivity to input variations, the investors can make bold and informed decisions at various stages of the Manganese resources value chain. In conclusion, the research recommends that the proposed framework be limited to use as a starting point to establish the necessary interventions. However it emphasises the need to conduct at great length, the normal business case and necessary feasibility studies that are required for any capital investment. The research highlights the dynamic nature of environmental conditions as a limitation to the application of the framework, and suggests that the framework be used carefully as a pre-condition to conventional business case studies when making investment or policy decisions.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{influenced}} by the objectives of the Mainstreaming Environment and Sustainability in African Universities Partnership which aims to enhance the quality and relevance of university education through implementation of Environmental Education and sustainability across university functions and operations. It contributes to Education for Sustainable Development through the development of tools to assess sustainability in higher education, investigating sustainability practices in universities and proposing strategies for improving mainstreaming of sustainability. It also contributes to systems approaches in mainstreaming contextual sustainability challenges in university functions and operations. The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate how universities can mainstream sustainability in their functions and operations in response to contextual sustainability challenges in a changing environment using a systems approach. The research was a case study of Rhodes University in South Africa, which is situated in the impoverished Eastern Cape Province. The study involved 12 teaching departments (representing all faculties at the university), four research units and institutes, five managements units, the Estates Division and the Student Representative Council. The theoretical framework of the study draws from a critical realist ontology and systems thinking epistemology. Systems thinking emphasises the interdependencies of phenomena, thus providing the methodology and tools for a systems view of relationships between education and the environmental context in which it is embedded. Critical realism was employed as an underlabourer to systems thinking as it provides for some of the dimensions absent in systems thinking including its depth ontology which facilitates isolating causal factors influencing empirical reality. It recognises that explanation of phenomena can be embedded in history and acknowledges the fallibility of knowledge. The data collection methods employed in the study include a sustainability assessment using a Unit-based Sustainability Assessment Tool developed as part of the study, interviews, content analyses and observations. Data analyses were performed through employing morphogenetic analysis, and inductive, abductive and retroductive modes of inference. The morphogenetic analysis of social transformation/reproduction was employed to trace the historical emergence of sustainability initiatives at Rhodes University. Induction facilitated reorganisation of the data into themes which particularly represent the main sustainability activities at Rhodes University. Abduction, through recontextualising data in a <b>systems</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>framework,</b> enabled further insights into the phenomena. In the study, it enabled use of systems lenses as a framework and led to identification of systemic issues affecting mainstreaming and later, the development of systems thinking approaches in mainstreaming sustainability. Retroduction enabled identification of causal mechanisms which influenced the emergence of sustainability initiatives at the university. The study established that the emergence of sustainability initiatives at Rhodes University followed the 1990 Talloires Declaration and paralleled international institutional developments in relation to environmental and sustainability challenges. Since then, sustainability initiatives have continuously been emerging in various operational dimensions of the university in line with emerging sustainability challenges which resulted in a morphogenetic cycle. The study revealed that Rhodes University has mainstreamed sustainability across the functions and operations of most of the departments/divisions/units forming part of the study, especially in functions like teaching, research, community engagement and operations. There were a few exceptions like the Human Resources Division and to an extent the Research Office/Management Division which are not yet considering sustainability in their operations. While most of the teaching departments had sustainability initiatives in teaching, research and community engagement, there was diversity in the dimension(s) of sustainable development that the departments addressed and this seemed to relate to the disciplinary content of their subjects. In the Estates Division sustainability initiatives included sustainable landscaping, campus environmental management, water and energy conservation initiatives, waste recycling, use of biodiesel, to mention a few. Students were also involved in various sustainability activities especially through voluntary community engagement initiatives. Sustainability initiatives at the university were also discovered to be embedded within and responding to sustainability challenges of the immediate university environment of Makana District. The study unearthed the causal mechanisms enabling and constraining mainstreaming activities at the university. These were found to be embedded in the history and context within which the university is operating, and other factors related to university structures and agency of lecturers, other employees and students. Examples of these factors are unsustainable patterns in society, policies and the need to redress past inequalities. The study noted the existence of systemic issues at the university which need to be addressed to enable and enhance the promotion of a systems approach to mainstreaming: notably, complexity owing to diversity of approaches employed in mainstreaming, the absence of clearly defined university sustainability goals, problems of institutional support and in some cases, disciplinary governing rules which do not leave room for mainstreaming sustainability. The study established the possibility of improving mainstreaming of sustainability through the adoption of more explicit systems approaches. It suggests use of systems models including the systems-environment model, the functions/structure model and the motion picture model in the process. It recommends making the goal of mainstreaming more upfront, developing a shared understanding of sustainability and mapping out/defining contextual sustainable development issues to grapple with. The study also recommends adopting a holistic approach in mainstreaming, making it a campus-wide initiative, involving all students and developing interdisciplinary curricula. It suggests setting up of supporting mechanisms to strengthen, extend and spearhead mainstreaming and enhancement of collaborative work in sustainable development issues...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Zoonotic {{diseases}} such as leptospirosis occur {{as a result of}} the often complex interactions that exist at the human-animal-environment interface. The most obvious consequence of this complexity is the need for the health sector to partner with institutions in other sectors of society such as agriculture, labour and local government. This multisectoral engagement is complicated by the different agendas and cultures of the various institutions and their ability to “see” their role and ant benefits in a collaborative response. Methods The research used a realist review methodology combined with <b>systems</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>frameworks</b> to determine the optimal strategy and governance for the prevention and control of leptospirosis in Fiji. The process included facilitated workshops with multiple stakeholders to determine the needs, issues and potential interventions that was guided by a synthesis of locally available data and information on the impact of leptospirosis. This process was informed by interviews with bureaucrats from different government ministries. Results Stakeholders concurred that leptospirosis generally only received wide-spread attention in outbreaks, when there is media coverage of deaths or a large number of hospitalisations. In general, all ministries expressed support for a multisectoral strategy but saw the Ministry of Health and Medical Services as the lead agency with overall responsibility. The final consultation workshop yielded a clearly articulated goal to reduce the case fatality rate attributable to leptospirosis by 50 % by 2020 and 4 overarching strategies: 1) improved clinical management of leptospirosis, 2) improved surveillance for leptospirosis, 3) enhanced communication to minimise risk and improve health seeking behaviours, and 4) strengthening coordination and governance structures. Conclusion Human mortality and morbidity remained the primary drive for government action, defining leptospirosis as a human health problem. The process of deliberative consultation, and the engagement of multidisciplinary partners has provided a platform for collaborative policy development, and a consensus for a National Action Plan from which further negotiated collaboration will be possible...|$|R

In an education for sustainability (EfS) context this means emphasizing relationships, relationships between all the systems on our planet, and at different systems levels, {{as they relate}} to the environment, economics, government, health, and so on. Values and goals are also important aspects of these relationships. Sterling (2003 a, p. 2) argues that" [...] . we are educated by and large to 'compete and consume' rather than to 'care and conserve [...] Furthermore, the same author maintains that because of the imposition of managerial and economic values on education we have lost touch with the social values and real life contexts of authentic education (Sterling, 2003 a, p. 2).

The ‘Energy Cultures’ conceptual framework aims {{to assist in}} understanding {{the factors that influence}} energy consumption behaviour, and to help identify opportunities for behaviour change. Building on a history of attempts to offer multi-disciplinary integrating models of energy behaviour, we take a culture-based approach to behaviour, while drawing also from lifestyles and <b>systems</b> <b>thinking.</b> The <b>framework</b> provides a structure for addressing the problem of multiple interpretations of ‘behaviour’ by suggesting that it is influenced by the interactions between cognitive norms, energy practices and material culture.

It has already provided a basis for cross-disciplinary collaboration, and for multi-disciplinary research design, and has provided insights into behavioural change in a case study community.

40|$|Data-driven {{decision}} support systems, such as data warehouses, are extremely costly to develop. Forty one per cent of data warehouse development practitioners have experienced project failures. These projects were either completed after exceeding budget and time limits, {{or not at}} all. Some influential data warehousing authors advocate user involvement as a solution, while others focus on technical factors to improve data warehouse success. This study proposes a framework for data warehousing success based on <b>systems</b> <b>thinking</b> methodology. <b>Systems</b> <b>thinking</b> implies a holistic approach to problem solving. A system {{is a set of}} interrelated elements. A systems approach represents a broad view, taking all aspects into account and concentrating on interactions between different parts of the problem. This study investigates the practices of data warehousing professionals from a <b>systems</b> <b>thinking</b> point of view, before proposing a framework for the explicit use of specific <b>systems</b> <b>thinking</b> methodologies in data warehouse development. Interpretive case study research is used to investigate practices of data warehousing professionals in three different organisations. Pattern matching is used to analyse collected data. This is done by mapping practices to different <b>systems</b> <b>thinking</b> perspectives. However, the theory component of the thesis is not a description of current data warehousing practices from a <b>systems</b> <b>thinking</b> point of view, as in typical interpretive research. The theory component relates more to critical research in that it is meant to change data warehousing practices towards specific <b>systems</b> <b>thinking</b> methodologies. The proposed framework incorporates three sources of information. These are a literature study on <b>systems</b> <b>thinking</b> philosophy, methodology and practice; a literature study on data warehousing and data warehousing success factors; and the results of case studies on current practices of data warehousing professionals analysed from a <b>systems</b> <b>thinking</b> perspective. The <b>framework</b> gives a methodological foundation for a holistic approach to data warehousing with maximum user involvement. It views a data warehouse as a system with typical systems characteristics, such as specified objectives relating to the organisation’s objectives, an environment, available resources, specified components and effective management.

40|$|In arid {{ecoregion}} of Rajasthan, India, {{common pool}} resources (CPRs) like common pastures and village water bodies provide ecosystem {{services such as}} fodder, fuel, timber, water and medicinal plants which are crucial for the livelihoods in particular of the poor. In western Rajasthan livestock keeping {{is the most important}} and resilient component of the agricultural systems which strongly depends on common pastures. However, the grazing areas have become severely degraded making the rural poor more vulnerable. A number of efforts have been made to improve the management of and rehabilitate the community pastures (Conroy and Lobo, 2002; Agrawal, 2003). The success of such initiatives was unreliable and even the strong involvement of elected village councils (Panchayats) has not helped. Post-project sustainability of new management practices remains uncertain due to cumbersome social dynamics, neglect of institutional arrangements as well as an overemphasis on technical and externally controlled interventions (Jodha, 2001; Chaudhry et al., 2011; Mishra and Kumar, 2007). Previous empirical research using the social-ecological <b>systems</b> <b>thinking</b> and <b>framework</b> (Ostrom, 1990, 2007; Wade, 1998; Baland and Plateau, 1996) has helped to better understand CPR governance challenges.

It involves developing a list of events that could affect the ability of the enterprise to meet its objectives. The focus in this paper is on how risk management components are related to entity performance indicators in order to identifying events that could influence the performance and business control effectiveness. The paper suggests general procedures for identifying events that affects business performance using holistic <b>system</b> <b>thinking</b> to develop <b>framework</b> for identification of events that could threat the organization's ability to achieve its performance objectives. The purpose is to understand the basic fundamentals in identifying, specifying, selecting and implementing quality indicators to create a powerful management reporting.

40|$|Background: The School Health Program (SHP) in the Republic of Panama {{includes}} preventive healthcare services {{delivery and}} referral issuing at elementary schools nationwide. Despite these early prevention efforts, {{a majority of}} referrals are apparently not achieving their desired outcome. This idea {{is supported by the}} SHP data showing preventable diseases on the rise. Thus, learning the outcome rates of particular referral outcomes may provide a basis for appropriately targeted action. Methods: Three focus groups were conducted with health workers, medical records staff, and teachers, respectively. Following <b>systems</b> <b>thinking</b> and <b>framework</b> analysis, a pilot plan for referral tracking and referral outcome rates obtainment was developed. Finally, the SHP team was surveyed for their perception on the effectiveness and feasibility of the plan, for future implementation. Results: Themes related to referral tracking led directly {{to the development of a}} referral tracking pilot plan (RTPP). Survey data analysis revealed that the SHP team perceived the RTPP as an effective way to obtain complete referral tracking and referral outcome rates, and they also found it feasible to implement. Conclusion: Keeping referral records and tracking the SHP referrals is perceived, by those that will be involved in its delivery, as achievable by implementing a RTPP developed from their own recommendations. Once implemented, the resulting obtainment of referral outcome rates may allow them to know if the SHP preventive objective for issuing these referrals is being properly achieved, and to prioritize for targeted action where needed...|$|R
40|$|A system evolves, or {{responds}} to change, {{in ways that}} depend upon its internal structure and {{the characteristics of the}} environment within which it exists. For a social system, the structure of internal regulation (i. e. governance) is human-made, created out of that society’s history and culture. In the author’s opinion, it is desirable for socio-political reasons that this governance structure has the ability to evolve in order to achieve the changing goals of its citizens. The governance structure should also be able to respond to alteration in society’s biophysical environment, to ensure maintenance or improvement of the joint sustainability of the society itself and the greater environmental system within which it exists and upon which it is dependent. This paper examines aspects of the problem that arises {{as a result of the}} systemic incompatibility of the viewpoints of the two main paradigms from which this situation is commonly addressed; the political-economic and the biophysical. It is argued that unless these can be included within a more advanced perspective that acknowledges emergent complexity as its central characteristic, the viability of the global system, let alone that of societies within it, cannot be assured. It is suggested that this problem can usefully be addressed via <b>Systems</b> <b>Thinking.</b> A <b>framework</b> for addressing the issue is presented, based on Bossel’s Orientor Theory, together with examples of its application. The outcome of an exercise of this type will be strongly influenced by the ethical position adopted by societies and the institutional structures put in place to enable them to filter appropriate from inappropriate options. ...|$|R
40|$|The U. S. Forest Service (USFS) Enterprise Program (EP), which {{provides}} fee-for-service consulting {{services to the}} USFS, is interested in integrating <b>systems</b> <b>thinking</b> into its service offerings. Despite there being several excellent sources on the range and diversity of <b>systems</b> <b>thinking,</b> no single <b>framework</b> exists that thoroughly yet concisely outlines what <b>systems</b> <b>thinking</b> is along with its deep history, theoretical tenets, and soft and hard approaches. This thesis {{is an attempt to}} create such a framework, aimed specifically at practical application in a land management agency, through literature synthesis injected with original analysis. The usefulness of the framework is then tested using three case studies within the EP and the agency as a whole. The framework highlights several important aspects of <b>systems</b> <b>thinking,</b> both generally and related specifically to social-ecological management. First, <b>systems</b> <b>thinking</b> is the transdisciplinary study of complex phenomena from a holistic, rather than reductionist, perspective. The world {{can be viewed as a}} massive set of embedded systems [...] elements with relations that lead to nonlinear behavior [...] making the role of the observer essential in identifying scales of interest and interactions amongst them. Second, the deep history of holistic thinking suggests that its modern scientific study could benefit from exploring the East 2 ̆ 7 s long-standing cultural and spiritual approaches to holism through cognitive unity and oneness with mankind and nature. Third, categorizations of systems approaches as 2 ̆ 2 soft 2 ̆ 2 versus 2 ̆ 2 hard 2 ̆ 2 are helpful but can distract us from the ultimate goal of <b>systems</b> <b>thinking,</b> which is to understand the various tools in the <b>systems</b> <b>thinking</b> toolbox so as to apply them critically and creatively to make a meaningful difference in the world. Fourth, I see the soft systems approaches as having a distinct <b>systems</b> <b>thinking</b> orientation and the hard systems approaches as overlapping substantially with operations research, the close cousin of <b>systems</b> <b>thinking.</b> Fifth, I identify a spectrum of complexity, contending that <b>systems</b> <b>thinking</b> tends to be concerned with what I call subjectively and computationally complex systems, as well as complex adaptive systems, leaving simple systems for other approaches. Finally, I contend that it is the soft systems approaches and the two theoretical pillars of hierarchy theory and cooperation theory that will aid wicked social-ecological problem solving the most. The framework is applied to three case studies. Examination of the EP reorganization using a hard systems approach revealed two critical high-level functions that were absent in the current structure, paving the way for new designs that could take those functions into account. Analysis of an initiative to increase citizen recreation on USFS lands showed that a systems approach had been improperly applied and how the application of a soft approach at the onset could have systematically framed the problem and offered unique normative insights for giving voice to relevant non-agency stakeholders as well as nature and future generations. And viewing the perennial problem of wildfire management through the lens of cooperation theory revealed how USFS leadership could take a more active role in promoting the long-term outlook, durable relationships, and reciprocal behaviors that are required for cooperative improvement to take place. As environmental narratives worsen and the need for transitioning towards sustainable ways of living heightens, <b>systems</b> <b>thinking</b> offers ever-increasing value to resource managers for its ability to deal with the many perspectives and normative content that underlie wicked problems and to help to illuminate potential consequences of system interventions given the interplay of complex structural dynamics across space and time...|$|R
