Near {{the end of a}} project -- when schedule performance is often a primary concern -- the usefulness of traditional schedule metrics is demonstrably poor.

However, when a project is completed, its SV is always 0 and SPI is always 1, even if the project was delivered unacceptably late.

Lipke has summarized these limitations and proposed the concept of “Earned Schedule” (ES) {{to address these issues}} in his article “Schedule is Different ” [1]. ES aims to measure schedule performance using a time-based measure from which time based measures of Schedule Variance (SV (t)) and <b>Schedule</b> <b>Performance</b> <b>Index</b> (SPI (t)) metrics are derived. The ES concept is claimed to be analogous to Earned Value and can be used to calculate measures intended to be analogous to EVMs cost based counterparts. I have retrospectively applied the ES measures proposed by Lipke to my small portfolio of six projects and subprojects managed using a “simplified ” EVM approach. This paper shares the data and results of that study. The conclusion is that the ES concept has validity. The ES based schedule metrics more accurately portray a project’s schedule performance compared to the EVM equivalents. It is concluded that the ES measures and metrics are expected to have utility similar to their cost based counterparts, the recognized strength of EVM, and a greater utility than their historic EVM based equivalents.

40|$|Earned Value Management (EVM) {{has been}} a {{well-known}} methodology used since the 1960 s when the US department of defense proposed a standard method to measure project perfor-mance. This system relies {{on a set of}} often straightforward metrics to measure and evaluate the general health of a project. These metrics serve as early warning signals to timely detect project problems, or to exploit project opportunities. A key aspect of EVM is to estimate the completion cost of a project by considering both cost and <b>schedule</b> <b>performance</b> <b>indices.</b> However, good <b>performance</b> of cost and <b>schedule</b> <b>performance</b> <b>indices</b> does not necessarily guarantee cost effec-tiveness of the project regardless of the overhead costs. The reason is because, in most project-based organizations, overhead costs constitute a significant proportion of the total costs. Howev-er, EVM indices are usually calculated {{in the absence of the}} so-called overhead costs. This paper, first, seeks to remedy this problem by proposing a practical procedure of allocating overhead costs in project-based organizations. Then the traditional EVM indices are revised by consider-ing the allocated overhead costs. Finally, a case study demonstrates the applicability of the pro-posed method for a real-life project...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: As it {{is common}} in project {{management}} context, Earned value analysis usually integrates time and cost performance within the project scope. It helps the project manager {{to understand how to}} deal with project from two points of view. The first is to recognize current performance indexes and the second one is to provide a forecast to the future. However, most of decisions in this regard have taken based on <b>Schedule</b> <b>Performance</b> <b>Index</b> (SPI) and Cost Performance Index (CPI) while there is no a well organized control mechanism in which detect their situations as it is, not only numerically but also recognize/categorize current situation of the earned value management system linguistically.

Accurate cash flow forecasting is essential to all contractors in the construction Industry for successful operation and existence in the long run. At initial stages of a project the cash flow aspect of the contractor is negative. The main role of project financing is to cover up this negative flow in a beneficial, cost effective manner. Mobilization Advance Payment enhances the quality and productivity in the construction industry. It improves the performance and cost efficiency of the contractors as well as the clients. Cash data in relation to thirty projects were collected. Three criteria, no Mobilization Advance, 20 % of the initial contract sum as the Mobilization Advance paid at the inception of the project and 20 % of the initial contract sum as Mobilization Advance given in stages, were identified to determine the differences in the effects of cash flow. The effect of these different criteria on the cumulative cash flow was examined. Further <b>Scheduled</b> <b>Performance</b> <b>Index</b> was calculated for further analysis.

40|$|<b>Schedule</b> <b>performance</b> <b>index</b> of {{earned value}} method has been {{reported}} to generate misleading results at times because of its failure to account for criticality of activities involved, as well as its consideration of monetary values for status reporting. Material {{can be seen as the}} fuel needed to execute projects from inception to completion. Material installed provides good indicators of progress achieved onsite vis-a-vis project schedule performance. It correlates well with the role of the <b>schedule</b> <b>performance</b> <b>index</b> (SPI) of the earned value method (EVM). Material is recognized to have a significant impact on achieved progress for physical completion of project activities. This research project is geared towards circumventing the reported limitations of SPI. It presents a study on the development of material status index (MSI) in support of the EVM. Unlike the SPI, the newly developed index accounts for the criticality of project activities. The proposed method is composed of two modules: current status reporting and forecasting. The two modules include selection procedures that allow for engaging only (near) critical activities and by extension materials that impact project duration. Consideration of criticality is carried out via the total float of each activity and percent float (i. e. the ratio of float to activity duration). The MSI current status reporting and also the forecasting module utilize seventy-eight material based factors recognized to cause schedule delays. These factors were reported in a number of studies, primarily the CII 2011 publication on “Global Procurement and Materials Management” and are refined by means of a structured interview with an experienced practitioner in industry. They cover the supply chain material management before material reaches the site, once material is at the gate prior to acceptance and finally onsite. A simulation model is run utilizing users’ judgment on the applicability of these probable causes to the project at hand in the forecasting module. The simulated model serves as input to the forecasting function, which generates probability distribution of forecasted project duration. MSI, can independently and jointly with SPI provide root causes behind problems encountered during project execution. MSI serves to provide added value in alerting management to take corrective actions. A software application is developed to automate the process of MSI method. To validate and demonstrate capabilities of the developed method, it is implemented on two case studies in which the introduced enhancements are clearly portrayed. Forecasting duration and reporting on schedule performance of project using MSI as a supplementary index is more accurate because of its consideration of level of criticality of project activities and capturing actual progress represented by quantity of material installed...|$|E

Having time-based measures and indicators to describe the schedule performance of a project is highly logical and offers considerable advantages over the EVM cost approach to schedule depiction.

Overall progress (consists of Engineering Procurement Construction) till July 2015 had already reached 65 %. In the item of civil construction work until this August 2015 is about 48 % so that effort in accelerating the work implementation should be made soon to pursue a delay that until now still have deviation. The acceleration of implementation work was done by some simulations, like in simulation 1 there is no additional workers, simmulation 2 is additional overtime hours, simulation 3 is additional workers and equipment, and also there is additional overtime hours as many {{as the number of}} workers and equipments in simulation 4. The analysis is focused on foundation work and the structure of the building/area in which the material already available there and should be installed (erection) because their work is a critical path and directly impact on steam power plant system. From the analysis, it obtained the optimum cost and time that the simulation of 3 get the optimum cost as much as Rp 6. 377. 772. 000 and cost performance index (CPI) as much as 0, 98 and simulation 4 get optimum time of 183 days and <b>schedule</b> <b>performance</b> <b>index</b> (SPI) of 1, 01...|$|E
40|$|The {{calculation}} of the IndependentEstimate at Completion (IEAC) is sig-nificant to project management. It is a quick method facilitated by using Earned Value Management to predict the final project cost. Project managers (PM) and cost analysts often use IEAC to validate the bottoms-up forecast made by contract sources. When the IEAC result is substan-tially different from the contractor’s esti-mate, more than likely the PM will ques-tion the discrepancy. The PMs also use the IEAC to justify continuation of the pro-ject to upper management. Thus, you can see IEAC has far reaching implications. During the last 10 years, primarily due to the interest generated from the cancel-lation of the Navy’s A- 12 Avenger acqui-sition program, studies of the predictive accuracy of the various methods for cal-culating IEAC have been made. These studies considered and included several IEAC formulas and regression calculation methods. In general, no single specific method {{has been shown to}} be superior. Although no particular method pro-vided accurate results for all periods or phases of a project, some fundamental characteristics were observed. With the establishment of these characteristics, the application of some of the IEAC formu-las and calculation methods appears to be questionable. However, these fundamen-tals have provided inspiration for propos-ing new IEAC methods in this article. Studies of IEAC and Cost Performance Index There are several popular formulas for calculating IEAC. In general, the equa-tions use the cost to date added to the forecast cost for the work remaining. For the formulas identified here, the Cost Performance Index (CPI) and <b>Schedule</b> <b>Performance</b> <b>Index</b> (SPI) are the cumula-tive values unless otherwise noted 1. The following are the IEAC formulas most often seen and used...|$|E

40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} for designing optimal feedback controllers for systems having subsystem sensitivity constraints. Such constraints reflect {{the presence of}} subsystem <b>performance</b> <b>indices</b> which are {{in conflict with the}} <b>performance</b> <b>index</b> of the overall system. The key to the approach is the use of relative <b>performance</b> <b>index</b> sensitivity (a measure of the deviation of a <b>performance</b> <b>index</b> from its optimum value). The weighted sum of subsystem and/or operational mode relative <b>performance</b> <b>index</b> sensitivies is defined as an overall <b>performance</b> <b>index.</b> A method is developed to handle linear systems with quadratic <b>performance</b> <b>indices</b> and either full or partial state feedback. The usefulness of this method is demonstrated by applying it to the design of a stability augmentation system (SAS) for a VTOL aircraft. A desirable VTOL SAS design is one that produces good VTOL transient response both with and without active pilot control. The system designed using this method is shown to effect a satisfactory compromise solution to this problem...|$|R
