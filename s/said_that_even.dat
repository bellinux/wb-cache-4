5|$|Chopra {{said in an}} {{interview}} that Saif Ali Khan and Vidya Balan were not the first choices for the lead roles in Parineeta. In fact Abhishek Bachchan was being cast as Shekhar and Saif Ali Khan as Girish. However Abhishek walked out of the project and Saif readily was accepted as a replacement. This fact was corroborated by Saif in {{an interview}} when he <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> though Sarkar had faith in his abilities, Chopra was not too keen on having him.|$|E
5|$|In Didden v. Village of Port Chester (2006), an {{unrelated}} case {{brought about by}} the same town's actions, Sotomayor joined a unanimous panel's summary order to uphold a trial court's dismissal – due to a statute of limitations lapse – of a property owner's objection to his land being condemned for a redevelopment project. The ruling further <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> without the lapse, the owner's petition would be denied due to application of the Supreme Court's recent Kelo v. City of New London ruling. The Second Circuit's reasoning drew criticism from libertarian commentators.|$|E
5|$|Justice Stevens wrote a brief {{dissenting opinion}} {{arguing that the}} case should have been {{dismissed}} because the Illinois legislature has largely reduced penalties for marijuana possession, which made it ridiculous for the officers to rush to get a warrant. He <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> if he reached {{the merits of the}} question, he would affirm and hold the search unconstitutional because the majority misapplied a balancing of “privacy-related and law enforcement-related concerns". He wanted to give broader protection to the idea of the home as a place for protection, even if the home in this case was a trailer.|$|E

5|$|On 26 August 2013, a local lawyer Ranjana Agnihotri filed a {{habeas corpus}} {{petition}} in the Allahabad High Court's Lucknow bench, on which judges Imtiyaz Murtaza and D K Upadhayaya passed the release order for Rambhadracharya, along with Singhal and Praveen Togadia. The petitioner's advocate H S Jain <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> though Rambhadracharya {{and other leaders}} were arrested under the section 151 of the 1973 Criminal Procedure Code, which permits an arrest to prevent commission of cognisable offences, the custody period cannot exceed 24 hours unless any other section of the code or any other law is applicable. After his release, Rambhadracharya said {{that the government had}} creating misconceptions about the yatra.|$|E
5|$|Stephen Morris has <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> without Curtis's suicide, it was {{unlikely}} that Joy Division would have endured as they were. The members of Joy Division had made a pact long before Curtis's death that, should any member leave, the remaining members would change the name of the group. Eventually renaming themselves New Order, the band was reborn as a three-piece with Sumner assuming vocal duties; the group later recruited Morris's girlfriend Gillian Gilbert to round out the line-up as keyboardist and second guitarist. Starting as a member of punk group The Inadequates, Gilbert had become friends with the band's members and had played guitar at a Joy Division performance when Curtis had been unable to play.|$|E
5|$|Combat {{received}} a polarized response; critics alternately called the battles deep and satisfying or shallow and repetitive. Reviewers considered the combat mechanics to be simplistic while allowing for complex tactics, {{and others said}} that the requirement to actively defend against enemy attacks and enhance offense kept fights engaging. Others also praised the combat but considered the mechanics to be robust and elaborate, presenting a solid role-playing combat system concealed under the intentionally simplistic visuals. Some reviewers said {{that a lack of}} depth made combat gradually become repetitive; they <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> when combat is funny and engaging, {{by the end of the}} game the battles can become routine. Joystiq stated that defense was more interesting than offense because it relied on time-sensitive reactions to creative enemy attacks such as Al Gore giving a presentation. Destructoid said there are too few powers available for offense for the game to remain interesting for long. GameSpot found combat was too easy and lacking in challenge because of an abundance of supplement items such as health packs that were found more frequently than they were used, and powerful abilities that quickly subdued opponents. Others disagreed, stating that the variety offered in combat, such as character abilities, allies, weapons, armor, and upgrades, ensured it always felt fun. The effects of the enhancements were sometimes considered to be confusing, and typically relying on simply equipping the highest level item available. Joystiq said the special characters that can be summoned during battle were extreme in terms of power and entertainment value.|$|E

25|$|A 2006 bill {{proposed}} {{setting up}} an organ donation register where people can give informed consent to organ donations and clearly state their legally binding wishes. However, the bill did not pass, and there was condemnation of the bill from some doctors, who <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> if a person had given express consent for organ donation to take place, they would not carry out the procedure {{in the presence of}} any disagreement from grieving family members.|$|E
25|$|Because {{smuggling}} {{was still}} rampant, he ordered close inspection of all ships arriving in port. This measure was ineffective, however. The smugglers used small boats and made landings on deserted beaches, transferring their illegal goods to confederates in the colony. Because of complaints from Spanish merchants, chiefly in America, Spain broke {{relations with the}} Hanseatic League. The viceroy prohibited Hanseatic ships from anchoring in Veracruz. When this legal source of a large quantity of merchandise was blocked, smuggling rose. It was <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> the vicereine dressed in contraband cloth from England or from Flanders.|$|E

25|$|When the Germany reoccupied the Rhineland in February 1936, Churchill was holidaying in Spain, and {{returned}} to a divided Britain. Labour opposition was adamant in opposing sanctions and the National Government was divided between advocates of economic sanctions and those who <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> these {{would lead to a}} humiliating backdown by Britain, as France would not support any intervention. Churchill's speech on 9 March was measured and praised by Neville Chamberlain as constructive. But within weeks Churchill was passed over for the post of Minister for Co-ordination of Defence in favour of the Attorney General, Sir Thomas Inskip.|$|E

The battle ended on 24 March where the Mirs lost and the city came {{into the hands of the}} British. The battle at Dabo landed an even greater part of Sindh in the laps of the British regime and the city surrendered to the British. Being the last stronghold in the way of the British, the city once conquered, completed the British Conquest of Sindh.|$|E

25|$|Before broadcast, {{the plot}} of series two was closely guarded. Cast members were sworn to secrecy about the details, and {{required}} to sign non-disclosure agreements. Actor Andrew Buchan said cast members were told little about the plot, except on a need-to-know basis as they prepared for their performances in each episode. Actor Joe Sims said that actors only receive two scripts {{at a time to}} ensure {{that they did not know}} where the plot was headed. Several different endings for series two were filmed, and Chibnall <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> cast members would remain in the dark about the programme's outcome until the final episode aired.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to Zionists who quote the Maharal's commentary on Ketubot, anti-Zionist writers have <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> if the oaths {{are to be}} seen as decrees, it was obviously not God's intent that the Jewish people should keep trying to return to the Land of Israel and build a state until they hit the right moment. In view of the harsh consequences of failure ("I will declare your flesh ownerless like the gazelles and hinds of the field"), this would be as foolish as playing Russian roulette. Furthermore, the success of the State of Israel so far is not proof that the decree has been annulled, since the future of the state is still uncertain.|$|E
25|$|The {{current price}} of CFLs {{reflects}} the manufacturing {{of nearly all}} CFLs in China, where labour costs less. In September 2010, the Winchester, Virginia, General Electric plant closed, leaving Osram Sylvania and the tiny American Light Bulb Manufacturing Inc. the last companies to make standard incandescent bulbs in the United States. At that time, Ellis Yan, whose Chinese company made the majority of CFLs sold in the United States, said {{he was interested in}} building a United States factory to make CFL bulbs, but wanted $12.5 million from the U.S. government to do so. General Electric had considered changing one of its bulb plants to make CFLs, but <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> after a $40 million investment in converting a plant, wage differences would mean costs would be 50% higher.|$|E
