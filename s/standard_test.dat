5|$|The gold <b>standard</b> <b>test</b> for biliary {{obstruction}} {{is still}} {{endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography}} (ERCP). This {{involves the use of}} endoscopy (passing a tube through the mouth into the esophagus, stomach and thence to the duodenum) to pass a small cannula into the bile duct. At that point, radiocontrast is injected to opacify the duct, and X-rays are taken to get a visual impression of the biliary system. On the endoscopic image of the ampulla, one can sometimes see a protuberant ampulla from an impacted gallstone in the common bile duct or the frank extrusion of pus from the common bile duct orifice. On the X-ray images (known as cholangiograms), gallstones are visible as non-opacified areas in the contour of the duct. For diagnostic purposes, ERCP has now generally been replaced by MRCP. ERCP is only used first-line in critically ill patients in whom delay for diagnostic tests is not acceptable; however, if the index of suspicion for cholangitis is high, an ERCP is typically done to achieve drainage of the obstructed common bile duct.|$|E
5|$|The strongest {{clues to}} the {{function}} of the cerebellum have come from examining the consequences of damage to it. Animals and humans with cerebellar dysfunction show, above all, problems with motor control, {{on the same side of}} the body as the damaged part of the cerebellum. They continue to be able to generate motor activity but lose precision, producing erratic, uncoordinated, or incorrectly timed movements. A <b>standard</b> <b>test</b> of cerebellar function is to reach with the tip of the finger for a target at arm's length: A healthy person will move the fingertip in a rapid straight trajectory, whereas a person with cerebellar damage will reach slowly and erratically, with many mid-course corrections. Deficits in non-motor functions are more difficult to detect. Thus, the general conclusion reached decades ago is that the basic function of the cerebellum is to calibrate the detailed form of a movement, not to initiate movements or to decide which movements to execute.|$|E

40|$|An {{algorithm}} for an electrophysiological {{approach to}} {{carpal tunnel syndrome}} is proposed. This technical note {{takes into account the}} <b>standard</b> <b>tests,</b> comparison tests and needle electromyography. If the <b>standard</b> <b>tests</b> are negative, a comparison study can be done to identify cases of minimal or very mild carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). If comparison studies are negative, CTS can be ruled out and a search for other causes have to be made. If the <b>standard</b> <b>tests</b> are positive, carpal tunnel syndrome can be divided into extreme, severe,moderate and mild cases. Motor comparison study is useful in extreme CTS cases. Needle electromyography is a must in all cases where the <b>standard</b> <b>tests</b> are positive. This streamlined approach allows accurate diagnosis with minimum essential tests...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an aphasic patient, RH, who, on <b>standard</b> <b>tests</b> of language comprehension, {{appears to have}} a severe comprehension deficit. We compared performance on these <b>standard</b> <b>tests</b> with that obtained on tasks which measure the processes involved in constructing a representation of the speech input as it is heard (so-called “on-line ” tasks). Performance on these on-line tests was essentially normal, whereas performance on <b>standard</b> <b>tests</b> of comprehension was no better than chance. These data are interpreted in terms of a distinction between the mental processes involved in constructing a representation and those involved in consciously reflecting upon it...|$|R

25|$|The CRI {{can also}} be {{theoretically}} derived from the SPD of the illuminant and samples since physical copies of the original color samples are difficult to find. In this method, care {{should be taken to}} use a sampling resolution fine enough to capture spikes in the SPD. The SPDs of the <b>standard</b> <b>test</b> colors are tabulated in 5nm increments , so it is suggested to use interpolation up to the resolution of the illuminant's spectrophotometry.|$|E
25|$|In {{boundary}} scan testing, test circuits integrated into various ICs {{on the board}} form temporary connections between the PCB traces to test that the ICs are mounted correctly. Boundary scan testing requires that all the ICs to be tested use a <b>standard</b> <b>test</b> configuration procedure, the most common one being the Joint Test Action Group (JTAG) standard. The JTAG test architecture provides a means to test interconnects between integrated circuits on a board without using physical test probes. JTAG tool vendors provide various types of stimulus and sophisticated algorithms, not only to detect the failing nets, but also to isolate the faults to specific nets, devices, and pins.|$|E
25|$|The {{efficiency}} of the solar cells used in a photovoltaic system, in combination with latitude and climate, determines the annual energy output of the system. For example, a solar panel with 20% efficiency and an area of 1m2 will produce 200W at <b>Standard</b> <b>Test</b> Conditions, but it can produce more {{when the sun is}} high in the sky and will produce less in cloudy conditions and when the sun is low in the sky. In central Colorado, which receives annual insolation of 5.5kWh/m2/day, such a panel can be expected to produce 440kWh of energy per year. However, in Michigan, which receives only 3.8kWh/m2/day, annual energy yield will drop to 280kWh for the same panel. At more northerly European latitudes, yields are significantly lower: 175kWh annual energy yield in southern England.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the relationship between teachers' beliefs toward learning and beliefs toward <b>standard</b> <b>tests.</b> During the study, correlational survey research model, one of the research models, is adopted. As data collection tool; "Belief Scale Towards Learning" and "Beliefs About Standardized Tests Scale" is used. Data is collected from 659 different branches of teachers, 306 female and 353 male. For analyzing the data; descriptive statistical analyzing methods and correlation-regression analysis are used. According to the findings, it is determined that teachers’ beliefs towards constructivist learning are higher than the beliefs towards traditional learning. Secondly, it’s determined that there is a positive and significant relationship between beliefs towards traditional learning and beliefs towards <b>standard</b> <b>tests.</b> Furthermore, it’s found that there is negative and significant relationship between beliefs towards <b>standard</b> <b>tests</b> and beliefs towards constructivist learning. Finally, it’s determined that the beliefs toward traditional and constructivist learning are significant predictor of beliefs toward <b>standard</b> <b>tests...</b>|$|R
