40|$|Is {{there an}} effect of aid on {{democracy}} conditional on instability from trade ? This paper reinvestigate the debated effect of aid on democracy with a new specification. We take advantage of previous empirical findings explaining the role of aid in mitigating the adverse effects of external shocks, and argue {{that in the long}} term, aggregate aid flows can potentially dampen the effects of terms-of-trade instability on the quality of democracy. An empirical investigation with data from 70 developing countries (28 of them african countries) over the period 1980 - 2003 (pooled in two twelve-years periods) provides supportive results. Moreover, the data suggest that terms-of-trade instability affects democracy through income instability.

The trends in ODA flows indicate a reversal in aid flows to the continent since 2000, with subsequent increases in <b>aid</b> <b>intensity</b> and dependence. Although the more recent literature on aid is doubtful if aid only spurs growth in a in a good policy environment, the aid-institutional debate indicates a clear aid-institutional paradox, especially relating to the macroeconomic effects, the fiscal response, the absorptive capacity and the good governance aid debates. The literature further indicates that aid could serve as a barrier to vulnerable societies. From the donors' perspective, it is evident that quantity of aid does not imply quality and that the ultimate responsibility lies with recipient governments to ensure more efficient absorption of aid.

The Gender and Development approach was created in response, to discuss international development in terms of societal gender roles and to challenge these gender roles within development policy.

40|$|Why do donors {{continue}} to send foreign aid to corrupt countries, despite that corruption is increasingly seen as detrimental to {{economic and environmental}} development? This study unpacks the complex relationship between corruption and aid fatigue and suggests that while corruption reduces support for foreign aid, reactions to corruption in aid depend on both {{the circumstances under which}} corruption occurs and prospects for accountability. Building on scenario-based experiments, the results show that the end results of aid, the scale and the perceived social normality of corruption influences the effect of corruption on aid fatigue. They also show that corruption generates <b>specific</b> <b>aid</b> fatigue (directed towards individual projects or actors) rather than support for generalized (across-the-board cuts) in aid levels. This contributes towards explaining why previous studies have failed to find a link between corruption and aid fatigue and how citizens deal with the ”aid-corruption paradox”, i. e. that the need for foreign aid is often the greatest in corrupt environments...|$|R
