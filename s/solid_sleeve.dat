5000|$|A bushing, {{also known}} as a bush, is an {{independent}} plain bearing that is inserted into a housing to provide a bearing surface for rotary applications; this is {{the most common form of}} a plain bearing. Common designs include <b>solid</b> (<b>sleeve</b> and flanged), split, and clenched bushings. A sleeve, split, or clenched bushing is only a [...] "sleeve" [...] of material with an inner diameter (ID), outer diameter (OD), and length. The difference between the three types is that a solid sleeved bushing is solid all the way around, a split bushing has a cut along its length, and a clenched bearing is similar to a split bushing but with a [...] (or [...] ) across the cut. A flanged bushing is a sleeve bushing with a flange at one end extending radially outward from the OD. The flange is used to positively locate the bushing when it is installed or to provide a thrust bearing surface.|$|E
5000|$|In sailing, pintles insert into {{gudgeons}} {{that are}} normally {{affixed to the}} transom of a boat. Normally, the corresponding pintle fitting on the rudder slides, lowers or clips into the gudgeon. There are variations where gudgeons are mounted to the rudder and boat, and a pivot clevis pin is inserted into these gudgeons, or the pintles are fastened to the boat, and gudgeons {{are attached to the}} rudder. In any case, the fitting with the hole is referred to as a gudgeon. They are used to attach the rudder to the boat so that it can swing freely. The rudder can then be turned with the tiller. There must be at least two gudgeon/pintle sets for stability in the rudder's attachment to the transom. The pintles must face the same direction for insertion into the gudgeons and usually one is a bit longer so it can be the first into its gudgeon, giving some stability for the insertion of the other pintle. To prevent the rudder from rising out of the gudgeons there is often some preventer such as rudder weight or a locking device slid across the path of the pintle's removal from the upper gudgeon (also referred to as a Rudder Stop).Really good installations (gudgeons) have bushings, (plain bearing) either a <b>solid</b> <b>sleeve,</b> flanged or clenched. This will allow for smoother operation of the helm and preserve the pintles and gudgeons. A bushing can be seen as [...] "consumable".|$|E
40|$|Recent machine {{studies at}} the Advanced Photon Source (APS) showed that at a beam current of about 140 mA, the storage ring (SR) injection-area {{components}} experienced unacceptable elevated temperatures. Heating of these components is related to several factors, namely: aperture discontinuity, poor contact between the rf fingers and the <b>solid</b> <b>sleeve</b> liner, inadequate x-ray shielding, and nonuniform conductive coating on the kicker ceramic chambers. To address these deficiencies, we have developed design upgrades for the injection-area kicker magnets, vacuum chambers, transition absorbers, and bellows-liner assemblies. In this paper, we discuss important features of the new designs {{and their impact on}} machine operation at high beam current...|$|E
40|$|Proposed brain-surgery tool has an {{octogonal}} fixture for positioning {{latex tube}} over incision. Eight stainless-steel wires embedded in latex extend to hold positioning fixture. Another eight are also {{embedded in the}} latex. Concentric sleeves are successively inserted into expandable latex tube. The first sleeve is placed over a <b>solid</b> rod. Last <b>sleeve</b> is a stainless-steel tube 1 inch in diameter. It is overcoated with Teflon (or equivalent) material...|$|R
50|$|Such {{gearboxes}} {{had been}} built before, but neither widely used nor successfully. Porsche had used one for his 1907 Maja, {{with a series of}} internal pawls inside the shaft which could be pushed out one-by-one to engage the gears. Goggomobil and Claude Hill of Ferguson, had both used an internal 'bung' sliding inside the shaft to push out a locking cam or balls through the hollow shaft and engage the gears. Archie Butterworth's AJB Special had used a <b>sleeve</b> over a <b>solid</b> shaft, the <b>sleeve</b> sliding lengthways to engage the gears and also to act as the other gear's bearing surface. The Butterworth design was the one chosen. The designs were so similar that Chapman initially negotiated with Butterworth for the rights to use it, but without any final agreement.|$|R
25|$|Freddy Krueger's {{physical}} appearance has remained largely consistent throughout the film series, although minor {{changes were made}} in subsequent films. He wears a striped red-and-green sweater (<b>solid</b> red <b>sleeves</b> in the original film), a dark brown fedora, his bladed glove, loose black trousers (brown in the original film), and worn work boots, {{in keeping with his}} blue collar background. His skin is scarred and burned as a result of being burned alive by the parents of Springwood, and he has no hair at all on his head as it presumably all burned off. In the original film, only Freddy's face was burned, while the scars have spread to the rest of his body from the second film onwards. His blood is occasionally a dark, oily color, or greenish in hue when he is in the Dreamworld. In the original film, Freddy remains in the shadows and under lower light much longer than he does in the later pictures. In the second film, there are some scenes where Freddy is shown without his bladed glove, and instead with the blades protruding from the tips of his fingers. As the films began to emphasize the comedic, wise-cracking aspect of the character, he began to don various costumes and take on other forms, such as dressing as a waiter or wearing a Superman inspired version of his sweater with a cape (The Dream Child), appearing as a video game sprite (Freddy's Dead), a giant snake-like creature (Dream Warriors), and a hookah smoking caterpillar (Freddy vs. Jason).|$|R
500|$|During this time, {{there were}} two popular kinds of armour: the ō-yoroi (lit. [...] "great armour") with a boxlike appearance, mainly worn by {{high-ranking}} samurai on horseback, and the lighter and more flexible dō-maru that wrapped around the body and was initially worn by lower-ranking foot soldiers. The ō-yoroi was made of leather and iron lames bound together in horizontal layers, ornamented and reinforced with leather, silk and gilt metal. It originated around the 10th century but was only commonly used starting with the Genpei War {{at the end of}} the 12th century. Being the most complete and elaborate Japanese armour, it was also worn for ceremonies. The tighter fitting dō-maru, developed in the 11th century, was generally made of a combination of leather and metal and did not include a <b>solid</b> breastplate or <b>sleeves.</b> In many cases its armour plates were replaced with scales of metal, leather or whalebone laced together with silk or leather cords. Even though it was a plainer armour compared to the ō-yoroi, upper class samurai started to adopt it around 1300, as battles began to be fought on foot favouring a more comfortable suit. Three dō-maru, fifteen ō-yoroi armours and one pair of gauntlets have been designated as National Treasures. Most of the items include a helmet and large sleeve protectors.|$|R
