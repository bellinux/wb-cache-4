5|$|During Shepherd's surgery, {{his hand}} becomes numb, and he frustratedly exits the {{operating}} room. In the intern appendectomy, Wilson {{makes a mistake}} and freezes, leading to a scolding from Meredith Grey. Back in Minnesota, Yang is annoyed by the peppy attitudes of her superiors at Mayo Clinic, Dr. Craig Thomas (William Daniels) and Dr. Parker (Steven Culp), so she decides to take a trip to Seattle for Sloan's death. However, her PTSD hinders her from boarding the plane, and she ultimately remains in Minnesota. Meanwhile, Dr. Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams), now a plastic surgical fellow, <b>sits</b> <b>by</b> Sloan's bedside and talks of medical cases to him. Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.) enters Sloan's hospital room and removes him from life support. Unable to cope with Sloan's death, Meredith Grey boards a plane to visit Yang, but panics before it takes off. Shortly thereafter, Meredith Grey finds Karev at the airport bar, where he reveals {{that he will be}} staying at Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital. The next morning, Hunt visits Dr. April Kepner (Sarah Drew) at her family's farm, and asks her to begin working in Seattle again. At the conclusion of the episode, Torres returns home to Robbins, who is revealed to have had her lower left leg amputated {{as a result of the}} crash.|$|E
25|$|This fresco {{depicts a}} meeting of all the most learned ancient Athenians, {{gathered}} in a grand classical setting around the central figure of Plato, whom Raphael has famously modelled upon Leonardo da Vinci. The brooding figure of Heraclitus who <b>sits</b> <b>by</b> a large block of stone, is a portrait of Michelangelo, and is {{a reference to the}} latter's painting of the Prophet Jeremiah in the Sistine Chapel. His own portrait is to the right, beside his teacher, Perugino.|$|E
25|$|Since {{around the}} late 1990s, the three-button scrollmouse {{has become the}} de facto standard. Users most {{commonly}} employ the second button to invoke a contextual menu in the computer's software user interface, which contains options specifically tailored to the interface element over which the mouse cursor currently <b>sits.</b> <b>By</b> default, the primary mouse button sits located on the left-hand side of the mouse, {{for the benefit of}} right-handed users; left-handed users can usually reverse this configuration via software.|$|E

25|$|The {{schedule}} of the Court's sittings is determined every {{year by the}} Chief Justice. In general, the Court sits throughout the year except during the mid-year and end-year court vacations (usually end of May to end of June, {{and the beginning of}} December to the beginning of January respectively). The Chief Justice also appoints the places where the Court sits. When the Supreme Court moved from the Old Supreme Court Building and City Hall Building at 1 and 3 Saint Andrew's Road respectively to the present Supreme Court Building at 1 Supreme Court Lane, the Chief Justice formally appointed the new building as a place where the Court of Appeal <b>sits</b> <b>by</b> way of a notification dated 20 June 2005.|$|E
25|$|The video {{takes place}} in a dance hall. There are {{teenagers}} and young children that resemble N-Dubz. The actual group do not have a physical appearance in the video. A young boy, (Akai Osei), that has a small part in the movie tries to join their dance crew but he is ignored because they are all watching an older boy street dance. The younger boy <b>sits</b> <b>by</b> himself and eventually gets up and starts street dancing by himself, the members of the dance crew see him and decide to watch him dance instead. The older boy shakes his hands and everyone starts cheering. Scenes from the movie are shown throughout the video, including Britain's Got Talent winners, Diversity and George Sampson and also contestants Flawless.|$|E
25|$|The High Court sits {{on every}} day of the year except Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays, {{although}} a Judge may lawfully sit on such days if directed to do so by the Chief Justice or if the Judge is of the opinion that the business to be despatched is extremely urgent. The High Court sits at such times and at such places as the Chief Justice appoints from time to time. When the Supreme Court moved from the Old Supreme Court Building and City Hall Building at 1 and 3 Saint Andrew's Road respectively to the present Supreme Court Building at 1 Supreme Court Lane, the Chief Justice formally appointed the new building as a place where the High Court <b>sits</b> <b>by</b> way of a notification dated 20 June 2005.|$|E

25|$|Weeks later, on {{his first}} day back at the office, excited to see his story in print, Pabst arrives empty-handed and informs them the whole month's run of the {{magazine}} has been pulped, as the owner wouldn't publish a story featuring a black hero. Pabst tells Benny he is being forced to fire him as well. Benny breaks down; he screams that although the world can deny him, they cannot destroy his ideas and the future he envisions is real. He collapses to the floor sobbing and is taken away by an ambulance. As he falls unconscious, he looks through the window and, rather than the city, sees stars streaking past. The preacher <b>sits</b> <b>by</b> him and tells him that he is both the dreamer and the dream. Sisko wakes up back on the station. He is deeply moved by his vision, and wonders if somewhere Benny Russell is dreaming of Deep Space Nine.|$|E
500|$|McCay's son Robert unsuccessfully {{attempted}} to revive Gertie with a comic strip called Dino. He and Disney animator Richard Huemer recreated the original vaudeville {{performance for the}} Disneyland television program in 1955; {{this was the first}} exposure the film had for that generation. [...] Walt Disney expressed to the younger McCay his feeling of debt, and gestured to the Disney studios saying, [...] "Bob, all this should be your father's."

2500|$|One evening, Nanami follows Asahi as {{he leaves}} the apartment, and while she tails him runs into Toko and {{together}} they follow him onto an overnight bus to Hiroshima. In the morning, they follow as he visits several people before Toko leaves to visit the Peace Park. Asahi visits his family grave, then <b>sits</b> <b>by</b> the riverside, and while waiting Nanami discovers in the jacket of Toko's borrowed jacket a letter from Nagio to Toko, saying that her family asked him to stop seeing her as they believe his asthma {{is a result of}} the atomic bomb.|$|E
2500|$|Beldham {{retired to}} Tilford, {{where he was}} {{initially}} the landlord for some years of a public house, The Barley Mow, and spent his last 41 years there. The census returns of 1841, 1851 and 1861 refer to him as, variously, a [...] "bat maker" [...] and an [...] "old cricketer". In his seventies, he was interviewed by James Pycroft, author of The Cricket Field. One of the common misconceptions concerning Beldham is that he fathered anything up to thirty six children by two wives. While he did marry twice, he was in reality far less prolific: by his first wife Ann Smith (1765–1800) he had one daughter, also Ann, born (and died) 1800. His second wife, another Ann (1779–1869), bore him eight children between 1804 and 1819 and eventually outlived him by some seven years. Beldham and his second wife are buried in the local churchyard, just up {{the road from the}} green: their graves are unmarked, but are thought to be in the north-west corner. Beldham's cottage still <b>sits</b> <b>by</b> the side of the pub, albeit with the later addition of an upper floor.|$|E
