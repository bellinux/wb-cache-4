5|$|Bosa {{appears as}} a saint in an 8th-century liturgical {{calendar}} from York, the only <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> he was venerated as a saint before the Norman Conquest of England. The 16th-century English antiquary John Leland included Bosa in his list of saint's resting places in England, giving it as York. Bosa's feast day is 9 March.|$|E
5|$|Mormons {{believe that}} the Star of Bethlehem was an actual astronomical event visible the world over. In the Book of Mormon, which they believe {{contains}} writings of ancient prophets, Samuel the Lamanite prophesies that a new star will appear as a <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> Jesus has been born, and Nephi later writes about the fulfillment of this prophecy.|$|E

5|$|Reuters {{journalist}} Keith Coffman {{stated that}} the defeat was a <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> Democrats who control Colorado government had reached too far, not just on gun-control, but in other areas also, such as not considering religious exemptions for same sex adoptions, or same-day voter registration.|$|E
5|$|A {{particularly}} damning {{piece of}} evidence came from a bonnetmaker named Maria Durden who told the court that Webster had visited her {{a week before the}} murder and had said {{that she was going to}} Birmingham to sell some property, jewellery and a house that her aunt had left her. The jury interpreted this as a <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> Webster had premeditated the murder and convicted her after deliberating for about an hour and a quarter.|$|E
5|$|After much contemplation, {{she chose}} not to abdicate. Joseph himself often {{threatened}} to resign as co-regent and emperor, but he, too, was induced not to do so. Her threats of abdication were rarely taken seriously; Maria Theresa believed that her recovery from smallpox in 1767 was a <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> God wished her to reign until death. It was in Joseph's interest that she remained sovereign, for he often blamed her for his failures and thus avoided taking on the responsibilities of a monarch.|$|E

5|$|After {{some months}} of travel, Heraclius entered Constantinople in triumph and {{was met by}} the people of the city, his son Heraclius Constantine, and Patriarch Sergius, prostrating {{themselves}} in joy. His alliance with the Persians resulted in the recovery of the Holy Sponge which fastened to the True Cross in an elaborate ceremony on 14 September 629. The ceremonial parade went toward the Hagia Sophia. There, the True Cross was slowly raised up until it vertically towered over the high altar. To many, this was a <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> a new golden age was about to begin for the Byzantine Empire.|$|E
5|$|Anne had {{explained}} before {{that she did}} not wish the public to know that her relationship with Sarah was failing, because any <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> Sarah was out of favour would have a damaging impact on the Duke of Marlborough's authority as Captain-General. Sarah was kept in all of her offices – purely for the sake of her husband's position as Captain-General of the army – and the tension between the two women lingered on until early in 1711. This year was to see the end of their relationship for good.|$|E
5|$|Anxious {{to protect}} the Papal States' {{precarious}} diplomatic position, the Cardinal Secretary of State Giacomo Antonelli liaised with Rome's Jewish community to arrange a meeting with Momolo Mortara, and received him politely in early August 1858. Antonelli promised that the matter would be referred to the Pope and granted Momolo's request that he be allowed to visit Edgardo regularly in the House of Catechumens. Kertzer cites Antonelli's concession of repeated visits, {{as opposed to the}} usual single meeting, as the first <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> the Mortara case would take on a special significance.|$|E

5|$|Billy Tate was a 14-year-old Pony Express rider {{who rode}} the express trail in Nevada near Ruby Valley. During the Paiute {{uprising}} of 1860 he was chased by {{a band of}} Paiute Indians on horseback {{and was forced to}} retreat into the hills behind some big rocks where he killed seven of his assailants in a shoot-out before being killed himself. His body was found riddled with arrows but was not scalped, a <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> the Paiutes honored their enemy.|$|E
5|$|Colbert dropped {{hints of}} a {{potential}} presidential run throughout 2007, with speculation intensifying following the release of his book, I Am America (And So Can You!), which was rumored (invariably by Colbert himself) to be a <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> he was indeed testing the waters for a future bid for the White House. Colbert staunchly refused to confirm or deny his candidacy, stating {{he had not yet}} made up his mind and must first talk the possibility over with his family.|$|E
5|$|Criticisms of Abercrombie {{begin with}} his {{reliance}} on relatively poor intelligence. Reports reached {{him that the}} French strength at Carillon was 6,000, and that a further 3,000 were expected. Many of these reports were from French deserters or captives, and Abercrombie should have investigated them by sending out scouts or light infantry. Even if the reports were accurate, Abercrombie's army still significantly outnumbered that of Montcalm. The same sources must also have reported the shortage of provisions at the fort, a <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> a siege would have ended quickly.|$|E

5|$|In 766 Æthelbert succeeded Ecgbert as archbishop; he was consecrated 24 April 767, {{the feast}} {{day of his}} {{predecessor}} Wilfrid. This may have been deliberate and a <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> Æthelbert wished to revive Wilfrid's ambitions for the archiepiscopal see. Æthelbert received his pallium from Pope Adrian I in 773. Alcuin was appointed head of the cathedral school after Æthelbert became archbishop. Much of Alcuin's description of Æthelbert's time as archbishop has the flavour of a panegyric, as Alcuin praised Æthelbert as a model bishop suitable for other bishops {{to use as a}} role model.|$|E
5|$|In May 1098, Kerbogha of Mosul {{approached}} Antioch {{to relieve}} the siege. Bohemond bribed an Armenian guard named Firouz to surrender his tower, and in June the crusaders entered the city and killed most of the inhabitants. However, {{only a few days}} later the Muslims arrived, laying siege to the former besiegers. According to Raymond D'Aguilers, it was at this point that a monk named Peter Bartholomew claimed to have discovered the Holy Lance in the city, and although some were skeptical, this was seen as a <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> they would be victorious.|$|E
5|$|In {{the court}} of Vizhnitz, it was known that if the Rebbe asked for a {{cigarette}} to smoke {{in the middle of}} reading a kvitel, it was a <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> the petitioner's request had been accepted. Rabbi Eliezer Dovid Friedman, a follower of the fourth Vizhnitzer Rebbe, Rabbi Chaim Meir Hager, witnessed this in 1965 when he delivered a kvitel to the Rebbe on behalf of a Melbourne Jew stricken with cancer and the Rebbe asked for a cigarette while reading the kvitel. The man recovered completely. However, in 1972, immediately after the death of the Rebbe, the Melbourne Jew fell ill with the same disease and succumbed to it.|$|E

However, there were indications that it {{had already begun to}} weaken. Outflow towards the north was becoming restricted and arc clouds began emanating from the storm, a <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> dry air was entering the system. During the afternoon hours, the structure of Josephine began to rapidly deteriorate as strong wind shear and dry air took their toll. By the late night, the center was almost completely exposed and only a band of convection persisted near the center.|$|E

In these monologues Mitchell has criticised a variety of subjects, including the BBC show Doctor Who and 3D television. Matt Warman of the Daily Telegraph suggested that the series could be a <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> new comedy will increasingly become available online, rather than on television. The series has been released on DVD.|$|E
