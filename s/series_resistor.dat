25|$|To {{minimize}} loading, attenuator probes (e.g.,10X probes) are used. A typical probe uses a 9megohm <b>series</b> <b>resistor</b> shunted by a low-value capacitor {{to make an}} RC compensated divider {{with the}} cable capacitance and scope input. The RC time constants are adjusted to match. For example, the 9megohm <b>series</b> <b>resistor</b> is shunted by a 12.2pF capacitor for a time constant of 110microseconds. The cable capacitance of 90pF in parallel with the scope input of 20pF and 1megohm (total capacitance 110pF) also gives a time constant of 110 microseconds. In practice, {{there will be an}} adjustment so the operator can precisely match the low frequency time constant (called compensating the probe). Matching the time constants makes the attenuation independent of frequency. At low frequencies (where the resistance of R is much less than the reactance of C), the circuit looks like a resistive divider; at high frequencies (resistance much greater than reactance), the circuit looks like a capacitive divider.|$|E
25|$|The shunt {{connection}} results in smoother transfer characteristics and lower signal distortions, {{but also in}} a lower modulation range (−60dB). This limitation is lifted by connecting two shunt dividers in series, which keeps the transfer characteristic smooth. The best combination of a smooth transfer characteristic, low distortion, wide range of adjustment, and nearly equal rates of increase and decrease of the transmission coefficient is achieved in a series-parallel circuit composed of two ROs and a <b>series</b> <b>resistor.</b> The frequency response of such circuit {{is similar to that}} of the series connection.|$|E
25|$|Within the {{time-frame}} of {{the capacitance}} change (as much as 50ms at 20Hz audio signal), {{the charge is}} practically constant and the voltage across the capacitor changes instantaneously to reflect the change in capacitance. The voltage across the capacitor varies {{above and below the}} bias voltage. The voltage difference between the bias and the capacitor is seen across the <b>series</b> <b>resistor.</b> The voltage across the resistor is amplified for performance or recording. In most cases, the electronics in the microphone itself contribute no voltage gain as the voltage differential is quite significant, up to several volts for high sound levels. Since this is a very high impedance circuit, only current gain is usually needed, with the voltage remaining constant.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, an {{approach}} for the pad modeling {{of the test}} structure for Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor (MOSFET) up to 40 GHz is presented. The approach {{is based on a}} combination of the conventional equivalent circuit model and artificial neural network (ANN). The pad capacitances and <b>series</b> <b>resistors</b> are directly obtained from EM (electromagnetic) simulation of the S parameters with different size of pad and operating frequency. The parasitic elements in the test structure can be modeled by using a sub artificial neural network (SANN). So the pad capacitances and <b>series</b> <b>resistors</b> can be regarded as functions of the dimensions of the pad structure and operating frequencies by using SANN. Good agreement between the ANN-based modeling and EM simulation results has been demonstrated. In order to remove the impact of the parasitic elements, the de-embedding procedure for MOSFET device using ANN-based pad model is also demonstrated...|$|R

[...] This is beneficial to the amplifier performance. [...] The impedance of a loudspeaker is partly resistive.

[...] However, the speaker also possesses inductance due to the windings of its coil. [...] The impedance of the loudspeaker is thus typically modelled as a <b>series</b> <b>resistor</b> and inductor. [...] A parallel circuit of a <b>series</b> <b>resistor</b> and capacitor of the correct values will form a Zobel bridge.

40|$|In this paper, {{a number}} of {{simulated}} floating inductors (FIs) employing second-generation current conveyor (CCII), current-feedback operational amplifier (CFOA), differential voltage current conveyor (DVCC) and differential difference current conveyor (DDCC) are proposed. They employ only a grounded capacitor; accordingly, they are suitable for integrated circuit (IC) implementation. Some of the developed FI simulators demonstrate the feature of improved low-frequency performance while the other ones suffer from the Z/Y terminal parasitic <b>resistors</b> bringing extra <b>series</b> <b>resistors</b> to the inductances of the simulated FIs. Two novel methods for reducing/eliminating the unwanted series resistance in equivalent inductances of the FIs are developed, {{one of which is}} called the direct design technique accomplished by adjusting the resistive component/components of the FIs. The <b>series</b> <b>resistors</b> of the FIs affecting their low-frequency performance can be canceled by adding floating negative <b>resistors</b> in <b>series,</b> which is another method.

50|$|At higher frequencies, usually above 500 MHz, traces get {{electrically}} {{longer and}} higher above the plane. Two techniques are used at these frequencies: wave shaping with <b>series</b> <b>resistors</b> and embedding the traces {{between the two}} planes. If all these measures still leave too much EMI, shielding such as RF gaskets and copper tape can be used. Most digital equipment is designed with metal or conductive-coated plastic cases.|$|R

Maximum voltage is in the low tens of kV. (Observing a high voltage ramp can create a staircase waveform with steps at different points every repetition, until the probe tip is in contact. Until then, a tiny arc charges the probe tip, and its capacitance holds the voltage (open circuit). As the voltage continues to climb, another tiny arc charges the tip further.) ...|$|E

50|$|Most small neon (indicator-sized) lamps, such as {{the common}} NE-2, have a {{break-down}} voltage of around 90 volts.

50|$|Zener zap is {{frequently}} employed in mixed-signal circuits for trimming values of analog components.

It is therefore necessary to shift the manufacturing tolerances so that the lowest-value typically made is equal to or larger than the desired value. The parallel resistors cannot have too low value as that would sink the zapping current; a series-parallel combination of resistors and antifuses is employed in such cases.|$|R

40|$|In a {{high-speed}} {{signal transmission system}} that uses transformer coupling, {{there is a need}} to provide increased transmitted signal strength without adding active components. This invention uses additional transformers to achieve the needed gain. The prior art uses stronger drivers (which require an IC redesign and a higher power supply voltage), or the addition of another active component (which can decrease reliability, increase power consumption, reduce the beneficial effect of serializer/deserializer preemphasis or deemphasis, and/or interfere with fault containment mechanisms), or uses a different transformer winding ratio (which requires redesign of the transformer and may not be feasible with high-speed signals that require a 1 : 1 winding ratio). This invention achieves the required gain by connecting the secondaries of multiple transformers in series. The primaries of these transformers are currently either connected in parallel or are connected to multiple drivers. There is also a need to split a receive signal to multiple destinations with minimal signal loss. Additional transformers can achieve the split. The prior art uses impedance-matching <b>series</b> <b>resistors</b> that cause a loss of signal. Instead of causing a loss, most instantiations of this invention would actually provide gain. Multiple transformers are used instead of multiple windings on a single transformer because multiple windings on the same transformer would require a redesign of the transformer, and may not be feasible with high-speed transformers that usually require a bifilar winding with a 1 : 1 ratio. This invention creates the split by connecting the primaries of multiple transformers in series.
