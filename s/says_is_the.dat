25|$|The {{formaldehyde}} {{surrounding the}} shark, Hirst <b>says,</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> process {{of death and}} decay. Though formaldehyde {{is used as a}} preservation means, over time, the object being preserved will soon wilt, flake, and wrinkle. Because the sculpture itself was made in 1991, the shark is very much rotting and deformed due to the formaldehyde taking its toll on the corpse. With the corpse rotting away, it symbolizes that no matter how well we take care of ourselves or how timeless we think we are, our mind will start to fade away and we slowly will begin to forget.|$|E
25|$|The {{foundation}} of Swedenborg's theology was {{laid down in}} Arcana Cœlestia (Heavenly Mysteries), published in eight Latin volumes from 1749 to 1756. In {{a significant portion of}} that work, he interprets the Biblical passages of Genesis and Exodus. He reviews what he <b>says</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> inner spiritual sense of these two works of the Word of God. (He later made a similar review of the inner sense of the book of Revelation in Apocalypse Revealed.) Most of all, he was convinced that the Bible describes a human's transformation from a materialistic to a spiritual being, which he calls rebirth or regeneration. He begins this work by outlining how the creation myth was not an account of the creation of Earth, but an account of man's rebirth or regeneration in six steps represented by the six days of creation. Everything related to mankind in the Bible could also be related to Jesus Christ, and how Christ freed himself from materialistic boundaries through the glorification of his human presence by making it Divine. Swedenborg examines this idea in his exposition of Genesis and Exodus.|$|E

500|$|One {{explanation}} for this continuing popularity is that the Hardy Boys are simple wish fulfillment. Their adventures allow readers to vicariously experience {{an escape from the}} mundane. At the same time, Frank and Joe live ordinary lives when not solving mysteries, allowing readers to identify with characters who seem realistic and whose parents and authority figures are unfailingly supportive and loving. The Hardy Boys also embody an ideal of masculinity: by their very name they [...] "set the stage for a gentrified version of hardiness and constructed hardiness as an ideal for modern American males", part of the [...] "cultural production of self-control and mastery as the revered ideal for the American man." [...] More controversially, to Meredith Wood, the characters embody not just an ideal of masculinity, but an ideal of white masculinity. She tries to argue that [...] "racist stereotypes are ... fundamental {{to the success of the}} Hardy Boys series." [...] In support of this claim, Wood cites what she <b>says</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> replacement of one stereotype (evil Chinese) with another (evil Latin Americans) in the original and revised versions of Footprints Under the Window. She further claims that this is the reason for the popularity of the Applewood Books reprints of the original, unrevised texts rather that the widely cited blandness of the rewrites.|$|E
500|$|Of greater concern, Gunson <b>says,</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> [...] "deliberate {{blurring}} {{of responsibility for}} the coup". The film presents the idea that the military commanders dispersed, [...] "leaving a total power vacuum". However, the high command's senior figure, General Lucas Rincón (who announced Chávez's resignation on television), {{was not part of the}} coup and remained in the government after April 2002. The petition draws the conclusion, [...] "(1) either General Rincón stated a truth that was accepted throughout the whole country... or (2) General Rincón lied, because he was an accomplice... that seems not to be the truth because he [...]" [...] Only one of the high command joined Carmona's interim administration before contributing to its downfall by withdrawing his support. The military leaders shown withdrawing their support for Chávez were not the high command, and Vice-Admiral Hector Ramirez Perez was not the head of the navy, as the film claims. Gunson says, [...] "With one solitary exception, these generals and admirals had not 'fled abroad' after the Carmona government collapsed." [...] Although Bartley and ÓBriain accept that Rincón said Chávez [...] "had agreed to resign", they reiterate that [...] "elements in the military [...] force in the effort to make Chávez resign"; the filmmakers say it is [...] "irrelevant" [...] that the whole military did not join the coup, as this [...] "is the case with most coups". General Rincón's announcement was omitted because they felt it was [...] "supplementary to the main, key fact of the story", that no documentary evidence of the resignation exists.|$|E
500|$|Emanuel Levy wrote Ledger [...] "throws himself completely" [...] {{into the}} role, {{and that the}} film {{represents}} Nolan's [...] "most accomplished and mature" [...] work, and the most technically impressive and resonant of all the Batman films. Levy calls the action sequences {{some of the most}} impressive seen in an American film for years, and talks of the Hong Kong-set portion of the film as being particularly visually impressive. Levy and Peter Travers conclude that the film is [...] "haunting and visionary," [...] while Levy {{goes on to say that}} The Dark Knight is [...] "nothing short of brilliant." [...] On the other hand, David Denby of The New Yorker said that the story is not coherent enough to properly flesh out the disparities. He said the film's mood is one of [...] "constant climax," [...] and that it feels rushed and far too long. Denby criticized scenes which he argued to be meaningless or are cut short just as they become interesting. Denby remarks that the central conflict is workable, but that [...] "only half the team can act it," [...] saying that Bale's [...] "placid" [...] Bruce Wayne and [...] "dogged but uninteresting" [...] Batman is constantly upstaged by Ledger's [...] "sinister and frightening" [...] performance, which he <b>says</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> film's one element of success. Denby concludes that Ledger is [...] "mesmerising" [...] in every scene. The vocalization of Christian Bale's Batman (which was partly altered during post-production) was the subject of particular criticism by some commentators, with David Edelstein from NPR describing Bale delivering his performance with [...] "a voice that's deeper and hammier than ever". Alonso Duralde at MSNBC, however, referred to Bale's voice in The Dark Knight as an [...] "eerie rasp", as opposed to the voice used in the Batman Begins, which according to Duralde [...] "sounded absurdly deep, like a 10-year-old putting on an ‘adult’ voice to make prank phone calls".|$|E

Doughty instead advocates spending time with the body, not just hours, but around two days, in order to fully accept the death.

2500|$|During the Mindanao Hariraya Eid al-Fitr 2016 {{convention}} in Davao City on July 8, 2016, Duterte vowed {{to address the}} Moro conflict and bring peace in Mindanao, assuring the Filipino Muslim community that [...] "something will change" [...] {{before the end of}} his term. He said that the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) and the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) both support his proposal for federalism in the Philippines, which he <b>says</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> only solution to the Bangsamoro peace process. Duterte said that if the proposal for the country's shift to federalism fails or is not desired by the Filipino people, he will vow to pass the Bangsamoro Basic Law, which would establish the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region. He also added that the Basic Law should benefit both MILF and MNLF, saying he is willing to negotiate with both secessionists to initiate a [...] "reconfiguration" [...] of territory.|$|E
2500|$|Mattey elaborates further [...] on the positive, redeeming {{aspect of}} the {{seemingly}} bleak, frustrating themes of existentialism that are so apparent in Nausea: [...] "Sartre considered the subjectivity of the starting-point for what a human is as a key thesis of existentialism. The starting-point is subjective because humans make themselves what they are. Most philosophers consider subjectivity {{to be a bad}} thing, {{particularly when it comes to}} the motivation for action... Sartre responds by claiming that subjectivity is a dignity of human being, not something that degrades us." [...] Therefore, the characteristic anguish and forlornness of existentialism are temporary: only a prerequisite to recognizing individual responsibility and freedom. The basis of ethics is not rule-following. A specific action may be either wrong or right and no specific rule is necessarily valid. What makes the action, either way, ethical is [...] "authenticity," [...] the willingness of the individual to accept responsibility rather than dependence on rules, and to commit to his action. Despair, the existentialist <b>says,</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> product of uncertainty: being oriented exclusively to the outcome of a decision rather than to the process yields uncertainty, as we cannot decide the future, only our action.|$|E

2500|$|Over {{the course}} of his 31 years as a sports agent, Boras has {{represented}} hundreds of players on all 30 major league teams and has participated in dozens of high-profile negotiations. Boras's specialty is the record-breaking contract, which he <b>says</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> most difficult to achieve because it then provides an [...] "umbrella" [...] from which other players can benefit. Boras is well known for identifying sources of leverage for his clients and using them for the clients' advantage. This has included advising draft picks to return to school instead of signing, taking advantage of the right to go to salary arbitration hearings, and advising superstars to wait for free agency instead of taking [...] "hometown discount" [...] contracts. This does not endear him to fans, who regularly side with their favorite teams and not individual players. Boras, however, has said his job is to represent his clients' interests, even if it means weathering public criticism. Boras is also known for his innovative strategies in the draft, salary arbitration and free agency, which have benefited his clients enough that Major League Baseball has changed its rules in response to Boras on multiple occasions. This has led to descriptions of Boras ranging from [...] "baseball's most hated man" [...] (from management's perspective) to the man [...] "players can't afford to live without." ...|$|E
