40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{behaviour}} of iron in {{the natural}} weathering of hornblende in a <b>sedentary</b> <b>soil</b> profile has been investigated using the M 6 ssbauer effect. The spectra from samples {{at different stages of}} weathering show appreciable differences which can be accounted for if ferrous iron is lost preferentially from M(3) sites where it is co-ordinated to hydroxyl groups in a trans arrangement. Unlike biotite the proportion of ferric iron does not increase during weathering and this illustrates the difficulty with which the ferrous iron is oxidized in the amphibole structure...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY. The {{behaviour}} of iron in the weathering ofbiotite in a <b>sedentary</b> <b>soil</b> profile {{developed on}} appinite {{has been investigated}} using the M 6 ssbauer ffect. Both Fe z+ and Fe a+ in sites with cis and trans hydroxyl groups were observed atvarious tages in the weathering sequence. The results indicate {{that there is little}} or no ordering of the octahedral cations in the fresh biotite and hydrobiotite, but in the more weathered interstratifled vermiculite-chlorite samples Fe a+ concentrates in the more distorted sites. No evidence was obtained for the presence ofan anisotropic recoil-free fraction. IN the laboratory, biotite can be readily converted to vermiculite by a simple cation-exchange process involving replacement of interlayer K + by a more highly hydrated cation such as Mg 2 + or Ca ~+. However, under natural conditions the weathering of biotite is more complex since weathered biotites, vermiculitized to varying degrees, are invariably more highly oxidized than fresh flakes separated from related parent rock. The octahedral sheet is therefore affected. Because of the importance of the degree of oxidation of biotites for potassium retention in the soil (Barshad and Kishk, I 968; Robert and Pedro, I 968), the weathering reactions of the mineral have been investigated in detail...|$|E
40|$|Qasim, some 500 km north-west of Riyadh, {{is one of}} the agriculturally {{important}} areas of Saudi Arabia. Silt fractions of the soils of the Wadi ar Rimah and side wadis, classified as Torrifluvents, are characterised by high quartz contents and the universal occurrence of kaolinite and feldspar, generally with plagioclase predominant; mica, chlorite and hornblende also generally occur. The clay fractions contain mainly palygorskite and a smectite-mica interstratification with smaller amounts of kaolinite, traces of quartz and occasionally chlorite. Palygorskite with depth. Variations in mineralogy probably reflect changes in depositional conditions rather than pedogenic processes; possible reasons for the high palygorskite content are discussed. <b>Sedentary</b> <b>soils</b> (Torriorthents) reflect the mineralogy of the rock from which they were derived. In clay fractions from salt-marsh soils (Salorthids) calcite reacts strongly with smectite-mica during DTA...|$|R
40|$|Concentration {{together}} with the stable isotope composition (δ 15 N) of both ammonium- and nitrate-nitrogen were conducted for <b>sedentary</b> <b>soils</b> under the piscivorous seabird colony developed on Quaternary basaltic ejecta from the Hatana islands, Fiji, south Pacific. Higher inorganic nitrogen content (up to 2, 420 mg-N/kg dry soil) was observed for soils under dense forest vegetation, relative to a lower nitrogen content for soils under sparse grass vegetation (270 mg-N/kg dry soil), reflecting {{the difference in the}} mulching effects of vegetative cover for leaching of nitrogen by meteoric water. Active mineralization of uric acid in the bird excreta followed by partial loss due to volatilization of ammonia, nitrification and denitrification were indicated by unique δ 15 N values of the inorganic nitrogen as high as + 50 ‰. This unique process was facilitated by high soil surface temperature (24 to 32 °C) in combination with the humid tropical climate (annual rainfall: 3560 mm). Distinct isotopic composition of the foliar nitrogen (δ 15 N = + 13. 6 to + 36. 7 ‰) indicated acquisition of the inorganic nitrogen derived from bird excreta in soils...|$|R
40|$|Soil is an {{important}} natural resource which when effectively managed, could increase the livelihoods of households in <b>sedentary</b> agricultural communities. <b>Soil</b> erosion is however an emerging challenge {{as a cause of}} environmental degradation and this paper sought to ascertain the nature of soil erosion on maize farms, the effects of soil erosion on maize crop farmers and the effectiveness of local control measures on output levels and the livelihoods of the farmers. A cross-section of the community was taken and participants were selected non-probabilistically by snow-balling for questionnaire administration and focus group discussions. The study revealed that the local farmers perceived soil erosion as the wearing away of the top soil and nutrients, under the influence of running water during rainy periods and the slope of the land. The major effects of soil erosion were found to be the loss of fertile soils, reduction in the cultivable land area, the reduction in the crop yield and a fall in the living standards of farmers’ households. The findings also indicated that some of the adaptive strategies to reduce the effects of soil erosion include shifting cultivation, ridging across slopes, planting on raised mounds and avoidance of deep ploughing. It was further revealed that farmers who successfully applied the traditional methods improved upon their output levels per land area and the standards of living of their families It was recommended that modern agricultural extension services were needed, not to replace, but to complement the local knowledge systems in order to ensure sustainability...|$|R
