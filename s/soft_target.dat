5|$|Wells was {{appointed}} Commander-in-Chief, British Commonwealth Forces Korea, in 1953. Assuming the role on 11 February, {{he led the}} Commonwealth contingent for the next twenty-one months as the Korean War {{was coming to an}} end. Like his predecessors in the position, Wells exercised administrative command only, and had no direct control over battlefield operations. Though its incumbents were considered to have performed well, the role garnered little credit for helping facilitate combat success but was a <b>soft</b> <b>target</b> for criticism when operations did not run smoothly. Wells had been sent to Korea with no instructions regarding the withdrawal of troops and—as armistice talks appeared on the verge of success—he was closely involved in liaison with the heads of Commonwealth governments regarding General Mark Clark's requests for their commitment to retain forces in the theatre for some period following the end of hostilities.|$|E
5|$|Whimpress tabled various {{hypotheses}} for Crockett's actions. At the time, Crockett was 37 {{years old}} {{and was ready to}} emerge from the shadow of Phillips, the eminent Australian umpire of the time. When Crockett called Marsh, it was his 29th match as a first-class umpire and the no-balling was seen in some quarters as a signal that he felt ready to officiate in Test matches. A cynical view of Crockett's calls held that if throwing was to be eradicated then the umpire was going to choose a <b>soft</b> <b>target.</b> This theory ruled out the calling of a fellow Victorian, his state of origin. The same line of reasoning concluded that a New South Welshman would be called, and likely not a high-profile Test player like Noble or Jack Saunders. Those who adhered to this hypothesis believed that it would be easier for Crockett to target someone who had a previous stigma of throwing and that Marsh—an aborigine who led the bowling averages with 21 wickets at 17.38—was an ideal target.|$|E
5|$|Born {{into the}} Bundjalung people at Yulgilbar on the Clarence River in {{northern}} New South Wales, Marsh first {{made an impression}} as a professional runner, travelling to Sydney and then competing interstate, winning races as a sprinter and a hurdler. While in Sydney, Marsh began competing in the local club cricket competition and his action quickly came under scrutiny. He was first no-balled for throwing in 1897, {{but it was not}} until 1900 that he came to prominence in a trial match against the New South Wales state team. Marsh dismissed leading Test cricketers Victor Trumper and Monty Noble, but was called for throwing. Marsh vowed to prove the legitimacy of his action by bowling with his arm encased in splints, which prompted the umpire to resign in humiliation. Having topped the bowling averages in the local competition, Marsh was selected to make his debut in the Sheffield Shield. He made an immediate impression and led the first-class bowling averages for the season after three matches. He was no-balled in his second match by Bob Crockett, but things came to a head in his fourth match when the same umpire no-balled him seventeen times, leading to angry crowd demonstrations. The cricket community was divided on whether Marsh's action was fair and various theories were propounded, which sought to show a motive for foul play against Marsh. The most popular of these theories was that Marsh was scapegoated in a campaign against throwing and was a <b>soft</b> <b>target</b> because of his race.|$|E
50|$|Terrorist groups almost {{exclusively}} choose to strike <b>soft</b> <b>targets.</b> Of terrorist attacks worldwide from 1968 to 2005, 72% (8,111) struck <b>soft</b> <b>targets</b> and 27% (4,248) struck hard targets. The intent {{of attacks on}} <b>soft</b> <b>targets</b> is to instil fear as well as inflict casualties. Clark Kent Ervin notes that attacks on <b>soft</b> <b>targets</b> inflict psychological damage. In 2011, while preparations were being made for the 2012 Summer Olympics, the deputy commissioner of London's Metropolitan Police Service noted that if the primary targets were secure, terrorists might substitute targets that are nearby but not as well protected.|$|R

500|$|Crockett's calls {{provoked}} a varied {{response from the}} media, which often ran counter to their state allegiances. The New South Wales journalist Davis felt that Marsh's deliberate throws raised [...] "uncertainty", while the Australasian's cricket writer Tom Horan—a Victorian who went by the pen name Felix—felt that Marsh was a <b>soft</b> <b>target</b> for Crockett, whom he regarded as a suspicious character. Curran's previous calling of Marsh in the Sydney competition had strengthened Crockett's position away from his parochial state base. The Victorian umpire {{was regarded as a}} tough-minded umpire, much like Jim Phillips, who had triggered the current round of throwing calls in Australian cricket. Crockett was commended for his willingness to call Marsh in the face of public anger and for doing what others would not. When Marsh bowled from the other end in the second innings of the match, his action was deemed by Crockett's umpiring partner Sammy Jones to be fair. By this time, Marsh's confidence was low. He took his worst ever first-class figures of 1/105 as New South Wales lost by one wicket. His only wicket was Test player Charlie McLeod, bowled for six.|$|E
500|$|Chess {{historian}} Edward Winter {{observes that}} [...] "Gossip {{has always been}} a <b>soft</b> <b>target</b> for mockery". He notes that Hooper and Whyld in the first edition (1984) of The Oxford Companion to Chess [...] "treated him essentially as light relief"; the second edition (1992) treated him more equitably, but like the first omitted any mention of his performance at New York 1889. Yakov Damsky in The Batsford Book of Chess Records (2005), addressing the question of which player [...] "achieved the greatest negative distinction" [...] on the international level, opines that Gossip [...] "can probably feel safe from competition". Mike Fox and Richard James in their book The Even More Complete Chess Addict (1993) write that, [...] "Of players who've entered chess history, perhaps the strongest claimant for the all-time grandpatzer title is George Hatfeild Dingley Gossip (1841–1907). George had a worse record in major tournaments than anyone in history (last at Breslau 1889, London 1889, Manchester 1890, London 1892, and New York 1893: a total of just four wins, 52 losses and 21 draws)." [...] Like Hooper and Whyld, they overlook his result at New York 1889, a major tournament where he won 11 games and finished above the bottom. In a 2001 article, Whyld himself takes notice of Gossip's result at New York 1889 and suggests that [...] "history has perhaps given him an unfair verdict".|$|E
2500|$|In The Winning Way former Australian coach Bob Dwyer writes that, [...] "They exposed our vulnerability, mentally, to {{the kind}} of bully-boy tactics they employed... there was a mental {{attitude}} prevailing in the Australian team in the late 1980s which made Australia a <b>soft</b> <b>target</b> for any team which sets out to unsettle it with foul play." ...|$|E

2500|$|In his after action report Lieutenant Colonel Colin Townsend—Commanding Officer 6 RAR—wrote that he {{believed}} D Company had disrupted a regimental attack on the 1 ATF base. Yet years later he stated that he doubted the Viet Cong ever intended attacking Nui Dat. He felt they would have gained more from attacking a <b>soft</b> <b>target</b> such as Ba Ria and that the defences at Nui Dat would have been sufficient to withstand a regimental assault, having been improved significantly in the 11 weeks since its occupation and protected by patrols and overwhelming artillery support, {{even if they were}} still to be fully developed. However, there were suspicions a battalion from the 274th Regiment was moving towards Nui Dat from the west {{at the same time the}} 275th Regiment approached from the east, and if true such an attack may have been feasible, even if it still would not have achieved the nine to one superiority communist doctrine required. The southern side of the base was only lightly defended and an assault from that direction would have allowed the Viet Cong to attack the gunline first, and if they succeeded in breaking-in would have then crossed [...] of open ground before reaching Headquarters 1 ATF. On the other hand, Major Noel Ford—Officer Commanding B Company, 6 RAR—believed the mortar attack served to lure an Australian reaction force into an ambush, arguing the Viet Cong would have been unlikely to telegraph their intentions to attack Nui Dat and that they had left a clear trail for any force dispatched to find the mortar base plate and RCL positions. Townsend disagreed, arguing the mortar crews and RCL teams had actually tried to hamper the follow up by breaking into small groups, indicating that no such trap had been planned. Meanwhile, Major Harry Honnor—Officer Commanding the 161st Battery, Royal New Zealand Artillery attached to 6 RAR in direct support—believed the bombardment had been used by the Viet Cong to register targets and that D Company had stumbled across the force as it was preparing to launch an assault on Nui Dat two days later, with the battle that ensued preventing this from occurring.|$|E
30|$|The rest of {{this paper}} is {{organized}} as follows. In the next section, we describe the basic algorithm for training with <b>soft</b> <b>targets.</b> LVCSR acoustic modeling experiments for full-sized DNN with SA and speaker-independent (SI) features are studied in Section 3, followed by experiments where the network size is reduced in Section 4. We demonstrate the suitability of the approach in the context of VAD with <b>soft</b> <b>targets</b> from a CNN in Section 5. Following that, we discuss why training with <b>soft</b> <b>targets</b> from a highly accurate NN can be more effective than with hard aligned targets. The paper finishes with conclusions and future work in Section 7.|$|R

We have argued that important information is transferred in the <b>soft</b> <b>targets</b> which improves generalization of the student network, resulting in the lower WERs and EERs observed in Sections 3, 4, and 5.

30|$|It is {{interesting}} to note that the speech recognition community actually began work on training NNs with soft posterior probabilities instead of hard targets generated from forced alignment a long time ago [17 – 20]. While this paper, along with other recent ones, focuses on using <b>soft</b> <b>targets</b> from a more accurate “teacher” network to train an easier-to-deploy DNN, these older works were concerned with improving recognition accuracy of a single NN used during both training and deployment by generating training targets which more smoothly represented the transitions between HMM states. Training was an iterative process alternating between rounds of updating NN parameters using backpropagation and reestimating the <b>soft</b> <b>targets</b> used for training by performing a soft alignment of the data and reference transcription using the forward-backward algorithm given the current NN. Like several more recent approaches, a cross-entropy-based criterion was optimized when training the network with the <b>soft</b> <b>targets</b> generated by the forward-backward algorithm, though [20] optimized a mean squared error-based criterion instead.|$|R
