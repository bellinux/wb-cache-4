San Diego had to compete with Fresno, Los Angeles, and several other cities for a school, and its first attempt to establish one in 1895 was vetoed by California governor James Budd. On March 13, 1897 Governor Budd changed course and signed legislation appropriating $50,000 {{to allow for the}} establishment of a state normal school in San Diego, to be located in University Heights.

The American Civil War was soon to demonstrate that traditional brick and masonry forts could be reduced to rubble by rifled guns. The government's response was to appoint a Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom, which published a far-reaching report in 1860. The Royal Commission recommended that a triangle of forts <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>established</b> on the lower Thames, east of Gravesend. This would involve replacing the existing Coalhouse Fort on the Essex shore with a new fortification, similarly replacing the existing Shornemead Fort and building the wholly new Cliffe Fort opposite Coalhouse Point, which would replace the abandoned 18th century battery at Lower Hope Point. The location of the forts would enable interlocking arcs of fire from their guns.
