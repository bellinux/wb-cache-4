25|$|In 2013, Boise {{celebrated its}} sesquicentennial, the {{commemoration}} was {{also known as}} the Boise 150. The commemoration was led by the City of Boise's Department of Arts & History. The Department of Arts & History focused the commemoration on the themes of Enterprise, Community, and Environment. For the sesquicentennial year, the Department of Arts and History inhabited a storefront at 1008 Main St. This Boise 150 headquarters, {{also known as the}} Sesqui-Shop operated as a store, exhibit space, and event venue. Local merchants produced authentic local products as part of the sesquicentennial.

500|$|Górecki now had two texts: {{one from}} a mother to her son, the other from a {{daughter}} to her mother. While looking for a third that would continue the theme, he decided on a mid-15th-century folk song from {{the southern city of}} Opole. Its text contains a passage in which the Virgin Mary speaks to her Son dying on the cross: [...] "O my son, beloved and chosen, <b>Share</b> <b>your</b> wounds with your mother..." [...] (Synku miły i wybrany, rozdziel z matką swoje rany...). Górecki said, [...] "this text was folk-like, anonymous. So now I had three acts, three persons... Originally, I wanted to frame these texts with an introduction and a conclusion. I even chose two verses (5 and 6) from Psalm 93/94 in the translation by Wujek: 'They humiliated Your people, O Lord, and afflicted Your heritage, they killed the widow and the passer-by, murdered the orphans. However, he rejected this format because he believed the structure would position the work as a symphony [...] "about war". Górecki sought to transcend such specifics, and instead structured the work as three independent laments.|$|E

500|$|When the {{production}} company {{first arrived in}} Los Angeles, {{the cast and crew}} were [...] "intimidated" [...] by Scientologists. Scientology officials had previously visited the New York City production in the midst of rehearsals and handed out [...] "documentation of court cases where the Church of Scientology had successfully prosecuted those seeking to disparage the Church's methods." [...] Director/creator Alex Timbers characterized these events as [...] "terrifically wonderful and intimidating". Editors from the Los Angeles Times received phone calls from Scientologists urging them not to write about the play. [...] In addition, the parents of one of the children from the cast received phone calls from members of the entertainment industry who were Scientologists. The parents of these cast members were told that if their children performed in the play, [...] "it might be bad for their future career." [...] The parents politely informed these callers [...] "We read the script, and we don't think it is mean-spirited ... We understand your concerns, but we don't <b>share</b> <b>your</b> concerns." [...] When asked by Variety magazine for the Church's official take on the play, a Los Angeles Church of Scientology spokeswoman was quoted as saying: [...] "This is not litigation material. This is nothing." [...] In a 2007 interview, Jarrow commented on the Church of Scientology's history of responses to productions of the play: [...] "It's clear the Church doesn't like the show—but in my opinion that kind of controversy is evidence that the show's hitting a nerve and dealing with pertinent issues. So I take a certain pride in that." ...|$|E
500|$|Another Green World was {{released}} in September 1975 and did not chart in either the United Kingdom or the United States. The album's reception was {{for the most part}} very favourable. Henry Edwards of High Fidelity wrote positively of the album, claiming it to be Eno's [...] "most accessible to date". Tom Hull of The Village Voice felt that, although it [...] "wouldn't {{be fair to say that}} Another Green World is Eno's best album," [...] the album is definitely [...] "his easiest to love." [...] Charley Walters of Rolling Stone found it a [...] "major triumph" [...] that Eno's creative risks [...] "so consistently pan out", and said that it is [...] "indeed an important record—and also a brilliant one". Negative reviews of the album focused on the lack of the rock songs from Eno's previous albums. Jon Pareles, writing in Crawdaddy!, found its electronic excursions less challenging than Eno's previous progressive rock songs and remarked, [...] "This ain't no Eno record. I don't care what the credits say. It doesn't even get on my nerves." [...] Lester Bangs of The Village Voice was lulled by much of the music and said that [...] "those little pools of sound on the outskirts of silence seemed to me the logical consequence of letting the processes and technology <b>share</b> <b>your</b> conceptual burden". Robert Christgau, who originally gave the album an [...] "A–" [...] in his review for The Village Voice, admitted that he resisted the album at first, but ultimately grew to [...] "love every minute of this arty little collection of static (i.e., non-swinging) synthesizer pieces (with vocals, percussion, and guitar)." [...] He felt that its 13 pieces can be appreciated both individually and as a whole, and called the album [...] "the aural equivalent of a park on the moon — oneness with nature under conditions of artificial gravity." [...] In 1977, Another Green World was voted the 11th best album of 1976 in the Village Voices Pazz & Jop critics' poll. Christgau, the poll's creator, ranked it second on his own list for the poll.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, Richie {{had begun to}} accept songwriting {{commissions}} from other artists. He composed [...] "Lady" [...] for Kenny Rogers, which hit No. 1 in 1980, and produced Rogers's album <b>Share</b> <b>Your</b> Love the following year. Richie and Rogers maintained a strong friendship in later years. Latin jazz composer and salsa romantica pioneer La Palabra enjoyed international success with his cover of [...] "Lady," [...] which was played at Latin dance clubs. Also in 1981 Richie sang the theme song for the film Endless Love, a duet with Diana Ross. Issued as a single, the song topped the Canada, Brazil, Australia, Japan, New Zealand and US pop music charts, {{and became one of}} Motown's biggest hits. Its success encouraged Richie to branch out into a full-fledged solo career in 1982. He was replaced as lead singer for the Commodores by Skyler Jett in 1983.|$|E
2500|$|In old age, Laplace {{remained}} {{curious about}} the question of God and frequently discussed Christianity with the Swiss astronomer Jean-Frédéric-Théodore Maurice. He told Maurice that [...] "Christianity is quite a beautiful thing" [...] and praised its civilising influence. Maurice thought that the basis of Laplace's beliefs was, little by little, being modified, but that he held fast to his conviction that the invariability of the laws of nature did not permit of supernatural events. After Laplace's death, Poisson told Maurice, [...] "You know that I do not <b>share</b> <b>your</b> [...] opinions, but my conscience forces me to recount something that will surely please you." [...] When Poisson had complimented Laplace about his [...] "brilliant discoveries", the dying man had fixed him with a pensive look and replied, [...] "Ah! we chase after phantoms [...]" [...] These were his last words, interpreted by Maurice as a realisation of the ultimate [...] "vanity" [...] of earthly pursuits. Laplace received the last rites from the curé of the Missions Étrangères (in whose parish he was to be buried) and the curé of Arcueil.|$|E

2500|$|In a December 2013 article, Pravit {{reminded}} middle-class Bangkok {{opponents of}} the Yingluck Shinawatra regime [...] "that {{that you are not}} the majority of the people, and that Bangkok is just one part of Thailand.... I know that you middle class and well-heeled Bangkokians are used to snapping your fingers and having your maids, drivers, waitresses and even sex workers jump to satisfy you. It must be such a pain to see these people turning the tables and dictating the course of Thai politics.... Some of you say these 'red-shirt buffaloes' are too stupid to be allowed to vote—a privilege that should only go to college-educated Thais or the middle class". He compared this attitude to the apartheid system. [...] "The poor and less-educated Thais in rural areas and in Bangkok want their political opinions counted as well. A lorry with 10 wheels cannot move forward with just one wheel dictating the speed. And so it is with Thailand". He called on his fellow Bangkokians to [...] "try harder to convince them through civil dialogue, rather than engaging in bouts of expletive-loaded hate speech and showing open indifference to loss of life of among protesters who don't <b>share</b> <b>your</b> political opinions. We need to give a space for our fragile and young democracy to grow and mature. And that means employing legitimate democratic means in opposing Thaksin and Yingluck—no military coup and no mob rule, please".|$|E
2500|$|In 1980, a {{selection}} he recorded as {{a duet with}} Kim Carnes, [...] "Don't Fall In Love With A Dreamer," [...] became a major hit. Earlier that year, he sang a duet of [...] "You and Me" [...] with Lynda Carter in her television music special Lynda Carter Special (Rogers originally recorded this with Dottie West for the Every Time Two Fools Collide album). [...] Later in 1980 came his partnership with Lionel Richie who wrote and produced Rogers' No.1 hit [...] "Lady." [...] Richie went on to produce Rogers's 1981 album <b>Share</b> <b>Your</b> Love, a chart topper and commercial favorite featuring hits such as [...] "I Don't Need You" [...] (Pop No.3), [...] "Through the Years" [...] (Pop No.13), and [...] "Share Your Love with Me" [...] (Pop No.14). His first Christmas album was also released that same year. In 1982, Rogers released the album Love Will Turn You Around. The album's single {{of the same name}} reached No.13 on the Billboard Hit 100 and topped the country and AC charts. It was the theme song of Rogers' 1982 film Six Pack. Shortly afterwards, he started working with producer David Foster in 1983 recording the smash Top 10 hit Bob Seger cover [...] "We've Got Tonight," [...] a duet with Sheena Easton. Also a #1 single on the Country charts in the United States, it reached the Top 30 on the British charts.|$|E
2500|$|The {{impact of}} the coordinated action was {{generally}} considered to be significant. Yochai Benkler of the Berkman Center for Internet & Society stated that the January 18 blackout was [...] "a very strong public demonstration to suggest that what historically was seen as a technical system of rules that only influences the content industry has become something more," [...] further adding [...] "You've got millions of citizens who care enough to act. That's not trivial." [...] California House member Darrell Issa called the collective effort an unprecedented means for upsetting a backroom lobbying effort, and the immediate political efficacy of the widespread online protest was characterised in terms of a sleeping giant having awakened and of a new player being in town. [...] One Silicon Valley lobbyist said the content industry had [...] "a lot to learn," [...] noting that they don't have grassroots support: [...] "There are no Facebook pages to call your congressman to support PIPA and SOPA." [...] The New York Times, which framed the netizens' revolt in terms of the new economy versus the old economy, headlined the activism as a [...] "political coming of age for the tech industry." [...] (James Grimmelmann, an Associate Professor at New York Law School, opined two months later that [...] "Legal systems are like Soylent Green: they're made out of people. [...] If you want to protect civil liberties using law, you need to get people on your side who <b>share</b> <b>your</b> vision of what law stands for. [...] That's why the SOPA protests were so effective. They converted an argument about justice into real-world political power.") ...|$|E
