25|$|The game {{features}} assault rifles, sub-machine guns, pistols, missile launchers, shotguns, miniguns, sniper rifles, gauss rifles (or coilgun), the MOAC (a machine-gun-like alien weapon which fires high-velocity ice shards), and the TAC gun (a hand-held nuclear grenade launcher). Most weapons can {{be modified}} with attachments; these attachments may {{be given to the}} player by default, acquired from picked-up weapons, or purchased in multiplayer. Attachment options are given a fair amount of leeway even if the end result may <b>seem</b> <b>strange.</b> For instance, a 4x/10x sniper scope can be attached to the buckshot-firing shotgun, though obviously there is no practical use for such a combination. Additionally, most weapons have multiple firing modes (single/automatic fire) and different ammo types; for example, the KPA's FY-71 can fire both conventional bullets as well as incendiary bullets, which increase damage. Crysis also incorporates some features that have appeared in other recent shooters such as accounting for already-chambered rounds when a reload occurs.|$|E

[...] The economic impact of the museum's closure was not expected to be large according to John Cookson, co-chairman of Economic and Industrial Development Commission. Janet Serra, the director for the Western Connecticut Convention and Visitor's Bureau, said the effect of closure would not be immediate, but noted it could impact tourism and area hotels.|$|E
500|$|Greaney {{needed a}} setpiece for the episode that {{enabled him to}} get into a vision of the {{characters}} in the future, and The Simpsons writer George Meyer {{came up with the idea}} of the Indian casino.

[...] He proceeds to greet everyone in the casino by saying [...] "Hi-how-are-you?" [...] in the rhythm of a stereotypical Native American chant. This joke was pitched by Tom Gammill, and there was a debate among the staff of the show about whether or not to include it in the episode as Native Americans could find it offensive. However, according to Scully, Dan Castellaneta (who voices Homer) [...] "did [...] so funny when we were at the table-read so we decided to put it in and risk offending." ...|$|E
500|$|The trial {{opened on}} 3 April 1895 amid scenes of near {{hysteria}} {{both in the}} press and the public galleries. The extent of the evidence massed against Wilde forced him to declare meekly, [...] "I am the prosecutor in this case". Wilde's lawyer, Sir Edward George Clarke, opened the case by pre-emptively asking Wilde about two suggestive letters Wilde had written to Douglas, which the defence had in its possession. He characterised the first as a [...] "prose sonnet" [...] and admitted that the [...] "poetical language" [...] might <b>seem</b> <b>strange</b> to the court but claimed its intent was innocent. Wilde stated that the letters had been obtained by blackmailers who had attempted to extort money from him, but he had refused, suggesting they should take the £60 (equal to £ today) offered, [...] "unusual for a prose piece of that length". He claimed to regard the letters as works of art rather than something of which to be ashamed.|$|E

500|$|Apart from a {{revision}} of the map of Europe in 1572 {{there would be no}} more large wall maps and Mercator began to address the other tasks that he had outlined in the Cosmographia. The first of these was a new definitive version of Ptolemy's maps. That he should wish to do so may <b>seem</b> <b>strange</b> given that, at the same time, he was planning very different modern maps and other mapmakers, such as his friend Abraham Ortelius, had forsaken Ptolemy completely. It was essentially an act of reverence by one scholar for another, a final epitaph for the Ptolemy who had inspired Mercator's love of geography early in his life. He compared the great many editions of the Ptolemy's written Geographia, which described his two projections and listed the latitude and longitude of some 8000 places, as well as the many different versions of the printed maps which had appeared over the previous one hundred years, all with errors and accretions. Once again, this self-imposed diligence delayed publication and the 28 maps of Ptolemy appeared in 1578, after an interval almost ten years. It was accepted by scholars as the [...] "last word", literally and metaphorically, in a chapter of geography which was closed for good.|$|E

[...] Experience showed that it was safer to drink alcohol than the typically polluted water in Europe. Alcohol was also an effective analgesic, provided energy necessary for hard work, and generally enhanced the quality of life.|$|E

2500|$|The {{inclusion}} of the pagan figure of Caelus may <b>seem</b> <b>strange,</b> {{but he was not}} an important figure in Ancient Roman religion, so was evidently considered as a harmless pictorial convention by the Christian designer of the composition, as well as one of the elements showing continuity with Roman tradition. [...] From the following century personifications of the River Jordan often appear in depictions of the Baptism of Jesus, and the manuscript Chronography of 354, just {{a few years older than}} the sarcophagus and made for another elite Christian, is full of personifications of cities, months and other concepts.

2500|$|Although it may <b>seem</b> <b>strange,</b> {{many kinds}} of {{wetlands}} are also influenced by fire. This usually occurs during periods of drought. [...] In landscapes with peat soils, such as bogs, the peat substrate itself may burn, leaving holes that refill with water as new ponds. Fires that are less intense will remove accumulated litter and allow other wetland plants to regenerate from buried seeds, or from rhizomes. [...] Wetlands that are influenced by fire include coastal marshes, wet prairies, peat bogs, floodplains, prairie marshes and flatwoods. Since wetlands can store large amounts of carbon in peat, the fire frequency of vast northern peatlands is linked to processes controlling the carbon dioxide levels of the atmosphere, and to the phenomenon of global warming.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1857 Goncharov went to Marienbad for medical treatment. There he wrote Oblomov, almost in its entirety.

But it'd been growing in me for several years, so what I had to do then was just sit and write everything down," [...] he later remembered. Goncharov's second novel Oblomov was published in 1859 in Otechestvennye Zapiski. It had evolved from the earlier [...] "Oblomov's Dream", which was later incorporated into the finished novel as Chapter 9. The novel caused much discussion in the Russian press, introduced another new term, oblomovshchina, to the literary lexicon and is regarded as a Russian classic.|$|E
2500|$|Because of the Fidais' {{apparent}} lack of fear {{of personal}} injury or even death could not be understood by the Crusaders, they created and propagated the fictional black legends of the so-called Assassins. According to Daftary, these were [...] "fictions ... meant to provide satisfactory explanations for behavior that would otherwise <b>seem</b> <b>strange</b> to the medieval Western mind." [...] These black legends were then further popularized in the Western world by Marco Polo, the Venetian storyteller who had, in fact, never investigated Sinan in direct contradiction to his claim. Polo asserted that Sinan fed hashish to his drugged followers, the so-called Hashishins (Assassins), so as to fortify them {{with the type of}} courage based in hashish to commit the assassinations of the most intrepid kind.|$|E
2500|$|Thus, Eliade argues, many {{traditional}} societies share common outlines in their mythical geographies. In {{the middle of}} the known world is the sacred Center, [...] "a place that is sacred above all"; this Center anchors the established order. Around the sacred Center lies the known world, the realm of established order; and beyond the known world is a chaotic and dangerous realm, [...] "peopled by ghosts, demons, [...] 'foreigners' (who are [...] demons and the souls of the dead)". According to Eliade, traditional societies place their known world at the Center because (from their perspective) their known world is the realm that obeys a recognizable order, and it therefore must be the realm in which the Sacred manifests itself; the regions beyond the known world, which <b>seem</b> <b>strange</b> and foreign, must lie far from the Center, outside the order established by the Sacred.|$|E
