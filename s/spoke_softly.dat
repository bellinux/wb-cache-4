25|$|After his somber {{meeting with}} his chieftains, Haile Selassie visited Sir Sidney Barton at the British Legation. He <b>spoke</b> <b>softly</b> to Sir Sidney but to the point. Britain had {{encouraged}} him with fine words and had made many promises. However, Britain had provided Ethiopia with few guns for which the Ethiopians had paid cash. Haile Selassie stressed that he had risked his own life for Ethiopia {{but also for the}} League of Nations. He asked Sir Sidney whether Britain would now come to his aid in this hour of direst need. Shortly afterwards Haile Selassie drove away, his mouth grim with disappointment.|$|E
500|$|In 1968 Le Mesurier {{was offered}} a role in a new BBC {{situation}} comedy playing an upper-class Sergeant Arthur Wilson in Dad's Army, although he was the second choice after Robert Dorning. Le Mesurier was unsure about taking the part as he was finishing the final series of George and the Dragon {{and did not want}} another long-term television role. He was persuaded both by an increase in his fee—to £26210s (£262.50) per episode—and by the casting of his old friend Clive Dunn as Corporal Jones. Le Mesurier was initially unsure of how to portray his character, and was advised by series writer Jimmy Perry to make the part his own. Le Mesurier decided to base the character on himself, later writing that [...] "I thought, why not just be myself, use an extension of my own personality and behave rather as I had done in the army? So I always left a button or two undone, and had the sleeve of my battle dress slightly turned up. I <b>spoke</b> <b>softly,</b> issued commands as if they were invitations (the sort not likely to be accepted) and generally assumed a benign air of helplessness". Perry later observed that [...] "we wanted Wilson to be the voice of sanity; he has become John".|$|E
2500|$|The {{next morning}} Changing Woman climbed a hill. [...] Looking in the {{distance}} she saw many monsters approaching {{from the south and}} from the west and from the north. [...] She made four sacred hoops. [...] The white one she threw to the east. [...] The blue one she threw to the south. The yellow one she threw to the west. [...] The black one she threw to the north. [...] At once a strong wind began to circle the hogan. [...] "The wind is too strong for the monsters to enter," [...] she told her sons. [...] We will be safe for one day. [...] But tomorrow the power will be gone." [...] At night, the twins <b>spoke</b> <b>softly</b> to one another. [...] "The monsters are coming for us," [...] they said. [...] "We must leave so the others will be safe." [...] Before dawn, they left and ran down the holy path to the east.|$|E
60|$|Meyer turned {{aside to}} hide his face, and {{presently}} looked up again, and <b>spoke</b> quite <b>softly.</b>|$|R
60|$|She {{looked from}} one to the other of them, {{scanning}} each face in turn. Then her eyes returned to a contemplation of the flaming logs, and she <b>spoke</b> very <b>softly.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Then {{her aunt}} <b>spoke</b> very <b>softly.</b> [...] "Of course, dear Ayala, {{we do not}} wish to do less than we at first intended. But as you are not happy here--" [...] Then she paused, almost ashamed of herself.|$|R
2500|$|Ruppelt {{concluded}} that Adamski was a talented con artist whose UFO stories {{were designed to}} make money from his gullible followers and listeners, and he compared Adamski to the famed hoaxer, carnival, and circus showman PT Barnum. In describing Adamski's speaking style, Ruppelt wrote [...] "to {{look at the man}} and listen to his story you had an immediate urge to believe him...he was dressed in well-worn, but neat, overalls. He had slightly graying hair and the most honest pair of eyes I've ever seen. He <b>spoke</b> <b>softly</b> and naively, almost pathetically, giving the impression that 'most people think I'm crazy, but honestly, I'm really not.'" [...] According to Ruppelt, Adamski had a persuasive effect on his audience, [...] "you could actually have heard the proverbial pin drop" [...] in the restaurant as Adamski told of his initial 1952 meeting with Orthon. When Adamski finished his story, Ruppelt noted that many of his listeners purchased copies of Adamski's UFO photos that were on sale in the restaurant. At another lecture led by Adamski and other well-known contactees, Ruppelt wrote that [...] "people shelled out hard cash to hear Adamski's story." ...|$|E
60|$|The woman went to {{the door}} and <b>spoke</b> <b>softly</b> to her companion.|$|E
60|$|He <b>spoke</b> <b>softly</b> to White Fang {{until he}} had quieted him, then his voice became firm.|$|E
60|$|He <b>spoke</b> so <b>softly,</b> and {{yet with}} so much conviction, that it seemed hard to answer him. Penelope, however, was {{conscious}} of an almost feverish desire either to contradict him or to prolong the conversation by some means or other.|$|R
60|$|In a {{few minutes}} she leaned over {{the upper part of}} the {{banisters}} and <b>softly</b> <b>spoke</b> to him.|$|R
60|$|She <b>spoke</b> very <b>softly,</b> almost {{under her}} breath, {{and when she}} had {{finished}} there seemed everywhere a strange emptiness of sound. The panting of the engine from the motor-car, Stephen's measured words as he walked with his uncongenial companion, seemed to come to John from some other world.|$|R
60|$|Then {{she walked}} up to him {{naturally}} and <b>spoke</b> <b>softly,</b> and reached a hand for his shoulder.|$|E
60|$|Madame Tobain--she told me her name--shook {{her head}} once more. She <b>spoke</b> <b>softly,</b> {{almost as though}} she were {{speaking}} of something sacred.|$|E
6000|$|... “Then {{remember}} what I tell you,” said Appleby, who laid {{his hand on}} the man’s shoulder, <b>spoke</b> <b>softly</b> and rapidly, until the latter nodded.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mayhap even as I." [...] Scundoo <b>spoke</b> quite <b>softly,</b> {{his eyelids}} drooping, slowly drooping, down, down, till {{his eyes were}} all but hidden. [...] "So I am minded of another test. Let every man, woman, and child, now and at once, hold their hands well up above their heads!" ...|$|R
30|$|Today {{the teacher}} <b>spoke</b> and {{questioned}} <b>softly</b> {{and in a}} friendly manner. (Student Linh about Teacher T 3, Lesson 7; Source B).|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{the same}} man," [...] she {{answered}} confidently. [...] "He stopped me and asked if I could direct him to your house. It was {{about half an hour}} after you had gone. He <b>spoke</b> very <b>softly</b> and almost like a foreigner. I told him exactly where your cottage was. Didn't he come to you?" ...|$|R
60|$|Rose <b>spoke</b> <b>softly,</b> {{but with}} great resolution, and nodded her pretty head so energetically that the holly berries came rolling over her white shoulders.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said my uncle, {{and then}} leant forward and <b>spoke</b> <b>softly</b> {{under cover of}} his hand, [...] "It's nothing more or less than..." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He didn't in my dream," [...] {{she said}} doubtfully. She raised long, {{stealthy}} eyes to mine, and <b>spoke</b> <b>softly</b> and deliberately. [...] "Besides, there isn't any little boy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Enemies!" [...] said she, [...] "I hope not." [...] And she <b>spoke</b> so <b>softly,</b> {{so unlike}} her usual self, in the tones so {{suited to a}} loving, {{clinging}} woman, that {{though he did not}} understand it, he was startled at her tenderness. [...] "I have never felt that you were my enemy, Mr. Fitzgerald; and certainly I never was an enemy to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wow!" [...] {{broke in}} the chief Maputa, [...] "this pretty one speaks truth, {{for the white}} man {{would have made a}} bargain with me under which Umgona, the wizard, and Nahoon, the soldier, were to be killed at the Crocodile Drift, and he himself {{suffered}} to escape with the girl. I <b>spoke</b> him <b>softly</b> and said 'yes,' and then like a loyal man I reported to the king." ...|$|R
60|$|She did {{not speak}} again for some time, but he saw that her eyes were full of tears, and he kept his face turned from her. When at last they passed into the city she <b>spoke</b> to him <b>softly.</b>|$|R
60|$|Glancing quickly round, Clay saw {{the driver}} {{sitting by the}} wrecked car; and then the match went out. In the {{darkness}} the nearest men <b>spoke</b> <b>softly</b> to one another.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well?"—she <b>spoke</b> <b>softly,</b> gently. He {{answered}} to {{the call}} like an eager hound. He crossed quickly to her side as she sat sewing, and said, in a low voice: ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{encountered}} Guy Pollock at {{the drug}} store. He {{looked at her}} {{as though he had}} a right to; he <b>spoke</b> <b>softly.</b> [...] "I haven't see you, the last few days." ...|$|E
60|$|Despite his fierce words, {{which for}} a moment had burned in my ears, I pitied him. In the old days he had been my champion, {{and it was his}} hand, {{together}} with hers, which had aided my escape from Cruta. So I <b>spoke</b> to him <b>softly.</b>|$|R
60|$|Umslopogaas greeted Zinita kindly; and yet I {{thought that}} there was {{something}} lacking. At first she <b>spoke</b> to him <b>softly,</b> but when she learned all that had come to pass, her words were not soft, for she reviled me and sang a loud song at Umslopogaas.|$|R
60|$|He would {{apparently}} have backed away in consternation had not Harper, who slipped {{between him and}} the door, stood with his back to it; while Appleby <b>spoke</b> two words <b>softly</b> in Castilian. They were without connection and apparently meaningless, but they carried weight with those who had any hand in the insurrection, and the landlord sat down, evidently irresolute.|$|R
6000|$|She <b>spoke</b> <b>softly.</b> [...] "Listen! For {{at least}} half the years of your sleep--in every {{generation}}--multitudes of people, in every generation greater multitudes of people, have prayed that you might awake--prayed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Would she so?' says he. 'For {{half the}} money I believe I could {{put you in a}} way how to deliver yourself.' But this he <b>spoke</b> <b>softly,</b> that nobody could hear.|$|E
60|$|Jill <b>spoke</b> <b>softly</b> lest {{she should}} disturb the others, and, {{as she turned}} to push up her pillow, she saw Mrs. Minot looking {{at her with a}} smile she did not understand.|$|E
60|$|She <b>spoke</b> rather <b>softly</b> {{and rather}} slowly. Her voice possessed a {{sibilant}} and musical intonation; there {{was perhaps the}} faintest suggestion of an accent. As she stood there smiling upon him in a deep blue gown, trimmed with a silvery fur, {{in the making of}} which no English dressmaker had been concerned, Wolfenden's subjection was absolute and complete. He was aware that his answer was a little flurried. He was less at his ease than he could have wished. Afterwards he thought of a hundred things {{he would have liked to}} have said, but the surprise of seeing them so suddenly had cost him a little of his usual self-possession. Mr. Sabin took up the conversation.|$|R
2500|$|On April 3, Mrs. Virgil Harris, a 65-year-old {{resident}} of Monmouth, returned home at 1:00a.m. {{to find a}} burglar in her house brandishing a knife. He was a sixfoot tall white man who was [...] "very polite" [...] and <b>spoke</b> [...] "very <b>softly</b> with a Southern drawl." [...] The man blindfolded her, tied her up, raped her, ransacked her house, and stole the $2.50 she had earned babysitting that evening.|$|R
60|$|The {{grass was}} green above the dead boy's grave, and trodden by feet {{so small and}} light, that not a daisy drooped its head beneath their pressure. Through all the spring and summertime, garlands of fresh flowers, wreathed by infant hands, rested on the stone; and, when the {{children}} came to change them lest they should wither and be pleasant to him no longer, their eyes filled with tears, and they <b>spoke</b> low and <b>softly</b> of their poor dead cousin.|$|R
