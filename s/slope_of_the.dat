5|$|The {{point at}} which Crusoe will reach an {{equilibrium}} {{between the number of}} hours he works and relaxes can be found out when the highest indifference curve is tangent to the production function. This will be Crusoe's most preferred point provided the technology constraint is given and cannot be changed. At this equilibrium point, the <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> highest indifference curve must equal the <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> production function.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, the {{bombardment}} caused {{a large number}} of casualties. Though some projectiles buried themselves in the soft soil, most found their marks on the reverse <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ridge. The bombardment forced the cavalry of the Union Brigade (in third line) to move to its left, as did the Scots Greys, to reduce their casualty rate.|$|E

5|$|At 03:00 on 26 October, Oka's unit {{finally reached}} and {{attacked}} the Marine defenses near the Matanikau. Oka's troops assaulted all along an east-west saddle ridge held by Hanneken's battalion but concentrated particularly on Hanneken's Company F, which defended the extreme left {{flank of the}} Marine positions on the ridge. A Company F machine gun section under Mitchell Paige killed many of the Japanese attackers, but Japanese fire eventually killed or injured almost all the Marine machine gunners. At 05:00, Oka's 3rd Battalion, 4th Infantry succeeded in scaling the steep <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ridge and pushed the surviving members of Company F off the crest.|$|E

5|$|Due to the <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> site, {{the south}} façade, which overlooks {{the main part}} of the grounds, stands on a raised and terraced {{platform}} with the ground floor raised to first floor level and the basement becoming the ground floor.

Each wing previously had a single-storey bay at its centre but these have been removed.|$|E
5|$|Hengistbury Head is a {{sandstone}} headland forming part of Southbourne, {{which is}} a suburb {{of the town of}} Bournemouth to the west; the nearest major settlement is Christchurch to the north. It is the most easterly part of the Borough of Bournemouth, and marks the most easterly point of Poole Bay. Historically part of Hampshire, the Local Government Act 1972 designated the area a part of Dorset. The northern <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill tailing off towards the sea forms Mudeford spit, the sand bar closing Christchurch Harbour from the south.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Coria and Currie {{found that}} various {{features}} of the rear part of the skull (such as the frontwards <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> occiput and low and wide occipital condyle) indicate that Giganotosaurus {{would have had a}} good capability of moving the skull sideways in relation to the front neck vertebrae. These features may also have been related to the increased mass and length of the jaw muscles; the jaw articulation of Giganotosaurus and other carcharodontosaurids was moved hindwards to increase the length of the jaw musculature, enabling faster closure of the jaws, whereas tyrannosaurs increased the mass of the lower jaw musculature, to increase the power of their bite.|$|E

5|$|In {{an effort}} to pull British {{resources}} from the observed build-up in the Somme, the XIII (Royal Württemberg) Corps and the 117th Infantry Division attacked an arc of high ground positions, defended by the Canadian Corps. The German forces initially captured the heights at Mount Sorrel and Tor Top before entrenching on the far <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ridge. Following a number attacks and counterattacks, two divisions of the Canadian Corps, supported by the 20th Light Division and Second Army siege and howitzer battery groups, recaptured {{the majority of their}} former positions.|$|E
5|$|In the US, lithium is {{recovered}} from brine pools in Nevada. Half the world's known reserves {{are located in}} Bolivia along the central eastern <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Andes. In 2009, Bolivia negotiated with Japanese, French, and Korean firms to begin extraction. A deposit discovered in 2013 in Wyoming's Rock Springs Uplift is estimated to contain 228,000 tons. Additional deposits in the same formation were estimated {{to be as much}} as 18 million tons.|$|E
5|$|On the {{northern}} end of the battlefield, events had unfolded quite differently. Dampierre's cavalry routed Lannoy's company of light horse; the Italians and the contingent from Gruyères, meanwhile, broke and fled—leaving their officers to be killed—without offering any real resistance to the advancing Imperial infantry. As Cardona's infantry moved past the original French line, Enghien descended on it with the entire body of heavy cavalry under his command; the subsequent engagement took place on the reverse <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ridge, {{out of sight of the}} rest of the battlefield.|$|E

5|$|The 24th Infantry {{consistently}} captured Battle Mountain in {{the same}} way. Artillery, mortar, and tank fire raked the crest and air strikes employing napalm blanketed {{the top of the}} peak. Then, the infantry attacked from the hill beneath the east <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> summit. Supporting mortars would set up a base of fire and kept the heights under barrage until the infantry had arrived at a point just short of the crest. The mortar fire then lifted and the infantry moved rapidly up the last stretch to the top, usually to find it abandoned by the North Koreans.|$|E
5|$|The Army met little {{resistance}} as it advanced {{through the}} Black Forest in four columns, through the Höllental (Hölle valley), via Oberkirch, and Freudenstadt, {{and at the}} southern end of the forest, along the Rhine bank. Although prudent counsel might have advised Jourdan to establish a position on the eastern <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountains, he did not; instead he pushed across the Danube plain, taking position between Rottweil and Tuttlingen.|$|E
5|$|The Great Salt Lake is fed {{by three}} major rivers and several minor streams. The three major rivers are each fed {{directly}} or indirectly from the Uinta Mountain range in northeastern Utah. The Bear River starts on the north <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Uintas and flows north past Bear Lake, into which some of Bear River's waters have been diverted via a man-made canal into the lake, but later empty back into the river {{by means of the}} Bear Lake Outlet. The river then turns south in southern Idaho and eventually flows into the northeast arm of the Great Salt Lake. The Weber River also starts on the north <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Uinta Mountains and flows into the east edge of the lake. The Jordan River does not receive its water directly from the Uintas, rather it flows from freshwater Utah Lake, which itself is fed primarily by the Provo River; the Provo River does originate in the Uintas, {{a few miles from the}} Weber and Bear. The Jordan flows from the north part of Utah Lake into the southeast corner of the Great Salt Lake.|$|E

There have also been reports of vandalism and misuse of the property since the 19thcentury, and in 2007 some of the cemetery grounds were occupied by the homeless.|$|E
5|$|The North American {{river otter}} is found {{throughout}} North America, inhabiting inland waterways and coastal areas in Canada, the Pacific Northwest, the Atlantic states, and the Gulf of Mexico.

5|$|The breed {{standards}} of the Australian, American and Canadian kennel clubs specify that the Australian Cattle Dog should have a natural, long, un-docked tail.

It should hang in a slight curve at rest, though an excited dog may carry its tail higher. The tail should feature a reasonable level of brush.|$|E
