5000|$|An {{alternative}} to the oscillating agitator design is the impeller type washtub pioneered by Hoover on its long running Hoovermatic series of top loading machines. Here, an impeller (trademarked by Hoover as a [...] "Pulsator") mounted {{on the side of}} the tub spins in a constant direction, and creates a fast moving current of water in the tub which drags the clothes through the water along a toroidal path. The impeller design has the advantage of its mechanical simplicity - a <b>single</b> <b>speed</b> <b>motor</b> with belt drive is all that is required to drive the Pulsator with no need for gearboxes or complex electrical controls, but has the disadvantage of lower load capacity in relation to tub size. Hoovermatic machines were made mostly in twin tub format for the European market - (where they competed with Hotpoint's Supermatic line which used the oscillating agitator design) until the early 1990s. Some industrial garment testing machines still use the Hoover wash action.|$|E
40|$|LectureThe {{popularity}} of VFD motors in compressor trains {{has increased in}} recent years. Increased process flexibility is a primary consideration for implementation of VFD systems. However, this comes {{at a cost of}} increased mechanical and electrical complexity. Problems rarely experienced with <b>single</b> <b>speed</b> <b>motors</b> have become more likely with VFD's. These include impacts on the torsional behavior leading to component failure and extended downtimes. VFD's can excite the torsional system in several ways. This paper examines the impact of white noise on the torsional response of VFD compressor trains and contrasts it against the response to single frequency harmonic excitation. The characteristics of white noise, noise modeling characteristics for torsional response, and noise generation techniques are examined. Generation of a frequency banded noise signal is presented using a commonly used math modeling code. Two case studies are presented representing VFD compressor trains found in the LNG industry. Both experienced torsional problems related to the VFD and, in one case, led to a coupling failure and release of parts from the train. In the examination of these trains, a single frequency harmonic (SFH) sweep and banded Gaussian white noise (GWN) encompassing the dynamic response envelop of the 1 st TNF, are used as inputs to the torsional analysis...|$|R

50|$|Also, {{direct-drive}} mechanisms need a {{more precise}} control mechanism. High <b>speed</b> <b>motors</b> with <b>speed</b> reduction have relatively high inertia, which helps smooth the output motion. Most motors exhibit positional torque ripple known as cogging torque. In high <b>speed</b> <b>motors,</b> this effect is usually negligible, as the frequency at which it occurs is too high to significantly affect system performance; direct drive units will suffer more from this phenomenon, unless additional inertia is added (i.e. by a flywheel) or the system uses feedback to actively counter the effect.|$|R

40|$|Naming <b>speed,</b> <b>motor</b> skill, and {{auditory}} temporal processing (ATP) are constructs {{that are important}} to reading and language. These variables require processing timing information inherent in the stimulus or processing stimuli rapidly. ATP deficits are found in individuals with reading impairments, but studies are conflicting regarding the relationship between reading and ATP. This study examined relationships between naming <b>speed,</b> <b>motor</b> <b>speed,</b> and ATP, and centered on possible factors why inconsistencies have occurred across studies examining the association between reading and ATP. If the timing element of naming speed (rapid automatized naming-RAN) and of <b>motor</b> <b>speed</b> is common to ATP, then RAN and <b>motor</b> <b>speed</b> should predict thresholds for three auditory tasks (CMR, backward masking, and the precedence effect with TOJ) known to require temporal processing. Tasks were administered to adult participants in order to examine the effects with skilled readers. Many of the variables were skewed and there were multiple outliers that altered the analyses. Ultimately, 75 participants were included in the final data set. Results indicated that RAN did not predict thresholds for any of the masking tasks given. However, <b>motor</b> <b>speed</b> predicted thresholds for one CMR and two backward masking tasks, suggesting that <b>motor</b> <b>speed</b> should be controlled for in research assessing the contribution of ATP to reading or language. Neither naming <b>speed</b> nor <b>motor</b> <b>speed</b> predicted localization performance. Non-verbal intelligence predicted performance on several of the masking tasks, consistent with previous research. Performance on all three auditory tasks was similar to that reported in the literature assessing smaller samples of participants. Although the suggestion of a general timing component is not supported, the relationships found between <b>motor</b> <b>speed</b> and several auditory temporal measures indicate that the underlying timing elements are not independent...|$|R

40|$|Pure {{electric}} vehicles (PEVs) provide a unique problem in powertrain design through {{the meeting of}} performance specifications whilst maximising driving range. The consideration of <b>single</b> <b>speed</b> and multispeed transmissions for {{electric vehicles}} provides two strategies for achieving desired range and performance specifications. Through the implementation of system level vehicle models, design analysis, and optimisation, this paper analyses the application of both <b>single</b> <b>speed</b> and two-speed transmission applications to electric vehicles. Initially, transmission ratios are designed based on grade and top speed requirements, and impact on vehicle traction curve is evaluated. Then performance studies are conducted for different transmission ratios using both <b>single</b> <b>speed</b> and two-speed powertrain configurations to provide a comparative assessment of the vehicles. Finally, multivariable optimisation {{in the form of}} genetic algorithms is employed to determine an optimal gear ratio selection for <b>single</b> <b>speed</b> and two-speed PEVs. Results demonstrate that the two-speed transmission is capable of achieving better results for performance requirements over a <b>single</b> <b>speed</b> transmission, including vehicle acceleration and grade climbing. However, the lower powertrain efficiency reduces the simulated range results...|$|R
