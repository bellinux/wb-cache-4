5|$|Saturn, Narcissus and Cuckoo joined Aigle and Impétueux {{during the}} night and the {{following}} morning at dawn, the five British returned to the island but no further attempt was made on either of the French frigates. Six days later the <b>stranded</b> <b>ship</b> was re-floated and both vessels arrived safely in Lorient.|$|E
5|$|While in the Bay of Campeche, {{the shrimp}} boat Celestino Arias was sunken by strong waves {{generated}} by Janet after it suffered engine failures. The <b>stranded</b> <b>ship</b> was heavily {{damaged by the}} hurricane's strong winds in the bay, which broke towing lines. All of the ship's crewmen, which had evacuated the boat after it sunk, were later rescued and brought back to Tampa, Florida. Along the coast, tides were reported to be 3–4ft (0.91–1.2m) above average. Farther north along the Texas coast, tides were 2ft (0.61m) above average, blocking beach roads near Corpus Christi.|$|E
5|$|Stroma's violent storms {{occasionally}} wrought destruction on the island. In December 1862, a great storm broke {{over the}} island {{with such force that}} it swept right across the northern end of Stroma, leaving wreckage, rocks and seaweed {{on the top of the}} 100-foot-high cliffs and destroying the channels leading to the watermill. However, the sea's destructive power had one positive benefit for the islanders, if not for those caught out by the currents and shoals of the Pentland Firth. Over the last two hundred years, over sixty vessels ranging from fishing boats to large cargo vessels have been wrecked on the shores of Stroma, with many more vessels coming to grief on the reefs and shoals of the neighbouring mainland and Orkney coasts. Many vessels – at least 560 between 1830 and 1990 – have had to be refloated in the Pentland Firth after getting into difficulties. Shipwrecks were a valuable source of income, timber and goods for the islanders, who would salvage liberally – and often with little regard for legality – whenever a <b>stranded</b> <b>ship</b> was abandoned. The building of Stroma's first lighthouse in the late 19th century was initially opposed by some of the islanders who were more concerned with profiting from shipwrecks than preventing them.|$|E
50|$|In earlier times, {{however, the}} farmers had {{supplemented}} sheep farming by {{trips to the}} coast, where they hunted seals and collected eggs. <b>Stranded</b> <b>ships</b> provided excellent material for making various items, {{and some of the}} Skaftafell farmers became well known for their crafting talents.|$|R
50|$|Velocitys {{gameplay}} involves {{navigating the}} Quarp Jet - a teleporting spacecraft - through space, whilst avoiding and defeating enemies using bombs {{that can be}} flung in cardinal directions. The main goal {{of the game is}} to rescue <b>stranded</b> <b>ships.</b> The game adds depth by introducing new abilities and obstacles. The <b>stranded</b> <b>ships</b> are protected by shields that must be disabled by switches in a specific order. The player's ship has the ability to fire bombs. The game allows the player to teleport their ship anywhere. It also allows the player create telepods which they can return to anytime. The telepods add a puzzle element to the game because the player has to return to activate the switches in the right order.|$|R
50|$|They {{found the}} English hastily {{preparing}} to leave in an armada of one hundred ships. The speed of Wallace's arrival from Dunottar caught the English unawares and at low tide the <b>stranded</b> <b>ships</b> were attacked in the harbour, the crew and soldiers slaughtered, the cargo taken and the ships burnt.|$|R
5|$|On September16, strong waves {{produced}} by the hurricane disabled the Swedish freighter Laponia, {{which at the time}} was located 300mi (480km) east of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. The ship was initially en route for Rio de Janeiro carrying cargo for the Bethlehem Steel Company. As a result of the <b>stranded</b> <b>ship,</b> the SS President Roosevelt was forced to divert its course in order to render aid. The United States Coast Guard cutters USCGC Sebago (WHEC-42) and USCGC Carrabasset (WAT-55) were sent from the Virginia Capes in order to provide assistance. In addition, a coast guard plane was dispatched from Elizabeth City, North Carolina. The ships remained on standby to monitor the Laponia for three hours before conditions were considered safe to tow the stricken ship back to shore. Two fishing vessels capsized off Barnegat and Edgemere, New York, with both incidents resulting in a fatality. A cabin cruiser was sent to rescue occupants of the capsized boat off Edgemere, though it was also disrupted by rough seas. The ship was later able to rescue the other surviving crew members. Numerous other small craft off Long Island signaled distress calls to the US Coast Guard due to strong waves offshore. Eventually passing east of New England, the storm's large size resulted in heavy rainfall near Nantucket Island, Massachusetts. A weather station on the island reported maximum sustained winds of 45mph (70km/h). In Eastport, Maine, a weather station recorded a minimum barometric pressure of 993mbar (hPa; 29.33inHg) and wind speeds of 33mph (53km/h). In Maine, power lines were downed, damaging communications. In Bar Harbor, strong winds caused five fires, which were later extinguished. The schooner George Dresser ran aground on the port's coast. The hurricane also produced slight snowfalls in northern areas of the state.|$|E
500|$|The {{crowds of}} onlookers {{continued}} {{to watch as}} salvage efforts progressed; a 75-year-old woman from Oakland fell down the embankment while watching the action on 13 October. The mayor of San Francisco, Angelo J. Rossi, rode the breeches buoy to the ship and toured it for 45 minutes on 19 October. On 22 October, the Los Angeles Times ran an Associated Press story saying that marine experts were considering {{the use of a}} method first patented by Abraham Lincoln in May 1849 in order to re-float the <b>stranded</b> <b>ship.</b> All efforts, however, were unsuccessful, and by 31 October, American-Hawaiian placed an advertisement in the Los Angeles Times requesting bids for the purchase of the ship and her cargo [...] "as and where she now lies ... on the rocks near Point Lobos, San Francisco". E. J. Mitchell was the winning bidder, securing rights to the ship and its cargo for $2,800.|$|E
500|$|Magdeburg {{was used}} as a torpedo test ship before the {{outbreak}} of World War I in August 1914, after which she was assigned to the Baltic. She conducted a series of raids on Russian positions culminating in a sweep into the Gulf of Finland that resulted in her grounding off the Estonian coast. Russian cruisers seized the <b>stranded</b> <b>ship</b> and captured code books; they gave one copy to the British Royal Navy, which used it to great advantage. Breslau was assigned to the Mittelmeerdivision with the battlecruiser [...] in 1912 and remained in the Mediterranean until the outbreak of war. After evading British warships, the two vessels reached Constantinople, where they were transferred to the Ottoman Navy. She operated primarily in the Black Sea against the Russian Navy, but in January 1918 she ventured into the Mediterranean and was mined and sunk after the Battle of Imbros.|$|E
50|$|Weight {{continued}} her vital but unglamorous salvage routine at Naples well into April. Between 10 and 25 February, she assisted and repaired HMS Kempenfelt, the damaged minesweeper Pilot (AM-104), and LCI-3 {{as well as}} Weazel. On the 26th, she got underway for the beach off Bagnoli, Italy, to tow off <b>stranded</b> <b>ships.</b>|$|R

Grapple also has salvage and machine shops, and hull repair materials to effect temporary hull repairs on stranded or otherwise damaged ships.|$|R
50|$|Capt. Ramón Acha Caamaño {{was placed}} in charge of {{retrieving}} the ship's cargo. The men under his command quickly removed {{as much of the}} <b>stranded</b> <b>ship's</b> cargo as possible. The desperate efforts proved fruitful, and nearly the entire cargo was salvaged from the hulk. Only some minor articles and one cannon that had fallen overboard during salvage attempts were lost.|$|R
500|$|In {{early morning}} hours of 8 October 1936, however, Ohioan ran aground near Seal Rock on the south shore of the Golden Gate, just outside San Francisco Bay. The ship, sailing in a dense fog, strayed too close to shore and {{grounded}} on the rocks, sending a shower of sparks that lit up the night. When the fog cleared later in the morning, the ship was firmly seated on the rocks {{at the base of a}} [...] cliff, and some [...] from the mainland. Coast Guardsmen on shore attached three lines to the ship and set up a breeches buoy to take off the harbor pilot, but the crew stayed on board the ship in hopes that the high tide would free her from the rocky perch. As word of the shipwreck spread, spectators clambered over the cliff to get a view of the scene; one man died from a heart attack and two women broke ankles in separate falls. Newsboys soon arrived on the scene, selling newspapers telling of Ohioans woe within sight of the <b>stranded</b> <b>ship.</b> Policemen were called out to keep order as the crowd grew into the thousands.|$|E
500|$|Saumarez {{responded by}} cutting his the cables on Caesar and wearing past the {{becalmed}} Audacious and Venerable, taking up station off Indomptables vulnerable bows and repeatedly raking the <b>stranded</b> <b>ship.</b> Audacious followed the flagship at 12:00, taking {{up a new}} station between Caesar and Indomptable and also opening fire on the beleaguered Indomptable. Both Caesar and Audacious were now directly exposed however to the heavy fire from Isla Verda, the batteries there and all around the bay now manned by French sailors who had evacuated the grounded ships of the line. Audacious had been becalmed [...] with Desaix off the bow {{and out of the}} ship's field of fire and it took considerable time and effort with the ship's boats to affect the turn needed to engage the French ship. Spencer and Venerable, ordered to join the attack, were unable to take up their intended positions due to the absence of wind, Venerable losing its mizen-topmast to French shot as Hood attempted to wear his ship around. Venerables masts and rigging had been so badly torn by this stage of the battle that Hood was no longer able to effectively manoeuvre in the fitful breeze, although he did eventually pull his ship within range.|$|E
500|$|Although winds in New Hampshire, {{along the}} hurricane's {{northern}} edge, were less severe, higher snowfall totals were recorded. In Portsmouth, damage was minimal and mainly confined to fences. On 10October, thundersnow {{was observed in}} Walpole as precipitation changed due to sinking temperatures, which soon followed by a period of high winds. Though the average snowfall amount in the Connecticut River Valley {{was estimated to be}} near , much of it quickly melted, leaving only [...] left by the snowstorm's departure. Still, the heavy weight of the unusually early wet snow snapped many tree branches still in full bloom, ruining fruit orchards and sugar groves. As a result, production of cider, already in low supply, was reduced even further; damages to one orchard alone reached $300 (1804USD). Due to snow-obstructed roads, post was delivered on horseback, and at Gilsum, the hurricane was so intense that a group of men traveling toward Keene were forced to return due to blocked roads smothered with over [...] of snow. The timber industry suffered the blizzard's detrimental effects, the worst blow to the trade since its formation in New Hampshire; in addition, several barns were obliterated. Totals reached [...] at Hanover, [...] at Goffstown, and over [...] in the Green Mountains; meanwhile, in southern portions of the state, [...] of ice accrued upon the accumulations already on the ground. The storm's damage radius was estimated to be at least , and encompassed the towns of Peterborough, Rindge, Lyme, and Amherst, each received [...] of frozen precipitation. At Rye Beach, a woman, swept to sea on a <b>stranded</b> <b>ship,</b> was found dead with an infant in her hands, and the Amity was also wrecked along its shores, causing an additional death.|$|E
50|$|The first {{recorded}} rescue using the Manby apparatus was on 18 February 1808, with Manby himself in charge. The crew of seven {{were brought to}} safety from the Plymouth Brig Elizabeth, stranded off the shore at Great Yarmouth.

40|$|It is {{necessary}} to study on the safety of "the refugee of harbour" {{from the viewpoint of}} port planning, too. Recently, breakage casualties of <b>stranded</b> <b>ships</b> become very serious in the port operation and the coastal environment. However, these problems have not been discussed among the coastal engineering and shipbuilding, neither. In this study, we summarize the importance of this point by showing the statistic of casualties. Then, the strength of ship hulls is caluclated with strip method and the basic dynamics of material, when ships are designed to navigate in the ocean. Since the calculated results cannot explain the breakage casualties, the possibility of the enlarged stress due to the crack is also considered as a simple example. The results can explain that the breakage of <b>stranded</b> <b>ships</b> may be caused by the enlarged stress due to cracks on the ship hull. Therefore, the safety of coastal areas outside harbour should be considered totally with anchored ship motions and fracture mechanics of ships in detail in the future...|$|R

Starting in 1876, James Buchanan Eads (1820-1887) solved the problem with a wooden jetty system that narrowed the main outlet of the river. This caused the river to speed up and cut its channel deeper, so allowing year-round navigation and safe access to the river for large steamers. In the twenty years following the completion of the jetties, trade at New Orleans doubled. Eads was thus honored by having the port at South Pass named after him.|$|R
