5|$|Between 1972 and 1975, {{what is now}} the B {{store in}} Great Stone Road was the 3,000-capacity Hardrock Theatre and Village Discothèque, hosting <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> period's major artists in their prime. Led Zeppelin, David Bowie, Bob Marley, Elton John, Hawkwind, Yes, Chaka Khan, Curved Air and Lou Reed were amongst those who appeared. Tangerine Dream was the last band to perform at the Hardrock, on 19 October 1975. In more recent years, Lancashire Cricket Club's Old Trafford ground, next door, has {{provided}} a concert venue for bands such as Oasis, Foo Fighters, The Cure, Radiohead, Coldplay, Arctic Monkeys and Take That.|$|E
5|$|In 1892, Du Bois {{received}} a fellowship from the John F. Slater Fund for the Education of Freedmen {{to attend the}} University of Berlin for graduate work. While a student in Berlin, he traveled extensively throughout Europe. He came of age intellectually in the German capital, while studying with <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> nation's most prominent social scientists, including Gustav von Schmoller, Adolph Wagner, and Heinrich von Treitschke. After returning from Europe, Du Bois completed his graduate studies; in 1895 {{he was the first}} African American to earn a Ph.D. from Harvard University. His dissertation was The Suppression of the African Slave Trade to the United States of America, 1638–1871.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the riot}} {{appeared}} to increase {{public support for}} radical reform of the present degrading prison system. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> goodwill will have been eroded by the antics of the rioters {{in the last two}} weeks, and may be further eroded once details emerge during the forthcoming criminal prosecutions. But this must not deflect Home Office ministers from the road down which they had belatedly begun to travel. A change in prison conditions is crucial if good order is to be restored to the system.|$|E

5|$|Morgan {{was driving}} from Leeds to Southampton Docks {{when he picked}} up Figard on 19 December 1995. Detectives {{concluded}} that after raping and killing her, Morgan left her body in the bottom bunk of his cab for up to ten days while he continued to drive the lorry, driving and sleeping in it for at least <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> time, before disposing of the body on 29 December. He was arrested in February 1996 after another lorry driver recognised him from a photofit. Morgan initially denied meeting her, but after he was picked out at an identity parade, he claimed he and Figard had met and engaged in consensual sex.|$|E
5|$|Most {{stars are}} {{observed}} {{to be members}} of binary star systems, and the properties of those binaries are the result of the conditions in which they formed. A gas cloud must lose its angular momentum in order to collapse and form a star. The fragmentation of the cloud into multiple stars distributes <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> angular momentum. The primordial binaries transfer some angular momentum by gravitational interactions during close encounters with other stars in young stellar clusters. These interactions tend to split apart more widely separated (soft) binaries while causing hard binaries to become more tightly bound. This produces the separation of binaries into their two observed populations distributions.|$|E
5|$|The MacIntyres of Rannoch, were {{hereditary}} pipers to {{the chiefs}} of Clan Menzies and composed <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> clan’s music.

50|$|An {{additional}} {{copy protection}} problem {{was found on}} <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the disks <b>that</b> were published by EMI. These disks contained Cactus Data Shield copy protection.

5|$|A year later, {{the band}} decided {{to enter into}} a battle of bands contest, which {{included}} over 250 musical ensembles. The music competition's prize was $3,000 and two days in a recording studio. The band then decided it was time for another guitarist, to fill in <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> empty sounds during guitar solo's and to add to the band for a more full sound live. Through friends, Barrales contacted guitarist Juan Juarez and asked him to join Bonded by Blood. Juarez accepted and he then met the rest of the members and they all liked him as well. After winning round after round, Bonded by Blood finally won first place. The band then recorded the demo Four Pints of Blood at Love Juice Labs in the Californian city of Riverside. With this demo, Bonded by Blood gave people something to listen to and it gave the band an audience.|$|E
5|$|The canal made {{sufficient}} {{money to}} repay substantial debts in 1804 and 1805, after which dividends were {{paid to the}} shareholders, beginning at 2 per cent in 1806, rising to 5 per cent in 1815, and reaching their highest level of 8.6 per cent in 1839. The tolls brought in an income which remained below £9,000 until 1823, but then rose steadily to reach £13,079 in 1841. Traffic towards Grantham included coal and coke, lime, groceries and building materials. Some of it supplied villages {{along the line of}} the canal, and <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> which travelled the full distance was distributed by land to villages beyond Grantham. Downward traffic was largely agricultural produce, including corn, beans, malt and wool. Such produce was normally loaded at Grantham or Harby.|$|E
5|$|The {{period from}} 1480 to 1482 has puzzled biographers; {{contradictory}} evidence exists suggesting either that Josquin {{was still in}} France, or {{was already in the}} service of the Sforza family, specifically with Ascanio Sforza, who had been banished from Milan and resided temporarily in Ferrara or Naples. Residence in Ferrara in the early 1480s could explain the Missa Hercules dux Ferrariae, composed for Ercole d'Este, but which stylistically does not fit with the usual date of 1503–4 when Josquin was known to be in Ferrara. Alternatively it has been suggested that Josquin spent <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> time in Hungary, based on a mid-16th-century Roman document describing the Hungarian court in those years, and including Josquin as one of the musicians present.|$|E
