5|$|A {{review of}} the book in the Leiden Journal of International Law by Tamás Hoffmann {{recommends}} the work to multiple potential readers, including those who engage in targeting killing, academics, and students. Hoffmann calls it a well-researched monograph and helpful reference work on the subject. The review places the book {{within the context of}} addressing legal issues inherent in debating the murky concept of targeted killing. Hoffmann states the book furthers prior attempts to come to a resolution {{on the question of the}} practice's legality. Helen Durhan praises the writing quality of Melzer's work, in a review for the Australian Year Book of International Law. Durhan writes the work is organized in an easily readable format and covers the topic with neutrality. <b>She</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> call the book a work representing the need for concerned discussion prior to implementing any policy involved in eliminating people. Of the author's focus throughout the work, Durhan observes that the author handles discussion of the legality of targeted killing in a clear and precise manner. The review concludes Melzer's thorough analysis goes a long way towards furthering scholars' impressions of legal issues surrounding when it is permitted for sovereign governments to kill people.|$|E

25|$|That {{last part}} of Sojourner's speech brings in her main focus. Some freed enslaved people were living on {{government}} aid at that time, paid for by taxpayers. Sojourner announces {{that this is not}} any better for those colored people than it is for the members of her audience. She then proposes that black people are given their own land. Because a portion of the South's population contained rebels that were unhappy with the abolishment of slavery, that region of the United States was not well suited for colored people. <b>She</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> suggest that colored people be given land out west to build homes and prosper on.|$|E
25|$|Daw Amar nudges up to Ba Zaw’s {{connection}} to both Saya Chone and Ba Ohn. She states that Ba Zaw {{was very good}} at painting Traditional Burmese arabesque, one of the skills which Min Naing claims he learned from Saya Chone. She also mentions that Ba Ohn was the first Burmese painter to illustrate school textbooks, and that when Ba Ohn’s illustrations became outdated, Ba Zaw was hired by Macmillan to illustrate “Burmese Peacock” readers, but she stoutly emphasizes that Ba Zaw accomplished these illustrations on his own, without instruction. <b>She</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> say, however, that Ba Ohn learned painting techniques from B.H. Wiles (a European painter in Burma who also taught Maung Maung Gyi) and adds that Ba Zaw was also friendly with Wiles. One must wonder if these three painters sometimes kept company, and if Ba Zaw not only learned something from Ba Ohn but also Wiles.|$|E
25|$|Eighth Anniversary of Negro Freedom—New Year's Day, 1871: On this {{occasion}} the Boston papers related that “...seldom {{is there an}} occasion of more attraction or greater general interest. Every available space of sitting and standing room was crowded". She starts off her speech by giving a little background about her own life. Sojourner recounts how her mother told her to pray to God {{that she may have}} good masters and mistresses. <b>She</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> retell how her masters were not good to her, about how she was whipped for not understanding English, and how she would question God why he had not made her masters be good to her. Sojourner admits to the audience that she had once hated white people, but she says once she met her final master, Jesus, she was filled with love for everyone. Once enslaved folks were emancipated, she tells the crowd she knew her prayers had been answered.|$|E

25|$|Portrayed as headstrong, flirty and manipulative, early storylines {{featuring}} Sam {{concentrate on}} her teen elopement {{to the character}} Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen). <b>She</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> feature in storylines about topless modelling, various family crises, relationships, feuds, and a short-lived marriage to Andy Hunter (Michael Higgs). Her exit storyline in 2005 {{is the culmination of}} a high-profile storyline that sees the character wrongly imprisoned for Den Watts' (Leslie Grantham) murder. In the on-screen events, Sam is cleared of murder and released, but she flees the country to escape another prison sentence for perverting the course of justice. Her brief return in 2009 sees the character resurrect a relationship with Ricky whilst having an on-off affair with Jack Branning (Scott Maslen), being manipulated by her uncle Archie Mitchell (Larry Lamb) and causing her family to lose a number of their businesses for a second time before finally going to prison. Her return in 2010 and 2016 sees her struggle with motherhood after giving birth to Jack's baby, Ricky (Henri Charles).|$|E
25|$|Fiona {{stops by}} the pawn shop to see Gideon, now that Emma has regained her memories, where {{it turns out}} that Fiona had {{reclaimed}} Gideon's heart with Curse. Then, she uses him to recover her own wand, which she uses to decipher the mysterious writings that Henry had scribbled in the page. Fiona then reads the inscriptions, which details the birth of Light and Darkness, their battle throughout the ages waged via their emissaries, the deaths of the previous Saviors and their enemies at each others' hands, and how the Final Battle will begin after the Emma's birth. After Gideon leaves to find Emma, Gold arrives in the shop, but Fiona fails to trick Gold into thinking that she had only come for her watch. When Gold confronts Fiona about her plans, she tells her son that once the Final Battle is over, the Curse will be lifted and they can be a family again. She also tells Gold that after she destroys all Light Magic, she will have so much power that she will be able to break the Laws of Magic at will, and she will even be able to bring back the dead. She tells him that she can bring back his first-born son, Baelfire, for him. <b>She</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> say that with her new powers, she {{will be able to make}} his family love him as the Dark One, so that he can keep his power. However, Gold knows that is will come with a steep price and tells her that he refuses to pay the price of magic anymore slipping Fiona's wand into his hand. He forces her onto the ground with magic vowing to make her pay for what she did to Belle. Fiona tells Gold that she had deciphered Henry's writing. She learned that Darkness cannot destroy Light since Darkness isn't strong enough. However, Light can destroy Light. She explains she gave Gideon one final command; to kill Emma, and that even if she dies, Gideon will still be forced to carry out her command. Gold decides to test this and kills Fiona with her own wand, breaking the Dark Curse. This causes Snow, David, Regina, Hook, and Zelena to be transported back to Storybrooke from the Enchanted Forest while Emma and the other residents of Storybrooke regain their memories. Soon afterward Belle returns to Gold and comforts him over his actions, while Gideon arrives at the office with his own enchanted sword in hand. As expected, Gideon confronts Emma and is ready to face off against her.|$|E

500|$|Warm tonalities {{dominate}} the composition, which is painted {{in a series}} of long and short strokes and with even distribution of lighting. Filipovitch-Robinson notes the intimate feel of the painting, which she attributes to Jovanović's familiarity with Balkan life. [...] "He was not a stranger to the scene," [...] she states. [...] "He knew his cast of village characters, their interactions, attitudes and consequent expressions and body language." [...] The composition itself, she continues, depicts both [...] "preparation and celebration". The gold coins the bride is wearing, Filipovitch-Robinson observes, are part of the dowry, and signal [...] "familial obligation and pride as well as contractual expectations even among villagers of modest means". <b>She</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> contrast the bride's elaborate garb with the impoverished plainness of her surroundings.|$|E

Following the end of the war, Carter is working in a secretarial role despite her status as an agent. Approached by Howard Stark, whom she had also worked with during the war, to help clear his name after being framed for selling weapons to the USSR, Carter agrees to go behind the backs of her superiors. Her treason is eventually discovered by Agent Daniel Sousa, but she is let off when she helps stop the Russians. <b>She</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> earn the respect of her coworkers, instigate the defeat of Whitney Frost, and start a relationship with Sousa.|$|E
500|$|Allison Mack characterizes Chloe {{as being}} a [...] "misfit" [...] during the first season; more of [...] "a really smart girl with attitude". <b>She</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> {{describe}} Chloe as intelligent and independent. Another of Chloe's defining characteristics is her need to [...] "expose falsehoods" [...] and find the truth in every situation. The character is curious, and wants {{to be honest with}} people. She is always {{trying to make sense of}} the situation. Next to her curiosity, her impulsiveness is a key characteristic that eventually leaves her under the control of Lionel Luthor, when she offers to uncover information on Clark for Lionel. The reason for this betrayal is based on Chloe's love for Clark. As Allison Mack explains, Chloe is so blinded by her love for Clark that she neglects to see all of the mistakes that he makes. It is this unrequited love for Clark that [...] "drives [...] to be as ambitious and as focused as she is".|$|E

She also develops a friendship with Callie Torres which becomes temporarily strained when Callie is led to believe Hahn has romantic designs on her. Although Hahn laughs off the notion, <b>she</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> kiss Callie in front of Sloan, {{to prove that he}} couldn't handle a threesome with the two of them, leaving Callie stunned. In the season four finale, Callie initiates a second passionate kiss, which Hahn reciprocates. The two attempt a romantic relationship, but while Erica comes to terms with her sexuality quickly, Callie is not so sure of herself, and sleeps with Mark Sloan to [...] "make sure". Erica initially forgives her, but eventually decides that she does not want a relationship with Callie while she is still so unsure about her sexuality, and so leaves her post at Seattle Grace.|$|E
500|$|In a 2000 Entertainment Weekly review, Marc Bernadin complimented {{the show}} on its [...] "spot-on pop-culture acumen" [...] and [...] "unparalleled sense of fun", giving it a warm welcome from earlier [...] "lame" [...] superhero {{cartoons}} that he grew up with. Peter Marks of The New York Times noted the show's use of adult humor and pop culture references, declaring it [...] "the sort of playful satire that can appeal as much to a viewer of 37 as 7." [...] Joly Herman of Common Sense Media describes the show as a [...] "cute, highly stylized series thrills the senses with its strange characters, funny situations, and lots of lowbrow humor". <b>She</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> say, however, that the show does go from innocent to violent in no time {{and that there is}} not much protecting young viewers against the violent undertones.

500|$|In the 18th and 19th centuries historians {{characterized}} Isabeau as [...] "an adulterous, luxurious, meddlesome, scheming, and spendthrift queen", overlooking {{her political}} achievements and influence.

[...] Karalio wrote: [...] "Isabeau was raised by the furies {{to bring about the}} ruin of the state and to sell it to its enemies; Isabeau of Bavaria appeared, and her marriage, celebrated in Amiens on July 17, 1385, would be regarded as the most horrifying moment in our history". Isabeau was painted as Orléans' passionate lover, and the inspiration for the Marquis de Sade's unpublished 1813 novel Histoire secrete d'Isabelle de Baviere, reine de France, about which Adams writes, [...] "submitting the queen to his ideology of gallantry, [...] gives her rapaciousness a cold and calculating violence... a woman who carefully manages her greed for maximum gratification."
