40|$|Slag wool is {{the most}} {{expensive}} and valuable product of blast furnace slag processing. Slag wool is in great demand nowadays. The article highlights the factors influencing the mineral wool quality: chemical composition that determines the acidity of the module, the temperature of the molten slag and the required slag jet thickness consistency. Mineral wool is produced by blowing air or steam into a jet of molten slag. As a result of it the <b>slag</b> <b>crushes</b> into droplets stretching. The resulting wool contains 5 % slag and 95 % air. The quality of the obtained slag wool depends on the module acidity of the slag. The blast furnace slags of «Ilyich iron and steel works of Mariupol» and «Azovstal iron & steel works» are the main (short) slags – they give short fibers. To obtain high-quality long fiber wool it is necessary to add admixtures into basic blast furnace slag to reduce its basicity. As a result of the fuel and energy rising prices and the necessity to reduce the slag wool cost it is necessary to develop a new technology with fiery-liquid slag, with the removal of iron compounds and sulphur from the melts and the introduction of corrective additives {{to improve the quality of}} slag wool.

40|$|Active slag {{filters are}} an {{emerging}} technology for removing phosphorus (P) from wastewater. Currently, the lifespan of these filters {{is limited by}} their available reactive sites. An increasing number of researchers suggest that drying active filters can renew their P removal capacity, although there has only been one research paper that has achieved regeneration. Hence, this study investigated techniques to regenerate the P removal efficiency of exhausted melter slag filter media which had successfully treated effluent for 5 years in the field before becoming inactive. Several techniques were performed to expose fresh surface sites on the slag, including: (1) drying; (2) agitation; and (3) <b>crushing</b> of the <b>slag</b> granules. <b>Crushing</b> resulted in the best regeneration of P removal efficiency by the slag, however, after just 2 months the renewed P removal efficiency of the <b>crushed</b> <b>slag</b> fell back to a similar level to that exhibited by exhausted slag. Furthermore, {{none of the other}} physical methods caused long-term rejuvenation of the exhausted slag to remove P from effluent. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that none of the regeneration techniques exposed substantial new phosphorus adsorption sites on the slag granules. These findings therefore challenge the validity of the existing dogma that active slag filters can be effectively regenerated by simple physical treatments, indicating further research is required to optimise active filter performance.

These materials are usually unbound granular (<b>crushed</b> stone, <b>crushed</b> <b>slag,</b> <b>crushed</b> concrete, slate) or cement-bound. Permeable Pavement Systems (PPS) have emerged over the years using various quality of subbase materials including large pieces of rocks and concrete. For {{the first time in}} the Caribbean, the design, construction and implementation of such pavement systems is being carried out. The novel pavement systems consist of permeable or pervious concrete paving blocks and the Carbon-Negative aggregates in the sub-base as an innovative and effective method of providing structural pavements, whilst allowing urban stormwater runoff to infiltrate naturally into the pavements (mimicking the hydrologic cycle) into the base/sub-base reservoir for urban runoff attenuation and an overall reduction in stormwater discharge. These pavement systems are being considered to reduce the overall carbon footprint on the construction and implementation phase of pavements, in addition to reducing surface water flooding in several towns and cities across these Caribbean Small Island Developing States (SIDS). The project includes ongoing experimental assessment of the Permeable Pavement Systems (PPS) using Carbon-Negative aggregates versus conventional pervious pavements from a water quality, structural integrity and hydraulic perspective.

40|$|Considerable {{quantities}} of iron-smelting slag {{are present in}} the bed of the Ardennian rivers. These waste products come from hundreds of ironworks (mainly blast furnaces and finery forges) built close to different-sized rivers between the 14 th and the 19 th centuries. In general, <b>slag</b> was <b>crushed</b> by hammers, sorted and piled up in heaps around the furnaces, generally onto the floodplains. Furthermore, some archives mention that they were sometimes thrown out directly into the rivers. This means that for centuries, slag elements have been swept away by floods, mixed with the sediment and spread out along river courses. Due to their distinctive appearance, slag particles are easily recognizable among the natural elements. Thanks to many historical studies conducted on the early iron industry, we are able to date quite precisely the inception and the periods of activity of the different sites established in the catchments. These data are indispensable in order to use slag as a tracer to quantify the particles’ velocity in rivers. Downstream of ironworks, samples of sand have been collected in the surface layer of many gravel-bed rivers. Then, the slag concentration of each sample has been measured in the coarse sand fraction. The representation of the longitudinal evolution of slag concentration in these rivers permits the dispersion of slag to be analysed, the relative bed-material discharges at confluences to be quantified and the velocity of coarse sand to be determined. A survey of the bedload discharge in the Ardennian rivers established that more than 90 % of the bedload transport consists of coarse sand grains that are transported {{on the bottom of the}} bed. However, in the literature, this grain-size fraction is generally not considered in bedload discharge estimations because the sandy particles are very difficult to tag and to recover. Consequently, the huge amounts of slag injected in rivers several centuries ago can be considered as a very useful opportunity to characterise the sand transport in gravel-bed rivers.

ASR expansion of the mortar are found to be below 0. 1 % at 14 days tested age, except the mortar with GGBFS and 75 % n-TFG glass sand. The lead leaching from mortar with n-TFG glass sand was reduced comparing the content of the leachable lead from n-TFG glass sand. Moreover, at a given replacement level of n-TFG glass sand, FA series mortar has better fresh properties, a lower wet density, mechanical properties, drying shrinkage, ASR expansion and the leaching of lead than GGBFS series mortar.

40|$|In this paper, it was {{evaluated}} {{the performance of}} concrete with <b>crushed</b> <b>slag</b> of cupola furnace (SCF) as sand replacement in percentages of 0  %, 10  %, 15  % and 20  %, subjected to accelerated chemical attacks of carbonation, sulfation and alkali-aggregate reaction (AAR). The sound absorption characteristics of the material were determined through the sound absorption coefficient (α), and the noise reduction coefficient (NRC). Carbonation {{was evaluated}} through a closed camera with the 70  % concentration {{of carbon dioxide and}} conditions of relative humidity between 50  % and 70  %. The results indicated that the penetration depth of CO 2 is lower when greater the percentage of substitution is. To accelerate the attack by sulfates, specimens were immersed in aqueous solution of sodium sulfate anhydrous (Na 2 SO 4) 1 N with cycles of wetting and drying. It determined that the impairment presented in concrete paste is directly proportional to the percentage of sand replacement. The acceleration of the AAR in the concrete was carried out by immersing specimens in an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) for 16 days. The test concluded that the inclusion of SCF is not favorable for AAR. The measurement of sound absorption coefficient was taken by the method of impedance tube, relating minimum and maximum values of stationary wave amplitude. The results showed that SCF with higher sand replacement are favorable for the noise absorption in buildings. </p...|$|R
40|$|The report {{includes}} a literature study concerning steel slag as aggregate for asphalt mixtures. Environmental aspects and relevant test methods {{for use of}} steel slag have been highlighted in this work. A study tour {{has been made to}} south-west Götaland, Sweden, and to Denmark, where steel slag has been used for bituminous pavements for many years. Furthermore, test sections performed later at Dalarna are presented, too. In connection with steel production slag is produced as a by-product. Steel slag is used in many countries as bound or unbound layers in road construction. This report deals with slag from steel production in Smedjebacken, so called EAF slag (Electric Arc Furnace slag, sometimes called LB slag) used as aggregate in bituminous pavements. There are positive experiences from Halmstad and Laholm where EAF slag has been used as wear course on densely trafficked roads and streets since the beginning of 1990 s. In Denmark, EAF slag from, for instance, steel production in Smedjebacken is frequently used in roundabouts and on densely trafficked roads and streets. The slag from Smedjebacken has good mechanical properties. The <b>slag</b> becomes, after <b>crushing</b> in several stages, cubical, but retains at the same time its rough surface by way of porosity. This gives the bituminous pavement very good stability. As the slag contains a suitable amount of unbound lime (< 0, 5 %) the durability against water is very good. In order to eliminate the risk of swelling, the slag is stored outdoors for about one year...|$|R
40|$|Experiments {{have been}} {{performed}} in a facility designed for steady state heat transfer through coal ash deposits obtained from utility boilers. A one-dimensional heat flux through the ash deposits was achieved by subjecting one surface to intense irradiation from SiC electrodes and the other surface to allow temperature heat sink. Temperature profiles and 2 ̆ 2 effective 2 ̆ 2 thermal conductivities (k(,e)), which account for both conduction and radiation heat transfer, were measured {{over a wide range}} of temperatures. Heat fluxes were measured calorimetrically. The test facility, experimental methods, and experimental results are discussed. ^ Flyash, <b>crushed</b> <b>slag</b> and fouling deposits, and solid fouling deposits were studied, with hot surface temperatures ranging from 425 to 1420 (DEGREES) C and surface irradiation from 23 to 500 kW m(2 ̆ 7 - 2). Thermal conductivities were low, typically less than 0. 5 W m(2 ̆ 7 - 1) K(2 ̆ 7 - 1) at temperatures below the sintering and fusion regimes. Particle sintering and melting had considerable effect on temperature profiles and thermal conductivities. Samples which underwent partical melting experienced irreversible changes, with k(,e) increasing as much as tenfold. ^ The coupled problems of coal ash deposition onto relatively cool boiler wall steam tubes, the resulting deposit layer growth, and heat transfer through the deposit were modeled numerically. Temperature dependence of slag viscosity, thermal conductivity, density, and ash deposition flux were accounted for. Viscosities were calculated from the correlation of Capps (1977), and results from the experimental program were used to model k(,e) (T) for Southern Indiana coal slag. A simplified ash deposition model was developed for the case of thermophoretically-controlled deposition. ^ Results of a parametric study, in which the effects of ash deposit properties and operating conditions were examined, are presented in dimensionless form. Ash deposition flux, chemical composition, thermal conductivity, surface emissivity, and flame temperature were found to have the greatest effect on heat transfer rates. Variations in ash deposit density, critical viscosity, and tube wall temperature were of secondary importance. Correlations of numerical results for steady state heat flux {{as a function of the}} ash silica ratio, and for steady state ash deposit thickness as a function of silica ratio and thermal conductivity, are presented. ...|$|R
