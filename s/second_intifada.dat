A statistical analysis of the Christian exodus cited lack of economic and educational opportunity, especially due to the Christians' middle-class status and higher education. Since the <b>Second</b> <b>Intifada,</b> 10% of the Christian population have left the city.|$|E

5|$|In 2000, the <b>Second</b> <b>Intifada</b> (also called al-Aqsa Intifada) began, and Israel built a {{separation}} barrier.

5|$|Persistent {{attempts}} by the Israeli government to identify another Palestinian leader to represent the Palestinian people failed. Arafat was enjoying the support of groups that, given his own history, would normally have been quite wary of dealing with or supporting him. Marwan Barghouti (a leader of al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades) emerged as a possible replacement during the <b>Second</b> <b>Intifada,</b> but Israel had him arrested for allegedly {{being involved in the}} killing of twenty-six civilians, and he was sentenced to five life terms.|$|E

Starting with {{the first wave of}} Jewish immigration into Palestine in the 1880 s the book examines the key moments in the conflict's history including the Sykes-Picot agreement and the Balfour Declaration, the 1930 s Arab revolts, the wars of 1948, 1956 1967, 1973 and 1982, the rise of the messianic Judaism and the settlement movement, the first and <b>second</b> <b>intifadas</b> and the Oslo peace process.

In 1967, Bani Zeid was occupied by Israel during the Six-Day War, but it was transferred to full Palestinian security and administrative control in 2000. The next year it became the first Palestinian-controlled town to be the site of major operation by Israeli forces during the <b>Second</b> <b>Intifada.</b> When Fathiya Barghouti Rheime was elected mayor in 2005, Bani Zeid became the first Palestinian locality with a woman as head of the municipality, in concurrence with nearby Ramallah.

5|$|The Waqf Ministry of Jordan held {{control of}} the al-Aqsa Mosque until the 1967 Six-Day War.

However, Israeli Security Forces are permitted to patrol and conduct searches within the perimeter of the mosque. After the 1969 arson attack, the waqf employed architects, technicians and craftsmen in a committee that carry out regular maintenance operations. The Islamic Movement in Israel and the waqf have attempted to increase Muslim control of the Temple Mount as a way of countering Israeli policies and the escalating presence of Israeli security forces around the site since the <b>Second</b> <b>Intifada.</b> Some activities included refurbishing abandoned structures and renovating.|$|E

5|$|The {{economical}} situation Tubas {{during the}} 199399 period was prosperous, however {{since the start}} of the <b>Second</b> <b>Intifada</b> in 200001, Tubas' income level has decreased by roughly 40%. Prior to the Intifada, the average household income was 2,500 NIS, receding to about 1,500 NIS. A major factor that has resulted from the conflict was the confiscation of agricultural land located within the city's or its governorate's jurisdiction by Israeli settlements or military authorities. According to the PCBS, in 1999, approximately 52% of the citizens were within the working age (15-64). Of the city's labor force, 48% are females. The unemployment rate increased dramatically from 20% in 1999 to 70% after the year 2000. Prior to the Intifada, 35% of the total labor force worked in Israel.|$|E

During the Second Lebanon War the Hammers flew 1,400 sorties, totalling 2,300 flying hours, {{more than any}} other IAF combat unit. During this conflict, the Ra'am's long range and endurance served it well in the close support role, as the aircraft could carry more munitions and remain on station longer than any other strike aircraft. It is these capabilities that place 69 Squadron at the forefront of Israel's strategic arm, and it is thus this unit that is reputed to have undertaken Operation Orchard, the destruction of a Syrian nuclear site on September 6, 2007. The squadron has also been linked to a possible Israeli strike against the Iranian nuclear program.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} night hours of 24 October 2001, during the <b>Second</b> <b>Intifada,</b> the Israeli Army (IDF) {{launched}} an incursion into Beit Rima in {{what became the}} first major Israeli military raid into Palestinian-controlled territory, according to Human Rights Watch (HRW). The IDF stated {{the intent of the}} raid was to capture the alleged killers of Israeli Tourism Minister Rehavam Ze'evi, who was shot dead by members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) in retaliation for Israel's assassination of the party's leader Mustafa Zibri (Abu Ali Mustafa) in August. About 50 people from Beit Rima were detained and brought to the Israeli settlement of Halamish for interrogation. Most were released before the day's end, but eleven men remained in Israeli custody, two of whom Israel alleged to be directly involved in Ze'evi's assassination. In the course of the raid, Israeli forces killed six Palestinians, including three members of the Palestinian National Security Forces and two officers from the Civil Police, and wounded seven others. The Palestinian authorities in Beit Rima stated they had not received prior warning from the IDF and their slain men had been resting in an olive grove near the local police station, while Israeli military officials stated all those killed had either fired on Israeli forces or approached them threateningly and all were members of various armed groups. The HRW stated that the Red Crescent was prevented from treating the injured men until 7:00 am, a delay that resulted in the death of two of the police officers. Israeli forces also demolished three homes in the town, alleging that they belonged to family members of Ze'evi's killers.|$|E
50|$|Jesus' {{traditional}} baptism {{site has}} attracted pilgrims throughout history. During {{the last four}} decades pilgrimage facilities have been created at three different sites. With Al Maghtas Jordan has the historically oldest site, with archaeological finds from the earliest periods of Christian worship. Across the river, on the West Bank side, Qasr el Yahud has its own medieval traditions. Both sites were off-limits between 1967 and the 2000s, first due to the conflict between Israel and Jordan and then due to the Palestinian First and <b>Second</b> <b>Intifadas,</b> but have been reopened in 2000 and 2010-2011 respectively. A new alternative site was opened in 1981 further up north on the Israeli side, at Yardenit.|$|R
5000|$|The concept intifada {{was first}} {{utilized}} {{in modern times}} in 1952 within the Kingdom of Iraq, when socialist and communist parties {{took to the streets}} to protest the Hashemite monarchy, with inspiration of the 1952 Egyptian Revolution. In the Palestinian context, with which it is particularly associated, the word refers to attempts to [...] "shake off" [...] the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the First and <b>Second</b> <b>Intifadas,</b> where it was originally chosen to connote [...] "aggressive nonviolent resistance", a meaning it bore among Palestinian students in struggles in the 1980s and which they adopted as less confrontational than terms in earlier militant rhetoric since it bore no nuance of violence.|$|R
50|$|The nonviolent {{campaign}} of <b>Second</b> Sahrawi <b>Intifada</b> campaigned more openly {{on the issue}} of independence than had the First Intifada, which focused mostly on human rights; however, the First Intifada was pivotal in showing Sahrawis that they could dissent, protest, and state their demands.|$|R

According to Juliana Ochs, Sharon's visit 'symbolically instigated' the <b>second</b> <b>intifada.</b> Marwan Barghouti said that although Sharon's provocative actions were a rallying point for Palestinians, the <b>Second</b> <b>Intifada</b> would have erupted even had he not visited the Temple Mount.|$|E
25|$|After {{the signing}} of the Oslo Accords failed to bring about a Palestinian state, in September 2000 the <b>Second</b> <b>Intifada</b> (uprising) broke out, a period of {{intensified}} Palestinian–Israeli violence, which has been taking place until the present day. The <b>Second</b> <b>Intifada</b> has caused thousands of victims on both sides, both among combatants and among civilians, and has been more deadly than the first Intifada. Many Palestinians consider the <b>Second</b> <b>Intifada</b> to be a legitimate war of national liberation against foreign occupation, whereas many Israelis consider it to be a terrorist campaign.|$|E
