2500|$|After Cumia {{made several}} more {{appearances}} on Hughes's show, the two entered discussions {{to become a}} full-time radio team.

Before they left WBAB, the station offered Cumia to take over Hughes's night shift, which the two later saw as [...] "a <b>scumbag</b> move" [...] as their bits were being played on the morning show without their permission. Hughes was cautious about moving as he felt unsure if the show's success would translate to a new radio market. Cumia ended his manual labor job, and threw his tools out of his car window while driving in hope of never returning to it.|$|E
