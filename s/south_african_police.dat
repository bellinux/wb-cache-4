5|$|Under {{pressure}} from Pretoria {{to accept the}} terms, the Rhodesians agreed on 11 December 1974 and followed {{the terms of the}} ceasefire; Rhodesian military actions were temporarily halted and troops were ordered to allow retreating guerrillas to leave unhindered. Vorster withdrew some 2,000 members of the <b>South</b> <b>African</b> <b>Police</b> (SAP) from forward bases in Rhodesia, and by August 1975 had pulled the SAP out of Rhodesia completely. The nationalists used the sudden cessation of security force activity as an opportunity to regroup and re-establish themselves {{both inside and outside the}} country. Guerrilla operations continued: an average of six incidents a day were reported inside Rhodesia over the following months. Far from being seen as a gesture of potential reconciliation, the ceasefire and release of the nationalist leaders gave the message to the rural population that the security forces had been defeated and that the guerrillas were in the process of emulating FRELIMO's victory in Mozambique. The d√©tente terms led to the Victoria Falls Conference of August 1975, which collapsed after nine-and-a-half hours, each side blaming the other for the break-up.|$|E

25|$|In South African waters, the wrecks {{of ships}} or aircraft, and any {{associated}} cargo, debris or artifact more than 60 {{years old and}} are protected by the National Heritage Resources Act number 25 of 1999 (NHRA).

There are severe penalties for contravening the Act, including heavy fines and jail terms. All members of the <b>South</b> <b>African</b> <b>Police</b> Services, and Customs and Excise officers may act as Heritage Inspectors in terms of the Act, with powers of search, confiscation and arrest.

25|$|Technical Rescue {{services}} {{is for the}} most part provided by the local Fire Service of each municipality. However, due to the reduction in service, much of this has been taken over by volunteer organisations. Nationally, mountain rescue (Berg) is carried out by the Mountain Club of South Africa (MCSA), who work alongside the South African Air Force since the high altitude dictates the use of military specification helicopters. In the Western Cape, technical rescue mostly confined to the Cape Metro is carried out by Wilderness Search and Rescue, who work in conjunction with Cape Metro Ambulance and Red Cross Air Mercy Service. In Kwa Zulu Natal, Rescuetech carries out the technical rescue needs in the province in conjunction with the <b>South</b> <b>African</b> <b>Police</b> Service Search and Rescue Division.

500|$|A {{few months}} after the release of [...] "Mannenberg", <b>South</b> <b>African</b> <b>police</b> fired upon protesting {{children}} during the June 1976 Soweto Uprising; this event led Ibrahim and Benjamin to publicly express support for the African National Congress, which was still banned at the time. The piece became identified with the movement against apartheid in the 1980s, partly due to Coetzee and Jansen playing it at a number of protests and rallies against the apartheid government. Jansen would accompany many of these performances with speeches about being proud of ones' own culture, and of [...] "rising up" [...] to challenge apartheid. Fragments of the piece were used as the tune to lyrics that expressed anger and resistance to the apartheid government. It was variously described as the [...] "most powerful anthem of the struggle in the 1980s", the [...] "unofficial national anthem" [...] of South Africa, and [...] "a beloved anthem of hope and resistance for many South Africans".|$|E
50|$|Operation Merlyn (aka The Nine Day War) was a {{military}} operation by the <b>South</b> <b>African</b> Defence Force (SADF), <b>South</b> West <b>African</b> Territorial Force (SWATF) and <b>South</b> West <b>African</b> <b>Police</b> (SWAPOL) during the <b>South</b> <b>African</b> Border War and Angolan Civil War in April 1989. The aim of the operation was to prevent the incursion of PLAN (SWAPO) insurgents into South West Africa/Namibia from bases in Angola. These incursions were in violation of a ceasefire which came into effect on 1 April 1989 via the implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 435 and the Tripartite Accord. Initially these PLAN incursions were tackled by <b>South</b> West <b>African</b> <b>police</b> units and eventually by SADF and SWATF units, released to assist the police having been confined to their bases by the peace agreements. These incursions and the conflict that resulted, ended after hastily arranged talks resulted in the Mount Etjo Declaration and an eventual ceasefire.|$|R
