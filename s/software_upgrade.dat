40|$|Abstract — The {{goal of the}} guarded <b>software</b> <b>upgrading</b> (GSU) {{framework}} is to minimize mission performance loss due to onboard <b>software</b> <b>upgrading</b> activities and that due to system failure caused by residual faults in an upgraded version. We exploit inherent system resource redundancies as the means of fault tolerance to meet the development cost and onboard resource constraints. Furthermore, we devise a message-driven confidence-driven protocol t...|$|R
40|$|We {{present in}} this paper an {{extension}} of the messagedriven confidence-driven framework that we developed for onboard guarded <b>software</b> <b>upgrading.</b> The purpose of this work is to provide the framework with the capability of protecting distributed <b>software</b> <b>upgrades</b> that involve messagepassing interface changes. To achieve this goal, we propose an approach to clustering the components involved in <b>software</b> <b>upgrades</b> and those involved in message-passing interface changes, such that from outside the cluster all those components can be perceived collectively as one virtual low-confidence component. Moreover, we develop a confidence-driven mechanism that enables combined use of sender- and receiver-side message logging for efficient, fine-grained error containment and recovery. The paper provides a detailed algorithm description...|$|R

25|$|Since 2009 {{there have}} been {{widespread}} concerns from Chinese consumers particularly among the online community, who expressed that Volkswagen has {{failed to respond to}} complaints about defects in its DSG-equipped vehicles. Typical issues associated with 6-speed DSG include abnormal noise and inability to change gear; while issues associated with 7-speed DSG include abnormal noise, excessive shift shock, abnormal increase in engine RPM, flashing gear indicator on the dashboard as well as inability to shift to even-numbered gears. In March 2012 China’s quality watchdog the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ) said that it had been in contact with Volkswagen (China) and urged the carmaker to probe the issues. In a survey held by Gasgoo.com (China) of 2,937 industry experts and insiders, 83% of respondents believed that the carmaker should consider a full vehicle recall. In March 2012 Volkswagen Group China admitted that there could be an issue in its seven-speed DSG gearboxes that may affect approximately 500,000 vehicles from its various subsidiaries in China. A <b>software</b> <b>upgrade</b> has since been offered for the affected vehicles in an attempt to repair the problem.|$|E
