40|$|Since the mid- 1970 s, the United States has {{experienced}} an enormous rise in incarceration and accompanying increases in returning prisoners and in postrelease community correctional supervision. Poor urban communities are disproportionately impacted by these phenomena. This review focuses on two complementary questions regarding incarceration, prisoner reentry, and communities: (a) {{whether and how}} mass incarceration has affected {{the social and economic}} structure of American communities, and (b) how residential neighborhoods affect the <b>social</b> and economic <b>reintegration</b> of returning prisoners. These two questions can be seen as part of a dynamic process involving a pernicious feedback loop in which mass incarceration undermines the structure and social organization of some communities, thus creating more criminogenic environments for returning prisoners and further diminishing their prospects for successful reentry and reintegration. © Copyright © 2014 by Annual Reviews.

40|$|Since {{the early}} 1990 ’s, the Great Lakes Region (GLR) has been devastated {{by a wave}} of {{interconnected}} interstate, intrastate, and local conflicts involving {{hundreds of thousands of}} soldiers in dozens of armed groups. An important part of the international community’s approach to peacebuilding in the region has involved the disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) of armed groups. Because of the transnational nature of many armed groups in the GLR, a regional approach to DDR has been adopted. The World Banks Multi-Country Reintegration Program (MDRP) and Transitional Demobilization and Reintegration Program (TDRP) have been key institutions involved in facilitating national efforts for the demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants across the region. While DDR has evolved considerably since 1990 ’s, the reintegration component remains among the cruxes. One reason for the enduring challenge of reintegration is that while technical approaches to the delivery of reintegration programming have become ever more refined, the nature of the <b>social</b> and economic <b>reintegration</b> processes that reintegration programs aim to affect in individual ex-combatants have remained largely unproblematized. The mixed track record of DDR programs in the GLR, and around the world, speaks to the idea that without a deep understanding of the endogenous social and economic processes of reintegration, reintegration programs might risk becoming detached from the outcomes they mean to affect. Through the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of reintegration programming in the GLR, the TDRP has collected vast amounts of social and economic survey data on ex-combatants and community members. Previously, this data has been used to evaluate the extent of reintegration programming impacts in specific country contexts. However, in 2013 the TDRP merged a series of survey datasets that include the experiences of nearly 10, 000 ex-combatants and community members from across five GLR countries (Rwanda, Uganda, Burundi, DRC, and RoC) captured between 2010 and 2012. The merged TDRP-GLR Reintegration Dataset opens the door to the systematic comparative analysis of the <b>social</b> and economic <b>reintegration</b> processes that individual ex-combatants navigate across GLR. In examining the social and economic processes through which individual ex-combatants across the GLR reintegrate, this doctoral thesis explores numerous issues. We investigate the deep set of social and economic disadvantages that ex-combatants carry with them as they attempt to reintegrate, {{and the ways in which}} disadvantages can influence the economic livelihood strategies that ex-combatants pursue as a part of reintegration. In turn, we reflect on the relationship of economic processes to a slower moving set of social processes that revolve around negotiating identity and building social networks. Further, we consider the profound role of gender in shaping individual ex-combatants’ <b>social</b> and economic <b>reintegration</b> experiences. Based on this set of insights about some of the underlying social and economic processes that ex-combatants across the GLR navigate during reintegration, we move to reflect more broadly about the direct implications for our understanding of the potential role of reintegration programming in shaping post-conflict societies, and how we understand the successes and failures of reintegration programming through M&E...|$|R

Our research aims at studying {{the evolution of the}} psychological processes and quality of life of individuals admitted in the UEROS-AQUITAINE long-term care in order to improve the understanding of the impact of participating in this program on <b>social</b> and professional <b>reintegration.</b> The objective of the current study, which constitutes a preliminary work of feasibility, is to compare subjects who participated in the neuropsychological section to subjects who participated in the professional section. MethodsTwo groups were established: a group met upon admission in the UEROS, in the neuropsychological section (PN, n= 6) and a group met in the professional section (PP, n= 9). The subjects completed generic scales relative to self-esteem, self-efficacy, depression, coping and a specific scale of quality of life in brain injury patients (QOLIBRI), at two time-points with a 3 -month interval. A mixed factorial ANOVA was used to compare values obtained by the groups at the 2 evaluation times. ResultsThere {{were no significant differences between}} PP and PN for self-esteem, self-efficacy and depression. However, PP presented a significant decrease in the “Degree of bothered” concerning quality of life, feelings and physical condition compared to PN. Among the strategies of coping, only the Research for instrumental social support was significantly more used by PP than by PN. DiscussionThe construction of an adequate project allows an improvement in certain dimensions of quality of life and encourages functional coping. By the latter, centred on the problem, the subjects appear to seize the support of the multidisciplinary team. This investment could also allow moving away from the pain, to overcome clumsiness and sensory difficulties, becoming then “less annoying”.
