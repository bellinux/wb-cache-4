5|$|After 12:17UTC, the tornado's {{position}} fluctuated between Benton and Washington {{counties in}} northwestern Arkansas. Permanent houses were damaged and mobile homes were destroyed. Numerous trees were uprooted or <b>snapped</b> while many other power poles were <b>snapped.</b> Two {{people were injured}} following {{the destruction of a}} mobile home within the Ozark National Forest in Benton County, while another person was injured west of Tontitown, Arkansas in Washington County. The tornado finally dissipated northwest of Tontitown at 12:27UTC after causing four deaths and ten injuries. Overall, the tornado caused $1.835million in damage, which was the sixth costliest total during the tornado outbreak.|$|E

40|$|Human U 6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) gene {{transcription}} by RNA polymerase III requires cooperative promoter binding involving the snRNA-activating protein complex (<b>SNAP</b> c) and the TATA-box binding protein (TBP).

40|$|Part 1 : Long and Short PapersInternational audienceWe {{introduce}} a new <b>snapping</b> technique, Oh <b>Snap,</b> designed specifically for users of direct touch interfaces. Oh <b>Snap</b> allows users to easily align digital objects with lines or other objects using 1 -D or 2 -D translation or rotation. Our technique addresses two major drawbacks of existing <b>snapping</b> techniques: they either cause objects to “jump” to <b>snap</b> locations, preventing placement very close to those locations, or they “expand” motor space so that on direct-touch interfaces objects lag behind the user’s finger. Oh <b>Snap</b> addresses both of these problems using an asymmetric velocity profile similar to a technique for filtering degrees of freedom in multi-touch gestures that was introduced by Nacenta et al. (2009). Oh <b>Snap</b> applies the velocity profile to multiple “snapping” constraints. A user study revealed a 40 % performance improvement over no <b>snapping</b> for 1 -D translation, 2 -D translation, and rotation tasks when <b>snap</b> lines or angles were targeted. We found that Oh <b>Snap</b> performs no worse than traditional <b>snapping,</b> while retaining its important functional benefits. The study also investigated optimal parameter settings and Oh <b>Snap’s</b> accuracy in supporting the placement of objects near to, but not at, <b>snap</b> locations, which traditional <b>snapping</b> techniques do not support. Oh <b>Snap</b> {{was found to be}} competitive with non-snapping interfaces for these tasks...|$|R

5|$|At West Palm Beach, the {{majority}} of the damage was confined to vegetation. Several coconut and royal palms that withstood the 1928 hurricane <b>snapped,</b> littering streets with broken trunks. Winds downed road signs on many streets, and floodwaters covered the greens on a local golf course. Some garages and isolated structures, mostly lightweight, were partly or totally destroyed, along with a lumber warehouse. Some homes that lost roofing shingles had water damage to their interiors as well. Nearby Lake Worth sustained extensive breakage of windows, including plate glass, and loss of tile and shingle roofing, but preparations reduced losses to just several thousand dollars, and no post-storm accidents took place. Strong winds <b>snapped</b> many light poles in the city, and trees and shrubs were broken or uprooted. As in Lake Worth, officials in West Palm Beach credited preparations and stringent building codes with reducing overall damage. The city had learned from previous experience with severe storms in 1926, 1928, and 1929. High tides eroded Ocean Boulevard at several spots and disrupted access to several bridges on the Lake Worth Lagoon. Winter estates and hotels on Palm Beach generally sustained little material damage, except to vegetation, and county properties went largely unscathed.|$|E

When north of the Azores in a strong storm, the tow line <b>snapped.</b> Though multiple searches were mounted by American and British aircraft, the ship was never found.

40|$|Human small nuclear RNA gene {{transcription}} by RNA polymerases II and III depends upon promoter recognition by the <b>SNAP</b> C general transcription factor.

The <b>SNAP</b> 50 zinc finger domain contains 15 cysteine and histidine residues configured in two potential zinc coordination arrangements. Individual alanine substitution of each cysteine and histidine residue demonstrated that eight sites are important for DNA binding by <b>SNAP</b> C.

A prospective observational study was conducted in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of Kanti Children's Hospital in Kathmandu, Nepal. Data required for the <b>SNAP</b> II and <b>SNAP</b> II PE scores were collected. The relationships between the <b>SNAP</b> II and <b>SNAP</b> II PE scores and neonatal mortality were analyzed. There were 135 neonates admitted during the 6 month study period, of whom 126 met the inclusion criteria. Of these 126 neonates, 29 (23. 0 %) died. Mortality was 83 % (5 / 6) when <b>SNAP</b> II was > 40, and 66. 7 % (6 / 9) when <b>SNAP</b> II PE was > 50. A <b>SNAP</b> II score of ≥ 12 had a sensitivity of 75. 9 %, and specificity of 73. 2 % for predicting mortality, and a <b>SNAP</b> II PE score of ≥ 14 had a sensitivity of 82. 8 % and specificity of 67. 0 % for it. <b>SNAP</b> II and <b>SNAP</b> II PE scoring of neonates can be used to predict prognosis of neonates in resource-limited NICUs in Nepal...|$|R
5|$|Category4 hurricanes tend {{to produce}} more {{extensive}} curtainwall failures, with some complete structural failure on small residences. Heavy, irreparable damage and near complete destruction of gas station canopies and other wide span overhang type structures are common. Mobile and manufactured homes are often flattened.

40|$|<b>SNAP</b> 25 {{plays an}} {{essential}} role in neuronal exocytosis pathways. <b>SNAP</b> 25 a and <b>SNAP</b> 25 b are alternatively spliced isoforms differing by only nine amino acids, three of which occur within the palmitoylated cysteine-rich domain. <b>SNAP</b> 23 is 60 % identical to <b>SNAP</b> 25 and has a distinct cysteine-rich domain to both <b>SNAP</b> 25 a and <b>SNAP</b> 25 b. Despite the conspicuous differences within the palmitoylated domains of these secretory proteins, there is no information on their comparative interactions with palmitoyl transferases. We report that membrane association of all <b>SNAP</b> 25 / 23 proteins is enhanced by Golgi-localized DHHC 3, DHHC 7, and DHHC 17. In contrast, DHHC 15 promoted a statistically significant increase in membrane association of only <b>SNAP</b> 25 b. To investigate the underlying cause of this differential specificity, we examined a <b>SNAP</b> 23 point mutant (C 79 F) designed to mimic the cysteine-rich domain of <b>SNAP</b> 25 b. DHHC 15 promoted a marked increase in membrane binding and palmitoylation of this <b>SNAP</b> 23 mutant, demonstrating that the distinct cysteine-rich domains of <b>SNAP</b> 25 / 23 contribute to differential interactions with DHHC 15. The lack of activity of DHHC 15 toward wild-type <b>SNAP</b> 23 was not overcome by replacing its DHHC domain with that from DHHC 3, suggesting that substrate specificity is not determined by the DHHC domain alone. Interestingly, DHHC 2, which is closely related to DHHC 15, associates with the plasma membrane in PC 12 cells and can palmitoylate all <b>SNAP</b> 25 isoforms. DHHC 2 is, thus, a candidate enzyme to regulate <b>SNAP</b> 25 / 23 palmitoylation dynamics at the plasma membrane. Finally, we demonstrate that overexpression of specific Golgi-localized DHHC proteins active against <b>SNAP</b> 25 / 23 proteins perturbs the normal secretion of human growth hormone from PC 12 cells...|$|R
