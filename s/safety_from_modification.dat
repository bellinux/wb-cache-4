40|$|Continual {{advances}} in technology, along with increased cockpit workload particularly {{the shift from}} two-seat to single-seat fighters to save money and reduce risk to lifepush the limits of human mental capacity. Additionally, there is interest within the military aviation community to integrate Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) control into the cockpit in order to expand force projection capability. This study compared the effects on formation flight performance of two different secondary tasks, specifically a traditional secondary task such as target prosecution with an electro-optical Forward Looking Infra-Red (FLIR) pod, and a futuristic secondary task such as UAV supervisory control. A total of 34 military fighter aviators volunteered to fly three five-minuteF- 18 simulator sessions in close formation with no secondary task, and then treated {{with each of the}} two secondary tasks. Results provided clear indication that the futuristic task was significantly more challenging than the traditional task, and that both secondary tasks significantly increased the average mean following distance and variance compared to the undistracted flying baseline scenario. Additionally, we found no evidence that increased flight experience (total flight hours) significantly improved performance of the prescribed primary task when treated with the futuristic task distraction. Knowledge gained from the results could contribute to improved crew resource management (CRM) and pilot workload management as well as flight <b>safety</b> resulting <b>from</b> the <b>modification</b> of flight procedures based on known effects of distractions in the cockpit.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the connection between}} the built environment, perceived <b>safety</b> <b>from</b> crime and walking behaviour by conducting a travel survey in King County, Washington State, U. S. and employing a two-stage least squares model. We seek to answer two research questions: how does the built environment affect perceived <b>safety</b> <b>from</b> crime and walking behaviour; and how does one’s perception of <b>safety</b> <b>from</b> crime affect his/her walking behaviour. Our results show that the built environment is not only significantly related to walking behaviour, as previous research has identified, but also correlated with people’s perception of safety. In addition, a significant association between perceived <b>safety</b> <b>from</b> crime and walking behaviour is found, revealing possible indirect impacts of the built environment on walking. In specific, people living in neighborhoods with good accessibility and pedestrian facilities tend to perceive their neighborhoods safer while density has an opposite impact. Moreover, residents in safe and high-density areas are more likely to walk...|$|R

A gap in current research was identified concerning whether the employee 2 ̆ 7 s sex affects employee 2 ̆ 7 s perceived workplace sexual harassment climate, sexual harassment experience, and perceived <b>safety</b> <b>from</b> sexual harassment. This study {{examined the effects of}} employee workplace sexual harassment experience and perception of workplace sexual harassment psychological climate on employee 2 ̆ 7 s perceived <b>safety</b> <b>from</b> sexual harassment moderated by sex. Results showed that perceived workplace sexual harassment climate and employee workplace sexual harassment experience were both significant predictors of perceived <b>safety</b> <b>from</b> sexual harassment. Additionally, the findings revealed that for both men and women, high intolerance for sexual harassment and low employee sexual harassment experience were significantly associated with increased perceived <b>safety</b> <b>from</b> sexual harassment. When perceived workplace sexual harassment climate and employee sexual harassment experience were observed together, only perceived workplace sexual harassment climate was associated with increased perceived <b>safety</b> <b>from</b> sexual harassment. Further research into diverse populations and anti-harassment programming 2 ̆ 7 s impact on perceived safety may provide further insights. The findings from this study could assist decision-makers in organizations to promote better physical, psychological, and emotional security in the workplace.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundNeighborhood {{safety is}} inconsistently related to {{physical}} activity, but is seldom studied in developing countries. This study examined associations between perceived neighborhood safety {{and physical activity}} among Nigerian adults. MethodsIn a cross-sectional study, accelerometer-based physical activity (MVPA), reported walking, perceived crime and traffic safety were measured in 219 Nigerian adults. Logistic regression analysis was conducted, and the odds ratio for meeting health guidelines for MVPA and walking was calculated in relation to four safety variables, after adjustment for potential confounders. ResultsSufficient MVPA was related to more perception of <b>safety</b> <b>from</b> traffic to walk (OR= 2. 28, CI= 1. 13 - 6. 25) and more <b>safety</b> <b>from</b> crime at night (OR= 1. 68, CI= 1. 07 - 3. 64), but with less perception of <b>safety</b> <b>from</b> crime during the day to walk (OR= 0. 34, CI= 0. 06 - 0. 91). More crime safety {{during the day and}} night were associated with more walking. ConclusionsPerceived <b>safety</b> <b>from</b> crime and traffic were associated with physical activity among Nigerian adults. These findings provide preliminary evidence on the need to provide safe traffic and crime environments that will make it easier and more likely for African adults to be physically active...|$|R
