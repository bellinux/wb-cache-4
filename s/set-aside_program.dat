5000|$|In the United States, the Acreage Reduction Program (ARP) is a no-longer-authorized annual {{cropland}} retirement {{program for}} wheat, feed grains, cotton, or rice in which farmers {{participating in the}} commodity programs (in order {{to be eligible for}} nonrecourse loans and deficiency payments) were mandated to idle a crop-specific, nationally-set portion of their base acreage during years of surplus. The idled acreage (called the acreage conservation reserve) was devoted to a conserving use. The goal was to reduce supplies, thereby raising market prices. Additionally, idled acres did not earn deficiency payments, thus reducing commodity program costs. ARP was criticized for diminishing the U.S. competitive position in export markets. The 1996 farm bill (P.L. 104-127) did not reauthorize ARPs. ARP differed from a <b>set-aside</b> <b>program</b> in that under a <b>set-aside</b> <b>program</b> reductions were based upon current year plantings, and did not require farmers to reduce their plantings of a specific crop.|$|E

40|$|Since WWII, {{the federal}} {{government}} has {{played a significant role in}} funding basic and applied research at universities. During the initial growth of research funding, the issues surrounding which universities would be the recip-ients of federal funding were not addressed by the government. As such, by the late 1970 s, a majority of research funding was concentrated in a few universi-ties located within a few states. This article examines two politically motivated methods used since 1980 to affect the distribution of funding on research activi-ties, namely, congressional earmarks and <b>set-aside</b> <b>programs.</b> The results sug-gest that there has been a modest change in the distribution of research funding across research and doctoral universities, especially since 1990.

However, {{as a result of the}} current controversy over the proper role of affirmative action and the recent Supreme Court's landmark decision in the Adarand Constructors, Inc. v.

40|$|Public {{procurement}} {{can be used}} {{to achieve}} goals other than purely economic ones. Such goals are often referred to as “social linkages”. A preference for social considerations has been gaining ground against the dominant best value for money (BVM) paradigm over the past few decades. In the past, public procurement policies followed the principle of non-discrimination and free competition beyond national boundaries. Today considerations other than (purely economic) BVM have become relevant in public procurement policy and practice. Examples of social linkages in public procurement are found in various countries, from the well-known ‘Affirmative Action Programs’ in the US that advance minorities, women, persons with disabilities and veterans, 1 to specific <b>set-aside</b> <b>programs</b> made available to only less-competitive businesses, such as women-owned businesses, minority-owned businesses, businesses operating in economically disadvantaged areas, etc. Set-asides can be seen as social procurement linkages through the promotion of both supplier diversity and employment. The latter means that social use of public procurement can positively impact employment by providing opportunities to workers who are generally excluded from the labour market, while the former means that chances are given to less-competitive bidders. <b>Set-aside</b> <b>programs</b> have been widely developed in the US, which has a long tradition of set-aside contracts for special classes of small businesses, including small disadvantaged businesses, and in Canada where set-asides have been introduced for the development of Aboriginal businesses.

40|$|Nominal {{grain and}} oilseed prices have {{declined}} dramatically {{from the high}} levels observed in the mid- 1990 s. As a result, {{it has been suggested}} by some industry stakeholders that measures should be taken to limit world crop supplies to raise prices. One such measure is a <b>set-aside</b> <b>program</b> involving a number of participants that would significantly reduce the quantity of land in production over a certain period of time. In fact, the European Union and the United States currently have set-aside programs that, together, already have had a positive effect on crop prices. Set-aside programs could also become relevant if the use of the World Trade Organization blue box is extended to more countries after the next round of negotiations. This analysis focuses on the quantitative aspects of a substantial multi-country, multi-commodity, <b>set-aside</b> <b>program</b> and its impact on major agricultural commodity prices. Three main conclusions can be drawn from the analysis: · A permanent <b>set-aside</b> <b>program</b> would be necessary to keep prices from returning to relatively low levels · Even with a permanent <b>set-aside</b> <b>program,</b> the results show a declining effect over time mostly because of additional production by non-participating countries and because of crop substitution in favour of cereals and oilseeds and higher yield in participating countries. · For a <b>set-aside</b> <b>program</b> to have any significant impact on prices, the program must include many commodities in many countries. A program involving Canada alone is doomed to fail. And given that the United States and the European Union-two large producers-already have their respective set-aside programs, it might be difficult to convince them to participate in an international effort.

40|$|<b>Set-aside</b> <b>programs</b> of the European {{government}} {{have a double}} impact on the regional soil erosion risk in agricultural regions: (1) there is less area susceptible to soil erosion and (2) fields with a high erosion rate are preferably taken out of production resulting in a decrease of the average erasion risk. In order to quantify this double effect an inquiry among farmers in central Belgium {{was set up to}} find out which fields are preferably taken out of production. A statistical analysis pointed out that fields with a weak slope gradient, a loamy topsoil and good soil drainage have a low probability of being taken out of production. The results of the questionnaire were used to construct a transition probability map representing for each field the probability that it will be taken out of production. These transition probabilities were used to simulate the decrease in regional erosion risk for different scenarios. The outcome of these simulations suggests that there is a negative power relation between the set-aside percentage and the regional soil erosion risk. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B. V.
