5|$|Almost {{immediately}} after his arrival, Hess began exhibiting amnesia, {{which may have}} been feigned in the hope of avoiding the death sentence. Medical personnel who examined Hess reported he was not insane and was fit to stand trial. At least two examiners, the British doctor and the Soviet one, noted their belief that Hess's amnesia might be fake. Efforts were made to trigger his memory, including bringing in his former secretaries and showing old newsreels, but he persisted in showing no response to these stimuli. When Hess was allowed to make a <b>statement</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tribunal on 30 November, he admitted that he had faked memory loss as a tactic. He spoke to the tribunal again on 31 August 1946, the last day of closing statements.|$|E
5|$|Between 1997 and 2000 Mosley {{repeatedly}} {{warned that}} if any EU decision went against the FIA, the marketing organisations and F1 itself would be moved out of Europe. In 1999, the EU Commission Directorate-General for Competition issued a Statement of Objections, listing a number of grievances surrounding the FIA's dealings with Ecclestone and Formula One. The FIA released the <b>Statement</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> media and {{held a press conference}} in Brussels ridiculing the Commission’s case. The Commission argued that a number of commercial agreements could be viewed as anti-competition and invited the FIA and Ecclestone's companies, ISC and FOA, to submit proposals to modify these arrangements. In 2001, nine months after settlement talks had begun, the parties reached an agreement to amend existing contracts, which included Ecclestone stepping down as the FIA's vice-president of promotional affairs and the FIA ending all involvement in the commercial activities of Formula One.|$|E

5|$|Nineteenth-century sources {{refer to}} Palestine as {{extending}} from the sea to the caravan route, presumably the Hejaz-Damascus route east of the Jordan River valley. Others {{refer to it as}} {{extending from the}} sea to the desert. Prior to the Allied Powers victory in World War I and the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire, which created the British mandate in the Levant, most of the northern area of what is today Jordan formed part of the Ottoman Vilayet of Damascus (Syria), while the southern part of Jordan was part of the Vilayet of Hejaz. What later became Mandatory Palestine was in late Ottoman times divided between the Vilayet of Beirut (Lebanon) and the Sanjak of Jerusalem. The Zionist Organization provided its definition of the boundaries of Palestine in a <b>statement</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Paris Peace Conference in 1919.|$|E
5|$|On 2 July 2005, Waters, Gilmour, Mason and Wright {{performed}} {{together as}} Pink Floyd {{for the first}} time in more than 24years, at the Live 8 concert in London's Hyde Park. Organiser Bob Geldof arranged the reunion, having called Mason earlier in the year to explore the possibility of their reuniting for the event. Geldof asked Gilmour, who turned down the offer, and then asked Mason to intercede on his behalf. Mason declined, but contacted Waters who was immediately enthusiastic. Waters then called Geldof to discuss the event, scheduled to take place in one month. About two weeks later Waters called Gilmour, their first conversation in two years, and the next day the latter agreed. Gilmour then contacted Wright who immediately agreed. In their <b>statement</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> press, they stressed the unimportance of the band's problems in the context of the Live8 event.|$|E

5|$|The Grangegorman killings {{were the}} {{homicide}} on 6 March 1997 of Sylvia Shields and Mary Callinan, patients at St Brendan's Psychiatric Hospital in Grangegorman, Dublin, Ireland. After giving a false confession, Dean Lyons {{was charged with}} the murders and placed on remand. In his <b>statement</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Garda Síochána (police), Lyons gave details that would only be known to the murderer or to the investigators. After Lyons was charged, Mark Nash confessed to the killings, but later retracted his confession. In April 2015, Nash's trial {{for the murder of}} Shields and Callinan began after an unsuccessful attempt to prevent the trial from going forward.|$|E
5|$|The prosecution's {{theory of}} the case, as told in its opening <b>statement</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> jury, was that Thornton, having failed {{in his attempt to}} seduce Ashford, lay in wait for her in the field near the pit. He knew she would have to cross the field on her return from Erdington. On perceiving him, she {{attempted}} to elude him, but he caught her and got her to accompany him into the next field. There, he threw her down and ravished her. The post-mortem showed that she had not eaten in 24hours, and according to the prosecuting counsel, she was unable to resist and fainted. Fearing the consequences were he to be caught with an unconscious woman whom he had treated in such a manner, Thornton threw her into the pit, where she drowned. At that time, defence counsel were not permitted to address the jury, and the matter proceeded with the prosecution case.|$|E

When Whitney's sixteenth birthday arrives, she books flights so they can run away together. Attempting to foil her plan, Tony steals her passport but it is found and returned. On her birthday, Whitney tells Bianca about her relationship with Tony, believing {{that they are going to}} leave together. Horrified, Bianca calls the police, and Tony is arrested.

5|$|Ulrich {{provided}} a <b>statement</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Senate Judiciary Committee regarding copyright infringement on July 11, 2000. Federal Judge Marilyn Hall Patel ordered {{the site to}} place a filter on the program within 72 hours or be shut down. A settlement between Metallica and Napster was reached when German media conglomerate Bertelsmann BMG showed interest in purchasing the rights to Napster for $94million. Under the terms of settlement, Napster agreed to block users who shared music by artists {{who do not want}} their music shared. On June 3, 2002, Napster filed for Chapter 11 protection under U.S. bankruptcy laws. On September 3, 2002, an American bankruptcy judge blocked the sale of Napster to Bertelsmann and forced Napster to liquidate its assets according to Chapter 7 of the U.S. bankruptcy laws.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} witnesses, {{including}} Hannah Cox, {{testified to the}} events of the evening of 26 May and of the following morning. The first witnesses to attract significant cross-examination by William Reader, Thornton's barrister, were the two factory workers, William Lavell and Joseph Bird, who had matched Thornton's shoes to the footprints in the harrowed field. Under cross-examination, both admitted that it had rained heavily between the time the footprints were made and the time they attempted to match the prints. Constable Dales told the jury that Thornton admitted having sex with Ashford before he was searched: that is, before his bloodstained clothing came to light. Mr Freer, a Birmingham surgeon who conducted the post-mortem, testified as to its results, and stated that except for the vaginal lacerations, there were no signs of violence on Ashford's person, and that those cuts could have been caused by consensual sexual relations. Freer's testimony concluded the prosecution case, and as the defendant declined to exercise his right to himself make a <b>statement</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> court, the defence began calling witnesses.|$|E
5|$|Frank {{meets with}} Walker's Chief of Staff, Linda Vasquez (Sakina Jaffrey), whom Frank {{recommended}} for the job. She reveals {{that she and}} Walker have decided to rescind their promise to nominate him as Secretary of State because {{they want him to}} remain in Congress and use his political expertise to get the President-elect’s education reform agenda passed. Frank is initially incensed, but when Linda asks if he will continue to be an ally to the future President he says that he will. Linda reveals that Senator Michael Kern (Kevin Kilner) has been chosen for the position instead. Despite his <b>statement</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> contrary, Frank feels personally betrayed and, with Claire’s encouragement, begins to formulate a plot for revenge, which he shares with his Chief of Staff, Doug Stamper (Michael Kelly). Mrs. Underwood, meanwhile, is forced to downsize the non-profit organization she manages, the Clean Water Initiative, which had been promised a large donation upon her husband’s confirmation as Secretary, without which the organization is forced to substantially curtail its budget.|$|E
