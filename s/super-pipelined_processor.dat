40|$|The {{approach}} of program-driven simulation of multiprocessors {{has generally been}} believed to be too slow in order to perform experiments and performance evaluations with realistic workloads. We show that the program-driven approach for building multiprocessor simulators is indeed a viable method. It compares well in performance to an execution-driven simulator which {{has been reported in}} the literature, and has superior flexibility. The reported simulator is the core in the CacheMire test bench which is an entire environment for conducting performance evaluations on shared memory multiprocessors. The test bench is used in a number of projects, including cache coherence protocol evaluation, <b>super-pipelined</b> <b>processor</b> design and analysis of parallel program behaviour. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{introduces}} the DLX&# 960;+, a <b>super-pipelined</b> <b>processor</b> with variable cycle time. The cycle {{time of the}} DLX&# 960;+ may be as low as 9 gate delays (including 5 gate delays for registers), which {{is assumed to be}} a lower bound for the cycle time. For the parts of the DLX&# 960;+ that significantly differ form previous implementations correctness proofs are provided. Formulas are developed which compute restrictions to the parameters of the DLX&# 960;+, e. g., the maximum number of reservation station entries for a given cycle time. The formulas also compute what modifications to the base design have to be made in order to realize a certain cycle time and what the impact is on the number of pipeline stages. This lays the foundation for computing the time per instruction of the DLX&# 960;+ for a given benchmark and different cycle times in future work {{in order to determine the}} "optimum" cycle time...|$|E
