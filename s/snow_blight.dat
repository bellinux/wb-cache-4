40|$|An {{attempt was}} made in this paper to decide {{possibility}} on the test for the cold resistance of varieties by measuring amylase activity of some forage crop seedlings. The crops and their number of variety or strain used in the test are as follows : Renge (Astragalus sinicus L.) - 6 varieties, Perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) - 6 strains, Orchard grass (Dactylis glomerata L.) - 8 strains and Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum L.) - 12 strains, these materials have been testing concerning the snow resistance at Hokuriku National Agricultural Experiment Station. From the result of measuring the amylase activity, generally speaking, {{it was found that}} there were the negative correlation between amylase activity and <b>snow</b> <b>blight</b> damages, and the positive one between amylase activity and dry matter content in these materials. 主要作物の幼苗期におけるアミラーゼ活力には品種によつてかなりの差異が認められ,アミラーゼ活力の強弱と耐寒性との間には平行的な関係が見られることは前に報告した。この事実から,アミラーゼ活力の測定が作物品種の耐寒性検定の一手段になり得るのではないかと考えられたが,たまたま,農林省北陸農業試験場において,飼料作物における耐雪性検定中の材料を入手することが出来たので, 1960 年春,レンゲ,プレニアルライグラス,オーチャードグラス,イタリアンライグスの幼苗期におけるアミラーゼ活力の測定を行なつた,そして,北陸農試で得られた,レンゲにおいては耐雪性,他は雪腐病被害率及び乾物率との問の関係を検討した. この研究を行なうにあたり,有益な指導を賜つた江原教授ならびに材料及び資料の提供を快諾下さつた土屋茂技官に深謝の意を表する...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} {{assessing}} {{the resistance of}} 84 Scotch pine climatypes, growing in a provenance trial in a taiga zone in Middle Siberia, to pathogens are presented in this paper: pathogens of needle cast (Lophodermium pinastri Chev.), <b>snow</b> <b>blight</b> (Phacidium infestans Karst.), Cenangium diebak (Cenangium ferruginosum Fr. : Fr.) and rust (Cronartium flaccidum (Alb. et Schw.) Wint. and Peridermium pini (Pers.) Lew. et Kleb). The dynamics of the diseases caused by these pathogens are shown for a 30 -year period. The authors found that Scotch pine resistance to the pathogens in the provenance trial depended both on ecological regime of the growing site and on the genetic peculiarities of the climatypes determined by their site of origin. Differences in {{the resistance of the}} same Scotch pine climatypes to the pathogens showed itself when growing them on different ecological backgrounds (on sandy soil - the bear berry pine forest type, and on dark-gray forest soil - the tall-herb pine forest type). Climatypes of “northern Lapponian” and “Siberian” pine subspecies are more tolerant to the pathogens. Articl...|$|E
30|$|Picea jezoensis Carr., one of {{the most}} {{important}} forest species in Hokkaido, Japan, is naturally distributed in central Kamchatka, maritime Siberia, extreme northeast China, North Korea, Sakhalin, and Hokkaido Island [1]. During the past five decades, wood resources from P. jezoensis have decreased in Hokkaido [2]. In addition, plantation of this species is difficult to establish because of its high susceptibility to insect pests (e.g., Adelges japonicus), frost damage during late spring, and <b>snow</b> <b>blight</b> diseases that affect seedlings [3]. However, silvicultural techniques have recently been improved, e.g., selecting a clone with resistance to A. japonicus has resulted in a gradual increase in the P. jezoensis plantation area of Hokkaido. In the near future, wood resources in Hokkaido will be supplied from these newly established plantations. On the other hand, wood resources of Picea species used in Japan (e.g., P. abies and P. sitchensis) were mostly imported from outside of Japan. In addition, only a few reports are available regarding wood properties of plantation-grown trees of this species [4]. Therefore, the wood properties of P. jezoensis should be further explored to fully utilize the wood resources from these plantation-grown trees.|$|E
40|$|Winter {{diseases}} of turfgrasses are {{often associated with}} melting snow or cold, wet periods. Bluegrasses (Poa spp.), fescues (Festuca spp.), and ryegrasses (Lolium spp.) may be attacked, but bentgrasses (Agrostis spp.) are most susceptible. Two diseases, Gray <b>Snow</b> Mold (Typhula <b>blight)</b> and Pink <b>Snow</b> Mold, are common in New York, and may occur singly or side-by-side. Since different fungicides {{may be used to}} control each of these diseases, it is necessary to distinguish between them.

40|$|The fungal {{pathogen}} Microdochium majus, causing <b>snow</b> mould, seedling <b>blight</b> or {{foot rot}} results in severe yield losses in small grain cereals. There are few options to control this pathogen in organic production. In this study, aqueous extracts and powders from the botanicals chamomile, meadowsweet, thyme and Chinese galls {{were tested in}} vitro against M. majus conidia germination and mycelial growth. Subsequently, powders of three chosen botanicals were tested for their effect on emergence of M. majus infected wheat seedlings from soil in climate chambers. Furthermore, seed treatments with warm water, a commercialised bacterial product and one chosen botanical were tested in a field experiment throughout three consecutive years. Of the botanicals tested, Chinese galls showed the highest efficacy in controlling M. majus, reducing conidia germination and mycelial growth by up to 97 and 100 %, respectively. In the growth chamber, an application with Chinese galls compared with the control treatment increased total seedling emergence by up to 57 %. In the field, yield increase through Chinese galls, the bacterial product and the warm water treatment compared with the control was 19, 10 and 37 %, respectively. This study demonstrated the potential of Chinese galls to control M. majus in wheat...|$|R
40|$|During a nine-year-period ca. 100 provenances of Pinus contorta were {{investigated}} annually {{with respect to}} different kinds of damage. primarily by parasitic fungi. Damage to Pinus contorta occurred mainly during the first ten years after planting. northern provenances of Pinus contorta were generally more resistant to pathogens than southern provenances. Weather damage occurred almost every year among trees of southern and coastal provenance. Trees of northern provenance also suffered from weather damage due to temperature oscillations during shoot elongation. Severe weather damage predisposed to infection by secondary pathogens. primarily Gremmeniella abietina. Even northern provenances of Pinus contorta were infected by Phacidium infestans in high-altitude stands in northern Sweden. <b>Snow</b> <b>blight</b> infection was. however. of less importance to lodgepole pine than to Scots pine. owing to the rapid early growth of the former. The most productive plants of both Pinus contorta and Pinus sylvestris were attacked by Phacidium infestans. So far vole damage {{has been the most}} severe threat to Pinus contorta in northern Sweden. Severe infection by Gremrneniella abietina was recorded after vole attack. even among northern provenances of lodgepole pine. Hitherto Pinus contorta has mainly been infected by the same fungi as Pinus sylvestris, with the exception of Melampsora pinitorqua and Lophodermella sulcigena...|$|E
40|$|The {{variation}} of the water-soluble carbohydrate (WSC) concentration in foliage and stubble and winter hardiness among cocksfoot (Dactylis glomerata L.) ecotypes originated from diverse countries were studied {{in the field in}} order to find a breeding material for the improvement of WSC. The total WSC concentration of foliage was found to be highest in Japanese cultivars and lowest in ecotypes from northern Europe in summer and autumn. The {{variation of}} fructan concentration in stubble among ecotypes was larger than the variation of mono and disaccharide concentrations in stubble and that of total WSC concentration in foliage in both winters over which this study was conducted. The total WSC and fructan concentrations in the stubble of ecotypes from Spain and southern Europe, derived from the Mediterranean region, were highest in summer. Ecotypes from Japan showed the highest concentration of total WSC in stubble, and were especially high in fructan concentration in autumn. Ecotypes from France, central Europe and central Asia, like Japanese cultivars, also showed a high fructan concentration. The latitude of origin was negatively correlated with WSC concentration and plant vigor in autumn. The altitude of origin was negatively correlated with plant vigor in autumn and positively correlated with fructan concentration in stubble, winter hardiness and snow endurance. Typhula <b>snow</b> <b>blight</b> resistance was related with the amount of the increase in fructan in the plants and with their growth habits in autumn. The fructan concentration of foliage and stubble in autumn was found to be closely related with winter hardiness in cocksfoot ecotypes. A breeding material which has a high WSC concentration in the foliage could not be found among the ecotypes in this study. However, some ecotypes that showed disease resistance, good winter hardiness and plant vigor would be useful as breeding materials for Hokkaido...|$|E
