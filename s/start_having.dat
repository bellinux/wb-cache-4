The treaty establishing this federation was signed at San José, Costa Rica, on January 19, 1921. The treaty stipulated {{for the future}} creation of one state of all the four signatories, under one constitution. This second Federation was nearly moribund from the <b>start,</b> <b>having</b> only a Provisional Federal Council made up of delegates from each state.|$|E

25|$|A Twenty20 charity {{match was}} held between Bangladesh and a New Zealand Cricket XI with {{the funds raised}} going to people {{affected}} by Cyclone Sidr; the International Cricket Council donated an additional US$250,000 to the funds {{at the start of}} the match. Asked to bat first, the New Zealand side had a slow <b>start,</b> <b>having</b> made just 19 runs for the loss of two wickets after 5.3 overs. Most of the batsmen seemed out of form and fell to injudicious shots, with an unbeaten 33 from James Marshall seeing the side through to 133 for seven from their 20 overs.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the mentioned health risks (like unwanted pregnancies and infection transmissions), other risks {{have been associated with}} early sexual activity. For example, a recent study (2017) found that those who <b>start</b> <b>having</b> sex at an earlier age have higher risks of: not using a condom; not having good memories of that first experience; and having had that relationship for non-autonomous reasons (such as partner pressure, peer pressure or the influence of substance use). This article also summarizes other risks (found in previous studies) associated with earlier sex: having an increased number of sexual partners or of casual sexual partners; perpetrating or being a victim of forced sex; engaging in paid sex; depression and behavior problems.|$|E
25|$|The first Test was {{scheduled}} between 4 and 9 November. It was originally {{scheduled to be}} played in Ahmedabad, but was moved to Bombay due to communal riots in the city. India won the toss and batted first {{in front of a}} 40,000 strong packed stadium. Openers Dilip Sardesai and Farokh Engineer lost their wickets to a quick Graham McKenzie after a good <b>start.</b> <b>Having</b> lost three wickets for 42, Ashok Mankad (74), who was promoted up the order, and Pataudi (95), put on 146 runs, then a record stand against Australia for the fourth wicket, after being dropped once each. A subsequent middle- and lower-order collapse took the score from 202/4 at the end of day one to 271 all out shortly after lunch on day two. McKenzie finished with 5/79.|$|E

25|$|When {{the series}} reached seven volumes, Watsuki's boss {{suggested}} {{him that it}} was time to make a longer story-arc, which resulted in the creation of the fights between Kenshin and Shishio Makoto. The arc was only meant to be serialized for one year, but it ended up being one year-and-a-half long. This arc was also done to develop Kenshin's character as he considered him not to have a weak point. Watsuki commented that his artistic skills were honed with this arc, as he could draw everything he wanted to. The last arc from the manga was meant to be much shorter, but it turned out to be a fairly long one as he could not present it in a simplistic manner. This arc was originally made by Watsuki prior to the series' <b>start,</b> <b>having</b> already thought about how would Kenshin's scar had been made. Watsuki also planned to create a Hokkaido arc and a sequel, but felt it would be better to start with another manga and so ended the series with the last arc he made.|$|E
25|$|In the 2007/2008 curling season Jones celebrated several successes {{including}} {{winning the}} 2007 Autumn Gold Grand Slam {{as well as}} the 2008 Manitoba Provincial Championship. Winning the 2008 Manitoba Provincial Championship qualified her to represent the province at the 2008 Scotties Tournament of Hearts in Regina, Saskatchewan. Jones got off to a slow <b>start,</b> <b>having</b> just a 3–4 record to start off the week, but then gotten four consecutive wins for a 7-4 record which earned a spot in the tiebreaker match where she defeated Newfoundland and Labrador's Heather Strong by a score of 6–3. In the first playoff game, Jones edged Québec skip Marie-France Larouche with a score of 6–5. She advanced to the semi-finals, where she defeated Ontario's Sherry Middaugh 9–8 by stealing a point in the extra end. In the final, Jones faced Alberta's Shannon Kleibrink. In the final stone, Klëibrink had the opportunity to score a big end for the win but only managed to knock out one Manitoba Stone giving Jones' team a 6-4 victory and was crowned Canadian Champions for the second time.|$|E
25|$|The Blue Jackets {{got off to}} a good <b>start,</b> <b>having</b> a 7–5–1–1 {{record in}} their opening 14 games. Columbus, however, won only two of their next 12 games to fall out of the playoff picture. The club would play mediocre hockey {{for the rest of the}} season, {{finishing}} with a 29–42–8–3 record, earning 69 points for last place in the Western Conference for the second-straight season. Midway through the season, Columbus fired Head Coach Dave King after a 14–20–4–2 start. King was replaced with General Manager Doug MacLean, as the Blue Jackets posted a record of 15–22–4–1 record under his guidance. The 69 points was a 12-point improvement over the previous season, but the club finished 23 points behind the Edmonton Oilers for the final playoff spot in the Conference. The previous season, the Blue Jackets scored a League-low 164 goals, however, the team would beat that total by 49 goals, finishing with a club record 213 goals. Columbus though led the NHL in goals against, allowing 263, also a club record.|$|E

500|$|For the 1909 Varsity Match, Cunningham {{announced}} {{his choice of}} Poulton at a meeting on 2 December which Vassall was unable to attend. Cunningham sent him a letter by hand informing him of the decision. When the note returned undelivered, Cunningham hesitated, at which point Tarr offered {{to give up his}} own place for Poulton but Cunningham stuck to his initial selection. The game was played on 11 December, with Oxford at the <b>start</b> <b>having</b> the worse of it until one moment turned the game around: after the Oxford forwards got the ball back, Gotley, at scrum-half, sent the ball to Cunningham, who passed on to Tarr and he to his fellow centre Colin Gilray. He fed the ball to Poulton on the left wing still inside the Oxford half. Poulton then broke through the defence to score under the posts. With Oxford eight points ahead {{at the end of the}} first quarter, Tarr was forced off the field after breaking his collarbone making a tackle, and missed much of what was described by referee F.C. Potter-Irwin as [...] "the fastest and most spectacular Varsity Match he had ever witnessed". Oxford beat Cambridge 23–3, Poulton scoring five tries.|$|E

2500|$|The {{rationale}} for the abolition is summarized by former Wall Street Journal reporter Mei Fong: [...] "The reason China is doing this right now is because they have too many men, too many old people, and too few young people.

And if people don’t <b>start</b> <b>having</b> more children, they’re going to have a vastly diminished workforce to support a huge aging population." [...] China's ratio is about five working adults to one retiree; the huge retiree community must be supported, and that will dampen future growth, according to Fong.|$|E

[...] Unfortunately, it gives no information about the structural strength of the artery. Angiography does not visualize atheroma; it only makes the blood flow within blood vessels visible. Alternative methods that are non or less physically invasive and less expensive per individual test have been used and are continuing to be developed, such as those using computed tomography (CT; led by the electron beam tomography form, given its greater speed) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The most promising since the early 1990s has been EBT, detecting calcification within the atheroma before most individuals <b>start</b> <b>having</b> clinically recognized symptoms and debility. Interestingly, statin therapy (to lower cholesterol) does not slow the speed of calcification as determined by CT scan. [...] MRI coronary vessel wall imaging, although currently limited to research studies, has demonstrated the ability to detect vessel wall thickening in asymptomatic high risk individuals.

2500|$|Eddie and Jake {{give their}} {{statements}} at police headquarters. Jake learns that Eddie {{wanted to be}} a policeman like his father. But he lost an eye in a training accident, and having a glass eye means he cannot now join the force. The two go to Eddie's place and <b>start</b> <b>having</b> sex. [...] Jake handcuffs Eddie to his bed and goes in search of condoms. As he's returning, the killer stabs him and leaves him for dead. Eddie hears the struggle and calls out. As the killer approaches and Eddie struggles with the cuffs, Jake hits the killer from behind with a baseball bat. Eddie slips a hand out of the cuffs, tends to Jake's wound and heads off to call an ambulance, but the killer wakes and disables the phone. Eddie runs to the kitchen. He finds a knife but also finds the heads of Joey, Chaz, and Tobey in a closet. Eddie evades the killer and retreats to his bedroom, locking Jake and himself in. As the killer chops at the door, Eddie retrieves his father's gun and some bullets. Eddie pushes Jake out onto the fire escape and loads the gun. The killer breaks down the door and attacks Eddie again, knocking him out the window and over the fire escape railing. As Eddie dangles from the fire escape, the killer turns toward Jake. Eddie fires the gun, grazing Jake (as Eddie lacks the stereoscopic vision and depth perception to aim well). Eddie fires again, hitting the killer in the forehead.|$|E
