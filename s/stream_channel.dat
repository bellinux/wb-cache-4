5|$|At one point, Eddy Creek {{flows through}} a {{restored}} channel at a reclaimed mining site. Further downstream, the creek flows through its natural channel and cuts across {{a number of}} rock ledges. However, {{by the time it}} crosses US Route 6, it has lost its flow. Nevertheless, its channel is still discernible and its gradient is shallower. The creek loses its channel completely at the intersection of an electric transmission corridor and the Eddy Creek Mine Tunnel. It eventually reappears, but disappears again in strip pits and sinks. From Birds Eye Mine to Underwood Road, the <b>stream</b> <b>channel</b> has been completely destroyed. The creek has an engineered channel in one reach where it passes through a residential area.|$|E
25|$|Mining stream {{channels}} for {{sand and gravel}} can impact riparian zones by destroying habitat directly, removing groundwater through pumping, altering <b>stream</b> <b>channel</b> morphology, and changing sediment flow regimes. Conversely, mining activities in the floodplain can create favorable areas {{for the establishment of}} riparian vegetation (e.g., cottonwoods) along streams where natural recruitment processes have been impacted through other forms of human activity. Mining for metals can impact riparian zones when toxic materials accumulate in sediments.|$|E

25|$|Stream {{channels}} {{will often}} recover from channelization without human intervention, provided that humans do {{not continue to}} maintain or modify the channel. Gradually, channel beds and stream banks will begin to accumulate sediment, meanders will form, and woody vegetation will take hold, stabilizing the banks. However, this process may take decades: a study found <b>stream</b> <b>channel</b> regeneration took approximately 65 years in channelized streams in West Tennessee. More active methods of restoration may speed the process along.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the best}} places for {{building}} a dam is a narrow part of a deep river valley; the valley sides then can act as natural walls. The primary function of the dam's structure is to fill the gap in the natural reservoir line left by the <b>stream</b> <b>channel.</b> The sites are usually those where the gap becomes a minimum for the required storage capacity. The most economical arrangement is often a composite structure such as a masonry dam flanked by earth embankments. The current use of the land to be flooded should be dispensable.|$|E
25|$|Sedimentary breccia {{consists}} of angular, poorly sorted, immature fragments of rocks in a finer grained groundmass which {{are produced by}} mass wasting. It is lithified colluvium or scree. Thick sequences of sedimentary (colluvial) breccia are generally formed next to fault scarps in grabens. Breccia may occur along a buried <b>stream</b> <b>channel</b> where it indicates accumulation along a juvenile or rapidly flowing stream. Sedimentary breccia may be formed by submarine debris flows. Turbidites occur as fine-grained peripheral deposits to sedimentary breccia flows. In a karst terrain, a collapse breccia may form due to collapse of rock into a sinkhole or in cave development.|$|E

25|$|A {{distributary}}, or a distributary channel, is {{a stream}} that branches off and flows {{away from a}} main <b>stream</b> <b>channel.</b> They are a common feature of river deltas. The phenomenon is known as river bifurcation. The opposite of a distributary is a tributary. Distributaries usually occur as a stream nears a lake or an ocean, but they can occur inland as well, such as on alluvial fans or when a tributary stream bifurcates as it nears its confluence with a larger stream. In some cases, a minor distributary can divert so much water from the main channel that it can become the main route.|$|E
25|$|Floods {{can happen}} on flat or low-lying areas when water is {{supplied}} by rainfall or snowmelt {{more rapidly than}} it can either infiltrate or run off. The excess accumulates in place, sometimes to hazardous depths. Surface soil can become saturated, which effectively stops infiltration, where the water table is shallow, such as a floodplain, or from intense rain from one or a series of storms. Infiltration also is slow to negligible through frozen ground, rock, concrete, paving, or roofs. Areal flooding begins in flat areas like floodplains and in local depressions not connected to a <b>stream</b> <b>channel,</b> because the velocity of overland flow depends on the surface slope. Endorheic basins may experience areal flooding during periods when precipitation exceeds evaporation.|$|E
25|$|The Hell Creek Formation, as {{typified by}} {{exposures}} in the Fort Peck area of Montana, {{has been interpreted}} as a flat forested floodplain, with a relatively dry subtropical climate that supported a variety of plants ranging from angiosperm trees, to conifers such as bald cypress, to ferns and ginkgos. The coastline was hundreds of kilometers or miles to the east. Stream-dwelling turtles and tree-dwelling multituberculate mammals were diverse, and monitor lizards {{as large as the}} modern Komodo dragon hunted on the ground. Triceratops was the most abundant large dinosaur, and Thescelosaurus the most abundant small herbivorous dinosaur. Edmontosaur remains have been collected here from <b>stream</b> <b>channel</b> sands, and include fossils from individuals as young as a meter- or yard-long infant. The edmontosaur fossils probably represent accumulations from groups on the move.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{pronounced}} effects of urban runoff is on watercourses that historically contained little or no water during dry weather periods (often called ephemeral streams). When an area around such a stream is urbanized, the resultant runoff creates an unnatural year-round streamflow that hurts the vegetation, wildlife and stream bed of the waterway. Containing little or no sediment relative to the historic ratio of sediment to water, urban runoff rushes down the <b>stream</b> <b>channel,</b> ruining natural features such as meanders and sandbars, and creates severe erosion—increasing sediment loads at the mouth while severely incising the stream bed upstream. As an example, on many Southern California beaches {{at the mouth of}} a waterway, urban runoff carries trash, pollutants, excessive silt, and other wastes, and can pose moderate to severe health hazards.|$|E

2500|$|The {{negative}} effects of channelization on stream and riparian health can be lessened through physical restoration of the <b>stream</b> <b>channel.</b> [...] This {{can be accomplished by}} restoring flow to historic channels, or through the creation of new channels. In order for restoration to be successful, particularly for the creation of entirely new channels, restoration plans must take into account the geomorphic potential of the individual stream and tailor restoration methods accordingly. This is typically done through examination of reference streams (physically and ecologically similar streams in stable, natural condition) and by methods of stream classification based on morphological features. Stream channels are typically designed to be narrow enough to overflow into the floodplain on a 1.5 to 2 year timescale. The goal of geomorphic restoration is to eventually restore hydrologic processes important to riparian and instream ecosystems. However, this type of restoration can be logistically difficult: in many cases, the initial straightening or modification of the channel has resulted in humans encroaching into the former floodplain through development, agriculture, etc. In addition, <b>stream</b> <b>channel</b> modification can be extremely costly.|$|E

40|$|This is an author's peer-reviewed final manuscript, as {{accepted}} by the publisher. The published article is copyrighted by Springer {{and can be found}} at: [URL] hydropower plants divert part of the water from wide and physically complex <b>stream</b> <b>channels</b> with active hyporheic areas to narrow and hydraulically simple concrete canals, and thus, might affect nutrient dynamics. We compared nutrient uptake in diversion canals and in <b>stream</b> <b>channels</b> in the Leitzaran Stream (Basque Country, northern Spain). We hypothesized that simple morphology in diversion canals will result in lower nutrient uptake in canals than in <b>stream</b> <b>channels.</b> Periphytic chlorophyll and biomass did not differ significantly between reach types. Water was significantly deeper and faster in canals than in <b>stream</b> <b>channels,</b> but the transient storage zone did not differ significantly between reach types. There {{were no significant differences between}} uptake length for neither phosphate nor ammonium between reach types. Uptake length in both <b>stream</b> <b>channels</b> and diversion canals decreased with discharge, in a pattern similar to that previously described for pristine rivers across the world. Uptake velocity and uptake rate for phosphate did not differ significantly between reach types, but in the case of ammonium both retention metrics were significantly larger in the diversion canals. Results suggest that although hydropower schemes have minor effects on nutrient retention, these depend on the proportion of flow diverted...|$|R

These processes normally cause the first severe road interruptions, due not only to deposits accumulated on the road (from several cubic metres to hundreds of cubic metres), but in some cases to the complete removal of bridges or roadways or railways crossing the <b>stream</b> <b>channel.</b> Damage usually derives from a common underestimation of mud-debris flows: in the alpine valleys, for example, bridges are frequently destroyed by the impact force of the flow because their span is usually calculated only for a water discharge.
