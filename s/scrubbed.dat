5|$|It {{was clear}} that the planned {{processing}} flow could not be followed and still meet the 1986 launch date. It was decided on Cosmonaut's Day (12 April) 1985 to ship the flight model of the base block to the Baikonur cosmodrome and conduct the systems testing and integration there. The module arrived at the launch site on 6 May, with 1100 of 2500 cables requiring rework {{based on the results of}} tests to the ground test model at Khrunichev. In October, the base block was rolled outside its cleanroom to carry out communications tests. The first launch attempt on 16 February 1986 was <b>scrubbed</b> when the spacecraft communications failed, but the second launch attempt, on 19 February 1986 at 21:28:23 UTC, was successful, meeting the political deadline.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the party}} {{continues}} {{and the party}} goers force Burns' monkeys into having a knife fight. The yacht is eventually boarded by Chinese pirates who take the ship hostage. The pirates rob everyone on board and tie them up in a net which they then toss overboard. But to the luck of Homer {{and some of the}} other guests who happen to be above ocean surface level, it floats and they avoid drowning. Eventually Homer and Bart make it back to the mansion where the family returns the house to Burns after Marge and Lisa have <b>scrubbed</b> all the rooms clean. Back at the Simpsons home, everyone is glad to live a normal life again—with the exception of Homer, who is upset that he does not live the lifestyle of rich people. The episode ends with Homer wailing about how rich all the persons in the closing credits are (except Richard K. Chung, whom he dismisses as poor) and threatening to report them to the Internal Revenue Service and telling the Gracie Films woman not to shush him.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{representing}} a new vessel, the Enterprise-A {{was the same}} model {{that had been used}} since 1979. Poorly regarded by earlier effects artists because of its complicated wiring and bulk, the Enterprises hairline cracks were puttied and sanded down, and the internal circuitry was redone. The new model's running lights were matched to similar intensities, saving the effects artists time because the lights would look correct with only a single pass, instead of three passes required previously (for the sensor dome, running lights, and window lights). One unfortunate byproduct of the fixes was the loss of the model's distinctive pearlescent finish. The elaborate sheen was never visible on screen (lighting schemes prevented reflections while filming so the ship could be properly inserted into effects shots) and so when the model was repainted with conventional techniques the effect was lost. The Bird of Prey had been damaged from work in The Voyage Home, where the ship was supposed to fly around the sun. To suggest singes, the model had been painted with black-tinged rubber cement, with the expectation that this application would rub off. The cement instead sat on the model and baked itself to the model surface, and had to be <b>scrubbed</b> off.|$|E

5|$|After the {{crossing}} was complete, the division was relieved from V Corps and assigned to Major General Wade H. Haislip's XV Corps. The division was allowed a one-month rest, resuming its advance on 25 November, attacking the forts north of Mutzig. These forts {{had been designed}} by Kaiser Wilhelm II in 1893 to block access to the plain of Alsace. The 45th Division next crossed the Zintzel River before pushing through the Maginot Line defenses. During this time much of the division's artillery assets were attached to the 44th Infantry Division to provide additional support. The 45th Infantry Division, now commanded by Major General Robert T. Frederick, who had previously commanded the 1st Special Service Force, was reassigned to VI Corps on New Year's Day. From 2 January 1945, the division fought defensively along the German border, withdrawing to the Moder River. It sent half of its artillery to support the 70th Infantry Division. On 17 February the division was pulled off the line for rest and training. Once this rest period was complete, the division was assigned to XV Corps for the final push into German territory. The 45th moved north to the Sarreguemines area and smashed through the Siegfried Line, on 17 March taking Homburg on the 21st and crossing the Rhine between Worms and Hamm on the 26th. The advance continued, with Aschaffenburg falling on 3 April, and Nuremberg on the 20th. The division crossed the Danube River on 27 April, and liberated 32,000 captives of the Dachau concentration camp on 29 April 1945. The division captured Munich {{during the next two}} days, occupying the city until V-E Day and the surrender of Germany. During the next month, the division remained in Munich and set up collection points and camps for the massive numbers of surrendering troops of the German armies. The number of POWs taken by the 45th Division during its almost two years of fighting totalled 124,840 men. The division was then slated to move to the Pacific theater of operations to participate in the invasion of mainland Japan on the island of Honshu, but these plans were <b>scrubbed</b> before the division could depart after the surrender of Japan, on V-J Day.|$|E
25|$|The second launch {{attempt on}} 17 June 2009 was also <b>scrubbed</b> due to {{hydrogen}} leak issues {{seen from the}} Ground Umbilical Carrier Plate.

A successful tanking test for leak checks was performed on 1 July 2009, with modified GUCP seals allowing launch preparations to proceed as scheduled. Because of lightning strikes near the launch pad during the evening of 10 July 2009, NASA <b>scrubbed</b> the launch for the third time and rescheduled for 12 July 2009.

40|$|One of {{characteristics}} of the rising cloud storage technology is low-cost and high reliability. A distinct benefit of disk scanning or <b>scrubbing</b> operation is identifying the potential failure sectors as early as possible, thus providing high reliability. Obviously, the higher the <b>scrubbing</b> frequency is, the higher the system reliability is. However, {{it may take a}} few hours for a scanning process to check the whole disk. In other words, the <b>scrubbing</b> process may result in a downtime or a lower system performance. Furthermore, the <b>scrubbing</b> process consumes energy. In order to reduce the impact of disk <b>scrubbing</b> on disk performance and energy consumption, system designers choose to scan the disk in a low frequency, which results in a lower reliability. Thus it is essential to design a good <b>scrubbing</b> scheme in a large scale storage system over long time horizons. In this paper, we present a novel <b>scrubbing</b> scheme to solve the challenge. In this scheme, an optimum <b>scrubbing</b> cycle is decided by keeping a balance between data loss cost, <b>scrubbing</b> cost, and disk failure rate. Our research shows how the data price and the <b>scrubbing</b> cost affect <b>scrubbing</b> frequency, and the <b>scrubbing</b> scheme is applicable for storage with inexpensive data. Our experiment shows that our scheme outperforms routine method 73. 3 % in cost and 40 % in reliability...|$|R
