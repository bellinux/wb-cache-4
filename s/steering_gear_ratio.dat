5000|$|The Passat was {{introduced}} {{with a great}} number of advanced driver-assistance systems including a semi-automatic parking system, emergency driver assistant which will automatically take control of the vehicle if the driver has suffered a medical emergency, autonomous cruise control system for highway speeds up to 210 km/h, a collision avoidance system with pedestrian monitoring and variable ratio steering marketed as [...] "progressive steering" [...] which will adjust the <b>steering</b> <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> in relation to the current speed.|$|R
25|$|Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management (VDIM) is {{standard}} on the GS 430/460/450h models and coupled to VGRS it can alter <b>steering</b> <b>gear</b> <b>ratios.</b> VDIM became standard on the 2008 GS 350 {{but does not}} include the VGRS system. The GS 450h was among the first Lexus vehicles to receive the Driver Monitoring System in certain markets. This safety system featured an infrared steering wheel mounted camera which monitors driver attentiveness, sounding an alarm if danger ahead is detected and the driver is not paying attention.|$|R
50|$|Standard {{active safety}} {{features}} also include electronically controlled braking (ECB), anti-lock brakes (ABS), and traction control (TRAC). The stability/traction control system, Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management (VDIM) (with disable button), incorporates Electronically Controlled Brake (ECB), Anti-Lock Brakes (ABS), Electronic Brakeforce Distribution (EBD), Traction Control (TRC) and Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) {{active safety systems}} with the Adaptive Variable Suspension (AVS), Electric Power Steering (EPS) and Variable Gear Ratio Steering (VGRS) systems. VDIM integrates these systems to improve vehicle responsiveness to driver input and prevent loss of control. An Emergency Steering Assist system acts to minimize body roll and improve vehicle responsiveness in sudden maneuvers. This system reduces the <b>steering</b> <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> and prompts the suspension to adopt stiffer settings, helping make emergency maneuvers more stable and controlled. Passive safety features include eight to ten standard airbags (depending on model, up to eleven with upgraded rear seats), passenger detection systems, front and rear crumple zones, three-point seatbelts with pretensioners and force limiters, and a reinforced steel body. Dual-stage driver and twin-chambered front passenger airbags, front knee airbags, full-length side curtain airbags, and Thorax-Abdomen-Pelvis (TAP) airbags are also installed.|$|E

40|$|Variable-gear-ratio {{steering}} is {{an advanced}} feature in automotive vehicles. As the name suggest, {{it changes the}} <b>steering</b> <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> depending on {{the speed of the}} vehicle. This feature can simplify steering for the driver, which leads to various advantages, such as improved vehicle comfort, stability, and safety. One serious problem, however, is that the variable-gear-ratio system generates unnatural torque to the driver whenever the variable-gear-ratio control is activated. Such unnatural torque includes both low-frequency and steering-speed-dependent components. This paper proposes a control method to cancel this unnatural torque. We address the problem by using a tire sensor and a set of feedback and feedforward algorithms. Effectiveness of the proposed method is experimentally verified using a hardware-in-the-loop experimental setup. Stability and robustness under model uncertainties are evaluated...|$|E

5000|$|... 2006: Pre-collision {{system with}} Driver Monitoring System {{introduced}} in March 2006 on the Lexus GS 450h using a CCD {{camera on the}} steering column. This system monitors the driver's face to determine where the driver is looking. If the driver's head turns away from road and a frontal obstacle is detected, the system will alert the driver using a buzzer, and if necessary, pre-charge the brakes and tighten the safety belts.2006: the Lexus LS introduced an advanced pre-collision system (APCS), added a twin-lens stereo camera located on the windshield and a more sensitive radar to detect smaller [...] "soft" [...] objects such as animals and pedestrians. A near-infrared projector located in the headlights allows the system to work at night. With the adaptive variable suspension (AVS) and electric power steering, the system can change the shock absorber firmness, <b>steering</b> <b>gear</b> <b>ratios,</b> and torque assist to aid the driver's evasive steering measures. The lane departure warning system will make automatic steering adjustments to help ensure that the vehicle maintains its lane in case the driver fails to react. Driver Monitoring System was introduced on the Lexus LS. Rear-end pre-collision system includes a rearward-facing millimeter-wave radar mounted in the rear bumper. This system adjusts the active head restraints by moving them upward and forward {{to reduce the risk}} of whiplash injuries if an imminent rear collision is detected.|$|R

40|$|This paper first {{analyses}} some {{stability aspects}} of vehicle lateral motion, then a coprime factors and linear fractional transformations (LFT) based feedforward and feedback H 1 control for vehicle handling improvement is presented. The control synthesis procedure uses a linear vehicle model {{which includes the}} yaw motion and disturbance input with speed and road adhesion variations. The synthesis procedure allows the separate processing of the driver reference signal and robust stabilization problem or disturbance rejection. The control action is applied as an additional steering angle, by combination of the driver input and feedback of the yaw rate. The synthesized controller is tested for different speeds and road conditions on a nonlinear model in both disturbance rejection and driver imposed yaw reference tracking maneuvers.

40|$|The {{literature}} on vehicle handling is summarized. Experiments {{were carried out}} {{to determine the effect}} of vehicle response time, <b>steering</b> <b>gear</b> <b>ratio,</b> and near- and far-sight distances on driver performance on a tracking task consisting of driving through a narrow winding course marked by trafic cones. The vehicle response time was found to affect greatly the number of cones touched by the vehicle during a set testing time. On the particular track used in these tests, the driver performed best when the vehicle response time was 0. 20 seconds. The near and far distances over which the driver could see the test course were also found to be o f im-portance. Increasing near-sight distance, with no limit on the far-sight distance produced Poorer driver performance. This also occurred for the case of decreasing far-sight distance with fixed near-sight distance. Tests with variations of steering ratio and steering torque produced little change in driver performance, although there was a weak minimum in cone scores at a steering ratio G = 24. In some of the experiments reported here, spare mental capacity was measured during the test period. For this indirect measurement of task dificulty, changes in the spare mental capacity of the driver were found to have the same sensitivity to changes in the vehicle, as did the change in the number of cones touched by the vehicle...|$|E

5|$|It was {{the first}} LS with {{continuous}} controlled Adaptive Variable Suspension (AVS). The addition of an automated parallel parking assist feature, {{the first of its}} kind in the U.S., allowed the LS 460 to steer itself into preselected parking spaces. Other drive-assist features included a brake-hold system, radar cruise control, electric variable <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> power <b>steering,</b> and electronically controlled braking. The new stability control system was improved to anticipate skids and alter <b>steering</b> assist and <b>gear</b> <b>ratios.</b> The suite of new safety features extended from an eye-tracking Driver Monitoring System to a lane departure warning system. The pre-collision system added the first production image processing chip in a car capable of identifying vehicles and pedestrians in real time, along with millimeter-wavelength radar, stereo cameras, and infrared night vision projectors. A rear pre-collision system with whiplash-preventing active seat headrests and dual-chamber front airbags was also introduced.|$|R

40|$|Vehicles with {{variable}} steering characteristics {{have long}} been studied and compared with those having typical fixed <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> <b>steering,</b> and the variable <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> properties are reported to have improved maneuverability and stability in high-speed lane changes and on slippery low-friction road surfaces. However, {{it is not clear}} how <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> should be set for individual vehicle charac-teristics. Therefore, the present study has investigated a variable <b>steering</b> <b>gear</b> system using body slip angle feedback for the purpose of improved maneuverability and stability in the critical cor-nering range and upwards, in excess of the critical limit, and into the countersteer range. The re-sults of a driving simulator experiment show that the steering effect improves and maneuverabil-ity and stability increase in the critical cornering range and upwards, in excess of the critical limit, and into the countersteer range by applying linear-variable control to the steering ratio from a body slip angle of 5 ˚. This result is seen both in double lane changes, such as in hazard avoidance, and in J-turns with long drifting. Moreover, it shows an improvement in drift controllability through prompt countersteering. Overall, the present system can enhance the driver’s hazard avoidance capability...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The rudder and <b>steering</b> <b>gear</b> is {{the most}} widely used ship {{maneuvering}} equipment. It consists of the maneuvering device, transmission mechanism, <b>steering</b> <b>gear,</b> <b>steering</b> mechanism and the rudder blade. MV "TANSUO HAO " is a scientific research ship of 30 years old. The scientific exploration missions require a very high accuracy of the ship’s course, so the ship has to constantly adjust her course and steer frequently. On that day, the duty officer found the <b>steering</b> <b>gear</b> failure to turn left in the rough sea condition. The engineering crew members had to make an emergency repair. It took plenty of time to locate the trouble of the <b>steering</b> <b>gear</b> in the repair process, because the valve plate deformation problem on the solenoid reversing valve was very hard to find out. By exploring the obscure <b>steering</b> <b>gear</b> failure reason and special troubleshooting process on MV "TANSUO HAO", this thesis provides some repair experience for the hydraulic system management and proposes flexible and patient failure analysis as well as some preventive maintenance measures against the problem.
