40|$|This is {{the first}} study that aimed to assess the effects of <b>septorhinoplasty</b> on quality of life (QOL) in an Asian population. The study {{consisted}} of two parts. First the Derriford Appearance Scale (DAS- 59) was translated into Korean, and {{the reliability and validity}} were assessed by administering the DAS- 59 K, and SF- 36 to 88 inpatients scheduled for operations. Then a prospective study was conducted which included 31 patients who underwent primary <b>septorhinoplasty</b> from October 2008 through May 2009. The changes in QOL and nasal symptoms were evaluated by comparing the preoperative and postoperative 3 month DAS¬ 59 K and NOSE scales. Principal component analysis of the DAS 59 -K showed an optimum five-factor and the Cronbach’s α for each factor was above 0. 7. Significant correlation was found between DAS- 59 K and SF- 36. Objective evaluation showed at least an improvement in every patient. After <b>septorhinoplasty,</b> there was improvement at scores related to general self-consciousness, negative self–concept, and physical stress (P < 0. 05). The pattern of improvement differed by sex, age, and the presence of external nose deviation. Mean NOSE scores decreased significantly after surgery.

40|$|OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: It is {{becoming}} increasingly important for clinicians to demonstrate {{the impact of their}} interventions. The Sino-Nasal Outcome Test- 22 (SNOT- 22) questionnaire is a disease-specific questionnaire involving 22 symptoms combining rhinologic issues with general health issues. We evaluated the SNOT- 22 score as a quality-of-life outcome measure in <b>septorhinoplasty</b> surgery. STUDY DESIGN: Outcome research. METHODS: We carried out a prospective case series in 76 patients undergoing <b>septorhinoplasty.</b> Their SNOT- 22 scores were compared pre- and postoperatively. We also recorded individual symptom scores to study the impact of surgery. To check its reliability, the SNOT- 22 score was correlated to patient-reported symptoms on a visual analogue scale. Patients were screened for comorbid conditions. Interactions with the surgical technique and/or with the initial sinonasal disease were sought. RESULTS: The SNOT- 22 is a reliable and responsive outcome measure in <b>septorhinoplasty</b> surgery. <b>Septorhinoplasty</b> was especially effective at addressing nasal obstruction, discharge, olfaction, related sleep disturbance, and emotional symptoms such as embarrassment or frustration.

40|$|BACKGROUND: There {{has been}} a great {{expansion}} in patient-based outcome measures to face the ever-increasing demand to demonstrate surgical efficacy. However, surgeons have not adopted until now any systematic outcome instrument. The 22 -item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT- 22) is a validated sinonasal outcome score in sinonasal and <b>septorhinoplasty</b> surgery but does not measure aesthetic outcome. The aim {{of this paper is to}} validate a modification to the Sino-Nasal Outcomes Test- 22 (SNOT- 22) with a new question regarding the shape of the nose (SNOT- 23). METHODOLOGY: We conducted a prospective cohort study on 69 consecutive patients undergoing <b>septorhinoplasty</b> and a control group of healthy volunteers. Reproducibility, responsiveness to treatment, known group differences and validity of the SNOT- 23 were analysed. Scores were compared to visual analogue scales, nasal obstruction symptoms evaluation (NOSE) score and nasal inspiratory peak flow. RESULTS: SNOT- 23 has good test-retest reliability and is a valid outcome measure for assessing response to surgery especially with regards to shape of the nose and nasal obstruction when compared to other patient reported measures. CONCLUSION: SNOT- 23 is a valid and reliable tool that can be easily used in routine clinical practice to assess the functional and aesthetic outcomes from <b>septorhinoplasty</b> surgery. The SNOT- 23 could be adopted as a universal, easy to use tool in rhinology clinics for the assessment of response to <b>septorhinoplasty</b> and sinus surgery. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether functional <b>septorhinoplasty</b> provides improvement of the nasal passage in validated patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) for adults with an anatomical obstruction of the nasal valve. All patients with an anatomical obstruction of the nasal valve area due to nasal valve pathology and/or septal deviations in this area were included. METHODS: A systematic PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library search was performed to identify relevant articles. The articles were critically appraised and ranked according to validity and relevance. RESULTS: Sixteen articles met our inclusion criteria, and after critical appraisal, 10 were eligible for further analysis. In 9 studies, the Nose Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) score improved from 35 to 60 points. In 1 study, the Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT- 22) improved 3. 5 points.

Studies so far have demonstrated poor correlation between bilateral NIPF and symptom specific nasal questionnaires following <b>septorhinoplasty</b> [...] DESIGN: To perform a prospective comparative analysis between NIPF and the validated disease specific quality of life questionnaire SNOT 22 and {{to determine if a}} correlation exists following <b>septorhinoplasty</b> surgery. SETTING: The Royal National Throat Nose and Ear Hospital, London. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 122 patients (78 males, 44 females; mean age 33. 5 +/- 12. 2 years) were recruited from the senior authors rhinology clinic and underwent functional <b>septorhinoplasty</b> surgery MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pre and post-operative nasal inspiratory peak flow (NIPF) measurements were performed in addition to the completion of three subjective quality of life and symptom assessment tool questionnaires; Sinonasal Outcome Test 22 (SNOT- 22), Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) and Visual Analogue Scores (VAS: 0 - 10). RESULTS: The mean pre-operative NIPF was 88. 2 L/min, and the post-operative value was 101. 6 L/min and showed a significant improvement following surgery (P = 0. 0064). The mean total SNOT- 22 score improved significantly from 48. 6 to 26. 6 (P< 0. 0001); the NOSE score from 14. 1 to 6. 6 (P< 0. 0001); and the VAS blockage score from 6. 9 to 3. 2 (P< 0. 0001). All individual domains assessed showed improvements post-operatively but no correlation was found between the NIPF and SNOT- 22 score. Equally, we did not find a correlation between NIPF and the symptom specific NOSE questionnaire and the nasal blockage domain on the VAS scale.

40|$|Purpose: The aim in {{this study}} is to compare the {{functional}} results of open <b>septorhinoplasty</b> with and without osteotomies performed with the aim of increasing respiratory functions and healing the deformations in patients with traumatic nasal deformations. Material and Methods: In this prospective and clinical study, 26 patients with traumatic nasal deformation, who applied between 2007 and 2009 were analyzed. The physical examination, medical photographies, the findings of periorbital edema and ecchymosis and changes in respiratory behaviors before and after the operation were recorded. Evident irregularities of nasal dorsum, septum deviation and respiratory distress were identified in all of the patients. Open <b>septorhinoplasty</b> with osteotomy (13 patients and ndash; 50 %) and without osteotomy (13 patients and ndash; 50 %) were applied to a total of 26 patients. Osteotomy decision was given according to nasal dorsal width and nasal height. All the patients were controlled in the in the first, third, sixth and twelfth months of the postoperative period to analyze the results. The data gathered through these cases were compared with the literature. Results: Functional improvements were observed after open <b>septorhinoplasty</b> operations in all patients. When the post-operative results of the open <b>septorhinoplasty</b> operations with and without osteotomy are compared, it was observed that among the group of patients on which osteotomies were not practiced respiratory complaints improved better, stricture in the nasal passage was not caused, edema and ecchymosis in the postoperative period was lesser. Conclusion: In this study, the attempt was to prove that although open <b>septorhinoplasty</b> operations are classically performed with osteotomy, the operations without osteotomy has not cause stricture in the nasal passage, it causes less edema and ecchymosis in the postoperative period compared to the group with osteotomy.

40|$|Introduction: Controversy {{remains as}} to the {{advantages}} and disadvantages of pharyngeal packing during <b>septorhinoplasty.</b> Our study investigated the effect of pharyngeal packing on postoperative nausea and vomiting and sore throat following this type of surgery or <b>septorhinoplasty.</b>   Materials and Methods: This clinical trial was performed on 90 American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I or II patients who were candidates for <b>septorhinoplasty.</b> They were randomly divided into two groups. Patients in the study group had received pharyngeal packing while those in the control group had not. The incidence of nausea and vomiting and sore throat based on the visual analog scale (VAS) was evaluated postoperatively in the recovery room as well as at 2, 6 and 24 hours.   Results: The incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) was 12. 3 %, with no significant difference between the study and control groups. Sore throat was reported in 50. 5 % of cases overall (56. 8 % on pack group and 44. 4 % on control). Although the severity of pain was higher in the study group at all times, the incidence in the two groups did not differ significantly.   Conclusion: The use of pharyngeal packing has no effect in reducing the incidence of nausea and vomiting and sore throat after surgery. Given that induced hypotension is used as the routine method of anesthesia in <b>septorhinoplasty</b> surgery, with a low incidence of hemorrhage and a high risk of unintended retention of pharyngeal packing, its routine use is not recommended for this procedure...|$|E

40|$|AIM: The aim of {{our study}} is to observe {{adequate}} and inadequate psychological reactions in patients who are candidates for <b>septorhinoplasty,</b> before and after surgery and to create an adequate psychological model of a person suitable for <b>septorhinoplasty</b> in this group of patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this study, 140 patients with nasal septal deviation (deviatio septi nasi), alone or together with other nasal deformities, were observed {{in the period of}} 4 years (2011 - 2015 year). Our patients were psychologically observed using two standard psychological tests: Patients selection for <b>septorhinoplasty</b> and their psychological abilities (“Self-body image” questionnaire) and Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) test. RESULTS: Most of the patients 43 (39. 8 %), thought that after rhinoseptoplasty their self-confidence arise, 32 (29. 63 %) expected changing's in their life's, few of them 9 (8, 3 %) thought that the environment will act different with them.

40|$|Objective: This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the diagnostic accuracy of different diagnostic tests in predicting nasal septum deformities during preoperative planning for <b>septorhinoplasty.</b> Methods: Consecutive patients who underwent <b>septorhinoplasty</b> between June 2011 and August 2012 were included (n = 30) and underwent a protocol of diagnostic tests, including nasal speculoscopy, craniofacial computed tomography (CT), three-dimensional (3 D) reconstruction of the nasal septum by CT and nasal endoscopy. A modified Guyuron classification of septal deformities was used for classifying the septal deviations. Direct surgical assessment of the nasal septum during open <b>septorhinoplasty</b> was the reference standard with which each of the diagnostic tests was compared. Sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of each test were calculated. Results: The preoperative diagnosis was nasal bone fracture in 11 patients, nasal septal fracture in 15 and post-traumatic nasal deformity in four. For type A deviations (localised), craniofacial CT showed the highest performance with a sensitivity of 100 %, specificity of 100 %, positive predictive value (PPV) of 100 % and negative predictive value (NPV) of 99 %. For type B septal deformations (C shape), nasal endoscopy (sensitivity, 100 %; specificity, 87. 5 %; PPV, 87. 7 %; and NPV, 100 %) showed the highest performance. For type C deformities (S shape), nasal endoscopy (sensitivity, 70 %; specificity, 100 %; PPV, 100 %; and NPV, 87 %) showed the highest performance. The accuracy for nasal endoscopy was 27 / 30 (90 %), 26 / 30 (87 %) for craniofacial CT, 22 / 30 (73 %) for 3 D reconstruction and 10 / 28 (36 %) for speculoscopy. Conclusions: Nasal endoscopy and craniofacial CT were more accurate and precise than nasal speculoscopy and 3 D reconstruction for preoperative evaluation of the nasal septum, thus enabling more appropriate surgical planning for <b>septorhinoplasty.</b> (C) 2016 British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons.

40|$|Background: <b>Septorhinoplasty</b> is a {{frequent}} surgical procedure used for both cosmetic and functional purposes. The tech-nique varies from surgeon to surgeon and according to which suture material is used. While some surgeons prefer non-absorbable sutures, others prefer sutures with delayed absorption. These materials sometimes pro-trude from the skin and they may cause skin reactions. While these reactions are common in the late period, a skin reaction in the early period because of polydioxanone suture is extremely rare and {{to the best of}} our knowledge, this is the first such reported case in the literature. Case Report: A 25 -year-old male patient underwent endonasal <b>septorhinoplasty</b> procedure with endo-tracheal general an-esthesia. We hereby present the skin reaction because of frequently used polydioxanone suture on the 24 th postoperative day and the management of this patient. We cut the suture at skin level and prescribed antibio-therapy, and we scheduled a follow-up for 10 days afterwards. The patient had no complaint and the control examination result was normal. Conclusions: When performing <b>septorhinoplasty</b> operations, very rare complications of the procedure shouldn’t be ignored and an informed consent must be obtained after explaining possible complications before the operation. This approach is important for increasing the patient compliance and proper follow-up for the patient. This way, es-pecially post-operative early complications as our case will be able to be solved with close follow-up and in...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Formation of a slowly growing cyst {{following}} <b>septorhinoplasty</b> {{is a rare}} but serious complication. Mucous cyst is {{more common}} than foreign body inclusion cyst. Typically, these cysts present as a solitary lesion that develops in the subcutaneous space over the nasal bone {{along the line of}} nasal osteotomy several months or years after initial surgery. Rarely, the cyst connects with the nasal septum. Surgery is the treatment of choice and consists of either complete excision of the cyst capsule or marsupialization of the cyst. Case report: A nasoseptal mucous cyst developed in a 46 -year-old woman 10 years after <b>septorhinoplasty.</b> We successfully marsupialized the cyst with an endonasal endoscopic approach. Conclusion: Cysts can be removed by either complete resection of the cyst capsule or marsupialization via endonasal endoscopy.

The anesthetic technique was standardized for both groups. Preoperative and postoperative hemoglobin levels were recorded for all patients. Patients were assigned randomly to 1 of 2 study groups, and preincisional surgical field infiltration with 5 mL of 0. 5 % levobupivacaine plus 5 mL of 0. 9 % saline (group L; n = 30) or 5 mL of 0. 75 % ropivacaine plus 5 mL of 0. 9 % saline (group R; n = 30) was performed by the same surgeon. The degree of pain was measured by visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain and recorded at multiple time points in all patients after surgery. ResultsThe analgesic effect at 2 hours in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) and at 24 hours postoperatively did not differ significantly between the 2 local anesthetics (P > 0. 05).

The aim of our study is to observe adequate and inadequate psychological reactions in patients who ar...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} the surgical management of a leiomyomaof the nasal dorsum. Clinical case: A 50 years-old man was referred {{with a slow}} progressiveasymptomatic swelling of the nasal dorsum. History wasnegative for frontonasal trauma, infection or previous surgery. Clinical examination revealed an asymmetric subcutaneousslightly mobile mass of the nasal dorsum; there was not evidenceof cutaneous sinus. Intranasal examination detected a mass protrudinginto the right vestibulum, covered by pink mucosa. RM demonstrated a well-circumscribed mass consistent withfibroma or leiomyoma extending into the upper portion of thenasal septum. Open <b>septorhinoplasty</b> was performed. A stair-step columellarincision was made, the lower and upper lateral cartilage weredelimited. The mass was dissected from both the upper lateralcartilage and {{the underside of the}} nasal bones with completeexcision of the mass. The defect was curetted. Two paraseptalspreaders grafts, taken from septum, were sutured transeptal. Alarremodelling and interdomal suture were performed. Histopathologic analysis was consistent with a leiomyoma(size 2. 3 cm× 2 cm× 2. 5 cm). Postoperative clinical examinationshowed a good esthetic result; no complications or recurrenceoccurred at 22 months of follow-up. Conclusion: The use of an open <b>septorhinoplasty</b> may appearan invasive approach for the benign nature of the lesion, but itrevealed to be a suitable technique to immediately overcome thenegative consequence of the surgical dissection over the sub-nasalstructures preserving both function and aesthetic of the nos...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Introduction & Objective: Post {{operative}} pain {{is usually}} treated by opioids, which is expensive and may induce various side effects. Non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs {{have been considered}} recently for controlling pain due to their cheapness, fewer side effects and availability. This study compares the analgesic efficacy of preoperative administration of single dose of rectally diclofenac and acetaminophen for post operative analgesia in <b>septorhinoplasty,</b> {{one of the most}} common head and neck surgeries. Materials & Methods: Sixty adult patients with ASA = 1 underwent <b>septorhinoplasty</b> were randomly divided into two equal groups. Thirty minutes before induction of anesthesia, 100 mg diclofenac suppository and 325 mg of rectal acetaminophen were given to group I and group II respectively. Induction and maintenance of anesthesia were similar in all patients. Then the severity of pain was graded 1, 2 and 4 hours after operation according to Visual Analogue Scale. Also the first time of analgesic request and total administered dose of analgesics were assessed by another person in all patients. Results: Results revealed that severity of pain in diclofenac group in all three defined times was significantly less than that in the other group (p< 0. 05). Also the average of first time analgesic request in group 1 and 2 was 205 and 97 minutes respectively and the average dose of administered pehtidine was 12. 25 mg in diclofenac and 37. 15 mg in acetaminophen group. Conclusion: The pre-operative administration of rectal diclofenac was more effective for post septorhioplasty analgesia than the rectal acetaminophen and thus it could be used and recommended as a safe, compensive and effective method for post operative pain relief in this common surgery...|$|E
40|$|A {{questionnaire}} {{method was}} used to assess the ability of early primary reduction to treat the fractured nose. Questionnaires were sent to one hundred and twenty eight such patients of whom eighty five (66 %) replied. Seventy two (85 %) of the patients expressed satisfaction with their nasal appearance with only thirteen (15 %) requesting corrective surgery. Thirty one patients (36 %) experienced nasal obstruction following reduction and of those, eighteen (21 %) wished to undergo further surgery. In a separate study the cause of nasal deformity in fifty five patients undergoing <b>septorhinoplasty</b> was ascertained. In thirty six of these patients (65. 5 %) the deformity resulted from a neglected nasal injury. The value and limitations of early primary reduction of nasal fractures is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Background. Tracheal {{intubation}} is a foremost {{cause of}} {{trauma to the}} airway mucosa, result-ing in postoperative sore throat (POST) with reported incidences of 21 – 65 %. We compared the effectiveness of ketamine gargles with placebo in preventing POST after endotracheal intubation. Methods. Forty-six, ASA I–II, patients undergoing elective surgery for <b>septorhinoplasty</b> under general anaesthesia were enrolled in this prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blind study. Patients were randomly allocated into two groups of 23 subjects each: Group C, saline 30 ml; Group K, ketamine 40 mg in saline 30 ml. Patients were asked to gargle this mixture for 30 s, 5 min before induction of anaesthesia. POST was graded at 0, 2, 4, and 24 h after operation on a four-point scale (0 – 3) ...|$|E
40|$|Septoplasty is {{performed}} to resolve breathing problems, but it often becomes pivotal to correct external nasal deviation, representing a central step in rhinoplasty surgery. Even {{in patients with}} no functional problems, septal surgery may represent the best solution for obtaining a proper realignment of the external nasal pyramid. One-stage <b>septorhinoplasty</b> has become the standard of treatment for a deviated nose, hence septoplasty cannot {{be considered as a}} separate procedure to perform before or after rhinoplasty or as a partial operation subject to later revision. The aim {{of this article is to}} discuss the close relationship between the nasal septum and the aesthetics of the nose, and how a graduated surgical approach for the correction of septal deviations could affect the external deviated nose...|$|E
40|$|<b>Septorhinoplasty</b> in {{children}} carries {{the risk of}} growth disturbance of the nose and premaxilla. The open or external approach has the advantage that the cartilaginous nasal skeleton remains intact. This open approach enables the surgeon to excise dermoid cysts and to realign lower lateral cartilages (unilateral cleft) without disturbing {{the integrity of the}} cartilaginous skeleton. In our experience, absolute indications for open rhinoplasty {{in children}} include dermoid cyst, cleft lip nose, and septal abscess. Relative indications include septal deviations causing severe nasal airway obstruction and or progressive distortion of the nose. In this article, we discuss the indications, advantages, disadvantages, and operative technique of open rhinoplasty in children. Our indications for open rhinoplasty in children and some selected cases are illustrate...|$|E
40|$|Nasal septal {{surgery and}} {{rhinoplasty}} are controversial in children. Traditionally, {{an attitude of}} restraint has been employed by most surgeons till an empirical age of 16 to 18 years. This is to avoid the possible adverse effects that the growth spurts may have on the nose and midface region. Some authors, however, have claimed a paucity of evidence that such untoward effects of surgery are frequent. Research has shown that surgical intervention limited to {{certain areas of the}} bony and cartilaginous nasal framework is less likely to affect natural growth patterns. There is a growing consensus toward early intervention, especially in a select group of patients, where deferring the surgery {{may turn out to be}} the poorer option in the short and the long term, and suggestions have been made that conservative guidelines may be employed to minimize the unwarranted results. This article presents our experience with <b>septorhinoplasty</b> in children over the last two decades in an academic setting. We have retrospectively studied the pediatric patients who underwent <b>septorhinoplasty</b> at the Academic Medical Centre, Amsterdam, Netherlands. There were 106 children aged between 3 and 19 years who underwent nasal surgery between February 1994 and August of 2007. Sixty-six of these were boys and 40 were girls. Their follow-up ranged from 12 to 157 months with a mean follow-up period of 53 months. Eighteen patients underwent revision surgery. The clinical circumstances, indications for surgery, extent of surgical interference, and outcome in 106 patients are discussed. Importantly, the patients in this series have been followed for variable periods after puberty and adolescence, allowing for assessment beyond the nasal and midfacial growth spurts. Based on our experience, we have outlined the clinical guidelines that we follow for surgery in this age group of patient...|$|E
40|$|We {{would like}} to comment on the {{recommended}} prophylactic regimen for nasal packing and nasal intubation contained within the Working Party Guidelines for the prevention of endocarditis. In these guidelines, flucloxacillin or clindamycin is rec-ommended for these procedures when they are performed in patients at risk of endocarditis (not just high-risk individuals singled out for dental prophylaxis). 1 The reference given for this recommendation describes a case of prosthetic valve endocarditis due to Staphylococcus aureus complicating anterior nasal packing for epistaxis in a 69 year old man. Six days prior to admission for S. aureus endocarditis, the man had been treated for 4 days with an anterior nasal pack. 2 A further case of staphylococcal endocarditis complicat-ing <b>septorhinoplasty</b> is described by Coursey. 3 Can we extrapolate from these case reports to say that anti...|$|E
40|$|The {{deviated}} external nose {{remains a}} difficult technical challenge {{to even the}} most mas-terful rhinoplastic surgeon. The classic <b>septorhinoplasty</b> approach to the deviated nose demonstrated a 9. 8 % revision rate in this study. During a 2 -year period, the conservative subtraction-addition rhinoplasty procedure was developed, which subsequently reduced the revision rate to 1. 3 %. Conservative subtraction-addition rhinoplasty foregoes aggres-sive septal surgery and equalizes and enhances the airway through asymmetric turbinate volume reduction. Minimal bony and upper lateral work through rasping, soft tissue removal, and/or cartilage grafting allows for external nasal alignment. Both internal and external conservative subtraction-addition rhinoplasty components thus maintain periop-erative structural stability and ensure long-term nasal symmetry. (Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg 1997; 117 : 330 - 7.) Realignment of the deviated external and internal nose {{remains one of the most}} common, but challenging, nasal plastic surgical procedures. Maintaining or achieving equality to both nasal passageways shoul...|$|E
