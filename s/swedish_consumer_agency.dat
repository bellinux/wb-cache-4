40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to define what data could be used to {{describe}} consumers’ actual behaviour when it comes to consumption of sustainable fashion. The perspective is both in terms of finding variables that describe the actual behaviour of sustainable consumption, and to create an appropriate measuring tool that can be used to measure those behaviours. This study has a qualitative research strategy with an inductive approach. The topic was examined by an extensive literature review in the fields connected to the topic. From the literature and the problem raised by the <b>Swedish</b> <b>Consumer</b> <b>Agency,</b> a questionnaire emerged. The questionnaire was also revised into a second version based on the feedback gathered during the focus group session. A questionnaire is suitable to get the consumer perspective, as well as cover all three stages of the consumption cycle and measuring over time. Additionally, this paper focuses on the environmental aspect of sustainability, but the importance of the social and economical aspects are acknowledged. The conclusions drawn in this paper were that it is important to measure the sustainable consumption behaviours of fashion consumers throughout the whole consumption span. When talking about consumption it is a common misconception to focus only on the purchase stage, when it really refers to the purchase, usages and end of use stage as a whole. The variables that were detected were presented in form of a questionnaire. The value of this paper is grounded in the developed questionnaire, which aims are to measure sustainable fashion consumption from a consumer perspective. This is interesting for the <b>Swedish</b> <b>Consumer</b> <b>Agency,</b> who requested a measuring tool, but it may also be of interest for other fashion companies to measure their consumer’s behaviour to detect a demand for sustainable products...|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} sms-loans is {{examined}} by using {{primary and secondary}} sources’. This form of credit is formally independent from other obligations with a very short credit period {{and the amount of}} the loan is low. This form of credits is applied by mobile phones and on the internet by several companies, some of them are presented in this essay. These type of creditors do not come under any sanctions from the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority as is customary for other creditors, they only need to register. Within the consumer credit legislation from 1992 there are some exceptions in the 5 a, 6 and 9 §§ concerning credit rating, information and agreements in writing. These exceptions are the reasons that make sms-loans possible. The current legislation on this subject is identified and the exceptions are further explained in the essay. Within this type of credit the consumer protection differs from other types of loans with higher credit amounts. This is also due to the exceptions within the law. The current consumer credit legislation is based on a council directive from 1987, where it is optional for the member states to include these exceptions or not in their legislation. The legislator in Sweden adopted these exceptions, as they did not predict any risk of over indebtedness. In the law-making process documented in the government bill 1991 / 92 : 83, this risk was considered as non-existent, although this risk of over indebtedness was observed by the <b>Swedish</b> <b>Consumer</b> <b>Agency</b> and the Swedish Enforcement Authority. The statistics of the official non-payment notices confirms this observation. These authorities and the non-governmental organisation, The Swedish Consumers’ Association, have since 2006 and onwards been pushing for a change of the legislation according to the abrogation of the exceptions. Within several official publications the complexity of sms-loans are described, such as the lack of consumer protection and the risk of over indebtedness. The <b>Swedish</b> <b>Consumer</b> <b>Agency</b> is the supervising authority regarding this legislation field, and the companies providing sms-loans. When the Agency discharges one’s official duties, the Marketing Act is the legislation in use. The Swedish Market Court has convicted creditors, but none of the verdicts were related to the exceptions. The lack of consumer protection is also noticed in the EU, and a new council directive was adopted in 2008. This has now been implemented into a memorandum and the appurtenant draft bill. The intention with this bill is to enforce the consumer protection and {{to reduce the risk of}} over indebtedness, when consumers obtain credit. This bill is intended to become effective at 1 of January 2011...|$|E

40|$|Due to the {{importance}} of understanding what circumstances make customer complaint handling successful and how to achieve an effective result; this thesis aims to study the communication failure in the responses given by Swedish telecom companies’ customer service to consumer complaints, and post-complaint consumers’ reactions to those complaint responses through emotions and behavioural intentions. Since previous research about complaint management did not put much focus on communication role as well as on post-complaint consumers’ responses to organizational complaint handling, this study, based on the analysis of authentic customers’ complaint experience with Swedish telecom, incorporates the interactional dimension into the existing models of cognitive and affective antecedents of satisfaction with complaint handling. Regarding methodology, a telecom service provider (TSP) was selected as case study for this thesis. The sample used in this study consisted of 108 consumers’ complaint reports collected from the <b>Swedish</b> <b>Consumer</b> <b>Agency,</b> involving complaint experiences which consumers perceived as unfair. The content analysis of customers’ narratives was applied in this study. Complementary use of quantitative and qualitative approach in the pursuit of a holistic view was chosen for reporting the results. Nvivo, Word and Excel programs were used to process and organize the data. The findings of the study confirmed that the failure by frontline employees’ to display proper interpersonal communication and behaviour in responding to customer complaints was the main reason for complaint handling dissatisfaction. In addition, troublesome organizational procedures and improper redress escalated complaint situations and had negative impact on post-complaint satisfaction. Consumers’ negative emotions and behavioural intentions (e. g., seeking legal action, word of mouth, defection, and mistrust) experienced as a result of post-complaint consumer dissatisfaction. The contribution of this thesis is that identifying communication failures in organizational responses through consumers’ justice perceptions enables Swedish telecom sector to know what customers think is important in complaint handling. Hence, communication training programs are needed for frontline employees to prevent catastrophic complaint responses and enhance customer retention. However, this study examines only one service context; consequently, caution is needed when generalizing the results...|$|E
40|$|Ecological {{issues are}} current topics which {{consumers}} face in every-day life. The growing awareness by the consumers {{that they can}} have an impact on protection of the environment, animals and their own health is the reason of the growing market of ecological products (Kinnear, Talor and Ahmed, 1974; Polonsky, 1994). According to the <b>Swedish</b> <b>consumer</b> <b>agency</b> the agricultural sector had increased highly since the 1990 s. Hence the companies had increased its market activities significant under the last decade (Konsumentverket, 2007). It appears more and more that the most important aspect for competitive positioning of companies providing ecological food is to understand the factors which drive consumers to purchase ecological food products. The KRAV label appears as an essential part of market ecological food. In this context it is very interesting to identify in which degree the consumer is affected by the third-party label KRAV. The purpose of the paper is to identify information about the ecological consumer as well as the factors that influence consumers to buy ecological food products and in this context examine the awareness and importance of ecological labels, in Jönköping County. The thesis is limited in its geographical area because the consumer survey is done in several cities in Jönköping County. The thesis considers general the ecological food industry and does not include other ecological industries such as clothes or furniture. By studying former surveys and conducting a previous study a survey questionnaire was developed. 102 respondents from Jönköpings County were asked to fill in this questionnaire. The collected data were evaluated with the statistical program SPSS. Analysis of variance, correlation analysis and descriptive analysis were used. The authors have got the impression that the ecological consumer in Jönköping County is mostly female and higher educated. The most important factors that influence the consumer positively to choose the ecological products are healthiness, environmental friendliness and better taste. If products do not include pesticides and are produced “animal friendly” it also influence the consumer positive. Negative factors that influence consumers are still a too high price, unavailability and bad/no information. ...|$|E
40|$|The Swedish {{consumer}} magazine Råd & Rön (”Advice and Results”) {{has been available}} to Swedish consumers since 1958. For {{a major part of}} this time the Swedish state, represented by Konsumentverket (the <b>Swedish</b> <b>Consumer</b> <b>Agency)</b> and its predecessor, Konsumentinstitutet (the National Institute for Consumer Information), was the owner of the magazine. In 2006 Råd & Rön was sold to the independent organisation, Sveriges konsumenter (the Swedish Consumers’ Association). The aim of this thesis is to describe the development of the magazine Råd & Rön, and why it has taken on the appearance it has. For almost 50 years the magazine was an official publication and functioned, to a great extent, as a vehicle for the ideas of the authorities. An important component of this work is to clarify the relationship between the magazine, the authorities, the state and the reader in different periods and to demonstrate which factors have influenced this relationship. In {{order to be able to}} do this it is necessary to describe and analyse the social and cultural contexts; that is, to not only discuss what has been published in Råd & Rön, bur also why. A part of this work is to study, and relate to, the development that has taken place in consumer policy. The point of departure for the work has been the collected publications of Råd & Rön from 1958 to approximately mid-year 2012. In order to develop the picture of the consumer area and consumer policy other material has also been used: archive material from the authorities, parliamentary publications, government reports, documents that regulate the activity of the authorities, interviews and literature. In this process a couple of specific approaches to the material have emerged. One of these is the discourse on needs and here I show how it have been taken up by organisations, authorities, the state and the magazine. Another approach concerns the development of journalism, where I show how the relationship to society and the public as well as the view of news ideals and professional ideals have changed. It is possible to see how the consumer material has been transformed from mere content for relatively passive consumer guidance to more active consumer journalism...|$|E

Products with China as Country of Origin can be seen everywhere today and the label “Made in China” is more of a rule than an exception. The question is how the consumers react on such labels; does it matter to them? The purpose of this dissertation was to investigate whether China as Country of Assembly and/or Country of Design constituted a negative impact on the <b>Swedish</b> <b>consumers.</b> The study has also measured the differences in age groups and how the impact varies with the level of product differentiation. To collect the necessary data a questionnaire was handed out to <b>Swedish</b> <b>consumers</b> in the southern part of Sweden.

Therefore, {{the main purpose}} of this research was to investigate and to understand the impact national culture has on mobile phone buyer behaviour of Thai and <b>Swedish</b> <b>consumers.</b> The research was also conducted to identify whether there was a significant cultural difference of buying behaviour for these two cultures when purchasing mobile phones.   Hofstede’s cultural dimensions (individualism/collectivism and power distance) was addressed in order to examine if culture influences Thai and <b>Swedish</b> <b>consumers</b> when purchasing a mobile phone.   In order to examine the difference between Thai and <b>Swedish</b> <b>consumers,</b> a data analysis was conducted through the SPSS statistical program using an Independent Sample T-test and Pearson Correlations. The questionnaires were distributes to both Thai (70 sets) and Swedish (70 sets) students in the University of Malardalen. The findings indicated that there is a significant difference between Thai and <b>Swedish</b> <b>consumers</b> in term of mobile phone purchasing behaviour as far as Hofstede’s cultural dimensions. A major contribution to this study is that it will provide an insight into the differences in culture between <b>Swedish</b> and Thai <b>consumers,</b> the Eastern and Western cultural divide and how culture influences mobile phone purchasing behaviour.   The findings will also assist managers in mobile phone organizations to manage the dynamics of culture through time as well as to enhance their communications and promotional strategies within an overall marketing strategy.
