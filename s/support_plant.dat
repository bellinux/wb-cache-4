5|$|The sea {{plays a part}} in {{the water}} cycle, in which water evaporates from the ocean, travels through the {{atmosphere}} as vapor, condenses, falls (usually as rain or snow) again, and then largely returns to the sea. Even in the Atacama Desert, where little rain ever falls, dense clouds of fog known as the camanchaca blow in from the sea and <b>support</b> <b>plant</b> life. In large land masses, geologic features can block the access of some regions to the main sea. These endorheic basins, particularly in central Asia, sometimes build up permanent salt lakes as inflowing waters evaporate and their dissolved minerals accumulate over time. The largest of these is the Caspian Sea, although it is sometimes counted as a proper sea owing to its basin of (now-landlocked) oceanic crust. Other notable examples include the Aral Sea in central Asia and the Great Salt Lake in the western United States. The waters of these basins still eventually return to the sea through evaporation, the flow of ground water, and (over geologic time) the opening up of the basins by continental drift.|$|E

25|$|In {{many cases}} seed predators <b>support</b> <b>plant</b> populations by {{dispersing}} seeds {{away from the}} parent plant. By dispersing seeds away from the parent plant the seed predator is in effect supporting gene flow between populations. Other seed predators collect seeds and then store or cache them for later consumption. In {{the case that the}} seed predator is unable to locate the buried or hidden seed there is a chance that it will later germinate and grow, supporting the species dispersal.|$|E
25|$|Mount Holyoke, {{like much}} of the Metacomet Ridge, is {{composed}} of basalt, also called trap rock, a volcanic rock. The mountain formed {{near the end of}} the Triassic Period with the rifting apart of the North American continent from Africa and Eurasia. Lava welled up from the rift and solidified into sheets of strata hundreds of feet thick. Subsequent faulting and earthquake activity tilted the strata, creating the dramatic cliffs and ridges of Mount Holyoke. Hot, dry upper slopes, cool, moist ravines, and mineral-rich ledges of basalt talus produce a combination of microclimate ecosystems on the mountain that <b>support</b> <b>plant</b> and animal species uncommon in greater Massachusetts. (The Metacomet Ridge article has more information on the geology and ecosystem of Mount Holyoke).|$|E
25|$|Antarctic tundra {{occurs on}} Antarctica and on several Antarctic and subantarctic islands, {{including}} South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands and the Kerguelen Islands. Most of Antarctica is too cold and dry to support vegetation, {{and most of}} the continent is covered by ice fields. However, some portions of the continent, particularly the Antarctic Peninsula, have areas of rocky soil that <b>support</b> <b>plant</b> life. The flora presently consists of around 300â€“400 lichens, 100 mosses, 25 liverworts, and around 700 terrestrial and aquatic algae species, which live on the areas of exposed rock and soil around the shore of the continent. Antarctica's two flowering plant species, the Antarctic hair grass (Deschampsia antarctica) and Antarctic pearlwort (Colobanthus quitensis), are found on the northern and western parts of the Antarctic Peninsula.|$|E

2500|$|In inland plants, {{such as that}} in Solvay, New York, the {{byproducts}} {{have been}} deposited in [...] "waste beds"; the weight of material deposited in these waste beds exceeded that of the soda ash produced by about 50%. These waste beds have led to water pollution, principally by calcium and chloride.

As such waste beds age, they do begin to <b>support</b> <b>plant</b> communities which {{have been the subject of}} several scientific studies.|$|E
2500|$|By 1853, {{most of the}} easily {{accessible}} gold had been collected, and attention turned to extracting gold from more difficult locations. Hydraulic mining was used on ancient gold-bearing gravel beds on hillsides and bluffs in the gold fields. In hydraulic mining, a high-pressure hose directed a powerful stream or jet of water at gold-bearing gravel beds. [...] It is estimated that by the mid-1880s, 11 million ounces (340t) of gold (worth approximately US$15billion at December 2010 prices) had been recovered by [...] "hydraulicking". A byproduct of these extraction methods was that large amounts of gravel, silt, heavy metals, and other pollutants went into streams and rivers. , many areas still bear the scars of hydraulic mining, since the resulting exposed earth and downstream gravel deposits do not <b>support</b> <b>plant</b> life.|$|E
2500|$|The {{origin of}} Chauncey Peak and the Metacomet Ridge dates back 200 {{million years ago}} with the rifting apart of North America from Eurasia in the process that would {{ultimately}} create the Atlantic Ocean. In the area that is now the Metacomet Ridge and surrounding sedimentary rock basin, massive basalt (traprock) lava flows spread across the prehistoric rift valley, some of them several hundred feet thick, over a period of 20 million years. [...] Sediment accumulated between lava flows and lithified into sedimentary rock. [...] After the rifting processes ceased, layers of strata faulted and tilted upward. Subsequent erosion, glaciation, and uplift exposed the weather resistant edge of the traprock lava sheets, creating the cliffline of the Metacomet Ridge as it is today. The mineral content and the shape of the ridge make possible a variety of microclimate ecosystems. Hot and dry cliff faces <b>support</b> <b>plant</b> and animal species uncommon so far north. Deeply gouged ravines support cooler climate species found in more northerly climes, while gradual backslope environments support species typical of the surrounding latitude. Talus slopes beneath cliffs accumulate minerals that support alkaline-loving plant species uncommon in surrounding acidic southern New England. Extensive cliffs provide ideal habitat and important migration corridors for raptor species.|$|E
