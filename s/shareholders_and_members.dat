40|$|At {{a virtual}} {{shareholders}} meeting {{there is no}} physical gathering of shareholders, {{but they will be}} able to assemble and vote via the internet. Together with the notice of the meeting a person can be sent a personal login code. With this code shareholders can access a heavily secured VGM platform where the AGM will take place. At this platform shareholders can find all relevant AGM information, assembly papers and a discussion forum. At the discussion forum shareholders can take cognizance of the discussion and participate therein by asking questions to the board or by reacting to the contributions of other shareholders. Members of the board can answer questions and react to the input of shareholders. Consequently, a constructive dialogue can originate between all participating parties which can contribute to the understanding of shareholders concerning the proposed decision-making. When shareholders have taken a voting decision, they can cast their votes at a separate part of the platform. All participants within the corporation, wherever they reside, are able to join the assembly at a relatively low cost. Since a VGM may last for several days, it is not required that the shareholders are all in front of their computers at the same time. The VGM has three clear advantages: 1. Savings in costs and time. Shareholders can save travelling time while corporations can save on organisation and location costs. Although establishing and using a VGM platform will be costly, a surplus will remain. It is no longer necessary for <b>shareholders</b> <b>and</b> <b>members</b> of the board to reserve a specific day in their diary. In order to follow and participate in the discussion, they only need to log on to the VGM platform on a regular basis. This will most likely result in time savings, but allows shareholders in any event to use their assembly time more flexibly. 2. The second advantage is an improvement in corporate democracy. Shareholders, wherever they reside, are able to join the meeting at relatively low costs. The thresholds for joining the assembly are lowered which may lead to an increase in the representation and participation of shareholders in the decision-making process. Due to the low costs of information distribution, the supply of information may increase and the information asymmetry will diminish. Moreover, the discussion forum offers shareholders new possibilities to provide each other with information and to unite. Shareholders will not receive additional rights, but will be able to exercise their existing rights in a more informed and balanced way. As a result of the more informed and balanced exercise of rights, the antagonism may diminish and the VGM may be, next to face-to-face contact at investor relation meetings, a platform for constructive dialogue between <b>shareholders</b> <b>and</b> <b>members</b> of the board. 3. The third advantage is an improvement in corporate governance. The consequence of a VGM is an improved corporate democracy which enables AGMs to play the role which the legislator and Code intended them to play. If the AGM will indeed fulfil this role, corporate governance will improve...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{the major}} role that {{shareholders}} play in {{both private and public}} companies, legislators in various jurisdictions emphasize the need to protect their interests and rights through different legal instruments. In this regard, the right of inquiry is a unique right granted to shareholders enabling them to better protect their interests in the company. In essence, the right of inquiry allows shareholders of a company to assess whether the company is managed according to the principles of company law, whether there has been a misconduct in the management of the company (fiduciary duties {{of the members of the}} board are especially emphasized in this case) and whether the company is managed for the benefit of all the shareholders. Once the assessment of the management of the company is complete, the right of inquiry provides just and effective reliefs in order to remedy the situation in question if misconduct has been identified. Only two countries in the European Union are known to empower shareholders with such a right – the Netherlands and Lithuania. Due to this reason, a legal analysis of the right of inquiry is necessary to determine whether it positively influences the relations between the <b>shareholders</b> <b>and</b> <b>members</b> of the board of the company and if it can be used to address the issue of conflicts of interests between the aforementioned subjects. The article examines the right of inquiry in the Netherlands and Lithuania, discusses the differences of the procedures established by the laws of each country and analyses whether the right of inquiry is an essential right for the shareholders of the company that could be introduced in the laws of other jurisdictions...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the central}} role of {{organized}} groups as intermediary bodies in American society, the constitutional right of association is surprisingly recent and limited. As the Supreme Court struggles to define the bounds of 2 ̆ 7 the 2 ̆ 7 freedom of association, it is time to take a critical look at a difficult set of questions. First, many private organizations engage in various types of selection criteria, but what subjects the Jaycees to State anti-discrimination laws but insulates the Boy Scouts of America? Second, the typical American nonprofit organization is a corporation that lacks both <b>shareholders</b> <b>and</b> <b>members,</b> so are there any 2 ̆ 7 associates 2 ̆ 7 whose rights are entitled to protection, or is the corporation 2 ̆ 7 s freedom of speech all that constitutionally matters? Third, regardless of whether an organization comprises members, not all (few?) private entities operate 2 ̆ 7 democratically 2 ̆ 7; does the law care? Finally, even if voice is democratic, how do we protect dissenters if exit is not voluntary? As we examine the structure for regulation of association {{and the role of the}} courts, we will appreciate the limits of the law in remedying private discriminatory and anti-democratic behavior. In general, the associational jurisprudence draws from our broader political structure that enshrines individual autonomy as its core norm. This Article does not, however, attempt to set out a normative prescription for creating political and moral values. For every advocate of group rights and group autonomy is an advocate of individual autonomy and protection from group tyranny. In the end, the debate leads me to caution that while we have a social and political obligation to exercise vigilance over how associations form and operate, we must recognize that our fundamental constitutional norms protect the rights of organizational autonomy in governance and functioning. The greatest challenge to a liberal society –a topic beyond the scope of this Article – will be whether and how to protect the rights of minority members of illiberal groups...|$|E

40|$|First, {{a bouquet}} for the {{illuminating}} facts presented by Professors Wert, Gaddie, and Bullock. They make dramatically clear how minuscule independent spending by corporate PACs has been (that is, those PACs’ direct spending {{as distinct from}} support by those PACs or their corporate sponsors for spending by intermediaries like the Chamber of Commerce). Their showing is borne out by experience this year: corporate support for campaigns is almost all hidden, flowing through intermediaries, which is why getting effective disclosure {{is more important than}} ever, as the Court clearly recognizes (We probably owe much to Justice Kennedy {{for the fact that the}} opinion treats disclosure as it does.). Next, applause for James Gardner’s interesting recasting of the Court’s approach. As he says, “so much has been written” in “severe criticism” of the decision, that we should turn to views that are not mere “piling on. ” But we cannot ignore the extent to which “the decision has been unfairly caricatured and may not have the direct consequences many predict. ” Those words opened an article in the Columbia Law School Magazine, presenting the views of “more than a few faculty members,” including Professor Briffault. The Columbia professors made clear that “the central holding... was neither as revolutionary nor as consequential as some critics claimed.... The floodgates... [had been] already open. ” As an election law professor at another law school wrote to me, the reaction to Citizens United has been “disproportionately rabid[,]... over-overwrought. ” None of that denies at all that the decision may well matter mightily. Independent spending by corporations and unions, although it had been extensive and legally so, expanded (in 2010, hugely) because, as election-law authority Richard Hasen put it orally: “it makes ‘the ask’ so much easier. ” I entirely join in deploring the majority opinion; but I believe we must correct the “disproportionately rabid” reaction. Consider, as an example of the sky-is-falling spin, two articles by Ronald Dworkin, a very (and rightly) highly regarded scholar: The “Devastating” Decision and The Decision That Threatens Democracy. Dworkin ignores this: more than half our fifty States allow “spending of the sort endorsed in [this] decision [and] political scientists have not been able to identify differences in corporate influence in the two sets of states. ” Are the majority of our States not democracies? “There is absolutely no distinction between those states that have bans on corporate electioneering and those that do not,” says Columbia Professor Nathaniel Persily (an election law authority). Praise is owed to scholars who (unlike those unfairly attacking the new decision by ignoring the majority of our States) have been working on what we may learn from the different States’ different laws. Last, now that we have the decision, the crucial next step is obvious: to enact the newly, acutely needed updating of federal and state disclosure requirements. The majority’s opinion makes unarguably clear that disclosure of funding sources will, even in the new deregulated regime, continue to be constitutional. And given the majority’s approach (not merely the Court’s result on this case’s hard-to-escape facts), assuring effective disclosure is more important than ever. Disclosure’s four key values have never been more clearly at stake: to provide voters with information that goes beyond the candidates’ words and past performance and that may in itself be a significant signal of future performance; to hold candidates accountable for the direct contributions they accept and to have the candidates’ explanation of any indirect, independent support; to hold accountable the deep-pocket independent supporters (wealthy individuals, corporations and unions, and special interest organizations) who use their success in the often opaque economic marketplace to pursue success in the political marketplace, which must remain open to remain democratic; and to hold corporations, unions, and other organizations accountable to <b>shareholders</b> <b>and</b> <b>members</b> for the spending of their money on political campaigns...|$|E
