40|$|Improvement {{in science}} teacher {{education}} has been called for by several <b>scientists</b> <b>and</b> science education organizations.

However, energy-related <b>scientists</b> <b>and</b> engineers report slightly higher educational attainment as well as a higher incidence of supplemental training. Energy-related engineers generally are not much older than their counterparts who did not report energy-related work.

40|$|This book {{attempts}} to study conventional and electronic information resources {{used by the}} Indian aerospace <b>scientists</b> <b>and</b> engineers of aerospace organizations of Bangalore. Aerospace is key technology today owing to its huge growth in Asia in general and India in particular. Indian <b>scientists</b> <b>and</b> engineers currently working on strategically important projects depend heavily on rapid collection of information from various e-information resources. Seeking information through e-resources is an upcoming and endearing activity. This book analyzes in detail use patterns with specific reference to various aerospace engineering e-journals and core e-databases frequently used by Indian aerospace <b>scientists</b> <b>and</b> engineers in their R&D activities. Use pattern of electronic information resources is same for <b>scientists</b> <b>and</b> engineers irrespective of their disciplines. But, aerospace <b>scientists</b> <b>and</b> engineers have an advantage as they are well exposed to the e-Environment and IT due to nature of their work itself. The use of Electronic Information Resources is highly expected from them particularly as an Integrated Information System to their learning and working environment...|$|R
