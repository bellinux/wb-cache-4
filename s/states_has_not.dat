5|$|A One Day International (ODI) is a cricket {{match between}} two {{representative}} teams, each having ODI status, {{as determined by}} the International Cricket Council (ICC). The first ODI was played between Australia and England on January 5, 1971. The United States (U.S.) played its first ODI under the captaincy of Richard Staple at the Kennington Oval, London on September 10, 2004 against New Zealand. This match occurred during the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy, which took place from September 10 to 25. The U.S. played a total of two matches during this tournament and lost both, failing to qualify for the semifinals. Since that tournament, the United <b>States</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> played any more ODIs as they have failed to regain their ODI status.|$|E
5|$|The United States, {{the winner}} of all {{previous}} editions of this event, was boycotting the games {{in response to the}} Soviet war in Afghanistan. As a result, the Soviet Union, Great Britain, and Sweden were expected to win. Australia's Quietly Confident Quartet, however, composed of backstroker Mark Kerry, breaststroker Peter Evans, butterflyer Mark Tonelli, and freestyler Neil Brooks, surprisingly won the final in 3:45.70. They were followed by the silver medalists Soviet Union, 0.22 seconds in arrears, and the bronze medalists Great Britain, as favorites Sweden had been disqualified in the heats. To date, this is the only time the United <b>States</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> won the gold medal in the event.|$|E
5|$|The Quietly Confident Quartet was the self-given {{name of the}} Australian men's 4100metres medley relay {{swimming}} {{team that}} {{won the gold medal}} at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. The United States boycotted the Moscow Olympics in protest against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and, through the 2016 Olympics, the Australian victory remains the only occasion the United <b>States</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> won the event at Olympic level since its inception in 1960. The quartet consisted of backstroker Mark Kerry, breaststroker Peter Evans, butterflyer Mark Tonelli and freestyler Neil Brooks. The team was nominally led by its oldest member Tonelli, who was 23 and was also a spokesperson for the Australian athletes' campaign for their right to compete at the Olympics against the wishes of the Fraser Government. The team was seen as an unlikely prospect to win; all four of the swimmers had clashed with swimming authorities over disciplinary issues and three experienced suspension or expulsion from the Australian team during their careers.|$|E

5|$|The son of {{prominent}} Western Australian businessman and politician Max Evans, Evans had a late start to his swimming career, making his debut at the Australian Championships {{in his hometown}} of Perth, aged 17. Despite placing second in the 100m breaststroke, he was not selected for Australia, and instead travelled to the United Kingdom to train under David Haller. During this period, he quickly improved his times and rose from outside the top 200 into the top 25 in the world rankings. Evans returned to Australia in 1980 and qualified for the Olympics in both the 100m and 200m breaststroke. A sprinter, he won the 100m in an Australian record time and showed a preference for shorter events, which required less training mileage. Evans gained a reputation for often doing fewer training laps than his coach asked of him. Having rebuffed Australian government pressure to boycott the Moscow Olympics in response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, Evans won bronze in the 100m breaststroke. His career peak came in the 4×100m medley relay, when he outsplit his opponents in the breaststroke leg of the relay, bringing Australia into contention for its eventual win, which remains the only time that the United <b>States</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> won the event at Olympic level.|$|E
25|$|The Laboratory {{may face}} {{problems}} {{in the future as}} 40 percent of its workers are slated to retire {{over the next two decades}} while since 1980 the United <b>States</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> produced enough science and engineering degrees to keep up with demand.|$|E
25|$|The United <b>States</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> officially joined as {{a member}} state of the ICC since it has not {{ratified}} the Rome Statute for the ICC.

25|$|Modern {{national}} boundaries are thus remarkably invariable, though {{the stability of}} the nation <b>states</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> followed in suit.

25|$|In modern times, the United <b>States</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> been {{receptive}} {{to the idea that}} a dog, itself, can be criminally liable. A California court explained that, although the tendency to anthropomorphize animals is understandable, especially with beloved pets like dogs, the law does not recognize dogs as having the mental state that can incur criminal liability. That is, although dogs and other animals may have the capacity to commit vicious and violent acts, they do not possess the legal ability to commit crimes.|$|E
25|$|Because the United <b>States</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> {{ratified}} the Basel Convention or its Ban Amendment, and has few domestic federal laws forbidding {{the export of}} toxic waste, the Basel Action Network estimates that about 80% of the electronic waste directed to recycling in the U.S. does not get recycled there at all, but is put on container ships and sent to countries such as China. This figure is disputed as an exaggeration by the EPA, the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries, and the World Reuse, Repair and Recycling Association.|$|E
25|$|The 2007 {{election}} {{was criticized for}} having been conducted under a constitution that was not approved by the Secretary of the Interior. On May 22, 2007, the Cherokee Nation received notice from the BIA that the Cherokee Nation's amendments to the 1975 Cherokee Nation Constitution were rejected because they required BIA approval, which had not been obtained. The BIA also stated concerns that the Cherokee Nation had excluded the Cherokee Freedmen from voting for the constitutional amendments, since they had been improperly shorn of their rights of citizenship years earlier and {{were not allowed to}} participate in the constitutional referendum. This is considered a violation of the 1970 Principal Chiefs Act, which requires that all tribal members must vote. Chief Smith disbanded the Judicial Appeals Tribunal and created a new Cherokee Supreme Court under the new Constitution. A question remains regarding the legitimacy of the Court as the United <b>States</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> approved the Constitution as required under the previous Cherokee Constitution.|$|E

500|$|IFRS {{is based}} on [...] "understandability, relevance, materiality, reliability, and comparability".

500|$|Circuit courts do not {{collaborate}} or {{work with}} other circuits to resolve legal issues, and different circuit courts may reach conflicting conclusions about the same legal issue. Furthermore, cases decided in one circuit are not binding authority on other circuits. If the Supreme Court of the United <b>States</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> ruled on a legal issue, federal courts of appeals resolve these issues [...] "as they see fit, subject only to a norm of intracircuit stare decisis." [...] When a circuit split occurs, there is rarely an even numeric division among courts of appeals with regard to how the dispute should be resolved. In fact, {{one study found that}} courts of appeals split evenly in less than one third of all circuit splits. Occasionally, separate courts of appeals will reach three or more different conclusions with regard to the same legal issue.|$|E
500|$|Congress {{drew the}} three {{permutations}} of combat from President Kennedy's executive order of April 25, 1962, which previously added the same criteria to the Purple Heart. On August 24, Kennedy added similar {{criteria for the}} Bronze Star Medal. The amendment was necessary because Cold War armed conflicts did not qualify for consideration under previous statutes such as the 1918 Army Medal of Honor Statute that required valor [...] "in action involving actual conflict with an enemy", since the United <b>States</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> formally declared war since World War II {{as a result of}} the provisions of the United Nations Charter. According to congressional testimony by the Army's Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel, the services were seeking authority to award the Medal of Honor and other valor awards retroactive to July 1, 1958, in areas such as Berlin, Lebanon, Quemoy and Matsu Islands, Taiwan Straits, Congo, Laos, Vietnam, and Cuba.|$|E
