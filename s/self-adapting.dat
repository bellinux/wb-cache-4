40|$|Floquet {{dynamics}} of a quantum system subject to periodic modulations of system parameters provide {{a powerful tool}} for engineering new quantum matter with exotic properties. While system dynamics are significantly altered, the periodic modulation itself is usually induced externally and independent of Floquet dynamics. Here we propose a new type of Floquet physics for a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) subject to a shaken lattice generated inside a cavity, where the shaken lattice and atomic Floquet bands are mutually dependent, resulting in <b>self-adapted</b> Floquet dynamics. In particular, the shaken lattice induces Floquet quasi-energy bands for the BEC, whose back action leads to a <b>self-adapted</b> dynamical normal-superradiant phase transition for the shaken lattice. Such <b>self-adapted</b> Floquet dynamics show two surprising and unique features: i) the normal-superradiant phase transition possesses a hysteresis even without atom interactions; ii) the dynamical atom-cavity steady state could exist at free energy maxima. The atom interactions strongly affect the phase transition of the BEC from zero to finite momenta. Our results provide a powerful platform for exploring <b>self-adapted</b> Floquet dynamics, which may open an avenue for engineering novel quantum materials. Comment: 10 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that, when {{administered}} a <b>self-adapted</b> test, a few examinees will choose item difficulty levels that are not well-matched to their proficiencies, resulting in high standard errors of proficiency estimation. This study investigated whether the previously observed effects of a <b>self-adapted</b> test [...] lower anxiety and higher test performance relative to a computerized adaptive test (CAT) [...] can be sustained while eliminating the high standard errors. A restricted <b>self-adapted</b> test (RS-AT) in which examinees were allowed to choose among a set of difficulty levels only {{in the region of}} their proficiency estimates was utilized in this study. Data were collected from 273 students in an introductory statistics class.

40|$|International audienceThe {{reduction}} {{of the number of}} oscillating modes by a <b>self-adapted</b> Fabry–Perot (FP) filter was first demonstrated in a dye laser in 1987 [Opt. Lett. 12 (1987) 117]. A renewal of interest in this technique arose recently with the observation of a dramatic {{reduction of}} the number of modes in a pulsed Sapphire:Ti laser [Appl. Phys B 69 (1999) 155]. A <b>self-adapted</b> Fabry–Perot filter is made of a photorefractive crystal inserted inside a linear laser cavity between the amplifier and the output coupler. This coupler acts as one mirror of this Fabry–Perot while the Bragg reflection grating recorded by the standing waves inside the crystal plays the role of the second mirror. The dynamic properties of the photorefractive effect make this Fabry–Perot continuously adapted to the oscillating modes. Its spectral reflectivity reinforces the competition between these modes which, in some cases, leads to a single-mode operation. We analyze the laser mode competition taking into account the laser gain properties and the wavelength dependence of the cavity losses induced by the <b>self-adapted</b> Fabry–Perot...|$|R
30|$|Some {{battery-powered}} sensor nodes do {{not easily}} accommodate battery recharging or frequent battery replacement. This necessitates that the routing algorithm considers energy efficiency. Due to their low cost, sensor nodes usually have limited memory, which {{requires that the}} routing algorithm is simple and has low information storage requirements. WSNHA coverage is generally small, and the sensor node distribution depends on the house structure and the application, requiring a routing algorithm that can <b>self-adapt</b> to the node distribution. Link instability can be an issue because signal propagation inside a room encounters greater reflection, diffraction, and dispersion than does that outdoors, especially when the occupants are at home. This requires that the routing algorithm be able to <b>self-adapt</b> to link instability.|$|R
50|$|Self-tuning (<b>self-adapting)</b> {{systems of}} {{automatic}} control are systems whereby adaptation to randomly changing conditions is performed {{by means of}} automatically changing parameters or via automatically determining their optimum configuration 1. In any non-self-tuning automatic control system there are parameters which have an influence on system stability and control quality and which can be tuned. If these parameters remain constant whilst operating conditions (such as input signals or different characteristics of controlled objects) are substantially varying, control can degrade or even become unstable. Manual tuning is often cumbersome and sometimes impossible. In such cases, not only is using self-tuning systems technically and economically worthwhile, {{but it could be}} the only means of robust control. Self-tuning systems can be with or without parameter determination.|$|E

40|$|The {{approach}} of tracking maneuvering targets {{based on the}} “Current” Statistical (CS) model is widely used. The method needs to preset maneuvering frequency and maximum acceleration based on experience.

In order to tackle the problem, this paper initially deduces a <b>self-adapting</b> maneuvering frequency algorithm from the discrete state equation of the CS model. Then, an improved <b>self-adapting</b> acceleration covariance algorithm is presented. Simulation results show that, by using the <b>self-adapting</b> maneuvering frequency algorithm and the improved <b>self-adapting</b> acceleration covariance algorithm to track targets simultaneously, the ability to self-adapt to the fluctuation of the moving state will be improved.

40|$|Abstract:- Although the Differential Evolution (DE) {{algorithm}} {{has been}} shown to be a simple yet powerful evolutionary algorithm for optimizing continuous functions, users are still faced with the problem of preliminary testing and hand-tuning of the evolutionary parameters prior to commencing the actual optimization process. As a solution, self-adaptation has been found to be highly beneficial in automatically and dynamically adjusting evolutionary parameters such as crossover rates and mutation rates. In this paper, we present a first attempt at <b>self-adapting</b> the population size parameter in addition to <b>self-adapting</b> crossover and mutation rates. Firstly, our main objective is to demonstrate the feasibility of <b>self-adapting</b> the population size parameter in DE. Using the F 1 -F 5 benchmark test problems proposed by De Jong, we showed that DE with self-adaptive populations produced highly competitive results compared to a conventional DE algorithm with static populations. In addition to reducing the number of parameters used in DE, the proposed algorithm actually outperformed the conventional DE algorithm for one of the test problems. It was also found that that an absolute encoding methodology for <b>self-adapting</b> population size in DE produced results with greater optimization reliability compared to a relative encoding methodology...|$|E
