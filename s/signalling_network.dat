40|$|Background: <b>Signaling</b> <b>networks</b> are {{designed}} to sense an environmental stimulus and adapt to it. We propose and study a minimal model of <b>signaling</b> <b>network</b> that can sense and respond to external stimuli of varying strength in an adaptive manner. The structure of this minimal network is derived based on some simple assumptions on its differential response to external stimuli. Methodology: We employ stochastic differential equations and probability distributions obtained from stochastic simulations to characterize differential signaling response in our minimal network model. Gillespie’s stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) is used in this study. Conclusions/Significance: We show that the proposed minimal <b>signaling</b> <b>network</b> displays two distinct types of response as {{the strength of the}} stimulus is decreased. The <b>signaling</b> <b>network</b> has a deterministic part that undergoes rapid activation by a strong stimulus in which case cell-to-cell fluctuations can be ignored. As the strength of the stimulus decreases, the stochastic part of the network begins dominating the signaling response where slow activation is observed with characteristic large cell-to-cell stochastic variability.

40|$|Abstract Background In systems biology the experimentalist is {{presented}} with a selection of software for analyzing dynamic properties of <b>signaling</b> <b>networks.</b> These tools either assume that the network is in steady-state or require highly parameterized models of the network of interest. For biologists interested in assessing how signal propagates through a network under specific conditions, the first class of methods does not provide sufficiently detailed results and the second class requires models {{which may not be}} easily and accurately constructed. A tool that is able to characterize the dynamics of a <b>signaling</b> <b>network</b> using an unparameterized model of the network would allow biologists to quickly obtain insights into a <b>signaling</b> <b>network's</b> behavior. Results We introduce PathwayOracle, an integrated suite of software tools for computationally inferring and analyzing structural and dynamic properties of a <b>signaling</b> <b>network.</b> The feature which differentiates PathwayOracle from other tools is a method that can predict the response of a <b>signaling</b> <b>network</b> to various experimental conditions and stimuli using only the connectivity of the <b>signaling</b> <b>network.</b> Thus <b>signaling</b> models are relatively easy to build. The method allows for tracking signal flow in a network and comparison of signal flows under different experimental conditions. In addition, PathwayOracle includes tools for the enumeration and visualization of coherent and incoherent signaling paths between proteins, and for experimental analysis – loading and superimposing experimental data, such as microarray intensities, on the network model. Conclusion PathwayOracle provides an integrated environment in which both structural and dynamic analysis of a <b>signaling</b> <b>network</b> can be quickly conducted and visualized along side experimental results. By using the <b>signaling</b> <b>network</b> connectivity, analyses and predictions can be performed quickly using relatively easily constructed <b>signaling</b> <b>network</b> models. The application has been developed in Python and is designed to be easily extensible by groups interested in adding new or extending existing features.

40|$|Regulatory motifs are {{patterns}} of activation and inhibition that appear repeatedly in various <b>signaling</b> <b>networks</b> and that show specific regulatory properties. However, the network structures of regulatory motifs are highly diverse and complex, rendering their identification difficult. Here, {{we present a}} RMOD, a web-based system for the identification of regulatory motifs and their properties in <b>signaling</b> <b>networks.</b> RMOD finds various network structures of regulatory motifs by compressing the <b>signaling</b> <b>network</b> and detecting the compressed forms of regulatory motifs.

Fitting additional trains to this very tight network would not be possible without disrupting the entire network, as the length of the service would increase, missing the connections to the mainline services. This would mean that a new 15-minute shuttle service between Norwich and Rackheath would have to be created; however, this would interrupt the main service and cause additional platforming problems. Finding extra trains to run this service and finding extra space on the platforms at Norwich railway station to house these extra trains poses additional problems, as during peak hours all platforms are currently used.|$|E

Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling is involved in a variety of human diseases extending far beyond immune system-related diseases, affecting a number of different tissues and cell-types. Computational models often do not account for cell-type specific differences in <b>signaling</b> <b>networks.</b> Investigation of these differences and its phenotypic implications could increase understanding of cell signaling and processes such as inflammation. The wealth of knowledge for TLR signaling has been recently summarized in a stoichiometric <b>signaling</b> <b>network</b> applicable for constraint-based modeling and analysis (COBRA). COBRA methods have been applied to investigate tissue-specific metabolism using omics data integration. Comparable approaches have not been conducted using <b>signaling</b> <b>networks.</b> In this study, we present ihsTLRv 2, an updated TLR <b>signaling</b> <b>network</b> accounting for the association of 314 genes with 558 network reactions.
