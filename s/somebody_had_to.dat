500|$|Filming {{commenced}} on 20 August 1968 after {{a summer}} of pre-production. Director Ken Turner, who headed the location unit, recalled that The Secret Service became a complex series to shoot because it incorporated three design elements (studio puppet filming, studio special effects filming and live-action location filming). In a reversal to the practice used on earlier Supermarionation productions, location filming needed to be completed first before work could start at the Century 21 Studios. In Turner's words, [...] "We felt that <b>somebody</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> take the location stuff by the balls, get it shot and then hand {{it over to the}} director to fit his puppet stuff in.

Evans wore a prosthetic jaw while filming the scene to cover the beard he had grown. Shawarma sales in Los Angeles, St. Louis, and Boston reportedly skyrocketed in the days following the film's release. Whedon stated the inspiration for the shawarma scene came from the events surrounding the filming of the scene where Fred dies in Wesley's arms in the Angel episode, [...] "A Hole in the World". After filming the scene, Whedon and actors Amy Acker and Denisof, who portrayed Fred and Wesley, respectively, [...] "went out for drinks and ended up just sitting around quietly, exhausted from the day's events," [...] which Whedon then mimicked in the scene for the film.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{praised the}} {{character}} development of Shane in the episode, {{as well as}} the execution of Otis. Nate Rawlings of Time felt that it was a dark moment for the series, and felt that it added anticipation to future development. He wrote: [...] "At some point, Shane will have to come clean with Rick about what happened to Otis. Given Rick’s extremely rigid morale [...] code and Shane’s now demonstrated willingness {{to do whatever it takes}} to survive, the showdown promises to be bigger than just a battle of two alpha males. The Rick/Shane divide is a battle of two leaders with different ideas of humanity and survival." [...] Mark Maurer of The Star-Ledger opined that [...] "both the multi-layered opening [...] illustrates how Shane’s impulsive nature makes him a valuable if ruthless warrior." [...] Handlen appreciated the character development of Shane, writing, [...] "Shane has long been the dark horse of the group, the one most likely to go off the morality reservation, and this reveal works well to bring him that much closer to darkness. It's not the subtlest moment [...] but, given how friendly and cool Otis was, and given how well the two seemed to be working together, it's a strong twist." [...] He added that because of the death of Otis, the show now has a sense of direction. [...] "His decision to sacrifice Otis is easy enough to rationalize; <b>somebody</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> get back for Carl's sake, Shane was faster, and both of them probably weren't going to make it. That's the beauty of it. In a certain light, he made the right choice." [...] Morgan Jeffrey wrote: [...] "This week's installment delivered even more scares than usual — Shane's escape from the high school was almost unbearably tense." ...|$|E

Though Kharlamov finished the game, he missed the seventh game and was largely ineffective in the eighth. When asked about the slash years later, Clarke said, [...] "If I hadn't learned to lay on a two-hander once in a while, I'd never have left Flin Flon." [...] 30 years after the series, Henderson criticized Clarke, calling the slash, [...] "the low point of the series." [...] Clarke responded saying that he thought it was [...] "improper to criticize a teammate thirty years later," [...] and that he did not [...] "understand why he would bring it up now." [...] Henderson has since retracted his criticism. Kharlamov, prior to his death in 1981, said he thought Clarke was tasked with [...] "taking me out of the game." [...] John Ferguson, Sr., an assistant coach with Team Canada in 1972, said, [...] "I called Clarke over to the bench, looked over at Kharlamov and said, 'I think he needs a tap on the ankle.'
