5|$|Piłsudski {{had given}} Poland <b>something</b> <b>akin</b> <b>to</b> what Henryk Sienkiewicz's Onufry Zagłoba had mused about: a Polish Oliver Cromwell. As such, the Marshal had inevitably drawn both intense loyalty and intense vilification.|$|E
5|$|Following Santer, Romano Prodi took office. The Amsterdam Treaty had {{increased}} the Commission's powers and Prodi was dubbed {{by the press}} as <b>something</b> <b>akin</b> <b>to</b> a Prime Minister. Powers were strengthened again with the Nice Treaty in 2001 giving the Presidents more power over the composition of their Commissions.|$|E
5|$|Chocolina was {{originally}} {{meant to be}} a waitress in Serendipity, but her design impressed Toriyama enough that he expanded her role into <b>something</b> <b>akin</b> <b>to</b> a shop clerk, and the director wrote a new backstory and new dialogue for her. Isamu Kamikokuryo said that though Chocolina's jovial manner and scanty outfit at times clashed with the game's overall atmosphere, he felt she was a good inclusion. Chocolina is voiced by Julie Nathanson in English and Seiko Ueda in Japanese.|$|E

50|$|The {{band had}} a diverse, genre-defying sound, with {{the songs on}} their albums {{crossing}} from pop to hard rock <b>to</b> <b>something</b> almost <b>akin</b> <b>to</b> punk.|$|R
5|$|The NDH {{government}} struck {{upon the}} idea of trying to re-educate these children to become <b>something</b> <b>akin</b> <b>to</b> an Ustaše version of the Hitler Youth, thereby turning them against their Serb parents. The regime saw this as a more effective way of placing pressure on the Yugoslav Partisan movement than killing the children outright. However, the NDH regime had not made any arrangements to implement this idea, so {{the establishment of a}} children's camp was done in haste, especially as there was strong pressure to do something for the children. NDH regime propaganda advanced the idea that the children were being liberated from slavery {{at the hands of the}} Partisans.|$|E
25|$|Mohammed Ali, the Ottoman Governor of Egypt, began {{rebuilding}} the city around 1810, and by 1850, Alexandria {{had returned to}} <b>something</b> <b>akin</b> <b>to</b> its former glory.|$|E
25|$|Whilst nursing has modernised significantly, {{the image}} of nursing can remain steadfastly {{considered}} as <b>something</b> <b>akin</b> <b>to</b> Hattie Jacques in a Carry on film such as Carry On Matron.|$|E
5000|$|MTV Geek said it [...] "is {{probably}} the most spot-on film treatment of the hockey-masked avenger you will ever find. With superior acting, cinematography, and direction, {{it is more than}} just another fan film -- but rather <b>something</b> more <b>akin</b> <b>to</b> TMNT as done by Martin Scorsese." ...|$|R
6000|$|And in a {{few seconds}} he sank down again and grew flighty of speech. One of our people was at last {{penetrated}} with <b>something</b> vaguely <b>akin</b> <b>to</b> compassion, may be, for he looked out through the gratings at the guardian officer, pacing to and fro, and said: ...|$|R
60|$|We had {{advanced}} boldly on this last {{stage of the}} journey, emboldened {{to do so by}} the evidences of panic, or <b>something</b> near <b>akin</b> <b>to</b> it, which we saw on every hand, and trusting to the possibility that if seen it would be believed that we belonged to the encampment.|$|R
25|$|Many writers, {{including}} Lactantius, Cyprian of Carthage, Augustine, Marsilio Ficino, Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, Giordano Bruno, Campanella, Sir Thomas Browne, and Ralph Waldo Emerson, considered Hermes Trismegistus to be a wise pagan prophet who foresaw {{the coming}} of Christianity. St. Thomas Aquinas reported that Trismegistus arrived at <b>something</b> <b>akin</b> <b>to</b> {{the doctrine of the}} Trinity.|$|E
25|$|Hogan has {{emphasised}} that {{it would}} be very strange if all fundamental constants were strictly determined, since this would leave us with no ready explanation for apparent fine tuning. In fact we might have to resort to <b>something</b> <b>akin</b> <b>to</b> Barrow and Tipler's SAP: there would be no option for such a universe not to support life.|$|E
25|$|In public health, he {{advocated}} establishing a medical administrative authority, with powers over epidemiology and veterinary medicine. He worked {{to set up}} a coherent medical training program, oriented towards public health and preventive measures. In economic policy, he proposed tax reforms and a national insurance program, and discussed the balance of trade. He even proposed <b>something</b> <b>akin</b> <b>to</b> what much later emerged as game theory. In sociology he laid the ground for communication theory.|$|E
6000|$|... "I never {{voted against}} my party but once," [...] said Phineas, [...] "and then I {{did it with}} the {{approbation}} of every man in it for whose good opinion I cared a straw." [...] There was insult in his tone as he said this, and <b>something</b> near <b>akin</b> <b>to</b> insult in his words.|$|R
5000|$|All {{this seems}} to force upon us an {{interpretation}} of Hegel that would understand his term [...] "min"' {{as some kind of}} cosmic consciousness; not, of course, a traditional conception of God as a being separate from the universe, but rather as <b>something</b> more <b>akin</b> <b>to</b> those eastern philosophies that insist that All is One.|$|R
60|$|To the bully’s {{surprise}} Dave {{did not get}} excited. On the contrary, our hero’s face showed <b>something</b> {{that was}} <b>akin</b> <b>to</b> a faint smile. Ben saw it and wondered at it.|$|R
25|$|More wrote two autobiographies, Happy Go Lucky (1959) and More or Less (1978). In {{the second}} book he related {{how he had}} had since childhood, a {{recurrent}} dream of <b>something</b> <b>akin</b> <b>to</b> a huge wasp descending towards him. During the war he experienced a Nazi Stuka dive-bomber descending in just such a manner. After that he claimed never to have had that dream again. Producer Daniel M. Angel successfully sued More for libel in 1980 over comments made in his second autobiography.|$|E
25|$|Dawkins {{interviews}} Haggard {{and begins}} by likening the worship experience to a Nuremberg Rally of which Goebbels {{might have been}} proud. Haggard says he knows nothing of the Nuremberg Rallies {{and goes on to}} say that some evangelicals think of his services as <b>something</b> <b>akin</b> <b>to</b> rock concerts. Haggard said the Bible is true and doesn't contradict itself as science does. Dawkins contends that the advantage of science is that new evidence changes ideas, allowing the advancement of human knowledge, something religion does not allow. Steadily the exchanges become increasingly fractious.|$|E
25|$|Naturally, in an {{organisation}} {{of critical}} thinkers that has endured for a century, {{the existence of}} some disagreement is inevitable. Indeed, it would be true {{to say that a}} fair number of internal debates and disagreements have arisen in the Socialist Party concerning issues not covered by the Declaration of Principles and not addressed in the initial membership test – in other words, issues which are somewhat peripheral or incidental rather than core and fundamental. These issues have included the Party's exact attitude to trade unionism, its view of capitalist economic crises, and – in more recent years – whether <b>something</b> <b>akin</b> <b>to</b> law will exist in socialist society.|$|E
60|$|The {{attendant}} {{looked up}} and turned his strange dark eyes upon his questioner. They were vitreous, with a misty dry shininess, such as Smith had never seen in a human head before. As he gazed into them he saw some strong emotion gather in their depths, which rose and deepened until it broke into a look of <b>something</b> <b>akin</b> both <b>to</b> horror and to hatred.|$|R
6000|$|I had {{no heart}} {{to go after}} him, {{and sat down in}} the hedge. There was <b>something</b> subtly <b>akin</b> <b>to</b> her in the fresh {{darkness}} of the young night; the soft bank, the scent of honeysuckle, the touch of the ferns and brambles. Death comes to all of us, and when it's over it's over; but this blind business--of those left behind! ...|$|R

25|$|Alexandria figured {{prominently}} in the military operations of Napoleon's expedition to Egypt in 1798. French troops stormed the city on 2 July 1798, and it remained in their hands until {{the arrival of a}} British expedition in 1801. The British won a considerable victory over the French at the Battle of Alexandria on 21 March 1801, following which they besieged the city, which fell to them on 2 September 1801. Muhammad Ali, the Ottoman governor of Egypt, began rebuilding and redevelopment around 1810, and by 1850, Alexandria had returned to <b>something</b> <b>akin</b> <b>to</b> its former glory. Egypt turned to Europe in their effort to modernize the country. Greeks, followed by other Europeans and others, began moving to the city. In the early 20th century, the city became a home for novelists and poets.|$|E
500|$|Martin told The Georgia Straight {{that the}} group are [...] "afflicted with <b>something</b> <b>akin</b> <b>to</b> musical attention-deficit disorder" [...] and said {{that the group}} [...] "get bored quite easily [...] with [...] own records at times". He {{elaborated}} by saying that the group aren't [...] "really interested in reproducing the same sound" [...] because they don't find it exciting.|$|E
500|$|The fifth vessel, Warship Number 797, {{was planned}} as an {{improved}} Shinano but was never laid down. In {{addition to the}} modifications made to that ship, 797 would have removed the two [...] wing turrets in favor of additional 100mm guns; authors William Garzke and Robert Dulin estimate that this would have allowed for 24 of these weapons. Yamato was eventually modified in 1944 to <b>something</b> <b>akin</b> <b>to</b> this.|$|E
50|$|An {{example of}} one of these contradictions is in Superman's {{relationship}} with those he protects. In this book, Seagle makes mention of Superman's role as protector of the people, but he sees this more as an example of imposing a lifestyle on people against their will, <b>something</b> more <b>akin</b> <b>to</b> fascism. Other meditations on Superman include his approach to power, justice, alienation, and escape.|$|R
5000|$|On Andrew Leahey's review: [...] "'Take Us to the Start' sounds best at {{its most}} brisk, when Hires trades the coffeehouse {{aspirations}} of his slower songs for <b>something</b> more <b>akin</b> <b>to</b> driving, mainstream pop/rock. The bulk of this debut album is filled with semi-ballads, though, whose leisurely pace allows Hires more room to indulge a bit too heavily in the influence of his Hotel Café contemporaries." ...|$|R
50|$|During the 17th century, composers {{continued}} to produce canzonettas, but the form gradually {{changed from a}} madrigalian, a cappella genre <b>to</b> <b>something</b> more <b>akin</b> <b>to</b> a monody, or even a cantata. Eventually, the canzonetta became a type of song for solo voice and accompaniment. A late example of the form {{can be seen in}} the two sets of six by Joseph Haydn for voice and piano, on English texts (1794-5).|$|R
500|$|A long-running {{rivalry between}} Tikal and Calakmul {{began in the}} 6th century, {{with each of the}} two cities forming its own network of {{mutually}} hostile alliances arrayed against each other in what has been likened to a long-running war between two Maya superpowers. The kings of these two capitals adopted the title kaloomte, a term that has not been precisely translated but that implies <b>something</b> <b>akin</b> <b>to</b> [...] "high king".|$|E
500|$|Hayden and his 1871 party {{recognized}} Yellowstone as a priceless treasure {{that would}} become rarer with time. He wished for others to see and experience it as well. Eventually the railroads and, some time after that, the automobile would make that possible. The Park was not set aside strictly for ecological purposes; however, the designation [...] "pleasure ground" [...] was not an invitation to create an amusement park. Hayden imagined <b>something</b> <b>akin</b> <b>to</b> the scenic resorts and baths in England, Germany, and Switzerland.|$|E
500|$|StarCraft: Brood War was {{critically}} acclaimed. The magazine PC Zone gave Brood War a {{short but}} flattering review, describing it as having [...] "definitely been worth the wait". PC Zone praised {{the inclusion of}} new units and the balancing tweaks as transforming the original StarCraft [...] "from an okay game into <b>something</b> <b>akin</b> <b>to</b> the mutt's nuts". The review also drew note to the cinematic cut scenes, stating that they [...] "actually feel like {{part of the story}} rather than an afterthought".|$|E
50|$|In {{the eighteenth}} century the game reappeared, largely due to support from Tokugawa Yoshimune. By this time it had evolved from a polo-like game (using mallets) <b>to</b> <b>something</b> more <b>akin</b> <b>to</b> lacrosse. During this period, dakyu was {{considered}} a corollary to military training (training {{the skills needed to}} wield a spear from horseback). This aspect was downplayed in the Meiji era, when the game again lost favour; today, it survives only as a cultural asset.|$|R
60|$|And whilst, breathless with parted {{lips and}} {{galloping}} bosom, she observed me, <b>something</b> near <b>akin</b> <b>to</b> terror in her eyes, I stamped about that room and raved and heaped abuse and recriminations upon myself, ending by going down upon my knees to her, imploring her forgiveness for the thing I had done--believing like a fatuous fool {{that it was}} all my doing--and imploring her still more passionately to leave me and to go.|$|R
5000|$|Fangoria {{commented that}} the found footage format was {{integral}} to the story and <b>something</b> more <b>akin</b> <b>to</b> an emotional POV, stating that [...] "the camera uniquely acts as an almost-transparent bridge between you and a character's psyche." [...] Moveable Fest says the movie [...] "terrifies existentially." [...] Ion Cinema states that [...] "the unnerving quality of Sarah Adina Smith's directorial debut occurs mostly in its aftereffects, leaving us with the profound, less earthbound implications in its final few moments." ...|$|R
