40|$|This paper {{presents}} an algorithm for solid model reconstruction from 2 D <b>sectional</b> <b>views</b> based on volume-based approach. None {{of the existing}} work in automatic reconstruction from 2 D orthographic <b>views</b> have addressed <b>sectional</b> <b>views</b> in detail. It is believed that the volume-based approach is better suited to handle different types of <b>sectional</b> <b>views.</b> The volume-based approach constructs the 3 D solid by a boolean combination of elementary solids. The elementary solids are formed by sweep operation on loops identified in the input views. The only adjustment {{to be made for}} the presence of <b>sectional</b> <b>views</b> is in the identification of loops that would form the elemental solids. In the algorithm, the conventions of engineering drawing for <b>sectional</b> <b>views,</b> are used to identify the loops correctly. The algorithm is simple and intuitive in nature. Results have been obtained for full sections, offset sections and half sections. Future work will address other types of <b>sectional</b> <b>views</b> such as removed and revolved sections and broken-out sections. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} reduce the time of {{mechanical}} product design and ensure the high quality of their assembly drawings, this paper develops an intelligent approach for generating assembly drawings automatically from three-dimensional (3 -D) computer assembly models of mechanical products by simulating the experienced human designer's thinking mode with the aid of computer graphics and knowledge-based expert system. The key issues include the strategies and methods for selecting the necessary views in an assembly drawing, determining necessary <b>sectional</b> <b>views</b> in each view, eliminating the unreasonable projective overlap of the components in each view, and minimizing the numbers of both the views in an assembly drawing and the <b>sectional</b> <b>views</b> in each view. Based on the approach, corresponding software prototype was developed. Finally, it is demonstrated, from an example of the fixture in a modularized drilling machine, that its assembly drawing was generated successfully using this intelligent software prototype. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

50|$|Increasing {{frame rate}} in B-mode {{is done by}} {{reducing}} line density, i.e. lateral resolution, and thus making the method more angle dependent. Finally, the method on some applications {{is dependent on the}} ROI (Region Of Interest) size and shape. In principle Speckle tracking is available for deformation measurement in all directions, however, due to the limitation of lateral resolution in apical images, measuring circumferential and transmural deformation needs parasternal cross <b>sectional</b> <b>views.</b> On the other hand, compared to Tissue Doppler, that method is mainly only available for longitudinal measures from the apical position.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a two-step, semi-automated method for reconstructing a three-dimensional (3 D) {{shape of the}} prostate from a 3 D transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) image. While the method has been developed for prostate ultrasound imaging, it can potentially be applicable to any other organ {{of the body and}} other imaging modalities. The proposed method takes as input a 3 D TRUS image and generates a watertight 3 D surface model of the prostate. In the first step, the system lets the user visualize and navigate through the input volumetric image by displaying cross <b>sectional</b> <b>views</b> oriented in arbitrary directions. The user then draws partial/full contours on selected cross <b>sectional</b> <b>views.</b> In the second step, the method automatically generates a watertight 3 D surface of the prostate by fitting a deformable spherical template to the set of user-specified contours. Since the method allows the user to select the best cross-sectional directions and draw only clearly recognizable partial or full contours, the user can avoid time-consuming and inaccurate guesswork on where prostate contours are located. By avoiding the usage of noisy, incomprehensible portions of the TRUS image, the proposed method yields more accurate prostate shapes than conventional methods that demand complete cross-sectional contours selected manually, or automatically using an image processing tool. Our experiments confirmed that a 3 D watertight surface of the prostate can be generated within five minutes even from a volumetric image {{with a high level of}} speckles and shadow noises...|$|R

From the topographic images recorded in AFM contact mode, it is possible to determine the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness at each of the sample surfaces. The sample surface structure was also investigated by SEM, and the coating thicknesses were obtained from SEM cross <b>sectional</b> <b>views.</b> The grain size was measured both with AFM and SEM, obtaining consistent results.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A high {{resolution}} optical {{system has been}} designed and deveioped for imaging pulsed ultrasonic fields transmitted in water by piezoelectric transducers. The particle displacement was measured by a compact heterodyne interferometer whose probe beam is reflected by a thin membrane immersed {{in front of the}} transducer. Experiments camed out on focused or planar transducers demonstrate the capability of the system to map acoustic fields both in time and spatial domains. The spatial resolution and the dynamic range reached 20 p m and 45 dB and the bandwidth can be enlarged up to 40 MHz. Results are presented in various cross <b>sectional</b> <b>views</b> (B-scans, C-scans and 3 D profiles). 1...|$|R
