40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{technical}} and economic feasibility of the installation of an innovative thermal concentrating solar system (TCSS) for high pressure steam production in a dairy is discussed. The production of soft cheese takes place thanks to the injection of saturated steam into washtubs that are filled with semi-finished materials. The steam is produced in natural gas fired tube boilers and is evidently lost and make-up fresh treated water at atmospheric conditions is required. In this context, the installation of a TCSS based on the technology of the linear Fresnel concentrating systems is proposed to provide part of the required steam and, consequently, to reduce the consumption of the fossil fuel improving the process environmental performances. To this purpose, the piping integration {{of the new system}} in the original one has been analyzed in detail respecting the essential safety requirements in accordance with the guidelines of the Pressurized Equipment Directive (PED) and maintaining the required service level to the thermal end-user. In order to assure a satisfying exploitation of the <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> <b>source,</b> the adoption of a storage system based on a pressurized vessel containing a mixture of water and steam has been considered and optimized from a technical and economic point of view.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a model is {{developed}} {{to solve the}} on/off scheduling of (non-linear) dynamic electric loads based on predictions of the power delivery of a (standalone) <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> <b>source.</b> Knowledge of variations in the solar power output is used to optimally select the timing and the combinations {{of a set of}} given electric loads, where each load has a desired dynamic power profile. The optimization exploits the desired power profiles of the electric loads in terms of dynamic power ramp up/down and minimum time on/off of each load to track a finite number of load switching combinations over a moving finite prediction horizon. Subsequently, a user-specified optimization function with possible power constraints is evaluated over the finite number of combinations to allow for real-time computation of the optimal timing and switching of loads.
