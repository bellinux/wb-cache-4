5|$|Pigeonhole sort, {{counting}} sort, radix sort, and Van Emde Boas tree sorting {{all work}} best when the key <b>size</b> <b>is</b> small; for large enough keys, they become slower than comparison sorting algorithms. However, when the key size or the word <b>size</b> <b>is</b> very large {{relative to the}} number of items (or equivalently when the number of items is small), it may again become possible to sort quickly, using different algorithms that take advantage of the parallelism inherent in the ability to perform arithmetic operations on large words.|$|E

5|$|Today, {{the blue}} whale is renowned {{for being the}} largest animal ever to have lived. In part because of its legendary status, many misconceptions still exist. For example, its <b>size</b> <b>is</b> often exaggerated. Many popular sources give the maximum length as 110 feet (33.5 meters) or more. While such lengths were {{reported}} in the whaling records, they were not scientifically verified and were probably exaggerated. Virtually all books and articles that mention the blue whale claim that it can reach 100 feet (30.5 meters). This is probably true (the largest verified specimen was 29.9 meters, 98 feet) but is highly misleading as the average <b>size</b> <b>is</b> much smaller.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians {{possess a}} pancreas, liver and gall bladder. The liver is usually large with two lobes. Its <b>size</b> <b>is</b> {{determined}} by its {{function as a}} glycogen and fat storage unit, and may change with the seasons as these reserves are built or used up. Adipose tissue is another important means of storing energy and this occurs in the abdomen (in internal structures called fat bodies), under the skin and, in some salamanders, in the tail.|$|E

5|$|Both species {{live on the}} ground, {{are active}} during the night, are solitary, and feed mainly on fruits and seeds, but may also eat herbs and insects. They build nests of leaves and {{branches}} among vegetation, for example in a tree hollow, or under rocks. In Panama, T.talamancae breeds throughout the year and the average litter <b>size</b> <b>is</b> about six. Various species of mites, chiggers, fleas, and sucking lice have been recorded as parasites on both species.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} great {{distance}} from the Earth, all stars except the Sun appear to the unaided eye as shining points {{in the night sky}} that twinkle because of the effect of the Earth's atmosphere. The Sun is also a star, but it is close enough to the Earth to appear as a disk instead, and to provide daylight. Other than the Sun, the star with the largest apparent <b>size</b> <b>is</b> R Doradus, with an angular diameter of only 0.057 arcseconds.|$|E
5|$|During the 2nd century some {{units with}} the new names numerus ("group") and vexillatio ("detachment") appear in the diploma record. Their <b>size</b> <b>is</b> uncertain, but was likely smaller than the regular alae and cohortes, as {{originally}} they were probably detachments from the latter, acquiring independent status after long-term separation. As these units are mentioned in diplomas, they were presumably part of the regular auxiliary organisation. But numeri was also a generic term used for barbarian units outside the regular auxilia.

5|$|In deposit, {{the spores}} appear brown. Viewing {{them with a}} light {{microscope}} reveals finer details of their structure: they are roughly spherical but end abruptly in a small point, their surfaces are covered with small, wart-like nodules, and their <b>size</b> <b>is</b> between 5.0–5.3 by 4.0–4.7µm. The spores are in amyloid, meaning they do not absorb iodine when stained with Melzer's reagent.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, Gyeongju has {{followed}} the same trends that have affected the rest of South Korea. Like {{the country as a}} whole, Gyeongju has seen its population age and the size of families shrink. For instance, the mean household <b>size</b> <b>is</b> 2.8 people. Because this has fallen in recent years, there are more households in the city as of 2008 (105,009) than there were in 2003, even though the population has fallen.|$|E
