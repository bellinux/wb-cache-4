The story begins with an attack upon Moonbrooke Castle by the wizard Hargon, who seeks to <b>summon</b> <b>the</b> demon Malroth to destroy the world. A wounded soldier escaped the battle and fled to the kingdom of Midenhall, where he informs {{the king of the}} attack before he dies.

5|$|In Final Fantasy X, Yuna is {{introduced}} as a summoner who can use healing magic {{and is able}} to summon powerful magical entities called aeons with help from spirits known as Fayths. Already known throughout Spira as the daughter of High Summoner Braska, who previously brought a brief respite from Sin's destruction ten years earlier, Yuna decides to embark on the summoner's pilgrimage to become a High Summoner herself. Yuna must journey to temples across the world, acquire the aeon from each and <b>summon</b> <b>the</b> Final Aeon in a battle that will kill them both. She gradually becomes more open and falls in love with Tidus. Upon arriving at the place where Yuna can <b>summon</b> <b>the</b> final aeon, Tidus persuades the group to look for another way to defeat Sin without using any sacrifices. After entering Sin's body, Yuna and her guardians defeat the disembodied spirit of Yu Yevon, who is responsible for reviving Sin after each defeat, allowing an eternal Calm to start in Spira. However, Tidus disappears as he is the product of the Fayth, who could not depart until Sin's defeat.|$|E
5|$|King Stephen gave {{permission}} {{for some of}} England's bishops, including Bethune, to attend the Council of Reims in 1148. Stephen had expelled the papal legates, or representatives, who arrived in England to <b>summon</b> <b>the</b> bishops to Reims, and after that appointed three of the bishops as representatives of the English Church. These three, Bethune, Hilary of Chichester, and William de Turbeville, were allowed to attend the council. Theobald of Bec was expressly forbidden to attend, {{but he managed to}} evade those watching him and arrived in Reims along with his clerk, Thomas Becket.|$|E

5|$|Now united, the nations, {{aided by}} Adventurers, {{successfully}} storm Castrum Novum {{and destroy the}} beacon. Nael, insanely committed to his plan, makes himself into a second beacon. Though he is defeated by the Adventurers, Dalamud has descended too far for it to return into orbit, so Louisoix proposes a final desperate plan: to <b>summon</b> <b>the</b> Twelve, Eorzea's deities, and return Dalamud into orbit. The Adventurers pray to altars dedicated to the Twelve across the land, then rally with the armies of the Eorzean Alliance to fight Nael's legion on the Carteneau Flats, the predicted impact site of Dalamud. In {{the midst of the}} battle, Dalamud disintegrates and reveals itself to have been a prison for the Elder Primal Bahamut. Enraged after its imprisonment, Bahamut begins laying waste to Eorzea. After the attempt to <b>summon</b> <b>the</b> Twelve fails, Louisoix uses the last of his power to send the Adventurers into a time rift, separating them from the flow of time so they can return when Eorzea has recovered. Louisoix then proceeds to sacrifice himself to destroy Bahamut in a final cataclysmic battle, leaving behind a barren, scarred landscape.|$|E
5|$|The Mascarene grey parakeet was grey, {{had a long}} tail, and {{was larger}} than other species of the Psittacula genus, which are usually green. The grey parrots {{were said to be}} easy to hunt, as the capture of one would result in its calling out to <b>summon</b> <b>the</b> whole flock. They were also {{considered}} to be crop pests and being such easy prey meant that they were extensively hunted. Coupled with deforestation, this pushed them into extinction. This had happened by the 1730s on Réunion and by the 1760s on Mauritius.|$|E
5|$|A {{year after}} Luis Marín's {{reconnaissance}} expedition, Pedro de Alvarado entered Chiapas when he crossed {{a part of}} the Lacandon Forest in an attempt to link up with Hernán Cortés' expedition heading for Honduras. Alvarado entered Chiapas from Guatemala via the territory of the Acala Ch'ol; he was unable to locate Cortés, and his scouts eventually led him to Tecpan Puyumatlan (modern Santa Eulalia, Huehuetenango), in a mountainous region near the territory of the Lakandon Ch'ol. The inhabitants of Tecpan Puyumatlan offered fierce resistance against the Spanish-led expedition, and Gonzalo de Alvarado wrote that the Spanish suffered many losses, including the killing of messengers sent to <b>summon</b> <b>the</b> natives to swear loyalty to the Spanish Crown.

5|$|During a raid {{against a}} group of surface elves, Drizzt finds himself unable to {{participate}} in the slaughter with his fellow drow. He pretends to kill an elf child, but actually helps her to escape. When the deception is discovered, Zaknafein is sacrificed in Drizzt's stead to appease Lloth, the drow's goddess. Following a war against another House, Drizzt curses his family and the evil drow ways and escapes Menzoberranzan into the Underdark. At this time he also acquires the statuette that allows him to <b>summon</b> <b>the</b> magical panther Guenhwyvar. Guenhwyvar travels by Drizzt's side as he makes his way across the Realms.|$|E
5|$|Sometime between May and July 1108, Henry {{addressed}} a writ to Urse and the Bishop of Worcester from Reading. The royal document commanded the sheriff not <b>summon</b> <b>the</b> shire and hundred courts to locations different than customary nor that he summon them on dates {{other than those}} normal for such courts. From this, the historian Judith Green speculates that Urse had been summoning these courts at unusual times and then fining {{those who did not}} attend. The king specifically commanded that this procedure stop and then went on to detail the various courts which would hear what types of cases and the type of procedure {{that could be used in}} what type of case.|$|E

5|$|Each {{character}} can summon a specific Eidolon into battle. These summoned creatures include series staples Odin, Shiva, Alexander, and Bahamut, and newcomers Hecatoncheir and Brynhildr. When <b>summoned,</b> <b>the</b> Eidolon stays in combat while the characters accompanying the summoner leave the party. While an Eidolon is <b>summoned,</b> <b>the</b> player can trigger a feature called Gestalt Mode, {{in which the}} Eidolon transforms into a different form and performs different attacks while <b>the</b> <b>summoning</b> character rides them.|$|R

The next day, an aerodynamic engineer named Adrian Toomes (Robert Englund) is outraged at OsCorp for stealing his anti-gravity project, viciously berating Dr. Otto Octavius (Peter MacNicol) until Norman Osborn (Alan Rachins) arrives. Osborn dismisses Toomes, {{calling him a}} failure and a buzzard before he has him escorted out by security. Toomes turns to Octavius and declares {{that he no longer}} blames him for the theft of his work.|$|E
5|$|Washington, {{alarmed by}} what {{appeared}} to be an armed insurrection in Western Pennsylvania, asked his cabinet for written opinions {{about how to deal with}} the crisis. The cabinet recommended the use of force, except for Secretary of State Randolph who urged reconciliation. Washington did bothhe sent commissioners to meet with the rebels while raising a militia army. When the final report of the commissioners recommended the use of the military to enforce the laws, the president invoked the Militia Law of 1792 to <b>summon</b> <b>the</b> militias of Pennsylvania, Virginia and several other states. The governors sent the troops and Washington took command as Commander-in-Chief, marching into the rebellious districts.|$|E
5|$|Chauvel, however, {{was still}} {{disappointed}} with the failure to destroy the Turkish army. The Turks had fought hard, forcing {{the commitment of the}} Desert Mounted Corps in heavy action before the moment for a sweeping pursuit came. When it did, the men and horses were too tired and could not <b>summon</b> <b>the</b> required energy. In February 1918, the EEF began a series of operations across the Jordan. Allenby soon found his British troops diverted to France, to be replaced by two Indian cavalry divisions, and the Australian Mounted Division faced a similar fate for a time. In the meantime, during the second Transjordan operations Chauvel faced great difficulties with the terrain, the weather and a tenacious enemy; the campaign was not a success. The Desert Mounted Corps found itself fighting outnumbered, with Turkish reinforcements closing in from all sides. Chauvel was forced to withdraw to the West Bank of the Jordan. Subsequently, the 5th Yeomanry Mounted Brigade was disbanded and Chauvel replaced it with the 5th Light Horse Brigade, formed from the Australian and New Zealand components of the now disbanded Imperial Camel Corps Brigade, and a composite French cavalry regiment of Spahis and Chasseurs d'Afrique.|$|E

5|$|Hermione {{identifies}} in Dumbledore's book {{a strange}} symbol also worn {{at the wedding}} by Xenophilius Lovegood. They visit him and are told the symbol represents the mythical Deathly Hallows, three objects from an old fairy tale titled The Tale of the Three Brothers: the Elder Wand, an unbeatable wand; the Resurrection Stone, able to <b>summon</b> <b>the</b> dead; and an infallible Invisibility Cloak. Harry realises Voldemort is seeking (and later successfully obtains) the Elder Wand, won by Dumbledore after Grindelwald's defeat, believing it {{will allow him to}} overpower the connection between his own wand and Harry's. Harry also recognises the Resurrection Stone as that found by Dumbledore which later become the second Hallow, and believes it to be hidden inside the Snitch Dumbledore left for him, but can't open it. The description of the third Hallow also matches that of his own inherited Invisibility Cloak.|$|E
5|$|Meetings usually {{began at}} dawn, {{although}} occasionally certain events (such as festivals) might delay {{the beginning of}} a meeting. A magistrate who wished to <b>summon</b> <b>the</b> Senate had to issue a compulsory order (a cogere), and senators could be punished if they failed to appear without reasonable cause. In 44 BC for example, consul Mark Antony threatened to demolish the house of the former consul Cicero for this very reason. The Senate meetings were technically public because the doors were usually left open, which allowed people to look in, but only senators could speak. The Senate was directed by a presiding magistrate, who was usually either a consul (the highest-ranking magistrate) or, if the consul was unavailable, a Praetor (the second-highest ranking magistrate). By the late Republic, another type of magistrate, a plebeian tribune, would sometimes preside.|$|E
5|$|The Congress soon {{joined the}} new Indian ministry. The League was slower to do so, not {{entering}} until October 1946. In agreeing {{to have the}} League join the government, Jinnah abandoned his demands for parity with the Congress and a veto on matters concerning Muslims. The new ministry met amid a backdrop of rioting, especially in Calcutta. The Congress wanted the Viceroy to immediately <b>summon</b> <b>the</b> constituent assembly and begin the work of writing a constitution and felt that the League ministers should either join in the request or resign from the government. Wavell attempted to save the situation by flying leaders such as Jinnah, Liaquat, and Jawaharlal Nehru to London in December 1946. At {{the end of the}} talks, participants issued a statement that the constitution would not be forced on any unwilling parts of India. On the way back from London, Jinnah and Liaquat stopped in Cairo for several days of pan-Islamic meetings.|$|E
