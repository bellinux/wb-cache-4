50|$|Lunni and {{her sister}} ships were {{designed}} {{to be able to}} navigate in the ice conditions of the Baltic Sea independently without icebreaker assistance and maintain a moderately high speed in ice. For this purpose they had more power than an average Baltic tanker and were normally required to use only 50-75% of the full engine power in ice — in normal operation only one of the two main engines was coupled to shaft, with the other remaining in reserve for difficult ice conditions. The highly raked stem, similar to those in traditional icebreakers, was designed to break the ice by bending it downwards under the ship's weight. The ships were also equipped with an air bubbling system to reduce friction between the hull and ice. To prevent pollution in case of grounding the ships were also built with double hulls and conformed to the IMCO regulations in respect of <b>segregated</b> <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks</b> even though they were regarded only recommendations back then.|$|R
40|$|This report {{analyzes}} {{the concept of}} using oil tankers’ free cargo space and/or <b>segregated</b> <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks</b> to transport freshwater on the return leg, i. e. from oil unloading port back to oil loading port – also called freshwater backhauling (FWBH). The hypothesis considered is that by shipping freshwater this way to arid, oil exporting regions one can achieve a low cost and low GHG emission water supply system. The report {{analyzes the}} concept in a holistic manner, considering technical issues, transport and infrastructure costs, environmental impacts and contractual and legal issues. Technically FWBH is feasible as the technical modifications and new infrastructure to be developed for FWBH can be integrated with the present oil tanker and trade infrastructure. Costs are estimated both on a general and scenario specific level. It is found that freshwater could be shipped by way of backhauling by oil tankers to Saudi Arabia from Japan {{at a cost of}} between 0. 83 and 1. 16 USD/ton, including all infrastructure except distribution systems and excluding modifications to the tankers themselves. This cost level makes FWBH to a certain degree competitive with the chief water supply technology in the Middle East, desalination. Deducing sustainability by comparing FWBH with desalination has been done by calculating CO 2 emissions for unit volume transportation/production of freshwater (kgs/m 3) and harmful marine discharges. It is found that FWBH is not conclusively better than desalination in terms of GHG emissions. Emission level of FWBH is found to vary strongly with operational parameters. On the other hand FWBH can be a simple and potent solution to the seawater ballast water problem for regions with sufficient freshwater resources. Viability of FWBH is found to be very dependent on oil market conditions, so to preserve some stability in water supply it is advised that handling of the water trade at a contractual level is done by public authorities. Accordingly, long term contracts can be considered more suitable for the purpose of FWBH than short term or spot contracts. Feasibility of the FWBH concept is complex, and the question depends on mode of operation, location of ports and terminals, oil market conditions, ship type and several other factors. It is clear, however, that in many cases FWBH is the superior option compared to desalination, especially when including environmental aspects. Still, no FWBH project or scheme has ever been carried out. We conclude that the reason for this lies with authorities in both potential water importing and water exporting nations. Questions regarding the status of freshwater as an economic good has to be resolved on an international level, and oil exporting nations (especially Middle East countries) has to be convinced about the benefits of considering alternatives to desalination. </p...|$|R

50|$|One of {{the most}} common {{problems}} among vessel construction and maintenance is the corrosion that takes place in the double hull space <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks</b> have in merchant vessels. Bio-degradation takes place in <b>ballast</b> <b>tank</b> coatings in marine environments. <b>Ballast</b> <b>tanks</b> can carry more than ballast water, most of the time <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks</b> are filled with other bacteria or organisms. Some of these bacteria can that can be picked up {{from other parts of the}} world can cause the <b>ballast</b> <b>tank</b> to get damaged. Bacteria from different regions plus the natural bacteria can cause <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks</b> to break down. The natural bacteria community has an interaction of the natural bio-films with the coating, an aspect which is not covered in standard procedures. Researchers have shown that biological activity indeed significantly affects the coating properties. Micro-cracks and small holes have been found in <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks.</b> Acidic bacteria created holes with 0.2-0.9 μm in length and 4-9 μm in width. The natural community caused cracks of 2-8 μm in depth and 1 μm in length. The EIS technique was used to examine the degradation. The bacterial affected coatings decreased in corrosion resistance. The natural community, has a clear loss in coating resistance over time. Also, coating corrosion resistance declines after 40 days of exposure to the natural community, resulting in blisters in the <b>ballast</b> <b>tank.</b> Bacteria might be linked to certain bio-film patterns affecting various types of coating attacks.|$|R
50|$|These {{models have}} the ability to alter their {{displacement}} by taking on or pumping out water. This can be accomplished {{through the use of a}} piston, inflatable bladder, or through a <b>ballast</b> <b>tank.</b> Boats that use a <b>ballast</b> <b>tank</b> generally fill the tank by opening a vent at the top, and force the water out by using compressed gas. There are variants that use water pumps for both processes. A liquid gas is dosed into the <b>ballast</b> <b>tank</b> to push water out. Gas-Snort Liquid gas is used to surface the boat in an emergency, otherwise the <b>ballast</b> <b>tank</b> is blown by the use of a snorkel tube at periscope depth and the boat is trimmed to surface to periscope depth with a full <b>ballast</b> <b>tank.</b> RCABS -Recirculated Compressed Air Ballast System. Originally developed by Darnell (UK) in the 1950s, this system uses a rubber bladder as the <b>ballast</b> <b>tank</b> and this is filled with compressed air supplied by a small compressor. The air is taken from the water-tight container (WTC) aft dry space to inflate the bladder.|$|R
50|$|On vintage submarines, Kingston valves are fitted at {{the bottom}} of certain <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks,</b> such as safety, negative, and bow {{buoyancy}} <b>tanks.</b> The submarine's <b>ballast</b> <b>tank</b> valves are used to admit water when the submarine dives. The valves allow water to enter the <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks,</b> while the enclosed air escapes through the open main vents {{at the top of the}} <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks.</b> During peacetime the Kingston valves are closed when the submarine is on the surface, the valves and vents being opened to dive, but to reduce the time required for diving in wartime the Kingston valves are left permanently open when at sea, the water being kept out of the <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks</b> by the air pressure of the trapped air. This pressure is released when the vents are opened for diving, allowing the water to enter through the open Kingston valves.|$|R

5|$|The same report {{lists the}} {{following}} as some drawbacks to the double-hull design, including higher build costs, greater operating expenses (e.g. higher canal and port tariffs), difficulties in <b>ballast</b> <b>tank</b> ventilation, {{the fact that}} <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks</b> need continuous monitoring and maintenance, increased transverse free surface, the greater number of surfaces to maintain, the risk of explosions in double-hull spaces if a vapor detection system not fitted, and that cleaning <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks</b> is more difficult for double hull ships.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{maritime}} accidents {{have been}} caused by corrosion, and this has led to stringent regulations concerning protective coatings for <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks.</b> The Coating Performance Standard for <b>Ballast</b> <b>Tank</b> Coatings (PSPC), became effective in 2008. It specifies how protective coatings should be applied during vessel construction with the intention of giving a coating a 15-year service life. Additional regulations, such as those established by The International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships Ballast Water & Sediments (SBWS) sought to avoid introducing invasive species throughout the world through ship's <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks.</b> [...] The methods used to avoid having these invasive species surviving in <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks</b> however greatly increased the rate of corrosion.

As double-hulled tankers were introduced it meant that there was more <b>ballast</b> <b>tank</b> area had to be coated and therefore a greater capital investment for ship owners. With the onset of the OPA 90 and later the amendments to MARPOL annex 1, single hull tankers (without alternative method) have basically phased out.|$|R
50|$|An {{emergency}} main <b>ballast</b> <b>tank</b> blow is {{a procedure}} used aboard a submarine that forces high-pressure air into its main <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks.</b> The high-pressure air forces ballast {{water from the}} tanks, quickly lightening the ship so it can rapidly rise to the surface.|$|R

5000|$|In {{submarine}} technology a vent [...] is a valve {{fitted to}} the top of a submarine's <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks</b> to let air escape from the top of the <b>ballast</b> <b>tank</b> and be replaced by water entering through the opening(s) called [...] "flood ports" [...] or [...] "floods" [...] at the bottom of the tank. In earlier times, the openings at the bottom of the <b>ballast</b> <b>tank</b> were fitted with valves known as Kingston valves.

50|$|Because {{the boat}} {{had not been}} {{prepared}} to dive, instrumentation valves were not aligned properly, {{and even though the}} main <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks</b> were filling, their indicators read empty.

50|$|Another system gaining {{popularity}} is the 'Snort System'. A <b>ballast</b> <b>tank</b> allows water to enter by releasing a vent valve {{on the top}} of the cylinder, allowing the boat to submerge. To surface, a small pump 'Snorts' air from the snorkel tube in the conning tower (sail) into the <b>ballast</b> <b>tank,</b> expelling the water. This system is also equipped with a small tank of compressed gas, which in the event of a fail-safe system operating, usually due to loss of radio signal, the gas is released into the <b>ballast</b> <b>tank,</b> surfacing the boat.|$|R
