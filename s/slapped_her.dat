5|$|The {{following}} week, Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack) spots her ex-boyfriend Jack Branning (Scott Maslen) {{talking to}} Marsden; Jack tells Ronnie {{that he was}} fishing for information. With no new leads, Marsden's boss threatens to take her off the case. She reviews the suspects and decides to question Jack, since he is asking more questions than he has answered. In the caf√© Marsden and Hughes discuss new information she has obtained, ensuring that she is overheard. Chinese whisper-style rumours circulate, ending with the certainty that Marsden would arrest Ronnie. Ronnie sees Marsden in the Square, and a struggle ensues. She knocks Marsden down, is {{arrested and charged with}} assaulting a police officer but is released on bail. Marsden suspects Ronnie further, saying that she has now shown her true colours. Later, DC Jasmine Field (Karen Ascoe) enters the pub with other officers to arrest a suspect; frightened, Ronnie leaves Walford. The police officers are there to arrest Dot Branning (June Brown), who was accused by Dotty Cotton (Molly Conlin) after Dot <b>slapped</b> <b>her.</b> Jack confronts Marsden for unnecessarily sending a uniformed officer to arrest Dot and unsettling the locals, and realises there was no new information.|$|E

He struggled to keep jobs and make ends meet, and the couple would often have fights {{over the issue of}} finances. In 1999, the police advised Durousseau's wife on how to file for a restraining order after he allegedly <b>slapped</b> <b>her</b> in the face and grabbed her by the neck. Later, she testified he got violently angry when she talked about getting a divorce. In September and October 2001, Durousseau spent 48 days in jail for domestic battery.|$|E
25|$|On March 16, 2017, the European Parliament {{condemned}} {{the wave of}} killings in the Philippines and called for De Lima's release. It expressed serious concerns that the offences Senator De Lima {{has been charged with}} are almost entirely fabricated. Amnesty International regards de Lima as a prisoner of conscience. Despite her imprisonment, de Lima continues to oppose the policies of Duterte and remains a member of the Philippine Senate and the Liberal Party. She was part of the debate regarding martial law. In late July 2017, de Lima was visted by members of the European Parliament and the Liberal International. She was unable to vote against the martial law extension because of her detention. She petitioned her release but the Supreme Court rejected her request, and later <b>slapped</b> <b>her</b> with the affirmation of the release of numerous prisoners guilty of graft or corruption during the previous administrations. By October 2017, de Lima released numerous statements while in prison condemning the death toll of the Philippine Drug War which has increased to 14,000 Filipino deaths, where a huge number were children, infants, and teenagers. In November 2017, de Lima was awarded the Prize for Freedom by Liberal International, becoming the second Filipino to receive the prestigious award after Corazon Aquino.|$|E
500|$|They began dating, with Lennon now {{referring}} to her as [...] "Cyn". In the autumn of 1958, she ended her engagement to be with him, and he ended his relationship with another art student, Thelma Pickles. [...] His jealousy could also manifest itself in violent behaviour towards her, as when he <b>slapped</b> <b>her</b> across the face (causing her head to hit a wall), after watching her dance with Stuart Sutcliffe. After the incident, she broke up with Lennon for three months, but resumed their relationship after his profuse apology. Another time a cleaning woman at the college caught Lennon hitting her and suggested she stay away from him.|$|E

500|$|When Ross {{arrived back}} at the campground, he {{realized}} the captured woman had blue eyes. The woman could not speak English and did not remember her birth name or details of her life prior to joining the Comanche. After much questioning, {{she was able to}} provide a few details of her capture as a child. The details matched what Ross knew of the 1836 Fort Parker Massacre, so he summoned Colonel Isaac Parker to identify her. When Parker mentioned his kidnapped niece had been named Cynthia Ann Parker, the woman <b>slapped</b> <b>her</b> chest and said [...] "Me Cincee Ann." [...] Parker never returned to the Comanche people, but was not happy to have been rescued by Ross.|$|E
500|$|Clouzot {{was very}} {{demanding}} with his actors and would often quarrel {{with them to}} get them in the mood he desired. Suzy Delair recalled that Clouzot <b>slapped</b> <b>her,</b> but said of it, [...] "So what? He slapped others as well...He was tough but I'm not about to complain". Pierre Fresnay recalled that Clouzot [...] "worked relentlessly, which made for a juicy spectacle...That's to say nothing for his taste of violence, which he never tried with me". When working with Bardot, one scene required Bardot's character to drool and sleep. Clouzot offered her powerful sleeping pills, saying they were aspirin, and this led to Bardot's stomach being pumped. Although Clouzot was harsh on his actors, he did not treat them fiercely off set. Delair recalled that off set there was an [...] "innocence about him" [...] that was not seen.|$|E
500|$|The {{engagement}} of Gopal and Latha is fixed {{and while the}} reception is being held, a young woman arrives, claiming to be Chitra, accompanied by her uncle Rangan. Gopal says the woman is an impostor, but she and her uncle produce evidence which convinces even Gopal's police officer friend Kumar. Gopal's engagement with Latha is cancelled. Chitra and Rangan become disruptive and Gopal gets frustrated, fearing that Latha might leave him because his [...] "wife" [...] has turned up. Several days later, Gopal reveals the truth to everyone. In a flashback, when Chitra was ready to leave Gopal, he <b>slapped</b> <b>her.</b> Chitra, suffering from a heart condition, is unable to take the insult of his slap and dies from the shock. Gopal realises that he had inadvertently killed his wife. To avoid arrest, and safeguard the honour of his family, he manipulates the murder to appear like a suicide on a railway track and fabricates the necessary {{evidence to show that}} Chitra committed suicide. Thus, Gopal escapes from the charges of murder. Not wishing to continue living in Singapore, he leaves by a ship to India.|$|E

500|$|By 1948 Olivier was on {{the board}} of {{directors}} for the Old Vic Theatre, and he and Leigh embarked on a six-month tour of Australia and New Zealand to raise funds for the theatre. Olivier played the lead in Richard III and also performed with Leigh in The School for Scandal and The Skin of Our Teeth. The tour was an outstanding success and, although Leigh was plagued with insomnia and allowed her understudy to replace her for a week while she was ill, she generally withstood the demands placed upon her, with Olivier noting her ability to [...] "charm the press". Members of the company later recalled several quarrels between the couple as Olivier was increasingly resentful of the demands placed on him during the tour. The most dramatic altercation occurred in Christchurch, New Zealand, when her shoes were not found and Leigh refused to go onstage without them. An exhausted and exasperated Olivier screamed an obscenity at her and <b>slapped</b> <b>her</b> face, and a devastated Leigh slapped him in return, dismayed that he would hit her publicly. Subsequently, she made her way to the stage in borrowed pumps, and in seconds, had [...] "dried her tears and smiled brightly onstage". By the end of the tour, both were exhausted and ill. Olivier told a journalist, [...] "You may not know it, but you are talking to a couple of walking corpses." [...] Later, he would observe that he [...] "lost Vivien" [...] in Australia.|$|E
500|$|Canning reappeared {{at about}} 10pm on 29January 1753. [...] At {{the sight of}} her daughter, whom she had not seen for almost a month, Elizabeth Canning fainted. [...] Once {{recovered}} she sent James Lord to fetch several neighbours, and inside only a few minutes the house was full. [...] Elizabeth was described as being in a [...] "deplorable condition"; her face and hands were black with dirt, she wore a shift, a petticoat, and a bedgown. [...] A dirty rag tied around her head was soaked with blood from a wounded ear. [...] According to her story she had been attacked by two men near Bedlam Hospital. [...] They had partially stripped her, robbed her and hit her in the temple, rendering her unconscious. [...] She awoke [...] "by a large road, where was water, with the two men that robbed me" [...] and was forced to walk to a house, where an old woman asked if she would [...] "go their way" [...] (become a prostitute). [...] Canning had refused, and the woman cut off her corset, <b>slapped</b> <b>her</b> face and pushed her upstairs into a loft. [...] There the young maidservant had remained for almost a month, with no visitors and existing only on bread and water. [...] The clothing she wore she had scavenged from a fireplace in the loft. [...] Canning had eventually made her escape by pulling some boards away from a window and walking the five-hour journey home. [...] She recalled hearing the name [...] "Wills or Wells", and as she had seen through the window a coachman she recognised, thought she had been held on the Hertford Road. [...] On this evidence, John Wintlebury and a local journeyman, Robert Scarrat, identified the house as that of [...] "Mother" [...] Susannah Wells at Enfield Wash, nearly [...] distant.|$|E
2500|$|Realizing Cynthia had {{forgotten}} {{most of her}} English and would be unhappy if separated from the life she knew, some Rangers urged Ross to let her return to the Comanches, but he felt it best to try to return her to her birth family. He sent her and her child to Camp Cooper. He then notified her uncle, Colonel Isaac Parker. When Colonel Parker mentioned that his niece's name was Cynthia, she <b>slapped</b> <b>her</b> chest and said, [...] "Me Cincee Ann." [...] He took her to his home near Birdville.|$|E

[...] Moreover, two witnesses at House's habeas hearing testified that, around the time of House's trial, Muncey had confessed to the crime. One witness recalled that she and [...] "some family members and some friends [...] sitting around drinking" [...] at her trailer when Muncey [...] "just walked in and sit down." [...] Muncey, who had evidently been drinking heavily, began [...] "rambling off [...] [...] [...] talking about what happened to his wife and how it happened and he didn't mean to do it."

2500|$|Kyo's older brother, and {{original}} {{heir to the}} Tengu Clan. He is 22 {{years old when he}} is first introduced. Once the clan realized how cruel he is, Kyo became the heir. When he was the heir, he was supposed to marry Misao. However, he is very cruel to her and does not love her, and even <b>slapped</b> <b>her</b> as a child. He hates that his brother was always there in case he failed to harm Misao. [...] The previous Clan Leader called Kyo [...] "the spare tire" [...] or [...] "back-up plan" [...] because Sho was deemed unfit as the heir due to his abusive and cruel nature. [...] While he despises Misao, he hates that she chose Kyo over him because it made him feel useless to the clan. In later chapters, however, he shows an emotional side, as he saves Misao from being crushed to death inside a storage house. He is later brought back to life by the efforts of his former attendant Roh. In the last battle between the two brothers, he is killed, but warns Kyo that he wouldn't be like him and kill Misao, implying that he read the last pages of the Immortal Fruit Record.|$|E
2500|$|On June 17, 1991 {{during the}} taping of WWF Superstars of Wrestling (Sacramento's ARCO Arena) in [...] an in-ring segment with Gene Okerlund announcing, [...] "Macho Man" [...] Randy Savage {{proposed}} to Miss Elizabeth, which she accepted. The couple then held a heavily promoted on-air wedding billed as [...] "The Match Made in Heaven" [...] at SummerSlam 1991 in New York's Madison Square Garden (the couple were officially married on December 30, 1984). At the wedding reception, Elizabeth opened a gift package containing a live snake, which frightened her; newly-turned-heel Jake [...] "The Snake" [...] Roberts and The Undertaker crashed the reception and attacked Savage. This started a feud between Roberts and Savage, where Elizabeth quickly figured prominently. The first high-profile Savage-Roberts match {{was at the}} Tuesday in Texas pay-per-view event, where, after Savage gained a pinfall victory, Roberts beat down Savage, then forced Elizabeth to beg him to stop the beating. Apparently dissatisfied with her begging, Roberts grabbed her by the hair and <b>slapped</b> <b>her</b> across her face. On the February 8, 1992 edition of Saturday Night's Main Event, Roberts, with a steel chair in tow, {{was waiting in the}} backstage area for Elizabeth and Savage to come through the curtain after a match. Roberts was about to strike Elizabeth with the chair, but Undertaker stopped him. This started Undertaker's feud with his former ally.|$|E

Yet after only thirteen days, Sting and Angle lost the titles to Adam [...] "Pacman" [...] Jones and Ron [...] "The Truth" [...] Killings at No Surrender. During the match, Karen Angle claimed that Sting had <b>slapped</b> <b>her,</b> {{which led to a}} falling out between Sting and Kurt Angle and on the first two-hour edition of Impact!, Kurt Angle was shown via satellite (kayfabe) stalking and assaulting Sting's son Garrett. It was announced that Sting would face Kurt Angle for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship at Bound for Glory. The match was billed as return to his roots for Sting, who enjoyed enormous popularity and success in the Atlanta-based World Championship Wrestling earlier in his career. On October 14 at Bound for Glory, Sting overcame interference by both Karen Angle and Kevin Nash to defeat Angle and win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. On October 16, at the tapings of the October 25 episode of Impact!, Sting lost the championship back to Angle after Kevin Nash interfered on Angle's behalf. Sting then challenged Angle to a tag team rematch at Genesis. Angle was forced to Kevin Nash as his partner, while Sting's partner was a mystery until during the event where his partner was revealed to be Booker T. In the match, whoever scored the pinfall would win the TNA World Championship, which Angle won after pinning Sting to retain the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. This would be the final TNA appearance of Sting in 2007 as he would take some time off to be with his family.|$|E
