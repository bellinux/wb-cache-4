50|$|ZL Technologies was {{originally}} established as ZipLip in 1999, a secure mail carrier that provided tracking, <b>security,</b> <b>and</b> <b>authentication</b> services. Its first customers were telecommunications firms, large organizations {{that required a}} robust architecture in order to govern their {{hundreds of thousands of}} email inboxes. In 2000, ZipLip's secure email and data tracking capabilities expanded to provide secure file share and collaboration tools for enterprise users, and in 2001 the telecom market experienced a bubble, forcing ZipLip to shift its focus to large enterprise customers. Additionally in the early 2000s, the regulatory and legal landscape underwent major changes—such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act—and in response ZipLip expanded its focus to the newly invigorated requirements for regulatory compliance, accommodating the ingestion, archiving, and long-term governance of business communications. In 2006 the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) were amended to include electronically stored content (ESI) as a type of discoverable content, and ZipLip expanded its product to include eDiscovery functionalities to accommodate the new regulation.|$|E

Data <b>Security,</b> confidentiality <b>and</b> <b>Authentication</b> are the major problems in cloud computing. This paper analyzes the security vulnerabilities of most popular cryptography algorithms such as AES, DES, Triple DES, Blowfish and Hashing algorithms like MD 2, MD 5, SHA- 1, and SHA- 2.
