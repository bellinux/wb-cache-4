5|$|Because of the {{popularity}} of the novel, Gatiss felt a greater responsibility to include familiar elements of the <b>story</b> <b>than</b> he did when adapting the lesser-known stories. The script was intended to follow elements of the horror genre and make the episode scary. As opposed to traditional ghost stories, Gatiss's plot focused on more contemporary horrors, conspiracy theories and genetic modification. Filming was done throughout May 2011, with additional shots taking place as late as August. Location shooting took place mostly across South Wales, though parts were shot in Dartmoor. The hound was created using visual effects.|$|E
5|$|The film's pacing {{was praised}} by reviewers in The New York Times and The Washington Post as being much swifter than its {{predecessor}} and closer {{to that of the}} television series. Janet Maslin of The New York Times credited the film with a stronger <b>story</b> <b>than</b> The Motion Picture and stated the sequel was everything the first film should have been. Variety agreed that The Wrath of Khan was closer to the original spirit of Star Trek {{than its predecessor}}. Strong character interaction was cited as a strong feature of the film, as was Montalbán's portrayal of Khan. In 2016, Playboy ranked the film number four on its list of 15 Sequels That Are Way Better Than The Originals.|$|E
5|$|With this {{widespread}} appeal, {{the myth}} appears in more ancient texts {{than any other}} myth and in an exceptionally broad range of Egyptian literary styles. These sources also provide an unusual amount of detail. Ancient Egyptian myths are fragmentary and vague; the religious metaphors contained within the myths were more important than coherent narration. Each text that contains a myth, or a fragment of one, may adapt the myth to suit its particular purposes, so different texts can contain contradictory versions of events. Because the Osiris myth was used in such a variety of ways, different versions often conflict with each other. Nevertheless, the fragmentary versions, taken together, give it a greater resemblance to a cohesive <b>story</b> <b>than</b> most Egyptian myths.|$|E

5|$|Drake Doremus was {{inspired}} to make Like Crazy {{by the end of}} his eight-year long-distance relationship with Desiree Pappenscheller, who lived in London while Doremus lived in Los Angeles. Many elements of the film resemble their real-life relationship, such as frequent travelling between Los Angeles and London, trouble with American immigration laws, a brief marriage, a trip to Santa Catalina Island (where Jacob takes Anna in the early stages of their relationship), and the gift of a bracelet (in the film, a bracelet is given to Anna by Jacob). The story was co-written by Ben York Jones, who had also been involved in long-distance relationships. Together, they assembled a 50-page outline of the film which read more like a short <b>story</b> <b>than</b> a traditional screenplay. The outline included backstory, plot points, specific scene objectives, themes and emotional moments, but had minimal dialogue.|$|E
5|$|The {{expansion}} {{to three}} films allowed much more creative freedom, although Jackson, Walsh, and Boyens had to restructure their script accordingly. The three films do not correspond exactly to the trilogy's three volumes, but rather represent a three-part adaptation. Jackson takes a more chronological {{approach to the}} <b>story</b> <b>than</b> did Tolkien. Frodo's quest is the main focus, and Aragorn is the main sub-plot, and many sequences (such as Tom Bombadil) that do not contribute directly to those two plots were left out. Much effort was put into creating satisfactory conclusions and making sure exposition did not bog down the pacing. Amongst new sequences, there are also expansions on elements Tolkien kept ambiguous, such as the battles and the creatures. During shooting, the screenplays continued to evolve, {{in part due to}} contributions from cast members looking to further explore their characters. Most notable amongst these rewrites was the character Arwen, who was originally planned as a warrior princess, but reverted to her book counterpart, who remains physically inactive in the story (though she sends moral and military support).|$|E

While {{noted for its}} novelty {{as one of the}} first parody video games, Pyst was seen as not living up to its full potential as a parody of ripe and timely subject matter, and was criticised for lacking in gaming content, being more of an interactive <b>story</b> <b>than</b> a game.|$|E

25|$|During the {{production}} of The Land Before Time, development work was already beginning on the studio's next feature. Sullivan had been keen to fund the next feature {{with a combination of}} the studio's own revenue and Irish investment, as opposed to Hollywood producers; the deal with Goldcrest Films (which had an Irish office) would make this possible. Working under Goldcrest also afforded director Don Bluth freer rein over the development of the <b>story</b> <b>than</b> under Amblin and Spielberg.|$|E

The drama is approximately two hours long and is more faithful to the <b>story</b> <b>than</b> several of the film adaptations. Some changes are made to reflect modern language and knowledge of science.|$|E
25|$|EastEnders {{has been}} criticised {{for being too}} violent, most notably during a {{domestic}} violence storyline between Little Mo Morgan and her husband Trevor Morgan. As EastEnders is shown pre-watershed, there were worries that some scenes in this storyline were too graphic for its audience. Complaints against {{a scene in which}} Little Mo's face was pushed in gravy on Christmas Day were upheld by the Broadcasting Standards Council. However, a helpline after this episode attracted over 2000 calls. Erin Pizzey, who became internationally famous for having started one of the first women's refuges, said that EastEnders had done more to raise the issue of violence against women in one <b>story</b> <b>than</b> she had done in 25 years. The character of Phil Mitchell (played by Steve McFadden since early 1990) has been criticised on several occasions for glorifying violence and proving a bad role model to children. On one occasion following a scene in an episode broadcast in October 2002, where Phil brutally beat his godson, Jamie Mitchell (Jack Ryder), 31 complaints came from viewers who watched the scenes.|$|E

25|$|However, as Lowell Cauffiel {{documents}} in his nonfiction book, friends, coworkers, {{family members and}} others who knew Graham and Wood told an entirely different <b>story</b> <b>than</b> the one Wood spun as the key witness in Graham's trial. They described Wood as both a coercive and seductive pathological liar who delighted in wreaking havoc {{in the lives of}} others. Forever and Five Days presents evidence that Wood planned the first murder after she found Graham with another woman. She involved Graham as an insurance policy to keep her from ever leaving her. When Graham left her anyway after the series of alleged killings, Wood was willing to put herself in legal jeopardy by disclosing to police to exact her revenge. The book portrays Wood as a psychopathic criminal mastermind who manipulated the prosecutor and the jury to punish Graham. Psychological testing also revealed Graham could be easily manipulated, suffered from borderline personality disorder and lacked the sophistication to plan the series of killings, let alone adequately defend herself in her trial.|$|E

Clifton takes exception to Hutton's position, writing that it amounts to an accusation of [...] "serious literary fraud" [...] made by an [...] "argument from absence"; one of Hutton's main objections is that Aradia is unlike anything found in medieval literature.|$|E

Aware that The Hound of the Baskervilles, first published in 1902, {{was one of the}} most famous of Conan Doyle's original stories, Gatiss felt a greater responsibility to include familiar elements of the <b>story</b> <b>than</b> he does when adapting the lesser-known stories. Russell Tovey appeared as Henry Knight, a man whose father was ripped apart by a gigantic hound on Dartmoor 20 years earlier. Directed by McGuigan, the episode was first broadcast on 8 January 2012.|$|E
500|$|According to the {{literary}} analyst LeRoy L. Panek, in his examination of 20th-century British spy novels, in Moonraker Fleming uses a technique {{closer to the}} detective <b>story</b> <b>than</b> to the thriller genre. This manifests itself in Fleming placing clues to the plot line throughout the story, and leaving Drax's unveiling of his plan until the later chapters. Black sees that {{the pace of the}} novel is set by the launch of the rocket (there are four days between Bond's briefing by M and the launch) while Amis considers that the story to have a [...] "rather hurried" [...] ending.|$|E
500|$|Although {{simplified}} for {{use with}} the console gamepad, many innovations of the early Ultimas—in particular [...] (1983) by developer Richard Garriott—became standard among later RPGs in both the personal computer and console markets. These ideas included the use of tiled graphics and party-based combat, a mix of fantasy and science-fiction elements, and time travel. The game's written narrative was an innovative feature that allowed it to convey a larger <b>story</b> <b>than</b> {{was found in the}} minimal plots common at the time. Most games, including Garriott's own Akalabeth, focused primarily on basic gameplay mechanics like combat, and paid little attention to story and narrative.|$|E

500|$|Along the way, the {{production}} team went through drafts {{where the first}} act included far more detail than what {{ended up in the}} final version, such as a troll with a Brooklyn accent who would have explained the backstory behind Elsa's magical powers, and a regent for whom Lee was hoping to cast comedian Louis C.K. After all those details were thoroughly [...] "over-analyzed", they were excised because they amounted to a [...] "much more complex <b>story</b> <b>than</b> really we felt like we could fit in this 90-minute film."

A few years later, after Carradine had experienced financial success with Kung Fu, he decided he wanted to make the story into a movie. He contacted Carr, who secured the rights to the Henry Morton Robinson novel, and began writing the screenplay.
