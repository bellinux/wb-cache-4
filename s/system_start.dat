50|$|VAMTOX {{systems have}} a system of valves and dampers that direct the methane flow across the ceramic bed. On <b>system</b> <b>start</b> up, the system preheats and raises the {{temperature}} of the heat exchange material in the oxidizer bed to or above the auto-oxidation temperature of methane (1,000 °C or 1,832 °F). Then the preheating system is turned off and mine exhaust air is introduced. When the methane-filled air reaches the preheated bed, it oxidizes and releases heat. This heat is transferred to the bed, thereby maintaining its temperature to support continued operation. The oxidation process is flameless. Once the bed is preheated, the process needs no auxiliary energy so long as adequate inflow methane concentrations are maintained. The VAMTOX system exhaust gases can be used to raise steam, which can provide electrical power through a turbine generator.|$|E
