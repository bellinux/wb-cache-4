5|$|Although {{a member}} of the House of Lords, until the passage of the House of Lords Act in 1999, the 10th Earl of Shaftesbury rarely attended. His maiden <b>speech</b> <b>was</b> made on 10 November 1999. At this time, Shaftesbury made an eight-minute {{presentation}} in a debate regarding arts and sport, a portion of which is presented below.|$|E
5|$|Because of Einstein's {{travels to}} the Far East, {{he was unable to}} {{personally}} accept the Nobel Prize for Physics at the Stockholm award ceremony in December 1922. In his place, the banquet <b>speech</b> <b>was</b> held by a German diplomat, who praised Einstein not only as a scientist but also as an international peacemaker and activist.|$|E

5|$|Erskine's <b>speech</b> <b>was</b> {{replied to}} by the Solicitor General, James Mansfield, and the {{summing-up}} by Lord Mansfield was not favorable to Gordon. However, Erskine's reasoning carried the day with the jury, who found Lord George not guilty.|$|E
5|$|Historian Jean-Claude Willame {{argued that}} the <b>speech</b> <b>was</b> the result of Lumumba's growing {{frustration}} {{with the process of}} independence which he believed might represent a purely nominal change in government with no real effects. Lumumba blamed Kasa-Vubu and his colleagues for failing to publicly oppose this situation. Gender historians have therefore {{argued that the}} <b>speech</b> <b>was</b> the result of Lumumba's growing feeling of emasculation. Others have pointed to the influence of Belgian Socialist delegates and representatives of the Guinean President, Ahmed Sékou Touré, who had a strongly Marxist ideology, all of whom hoped a public and international denouncement of colonialism would help them politically.|$|E
5|$|On 23 June 2011, Wilders {{was acquitted}} of all charges. A Dutch court said that his <b>speech</b> <b>was</b> {{legitimate}} political debate, but on the edge. Because both the public prosecutor and the defence requested complete acquittal, the verdict will most likely not be appealed.|$|E

5|$|On November 15, 2007, Hastert {{delivered}} a farewell {{speech on the}} House floor, emphasizing the need for civility in politics; Hastert's <b>speech</b> <b>was</b> followed by remarks from Pelosi praising Hastert's service. Finally, on November 26, 2007, Hastert submitted his resignation, effective at 10:59p.m. Central Time that day, to Governor Rod Blagojevich of Illinois.|$|E

5|$|The <b>speech</b> <b>was</b> later {{released}} on vinyl and sold around 60,000 copies. Two million printed copies of its text were distributed globally, translated into thirteen languages, with 40,000 being sold in Japan alone.

40|$|We have {{implemented}} a facial animation system {{to carry out}} visible speech synthesis. Using this system, {{it is possible to}} manipulate control parameters to synthesize a sequence of speech articulations. In addition, it is possible to synthesize novel articulations, such as one that is half way between /ha! and Ida!. Given the importance ofvisible information in face-toface communication, visible <b>speech</b> synthesis <b>is</b> being developed to control and manipulate visible speech. Experiments have shown that this visible <b>speech</b> <b>is</b> particularly important when the auditory <b>speech</b> <b>is</b> degraded, because ofnoise, bane:width filtering, or hearing impairment (Massaro, 1987). The strong influence of visible <b>speech</b> <b>is</b> not limited to situations with degraded auditory input, however; it occurs even when visible <b>speech</b> <b>is</b> paired with perfectly intelligible speech sounds.

5|$|Against Neaera is {{preserved}} as Demosthenes' fifty-ninth speech, {{though it has}} been thought inauthentic since antiquity. Dionysius of Hallicarnassus, for instance, questioned its authorship. Modern scholars from the nineteenth century to the present have generally accepted that the <b>speech</b> <b>was</b> not written by Demosthenes, and today it is often grouped {{with the rest of}} the speeches concerning Apollodoros as being the work of a single Pseudo-Demosthenes. This author has been identified as Apollodoros himself by various scholars, including Kapparis in his commentary on the speech.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Civil War, Breckinridge quickly became an ardent supporter of the Union, not for its position against slavery, but for the sake of preserving the Union. He used his position as editor of the Danville Quarterly Review to advocate his position. He called for harsh measures against secession, and in time, accepted President Lincoln's immediate emancipation of slaves. He was chosen as the temporary chair of the 1864 Republican National Convention that re-nominated Lincoln for president, and his pro-Union <b>speech</b> <b>was</b> hailed by freshman Representative James G. Blaine {{as one of the most}} inspiring given at the event.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{detailed}} wind tunnel tests Wilbur traveled to Chicago at Chanute's invitation {{to give a}} lecture to the Western Society of Engineers on September 18, 1901. He presented a thorough report about the 1900–01 glider experiments and complemented his talk with a lantern slide show of photographs. Wilbur's <b>speech</b> <b>was</b> the first public account of the brothers' experiments. A report {{was published in the}} Journal of the society, which was then separately published as an offprint titled Some Aeronautical Experiments in a 300 copy edition.|$|E

50|$|Three {{types of}} dream <b>speech</b> <b>were</b> {{considered}} by Kraepelin: disorders of word-selection (also called paraphasias), disorders of discourse (e.g. agrammatisms) and thought disorders. The most frequent occurring form of dream <b>speech</b> <b>is</b> a neologism.|$|R

5|$|Decisions by Republican {{incumbent}} Peter Fitzgerald and his Democratic predecessor Carol Moseley Braun to {{not participate}} in the election resulted in wide-open Democratic and Republican primary contests involving fifteen candidates. In the March 2004 primary election, Obama won in an unexpected landslide—which overnight made him a rising star within the national Democratic Party, started speculation about a presidential future, and led to the reissue of his memoir, Dreams from My Father. In July 2004, Obama delivered the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, seen by 9.1million viewers. His <b>speech</b> <b>was</b> well received and elevated his status within the Democratic Party.|$|E
5|$|Extracts of {{the speech}} {{appeared}} in The New Yorker on June 10. Several weeks later, The New York Times printed the whole text, quickly followed by Life magazine and Reader's Digest. Hand's message that liberty is safeguarded by everyday Americans struck a popular chord, and he suddenly found himself a folk hero. Though he enjoyed the acclaim, he thought it unmerited. His biographer Gerald Gunther, noting the paradox of the agnostic Hand's use of religious overtones, suggests that the most challenging aspect of the <b>speech</b> <b>was</b> {{that the spirit of}} liberty must entertain doubt.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, Narayan was {{nominated}} to the Rajya Sabha, the upper {{house of the}} Indian Parliament, for his contributions to literature. During his entire six-year term, he was focused on one issue—the plight of school children, especially the heavy load of school books and the negative effect of the system on a child's creativity, which was something that he first highlighted in his debut novel, Swami and Friends. His inaugural <b>speech</b> <b>was</b> focused on this particular problem, and resulted {{in the formation of}} a committee chaired by Prof. Yash Pal, to recommend changes to the school educational system.|$|E
40|$|<b>Speech</b> <b>is</b> {{generally}} {{looked upon}} as a succession {{of events in the}} time domain and analyzed frame by frame, while ignoring the fact that <b>speech</b> <b>is</b> dynamic.

50|$|A crucial {{semantic}} {{distinction between}} {{direct and indirect}} <b>speech</b> <b>is</b> that direct <b>speech</b> purports to report the exact words that were said or written, whereas indirect <b>speech</b> <b>is</b> a representation of speech in one's own words.|$|R
50|$|Speech {{disorders}} or <b>speech</b> impediments <b>are</b> a type {{of communication}} disorder where 'normal' <b>speech</b> <b>is</b> disrupted. This can mean stuttering, lisps, etc. Someone who is unable to speak due to a <b>speech</b> disorder <b>is</b> considered mute.|$|R
5|$|In October 1964, at a {{ceremony}} in honour of Soviet cosmonauts, Brezhnev called for the strengthening of the Party apparatus. This <b>speech</b> <b>was</b> {{only the beginning of}} a large campaign directed against Kosygin. Several newspapers, such as Pravda and Kommunist, criticised the work of the Council of Ministers, and indirectly Kosygin, its chairman, for planning the economy in an unrealistic fashion, and used the highly aggressive rhetoric previously used to condemn Khrushchev against Kosygin.|$|E
5|$|In his ministerial role, Constantine {{promoted}} {{development of}} Trinidad's road, rail, {{water and electricity}} infrastructure. However, in late 1958 {{he was accused of}} corruption, over a ship leasing deal. His angry response to the charge, in the Legislative Council, created a perception of arrogance among his colleagues, and suggested that he had not sufficiently adapted to parliamentary politics. According to Mason, the <b>speech</b> <b>was</b> a miscalculation which made the public, perhaps already sceptical of his commitment to Trinidad after so many years away, question his fitness for a ministerial role, a view increasingly held by commentators.|$|E
5|$|Krug {{was born}} Judith Fingeret in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on March 15, 1940. Her {{interest}} in freedom of <b>speech</b> <b>was</b> fostered {{from an early}} age. She recalled reading a book about sex education under the covers in her bedroom with a flashlight {{at the age of}} 12. Her mother found her and asked what she was doing. When she held up the book, her mother allowed her to continue reading and told her to turn on the bedroom light so she could read properly and avoid damage to her eyes.|$|E
