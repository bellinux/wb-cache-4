500|$|When Cloud Gates {{interior}} {{components were}} completed, construction crews {{prepared to work}} on the outer shell; this comprises 168stainless steel panels, each [...] thick and weighing [...] They were fabricated using three-dimensional modeling software. Computers and robots were essential in the bending and shaping of the plates, which was performed by English wheel and a robotic <b>scanning</b> <b>device.</b> Metal stiffeners were welded to each panel's interior face to provide a small degree of rigidity. About a third of the plates, along with the entire interior structure, were fabricated in Oakland. The plates were polished to 98percent of their final state and covered with protective white film before being sent to Chicago via trucks. Once in Chicago, the plates were welded together on-site, creating 2,442linear feet (744m) of welded seams. Welders used keyhole welding machines rather than traditional welding guns. The plates were fabricated so precisely that no on-site cutting or filing was necessary when lifting and fitting them into position.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the fact}} that people have been {{performing}} brachial plexus blocks for over a hundred years, there is as yet no clear evidence to support the assertion that one method of nerve localization is better than another. There are however numerous case reports documenting cases in which use of a portable ultrasound <b>scanning</b> <b>device</b> has detected abnormal anatomy that would otherwise not have been evident using a [...] "blind" [...] approach. On the other hand, use of ultrasound may create {{a false sense of security}} in the operator, which may lead to errors, especially if the needle tip is not adequately visualized at all times.|$|E

2500|$|As the {{radioisotope}} undergoes positron emission decay (also {{known as}} positive beta decay), it emits a positron, an antiparticle {{of the electron}} with opposite charge. The emitted positron travels in tissue for a short distance (typically less than 1mm, but dependent on the isotope), during which time it loses kinetic energy, until it decelerates {{to a point where}} it can interact with an electron. The encounter annihilates both electron and positron, producing a pair of annihilation (gamma) photons moving in approximately opposite directions. These are detected when they reach a scintillator in the <b>scanning</b> <b>device,</b> creating a burst of light which is detected by photomultiplier tubes or silicon avalanche photodiodes (Si APD). The technique depends on simultaneous or coincident detection of the pair of photons moving in approximately opposite directions (they would be exactly opposite in their [...] center of mass frame, but the scanner has no way to know this, and so has a built-in slight direction-error tolerance). Photons that do not arrive in temporal [...] "pairs" [...] (i.e. within a timing-window of a few nanoseconds) are ignored.|$|E
2500|$|Brachial plexus {{block is}} {{typically}} performed by an anesthesiologist. To achieve an optimal block, {{the tip of}} the needle should be close to the nerves of the plexus during the injection of local anesthetic solution. Commonly employed techniques for obtaining such a needle position include transarterial, elicitation of a paresthesia, and use of a peripheral nerve stimulator or a portable ultrasound <b>scanning</b> <b>device.</b> If the needle is close to or contacts a nerve, the subject may experience a paresthesia (a sudden tingling sensation, often described as feeling like [...] "pins and needles" [...] or like an electric shock) in the arm, hand, or fingers. Injection close to the point of elicitation of such a paresthesia may result in a good block. A peripheral nerve stimulator connected to an appropriate needle allows emission of electric current from the needle tip. When the needle tip is close to or contacts a motor nerve, characteristic contraction of the innervated muscle may be elicited. Modern portable ultrasound devices allow the user to visualize internal anatomy, including the nerves to be blocked, neighboring anatomic structures and the needle as it approaches the nerves. Observation of local anesthetic surrounding the nerves during ultrasound-guided injection is predictive of a successful block. Appropriate block per site-specific procedure are listed in the following table: ...|$|E
