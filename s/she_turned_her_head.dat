25|$|Helen is safely away {{to recover}} from her concussion. Inspector Morton asks each family member to account for {{themselves}} {{on the day of}} Cora Lansquenet's murder after which Poirot makes a surprising statement which shocked everyone present. Cora had not come to the funeral at all. It was Miss Gilchrist in disguise, as part of a plot for her own gain, leaving Cora home asleep from a sedative in her tea. Miss Gilchrist planted the idea that Richard Abernethie's death had been a murder - when Cora is murdered, it would seem that Richard's alleged murderer had killed Cora to silence her. None of the family had seen Cora for more than two decades, due to the ill-feeling {{at the time of her}} marriage. Miss Gilchrist copied her mannerisms and the only flaw in her portrayal was spotted by Helen Abernethie - Miss Gilchrist had rehearsed a characteristic turn of the head in a mirror, where the reflection is a reverse of reality; when she came to the house after the funeral, <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> to the left, not the right. After a timely conversation among the young cousins, Helen realises this difference. Miss Gilchrist gave herself away to Poirot by referring to the wax flowers on the green malachite table the first day the relatives gathered to select objects before the auction: these were on display on the day of the reading of Richard Abernethie's will but removed by the time Miss Gilchrist, as herself, visited Enderby Hall. She had deliberately poisoned herself with the arsenic-laced wedding cake to evade suspicion and appear yet another potential victim, which aroused suspicion.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the wedding}} ceremony, the royal {{procession}} was {{heading back to}} the Royal Palace when an assassination attempt was made on the King and Queen. When anarchist Mateu Morral threw a bomb from a balcony at the royal carriage. Victoria Eugenie's life was saved because, at the exact moment the bomb exploded, <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> in order to see St. Mary's Church, which Alfonso was showing her. She escaped injury, although her dress was spotted with the blood of a guard who was riding beside the carriage. [...] There exists a large statue in front of the Royal Monastery of San Jeronimo dedicated to the victims of the bombing of May 31, 1906.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> Groves {{had come}} once more within hearing.|$|E
60|$|RAINA (indignantly). I did {{not send}} it to you. (<b>She</b> <b>turns</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> away, and adds, reluctantly.) It was {{in the pocket of}} that coat.|$|R
6000|$|But {{through the}} rout one figure goes [...] With quick and quiet tread; Her robe is plain, her form is frail-- [...] Wait if <b>she</b> <b>turn</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> never <b>turns</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> Lady or servant, she has {{a purpose}} in her and can follow it. <b>She</b> never <b>turns</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> until <b>she</b> comes to the {{crossing}} where Jo plies with his broom. He crosses with her and begs. Still, <b>she</b> does not <b>turn</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> until <b>she</b> has landed on the other side. Then she slightly beckons to him and says, [...] "Come here!" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> towards me, and {{answered}} in her gayest tones.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> away, and I {{could see}} that she was crying.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> slowly, {{and looked}} at him with frightened, wide-open eyes.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> half <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> <b>Her</b> {{expression}} was scarcely encouraging.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> slowly <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> toward him, and a faint sigh escaped her.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> slowly <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> {{and looked}} at him with a dull surprise.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> {{and looked}} at him--a long, searching look with widened eyes.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> {{slowly and}} faced me. I shrank {{from looking at}} her.|$|E
60|$|Cecilia saw {{the back}} of Hilary's neck grow red. <b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> away.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> {{beautiful}} <b>head</b> {{and looked}} at the prince through narrowed eyes.|$|R
50|$|The episode {{ends with}} Elena driving {{back home in}} tears when {{suddenly}} a figure appears in front of her. She tries to avoid him but she hits him and her car flips over trapping her in the driver's seat. <b>She</b> <b>turns</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> and watches that the figure reanimates itself, gets up and starts walking towards her.|$|R
5000|$|The Little Girl (Ivy Bregman) - The Little Girl {{sleeps in}} her bed while the toys are dancing and in motion, but when <b>she</b> <b>turns</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> around sleeping, the toys return to their former poses as regular figures. She is only shown in the series' opening, in the ending part of an episode, and in the credits background.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> a little. It {{was obvious}} that he was {{speaking}} the truth.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> {{and looked}} at him. Her glance was reproving, her manner impatient.|$|E
60|$|So saying, <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> {{away and}} {{shut her eyes}} again, and so Rollo withdrew.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> aside <b>her</b> <b>head</b> {{with a deep}} hurt. Some {{things she}} could not bear.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Texas Dip" [...] is {{an extreme}} curtsey {{performed}} by a Texan debutante. The young woman slowly lowers her forehead to the floor by crossing her ankles, then bending her knees and sinking. The escort's hand is held during the dip. When the debutante's head nears the floor, <b>she</b> <b>turns</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> sideways, averting the risk of soiling her dress with lipstick.|$|R
60|$|Overhead, {{the larger}} stars {{came out and}} winked at me, and then, as the fields of space {{became more and more}} lighted with star-points, the hearth-fires to other homes of worlds, I thought how local, after all, is the great cone of shadow we men call night; for it is only nature's nightcap for the nodding earth, as <b>she</b> <b>turns</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> away from the sun to lie pillowed in space.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> {{and when}} she looked up and replied, her voice was rather hard.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> {{slowly and}} looked at him. Its angle was supercilious, her tone frigid.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> {{a little}} lazily {{and looked at}} her neighbour. His {{expression}} was entirely sympathetic.|$|E
40|$|The girl awakens to {{the bird}} on her face, some black and {{skeletal}} thing clawing at her ribs, flapping its wings {{over her mouth}} so she can 2 Ì† 7 t breathe. <b>She</b> <b>turns</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> away and throws her forearm over her face but still it will not leave her, this thing, this feathered thing that roused her {{from the depths of}} sleep and pinned her to the bed. Beak at [...] ...|$|R
60|$|Almayer {{dragged her}} up {{to her feet and}} looked close into her face while <b>she</b> struggled, <b>turning</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> away from his wild stare.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't understand," [...] <b>she</b> said, <b>turning</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> {{round with}} the slow motion of her beauty, and looking him {{full in the}} face.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> and reflected, glancing {{from one}} to the other of the pure, steady candle-flames.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> {{from the}} lattice, as if unable longer to endure a sight so terrible.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> indifferently as Alan's {{footsteps}} sounded on the pebbles, {{and then}} stood slowly up.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll ask him," [...] <b>she</b> replied, <b>turning</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> to {{look for}} him. But he and Cassandra were absorbed in the aye-aye once more.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing," [...] <b>she</b> answered, <b>turning</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> away {{toward the}} window, {{and looking out}} {{mechanically}} at the falling rain. [...] "Only my own thoughts." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{suddenly}} relapsed {{into her}} curious habit. Her lips moved, but no words came. <b>She</b> had <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> {{a little and}} was facing the sea.|$|R
