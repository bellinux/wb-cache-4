At the same time, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) <b>starts</b> <b>up</b> a fake relationship with actor James Franco in order to counteract rumors {{that he is in}} love with a Japanese body pillow.

The fight starts and {{it is obvious that}} Homer cannot {{withstand}} Tatum's barrage and is in danger of being knocked out. Homer decides to fight back, but misses completely. As Tatum readies himself to deliver the final blow, Moe flies in using the Fan Man's paramotor and carries Homer away. Outside the arena, Marge thanks Moe for saving Homer and Tatum shows respect for the love Moe showed for Homer. Sweet declares that Moe will always be a loser, but still gives him a check for $100,000. Moe <b>starts</b> <b>up</b> the paramotor and flies off into the night.|$|E
5|$|Following this, Joan {{begins to}} gather troops {{and she takes}} her army to the forests around Orleans. While they camp there, a girl named Isabel comes and begins to {{describe}} the events surrounding siege of the city. Joan sends a messenger to offer the English peace, but the English decline. The French attack the English and, {{as soon as they}} start, a storm <b>starts</b> <b>up</b> and lightning flashes about them. This scares the English and Joan is able to win and enter the city. Soon after, Joan is able to lift the siege. The story continues with various French victories and the English are pushed back from fort after fort. Eventually, the English are pushed back to Tourelles. While the English fight their way there, one of the generals, Salisbury, is able to wound Joan. Her companion, Theodore, is able to kill Salisbury in return but he is brought down by the general Talbot. The French soon lay siege to Tourelles and begin a bloody fight to take the fort. During the battle, the French take many captives and the generals wish to execute them. However, Joan intervenes and ensures the safety of the captives' lives.|$|E

40|$|Under a {{constant}} applied load, {{the operation of}} a typical elastohydrodynamic lubrication involves three stages, namely the <b>start</b> <b>up</b> stage, the normal steady state operation stage and the shut down stage. Previous works focused on the second normal steady state operation stage, in which a continuous lubricant film is separating the contacting surfaces. This dissertation numerically and analytically studies the lubrication behavior in the <b>start</b> <b>up</b> and shut down stages of elastohydrodynamic lubrication operations. ^ A mixed phase lubricated-solid contact model is developed to study the <b>start</b> <b>up</b> stage and demonstrates {{the transition from the}} initial solid to solid contact, to the mixed lubricated-solid contact, and finally to the fully lubricated contact. A surface temperature model is developed to calculate the surface temperature rise in the <b>start</b> <b>up</b> process of circular contact in sliding conditions. Because of the solid contact occurring during this process, significant frictional heat is generated and the surface temperature rise is very high. ^ The shut down process of elastohydrodynamic lubrication operation is studied and the numerical results are compared with the experimental results. Because of the characteristics of EHL flow, analytical expressions are derived to predict the pressure and film thickness changes during the shut down process and these predictions agree well with the numerical results. ^ Surface pocket effects in line contact <b>start</b> <b>up</b> condition are then examined in an effort to achieve beneficial tribological performance through surface modification. In the initial static contact situation, lubricant trapped inside the pocket generates hydrostatic pressure and reduces the pressure spikes and subsurface stresses, compared with the dry contact situation. When the surfaces start to move, this hydrostatic pressure enables a pocket lubricant film build up in addition to the inlet lubricant film build <b>up.</b> Essentially the <b>start</b> <b>up</b> process is divided into two parallel micro-EHL <b>start</b> <b>ups.</b> The <b>start</b> <b>up</b> time is reduced and the solid contact vanishes faster than the smooth surface <b>start</b> <b>up.</b> As a result, the frictional heat in the <b>start</b> <b>up</b> process would be much smaller and subsequently the surface temperature rise would be much reduced, compared with the smooth surface <b>start</b> <b>up</b> condition. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{automobile}} manufacturers aspire {{to improve the}} engine design and enhance its life apart from optimizing the energy usage in the actual engine operation. A major concern {{at the time of}} the initial <b>start</b> <b>up</b> at the low loads and speed conditions is the wear of an engine. A significant proportion of the engine life gets compromised due to the adhesive engine <b>start</b> <b>up</b> wear. The <b>start</b> <b>up</b> wear does not exist during the normal engine operation due to the fully established elastohydrodynamic lubricating (EHL) film between the interacting surfaces of the piston assembly and the cylinder liner at the high loads, speeds and the optimum piston-to-bore radial clearances. Such arrangements do not exist in a few initial engine <b>start</b> <b>up</b> cycles. Resultantly, the piston skirts and the 1 st compression ring establish a physical contact with the liner and adhesive wear occurs. This PhD research work numerically models the lubrication of the piston skirts and the 1 st compression ring in the initial engine <b>start</b> <b>up.</b> The 2 -D hydrodynamic and EHL models of the piston skirts are developed in the initial engine <b>start</b> <b>up</b> conditions. The initial engine <b>start</b> <b>up</b> conditions cover the secondary transverse piston displacements and the different <b>start</b> <b>up</b> speeds, radial clearances & viscosity-grades of an engine lubricant. The realistic aspects include the isothermal & adiabatic conditions, the steady-state and transient conditions, the Newtonian and non-Newtonian engine lubricant behavior, the surface roughness factors of the piston skirts and the liner. These aspects are modeled, studied and analyzed separately as part of the hydrodynamic and EHL models of the skirts. The 1 -D and the 2 -D steady-state isothermal Newtonian lubrication models of 1 st compression ring are developed as applicable to the initial engine <b>start</b> <b>up</b> conditions. The simulation analysis are studied to optimize the different realistic aspects/characteristics in an effort to reduce the engine <b>start</b> <b>up</b> wea...|$|R

25|$|Sodium bicarbonate, {{regular or}} {{ordinary}} used on class B and C fires, {{was the first}} of the dry chemical agents developed. In the heat of a fire, it releases a cloud of carbon dioxide that smothers the fire. That is, the gas drives oxygen away from the fire, thus stopping the chemical reaction. This agent is not generally effective on class A fires because the agent is expended and the cloud of gas dissipates quickly, and if the fuel is still sufficiently hot, the fire <b>starts</b> <b>up</b> again. While liquid and gas fires do not usually store much heat in their fuel source, solid fires do. Sodium bicarbonate was very common in commercial kitchens before the advent of wet chemical agents, but now is falling out of favor, as it is much less effective than wet chemical agents for class K fires, less effective than Purple-K for class B fires, and is ineffective on class A fires.

25|$|The band holds tryouts usually {{two weeks}} before school starts.

In recent years, DCI Finals night was held on a Saturday night, while OSUMB Candidate Days (for all prospective band members who have not made the band before) would begin the following Sunday morning. Due to a tighter schedule in 2016, Candidate Days were held during DCI Finals, and full band tryouts began the following morning. Typically this is avoided however, to allow incoming freshmen to finish a drum corps tour and then learn the OSU style in the two days prior to full band tryouts.

Many shows must be learned in as little as four days, with all music and drill committed to memory.|$|E
