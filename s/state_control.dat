5|$|An {{extension}} to the Northwestern Highway was again proposed in 1966 {{to connect with}} the proposed I-275 extension. The I-275 project was then cancelled in 1977.

5|$|Main reforms {{concerning}} the Roman Catholic Church were initiated {{and carried out}} under Maria Theresa, while the reforms under her son concerned their non-Catholic subjects. The ecclesiastical policies of Maria Theresa, like those of her devout predecessors, were based not on anti-religious principles, but on ensuring primacy of <b>State</b> <b>control</b> in Church-State relations.|$|E

5|$|The I-94/US12 freeway in {{opened in}} Calhoun County in 1960. At this time, Eaton Avenue was {{transferred}} to <b>state</b> <b>control,</b> {{and the rest of}} the former route of US12 through Albion was redesignated Business US Highway 12 (Bus. US12). Later that year, Bus. US12 was redesignated BL I-94.|$|E

5|$|Another {{change was}} the {{transition}} to the use of judges as the electoral returning officer for South Australia. This was done to impose <b>state</b> <b>control</b> on a system which had effectively combined the administration of the national and state electoral rolls. On 27 May 1925, Denny arranged the appointment of Judge Herbert Kingsley Paine of the Insolvency Court to be appointed as Electoral Officer for the state, replacing Charles Mathews, a state public servant who had held the position since 1907. Denny had previously worked for Paine as a legal associate.|$|E

5|$|Another coup in June 1966, the {{so-called}} Argentine Revolution, brought Juan Carlos Onganía to power. Ongania appointed Adalbert Krieger Vasena {{to head the}} Economy Ministry. His strategy implied a very active role for the public sector in guiding the process of economic growth, calling for <b>state</b> <b>control</b> over the money supply, wages and prices, and bank credit to the private sector.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, {{the freeway}} was {{extended}} eastward {{a few blocks}} through a junction with the newly opened Chrysler Freeway (I-75) to its present-day eastern terminus near Conant Street. The state requested additional Interstate Highway System mileage that year as well, and in the proposals submitted was a request to extend the Davison to I-96 and I-94. These plans to transfer the freeway to <b>state</b> <b>control</b> and extend it were dropped in the 1970s after opposition to another freeway in Detroit. The plans would have extended it west to the Jeffries and east to a Van Dyke Freeway (extended M-53). Upon its transfer to <b>state</b> <b>control</b> in 1993, it had previously been a county-maintained freeway, the Davison Freeway was designated as M-8. Three years later, the Davison was closed {{for a year and}} a half to reconstruct it to Interstate Highway standards with an additional through travel lane and a wider left shoulder for improved safety and traffic handling as well as a new interchange with Woodward Avenue. The reconstructed freeway was reopened on October 8, 1997 by Governor John Engler.|$|E
5|$|In some {{countries}} the monarch had {{little control over}} lords, or required {{the construction of new}} castles to aid in securing the land so was unconcerned about granting permission– {{as was the case in}} England in the aftermath of the Norman Conquest and the Holy Land during the Crusades. Switzerland is an extreme case of there being no <b>state</b> <b>control</b> over who built castles, and as a result there were 4,000 in the country. There are very few castles dated with certainty from the mid-9thcentury. Converted into a donjon around 950, Château de Doué-la-Fontaine in France is the oldest standing castle in Europe.|$|E

5|$|The current M-199 {{was once}} part of M-17 {{starting}} around July 1, 1919. When the US Highway System was created on November 11, 1926, the highway was incorporated into US12.

The current highway routing was transferred to <b>state</b> <b>control</b> on October 1, 1998, and the M-199 designation was subsequently assigned to the trunkline. The highway has remained unchanged since designation.|$|E
5|$|The last tenet, '{{socialism}}', did {{not mean}} socialism as it is defined in the West, but rather a unique form of Arab socialism. Aflaq coined the word Arab socialism for his variant of socialism. Socialism, in its original form in the Arab world had, according to Aflaq, first come into being {{under the rule of}} Muhammad. The point of Arab socialism was not to answer questions such as: how much <b>state</b> <b>control</b> was necessary, or economic equality; but instead Arab socialism was a system that freed the Arab people from oppression and enslavement, which in turn created independent individuals.|$|E
