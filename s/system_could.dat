5|$|As a {{response}} to the poor reception and claims that the <b>system</b> <b>could</b> not handle the original game, Simon Thomley, who later assisted with the development of the 2013 mobile port, released an unofficial, proof-of-concept version of Sonic the Hedgehog for the system. The unofficial version contains a complete Green Hill Zone and two special stages, as well as Tails and Knuckles as playable characters.|$|E
5|$|As work on Nike-X began, {{high-ranking}} {{military and}} civilian officials began to press for Zeus deployment as an interim system {{in spite of the}} known problems. They argued the <b>system</b> <b>could</b> be upgraded in-place as the new technologies became available. McNamara was opposed to early deployment, while Congressman Daniel J. Flood would be a prime force for immediate deployment.|$|E

5|$|During the {{modernization}} in the 1980s, three important weapons {{were added to}} the Iowa-class battleships. The first was the CIWS anti-aircraft/anti-missile system discussed above. The other two were missiles for use against both land and sea targets. At one point the NATO Sea Sparrow was to be installed on the reactivated battleships; however, it was determined that the <b>system</b> <b>could</b> not withstand the over-pressure effects when the main battery was fired.|$|E
5|$|In April 1962, McNamara {{asked the}} Nike team to {{consider}} using the Zeus site on Kwajalein as an operational anti-satellite base after the main Zeus testing had completed. The Nike team responded that a <b>system</b> <b>could</b> be readied for testing by May 1963. The concept {{was given the}} name Project Mudflap.|$|E
5|$|Some {{harmless}} {{milk snake}} (Lampropeltis triangulum) subspecies, the moderately toxic false coral snakes (genus Erythrolamprus), and the deadly coral snakes (genus Micrurus) {{all have a}} red background color with black and white / yellow rings. In this system, both the milk snakes and the deadly coral snakes are mimics, whereas the false coral snakes are the model. It has also been suggested that this <b>system</b> <b>could</b> be an instance of pseudomimicry, the similar colour patterns having evolved independently in similar habitats.|$|E

5|$|There were, of course, {{numerous}} {{reasons for}} maintaining roads. A unified political <b>system</b> <b>could</b> be maintained {{only as long}} as the government had the means of quickly dispatching officials, troops, or messengers as needed. Such a system of transportation, once established, facilitated commerce. At the local level, road and bridge projects seem to have been initiated as much for the sake of traveling merchants as for officials.|$|E
5|$|This led to {{proposals}} {{for a new}} radar dedicated solely to the early warning role, determining only which MAR or SCD would ultimately {{have to deal with}} the threat. Used primarily in the first minutes of the attack, and not responsible for the engagements, the <b>system</b> <b>could</b> be considered disposable and did not need anything like the sophistication or hardening of the MAR. This led to the Perimeter Acquisition Radar (PAR), which would operate cheaper electronics at VHF frequencies.|$|E
5|$|A recent {{development}} {{is the use of}} the RDS system of car radios. The ambulance is fitted with a short range FM transmitter, set to RDS code 31, which interrupts the radio of all cars within range, {{in the manner of a}} traffic broadcast, but in such a way that the user of the receiving radio is unable to opt out of the message (as with traffic broadcasts). This feature is built into every RDS radio for use in national emergency broadcast systems, but short range units on emergency vehicles can prove an effective means of alerting traffic to their presence. It is, however, unlikely that this <b>system</b> <b>could</b> replace audible warnings, as it is unable to alert pedestrians, those not using a compatible radio or even have it turned off.|$|E
30|$|Some {{government}} employments {{like the}} military and police consider one’s age as a requirement. Age estimation <b>systems</b> <b>could</b> {{be used to determine}} age of the recruits during recruitment process. It is also a policy of several governments that employees should retire after reaching a particular age. Age estimation <b>systems</b> <b>could</b> also {{play a significant role in}} finding if one has reached retirement age.|$|R

5|$|As Tropical Storm Dorothy moved {{further into}} the Caribbean Sea, it began a gradual {{weakening}} trend initiated by a persistent tropical upper tropospheric trough, {{as well as the}} presence of strong wind shear and a lack of inflow. Hurricane Hunter flights late on August21 and early on August22 failed to locate a closed low-level circulation, and as a result the storm was downgraded to a tropical depression. After another flight into the <b>system</b> <b>could</b> not detect a circulation, the NHC discontinued advisories on Dorothy to the south of Hispaniola late on August22. Around the same time, thunderstorms increased in association with the cyclone, and forecasters remarked the potential for re-intensification over the western Caribbean Sea. However, the storm became more disorganized, and on August23 Dorothy degenerated into a tropical wave.|$|E
5|$|DNA walkers are a {{class of}} nucleic acid nanomachines that exhibit {{directional}} motion along a linear track. A large number of schemes have been demonstrated. One strategy is to control {{the motion of the}} walker along the track using control strands that need to be manually added in sequence. Another approach is to make use of restriction enzymes or deoxyribozymes to cleave the strands and cause the walker to move forward, which has the advantage of running autonomously. A later <b>system</b> <b>could</b> walk upon a two-dimensional surface rather than a linear track, and demonstrated the ability to selectively pick up and move molecular cargo. Additionally, a linear walker has been demonstrated that performs DNA-templated synthesis as the walker advances along the track, allowing autonomous multistep chemical synthesis directed by the walker. The synthetic DNA walkers' function {{is similar to that of}} the proteins dynein and kinesin.|$|E
5|$|General {{relativity}} is non-linear: {{the gravitational}} influence of two masses {{is not simply}} the sum of those masses' individual gravitational influences, as had {{been the case in}} Newtonian gravity. Ehlers participated in the discussion of how the back-reaction from gravitational radiation onto a radiating <b>system</b> <b>could</b> be systematically described in a non-linear theory such as general relativity, pointing out that the standard quadrupole formula for the energy flux for systems like the binary pulsar had not (yet) been rigorously derived: a priori, a derivation demanded the inclusion of higher-order terms than was commonly assumed, higher than were computed until then.|$|E

5|$|On November 1, {{convection}} {{increased in}} the complex system that absorbed the remnants of Nicholas, and the National Hurricane Center indicated the <b>system</b> <b>could</b> develop into a tropical or subtropical cyclone at any time. The low continued quickly westward, generating only sporadic convection, and crossed Florida on November 3. After entering the Gulf of Mexico, it turned to the west-northwest, and without organizing it made landfall in southeast Louisiana on November 4. It continued inland, and quickly weakened over Louisiana and Mississippi on November 5.|$|E
5|$|One of the cruiser's early {{commanding}} officers, Royal Navy Captain J.W.A. Waller, {{believed that}} the ship's single director control tower was a weak point in the design. The director control tower was the highest compartment on the ship, from where personnel would determine the range and optimum firing angle for a gun salvo, then transmit this information to the gun turrets: the actual firing could be controlled from the tower or the turret. Waller {{believed that the}} centralised <b>system</b> <b>could</b> be destroyed with a single hit, or the wiring linking the compartment to the turrets could be severed, forcing the four turrets to rely on independent control. Although Waller suggested that a second tower be installed aft to provide redundancy, it was deferred indefinitely as subsequent commanding officers did not share his concerns, and combat experiences of other Leander-class cruisers showed that the system was more robust than expected.|$|E
5|$|QPR's {{victory was}} the first {{occasion}} a team from the Third Division had won a major trophy in England. Both teams received £18,000 as {{their share of the}} gate receipts. QPR's victory created a problem for the Football League management committee. On previous occasions, one of the three nominations for the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup was the winner of the League Cup. However, the Fairs Cup committee required that only teams from the highest tier of a nation's league <b>system</b> <b>could</b> enter. In the end, Nottingham Forest, Leeds United and Liverpool qualified for the following season's competition.|$|E

In general, however, there was little warning for the flooding in South Florida. While Leslie was moving east-northeastward, it posed a threat to Bermuda, prompting officials to issue a tropical storm watch at 0300UTC on October6. Six hours later, tropical storm watch was upgraded to a tropical storm warning. However, the storm passed well to the west, and the warnings were dropped by late on October6.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet {{news media}} and {{government}} officials soon began to discuss the apparent substandard construction styles that had caused so many of Armenia's buildings to collapse. Gorbachev, in a TV interview several weeks after his expedited return from New York City, said that the concrete blocks had been built with more than enough sand but too little concrete, and suggested that the concrete had been stolen. , deputy chairman of the state building committee, stated that many newer homes collapsed as well {{and that he was}} beginning an investigation into the matter and that criminal charges would be brought.
