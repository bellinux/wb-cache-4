60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> imploringly--reassured, yet awed by his gentleness.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> quietly, {{wondering}} whether she should answer.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> {{suddenly}} white, bewildered, {{a little}} doubtful.|$|E
60|$|Without moving <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> {{with a sort}} of miserable inquiry.|$|R
5000|$|A.J., {{who said}} he had stomach flu, angrily tells Meadow he took some Pepto-Bismol when <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> filling his plate at lunch.|$|R
6000|$|MALISE {{shakes his}} head, then draws {{back from her}} again, as if [...] afraid to be too close. And again, unseen, <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
60|$|She laughed understandingly. Her eyes twinkled as <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> curiously--as {{one might}} regard a wild beast.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> indignantly, {{but without}} any trace of fear.|$|E
6000|$|... "In Scotland, doubtless," [...] said <b>she,</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with a {{sharp and}} {{suspicious}} eye, [...] "and enrich strangers with our rescued wealth--Ha! young man?" ...|$|R
60|$|Why did <b>she</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> like that? Ugly girl! How hateful ugly people were! When she was gone, he reopened {{the door}} of the waiting-room, and listened.|$|R
60|$|SYLVIA (leaning {{back across}} the couch, aside to Charteris). Has she really chucked you? (He nods assent. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> dubiously, and adds) I expect you chucked her.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with a long, slow look, malevolent, supercilious.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with a {{severity}} {{which was}} obviously assumed.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> He was sad, {{therefore}} she softened instantly.|$|E
60|$|On a {{table near}} her {{is a rich}} bauble of a casket, barred and clasped like an old strong-chest. <b>She,</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> still, takes it to her and unlocks it.|$|R
60|$|GLORIA. She {{has never}} {{mentioned}} your name to me. (He groans involuntarily. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> rather contemptuously and continues) Except once; {{and then she}} did remind me of something I had forgotten.|$|R
60|$|Was it his fancy, or did <b>she</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> for {{a moment}} more intently during the {{momentary}} silence which followed his speech? It must have been his fancy. Yet her next words puzzled him.|$|R
60|$|Very slowly {{her eyebrows}} rose up. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> doubtfully.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Ratcliffe's {{tone was}} sharp and <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> steadily.|$|E
60|$|Her {{lips parted}} and closed again. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> very steadily.|$|E
6000|$|... "What is it, John?" [...] said <b>she,</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with an anxious, loving face, for {{she knew}} well {{how much of}} his heart was there in that house which {{he said he could}} no longer enter.|$|R
5000|$|Sonnet 141 ~ 145: The man expresses {{his real}} love about the Dark Lady. Although she chases someone now, he {{is waiting for}} her and will wait her until <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> again. He earnestly wants to be loved by her.|$|R
6000|$|... 'My mother's, and my grandmother's,' said <b>she,</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> {{no longer}} as at a {{possible}} husband, but as a strange fossilized relic in human form. Pierston saw it, but meaning {{to give up the}} game he did not care to spare himself.|$|R
60|$|She {{was still}} frightened, and <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> a little piteously.|$|E
60|$|Still <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> steadily, {{and still}} said not one word.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly {{the door}} opened, and Annie entered. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> questioningly.|$|E
60|$|This time he {{does not}} touch her. But his face looks so wicked and menacing, as he stands leaning against the sun-dial-setting, as it were, his black mark upon the very face of dayâ€”that her flight is arrested by horror as <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
6000|$|CHARTERIS. No. Of course not. (She {{comes forward}} {{on her side}} of the table. He retreats on his side of it. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with utter scorn; sweeps across to the couch; and sits down imperially. With a great sigh of relief he drops into Paramore's chair.) ...|$|R
50|$|Philip {{suspects}} that Rachel tried to poison him and, with Louise's help, searches her room. They find nothing to incriminate Rachel {{and wonder if}} they are misjudging her. Meanwhile, Rachel has walked to the terraced garden and stepped onto the bridge over the sunken garden. Philip finds her broken body lying amongst the timber and stone. He takes her in his arms, and <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> calling him Ambrose before she dies.|$|R
60|$|The hot color {{burned in}} her cheeks. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> confused--reproachful.|$|E
60|$|Anthea {{felt her}} face grow warm, but <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> steadily.|$|E
60|$|Revelation illumined {{her mind}} as in a flash. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> {{sideways}} <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with critical meditation tenderly rendered.|$|R
60|$|She {{leaned back}} in her seat. <b>She</b> was <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> incredulously.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> was <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> open-eyed. Her {{face was}} white and shocked.|$|R
