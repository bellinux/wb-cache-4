Distributed archiving of Usenet posts was suggested in November 1982 by Scott Orshan, who proposed that [...] "Every site should keep all the articles it posted, forever." [...] Also in November of that year, Rick Adams responded to a post asking [...] "Has anyone archived netnews, or does anyone plan to?" [...] by stating that he was, [...] "afraid to admit it, but I started archiving most 'useful' newsgroups as of September 18." [...] In June 1982, Gregory G.

2500|$|The General Post Office (GPO) was {{the anchor}} tenant, which only {{moved in a}} {{fortnight}} after the Fullerton Building's official opening. GPO covered the two lower floors with postal halls, offices and sorting rooms. There were mail drops through which mail would fall to a band conveyor on the basement and dispatched up to the sorting room. One {{of the most memorable}} features is its curved service counter which was almost 90m long. The basement was linked to a 35-metre subway, also called the GPO tunnel [...] that ran underneath Fullerton Road to a pier. [...] From there, a lift would bring bags of mail to the Master Attendant’s Pier, and then transferred onto ships that were anchored at the pier. <b>Special</b> <b>mail</b> was all sent to the neighbouring countries via sea, which was the main transport back then, thus requiring at least 2 months to reach United Kingdom [...] This is further delayed by the fact that all mail had to be personally sorted by hands.|$|E

[...] "And a wretched state of mind I was in, between my anxiety to give the {{medicine}} to poor dear Keller immediately, and my fear of taking such a serious responsibility entirely on myself. Madame Fontaine, always just in her views, said, 'You had better wait and consult the doctors.' She made but one condition (the generous creature!) relating to herself. 'If the remedy is tried,' she said, 'I must ask you {{to give it a}} fair chance by permitting me to act as nurse; the treatment of the patient when he begins to feel the benefit of the medicine is of serious importance. I know this from my husband's instructions, and it is due to his memory (to say nothing of what is due to Mr. Keller) that I should be at the bedside.' It is needless to say that I joyfully accepted the offered help. So the night passed. The next morning, soon after you fell asleep, the doctors came. You may imagine what they thought of poor Keller, when I tell you that they recommended me to write instantly to Fritz in London summoning him to his father's bedside. I was just in time to catch the <b>special</b> <b>mail</b> which left this morning. Don't blame me, David. I could not feel absolutely sure of the new medicine; and, with time of such terrible importance, and London so far off, I was really afraid to miss a post." ...|$|E
