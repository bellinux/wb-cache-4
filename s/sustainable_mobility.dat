Along with transportation initiatives, the plan outlined steps to clean up brownfields, create affordable housing, utilize open spaces, provide cleaner and more reliable and efficient energy sources, improve water quality and infrastructure, achieve cleaner air quality, and address climate change issues. The transportation initiatives support greater use of mass transit through various improvements and additions to transit infrastructure and services. In addition, the initiatives also include increased use of cycling, expanded ferry services, increased traffic violation enforcement, and installations of Muni Meters and an intelligent transportation system. Of the 16 proposed transportation initiatives in PlaNYC, the congestion pricing program is the only component {{that has to be}} approved by the New York State Legislature with financial support from the State; the remainder is within New York City's or its regional jurisdiction and is to be funded by a new <b>Sustainable</b> <b>Mobility</b> and Regional Transportation Financing Authority, which would also take in revenue from the congestion fees, estimated at $380 million.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSustainable urban {{mobility}} planning, a strategic planning concept {{promoted by the}} European Commission, considers the engagement of citizens and stakeholders throughout the <b>Sustainable</b> Urban <b>Mobility</b> Plan (SUMP) development process {{as one of the}} key elements. Involving communities in planning is a fundamental duty of local authorities to improve decision-making and is also a requirement stipulated by EU directives and international conventions. This paper looks at academic research on participation in <b>sustainable</b> urban <b>mobility</b> planning, citizen and stakeholder engagement practices in European cities, as well as the challenges of collaborative planning and how to overcome these. The authors make the case that although some participation questions remain unsolved to date, citizen and stakeholder engagement are a precondition for <b>sustainable</b> urban <b>mobility</b> planning...|$|R

In 2012, the program had a total revenue of about €20.3 million and net earnings after expenses of over €13 million.

The European Commission adopted the Urban Mobility Package “Together towards competitive and resource-efficient urban mobility” in December 2013. <b>Sustainable</b> urban <b>mobility</b> planning is emphasized in the Urban Mobility Package alongside urban freight distribution, urban access regulations, deployment of intelligent transportation system (ITS) solutions in urban areas and road traffic safety.
