40|$|Online <b>social</b> <b>networks</b> are <b>used</b> by {{hundreds}} of millions of people every day, but little is known about their effect on behavior. In five experiments, the authors demonstrate that <b>social</b> <b>network</b> <b>use</b> enhances self-esteem in users who are focused on close friends (i. e., strong ties) while browsing their <b>social</b> <b>network.</b> This momentary increase in self-esteem reduces self-control, leading those focused on strong ties to display less self-control after browsing a <b>social</b> <b>network.</b> Additionally, the authors present evidence suggesting that greater <b>social</b> <b>network</b> <b>use</b> is associated with a higher body mass index and higher levels of credit card debt for individuals with strong ties to their <b>social</b> <b>network.</b> This research extends previous findings by demonstrating that <b>social</b> <b>networks</b> primarily enhance self-esteem for those focused on strong ties during <b>social</b> <b>network</b> <b>use.</b> Additionally, this research has implications for policy makers because self-control is an important mechanism for maintaining social order and well-being. © 2012 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc...|$|R

40|$|As <b>social</b> <b>network</b> <b>use</b> {{continues}} to increase, {{an important question}} for marketers is whether consumers’ online shopping activities are related to their <b>use</b> of <b>social</b> <b>networks</b> and, if so, what {{the nature of this}} relationship is. On the one hand, spending time on <b>social</b> <b>networks</b> could facilitate <b>social</b> discovery, meaning that consumers “discover” or “stumble upon” products through connections they have to others. Moreover, cumulative <b>social</b> <b>network</b> <b>use</b> could expose consumers to new shopping-related information, possibly with greater marginal value than the incremental time spent on a shopping website. This process may therefore be associated with increased shopping activity. On the other hand, <b>social</b> <b>network</b> <b>use</b> could be a substitute for other online activities, including shopping. To test the relationship between <b>social</b> <b>network</b> <b>use</b> and online shopping, the authors leverage a unique consumer panel data set that tracks individuals’ browsing of shopping and <b>social</b> <b>network</b> websites and their online purchasing activities over one year. The authors find that greater cumulative usage of social networking sites is positively associated with shopping activity. However, they also find a short-term negative relationship, such that immediately after a period of increased usage of social networking sites, online shopping activity appears to be lower...|$|R

40|$|Online <b>social</b> <b>networks</b> are {{incredibly}} popular, yet relatively {{little research has}} examined why people use them or the impact they have on their users. This paper examines a cause and a consequence of online <b>social</b> <b>network</b> <b>use.</b> In particular, it investigates why people use the popular microblogging feature on online <b>social</b> <b>networks</b> and how this behavior affects consumer well-being. Our main premise is that microblogging can serve as an emotion regulation tool. It offers consumers a way to share self-relevant information and anticipate a response from online friends, boosting well-being via perceived social support. The current research adds {{to the understanding of}} online <b>social</b> <b>network</b> <b>use</b> and how it affects consumer welfare. The current research investigates both the causes and consequence of online <b>social</b> <b>network</b> <b>use.</b> Low emotionally stable individuals experience emotions more intensely and have difficulty regulating their emotions on their own. Consequently, we suggest that they use the microblogging feature on online <b>social</b> <b>networks</b> (e. g., Tweets or Facebook status updates) to help regulate their emotions. Accordingly, we find that less emotionally stable individuals microblog more frequently and share their emotions more when doing so, a tendency that is no...|$|R

40|$|This master 2 ̆ 7 s thesis {{sought to}} extend social {{identification}} research further into <b>social</b> <b>network</b> sites by examine how online interactions may affect offline behaviors. In particular, this thesis argues that alumni who {{interact with their}} university or major via a <b>social</b> <b>network</b> site, should have an increased intention to donate back to their university or major. Despite {{a large body of}} research on both social identification and <b>social</b> <b>network</b> <b>use,</b> less research has combined the two in order to predict external behaviors. As such, data was collected from 277 undergraduate and graduate students at Illinois State University regarding their university and major social identification as well as their <b>social</b> <b>network</b> <b>use.</b> Data were analyzed using a t-test and multiple linear regressions. The findings from this research suggest that <b>social</b> <b>network</b> site <b>use</b> is a significant variable to increase an alumni 2 ̆ 7 s intent to donate. However, contrary to previous research, superordinate university social identification was a stronger predictor of intent to donate when compared to subordinate major social identification.

40|$|Background {{and aims}} Internet gaming {{addiction}} {{appears to be}} related to self-concept deficits and increased angular gyrus (AG) -related identification with one’s avatar. For increased <b>social</b> <b>network</b> <b>use,</b> a few existing studies suggest striatal-related positive social feedback as an underlying factor. However, whether an impaired self-concept and its reward-based compensation through the online presentation of an idealized version of the self are related to pathological <b>social</b> <b>network</b> <b>use</b> has not been investigated yet. We aimed to compare different stages of pathological Internet game and <b>social</b> <b>network</b> <b>use</b> to explore the neural basis of avatar and self-identification in addictive use. Methods About 19 pathological Internet gamers, 19 pathological <b>social</b> <b>network</b> users, and 19 healthy controls underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while completing a self-retrieval paradigm, asking participants to rate the degree to which various self-concept-related characteristics described their self, ideal, and avatar. Self-concept-related characteristics were also psychometrically assessed. Results Psychometric testing indicated that pathological Internet gamers exhibited higher self-concept deficits generally, whereas pathological <b>social</b> <b>network</b> users exhibit deficits in emotion regulation only. We observed left AG hyperactivations in Internet gamers during avatar reflection and a correlation with symptom severity. Striatal hypoactivations during self-reflection (vs. ideal reflection) were observed in <b>social</b> <b>network</b> users and were correlated with symptom severity. Discussion and conclusion Internet gaming addiction appears to be linked to increased identification with one’s avatar, evidenced by high left AG activations in pathological Internet gamers. Addiction to <b>social</b> <b>networks</b> seems to be characterized by emotion regulation deficits, reflected by reduced striatal activation during self-reflection compared to during ideal reflection...|$|R

40|$|Objectives This study {{explores the}} {{interaction}} between online social networking experiences and wellbeing in 12 young people accessing mental health services. Methods Data from semi-structured interviews was analysed using Grounded Theory methodology. Results “Threats and judgement” and “connection and support” were experienced by adolescents, facilitated by having continuous access to a vast <b>social</b> <b>network.</b> These experiences influenced adolescents' psychological wellbeing, mediated by their responses to threat and judgement and maintaining “safe sharing” with their <b>network.</b> <b>Social</b> <b>network</b> <b>use</b> was conceived as a gamble of balancing its potentially positive and negative impact in {{a culture in which}} <b>social</b> <b>network</b> <b>use</b> appears to be unavoidable. Conclusions The findings indicate the importance of routine assessment and formulation of social networking use in understanding adolescents' psychological distress. Furthermore, a range of opportunities exist for clinicians to utilise the anonymity and peer support that <b>social</b> <b>networks</b> offer to broaden the range of mental health services offered to young people...|$|R
