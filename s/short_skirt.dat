5|$|The Bloomer {{became a}} fashion fad during the {{following}} months, as women from Toledo to New York City and Lowell, Massachusetts, held reform-dress social events and festivals. Supporters gathered signatures to a “Declaration of Independence from the Despotism of Parisian Fashion” and organized dress-reform societies. A few Garrisonian supporters of women’s rights took prominent part in these activities, and one offered silk to any of his friends who would {{make it into a}} <b>short</b> <b>skirt</b> and trousers for a public dress. Stone accepted the offer.|$|E
5|$|Stone {{found the}} <b>short</b> <b>skirt</b> {{convenient}} during her travels and defended it {{against those who}} {{said it was a}} distraction that hurt the women’s rights cause. Nevertheless, she disliked the instant attention it drew whenever she arrived in a new place. In the fall of 1854, she added a dress a few inches longer, for occasional use. In 1855, she abandoned the dress altogether and was not involved in the formation of a National Dress Reform Association in February, 1856. Her resumption of long skirts drew the condemnation of such dress-reform leaders as Gerrit Smith and Lydia Sayer Hasbrouk, who accused her of sacrificing principle for the sake of pleasing a husband.|$|E
25|$|From 1987 {{until the}} early 1990s, the <b>short</b> <b>skirt</b> was the only length {{supported}} by fashion designers. Although skirts of any length were acceptable to wear in the years before, all attention {{was given to the}} <b>short</b> <b>skirt,</b> especially among teenage girls and young women. Shoulder pads became increasingly smaller. Accessories popular in Britain, France and America included bright-colored shoes with thin heels, narrow multicolored belts, berets, lacy gloves, beaded necklaces, and plastic bracelets.|$|E
5000|$|Extremely <b>short</b> <b>skirts,</b> some as much {{as eight}} inches above the knee, were {{observed}} in Britain {{in the summer of}} 1962. The young women who wore these <b>short</b> <b>skirts</b> were called [...] "Ya-Ya girls," [...] a term derived from [...] "yeah, yeah" [...] which was a popular catcall at the time. One retailer noted that the fashion for layered net crinoline petticoats raised the hems of <b>short</b> <b>skirts</b> even higher. The designer Mary Quant was quoted as saying that [...] "short short skirts" [...] indicated youthfulness which was seen as desirable, fashion-wise.|$|R

25|$|In Greek {{classical}} art she {{is usually}} {{portrayed as a}} maiden huntress, young, tall and slim, clothed in a girl's <b>short</b> <b>skirt,</b> with hunting boots, a quiver, a bow and arrows. Often, she {{is shown in the}} shooting pose, and is accompanied by a hunting dog or stag. When portrayed as a moon goddess, Artemis wore a long robe and sometimes a veil covered her head. Her darker side is revealed in some vase paintings, where she is shown as the death-bringing goddess whose arrows fell young maidens and women, such as the daughters of Niobe.|$|E

According to Leonard Maltin: [...] "In early 1933 a Georgia theater owner wrote to Film Daily: 'The worst kicks we have are on smut in cartoons. They are primarily a kid draw, and parents frequently object to the filth that is put in them, incidentally without helping the comedy. The dirtiest ones are invariably the least funny.'" [...] Betty Boop thus underwent {{some of the most}} dramatic changes after the Code was imposed: [...] "gone was the garter, the <b>short</b> <b>skirt,</b> the décolletage".|$|E

She wore a silver and black <b>short</b> <b>skirt</b> like a tutu and shaped like peplum on both sides.

She had a triangular piece attached on the dress on her right breast, and completed her look with high heeled ultra spike shoes. Gaga's hair was made an austere blond bob, and she accessorized with black sunglasses. Her dancers surrounded the stage, holding plates encrusted with crystals, which completely hid them. As the performance of the opening number [...] "Paparazzi" [...] ended, the plates opened up and Gaga started singing the song [...] "Starstruck" [...] while standing on the platform. Pre-recorded music and mixing were provided in the background by DJ Space Cowboy. Gaga also brought out the disco stick for the performance of [...] "LoveGame".

500|$|Jared is {{an entirely}} fictional character, though he has been {{interpreted}} {{as a metaphor for}} everyone who witnessed Leigh being publicly assaulted yet did nothing. In the film, Tracy does not ask her parents for permission to attend the party as she knows this would be denied, whereas Leigh obtained permission from her parents, who were told the party would be supervised. Tracy wears a <b>short</b> <b>skirt,</b> tight-fitting top, and high-heels to the party, while Leigh wore ordinary shorts, a jumper, and sand-shoes. Tracy's body is found that night by a girl; Leigh's body was found the next day by a boy.

500|$|When Stone resumed lecturing in {{the fall}} of 1851, she wore a new style of dress that she had adopted during her winter convalescence, [...] {{consisting}} of a loose, short jacket and a pair of baggy trousers under a skirt that fell a few inches below the knees. The dress was a product of the health-reform movement and intended to replace the fashionable French dress of a tight bodice over a whalebone-fitted corset, and a skirt that dragged several inches on the floor, worn over several layers of starched petticoats with straw or horsehair sewn into the hems. Ever since the fall of 1849, when the [...] Water-Cure Journal urged women to invent a style of dress that would allow them the free use of their legs, women across the country had been wearing some form of pants and <b>short</b> <b>skirt,</b> generally called the “Turkish costume” or the “American dress.” Most wore it as a walking or gardening dress, but a letter writer to the National Woman’s Rights Convention urged women to adopt it as common attire.|$|E
500|$|Roddenberry {{explained}} to Whitney {{that he wanted}} Rand to be Captain Kirk's confidante but never wanted them to express their affection for one another, instead {{he wanted it to}} be played as an ongoing undercurrent. In the early publicity photos, Whitney was dressed in the same manner that the women had been in the two pilots – a loose gold colored tunic and black trousers. She complained to Roddenberry about them hiding her [...] "dancer's legs", so he had William Ware Theiss design a <b>short</b> <b>skirt</b> and tunic for her to wear, a uniform which was adopted by the other female characters on the series. She said the outfit was [...] "sensational" [...] and that [...] "it stopped traffic". Despite the outfit being designed specifically for Whitney, Theiss was concerned and would tell her to lose weight. She was subsequently prescribed amphetamines by her doctor, for the purpose of weight loss. Whitney stated that this was the start of her addiction to them, and in order to come down off them at night, she began drinking in the evening to take away the [...] "edginess".|$|E

500|$|Lucy Mangan of The Guardian responded positively, noting it [...] "manages brilliantly to nod to {{just about}} every Whovian in-joke, {{demographic}} and fetish within the span of two tiny installments". The A.V. Club reviewer Christopher Bahn opined that the two Amys in [...] "Space" [...] and [...] "Time" [...] were [...] "a lot more fun to watch" [...] than the two in the sixth series episode [...] "The Girl Who Waited". Tor.com's Teresa Jusino, who had positive towards Amy's character in the past, was disappointed that {{the ending of the}} miniepisodes relied on [...] "too-easy, dated, sexist humor". She cited the fact that Rory dropping the coupling was blamed on Amy's <b>short</b> <b>skirt</b> rather than Rory himself, which implied that she had a [...] "responsibility to cover up, because 'men will be men'". In Who is the Doctor, a guide to the revived series, Robert Smith wrote that the episode was [...] "cute, plotted to perfection and ends precisely when it should, before it has the chance to outstay its welcome". He said that the episodes used Amy well, as it did not make her unlikable. On the other hand, his coauthor Graeme Burk said that the story was [...] "derivative and lazy" [...] and a [...] "missed opportunity". He likened the plot to that of Red Dwarf [...] "Future Echoes", and felt that Moffat could have written something better and funnier. Like Jusino, he thought that the [...] "blokey humor" [...] was [...] "misplaced", denying a broad audience appeal and leading to the sexist last line: [...] "Pond, put some trousers on!". Despite this, both Jusino and Burk enjoyed the scene where Amy flirts with herself.|$|E
