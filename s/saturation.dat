40|$|The {{invasion}} percolation {{model is}} used to investigate the effect of correlated heterogeneity on capillary dominated displacements in porous media. The breakthrough and residual <b>saturations</b> are shown to be strongly influenced by the correlations. Correlated heterogeneity leads to lower residual <b>saturations</b> than those observed in random systems and the scatter commonly observed in laboratory core measurements of the residual <b>saturations</b> {{can be attributed to}} the presence of such heterogeneity at the pore scale. Invasion percolation computations on elongated lattices, those with a geometry of L^(d− 1) × nL where n denotes the aspect ratio, show that residual <b>saturations</b> for systems with correlated heterogeneity exhibit a strong dependence on aspect ratio. This effect is not considered by experimentalists who advocate the use of long (high aspect ratio) cores in order to overcome ‘end-effects’ in experiments on shorter cores. A new scaling law is proposed for the residual <b>saturations</b> in elongated systems with correlated heterogeneity, and is confirmed by numerical simulations. ...|$|R
5|$|Decompression from a <b>saturation</b> dive {{is a slow}} process. The rate of {{decompression}} typically ranges between 3 and 6fsw (0.9 and 1.8msw) per hour.|$|E
5|$|Normal diving {{decompression}} procedures {{range from}} continuous ascent for no-stop dives, where the necessary decompression occurs during the ascent, which is {{kept to a}} controlled rate for this purpose, through staged decompression in open water or in a bell, to decompression from <b>saturation,</b> which generally occurs in a decompression chamber {{that is part of}} a <b>saturation</b> system. Decompression may be accelerated by the use of breathing gases that provide an increased concentration differential of the inert gas components of the breathing mixture by maximizing the acceptable oxygen content.|$|E
5|$|Once all {{the tissue}} {{compartments}} have reached <b>saturation</b> {{for a given}} pressure and breathing mixture, continued exposure will not increase the gas loading of the tissues. From this point onwards the required decompression remains the same. If divers work and live at pressure for a long period, and are decompressed {{only at the end}} of the period, the risks associated with decompression are limited to this single exposure. This principle has led to the practice of <b>saturation</b> diving, and as there is only one decompression, and it is done in the relative safety and comfort of a <b>saturation</b> habitat, the decompression is done on a very conservative profile, minimising the risk of bubble formation, growth and the consequent injury to tissues. A consequence of these procedures is that <b>saturation</b> divers are more likely to suffer decompression sickness symptoms in the slowest tissues, whereas bounce divers are more likely to develop bubbles in faster tissues.|$|E
40|$|In 2006, the Indian National Gas Hydrate Program Expedition 01, or NGHP- 01, {{discovered}} {{gas hydrate}} as fill in near-vertical fractures in unconsolidated sediments at several drilling {{sites on the}} Indian continental margins. These gas hydrate-filled fractures were identified on logging-while-drilling resistivity images. The gas hydrate-filled fracture intervals coincide with high measured resistivity at the NGHP- 01 sites. High measured resistivity translates into high hydrate <b>saturations</b> via Archie's equation; however, these high <b>saturations</b> contradict lower gas hydrate <b>saturations</b> determined from pressure core and chlorinity measurements. Also, in intervals with near-vertical gas hydrate-filled fractures, there is considerable separation between phase shift and attenuation resistivity logs, with 2 -MHz resistivity measurements being significantly higher than 400 -kHz resistivity measurements. We modeled {{the sensitivity of the}} propagation resistivity measurements in the gas hydrate-filled fracture intervals at NGHP- 01 Sites 5 and 10. Near-vertical hydrate-filled fractures can cause the abnormally high resistivity measurements in vertical holes due to electrical anisotropy. The model suggests the gas hydrate <b>saturations</b> in situ are usually significantly lower than those calculated from Archie's equation. In addition, these modeled gas hydrate <b>saturations</b> generally agree with the lower gas hydrate <b>saturations</b> obtained from pressure core and chlorinity measurements at NGHP- 01 Sites 5 and 10...|$|R

Goats compressed to 6 bar and rapidly decompressed to 2.6 bar (pressure ratio 2.3 to 1) also showed no signs of DCS. Haldane and his co-workers concluded that a decompression from <b>saturation</b> with a pressure ratio of 2 to 1 was unlikely to produce symptoms.|$|E

30|$|The results {{revealed}} that the initial water <b>saturations</b> evaluated from core flooding were higher compared to the centrifuge method. While centrifuge experiments were carried out at atmospheric pressure, core flooding was carried out at high net effective stress. At higher stresses, pore volumes of core samples reduced (compare Tables  1, 5) which would ideally reduce pore radius. The wetting phase would readjust to occupy these reduced pores. In this investigation, flow rate was increased during the drainage process of core flooding experiments until no further water was produced. Thus, initial water <b>saturations</b> evaluated from core flooding represented true initial water <b>saturations</b> of core samples.|$|R
30|$|Different {{results were}} {{obtained}} from different relative permeability models for the same reservoir {{with some of the}} models giving better predictions at lower <b>saturations</b> but performs poorly at higher <b>saturations</b> and vice versa; hence, lots of uncertainty. Therefore, it is needful for practitioners to know the limitations of any correlation used for the prediction of wetting and non-wetting phase relative permeability.|$|R
5|$|Divers {{with long}} {{decompression}} obligations may be decompressed inside gas filled hyperbaric chambers {{in the water}} or at the surface, and in the extreme case, <b>saturation</b> divers are only decompressed {{at the end of}} a tour of duty that may be several weeks long.|$|E
5|$|Enzyme inhibitors {{can also}} irreversibly {{inactivate}} enzymes, usually by covalently modifying active site residues.

To find {{the maximum speed}} of an enzymatic reaction, the substrate concentration is increased until a constant rate of product formation is seen. This {{is shown in the}} <b>saturation</b> curve on the right. <b>Saturation</b> happens because, as substrate concentration increases, {{more and more of the}} free enzyme is converted into the substrate-bound ES complex. At the maximum reaction rate (Vmax) of the enzyme, all the enzyme active sites are bound to substrate, and the amount of ES complex is the same as the total amount of enzyme.|$|E
