To qualify for the competitive Civil Service position as a Fishery Biologist, he needed at least a baccalaureate degree in the biological sciences. At age 55, [...] "Dr." [...] Springer went back to school to get a B. A. degree at the George Washington University. From 1963 to 1967 Springer served as Fishery Biologist (research), U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service at Stanford where he ran a <b>shark</b> <b>tagging</b> <b>program.</b> From 1968 to 1971 he served as a Fishery Biologist (Research), National Marine Fisheries, at the National Museum in Washington, D.C. This placed him in the enviable position, as a taxonomist, of being able to examine some of the very specimens he had personally collected and 'pickled' in earlier years first as a shark fisherman and later as a researcher. [...] Stewart Springer retired from Federal Service in 1971 but he continued his research while employed by the Mote Marine Laboratory in Sarasota, Florida. In April 1979, he completed his last major research project with publication by the National Marine Fisheries Service of [...] "A Revision of the Catsharks, Family Scyliorhinidae." [...] This paper covered a family of sharks that included (in 1979) 86 species and 17 genera. Six new species and one new sub-species were described in this publication (A Revision of the Catsharks, Family Scyliorhinidae, Stewart Springer, NOAA Technical Report NMFS Circular 422, United States Department of Commerce, April 1979, 152 pages.) ...|$|E

The CSTP was initiated in 1962 at the Sandy Hook Laboratory in New Jersey under the Department of Interior's U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS).

40|$|Identification {{problems}} are common for many sharks {{due to a}} general lack of meristic characteristics that are typically useful for separating species. Other than number of vertebrae and number and shape of teeth, identifications are frequently based on external features that are often shared among species. Identification problems in the field are most prevalent when live specimens are captured and releasing them with a minimum of stress is a priority (e. g., <b>shark</b> <b>tagging</b> <b>programs).</b> Identifications must be accurate and conducted quickly but this can be challenging, especially if specimens are very active or too large to be landed without physical damage. This field guide was designed primarily for use during field studies and presents a simplified method for identifying the 21 species of western North Atlantic Ocean sharks belonging to the family Carcharhinidae (carcharhinids). To assist with identifications a dichotomous key to Carcharhinidae was developed, and for the more problematic Carcharhinus species (12 species), separation sheets based on important distinguishing features were constructed. Descriptive text and illustrations provided in the species accounts were developed from field observations, photographs, and published references. (PDF file contains 36 pages. ...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{attempts}} {{to conduct a}} stock assessment for the blue shark (Prionace glauca) in the North Atlantic have been handicapped {{by the lack of}} reliable catch and effort data. The use of tag-recapture data is among ICCAT’s recommendations for future assessment work. This paper proposes a statistical framework for estimating blue shark movement and fishing mortality rates from the tag-recapture data of the National Marine Fisheries Service Cooperative <b>Shark</b> <b>Tagging</b> <b>Program</b> (NMFS-CSTP). The model considers four geographical regions. Blue sharks can stay in the region in which they were tagged and they can move among regions. The parameters of the model are the intra- and inter-region movement probabilities and the catchability coefficients that relate the probabilities of capture and the ICCAT longline fishing effort data. Bayesian estimation methods are used to estimate and quantify the uncertainty associated with the values for these parameters. The dataset of the NMFS-CSTP shows potential for use in a blue shark stock assessment and should be investigated further. Areas of interest for future research are identified. RÉSUM...|$|E
40|$|Proportional {{survival}} (S) is {{a crucial}} life-history parameter in population dynamics, natural selection, and management of harvested stocks; variations in survival due to age, sex, or geographic region may have large effects {{on the success of}} managing fish stocks. The blacktip shark, Carcharhinus limbatus, is the most abundantly harvested shark species in American fisheries. Direct estimates of survival are preferred, but all current survival estimates for this species are either focused on young-of-the-year (YOY) or based on indirect methods. The objectives of this study were to determine whether age, sex, or geographic grouping affects survival and to generate direct survival estimates based on tag-recovery data. As a byproduct of this analysis, distribution maps and descriptive data summarizing captures were included. The U. S. National Marine Fisheries Service has been collecting tag-recovery data since 1962 through the Cooperative <b>Shark</b> <b>Tagging</b> <b>Program</b> (CSTP). Models were generated from this database with program MARK, ranked in order of parsimony according to Akaike 2 ̆ 7 s Information Criterion, and tested for significance of effects with likelihood ratio tests. No movement has been observed to date between the west Gulf of Mexico, east Gulf of Mexico, and U. S. Atlantic, but 2 sharks tagged in the U. S. Virgin Islands were recaptured off Florida and Georgia (displacement= 1049 and 1183 n. mi., respectively). Survival did not differ significantly for males vs. females (P= 0. 761), east vs. west Gulf of Mexico (P= 0. 654), or U. S. Atlantic vs. Gulf of Mexico (P= 0. 243). However, significant differences were found for survival of YOY (0. 580) and post-YOY (0. 725) within the Gulf of Mexico (P= 0. 0003). These results demonstrate that survival can be modeled effectively for species in the CSTP with relatively small sample sizes. Future analyses may benefit from a length-based model, due to the difficulty in assigning life stages based on size. ...|$|E

50|$|Some {{well known}} <b>tagging</b> <b>programs</b> in the United States are the South Carolina Marine Game Fish <b>Tagging</b> <b>Program</b> and the Virginia Game Fish <b>Tagging</b> <b>Program.</b> The South Carolina Marine Game Fish <b>Tagging</b> <b>Program</b> began in 1974 {{and it is}} now the largest public <b>tagging</b> <b>program</b> in the Southeastern United States. Anglers are trained and then receive a tag kit with tags, applicator, and instructions. When they tag a fish, anglers use a reply {{postcard}} they receive in advance to send the information on the tag number, tag date, location, species, and size. This program issues anglers who tag and release 30 or more eligible species within a year a conservation award. When an angler recaptures a tagged fish, he then should report the recapture. If possible the tag number and the mailing address should be reported along with the location and date of the recapture as well with the measurement of the fish. The objective is to provide biologists with the necessary information to determine growth rate through an accurate measurement. The Virginia Game Fish <b>Tagging</b> <b>Program</b> started operations in 1995 and keeps records on recaptured fish since then. This is an annual program that starts in January and it is limited to 160 anglers. Anglers receive training workshops in February and March.|$|R
