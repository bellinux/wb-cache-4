25|$|The boat’s navigational and {{communications}} {{systems have been}} damaged by saltwater intrusion. The man tries to repair the marine radio and connects {{it to one of}} the boat's batteries but is unsuccessful. When he climbs the mast to repair an antenna lead, he sees an oncoming tropical storm. When the storm arrives, he runs before the wind. He intends to bring the boat into a hove-to position, but when crawling to the bow to hoist the <b>storm</b> <b>jib,</b> he is thrown overboard and regains the deck after a long struggle. The boat capsizes, turtles after a further 180-degree roll and is dis-masted, and most of the equipment is destroyed. With the boat badly holed and sinking, the man abandons ship in an inflatable life raft, salvaging whatever he can to survive.|$|E
6000|$|... "Andrews, {{do you and}} {{two others}} get down into the sail locker and bring up the <b>storm</b> <b>jib,</b> the small foresail, trysail, and storm mizzen. If it is a tornado, we shan't want to show much sail to it." ...|$|E
60|$|When {{this was}} done, the topmast was also sent down and lashed by the sail. The barrels, which were now all empty, were lowered {{down into the}} saloon, while the trysail was {{fastened}} to the hoops ready for hoisting, and all the reefs tied up. A triangular mizzen was then hoisted, and a <b>storm</b> <b>jib.</b>|$|E
50|$|Boats may be sailed using a jib alone, more {{commonly}} jib(s) make a minor direct contribution to propulsion, {{compared to a}} main sail. Generally, a jib's most crucial function is as an airfoil, increasing performance and overall stability by reducing turbulence on the main sail's leeward side. On boats with only one jib, {{it is common for}} the clew of the jib to be further aft than the mast, meaning the jib and mainsail overlap. An overlapping jib is called a genoa jib or simply a genoa (see illustration). These are efficiently used when reaching more broadly than a close reach. Alternatively, a boat may carry smaller jibs, to compensate aerodynamics when the main sail is reefed; these more rugged sails are called <b>storm</b> <b>jibs</b> or spitfires.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know about}} your storms here, Captain; {{but if it were}} in the Levant I should get every stitch of canvas off her {{excepting}} closely- reefed topsails, a <b>storm</b> <b>jib,</b> and fore stay-sail. The first burst over, one can always shake out more canvas. However, you know these seas, and I do not." ...|$|E
60|$|This {{was soon}} done and, under bare poles, the <b>storm</b> <b>jib</b> {{now the only}} sail upon her, the Paramatta tore through the water. There was little motion, for the sea had not begun to get up, seeming to be pressed flat {{by the force of}} the wind. The captain now left the helm. Two or three of the male {{passengers}} were standing {{at the top of the}} companion, peering out.|$|E
60|$|Sail after sail {{was taken}} in, until only a <b>storm</b> <b>jib,</b> a small fore stay-sail, and a close-reefed main top-sail were left standing. The bank of cloud {{to the south}} had risen {{considerably}} and, when darkness closed in, the upper edge was lit up by the almost incessant flicker of lightning. The upper spars were sent down on deck and then, there being nothing more to be done, the crew, who had all donned rough-weather clothes, awaited the outburst.|$|E
60|$|Never was the Paramatta {{stripped}} {{more rapidly}} of her sails, {{for every man}} was conscious of {{the urgency of the}} work. As soon as the sails were furled, the yards were sent down. The upper spars followed them and, in little over half an hour from the time the men began to ascend the shrouds, the Paramatta was metamorphosed. Her tall tapering masts and lofty spread of sail were gone. Every spar above the topmasts had been sent down to the deck; and she lay under close-reefed topsails, a stay sail, and a <b>storm</b> <b>jib.</b> The captain gave a sigh of relief, as the men began to descend the rigging.|$|E
50|$|The {{first two}} were rarely used except by clipper ships in light winds and were usually set flying. A <b>storm</b> <b>jib</b> {{was a small}} jib of heavy canvas set to a stay to help to control the ship in bad weather.|$|E
50|$|Macallum {{entered the}} Royal Academy schools the same year, 1864. He had studios {{successively}} at Hampstead (Haverstock Hill), in Piccadilly, and at Beer, Devon. He {{painted in the}} western Scottish Highlands from a small yacht, the south coast of Devon, Heligoland, the Netherlands, and southern Italy.His contributions to the major London exhibitions extended over twenty years, from 1876, when Hoisting the <b>Storm</b> <b>Jib</b> was at the Royal Academy, until 1896, when his last picture, the Crofter's Team, (which went to the Millbank Gallery) hung on the same walls. Macallum died very suddenly of heart disease at Beer on 23 June 1896.|$|E

5000|$|Captain Thomas M. Johnson, {{wrote to}} Forbes in 1843:" [...] The Zephyr {{is now in}} the Taypa with loss of main boom, fore-gaff, and jib. I was caught off the Grand Ladrone in a gale at north-east. She did well till the jib was lost, and we beat from the Ladrone to here under double-reefed sails and <b>storm</b> <b>jib</b> quicker than {{anything}} in China could have done it. None of the vessels I have met could beat her. On the wind I do believe there is not anything that can beat her. When in ballast she is as dry as any of them. In smooth water, on the wind, her equal is not to be found in China or elsewhere, in my opinion. Properly ballasted she is the easiest vessel I was ever aboard of.|$|E
