The objectives {{of the study were}} to: identify the <b>sales</b> <b>promotional</b> <b>activities</b> being used by BIMCO, to determine the impact of <b>sales</b> <b>promotional</b> <b>activities</b> on sales turnover, to determine the impact of <b>sales</b> <b>promotional</b> <b>activities</b> on market share, to determine the impact of <b>sales</b> <b>promotional</b> <b>activities</b> on customer retention, to establish weaknesses of the current promotional activities and finally to identify other factors other than <b>sales</b> <b>promotional</b> <b>activities</b> that can improve on the companyâ€™sâ€™ performance. The literature review was used to gain a more in-depth knowledge of the researched problem. The descriptive research design was used to review literature from different authors and websites in relation to the <b>sales</b> <b>promotional</b> <b>activities</b> to improve the organisation. The literature review chapter will focus on the following subtopics: the definition of <b>sales</b> <b>promotional</b> <b>activities,</b> the objectives of sales promotional strategies, growth of sales promotion, some types of promotional activities, impact of sales promotion on company performance, other factors that influence changes in company performance and the summary of the chapter. The representative population was the employees and customers (credit and cash) in Zimbabwe. The researcher used descriptive and exploratory research. The data used was collected through questionnaires and secondary data sources and a sample of 30 individuals who included both employees and customers at BIMCO. 20 questionnaires were distributed and 15 were returned, giving a response rate of 75 % and 10 interviews were carried out and 8 were successful giving a response rate of 80 %. Questionnaires and interviews were used as data collection instruments. Microsoft Excel was used in data presentation. In the analysis and interpretation, frequencies, percentages was used and closed and open ended questions were used to gather data from the respondents. Presentation then followed through the use of tables, in an attempt to make the data usable by decision makers. Data collected from the respondents was presented in the form of tables, bar graphs and pie charts. The data was also analysed and interpreted in a descriptive way. In view of the findings of the research study, it is evidenced that price discounts, exhibitions and free samples are the most common <b>sales</b> <b>promotional</b> <b>activities</b> being used by BIMCO. The findings revealed that the companyâ€™s current <b>sales</b> <b>promotional</b> <b>activities</b> are ineffective therefore there is need to improve the promotional activities to cub the problem accruing for not improving the company performance. The findings also revealed that, other factors to consider that might help in improving the companiesâ€™ performance include the price, quality, brand image, flexibility of payment terms, advertisements as well as skills training. On the conclusions the <b>sales</b> <b>promotional</b> <b>activities</b> currently in use at BIMCO may not be effective in improving company performance as they have a relatively low influence to the variations in sales performance. It was observed in the study that BIMCO is not concurrently active in sales promotion and yet maintain higher sales volume and profitability. The researcher recognized that sales promotion has a great impact on customers and performance of the organisation as well. Irrespective of the sales increasing it is short lived because there is excitement among customers on price discounts. Recommendations are also suggested for the improvement of the current problem. A number of strategies were recommended which include adding more sales promotion activities, knowing when it is time to use promotional activities and on-the-job training for employees to enhance their experience. Since it has immerged that sales promotion alone can not increase the companyâ€™s market share, it is recommended that the company should produce quality products for their customers. For BIMCO to avoid customers from switching brands unnecessarily, the organisation should embrace more relationship strategies...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{itself with}} the devising of a model which organisations can consult when considering hosting any <b>sales</b> <b>promotional</b> <b>activities.</b> The success regarding profits derived from these sales promotions activities vary. These anomalies prompted a further investigation into {{the need for a}} single promotional model which could be utilized in varied business environments to optimize profits derived from sales promotions. The uniqueness of the South African environment was also taken into account when considering the various criteria {{in the development of the}} model. Sensitivity with regards to the types of barriers peculiar to South Africa is vital. The following excerpt from East Cape Weekend (An Eastern Cape newspaper) reinforces the belief that there are factors to which global environments are not exposed, and thus, the model should and will be designed to cater for these South African peculiarities by virtue of the fact that it will be based on the critical success factors of successful South African retail organisations. Resistance to technological progress due to the threat of possible job redundancy is one of the South African peculiarities that is referred to in the East Cape Weekend 09 / 06 / 2001 Michelle Pugh-Parry, “Controversial telephone technology will make paying bills safer”. Besides safety and convenience, the system can alleviate the R 600 m PE municipal areas debt, yet the union has outwardly rejected the plan and stormed the municipal buildings, protesting that it may cause job loss. It is precisely this type of peculiar barrier to progress that the author intends to accommodate for in the devising of his model. South African organizations will be considered when performing the empirical and primary studies in order to formulate a model that has been adapted to and caters for local needs due to its fundamental aspects being based on the South African circumstance. The information in this study contains the analysis of promotions in a broad context in terms of the following six facets of retail management, namely, operations, human resources, marketing, organizational behaviour, economics and strategies. The results of an analysis of promotional activities used by organizations in the Port Elizabeth municipal area was gained via the application of a questionnaire. An empirical study was performed and provided information that could be used in the development of a promotional model.

It combines Principal Component Analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the problem and automatically identifies the demand dynamics. For items with limited history, the proposed model is capable of providing promotional forecasts by selectively pooling information across established products.

The potential problems that arise from the application of the provisions pertaining to <b>promotional</b> <b>activities</b> in the CPA are the threefold: namely, the possible redundancy of these pre-existing regulatory bodies; the over-regulation of <b>promotional</b> <b>activities</b> in South Africa; and the interplay between the provisions of the CPA, as well as the legislation and Codes pertaining to <b>promotional</b> <b>activities,</b> that have not been repealed by the Act.

Finally, we test this baseline against the industry standard ones on the two measures of performance.
