5|$|In early 1859, {{abolitionist}} Republican U.S. Senator William H. Seward sold Tubman a <b>small</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> land on {{the outskirts}} of Auburn, New York, for US$1,200. The city was a hotbed of antislavery activism, and Tubman seized the opportunity to deliver her parents from the harsh Canadian winters. Returning to the U.S. meant that escaped slaves were at risk of being returned to the south under the Fugitive Slave Law, and Tubman's siblings expressed reservations. Catherine Clinton suggests that anger over the 1857 Dred Scott decision may have prompted Tubman to return to the U.S. Her land in Auburn became a haven for Tubman's family and friends. For years, she took in relatives and boarders, offering a safe place for black Americans seeking a better life in the north.|$|E
5|$|Optimus {{is given}} the task of {{removing}} the Dark Energon from Cybertron's core by the council. Optimus and his old friend Ironhide, along with rookie Autobot soldier Warpath first attempt to rescue Omega Supreme from the Decepticons, who is being tortured by Dark Energon. They call in Ratchet who heals Omega Supreme. The Autobots free Omega Supreme and gain access to Cybertron's core. Struggling against a mysterious corrupted worm and countless Decepticons, Optimus then speaks with Cybertron's core, which informs him {{that it has been}} heavily damaged by the Dark Energon. It states that it can repair itself by shutting down, but the process will take millions of years during which Cybertron will become cold, barren, and lifeless. The core then tells Optimus that if he carries a <b>small</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> the core with him, the core can still survive during the repairs. Optimus accepts the burden and the core relinquishes the Autobot Matrix of Leadership.|$|E
5|$|No new {{gameplay}} {{content was}} added to Type-0 HD. The team instead focused on upgrading the graphics, adjusting existing gameplay for home consoles, and including a lower difficulty level. The latter was due to complaints from players that the original game was too difficult. While carrying over the original's multiplayer functions was considered, it would have lengthened the estimated development time by another year. Since Tabata's priority was to bring the game to fans worldwide, the multiplayer and associated elements were either removed or incorporated into the single-player campaign. Tabata also decided against creation of a demo or an international version for this reason. As {{a substitute for the}} multiplayer, the team strengthened and improved the original single-player Academy Assistance function. As with the original, the team used the names of developers from both the core team and other Square Enix departments for the NPCs. While the main story remained unchanged, a secret cutscene teasing future Type games was commissioned. Created by Square Enix's CGI movie subsidiary Visual Works, it was based on some of Tabata's early ideas for Type-0. A <b>small</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> the cutscene was shown privately to attendees of Square Enix's 25th anniversary commemoration event for the Final Fantasy series. Hiroki Chiba, writer for Type-0, returned to write the scene. In the cutscene, a fatally-wounded samurai warrior resembling main protagonist Ace is saved from death by a fire spirit.|$|E

5|$|Port Republic Road was widened by {{the city}} of Harrisonburg to four lanes from US 11 to I-81 in 1994, from I-81 to Neff Avenue in 2004, and from Neff Avenue to the city limit by 2006. Port Republic Road in the city of Harrisonburg and SR 659 in Rockingham County from the city to US 340 were {{transferred}} from the secondary system to the primary highway system as SR 253 by a resolution passed by the Commonwealth Transportation Board on March 17, 2005. The transfer {{was supported in part by}} the planned relocation of Rockingham Memorial Hospital from north of the James Madison University campus in the city to southeast of the city in Rockingham County, a process that began in 2004 and was completed when the hospital opened in 2010. SR 253 was expanded to a four-lane divided highway from SR 704 (Boyers Road) north to the city limit, thus connecting with the four-lane highway built {{by the city}}, starting in early 2010. The expansion project was completed in early 2012, although the new divided highway opened to traffic in June 2011. The project included construction of a <b>small</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> SR 280a highway planned as the Southeast Connector that is intended to connect SR 42, US 11, SR 253, and US 33 south of Harrisonburgat its intersection with SR 253 next to Rockingham Memorial Hospital.|$|E

50|$|Marcasite jewelry is jewelry {{made from}} pyrite (fool's gold), not, {{as the name}} suggests, from marcasite. Pyrite is similar to marcasite, but more stable and less brittle. It is {{frequently}} made by setting <b>small</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> pyrite into silver. Cheaper costume jewelry is made by glueing <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> pyrite rather than setting. A similar-looking type of jewelry {{can be made from}} <b>small</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> cut steel.|$|R
25|$|The Tripuris live on {{the slopes}} of hills in a group of five to fifty families. Their houses in these areas are built of bamboo or ua as it is called in Kokborok and raised five to six feet height to save {{themselves}} from the dangers of the wild animals. Nowadays a considerable section of this community are living in the plains and erecting houses like the plains people, adopting their methods of cultivation, and following them in other aspects of life, such as dress, manners, and cosmetics. Tripuri women wear a scarp, called rignai, which reaches down just below the knee. They weave in their loin-loom a <b>small</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> cloth, which they call risa, and they use this <b>small</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> cloth as their breast garment.|$|E

Later, their boat would capsize, and many of their papers were destroyed.|$|E

Responsibility was then transferred to Network Rail which anticipated expenditure of £5m in 2006/07 and £8m in 2007/08.|$|E

25|$|In the meantime, Japan {{began to}} expand into {{northeast}} China. One of the regions the Japanese targeted was Jiandao (known in Korean as Gando). Rather than being a <b>small</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> marsh land, the Japanese claimed that Jiandao included territory of four counties (Yanji, Wangqing, Helong and Hunchun) of Jilin province. The Japanese further claimed ethnic Koreans living in this region should be placed {{under the influence of}} Imperial Japan.|$|E
25|$|Each side of {{the pelvis}} is formed as cartilage, which ossifies as three main bones which stay {{separate}} through childhood: ilium, ischium, pubis. At birth {{the whole of the}} hip joint (the acetabulum area and the top of the femur) is still made of cartilage (but there may be a <b>small</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> bone in the great trochanter of the femur); this makes it difficult to detect congenital hip dislocation by X-raying.|$|E
25|$|Peru {{obtained}} {{its first}} football-based {{field in the}} late 19th century, when the club Unión Cricket asked the Municipality of Lima for an appropriate piece of land where they could play football. The municipality gave them a <b>small</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> land in the Santa Beatriz neighborhood which belonged to a Shooting club. On July 18, 1897, the field was officially inaugurated and named Estadio Guadalupe. The Liga Peruana de Futbol (known as the FPF today) used {{it for the first}} tournaments in Lima.|$|E
