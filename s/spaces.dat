5|$|An {{important}} {{development of}} vector <b>spaces</b> {{is due to}} the construction of function <b>spaces</b> by Lebesgue. This was later formalized by Banach and Hilbert, around 1920. At that time, algebra and the new field of functional analysis began to interact, notably with key concepts such as <b>spaces</b> of p-integrable functions and Hilbert <b>spaces.</b> Vector <b>spaces,</b> including infinite-dimensional ones, then became a firmly established notion, and many mathematical branches started making use of this concept.|$|E
5|$|Any general {{property}} of Banach <b>spaces</b> {{continues to hold}} for Hilbert <b>spaces.</b> The open mapping theorem states that a continuous surjective linear transformation from one Banach space to another is an open mapping meaning that it sends open sets to open sets. A corollary is the bounded inverse theorem, that a continuous and bijective linear function from one Banach space to another is an isomorphism (that is, a continuous linear map whose inverse is also continuous). This theorem is considerably simpler to prove {{in the case of}} Hilbert <b>spaces</b> than in general Banach <b>spaces.</b> The open mapping theorem is equivalent to the closed graph theorem, which asserts that a function from one Banach space to another is continuous if and only if its graph is a closed set. In the case of Hilbert <b>spaces,</b> this is basic in the study of unbounded operators (see closed operator).|$|E
5|$|As a {{complete}} normed space, Hilbert <b>spaces</b> are by definition also Banach <b>spaces.</b> As such they are topological vector <b>spaces,</b> in which topological notions like the openness and closedness of subsets are well-defined. Of special importance {{is the notion}} of a closed linear subspace of a Hilbert space that, with the inner product induced by restriction, is also complete (being a closed set in {{a complete}} metric space) and therefore a Hilbert space in its own right.|$|E

5|$|Hilbert <b>spaces</b> arise {{naturally}} {{and frequently}} {{in mathematics and}} physics, typically as infinite-dimensional function <b>spaces.</b> The earliest Hilbert <b>spaces</b> were studied {{from this point of}} view in the first decade of the 20th century by David Hilbert, Erhard Schmidt, and Frigyes Riesz. They are indispensable tools in the theories of partial differential equations, quantum mechanics, Fourier analysis (which includes applications to signal processing and heat transfer)—and ergodic theory, which forms the mathematical underpinning of thermodynamics. John von Neumann coined the term Hilbert space for the abstract concept that underlies many of these diverse applications. The success of Hilbert space methods ushered in a very fruitful era for functional analysis. Apart from the classical Euclidean <b>spaces,</b> examples of Hilbert <b>spaces</b> include <b>spaces</b> of square-integrable functions, <b>spaces</b> of sequences, Sobolev <b>spaces</b> consisting of generalized functions, and Hardy <b>spaces</b> of holomorphic functions.|$|E
