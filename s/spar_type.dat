40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the health {{monitoring}} of a wind turbine drivetrain in a system perspective. A 5 -MW reference drivetrain installed on a <b>spar</b> <b>type</b> floating wind turbine is selected. Degradation and damage in the main bearing which carries the axial loads can cause severe damage inside the gearbox as it causes non-torque loads entering the gearbox. Therefore, monitoring of the main bearing is very important. In this paper, different fault cases of the main bearing are considered and responses are obtained by the multi-body simulation. Gearbox failure is then evaluated in two different perspectives: one from the main bearing itself by analysing vibration, and one through studying the remaining fatigue life of another bearing inside the gearbox. The results reveal that not only the local vibration of the main bearing housing is important, but also the consequence of this degradation on other components can be {{a key factor in}} the “system” failure. This is a step forward in monitoring the wind turbine drivetrains on a system level...|$|E

The platform used for this type of telemetry instrumentation was to be a buoy which could not only withstand the often harsh conditions off the northeastern coast of America (specifically, Cape Ann), but do so while exhibiting an exceptionally small response in heave and roll. A <b>spar</b> <b>type</b> buoy was designed and built at the MIT Sea Grant facility. Spars are a special type of buoy shape whose hydrostatic and hydrodynamic interactions with the sea are decoupled enough so that extreme sea conditions do not induce extreme buoy motions. Most oceanographic buoys are of the discus type, and move as the surface of the ocean does. This type of wave-following buoy would not sufficiently facilitate the requirements of the high-bandwidth wireless networking hardware, and therefore would not serve the current purpose. (cont.) The NEC buoy displaces approximately 140 kg of sea water and is roughly 11 feet long when fully assembled, not including its 5 foot antenna mast. The buoy employs a PC 104 stack to control an 802. 1 lb wireless card and antenna, an acoustic modem card and transducer, other peripheral instrumentation, a main battery, and a solar power system. by Meghan Hendry-Brogan.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{the short}} term extreme {{response}} of spar offshore 5 MW NREL benchmark wind turbine is predicted. The spar is installed in a water depth of 320 m. The coupled wind and wave analysis is performed by coupling aerodynamic software FAST (Jonkman and Bull Jr, 2005) and hydrodynamic software ANSYS-AQWA(2010). The global time domain responses of the <b>spar</b> <b>type</b> OWT is calculated for 600 s. The wave spectrum has significant wave height 6 m and peak spectral period 10 s and follows Pierson- Moskowitz spectrum. For safe operation, the structures should survive against different environmental conditions. The OWT can fail either in the operational regime or in the harsh environmental conditions. Therefore the dynamic simulation is carried out for two wind speeds, i. e., one in operational (hub height wind speed as 11. 5 m/s) regime and another in idling condition (30 m/s) using the above wave parameters. Monte Carlo method is used to simulate the OWT responses in irregular wave loading condition. After obtaining the time-domain nonlinear responses, the 3 -hr short term extreme responses are obtained which are useful for design of OWT. The 3 -hr extreme response is obtained using Global Maxima Method (GMM). In Global Maxima Method, one maximum is taken from each time series and the maxima are fitted to two Generalized Extreme Value distributions, viz., Gumbel and Weibull distribution. The results show that Weibull fit is on a conservative side than Gumbel fit. Since the calculation of extremes is dependent on time domain simulations, a comparative study is also done for 100 and 20 samples so as to understand the sensitivity of extreme values due to lower sample size...|$|E
40|$|Wind {{power is}} a large natural source for {{renewable}} energy, and many countries have shown interest in establishing floating offshore wind parks. There are many advantages with floating offshore wind turbines, but also many challenges connected to them. This report focuses on establishing a model for wave-wind induced loading on a <b>Spar</b> <b>type</b> floating wind turbine named OC 3 -Hywind. The OC 3 -Hywind is {{a modified version of}} an original design developed by Statoil. Two fellow MSc students have developed models for a tension leg platform (TLP) and a semi-submersible, and a comparison between the three concepts have been done. The model has been constructed by the use of the well known software tools HydroD and DeepC. In addition, a DLL extension, TDHMILL 3 d, was used to obtain thrust force. HydroD was used in calculations of the hydrodynamic coefficients of the floater. DeepC was used to run coupled floater and mooring analysis in time domain. Important parameters like hydrodynamic coefficients and natural frequencies compare well to data from the literature. Simulations showed that the Spar is mostly influenced by wind loads in the operational conditions. At rated wind speed of 11. 4 m/s the pitch motions of the Spar was showed to be large. To reduce these motions a simple filter was used to extend the turbine control system. In situations where wind and waves have different directions, the Spar experiences large yaw motions. Several factors that may contribute to these motions have studied. To achieve good accuracy in statistical parameters, 10 or more simulations with different seeds were needed. The original depth of 320 m was changed to 160 m. Only minor changes to the mooring system were needed to obtain similar performance as the base case. In the comparison part typical trends of the different floaters was studied. Based on these trends, positive and negative response characteristics were discovered. The semi-submersible had the largest pitch and surge motions, while the TLP had the largest accelerations below rated. This may result in difficulties in maintenance operations. Only the Spar showed sign of excessive yaw motions. The semi-submersible had the lowest nacelle accelerations and STD for all load cases. In addition, the semi-submersible is the most versatile when it comes to water depth. </p...|$|E
40|$|PhD thesis in Offshore technologyThis study {{investigates the}} {{unsteady}} aerodynamics of attached flow on a two-dimensional airfoil. The unsteady aerodynamics introduces aerodynamic damping of the {{offshore wind turbine}} structure and is thus important for the turbine structural integrity. This includes {{an impact on the}} fatigue damage of the structure and, consequently, an effect on the total cost of energy. Unsteady aerodynamics can be studied using a variety of methods. In this thesis, a panel vortex method was developed to estimate the aerodynamic forces. This method is based on potential theory, which can’t account for the viscosity in the fluid. Consequently, dynamic stall, which is an important unsteady aerodynamic effect, can not be modeled, and we are limited to attached flow conditions. Despite this limitation, the vortex method is in some situation the preferred option when investigating unsteady aerodynamics. The vortex method has the advantage of considering the wake history in the estimation of the aerodynamic forces. Using the panel vortex method developed in this study, one is not dependent on look-up tables since the aerodynamic loads are calculated by direct modelling of flow conditions on an airfoil of a given geometry. However, the computational time of the vortex method is long and is therefore often not used. There is a possibility to reduce the computational time of the vortex method. By using a graphic processing unit, it is demonstrated how the computational time can be reduced for a two-dimensional panel vortex code. A significant reduction in computational time can be achieved for the simulation, depending on the number of vortex elements in the analysis. For a low amount of vortex elements, the computation is faster on a central processing unit, CPU. The panel vortex method is used to investigate the motion induced aerodynamic loads on an offshore wind turbine. Studying the flow conditions on an airfoil oscillating in plunge motion at frequencies similar to the eigenfrequencies for a floating <b>spar</b> <b>type</b> wind turbine, the aerodynamic damping for eigenmodes represented is estimated. Including the neighbouring airfoils and their wakes in the analysis has a relatively large effect on the estimated aerodynamic damping. The aerodynamic damping is reduced when the period of the oscillating airfoil is equal to the time it takes for one airfoil to travel from its original position to the neighbouring airfoil’s original position. One example where this can occur is if the eigenfrequency of the tower is equal to the blade passing frequency. This effect has previously been studied by other researchers, but mostly for helicopter rotors. The change in the wind-structure interaction effects is studied with regards to the fatigue damage of the tower using a single degree of freedom model. Comparing the fatigue damage results using different computational methods to estimate the aerodynamic forces can be useful when evaluating the effect of the aerodynamic model chosen on the cost. This study only focuses on one unsteady plunging motion, and is therefore limited. It is found that the unsteady aerodynamic models that are most commonly used may overestimate the damping, and thus estimate a too low fatigue damage. This will {{have a negative impact on}} the cost if the wind turbine fails...|$|E

To demonstrate this, one set of EDD is used for generating models of fixed substructures in the syntax of the finite element program ANSYS and the object oriented modeling language Modelica. The generated models are compared to models that were created in the traditional way. The comparison shows a very good agreement between the models, which proves the correctness of the approach.

40|$|Model {{tests were}} {{conducted}} on three generic floating wind turbine systems in 2011 and reported {{in a series of}} papers at the 31 st Ocean, Offshore, and Arctic Engineering Con-ference in 2012. These {{tests were conducted}} at the MARIN facility in The Netherlands, by a consortium of universities, government research organizations, and industry. As part of the testing program, decay tests in platform pitch were conducted with and without wind forcing. It was found that for <b>spar</b> and semisubmersible <b>type</b> structures, resonant pitch motion was damped due to wind in storm sea conditions. The nonlinear decay motion of a floating wind turbine platform is modeled using a one degree-of-freedom nonlinear oscillation equation about a mean offset angle. Attention is paid to the turbine thrust coefficient and its variability with respect to oncoming flow speed, which in turn is affected by the structure pitch motion. The equation of motion reveals that the mean offset position has {{an important role in the}} stiffness, damping, and consequently the natural period of pitch motion. Several important dimensionless parameters are introduced. The paper discusses a simple thrust model for an offshore wind turbine (OWT) based on rudi-ments of blade element theory. Using the simplified thrust coefficient formulation, the increase in platform pitch damping due to wind is formulated.

40|$|In the {{development}} of offshore wind turbine industry, the shift {{from the use of}} fixed-substructure wind turbines to the floating wind turbines is expected to maximise the offshore wind power extraction while reducing construction cost and enhancing the structural reliability, particularly in deep waters. Up to the present time, the available floating wind turbine concepts are adopted from the offshore oil and gas industry experiences, namely semi-submersible, tensioned-leg platform (TLP), and deep draft floater (spar). Especially for the latter <b>type</b> (<b>spar),</b> by combining this platform with large turbine rotors, studies had shown that they are susceptible in terms of platform motions when exposed to a turbulent wind. It was hypothesised that the spatial correlation of the occurring turbulence (lateral and vertical coherences) at different points on the floating wind turbine rotor influences the floater motions. The unstable atmospheric stability conditions which occur more frequently offshore, has been hypothesised to cause severe fatigue damages on the wind turbine components. The two recommended models given in the IEC standards to estimate the spatial correlation of the turbulent wind: the Mann Spectral Tensor Model and the Kaimal Spectra & Exponential Coherence Model predict very different coherences, in particular for larger separations. Moreover, the fact that one of the models is unable to capture the effects of varying atmospheric stability, results in the need to select the suitable model for wind turbine design. This master thesis will investigate the comparison of the influences between the two turbulence models outlined in the IEC standards on a spar-buoy floating wind turbine—the OC 3 -Hywind—motions and fatigue loadings. The effects of the lateral and the vertical coherences from the synthetic (generated) wind fields from the two turbulence models and fitted-measurements parameter inputs on the OC 3 -Hywind turbine loadings and motion responses will be studied using HAWC 2 aero-hydro-servo-elastic code. In addition, the influences of combined turbulence variation and mean wind profile under different atmospheric stability conditions on a spar-buoy floating wind turbine will also be studied. In general, it was noted that the OC 3 -Hywind turbine was rather stiff in terms of yaw motion, but not for the pitch motion. It was found that the IEC Mann Spectral Tensor Model was more conservative when use to quantify damage equivalent loads and platform motions (pitch and yaw) on the OC 3 -Hywind turbine compared to the IEC Kaimal Spectra & Coherence Model. The given parameters from the IEC standards was found to be more conservative than the fitted-measurements parameters in predicting motions and damage equivalent loads of the OC 3 -Hywind. The mean wind profile under stable conditions was observed to affect the blade root fatigue damage by up to 5 % only. It was also observed that a higher vertical coherence resulted in higher pitch motion of the OC 3 -Hywind. The influence of the lateral coherence on the OC 3 -Hywind turbine yaw motion was observed when comparing the coherences from the two IEC turbulent wind models, where lower lateral coherence resulted in higher platform yaw motion. When comparing the coherences from the fitted-measurements parameters, the influence of the lateral coherence on the OC 3 -Hywind yaw motion was less obvious, but the yaw motion was shown to be influenced by the turbulence levels which was correlated with the parameter αϵ^(2 / 3). Nonetheless, the results obtained were based on limited number of simulations, which should ideally be expanded in a more extensive parametric study...|$|R
