40|$|A {{hypervelocity}} {{impact shield}} assembly for protecting a spacecraft surface from hypervelocity impactors. The shield assembly includes {{at least one}} sacrificial impactor disrupting/shocking layer of hypervelocity impactor disrupting/shocking material. A primary spacing element, including space-rated open cell foam material, is positioned between {{the at least one}} sacrificial impactor disrupting/shocking layer and a spacecraft surface. A cover member is arranged and disposed relative to the sacrificial impactor disrupting/shocking layer and the primary spacing element to maintain the integrity of the hypervelocity impact shield assembly. In the event of exposure to a hypervelocity impactor, the sacrificial impactor disrupting/shocking layer is perforated while shocking the impactor breaking it into fragments, and/or melting it, and/or vaporizing it, thus providing a dispersion {{in the form of an}} expanding debris cloud/plume which spreads the impact energy of the impactor over a volume formed by the primary spacing element between the sacrificial impactor disrupting/shocking layer and the spacecraft surface. This significantly reduces impact lethality at the spacecraft surface. The space-rated open cell foam material provides an extremely lightweight, low-cost, efficient means of spacing and supporting the at least one sacrificial impactor disrupting/shocking layer before, during, and after launch. In a preferred embodiment, the invention is in the form of a multi-shock assembly including a plurality of sacrificial impactor disrupting/shocking layers. In such instance, the hypervelocity impact shield assembly includes a plurality of <b>secondary</b> <b>spacing</b> elements. Each <b>secondary</b> <b>spacing</b> element is positioned adjacent an associated sacrificial impactor disrupting/shocking layer to form a multi-shock subassembly. Thus, a plurality of multi-shock subassemblies are provided which include alternating layers of sacrificial impactor disrupting/shocking layers and <b>secondary</b> <b>spacing</b> elements...|$|E
40|$|The {{directional}} solidification of the transparent binary alloy succinonitrile-poly(ethylene oxide) was studied {{in an experiment}} in which solidification speeds of about 2 mm/sec could be reached without loss of the linear temperature gradient. The low di#usivity of the polymer solute allowed {{the study of the}} dynamics of rapid solidification using an optical microscope. For both normal and doublonic dendrites we observed a transition to large triangular "superdendrites " above a certain solidification speed and we report measurements of the primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>spacing</b> {{as a function of the}} pulling speed. Our measurements suggest that the observed triangular shape is due to a decoupling of primary and secondary growth at large undercooling.

40|$|Iron and {{manganese}} {{are common}} impurity elements in cast aluminium alloys, especially in secondary aluminium. During casting Fe/Mn-containing intermetallics are formed between the aluminium dendrites, which cause porosity and shrinkage defects. In this paper an experimental {{study on the}} influence of controlled convection during solidification on the spatial arrangement of intermetallic phases and their interaction with the dendritic microstructure in Al- 7 Si- 1 Fe (AlSiFe) and Al- 7 Si- 1 Mn (AlSiMn) alloys (wt-%) is presented. Forced convection is induced by a rotating magnetic field. The alloys are solidified directionally over a range of constant solidification velocities (0 · 015 - 0 · 18 mm/s) at a constant temperature gradient G of 3 K/mm. The results indicate that the primary spacing and the secondary dendrite arm spacing are affected by the presence of Fe and Mn intermetallic phases. In samples solidified under forced convections the primary dendrite arm spacing did not depend on the solidification velocity and no obvious fluid flow effect on the <b>secondary</b> <b>spacing</b> could be detected. These observations are in contrast to Fe and Mn free alloys. It seems that the intermetallics act as a barrier for the flow into the mushy zone...|$|E

40|$|Directional {{solidification}} {{experiments have}} been carried out in the succinonitrile-acetone system to study transient and steady-state pattern formation of the interface. Initial breakup of a planar interface is studied by driving the system beyond the limit of planar interface stability, and it is found that the interface breaks up into two characteristic wavelengths, (lamda) (, 1) and (lamda) (, 2). Two pattern propagation modes are found, one leading to a cellular structure and the other to a dendritic structure;A systematic experimental study is carried out to quantitatively study the effect of experimental variables on the steady-state length characteristics of the interface pattern. Four steady-state lengths are studied: primary spacing, <b>secondary</b> <b>spacing,</b> dendrite tip radius and the distance between the dendrite tip and the first sidebranch perturbation. These results are compared with the existing theoretical models and it is found that the marginal stability criterion {{plays a key role in}} establishing the various length scales of the dendritic structure. This conclusion was also established by dynamic studies in which a steady-state was perturbed and the process of restabilization was examined quantitatively;Important scaling laws have also been observed among various steady-state length. The primary spacings and secondary spacings have been found to be precisely the same as the wavelengths (lamda) (, 1) and (lamda) (, 2) observed during the planar interface breakup. Furthermore, the dendrite tip radius is found to be equal to (lamda) (, 2) / 2 for all experimental conditions. The distance between the dendrite tip and the first sidebranch perturbation has been found to be equal to 0. 5 ((lamda) (, 1) (lamda) (, 2)) (2 ̆ 7 1 / 2);The coarsening phenomenon by which the secondary branches change their spacing with time has been investigated, as the effect of velocity, temperature gradient and composition and the coarsening rate is measured. The conditions for the formation of tertiary branches have also been investigated and the mechanism by which tertiary branches become primary branches is proposed.

It is still not clear how the <b>secondary</b> storage <b>space</b> shape influences the P- & S-wave velocities (or elastic properties) in complex carbonate reservoirs. In this paper, three classical rock physics models (Wyllie timeaverage equation, Gassmann equation and the Kuster-Toksöz model) are comparably analyzed for their construction principles and actual velocity prediction results, aiming at determining the most favourable rock physics model to consider the influence of <b>secondary</b> storage <b>space</b> shape. Then relationships between the P- & S-wave velocities in carbonate reservoirs and geometric shapes of <b>secondary</b> storage <b>spaces</b> are discussed from different aspects based on actual well data by employing the favourable rock physics model. To explain the influence of <b>secondary</b> storage <b>space</b> shape on VP-VS relationship, it is analyzed for the differences of S-wave velocities between derived from common empirical relationships (including Castagna’s mud rock line and Greenberg-Castagna VP-VS relationship) and predicted by the rock physics model. We advocate that VP-VS relationship for complex carbonate reservoirs should be built for different storage space types. For the carbonate reservoirs in the Tarim Basin, the VP-VS relationships for f ractured, fractured-cavernous, and fractured-hole-vuggy reservoirs are respectively built {{on the basis of}} velocity prediction and <b>secondary</b> storage <b>space</b> type determination. Through the discussion above, it is expected that the velocity prediction and the VP-VS relationships for complex carbonate reservoirs should fully consider the influence of <b>secondary</b> storage <b>space</b> shape, thus providing more reasonable constraints for prestack inversion, further building a foundation for realizing carbonate reservoir prediction and fluid prediction.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{knowledge}} of the variation of permeability in interdendritic channels is important in order to analyze {{the ability of the}} liquid flow compensate the shrinkage of the alloy during solidification. In this work the influence of the magnesium content in the permeability of interdendritic channels during unidirectional solidification of Al-Mg alloys is analyzed. Design/methodology/approach: Al-Mg alloys with 5, 10 and 15 wt% Mg were submitted to unidirectional solidification leading to a columnar dendritic structure. From the samples obtained, the primary and <b>secondary</b> dendrite arms <b>spacing</b> variations during the solidification process were measured. Applying a heuristic method, developed by some of the authors of this work, the variation of permeability of interdendritic channels for a flow parallel to primary dendrite arms was estimated as function of primary and <b>secondary</b> dendrite arms <b>spacing,</b> and liquid fraction variations during solidification. Findings: From the results obtained for the three alloys with different compositions it was concluded that the behavior of the permeability depends on the relation between secondary and primary dendrite arms spacing and for the same distance from the metal/mould interface the permeability decreases when the magnesium content increase. Research limitations/implications: The magnesium content affects the primary and <b>secondary</b> dendrite arms <b>spacing</b> affecting as consequence the permeability of the interdendritic channels. Both primary and <b>secondary</b> dendrite arm <b>spacing</b> increases with magnesium content. The permeability depends on primary and <b>secondary</b> dendrite arm <b>spacing,</b> but also on the relation between these parameters.
