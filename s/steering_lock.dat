25|$|The second {{qualifying}} {{session was}} delayed due to multiple crashes during qualifying for the FIA GT World Cup support race. When the session did begin and before any competitor could record a timed lap, {{the first of}} two red flags was waved for Ilott who swiped the barriers exiting the San Francisco Bend. Later Melco hairpin was blocked when Menezes was attempting to return to pit lane after running off the circuit at Moorish turn and could not get enough <b>steering</b> <b>lock</b> and understeered into the barriers. Lorandi could not react quickly enough and ploughed into Menezes's rear end. Lorandi's rear-end in turn was hit by a Signature car. Rosenqvist continued his strong form from Thursday's qualifying and set the pace again before Leclerc usurped his time halfway through the session. Rosenqvist had new tyres installed on his vehicle and returned {{to the top of the}} standings. He later improved with a lap of two minutes and 10.474 in response to Juncadella getting close to Rosenqvist's pace. The session was abandoned with four minutes remaining when Giovinazzi crashed at the left-hand corner before Maternity Bend. Thus, Rosenqvist took pole position at Macau by 0.213 seconds ahead of Juncadella. Leclerc moved up eight from his provisional grid position to start from third and was the best placed of all the rookie drivers. Giovinazzi dropped one position from third to fourth. Pommer was in the top three for the majority of the session before settling for fifth. However he was handed a two-place grid penalty for impeding another car during qualifying. MacLeod and Sette Câmara consequently moved into fifth and sixth as a result of Pommer's penalty. Pommer was ahead of a close trio of cars driven by Macau rookies. Maini, Lorandi and Stroll were the three drivers who rounded out the top ten. The sixth row was adorned by the Mücke Motorsport cars of Ferrucci and Jensen. The rest of the grid lined up as the British duo of Sims and Dennis, Albon, Sekiguchi, Tveter, Ilott, the Japanese pair of Kanamaru and Takaboshi, Chang, Cao, Yamashita, Cassidy, Menezes, Boccolacci, Solomon and Zhi.|$|E
2500|$|The {{bodywork}} was aerodynamically {{designed for}} increased fuel {{efficiency and speed}} as well as light weight, and its platform featured a lightweight cromoly-steel hinged chassis, rear-mounted V8 engine, front-drive and three-wheels. The vehicle was steered via the third wheel at the rear, capable of 90° <b>steering</b> <b>lock.</b> Thus able to steer in a tight circle, the Dymaxion often caused a sensation, [...] bringing nearby traffic to a halt.|$|E
2500|$|The {{change in}} the body style from the Mark B was both {{functional}} and aesthetic. The Mark C utilised the same 180° <b>steering</b> <b>lock</b> and worm and sector steering system that {{was seen in the}} prototype Commercial and the front wings allowed for ample clearance at full lock. They also addressed a demand from customers for a [...] "greater smoothness of line", and allowed a more robust location for the mounting of the front lights. Other improvements included rod and cable operated brakes on all three wheels, which [...] "appreciably shortens stopping distances." ...|$|E

5000|$|An anti-hijack {{system is}} an {{electronic}} system fitted to motor vehicles to deter criminals from hijacking them. Although {{these types of}} systems are becoming more common on newer cars, they have not caused a decrease in insurance premiums as {{they are not as}} widely known as other more common anti-theft systems such as alarms or <b>steering</b> <b>locks.</b> It can also be a part of an alarm or immobiliser system. An approved anti-hijacking system will achieve a safe, quick shutdown of the vehicle it is attached to. There are also mechanical anti-hijack devices.|$|R
2500|$|Initially, the Argentinian Chevy used {{very similar}} trim to the American counterpart, while more luxurious – a [...] "big" [...] car by local {{standard}}s. They there standard models without accessories and {{were used for}} cab service. The interior layout remained the American 1968 version for the entire run. The ignition switch remained dash mounted as the US-mandated <b>steering</b> <b>lock</b> was not required in Argentina. Power steering became available {{at the end of}} the production run. V8s versions weren't produced: [...] Power windows were not available, tinted windows were darker than American versions, and the darker band on the upper edge of the windshield was not present.|$|E
2500|$|All {{the quality}} and {{engineering}} upgrades and revisions seen on AMC cars for 1972 were also present in Mexico. The 1972 VAM Javelin saw considerable improvements {{in terms of both}} performance and sportiness. Heavy duty springs and shocks along with front sway bar were passed on to the standard equipment list, as also were power front disk brakes and power steering, all regardless of transmission. Units equipped with the four-speed manual transmission changed to a rear differential gear ratio of 3.31:1 and included a center console with locking compartment as standard equipment. The [...] "Shift-Command" [...] Borg-Warner automatic transmissions were replaced by the new [...] "Torque Command" [...] Chrysler-built A998 TorqueFlite. The chromed grille applied on the tail light lenses and the new rectangular grid front grille of the AMC Javelins arrived for the VAM models. The exterior included for the first time factory stripe designs. The interior saw new seat patterns and a new three-spoke sports steering wheel with an [...] "American Motors" [...] legend on the transparent plastic cap of the horn button. A new steering column design with a built-in safety lever to engage the <b>steering</b> <b>lock</b> came and the mechanism blocking the shifters to ignition switch departed.|$|E

50|$|A {{combination}} <b>steering</b> <b>lock</b> and {{ignition key}} was fitted to the steering column, which replaced the dashboard mounted ignition switch and charismatic push button starter. A new steering column was {{fitted with a}} collapsible section {{in the event of}} an accident.|$|E
50|$|For {{research}} into Tricycle undercarriages D.W.L. converted the prototype RWD 9 to the RWD 20 fitting a 130 hp Walter Major engine, steerable noseleg, moving the main undercarriage legs rearwards, and removing the rear seats door and windows which were faired over with plywood. Extensive testing {{was carried out}} with take-offs, landings and taxiing on different surfaces including unprepared fields as well as ploughed land. Conversion was completed in 1938 and the flight trials proved the stability and manoeuvrability of the tri-cycle undercarriage during extensive taxiing trials, (landings and take-offs were carried out with the nosewheel <b>steering</b> <b>locked).</b> The fate of the RWD 20 is unknown {{but it did not}} survive WWII.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The fitting of {{security}} devices to motor vehicles {{has become an}} important approach to the prevention of motor vehicle crime. In cars, manu-facturers have focused primarily on improving perimeter security to prevent breaking-in to the vehicle, and installing devices to prevent parked vehicles from being unlawfully driven away. The <b>steering</b> column <b>lock</b> Is an Important example of this approach, being {{the outcome of the}} first and only regulations requiring vehicles to befitted with anti-theft devices. The Federal Republic of Germany was the first country to Introduce such regulations, In 1961, followed nearly ten years later by the U. S. and Britain. This paper examines the effect of these regulations on motor vehicle crime In each of these countries. The evidence from all three countries is that <b>steering</b> column <b>locks</b> have helped to bring vehicle theft, particularly theftfor temporary use, under control for lengthy periods. The paper provides evidence that the speed with which the vehicle population has been protected by <b>steering</b> column <b>locks,</b> and the availability of other types of vehicles notprotected by such anti-theft devices, are Important issues in explaining theft patterns...|$|R
50|$|The 90 {{was well}} equipped, {{including}} electric front windows and electrically adjustable seats as standard. The luxurious Gold Cloverleaf (Quadrifoglio Oro) model had electric rear windows, a trip computer, power <b>steering,</b> central <b>locking,</b> metallic paint and a digital instrument panel as standard.|$|R
50|$|Ultimately {{its most}} popular form was an {{hour-glass}} shaped worm which engages with a double-toothed roller follower on the rocker shaft for the steering arm. The {{result is that}} substantially the same leverage is provided from one <b>steering</b> <b>lock</b> to the other.|$|E
50|$|When Norton {{production}} {{moved to}} Plumstead in 1963, {{production of the}} De Luxe ended, but the Standard model continued with wider front forks and a <b>steering</b> <b>lock,</b> until Navigator production ended in 1965 {{with the collapse of}} Norton's parent group, Associated Motor Cycles.|$|E
50|$|The {{steerable}} front {{truck was}} fitted with twin duplex wheels (four tyres), the inner wheels equipped with pneumatic drum brakes.

2500|$|In 2008, the Portland {{was set to}} {{participate}} in the first steamboat race on the Columbia River in more than half a century, recreating the 1952 race. [...] She was set to race against the sternwheeler Columbia Gorge, {{as a part of the}} Sternwheeler Days Festival in Cascade <b>Locks,</b> Oregon. Portlands <b>steering</b> <b>locked,</b> and she ran into the bank, damaging her wheel. [...] Without power or steering, she drifted towards the Bonneville Dam until another tug secured a line and towed her to safety. A Coast Guard investigation cited a problem with an improperly repaired gear in the steering system dating back to 1997. Portland and Columbia Gorge have since raced at least three times, with the Portland winning two of the races.|$|R
50|$|The 1969 F-85/Cutlass models {{received}} only minor trim changes from their '68 counterparts {{such as a}} now-Olds trademark split grille with vertical bars and vertical taillights. Per federal safety regulations, headrests were now standard equipment and the ignition switch moved from the instrument panel to the <b>steering</b> column to <b>lock</b> the <b>steering</b> wheel when not in use, in common with all other 1969-model GM cars, one year before the <b>locking</b> <b>steering</b> columns were federally mandated.|$|R
25|$|A {{major problem}} on the estate in the past was the {{presence}} of joyriders exploiting the straight main roads that {{ran the length of}} the estate. To tackle this, the HAT employed a traffic calming scheme in April 1998. This was done by installing speed bumps, mini-roundabouts and narrowing road lanes. An issue for residents was securing their property from thieves and so the HAT provided burglar alarms and car <b>steering</b> <b>locks.</b> In February 1999, 59 Home Wardens were introduced to the estate to help protect property and forge links between residents and community groups. As they had no law enforcement powers, funding was provided for two extra police officers for three years. A centre was also set up for dealing with any reports of racial harassment on the estate.|$|R
5000|$|Passenger {{automobile}} regulations {{implemented by}} the U.S. Department of Transportation required the locking of steering wheel rotation (or transmission locked in [...] "park") to hinder motor vehicle theft; in most vehicles, this is accomplished when the ignition key {{is removed from the}} ignition lock.

50|$|By the 21st century, Takaichi Mabuchi {{had taken}} over as {{chairman}} of Mabuchi Motor, and Shinji Kamei was appointed president. Older brother Kenichi Mabuchi died in 2005. Takaichi determined to carry on his legacy. And so, while listening to an MP3 of Wagner he received as a present from his grandson and riding in a luxury car, Takaichi asked Shinji how progress was going in expanding the company's automobile electronic component field. CD players were losing popularity but the automotive market for small electric motors was booming. In an ordinary automobile, 50 to 60 small motors control everything from door locks and power windows to power seats, <b>steering</b> <b>locks,</b> air conditioner dampers, car mirrors, head lamps, navigation systems and audio visual equipment. But in a luxury car like the one Takaichi and Shinji were riding in, over 100 small electric motors are used.|$|R

50|$|Despite {{customer}} complaints, the Wiesel {{retained its}} predecessors hard upholstery, lockable fuel tap flap {{and lack of}} a <b>steering</b> <b>lock.</b> It was easy for a thief to force the flap, and Der deutsche Straßenverkehrs testers were astonished that IWL had not rectified this fault from the previous model. IWL produced the Wiesel until 1959, by which time a total of 57,400 had been built.|$|E
50|$|According to the European Union Commission Directive 95/56/EC (1995), all {{vehicles}} are mandated to be fitted with anti-theft security devices. The regulation requires that a <b>steering</b> <b>lock</b> {{must be able}} to withstand forces of 100Nm applied to the steering wheel without failing. It also requires that cars exported to European markets be fitted with security devices.
