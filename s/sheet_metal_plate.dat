40|$|AbstractThe Fraunhofer IPT {{recently}} {{developed a new}} hybrid laser-assisted shearing process which enables conventional punching machines to produce punched sheared edges with continuous flush-cut surfaces in stainless steel plates (1. 4301), spring steel plates (1. 4310) and titanium alloy plates (3. 7165). The new combination of localised laser-induced softening of the plate material in the shearing zone and the shearing process significantly reduces both process forces and process-related noise emissions. A modular system-upgrade for existing punching machines allows laser-assisted shearing to be implemented {{without the need for}} expensive new machine designs. The principle of the laser-assisted shearing process is based on briefly and selectively heating the material in the shearing zone via local absorption of laser radiation {{on the underside of the}} <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>plate</b> before the punching tool comes into contact on the upper side of the metal plate. Laser-induced heating softens the material in the shearing zone within the material within a few tenths of a second.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} {{our knowledge of the}} Martian polar caps, an improved understanding of the behavior of both frozen H 2 O and CO 2 {{in different parts of the}} electromagnetic spectrum is needed. The thermal microwave part of the spectrum has received relatively little attention compared to the visible and infrared wavelengths. A simple experiment to measure the brightness temperature of frozen CO 2 was first performed in the winter of 1998 using a 35 GHz radiometer. in experiments performed during the winter of 1999 and 2000, passive microwave radiation emanating from within layers of manufactured CO 2 (dry ice) crystals was again measured with a 35 GHz handheld radiometer. Both large (0. 8 cm) and small (0. 3 cm) cylindrical-shaped dry ice pellets, at a temperature of 197 K (- 76 C), were measured. A 1 sq m plate of aluminum sheet metal was positioned beneath the dry ice so that microwave emissions from the underlying soil layers would be minimized. Non-absorbing foam was positioned around the sides of the plate in order to keep the dry ice in place and to assure that the incremental deposits were level. Thirty-five GHz measurements of this plate were made through the dry ice deposits in the following way. Layers of dry ice were built up and measurements were repeated for the increasing CO 2 pack. First, 7 cm of large CO 2 pellets were poured onto the <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>plate,</b> then an additional 7 cm were added, and finally, 12 cm were added on top of the 14 cm base. Hand-held 35 GHz measurements were made each time the thickness of the deposit was increased. The same process was repeated for the smaller grain pellets. Furthermore, during the past winter, 35 GHz measurements were taken of a 25 kg (27 cm x 27 cm x 27 cm) solid cube Of CO 2, which was cut in half and then re-measured.

40|$|The {{nature and}} scope of this thesis relates to obtaining an {{understanding}} {{of the way in which}} sheet metal forming processes affect the residual stresses (plastic deformation) and the fatigue perfomiance of wheel centre discs made of a dual phase steel. Automotive wheels are mainly manufactured from <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>plate</b> by forming processes using tools and dies. This manufacturing process is directly concemed with deforming the plate under predominantly applied tensile forces where the component acquires a sfress state which is multi-axiial. This stress state is both complex and difficult to assess from an analytical point of view and thus the work reported in this thesis is of an applied nature, and seeks to understand the results of this stress state on residual stresses, hardness and, hence fatigue behaviour. Components from each stage of the centre disc manufacturing process and of the assembled and painted wheel will be assessed and characterised. The first part of the work involved a literature review of the factors influencing sheet metal forming, i. e. elongation, anisofropy, grain size, springback, residual sfresses and fatigue. This review gave the researcher a background from which he could confidently approach the various investigations that were required for successfiil completion of this project. The residual stress analysis led to an investigation that provided a new technique for residual stress measurement using the high speed centre hole drilling method. This new measurement technique gave improved results when assessing the residual stress behaviour of textured sheet materials subjected to plastic deformation. It is felt that this technique will also minimise the inherent scatter that is perceived by many an analyst to be a fundamental part of residual stress assessment by the hole drilling method. The concept of this measuring technique has since been patented and is subject to a South African Patent Application No. 2000 / 2042. The thesis then deals with the process analysis of centre disc manufactiure as well as the analysis of the fatigue properties of specimens removed from each stage of the manufacturing process and of the complete wheel. Here the complexity of the cenfre disc manufacturing process is discussed and assessed in terms of the process effects on microstructure, surface hardness, induced residual stresses and fatigue performance. The aim of this part of the work is to seek relationships with respect to surface hardness, induced residual stress and fatigue life in terms of the various production stage components including the centre disc of the complete wheel. The results showed that relationships do exist and that fatigue life prediction can be based on surface hardness as well as residual sfress assessments for centre discs manufactured from dual phase steel plate. The final part considers modelling the fatigue life of automotive wheels based on the mean stress models of Soderberg, Goodman and Gerber and incorporating the induced residual stresses into the equations. The Gerber model was found to give the better correlation with regard to fatigue life prediction when compared with the actual fatigue data. hi conclusion, this research has led to the development of a model showing the relation and impact of the centre disc manufacturing process on induced residual stress levels and fatigue properties of dual phase steel plate.

40|$|Abstract: The {{economy of}} the process for the {{manufacture}} of parts from <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>plates</b> depends on successful solution {{of the process of}} cutting various parts from <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>plates.</b> Essentially, the problem is to arrange contours within a defined space so that they take up minimal surface. When taken in this way, the considered problem assumes a more general nature; it refers to the utilization of a flat surface, and it can represent a general principle of arranging 2 D contours on a certain surface. The paper presents a conceptual solution and a prototypal intelligent nesting system for optimal cutting. The problem of nesting can generally be divided into two intellectual phases: recognition and classification of shapes, and arrangement of recognized shapes on a given surface. In solving these problems, methods of artificial intelligence are applied. In the paper, trained neural network is used for recognition of shapes; on the basis of raster record of a part's drawing, it recognizes the part's shape and which class it belongs to. By means of the expert system, based on rules defined on the basis of acquisition of knowledge from manufacturing sections, {{as well as on the}} basis of certain mathematical algorithms, parts are arranged on the arrangement surface. Both systems can also work independently, having been built on the modular principle. The system uses various product models as elements of integration for the entire system...|$|R
