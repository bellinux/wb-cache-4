Furthermore, as Bakker (1970) observed {{in the context of}} Dimetrodon, many lizard species raise a dorsal ridge of skin during threat and courtship displays, and positively allometric, sexually dimorphic frills and dewlaps are present in extant lizards (Echelle et al. 1978; Christian et al. 1995). There is also evidence of sexual dimorphism both in the robustness of the skeleton and in the relative height of the spines of D. limbatus (Romer and Price 1940).|$|E
5|$|The tournament {{generated}} {{a profit of}} Â£10 and the pony roller stayed in use. When the tournament was finished, Henry Jones gathered all the score cards to analyse the results and found that, of the 601 games played during the tournament, 376 were won by the server ("striker-in") and 225 by the receiver ("striker-out"). At {{a time when the}} service was either made underarm or, usually, at <b>shoulder</b> <b>height,</b> this was seen as a serving dominance and resulted in a modification of the rules for the 1878 Championship. To decrease the target area for the server, the length of the service court was reduced from 26 to 22ft (7.92 to 6.71m) and to make passing shots easier against volleyers the height of the net was reduced to 4ft 9 in (1.45m) at the posts and 3 feet (0.91m) at the centre. These rules were published jointly by the AEC & LTC and the MCC, giving the AEC & LTC an official rule-making authority and in effect retroactively sanctioning its 1877 rules. It marked the moment when the AEC & LTC effectively usurped the rule-making initiative from the MCC although the latter would still ratify rule changes until 1882. In recognition of the importance and popularity of lawn tennis, the club was renamed in 1882 to All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC).|$|E

25|$|If the bowler bowls a {{ball that}} bounces and passes the batsman above head height.

25|$|In {{the sport}} of cricket, throwing, {{commonly}} referred to as chucking, is an illegal bowling action which occurs when a bowler straightens the bowling arm when delivering the ball. The laws of cricket specify that a bowler's arm must not extend during the bowling action. Only the rotation of the shoulder can be used to impart velocity to the ball. Throws are not allowed. If the umpire deems that the ball has been thrown, he will call a no ball which means the batsman cannot be given out from that delivery. Current regulations of the International Cricket Council (ICC) set the legal limit of 15 degrees of permissible straightening of the elbow joint for all bowlers in international cricket. This law applies between {{the point at which the}} bowling arm passes above <b>shoulder</b> <b>height</b> and the point at which the ball is released. The limit is to allow some natural flexing of the elbow joint which happens during the course of legal delivery.|$|E
