50|$|<b>Slide</b> <b>gate</b> {{operators}} are commonly {{installed at the}} end of the gate in the closed position but can also be installed by the end of the gate in the open position. In America the most common form of automation is a chain attached across the gate near the bottom and passing through the operator, which shuttles it back and forth. In the end of the gate/open position you do not see the chain or any operating equipment near the gate. In Europe a metal or plastic rack is attached to the gate with a gear fitted to the operator. The American method is more flexible and allows for greater movement in the gates, the European method makes for a quieter and more secure system. Sliding gates are often large, heavy and therefore more hazardous than swing gates they can however be equipped with appropriate safety devices making them some of the safest gate systems available.|$|E

40|$|The inter-related {{effects of}} nozzle clogging, argon injection, tundish bath depth, <b>slide</b> <b>gate</b> opening {{position}} and nozzle bore diameter on the flow rate and pressure in tundish nozzles are quantified using three-dimensional multiphase turbulent numerical fluid flow models. The results are validated with measurements on operating steel continuous slab-casting machines, and presented for practical conditions {{with the aid}} of an inverse model. Initial clogging is predicted to enhance the flow due to a potential streamlining effect before it becomes great enough to restrict the flow channel. The clogging condition can be detected by comparing the measured steel flow rate to the theoretical value predicted under the same conditions by the inverse model presented here. Increasing argon injection may help to reduce air aspiration by increasing the minimum pressure below the <b>slide</b> <b>gate.</b> More argon is needed to do this at intermediate casting speeds and in deeper tundishes. Argon flow should be reduced during shallow tundish and low casting speed conditions (such as encountered during a transition) in order to avoid detrimental effects on flow pattern. It should also be reduced at high casting speed, when the <b>slide</b> <b>gate</b> is open wider and the potential for air aspiration is less. The optimal argon flow rate depends on the casting speed, tundish level, and nozzle bore diameter and is quantified in this work for a typical nozzle and range of conditions...|$|E

Different compositions are formulated taking single or combination of metals which are mixed with phenol formaldehyde resin and pressed with a specific pressure of 2000 kg/cm 2. The bricks are cured at 240 °C for 12 hours. Physical, thermal and thermo mechanical properties are evaluated. Also the bricks are fired at 1100 °C in reducing atmosphere. Physical, thermal and thermo mechanical properties are evaluated and correlated with the mineralogical and microstructural analysis. Based on these findings carbon bearing plates are made {{with the addition of}} carbon black or carbon black and graphite. The addition is restricted up to 5 %. Properties are evaluated and correlated with mineralogical and microstructural analysis. Plates containing aluminium metal shows superior thermal and thermo-mechanical properties than silicon metal containing Al 2 O 3 slide plates. However plate containing metal in combination has the best thermal and thermo-mechanical properties. Fused alumina based plates has comparatively superior properties for all grade of metal addition. Plate containing both carbon black and graphite flake was having comparatively efficient properties in carbon bonded slide plates.

40|$|Unstable {{meniscus}} flow {{leads to}} slab surface defects during continuous casting of steel, due to level fluctuations and vortex formation, which causes entrapment of argon bubbles and mold flux.

40|$|Most dams have a {{low-level}} outlet {{that consists of}} a closed conduit through the dam with a <b>slide</b> <b>gate</b> or valve to regulate flow. These outlets are used mainly for irrigational purposes but also for flushing the reservoir and controlling the reservoir elevation. When discharging through the low-level outlet works, negative pressures can develop on the downstream side of the gate creating a potential for cavitation damage and vibration. To minimize these effects, air vents (vented to the atmosphere) are installed on the downstream side of the gate to limit downstream pressure to something above vapor pressure (i. e., near atmospheric pressure). Previous air venting studies have been mostly limited to large dam outlet geometries, which typically feature a vertical gate in a flat-bottomed discharge tunnel. The large-dam air demand analysis {{has been based on}} the Froude number of the supercritical flow at the vena contract (located between the gate and the hydraulic jump) and the water flow rate. Small to medium-sized embankment dams typically utilize a <b>slide</b> <b>gate</b> installed on the sloped upstream face for flow control, followed by a vertical elbow connected to a sloping pipe. With this outlet geometry, there is no 1 -D vena contracta flow, no classical hydraulic jump, and no representative Froude number. Additionally, no head-discharge characteristic data have been found for inclined slide gates (vented or non-vented) for small to medium-sized dams. Consequently, unless a flow measurement structure is installed in the discharge channel downstream of the dam, determining the water discharge rate based on gate opening and head on the gate, and consequently the air demand is problematic. This study focuses on quantifying air demand and air vent sizing for the small to medium-sized embankment dam low-level outlet geometries by providing: 1. Cd values as a function of gate openings and air demand; to better estimate flow rates from outlet works of similar geometries. 2. Flow conditions for varying operating conditions. 3. A new relationship for sizing air vents as a function of driving head and gate opening. 4. The magnitude of negative pressures for non-vented conduits. 5. A foundation for future studies and development of air demand research. This thesis presents the findings of this study...|$|E
40|$|The {{majority}} of dams contain low-level outlet works, which typically consist of closed conduits that {{run through the}} dam, and are used to release water from the reservoir when the water level is {{below the level of}} the surface spillways. It is also used to flush the reservoir of sediments and to control the elevation of the reservoir. Low-level outlet works typically consist of a gate that controls the flow within a closed conduit that runs through the dam and an air vent that supplies air behind the gate. In the absence of properly designed air vents, negative pressures may develop downstream of the gate. These negative pressures could potentially lead to cavitation and vibration damage. Properly sized air vents help maintain the downstream air pressure at or near atmospheric pressure and/or provide air to absorb the energy generated by cavitation, reducing the potential for damage. The {{majority of}} research done on air vent sizing is for dams having large dam geometry, which consist of a pressurized conduit leading to a vertical <b>slide</b> <b>gate</b> that is followed by a discharge tunnel. The typical air vent design for these large dams uses the water flow rate and the Froude number measured at the vena contracta downstream of the gate. The low-level outlet works for small-to-medium-sized embankment dam geometries typically have an inclined <b>slide</b> <b>gate,</b> installed at the inlet on the upstream face of the dam slope, followed by an elbow that connects to a conduit that passes through the dam and discharges downstream. This type of outlet geometry does not produce the typical vena contracta. Consequently, the use of the Froude number, at the vena contracta, as a characteristic parameter for characterizing airflow demand is not practical. Recently a laboratory study was performed calculating the head-discharge characteristics of low-level outlets for small-to-medium sized dam geometries. In addition to validating some of the previous laboratory-scale air venting research, the objective of this study was field verification of air-demand/air vent sizing predicted by the laboratory-based method. The influence of conduit slope, air port location, and hydraulic jumps on air demand was also evaluated in the laboratory. The findings of this study can be found within this thesis...|$|E

40|$|Primarily, a Gated-Viewing (GV) system {{provides}} range gated imagery. By increasing the camera delay time from frame to frame, a so-called <b>sliding</b> <b>gates</b> sequence is obtained by which 3 -D reconstruction is possible. An important parameter of a <b>sliding</b> <b>gates</b> sequence is the step size {{by which the}} gate is shifted. In {{order to reduce the}} total number of required images, this step size should be as large as possible without significantly degrading the range accuracy. In this paper we have studied the influence of the gate shift step size on the resulting range accuracy. Therefore, we have combined the Intevac Gated-Viewing detector M 506 with a pulsed 1. 57 µm illumination laser. The maximal laser pulse energy is 65 mJ. The target is a one-square-meter-plate at a distance of 500 m. The plate is laminated with a Spectralon layer having Lambertian reflection behavior with a homogeneous reflectance of 93 %. For the measurements, this plate was orientated diagonally to the line of sight of the sensor in order to provide a depth scenario. We have considered different combinations of the two parameters »gate length« (13. 5 m, 23. 25 m, 33 m) and »signal-to-noise ratio« (SNR) (2 dB, 3 dB, 5 dB, 6 dB, 7 dB, 8 dB). For each considered set of parameters, a <b>sliding</b> <b>gates</b> sequence of the target was recorded. Per range, 20 frames were collected. The gate shift step size was set to the minimal possible value, 75 cm. By skipping certain ranges, a <b>sliding</b> <b>gates</b> sequence with a larger gate shift step size is obtained. For example, skipping the ranges 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, [...] . (equivalent: taking the ranges 1, 4, 7, [...] .) results in a gate shift step size of 2. 25 m.

Experiments have been performed on a 0. 4 -scale water model to verify the computational model by comparing its prediction with velocity measurements using PIV (Particle Image Velocimetry) technology. The computational model was developed using CFX and then employed to investigate the effects of various casting process variables.
