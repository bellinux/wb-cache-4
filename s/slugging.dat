40|$|The goal of {{the study}} is to develop a <b>slug</b> {{generator}} that can be used upstream of the Multiphase Capacitive Flow meter (MCF) developed by KSEPL. This meter operates only in the intermittent flow regime. The scope of application should be widened to the stratified and stratified annular flow regime by means of a <b>slug</b> generator. Objectives in the study are the design, modelling and validation of the device, the <b>Slug</b> Generator, meeting requirements for its operation. <b>Slug</b> generator operation requirements consist of an overall <b>slug</b> performance in the stratified and stratified annular flow regime, compact geometry, robustness, low pressure loss and assessment of measurability of the <b>slugs</b> produced. Literature study and <b>slug</b> generator design stages resulted in a device meeting these specifications. This device, the <b>Slug</b> Generator, consists of a kink and an inverted U-tube. Observations of the flow behaviour reveal that the kink continuously propagates shock waves encountering the incoming liquid flow in the pipe sections upstream of the <b>Slug</b> Generator. In this way instabilities are created from which liquid <b>slugs</b> are initiated. These <b>slugs</b> subsequently travel via the inverted U-tube to the downstream pipe, where they continue as liquid <b>slugs</b> over an appreciable pipe length. Such <b>slugs</b> can be used as input to the MCF. <b>Slug</b> Generator performance has been validated in a laboratory scale 2 ft tubing air -' water test loop and a full scale 4 " tubing air - gasoil test loop. The <b>Slug</b> Generator produces <b>slugs</b> over the entire range of validation covering the complete flow map. A deterministic and a probabilistic model of the <b>Slug</b> Generator have been developed. The <b>slug</b> generating mechanism of the <b>Slug</b> Generator bas been implemented in the models. This mechanism consists of a superposition of the hold-up building processes: stratified flow, liquid accumulating, shock wave propagation and <b>slug</b> initiation. The deterministic model computes the critical <b>slug</b> initiation level over the pipe sections upstream of the <b>Slug</b> Generator. The probabilistic model calculates an evolutionary probability density function in the <b>slug</b> generating zone; an upstream pipe section in which <b>slug</b> generation takes place. Both models provide information on <b>slug</b> generating zone length, <b>slug</b> frequency and <b>Slug</b> Generator operation limits. The models have been qualitatively validated in the 2 " and 4 " tubing test loops. The model can be quantitatively improved by adopting an interfacial shear wave model and improving the critical <b>slug</b> initiation level calculation. Pressure drop over the <b>Slug</b> Generator bas been modelled. It has been validated in a laboratory scale 2 " tubing air - water test loop. It is sufficiently accurate in calculating the full scale 4 " tubing air - gasoil test loop. The MCF is able to correlate on the <b>slugs</b> produced by the <b>Slug</b> Generator. It meters satisfactorily without any adjustments to hard- or software in the stratified flow area and {{a small part of the}} stratified annular flow area, whereas it operates normally in its operating envelope. Metering in the stratified flow area is successful if <b>slugs</b> are produced that have steady state characteristics. Therefore the MCF needs to be placed some 35 diameters from the <b>Slug</b> Generator; whereas in annular flow metering is successful if the MCF is placed some 15 diameters from the <b>Slug</b> Generator to prevent the <b>slugs</b> from being blown apart. A MCF position description is still acking. This can he achieved by implementing a model on <b>slug</b> stability, <b>slug</b> hold-up, <b>slug</b> length and <b>slug</b> velocity in the <b>Slug</b> Generator model. MCF performance can be improved by implementing a model on developing <b>slug</b> flow in the software. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

5000|$|A modern variant {{between the}} Foster <b>slug</b> and the sabot <b>slug</b> is the wad <b>slug,</b> {{sometimes}} called a [...] "drive key slug", {{or just a}} [...] "key slug". This {{is a type of}} shotgun <b>slug</b> designed to be fired through a smoothbore shotgun barrel. Like the traditional Foster <b>slug,</b> a deep hollow is located in the rear of this <b>slug,</b> which serves to retain the center of mass near the front tip of the <b>slug</b> much like the Foster <b>slug.</b> However, unlike the Foster <b>slug,</b> a wad <b>slug</b> additionally has a key or web wall molded across the deep hollow, spanning the hollow, which serves to increase the structural integrity of the <b>slug</b> while also reducing the amount of expansion of the <b>slug</b> when fired, reducing the stress on the shot wad in which it rides down a barrel. Also, unlike Foster <b>slugs</b> that have thin fins {{on the outside of the}} <b>slug,</b> much like those on the Brenneke, the wad <b>slug</b> is shaped with an ogive or bullet shape, with a smooth outer surface. The wad <b>slug</b> is loaded using a standard shotshell wad, which acts like a sabot. The diameter of the wad <b>slug</b> is slightly less than the nominal bore diameter, being around 0.690 inch for a 12-gauge wad <b>slug,</b> and a wad <b>slug</b> is generally cast solely from pure lead, necessary for increasing safety if the <b>slug</b> is ever fired through a choked shotgun. Common 12 gauge wad <b>slug</b> masses include -oz. and 1-oz. wad <b>slugs,</b> and they are loaded in a traditional shotshell wad intended for variously loading among -oz., 1-oz., or 1-oz. shotshells. Depending on the specific stack-up, a card wad is also sometimes located between the <b>slug</b> and the shotshell wad, depending largely on which hull is specified, with the primary intended purpose of improving fold crimps on the loaded wad <b>slug</b> shell that serves to regulate fired shotshell pressures and improve accuracy.|$|R

50|$|Conservationists {{within the}} Pacific Northwest and BC Canada are {{concerned}} about competition between Arion ater and native <b>slugs</b> such as the banana <b>slug</b> (Ariolimax californicus, A. columbianus, and A. dolichophallus). The University of British Columbia’s zoology department published a study on this interaction in 2015. They determined the two <b>slugs</b> to be functionally different but proposed further studies to determine if black <b>slugs</b> are displacing native <b>slugs.</b> Their study found black <b>slugs</b> were more abundant and consumed a greater quantity of mushrooms than native banana <b>slugs</b> but could not determine reasons for differences in population sizes. They theorized the greater abundance of black <b>slugs</b> could be because the black <b>slug</b> displaced banana <b>slugs</b> or because the black <b>slug</b> might be invading areas with previously low banana <b>slug</b> numbers; however, there is no data for banana <b>slug</b> population sizes prior {{to the arrival of}} Arion ater. This complicates determining if alien <b>slugs</b> have a negative or negligible effect upon native <b>slug</b> numbers. Additionally, this study could not determine if high fungi-consumption resulted from dietary preference or from higher concentrations of alien <b>slugs</b> amidst Douglas fir forests, which promote fungal growth. The study also concluded that black and banana <b>slugs</b> compete for under-story berries. Thankfully, the study demonstrated neither native nor alien <b>slugs</b> consume conifer or fern seedlings. The study demonstrated no significant difference between metabolic rates; however, they concluded the black <b>slug</b> may eat more because of its shorter life span (one compared to several years), requiring faster consumption rates in order to reach sexual maturity. The study demonstrated both <b>slugs</b> benefit ecosystems by dispersing seeds and spores. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the two <b>slugs</b> to be functionally different; however, this study proposed further research on the following to determine if black <b>slugs</b> are displacing banana slugs: interactions between Arion ater and fungal communities and comparative studies looking at seed dispersal rates to determine their effect on native, fruit-bearing plant communities.|$|R

50|$|The black <b>slug</b> (also {{known as}} black arion, European black <b>slug,</b> or large black <b>slug)</b> Arion ater L. {{is a large}} {{terrestrial}} gastropod mollusk in the family Arionidae—the round back <b>slugs.</b> Land <b>slugs</b> lack shells like other terrestrial mollusks (such as snails). Without such shells, <b>slugs</b> produce unappetizing mucus—that may also contain toxins—to deter predators. Additionally, terrestrial <b>slugs</b> produce two other forms of mucus that facilitate locomotion and prevent death from drying. Such mollusks are hermaphroditic preferring to find mates. <b>Slugs</b> most often function as decomposers but are also often omnivores. Arion ater is one such <b>slug,</b> decomposing organic matter, preying on other organisms, and consuming vegetative matter—including agricultural crops. Native to Europe, the black <b>slug</b> is an invasive species in Australia, Canada (British Columbia, Newfoundland, Quebec), and the United States—Pacific Northwest.|$|R
