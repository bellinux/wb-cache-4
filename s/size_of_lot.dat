50|$|In {{real estate}} economics, hedonic pricing {{is used to}} adjust for the {{problems}} associated with researching a good that is as heterogeneous as buildings. Because buildings are so different, it is difficult to estimate the demand for buildings generically. Instead, it is assumed that a house can be decomposed into characteristics such as number of bedrooms, <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>lot,</b> or distance to the city center. A hedonic regression equation treats these attributes (or bundles of attributes) separately, and estimates prices (in the case of an additive model) or elasticity (in the case of a log model) for each of them. This information can be used to construct a price index {{that can be used to}} compare the price of housing in different cities, or to do time series analysis. As with CPI calculations, hedonic pricing can be used to correct for quality changes in constructing a housing price index. It can also be used to assess the value of a property, in the absence of specific market transaction data. It can also be used to analyze the demand for various housing characteristics, and housing demand in general. It has also been used to test assumptions in spatial economics.|$|E

This article presents results of research that has investigated important aspects of this phenomenon.

The environmental significance has been assessed in relation to the literature. Quantitative analyses of examples from older and newer suburban form are presented. They indicate that this is happening irrespective of <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>lot</b> and appears connected with a trend to larger dwellings in relation to the lot area. It represents a loss that has serious ecological implications for the community as a whole, including a significant reduction in biodiversity, sustainable drainage and a beneficent microclimate, in addition to lower standards of domestic amenity. It does not appear that the reduction in size is being required by planning policies. Planning codes, while not actually encouraging the trend, do nothing to prevent it.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{algorithm}} for a real-world job shop-scheduling problem, where both lot-sizing and batching processes are considered. A fuzzy rule-based system is developed for determining lot sizes, where the input variables are workload on the shop floor, <b>size</b> <b>of</b> {{the job and}} its urgency while the output is the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> the <b>lots.</b> Both input and output variables are modelled as linguistic variables with imprecise values represented by using fuzzy sets. A fuzzy multi-objective genetic algorithm is developed to generate schedules of jobs whose processing times and due dates are imprecise and modelled by using fuzzy sets. A genetic algorithm takes into consideration the determined <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>lots</b> for jobs, and considers batching together jobs of similar characteristics {{in order to reduce}} the required setup time. The objectives considered are to minimize average tardiness, number of tardy jobs, setup times, idle times of machines and throughput times of jobs. The developed algorithm is tested on real-world data obtained from a printing company.

5000|$|Mansionization is a {{planning}} issue {{associated with the}} practice of building the largest possible <b>size</b> <b>of</b> home.

Alternatively, it may refer to developments in areas that were formerly open land: in certain areas, building codes have increased the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>lots</b> and therefore commercial pressures lead builders to make the largest possible homes, causing greater ecological damage and resulting in a reduction in affordable housing.

50|$|For {{residential}} properties, suburbanization {{allows for}} home prices to decrease, {{so people can}} drive until they can find {{an area in which}} they can afford to buy a home. However, these homes may lack certain things such as parks and access to public transit. Also, the prices of homes in downtown center usually decreases as well to compete with the inexpensive homes in the suburbs. One of the main benefits of living in the suburbs is that one gets a much larger piece of land than one would in the city. Therefore, as the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>lots</b> increases, the supply of housing is more limited. This is to mean that as city growth patterns increase the population increases leading to suburbanisation which hence leads to the under development of real estate since it is a business.|$|R

40|$|The {{colonization}} {{of land in}} the Amazon region for purposes of agrarian reform, promoted by the government as a social policy throughout history rather than a policy of land redistribution, has caused environmental consequences in various areas of development that need to be further explored.

As a measure of environmental impact, it was assessed the deforestation dynamics in 15 % of federal settlements in the state of Pará for five years. The results showed proportionally more deforestation inside the settlements than in the restricted area. However, the rate of increase in deforestation over the years is lower within the settlements, if we exclude the areas protected by the state. The study points to possible causes that contribute to the trend of deforestation within the settlements.

Since the biddings have already been concluded and their results confirm the arrangement simulated, and since their winners have not proposed any amount bellow the reserve prices, the main conclusion is that competitiveness was put on the jeopardy...|$|R

Using a unique dataset covering water consumption of all residential users in Los Angeles (California) during the drought (1988 - 1992), we show that households generally were responsive to the conservation measures but that the magnitude of households’ responses varies depending on the instrument and on households’ characteristics, in particular the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> their <b>lot.</b> Price elasticity is estimated between – 0. 29 and – 0. 47 in the high season (June-October), and between 0 and – 0. 19 in the low season (November-May).
