60|$|I was the {{attendant}} or page of Queequeg, while busy at the mat. As I kept passing and repassing the filling or woof of marline between the long yarns of the warp, using my own {{hand for the}} shuttle, and as Queequeg, standing sideways, ever and anon slid his heavy oaken sword between the threads, and idly looking off upon the water, carelessly and unthinkingly drove home every yarn; I say so strange a dreaminess did there then reign all over the ship {{and all over the}} sea, only broken by the intermitting dull sound of the sword, that it seemed as if this were the Loom of Time, and I myself were a shuttle mechanically weaving and weaving away at the Fates. There lay the fixed threads of the warp subject to but one single, ever returning, unchanging vibration, and that vibration merely enough to admit of the crosswise interblending of other threads with its own. This warp seemed necessity; and here, thought I, with my own hand I ply my own shuttle and weave my own destiny into these unalterable threads. Meantime, Queequeg's impulsive, indifferent sword, sometimes hitting the woof slantingly, or crookedly, or strongly, or weakly, as the case might be; and by this difference in the concluding blow producing a corresponding contrast in the final aspect of the completed fabric; this savage's sword, thought I, which thus finally shapes and fashions both warp and woof; this easy, indifferent sword must be chance-- aye, chance, free will, and necessity--no wise incompatible-- all interweavingly working together. The <b>straight</b> <b>warp</b> of necessity, not to be swerved from its ultimate course-- its every alternating vibration, indeed, only tending to that; free will still free to ply her shuttle between given threads; and chance, though restrained in its play within the right lines of necessity, and sideways in its motions directed by free will, though thus prescribed to by both, chance by turns rules either, and has the last featuring blow at events.|$|E
40|$|AbstractModelling the {{mechanical}} performance of textile composites is typically based on idealised unit cell geometry. However, 3 D woven composites feature more complex textile architecture then 2 D woven materials, and in reality nominally <b>straight</b> <b>warp</b> and weft yarns can also possess significant waviness. For such textiles, idealising yarns as straight entities becomes an oversimplification. In this study, the voxel method and a continuum damage model {{are used in}} a finite element analysis to compute stress–strain curves for an orthogonal 3 D woven composite under tensile loading. The main goal {{of this study was}} to compare results produced using idealised geometry with realistic geometry obtained from detailed simulation of the preform during weaving and compaction. Significant variation in predictions was obtained using the different geometrical models. The idealised model lead to an overestimation of stiffness and strength compared to experiment due to the neglecting of yarn waviness, whereas the simulated geometry models produced more conservative results closer to experiment...|$|E
40|$|A {{method and}} {{apparatus}} for fabricating straight or curved planar or three-dimensional (C channel, for example) fabric for fabrication into composite structures is presented. In the first embodiment, the fill yarns are inserted between layers of warp yarns, and a canted or curved reed, {{depending on the}} desired orientation of the fill yarns, is used to compact or 'beat-up' the fill yarns. In the second embodiment, the warp yarns of the fabric are curved using a conical {{or a combination of}} conical and cylindrical rollers to effect differential fabric take-up of the warp yarns for obtaining a constant radius of curvature of the warp yarns. In a third embodiment, a clamping bar fabric take-up device is used to effect the differential fabric take-up of the warp yarns for obtaining <b>straight</b> <b>warp</b> yarns, curved warp yarns with a constant radius of curvature, curved warp yarns with a non-contant radius of curvature, or some combinations of straight and curved warp yarns. In a fourth embodiment, for forming the flanges of the curved C channel, the warp yarns are alternately inserted through adjacent dent wires of the reed to permit vertical weaving of the flanges...|$|E

It was submitted to Atlantic Records for the rock band Paramore while Hanson, Marcus and Zumwalt were employed by the label. Hanson has said there was strong resistance to the deal by both label and band {{and that he had}} to fight to make it happen, but believes his efforts were vindicated by the band's subsequent success, saying: [...] "How else would a label have been patient enough to put the band on three <b>straight</b> <b>Warped</b> Tours and down-streamed the band to Fueled By Ramen all while losing millions of dollars?" ...|$|R

40|$|A {{substantial}} {{fraction of}} the warps in spiral galaxies may result from bending instabilities if the disks are essentially self-gravitating. With N-body simulations, we show that galaxies with self-gravitating disks as thick as HI disks are subject to bending instabilities generating S-shaped, U-shaped or asymmetric warps. S-shaped warps persist during several rotations and keep the line of node <b>straight.</b> The <b>warp</b> amplitudes generated by bending instabilities remain however modest. Other factors must be invoked for extreme warped disks. However, bending instabilities can account {{for most of the}} cases reported in optical surveys, where the warp angle is generally less than 5 ^∘. This mode of warping is very sensitive to the disk flattening. It also constrains the fraction of dark matter distributed in the disk and in the dark halo. Comment: 11 pages.

40|$|Abstract The {{manipulation}} of panoramic/wide-angle im-ages is usually achieved via image warping. Though vari-ous techniques {{have been developed}} for preserving shapes and <b>straight</b> lines for <b>warping,</b> these are not sufficient for panoramic/wide-angle images. The image projections will turn the straight lines into curved “geodesic lines”, and it is fundamentally impossible to keep all these lines straight. In this work, we propose a geodesic-preserving method for content-aware image warping. An energy term is intro-duced to preserve the geodesic appearance of the geodesic lines, and can be used with shape-preserving terms. Our method is demonstrated in various applications, including rectangling panoramas, resizing panoramic/wide-angle im-ages, and wide-angle image manipulation. An extension to ellipse preservation for general images is also presented. 1...|$|R
