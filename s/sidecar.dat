5|$|The {{motorcycle}} <b>sidecar</b> missile used in one chase sequence {{was built}} by film staff at Pinewood and used a standard Kawasaki Z900 and a custom made <b>sidecar</b> outfit. The <b>sidecar</b> was made large enough so that a stuntman could lie flat inside. It had two 10 inch scooter wheels on each side, a Suzuki 185 engine and the detached projectile was steered through a small solid rubber wheel at the front. A heavily smoked perspex nose allowed the stuntman sufficient visibility to steer the device whilst being entirely hidden from view. A pincer type lock held the <b>sidecar</b> in place until operated by the pilot via a solenoid switch. The sequences involving the outfit were speeded up as {{the weight of the}} <b>sidecar</b> made the outfit very difficult to control.|$|E
5|$|The {{motorcycles}} used in {{the chase}} from the castle were a mixed bag: the scout model with <b>sidecar</b> in which Indy and Henry escape was an original Dnepr, complete with machine gun pintle on the <b>sidecar,</b> while the pursuing vehicles were more modern machines dressed up with equipment and logos to make them resemble German army models.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{looks at}} the {{phenomenon}} of reinsurance <b>sidecars,</b> {{as an example of}} innovation in cross-sectoral risk transfer between the insurance and the capital markets. It explores the emergence, unfolding and retreat of <b>sidecars</b> in Bermuda with the goal of identifying and establishing key issues shaping how supervisors make sense and act upon innovative industry practices. The paper describes key market and industry features setting the scene for the emergence of <b>sidecars,</b> reviews the literature on <b>sidecars,</b> discusses supervisory challenges <b>sidecars</b> present and explores avenues for addressing these challenges. The paper argues that <b>sidecars</b> offer a fertile ground for better understanding the relationship between industry and supervisors in a context of innovation taking place in a rapidly changing landscape, populated by global players.

5|$|The video's main {{theme is}} a romantic fantasy narrative. It {{begins with a}} montage of pencil {{drawings}} in a comic-book style representing motorcycle <b>sidecar</b> racing, in which the hero, played by Morten Harket, is pursued by two opponents, {{one of whom is}} played by English actor Philip Jackson. It then cuts to a scene in a cafe, in which a young woman, played by Bunty Bailey (Harket's girlfriend at the time), is seen drinking coffee and reading the comic book in a coffee shop. As the woman reads, the waitress brings her the bill. The comic's hero, after winning the race, seemingly winks at the woman from the page. His pencil-drawn hand reaches out of the comic book, inviting the woman into it. Once inside, she too appears in the pencil-drawn form, as he sings to her and introduces her to his black-and-white world which features a sort of looking-glass portal where people and objects look real on one side and pencil-drawn on the other.|$|E
5|$|While {{travelling}} {{by train}} to Stromberg's base in Sardinia, Bond saves Amasova from Jaws, and their cooling rivalry turns to affection. Posing as a marine biologist and his wife, they visit Stromberg's base and discover {{that he had}} launched a mysterious new supertanker, the Liparus, nine months previously. As they leave the base, an unknown henchman on a motorcycle featuring a rocket <b>sidecar,</b> Jaws in a car, and Naomi, an assistant/pilot of Stromberg in an attack helicopter, chase them, but Bond and Amasova escape underwater when his car – a Lotus Esprit from Q Branch – converts into a submarine. Jaws survives a car crash and Naomi is killed when Bond fires a sea-air missile from his car which destroys her helicopter. The pair also encounter a fleet of Stromberg's minisubs which Amasova obliterates by launching mines. Bond finds out that the Liparus has never visited any known port or harbor. Amasova discovers that Bond killed her lover (as shown {{at the beginning of}} the movie), and she vows to kill Bond as soon as their mission is complete.|$|E
