5000|$|Annona squamosa, a {{tree and}} fruit also called sugar apple or <b>sweetsop</b> ...|$|E
50|$|In English, it is {{most widely}} known as a sugar apple or <b>sweetsop</b> {{as well as a}} custard apple, {{especially}} in India and Australia (custard apple also refers to Annona reticulata, a closely related species).|$|E
5000|$|One widely {{cultivated}} magnoliid {{fruit is}} the avocado (Persea americana), which {{is believed to}} have been cultivated in Mexico and Central America for nearly 10,000 years. [...] Now grown throughout the American tropics, it probably originates from the Chiapas region of Mexico or Guatemala, where [...] "wild" [...] avocados may still be found. The soft pulp of the fruit is eaten fresh or mashed into guacamole. The ancient peoples of Central America were also the first to cultivate several fruit-bearing species of Annona. [...] These include the custard-apple (A. reticulata), soursop (A. muricata), <b>sweetsop</b> or sugar-apple (A. squamosa), and the cherimoya (A. cherimola). Both soursop and <b>sweetsop</b> now are widely grown for their fruits in the Old World as well.|$|E
50|$|Annona {{squamosa}} is a small, well-branched tree or shrub {{from the}} family Annonaceae that bears edible fruits called sugar-apples or <b>sweetsops.</b> It tolerates a tropical lowland climate better than its relatives Annona reticulata and Annona cherimola (whose fruits often share the same name) helping make it the most widely cultivated of these species.Annona squamosa is a small, semi-(or late) deciduous, much branched shrub or small tree 3 m to 8 m tallvery similar to soursop (Annona muricata)with a broad, open crown or irregularly spreading branchesand a short trunk short, not buttressed at the base.|$|R
50|$|Fruits in Laos may {{consist of}} watermelon, pineapple, sugar apple, (custard apple or <b>sweetsop),</b> longan, litchi, Asian pear, mango, rose apple (water apple), banana, jackfruit, rambutan, young coconut, orange, sweet tamarind, papaya, durian, sugarcane, pomelo, sapodilla, guava, star apple, mangosteen, melon, santol, langsat, grapes, corossolier (soursop), mak yom, and mak num nom.|$|E
50|$|Asimina triloba, the papaw, pawpaw, paw paw, paw-paw, or common pawpaw, {{is a small}} {{deciduous}} tree {{native to}} the eastern United States and Canada, producing a large, yellowish-green to brown fruit. It belongs to the genus Asimina in the same plant family (the Annonaceae) as the custard-apple, cherimoya, <b>sweetsop,</b> ylang-ylang and soursop.|$|E
50|$|As {{with other}} groups, {{agriculture}} is their prime economic activity. The crops {{vary according to}} the topography of the terrain. For the most part they raise maize, beans, chiles, and squash. Their commercial crops are coffee, cocoa, peppers, bananas, mamey, <b>sweetsop,</b> and guava. The soil is of poor quality, and therefore the output is low. They raise pigs and domesticated fowl in small quantities to augment their diet.|$|E
50|$|Sugar-apple or <b>sweetsop</b> is {{the fruit}} of Annona squamosa, the most widely grown species of Annona and {{a native of the}} {{tropical}} Americas and West Indies. The Spanish traders of Manila galleons brought it to Asia where its old Mexican name ate may still be found in Bengali ata, Nepalese aati, Sinhalese katu atha, Burmese awzar thee, and atis in the Philippines. It is also known as custard apple in India and (mainly Annona reticulata) in the Philippines. The name is also used in Portuguese as ata.|$|E
5000|$|Asimina has large simple {{leaves and}} large fruit. It {{is native to}} eastern North America and collectively {{referred}} to as pawpaw. The genus includes the widespread common pawpaw Asimina triloba, which bears the largest edible fruit indigenous to the continent. Pawpaws are native to 26 states of the U.S. and to Ontario in Canada. The common pawpaw is a patch-forming (clonal) understory tree found in well-drained, deep, fertile bottomland and hilly upland habitat. Pawpaws {{are in the same}} plant family (Annonaceae) as the custard-apple, cherimoya, <b>sweetsop,</b> ylang-ylang and soursop; [...] the genus is the only member of that family not confined to the tropics.|$|E
50|$|Slightly {{over half}} of the watercolors show apple cultivars, a good many of which are no longer cultivated. The {{remainder}} range from common types of fruits and nuts (grapes, berries, stone fruit, melons, citrus, walnuts, hickory nuts) to lesser-known native fruits (Eastern shadbush) and species newly introduced in the United States or not yet grown there: cherimoya, avocado, natal plum, <b>sweetsop,</b> etc. The specimens depicted were collected throughout the United States and its territories and in nearly 30 other countries as well. The typical watercolor in the collection depicts the whole fruit (sometimes with its leaves) together with a half-view showing its flesh and seeds; some show the fruit in a diseased state.|$|E
50|$|Some notable Hawaiian fare {{includes}} seared ahi tuna, opakapaka (snapper) with passionfruit, Hawaiian island-raised lamb, {{beef and}} meat products, Hawaiian plate lunch, and Molokai shrimp. Seafood traditionally is caught fresh in Hawaiian waters, and particular delicacies are ula poni, papaikualoa, ‘opihi, and ‘opihi malihini, {{better known as}} Hawaiian spiny lobster, Kona crab, Hawaiian limpet, and abalone, the last brought over with Japanese immigrants. Some cuisine also incorporates a broad variety of produce and locally grown agricultural products, including tomatoes, sweet Maui onions, taro, and macadamia nuts. Tropical fruits equally {{play an important role}} in the cuisine as a flavoring in cocktails and in desserts, including local cultivars of bananas, <b>sweetsop,</b> mangoes, lychee, coconuts, papayas, and lilikoi (passionfruit). Pineapples have been an island staple since the 19th century and figure into many marinades and drinks.|$|E
5000|$|The large, edible, pulpy {{fruits of}} some members {{typically}} called anona by Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking {{people of the}} family's Neotropical range, include species of Annona: custard apple (A. reticulata), cherimoya (A. cherimola), soursop/guanábana/graviola (A. muricata), <b>sweetsop</b> (A. squamosa), ilama (A. diversifolia), soncoya (A. purpurea), atemoya (a cross between A. cherimola and A. squamosa); and biriba (Rollinia deliciosa, which may require reclassification under Annona.). The names of many of those fruits are sometimes used interchangeably. Recently, consumption of the neotropical annonaceous plant Annona muricata (soursop, graviola, guanabana) has been strongly associated as a causal agent in [...] "atypical Parkinsonism". The causative agent, annonacin, is present {{in many of the}} Annonaceae. It is thought to be responsible for up to 70% of Parkinsonian conditions in Guadeloupe. Exposure is typically through traditional food and natural medicines.|$|E
50|$|Certain {{portions}} of the South often have their own distinct subtypes of cuisine owing to local history and landscape: though Cajun cuisine is more famous, Floridian cuisine, for example, has a distinct way of cooking that includes ingredients her other Southern sisters do not use, especially points south of Tampa and Orlando. The Spanish Crown had {{control of the state}} until the early 19th century and used the southern tip as an outpost to guard the Spanish Main beginning in the 1500s, but Florida kept and still maintains ties with the Caribbean Sea, including the Bahamas Haiti, Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and Jamaica. South of Tampa, there are and have been for a long time many speakers of Caribbean Spanish, Haitian French, Jamaican Patois, and Haitian Creole and each Caribbean culture has a strong hold on cooking methods and spices in Florida. In turn, each mixes and matches with the foodways of the Seminole tribe and Anglophone settlers. Thus, for almost 200 years, Floridian cooking has had a more tropical flavor than any other Southern state. Allspice, a spice originally from Jamaica, is an ingredient found in spice mixes in summer barbecues along with ginger, garlic, scotch bonnet peppers, sea salt, and nutmeg; in Floridian cooking this is often a variant of Jamaican jerk spice. Coconuts are grown in the areas surrounding Miami and are shipped in daily through its port for consumption of the milk, meat, and water of the coconut. Bananas are not just the yellow Cavendish variety found in supermarkets across America: in Florida they are available as bananitos, colorados, plátanos, and maduros. The first of these is a tiny miniature banana only about 4-5 inches (10-13 cm) in length and it is sweet. The second has a red peel and an apple like after taste, and the third and fourth are used as a starch on nearly every Caribbean island as a side dish, baked or fried: all of the above are a staple of Florida outdoor markets when in season and all have been grown in the Caribbean for almost 400 years. Mangoes are grown as a backyard plant in Southern Florida and otherwise are a favorite treat coming in many different shapes in sizes from Nam Doc Mai, brought to Florida after the Vietnam War, to Madame Francis, a mango from Haiti. <b>Sweetsop</b> and soursop are popular around Miami, but nearly unheard of {{in other areas of the}} South.|$|E
40|$|Starch {{from the}} fruits of <b>sweetsop</b> (Anonna squamosa) and soursop (Anonna muricata) were {{isolated}} and purified and the fat, ash, phosphorus and protein contents measured. The amount of amylose present was determined spectrophotometrically and found to be very similar (19 %) for both starches. Scanning electron microscopy showed very small indented and spherical granules from both with an average granule size of 4. 84 μm and 4. 72 μm, respectively. The physicochemical properties, namely the swelling power, solubility, pasting characteristics, paste clarity and freeze–thaw stability were studied to assess the functionality of the starch pastes as hydrocolloids. The <b>sweetsop</b> starch showed higher swelling power and solubility compared to soursop starch and had a lower gelatinization temperature indicating a weaker granular structure. <b>Sweetsop</b> starch exhibited a lower pasting temperature, higher viscosity peak, higher viscosity breakdown and lower setback, higher paste clarity and freeze–thaw stability compared to soursop starch. The low gelatinization temperature and high freeze thaw stability of <b>sweetsop</b> starch are {{comparable to that of}} waxy corn. The properties of <b>sweetsop</b> indicate that it has potential for application as a thickener in frozen foods...|$|E
40|$|A partir de folhas, caules e raízes de plantas de pinha e graviola coletadas em Pernambuco foram obtidos 110 e 90 isolados fúngicos endofíticos, respectivamente. Vinte e nove isolados foram selecionados e avaliados quanto à produção de enzimas extracelulares, através do método qualitativo em placas com meios sólidos específicos, e à capacidade de estimular o crescimento de mudas de pinha. Esses isolados foram identificados como pertencentes aos gêneros Acremonium (10, 34 %), Aspergillus (3, 45 %), Chaetomium (3, 45 %), Colletotrichum (10, 34 %), Cylindrocladium (13, 8 %), Fusarium (31, 03 %), Glomerella (3, 45 %), Nigrospora (6, 9 %), Penicillium (6, 9 %) e Phomopsis (10, 34 %). Dezenove isolados apresentaram atividade lipolítica, cinco atividade proteolítica e nenhum deles atividades celulolítica ou amilolítica. Onze isolados dos gêneros Acremonium (GFR 6 e GRR 1), Colletotrichum (GFR 4 e PFR 4), Phomopsis (PFR 3 e GCR 4), Cylindrocladium (GRR 4), Chaetomium (GRR 7) e Fusarium (GRR 5, PRR 1 e PRR 6) promoveram eficientemente o crescimento vegetal. Os índices de aumento da biomassa seca da parte aérea de mudas de pinha variou de 23, 2 a 32, 7 %, sendo que nenhum isolado promoveu a biomassa seca da raiz. Destaca-se também que 20 isolados apresentaram efeito deletério significativo (P = 0, 05) na biomassa seca da raiz das mudas de pinha. Em tecidos aparentemente sadios de plantas de pinha e graviola são encontrados alguns fungos que podem promover o crescimento da parte aérea, como também reduzir o crescimento da raiz e outros sem efeito no crescimento de mudas de pinha. Endophytic {{isolates}} of fungi {{were obtained}} from leaves, stems and roots of 110 <b>sweetsop</b> and 90 soursop plants from Pernambuco. Twenty-nine isolates were analyzed for production of extracellular enzymes by qualitative assay in Petri dishes containing specific solid media, and for the capacity to promote growth of <b>sweetsop</b> seedlings. These isolates were identified as Acremonium (10. 34 %), Aspergillus (3. 45 %), Chaetomium (3. 45 %), Colletotrichum (10. 34 %), Cylindrocladium (13. 8 %), Fusarium (31. 03 %), Glomerella (3. 45 %), Nigrospora (6. 9 %), Penicillium (6. 9 %) and Phomopsis (10. 34 %). Nineteen isolates showed lypolytic activity while five showed proteolytic activity; cellulolytic and amylolytic activity were not detected. Eleven isolates of the genera Acremonium (GFR 6 and GRR 1), Colletotrichum (GFR 4 and PFR 4), Phomopsis (PFR 3 and GCR 4), Cylindrocladium (GRR 4), Chaetomium (GRR 7) and Fusarium (GRR 5, PRR 1 and PRR 6) efficiently improved plant growth. Increase in shoot dry matter of <b>sweetsop</b> seedlings ranged from 23. 2 to 32. 7 %; there was no increase in root dry matter. It is worthy of note that 20 isolates caused significant (P = 0. 05) reduction in root dry matter of <b>sweetsop</b> seedlings. In apparently healthy tissues of <b>sweetsop</b> and soursop plants, some fungi promote shoot growth or reduce root growth, while others {{have no effect on}} growth of <b>sweetsop</b> seedlings...|$|E
40|$|Este estudo teve por objetivo avaliar o uso de diferentes invólucros nos frutos de atemoieira e pinheira na qualidade físico-química dos frutos e na incidência da broca-dos-frutos, Cerconota anonella. Os experimentos foram instalados em dois pomares comerciais: um de atemoieira no município de Matias Cardoso e outro de pinheira no município de Verdelândia, Norte de Minas Gerais. Os tratamentos para a atemoieira consistiram em: 1) Testemunha (sem ensacamento); 2) Saco plástico leitoso; 3) Saco de TNT (tecido-não-tecido) branco sem fundo e 4) Saco de TNT branco com fundo. Para a pinheira foi modificado apenas o tratamento 2 para saco de papel pardo. Avaliaram-se número de dias da polinização à colheita, número de dias da colheita ao amadurecimento, ocorrência de injúrias e brocas e características físico-químicas dos frutos. Observam-se maior número de dias entre a colheita e o amadurecimento e mais firmeza nos frutos de pinheira não-ensacados. O uso do plástico leitoso controlou a broca em frutos de atemoieira. As características físico-químicas: massa, comprimento, diâmetro dos frutos e teor de sólidos solúveis totais da polpa não foram influenciados pelo uso dos invólucros. This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the effect from using different involucres for fruits of the atemoya and <b>sweetsop</b> upon either physiochemical quality of the fruits and incidence of the fruit borer Cerconota anonella. The experiments were set up in two commercial orchards: one with atemoya at Matias Cardoso county and the other one with <b>sweetsop</b> at Verdelândia on northern Minas Gerais state. The treatments for atemoya consisted of: 1) Control (without bagging); 2) Milky plastic bag; 3) White, bottomless, tissue-non-tissue (TNT) bag; and (4) With bottom TNT bag. For the <b>sweetsop,</b> only treatment 2 was modified to brown paper bag. The following evaluation were performed: the number of days from pollination to harvest, number of days from harvest to ripening, occurrence of injuries and borers, and the physiochemical characteristics of the fruits. The no-bagged <b>sweetsop</b> fruits showed higher number of days between the harvest and ripening and higher firmness. The use of the milky plastic controlled the borer in atemoya fruits. The following physiochemical characteristics were not affected by the use of those involucres: weight, length, fruit diameters, and the content of the total soluble solids in the pulp...|$|E
40|$|Avaliou-se os efeitos do processo utilizado na obtenção de polpa de frutas congelada sobre o teor de fibras alimentares, empregando-se acerola, caju, goiaba, graviola, manga, pinha, pitanga, sapoti e uva no estágio maduro. Demonstrou-se que o processo tecnológico empregado reduziu significativamente o percentual de fibras alimentares das frutas, determinadas por método gravimétrico não enzimático, principalmente da goiaba, seguida da uva, graviola, sapoti, caju, pinha e acerola; com exceção da manga e pitanga, as demais polpas congeladas não substituem, em termos quantitativos, a fibra alimentar dos frutos in natura na dieta de indivíduos sadios. Considerando que essas perdas são variáveis face às características dos frutos processados, a inclusão de polpas congeladas na dieta em substituição às frutas dependerá de estudos qualitativos que permitam esclarecer os constituintes da referida fração. The {{effects of}} the process {{utilized}} to obtain frozen fruit pulp {{on the quality of}} dietary fibers were evaluated, using ripe samples of acerola, cashew, guava, soursop, mango, <b>sweetsop,</b> pitanga, sapoti and grapes. The results obtained showed that the technological process used reduced significantly the fiber percentual of the fruit, determined by gravimetric non-ensymatic method particularly the guava, followed by the grapes, soursop, saoti, cashew, <b>sweetsop</b> and acerola. With the exception of mango and pitanga, all the frozen pulps tested do not seem to substitute, in terms of quantity of dietary fiber, the in natura fruit in the diet of healthy individuals. Considering the fact that these losses are variable, depending on the characteristics of the fruit which was processed, the inclusion of frozen pulps in the human diet in substitution to fruits will depend on quality control studies which may lead to a classification of the components of the mentioned fraction...|$|E
40|$|The mite Tetranychus mexicanus (McGregor) is {{considered}} a pest {{of a variety of}} plant species in the Americas. Although this mite apparently causes economic damage to Annonaceae, little is known about its biology Here we studied the biology of T. mexicanus on soursop (Annona muricata), <b>sweetsop</b> (Annona squamosa) and araticum (Annona coriaceae). The first two species are the most important economical Annonaceae species in northeast Brazil; araticum is commonly found in the region, but not commercially explored. The mites were collected in the field from leaves of A. muricata and maintained in the laboratory for six months on detached leaves of A. muricata, A. squamosa and A. coriaceae, respectively, before observations started. Tetranychus mexicanus developed more slowly on A. squamosa than on the two other hosts, but oviposition was considerably lower on A. coriaceae. As indicated by the calculated life table parameters, biotic potential was higher on A. muricata than on the other hosts.

40|$|O Brasil tem grande importância no mercado de frutas; porém há escassez de dados acerca da composição das frutas tropicais brasileiras, principalmente daquelas produzidas no nordeste. No presente estudo, determinaram-se macro e microminerais de 11 frutas tropicais cultivadas no nordeste brasileiro: abacaxi, ata, graviola, jaca, mamão, mangaba, murici, sapoti, seriguela, tamarindo e umbu. As amostras foram desidratadas e mineralizadas em HNO 3 /HClO 4 (3 : 1). Os minerais Ca, Mg, Mn, Zn, Fe, Co, Se e Ni foram analisados por espectrofotometria de absorção atômica, Na e K por fotometria de chama e P por método colorimétrico. Os resultados indicaram que o tamarindo pode ser considerado {{excelente}} fonte de Mg, Cu e K; além de boa fonte em Ca, P, Fe e Se. Dentre os minerais avaliados nas frutas estudadas, K apresentou o maior conteúdo, seguido pelo Ca e Mg. Ata, graviola, sapoti e murici são boas fontes de dois ou mais minerais. Correlações elevadas foram obtidas entre K e os minerais P, Co e Fe; e entre Co e Fe. Portanto, sugere-se o consumo dos frutos tropicais estudados, como auxiliares na reposição de nutrientes minerais.

In order to further supply information on the antibacterial and antioxidant activity of these three tropic fruits, they were extracted by 80 % methanol. We then examined the extractions about their phenolic compounds and also studied the extractions and phenolic contents about their minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) against twelve targeted pathogens including 8 standard strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Monilia albican, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and 4 multidrug-resistant strains (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, ESBLs-producing Escherichia coli, carbapenems-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii), which are common and comprehensive in clinic. We also employed two ways, that is, FRAP and TEAC, to evaluate their antioxidant activities, using ultraviolet and visible spectrophotometer. Our study indicated that the three tropical fruits possessed obvious antioxidant and antibacterial activity, which supported the possibility of developing the fruits into new natural resource food and functional food as well as new natural antimicrobial agent and food preservatives.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{characterize}} the soil macrofauna under different crop systems and compare them to the macrofauna under the native vegetation of a Cerrado/Caatinga ecotone in southwestern Piauí State, Brazil. The areas studied included areas under <b>sweetsop</b> cultivation (Annona squamosa L.), andropogon grass with three years of use, andropogon grass with six years of use, pivot-irrigated corn, Napier grass, and native vegetation. In each area, soil layers of 0 - 0. 1, 0. 1 - 0. 2, and 0. 2 - 0. 3 m, including the surface litter, were evaluated following the Tropical Soil Biology and Fertility Program (TSBF) recommendations. The soil macrofauna from the different land-use systems were identified to the family level, and the mean density of each taxon was calculated for each soil-management type and layer. The structure of the soil macrofauna was negatively altered under the different crops in comparison to the native Cerrado/Caatinga vegetation, with macrofaunal occurrence varying in the different soil layers. A correlation existed between the functional groups and the soil grain-size distribution and moisture. Napier grass cultivation favored greater soil macrofaunal abundance, with a predominance of families belonging to the orders Isoptera and Hymenoptera. Number of soil macrofaunal families under pivot-irrigated corn was more like the number observed with the native vegetation, and corn also had greater family diversity compared to the other crops studied. Therefore, pivot-irrigated corn can reduce the impact of anthropogenic land use on the diversity of soil macrofauna...|$|E
40|$|Tree species Asimina triloba (L.) Dunal, is {{native to}} North America. In the area of origin is cultivated, both as food species because the edible fruit, and as {{ornamental}} species. Ornamental value derives both from decorative flowers, that open in early spring, and because habitus species. The species is demanding from slightly acidic soils (pH 5. 5 to 7. 0) and well drained. Seedlings are susceptible to heatstroke and need areas of the sun, but since the second year, vegetate well in bright light conditions [27]. Optimum climate is temperate to subtropical one. The species exhibits unique quality traits for a temperate fruit {{that are similar to}} other fruit in the Annonaceae family, including cherimoya (Annona cherimola Mill.), sugar apple or <b>sweetsop,</b> (A. squamosa L.), soursop (A. muricata L.), custard apple (A. reticulata L.), and atemoya (A. squamosa X A. cherimola), all of which are tropical [2]. This study follows the behavior of the species, in particular conditions of the Baia Mare and its surroundings. In this area a fewindividuals were introduced, in order to diversigy the range of species of ornamental plants. In Baia Mare, topoclimate is specifically depression, sheltered by mountains, more atenuated as temperature and winds, than in surrounding areas. As a result ofclimatic conditions, chestnut Castanea sativa, grows in good conditions in Baia Mare. Instead, the area is heavily polluted,especially at ground level. Pollution by heavy metals is a historical being generated by the mining industry. The introduction and use of a new plant species into a new area involves: 1. easy to obtain seed; 2. - maintaining the crown shape habitus and and leaf shape and size, respectively; 3 – determination of optimal physiological parameters.

40|$|O estudo teve como finalidade avaliar a propagação de duas espécies de anonáceas (atemoia e araticum). A atemoia é um híbrido que possui características organolépticas muito apreciadas no mundo e é mais intensamente produzida em pomares na Austrália, Israel, Estados Unidos e Brasil. O araticum ou marolo é uma espécie nativa do Cerrado, apreciada localmente no Centro-Oeste e coletada extrativamente para comercialização em feiras e ruas das cidades desta região. O trabalho foi dividido em dois capítulos, o primeiro, enxertia de atemoia Thompson sobre dois porta-enxertos do gênero Rollinia e o segundo, enxertia de araticum sobre 4 porta-enxertos de anonáceas. O Capítulo I avalia a eficiência de dois porta-enxertos (Rollinia sp. e Rollinia mucosa) e dois métodos de enxertia (inglês simples e fenda lateral). Os parâmetros avaliados foram: índice de sobrevivência dos enxertos, comprimento de ramo {{principal}} e número de folhas aos 60, 75, 90 e 105 dias após a enxertia. O porta-enxerto araticum-de-terra-fria apresentou melhores resultados que o biribá, com índice de sobrevivência de 82, 5 % e 35 % respectivamente. O melhor método de enxertia para araticum-de-terra-fria foi o inglês simples com índice de sobrevivência de 90 %. O Capítulo II foi organizado em 5 experimentos para avaliação de diferentes métodos de enxertia e porta-enxertos para a propagação do araticum. O Experimento I consistiu em avaliar a habilidade e eficiência de dois enxertadores para a condução dos experimentos seguintes, quanto ao índice de sobrevivência dos enxertos, onde não foi encontrada significância estatística em nenhuma época de avaliação para o parâmetro avaliado. Nos Experimentos II, III, IV e V foi realizada a enxertia do araticum através de 5 métodos (fenda lateral, fenda cheia, inglês simples, inglês complicado e sub-casca), sobre porta-enxertos de graviola, condessa, araticum-de-terra-fria e biribá de diferentes idades. Em todos os experimentos foi avaliado o índice de sobrevivência e submetidos à análise de variância. Os experimentos de enxertia do araticum sobre 4 porta-enxertos, abrangendo 5 tipos de enxertia e totalizando 500 plantas enxertadas, mostraram que há incompatibilidade na enxertia desta planta, pois somente 3 enxertos sobreviveram. As possíveis causas da incompatibilidade foram investigadas através de estudos anatômicos e histoquímicos, através da análise do material proveniente dos experimentos com o uso dos porta-enxertos graviola, araticum-de-terra-fria e biribá. Identificou-se nos estudos diferença anatômica e presença de compostos fenólicos na região da enxertia. ________________________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTThis {{paper has}} {{the purpose of}} studying the propagation of two species of Annonaceae (atemoya and araticum). The two species chosen for this research have morphological affinities, but they also present many different features. Atemoya is a hybrid which has excellent flavor characteristics appreciated {{all around the world}} and it is grown mostly in Australia, Israel, United States and Brazil. The araticum is a native species of the Brazilian savannah, the Cerrado, and it is consumed locally in the central west region, and commercialized in local markets. A common element between these two species is the lack of propagation studies, to which the results of this research are a contribution. It is well known that grafting is a method of vegetative propagation which, besides cloning and rescuing interesting genotypes exhibits, has some advantages such as root disease resistance, trunk borer resistance, as well as inducing desirable characteristics to the canopy. This work was divided in two chapters. The first one was about atemoya Thompson grafting with two methods (side cleft graft and whip graft) onto two rootstocks (Rollinia mucosa e Rollinia sp.). The analyzed parameters were: graft survival rate, main branch length and leaf number at 60, 75, 90 and 105 days after grafting. The atemoya grafting experiment proved the efficiency of the araticum-de-terra-fria rootstock and the unviability of atemoya grafting onto the biribá rootstock (wild <b>sweetsop).</b> Chapter II was organized into 5 experiments for the evaluation of different grafting methods and rootstocks for araticum propagation. Experiment I assessed and compared the ability and efficiency of two grafters. For this experiment it was necessary to conduct the following procedures: The grafts survival rate was compared through an F test but no statistical significance was found in any procedure. In Experiment II, three grafting methods (side cleft, whip graft, whip and tongue graft) were used for araticum grafting onto soursop rootstocks, age 12 and 24 months. In Experiment III, three grafting methods (cleft, whip and whip and tongue) were evaluated for araticum grafting onto araticum-de-terra-fria rootstocks, age 9 and 21 months. The survival rate of the grafts was assessed at 60 days after grafting. In Experiment IV, four grafting methods were tested (cleft, whip graft, sub-shell and side cleft), with randomized blocks design, with 5 blocks, 5 replicates, 8 plants per parcel, totaling 200 plants. In Experiment V, two grafting methods (cleft and whip graft) were evaluated in 2 rootstocks (soursop and custard apple). The survival rate was assessed at 30 days after grafting. All the grafting experiments on 4 rootstocks, including 5 types of grafting and 500 grafted plants, have shown that araticum has grafting incompatibility, because only 3 grafts survived. Possible causes for this problem were investigated through histochemical and anatomical studies and through grafting tissue analysis from experiments of soursop, biriba (wild sweepsop) and araticum-de-terra-fria. Boards and tables record the results. It was identified anatomical differences and phenolic compounds at the graft union. Alternatives are suggested for overcoming the incompatibility in the araticum grafting, which until now has not produced viable plants of this species with the method here employed...|$|E
