5|$|Beginning on 19 February 1971, {{the court}} heard reports from Harrison, John Lennon and Ringo <b>Starr</b> of McCartney's {{attempts}} to control the band, and McCartney's equally unflattering assessment of Klein. Although the other three former Beatles had presented a united front against McCartney since his April 1970 departure from the band, the recent publication of Lennon's scathing comments to Rolling Stone editor Jann Wenner, about McCartney, Harrison and <b>Starr,</b> added to the ill-feeling surrounding the group.|$|E

5000|$|Notable as {{the most}} {{successful}} protest song to become a pop hit, earning compliments from contemporary protester John Lennon, [...] "War" [...] became Edwin <b>Starr's</b> signature song. Rather than hindering his career (as it might have done for the Temptations), [...] "War" [...] buoyed <b>Starr's</b> career, and he adopted {{the image of an}} outspoken liberal orator for many of his other early-1970s releases, including the similarly themed [...] "Stop the War Now" [...] from 1971. It and another 1971 single, [...] "Funky Music Sho' 'Nuff Turns Me On", continued <b>Starr's</b> string of Whitfield-produced psychedelic soul hits. After 1971, <b>Starr's</b> career began to falter, and, citing Motown's reliance on formulas, he departed the label in the mid-1970s.|$|R

5|$|In 1998, <b>Starr</b> {{released}} two albums on the Mercury label. The studio album Vertical Man {{marked the}} beginning of a nine-year partnership with Mark Hudson, who produced the album and, with his band the Roundheads, formed the core of the backing group on the recordings. In addition, many famous guests joined on various tracks, including Martin, Petty, McCartney and, in his final appearance on a <b>Starr</b> album, Harrison. Most of the songs were written by <b>Starr</b> and the band. Joe Walsh and the Roundheads joined <b>Starr</b> for his appearance on VH1 Storytellers, which was released as an album under the same name. During the show, he performed greatest hits and new songs and told anecdotes relating to them. Starr's final release for Mercury was the 1999 Christmas-themed I Wanna Be Santa Claus.

5|$|Shortly before McCartney's {{announcement}} in April 1970, he and <b>Starr</b> fell out due to McCartney's refusal to cede the release date of his eponymous solo album {{to allow for}} Starr's debut, Sentimental Journey, and the Beatles' Let It Be. Starr's album – composed of renditions of pre-rock standards that included musical arrangements by Quincy Jones, Maurice Gibb, George Martin and McCartney – peaked at number seven in the UK and number 22 in the US. <b>Starr</b> followed Sentimental Journey with the country-inspired Beaucoups of Blues, engineered by Scotty Moore and featuring renowned Nashville session musician Pete Drake.
