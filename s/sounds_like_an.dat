And {{so we wanted to}} use that kind of sound, but we didn't have a tack piano, so rather than sample it, we went and bought an old piano from the shop up the road from our studio, and we bought a load of tacks, and me and Guy and Jon spent a couple of hours pushing tacks into the piano hammers.|$|E
500|$|Upon release, A Rush of Blood to the Head {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} from contemporary critics. Review aggregating website Metacritic reports a normalised score of 80 based on 25 reviews. Many {{felt that it}} built upon their previous album, Parachutes. Alexis Petridis of the newspaper The Guardian wrote that the band's [...] "new assurance is everywhere... the timidity of Parachutes {{is nowhere to be}} found". He concludes, [...] "It <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> album ready to take on the world, and win." ...|$|E
500|$|Bobby Edner's {{portrayal}} of Vaan has been met with mostly positive reception. Cavin Smith praised his acting, stating that he <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> actual teenager without sounding whiny. Agustin praised the developers for giving Vaan a voice actor, commenting that it prevents any awkward silences from a silent protagonist. He added however that Vaan is [...] "decidedly quiet", owing {{to many of}} the conversations not requiring his input, which Agustin called a [...] "brilliant interactive storytelling device". His design change from Final Fantasy XII to Revenant Wings was criticized by RPGFan editor Patrick Gann, for going from a teenage design to {{what appears to be the}} design of a 10-year-old Vaan.|$|E

500|$|New {{character}} Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) {{prepares for}} a book club meeting in a modern suburban home. The club is in a heated discussion of Stephen King's Carrie, when they are interrupted by what <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> earthquake. The group leaves Juliet's house and Ben Linus (Michael Emerson), previously known as [...] "Henry Gale" [...] to the survivors, appears along with Ethan Rom (William Mapother), looking up to watch Oceanic Flight 815 break apart in mid-air. Ben quickly orders Goodwin (Brett Cullen) and Ethan to join the survivors, stay undercover, and provide [...] "lists in three days." [...] The camera zooms out to reveal that the suburb is actually on the Island and is inhabited by The Others, while in the background the smoke trail of the midsection and tail section of Flight 815 can be seen.|$|E
500|$|... "Bye Bye Baby" [...] is a hip hop {{and dance}} song which {{begins with the}} declaration, [...] "This is not a love song". A low bass is heard against a high-pitched 1960s {{keyboard}} sound. Madonna's vocals were attenuated to sound much thinner with more treble. Guitar sounds are spread throughout occasionally with shouting voices being heard in the background. The song ends {{with the sound of}} an explosion. Madonna's filtered voice <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> answering machine; the final line, [...] "You fucked it up", is bleeped out like the machine's end-of-message tone. According to the sheet music published by Alfred Publishing Inc., the song is set in the time signature of common time with a fast tempo of 120 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of F minor, with Madonna's voice in a high register, spanning between F3 to A4. The song has a basic sequence of G–B–G–D–G–Dm as its chord progression.|$|E
500|$|... "Missing You" [...] {{received}} generally {{negative comments}} from the critics, who criticised the use of Auto-Tuned vocals and said that [...] "the production was lacking, making the choice to release it is a single confusing. with] some terrible autotone ... and a trance-y backdrop that never quite reaches the places it promises." [...] Tony Falls of Virgin Media was also {{highly critical of the}} song awarding it zero out of ten. [...] "Never have a group got by with so little a contribution to music, but so big a contribution to rolling back feminist progress. 'Missing You' <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> album track. Not something you’d hear as a comeback track that would uplift your lost consciousness about the girls’ disappearance. The idea of shooting the video in Spain for this type of song is a nice choice, but Frankie is overly tanned. Please kill me. A vacuous set of reviews for a vacuous group of girls." ...|$|E

[...] Stylus Magazine writer Nick Southall recognised Hebden's [...] "perpetual evolution and motion," [...] declaring that [...] "this is simply a great record of beautiful music." [...] Robert Christgau's review of Rounds for the Village Voice argued that Hebden [...] "imagines an aural space in which electronic malfunction is cute rather than annoying or ominous," [...] using [...] "the computer as music box." [...] Tom Ridge of The Wire stated that [...] "nothing here <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> exercise in genre plundering," [...] and that [...] "Hebden has devised a musical identity that is distinctly different from his work with Fridge, but both projects share a passion for defying boundaries." ...|$|E
500|$|After leaving Connecticut on a Sunday {{morning in}} 2007 for Monday Night Football in Pittsburgh, Scott had a {{stomachache}}. After the stomachache worsened, {{he went to}} the hospital instead of the game and later had his appendix removed. After testing the appendix, doctors learned that he had cancer. Two days later, he had surgery in New York that removed part of his colon and some of his lymph nodes near the appendix. After the surgery, they recommended preventive chemotherapy. By December, Scott—while undergoing chemotherapy—hosted Friday night ESPN NBA coverage and led the coverage of ABC's NBA Christmas Day studio show. Scott worked out while undergoing chemotherapy. Scott said of his experience with cancer at the time: [...] "One of the coolest things about having cancer, and I know that <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> oxymoron, is meeting other people who've had to fight it. You have a bond. It's like a fraternity or sorority." [...] When Scott returned to work and people knew of his cancer diagnosis, the well-wishers felt overbearing for him as he just wanted to talk about sports, not cancer.|$|E

Kirkus Reviews finds [...] "old {{fashioned}} wisdom" [...] in the book, and calls it [...] "a slim volume packed with nourishing nuggets of wisdom". Reviewer Karen Algeo Krizman says that [...] "Angelou delivers with her signature passion and fire" [...] and that although the essays are [...] "easy to take in during brief moments of quiet", they have a powerful message. Laura L. Hutchison of The Fredicksburg Free Lance-Star states that Letter is [...] "written in Angelou's beautiful, poetic style" [...] and called the essays [...] "advice from a beloved aunt or grandmother, whose wisdom you know was earned". Hutchinson also stated that the book would gain Angelou new readers, and that her current audience would read and reread it. Psychologists Eranda Jayawickreme and Marie J. C. Forgearda called the essays in Letter to My Daughter [...] "illuminating" [...] and {{used it as a}} non-scientific, interdisciplinary textto teach positive psychology.|$|E

500|$|According to Mark Redfern of Under the Radar, Blur eschewed Britpop {{in favour}} of American indie rock. NME {{magazine}} similarly argued that it favoured lo-fi and alternative rock over Britpop. By contrast, Margaret Moser of The Austin Chronicle characterised its music as [...] "a punchy brand of muscular Brit-pop", while AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine said it [...] "may superficially {{appear to be a}} break from tradition" [...] but is a [...] "logical progression" [...] from Britpop rather than an abandonment of it. Album opener [...] "Beetlebum" [...] {{has been described as a}} [...] "Beatles tribute" [...] by several publications; Erlewine wrote that the song [...] " [...] through the White Album in the space of five minutes." [...] Q magazine's Andrew Collins compared the song to The Auteurs as well as a [...] "slightly menacing Free as a Bird", due to [...] "a slight drone undulating in the foreground" [...] and a [...] "sweet, elongated coda busied by what <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> invasion of turkeys." [...] Albarn admitted that [...] "Beetlebum" [...] was about heroin and the drug experiences he had with his then-girlfriend, Justine Frischmann of Elastica. Albarn also stated that the song describes a complicated emotion, sort of [...] "sleepy" [...] and sort of [...] "sexy". The song's title is a reference to the phrase [...] "Chasing the beetle" [...] which refers to inhaling the smoke from heated heroin, morphine, or opium that has been placed on a piece of tin-foil. [...] "Song 2" [...] is notable for its hook which features Albarn yelling [...] "woo-hoo!" [...] The song's intro has been called Coxon's [...] "finest moment." ...|$|E
500|$|Rich Juzwiak of The Village Voice complimented [...] "I Was Here" [...] as {{knocking}} {{harder than}} anything on 4s [...] "bloated predecessor", I Am ... Sasha Fierce (2008). Similarly, Embling of Tiny Mix Tapes wrote: [...] "'I Was Here' {{is a heavy}} brick of a song — overwrought, maudlin, delusionally grandiose — {{but it is also}} disarmingly honest about the addictive, undignified dimensions of fame and celebrity." [...] Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club described [...] "I Was Here" [...] as [...] "uncomfortably overwrought" [...] although he said that Beyoncé manages to bring conviction to its lyrical content. Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly also gave the song a mixed review stating that it reached a [...] "lifetime-movie levels of schmaltz". David Amidon of PopMatters stated that [...] "I Was Here" [...] is [...] "plain awkward to here a woman as in her prime physically as Beyoncé is to even approach such a tune. The dull music from Ryan Tedder and an army of co-producers does not help matters." [...] Michael Cragg of The Observer gave the song a negative review, stating that it disappoints as being [...] "corny bluster at odds with the laid-back feel of her most accomplished album yet." [...] Andy Gill of The Independent simply stated that [...] "I Was Here" [...] strains too hard for [...] "Empire State of Mind" [...] (2009) status. Greg Kot of Chicago Tribune described the song as a [...] "toxic string of cliches". Hamish MacBain of NME gave [...] "I Was Here" [...] a mixed review stating the song <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> X-Factor winner's single, full of unbelievably trite sentiments.|$|E
500|$|A Love Surreal {{received}} widespread acclaim from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 82, based on 11 reviews. AllMusic's Andy Kellman said Bilal had improved {{as a producer}} and songwriter while remaining [...] "supernaturally skilled and creative" [...] as a vocalist, [...] "swooping, diving, wailing, and sighing, all with complete command." [...] Paste magazine's Evan Rytlewski said [...] "for {{the first time in}} his career, Bilal no longer <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> artist with entirely too much to prove; he's just a great singer, backed by great players he puts to good use on a set of sticky, deceptively inventive songs". Writing for NPR, Ann Powers said that A Love Surreal [...] "cultivates the stratospheric vibe" [...] of Coltrane's A Love Supreme while Bilal's ambition is [...] "grounded in fierce intelligence and a commitment to letting stories unfold all the way to their sometimes sorrowful, sometimes orgasmic end." [...] Ken Capobianco of The Boston Globe called it [...] "bracingly good", [...] "compelling music" [...] that allows Bilal's [...] "falsetto to bring the intimate lyrics to life." [...] In The New York Times, Jon Pareles said his [...] "full-fledged" [...] voice [...] "needs no studio aid" [...] on songs that [...] "tease and insinuate" [...] with [...] "meanderings [...] lead somewhere." [...] Pitchfork journalist Jayson Greene was less impressed. He said it was a [...] "joy" [...] to listen to Bilal [...] "warp his voice into improbable shapes", but believed the music lacked any prominent melodies. Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times was more critical of the closing series of slow jams and [...] "atmospheric clutter", while writing that the album's best songs [...] "warrant the increased attention" [...] in Bilal.|$|E

[...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine wrote that [...] "while a few tracks are more daft than deft," [...] more recent groundbreakers like The Avalanches could never exist without [...] "Da Funk". Ian Mathers of Stylus Magazine noted that [...] "there's {{a core of}} unimpeachably classic work on Homework, hidden among the merely good, and when you've got such a classic debut hidden in {{the outlines of the}} epic slouch of their debut, it's hard not to get frustrated." [...] Rolling Stone awarded the album three stars out of five, commenting that [...] "the duo's essential, career-defining insight is that the problem with disco the first time around was not that it was stupid but that it was not stupid enough." [...] Rolling Stone ranked Homework at the top on their list of [...] "The 30 Greatest EDM Albums of All Time" [...] while affirming that Daft Punk's debut [...] "is pure synapse-tweaking brilliance." [...] According to Scott Woods of The Village Voice, [...] "Daft Punk [...] the lid off the [...] sewer" [...] with the release of Homework. Ryan Schreiber of Pitchfork awarded it 7.6 out of 10. He stated that [...] "Homework provides sixteen whole tracks of modern-day boom box bass n' drum and unlike your science project, it doesn't require a lot of intricate calculations to figure out how it works." [...] In his view, [...] "It <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> Atari 2600 on a killing spree." [...] By contrast, Robert Christgau of The Village Voice cited [...] "Da Funk" [...] as a [...] "choice cut", indicating [...] "a good song on an album that isn't worth your time or money". Darren Gawle from Drop-D Magazine also gave a negative review, stating that [...] "Homework is the work of a couple of DJs who sound amateurish at best." ...|$|E
500|$|Kill 'Em All {{received}} critical acclaim. Bernard Doe of Metal Forces described Kill 'Em All {{as one of}} {{the fastest}} and heaviest albums ever recorded, and remarked that the album is not for the faint-hearted. Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune acknowledged it as the [...] "speed metal prototype", but felt the lyrical replication of Judas Priest and the Misfits kept the album short from becoming a classic. In a retrospective review, Billboard praised Kill 'Em All for changing the face of popular music with its unique combination of punk and metal. AllMusic's Steve Huey called it [...] "the true birth of thrash". He praised Hetfield's highly technical rhythm guitar style and said that the band was [...] "playing with tightly controlled fury even at the most ridiculously fast tempos". Rob Kemp, writing in The Rolling Stone Album Guide, credited the album for consolidating the punk rock and heavy metal scenes, but felt that apart from [...] "Seek & Destroy" [...] and [...] "(Anesthesia) - Pulling Teeth", most of the album had the band [...] "trying to look tough" [...] over enthusiastic but unfinished riff-based songs. Journalist Martin Popoff said Kill 'Em All differentiated from the debuts by Metallica's Bay Area contemporaries because the fans could identify with Hetfield's lyrics and the band's appearance. Spins Chuck Eddy considered Kill 'Em All the inception of the [...] "extreme metal mania" [...] of the early 1980s. He noted the album did not receive much critical praise {{at the time of its}} release, but said it aged well and opened the doors for the less commercially successful bands. Although McIver credits Venom's Welcome to Hell (1981) as the first thrash metal album, he acknowledged Kill 'Em All as a major influence on the flourishing American heavy metal scene. Despite its [...] "less-than-perfect" [...] production, Loudwires Jon Wiederhorn said that Kill 'Em All <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> [...] "influential slice of history" [...] and stands on the same level as classic albums by Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden, and Judas Priest.|$|E
500|$|Reviews were universally {{less than}} {{positive}} on other systems. While critics praised {{the idea of}} the game, they found fault in the execution. Several critics disliked that the troops spawned by the player simply walk past the troops spawned by the opponent without the two groups fighting. The game's flow also attracted significant criticism, with Peter Eykemans of IGN saying [...] "Even on double speed, the pace is painful. This makes a simple two-person battle turn into a lengthy saga of repeating the same actions over and over again." [...] and Ray Carsillo of Electronic Gaming Monthly complaining of [...] "long drawn out matches on even the easiest difficulty settings as you try to force your way past a virtual stalemate". While the visuals did receive praise, critics felt that they also {{got in the way of}} allowing the player to tell what was going on in the game. Opinions about the narrator were mixed. Henry Winchester of PC Gamer praised the voiceover, calling it [...] "a pleasingly booze-obsessed voiceover, delivered by what sounds like a Dalek doing an impression of Sean Connery". Carsillo of Electronic Gaming Monthly was less kind, stating that [...] "your narrator and chief advisor <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> awful Sean Connery impersonator and he may be the best of the voice actors you come across". GamesRadar strikes a more neutral tone, stating that [...] "Pre and post-battle dialog is fully voiced by what are only technically 'actors,' but it definitely beats silent text, and does add a bit of flavor to the world." [...] Multiplayer also received mixed reviews. Eykemans of IGN suggested that multiplayer exacerbates the length and flow issues already present in the single player game, while Matt Hughes of GamesRadar calls multiplayer the game's [...] "biggest asset", stating that [...] "Playing against real humans definitely ramps up the intensity and reduces the cheap exploitation found in the campaign.".|$|E
