5|$|Kelsey Munro {{reviewed}} {{the book in}} the Sydney Morning Herald and The Age, suggesting that it is pessimistic and does not present any false hope. But he says pessimism is not the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> fatalism, and Hamilton believes there is still an urgent need for government intervention to avoid worst-case scenarios by reducing emissions. Munro {{also points out that}} some eminent climate scientists, like Princeton University's Michael Oppenheimer, remain optimistic that humanity will act before it is too late.|$|E
5|$|The {{corresponding}} {{concept for}} undirected graphs is a forest, an undirected graph without cycles. Choosing an orientation for a forest produces {{a special kind}} of directed acyclic graph called a polytree. However there are many other kinds of directed acyclic graph that are not formed by orienting the edges of an undirected acyclic graph. Moreover, every undirected graph has an acyclic orientation, an assignment of a direction for its edges that makes it into a directed acyclic graph. To emphasize that DAGs are not the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> directed versions of undirected acyclic graphs, some authors call them acyclic directed graphs or acyclic digraphs.|$|E
25|$|Transposition {{is exactly}} the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> Contraposition, {{described}} in a different language.|$|E
60|$|GERALD. I {{suppose you}} think him bad, because he doesn't believe the <b>same</b> <b>things</b> <b>as</b> you do. Well, men are {{different}} from women, mother. It is natural {{that they should have}} different views.|$|R

50|$|The {{agreement}} was reached {{a few years before}} the 1999 Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification (between Lutherans and Catholics), which in substance says many of the <b>same</b> <b>things</b> <b>as</b> ECT in that it emphasizes Sola gratia over Sola fide.|$|R
25|$|A monoid is, essentially, the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> a {{category}} {{with a single}} object.|$|E
25|$|Thus an {{embedding}} is the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> {{a strong}} homomorphism which is one-to-one.|$|E
25|$|Another {{application}} is in database theory, where a relational {{model of a}} database is essentially the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> a relational structure. It turns out that a conjunctive query on a database can be described by another structure in the same signature as the database model. A homomorphism from the relational model to the structure representing the query is the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> {{a solution to the}} query. This shows that the conjunctive query problem is also equivalent to the homomorphism problem.|$|E
50|$|Adults also exhibit certain {{behaviors}} (and avoid others) out of {{the desire}} for the acceptance and approval of their friends. To {{be one of the}} group, they might do some of the <b>same</b> <b>things</b> <b>as</b> teens and children (e.g. drinking or taking other drugs).|$|R
5000|$|Why {{do we need}} to {{take offense}} against Poles, if we in our country have the same (and for us — {{sufficiently}} more dangerous and hazardous) cohort of pundits, philosophers, historians who enjoy the maximal favourable regime set by the state and do the <b>same</b> <b>things</b> <b>as</b> Poles do? ...|$|R
5000|$|... 2004 - George W. Bush Administration, for the <b>same</b> <b>things</b> <b>as</b> the {{previous}} year, for manipulating and forging intelligence data about Iraq, for creating euphemisms {{to downplay the}} Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse, and for the Justice Department {{turning a blind eye}} to torture authorized by officials in the Bush Administration.|$|R
25|$|In PL/M, $ {{can be used}} to put {{a visible}} {{separation}} between words in compound identifiers. For example, 'Some$Name' refers to the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> 'SomeName'.|$|E
25|$|In {{more recent}} years, the {{ampersand}} {{has made its}} way into the Haskell standard library, representing flipped function application: x & f means the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> f x.|$|E
25|$|Roles {{are added}} to a class or object with the does keyword, as opposed to inheritance's is. The {{keywords}} reflect the differing meanings of the two features: role composition gives a class {{the behavior of the}} role, but doesn't indicate that it is truly the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> the role.|$|E
6000|$|CANDIDA. This {{comes of}} James {{teaching}} {{me to think}} for myself, and never to hold back {{out of fear of}} what other people may think of me.

50|$|In Episodes 10 and 11, the Dreamers had {{to perform}} their second show to the {{audience}}. Then the <b>same</b> <b>things</b> <b>as</b> the former episodes would occur. Finally, if more than 80 percent (240 votes) of the audience voted for the Dreamer's dream, the contestant would be {{given a chance to}} realize his or her dream.|$|R
25|$|Plato also {{compares the}} three {{parts of the}} soul or psyche to a {{societal}} caste system. According to Plato's theory, the three-part soul is essentially the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> a state's class system because, to function well, each part must contribute so that the whole functions well. Logos keeps the other functions of the soul regulated.|$|E
25|$|S. 3068, {{a bill to}} bind {{increases}} in veterans' benefits to an amount equivalent to the cost-of-living adjustment for Social Security benefits, introduced May 25, 2006, reintroduced in the 110th Congress as S. 161 and in the 111th Congress as S. 3359. A separate bill sponsored by Mark Begich of Alaska, S. 2258 (113th), that does the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> this bill has since become law.|$|E
25|$|There is {{considerable}} debate {{about what would}} have been a more appropriate term. Some scholars, notably Ruth Ross, argue that mana (prestige, authority) would have more accurately conveyed the transfer of sovereignty. However, it has more recently been argued by others, including Judith Binney, that mana would not have been appropriate. This is because mana is not the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> sovereignty, and also because no-one can give up their mana.|$|E
50|$|The AIM Multiuser Benchmark, {{also called}} the AIM Benchmark Suite VII or AIM7, is a job {{throughput}} benchmark widely used by UNIX computer system vendors. Current research operating systems such as K42 use the reaim form of the benchmark for performance analysis.The AIM7 benchmark measures some of the <b>same</b> <b>things</b> <b>as</b> the SDET benchmark.|$|R
50|$|The iTurtle is {{a turtle}} {{version of the}} iDog. It also comes with a plug cable (3.5 mm) with 2 touch sensors on its tail and head. It moves its shell up and down, shakes its head side to side, and taps its foot. Has the <b>same</b> <b>things</b> <b>as</b> others except his moods are modified.|$|R
50|$|Like other mollusks, the Appalachian Elktoe feeds {{itself by}} picking out {{particles}} {{of food that}} are in the water. The specifics of their diet has yet to be determined, but it has been assumed that the Appalachian Elktoe survives off the <b>same</b> <b>things</b> <b>as</b> other freshwater mussels: detritus, diatoms, phytoplankton, and zooplankton (Churchill and Lewis, 1921).|$|R
25|$|Every {{polynomial}} in one variable x {{with real}} coefficients can be uniquely written {{as the product}} of a constant, polynomials of the form x+a with a real, and polynomials of the form x2+ax+b with a and b real and a2−4b<nbsp&0 (which is the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> saying that the polynomial x2nbsp&+nbsp&axnbsp&+nbsp&b has no real roots). This implies that the number of non-real complex roots (up to multiplicity) is always even.|$|E
25|$|In other words, on average, 80% of {{the times}} that upper and lower {{thresholds}} are calculated by this method, the true mean is both below the upper threshold and above the lower threshold. This is not the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> {{saying that there is}} an 80% probability that the true mean lies between a particular pair of upper and lower thresholds that have been calculated by this method; see confidence interval and prosecutor's fallacy.|$|E
25|$|A small {{category}} with {{a single}} object is the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> a monoid: the morphisms of a one-object category {{can be thought of}} as elements of the monoid, and composition in the category is thought of as the monoid operation. Functors between one-object categories correspond to monoid homomorphisms. So in a sense, functors between arbitrary categories are a kind of generalization of monoid homomorphisms to categories with more than one object.|$|E
50|$|The TM31 is {{a manual}} Thermomix with push buttons, unlike the touch screen {{of the new}} TM5. It can do the <b>same</b> <b>things</b> <b>as</b> the TM5 but the mixing bowl and varoma have a lower capacity. The TM31 does not have recipe chips {{but most of the}} recipes in the TM5 recipe book can be {{attempted}} in the TM31.|$|R

25|$|The term throughput, {{essentially}} the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> digital bandwidth consumption, denotes the achieved average useful bit rate {{in a computer}} network over a logical or physical communication link or through a network node, typically measured at a reference point above the datalink layer. This implies that the throughput often excludes data link layer protocol overhead. The throughput {{is affected by the}} traffic load from the data source in question, as well as from other sources sharing the same network resources. See also measuring network throughput.|$|E
25|$|As seen above, in the {{standard}} encoding of graphs as structures the induced substructures are precisely the induced subgraphs. However, a homomorphism between graphs is the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> a homomorphism between the two structures coding the graph. In {{the example of the}} previous section, even though the subgraph H of G is not induced, the identity map id:H→G is a homomorphism. This map is in fact a monomorphism in the category σ-Hom, and therefore H is a subobject of G which is not an induced substructure.|$|E
25|$|Members of {{a housing}} {{cooperative}} (bostadsrättsförening) formally own the right (bostadsrätt) to inhabit their respective apartment for an unlimited time, a right {{that can be}} bought and sold on the open real estate market. This {{is one of the}} main forms of home ownership in the country, and a membership in a housing cooperative is generally held to be the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> owning (as opposed to renting) an apartment. The most usual physical/legal form is a block of flats owned freehold by a cooperative.|$|E
50|$|School cafeterias serve five-course meals, {{even for}} preschoolers. Schoolchildren eat the <b>same</b> <b>things</b> <b>as</b> adults. A school lunch in France {{contains}} an appetizer, salad, main course, cheese plate, and dessert. Bread may accompany each meal. A menu might include potato leek soup, carrot and bean salad, lamb with saffron, {{an assortment of}} cheeses, and grapefruit. Each meal is accompanied with water.|$|R
50|$|The Amazon Tap {{can do the}} <b>same</b> <b>things</b> <b>as</b> the Echo; however, it is {{battery powered}} so it is portable. Initially the user had to press an {{activation}} button {{on the front of}} the Tap to speak commands. However, a February 2017 software update allows the option of activating the Tap with an activation word, just like the Echo and the Dot.|$|R
50|$|Lines (also {{known as}} licks) are pre-planned ideas the artist plays {{over and over}} during an improvised solo. Lines can be {{obtained}} by listening to jazz records and transcribing what the professionals play during their solos. Transcribing is putting what you hear in a record onto music paper. Cells are short musical ideas. They are basically the <b>same</b> <b>things</b> <b>as</b> lines, but they are shorter.|$|R
