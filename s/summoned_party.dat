40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} {{the notion of}} Plausible Deniability in an information theoretic framework. We consider a scenario where an entity that eavesdrops through a broadcast channel summons {{one of the parties}} in a communication protocol to reveal their message (or signal vector). It is desirable that the <b>summoned</b> <b>party</b> have enough freedom to produce a fake output that is likely plausible given the eavesdropper's observation. We examine three variants of this problem [...] Message Deniability, Transmitter Deniability, and Receiver Deniability. In the first setting, the message sender is summoned to produce the sent message. Similarly, {{in the second and third}} settings, the transmitter and the receiver are required to produce the transmitted codeword, and the received vector respectively. For each of these settings, we examine the maximum communication rate that allows a given minimum rate of plausible fake outputs. For the Message and Transmitter Deniability problems, we fully characterise the capacity region for general broadcast channels, while for the Receiver Deniability problem, we give an achievable rate region for physically degraded broadcast channels.

40|$|With {{social media}} apps {{becoming}} a fixture of current mobile technologies, {{the time is}} ripe {{to take stock of}} previous research on earlier mobile services (e. g. text-messaging and mobile phone conversations) and discuss their resonance to the growing area of social media research. This paper explores the issue of social presence in mobile technologies, with a focus on referential practices of deixis in text-messaging. Deixis is employed as a tool that allows us to look into the contextual aspects to which users of text-messaging orient, in order to fulfil specific tasks. According to Hanks (2005, p. 191), deixis as referential practice invokes a web of the ‘elementary social relations of speaker, addressee, and object, and the phenomenal context of utterance’. These contextual relations support ‘our sense of co-presence, […] and of the immediacy of the spatial-temporal world in which speech takes place’ (ibid). By exploring deixis as referential practice, this paper discusses the issue of how co-participants communicate these relations in mobile contexts. The study analyses a sample of texts exchanged by young people in Greece (summer 2003 -spring 2004). It reveals the proliferation of deictic references in mundane acts of micro-coordinating social activities. The data analysis suggests that the current location of the <b>summoned</b> <b>party</b> is used as a contextual resource in pre-summoning sequences that attempt to negotiate and coordinate the actual summons of an imminent telephone call. At the same time, my participants spatially and temporally position and re-position themselves towards ongoing social arrangements. Habitual engagement with people, places and activities allows participants to (re) formulate locational references in line with the interaction unfolding. Such findings are discussed in relation to current advances in social media research, implicating an increasing blurring of boundaries between face-to-face and a range of mediated interactions...|$|E

They are able to summon strong elemental pets, from the domains of Earth, Water, Air, and Fire, each with unique strengths and weaknesses. They have the ability to conjure pet armor and weapons, food, drink, and mod rods, which allow players to convert their health into mana. Magicians can <b>summon</b> <b>party</b> members to different parts of a zone with the Call of the Hero spell, which can be helpful in raid zones. Magicians' direct damage spells are generally from the fire school of magic.|$|R

60|$|Mr. Mayor's cook! Here, then, {{a secret}} was out, with a vengeance! Guert had not {{reclaimed}} his own lost supper, which, having {{passed into the}} hands of the Philistines, was hopelessly gone; but he had actually stolen and eaten the supper prepared for the Mayor of Albany,--Peter Cuyler, a man of note, and standing, in all respects; a functionary who had held his office from time immemorial;--the lamp was the symbol of authority, and not the sign of an inn, or an eating-house;--the supper, moreover, was never prepared for one man, or one family, but had certainly been got up for the honourable treatment of a goodly company;--fifteen stout men had mainly appeased their appetites on it; and the fragments were that moment under discussion among half-a-dozen large-mouthed, shining negro faces, in the kitchen! Under circumstances like these, I looked inquiringly at the Rev. Mr. Worden--and the Rev. Mr. Worden looked inquiringly at me. There was no apparent remedy, however; but, after a brief consultation with Guert, we, the <b>summoned</b> <b>parties,</b> took our hats and followed Dogberry to the residence of Mr. Mayor.|$|R
