5|$|On February 21, 2007, NASA and Nature {{released}} {{news that}} HD 209458 b {{was one of}} the first two extrasolar planets to have their spectra directly observed, the other one being HD 189733 b. This was long seen as the first mechanism by which extrasolar but non-sentient life forms could be searched for, by way of influence on a planet's atmosphere. A group of investigators led by Jeremy Richardson of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center spectrally measured HD 209458 b's atmosphere in the range of 7.5 to 13.2 micrometres. The results defied theoretical expectations in several ways. The spectrum had been predicted to have a peak at 10 micrometres which would have indicated water vapor in the atmosphere, but such a peak was absent, indicating no detectable water vapor. Another unpredicted peak was observed at 9.65 micrometres, which the investigators attributed to clouds of silicate dust, a phenomenon not previously observed. Another unpredicted peak occurred at 7.78 micrometres, for which the investigators did not have an explanation. A separate team led by Mark Swain of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory reanalyzed the Richardson et al. data, and had not yet published their results when the Richardson et al. article came out, but made <b>similar</b> <b>findings.</b>|$|E

30|$|The {{quality of}} life and {{recovery}} {{has been shown to be}} poorer in elderly patients ventilated for more than 7  days, with higher proportion of debilities [103]. <b>Similar</b> <b>finding</b> were reported for neurocognitive problems such as PTSD or cognitive impairment [25].|$|R
25|$|In 2014, Amnesty {{released}} a report with <b>similar</b> <b>findings,</b> criticizing Israel for excessive and reckless use of force for which Israeli soldiers are not held accountable. Amnesty said characteristics of the violence suggested it was employed {{as a matter of}} policy, and that there was evidence some killings amounted to war crimes.|$|E
25|$|Sicilian {{mathematician}} and astronomer Francesco Maurolico (1494-1575) answered Aristotle's problem how sunlight that shines through rectangular holes {{can form}} round spots of light or crescent-shaped spots during an eclipse in his treatise Photismi de lumine et umbra (1521-1554). However this wasn't published before 1611, after Johannes Kepler had published <b>similar</b> <b>findings</b> of his own.|$|E
25|$|A {{year after}} Oliver and Schäfer, Władysław Szymonowicz (1869–1939) and Napoleon Cybulski of the Jagiellonian University in Kraków {{reported}} essentially <b>similar</b> <b>findings</b> and conclusions. In one aspect, they {{went beyond the}} work in England: blood from the adrenal veins caused hypertension when injected intravenously in a recipient dog, whereas blood from other veins did not, showing that the adrenal pressor substance was in fact secreted into the blood and confirming Vulpian.|$|E
30|$|In {{this study}} {{majority}} of the tetanus patients were males and rural dwellers. Similarly, the most common portal of entry among patients {{in this study was}} trauma, which constituted 60  % of all the admitted tetanus patients. <b>Similar</b> <b>finding</b> was reported by a study from India (Anuradha 2006).|$|R
30|$|The higher-order {{structure}} of L 2 ability, however, {{has not always}} received support. Bachman and Palmer (1981) analyzed speaking and reading test data and found that L 2 ability was best described as consisting of non-hierarchical, multiple components that correlated with each other. A <b>similar</b> <b>finding</b> was obtained in Sang et al (1986).|$|R
3000|$|... 6 A <b>similar</b> <b>finding</b> is {{reported}} by Amuedo-Dorantes and de la Rica (2006) for Spain, {{according to which}} African women suffer the lowest occupational attainment, with respect to other immigration groups (in particular if taken into account the years since migration), while Central and South Americans, along with immigrants within EU 15, show high level of assimilation.|$|R
25|$|In 2016 the American College of Physicians {{advised that}} {{insomnia}} be treated first by treating comorbid conditions, then with cognitive behavioral therapy and behavioral changes, {{and then with}} drugs; donexpin was among those recommended for short term help maintaining sleep, {{on the basis of}} weak evidence. The 2017 American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommendations focused on treatment with drugs were similar. A 2015 AHRQ review of treatments for insomnia had <b>similar</b> <b>findings.</b>|$|E
25|$|Further {{experiments}} have documented <b>similar</b> <b>findings.</b> In one study, when {{participants were given}} cognitively demanding concurrent tasks, the results showed a paradoxical higher frequency of target thoughts than controls. However other controlled studies have not shown such effects. For example, Wenzlaff and Bates found that subjects concentrating on a positive task experienced neither paradoxical effects nor rebound effects—even when challenged with cognitive load. Wenzlaff and Bates also note that the beneficiality of concentration in their study participants was better optimized when the subjects employed positive thoughts.|$|E
25|$|The idea of {{the social}} sharing of emotion derived from studies about {{emotional}} trauma. These studies show that after natural disasters, catastrophes, or life-change events people {{have a tendency to}} talk about their experiences and disclose their feelings and emotions. For example, in a 1975 study exploring the psychological reactions to the death of a loved one, it was found that 88% of bereavers felt a need to talk about the event to others. Other studies produced <b>similar</b> <b>findings</b> for people who experienced natural disasters and for cancer patients. Rimé later proposed the term “social sharing of emotions” to describe this phenomenon.|$|E

India, Indonesia, China, and Vietnam were {{the top four}} cyber-security risks in Asia. Globally, Thailand's exposure to cyber-attacks was ranked 11th of 200 nations (1=worst, 200=best). The report echos a <b>similar</b> <b>finding</b> by Microsoft researchers in 2015.|$|R
30|$|A <b>similar</b> <b>finding</b> {{was shown}} by Bocchetta et al. in 1998. Lithium {{treatment}} in 100 patients with affective disorders {{was associated with}} a 6 -fold decreased incidence of suicide attempts. During the observational period, ten suicides occurred, while nine deaths occurred when patients had discontinued lithium therapy. The risk of suicide was 24 times higher when patients went off lithium.|$|R

25|$|Baker et al. had <b>similar</b> <b>findings</b> in a {{study in}} which Utah {{residents}} and non-Utah residents were asked to discern the degree of residency of a sample of speakers. Perhaps unsurprisingly, they found that Utah residents and western non-Utah residents tended to correctly identify speakers as being from Utah; the difficulty of other non-Utah residents in identifying Utah speakers was attributed to lack of expertise. However, the western non-Utah residents tended to use more stereotypical phonetic cues to identify speakers than Utah residents. Such findings point {{to the importance of}} experience when correctly identifying dialect or region of origin.|$|E
25|$|Researchers {{from other}} {{countries}} have produced <b>similar</b> <b>findings.</b> In Poland, for example, it was found in an experiment that self-reporting same-sex attraction was twice as common using an online questionnaire as in a paper questionnaire, {{despite the fact that}} the group that answered the online questions and the one that filled out the paper form were similar on all demographic variables and on all other aspects of their sexuality. In the 90s, an experiment was made in the US where it was found that teen males were several times more likely to acknowledge same-sex experiences using a computer methodology compared to paper questionnaires.|$|E
25|$|Thrombosis, presumably from overactive {{inhibition}} of the fibrinolytic system, may occur {{at a higher}} rate, but until 2006 there was limited evidence for this association. Similarly, while biochemical measures of renal function were known to occasionally deteriorate, {{there was no evidence}} that this greatly influenced outcomes. A study performed in cardiac surgery patients reported in 2006 showed that there was indeed a risk of acute renal failure, myocardial infarction and heart failure, as well as stroke and encephalopathy. The study authors recommend older antifibrinolytics (such as tranexamic acid) in which these risks were not documented. The same group updated their data in 2007 and demonstrated <b>similar</b> <b>findings.</b>|$|E
30|$|However, when {{considering}} the rate of failure between immediate loading and conventional loading in edentulous patients, there were publications that showed {{a higher risk of}} failure in treatment with an immediate loading protocol. Another article of meta-analysis showed that immediate loading indicated a slightly higher implant failure rate than conventional loading [35]. A <b>similar</b> <b>finding</b> was also reported, but with a more significant difference [34].|$|R
30|$|All the {{hot spring}} sites had high {{electrical}} conductivity value (Table  1) {{this may be}} due to the texture of mineral soil and the degree of humification of organic soil. <b>Similar</b> <b>finding</b> was obtained in the same study area in the Borkena valley for non hot spring sites (Getachew et al. 2012) as well in Kenya showed that electrical Conductivity was identified as an indicator of anthropogenic activities use (Minaya et al. 2013).|$|R
25|$|SIM PlanetQuest was a US project (cancelled in 2010) {{that would}} have had <b>similar</b> {{exoplanet}} <b>finding</b> capabilities to Gaia.|$|R
25|$|More recently, {{research}} has engaged three further directions – the speculation {{that at least}} some animals seem to enjoy a zoophilic relationship assuming sadism is not present, and can form an affectionate bond. <b>Similar</b> <b>findings</b> are also reported by Kinsey (cited by Masters), and others earlier in history. Miletski (1999) notes that information on sex with animals on the internet is often very emphatic as to what the zoophile believes gives pleasure and how to identify what is perceived as consent beforehand. For instance, Jonathan Balcombe says animals do things for pleasure. But he himself says pet owners will be unimpressed by this statement, as this is not news to them.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} <b>similar</b> <b>findings</b> for India. Real wages and living {{standards}} in 18th-century Bengal and Mysore {{were higher than}} in Britain, which in turn had the highest living standards in Europe. Workers in the textile industry, for example, earned more in Bengal and Mysore {{than they did in}} Britain, while agricultural labour in Britain had to work longer hours to earn the same amount as in Mysore. In the late 18th century, Mysore's average per-capita income was five times higher than subsistence level, i.e. five times higher than $400 (1990 international dollars), or $2,000 per capita. In comparison, the highest national per-capita incomes in 1820 were $1,838 for the Netherlands and $1,706 for Britain.|$|E
25|$|If, as is {{commonly}} done, APD is assessed using tests that involve identifying, repeating or discriminating speech, then {{a child may}} do poorly because of primary language problems. In a study comparing children with a diagnosis of dyslexia and those with a diagnosis of APD, they found the two groups could not be distinguished. obtained <b>similar</b> <b>findings</b> in studies comparing children diagnosed with SLI or APD. The two groups had very similar profiles. This raises the worrying possibility that the diagnosis that a child receives may be largely {{a function of the}} specialist they see: the same child who would be diagnosed with APD by an audiologist may be diagnosed with SLI by a speech-language therapist or with dyslexia by a psychologist.|$|E
30|$|In {{our present}} study, 72.2 % of infections {{were caused by}} gram-positive and 27.8 % by gram-negative bacteria. <b>Similar</b> <b>finding</b> was seen from studies in Gonder, Ethiopia (69 and 31 %) (Dagnew et al. 2013), Jimma, Ethiopia, (60.9 and 39.1 %) (Zenebe et al. 2011) Gondar, Ethiopia (70.2 and 29.8 %) (Ali and Kebede 2008), Zimbabwe (71.9 and 28.1 %) (Obi and Mazarura 1996), Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (62.6 and 37.4 %) (Shitaye et al. 2010).|$|R

25|$|Some {{economists have}} {{questioned}} if the CRA was – {{or at least}} had become – irrelevant, {{because it was not}} needed to encourage banks to make profitable loans to a variety of borrowers. In a 2003 research paper, economists at the Federal Reserve could not find clear evidence that the CRA increased lending and home ownership more in low income neighborhoods than in higher income ones. A 2008 Competitive Enterprise Institute study resulted in a <b>similar</b> <b>finding.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{functional}} role of synchronized oscillatory {{activity in the}} brain was mainly established in experiments performed on awake kittens with multiple electrodes implanted in the visual cortex. These experiments showed that groups of spatially segregated neurons engage in synchronous oscillatory activity when activated by visual stimuli. The frequency of these oscillations was {{in the range of}} 40Hz and differed from the periodic activation induced by the grating, suggesting that the oscillations and their synchronization were due to internal neuronal interactions. <b>Similar</b> <b>findings</b> were shown in parallel by the group of Eckhorn, providing further evidence for the {{functional role}} of neural synchronization in feature binding. Since then, numerous studies have replicated these findings and extended them to different modalities such as EEG, providing extensive evidence of the functional role of gamma oscillations in visual perception.|$|E
25|$|NET has {{approximately}} 15% of the affinity of the anabolic–androgenic steroid (AAS) metribolone (R-1881) for the AR, and in accordance, is weakly androgenic. In {{contrast to}} NET, 5α-DHNET, the major metabolite of NET, shows higher {{affinity for the}} AR, with approximately 27% of the affinity of metribolone. However, although 5α-DHNET has higher affinity for the AR than NET, it has significantly diminished and in fact almost abolished androgenic potency in comparison to NET in rodent bioassays. <b>Similar</b> <b>findings</b> were observed for ethisterone (17α-ethynyltestosterone) and its 5α-reduced metabolite, whereas 5α-reduction enhanced both the AR affinity and androgenic potency of testosterone and nandrolone (19-nortestosterone) in rodent bioassays. As such, {{it appears that the}} ethynyl group of NET at the C17α position is responsible for its loss of androgenicity upon 5α-reduction.|$|E
25|$|The Y {{chromosome}} is {{much larger}} than mtDNA, and is relatively homogeneous; therefore it has taken much longer to find distinct lineages and to analyse them. Conversely, because the Y chromosome is so large by comparison, it holds more genetic information. Y chromosome studies show <b>similar</b> <b>findings</b> to those made with mtDNA. The estimate for {{the age of the}} ancestral Y chromosome for all extant Y chromosomes is given at about 70,000 years ago and is also placed in Africa; the individual who contributed this Y chromosomal heritage is sometimes referred to as Y chromosome Adam. The difference in dates between Y chromosome Adam and mitochondrial Eve is usually attributed to a higher extinction rate for Y chromosomes due to greater differential reproductive success between individual men, which means that a small number of very successful men may produce many children, while a larger number of less successful men will produce far fewer children.|$|E
30|$|As {{expected}} {{in patients with}} auto-PEEP ≥  5  cmH 2 O, our study population showed a high percentage (65  %) of patients with chronic or acute lung disease, confirming a <b>similar</b> <b>finding</b> from a previous study in mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory failure [18]. Our sample is representative of those critically ill patients with at least 5  cmH 2 O of auto-PEEP, which have different characteristics {{when compared to the}} overall population of mechanically ventilated patients.|$|R
40|$|Our results {{reveal that}} the Feo/Klp 3 A complex is {{necessary}} for Polo recruitment to the spindle midzone. A <b>similar</b> <b>finding</b> has also been recently reported in mammalian cells [1], suggesting that this basic mechanism has been conserved during evolution, albeit with some differences. Finally, since cleavage furrow formation and ingression are unaffected following feo RNAi, our data imply that Polo recruitment to the central spindle is not required for furrowing, but some other aspect of cytokinesis...|$|R
50|$|Researchers (including Klein himself) {{initially}} {{challenged the}} foraging facilitator proposal. Pratt and Abrams suggested that IOR {{was not a}} foraging assistant because inhibition only occurred at the most recently attended stimulus. Earlier, Klein and Taylor found {{that it could not}} be concluded that attention was inhibited in IOR because at that time, inhibition had not been examined utilizing non-spatial discrimination tasks. Additionally, questions arose after it had been difficult to replicate Klein's <b>findings,</b> however, <b>similar</b> <b>finding</b> were reported eventually.|$|R
