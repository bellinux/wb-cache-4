5000|$|Despite a {{government}} promise to retain medical cards for 95% of over-70s, an estimated 15,000 pensioners {{joined in a}} demonstration organised by the Irish <b>Senior</b> <b>Citizens</b> <b>Parliament</b> on 22 October. This protest, dubbed [...] "the grey army" [...] by media reports included representatives from organisations such as the Tara Disabled Mineworkers, Pensioners' Association, Mayo Active Retirement Association and the Socialist Party as well as numerous independent protesters, marched on Dublin's Leinster House to protest the changes to their medical card scheme. Iarnród Éireann claimed that up to 1,000 pensioners had travelled on early morning trains from Counties Cork and Kerry for the protest rally, with a spokesman suggesting that the 06:30 and 07:30 trains from Cork were particularly busy. An extra train had to be commissioned from Cork at 08:20 {{to cope with the}} demand by pensioners for transport to reach Dublin in time for the demonstration. All five carriages on the 07:30 train were fully booked by the previous evening; ironically, many of the passengers were pensioners using their free travel passes also provided by the government. The pensioners also availed themselves of taxis offering free journeys to the over-70s especially for the protest. One elderly man clutched a banner heralding the invitation [...] "Just shoot us, it would be quicker".|$|E

At present there is no statistics that would show the numbers of <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> in specific age groups concerning the amount of pensions, and there is no statistics that would show the numbers in territorial units at lower levels than regions. It is surprising that, with the present alarming prognoses of the numbers of <b>senior</b> <b>citizens,</b> statistical data concerning pensions are not analysed in detail.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to teach nurses, who work in this institution, to understand the Orem?s model so that {{they knew how to}} prepare individual nursing plans according to it. So far, these anamneses of <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> have been prepared according to the Gordon?s model. Since Orem dealt with self-care deficits, which are found in <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> most frequently, it was worth considering testing the model in everyday practice. Three objectives were set, in which I tried to find the fitness of the Orem?s model for the care of <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> in terms of finding out about their independence and nursing care, to find out whether this model is more appropriate for the nursing care of <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> than the current Gordon?s model and to find out how nurses work with the new model. Four research questions were formulated based on these set objectives and they were answered. The Orem?s model is suitable for the determination of self-reliance of <b>senior</b> <b>citizens.</b> The applied Orem?s model is more suitable for the nursing care of <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> than the current Gordon?s model. Nurses and the <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> from the Centre of Social Services Staroměstská find the Orem?s model more suitable. In conclusion, all the set objectives have been met.

40|$|Abstract The intergenerational {{relationships}} between <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> living in retirement homes {{and their families}} and friends in the town of Humpolec Aging and <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> are currently topical subjects. The population is aging and society should be prepared for this phenomenon. This shall bring about changes in various spheres and fields, such as health care and social services, and also in the relationships in and functioning of todays family. The thesis "The intergenerational {{relationships between}} <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> living in retirement homes and their children and friends in the town of Humpolec is devoted to the functioning of intergenerational relationships between <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> {{and their families and}} friends. The theoretical section deals with, first of all, the definition of the term <b>senior</b> <b>citizens,</b> their standing in society and the increasing number of <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> of a greater age. It emphasizes important health and mental changes that accompany old age and also characterizes the importance and types of activities and aging. It presents the results and findings of up to now research dealing with intergenerational relationships. For greater clarity and distinction, it divides these relationships into intergenerational relationships between <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> and their children, <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> and their grandchildren, <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> and their siblings, and <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> and their friends. Intergenerational relationships are primarily formed within a family, which is why one chapter is devoted to families, their functioning, and their importance. The next to last chapter in the theoretical section emphasizes the importance of the quality of life, which significantly influences and affects intergenerational relationships. The last chapter is devoted to retirement homes for <b>senior</b> <b>citizens,</b> and also the important changes that were brought about by Act No. 108 / 2006 Coll., on Social Services. The empirical section is devoted to the carrying out of qualitative research. An in-depth interview was the method that was utilized. Interviews were carried out with ten <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> in two retirement homes; in the Blessed Bronislav Retirement Home and the Humpolec Retirement Home on Lužická Street. Interviews with six <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> took place in the first named retirement home and the remaining four interviews took place in the latter named retirement home. The findings of the research reveal how intergenerational relationships function, and what affects and forms them. The findings present the relationships between <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> and their children, their quality and frequency, their relationships with their grandchildren, and in some cases their great grandchildren, and with their siblings and friends. The findings show the stress of first coming to a retirement home and the importance of a family and/or friends when taking this step in life. The findings of the research emphasize the importance of activities in old age and the important areas of changes in ones health and mental state, when changes in one area affect other areas and {{the quality of life of}} <b>senior</b> <b>citizens.</b> The quality of life is also assuredly affected by the financial situation of <b>senior</b> <b>citizens,</b> which this thesis also deals with. Another factor is the surroundings in which <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> living in retirements homes live in. This thesis also deals with this issue...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} {{problems}} {{connected with the}} placement of <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> into homes for the elderly. The objectives of the thesis are {{to find out how}} long the waiting period for the placement into a home for <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> is and which obstacles and problems connected with the placement into homes for the elderly appear. The theoretical part of the thesis is focused on some demographic trends, the opinion of the Czech population about the old age and <b>senior</b> <b>citizens,</b> history of social services for <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> in the Czech Republic and abroad, and the current offer of social services for <b>senior</b> <b>citizens.</b> In this part, I also describe the process of placing of <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> into homes for the elderly and the services which homes for the elderly offer to their clients; I also focus on the senior citizens´ financial reimbursement of board and lodging in homes for the elderly. The research was conducted by means of quantitative and qualitative methods and techniques. In the qualitative research, I deal with the second part of my goal identifying obstacles to placement in homes for the elderly. Firstly, I set the following research questions: 1) What are the obstacles and problems in the process of placing <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> into homes for the elderly? and 2) Do <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> have any other options of care instead of the care in homes for the elderly? Then, I conducted semi-standardized interviews with 3 social workers, 8 <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> and with 3 members of families which put their <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> into homes for the elderly. I asked all of them almost identical questions to be able to compare their responses later. The results show that nowadays, dependent <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> who have no other option of care {{are more likely to be}} placed into homes for the elderly. The answers to the question "What are the obstacles and problems when placing <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> into homes for the elderly?" were rather variable and they cannot be generalized. The quantitative part of my research relates to the first part of my goal. Here I primarily focused on the waiting period. The following two hypotheses were set for the research. H 1 : <b>Senior</b> <b>citizens</b> negatively evaluate the waiting period for their placement into homes for the elderly. H 2 : <b>Senior</b> <b>citizens</b> know only one possibility of care homes for the elderly. To verify the above hypotheses, I used the method of secondary analysis of the data taken from the client's documentation and the method of controlled conversation. Therefore, I conducted my research in the following homes for the elderly: Home for the elderly Light in Písek, Home for the elderly Bechyně, Home for the elderly Diaconia Centre ČCE Blanka in Písek, Home for the elderly Centre for Social Assistance Vodňany. Social workers in each facility advised me to use the greatest possible number of clients who were oriented and able to answer my questions. In total, I analyzed 100 files of personal documentation and then I conducted the structured interviews with the analysed clients in the homes for the elderly which are mentioned above. The average waiting period was 243 days. In the category of the waiting period shorter than 1 month there were 26 senior citizens; from 1 to 2 months 33 senior citizens; from 3 to 4 months 11 senior citizens; longer than 5 months 30 <b>senior</b> <b>citizens.</b> 79 <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> rated their waiting periods positively, but 21 <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> rated their waiting periods negatively. 56 <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> had some knowledge about other possibilities of care; most of them reported the nursing service (54 responses); homes with nursing (8 responses); personal assistance (3 responses); pensions for <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> (1 response) ...|$|R
