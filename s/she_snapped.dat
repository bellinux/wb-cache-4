500|$|The Queen's health {{remained}} fair {{until the}} autumn of 1602, when a series of deaths among her friends plunged her into a severe depression. In February 1603, the death of Catherine Carey, Countess of Nottingham, the niece of her cousin and close friend Lady Knollys, came as a particular blow. In March, Elizabeth fell sick and remained in a [...] "settled and unremovable melancholy", and sat motionless on a cushion for hours on end. When Robert Cecil {{told her that she}} must go to bed, <b>she</b> <b>snapped</b> [...] "Must is not a word to use to princes, little man". She died on 24 March 1603 at Richmond Palace, between two and three in the morning. A few hours later, Cecil and the council set their plans in motion and proclaimed James VI of Scotland as James I of England.|$|E
500|$|Alongside {{a series}} of unpopular films, {{problems}} arose from Hepburn's attitude. She had a difficult relationship with the press, with whom she could be rude and provocative. When asked {{if she had any}} children, <b>she</b> <b>snapped</b> back, [...] "Yes I have five: two white and three colored." [...] She would not give interviews and denied requests for autographs, which earned her the nickname [...] "Katharine of Arrogance". The public was also baffled by her boyish behavior and fashion choices, and she became a largely unpopular figure. Hepburn sensed that she needed to leave Hollywood, so she returned east to star in a theatrical adaptation of Jane Eyre. It had a successful tour, but, uncertain about the script and unwilling to risk failure after the disaster of The Lake, Hepburn decided against taking the show to Broadway. Towards the end of 1936, Hepburn vied for the role of Scarlett O'Hara in Gone with the Wind. Producer David O. Selznick refused to offer her the part because he felt she had no sex appeal. He reportedly told Hepburn, [...] "I can't see Rhett Butler chasing you for twelve years." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 1962, Scepter Records {{released}} her first solo single, [...] "Don't Make Me Over", {{the title of}} which (according to the A Biography of Dionne Warwick) Warwick supplied herself when <b>she</b> <b>snapped</b> the phrase at producers Burt Bacharach and Hal David in anger. Warwick had found out that [...] "Make It Easy on Yourself" [...] — a song on which she had recorded the original demo and {{had wanted to be}} her first single release — had been given to another artist, Jerry Butler. [...] From the phrase [...] "don't make me over", Bacharach and David created their first top 40 pop hit (#21) and a top 5 U.S. R hit. Warrick's name was misspelled on the single's label, and she began using the new spelling (i.e., [...] "Warwick") both professionally and personally.|$|E

6000|$|... "Tons {{of money}} and really very presentable. Just the wife for a rising young politician. Go in and win her before <b>she's</b> <b>snapped</b> up by some fortune hunter." ...|$|R
6000|$|And {{before my}} friend be wholly hers, [...] How easy {{to prove to}} him, I said, [...] An eagle's the game her pride prefers, [...] Though <b>she</b> <b>snaps</b> at a wren instead! ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was no use}} {{putting things}} prettily to her when <b>she</b> <b>snapped</b> you up in this way.|$|E
60|$|Shady {{underwent}} a remarkable change, and stumbled in his backward retreat. Then <b>she</b> <b>snapped</b> {{her fingers in}} Moze's face.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>snapped</b> like an over-taut string, crumpled, {{clung to}} him, {{and without a}} word was weeping passionately in his arms.|$|E
6000|$|For {{an instant}} her heart thrilled with an unutterably sweet hope. Might he not forget in time? Need <b>she</b> <b>snap</b> in twain the {{weakened}} bond between them after all? Perhaps she might win back her lost sceptre, yet if-- ...|$|R
60|$|I let {{her come}} {{alongside}}, and then Juag and I pulled her in, <b>she</b> <b>snapping</b> and snarling {{at us as}} we did so; but, strange to relate, she didn't offer to attack us after we had ensconced her safely in the bottom alongside Raja.|$|R
50|$|Cyberbaiting is {{the term}} used to {{describe}} a new trend where students provoke their teacher until he or <b>she</b> <b>snaps.</b> The students will record the incident on a mobile phone and then post it online to embarrass the teacher and can even escalate to the teacher losing their job.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Speak for yourself!' <b>she</b> <b>snapped</b> {{through her}} sobs. 'I am only one-and- forty! [...] . Why didn't ye ride faster and {{overtake}} 'em!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We don't take transients," [...] <b>she</b> <b>snapped.</b> [...] "Only regular {{boarders}} with first-class references," [...] and {{she shut}} the door in Jerry's face.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Tidger sniffed derisively. [...] "You men are all alike," [...] <b>she</b> <b>snapped.</b> [...] "What do {{you think}} Ann wears that pink bodice for?" ...|$|E
50|$|There's tugging for a mastery, and buffetting for the breeches. He barks at her, <b>she</b> <b>snaps</b> at him; <b>she</b> breaks {{his wine}} glass, he her looking glass; she puts away his servants, {{he turns away}} hers; she locks her chamber door, he bolts his, begetting nothing but a world of strife and disorder.|$|R
5000|$|With a {{positive}} review, James Salmon from Yahoo! Music said: [...] "Just {{when you think}} she's about to grind to an insipid halt, <b>she</b> <b>snaps</b> out of it with good old fashioned pop rants against the male species ('Why'd You Lie To Me')." [...] Jose Promis from Allmusic compared it to a [...] "Destiny's Child-sounding".|$|R
6000|$|... "That's just it," [...] <b>she</b> <b>snaps</b> out; [...] "you can't. It {{would not}} be doing the {{straight}} thing by the family. No," [...] she says, [...] "I've spent their money, and I'm spending it now. They don't love me, but they shan't say as I have disgraced them. They've got their feelings same as I've got mine." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you. It isn't what {{it should}} be, but you have {{improved}} it," [...] he added, as <b>she</b> <b>snapped</b> the silver bracelet on her wrist.|$|E
6000|$|... "That was {{the only}} thing," [...] <b>she</b> <b>snapped,</b> [...] "that could have kept me from gettin' him! So far as I know, that {{was the only}} thing!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] <b>she</b> <b>snapped,</b> [...] "there's {{some people}} sick, and I guess there'll {{be more of}} 'em a good deal sicker in the morning. I've got to go." ...|$|E
50|$|Later at the morgue, Paul {{tries to}} steal Samantha's body once more, not having learned his lesson. Suddenly, Samantha grabs Paul's neck {{and her face}} rips apart, {{revealing}} a terrifying variant of BB's head. Her skin strips away, revealing half-robotic bones underneath. With a robotic voice, Samantha tells him to come with her. When Paul refuses, <b>she</b> <b>snaps</b> his neck off-screen, killing him.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>snaps</b> {{the soft}} bread {{from my hand}} in great [...] mouthfuls, [...] Opening her rather pretty wedge of an iron, [...] {{pristine}} face [...] Into an enormously wide-beaked mouth [...] Like sudden curved scissors, [...] And gulping at more than she can swallow, and [...] working her thick, soft tongue, [...] And having the bread hanging over her chin.|$|R
5000|$|Rawdon {{continues}} to see visions of her. Initially these visions help him—at home {{she gives him}} advice about parenting; in Portugal she softens his hardness; when he hides in the closet to isolate himself <b>she</b> <b>snaps</b> some sense into him and insists that Rawdon keep her mother, father and brother—Quincey's Grandparents (Jerry Hardin, Diane Hardin) and Uncle Jack (Don Michael Paul) - firmly in Quincey's life.|$|R
60|$|With an inarticulate cry she ran towards him, {{and tried}} to pull {{him away from the}} leech-like suckers. <b>She</b> <b>snapped</b> two of these tentacles, and their sap dripped red.|$|E
6000|$|The {{little girl}} deliberated; even this consecrated tie had become as a cord she must {{suddenly}} snap. But <b>she</b> <b>snapped</b> it very gently. [...] "Isn't it my turn for mamma?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm sure you're highly trustworthy!" [...] <b>she</b> <b>snapped,</b> and she {{sprang up}} without his aid. Then, smiling excessively, [...] "Uh--don't you think Carol {{sometimes}} fails to appreciate Dr. Will's ability?" ...|$|E
60|$|With {{these last}} words <b>she</b> <b>snaps</b> her teeth {{together}} {{as if her}} mouth closed with a spring. It is impossible to describe how Mr. Bucket gets her out, but he accomplishes that feat in a manner so peculiar to himself, enfolding and pervading her like a cloud, and hovering away with her {{as if he were}} a homely Jupiter and she the object of his affections.|$|R

6000|$|... 'And now <b>she</b> <b>snaps</b> me up if I say {{anything}} the least comprehensive or speculative, or if I {{laugh at the}} conventionalities Phoebe learns at the Holt.

6000|$|One of the women--and a good-looker she was--wrapped in {{a striped}} blanket, saw me pick {{up one of}} the {{stockings}} that was pretty chunky and heavy about the toe, and <b>she</b> <b>snapped</b> out: ...|$|E
