The series of experiments examines the potential for a spheromak device to contain fusion fuel. According to a 1999 abstract, ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA transition–Cherenkov {{electromagnetic}} emission by a {{femtosecond laser}} pulse propagating in a <b>self-induced</b> <b>plasma</b> channel in air {{has been very}} recently proposed as mechanism for production of terahertz (THz) radiation in the forward direction. In this paper, we study in detail {{the theory of the}} transition–Cherenkov process. The theoretical model is developed and compared with recent experimental results for several gases...|$|E
40|$|Detailed two {{dimensional}} particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations and numerical calculations of electron density profiles, {{based on a}} simplified model, were performed to show {{for the first time}} that underdense plasma, induced by two pairs of counterpropagating femtosecond-laser pulses in a gas, could be manipulated by ponderomotive-optical lattices to form periodic structures. These novel phenomena facilitate the localization and enhancement of the generating laser pulse intensities by the <b>self-induced</b> <b>plasma</b> photonic lattices (PPLs) and exhibit unique spatiotemporal dynamics. Variation of the initial plasma density profile and the configuration of the interacting pulses enabled control over the attainable PPL structures. It is predicted that by using a non-uniform initial plasma density, light emission in a preferred direction could be obtained...|$|E
40|$|According to a {{simplified}} costing algorithm of steady state fusion reactor power plant, the relative attractiveness of advanced physics modes mainly {{depends on the}} stability and non-inductive current drive of the equilibrium. The high stability beta and the good alignment of current profile with <b>plasma</b> <b>self-induced</b> current profile are compatible for the low aspect ratio neoclassical RFP equilibrium solved self-consistently considering the bootstrap current. The plasma stability {{is due to the}} hollow current profile making the magnetic shear increase locally and globally and the force-free region wide. The good alignment of current profile reduces significantly the requisite power for non-inductive current drive to generate the steady state magnetic configuration. As the result, the fusion power plant based on the neoclassical reversed field pinch (RFP) equilibrium with low aspect ratio offers the lowest cost of electricity.

40|$|The {{probability}} of avalanche, tunneling and multiphoton ionization induced by a CO{sub 2 } laser in H{sub 2 } gas has been calculated. Laser light screening by a <b>self-induced</b> <b>plasma</b> density gradient is considered as the limiting factor for upscaling a CO{sub 2 } laser-driven Inverse Cherenkov Laser Accelerator beyond 650 MeV/m. However, in near-resonance inverse Cherenkov acceleration where a shorter wavelength laser is used at a wavelength near the resonance {{of the gas}} (e. g. 248 nm in H{sub 2 }), {{the formation of a}} plasma is not a problem because the plasma density is below the critical density. In that case, the laser beam propagates unaffected through the plasma and the acceleration gradient is not limited by gas breakdown. Gradients > 1 GeV/m are possible...|$|E
40|$|Ultrashort laser pulses are {{generally}} preceded by prepulses which - {{in case of}} high main pulse intensities - may generate preplasmas on solid surfaces, thus making the initial conditions for the interactions ambiguous. Infrared laser systems applied successfully, with high efficiency <b>self-induced</b> <b>plasma</b> mirrors for improving the contrast of the beam. Short wavelength laser beams however have a larger critical density in the plasma, and due to their deeper penetration the absorption is higher, the reflectivity, and the corresponding plasma mirror efficiency is lower. We show herewith that with carefully planned boundary conditions plasma mirrors can reach up to 70 % efficiency even for KrF laser radiation. Our observations can be qualitatively explained by the classical Drude model. The high reflectivity allows the use of plasma mirrors even after the final amplification or before the last amplifier. Different arrangement proposals for its integration to our high power KrF laser system are given as well...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe provide {{guidelines}} to femtosecond laser users to select ad hoc laser parameters, namely the fluence and pulse duration, {{in the context}} of the development of ablation processes at the surface of dielectrics using single femtosecond pulses. Our results and discussion are based on a comprehensive experimental and theoretical analysis of the energy deposition process at the surface of fused silica samples and of their postmortem ablation characteristics, in the range of intensities from 10 (13) to 10 (15) W/cm(2). We show experimentally and numerically that <b>self-induced</b> <b>plasma</b> transient properties at the pulse timescale dramatically determine the efficiency of energy deposition and affect the resulting ablation morphology. In practice, we determine that the precise measurement of two characteristic fluence values, namely the laser-induced ablation threshold F (th,LIAT) and the fluence F (opt) for maximum ablation efficiency, are only required to qualify the outcomes of laser ablation at the surface of a dielectric in an extended range of applied fluence...|$|E
