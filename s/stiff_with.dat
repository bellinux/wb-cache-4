5|$|Although Tsukudani kept a {{notebook}} with story ideas, she admitted that {{on many occasions}} the theme of a chapter {{was born out of}} her own daydreams. Once she decided on a theme, she had the characters move around in her head and then worked out the plot and storyboard. Since she had a solid grasp on who the characters were, she noted that they moved around for her on their own. Conversely, if the characters were <b>stiff</b> <b>with</b> a given theme, Tsukudani could not develop an interesting story and moved on to another idea. The theme developed for the manga serialized in Febri had to do with bonus aspects to the story that she was unable to draw in the main serialization, as well as events that occurred between chapters in the main story.|$|E
25|$|Williams leads series 10–7. Once {{considered}} one of the best rivalries in women's tennis, the competition between Williams and Capriati was <b>stiff</b> <b>with</b> 12 out of their 17 meetings going to three sets. The rivalry, starting in 1999, started off one sided with Capriati winning four of their first five matches. Serena would then go on to win the next eight. Williams and Capriati played with similar styles, both known for using their power and athleticism to gain quick advantages in points.|$|E
25|$|Consistent {{with her}} early career, Cox's style leaned more toward {{vaudeville}} than blues. She had a less powerful and less rugged voice than her better-known contemporaries Bessie Smith and Ma Rainey, but {{she held her}} audiences spellbound with the fiery spirit of her delivery. At {{the height of the}} classic female blues era, competition was <b>stiff,</b> <b>with</b> numerous talented blueswomen performing, and Cox's singing was only part of her act. Nevertheless, as her career developed, she assumed and embodied the title bestowed on her, “The Uncrowned Queen of the Blues”. Onstage, she exuded a glamorous sophistication and confidence that captivated her fans. She also embellished her stage presence with a stylish wardrobe, which often included a tiara, cape and rhinestone wand.|$|E

30|$|With {{regard to}} the {{interpretation}} of transmitral blood flow, at initial stages of LVDD the LV becomes <b>stiffer</b> <b>with</b> impaired LV relaxation and the LA-to-LV gradient becomes smaller. Therefore, the early filling wave gradually decreases and the atrial wave becomes dominant (E[*]<[*]A wave): This is the classical features of LVDD grade I (second column from the left in Fig.  1).|$|R
25|$|James Augustus Grant, in {{his book}} A Walk across Africa (1864), {{describes}} how his leg became grossly swollen and <b>stiff</b> <b>with</b> later a copious discharge. This was almost certainly the severe edematous form of the disease, and is the first known description of the infection. Buruli ulcer disease was identified in 1897 by Sir Albert Cook, a British physician, at Mengo Hospital in Kampala, Uganda. A {{detailed description of the}} disease was written in 1948 by Professor Peter MacCallum and his colleagues, who were treating patients from the Bairnsdale district, near Melbourne, Australia. They were the first to identify Mycobacterium ulcerans as the pathogen causing it. The disease was so named after Buruli County in Uganda (now called Nakasongola District), because of the many cases that occurred there in the 1960s. The incidence of the disease has recently been rising in tropical Africa.|$|E
25|$|Later that spring, Scott {{returned}} to her beginnings as a comedian when she began work on her first comedy noir, Scared <b>Stiff,</b> <b>with</b> Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis. Scott played an heiress who inherits a haunted castle on Lost Island {{off the coast of}} Cuba. Though Scott had fond memories of working on the set in the years ahead, at the time of filming, she found it trying. Scott found Lewis' impersonations of her offensive, while a jealous Hal Wallis instructed the director, George Marshall, not to let the romantic scenes between Scott and Martin get too steamy. Despite Scott's best efforts, including making excuses for Lewis' behavior to the press, most of her scenes ended up on the cutting-room floor. Shooting took place late May to mid-July 1952. The film premiered the week of 28 May 1953 in Los Angeles. Despite the negative experience and reviews, Scared Stiff remains Scott's third favorite film.|$|E
500|$|One {{advantage}} that mechanical filters have over LC electrical filters {{is that they}} can be made very stable. The resonance frequency can be made so stable that it varies only 1.5parts per billion (ppb) from the specified value over the operating temperature range (...) , and its average drift with time can be as low as 4ppb per day. This stability with temperature is another reason for using nickel-iron as the resonator material. Variations with temperature in the resonance frequency (and other features of the frequency function) are directly related to variations in the Young's modulus, which is a measure of stiffness of the material. [...] Materials are therefore sought that have a small temperature coefficient of Young's modulus. [...] In general, Young's modulus has a negative temperature coefficient (materials become less <b>stiff</b> <b>with</b> increasing temperature) but additions of small amounts of certain other elements in the alloy can produce a material with a temperature coefficient that changes sign from negative through zero to positive with temperature. Such a material will have a zero coefficient of temperature with resonance frequency around a particular temperature. It is possible to adjust the point of zero temperature coefficient to a desired position by heat treatment of the alloy.|$|E

30|$|We {{wanted to}} see whether the score could be used to predict ease of correction. From experience, we had learned that an older child {{requires}} more casting and we agreed {{that it was important to}} incorporate a multiplier variable according to the age of the child into our final score. As all elements are made <b>stiffer</b> <b>with</b> age, it was helpful to multiply the combined elements by this factor.|$|R
2500|$|In Pier Paolo Pasolini's Mamma Roma (1962), Magnani is {{both the}} mother and the whore, playing an irrepressible prostitute {{determined}} to give her teenage son a respectable middle-class life. Mamma Roma, while one of Magnani's critically acclaimed films, was not released in the United States until 1995, deemed too controversial thirty years earlier. By now she was frustrated at being typecast in the roles of poor women. Magnani in 1963 commented [...] "I’m bored <b>stiff</b> <b>with</b> these everlasting parts as a hysterical, loud, working-class woman".|$|E
2500|$|Freshwater anglers {{can also}} find {{trolling}} effective. Recreational fishermen can successfully troll lakes and reservoirs for salmon and trout. It can be the method of choice for catching the elusive muskie, and a useful technique for catching walleye, black bass and striped bass. For light and medium freshwater gamefishing, any reasonably robust casting or spinning rod {{can be used as}} a trolling rod. Effective trolling rods should be fairly <b>stiff</b> <b>with</b> a relatively fast action, since [...] "whippy" [...] slow action rods are frustrating to troll with.|$|E

Caroline's mother was Scottish, the daughter of a landed gentleman, Col. Sir James Callander of Craigforth and Lady Elizabeth MacDonnell, the sister of an Irish peer, the 1st Marquess of Antrim.
