He married Ministry of Finance bureaucrat Satsuki Katayama in 1986; they were divorced in 1989 and Katayama later {{became a member of}} the Diet. Masuzoe is known to have five children, three of which were born out of wedlock by two other women; one of his children, aged 25 as of 2014, is <b>seriously</b> <b>disabled,</b> and Masuzoe's negotiations with the child's mother over support payments drew attention in the Japanese tabloid press. Prime Minister Abe said that he wanted Katayama more than anyone else to stand in support of Masuzoe's 2014 gubernatorial bid, but Katayama responded that it was difficult for her to do so given the state of the negotiations. The magazine Nikkan Gendai reported in 2007 that Masuzoe held a wedding ceremony with another Japanese woman in France (but was not legally married to her) before marrying his first wife.|$|E

His superiors told author Philpott that {{had it not been}} for Thompson's status as a hero, he would have been dismissed from service because of his alcoholism. In 1981, while still on active duty, Thompson suffered a massive heart attack and a severe stroke. He was in a coma for months and was left <b>seriously</b> <b>disabled.</b> He was paralyzed on one side and could speak only in brief phrases for the rest of his life.|$|E
2500|$|A new pension for “severely handicapped” persons was {{introduced}} in 1972, along with occupational injury annuities and a special pension for long-standing insurant {{from the age of}} 63 and a pension due to “limited earning capacity” from the age of 62. In addition, a special pension benefit {{was introduced}} for workers aged 60 and above after unemployment. Under the Severely Handicapped Persons Act of April 1974, a <b>seriously</b> <b>disabled</b> person could retire early on an old age pension at the age of 62 years, provided that he “complied with the other provisions of the legislation on pension insurance.” ...|$|E

2500|$|There was determined, by {{statutory}} regulation issued in February 1970, {{the category of}} persons most <b>seriously</b> <b>disabled</b> “to whom, with regard to maintenance aid, an increased demand (50% of the appropriate rate) is being conceded, and, {{within the scope of}} relief in special living conditions: a higher rate of nursing aid.” In 1971, the retirement age for miners was lowered to 50. An April 1972 law providing for [...] "promotion of social aid services" [...] aimed to remedy, through various beneficial measures (particularly in the field of national insurance and working conditions), the staff-shortage suffered by social establishments in their medico-social, educational and other work. A bill to harmonize re-education benefit and another bill relating to severely handicapped persons became law in May and September 1972 respectively. In 1972, winter payments for construction workers were introduced.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} February Tattnall laid {{plans for}} an amphibious assault on the two {{advanced}} batteries at Venus Point and Oakley Island. General Lee personally interceded. Preparations at Old Fort Jackson were not completed. Although Tattnall's flagship had been put back into service since the Squadron's January resupply sortie, {{one of the three}} gunboats was still <b>seriously</b> <b>disabled.</b> Lee reasoned that if Tattnall's plan failed, the city itself would be open to attack. The three-to-seven exchange had not gone well for the defenders of Savannah. A possible two-to-seven match against ships with superior armament did not promise better. No further consideration was given to relief of the Fort; in any case, it had perhaps sixteen weeks of provisions left in store. Meanwhile, Federal emplacements continued to improve on Jones and Bird islands, Venus Point and other points along the river. [...] During the Federal bombardment of Fort Pulaski, April 10–11, “Old Savannah” participated in counter-battery fire with besieging Union guns.|$|E

From what that poor fellow said, the pirates have about five hours' start of us, and as they can have no idea that they are pursued, we can doubtless {{overtake}} them before they reach Sardinia. The question is, ought we to pursue them at once, or ought we to coast along until we find Visconti's galley? Three of these Tripoli pirates, crowded as they always are with men, would prove serious opponents, yet we might engage them with a fair hope of victory. But we may be <b>seriously</b> <b>disabled</b> in the fight, and should be, perhaps, unable to carry the news to Genoa that there are many pirate ships gathering on the coast of Sardinia to prey upon their commerce." ...|$|E

40|$|Constructing a {{eukaryotic}} cilium/flagellum is {{a demanding}} task requiring {{the transport of}} proteins from their cytoplasmic synthesis site into a spatially and environmentally distinct cellular compartment. The clear potential hazard is that import of aberrant proteins could <b>seriously</b> <b>disable</b> cilia/flagella assembly or turnover processes. Here, we reveal that tubulin protein destined for incorporation into axonemal microtubules interacts with a tubulin cofactor C (TBCC) domain-containing protein that is specifically located at the mature basal body transitional fibres. RNA interference-mediated ablation of this protein results in axonemal microtubule defects but no effect on other microtubule populations within the cell. Bioinformatics analysis indicates that this protein belongs to a clade of flagellum-specific TBCC-like proteins that includes the human protein, XRP 2, mutations which lead to certain forms of the hereditary eye disease retinitis pigmentosa. Taken with other observations regarding the role of transitional fibres in cilium/flagellum assembly, we suggest that a localized protein processing capacity embedded at transitional fibres ensures the ‘quality’ of tubulin imported into the cilium/flagellum, and further, that loss of a ciliary/flagellar quality control capability may underpin a number of human genetic disorders...|$|R
40|$|Amiodarone was {{administered}} to 80 patients with recurrent cardiac tachyarrhythmias previously resistant to drug treatment. Forty nine patients were treated for ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation and 31 for supra-ventricular arrhythmias. The mean (range six days to 51 months), permitting a total of 100 patient years of observation. Adverse reactions were observed in 69 patients. Severe side effects were encountered in 13 : four patients developed interstitial pneumonitis, four patients developed incessant ventricular tachycardia, three patients taking amiodarone and digoxin sustained sinus node arrest with depression of escape foci, one patient developed hepatitis, and one patient developed hypercalcaemia with renal failure. Furthermore, {{a rise in the}} serum concentration of digoxin and potentiation of warfarin anticoagulation occurred in cases in which these agents were combined with amiodarone. Amiodarone was stopped in 14 patients because of side effects. Although amiodarone is effective in suppressing arrhythmias in most patients in whom extensive use of antiarrhythmic drugs has been unsuccessful, it is associated with diverse and serious toxicity. These observations suggest that at present the use of amiodarone should be reserved for patients with life threatening or <b>seriously</b> <b>disabling</b> arrhythmias in whom longer established drugs have been ineffective or are contraindicated...|$|R
40|$|Amyotrophic lateral {{sclerosis}} (ALS) is {{a progressive}} and <b>seriously</b> <b>disabling</b> adult-onset neurological disease. Accumulating {{evidence indicates that}} various miRNAs, expressed in a spatially and temporally controlled manner in the brain, {{play a key role}} in neuronal development. In addition, misregulation of microRNAs contributes to some mental disorders and neurodegeneration diseases. Here, we analyzed the expression profiles of 911 human miRNAs using microarray technology in leukocytes, the most readily available human tissue cells, obtained from 8 patients affected by sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (sALS) and 12 healthy controls. An independent group of 14 sALS patients and 14 controls was used for validation by TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction assay. We identified 8 miRNAs that were significantly up- or downregulated in sALS patients as compared to healthy controls. The significant variations in miRNAs profiles detected in leukocytes have been related to miRNAs predominantly expressed in the nervous system. One of these miRNAs, miR- 338 - 3 p, has previously been shown to be de-regulated in ALS brains. This study, for the first time, detected specific microRNAs disease-related changes at an earlier stage of sALS. We suggest that miRNAs profiles found in the peripheral blood leukocytes from sALS patients can be relevant to understand the pathogenesis of sALS and/or used as biomarkers of the disease...|$|R
