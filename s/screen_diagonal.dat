50|$|The {{shift from}} 16:10 to 16:9 {{was met with}} a mixed response. The lower cost of 16:9 {{computer}} displays, along with their suitability for gaming and movies and the convenience of having the same aspect ratio in different devices, {{was seen as a}} positive. On the other hand, there was criticism towards the lack of vertical screen real estate when compared to 16:10 displays of the same <b>screen</b> <b>diagonal.</b> For this reason, some considered 16:9 displays less suitable for productivity-oriented tasks, such as editing documents or spreadsheets and using design or engineering applications, which are mostly designed for taller, rather than wider screens.|$|E

Strong compensation between diagonal and off-diagonal contributions is found.

40|$|In this paper, {{we explore}} how to add {{pointing}} input capabilities to very small screen devices. On first sight, touchscreens seem {{to allow for}} particular compactness, because they integrate input and screen into the same physical space. The opposite is true, however, because the user’s fingers occlude contents and prevent precision. We argue {{that the key to}} touch-enabling very small devices is to use touch on the device backside. In order to study this, we have created a 2. 4 ” prototype device; we simulate screens smaller than that by masking the screen. We present a user study in which participants completed a pointing task successfully across display sizes when using a back-of device interface. The touchscreen-based control condition (enhanced with the shift technique), in contrast, failed for <b>screen</b> <b>diagonals</b> below 1 inch.

50|$|The 7JP4 {{is part of}} the 7JPx {{series of}} {{circular}} face electrostatic cathode ray tubes (CRT). Originally developed for radar applications as a display device for radar display A scopes around 1944. After World War 2 the CRT was adapted for television applications. There are three versions. The 7JP4 (P4 represents the phosphor that glows white and has medium persistence) for television. For oscilloscope applications the 7JP1 was used (P1 phosphor has a green trace and short persistence). Radar applications the 7JP7 was used (P7 phosphor has a blue-white trace with a long persistence). This CRT was produced by multiple manufacturers (RCA, General Electric, Sylvania Electric Products and Tung-sol). Except for the type of phosphor used all three are identical in operation and connection. The <b>screen</b> <b>diagonal</b> is 7 inches (17.8 cm) for 7JP1 and 7JP4, but only 5.5 inches (14 cm) for the 7JP7.|$|E
5000|$|The {{method of}} {{measuring}} screen size by its diagonal was {{inherited from the}} method used for {{the first generation of}} CRT television, when picture tubes with circular faces were in common use. Being circular, the external diameter of the bulb was used to describe their size. Since these circular tubes were used to display rectangular images, the diagonal measurement of the visible rectangle was smaller than the diameter of the tube due to the thickness of the glass surrounding the phosphor screen (which was hidden from the viewer by the casing and bezel). This method continued even when cathode ray tubes were manufactured as rounded rectangles; it had the advantage of being a single number specifying the size, and was not confusing when the aspect ratio was universally 4:3. In the US, when virtually all TV tubes were 4:3, the size of the screen was given as the true <b>screen</b> <b>diagonal</b> with a V following it (this was a requirement in the US market but not elsewhere). In virtually all other markets, the size of the outer diameter of the tube was given. What was a 27V in the US could be a 28" [...] elsewhere. However the V terminology was frequently dropped in US advertising referring to a 27V as a 27". This was not misleading for the consumer as the seller had to give the actual screen size by law. Flat panel displays by contrast use the actual diagonal of their visible display size, thus the size is the actual size presented to the viewer in all markets. This means that a similarly specified size of display will be larger as a flat panel display compared with a cathode ray tube display.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{response}} to the challenge of providing a large area avionics display for the E- 2 D AHE aircraft. The resulting display design provides a pilot with high-resolution visual information content covering an image area of almost three square feet (Active Area of Samsung display = 33. 792 cm x 27. 0336 cm = 13. 304 ” x 10. 643 ” = 141. 596 square inches = 0. 983 sq. ft x 3 = 2. 95 sq. ft). The avionics display application, design and performance being described is the Primary Flight Display for the E- 2 D Advanced Hawkeye aircraft. This cockpit display has a <b>screen</b> <b>diagonal</b> size of 17 inches. Three displays, with minimum bezel width, just fit within the available instrument panel area. The significant design constraints of supporting an upgrade installation have been addressed. These constraints include a display image size that is larger than the mounting opening in the instrument panel. This, therefore, requires that the Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) window, LCD panel and backlight all fit within the limited available bezel depth. High brightness and a wide dimming range are supported with a dual mode Cold Cathode Fluorescent Tube (CCFT) and LED backlight. Packaging constraints dictated the use of multiple U shaped fluorescent lamps in a direct view backlight design for a maximum display brightness of 300 foot-Lamberts. The low intensity backlight levels are provided by remote LEDs coupled through a fiber optic mesh. This architecture generates luminous uniformity within a minimum backlight depth.

40|$|Global {{navigation}} satellite systems are increasingly {{part of our}} lives and many industries including aviation. Glider flying is no exception in this trend. Global {{navigation satellite}} systems were part of gliding since the early 1990 s. First as official recording devices for simple evidence of sporting performances, then as navigation systems, anti-collision systems and emergency location transmitters. Development of recording application was initiated and supported by International Gliding Commission of World Air Sports Federation in way of certifications for flight recorders. The use of navigation and other modern instruments in gliders has brought many benefits but also risks. However, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages and these systems are now integral part of gliding. With this wide usage of global navigation satellite systems devices, there is great many possibilities how and in which way one can use these systems. Pilots must orient themselves in varied selection of products, which they can use to choose one solution, that fits him. Therefore, to find out how and if pilots use these devices, we created questionnaire survey among 143 Czech glider pilots. We found out, that 84 % of them are using global navigation satellite systems devices for official record of flight and for navigation as well. More than half of pilots is using free, not built-in devices. Most common devices are mobile phones up to 5 inches of <b>screen</b> <b>diagonal</b> in combination with approved flight recorder without display.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, {{consumer}} television sets have substantially increased in screen size, with <b>screen</b> <b>diagonals</b> up to 65 -inch and beyond. At the same time, their thickness has decreased {{to only a}} few centimeters. Right from the start, this combination has been highly appreciated by consumers, resulting in a fast acceptance of flat-screen televisions in the consumer market. However, the visible light generation and modulation technologies in flat-screen displays differ considerably from those in conventional cathode-ray tubes. As a consequence, the rendered images on these displays may look different. To understand differences in perceived images, it seems obvious to ask consumers for their opinion. In practice, perception experiments with consumers are often complicated, time consuming, and expensive. To aid display designers in optimizing the image quality without conducting perception experiments, a framework for predicting image quality {{on the basis of}} technical display parameters has been proposed in literature. In this framework, technical display parameters need to be linked to physical display characteristics, i. e., things we can measure, which in turn need to be linked to things we perceive, i. e., the perceptual attributes. The final image quality judgment is based on a combination of all perceptual attributes. In the context of this framework, display engineers mainly focus on describing the physical display characteristics, whereas psychologists concentrate on evaluating the perceptual attributes and their relation to image quality. In this thesis, the missing link is addressed and psychophysical relations are established between three physical flat-screen display characteristics and their related perceptual attributes. The performance of LCDs under oblique viewing angles is characterized and a new definition for the viewing angle range is proposed. A model is developed to predict flicker visibility for scanning backlight LCDs. Finally, a methodology is provided to enable the characterization of the LCD's motion performance.

40|$|Integration {{of organic}} {{light-emitting}} diodes (OLED) onto silicon substrates (wafers) allows embedding highly efficient emitters CMOS integrated circuitry (IC) and therefore novel optoelectronic devices for (micro-) displays and sensors. Based on that combination various requirements regarding design and technology interfaces arise, e. g., on OLED device modelling, interaction of active CMOS and OLED devices, electro-optical simulation and testing, CMOS/OLED material and structure interface. Moreover, certain applications demand strong area minimization of underlying analog circuitry, specifically pixel cells in OLED microdisplays. "Microdisplays" are usually {{referred to as}} very small displays featuring a <b>screen</b> <b>diagonal</b> < 1 ", that require optical magnification to be resolved by the human eye. Thus, microdisplays based on OLEDs {{can be used for}} Near-To-Eye (NTE) applications such as viewfinders, head mounted displays (HMD) and as mentioned in [1] also for microprojection units. The maximum luminance for these applications can range from 100 Cd/m² for non-see-through video glasses and viewfinders, up to 10, 000 Cd/m² for see-through applications or even more for microprojection units. Requirements for microdisplay backplanes, which can cover all of these applications, are small pixel pitch (< 15 µm), small display size (< 0. 6 "), low power consumption (few mW), good linearity between video input signal and light output (grayscale), good homogeneity of the display luminance and possibly - depending on application-specific luminance - high driving voltage capability (up to 10 V) of the pixel circuit. Since active CMOS devices (transistors [...] .) are already part of the OLED microdisplay backplane for driving its pixels, integration of CMOS-inherent sensors appears obvious. Specifically adding optical sensors (e. g., CMOS photodiodes) to the OLED emitters allows completely new features for microdisplays. A so-called bi-directional OLED microdisplay combines a display matrix and a camera on a single chip, enabling interactive displays [2]. Embedded into a NTE setup such microdisplay projects an image onto the user's eye, and in optically opposite direction is capable in detecting the users's eye and its conscious and unconscious movements, therefore performing gaze control and interaction with the display content. The presentation provides an overview on technology, design and application...|$|E
