40|$|Our {{understanding}} of the molecular processes which regulate cardiac function has grown immeasurably in recent years. Even {{with the advent of}} ?-blockers, angiotensin inhibitors and calcium modulating agents, heart failure (HF) still remains a <b>seriously</b> <b>debilitating</b> and life-threatening <b>condition.</b> Here, we review the molecular changes which occur in the heart in response to increased load and the pathways which control cardiac hypertrophy, calcium homeostasis, and immune activation during HF. These can occur as a result of genetic mutation in the case of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) or as a result of ischemic or hypertensive heart disease. In the majority of cases, calcineurin and CaMK respond to dysregulated calcium signaling and adrenergic drive is increased, each of which has a role to play in controlling blood pressure, heart rate, and left ventricular function. Many major pathways for pathological remodeling converge on a set of transcriptional regulators such as myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF 2), nuclear factors of activated T cells (NFAT), and GATA 4 and these are opposed by the action of the natriuretic peptides ANP and BNP. Epigenetic modification has emerged in recent years as a major influence cardiac physiology and histone acetyl transferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) are now known to both induce and antagonize hypertrophic growth. The newly emerging roles of microRNAs in regulating left ventricular dysfunction and fibrosis also has great potential for novel therapeutic intervention. Finally, we discuss the role of the immune system in mediating left ventricular dysfunction and fibrosis and ways this can be targeted in the setting of viral myocarditis. <br/...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: River {{blindness}} is a <b>seriously</b> <b>debilitating</b> disease {{caused by}} the filarial parasite Onchocerca volvulus, which infects millions in Africa {{as well as in}} South and Central America. Research has been hampered by a lack of good animal models, as the parasite can only develop fully in humans and some primates. This review highlights the development of two animal model systems that have allowed significant advances in recent years and hold promise for the future. Experimental findings with Litomosoides sigmodontis in mice and Onchocerca ochengi in cattle are placed in the context of how these models can advance our ability to control the human disease...|$|R
