40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to analyse the readability of paediatric oral health education leaflets available in Australia. METHODS: Forty paediatric oral health education materials were analysed for general readability according to the following parameters: Thoroughness; Textual framework; Terminology; and Readability (Flesch-Kincaid grade level (FKGL), Gunning Fog index (Fog) and Simplified Measure of Gobbledygook (SMOG)). RESULTS: Leaflets produced by the industry were among the hardest to read with an average readability at the 8 th grade (8. 4 ± 0. 1). The readability of leaflets produced by the commercial sector was at the 7 th grade (7. 1 ± 1. 7) and the government at the 6 th grade (6. 3 ± 1. 9). The FKGL consistently yielded readabilities 2 grades below the Fog and <b>SMOG</b> <b>indexes.</b> In the content analyses, 14 essential paediatric oral health topics were noted and Early Childhood Caries (ECC) was identified as the most commonly used jargon term. CONCLUSION: Paediatric oral health education materials are readily available, yet their quality and readability vary widely and may be difficult to read for disadvantaged populations in Australia. A redesign of these leaflets while taking literacy into consideration is suggested. Amit Arora, Andy SF Lam, Zahra Karami, Loc Giang Do and Mark Fort Harri...|$|R

This study compares the readability level of English medical texts and their corresponding Persian translations. In this study, 50 translated booklets and their corresponding texts in English were assessed – all these booklets are translated versions of BMA publications and kept in Iran's National Library. Comparisons of these texts were made using Gunning Fog <b>Index</b> and <b>SMOG</b> Readability <b>Index</b> Grade. Then, significant difference between the data obtained from English medical texts and their Persian translations were made. A significant difference was observed between the number of multi-syllables words and readability scores in English medical texts and their corresponding Persian texts, but no significant difference was observed between the number of words and sentences in these two groups. Therefore, it is necessary to omit needless words, use fewer complex (multi-syllabuses) words, and use shorter sentences...|$|R

The quality of each leaflet {{was assessed using}} the DISCERN instrument. The readability of each leaflet was assessed using the Flesch Reading Ease instrument, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level and Simple Measure of Gobbledygook (<b>SMOG)</b> <b>index.</b> Descriptive statistics followed by univariate analysis was conducted.|$|E
30|$|In this study, {{the median}} Flesch Reading Ease, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, and <b>SMOG</b> <b>index</b> scores were 70 (IQR 53.3 – 73.9), 7.2 (IQR 6 – 9.7), and 7.3 (IQR 6.7 – 9.1) respectively. In {{relation}} to the UK population this suggests the PILs {{included in this study}} are written at not the appropriate reading age and are fairly difficult to read. Differences between the readability of PILs from the two societies were also detected. In comparison to the BOS PILs, the AAO PILs achieved lower Flesch Reading Ease scores (− 22.30, 95  % CI: − 26.77, 17.83, p[*]<[*] 0.001) and higher Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (3.80, 95  % CI: 2.74, 4.86, p[*]<[*] 0.001) and <b>SMOG</b> <b>index</b> (2.60, 95  % CI: 1.82, 3.38, p[*]<[*] 0.001) scores. These findings suggest AAO PILs are fairly difficult to read and aimed at individuals with a higher reading age compared to BOS PILs and the recommended reading age level (Tables  3 and 4). For the total sample there was no apparent difference between the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level and <b>SMOG</b> <b>index</b> scores. When the BOS PILs and AAO PILs were compared a slightly lower SMOG score was detected. Previous readability assessments of dental practice leaflets have reported the reverse finding and attributed to this to the higher level of comprehension that is required to validate the SMOG test resulting in a higher score [16]. This apparent disparity confirms that the results of readability formulae only provide an estimate of reading level and should be used as a guide [16].|$|E
40|$|Pregnant women {{actively}} seek {{health information}} online, including nutrition and food-related topics. However, the accuracy and readability {{of this information}} have not been evaluated. The {{aim of this study}} was to describe and evaluate pregnancy-related food and nutrition information available online. Four search engines were used to search for pregnancy-related nutrition web pages. Content analysis of web pages was performed. Web pages were assessed against the 2013 Australian Dietary Guidelines to assess accuracy. Flesch-Kincaid (F-K), Simple Measure of Gobbledygook (<b>SMOG),</b> Gunning Fog <b>Index</b> (FOG) and Flesch reading ease (FRE) formulas were used to assess readability. Data was analysed descriptively. Spearman's correlation was used to assess the relationship between web page characteristics. Kruskal-Wallis test was used to check for differences among readability and other web page characteristics. A total of 693 web pages were included. Web page types included commercial (n= 340), not-for-profit (n= 113), blogs (n= 112), government (n= 89), personal (n= 36) and educational (n= 3). The accuracy of online nutrition information varied with 39. 7 % of web pages containing accurate information, 22. 8 % containing mixed information and 37. 5 % containing inaccurate information. The average reading grade of all pages analysed measured by F-K, SMOG and FOG was 11. 8. The mean FRE was 51. 6, a 'fairly difficult to read' score. Only 0. 5 % of web pages were written at or below grade 6 according to F-K, SMOG and FOG. The findings suggest that accuracy of pregnancy-related nutrition information is a problem on the internet. Web page readability is generally difficult and means that the information may not be accessible to those who cannot read at a sophisticated level. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Electronic health records (EHRs) are a rich {{resource}} for developing applications to engage patients and foster patient activation, thus holding a strong potential to enhance patient-centered care. Studies {{have shown that}} providing patients with access to their own EHR notes may improve the understanding of their own clinical conditions and treatments, leading to improved health care outcomes. However, the highly technical language in EHR notes impedes patients 2 ̆ 7 comprehension. Numerous studies have evaluated the difficulty of health-related text using readability formulas such as Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL), Simple Measure of Gobbledygook (<b>SMOG),</b> and Gunning-Fog <b>Index</b> (GFI). They conclude that the materials are often written at a grade level higher than common recommendations. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our {{study was to explore}} the relationship between the aforementioned readability formulas and the laypeople 2 ̆ 7 s perceived difficulty on 2 genres of text: general health information and EHR notes. We also validated the formulas 2 ̆ 7 appropriateness and generalizability on predicting difficulty levels of highly complex technical documents. METHODS: We collected 140 Wikipedia articles on diabetes and 242 EHR notes with diabetes International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision code. We recruited 15 Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) users to rate difficulty levels of the documents. Correlations between laypeople 2 ̆ 7 s perceived difficulty levels and readability formula scores were measured, and their difference was tested. We also compared word usage and the impact of medical concepts of the 2 genres of text. RESULTS: The distributions of both readability formulas 2 ̆ 7 scores (P 3 ̆c. 001) and laypeople 2 ̆ 7 s perceptions (P=. 002) on the 2 genres were different. Correlations of readability predictions and laypeople 2 ̆ 7 s perceptions were weak. Furthermore, despite being graded at similar levels, documents of different genres were still perceived with different difficulty (P 3 ̆c. 001). Word usage in the 2 related genres still differed significantly (P 3 ̆c. 001). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested that the readability formulas 2 ̆ 7 predictions did not align with perceived difficulty in either text genre. The widely used readability formulas were highly correlated with each other but did not show adequate correlation with readers 2 ̆ 7 perceived difficulty. Therefore, they were not appropriate to assess the readability of EHR notes...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{package leaflet}} {{included}} in the packaging of all medicinal products {{plays an important role}} in the transmission of medicine-related information to patients. Therefore, in 2009, the European Commission published readability guidelines to try to ensure that the information contained in the package leaflet is understood by patients. Objective: The main objective of this study was to calculate and compare the readability levels and length (number of words) of the package leaflets for biological medicines in 2007, 2010, and 2013. Methods: Thesampleofthisstudyincluded 36 biologicalmedicinepackageleafletsthatweredownloadedfromtheEuropean Medicines Agency website in three different years: 2007, 2010, and 2013. The readability of the selected package leaflets was obtained using the following readability formulas: SMOG grade, Flesch-Kincaid grade level, and Szigriszt's perspicuity index. The length (number of words) of the package leaflets was also measured. Afterwards, the relationship between these quantitative variables (three readability indexes and length) and categorical (or qualitative) variables were analyzed. The categorical variables were the year when the package leaflet was downloaded, the package leaflet section, type of medicine, year of authorization of biological medicine, and marketing authorization holder. Results: The readability values of all the package leaflets exceeded the sixth-grade reading level, which is the recommended value for health-related written materials. No statistically significant differences were found between the three years of study in the readability indexes, although differences were observed in the case of the length (P=. 002), which increased over the study period. When the relationship between readability indexes and length and the other variables was analyzed, statistically significant differences were found between package leaflet sections (P<. 001) and between the groups of medicine only with regard to the length over the three studied years (P=. 002 in 2007, P=. 007 in 2010, P=. 009 in 2013). Linear correlation was observed between the readability <b>indexes</b> (<b>SMOG</b> grade and Flesch-Kincaid grade level: r 2 =. 92; SMOG grade and Szigriszt's perspicuity index: r 2 =. 81; Flesch-Kincaid grade level and Szigriszt's perspicuity index: r 2 =. 95), but not between the readability indexes and the length (length and SMOG grade: r 2 =. 05; length and Flesch-Kincaid grade level: r 2 =. 03; length and Szigriszt's perspicuity index: r 2 =. 02). Conclusions: There was no improvement in the readability of the package leaflets studied between 2007 and 2013 despite the European Commission's 2009 guideline on the readability of package leaflets. The results obtained from the different readability formulas coincided from a qualitative point of view. Efforts to improve the readability of package leaflets for biological medicines are required to promote the understandability and accessibility of this online health information by patients and thereby contribute to the appropriate use of medicines and medicine safety...|$|R

40|$|English as {{the first}} foreign {{language}} has expanded a lot especially in Indonesia. It does not only have an important position in the educational system {{but it is also}} the key which opens doors to scientific and technological knowledge, which is needed for the economic and political development. Since the position of English is important in the educational system, many English proponents publish many kinds of English textbook used by students at schools. However, in the reality is that not all the English textbook can fulfill the criteria of readability. The suitability of the reading materials to the learner's competence and experience will determine the student's achievement in the reading class. If the materials are within the students’ range of competence and experience, he will experience a sense of achievement in reading. Thus, his desire for reading will increase gradually, and surely his ability to read will also develop. Some experts state that there are five components that greatly influence the readability of reading materials; structures, vocabulary, background knowledge, personal interest, illustrations. These components are interrelated to one another; the absence of the requirement of only one component has already influenced the readability of the materials for the intended readers. Accordingly, the writer is interested in making a descriptive study to measure the readability of reading materials in a text book. The descriptive study which is used to investigate the readability of reading materials in a textbook have been done by two researchers Wiyono (1988) and Suryawati (1989)). However, there are some shortcomings in their researches. The first shortcoming lies on the textbook which is used by Wiyono (1988). In the text book entitled "Penuntun Pelajaran Bahasa Inggris Berdasarkan Kurikulum 1984 " there is not illustrations at all in it. Whereas illustration is a very important factor to determine the readability of a text book. The second shortcoming is found in Suryawati’s thesis (1989) in which she used <b>SMOG</b> and Fog <b>index</b> for knowing whether the reading materials which have been analyzed by her, are suitable or not for Senior High School level. In reality these formulas are not suitable to be applied in Indonesia as they are devised for use with L 1 learners. The two conditions above lead the writer to make an advanced study about the readability of reading materials in a text book by using another text book which is entitled “Communicative Learning English For SMA" and another formula which is called Fry Readability Estimate. In conducting this research, the writer uses the descriptive study which is called 00 a case study’ with the third year students of A 1 and A 2 program of SMA Kristen Petra 1 Surabaya as the sample of the study. This case study was conducted in July in the school year of 1993 - 1994. The model of instruments used in this research are the same as Wiyono’s (1988); they are close tests and a questionnaire and they are analyzed and measured by the same procedure and formulas. Besides these procedures, the writer also uses the Fry Readability Estimate for indicating the level of reading materials in a textbook. The result {{of this study is that}} the reading materials indicate high level of readability in term of vocabulary, structures, and illustrations, sufficient level of readability in term of background knowledge and personal interest. While, in term of school level the reading materials indicate that they are not suitable to be applied for the third year students of Senior High School...|$|R

40|$|With the {{prospect}} of a General Election looming over the next twelve months, it has been well documented that political parties in the UK face a major challenge when seeking to overcome cynicism {{on the part of the}} electorate, their lack of trust in politicians and a general lack of engagement with the political process as a whole. However, in order to achieve this they first need to overcome a further, less well documented challenge; the challenge of communicating their policies in a way that that is both accessible and easily comprehended by their ultimate audience: the electorate.

30|$|The DISCERN {{instrument}} comprises of a 16 -item questionnaire, {{divided into}} three domains: reliability (items 1 – 8), specific information related to treatment choices (items 9 – 15), and an overall rating of the quality (item 16) of the publication. Each item is rated on a five-point scale from 1 (low quality with serious or extensive shortcomings) to 5 (high quality with minimal shortcomings). Each item on the DISCERN instrument for individual PILs was scored independently by two authors (LC and LB) producing an overall score for each PIL. Disagreements were resolved by consulting with a third author (JS). Similar to previous research [14], a summative score from questions 1 to 15 was obtained giving a total score of ranging between 15 and 75, where a score of 15 was deemed very poor quality and 75 was very high quality. All data were collected using a pre-specified data collection form. One author (LC) assessed the readability of the PILs. The entire text from the pdf versions of each PIL was copied into a Word (Microsoft office, Version 15.13. 1) document. These Word documents were cross-checked against the pdf versions to ensure completeness. The text was then imported into an online tool (www.readability-score.com). The following assessment methods/formulae {{were used to assess}} readability and reading grade level: Flesch Reading Ease [11], Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level [12] and Simple Measure of Gobbledygook (<b>SMOG)</b> <b>index</b> [15]. The Flesch readability tools utilise the sentence length (number of words per sentence) and the number of syllables per word in specific equations with different weighting factors to calculate the reading ease and grade level respectively. Similarly, in the <b>SMOG</b> <b>index,</b> 30 sentences (ten from the beginning, middle and near the end) from the identified reading material are selected. Within these sentences every word with three of more syllables is identified. The total number of words in the material is also calculated. Using these variables, either the SMOG conversion table or equation is used to calculate the reading level. The Flesch Reading Ease score has a range of 0 to 100, where 0 represents a very difficult passage to read and 100 a very simple one [16]. The overall readability of a PIL based on the Flesch Reading Ease score was classified as difficult (score below 50), fairly difficult (score above 60) and comfortable reading text (score above 80) [17].|$|E

40|$|Preetinder S GillCollege of Technology, Eastern Michigan University, Ypsilanti, MI, USABackground: Health {{literacy}} impacts health outcomes. Health {{literacy is}} a measure of a person&# 39;s competence to find, access, contextualize, and understand the information needed to make health decisions. Low levels of health literacy have been associated with poor health status. Health literacy can be enhanced by improving the readability of health literature. Misuse and abuse of prescription medicines and controlled substances is rising. It could be argued that improving the readability of the drug-information documents associated with these medicines could serve to alleviate this situation in a small, albeit incremental, manner. This paper provides a readability assessment of 71 such documents. Methods: The readability of drug-information documents associated with 12 commonly misused and abused painkiller medicines and controlled substances published by the top six US pharmacies was assessed. The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, Flesch Reading Ease, and Simple Measure of Gobbledygook (SMOG) indices were used to assess the readability of these drug-information documents. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to&nbsp;compare the readability of the documents. Results: The average Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level index score was found to be 11. 16. The average Flesch Reading Ease index score was found to be 45. 94. The average <b>SMOG</b> <b>index</b> score was found to be 13. 60. Pharmacies C and E had the best average readability scores, whereas pharmacies A and B had the worst average readability scores. Conclusion: Access, contents, and formatting of the documents were qualitatively analyzed to make recommendations to improve readability. Pharmacies C and E were used as benchmarks to identify the seven best practices. Good drug-information documents should have: (1) clear purpose, (2) limited scope, (3) summary/brief review, (4) well-placed graphics, (5) informative illustrations, (6) clean layout and lucid formatting relevant to the media, and (7) focus on the intended users.
