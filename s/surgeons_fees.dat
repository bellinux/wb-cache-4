40|$|International audienceBackgroundThe cost {{disparity}} between the United States and other advanced health care systems, including France, is expanding. In this report we identified the management of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) that contribute to reimbursement disparity. MethodsA tri-institutional, retrospective review included 200 patients with PTC (100 from the United States, 100 from France) treated by total thyroidectomy with/without central neck dissection. A cost model was generated incorporating perioperative management variables (within 1 year) and their reimbursement rates according to the 2014 US Medicare and French government fee-schedules. ResultsIn the United States, total thyroidectomy with central neck dissection was more frequent (92 % vs 35 %, P <. 001), median duration of stay was less (1 vs 3 days, P <. 001), and use of radioactive iodine was less (66 % vs 93 %, P <. 001), although Thyrogen stimulation was more prevalent (100 % vs 43 %, P <. 001). Overall, the median cost per patient was greater in the United States ($ 14, 069 vs $ 4, 590, P <. 001). Reimbursements to the hospital facility accounted for 70 % of the disparity, despite lesser durations of stay. Nuclear medicine accounted for 19 %, mostly from Thyrogen reimbursement despite less use of radioactive iodine. <b>Surgeon</b> <b>fees</b> accounted for 6 %, followed by office visits, laboratory/imaging, anesthesia/pathology fees, and medications. ConclusionThe costs of management of PTC are substantially greater in the US compared with France. Efforts to decrease this disparity should focus on reimbursements for hospital facility and use of nuclear medicine imaging...|$|R

50|$|Set {{somewhere in}} Vienna in the 1900s (decade), the film {{opens with a}} {{successful}} <b>surgeon</b> (Morgan), <b>feeing</b> for the affection of his wife (Bruce). As does his brother, a concert conductor (Owen), for his flirtatious gal (Christians). Both women have something in common: they are {{in love with a}} philandering painter (Powell). The surgeon's wife contacts the artist and allows herself to be painted while only dressed in furs, with her face covered by a mask. The painting headlines the newspapers, and the entire city wonders who the mysterious masked lady is. The surgeon recognizes his fiancee's wife's furs in the painting, and is troubled. He is unaware that his own wife has borrowed the fur, though, and feels terribly sorry for his brother.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: For many years, {{the gold}} {{standard}} in upper urinary tract transitional-cell carcinoma (UT-TCC) management has been nephroureterectomy with excision of the bladder cuff. Advances in endourologic instrumentation have allowed urologists to manage this malignancy. The feasibility and success of conservative measures for UT-TCC have been widely published, but {{there has not been}} an objective cost analysis performed to date. Our goal was to examine the direct costs of renal-sparing conservative measures v nephroureterectomy and subsequent chronic kidney disease (CKD) or end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Secondary analysis includes a discussion of survival and quality-of-life issues for both treatment cohorts. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of a cohort of patients treated at our institution with renal-sparing ureteroscopic management of UT-TCC who were followed for a minimum of 2 years. The costs per case were based on equipment, anesthesia, <b>surgeon</b> <b>fees,</b> pathologic evaluation fees, and hospital stay. ESRD and CKD costs were estimated based on published reports. RESULTS: From 1996 to 2006, 254 patients were evaluated and treated for UT-TCC at our institution. A cohort of 57 patients was examined who had a minimum follow-up period of 2 years. Renal preservation in our series approached 81 %, with cancer-specific survival of 94. 7 %. Assuming a worst-case scenario of a solitary kidney with recurrences at each follow-up for 5 years v nephroureterectomy and dialysis for the same period, an estimated $ 252, 272 U. S. dollars would be saved. This savings would cover the expenses of five cadaveric renal transplantations. CONCLUSIONS: Conservative endoscopic management of UT-TCC in our experience should be {{the gold standard}} management for low-grade and superficial-stage disease. From a cost perspective, renal-sparing UT-TCC management is effective in reducing ESRD health care expenses...|$|R

40|$|Ó The Author(s) 2009. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Background Prior studies suggest {{the cost of}} allograft anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is less than that for autograft reconstruction. Charges in these studies were influenced by patients requiring inpatient hospitalization. Question/purpose We therefore determined if allograft ACL reconstruction would still be less costly if all procedures were performed in a completely outpatient setting. Methods We retrospectively reviewed 155 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction in an ambulatory surgery center between 2001 and 2004; 105 had an autograft and 50 had an allograft. Charges were extracted from itemized billing records, standardized to eliminate cost increases, and categorized for comparison. <b>Surgeon</b> and anesthesiologist <b>fees</b> {{were not included in}} the analysis.

The mean total cost was $ 5465 for allograft ACL reconstruction and $ 4872 for autograft ACL reconstruction. There were no differences in complications between the two groups. Allograft ACL reconstruction was more costly than autograft ACL reconstruction in the outpatient setting. The cost of the allograft outweighs the increased surgical time needed for harvesting an autograft. Level II, economic and decision analyses.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the system used by Caterpillar Corporation (CAT) in Peoria, Illinois, to reimburse surgeons. The CAT system assures access for Caterpillar employees {{and their families}} to a selection of qualified surgeons, while achieving cost savings through improvements in processing of surgical claims and negotiation of selected fees. CPT- 4 codes are recorded for greater accuracy, when indicated, surgical services that have been incorrectly unbundled are rebundled, and the appropriateness of surgical assistant charges is reviewed. A "degree of difficulty" relative value scale (DODRVS) of surgical services is periodically revised as technology changes. The DODRVS multiplied by a regional factor, determined by local market research, establishes the fee that CAT will pay the surgeon. Balance billing is permitted if the patient (1) is informed in advance by the <b>surgeon</b> that the <b>fee</b> will be higher than CAT will pay, and (2) knows that the service {{can be obtained from}} other local surgeons who will accept the CAT fee. The goal of the CAT method of surgeon reimbursement is to gain physician support for an access-oriented, market-driven negotiated fee schedule. Compared with a resource-based relative value scale RBRVS) methodology, the CAT system is not formula-driven and depends on physician acceptance...|$|R
40|$|Background Public {{hospitals}} have experienced budget constraints but as demand for admissions {{has been growing}} at the same time, occupancy levels have been increasing. As emergency and urgent admissions are given priority, the effect has been not just longer waiting times and larger waiting lists for non-urgent admissions, but also frequent cancellations of elective surgery, thus adding to patients? waiting time. Consequently, {{there have been a}} number of attempts to reduce elective surgical waiting lists. The Auburn Elective Surgical Program (AESP) was a pilot program funded by the NSW Health Department, to improve elective surgery for patients in Western Sydney Area Health Service (WSAHS). The program commenced 19 th July 2001 and ended 15 th November 2001. Initially, the program targeted three specific surgical procedures, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, hernia repair, and haemorrhoidectomy, and was expanded to include thyroidectomy, ligation and stripping of varicose veins and endoscopy. The program sought to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of administrative and clinical aspects of elective surgery by: > Using spare operating theatre capacity at Auburn Hospital; > the use of a new booking and waiting list system, managed by a nurse co-ordinator, which offered suitable patients a definite date for surgery; > increasing surgical sessions by paying participating <b>surgeons</b> on a <b>fee</b> for service basis; > however, surgery could be performed by a surgeon other than their treating surgeon; > re-structuring elective surgical sessions to eliminate meal breaks; > planning post discharge care so that surgery could be performed on a day only basis. The Centre for Health Economics Research and Evaluation (CHERE) was commissioned to undertake an independent evaluation of the AESP. This study has examined the throughput, health outcomes, costs and patient satisfaction. Throughput data on the program were defined as time spent on the waiting list, number of failures to attend planned surgery, average length of stay, and number of surgical interventions. Health consequences were defined as complications, unplanned readmissions to hospital, wound infection after surgery, mortality, percentage of same day admissions and conversion rate to open cholecystectomy. Costs were estimated from a health service perspective. Patient acceptability was assessed by the proportion of eligible patients having their surgery under the AESP, and patient satisfaction by questionnaire.
