25|$|Auckland lawyer Peter Williams, engaged {{by representatives}} of Tuhoe, {{examined}} whether charges could be brought against police for the raids and {{whether there was a}} case for charges of wrongful imprisonment. Williams wrote to Police Commissioner Howard Broad, seeking compensation and a restoration of mana, but on 14 December announced he had received no reply and would represent thirty members of Tuhoe in a class action against the police. Broad had earlier however publicly apologised to the people of Ruatoki for the raids and acknowledged that the actions of his force might take decades to heal. According to TV3 Ruatoki residents wanted utu (reciprocity) in the form of Broad's resignation. The call for his resignation was echoed by the Māori Party and Global Peace and Justice Auckland. A hikoi protesting the raids and the <b>Suppression</b> <b>of</b> <b>Terrorism</b> Act left the Bay of Plenty on 12 November. The hikoi collected signatures for a petition that it presented to parliament when it arrived in Wellington two days later. On 13 November a group of concerned individuals placed an advertisement in the Dominion Post urging the government to withdraw the <b>Suppression</b> <b>of</b> <b>Terrorism</b> Bill. Signatories to the advertisement included Green Party leader Jeanette Fitzsimons and National Distribution Union leader Laila Harre.|$|E
25|$|In October 2007 {{at least}} 17 {{people were arrested}} {{in a series of}} raids under the <b>Suppression</b> <b>of</b> <b>Terrorism</b> Act and the Arms Act 1983. The raids {{targeted}} a range of political activists allegedly involved in illegal firearms activity. The case dragged on for nearly four years and cost taxpayers millions of dollars. Much of the surveillance evidence was found to have been gained illegally and charges against all but four defendants were dropped. The remaining four were charged with firearms offences, found guilty and sentenced to terms of imprisonment and home detention.|$|E

[...] Civil Liberties group Who's Watching You called the raids [...] "a despicable show of force by the coercive arm of the state" [...] and said that [...] "The extensive use of surveillance to allegedly gather information is another telling example of the Government and police force's willingness to disregard the people of Aotearoa." [...] Canterbury University academic and social justice campaigner David Small told bFM that the raids were draconian and probably illegal.

Further this study provides information about perception <b>of</b> the term <b>terrorism</b> in the past depending on {{the political and social}} conditions and about how the terrorist attacks influenced the effort to find the definition <b>of</b> <b>terrorism.</b> The thesis pays big attention to regional treaty in which terrorism is defined and uses it as a comparison basis for finding the elements of the definition, since regional international treaty law has achieved the biggest success in this area. However, {{in the last two decades}} successes have achieved on universal level, especially by the adoption of the International Convention for the <b>Suppression</b> <b>of</b> Financing <b>of</b> <b>Terrorism,</b> which is the first universal agreement binding defines terrorism.

I'm protesting, I {{must be a}} terrorist". Indigenous rights protesters also rallied outside the New Zealand Consulate in Melbourne to condemn the raids. Another protest occurred on 17 October outside the Wellington district court. On 19 October up to one thousand people participated in a hikoi in Whakatane, including people from the Ruatoki Valley and children from the Ruatoki primary school. One Māori elder speaking at the protest called for the overturning of the <b>Suppression</b> <b>of</b> <b>Terrorism</b> Act. The following day hundreds of protesters {{took to the streets}} across New Zealand, targeting local police stations. Protesters demanded the government withdraw the Terrorism Suppression Amendment Bill and called for immediate bail for those arrested in the raids. Global Peace and Justice Auckland spokesperson Mike Treen said a 'Darth Vader police force in para-military uniforms has been terrorising whole communities' and called for a national day of action the following week. On the day Tame Iti appeared in the Rotorua district court 500 people protested causing police to close off streets around the Rotorua Courthouse. There were protests on 27 October 2007 in 13 cities around New Zealand, and around the world including; the Netherlands, Switzerland, United Kingdom, Greece and Australia.|$|E

40|$|Terrorism {{has become}} a major preoccupation of governments in western countries, {{including}} Australia, the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and New Zealand. This preoccupation has often manifested itself in frenetic legislative activity. In 2002, amidst some public controversy, the Australian parliament passed a raft of legislation aimed at enhancing Australia's protection against the possibility of terrorist threat (Williams 2003; Carne 2003; Ricketts 2002; Head 2002; Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee 2002). A major plank of such legislation was the <b>Suppression</b> <b>of</b> the Financing <b>of</b> <b>Terrorism</b> Act 2002. Research into this legislation and its effects, however, remains very undeveloped. More generally, there is limited academic literature on combating the financing <b>of</b> <b>terrorism</b> (see, however, Levitt 2003; Sheppard 2002; Bantekas 2003; Selden 2003; Myers 2002; Chenumolu 2003; Hardister 2003; Pieth 2003). The scholarship to date tends to be focused on the legal and regulatory aspects of the legislation rather than its social and political implications in terms of civil rights and democracy (see Tan 2003). Against such a lacuna, this comment aims to briefly describe the key provisions <b>of</b> the Australian <b>suppression</b> <b>of</b> financing <b>of</b> <b>terrorism</b> regime.

40|$|In March 2013 the Indonesian Parliament passed Law No 9 of 2013 on the Prevention and Eradication <b>of</b> <b>Terrorism</b> Financing). Enactment <b>of</b> the {{legislation}} ostensibly brought Indonesia {{into line with}} its commitments under international law as a signatory to the International Convention for the <b>Suppression</b> <b>of</b> Financing <b>of</b> <b>Terrorism</b> (1999) which Indonesia signed in September 2001 and ratified in 2006. While Indonesia’s existing, hastily-drafted anti-terrorism legislation (Law No 15 of 2003) contained a brief provision criminalising the funding <b>of</b> <b>terrorism,</b> this latest and much more significant statute is intended to shore up any gaps in the existing legislative regime. It also provides for a central governmental agency, the Centre for Financial Transactions and Reporting (PPATK – Pusat Pelaporan Analisis Transaksi Keuangan), to have both authority and responsibility for the monitoring of suspicious financial transactions. While {{the legislation}} establishes the legal basis for PPATK’s role in countering the financing <b>of</b> <b>terrorism,</b> it also places significant obligations on financial services providers (FSPs) to monitor and report any suspicious transactions to PPATK – as well as obligations to ‘know your customer’ – with significant penalty provisions for failure to do so. Despite the enactment of this latest legislation to counter the funding <b>of</b> <b>terrorism,</b> the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an inter-governmental standard-setting agency {{under the auspices of}} the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), has kept Indonesia on its public list of ‘high risk and non-cooperative jurisdictions’.
