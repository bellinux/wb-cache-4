5|$|The Overman Committee was {{formally}} an ad-hoc <b>subcommittee</b> <b>of</b> the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, {{but had no}} formal name. It was chaired by Senator Lee Slater Overman and also included Senators Knute Nelson of Minnesota, Thomas Sterling of South Dakota, William H. King of Utah, and Josiah O. Wolcott of Delaware.|$|E
5|$|In 1621, a <b>subcommittee</b> <b>of</b> the House of Lords {{concluded}} that the Lords' record keeping should be improved, and the tower was renovated to improve its storage facilities. The {{first floor of the}} tower, used to store the documents, was renovated with brick vaulting, providing better fire protection than the original wooden ceiling, by Thomas Hicks at a cost of £6. The chamber was further protected by a new iron door.|$|E
5|$|The Overman Committee was {{a special}} <b>subcommittee</b> <b>of</b> the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary chaired by North Carolina Democrat Lee Slater Overman. Between September 1918 and June 1919, it {{investigated}} German and Bolshevik elements in the United States. It was an early forerunner of the better known House Un-American Activities Committee, and represented the first congressional committee investigation of communism.|$|E

5|$|There {{was also}} a growing public {{awareness}} in the U.S. of military activities in Laos. During October 1969, Senator Stuart Symington (D-MO) chaired hearings of the <b>Subcommittee</b> <b>of</b> the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Security Agreements and Commitments Abroad. The testimony of subpoenaed witnesses revealed the history of U.S. involvement in the covert commitment to Laos. Due to the closed nature of the sessions and its heavily censored transcript, however, {{the nature and extent}} of that commitment was still very little understood by the American public.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Bacher {{returned}} to Ithaca to head Cornell's Laboratory for Nuclear Studies. He agreed with Bethe that what Cornell needed {{to become a}} major player in high energy nuclear physics was a new synchrotron, but first he needed to find somewhere to put it. However, in 1946 Bacher was appointed to the Scientific and Technical <b>Subcommittee</b> <b>of</b> the new United Nations Atomic Energy Commission, along with fellow United States representatives Tolman and Oppenheimer. Bacher therefore had to divide his time between Ithaca and New York City.|$|E
5|$|Chotiner was {{slated to}} play a major role in the Eisenhower/Nixon {{re-election}} bid. However, he had represented two Atlantic City clothing manufacturers, the Kravitz brothers, who had been fined and barred from further government contracts for fraud, and on April 25, 1956, a <b>subcommittee</b> <b>of</b> the Senate Permanent Committee on Investigations, looking into military procurement, subpoenaed him to appear before it. The senators wanted to inquire why a New Jersey firm which already had six attorneys would hire a California lawyer, especially one with close ties to Vice President Nixon.|$|E

Glenn introduced bills on energy policy to try to counter the energy crisis in the 70s. Glenn also introduced legislation based on nuclear non-proliferation, and was the chief author of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978, the first of six major pieces of legislation that he produced on the subject.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, Caltrans {{said that}} SR54 {{had not been}} {{included}} in plans {{for the next six}} years, {{due to a lack of}} funding and a shift in priorities from new roads to maintenance. The water <b>subcommittee</b> <b>of</b> the U.S. House of Representatives later recommended that the wildlife refuge be put on hold, since the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) had not finished their proposal. Over the next few years, support for the project was expressed by a local citizens' group, the Chula Vista city council, and the San Diego Chamber of Commerce.|$|E
5|$|The {{chairman}} of the Subcommittee on Regulatory Affairs, Stimulus Oversight and Government Spending, U.S. Representative Jim Jordan held hearings on January 25, 2012, to investigate why the NHTSA opened a formal investigation only {{five months after the}} first postcrash battery fire occurred in June. The <b>subcommittee</b> <b>of</b> the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform wanted to determine if government officials, including from NHTSA, purposely held back information on the Volt fire for political reasons. Both Daniel Akerson, General Motors CEO, and David L. Strickland, NHTSA administrator, denied any wrongdoing.|$|E

5|$|A <b>subcommittee</b> <b>of</b> the S-1 Executive Committee, {{chaired by}} James B. Conant, and {{consisting}} of himself, Arthur Compton and Harold Urey, {{was appointed to}} look into the issue, and it similarly assessed the danger as low, but still sufficient to warrant taking some precautions. A program was initiated by the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago and the Victoreen Instrument Company in Cleveland to develop radiation detection devices suitable for use in the field. Some 48 portable detection meters were built in 1943, half of which were capable of detecting 0 to 10 roentgens per day, while the other half could detect from 0 to 100 roentgens per day. Instruments sets were stored at Manhattan District offices in Boston, Chicago, New York City, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., and the area engineer and some other officers were instructed in their use. A special team of scientists was created at the Metallurgical Laboratory who could respond to any reports of the use of nuclear weapons or radioactive poisons.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Hastert {{announced}} he would support an Armenian Genocide resolution. Analysts noted {{that at the time}} there was a tight congressional race in California, in which the large Armenian community might be important in favor of the Republican incumbent. The resolution, vehemently opposed by Turkey, had passed the Human Rights <b>Subcommittee</b> <b>of</b> the House and the International Relations Committee but Hastert, although first supporting it, withdrew the resolution {{on the eve of the}} full House vote. He explained this by saying that he had received a letter from Bill Clinton asking him to withdraw it, because it would harm U.S. interests. Even though there is no evidence that a payment was made, an official at the Turkish Consulate is said to have claimed in one recording, that was translated by Sibel Edmonds, that the price for Hastert to withdraw the Armenian Genocide resolution would have been at least $500,000.|$|E
5|$|In {{anticipation}} of an NBA team, {{and led by}} Mayor Mick Cornett, who had successfully lobbied for the previous temporary relocation of the New Orleans Hornets to Oklahoma City, the voters of that city approved a $120 million renovation of the Ford Center on March 3, 2008, including {{construction of a new}} NBA practice facility. After a tour of downtown Oklahoma City, a <b>subcommittee</b> <b>of</b> three NBA owners recommended that the league approve the move. On March 14, Bennett reached a preliminary agreement with Oklahoma City on a 15-year lease of the Ford Center that was finalized by the Oklahoma City Council and the Sonics’ ownership group two weeks later. The Oklahoma State Legislature later approved a bill to provide tax breaks and other incentives if the team relocated.|$|E

5|$|One {{proposal}} {{to revive the}} three-cent piece was made in 1911, when Mayors Brand Whitlock of Toledo, Ohio, and Newton D. Baker of Cleveland sent a joint memorial to Congress urging its return. The following year, a <b>subcommittee</b> <b>of</b> the House Committee on Coinage, Weights and Measures held a hearing on bills to authorize a copper-nickel three-cent piece and to change {{the composition of the}} cent to copper-nickel. Mint Director George E. Roberts testified and indicated he had no objection to a three-cent piece, as there was at least limited demand for a coin larger than the cent and smaller than the nickel. In 1936, a bill for a three-cent nickel was among various coin legislation considered by the Senate Banking Committee. In 1942, Congress granted the Treasury Secretary the temporary authority to change the composition of the nickel because of wartime metal shortages, and if public demand for the five-cent piece required it, the Mint could strike three-cent pieces. Nothing came of any of the proposals. The three-cent piece was made fully legal tender by the Coinage Act of 1965, which proclaimed all coin and currency of the United States good to any amount for payment of public and private debt. By then, that coin had long since passed from the scene.|$|E
