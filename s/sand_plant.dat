2500|$|The {{largest single}} plant in Canada {{to use in}} situ {{production}} is Imperial Oil's Cold Lake oil <b>sand</b> <b>plant.</b> This plant uses a technique called cyclic steam injection. Using this method, the company pumps high-pressure steam into {{a section of the}} underground reservoir for a week or so, then pumps the liquid oil out for as long as several months. Imperial also uses steam-assisted gravity drainage. In its SAGD production system, Imperial drills two horizontal wells, one five metres above the other. Steam injected through the upper well reduces the viscosity of the oil, which is recovered through the lower borehole. This plant produces more than [...] of bitumen per day.|$|E

6000|$|... [56] The four {{races of}} this order are more {{naturally}} distinct than botanists have recognized. In Clarissa, the petal is cloven into a fringe at the outer edge; in Lychnis, the petal is terminated in two rounded lobes and the fringe withdrawn {{to the top}} of the limb; in Scintilla, the petal is divided into two sharp lobes, without any fringe of the limb; and in Mica, the minute and scarcely visible flowers have simple and far separate petals. The confusion of these four great natural races under the vulgar or accidental botanical names of spittle-plant, shore-plant, <b>sand</b> <b>plant,</b> etc., has become entirely intolerable by any rational student; but the names 'Scintilla,' substituted for Stellaria, and 'Mica' for the utterly ridiculous and probably untrue Sagina, connect themselves naturally with Lychnis, in expression of the luminous power of the white and sparkling blossoms.|$|E

50|$|The {{plant was}} down, but not out. In 1953 Lloyd Champion, who had {{acquired}} the plant during World War II began forming the Great Canadian Oil Sands consortium, {{based on his}} oil sands assets and his business acumen and drive. That effort lurched from crisis to crisis until Alberta Premier Ernest Manning brought his friend, J. Howard Pew, into the conversation. As the chairman of Philadelphia-based Sun Oil Company, Pew soon became the primary financial backer of the project. As a result, the Great Canadian Oil <b>Sands</b> <b>plant</b> (today the Suncor oil <b>sands</b> <b>plant)</b> went into operation in 1967 - the year of Canada's Centennial celebrations.|$|R

50|$|Caddisfly larvae live {{in fresh}} water and {{naturally}} construct elaborate protective tubes for themselves from materials {{found in their}} environment. Under natural conditions they use the objects found in their stream bed homes such as pieces of wood, fragments of fish bone or crustacean shell, grains of <b>sand,</b> <b>plant</b> debris and small stones. The tubes serve various purposes; the stones are used to increase traction in fast-moving streams, they serve as disguise for the soft-bodied insect and the spiky bits make the tube and thus, the fly larva, more difficult for predators to swallow.|$|E
50|$|In 1967, the Great Canadian Oil <b>Sands</b> (now Suncor) <b>plant</b> {{opened and}} Fort McMurray's growth soon took off.

With the first floors of the buildings set against the hillside, and built on stilt like pilings, long flights of stairs were required to reach the first floor from the road. Even the Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad was running four passenger trains and 16 freight or coal trains through Roseville every day.|$|E

50|$|The system {{originally}} used {{a single}} pipe for water delivery, {{and did not}} have any water purification plants, relying instead on the reservoirs to act as settling basins. By the turn of the 20th century, however, Washington's growth and the high amount of sediment in the Potomac's water kept the reservoirs from doing their jobs well, and so the first treatment plant, a massive slow sand filter bed system, was installed at McMillan Reservoir, and was completed in 1905. The regular use of chlorine as a disinfectant began in 1923 at the McMillan plant. The McMillan plant was not replaced until 1985, when a rapid sand filter plant was opened adjacent to it. Efforts are under way to redevelop the land the slow <b>sand</b> <b>plant</b> used, while maintaining some of the plant's sand silos for historical purposes.|$|E
50|$|Pholisma arenarium is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the borage family known by several common names, including desert Christmas tree, scaly-stemmed <b>sand</b> <b>plant,</b> and purple sand food. It is native to northwestern Mexico, Arizona and southern California, where it grows in many habitat types, including desert, chaparral, and sandy coastal dunes. It is a fleshy perennial herb taking a compact cylindrical or ovate shape up to 20 or 30 centimeters tall above ground, often with part of the stem below the sandy surface. It is a parasitic plant growing on the roots or of various shrubs such as burrobush, Yerba Santa, California croton, rabbitbrush, and ragweeds. As a heterotroph which derives its nutrients from other plants, it lacks chlorophyll and is brownish-gray or whitish in color. There are hairy, glandular, pointed leaves along {{the surface of the}} plant. Flowers emerge between them, each roughly one centimeter wide, the rounded corolla lavender to deep or bright purple with a white margin.|$|E
5000|$|Because the Parke County Sheriff wasn't {{available}} one of {{the counties}} deputies started an investigation. He deputized another man and had Blake Gloss drive them from Rockville to Roseville. Acting on reports on the younger man, he was soon arrested. When they checked {{the home of the}} older man they didn't find him. Following another report that he was walking toward Rosedale the deputy started that way. The older arsonist changed his mind though and turned back toward home. While walking past the bridge ruins he was recognized and the assistant deputy started chasing him. The arsonist ran down the railroad tracks but was caught. They were both moved to Rockville sometime after noon on Sunday and placed in the Parke County Jail. On Monday they confessed and a few weeks later they were sentenced to 2-21 year terms at the State Reformatory at Jeffersonville. It would seem though that the two men were unrepentant of their crime. While waiting in the Rockville jail they composed a ballad describing their adventure. Only the first stanza though is remembered: [...] "We first set fire to the <b>sand</b> <b>plant.</b> And went on up the ridge. And it didn't prove successful. So we went and burned the bridge." ...|$|E
