50|$|A cover slip, {{coverslip}} {{or cover}} glass {{is a thin}} flat piece of transparent material, usually square or rectangular, about 20 mm (4/5 in) wide and {{a fraction of a}} millimetre thick, that is placed over objects for viewing with a microscope. The object is usually held between the cover slip and a somewhat thicker microscope slide, which rests on the microscope's stage or <b>slide</b> <b>holder</b> and provides the physical support for the object and slip.|$|E
5000|$|While {{the shows}} {{on both sides}} of the Atlantic had much in common they {{differed}} in two important ways. First, the American shows tended to be larger, with seven operators and over thirty projectors not being exceptional. In contrast, the shows in England seldom had more than three operators and ten or so projectors. Second, American shows were generally built around the overhead projector with the liquids in large clock cover glasses. Shows in England and Europe, in contrast, used modified 2" [...] sq. slide projectors which had their Dichroic heat filters (one or both) removed and employed two layers of slide cover glasses with two liquids (oil and water based, in the early days) between each layer. Alternatively different coloured water based dyes were used in each layer, which slowly boiled producing pulsing vapour bubbles when exposed to the heat of the projector lamp with the heat filters removed. Consequently randomly pulsing and moving blobs of colour were projected on the screen creating the light show. Before the projected layers totally dried out a new slide would be switched in the projector <b>slide</b> <b>holder,</b> meanwhile the old glass would be removed, cleaned and refurbished with new dyes and the projection process would continue. The surface tension of the liquids largely retained the mixtures between the glass slides, but the process was nevertheless very messy indeed and operators had their hands almost permanently stained by the dyes. A popular choice of colored liquids for light shows was Flo-Master ink, a product developed for use in permanent marker pens. While this ink was very vivid it also had the problem of staining the operator's hands very deeply.|$|E

In our facility, micro-Raman spectroscopy requires minimal sample handling and preparation. We have examined small amounts of carbon black powder mounted on to glass slide and secured with <b>slide</b> <b>holder.</b> The focal point with × 100 magnification is {{the area where the}} specific part of the sample will be analyzed.

50|$|The second type, known {{variously}} as {{a multiple}} back, repeating back or drop back camera, still exposed the images {{one at a}} time but used a <b>sliding</b> <b>holder</b> for the filters and plates which allowed each filter and the corresponding unexposed area of emulsion to be quickly shifted into place. German photochemistry professor Adolf Miethe designed a high-quality camera of this type which was commercially introduced by Bermpohl in 1903. It was probably this Miethe-Bermpohl camera which was used by Miethe's pupil Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin-Gorskii to make his now-celebrated color photographic surveys of Russia before the 1917 revolution. One sophisticated variant, patented by Frederic Eugene Ives in 1897, was driven by clockwork and could be adjusted to automatically make each of the exposures for a different length of time according to the particular color sensitivities of the emulsion being used.|$|R

40|$|Globally {{connected}} research sites frequently {{find the}} need to share information on a timely basis. The sharing of data obtained from microscopy has historically required that the researcher take micrographs of the desired image and send the film to the other site or, more recently, scan the micrographs into a computer and send the micrographs through e-mail. The authors identified {{the need to}} con-trol and view, in as close to real time as possible, images being viewed on a remote microscope. The goal {{was to develop a}} system that would be versatile, easy to learn and readily adapted from exist-ing materials and that would allow several users to simultaneously view and control the microscope. The use of commercially available materials along with a simple, custom-designed <b>slide</b> <b>holder</b> allowed researchers at remote sites to view one of 15 slides and move the slide as needed. The penalty for use of the Internet vs. dedicated phone lines such as Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) is that only 1 frame/ 7 s can be viewed at video resolution. The advan-tages of cost and multiple, simultaneous use over a ubiquitous sys-tem outweigh the disadvantage for most users...|$|E
40|$|A custom {{designed}} microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) micro-hotplate, {{capable of}} operating at high temperatures (up to 700 °C), {{was used to}} thermo-optically characterize fluorescent temperature-sensitive nanosensors. The nanosensors, 550 nm in diameter, are composed of temperature-sensitive rhodamine B (RhB) fluorophore which was conjugated to an inert silica sol–gel matrix. Temperature-sensitive nanosensors were dispersed and dried {{across the surface of}} the MEMS micro-hotplate, which was mounted in the <b>slide</b> <b>holder</b> of a fluorescence confocal microscope. Through electrical control of the MEMS micro-hotplate, temperature induced changes in fluorescence intensity of the nanosensors was measured over a wide temperature range. The fluorescence response of all nanosensors dispersed {{across the surface of the}} MEMS device was found to decrease in an exponential manner by 94 %, when the temperature was increased from 25 °C to 145 °C. The fluorescence response of all dispersed nanosensors across the whole surface of the MEMS device and individual nanosensors, using line profile analysis, were not statistically different (p < 0. 05). The MEMS device used for this study could prove to be a reliable, low cost, low power and high temperature micro-hotplate for the thermo-optical characterisation of sub-micron sized particles. The temperature-sensitive nanosensors could find potential application in the measurement of temperature in biological and micro-electrical systems...|$|E
25|$|An {{ordinary}} camera {{could be}} used to take the three pictures, by reloading it and changing filters between exposures, but pioneering color photographers usually built or bought special cameras that made the procedure less awkward and time-consuming. One of the two main types used beam splitters to produce three separate images in the camera, making all three exposures {{at the same time and}} from the same viewpoint. Although a camera of this type was ideal in theory, such cameras were optically complicated and delicate, and liable to get out of adjustment. Some designs were also subject to optical phenomena that could cause noticeably uneven color or other defects in the results. The other, more robust type was an essentially ordinary camera with a special <b>sliding</b> <b>holder</b> for the plates and filters that allowed each in turn to be efficiently shifted into position for exposure—an operation sometimes partly or even entirely automated with a pneumatic mechanism or spring-powered motor.|$|R
50|$|Pinhole cameras can be {{constructed}} with a <b>sliding</b> film <b>holder</b> or back so {{the distance between the}} film and the pinhole can be adjusted.This allows the angle of view of the camera to be changed and also the effective f-stop ratio of the camera. Moving the film closer to the pinhole will result in a wide angle field of view and a shorter exposure time.Moving the film farther away from the pinhole will result in a telephoto or narrow angle view and a longer exposure time.|$|R
40|$|Objective. This {{project was}} {{conducted}} to find a customizable, cost-effective alternative to purchasing current bench laboratory equipment utilizing 3 D printing. Background. With {{the high cost of}} scientific equipment, along with decreases in funding, current scientific advances balance the price of materials with the potential for results. The need for cheap and reliable tools lends itself easily to the current advances in 3 D printing. Through the use of filaments and customizable designs, 3 D printing evades the cost associated with manufacturing on the industrial scale. Moreover, utilizing computer-aided design (CAD) Software, 3 D printing aids scientists with the sharing of protocols and instruments with other laboratories. Methods. Laboratory equipment including brain cutting matrices, slide grips, and microscope <b>slide</b> <b>holders</b> were designed with Tinkercad, a free CAD software program, and created using a 3 D printer. These tools were then compared to the industrially 40 produced unit sale equivalent both financially and practically. Results. 3 D printed tools provide a cheap alternative to normally expensive equipment. Additionally, the ability to customize tools gives the 3 D printed instruments a practical advantage over their stock counterparts. Conclusion. The dissemination of the tools made by the 3 D printer can ultimately reduce cost and expand creativity of the scientist while increasing productivity within a laboratory setting. Moreover, 3 D printing is limited only by the selected extruding fiber as well as the creativity of the designer. Grants. N/A...|$|R
40|$|Peptide arrays, {{produced}} through {{combinatorial synthesis}} from amino-acid monomers, {{are an important}} tool for proteomic research. The arrays enable high throughput screening by exposing {{a large number of}} different peptide spots to a solution of target molecules. In particle based synthesis, the monomers are encapsulated into solid particles and deposited on the synthesis spots. The resulting spot density can be much higher than that of liquid based on-spot peptide synthesis. This dissertation presents the construction of a CMOS-chip based “printing system” that automatically prints monomer particles onto a glass slide for combinatorial synthesis of high-density arrays. The monomer particles (4 μm) are addressed onto the electrode pixels of a CMOS chip, and then printed onto a glass slide by using an electrical field. Afterwards, the particles are melted to release monomers for peptide synthesis. The printing system should print particles onto the slide with high reproducibility and homogeneity. This is achieved with high precision (μm) motors, a <b>slide</b> <b>holder</b> and 3 electrical contact sensors. For ideal printing result, the parameters including particle size, printing voltage, and printing distance are discussed. With printed particles, a peptide synthesis is performed, resulting in an array with 10, 000 spots per cm 2, which is 100 times more than with conventional method. Additionally, the advantage of the printing system is that the synthesis is not performed on the CMOS chip but on the regular glass slide, which is more chemically robust and suitable for biological applications...|$|E
3000|$|Firstly, a BK 7 {{glass is}} used as {{substrate}}. Before {{being used in the}} micro-sphere-assembled process, the BK 7 glass substrate is immerged in a mixed solution of sulfuric acid/hydrogen peroxide (3 : 1) for more than 1  h at 80  °C. Then, the substrate is rinsed in deionized water for several times and immerged in another mixed solution of ultrapure water/ammonium hydroxide/ 30  % hydrogen peroxide (5 : 1 : 1) for 1  hour under ultrasonication, sequentially. Finally, the substrates were thoroughly rinsed with deionized water and stored under deionized water until required. Secondly, a monolayer of PS array with hexagonal symmetry is obtained on the BK 7 glass substrate through the method reported in the literature, as shown in Fig.  3 b. The PS spheres with a diameter of 750  nm and weight concentration of 10  % are purchased from Thermo Scientific Company and used without further treatment. Thirdly, the Ag deposition on the closely packed PS array monolayer is performed inside a vacuum thermal evaporation system, as shown in Fig.  3 c. The base pressure, the deposition rate, and the temperature are 4 [*]×[*] 10 − 4  Pa, 1  nm/s, and 30  °C, respectively. For a single-step deposition, the deposition time needs to be precisely controlled (i.e., deposition thickness k), together with the angles θ and Φ, which can be easily adjusted by tilting and rotating the samples with the improved <b>slide</b> <b>holder</b> in the vacuum chamber, respectively. For stepwise depositions, the operational process is the repeat of the single deposition.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{develop in}} an {{interdisciplinary}} approach between ophthalmology and design areas an ergonomic + 22 -diopter 50 -mm aspheric hand magnifier for low vision. METHODS: An aluminum cylinder was cut, processed using a lathe and carved {{to produce a}} ring that accommodated a 50 -mm aspheric lens, with an external depression not to <b>slide</b> from the <b>holder's</b> fingers. A cylindrical steel bar was cut, processed using a lathe and carved in order to form an externally turned ring to be screwed into the internal thread of the aluminum ring, to maintain the lens in a steady position. Both rings were submitted to electrostatic painting with a dull black electrostatic Epoxi ink, except the lower border of the external ring, to indicate the correct side of the magnifier to face the material to be read. RESULTS: A 22 -diopter 50 -mm diameter aspheric lens magnifier with a black ring to be hold at its external circular depression was obtained in order to safely search the adequate reading focus with an inferior aluminum colored ring to face the object to be read and allow a less distorted reading. This is the first Brazilian high-magnification great-diameter magnifier for low vision that permits basically the focusing on an entire word, not only syllables, {{in order to allow}} a faster and more comfortable reading.

This is an external temperature control system and can be replaced by any system you may have available. Extruder calibration To ensure the stepper movement translates into the piston movement accordingly to the g-code, it needs to be calibrated properly. Calibration set-up In principle, the calibration set-up requires: CNC control of the piston powering motor (we use Nema 11 with a planetary reductor) the assembled extruder (at least the moving parts) a precise displacement measurement device (calipers, etc., high precision indicators are preferrable) The calibration protocol requires a set-up, where the piston translation, can be precisely measured in the axis of extrusion. For this purpose, the measurement device is fixed on the extruder in a way, that the extruder movement is translated directly into the measurement. Calibration procedure adjust the steps/unit value of the motor settings in the cnc control software (or use default values) command piston movement for an exact distance measure the real movement distance and compare repeat steps 1 - 3, until the g-code value coincides with the measured value For a Nema 11 motor (with a planetary reductor) + an M 5 spindle (0. 5 mm pitch/rotation), the default STEPS/UNIT value is 37914. 30. Thermistor calibration Every thermistor analog output values have to be mapped to actual temperature values via an equation. Every thermistor needs to be calibrated as described in this section. EQUIPMENT: thermo block/plate (heat source), alcochol thermometer, thermistor, setup for reading analog signal from the thermistor, oil, glass. pour a small glass of oil (50 mL or so) place the glass on the heat source fit a thermistor to the alcochol thermometer sink the thermistor - thermometer setup into the glass with oil prepare the system to read analog values turn on the heat source and record sensor analog output at every 1 °C increment plot data (x - axis: analog output, y-axis: real temperature) fit the best trendline to the data obtained (MATLAB or EXCEL are good tools for completing this task but there are also others) software will yield a fit line equation which then has to be transcribed into microcontroller firmware (we used Arduino Mega) Now your thermistor will give out the right temperature values. step_vitaprint. zi...|$|R
