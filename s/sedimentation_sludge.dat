40|$|Pharmaceuticals {{constitute}} {{a large group}} of human and veterinary medicinal organic compounds which have long been used throughout the world. According to their therapeutic activity they are classified in several groups: antibiotics, analgesics/antipyretic, CNS (Central nervous system) drugs, cardiovascular drugs, endocrinology treatments, diagnostic aid-adsorbable organic halogen compounds. Pharmaceuticals are designed to have a physiological effect on humans and animals in trace concentrations. Pharmaceuticals end up in soil, surface waters and eventually in ground water, which {{can be used as a}} source of drinking water, after their excretion (in unmetabolized form or as active metabolites) from humans or animals via urine or faeces. The possible fates of pharmaceuticals once they get into the aquatic environment are mainly three: (i) ultimately they are mineralized to carbon dioxide and water, (ii) the compound does not degrade readily because it is lipophilic and is partially retained in the <b>sedimentation</b> <b>sludge</b> and (iii) the compound metabolizes to a more hydrophilic molecule, passes through the wastewater treatment plant and ends up in receiving waters (which are surface waters, mainly rivers). These compounds exhibit the highest persistence in the environment. In recent years, and in particular after the use of the advanced measurement technologies, many pharmaceuticals have been identified worldwide and detected at ng/L levels (trace concentrations) in the aquatic environment, and are considered as an emerging environmental problem due to their continuous input and persistence in the aquatic ecosystem even at low concentrations...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{computational}} fluid dynamics (CFD) model that predicts the <b>sedimentation</b> of activated <b>sludge</b> in a full-scale flat-bottom circular secondary clarifier that {{is equipped with a}} suction-lift sludge removal system. The axisymmetric single-phase model is developed using the general-purpose CFD solver Fluent. A convection-dispersion equation, which is extended to incorporate the <b>sedimentation</b> of activated <b>sludge</b> in the field of gravity, governs the mass transfer in the clarifier. Sludge removal by suction-lift in the near-bottom region of the clarifier is simulated using negative source terms on all field equations. The standard k-ε turbulence model is used to compute the turbulent motion, and our CFD model accounts for buoyancy flow and non-Newtonian flow behaviour of the activated sludge in the clarifier. The rheological flow behaviour was measured for varying sludge concentrations and temperatures. These measurements show that at low to moderate shear rates typical of secondary clarifiers, the relationship between shear stress and shear rate follows the Casson law for pseudo-plastic flow behaviour. The rheology study was carried out together with measurements of the settling velocity during on-site measurements. The well-known double-exponential law is used to describe the dependence of the settling velocity on the concentration. Light scattering was applied to measure the local sludge distribution in the clarifier. The computation of the local sludge distribution in the clarifier by the CFD model compares well with concentration profile measurements for two different treatment plant loadings. Our CFD computations show further that the sludge viscosity dominates the flow and the <b>sedimentation</b> of activated <b>sludge</b> within the sludge blanket. © 2007 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Cadmium is an oligoelement {{which is}} not {{essential}} for biological systems but is toxic to most organisms. It is widely distributed in the environment at relatively low concentrations (Dunnick et al. 1988). It is {{not found in the}} free state but accompanies Zn in the majority of its minerals. It is used almost exclusively to form alloys, metal for ball bearings, for soldering, in batteries and electric accumulators and as an anticorrosive. Its resi-dues have contaminated the environment and its presence in <b>sedimentation</b> <b>sludges</b> used to manufacture fertilizers has given rise to an increase in the content of this metal in trophic chains. The inhalation of industrial powders and smoke represents the principal form of occupational exposure. For the general population the major route of exposure is food, because vegetables absorb it from contaminated soil and water. Tobacco is an even more important source, as absorption of inhaled particles ranges from 10 to 60 %, depending on their size and solubility (Nordberg et al. 1985). The literature indicates great variability in the concentrations of this element in foods in different countries, but in general the concentration ranges between 0. 005 - 0. 1 mg/kg wet weight (Friberg et al. 1986). The lowest concentrations in foods are found in milk and dairy products (a few ~g/Kg), followed by meat, fish and fruit, (1 - 50 ~g/Kg), vegetables and cereals (0. 01 - 0. 15 mg/Kg).

To reduce heavy metal concentration to an acceptable level for discharge, in this work, fly ash was added as a seed material to enhance lime precipitation and the suspension was exposed to CO 2 gas. The fly ash-lime-carbonation treatment increased the particle size of the precipitate and significantly improved <b>sedimentation</b> of <b>sludge</b> and the efficiency of heavy metal removal. The residual concentrations of chromium, copper, lead and zinc in effluents can be reduced to (mg L- 1) 0. 08, 0. 14, 0. 03 and 0. 45, respectively. Examination of the precipitates by XRD and thermal analysis techniques showed that calcium-heavy metal double hydroxides and carbonates were present. The precipitate agglomerated and hardened naturally, facilitating disposal without the need for additional solidification/stabilization measures prior to landfill. It is suggested that fly ash, lime and CO 2, captured directly from flue gas, may have potential as a method for wastewater treatment. This method could allow the ex-situ sequestration of CO 2, particularly where flue-gas derived CO 2 is available near wastewater treatment facilities. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|INTRODUCTION During the {{biological}} treatment of wastewater the waste is biodegraded by micro-organisms. This {{is one of}} the principal goals. A probably even more crucial unit process is the clarification. Indeed, clarifying the "purified" water is necessary to remove the particulate fraction in which the micro-organisms reside. According to Wanner (1994) the washout of sludge contributes to 50 to 80 % of the effluent BOD. This stresses the importance of the clarifier. The efficiency of <b>sludge</b> <b>sedimentation</b> depends on several factors. Of course, the hydrodynamics are essential, but also the biology plays a considerable role. Settling of sludge flocs is dependent on the combination of porosity and size of the flocs. Depending on the operational circumstances in the clarifier the floc size distribution changes {{along the length of the}} unit because of flocculation and deflocculation processes. In that way, shear rate, pH, ion strength and zeta potential are very important variables...|$|R

Low SVI (30 - 60 ml g- 1 SS) was responsible for an intensive and quick sedimentation which shortened the settle phase to less than one hour. Moreover, low SVI prevented the sludge from bulking. High dissolved oxygen concentrations in the aeration tank during the react phase resulted in little sludge biomass growth, which is very important from the viewpoint of sludge disposal at a wastewater treatment plant...|$|R

The function of the tank is to receive wastewater, separate solids from the liquid, provide limited digestion of the solids, and allow the liquid to discharge for further treatment or disposal. The soak-away system allows the effluent to seep into the ground. (ENSIC 1982). Despite the general acceptability of this treatment facility in the management of sewage from domestic source, septic tank effluents have been reported to be high in suspended solids, BOD, bacteria, and phosphorus. As a process, sedimentation alone is not highly effective in removing pollutants and the septic tank is subject to interference from other processes. Separation of <b>sedimentation</b> and <b>sludge</b> digestion led to the development of the “Imhoff tank”. This two-storeyed tank has proved useful at community sewage treatment plants but its cost and daily maintenance requirements detract from its use on a household scale. Attempts to improve on septic tank tend to result in units which are more expensive to install and require increased operational input. These improved versions tend to move away from the concept of a cheap, relatively maintenance-free unit.|$|R

Among the major operational problems is the excessive growth of filamentous microorganisms. The present work aimed to study the initial effects of a dosage of chlorine to control bulking in lab bench scale using a Jar-test. Although results of the monitoring of the treatment effluent system indicate good efficiency, Thiothrix I and Type 0675 bacteria were identified. In the first phase, doses were tested in the return sludge with sodium hypochlorite of 125 g L- 1 of active chlorine. A concentration of 25 mg L- 1 showed a positive effect after 1 h of sedimentation, breaking the filaments. In the second phase, concentrations of 20 to 27 mg L- 1 were tested, relating them to the total suspended solids and settled volume at 1 h. The concentration of 25 mg L- 1 showed a positive effect: the total suspended solids of return sludge showed values of 4933 mg L- 1 and a settled volume of 947 mL L- 1, whereas the control was 943 mL L- 1. This concentration helped <b>sedimentation</b> of <b>sludge,</b> but has affected the activities of other microorganisms. A possible explanation for why only high doses had {{a positive effect on}} the bacteria could be due to the presence of a sheath that acted as a protective cover against external agents in this species of bacteria...|$|R
40|$|The {{parametric}} pond simulation methodology AUTOPOND {{was developed}} {{as a tool to}} evaluate the effect of aerators on the sediment quality in an aquaculture pond. The methodology is capable of simulating any combination of paddlewheels and propeller-aspirators in a single pond. Pond bathymetry is modelled with a smooth bottom and a piece-wise series of inclined banks, to generally represent any convoluted shoreline. Simulations predict that a paddlewheel imparts more circulation into a pond than a propeller-aspirator of the same motor horsepower. The propeller-aspirator concentrates an intensive effect in a localized scourhole, surrounded by relatively weak bottom stress. In contrast, paddlewheel simulations predicted a wide swath of high stress, followed by an equally extensive region of moderate stress. A simulation of the combined effect of two paddlewheels and four propeller-aspirators was produced to represent a 'real world' earthen mariculture pond stocked with P. monodon. Water currents and sediment conditions reported in the real pond were comparable with the results of the simulation. Given sufficient computational resources, it is now possible to investigate the interactions of pond geometry and aerator operation with a computer. Portions of pond bottoms found to experience high shear stress are now identified for reinforcement to prevent the <b>sedimentation</b> of <b>sludge</b> in otherwise productive zones. This would result in improved feed conversion and reduced ammonia levels. Ponds and aerators can now be objectively coordinated to achieve more productive culturing condition...|$|R
