They'd learn more in a month than another man would in a year. We had one, once, in the Mary Ann, that came aboard with gold spectacles on. And besides, he was rigged out from main truck to keelson in the nobbiest clothes that ever saw a fo'castle. He had a chestful, too: cloaks, and broadcloth coats, and velvet vests; everything swell, you know; and didn't the saltwater fix them out for him? I guess not! Well, going to sea, the mate {{told him to go}} aloft and help shake out the foreto'gallants'l. Up he shins to the foretop, with his spectacles on, and in a minute down he comes again, looking insulted. Says the mate, 'What did you come down for?' Says the chap, 'P'r'aps you didn't notice that there ain't any ladders above there.' You see we hadn't any shrouds above the foretop. The men bursted out in a laugh such as I guess you never heard the like of. Next night, which was dark and rainy, the mate ordered this chap to go aloft about something, and I'm dummed if he didn't start up with an umbrella and a lantern! But no matter; he made a mighty good sailor before the voyage was done, and we had to hunt up something else to laugh at. Years afterwards, when I had forgot all about him, I comes into Boston, mate of a ship, and was loafing around town with the second mate, and it so happened that we stepped into the Revere House, thinking maybe we would chance the salt-horse in that big diningroom for a flyer, as the boys say. Some fellows were talking just at our elbow, and one says, 'Yonder's the new governor of Massachusetts--at that table over there with the ladies.' We took a good look my mate and I, for we hadn't either of us ever see a governor before. I looked and looked at that face {{and then all of a}} sudden it popped on me! But didn't give any sign. Says I, 'Mate, I've a notion to go over and shake hands with him.' Says he 'I think I see you doing it, Tom.' Says I, 'Mate I'm a-going to do it.' Says he, 'Oh, yes, I guess <b>so.</b> <b>Maybe</b> <b>you</b> don't want to bet you will, Tom?' Say I, 'I don't mind going a V on it, mate.' Says he 'Put it up.' 'Up she goes,' says I, planking the cash. This surprised him. But he covered it, and says pretty sarcastic, 'Hadn't you better take your grub with the governor and the ladies, Tom?' Says I 'Upon second thoughts, I will.' Says he, 'Well Tom, you aye a dum fool.' Says I, 'Maybe I am maybe I ain't; but the main question is, do you wan to risk two and a half that I won't do it?' 'Make it a V,' says he. 'Done,' says I. I started, him a giggling and slapping his hand on his thigh, he felt so good. I went over there and leaned my knuckle: on the table a minute and looked the governor in the face, and says I, 'Mr. Gardner, don't you know me? He stared, and I stared, and he stared. Then all of a sudden he sings out, 'Tom Bowling, by the holy poker! Ladies, it's old Tom Bowling, that you've heard me talk about--shipmate of mine in the Mary Ann.' He rose up and shook hands with me ever so hearty--I sort of glanced around and took a realizing sense of my mate's saucer eyes--and then says the governor, 'Plant yourself, Tom, plant yourself; you can't cat your anchor again till you've had a feed with me and the ladies!' I planted myself alongside the governor, and canted my eye around toward my mate. Well, sir, his dead-lights were bugged out like tompions; and his mouth stood that wide open that you could have laid a ham in it without him noticing it." ...|$|E

[...] "I had this image in my head of a guy seeing a woman across a crowded room and in that instant, he knows exactly what's going to happen: He falls in love with her, goes crazy, and kills himself in a hotel room," [...] said Hoppus.

Schur had announced the formation of his own imprint, Suretone Records, in March and released We Don't Need To Whisper, the debut from DeLonge's new group, Angels & Airwaves, in May. [...] "It Isn't' is about coming out a year later and telling the truth ... obviously we weren't going to say anything bad about him while we were recording our record, but now that it's done, we are gonna talk about it," [...] said Barker in 2006. [...] "For a year, people were saying that what Tom did was valid or called for. It eats at you. <b>So</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> have to talk about it, and maybe you have to write a song about it." [...] The song was titled [...] "No, It Isn't" [...] as a [...] "pre-emptive strike against the inevitable questions as to whether it is about Tom DeLonge." [...] Hoppus elaborated on the title in 2006: [...] "Originally I was going to hide behind something else when people asked what the song was about. Obviously they'd ask if it was about Tom and I was going to say, 'No, it isn't; it's about a girl I used to date,' or something. But we all love the song so much and I thought, 'Why would I hide behind anything other than that's the way I feel?' So it was actually way more meaningful and liberating to say that’s what the song’s about." ...|$|E

40|$|Market {{information}} ? rural kiosks {{and radio}} Cue: The Kenya Agricultural Commodity Exchange, or KACE, {{is one of}} the pioneers of providing market information to smallscale farmers in Africa. From blackboards and websites to SMS messaging and radio broadcasting, KACE is working to give farmers the information they need to earn higher prices for their crops. The methods developed by KACE are now inspiring similar projects in other countries, and KACE itself is looking to expand its own operations in different regions of Kenya. So how do farmers benefit from an organisation like KACE? Eric Kadenge put that question to Wycliffe Ochieng, IT manager at the Nairobi headquarters. He began by explaining the role of the Market Information Points ? small rural offices that are working to both collect and distribute information to smallscale farmers. IN:	?The Market Information Point ? OUT:	? who happens to be a woman. ? DUR?N:	 5 ? 27 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Wycliffe Ochieng, IT manager at the Kenya Agricultural Commodity Exchange. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Ochieng	The Market Information Point is an information kiosk based in the rural market. It?s quite simple. Managed by two staff, it has a desk, mobile phone, and where there is power we usually give them a very basic computer. So what happens at the Market Information Point at the rural market, on market days we have traders coming to the market. In this case also farmers, once they have their produce ready they take them to the market. Now we are trying to create a scenario where instead of the farmer sitting down in the market there with their commodities, they bring them to our office. The trading board has price information, so they are able to see what the prices are in different markets, so that will help them make a decision on how to sell their commodities. We also try to encourage them to bring them to our trading floor, our mini trading floor, where they can record their commodities. So we need such information like the type of the commodity, the quantity, the quality, and the price they are asking. So you will find this is much, much better. So we try to encourage the farmers, if you have such information then you don?t have to come with the whole commodity you have in your farm. Say I harvested 20 bags of maize, you don?t have to carry the 20 bags of maize to the market, and then maybe {{at the end of the}} day you are forced to sell a few at throwaway prices <b>so</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> can pay for transport or get something and return. It is more efficient and transparent as well. We also have the SMS service. What happens, information is collected every market day at the market information points. So this information is put together, transmitted to our HQ office in Nairobi where this information is processed. So we are working together with the leading mobile phone provider to provide this service. So it?s quite easy to subscribe, say for example I want to be receiving maize prices every morning, so I?ll subscribe to maize prices, and at every 9 o?clock in the morning we send this information to Safaricom server, and it is then pushed to the subscribers. So that is how it works. Kadenge	Interesting. Now let?s focus attention specifically on the Soko hewani programme. What goes on on this programme? Ochieng	Soko hewani is based in western Kenya. It?s a radio programme, 30 minutes radio programme. It comes every Tuesday between 8 and 8. 30 pm. So what happens is, from the previous programme the Soko hewani programme manager announced that if you have any offers and bids, then you can link up with KACE offices, or you can link up with him, and provide him with that information. So that information is aired during the programme. An example is, a client might have offered ?I have 20 bags of maize, I?m selling at this much. ? So once that is aired we have people listening and calling on a number. You can call the Soko hewani number, and react to that. Say ?I?m interested in that? or make more enquiries. Kadenge	What is the impact of this programme, Soko hewani? Ochieng	I can say the impact is great. We see more enquiries. We can also measure that by the business activities that are going on at our offices. So if you mention Soko hewani, at least someone will say, I was able to buy, I was able to sell something through Soko hewani. Kadenge	And for how long has the programme been going on? Ochieng	The programme was launched in October 2006. It?s on a pilot basis, and we hope that in the future we?ll be able to scale it out to other regions in the country as well. Currently it has a listenership of at least 5 million people. So Soko hewani has a market of 5 million people. We are also having discussions with other local FM stations, especially in eastern Kenya. We are discussing with them and seeing if we can have a similar arrangement that we have in western Kenya. So future plans, we are trying to see if we can scale it out to other regions as well. Kadenge	Now women do make quite a big proportion of the small-scale farmers out there. Are they benefiting from all these systems you have mentioned, and in what ways? Ochieng	Women are benefiting greatly. I was really touched by listening to a woman, she?s a smallscale farmer in Bungoma district of western Kenya. She really told me nowadays how she has more time, once she has got the market information she knows where to sell. She doesn?t have to carry her commodities around. And she also told me the way KACE, or Kenya Agricultural Commodity Exchange, has linked her to the market, so she knows where to sell. This gives her time to do other things, and her income has really improved. So we were really happy to hear that from one of our farmers, who happens to be a woman. End of track.
