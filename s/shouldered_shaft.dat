40|$|The stress {{distributions}} in shouldered shafts {{in tension}} and in torsion were calculated by the {{finite element method}} (FEM) for notch radii that are of technical interest. The calculated stress concentration factors K, and relative stress gradients normal to the surface were compared with values given in a well-known handbook used by many designers, and with literature, respectively. From this comparison it appears that:- K, values for a <b>shouldered</b> <b>shaft</b> in tension are up to 30 {{percent higher than the}} values given in mentioned handbook;- the relative stress gradients can, within the range of notch radii r that was investigated, be approximated by 2 /r for the tension case and l/r for the case of torsion. Publication of reliable results from FEM calculations of stress concentrations are recommended in order to improve or extend the usability of the design data which are now available. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractOne {{problem in}} {{wheelset}} axles are the failures {{due to the}} propagation of fatigue cracks. To avoid those failures with sometimes catastrophic consequences analytical crack propagation simulations are used. For these simulations {{the knowledge of the}} crack propagation path and the corresponding stress intensity factor (SIF) is required. To calculate the SIF a numerical simulation, such as finite element method (FEM), is generally needed. To this end numerical simulations for <b>shouldered</b> solid <b>shafts</b> with elliptical surface cracks are done. In this work different influencing factors of the stress intensity factor expressions have been identified. Therefore, two different specimen types with three different stress concentration factors each were designed. The results represent an overview for the interaction of stress concentration factor, crack depth, crack aspect ratio, bending and press-fit load in <b>shouldered</b> solid <b>shafts.</b> To represent the rotation, different characteristic angular positions for one selected characteristic crack geometry have been considered...|$|R

But the change in conditions at the surface will often lead {{to a change in}} the resistance to fatigue loading. This investigation is focused on the behaviour of <b>shouldered</b> <b>shafts</b> electroplated with nickel, chromium and a cobalt/chromium carbide composite. Changes, in fatigue strength are demonstrated. Each of the materials has a unique effect on the behaviour of a shaft, although there is a similarity which can be utilised in design. Each can reduce the fatigue strength by a substantial amount, but it is possible to optimize the design of a new shaft so that its strength is not significantly different to that of an uncoated version. The composite coating has the least effect. Explanations for these effects are given, based on differences in the mechanical properties of the substrate and coating materials, the distribution of residual stresses within the materials, and the interaction of these factors with the applied stress profile. Recommendations and methods of analysis which can be used in the design of coated components are presented. The contribution of the manufacturing processes is discussed, and grinding is highlighted as a dominant factor. Gentle grinding procedures are shown to produce ideal conditions by inducing large compressive residual stresses in the surfaces. Radial plots of the residual stresses have been produced. These were obtained by techniques based on Sachs' method, using electrochemical machining and an extended analysis developed for use with coated parts. The stress distributions were not affected by fatigue limit loading, indicating that stress relief methods using amplitudes of this order are ineffective and unsafe...|$|R
40|$|Although in {{scientific}} literature there are studies regarding {{the inclusion of}} relief grooves in order to diminish the amount of stress concentration in stepped shafts, the incorporation of optimization algorithms capable of parametrically determining their geometry remains unexplored. In this paper, an approach {{to the problem of}} size optimization of <b>shoulder</b> filleted <b>shafts</b> with relief grooves and subject to axial loads is presented. The objective of the optimization is to minimize the maximum value of stress at both, the root of the shoulder fillet, and the root of the groove, thus minimizing stress concentration and improving fatigue life of such elements. Under this methodology, different percentages of reduction of stress are achieved for the shafts with relief grooves, in comparison with the shafts without relief grooves. The novelty of this approach lies in the incorporation of an algorithm for the determination of the optimum geometry of the grooves...|$|R

[...] (date, 27th November, see supra, p. 348), in Helden-Geschichte, ii. 1181-1188.] hearing them well), through the Karlthor, northwest gate of Prag, across the Moldau Rridge. All night across that bridge,--Leitmeritz road, great road to the northwest:--followed finally by the march of horse and foot. But news had already fled abroad. Five hundred Pandours were in the City, backed by the Butchers' lads and other riotous GESINDEL, before the rear-guard got away. Sad tugging and wriggling in consequence, much firing from windows, and uproarious chaos;--so that Rothenburg had at last to remount a couple of guns, and blow it off with case-shot. A drilled Prussian rear-guard struggling, with stern composure, through a real bit of burning chaos. With effect, though not without difficulty. Here is the scene on the Noldau Bridge, and past that high Hradschin [Old Palace of the Bohemian Kings (pronounce RADsheen); one of the steepest Royal Sites in the world.] mass of buildings; all Prag, not the Hradschin only, struggling to give us fatal farewell if it durst. River is covered with Pandours firing out of boats; Bridge encumbered to impassability by forsaken wagons, the drivers of which had cut traces and run; shot comes overhead from the Hradschin on our left, much shot, infinite tumult all round; thoroughfare impossible for two-wheeled vehicle, or men in rank. 'Halt!' cries Colonel Brandes, who has charge of the thing; divides them in three: 'First one party, deal with these river-boats, that Pandour doggery; second party, pull these stray wagons to right and left, making the way clear; third party, drag our own wagons forward, <b>shoulder</b> to <b>shaft,</b> and yoke them out of shot-range;--you, Captain Carlowitz,' and calls twenty volunteers to go with Carlowitz, and drag their own cannon, 'step you forward, keep the gate of that Hradschin till we all pass!' In this manner, rapid, hard of stroke, clear-headed and with stern regularity, drilled talent gets the burning Nessus'-shirt wriggled off; and tramps successfully forth with its baggages.

40|$|In der vorliegenden Arbeit werden Ergebnisse von numerischen Untersuchungen vorgestellt, die mit topografischer Veränderung der Fugenfläche bei zylindrischen Press-verbindungen eine Spannungsoptimierung bewirken. Durch diese Spannungsoptimierung wird das Auftreten der Spannungsspitzen reduziert und die spezifische Reibenergie, die ein Maß für die Reibdauerbeanspruchung ist, an der Nabenkante deutlich verringert. Ziel dieses Forschungsschwerpunktes war der Aufbau einer ganzheitlichen Untersuchungsmethodik von Welle-Nabe-Verbindungen unter Torsionsbelastung, die den direkten Vergleich von numerischen und experimentellen Ergebnissen ermöglicht. Für die experimentellen dynamischen Versuche wurde ein neuartiges Prüfstandskonzept mit dazugehöriger Probenform entwickelt, das ein gleichzeitiges Belasten zweier stehender Welle-Nabe-Verbindungen ermöglicht. Bei diesem Prüfstandskonzept können alle denkbaren Belastungsfälle für Torsion untersucht werden. Zusätzlich ist eine gleichzeitige Überlagerung einer umlaufenden Biegung möglich. Für weitere experimentelle Untersuchungen wurde eine Vorrichtung aufgebaut, mit deren Hilfe der integrale Reibwert in Umfangsrichtung ermittelt werden kann. Ein neuartiges Konzept zur Messung der Relativbewegung an der Nabenkante wurde entwickelt, um die veränderte Reibcharakteristik vor und nach der dynamischen Belastung an der Nabenkante nachzuweisen. Die numerischen Ergebnisse der spannungsoptimierten Pressverbindungen zeigen, dass eine Zunahme des Schlupfes an der Nabenkante stattfindet und die verringerte Pressung an dieser Stelle zu einer deutlichen Reduzierung der spezifischen Reibenergie bei allen untersuchten Pressverbindungen führt. Das Ergebnis bei der Ausführung einer glatter Welle ist die Reduzierung der spezifischen Reibenergie um einen Faktor von über zwei und bei abgesetzter Welle von über vier. Spezielle Übergänge zwischen den Wellenabsätzen an der Nabenkante wurden mit verschiedenen Freistichformen untersucht und auch dabei wurde eine deutliche Verringerung der Reibenergie festgestellt. Für die analytische Berechnung des Schlupfes für spannungshomogenisierte Pressverbindungen wurden, aufbauend auf den analytischen Formeln nach Leidich /LEIDICH 83 /, Korrekturkurven ermittelt, mit denen der Schlupf berechnet werden kann. Weiterhin werden Korrekturkurven angegeben, für die der Schlupf in Abhängigkeit von der Geometrie der Wellenschulter analytisch berechnet werden kann. Zur Anpassung des optimalen Übermaßverlaufes wurde eine Annäherung mittels einer Radien-Fasen-Korrektur vorgenommen. Es zeigt sich, dass zur Reduzierung der spezifischen Reibenergie das Übermaßniveau direkt an der Nabenkante {{relevant}} ist und der darauffolgende Verlauf des Übermaßes nur von untergeordneter Bedeutung ist. Somit ist eine Reduzierung der Reibdauerbeanspruchung mittels eines an das spannungshomogenisierte Übermaß an der Nabenkante angenäherten Fasenniveaus realisierbar. Erstmalig wurde numerisch der lokale Reibwert an den schlupfbehafteten Gleitzonen innerhalb der Fugenfläche schrittweise erhöht, um die Veränderung der realen Reibverhältnisse abzubilden. Vergleichend mit den integral eingesetzten Reibwerten bewirkt die Anpassung des lokalen Reibwertes eine Schlupfzunahme von maximal 1 µm. Mit der experimentellen Schlupfmessung konnte infolge des direkten Vergleichs vor und nach der dynamischen Belastung eine deutliche Reduzierung der Schlupfamplituden ermittelt werden. Mithilfe analytischer Gleichungen gelingt es, den dafür angepassten lokalen Reibwert für die konventionellen und die spannungsoptimierten Pressverbindung zu errechnen. Die jungfräulich lokalen Reibwerte von 0, 3 bis 0, 4 stiegen während der Belastung bei gemessenen Rautiefen von Rz = 5 µm auf ein Niveau bis 0, 7 an. Diese Reibwerterhöhung wird für geschliffene Proben wahrscheinlich noch höher ausfallen und somit auch direkte Reibverschweißungen an der Nabenkante mit sich bringen. This work {{presents the}} results of experimental and numerical investigations, showing how changes in the topography of the contact surface of cylindrical pressed shaft-hub connections lead to stress optimization effects which considerably reduce the occurrence of stress peaks and fretting fatigue at the hub edge. This homogenization of stress is realized by a variable interference along the axial length of the connection. The key objective of the research at hand was to establish a holistic methodology for the examination of shaft-hub connections subjected to torsional load which would enable direct comparison of numerical and experimental results. Within the framework of the research, an innovative test bench concept with standing still specimen allowing two standing shaft-hub connections to be tested simultaneously was developed for dynamic experimentation. Extremely flexible in deployment, the new test bench is suitable for performance {{of a wide variety of}} torsion tests. In addition, a circumferential bend may be superimposed in parallel. For further experimental investigations, a device was developed for usage in calculating the integral friction value in circumferential direction. An advanced approach for measurement of the relative movement at the hub edge was introduced to quantify the change in friction characteristic at the hub edge before and after application of dynamic stresses. Numerical results of stress-optimized pressed connections evidence an increase in slip at the hub edge with the subsequent reduction in pressure at this location leading to a significant drop in specific friction energy for all the pressed connections examined. Results for smooth shafts showed that the specific friction energy was reduced to under half the original value, while for <b>shafts</b> with <b>shoulder</b> fillets the figure decreased to even lower than one-fourth. When special transitions between the chamfers of the shafts at the hub edge were investigated using various groove shapes, these also showed a clear reduction in friction energy. To analytically compute the slip for stress-strain homogenized pressed connections, an analytical formula proposed by Leidich /LEIDICH 83 / has been used to calculate correction curves for the pressed connections investigated, multiplying them to derive the slip. Furthermore, this work presents correction curves which have been found suitable for the analytical calculation of slip as a function of the <b>shaft</b> <b>shoulder.</b> To adapt the optimal press fit, an approximation using radius-chamfer correction was carried out. Results showed that the press fit interference at the hub edge is the crucial factor for a reduction in the specific friction energy with the further interference playing only a subordinate role. Hence, it follows that a reduction in fretting fatigue may be achieved by correct design of the chamfer height at the hub edge. For the first time ever, the local friction value at the slip zones within the contact surface was increased in increments to represent changes in the real friction conditions. Com-pared to the integral friction values, this adjustment of the local friction value resulted in an increase in slip of no more than 1 µm. Employing direct benchmarking techniques before and after dynamic stress testing, the experimental slip measurement approach determined a sharp reduction in slip amplitudes. Then using analytic equations, the adapted local friction value can be calculated for both the conventional and stress-optimized pressed connections. Before applying the load, the friction values ranged between 0. 3 and 0. 4 with a measured roughness depth of RZ = 5 µm. The friction values rose up to 0. 7 while the load was applied and remained constant. This increase in the friction value is significantly greater for smooth specimens, thus resulting in direct friction fusing at the hub edge. Since a pressed connection is designed in a range under the slip torque threshold, these results imply that a much higher friction value can be assumed for the design than recommended in the relevant industrial norms DIN 7190 /DIN 7190 - 01 / due to the fact that when dynamic stresses are applied a stationary status comes into being within the friction characteristic. Consequently, the stick-slip thresholds would also seem to be set too high for the specimens tested as these parameters were calculated on the basis of too low (local) friction values. There is therefore no evidence to conclude that, even for slip less than 0. 5 µm, a pressed connection will be fatigue resistant. And this would seem to be underpinned by examinations of worn pressed connections where damage occurred after a number of years. This work arrives at the conclusion that assured design is only possible in pressed connections which do not evidence relative movement between the shaft and the hub...|$|R
