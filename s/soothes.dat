5|$|The next day, Kushana {{leaves for}} the Tolmekian capital with Nausicaä and five hostages from the Valley, but an agile Pejite {{interceptor}} shoots down Tolmekian airships carrying them. Nausicaä, Kushana and other hostages crash-lands in the jungle, disturbing several Ohm, which Nausicaä <b>soothes.</b> She leaves {{to rescue the}} Pejite pilot Asbel, brother of Princess Lastelle, but both crash through a stratum of quicksand into a non-toxic area below the Toxic Jungle. Nausicaä realizes that the jungle plants purify the polluted topsoil, producing clean water and soil underground.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, Tolmekian troops, led by Princess Kushana, {{invade the}} Valley of the Wind, kill Nausicaä's father and capture the embryo. Nausicaä kills several Tolmekian {{soldiers}} in combat, but {{is about to}} be overwhelmed when the Valley's swordsmaster, Lord Yupa, <b>soothes</b> the belligerents. Kushana plans to mature the Giant Warrior and use it to burn the Toxic Jungle. Yupa, however, discovers a secret garden of jungle plants reared by Nausicaä; according to Nausicaä's findings, plants that grow in clean soil and water are not toxic, but the jungle's soil has been tainted by humankind.|$|E
5|$|Typical {{attachment}} development {{begins with}} unlearned infant reactions to social signals from caregivers. The ability to {{send and receive}} social communications through facial expressions, gestures and voice develops with social experience by seven to nine months. This {{makes it possible for}} an infant to interpret messages of calm or alarm from face or voice. At about eight months, infants typically begin to respond with fear to unfamiliar or startling situations, and to look to the faces of familiar caregivers for information that either justifies or <b>soothes</b> their fear. This developmental combination of social skills and the emergence of fear reactions results in attachment behavior such as proximity-seeking, if a familiar, sensitive, responsive, and cooperative adult is available. Further developments in attachment, such as negotiation of separation in the toddler and preschool period, depend on factors such as the caregiver's interaction style and ability to understand the child's emotional communications.|$|E

5|$|In the story, Tyrion {{uses his}} status as a Lannister to {{mitigate}} the prejudice he has received all of his life, even from his family. Knowing that no one will ever take him seriously, he <b>soothes</b> his inadequacies with wine, wit and self-indulgence. As the peaceful rule of King Robert Baratheon begins to decay, Tyrion sees how ill-equipped his family are to hold everything together. He first saves his own neck from the vengeful Catelyn Stark and her sister Lysa Arryn, then is sent by his father Tywin to impose order on the capital of King's Landing, as well as his nephew Joffrey, the new king, as civil war begins. Tyrion struggles to strengthen and protect the city and family who hate him and refuse to see the peril they are in; when his father returns, Tyrion becomes vulnerable to the wrath and machinations of the self-serving courtiers who surround Joffrey, including Tyrion's own scheming sister Cersei. Tyrion escapes death again but at great cost and in fleeing Westeros finds himself in even more danger and without the Lannister resources.|$|E

25|$|The Draught of Peace {{provides}} personal comfort, calms {{anxiety and}} <b>soothes</b> agitation. In Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Snape sets the potion {{as one of}} his lessons. It is a very difficult potion to make as the ingredients have to be added in a very specific order, the mixture has to be stirred exactly the right number of times and the heat of the flames on which it is simmering has to be lowered to exactly the right level for the right number of minutes before the final ingredient is added. Hannah Abbott had to have this potion in Order of the Phoenix to reduce her anxiety over the upcoming Ordinary Wizarding Levels (O.W.L.s).|$|E

500|$|At {{the start}} of the book, the shopkeeper {{discusses}} with Valentin [...] "the great secret of human life". They consist of three words, which Balzac renders in capital letters: VOULOIR ("to will"), POUVOIR ("to be able"), and SAVOIR ("to know"). Will, he explains, consumes us; power (or, in one translation, [...] "to have your will") destroys us; and knowledge <b>soothes</b> us. These three concepts form the philosophical foundation of the novel.|$|E
500|$|Qs Paul Du Noyer {{said that}} the source of The Joshua Trees [...] "potency lies in a kind of spiritual {{frustration}} – a sense of hunger and tension which roams its every track in search of some climactic moment of release, of fulfilment, that never arrives." [...] He concluded his review by writing that the music [...] "has the one thing vital to worthwhile rock, a thing so often absent: the urge to exist". Spin hailed the record as U2's [...] "first wholly successful album because it finally breaks free from the seductive but limiting chant-and-drone approach of earlier material". The review stated, [...] "There isn't a bad song on the record" [...] and that [...] "every one has a hook". The magazine praised U2 for eschewing ambient experimentation in favour of uncomplicated but layered arrangements. Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times said the album [...] "confirms on record what this band has been slowly asserting for three years now on stage: U2 is what the Rolling Stones ceased being years ago—the greatest rock and roll band in the world". Hilburn noted that the band showed [...] "sometimes breathtaking signs of growth" [...] and played more [...] "tailored and assured" [...] music. Hot Press editor and longtime U2 supporter Bill Graham said that [...] "The Joshua Tree rescues rock from its decay, bravely and unashamedly basing itself in the mainstream before very cleverly lifting off into several higher dimensions," [...] and that U2 [...] "must be taken very seriously indeed after this revaluation of rock". John Rockwell of The New York Times was complimentary of the band for expanding its musical range but said Bono's vocals were [...] "marred throughout by sobbing affectation" [...] and sounded too much like other singers, resulting in a [...] "curious loss of individuality". The Houston Chronicles Marty Racine felt it has [...] "music that both <b>soothes</b> and inspires, music that is anthemic, music with style". Racine, however, believed the group took itself too seriously, resulting in a record that is [...] "not a whole lot of fun, bordering on the pretentious", which caused him to lose interest by the second side. Robert Christgau from The Village Voice found the lyrics tasteful and the music [...] "mournful and passionate, stately and involved", but lamented what he felt was pompous singing by Bono, calling it [...] "one of the worst cases of significance ever to afflict a deserving candidate for superstardom".|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the influence of}} aerobic exercise activity, <b>soothing</b> musicnature scenes condition, and suggestion on coping with test-taking anxiety. Sixty test anxious subjects {{were randomly assigned to}} four treatment groups consisting of 15 -min episodes of exercise or <b>soothing</b> music-nature scenes condition with or without verbal suggestion that the treatment task in which they were engaged would be helpful to them. A videotaped “intelligence test” used to stimulate test-taking anxiety was given to the subjects after the <b>soothing</b> music-nature scenes condition or exercise tasks. The Multiple Affect Adjective Checklist (MAACL) was used to appraise anxiety during the laboratory procedures. Results indicate that exercise, <b>soothing</b> music-nature scenes condition, and suggestion play a role in reducing anxiety. While relaxation activity proved to be superior to exercise in reducing anxiety immediately following the “treatment” episode, these differences disappear following exposure to a stressful “IQ test” and exercise (as well as suggestion) had a better stress inoculation effect than <b>soothing</b> music-nature scenes condition or no suggestion...|$|R
