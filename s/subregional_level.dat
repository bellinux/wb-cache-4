40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this paper}} is to outline a {{research}} agenda for the estimation of household wealth in the USA. The authors argue that, although much progress has been made with the estimation of household income, such research has concentrated on wage and benefit income. A dynamic microsimulation model called CORSIM is used to estimate new indicators of wealth. These include household income derived from stocks and shares, retirement accounts, and financial gains made from house sales and inheritances. New indicators of debts include all household debts, especially mortgage debts. Although these indicators have been calculated at national levels in the past, it is argued that considerable benefits will accrue to our understanding of social problems and changing consumer lifestyles if these indicators can be estimated at regional and <b>subregional</b> <b>levels</b> of resolution. ...|$|R

Addressing some of the concerns, this thesis provides an evidence of customers’ spatial shopping behaviour at the study region of Kitchener Census Metropolitan Area (CMA). A customer’s spatial choice decision-making {{in the study area}} was first assumed to be a two-levelled process: regional and <b>subregional</b> <b>level.</b> This study was to identify the factors motivating consumers’ choice on where to shop at these two levels. A previous 804 households’ shopping behaviour survey conducted by Dr. A. Hecht in 1986 was used as the data basis of this study. A behavioral model named Multinomial Logit Model was utilized as a major research method to investigate the factors influencing shoppers spatial choice decision-making process in light of selected attributes of thirteen shopping centres and the characteristics of consumers themselves. A choice frequency analysis was also employed to identify the influencing factors at the different levels.

40|$|Policymakers use poverty maps {{to design}} and assess poverty programs. The {{accuracy}} of these maps, which is critical for targeting, depends largely {{on the nature of}} the instrument used to construct them. Recently, in response to tight budget constraints, many countries have begun to construct poverty maps based on light monitoring surveys that rely on short questionnaires. This article shows that poverty maps constructed from such surveys are not accurate and could result in substantial leakage. Light monitoring surveys do include large samples that can help to target poverty programs at <b>subregional</b> <b>levels.</b> Combining these surveys with more detailed Integrated Surveys can help researchers reduce targeting errors significantly and build improved poverty maps with finer levels of disaggregation.

To seize these opportunities, SSA will have to support economic growth via continued sound macroeconomic policies, further improvements in the investment climate, and investments in infrastructure and institutions. In the agricultural sector SSA will have to (1) remove the remaining agricultural taxation that still disadvantages African farmers relative to all other farmers in the world, (2) improve its services for small farmers, (3) significantly increase its investment in agricultural technology generation and dissemination at national and <b>subregional</b> <b>levels,</b> (4) empower local governments, communities, and farmer organizations for their own development via further administrative and fiscal decentralization and community-driven development, and (5) strengthen the already existing regional agricultural institutions for agricultural trade, biosafety, phytosanitary regulations, seed production, regulation and trade, and technology generation. ...|$|R

40|$|With the {{expansion}} of organized crime in Central America, the countries in this continental sub-region have enacted {{a great deal of}} internal legislation, and have ratified international treaties at the universal, regional and Central American level, particularly after the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime took effect in 2000. This abundance of laws is very positive, and is an expression of these Central American States’ intent to fulfill their supranational obligations and provide security for their inhabitants. However, it is also negative in that it has led to dispersion, dislocation, discrepancies and inaccuracies regarding the prevailing legal regulations, because national laws have been developed with different concepts, structures, approaches, scope and definitions. Despite these conditions that are adverse to legal harmonization, Central America can move forward with matching its legislation against organized crime.

40|$|East Asia is {{a region}} of great global significance, {{currently}} accounting for around 30 % {{of the global economy}} by most measures, e. g. production, trade, investment and finance. It has also become increasingly integrated in various ways. Integration at the micro-level has steadily progressed since the 1960 s, as indicated by rising intraregional trade. Moreover, East Asia's economic regionalisation has become more functionally integrative, this broadly relating to the spread of transnational business and other technical systems where production, trade, and investment have become a function of each other within those systems. For example, as later explored, much of East Asia's regionalised trade concerns cross-border movement of parts and components within the international production networks of multinational enterprises. Since the 1990 s, East Asian states have in addition looked to strengthen regional cooperation and integration intergovernmentally at the macro-level, i. e. involving whole country economies. This has been driven by the need to manage their growing regional economic interdependencies and address future challenges that confront them all, such as globalisation and climate change. As we will discuss, this has been part of regional economic community-building efforts in East Asia, both across the whole region and within it at various <b>subregional</b> <b>levels.</b> We examine the key dimensions of East Asia's integration, how they have developed over time, and what likely paths lie ahead in the endeavour to strengthen regional economic community-building...|$|R
