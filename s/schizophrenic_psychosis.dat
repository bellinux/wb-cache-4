40|$|Since Kraepelin called {{dementia}} praecox what we nowadays call schizophrenia, {{cognitive dysfunction}} has {{been regarded as}} central to its psychopathological profile. Disturbed experience and integration of emotions are, both intuitively and experimentally, likely to be intermediates between basic, non-social cognitive disturbances and functional outcome in schizophrenia. While {{a number of studies}} have consistently proven that, as part of social cognition, recognition of emotional faces and voices is disturbed in schizophrenics, studies on multisensory integration of facial and vocal affect are rare. We investigated audiovisual integration of emotional faces and voices in three groups: <b>schizophrenic</b> patients, non-schizophrenic <b>psychosis</b> patients and mentally healthy controls, all diagnosed by means of the Schedules of Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN 2. 1).

About 1 % of the population suffers from psychosis worldwide and increases for those, whose closer family member have suffered with the disorder. Common symptoms of psychosis are hallucinations, delusions, flat affect, forgetfulness, alogia, avolition, and anhedonia. Currently available marketed drugs like chlorpromazine, haloperidol, clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine have some serious adverse effects such as dizziness, diabetes, weight gain, tardive dyskinesia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, sexual dysfunction, agitation, and sedation. There is no satisfactory remedy available for prevention and management of psychosis. Therefore, the demand for herbal medicine is increasing.

40|$|To {{gain more}} insight {{in the role}} of herpes viruses in the {{etiology}} of schizophrenia, the effect of a herpes virus infection on behavior and brain function was examined in rats. We have shown that herpes virus infection of the brain resulted in focal areas of brain inflammation. This was accompanied by behavioral changes and changes in the neurotransmitters dopamine and glutamate, which are also disturbed in schizophrenia. Treatment of herpes virus infected rats with clozapine and risperidone, used for treatment of schizophrenia, resulted in a decrease in brain inflammation. These studies showed that herpes viruses induce physiological changes, resembling those seen in schizophrenia. In addition, we have shown that inflammation is present in the hippocampus of <b>schizophrenic</b> patients, during <b>psychosis.</b> Furthermore, evidence was found for the presence of replicating herpes viruses in the temporal cortex. The hippocampal inflammation in schizophrenic patients may be caused by replicating herpes viruses, since the hippocampus is part of the temporal lobe. ...|$|R
40|$|Protocadherin X and Protocadherin Y (PCDHX and PCDHY) are cell-surface {{adhesion}} molecules expressed predominantly in the brain. The PCDHX/Y gene-pair {{was generated}} by an X-Y translocation approximately 3 {{million years ago}} (MYA) {{that gave rise to}} the Homo sapiens-specific region of Xq 21. 3 and Yp 11. 2 homology. Genes within this region are expected to code for sexually dimorphic human characteristics, including, for example, cerebral asymmetry a dimension of variation that has been suggested is relevant to psychosis. We examined differences in patients with <b>schizophrenic</b> or schizoaffective <b>psychosis</b> in the genomic sequence of PCDHX and PCDHY in coding and adjacent intronic sequences using denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC). Three coding variants were detected in PCDHX and two in PCDHY. However, neither the coding variants nor the intronic polymorphisms could be related to psychosis within families. Low sequence variation suggests selective pressure against sequence change in modern humans in contrast to the structural chromosomal and sequence changes including fixed X-Y differences that occurred in this region earlier in hominid evolution. Our findings exclude sequence variation in PCDHX/Y as relevant to the aetiology of psychosis. However, we note the unusual status of this region with respect to X-inactivation.

40|$|Catatonia is a {{psychomotor}} syndrome {{characterized by}} concurrent emotional, behavioral, and motor anomalies. Pathophysiological mechanisms of psy-chomotor disturbances {{may be related}} to abnormal emotional-motor processing in prefrontal cortical networks. We therefore investigated prefrontal corti-cal activation and connectivity patterns during emo-tional-motor stimulation using functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI). We investigated 10 aki-netic catatonic patients in a postacute state and com-pared them with 10 noncatatonic postacute psychi-atric controls (age-, sex-, diagnosis-, and medication-matched) and 10 healthy controls. Positive and negative pictures from the International Affective Picture System were used for emotional stimulation. FMRI measurements covered the whole frontal lobe, activation signals in various frontal cor-tical regions were obtained, and functional connectiv-ity between the different prefrontal cortical regions was investigated using structural equation modeling. Catatonic patients showed alterations in the orbitofrontal cortical activation pattern and in func-tional connectivity to the premotor cortex in negative and positive emotions compared to psychiatric and healthy controls. Catatonic behavioral and affective symptoms correlated significantly with orbitofrontal activity, whereas catatonic motor symptoms were rather related to medial prefrontal activity. It is con-cluded that catatonic symptoms may be closely related to dysfunction in the orbitofrontal cortex and consequent alteration in the prefrontal cortical net-work during emotional processing. Because we inves-tigated postacute patients, orbitofrontal cortical alterations may be interpreted as a trait marker pre-disposing for development of catatonic syndrome in <b>schizophrenic</b> or affective <b>psychosis...</b>|$|R

The present study considered the possibility of cognition-related GABRB 2 involvement by examining the association of GABRB 2 with psychosis and altruism, respectively representing psychiatric and psychological facets of social cognition. Four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped for quantitative trait analyses and population-based association studies. Psychosis was measured by either the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) or antipsychotics dosage, and altruism {{was based on a}} self-report altruism scale. The minor alleles of SNPs rs 6556547, rs 1816071 and rs 187269 in GABRB 2 were correlated with high PANSS score for positive symptoms in a Han Chinese schizophrenic cohort, whereas those of rs 1816071 and rs 1816072 were associated with high antipsychotics dosage in a US Caucasian schizophrenic cohort. Moreover, strongly significant GABRB 2 -disease associations were found among <b>schizophrenics</b> with severe <b>psychosis</b> based on high PANSS positive score, but no significant association was observed for schizophrenics with only mild psychosis. Interestingly, in addition to association with <b>psychosis</b> in <b>schizophrenics,</b> rs 187269 was also associated with altruism in healthy Han Chinese. Furthermore, parallel to correlation with severe psychosis, its minor allele was correlated with high altruism scores. These findings revealed that GABRB 2 is associated with psychosis, the core symptom and an endophenotype of schizophrenia. Importantly, the association was found across the breadth of the psychiatric (psychosis) to psychological (altruism) spectrum of social cognition suggesting GABRB 2 involvement in human cognition...|$|R
40|$|Schizophrenia is {{a chronic}} and {{disabling}} brain disease characterized by psychotic episodes with unknown etiology. It {{is suggested that}} neuroinflammation {{plays a role in}} the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Neuroinflammation is characterized by the activation of microglia cells, which show an increase in the expression of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor. The isoquinoline (R) -N-(11) C-methyl-N-(1 -methylpropyl) - 1 -(2 -chlorophenyl) isoquinoline- 3 -carboxamide ((11) C-(R) -PK 11195) is a peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ligand {{that can be used for}} the imaging of activated microglia cells, and thus neuroinflammation, with PET. We hypothesized that neuroinflammation would be more profound in <b>schizophrenic</b> patients during <b>psychosis,</b> and it was therefore investigated whether neuroinflammation was present in patients within the schizophrenia spectrum who were in a psychotic phase. Methods: Seven patients within the schizophrenia spectrum who were recovering from psychosis were included. Recovering psychosis was defined by a score of 5 or more on 1 item of the positive scale of the positive and negative symptoms scale (PANSS) or a score of 4 on 2 items. The patients were compared with 8 age-matched healthy volunteers. Dynamic 60 -min PET scans were acquired after the injection of (11) C-(R) -PK 11195. All subjects underwent T 1 - and T 2 -weighted MRI, and the scans were visually examined for abnormalities and used for anatomic coregistration in data analysis. The PET data were analyzed with a 2 -tissue-compartment model to calculate the binding potential, using the metabolite-corrected plasma curve as input. Results: A significantly higher binding potential of (11) C-(R) -PK 11195, indicative of neuroinflammation, was found in the hippocampus of schizophrenic patients than in healthy volunteers (2. 07 +/- 0. 42 vs. 1. 37 +/- 0. 30; P = 0. 004). A nonsignificant 30 % higher (11) C-(R) -PK 11195 binding potential was found in the whole-brain gray matter of schizophrenic patients. The MR images did not reveal any visual abnormalities.

40|$|Background: Typical {{symptoms}} of schizophrenia usually appear in young adult life, but problems with social interaction, activity control, motor performance, and cognition {{have often been}} noted in childhood. This thesis explores similarities and differences regarding early development between individuals with clinical diagnoses of schizophrenia and Asperger syndrome (a clinical variant of autism spectrum disorder/ASD). Methods: A Swedish version of the “Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test”, was completed by 158 university students {{with a view to}} assessing the psychometric properties of this instrument before applying it in a clinical research setting. Fifty-eight of these students completed the test twice, three weeks apart. The Bland Altman test-retest reliability method was used. For the other three substudies 46 individuals (29 men, 17 women) with a clinical diagnosis of <b>schizophrenic</b> <b>psychosis</b> (SP) and 54 (26 men, 28 women) with a clinical diagnosis of Asperger syndrome (AS) were included. In 70 % of those with SP and 83 % of those with AS, collateral information was provided by parents. The Diagnostic Interview for Social and COmmunication disorders – eleventh version (DISCO- 11) was used when interviewing these relatives. This instrument covers childhood development, adaptive functioning, and {{symptoms of}} ASD. There is a strict algorithm for ASD diagnosis. The clinical schizophrenia diagnoses were confirmed or rejected using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID-I). The rate of clinically diagnosed ADHD (and its relation to nicotine use) in adults with SP and with AS was examined. Results: Test-retest findings on the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test showed that score variation in the range of ± 4 (out of 24 possible) is to be expected for the same individual. Thirteen of the 32 cases with SP examined had a DISCO-algorithm diagnosis of ASD. Focusing only on those for whom <b>schizophrenic</b> <b>psychosis</b> was confirmed by SCID and for whom a DISCO-interview was obtained, 52 % met criteria for an ASD diagnosis. The deficits in quality of friendship and social interaction as well as restricted interests were similar/identical to those found in individuals with AS. These deficits were present prior to the psychosis according to the parental interviews. Ten per cent of the schizophrenia group and 30 % of the AS group had a clinical ADHD diagnosis. Nicotine use was common in individuals with schizophrenia, and in the Asperger syndrome group with co-existing ADHD. Conclusions: The Reading the Mind in the Eyes test had poor psychometric properties and was not considered appropriate as a reliable measure of core ASD social interaction problems. Half the cases with SCID-I-verified <b>schizophrenic</b> <b>psychosis</b> had ASD according to results of parental interview. The findings suggest the need to revisit the DSM dichotomy between ASD and schizophrenia. Furthermore, ADHD was not uncommon in schizophrenia and quite common in AS, underscoring the need for a full appraisal of childhood onset neurodevelopmental disorders (including ADHD), whenever diagnoses of schizophrenia or ASD are considered in clinical practice. The WRAADDS used as a self-rating scale for ADHD held promise for clinical use...|$|E
40|$|Background: Polypharmacy in {{psychiatry}} {{is becoming}} the rule rather than the exception. Using more drugs at same time usually occurs where single drugs are considered insufficiently effective. Subjects and methods: The sample consisted of 216 patients: 85 from Sarajevo, and 44 and 87 respectively from Mostar and Tuzla. All schizophrenic patients who were hospitalised in three University Centers of F/BiH (Sarajevo, Tuzla, Mostar) on a particular day {{are included in the}} study. This included patients of both sexes (131 (60. 65 %) males and 85 females (39. 35 %)), 20 - 60 ages, who were on antipsychotic treatment with an established diagnosis of schizophrenia by the treating psychiatrist. The research was performed in the year 2004. The census of patients was conducted simultaneously in all three Centers, using a questionnaire in which all routine prescribed antipsychotics were registered, as the common method of the administration, and the doses as well saving as data for other medications that were simultaneously prescribed to the patients that day. Results: Within the total sample the most frequently applied classical antipsychotics were haloperidol, promazine and from the group of new antipsychotics clozapine. The most frequently used other medications were biperidine and diazepam. The administration of all medication was followed through recording of individual doses, daily doses and frequency of administration. There are statistically significant differences regarding the frequency of biperidine use between the centers (p= 0. 008). Conclusion: In three University Clinical Centers of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Sarajevo, Tuzla and Mostar), the applied rule is that more drugs in the treatment of <b>schizophrenic</b> <b>psychosis</b> and doing polypharmacy is the inevitable approach to treatment. The concept behind the polypharmacy is {{based on the fact that}} antipsychotic drugs do not cover all the symptoms of <b>schizophrenic</b> <b>psychosis,</b> and that additional medications may correct iatrogenic side effects caused by antipsychotic drugs.

40|$|A dysregulation of the mesolimbic {{dopamine}} {{system in}} schizophrenia patients {{may lead to}} aberrant attribution of incentive salience {{and contribute to the}} emergence of psychopathological symptoms like delusions. The dopaminergic signal has been conceptualized to represent a prediction error that indicates the difference between received and predicted reward. The incentive salience hypothesis states that dopamine mediates the attribution of “incentive salience” to conditioned cues that predict reward. This hypothesis was initially applied in the context of drug addiction and then transferred to <b>schizophrenic</b> <b>psychosis.</b> It was hypothesized that increased firing (chaotic or stress associated) of dopaminergic neurons in the striatum of schizophrenia patients attributes incentive salience to otherwise irrelevant stimuli. Here, we review recent neuroimaging studies directly addressing this hypothesis.

We suggest that our findings are further support for the hypothesis that men have a greater biological vulnerability to negative symptoms and consequent social disability in the face of psychosis, particularly a <b>schizophrenic</b> <b>psychosis,</b> and that this may be one explanation for the apparently greater risk of definite schizophrenia and its poorer prognosis in men...|$|E
40|$|To date, the ketamine/PCP {{model of}} {{psychosis}} {{has been proposed}} {{to be one of}} the best pharmacological models to mimic <b>schizophrenic</b> <b>psychosis</b> in healthy volunteers, since ketamine can induce both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. At subanesthetic doses, ketamine has been reported to primarily block N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor complex giving support to a glutamate deficiency hypothesis in schizophrenia. Positron emission tomography was used to study ketamine-induced psychotic symptom formation in relation to cerebral metabolic alterations in healthy volunteers. Our study shows that NMDA receptor blockade results in a hyperfrontal metabolic pattern. Increased metabolic activity in the frontomedial and anterior cingulate cortex correlated positively with psychotic symptom formation, in particular with ego pathology. Analysis of correlations between syndrome scores and metabolic rate of glucose (CMRglu) or metabolic gradients (ratios) revealed that each psychopathological syndrome was associated with a number of metabolic alterations in cortical and subcortical brain regions, suggesting that not a single brain region, but distributed neuronal networks are involved in acute psychotic symptom formation.

40|$|There {{is little}} {{research}} on characteristics related to course and prognosis of early-onset psychosis. The present article aims to advance {{our knowledge of}} this disorder {{for the purpose of}} proper diagnosis and treatment. It focuses on premorbid and prodromal characteristics, treatment history, symptoms and classifications, and differences between subgroups with affective and <b>schizophrenic</b> <b>psychosis.</b> A chart review was constructed to study a group of 129 subjects (12 - 18 years) with psychotic symptoms referred to the University Medical Center in Utrecht. The group was characterized by early-but nonspecific-treatment, developmental problems (mostly social), and clear prodromal symptoms. Drug abuse, depressive symptoms, and suicidal behavior were also frequent. Male sex, a relatively long prodromal phase, school problems, and drug abuse were more indicative of the schizophrenic subgroup. Introversion was characteristic for boys with schizophrenia. Classifications, however, were not stable. These findings suggest that early recognition of psychosis can be enhanced in health and youth care facilities. Careful examination of the prodromal phase seems helpful to differentiate between schizophrenic and affective psychosis. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Pituitary {{enlargement}} {{has been}} reported in individuals with <b>schizophrenic</b> <b>psychosis</b> or an at-risk mental state for psychosis (ARMS). In a previous study, our group could show pituitary volume increase in first episode and ARMS patients with later transition to psychosis (ARMS-T). However, there are no longitudinal studies on this issue so far. We therefore examined longitudinally whether transition to psychosis would be accompanied by a further increase of pituitary volume in antipsychotic-naïve ARMS patients. Methods Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were acquired from 23 antipsychotic-naïve individuals with an ARMS. Ten subjects developed psychosis (ARMS-T) and 13 did not (ARMS-NT). ARMS-T were re-scanned after the onset of psychosis, and ARMS-NT were re-scanned {{at the end of the}} study period. Results There was no significant difference of the pituitary volume between ARMS-T and ARMS-NT in our sample, and there were no significant pituitary volume changes over time. Discussion Longitudinally, we could not detect any further volumetric changes in the pituitary volume with transition to psychosis. Conclusions This, together with the result of our previous study, could indicate that the perceived level of stress in ARMS patients is constantly high from very early onwar...|$|E
40|$|Chronic {{treatment}} with des-enkephalin-γ-endorphin (DEγE, β-endorphin 6 – 17) twice daily for 10 {{days into the}} nucleus accumbens of rats resulted in hypoactivity, while similar {{treatment with}} γ-endorphin antiserum led to a marked hyperactivity. This enhanced activity persisted for at least 3 days following discontinuation of treatment. Rats chronically treated with γ-endorphin antiserum into the nucleus accumbens habituated at a slower rate when tested repeatedly for locomotor activity, {{as well as for}} nociception. Passive avoidance behaviour was attenuated in the treated rats, when they were trained during treatment, but not when the learning trial was given before treatment and testing was performed during treatment. Treatment with γ-endorphin antiserum did not affect the diurnal rhythm in locomotion, the responsiveness to nociceptive stimulation and the basal and novelty stress induced-plasma corticosteroid levels. It is concluded that chronic treatment with γ-endorphin antiserum into the nucleus accumbens, which may lead to bio-inactivation of γ-type endorphins, causes hyperactivity and disturbances in habituation and cognitive functions. It is suggested that γ-type endorphins are physiologically involved in the control of distinct dopaminergic systems in the nucleus accumbens. The findings are discussed in relation to the role of mesolimbic dopaminergic systems in <b>schizophrenic</b> <b>psychosis...</b>|$|E
