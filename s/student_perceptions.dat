40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the study was to examine the effects of student’s gaming {{behaviors}} and perceptions of games on the engagement in the mathematics classrooms. For the study, the research team recruited 299 sixth grade students from two schools located in rural areas of Virginia in the United States and collected data. For the analytical tool, we employed Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to examine the relationship of gaming behaviors with the engagement mediated by perceptions of instructional games. We found that student’s mathematics engagement was associated with <b>student’s</b> <b>perceptions</b> of games and gaming behaviors. The game hours drew a significant path to <b>student’s</b> <b>perceptions</b> of game learning while the game frequencies had a significant path to <b>student’s</b> <b>perceptions</b> of game utility.

The main results are (1) a large positive relation between achievement and the <b>student's</b> <b>perception</b> of a positive teacher attitude toward himself, and (2) a somewhat smaller, but nonetheless significant, positive effect of the <b>student's</b> <b>perception</b> of the parents' attitude toward the student's ability to succeed in life.

Getzels and Jackson, with support from Wallen and Travers, expressed that the personality and patterns of teacher behavior and methods presented represent the main forces for the most significant variable in evaluating the teacher’s effectiveness. Goffman explains that the receptivity of the audience is highly influenced by the person introducing the lecture, the quality of the introduction, and the speaker’s involuntary expressive behavior, which becomes a decisive factor in how the audience responds to the conveying information.
