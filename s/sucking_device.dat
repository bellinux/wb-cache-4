The perforations in the slurper tubes are small, lying in the range of 0. 010 inch to 0. 100 inch. The tubes are disposed in contact with the surfaces of the heat exchanger on which the condensate is precipitated, whether fins or plates, so that the water may be directed to the tube openings by means of surface effects, together {{with the assistance of the}} air flow.

40|$|Abstract-In {{the early}} spring Lasius niger may be a {{nuisance}} indoors. These ants often originate from nests {{right next to the}} foundation, below the house or sometimes even directly under the flo. or. The ants raise the humidity, which may result in severe damage to the woodwork, due to rot. The same applies to an even greater extent to other species: L. umbratus and L. juliginosus. The present method was developed for the evaluation of insecticidal bait formulations in the field. Special emphasis was put on maintaining the colony members ' ability to communicate mutually. The study evaluated the response of L. niger to seven bait formulations, five containing azamethiphos, one containing chlorpyrifos, and a reference with no insecticide. The primary interest of the experiment was to develop a method where the palatability of the bait formulations, the ability of the baits to attract L. niger, and the ants ' acceptance of the baits could be investigated. Thirty-four ant nests were used. When the number of ants on a jam bait indicated high activity, the test was initiated. A new jam bait was put into position for fifteen minutes and then replaced by the test bait for fifteen minutes. This was repeated three times. The number of ants visiting each bait was counted, and a small portion was collected by a <b>sucking</b> <b>device</b> when leaving the bait. The latter was observed for up to 24 hours to estimate the mortality. The results with the reference bait showed that the ants were only slightly affected by the method, while the palatability of the test baits ranged from as good as the controls to complete repellence. This result was confirmed by the percentage of ants killed. And both results indicate that the method could be used to establish comparable data for the efficacy of ant baits...|$|E

40|$|Several {{passive and}} active {{techniques}} were studied and developed by compressor designers {{with the aim}} of improving the aerodynamic behavior of compressor blades by reducing, or even eliminating, flow separation. Fluidic-based methods, in particular, have been investigated for a long time, including both steady and unsteady suction, blowing and oscillating jets. Recently, synthetic jets (zero mass flux) have been proposed as a promising solution to reduce low-momentum fluid regions inside turbomachines. Synthetic jets, with the characteristics of zero net mass flux and non-zero momentum flux, do not require a complex system of pumps and pipes. They could be very efficient because at the suction part of the cycle the low-momentum fluid is <b>sucked</b> into the <b>device,</b> whereas in the blowing part a high-momentum jet accelerates it. To the authors' knowledge, the use of synthetic jets has never been experimented in transonic compressor rotors, where this technique could be helpful (i) to reduce the thickness and instability of blade suction side boundary layer after the interaction with the shock, and (ii) to delay the arising of the low-momentum region which can take place from the shock-tip clearance vortex interaction at low flow operating conditions, a flow feature which is considered harmful to rotor stability. Therefore, synthetic jets could be helpful to improve both efficiency and stall margin in transonic compressor rotors. In this paper, an accurate and validated CFD model is used to simulate the aerodynamic behavior of a transonic compressor rotor with and without synthetic jets. Four technical solutions were evaluated, different for jet position and velocity, and one was investigated in detail. Synthetic jets Transonic blade Performance improvement...|$|R
40|$| {{were also}} performed. Preputial sucking and urine {{drinking}} were seldom {{in this period}} from 8 to 20 weeks after arrival (together less than 0, 3 %). Occasional licking outside feeding periods was observed in the crates {{as soon as the}} calves were able to reach over the sidewalls, which shows their desire for social contacts. Head butting against inanimate objects and jumping as an introduction to play were more frequent in the individual crates than in the group pens (together 0, 4 % against 0, 2 %), which may indicate a need for social play in the individually housed animals. Exploration by the crated calves was confined to the licking and sniffing at the front part of the crates and the surveying of the area in front of and behind the crates. As a consequence of the limited (visual) contact with the environment, the calves in the crates were quickly alarmed, in contrast to those in the group pens, which could survey the environment even when lying. Eating and ruminating were clearly enhanced in the group pens with straw bedding and ad libitum straw for feeding (7 and 22 % respectively) as compared to the group pens with slatted floors and a limited supply of straw cobs (1, 5 and 9, 5 % respectively) or the individual crates with small gifts of straw or straw cobs (1 - 2 % and 8 - 12 % respectively). The performance of stereotypies such as the licking (4 - 5 %) or scraping (2 - 3 %) of objects and tongue playing (2 %) was not affected by individual or group housing as such, but these activities were somewhat reduced when straw supply was ad libitum instead of restricted. Wooden slatted floors were slippery and uneven in comparison to concrete slatted floors with straw bedding although this probably did not interfere with the mobility of the calves, for instance during head butting and mounting. As a first step in finding ways of preventing preputial sucking and urine drinking, it is described in chapter V how the orientation of sucking behaviour develops in calves which are loose housed in groups of five upon arrival. Initially, sucking was orientated towards physical objects or body parts of congeners other than the prepuce. Most calves preferred a certain body part or (more seldom) a physical object for sucking, such as the ears, mouth, legs or scrotum of penmates, the rim of a bucket or a horizontal bar. These preferences differed among individual calves and usually changed over time. In the second and third week after arrival, many calves showed a preference for sucking at the prepuce of congeners. In reaction, the sucked calf usually started to urinate, while the sucking calf held on to the prepuce and ingested most of the urine. This preputial sucking was observed in the first 6 - 8 weeks after arrival; thereafter, the frequency of this behaviour and of the other sucking activities was strongly reduced in all calves. Seven out of the 30 calves in this study never sucked the prepuce and two only seldom. In most calves, preputial sucking took up several hours per day, whereas sucking at physical objects or other body parts lasted one hour per day at most. Moreover, preputial sucking occurred during several activity periods throughout the day and night, whereas other sucking was concentrated at feeding times. Individual preferences or aversions for sucking at the prepuce of particular penmates were uncommon. Persistent preputial sucking resulted in the loss of hair around the muzzle and cases of poor growth among the sucking calves, whereas hairloss of the prepuce and avoidance reactions occurred among the calves which were sucked. Urine drinking, the licking of the urine jet of a urinating calf, was relatively harmless and infrequent; it was performed by preputial suckers as well as non-preputial suckers. On the basis of this information, two hypotheses were proposed. The first one implicated that the attraction of preputial sucking as compared to other sucking was connected to the intake of urine during this activity. The second one suggested that the absence of preputial sucking in some calves had to do with their early sucking experience. Both hypotheses were tested in chapter VI. In a pilot study (chapter VI. 1), several <b>sucking</b> and drinking <b>devices</b> were presented in different combinations to calves in group pens which had been fed during the first day of their life either with open buckets, with teat buckets or by the mother cow. All calves were fed a milk replacer in open buckets twice daily. The drinking and sucking behaviour of the calves was registered during one 24 hour period in weeks 2, 3 and 4 after arrival. Teats connected to a water reservoir were sucked more than empty teats, which suggests that the release of fluid from the sucked object is an incentive in sucking. This indirectly supports the idea that the excretion of urine stimulates preputial sucking. Furthermore, 11 out of 22 open bucket reared calves and 2 out of 10 cow reared calves started preputial sucking, whereas all 8 teat bucket reared calves refrained from this activity, which tentatively shows that early sucking experience may influence the frequency of preputial sucking. Next (chapter VI. 2), it is argued that the provision of only small amounts of milk replacer during the first weeks of the fattening period (3 - 4 l/calf/day) may lead to a fluid deficit which {{may be one of the}} causes of preputial sucking. Therefore, the effect of extra water supply on the incidence of preputial sucking was investigated. In three replicate experiments, 3 - 5 l water (25 - 35 °C) was provided two or three times per day in open buckets to a total of 60 calves in groups of five, whereas 60 other group housed calves did not receive extra water. Total fluid intake (milk replacer + water) was on average two to three times higher in the extra water groups than in the control groups of calves (for instance in week 3 : 14 l against 5 l/calf/day). Nevertheless, in extra water groups 10 calves started preputial sucking against 14 calves in the groups without extra water; there was no significant influence of an extra supply of water on the incidence of preputial sucking. In one of the three replicates, drinking intensity of all individual calves was measured every two days by recording latency till drinking and drinking rate in separate "drinking tests". Surprisingly, the drinking intensity of calves provided with extra water was no less than that of calves without extra water. Moreover, those calves which drank the maximum of 15 l of water daily showed the highest drinking intensity. This raises some interesting questions concerning water intake regulation in these young calves. In the last section (chapter VI. 3), it was investigated if early sucking experience indeed affected the development of preputial sucking as suggested by earlier data. In the first experiment 20 bucket reared, 15 teat bucket reared and 5 cow reared calves were kept in groups of five and fed twice daily from open buckets. 13 out of 20 bucket reared calves and three out of five cow reared calves started preputial sucking, whereas again none of the 15 teat bucket reared calves engaged in this behaviour. The difference between bucket and teat bucket reared calves was significant (p(one-tailed) = 0, 028). In the second experiment, eight bucket reared and nine teat bucket reared calves were observed, but preputial sucking did not occur. In this experiment, the contacting and sucking of a teat was studied by presenting a non-nutritive teat to each calf individually for 5 minute periods, six times a day. Four out of eight bucket reared calves usually failed to suck the teat, whereas all nine teat bucket reared ones nearly always attached to the teat and sucked. The average duration of sucking of those calves which contacted the teat was similar in both groups. The fact that in three experiments none out of a total of 32 teat bucket reared calves engaged in preputial sucking, compared to 24 out of 50 bucket reared and 5 out of 15 cow reared calves, strongly suggests that early sucking experience influences the development of preputial sucking. Furthermore, the failure of some of the bucket reared calves to attach to the teat may indicate that such calves are less likely to find the teats of an automatic feed dispenser on their own as compared to teat bucket reared calves. The practical consequences of these findings should be investigated further with a larger number of animals. Although the previous results advanced the understanding of how preputial sucking develops and what factors are involved in its causation, they did not provide an instant method for preventing this unwanted behaviour. Since at present, tethering the calves and separating them by small partitions during the first 6 - 8 weeks after arrival seems the only effective and practical way to avoid preputial sucking, different tethering methods were evaluated regarding their consequences for calf behaviour (chapter VII). Stalls (i. e. spaces where single calves were tethered between partitions) of 0, 48 m and 0, 58 m in width were equipped with either 0, 48 m long chains with contraweights (0, 2 kg) which were guided through openings in the feeding gate or fixed chains of medium length (0, 40 m); in a second experiment, the long chains with contraweights were replaced by short fixed chains (0, 34 m). Different lying postures and patterns of standing up and lying down were recorded, mainly from 6 to 9 weeks after arrival, just before the calves were untethered. The tethering of calves in 0, 48 m wide stalls restricted lying on the side or on the brisket with the hindlegs stretched at 6 and 8 weeks to about the same extent as housing in 0, 70 m wide crates at 8 weeks; in 0, 58 m wide stalls, both lying postures were hindered less. The stretching of the forelegs in these different types of stalls was not impaired. Stalls of 0, 48 m in width restricted the lying with the head turned backwards in contrast to stalls of 0, 58 m in width, but these restrictions were not serious. The use of chains of 0, 34 m in length and chains provided with contraweights to prevent entanglement of the forelegs was unnecessary and moreover, it hindered the turning of the head backwards during lying; these chains should not be used. In all tethering stalls, the space in front of the calves was insufficient to swing the head forwards freely when standing up. Casual contacts with the partitions or restrictions by the chains were of minor importance, since they did not really interfere with standing up and lying down. In general, standing up and lying down occurred without great difficulty, but the calves' performance deteriorated in cold conditions. Moreover, at temperatures below approximately 8 °C, which is the lower critical value for veal calves of 4 - 10 weeks of age, they experienced discomfort, as appeared from the shivering of the animals and extreme postural changes including the tucking in of all legs and the burying of the head in the flank. Therefore, such low temperatures are clearly disagreeable. The support of the head while lying, which is necessary for the relaxation of the neck muscles during paradoxical sleep (PS), was diminished in the individual crates as a result of restrictions to lying with the head turned backwards. The consequences of this impairment for the performance of PS in calves of about one week old were examined in chapter VIII. Lying with the head turned backwards was obstructed for 24 hours by the use of a short halter and the performance of PS was measured before, during and after this obst...|$|R
