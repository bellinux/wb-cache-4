50|$|<b>Subclutter</b> <b>visibility</b> {{involves}} the maximum ratio of clutter power to target power, which {{is proportional to}} dynamic range. This determines performance in heavy weather and near the earth surface.|$|E
40|$|An {{innovative}} {{scheme is}} presented for moving target detection and high-resolution focusing that exploits {{a bank of}} chirp scaling algorithms (CSA), each one matched to a different along track target velocity component. The new scheme is thought for multichannel (MC) synthetic aperture radar systems, to provide a high-resolution focusing of the moving targets. Adequate target detection capability is ensured by integrating the aforementioned bank of CSA with a post-Doppler space-time adaptive processing clutter cancellation step. The presented scheme is very efficient from a computational {{point of view and}} is able to achieve <b>subclutter</b> <b>visibility</b> for the moving targets. The effectiveness of the proposed techniques is shown with reference to an emulated MC data set...|$|E
40|$|Future {{control of}} {{increasing}} air traffic on international routes will require significant advances in techniques employed. Development is underway, {{but at this}} time does not include addition of radar coverage of vast areas of oceanic traffic. This paper addresses {{the potential for a}} space-based radar to provide detection and track of aircraft in future traffic scenarios. Factors that must be considered in further tradeoff and concept optimization are discussed. These include: (1) satellite constellation characteristics and associated coverage, (2) efficient use of available energy in track-while-scan strategies, (3) development of tracker approaches to accommodate inherent system constraints, and (4) the application of transponders to assist in dense traffic environments. The analysis assumes the continued development and availability of technology required for high spacecraft power systems (hundreds of kilowatts), and for radar <b>subclutter</b> <b>visibility...</b>|$|E
40|$|This is Volume 2 of {{the final}} report {{summarizing}} two years of work on ground-based foliage-penetration radar. The design and implementation of a breadboard radar system and of a theoretical and experimental investigation of target and propagation phenomena specific to the foliage-penetration problem are described. The radar is a coherent UHF system which uses a large (80 -foot-diameter), semicircular electronically steered array antenna. All signal processing (including pulse compression), MTI processing, and automatic detection use digital circuitry. The digital signal-processing chain ends in a rather sophisticated thresholding algorithm which provides constant-false-alarm-rate detection for real-time area search operation of the radar. In addition to this area search mode, the radar can be operated as a measurements system which records radar measurements digitally on magnetic tape for more detailed non-real-time processing. Finally, the radar can be operated to produce real-time periodograms of returns from a single range azimuth resolution cell. This mode is useful for monitoring the radars performance {{as well as for}} making preliminary investigation of various target and clutter returns. Operating results and capabilities are described briefly. Volume 1 comprises three main sections: a short introduction; an overall description of the radar; and detailed descriptions of the hardware and software subsystems in the radar. Volume 2 describes the use of the radar as a measurements system for studying targets and the clutter environment, in addition to its use for demonstrating the feasibility of radar detection of walking men in foliage. Investigations of target return spectra, clutter return spectra, and clutter return amplitude statistics are reported. Theoretical models relating clutter spectra to wind turbulence and tree resonances are presented and compared with experimental results. Similarly, a previous theoretical prediction of target return spectra is compared with experimental results. Clutter return amplitude statistics are measured and found to be Gaussian under certain conditions. Finally, Vol. 2 contains some comments on the relationships between the <b>subclutter</b> <b>visibility</b> and various parameters of digital MTI systems...|$|E
