25|$|To prevent false-triggering of the {{automatic}} flush, most infrared detectors require that a presence be detected {{for at least}} five seconds, such as when a person is standing in front of it. This prevents a whole line of automatic flush units from triggering in succession if <b>someone</b> <b>just</b> walks past them. The automatic flush mechanism also typically waits for the presence to go out of sensor range before flushing. This reduces water usage, compared to a sensor that would trigger a continuous flushing action the whole time that a presence is detected.|$|E
25|$|Depth {{of field}} can be {{anywhere}} from {{a fraction of a}} millimeter to virtually infinite. In some cases, such as landscapes, it may be desirable to have the entire image sharp, and a large DOF is appropriate. In other cases, artistic considerations may dictate that only a part of the image be in focus, emphasizing the subject while de-emphasizing the background, perhaps giving only a suggestion of the environment (Langford 1973, 81). For example, a common technique in melodramas and horror films is a closeup of a person's face, with <b>someone</b> <b>just</b> behind that person visible but out of focus. A portrait or close-up still photograph might use a small DOF to isolate the subject from a distracting background. The use of limited DOF to emphasize one part of an image is known as selective focus, differential focus or shallow focus.|$|E
500|$|After the game, Gary Anderson was {{described}} as [...] "inconsolable." [...] Although the Vikings still led by seven points at the time, his missed kick had a demoralizing effect on the team. ESPN contributor Ben Goessling noted [...] "how swiftly it pulled the bottom {{out from under a}} team that had an air of inevitability about it to that point." [...] Writing for the website Sporting News, Jeff Diamond, the Vikings' general manager in 1998, observed that, [...] "Our team played the rest of the game as if it was in shock that our automatic kicker had missed at the most critical time." [...] Randle concurred, describing his reaction to the kick as, [...] "I was standing there like <b>someone</b> <b>just</b> punched me in my stomach, and was like, 'Oh my God, oh my God.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Lucie Delarue-Mardrus wrote love poems to Barney in {{the early}} years of the century, and in 1930 {{depicted}} her in a novel, L'Ange et les Pervers (The Angel and the Perverts), in which she said she [...] "analyzed and described Natalie at length as well as the life into which she initiated me". [...] The protagonist of the novel is a hermaphrodite named Marion who lives a double life, frequenting literary salons in female dress, then changing from skirt to trousers to attend gay soirées. Barney is Laurette Wells, a salon hostess who spends much of the novel trying to win back an ex-lover loosely based on Renée Vivien. The book's portrayal of her is, at times, harshly critical, but she is the only person whose company Marion enjoys. [...] Marion tells Wells that she is [...] "perverse... dissolute, self-centered, unfair, stubborn, sometimes miserly... a genuine rebel, ever ready to incite others to rebellion.... ou are capable of loving <b>someone</b> <b>just</b> as they are, even a thief—in that lies your only fidelity. [...] And so you have my respect." ...|$|E
500|$|Glenn Gamboa of Newsday {{found that}} Hilson gets {{incredibly}} riled up on [...] "The Way You Love Me". Rob Sheffield chose [...] "The Way You Love Me" [...] {{as one of}} the high points that are worth digging out and called its content [...] "electro-porn." [...] Mikael Wood of Entertainment Weekly called the song a [...] "raunchy" [...] one. Chris Parkin Yahoo! Music commented that the [...] "fantastic banger 'The Way you Love Me' , [...] filthy song, that makes like the oversexed, doolally cousin of Beyoncé Knowles' [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] (2003). Idolator's staff members described [...] "The Way you Love Me" [...] as a [...] "pretty much the definition of down-and-dirty, adequately conveying a sexual energy perfect for, shall we say, a 'particular' type of dancing." [...] They also said that vocals of Hilson sound [...] "less like it was recorded during the throes of passion and more like <b>someone</b> <b>just</b> cut her off on the freeway". However, they ended up saying that the song works. Neil Miller, Jr. of UR Chicago called [...] "The Way You Love Me" [...] an undeniable standout on the record thanks to its [...] "serious bass to rattle your trunk, some tweaked out synth stabs, and Hilson's bad bitch attitude." [...] By contrast, Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine said that it seems that Hilson has begun trusting her ability [...] "to thrust her hips toward recoiling cameras more than she believes in the power of her vocal track." ...|$|E

It explained [...] "Nearly everything that makes [...] "The Simpsons" [...] what it is can be found here. Most important is the large cast of Springfield residents used to perfection...Clearly, real thought and lots of it goes into each episode's creation", and added [...] "it's almost miraculous how fresh and sharp [...] "The Simpsons" [...] remains in its thirteenth year on air". The site explained [...] "Not every moment here is brilliant. After a rocky start, the season really hits its groove a few episodes in. Even though jokes don't always land, there are guaranteed {{to be at least}} a few amusing moments per episode. The stylings haven't changed all that much. There are tasteful homages and cultural references, including loving parodies of classic movies, television, and literature [...] as usual, tons of famous guest stars lend their voices, some as themselves and others as fictional characters". Adam Rayner of WhatCulture wrote that [...] "Season thirteen represents a time when the show was clinging to the classic humour that was derived from situations that were rooted in a reality – albeit a heightened reality – which could happen to you and your family, while slowly descending into the surreal and farcical." [...] Matt Wheeldon of GoodFilmGuide said [...] "the 13th Season another solid, and fairly memorable, effort from the world’s best loved cartoon; even if it isn’t the be all and end all of Simpsons cartooning. DVD Talk's Ryan Keefer gave a season 3.5/5 stars and said [...] "While Jean might not have brought things to previous glory, he certainly righted the ship in Season 13." [...] Blu-Ray.com gave season 13 a 3.5/5 and Casey Broadwater's sentiment was [...] "The hit-to-miss ratio is much better here than in the previous three seasons, and while the episodes are never quite as hilarious as the Simpsons of old—from way back in the early 1990s—season 13 does mark a turning point for the series." [...] Ron Martin of 411 Mania was more critical giving the season a 6.5/10. Part of the verdict was [...] "Season 13 is representative of the chaotic scatterbrained nature the show would take on from here on out." [...] Casey Burchby of DVD Talk gave the season a 3/5 and wrote [...] "the thirteenth season is further proof of the regrettable change in comic tone that the series took on {{in the early part of}} the last decade." ...|$|E

6000|$|They {{travelled}} next day, reaching London at half-past two. Betty {{had gone}} up {{in the early morning}} to prepare the way. The dogs had been with Aunt Rosamund all this time. Gyp missed their greeting; but the installation of Betty and the baby in the spare room that was now to be the nursery, absorbed all her first energies. Light was just beginning to fail when, still in her fur, she took a key of the music-room and crossed the garden, to see how all had fared during her ten weeks' absence. What a wintry garden! How different from that languorous, warm, moonlit night when Daphne Wing had come dancing out of the shadow of the dark trees. How bare and sharp the boughs against the grey, darkening sky--and not a song of any bird, not a flower! She glanced back at the house. Cold and white it looked, but there were lights in her room and in the nursery, and <b>someone</b> <b>just</b> drawing the curtains. Now that the leaves were off, one could see the other houses of the road, each different in shape and colour, as is the habit of London houses. It was cold, frosty; Gyp hurried down the path. Four little icicles had formed beneath the window of the music-room. They caught her eye, and, passing round to the side, she broke one off. There must be a fire in there, for she could see the flicker through the curtains not quite drawn. Thoughtful Ellen had been airing it! But, suddenly, she stood still. There was more than a fire in there! Through the chink in the drawn curtains she had seen two figures seated on the divan. Something seemed to spin round in her head. She turned to rush away. Then a kind of superhuman coolness came to her, and she deliberately looked in. He and Daphne Wing! His arm was round her neck. The girl's face riveted her eyes. It was turned a little back and up, gazing at him, the lips parted, the eyes hypnotized, adoring; and her arm round him seemed to shiver--with cold, with ecstasy? ...|$|E
