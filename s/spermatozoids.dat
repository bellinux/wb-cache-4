The {{investigations}} of Ikeno, Hirase, Webber, and Shaw have given increased interest and importance to all facts {{bearing on the}} process of fertilization in plants. This interest centers on those groups which mark the boundary line between the lower and the higher forms. The correspondence between the results of Ikeno's work on Cycas revoluta and those of Shaw on Onoclea makes necessary a close study of the details of the fusion of the egg and <b>spermatozoid</b> for related forms. Previous investigations in both animals and plants have shown the <b>spermatozoid</b> as losing its distinct character and assuming the form and appearance of a resting nucleus of equal or nearly equal size with the nucleus of the egg before their final fusion.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{technique}} to compute the fraction of boar <b>spermatozoid</b> heads which present an intracellular density distribution pattern hypothesized as normal by veterinary experts. This approach offers a potential for digital image processing estimation of sperm capacitation which can substitute expensive staining techniques. We extract a model distribution from a training set of heads assumed as normal by veterinary experts. We also consider two other training sets, one with heads similar to the normal pattern and another formed by heads that substantially deviate from that pattern. For each <b>spermatozoid</b> head, a deviation from the model distribution is computed. This produces a conditional probability distribution of that deviation for each set. Using a set of test images, we determine the fraction of normal heads in each image and compare it with the result of expert classification. This yields an absolute error below 0. 25 in the 89 % of the samples. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Ayahuasca is a psychoactive {{beverage}} used ancestrally by indigenous Amazonian tribes and, more recently, by Christian religions in Brazil {{and other}} countries. This study aimed {{to investigate the}} reproductive effects of this beverage in male Wistar rats after chronic exposure. The rats were treated by gavage every other day for 70 days at 0 (control), 1 ×, 2 ×, 4 × and 8 × the dose used in a religious ritual (12 animals per group), and animals euthanized on the 71 st day. Compared to controls, {{there was a significant}} decrease in food consumption and body weight gain in rats from the 4 × and 8 × groups, and {{a significant increase in the}} brain and stomach relative weight at the 8 × group. There was a significant increase in total serum testosterone, and a decrease in spermatic transit time and spermatic reserves in the epididymis caudae in the 4 × group, but not in the highest dose group. No significant changes were found in the other reproductive endpoints (<b>spermatozoid</b> motility and morphology, total <b>spermatozoid</b> count and daily sperm production), and histology of testis and epididymis. This study identified a no-observed-adverse-effect-level for chronic and reproductive effects of ayahuasca in male Wistar rats at 2 × the ritualistic dose, which corresponds in this study to 0. 62 mg/kg bw N, N-dimethyltryptamine, 6. 6 mg/kg bw harmine and 0. 52 mg/kg bw harmaline. A potential toxic effect of ayahuasca in male rats was observed at the 4 × dose, with a non-monotonic dose–response.

[...] The zoid of the ginkgo is approximately 86 micrometers long and also can contain thousands of flagella.

40|$|A {{linkage map}} of 40 linkage groups (LGs) was {{developed}} for brook charr, Salvelinus fontinalis, using an F 2 interstrain hybrid progeny (n = 171) and 256 coding gene SNP developed specifically for brook charr and validated from a large (> 1000) subset of putative SNP, as well as 81 microsatellite markers. To identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) related to reproduction functions, these fish were also phenotyped at six physiological traits, including <b>spermatozoid</b> head diameter, sperm concentration, plasma testosterone, plasma 11 -keto-testosterone, egg diameter, and plasma 17 β-estradiol. Five significant QTL were detected over four LGs for egg diameter and plasma 17 β-estradiol concentration in females, and sperm concentration as well as <b>spermatozoid</b> head diameter in males. In females, two different QTLs located on LG 11 and LG 34 {{were associated with the}} egg number, whereas one QTL was associated with plasma 17 β-estradiol concentration (LG 8). Their total percent variance explained (PVE) was 26. 7 % and 27. 6 %, respectively. In males, two QTL were also detected for the sperm concentration, and their PVE were estimated at 18. 58 % and 14. 95 %, respectively. The low QTL number, associated with the high PVE, suggests that the variance in these reproductive physiological traits was either under the control of one major gene or a small number of genes. The QTL associated with sperm concentration, plasma 17 β-estradiol, and egg diameter appeared to be under a dominance effect, whereas the two others were under a negative additive effect. These results show that genes underlying the phenotypic variance of these traits are under different modes of action (additive vs. dominance) and may be used to predict an increase or a decrease in their phenotypic values in subsequent generations of selective breeding. Moreover, this newly developed panel of mapped SNP located in coding gene regions will be useful for screening wild populations, especially in the context of investigating the genetic impact of massive stocking of domestic brook charr to support the angling industry throughout eastern North America...|$|R
40|$|In {{eukaryotic}} cells, microtubules are nucleated {{and organized}} by protein structures called microtubule- organizing centers. There {{is a great}} diversity in structure and morphology of these structures in eukaryotic organisms. Animal centrosome, yeast spindle pole body and basal bodies of flagellar apparatus are the best known types of so called focused microtubule-organizing centers, where microtubules are nucleated from one or two concrete sites in the cell. These focused microtubule- organizing centers are replaced by diffuse centers in higher plant cells, which means that microtubules are nucleated from dispersed nucleation sites. Focused centers are rarely found in land plant cells. These focused centers comprise bicentrioles and blepharoplasts, which give rise to the locomotory apparatus of motile <b>spermatozoid</b> of bryophytes, pteridophytes, cycads and Ginkgo.
