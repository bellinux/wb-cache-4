5|$|In Judaism, the Western Wall is venerated as {{the sole}} remnant of the Holy Temple. It has become a place of pilgrimage for Jews, {{as it is the}} closest {{permitted}} accessible site to the holiest spot in Judaism, namely the Even ha-shetiya or Foundation Stone, which lies on the Temple Mount. According to one rabbinic opinion, Jews may not set foot upon the Temple Mount and doing <b>so</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> sin punishable by Kareth. While almost all historians and archaeologists and some rabbinical authorities believe that the rocky outcrop in the Dome of the Rock is the Foundation Stone, some rabbis say it is located directly opposite the exposed section of the Western Wall, near the El-kas fountain. This spot was the site of the Holy of Holies when the Temple stood.|$|E

25|$|The film is {{also thought}} notable for {{being one of}} the first adult films to be {{produced}} or directed by Bernard Natan. Scholars have expressed surprise that a beginning filmmaker would produce a work which contained sex acts which might anger or offend the target audience (straight men).

25|$|A {{federal law}} called the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) entitles an {{individual}} homeowner {{to choose a}} title insurance company when purchasing or refinancing residential property. Typically, homeowners do not make this decision for themselves and instead rely on their bank's or attorney's choice; however, the homeowner retains {{the right to choose}} a different insurer. RESPA makes it unlawful for any bank, broker, or attorney to mandate that a particular title insurance company be used. Doing <b>so</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> violation of federal law and any person or business doing so can be fined or lose its license.|$|E
25|$|This {{relates the}} cross product to the {{exterior}} product. It {{can also be}} used to represent physical quantities, like torque and angular momentum. In vector algebra they are usually represented by vectors, perpendicular to the plane of the force, linear momentum or displacement that they are calculated from. But if a bivector is used instead the plane is the plane of the bivector, <b>so</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> more natural way to represent the quantities and the way they act. It also unlike the vector representation generalises into other dimensions.|$|E
25|$|LQC models share {{features}} of LQG and <b>so</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> useful toy model. However, {{the results obtained}} {{are subject to the}} usual restriction that a truncated classical theory, then quantized, might not display the true behaviour of the full theory due to artificial suppression of degrees of freedom that might have large quantum fluctuations in the full theory. It has been argued that singularity avoidance in LQC are by mechanisms only available in these restrictive models and that singularity avoidance in the full theory can still be obtained but by a more subtle feature of LQG.|$|E

25|$|A single-argument version f(n) = A(n, n) that {{increases}} both m and n {{at the same}} time dwarfs every primitive recursive function, including very fast-growing functions such as the exponential function, the factorial function, multi- and superfactorial functions, and even functions defined using Knuth's up-arrow notation (except when the indexed up-arrow is used). It can be seen that f(n) is roughly comparable to fω(n) in the fast-growing hierarchy. This extreme growth can be exploited to show that f, which is obviously computable on a machine with infinite memory such as a Turing machine and <b>so</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> computable function, grows faster than any primitive recursive function and is therefore not primitive recursive.|$|E
25|$|Historically, the {{similarity}} of different amino acid sequences {{has been the most}} common method of inferring homology. Sequence similarity is considered a good predictor of relatedness, since similar sequences are more likely the result of gene duplication and divergent evolution, rather than the result of convergent evolution. Amino acid sequence is typically more conserved than DNA sequence (due to the degenerate genetic code), <b>so</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> more sensitive detection method. Since some of the amino acids have similar properties (e.g., charge, hydrophobicity, size), conservative mutations that interchange them are often neutral to function. The most conserved sequence regions of a protein often correspond to functionally important regions like catalytic sites and binding sites, since these regions are less tolerant to sequence changes.|$|E
25|$|Fafhrd is a {{very tall}} (nearly seven feet) and strong {{northern}} barbarian, skilled at both swordsmanship and singing; the Mouser is a small (not much more than five feet) mercurial thief, gifted and deadly at swordsmanship (often using a sword {{in one hand and}} a long dagger—technically a main-gauche—in the other), and a former wizard's apprentice who retains some skill at magic. Fafhrd talks like a romantic, but his strong practicality usually wins through, while the cynical-sounding Mouser is prone to showing strains of sentiment at unexpected times. Both are rogues, living in a decadent world where to be <b>so</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> requirement of survival. They spend a lot of time drinking, feasting, wenching, brawling, stealing, and gambling, and are seldom fussy about who hires their swords. But they are humane and—most of all—relish true adventure.|$|E

25|$|The most {{important}} element of this Part was the extension of rights of audience in the higher courts to solicitors and other legal professionals. Sections 27 and 28 of Part II give an advocate rights of audience {{and the right to}} conduct litigation if the advocate is qualified to do <b>so,</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> member of a professional body recognised by the Lord Chancellor and that body considers him qualified to conduct litigation. A person also has rights of audience if they have been directly granted it, for example by the Lord Chancellor in County Court proceedings. The most immediate effect of this is that solicitors can now gain rights of audience in the Crown Court, High Court, Court of Appeal, Court of Session, Privy Council, and House of Lords if they qualify as Solicitor Advocates. Solicitor's clerks also have rights of audience in the chambers of judges in the Crown Court and High Court, assuming they are being instructed by a qualified solicitor.|$|E

500|$|A. amplexus {{was named}} by Gregory S. Paul for giant Morrison allosaur remains, and {{included}} in his conception Saurophagus maximus (later Saurophaganax).

[...] Following Paul's work, this species has been accepted as a synonym of A. fragilis. An 2010 study by Paul and Kenneth Carpenter, however, indicates that Epanterias is temporally younger than the A. fragilis type specimen, <b>so</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> separate species at minimum.|$|E
