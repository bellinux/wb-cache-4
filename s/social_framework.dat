500|$|The {{most basic}} frames are called primary {{framework}}s. A primary framework takes an individual's experience or {{an aspect of}} a scene that would originally be meaningless and makes it meaningful. One type of primary framework is a natural framework, which identifies situations {{in the natural world}} and is completely biophysical, with no human influences. The other type of framework is a <b>social</b> <b>framework,</b> which explains events and connects them to humans. An example of a natural framework is the weather, and an example of a <b>social</b> <b>framework</b> is a meteorologist who predicts the weather. Focusing on the social frameworks, Goffman seeks to [...] "construct a general statement regarding the structure, or form, of experiences individuals have at any moment of their social life".|$|E

The multi-billionaires who earned their wealth through intergalactic trade were mainly satisfied with their lifestyles, although most coveted more entertainment in their lives. This resulted in a new entertainment based on the Formula One races to be founded with vehicles that could hover one foot above the track. These Grand Prix races were soon named [...] "F-Zero" [...] after a rise in popularity of the races. The game introduced the first set of F-Zero racers: Captain Falcon, Dr. Stewart, Pico, and Samurai Goroh.

[...] Cuarón and screenwriter Timothy J. Sexton began rewriting the script after the director completed Y tu mamá también. Afraid he would [...] "start second guessing things", Cuarón chose not to read P. D. James' novel, opting to have Sexton read the book while Cuarón himself read an abridged version. Cuarón did not immediately begin production, instead directing Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. During this period, David Arata rewrote the screenplay and delivered the draft which secured Clive Owen and sent the film into pre-production. The director's work experience in the United Kingdom exposed him to the [...] "social dynamics of the British psyche", giving him insight into the depiction of [...] "British reality". Cuarón used the film The Battle of Algiers {{as a model for}} social reconstruction in preparation for production, presenting the film to Clive Owen as an example of his vision for Children of Men. [...] In order to create a philosophical and <b>social</b> <b>framework</b> for the film, the director read literature by Slavoj Žižek, as well as similar works. The film Sunrise was also influential.|$|E

2500|$|According to some critics, the {{morality}} of the Quran, like the life story of Muhammad, {{appears to be a}} moral regression, {{by the standards of the}} moral traditions of Judaism and Christianity it says that it builds upon.

[...] William Montgomery Watt however finds Muhammad's changes an improvement for his time and place: [...] "In his day and generation Muhammad was a social reformer, indeed a reformer even in the sphere of morals. He created a new system of social security and a new family structure, both of which were a vast improvement on what went before.

60|$|Between {{the fall}} of Lewis in 1792 and {{the fall of}} Robespierre in 1794, France {{was the scene of}} two main series of events. One set {{comprises}} the repulse of the invaders, the suppression of an extensive civil war, and the attempted reconstruction of a <b>social</b> <b>framework.</b> The other comprises the rapid phases of an internecine struggle of violent and short-lived factions. By an unhappy fatality, due partly to anti-democratic prejudice, and partly to men's unfailing passion for melodrama, the Reign of Terror has been popularly taken for the central and {{most important part of the}} revolutionary epic. This is nearly as absurd as it would be to make Gustave Flourens' manifestation of the Fifth of October, or the rising of the Thirty-first of October, the most prominent features in a history of the war of French defence in our own day. In truth, the Terror was a mere episode; and just as the rising of October 1870 was due to Marshal Bazaine's capitulation at Metz, it is easy to see that, with one exception, every violent movement in Paris, from 1792 to 1794, was due to menace or disaster on the frontier. Every one of the famous days of Paris was an answer to some enemy without. The storm of the Tuileries on the Tenth of August, as we have already said, was the response to Brunswick's proclamation. The bloody days of September were the reaction of panic at the capture of Longwy and Verdun by the Prussians. The surrender of Cambrai provoked the execution of Marie Antoinette. The defeat of Aix-la-Chapelle produced the abortive insurrection of the Tenth of March; and the treason of Dumouriez, the reverses of Custine, and the rebellion in La Vendée, produced the effectual insurrection of the Thirty-first of May 1793. The last of these two risings of Paris, headed by the Commune, against the Convention which was until then controlled by the Girondins, at length gave the government of France and the defence of the Revolution definitely over to the Jacobins. Their patriotic dictatorship lasted unbroken for a short period of ten months, and then the great party broke up into factions. The splendid triumphs of the dictatorship have been, in England at any rate, too usually forgotten, and only the crimes of the factions remembered. Robespierre's history unfortunately belongs to the less important battle.|$|E

The frameworks are situated in the Critical Normative <b>Framework</b> and the <b>Social</b> Resource Framework.; Through using a critical normative framework, identified interpersonal interactions were determined and then used to follow ongoing relational interactions to examine potential utility of relationships. Further, the use of a <b>social</b> resource <b>framework</b> of <b>social</b> capital was used to identify interpersonal interactions between two minority program coordinators. Simultaneously the use of network orientations and potential empowerment paradigms were used to theorize further implications for defining the utility of the <b>social</b> resource <b>framework</b> of <b>social</b> capital.; Conclusions are drawn using these <b>social</b> capital <b>frameworks</b> to suggest how the provisions for social support in {{the context of}} developing network orientations, developing critical consciousness and co-constructing learning can reform educational practices. Within this paradigm, institutional support is designed to enable institutional actors access to expanded paradigms that could empower adults and low status, minority students. Ultimately, equitable access to educational pathways toward academic achievement can be more accurately conceptualized and defined...|$|R
