40|$|ABSTRACT: The pH {{dependence}} of the steady-state kinetic parameters for the dialkylglycine decarboxylasecatalyzed decarboxylation-dependent transamination between 2 -aminoisobutyrate (AIB) and pyruvate is presented. The pH {{dependence of}} methylation and DTNB modification reactions, and spectroscopic properties, is used to augment the assignment of the kinetic pKa’s to <b>specific</b> <b>ionizations.</b> The coincidence of pKa values (∼ 7. 4) observed in kcat/KAIB, 1 /KAIB, Kis for pyruvate, KPLP, and in absorbance and fluorescence titrations demonstrates that AIB is not a sticky substrate. It furthermore suggests that the decarboxylation step, or a conformational isomerization preceding it, limits {{the rate of the}} overall catalytic cycle. Coexisting, kinetically distinguishable conformers of DGD-PLP, originating from an alkali metal ion binding site, were previously demonstrated at pH 8. 2 for DGD-PLP (Zhou, X., Toney, M. D. Biochemistry 37, 5761 - 5769). The pKa value of ∼ 8. 8 observed in kcat, kcat/KAIB, Kd for K +, spectrometric titrations, and the reaction of DGD-PLP with DTNB is tentatively assigned to the conformational change interconverting the two enzyme forms previously characterized. Three pKa’s are observed in pH titrations of the DGD-PLP coenzyme absorbance. Individual spectra for the four ionization states are deconvoluted by fitting lognormal curves. All four ionization states have both ketoenamine and enolimine tautomers present.

50|$|In Marklund's paper, {{the plasma}} convects {{radially}} inwards towards {{the center of}} a cylindrical flux tube. During this convection, the different chemical constituents of the plasma, each having its <b>specific</b> <b>ionization</b> potential, enters into a progressively cooler region. The plasma constituents will recombine and become neutral, and thus no longer {{under the influence of the}} electromagnetic forcing. The ionization potentials will thus determine where the different chemicals will be deposited. This provides an efficient means to accumulate matter within a plasma. In a partially ionized plasma, electromagnetic forces act on the non-ionized material indirectly through the viscosity between the ionized and non-ionized material. Hannes Alfvén showed that elements with the lowest ionization potential are brought closest to the axis, and form concentric hollow cylinders whose radii increase with ionization potential. The drift of ionized matter from the surroundings into the rope means that the rope acts as an ion pump, which evacuates surrounding regions, producing areas of extremely low density.|$|E
50|$|Hollow cathodes emit a dense {{cloud of}} plasma by first {{ionizing}} a gas. This creates a high density plasma plume which makes {{contact with the}} surrounding plasma. The region between the high density plume and the surrounding plasma is termed a double sheath or double layer. This double layer is essentially two adjacent layers of charge. The first layer is a positive layer {{at the edge of}} the high potential plasma (the contactor plasma cloud). The second layer is a negative layer {{at the edge of the}} low potential plasma (the ambient plasma). Further investigation of the double layer phenomenon has been conducted by several people. One type of hollow cathode consists of a metal tube lined with a sintered barium oxide impregnated tungsten insert, capped at one end by a plate with a small orifice, as shown in the below figure. Electrons are emitted from the barium oxide impregnated insert by thermionic emission. A noble gas flows into the insert region of the HC and is partially ionized by the emitted electrons that are accelerated by an electric field near the orifice (Xenon is a common gas used for HCs as it has a low <b>specific</b> <b>ionization</b> energy (ionization potential per unit mass). For EDT purposes, a lower mass would be more beneficial because the total system mass would be less. This gas is just used for charge exchange and not propulsion.). Many of the ionized xenon atoms are accelerated into the walls where their energy maintains the thermionic emission temperature. The ionized xenon also exits out of the orifice. Electrons are accelerated from the insert region, through the orifice to the keeper, which is always at a more positive bias.|$|E

40|$|Radiation from galactic {{cosmic rays}} (GCR) and solar {{particle}} events (SPE) is a serious hazard to humans and electronic instruments during space travel, particularly on prolonged missions outside the Earth s magnetic fields. Galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) is composed of approx. 98 % nucleons and approx. 2 % electrons and positrons. Although cosmic ray heavy ions are 1 - 2 % of the fluence, these energetic heavy nuclei (HZE) contribute 50 % of the long-term dose. These unusually high <b>specific</b> <b>ionizations</b> pose a significant health hazard acting as carcinogens and also causing microelectronics damage inside spacecraft and high-flying aircraft. These HZE ions are of concern for radiation protection and radiation shielding technology, because gross rearrangements and mutations and deletions in DNA are expected. Calculations have shown that HZE particles have a strong preference for interaction with light nuclei. The best shield for this radiation would be liquid hydrogen, which is totally impractical. For this reason, hydrogen-containing polymers make the most effective practical shields. Shielding is required during missions in Earth orbit and possibly for frequent flying at high altitude because of the broad GCR spectrum and during a passage into deep space and LunarMars habitation because of the protracted exposure encountered on a long space mission. An additional hazard comes from solar particle events (SPEs) which are mostly energetic protons that can produce heavy ion secondaries as well as neutrons in materials. These events occur at unpredictable times and can deliver a potentially lethal dose within several hours to an unshielded human. Radiation protection for humans requires safety in short-term missions and maintaining career exposure limits within acceptable levels on future long-term exploration missions. The selection of shield materials can alter the protection of humans by an order of magnitude. If improperly selected, shielding materials can actually increase radiation damage due to penetration properties and nuclear fragmentation. Protecting space-borne microelectronics from single event upsets (SEUs) by transmitted radiation will benefit system reliability and system design cost by using optimal shield materials. Long-term missions {{on the surface of}} the Moon or Mars will require the construction of habitats to protect humans during their stay. One approach to the construction is to make structural materials from lunar or Martian regolith using a polymeric material as a binder. The hydrogen-containing polymers are considerably more effective for radiation protection than the regolith, but the combination minimizes the amount of polymer to be transported. We have made composites of simulated lunar regolith with two different polymers, LaRC-SI, a high-performance polyimide thermoset, and polyethylene, a thermoplastic...|$|R

40|$|We have {{experimentally}} and theoretically {{investigated the}} behavior of excited Na atoms under the combined influence of resonant laser light and a weak magnetic field. The use of weak magnetic fields gives another possibility to vary the polarization of the atoms, additional to variation of the polarization of the exciting laser. We calculated in detail the influence of weak magnetic fields on the density matrix describing the excited atoms, using generalized rate equations. We checked {{the results of our}} model experimentally, at the Na(3 2 S 1 / 2, Fl = 2) → (3 2 P 3 / 2, Fu = 3) transition, excited with circularly polarized light. We determined the polarization of the excited atoms, by measuring the fluorescence light at various angles, as a function of both magnetic field strength and laser irradiance. Model and experiment agreed very well. We applied our model to the associative ionization of the excited Na atoms. We measured the ion signal as a function of magnetic field. Analyzing the results, we could determine a <b>specific</b> associative <b>ionization</b> cross section, which is not accessible in our experimental geometry without the use of magnetic fields. Thereby we showed that the application of magnetic fields in polarization dependence studies can provide us with additional information about the process. ...|$|R

40|$|The erosion {{model of}} the surface {{coatings}} of reed switches considering different physicochemical processes occurring on the contact surfaces and inside the inter-electrode gap was proposed. According to that, the discrete electron avalanche (ecton) introduced in the explosive electron emission theory by Mesyats is considered as the main motive force responsible for the surface modification and mass transfer of materials {{in the course of}} breaking/shorting of the contacts. By means of SEM imaging and energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis of the contact surfaces after various numbers of switching cycles, the energy threshold of the ecton generation defining the erosion stability of the coatings was found to be proportional to the <b>specific</b> sublimation and <b>ionization</b> energies of coating materials.

40|$|Energy-filtering TEM (EFTEM) {{has turned}} out to be a very {{efficient}} and rapid tool for the chemical characterization of a specimen on a nanometer and even subnanometer length scale. Especially, the detection and measurement of very thin layers has become a great application of this technique in many materials science fields, e. g. semiconductors and hard disk technology. There, the reliability of compositional profiles is an important issue. However, the experimentally obtainable spatial resolution strongly influences the appearance of a thin layer in an EFTEM image, when dimensions reach subnanometer levels, which mainly leads to a broadening of the layer in the image. This fact has to be taken into account, when measuring the thickness of such a thin layer. Additionally, the convolution decreases contrast which makes the layer less visible in the image and finally determines the detection limit. In this work we present a systematic study on specifically designed Mn/PdMn multilayer test specimens to explore the practical aspects of spatial resolution and detection limits in EFTEM. Although <b>specific</b> to the <b>ionization</b> edges used, we will present general conclusions about the practical limitations in terms of EFTEM spatial resolution.

First, a <b>specific</b> set-up for <b>ionization</b> chambers, based on a very large gas thickness, is presented. Its satisfactory performances are discussed {{in light of the}} observations during a 500 A MeV Pb+p experiment performed at the FRS (GSI). As a second topic, the possibility to use a thick layer of matter (a degrader) as a passive measurement device to identify the nuclear charge and the ionic charge state of fragments is discussed. This method, successfully used for Z identification in experiments such as Pb+p at 1 A GeV, fails to measure the charge states at 500 A MeV for the same system. It is shown that surface defects of the degrader are probably responsible for this failure. The third topic is the description of new analysis techniques developed in order to account for and subtract the contribution of polluting charge states in the spectrometer, thus making possible a clean estimation of the production cross sections of all fragments.

The primary ionization was found to be about 31 ion-pairs per cm in air at S. T. P., but the total energy loss represents about 120 ion pairs per cm in air. Approximately the same values of <b>specific</b> <b>ionization</b> were found for the positives as for the negatives. Positive and negative electrons were found to occur in nearly equal numbers and to have similar distributions in energy. Energy distribution curves are given for the positives and negatives. A brief description of the experimental procedure is given, and several track photographs are shown. In view of the discovery that hard gamma-rays of Th C′′ give rise to positives and negatives in pairs, similar to the effects found in cosmic-ray studies, it is concluded that the absorption of the Th C′′ rays {{is due in part to}} that by free negative electrons and in part to a nuclear effect which results in the production of pairs of positive and negative electrons, the former effect accounting for the greater part of the absorption of the Th C′′ rays. The symmetry in occurrence of the positive and negative electrons found in the cosmic-ray studies shows that the nuclear effect which results in the production of positive and negative electrons in pairs represents the predominant part of the absorption for the range of energies as high as those of the cosmic rays and that the absorption by free negative electrons is relatively small...|$|E
