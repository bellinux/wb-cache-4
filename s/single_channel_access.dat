40|$|Abstract—In this letter, we {{investigate}} the energy efficiency of multichannel spectrum access in cognitive radio networks. We consider two channel access schemes. In one case, a secondary user (SU) is assigned multiple channels and the channels are switched whenever a primary user (PU) returns. In the other, the SU operates {{on a single}} channel without switching to other channels. We develop an analytic framework on achievable channel utilization and energy consumption performance of the SU. From the results, we examine the trade-off between SU channel utilization and energy consumption, and identify the PU traffic conditions where one scheme outperforms the other.

After the successful reception of each data frame, the destination device may opportunistically respond with a data frame, thus being able to perform multiple RD transmissions. This operation can reduce the overall channel access overhead, hence increasing the efficiency of data transmission between two sender-receiver devices.

40|$|It is {{in recent}} years that {{harvesting}} energy from ambient energy sources (e. g., solar, wind, or vibration) has been commercialized, which is a promising technique to fulfil sustainable operations for many kinds of electrical systems. To advocate reducing the emission of greenhouse gases, people in communication society are seeking to accommodate and take advantage of this new technology for wireless systems, such as sensor networks, Internet of Things, and heterogeneous networks. In this dissertation, we focus on energy harvesting (EH) based wireless networks, where multiple users are powered by energy harvesters and share limited spectrum resources. In this system, the design of efficient access schemes plays a crucial role in optimizing the system performance. Moreover, different from the conventional wireless systems, there are two random processes that must be jointly counted in the transmission design: the channel fading and the dynamics of the EH powered battery. Specifically, we narrow down the design onto two typical network setups. First, in a <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> <b>access</b> scenario, an ad hoc network with multiple transmitter-receiver pairs is considered, where all EH-based transmitters share one channel by random access. Two EH rate models are applied: Constant and i. i. d. (i. e., independent and identically distributed) EH rate models. To quantify the roles of both the energy and channel state information, a distributed opportunistic scheduling framework is proposed such that the average throughput of the network is maximized. Second, in a multi-channel access scenario, we study an uplink transmission under a heterogeneous network hierarchy, where each EH-based mobile user (MU) is capable of both deterministically accessing to a large network via one private channel, and dynamically accessing a small network with a certain probability via one common channel shared by multiple MUs. Considering a time-correlated EH model, we study an opportunistic transmission scheme to maximize the average throughput for each MU by jointly exploiting the statistics of the system states. Finally, back to the <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> <b>access</b> setup, we investigate the multiuser energy diversity by analyzing the fundamental scaling law of the throughput over the number of EH-based users under both centralized and distributed access schemes. We reveal the throughput gain coming from both the increase of total available energy harvested over time/space and the combined dynamics of batteries...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The co-channel {{interference}} (CCI) limits {{the capacity of}} wireless networks due to {{the limited number of}} available channels {{and the fact that the}} same channel must be reused in the system. Recently, we proposed the interference-aware channel segregation based dynamic channel assignment (IACS-DCA). Stable channel reuse pattern can be formed in a distributed manner which can minimize the CCI experienced at access points (APs) or base stations (BSs). In this paper, we introduce a multi-channel access technique for the IACS-DCA. Each AP has channel priority table, in which the channels are listed by the ascending order of average CCI power. Original IACS-DCA assumes the <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> <b>access</b> using the first priority channel with the lowest average CCI power. By using multiple channels at the same time in the descending priority order, more number of users can access an AP. However, the use of channels below the first orders at the same time increases the CCI and may make the channel reuse pattern unstable. We examine, by computer simulation, the channel reuse pattern and confirm that the IACS-DCA improves the signal-to-interference power ratio (SIR) even with multi-channel access compared to the conventional quasi-DCA using multi-channel access.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the following stochastic control problem that arises in opportunistic spectrum access: a system consists of n channels (Gilbert-Elliot channels) {{where the state}} (good or bad) of each channel evolves as independent and identically distributed Markov processes. A user can select exactly k channels to sense and access (based on the sensing result) in each time slot. A reward is obtained whenever the user senses and accesses a good channel. The objective is to design a channel selection policy that maximizes the expected discounted total reward accrued over a finite or infinite horizon. In our previous work we established the optimality of a greedy policy for the special case of k = 1 (i. e., <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> <b>access)</b> {{under the condition that}} the channel state transitions are positively correlated over time.

In order to compare these protocols we focus on metrics of interest such as the receiving probability, the system throughput and the network blocking probability.

40|$|The Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) is the {{mandatory}} access method for any compliant device in Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) {{based on the}} IEEE 802. 11 Standard. WLAN Access Points (APs) and stations (STAs) contend for the access to the wireless channel in order to transmit data by using a variation of Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA). In doing so, they consume {{a significant amount of}} energy for continuously monitoring the channel state. In this paper we investigate backwards-compatible mechanisms to increase throughput and energy efficiency in WLANs during contention periods based on DCF. The first mechanism is called Bi-Directional DCF (BD-DCF) because it allows for bidirectional transmissions between APs and STAs with a <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> <b>access</b> invocation. The second mechanism is called Bi-Directional Sleep DCF (BDSL-DCF) as it allows overhearing STAs to enter the sleep state, i. e. switch off the radio transceiver, during bidirectional transmissions. We analyze the performance limits of the proposed protocols in terms of throughput and energy efficiency considering different values for the data packet length and data rate. The results of this work show that the BD-DCF and BDSL-DCF protocols can improve throughput up to 60 % and energy efficiency up to 360 % when compared to legacy DCF...|$|E
40|$|In {{a typical}} mobile ad hoc network (MANET), all nodes contend for a <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> <b>access</b> using carrier sense {{multiple}} access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA). Thus, a fundamental limitation of MANET is that, {{as the number}} of nodes increases, the performance of the system will dramatically degrade due to the large number of collisions. This, in turn, results in an overall low system throughput. Several researchers have focused on the potential throughput gains achieved using directional antennas in ad hoc networks. When compared to omnidirectional antennas, directional antennas are more attractive option in terms of power and bandwidth efficiency. On the other hand, when used in ad hoc networks, directional MAC (DMAC) protocols usually require all nodes, or part of nodes, to be aware of their exact locations. The location information is typically provided to the DMAC protocol from upper network layers, for example, by using a Global Positioning System (GPS). Other problems that face these DMAC protocols are the deafness problem and the hidden terminal problem. Solving these problems {{is at the core of}} designing any DMAC protocol. At the same time, DMC protocols should not sacrifice channel bandwidth to deal with theses problems. In this thesis, we propose an efficient 2 -channel 2 -mode DMAC protocol. In particular, our protocol employs two frequency division multiplexed channels: Channel one is used for omni mode packets transmission and channel two is used for directional mode packets transmission. Estimation of Signal Parameter via Rotational Invariance Technique (ESPRIT) is used for direction of arrival (DOA) estimation. By avoiding the reliance on GPS for obtaining the position information, our protocol is also suitable for indoor environments.

Since the nodes are mobile, the network topology may change rapidly and unpredictably over time.

The Media Access Control (MAC) data communication protocol sub-layer provides addressing and <b>channel</b> <b>access</b> mechanisms that make it possible for network nodes to <b>access</b> common wireless <b>channel</b> through Distributed Coordination Function (DCF).

40|$|Making judicious <b>channel</b> <b>access</b> and {{transmission}} scheduling decisions {{is essential for}} improving performance as well as energy and spectral efficiency in multichannel wireless systems. This problem has been a subject of extensive study in the past decade, and the resulting dynamic and opportunistic <b>channel</b> <b>access</b> schemes can bring potentially significant improvement over traditional schemes. However, a common and severe limitation of these dynamic schemes is that they almost always require some form of a priori knowledge of the channel statistics. A natural remedy is a learning framework, which has also been extensively studied in the same context, but a typical learning algorithm in this literature seeks only the best static policy, with performance measured by weak regret, rather than learning a good dynamic <b>channel</b> <b>access</b> policy. There is thus a clear disconnect between what an optimal <b>channel</b> <b>access</b> policy can achieve with known channel statistics that actively exploits temporal, spatial and spectral diversity, and what a typical existing learning algorithm aims for, which is the static use of a <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> devoid of diversity gain. In this paper we {{bridge this gap by}} designing learning algorithms that track known optimal or sub-optimal dynamic <b>channel</b> <b>access</b> {{and transmission}} scheduling policies, thereby yielding performance measured by a form of strong regret, the accumulated difference between the reward returned by an optimal solution when a priori information is available and that by our online algorithm. We do so in the context of two specific algorithms that appeared in [1] and [2], respectively, the former for a multiuser single-channel setting and the latter for a single-user multichannel setting. In both cases we show that our algorithms achieve sub-linear regret uniform in time and outperforms the standard weak-regret learning algorithms. Comment: 10 pages, to appear in MobiHoc 201...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, CMs {{of linear}} and {{non-linear}} multiple antenna receivers, in particular linear minimum {{mean squared error}} (LMMSE) and LMMSE with decision feedback (LMMSE-DF), are developed. To develop these CMs, first a simple analytical expression {{of the distribution of}} the post processing signal to interference and noise (SINR) of an LMMSE receiver is developed. This expression is then used to develop SINR- and ABER-based CMs. However, the analytical forms of these CMs are derived only for the following scenarios: (i) any number of receive antennas with three users having arbitrary received powers and (ii) two antenna receiver with arbitrary number of equal received power users. For all the other scenarios a semi-analytical CM is used. The PHY abstractions or CMs are next used in the evaluation of a random access cellular network and an ad hoc network. Analytical model of the random access cellular network is developed using the SINR- and ABER-based CM of the LMMSE receiver. The impact of receiver processing is measured in terms of throughput. In this case, the random access mechanism is modeled by a <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> S-Aloha <b>channel</b> <b>access</b> scheme. Another analytical model is developed for single and multi-packet reception in a multi-channel S-Aloha <b>channel</b> <b>access.</b> An emph{ideal} receiver is modeled in this case, i. e. the packet(s) are successfully received as long as the total number of colliding packets is not greater than the number of antennas. Throughput and delay are used as performance metrics to study the impact of different PHY designs. Finally, the SINR-based semi-analytical CMs of LMMSE and LMMSE-DF are used to evaluate the performance of multi-hop ad hoc networks. Throughput is used as the performance evaluation metric.
