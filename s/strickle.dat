Although this work {{was done in the}} context of small fishing vessels, most of it is applicable to ships' propellers in general. [...] Two lifting line theory propeller design programs were written and tested. Their usefulness was demonstrated by using test cases which involved real vessels and experimental test results. Through development of lifting surface corrections, results can be produced, from the lifting line theory which closely approximate experimental test data; also, propellers for specific vessels have been designed using the new programs. The lifting line methods for propeller design, as used here, are useful methods for designing propellers for small vessels for which few propulsive or resistive data are available and for preliminary design of other subcavitating propellers. [...] A 1 / 5 scale model of the vessel UMV SUGAR was constructed to do a set of model tests: resistance tests; open water propeller and self propulsion tests; and hot film anemometer wake measurements. Although the model was designed and constructed by the author, the tank testing was done by a visiting post-doctoral fellow, Dr. Shukai Wu. The testing program was done to determine the propulsion and resistance data required for lifting line propeller design and to compare model and full scale results. A graph of the Taylor wake fraction and thrust deduction fraction as measured from the model are given in the appendix. Complete test results are given in the reference. [...] Sea trials were performed to determine vessel propulsive performance of the UM V SUGAR and the MV BECKY A. by using a purpose designed and instrumented propeller stub shaft. Results from both full scale trials were analysed. These tests confirm previous claims of very poor propulsive efficiency for these vessels.

5000|$|In 1924, Beery married actress Rita Gilman. The couple adopted Carol Ann, {{daughter}} of Rita Beery's cousin. Both marriages ended in divorce.In December 1937, A {{few days before}} he died, comedic actor Ted Healy {{was involved in a}} drunken altercation at Cafe Trocadero on the Sunset Strip. E. J. Fleming, author of The Fixers: Eiddie Mannix, Howard <b>Strickling</b> and the MGM Publicity Machine, asserts that Healy was attacked by three men — future James Bond producer Albert “Cubby” Broccoli, local mob figure Pat DiCicco (who was Broccoli’s cousin as well as the former husband of Thelma Todd and the future husband of Gloria Vanderbilt) and Wallace Beery, a burly character actor who was one of MGM’s most popular stars — and that wounds from this beating caused him to die. In December 1939, the unmarried Beery adopted a seven-month-old infant girl Phyllis Ann. Phyllis appeared in MGM publicity photos when adopted, but was never mentioned again. Beery told the press he had taken the girl in from a single mother, recently divorced, but he had filed no official adoption papers. [...] Beery was considered misanthropic and difficult to work with by many of his colleagues. Mickey Rooney related in his autobiography that Howard <b>Strickling,</b> MGM's head of publicity, once went to Louis B. Mayer to complain that Beery was stealing props off of the studio's sets. [...] "And that wasn't all," [...] Rooney continued. [...] "He went on for some minutes about the trouble that Beery was always causing him ... Mayer sighed and said, 'Yes, Howard, Beery's a son of a bitch. But he's our son of a bitch.' <b>Strickling</b> got the point. A family has to be tolerant of its black sheep, particularly if they brought a lot of money into the family fold, which Beery certainly did." [...] Child actors, in particular, recalled unpleasant encounters with Beery. Jackie Cooper, who made several films with him early in his career, called him [...] "a big disappointment", and accused him of upstaging, and other attempts to undermine his performances, out of what Cooper presumed was jealousy. [...] He recalled impulsively throwing his arms around Beery after one especially heartfelt scene, only to be gruffly pushed away.Child actress Margaret O'Brien claimed that she had to be protected by crew members from Beery's insistence on constantly pinching her.|$|R
5000|$|In July 1935, Nolan made news {{again when}} she {{filed a lawsuit}} against her former lover, M-G-M studio {{executive}} and producer Eddie Mannix. In her suit, Nolan claimed the two had lived together at the Ambassador Hotel from 1927 to 1931 (Mannix was married at the time), and that Mannix frequently beat her and used his considerable influence to ruin her career. Nolan further claimed that one such physical attack by Mannix required hospitalization where she underwent twenty surgeries. She asked for $500,000 in damages. Eddie Mannix and Howard <b>Strickling,</b> the head of publicity at M-G-M, publicly denied Nolan's claims stating that the suit was a publicity stunt to bolster Nolan's flagging career. Nolan's friends supported her claims however, stating that while the two were together, Nolan underwent three abortions, paid for by Mannix, and that she appeared on set with black eyes and bruises due to Mannix's physical abuse. According to Mannix's biographer E.J. Fleming, Mannix was incensed by the negative publicity the suit brought him and set out to discredit Nolan and further ruin her reputation. <b>Strickling</b> and M-G-M's publicity department leaked negative stories about Nolan's sexual activities and abortions to the press. Fleming said that Nolan later dropped the suit and left Los Angeles after Mannix sent a private detective to Nolan's home who told her that if she didn't drop the suit, she would be arrested for possessing morphine (the drug she was prescribed during her hospital stays to which she eventually became addicted).|$|R

[...] She goes on to say that [...] "it can be depressing for people to hear it's supposed to be that easy. It hasn't been my experience that people can simply choose not to be negatively influenced by their past."

When most people change, it usually happens in a much more gradual way." ...|$|R
50|$|From the design, {{provided}} by an designer, a skilled pattern maker builds {{a pattern of}} the object to be produced, using wood, metal, or a plastic such as expanded polystyrene. Sand can be ground, swept or <b>strickled</b> into shape. The metal to be cast will contract during solidification, {{and this may be}} non-uniform due to uneven cooling. Therefore, the pattern must be slightly larger than the finished product, a difference known as contraction allowance. Different scaled rules are used for different metals, because each metal and alloy contracts by an amount distinct from all others. Patterns also have core prints that create registers within the molds into which are placed sand cores. Such cores, sometimes reinforced by wires, are used to create under-cut profiles and cavities which cannot be molded with the cope and drag, such as the interior passages of valves or cooling passages in engine blocks.|$|R

5000|$|Voice-over {{narration}} {{is sometimes}} used to briefly {{set up the}} premise of the film and provide explanation when necessary, although this practice has declined in the years after the passing of voice-over artist Don LaFontaine. Since the trailer is a highly condensed format, voice-over is a useful tool to enhance the audience's understanding of the plot. Some of the best-known, modern-day trailer voice-over artists have been the aforementioned LaFontaine, Hal Douglas, Mark Elliot, John Leader, Corey Burton, George DelHoyo, Peter Cullen, Morgan Freeman, Ashton Smith, Jim Cummings, John Garry, Tom Kane, Ben Patrick Johnson, Tony Rodgers, Beau Weaver, and Brian Cummings. Classic voice-over artists in film trailers of the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s included Howard <b>Strickling</b> (for MGM), Lou Marcelle (for Warner Bros.), Art Gilmore, Knox Manning, Reed Hadley, Les Tremayne (for MGM), Fred Foy (for MGM), Karl Weber (for MGM), Dick Wesson (for Disney) and Bob Marcato. Hollywood trailers of the classic film era were renowned for clichés such as [...] "Colossal!", [...] "Stupendous!", etc. Some trailers have used voice over clichés for satirical effect.

40|$|This study {{examines}} how professional development conditions, events, and activities {{relate to the}} process of teachers becoming linguistically aware. Through an analysis of 18 transcribed individual and group interviews, I show how changes in beliefs about language, as well as the application of these changes to teachers' pedagogies take place among a sample of 14 teachers. I analyze these findings as an outcome of these teachers' professional development and in relation to models of effective professional development derived from the fields of Multicultural Education, Teachers of English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL), Intercultural Communication, and Sociolinguistics. I also propose a new model, the Process of Linguistic Awareness and Application Model (PLAA Model, <b>Strickling,</b> 2012), that more accurately evaluates how changes take place as the teachers in this study become more linguistically aware. Changes in beliefs about language involve a cycle of five phases: confronting new linguistic information, questioning linguistic information and previously held beliefs, integrating new linguistic information within contexts of social engagement, evaluating the relational, emotional, and cognitive aspects of the experience, and modifying beliefs about language within the specific context of the experience. The PLAA Model also shows how a nuanced secondary cycle can occur where the process of questioning, integrating, and evaluating inform each other in a repeating cycle of increasing linguistic awareness before the final phase of modifying beliefs takes place. The cycle results in experiential linguistic knowledge and becomes the paradigm for new questioning. Within the secondary cycle, the teachers in this study show that they either gain a more linguistically aware knowledge from their integrating experience or within some contexts, reinscribe an aspect of their previously held standard language beliefs and gain a linguistic awareness during the same experience. This contrary movement likely indicates a flux in beliefs about language...|$|R

Joan Crawford asked for him as her co-star in Dance, Fools, Dance (1931). He built his fame and public visibility in such movies as A Free Soul (1931), in which he played a gangster who shoved the character played by Norma Shearer; Gable never played a supporting role again. The Hollywood Reporter wrote [...] "A star in the making has been made, one that, to our reckoning, will outdraw every other star... Never have we seen audiences work themselves into such enthusiasm as when Clark Gable walks on the screen". He followed that with Susan Lenox (Her Fall and Rise) (1931) with Greta Garbo, and Possessed (1931), in which Crawford (then married to Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.) and he steamed up the screen. Adela Rogers St. Johns later dubbed Gable and Crawford's real-life relationship as [...] "the affair that nearly burned Hollywood down". Louis B. Mayer threatened to terminate both their contracts, {{and for a while}} they kept apart. Gable shifted his attentions to Marion Davies. However, Gable and Garbo disliked each other.
