50|$|Sanssouci is small, {{with the}} {{principal}} block (or corps de logis) being a narrow single-storey enfilade of just ten rooms, including a <b>service</b> <b>passage</b> and staff rooms behind them. Frederick's amateur sketch of 1745 (illustrated above) demonstrates that his architect, Knobelsdorff, was more a draughtsman at Sanssouci than complete architect. Frederick appears to have accepted no suggestions for alteration to his plans, refusing Knobelsdorff's idea that the palace should have a semi-basement storey, which would not only have provided service areas closer at hand, but would have put the principal rooms on a raised piano nobile. This {{would have given the}} palace not only a more commanding presence, but also would have prevented the problems of dampness to which it has always been prone. However, Frederick wanted an intimate palace for living: for example, rather than scaling a large number of steps, he wanted to enter the palace immediately from the garden. He insisted on a building on the ground level, of which the pedestal was the hill: in short, this was to be a private pleasure house. His recurring theme and requirement was for a house with close connections between its style and free nature. The principal rooms, lit by tall slender windows, face south over the vineyard gardens; the north façade is the entrance front, where a semicircular cour d'honneur was created by two segmented Corinthian colonnades.|$|R

In other words, the front bedroom can now only be accessed by passing through the second bedroom. The front bedroom has two step-out or telescopic windows opening onto the front verandah, and the second bedroom has a double sliding glass door of [...] vintage opening onto the southern verandah, in the place of a former window. The single window to the third bedroom has been replaced by small, high windows to the bathroom and toilet.

The wall between this room and the pavilion room (which currently functions as a combined dining and living room) has been almost totally removed, and it is no longer clear whether this room was accessed originally from a rear verandah, or from the cross or <b>service</b> <b>passages</b> in the middle of the house.|$|R

Second, the politics of the 1970 s Perth women's movement shared a heritage of peculiarly Australian tradition of social liberalism, where the state intervened to equalise the unequal social order. The "feminism" articulated within the state was influenced by social liberalism, but was also configured and reconfigured according to the specific Western Australian political context. Third, the material obtained in interviews with women politicians and senior bureaucrats constituted the most important source of the women's understandings of the politically volatile arenas of public life in which they worked. In particular, insights gathered in this material underscored and reinforced the complexities of feminist involvement with the state and the fragile, contraditory nature of feminist gains.
