5|$|In {{spring and}} early summer, migrant birds {{including}} the little gull, black tern, Temminck's stint and garganey may pass through {{on their way to}} breed elsewhere. In the autumn, birds arrive from the north; some, such as whimbrels, curlew sandpipers and little stints, just pausing for a few days to refuel before continuing south, others staying for the winter. Offshore, great and Arctic skuas, northern gannets and black-legged kittiwakes may pass close by in favourable winds. Large numbers of ducks winter along the coast, including many Eurasian wigeons, Eurasian teals, mallards and gadwalls, goldeneyes and northern pintails. Red-throated divers are usually on the sea, and brent geese feed on <b>sea</b> <b>lettuce</b> and other green algae. Barn owls and sometimes hen harriers quarter the marshes in winter, and snow bunting flocks {{can be found on the}} beaches. Thousands of geese, mainly pink-footed, roost at Holkham.|$|E

50|$|The region {{does not}} have a rich flora and almost all the plants {{can be found on the}} {{mainland}} of India. There is also an absence of forest in the region. Nearly 400 species of flowering plants have been documented, including three species of sea grasses Cymodocia isoetifolia, Syringodium isoetifolium and Thalassia hemprichii, other angiosperms as Pandanus, Heliotropium foertherianum, Tournefortia argentea and Pemphis acidula as well as fungi, algae, lichens are also found. The common flora of the coral sands include coconut groves and coastal shrubs as Pemphis acidula, Cordia subcordata, Scaevola taccada, Thespesia populnea, Suriana maritima, Dodonaea viscosa, Guettarda speciosa and seaweeds such as <b>sea</b> <b>lettuces,</b> Codium and Hypena.|$|R

Brent geese feed on <b>sea</b> <b>lettuce</b> and other green algae, and hundreds of European golden plovers may roost on the reserve at high tide. In the evenings, large flocks of pink-footed geese fly over Titchwell {{on their way to}} roost, and barn owls and hen harriers quarter the marshes. This is the season for flocks of lesser redpolls, sometimes accompanied by a rarer common redpoll, and snow buntings are to be found on the beach.|$|E

50|$|<b>Sea</b> <b>lettuce</b> {{species are}} {{commonly}} found in the saltwater aquarium trade, where the plants are valued for their high nutrient uptake and edibility. Many reef aquarium keepers use <b>sea</b> <b>lettuce</b> species in refugia or grow it as a food source for herbivorous fish. <b>Sea</b> <b>lettuce</b> {{is very easy to}} keep, tolerating a wide range of lighting and temperature conditions. In the refugium, <b>sea</b> <b>lettuce</b> can be attached to live rock or another surface, or simply left to drift in the water.|$|E

50|$|<b>Lettuce</b> <b>Sea</b> Slug, {{looks like}} a piece of lettuce. It has ruffles that help {{maximize}} the absorption of sunlight because it increases its surface area. Pyjama Sea Slug, their bright patterns are used to defend against predators by warning them. Usually, predators don’t go for this organism because of the chemicals that are secreted if attacked. Blue Sea Slug, this brave sea slug feeds on one of the ocean’s most feared organisms, the Portuguese Man-of-War. The Blue Sea Slug is immune to its stinging cells and stores all its toxins in its own feather-like “fingers” to use them as its own defense.|$|R
50|$|<b>Sea</b> <b>lettuce,</b> a macroalgae {{otherwise}} known as green nori, grows usually only in the summer. Seasonal upwelling along the Pacific North American coast has been correlated to increased <b>sea</b> <b>lettuce</b> productivity and decreased eelgrass productivity.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sea</b> <b>lettuce</b> is {{eaten by}} a number of {{different}} sea animals, including manatees and the sea slugs known as sea hares. Many species of <b>sea</b> <b>lettuce</b> are a food source for humans in Scandinavia, Great Britain, Ireland, China, and Japan (where this food is known as aosa). <b>Sea</b> <b>lettuce</b> as a food for humans is eaten raw in salads and cooked in soups. It is high in protein, soluble dietary fiber, and a variety of vitamins and minerals, especially iron. However contamination with toxic heavy metals at certain sites where it could be collected makes it dangerous for human consumption.|$|E
50|$|The type of seaweed {{that can}} be grown in a seaweed {{cultivator}} is currently limited to green types, mostly Angel Hair and <b>sea</b> <b>lettuce,</b> because other types such as Nori require more complex control of the water temperature and other variables. Angel Hair and <b>sea</b> <b>lettuce,</b> however, can be grown at home at room temperature.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluated}} {{the impact of}} the high salinity reject brine from reverse osmosis desalination on hydroponics lettuce cultivated in greenhouse an investigation was carried out in Mossoro, Northeast of Brazil (5 º 11 'S, 37 º 20 'O and 18 m above <b>sea).</b> Two <b>lettuce</b> cultivars ('Verônica' and 'Babá de verão') were cultivated with a basic nutrient solution with 1. 1 dS m- 1 (control) during the crop cycle (1 - 28 days after transplanting - DAT) - T 0 and with basic nutrient solution containing 50 % of the reject water from desalinization with 4. 8 dS m- 1 exposed during 1 - 7, 21 - 28, 7 - 14 e 1 - 28 DAT (T 1, T 2, T 3 and T 4, respectively). The addition of 50 % of brine reject from desalination into the hydroponic nutrient solution allows grow only 'Verônica' lettuce with no reduction in fresh biomass. This lettuce cultivar shows to be more tolerant to salinity for all exposure time with reject brine in the nutrition solution, despite the fact that 'Babá de Verão' cultivar is more productive...|$|R

50|$|Dudleya caespitosa is a {{succulent}} plant known by several common names, including <b>sea</b> <b>lettuce,</b> sand lettuce, and coast dudleya. It is endemic to California, where it grows along the coastline {{in the southern}} half of the state.|$|E
50|$|It {{used to be}} a {{strictly}} coastal bird in winter, seldom leaving tidal estuaries, where it feeds on eel-grass (Zostera marina) and the seaweed, <b>sea</b> <b>lettuce</b> (Ulva). On the east coast of North America, the inclusion of <b>sea</b> <b>lettuce</b> is a recent change to their diet, brought about by a blight on eelgrass in 1931. This resulted in the near-extirpation of the brant. The few that survived changed their diet to include <b>sea</b> <b>lettuce</b> until the eelgrass eventually began to return. Brants have maintained this diet ever since as a survival strategy. In recent decades, it has started using agricultural land a short distance inland, feeding extensively on grass and winter-sown cereals. This may be behavior learned by following other species of geese. Food resource pressure may also be important in forcing this change, as the world population has risen over 10-fold to 400,000-500,000 by the mid-1980s, possibly reaching the carrying capacity of the estuaries. In the breeding season, it uses low-lying wet coastal tundra for both breeding and feeding. The nest is bowl-shaped, lined with grass and down, in an elevated location, often in a small pond.|$|E
5000|$|The Ulvophyceae or ulvophytes are a {{class of}} green algae, {{distinguished}} mainly {{on the basis of}} ultrastructural morphology, life cycle and molecular phylogenetic data.

50|$|The Chlorophyta (a {{name that}} {{has also been}} used for all green algae) are the sister group to the group from which the land plants evolved.

50|$|In 2009 huge {{quantities}} of <b>sea</b> <b>lettuce</b> seaweed (Ulva lactuca) {{washed up on}} the beach at Saint Michel. Poisonous gases resulting from its decomposition caused the death of a horse and may have been a factor in the earlier death of a cleanup crew truck driver.|$|E
50|$|Like other chitons, it is a {{slow moving}} grazer that consumes several species of brown and red algae {{including}} kelps, <b>sea</b> <b>lettuce,</b> and encrusting diatoms. They're also known to eat sponges, tiny barnacles, spirobid polychaetes, and bryozoans. Their predators include sea urchins, leather stars, black oystercatchers, glaucous-winged gulls, and humans.|$|E
50|$|In 2009, {{large amounts}} of <b>sea</b> <b>lettuce,</b> a type of algae, washed up on many beaches of Brittany, and when it rotted it emitted {{dangerous}} levels of hydrogen sulphide.
