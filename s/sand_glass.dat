60|$|The {{question}} was put, the <b>sand</b> <b>glass</b> was turned upon the table, the division bells were set ringing. Even at this moment, the ministerial whips believed that some were still wavering. A reference made by Mr. Parnell to harmonious communications {{in the previous}} summer with a tory minister, (M125) inclined them {{to vote for the}} bill. On the other hand, the prospect of going to an election without a tory opponent was no weak temptation to a weak man. A common impression was that the bill would be beaten by ten or fifteen. Others were sure that it would be twice as much as either figure. Some on the treasury bench, perhaps including the prime minister himself, hoped against hope that the hostile majority might not be more than five or six. It proved to be thirty. The numbers were 343 against 313. Ninety-three liberals voted against the bill. These with the two tellers were between one-third and one-fourth of the full liberal strength from Great Britain. So ended the first engagement in this long campaign.

In this study, 25 % Ordinary Portland cement was replaced by Fly ash (FA) or Ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBFS), the crushed CRT funnel <b>glass</b> <b>sand</b> untreated with nitric acid (n-TFG) was used to replace river sand fine aggregate of 0 %, 25 %, 50 %, 75 % in the mortar. The fresh, mechanical properties of the mortar were studied, the alkali-silica reaction (ASR) expansion, drying shrinkage and leaching of lead from mortar were evaluated. The test results showed, the use of n-TFG <b>glass</b> <b>sand</b> improves fresh properties of the mortar. The mortar with n-TFG <b>glass</b> <b>sand</b> has higher mechanical properties than control mortar. At the drying shrinkage period of 56 days, drying shrinkage of nearly all the mortar with n-TFG <b>glass</b> <b>sand</b> are higher than the limit of 0. 075 %.

40|$|We present {{experimental}} {{findings on}} the flow rule for granular flows on a rough inclined plane using various materials including <b>sand</b> and <b>glass</b> beads of various sizes and four types of copper particles with different shapes. We characterize the materials by measuring h_s (the thickness at which the flow subsides) {{as a function of}} the plane inclination θ on various surfaces. Measuring the surface velocity u of the flow as a function of flow thickness h, we find that for <b>sand</b> and <b>glass</b> beads the Pouliquen flow rule u/√(gh) ∼β h/h_s provides reasonable but not perfect collapse of the u(h) curves measured for various θ and mean particle diameter d. Improved collapse is obtained for <b>sand</b> and <b>glass</b> beads by using a recently proposed scaling of the form u/√(gh) =β· h tan^ 2 θ /h_s tan^ 2 θ_ 1 where θ_ 1 is the angle at which the h_s(θ) curves diverge. Measuring the slope β for ten different sizes of <b>sand</b> and <b>glass</b> beads, we find a systematic, strong increase of β with the divergence angle θ_ 1 of h_s.

5000|$|In {{the course}} of the {{repopulation}} policy of the Great Elector Frederick William I of Brandenburg the depopulated town was settled with Reformed (Calvinist) refugees from the Electorate of the Palatinate and Reformed immigrants from Switzerland between 1685 and 1691. A Reformed congregation, besides the existing belittled Lutheran, was established and Lindow used to be headed by two burgomasters at a time, one of each denomination. The convent was reestablished as Hochadeliges Fräuleinstift (High and Noble Damsels' Foundation) in 1696. [...] In 1746 a city fire burnt most of Lindow to ashes. Today's Town Church (Stadtkirche) {{at the southern end of}} the old town, was reerected in baroque style as the Lutheran church between 1751 and 1755 by the architect Georg Christoph Berger. It shows an altarpiece «Noli me tangere» by Heinrich Stadler of 1771 depicting the resurrected Jesus of Nazareth appearing to Mary Magdalene. The matroneum opposite to the pulpit altar is still occasionally called the damsels' gallery (Fräuleinempore), where the conventuals used to sit during services. The typical Protestant pulpit altar has a <b>sand</b> <b>glass</b> fixed on its parapet, donated by the congregation to a pastor in the 18th century in view of lengthy preaches in order to restrain them. In 1752 the then Domina Ilse von Rochow erected on her expenses a new dominate building. Rochow reachieved some autonomy for the conventuals who were electing their chairing domina since, restricting the throne to a mere confirmation of the elect. The number of conventuals rose again.|$|E
