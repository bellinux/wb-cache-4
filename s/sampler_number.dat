40|$|Abstract—In {{order to}} {{implement}} a wireless sensor network in process automation system it is needed to specify the <b>sample</b> <b>number</b> for the sensors. Because of the hardware and power supply limitations, wireless sensors are applied to discrete event control system. In wireless sensor network the highest <b>sample</b> <b>number</b> is restricted {{in comparison to the}} wired one. Moreover, the lowest <b>sample</b> <b>number</b> is also constrained by the limitations imposed by the control limits values. In this paper, relations between <b>sample</b> <b>number</b> and actuator’s frequency drift in discrete domain is formulated and presented. The central and autonomous sensor network structures are introduced. In addition, ways to compromise the <b>sample</b> <b>number</b> with the actuator’s frequency and control limits value are acknowledged. An approach to find the optimal <b>sample</b> <b>number</b> is proposed. It is shown when the sensor network becomes larger, autonomous network can partly compensate energy consumption increase by adding the <b>sample</b> <b>number</b> whereas central network does not support this feature...|$|R

This paper presents a measurement-based method to determine the independent platform <b>sample</b> <b>number.</b> This method is simple and accurate.

40|$|Due to the {{complicated}} and time-varying boundary conditions, reverberation chamber (RC) measurements are usually studied using statistical analysis. Hence, {{it is of}} importance to know the <b>number</b> of independent <b>samples</b> of the measurements. Different methods for estimating the <b>number</b> of independent <b>samples</b> has been proposed in the literature. This paper uses the spatial degrees of freedom method to estimate the independent <b>sample</b> <b>number.</b> Comparing with the commonly used autocorrelation function method, the proposed method requires less computation time and provides a smaller estimation bias for correlated samples and a smaller estimation variance once above a certain <b>sample</b> <b>number.</b> The estimated independent <b>sample</b> <b>number</b> {{can be used to}} explain the dependences of the measurement uncertainty on frequency, mode stirrers, and RC loading. Finally, the estimated independent <b>sample</b> <b>number</b> is used to predict the standard deviation (STD) of the average power level for different loading configurations, where good agreements are observed...|$|R

40|$|This paper aims {{to develop}} a rapid and {{practical}} procedure that can locate the slip surface for a slope with the minimum reliability index for limit equilibrium analysis at the minimum expense of time. The comparative study on the reliability indices from different <b>sample</b> <b>numbers</b> using the Monte Carlo simulation method has demonstrated that the results from a large enough <b>sample</b> <b>number</b> are related to those from a small <b>sample</b> <b>number</b> with high correlation indices. This observation has been tested for many homogeneous and heterogeneous slopes under various conditions in parametric studies. Based on this observation, the reliability index for a potential slip surface can be calculated with a small <b>sample</b> <b>number,</b> {{and the search for}} the minimum reliability index and the slip surface can be determined by a heuristic optimization algorithm. Based on the comparisons between the critical deterministic and probabilistic slip surfaces for many different cases, the use of the proposed fast method in locating the critical probabilistic slip surface is found to perform well, which is suitable for normal routine analysis and design works.

40|$|Abstract Background The urinary {{proteome}} {{has been}} widely used for biomarker discovery. A urinary proteome database from normal humans can provide a background for discovery proteomics and candidate proteins/peptides for targeted proteomics. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} define the minimum number of individuals required for sampling to represent the normal urinary proteome. Methods In this study, inter-individual and inter-gender variations of urinary proteome were taken into consideration to achieve a representative database. An individual analysis was performed on overnight urine samples from 20 normal volunteers (10 males and 10 females) by 1 DLC/MS/MS. To obtain a representative result of each sample, a replicate 1 DLCMS/MS analysis was performed. The minimal <b>sample</b> <b>number</b> was estimated by statistical analysis. Results For qualitative analysis, less than 5 % of new proteins/peptides were identified in a male/female normal group by adding a new sample when the <b>sample</b> <b>number</b> exceeded nine. In addition, in a normal group, the percentage of newly identified proteins/peptides was less than 5 % upon adding a new sample when the <b>sample</b> <b>number</b> reached 10. Furthermore, a statistical analysis indicated that urinary proteomes from normal males and females showed different patterns. For quantitative analysis, the variation of protein abundance was defined by spectrum count and western blotting methods. And then the minimal <b>sample</b> <b>number</b> for quantitative proteomic analysis was identified. Conclusions For qualitative analysis, when considering the inter-individual and inter-gender variations, the minimum <b>sample</b> <b>number</b> is 10 and requires a balanced number of males and females in order to obtain a representative normal human urinary proteome. For quantitative analysis, the minimal <b>sample</b> <b>number</b> is much greater than that for qualitative analysis and depends on the experimental methods used for quantification. </p...|$|R

40|$|When {{multilevel}} {{models are}} estimated from survey data derived using multistage sampling, unequal selection probabilities at any {{stage of sampling}} may induce bias in standard estimators, unless {{the sources of the}} unequal probabilities are fully controlled for in the covariates. This paper proposes alternative ways of weighting the estimation of a two-level model by using the reciprocals of the selection probabilities at each stage of sampling. Consistent estimators are obtained when both the <b>sample</b> <b>number</b> of level 2 units and the <b>sample</b> <b>number</b> of level 1 units within sampled level 2 units increase. Scaling of the weights is proposed to improve the properties of the estimators and to simplify computation. Variance estimators are also proposed. In a limited simulation study the scaled weighted estimators are found to perform well, although non-negligible bias starts to arise for informative designs when the <b>sample</b> <b>number</b> of level 1 units becomes small. The variance estimators perform extremely well. The procedures are illustrated using data from the survey of psychiatric morbidity...|$|R
