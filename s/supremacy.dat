5|$|The Bourne Identity was {{followed}} by a 2004 sequel, The Bourne <b>Supremacy,</b> which received a similar positive critical and public reception, but received some criticism for its hand-held camerawork, which observers argued made action sequences difficult to see. The Bourne <b>Supremacy</b> was directed by Paul Greengrass with Matt Damon reprising his role as Jason Bourne. A third film, The Bourne Ultimatum, was released in 2007 and again was directed by Paul Greengrass and starred Matt Damon. Like <b>Supremacy,</b> Ultimatum received generally positive critical and public reception, but also received similar criticism for the camera-work. Liman remained as executive producer for both films {{as well as for the}} fifth film Jason Bourne, once again directed by Greengrass and released in 2016.|$|E
5|$|European navies {{remained}} {{dominant in}} the pre-dreadnought era. The British Royal Navy remained the world's largest fleet, though both Britain's traditional naval rivals and the new European powers increasingly asserted themselves against its <b>supremacy.</b>|$|E
5|$|Henry VIII {{broke from}} communion with the Catholic Church, over issues {{relating}} to his divorce, under the Acts of <b>Supremacy</b> in 1534 which proclaimed the monarch head of the Church of England. In contrast with much of European Protestantism, {{the roots of the}} split were more political than theological. He also legally incorporated his ancestral land Wales into the Kingdom of England with the 1535–1542 acts. There were internal religious conflicts during the reigns of Henry's daughters, Mary I and Elizabeth I. The former took the country back to Catholicism while the latter broke from it again, forcefully asserting the <b>supremacy</b> of Anglicanism.|$|E
5|$|In 1527 King Henry VIII asked Pope Clement VII to annul his {{marriage}} to Katherine of Aragon, but the pope refused. This started {{a series of events}} known as English Reformation in which Henry broke away from the authority of the pope. In lieu of the pope, Henry assumed authority over the church: all priests and religious figures, including monks, were required to swear support to the royal <b>supremacy</b> over the church. Abbot Bourchier and the 25 canons at Leicester Abbey acknowledged the king's royal <b>supremacy</b> on 11 August 1534, thereby saving the abbey from immediate dissolution.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the South American nations of Argentina and Chile engaged in an {{expensive}} naval arms race to ensure the other would not gain <b>supremacy</b> in the Southern Cone.|$|E
5|$|It also greatly {{extended}} {{the powers of}} Parliament. Under this new constitution, monarchical absolutism was replaced by parliamentary <b>supremacy.</b> It was quickly realised that Magna Carta stood in the same relation to the King-in-Parliament as it had to the King without Parliament. This <b>supremacy</b> would be challenged {{by the likes of}} Granville Sharp. Sharp regarded Magna Carta as a fundamental part of the constitution, and maintained that it would be treason to repeal any part of it. He also held that the Charter prohibited slavery.|$|E
5|$|Most {{perpetrators}} {{were white}} and the victims black. The political message—the promotion of white <b>supremacy</b> and black powerlessness—was {{an important element of}} the ritual, so that even the quieter lynchings might be photographed and the images published as postcards.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon's aims {{to conquer}} Vietnam {{as a base}} to {{challenge}} British <b>supremacy</b> in India never materialized, having been preoccupied by vast military ambitions on mainland Europe. However, France remained the only European power with permanent spokesmen in Vietnam during his reign.|$|E
5|$|Now the Visitation {{allowed for}} an {{inventory}} of what the monasteries possessed, and the visiting commissioners claimed to have uncovered sexual immorality and financial impropriety amongst the monks and nuns, which became the ostensible justification for their suppression. The Church owned between one-fifth and one-third {{of the land in}} all England; Cromwell realised that he could bind the gentry and nobility to Royal <b>Supremacy</b> by selling to them the huge amount of Church lands, and that any reversion to pre-Royal <b>Supremacy</b> would entail upsetting many of the powerful people in the realm. For these various reasons the Dissolution of the Monasteries began in 1536 with the Dissolution of the Lesser Monasteries Act, affecting smaller houses—those valued at less than £200 a year. Henry used the revenue to help build coastal defences (see Device Forts) against expected invasion, and all the land was given to the Crown or sold to the aristocracy. Whereas the royal <b>supremacy</b> had raised few eyebrows, the attack on abbeys and priories affected lay people. Mobs attacked those sent to break up monastic buildings. Suppression commissioners were attacked by local people in several places. In Northern England there were a series of uprisings by Roman Catholics against the dissolutions in late 1536 and early 1537.|$|E
5|$|On December 2009 the Renewable Fuels Association (RFA) and Growth Energy, two U.S. ethanol {{lobbying}} groups, filed {{a lawsuit}} challenging LCFS' constitutionality. The two organizations argued that LCFS violated both the <b>Supremacy</b> Clause and the Commerce Clause, jeopardizing the nationwide ethanol market.|$|E

5|$|World <b>Supremacy</b> Battlegrounds is {{a hip-hop}} dance {{competition}} based in Australia. The heritage of World <b>Supremacy</b> Battlegrounds {{goes back to}} 2002 when it began as GROOVE, a local hip-hop competition held in Sydney. Over the three years that followed, the competition was renamed Battlegrounds and went national to include dance crews from all over Australia. It became international in 2006 when crews from the Philippines, Japan, and New Zealand entered the competition. There are four dance crew categories: open (all ages), junior (12 and under), varsity (12–18), and monster (all ages, 20–40 members). For the 2011 competition, teams from Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines, Japan, Guam, New Zealand, Samoa, and South Africa came to compete.|$|E
5|$|After {{his escape}} from Pekalongan, Soeprapto {{and his family}} first went to Cirebon. They then went to Yogyakarta, where Soeprapto became a judge at the high court. He later began work as a prosecutor, rising quickly through the ranks; several of his {{coworkers}} attributed it to the Kutil case, where Soeprapto demonstrated that he believed in the <b>supremacy</b> of law.|$|E
5|$|By 1943, the Allies enjoyed air <b>supremacy</b> in North Africa. The Ju 87s {{ventured out}} in Rotte {{strength}} only, often jettisoning their bombs {{at the first}} sight of enemy aircraft. Adding to this trouble, the German fighters had only enough fuel to cover the Ju 87s on take off, their most vulnerable point. After that, the Stukas were on their own.|$|E
5|$|By March 1945 the Luftwaffe {{had lost}} air superiority over all fronts. Western Allied Air Forces held air <b>supremacy</b> over the German Reich and {{remaining}} German-occupied territory. German industrial cities were now subjected to intensive bombardment which inflicted enormous {{damage on the}} German war effort. The United States Army Air Forces attacked by day, while RAF Bomber Command operated by night.|$|E
5|$|Cranmer was not {{immediately}} accepted by the bishops within his province. When he attempted a canonical visitation, he had to avoid locations where a resident conservative bishop might make an embarrassing personal challenge to his authority. In 1535, Cranmer had difficult encounters with several bishops, John Stokesley, John Longland, and Stephen Gardiner among others. They objected to Cranmer's power and title and argued that the Act of <b>Supremacy</b> did not define his role. This prompted Thomas Cromwell, the king's chief minister, to activate and to take {{the office of the}} vicegerent, the deputy supreme head of ecclesiastical affairs. He created another set of institutions that gave a clear structure to the royal <b>supremacy.</b> Hence, the archbishop was eclipsed by Vicegerent Cromwell in regards to the king's spiritual jurisdiction. There is no evidence that Cranmer resented his position as junior partner. Although he was an exceptional scholar, he lacked the political ability to outface even clerical opponents. Those tasks were left to Cromwell.|$|E
5|$|Cromwell was {{a lawyer}} {{and a member of}} Parliament—a Protestant who saw how Parliament could be used to advance the Royal <b>Supremacy,</b> which Henry wanted, and to further Protestant beliefs and {{practices}} Cromwell and his friends wanted. One of his closest friends was Thomas Cranmer, soon to be Archbishop.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{military}} <b>supremacy</b> over land, Simeon I {{was aware that}} he needed naval assistance in order to seize Constantinople. In 922 he clandestinely sent envoys to the Fatimid caliph Ubayd Allah al-Mahdi Billah in Mahdia to negotiate {{the assistance of the}} powerful Arab navy. Simeon I proposed to divide equally all spoils; the Bulgarians were to keep Constantinople and the Fatimids would gain the Byzantine territories in Sicily and South Italy.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} 12th century, {{and after the}} decay of the native Croatian royal family of Trpimirović, the castle of Klis was mainly governed by Croatian nobility, under the <b>supremacy</b> of Hungarian kings. The Kingdom of Croatia and the Kingdom of Hungary were, from 1102, in a {{personal}} union of two kingdoms, united under the Hungarian king.|$|E
5|$|He {{rejected}} German racial <b>supremacy</b> {{and instead}} saw the Norwegian race as the progenitor of northern Europe, tracing {{his own family}} tree in his spare time. Party members did not receive preferential treatment, though Quisling did not himself share in the wartime hardships of his fellow Norwegians. Nevertheless, many gifts went unused {{and he did not}} live extravagantly.|$|E
5|$|In 1205, the Republic of Venice invaded Dalmatia {{with the}} forces of the Fourth Crusade. Ragusa was forced to pay a tribute, {{eventually}} becoming a source of supplies for Venice, thus saving itself from being sacked like Zadar in the Siege of Zara, used as Venice's naval base in the southern Adriatic Sea. In the 14th century, after liberation from Venetian <b>supremacy,</b> extensive work was done on the walls to ensure the republic's liberty.|$|E
5|$|In 1532, Thomas Cromwell {{brought before}} Parliament {{a number of}} acts {{including}} the Supplication against the Ordinaries and Submission of the Clergy, which recognised royal <b>supremacy</b> over the church, thus finalising the break with Rome. Following these acts, Thomas More resigned as Chancellor, leaving Cromwell as Henry's chief minister.|$|E
5|$|In 1536 Henry VIII, {{through a}} series of {{administrative}} and legal processes disbanded monasteries, priories, convents and friaries in England. He appropriated their income, disposed of their assets, and provided for their former members and functions. He was given the authority to do this in England and Wales by the Act of <b>Supremacy,</b> passed by Parliament in 1534, which made him Supreme Head of the Church in England, thus separating England from Papal authority, and by the First Suppression Act (1536) and the Second Suppression Act (1539). Roger Tormenton had been elected prior of Woodspring in 1525 and in 1534 he acknowledged the king's <b>supremacy,</b> having already sold a third of the prior's property to Thomas Horner of Mells Manor, but on 27 September 1536 the community was disbanded with revenues of £87 2s 11d. Some of the priory's treasures were distributed to nearby churches. In addition to the reliquary going to St Paul's in Kewstoke, the carved misericords went to St Martin's in Worle and the sculpted pulpit to the Church of St Lawrence in Wick St. Lawrence.|$|E
5|$|In 1568 Sigismund Augustus, who {{had already}} {{embarked}} on a war fleet enlargement program, established the Maritime Commission. A conflict with the City of Gdańsk (Danzig), which felt that its monopolistic trade position was threatened, ensued. In 1569 Royal Prussia had its legal autonomy largely taken away, and in 1570 Poland's <b>supremacy</b> over Danzig and the Polish King's authority over the Baltic shipping trade were regulated and received statutory recognition (Karnkowski's Statutes).|$|E
5|$|In 1586 Robert {{was educated}} at Gloucester Hall in Oxford, a college {{noted for its}} Catholic intake. Those either {{studying}} at university or wishing to take public office could not do so without first swearing the Oath of <b>Supremacy,</b> an act which would have compromised Catesby's Catholic faith. Presumably to avoid this consequence, he left without taking his degree, and may then have attended the seminary college of Douai.|$|E
5|$|In case any of {{this should}} be resisted, Parliament passed the Treasons Act 1534, which made it high treason {{punishable}} by death to deny Royal <b>Supremacy.</b> The following year, Thomas More and John Fisher were executed under this legislation. Finally, in 1536, Parliament passed the Act against the Pope's Authority, which removed {{the last part of}} papal authority still legal. This was Rome's power in England to decide disputes concerning Scripture.|$|E
5|$|In later years, {{alliance}} between the Northern Uí Néill and the Vikings of Dublin became a regular occurrence: the Northern and Southern Uí Néill were frequent competitors for <b>supremacy</b> in Ireland, and the uneasy neighbourhood between Dublin and the Southern Uí Néill made the Vikings natural allies for the Northerners.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{highlighted}} that this elevation of principles of natural justice to constitutional status, with {{the implication that}} they may override local statutes due to the <b>supremacy</b> of the Constitution over them, creates some tension with Article 38 which vests the law-making power of Singapore in the legislature.|$|E
5|$|Luftflotte 2 {{operated}} {{in support of}} Army Group Centre, commanded by Fedor von Bock, continuing the close working relationship between the two. Kesselring's mission was to gain air superiority, and if possible air <b>supremacy,</b> {{as soon as possible}} while still supporting ground operations. For this he had a fleet of over 1,000 aircraft, {{about a third of the}} Luftwaffes total strength.|$|E
5|$|Many Lollards {{were still}} about, {{especially}} in London and the Thames Valley, in Essex and Kent, Coventry, Bristol {{and even in}} the North, who would be receptive to the new ideas when they came, who looked for a reform in the lifestyle of the clergy. They emphasised the preaching of the word over the sacrament of the altar, holding the latter to be but a memorial, but they were not party to the actions of the government. Other ideas, critical of the papal <b>supremacy</b> were held, not only by Lollards, but by those who wished to assert the <b>supremacy</b> of the secular state over the church but also by conciliarists such as Thomas More and, initially, Cranmer. Other Roman Catholic reformists, including John Colet, Dean of St Paul's, warned that heretics were not nearly so great a danger to the faith as the wicked and indolent lives of the clergy.|$|E
5|$|Nor is {{this theme}} of {{cutthroat}} competition limited to prestidigitation: the script incorporates the popular notion that Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison were directly {{engaged in the}} War of Currents, a rivalry over electrical standards, which appears in the film in parallel to Angier and Borden's competition for magical <b>supremacy.</b> In the book, Tesla and Edison serve as foils for Angier and Borden, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The Constitution of the Commonwealth of Virginia is the {{document}} that defines and limits {{the powers of}} the state government and the basic rights of the citizens of the U.S. Commonwealth of Virginia. Like all other state constitutions, it is supreme over Virginia's laws and acts of government, though it may be superseded by the United States Constitution and U.S. federal law as per the <b>Supremacy</b> Clause.|$|E
