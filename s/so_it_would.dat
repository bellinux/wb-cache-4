5|$|A further fire {{broke out}} during the early morning of 14 December. Firefighters were of the view that {{extinguishing}} it would leave the risk of petroleum vapour re-igniting or exploding, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be better to allow the fire, which was well contained, to burn itself out. Hertfordshire Fire Service's deputy chief Mark Yates stated that escaping petroleum vapour was the most likely cause of the original explosion and fire.|$|E
5|$|A view {{of part of}} Albany, New York, {{as it was in}} 1814 shows {{a mixture}} of Dutch, English and Federal styles, {{although}} Dutch brick was reportedly used for one of the English-style houses. One house in the Dutch style was said to date from the American Revolution. If <b>so,</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> {{have been one of the}} last genuine Dutch-style houses to be built in the United States, reflecting the conservative Dutch culture of Albany at that time.|$|E
5|$|As the plenary {{legislative}} {{powers of}} the Parliament were sufficient to grant extraterritorial legislative powers to the Parliament, the Court declined to pronounce whether Article 73(a) was an empowering provision. However, it indicated on an obiter basis that had it been necessary to do <b>so,</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have accepted the Attorney-General's alternate submission that Article 73(a) of the Malaysian Constitution was never intended to be an empowering provision.|$|E

5|$|Game {{designer}} Roberta Williams, {{co-founder of}} Sierra On-Line, deliberately made the Phantasmagoria gameplay and interface simple, unobtrusive, and intuitive <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be more accessible and less frustrating for casual gamers. According to Arinn Dembo from Computer Gaming World, {{the game is}} focused more around the story and the frightening atmosphere, rather than on a difficult gaming experience, and therefore the puzzles are relatively easy, logical, and straightforward.|$|E
5|$|Israel {{continued}} {{to control the}} city until early June 1974, when it was returned to Syrian civilian control following the signature of a United States-brokered disengagement agreement signed on 31 May 1974. The surrender of Quneitra was controversial, with Israeli settlers and the Likud and National Religious Party opposing it. According to Michael Mandelbaum, the agreement provided {{that the city was}} to be repopulated to serve as evidence of peaceful Syrian intentions, by doing <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> encourage the Israelis to pull back further.|$|E
5|$|It is {{constructed}} primarily {{of steel and}} glass. The main building {{is based on the}} diagonal truss. Originally, the museum was planned parallel to the river, but was quickly changed <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> lie perpendicular to the river, for the purpose of providing a better view to visitors. The western façade of the museum is a screen wall composed of laminated glass tiles, providing a sunscreen for the building. The underside {{is constructed}} of aluminum. Some critics dislike the bridge design, saying it looks too much like a trailer on stilts.|$|E

5|$|Minor {{changes were}} made to the track on 22 February 2010 after {{bobsleigh}} four-man teams from Latvia and Croatia rolled over in supplementary practice. Following a meeting with 11 team captains, practice runs were postponed by the FIBT until later that day to adjust the shape of turn 11 <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be easier for sleds to get {{through the rest of the}} track without crashing. FIBT spokesman Don Krone also stated that it was common that turn profiles were changed when it was being used by other sliding disciplines such as luge and skeleton.|$|E
5|$|The Moving Picture Company {{created the}} climactic hotel sequence. The fire effects were {{supervised}} by Chris Corbould, and post-production MPC had {{to enhance the}} sequence by making the smoke look closer to the actors, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> look more dangerous. A full-scale replica of the building's exterior {{was used for the}} exploding part Bond and Camille escape from.|$|E
5|$|The dinner {{scene was}} shot in a revamped version of the Enterprise-D's {{observation}} lounge. Along the wall are portraits of historical figures including Abraham Lincoln, Spock's father Sarek (Mark Lenard), and an unnamed Andorian ambassador. The food prepared for the scene was colored blue <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> look alien. None of the actors wanted to eat the unappetizing dishes (especially after they grew ripe under hot studio lights), {{and it became a}} running joke among the crew during filming to make them sample their food.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Chris Menaul and written by series creator Paul Attanasio. Wilford Brimley made a guest appearance as Harry Prentice, an ill and bed-ridden man who convinces his son to help him kill himself. Attanasio deliberately wrote the script <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be morally questionable whether police handling of both the suicide and the police shooting were done in an ethically correct way. Pembleton's investigation {{was based on a}} real-life investigation into a suspicious shooting featured in David Simon's non-fiction book , on which the Homicide series was based.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{designed}} {{to have a sense}} of unpredictability so it can be played without confining the player to rules. To achieve this, the company added the breaching system, which adds more varieties of combat and gives players more choices when dealing with the artificial intelligence. The breaching system, which originated as a mini-game, {{was designed to}} be simple <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> not interrupt the flow of gameplay. Instead of being purely a first-person shooter, the game features action-adventure elements that allow players to choose their progression and tasks them with solving environmental puzzles.|$|E
5|$|The {{shipping}} line operations of Cunard didn't escape review by Smallpeice. He was already {{familiar with the}} containerisation of freight prior to taking up his position with Cunard, but spent time during 1966 to visit the Sea-Land Service container terminal at Port Newark and further familiarised himself {{with the use of}} containers in marine traffic. Container ships were considered too large for the traditional British {{shipping line}}s, including Cunard and their subsidiaries to operate, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be necessary to form partnerships.|$|E

5|$|As, {{according}} to Bulgarian mythology {{and some other}} traditions, tortoises were the only beings who knew {{the appearance of the}} herb and the location where it grows, such people would try to obtain the raskovnik by deceiving a tortoise. They would find a tortoise nesting site and hem it in with a fence while the tortoise is away. When it returns, the tortoise would be unable to access its eggs, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> return with a raskovnik in order to breach the fence. Thus, the tortoise would reveal the herb and people would acquire it from the tortoise, which does not need it anymore.|$|E
5|$|Carmella's {{relationship}} with Connor was originally scripted for Nina Tucker, but {{was transferred to}} Carmella by the producers on Goodrem's departure. Upon Carmella's introduction, her only family member was her mobster father Rocco, who {{had been sent to}} prison. In 2006, Carmella was given a sister, when Natalie Saleeba was cast in the role of Rosetta Cammeniti. Blair opined that Rosie's inclusion brought out different sides to Carmella's character. Many viewers told Blair they felt the casting was good because they look alike. One of the significant changes to Carmella was that she started having fun again—Blair felt this meant they worked well together. Later, Erin McNaught was cast as her cousin Sienna Cammeniti. McNaught commented {{that there had been a}} rivalry between the cousins in their youth, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be interesting to see what unfolded between them.|$|E
5|$|Freidig was {{established}} in 1918 as a local team for Briskebyen {{in what was then}} the municipality of Vang. At the time there was a severe lack of pitches in Hamar, so the club was forced to sneak into unused venues and play until they were chased by the groundskeeper. The club was accepted {{as a member of the}} Football Association of Norway (NFF) in 1927, changing its name to Briskebyen FL. This forced it to formalize its pitch renting <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have a single home venue for each season. In 1928 and 1929, it played at Vangsbanen, from 1930 through 1933 at Ottestad bane, and from 1934 at Hamar stadion.|$|E

5|$|General Motors' then-Vice-Chairman Robert Lutz {{said the}} {{two-seater}} sports car {{being developed by}} Tesla, the Tesla Roadster, and the rapid advancement of lithium-ion battery technology inspired him to push the carmaker to develop the Volt after the 2006 Detroit Auto Show, overcoming internal opposition. Lutz's initial idea was to develop an all-electric car, but Jon Lauckner, General Motors Vice President for Global Vehicle Development, convinced him that to avoid an expensive battery, range anxiety concerns, and lack of public charging infrastructure, they could use a smaller battery pack with a small gasoline engine driving a generator acting as a backup to extend the range, but without a mechanical connection between the gasoline engine and the drive wheels, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be a pure electrically driven vehicle without many of the limitations General Motors learned from the EV1 experience.|$|E
5|$|In {{areas of}} Pakistan where its range {{overlaps}} {{with that of}} the dusky crag martin, the pale crag martin breeds at a higher altitude. Its range does not overlap there with the Eurasian crag martin, which is found high in the Himalayas, but where both occur in Iran, the pale crag martin favours more arid habitats. In North Africa, the Eurasian species is again found at a higher level. The separation by altitude and aridity means that it is not known whether the closely related Ptyonoprogne martins could hybridise. If they were shown to do <b>so,</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> cast doubts on their specific distinctness.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Hurricane Iris was {{forecast}} {{to remain}} a tropical cyclone while crossing Central America and to re-intensify in the eastern Pacific Ocean; had it done <b>so,</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have retained the name Iris. Instead, the hurricane rapidly weakened after moving into the mountainous terrain of Guatemala, and within six hours of landfall the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm. Late on October9, within sixteen hours of landfall, the circulation dissipated over extreme southeastern Mexico. As the remnants approached the Pacific Ocean, a new area of convection developed south of the original circulation of Iris. It gradually organized while continuing westward, developing into Tropical Storm Manuel; the new storm ultimately lasted until October18 before succumbing to cooler waters and wind shear.|$|E
