500|$|Holley auditioned {{to become}} a {{featured}} vocalist on the American reality television show Dancing with the Stars. The audition consisted of him performing seven different sounds, ranging from Frank Sinatra to Sly Stone. He was successful and became a featured singer {{during the first three}} seasons of the series. Holley later noted that the concept of diversity in vocal performance was not a new experience for him. [...] "I've been at sessions where a producer has <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> me to sound like Michael Jackson and Bruce Springsteen at the same time. I've had people say can you make it a little more green. Huh? It's tricky." [...] He added, [...] "Sometimes they think they want Sheryl Crow, because she has a hit single. But what they really want is magic, and that is whatever you, as an individual, can bring. It's a tough call between being a blank slate and being yourself." ...|$|E
500|$|Swanigan {{had several}} teams recruit him and offer scholarships; Arizona, Kentucky, Cal, and Duke {{were among the}} schools that gave Swanigan an offer. Caleb Swanigan {{verbally}} committed to Michigan State on April 10, 2015, but decommitted on May 7. He said, [...] "I just {{felt like it was}} better basketball-wise for me." [...] Similar to his high school decision, Barnes said, [...] "He wants to win a national championship and <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> {{to do it in the}} state of Indiana and wanted to do it at a place he's never done it before." [...] Some people believe Barnes had ulterior motives in adopting Swanigan, to which Barnes said, [...] "Maybe if I wanted to develop the next hot-dog-eating champion, the next Joey Chestnut, people would have a legitimate gripe." [...] Swanigan had not consulted Barnes before he committed to Michigan State, and some believe that since Barnes played sports at Purdue he was a major influence in Swanigan decommitting from Michigan State. Barnes said that was not the reason Swanigan switched, and the primary reason for Swanigan choosing Purdue was the presence of two centers that were taller than 7', Isaac Haas and A.J. Hammons, which allowed Swanigan to play the 4 spot.|$|E

500|$|Dwight and Andy {{sing and}} perform the John Denver song [...] "Take Me Home, Country Roads" [...] {{while trying to}} impress the new receptionist. At one point, Toby is overheard through a vent {{discussing}} and praising the FX show Damages while {{on the phone in}} a bathroom. He said it is as good as anything on HBO, a premium television channel known for such shows as The Sopranos, Six Feet Under and The Wire. During the workday, Ryan watches a YouTube video of a rap music commercial for Flea Market Montgomery; the low-budget rap music advertisement for the Montgomery, Alabama flea market gained Internet fame. Michael uses Evite, social-planning website for creating online invitations, to invite people to his pancake luncheon. On a whiteboard, Michael writes a quote of himself quoting Wayne Gretzky, the popular ice hockey player who said [...] "You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take" [...] The new paper company office included Apple computers and a Nerf basketball hoop. During a phone conversation, Ryan <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> an iPod music player that also serves as a phone, but not an iPhone, which is essentially that very product; both items are Apple products. Michael listens to [...] "Just Dance", a Lady Gaga song, while driving his convertible to work, which he mistakes for a Britney Spears song. Near the end of the episode, when Andy states that every song sounds better a cappella, Dwight asks about the songs [...] "Cherry Pie" [...] by Warrant, [...] "Enter Sandman" [...] by Metallica and [...] "Rebel Yell" [...] by Billy Idol.|$|E

[...] Tanabe received a giant tea cup engraved with his name and date of birth plus birthday gifts, flowers and 100,000 yen cash from Miyakonojo Mayor Makoto Nagamine. A Miyakonojo official said: [...] "His favorite food is fried shrimp, but we've heard that he's cut back on oily food.

2500|$|Meanwhile, Sulaiman Al Fahim was swiftly {{relieved}} {{of his role}} as publicity figure after the takeover, one such example of his conduct being his discussion of a £134 million bid for Manchester United's Cristiano Ronaldo: [...] "Ronaldo has <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> {{to play for the}} biggest club in the world, so we will see in January [...] if he is serious." [...] Despite making a series of other comments, this naïve statement was believed to have particularly irked Sheikh Mansour, who quickly appointed his trusted business friend Khaldoon Al Mubarak as chairman designate during the due diligence period, with Al Fahim {{relieved of}} his publicity duty.|$|E

2500|$|Dembski {{objects to}} the {{presence}} of the theory of evolution in a variety of disciplines, presenting intelligent design as an alternative to reductionist materialism that gives a sense of purpose that the unguided evolutionary process lacks and the ultimate significance of ID is its success in undermining materialism and naturalism. Dembski has also stated that ID has little chance as a serious scientific theory as long as methodological naturalism is the basis for science. Although intelligent design proponents (including Dembski) have made little apparent effort to publish peer-reviewed scientific research to support their hypotheses, in recent years they have made vigorous efforts to promote the teaching of intelligent design in schools. Dembski is a strong supporter of this drive as a means of making young people more receptive to intelligent design, and <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> [...] "to see intelligent design flourish as a scientific research program" [...] among a [...] "new generation of scholars" [...] willing to consider the theory and textbooks that include it.|$|E
2500|$|On 9 August 2008, then health minister, Anbumani Ramadoss {{began his}} {{campaign}} for changing Section 377 of the Indian penal code, which makes homosexuality an unnatural act and thus illegal. At the International AIDS Conference in Mexico City, he said, [...] "Section 377 of IPC, which criminalises {{men who have sex}} with men, must go." [...] His ministerial portfolio had put him at odds with the Indian Home Minister Shivraj Patil and several other ministers in seeking to scrap Section 377. In late 2008, he changed his argument saying he does not want the scrapping of Section 377 but a mere modification of the law treating homosexuality as a criminal offence punishable up to life imprisonment. He <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to resolve the matter, while he wanted to avoid discord with the home ministry, who said the altered law would then result in an increase in criminal incidences of sodomy or offences involving sexual abuse of children, particularly boys. In doing so he alleged that the law even penalises health workers who treat homosexuals, while making this a cognizable and non-bailable offence.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2008, Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez sued Casey Anthony for defamation. During the investigation, Anthony told {{investigators}} that she left 2½-year-old Caylee with a babysitter named Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez—also known as [...] "Zanny"—on June 16 at the stairs of a specific apartment in the Sawgrass apartment complex located in Orlando. Fernandez-Gonzalez, who was listed on apartment records as having visited apartments on that date, was questioned by police, but stated {{she did not know}} Casey or Caylee Anthony. Her defamation suit seeks compensatory and punitive damages, alleging that Casey willfully damaged her reputation. Fernandez-Gonzalez has told reporters that she lost her job, was evicted from her house, and received death threats against herself and her children as a result of Anthony's lies. Fernandez-Gonzalez' lawyer, John Morgan, <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> to interrogate Anthony about Caylee's death because it is [...] "the essence" [...] of the defamation suit. On October 8, 2011, Morgan deposed Anthony via a video conference. As expected, Anthony exercised her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and answered only a couple of factual questions. Morgan felt that was improper, but legal experts think that Anthony is well within her rights to plead the Fifth until her appeals of the convictions for lying to officers are exhausted. Fernandez-Gonzalez' attorneys sought and received permission to obtain Anthony's address (though it was kept sealed from the public) so they could subpoena her to testify, even if she only took the stand long enough to plead the Fifth. However, Fernandez-Gonzalez is willing to drop the suit if Anthony apologizes to her and compensates her for pain and suffering. In September 2015, a judge ruled in favor of Anthony, stating: [...] "There is nothing in the statement…to support (Fernandez-Gonzalez's) allegations that (Anthony) intended to portray (the nanny) as a child kidnapper and potentially a child killer." ...|$|E
