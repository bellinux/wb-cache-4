40|$|Humans make {{decisions}} {{on the basis of}} their situation awareness and it is well-known that insufficient situation awareness leads to incorrect decisions. The challenge of an advanced surveillance system for supporting situation awareness of a human decision maker is therefore to detect and assess complex situations that evolve over time. In this article, we present a conceptual framework for automatic situation assessment that consists of four parts, namely <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> characterization, <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> abstraction, <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> recognition and <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> projection. <b>The</b> <b>situation</b> itself can be described at several different levels of abstraction. The proposed framework can be used as a guideline when designing automatic situation assessment processes...|$|R

50|$|The {{structure}} of any situation is built upon four components, Behavior functions, Sensors, States, and Event Rules. Behavior functions represent what the characters behaviors {{are specific to}} <b>the</b> <b>situation.</b> Sensors are <b>the</b> sensing capability for agents to see and respond to events. States are the different motions and state transitions used only for the local behaviors. Event rule {{is the way to}} connect different events to their specific behaviors. While a character is being put into a situation, these four components are considered at the same time. For spatial <b>situations,</b> <b>the</b> components are added when the individual initially enters the environment that influences the character. For non-spatial <b>situations,</b> <b>the</b> character is affected only once the user assigns <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> to <b>the</b> character. The four components are removed when the agent is taken away from its <b>situations</b> region or <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> itself is removed. The dynamic adding and removing of <b>the</b> <b>situations</b> lets us achieve scalable agents.|$|R

5|$|After Calabi–Yau {{manifolds}} {{had entered}} physics {{as a way}} to compactify extra dimensions, many physicists began studying these manifolds. In the late 1980s, Lance Dixon, Wolfgang Lerche, Cumrun Vafa, and Nick Warner noticed that given such a compactification of string theory, {{it is not possible to}} reconstruct uniquely a corresponding Calabi–Yau manifold. Instead, two different versions of string theory called type IIA string theory and type IIB can be compactified on completely different Calabi–Yau manifolds giving rise to the same physics. In this <b>situation,</b> <b>the</b> manifolds are called mirror manifolds, and the relationship between the two physical theories is called mirror symmetry.|$|E
