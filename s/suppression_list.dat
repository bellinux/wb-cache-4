5000|$|Hanley and Shah [...] {{looked at}} the role of {{irrelevant}} sound effect under articulatory suppression. During this experiment, participants wore stereo headphones when being tested. During the testing, participants heard an experimental list of items through the right headphone spoken by a female voice. Participants were instructed to repeat the word “the” {{at a rate of}} approximately two repetitions per second. There was a retention interval of 10 seconds between the final item and the recall of target items. Irrelevant sound took place when a male voice was spoken in the left headphone throughout the retention interval, right before the recall of items. The results from this study showed that there was a significant effect of irrelevant sound under articulatory <b>suppression</b> when the <b>list</b> items were followed by an auditory tone, but the effect was abolished when followed by a spoken suffix.|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between the suffix effect {{and the effect of}} irrelevant sound on serial recall of auditorily presented lists is investigated in this study. Contrary to the predictions of the phonological loop model, Hanley and Hayes (2012) reported that the irrelevant sound effect was abolished under articulatory suppression when a spoken suffix was added {{at the end of the}} list. The experiment reported in this paper uses a shorter list length (five items per list) than that employed by Hanley and Hayes. This is because it cannot realistically be argued that participants will abandon the use of phonological codes to retain the list items with sequences as short as this. Results replicated those of Hanley and Hayes (2012). There was a significant effect of irrelevant sound under articulatory <b>suppression</b> when the <b>list</b> items were followed by an auditory tone. Crucially, however, the effect of irrelevant sound under articulatory suppression was abolished when the list items were followed by a spoken suffix. © 2012 Copyright Psychology Press Ltd...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} and give results for a multi-monitor emittance measurement performed using the IR Demo driver. Overview The backleg {{region of the}} IR Demo driver accelerator nominally comprises six periods of 90 o FODO beam transport line. The excitations of the 13 quadrupoles therein are modulated (by order 5 %) from integer tune values to maintain a transverse beam envelope match from endloop to endloop while maintaining a (modulo) integer phase advance, which provides useful aberration <b>suppression.</b> A <b>list</b> of quadrupole names and nominal excitations for 48 MeV (3 µm) operation is provided in Table 1. This region is instrumented with six optical transition radiation (OTR) monitors. These are adjacent to quadrupoles QG 4 F 05 through QG 4 F 10 and can in principle be used with the nominally excited quadrupoles to perform an emittance measurement of the type regularly used in the CEBAF injector [1]. The measurement presently under consideration was however performed as {{a portion of a}} broader investigation, the purpose of which is to develop “single-quad/monitor ” measurements [2] for use in Demo CSR investigations [3]. Quadrupoles QG 4 F 05 through QG 4 F 13 were therefore unexcited; QG 4 F 01 through QG 4 F 04 were adjusted in an effort to produce simultaneous minima in horizontal and vertical spot sizes in the vicinity of viewer ITV 4 F 07 or ITV 4 F 08 as QG 4 F 05 was varied. This goal has not yet been successfully attained, but the quadrupole excitations developed in the process did produce well-modulated beam sizes on all six OTRs, providing the potential for a readily deconvoluted emittance measurement...|$|R

A <b>list</b> of potentially relevant items was administered to 458 transplant recipients. The symptoms present in 120 % of patients were chosen, and factor analysis was used to create the final questionnaire which consists of 43 items in six dimensions: (1) limited physical capacity (10 items; internal consistency: Cronbach’s · = 0. 85); (2) limited cognitive capacity (8 items, · = 0. 82); (3) cardiac and renal dysfunction (7 items, · = 0. 76); (4) side effects of corticosteroids (5 items, · = 0. 77); (5) increased growth of gum and hair (5 items, · = 0. 78), and (6) transplantation-associated psychological distress (8 items, · = 0. 80). All questions are scored on a five-point Likert scale. Validity was demonstrated in correlation with corresponding SF- 36 scales and in a stepwise hierarchical regression mod-el predicting the subscales of the ESRD-SCL by sociode-mographic and medical data. The ESRD-SCL was found to have adequate reliability, test-retest correlations in a subsample of 88 stable patients after 1 year, and con-struct validity...|$|R
40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} the treatment results and adverse drug effects for 14 dogs receiving a new paclitaxel preparat named Paccal vet. The evaluated dogs are chosen to enter a pharmacogenomical study. Therefore, this paper intends to give an introduction to pharmacogenomics. Finally this study also aims at finding the homologue genesequenses in dogs to seven genes that are important for metabolism of paclitaxel in humans. Materials and metods The dogs went through 2 - 4 cycles of paclitaxel treatment, they received a new water-soluble formula named Paccal vet, at dosages of 100 - 150 mg/m 2. Treatment results and adverse effects are listed for each dog in table 1. Gastrointestinal side effects are listed once per dog, bone marrow <b>suppression</b> is <b>listed</b> for each cycle. The dogs’ DNA is prepared from frozen EDTA-bloodsamples. As a result of the creation of different breeds, dogs have very long haplotypes, in which no recombination occurs. Therefore there can’t be an easily accessed map of haplotypes. Instead, one have to assume that by using at least five SNPs per gene of interest all different haplotypes can be covered. After deciding which SNPs to use, the primers for amplifying can be designed by help of different computer programmes. Results All dogs tolerated the substance well; no sensitivity reactions were observed. The most frequent side-effects were bone marrow depression and gastrointestinal upset. At an initial search for the homologue sequences of the chosen genes, only a few were found. The same sequence also showed up for different genes, thus revealing that it may be quite complicated to find the desired homologues, much due to the fact that some of the genes are very similar to each other. Conclusions The fact that dogs seem to tolerate Paccal vet, and the side-effects being manageable, gives a promising future to further studies following up on this small pilot study. It is the first cytostatica made particularly for dogs and also the first paclitaxel preparat tolerated by dogs. However it is a study of very few dogs whom varied greatly in gender, breed, age and size. They also suffered from different diseases in different stages which makes the results unreliable. The further farmacogenomic study of these dogs can although it is small be of great importance. It can show whether the canine genome shows polymorphism in those genes or not. If so, analysis of the results may strengthen the hypothesis that this polymorphism is strongly responsible for the individual variations in dogs as well. The concept of individualizing cancer therapy is one of great appeal, and world wide scientists are digging in to farmacogenomics. Only the future can answer how it will be applied in veterinary medicine. First we need to establish that polymorphism of interesting genes span over breed boundaries, thus it is unrealistic to keep one gene map per breed. However, if this is the case, farmacogenomic testing can prove to be of great value. For dogs with cancer, euthanasia often is a considered alternative, which puts the pet owner and sometimes also the veterinarian in a tough position. It would be of immeasurable value if a simple test could be taken, that answers the question whether this patient has a low or high probability to benefit from treatment. ...|$|R
