The classification has two major divisions: (1) subsolidus, and (2) hypersolvus, depending on the whereabouts of the <b>soda</b> <b>feldspar.</b> In the hypersolvus rocks all the <b>soda</b> <b>feldspar</b> is or was in solid solution in the potash feldspar whereas in the subsolvus rocks the plagioclase is present as discrete grains. The two major divisions are further subdivided according to the nature of the alkali feldspar modification.″ Note that here the word [...] "subsolidus" [...] unfortunately looks like a misprint and probably has to be replaced by [...] "subsolvus".|$|E
50|$|They are {{distinguished}} from ordinary basic syenites {{not only by}} the presence of nepheline but also by the occurrence of many other minerals rich in alkalis and in rare earths and other incompatible elements. Alkali feldspar dominates, commonly represented by orthoclase and the exsolved lamellar albite, form perthite. In some rocks the potash feldspar, in others the <b>soda</b> <b>feldspar</b> predominates. Fresh clear microcline is very characteristic of some types of nepheline syenite.|$|E
50|$|In clay bodies a flux {{creates a}} limited and {{controlled}} amount of glass, which works to cement crystalline components together. Fluxes {{play a key}} role in the vitrification of clay bodies by reducing the overall melting point. The most common fluxes used in clay bodies are potassium oxide andsodium oxide which are found in feldspars. A predominant flux in glazes is calcium oxide which is usually obtained from limestone. The two most common feldspars in the ceramic industry are potash feldspar (orthoclase) and <b>soda</b> <b>feldspar</b> (albite).|$|E
50|$|Except in acid or {{siliceous}} {{igneous rocks}} containing greater than 66% of silica, known as felsic rocks, quartz is not abundant in igneous rocks. In basic rocks (containing 20% of silica or less) {{it is rare}} for them to contain as much silicon, these {{are referred to as}} mafic rocks. If magnesium and iron are above average while silica is low, olivine may be expected; where silica is present in greater quantity over ferro-magnesian minerals, such as augite, hornblende, enstatite or biotite, occur rather than olivine. Unless potash is high and silica relatively low, leucite will not be present, for leucite does not occur with free quartz. Nepheline, likewise, is usually found in rocks with much soda and comparatively little silica. With high alkalis, soda-bearing pyroxenes and amphiboles may be present. The lower the percentage of silica and alkali's, the greater is the prevalence of plagioclase feldspar as contracted with <b>soda</b> or potash <b>feldspar.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} the effect of Al 2 O 3, CaCO 3 and MgCO 3 addition on the physical properties of crawling Shino glaze. The experiment started with the triaxial blend of Al 2 O 3, CaCO 3 and MgCO 3 in the defined ratio and then glazing by dipping. After that, samples were fired at 1250 °C in a reduction atmosphere. Finally, the specimens were boserved the appearance with naked eyes, texture, color of glaze and shrinkage. The results showed that the ratio of 50 % <b>soda</b> <b>feldspar,</b> 50 % Mae-than ball clay and 15 % MgCO 3 were optimum properties of crewling Shino glaze...|$|E
40|$|The {{literature}} on the determination of fluoride is reviewed. Attention Is given to its analysis in silicate materials, especially rocks and minerals; developments in method are traced from the first work, published in 1816, to the present. Special emphasis is given for the period 1951 through 1959, Important methods and other pertinent work and findings being summarized chronologically by subject and without regard to systematic exposition of contradictions or their explanation: The summaries of some work are nevertheless detailed enough to make manifest some contradictions. Conflicting findings on the precision in the visual thorium titration and on the visual ratings of various Indicators for this titration are thought merely to reflect Individual skill and choice rather than superiority of method and (or) indicator. A strong case is thereby made for Instrumental methods of analysis. A method developed to determine fluoride in metamorphic rocks Is described. A sodium peroxide decomposition, followed by a precipitation of silica and alumina and a steam distillation of the filtrates, gave quantitative isolation of fluoride. Aliquot 8 of distillate were titrated spectrephotometric ally in perchloric acid-sodium sulfanilate buffered solution {{in the presence of}} sodium 2 -(p-sulfophenylazo) - 1, 8 -dlbydroxy- naphthalene- 3, 6 -dlsulfonate (SPADNS). The method was tested with synthetic rocks and <b>soda</b> <b>feldspar,</b> to which known amounts,) of fluoride were added. Aliquots were titrated spectrephoto metrically to within one microgram of fluoride. Results with G-l and w- 1 are compared with analyses reported by others. Replicate results for ten raetamorphic rocks indicate a maximum proportional deviation of 2. 0 percent. However, further replications have shown the error is somewhat greater, although nevertheless favorable: The standard deviation for 122 replicate determinations is + 0. 0014. percent fluoride for rocks having up to 0. 09 percent fluoride. The applicability of the perchloric acid-sodium sulfanilate buffer for the thorium titration is examined. It is felt it is superior to the monochloracetlc acid buffer commonly used. The results of an Interlaboratory standardization program conducted to check the validity of several methods and the comparability of results and to suggest possible superior methods of analysis are presented. Agreement is not favorable when all results are compared; possible matrix effects for pyrolltic and chemical methods are considered. Four of the eight procedures employed show favorable agreement, aspects of which are studied. Work, carried out on synthetic solutions containing the elements commonly analyzed in the "main portion" of silicate rock analysis, is given and discussed. Minor modifications, mainly in technique, of the generally accepted methods are detailed. An important improvement in the examination of the calcium oxide and magnesium pyrophosphate precipitates for impurities such as strontium in the former and calcium and manganese In the latter has been developed. Considerable attention Is given to the problem of determining "blanks" for this part of silicate rock analysis...|$|E
