The forests consist of pines (Jack Pine, Red Pine, Eastern White Pine), spruces (White Spruce, Black Spruce), Balsam Fir, Tamarack (larch), poplars (Trembling Aspen, Balsam Poplar), birches (White Birch, <b>Swamp</b> <b>Birch)</b> and small pockets of Eastern White Cedar.|$|E
50|$|Tamarack stands cast light {{shade and}} so {{usually have a}} dense {{undergrowth}} of shrubs and herbs. Because the tree has an extensive range, {{a great variety of}} shrubs is associated with it. Dominant tall shrubs include dwarf and <b>swamp</b> <b>birch</b> (Betula glandulosa and Betula pumila), willows (Salix spp.), speckled alder (Alnus rugosa), and red-osier dogwood (Cornus stolonifera). Low shrubs include bog Labrador tea (Ledum groenlandicum), bog-rosemary (Andromeda glaucophylla), leather leaf (Chamaedaphne calyculata), and small cranberry (Vaccinium oxycoccos). Characteristically the herbaceous cover includes sedges (Carex spp.), cottongrass (Eriophorum spp.), three-leaved false Solomonseal (Maianthemum trifolium), marsh cinquefoil (Potentilla palustris), marsh-marigold (Caltha palustris), and bogbean (Menyanthes trifoliata). Ground cover is usually composed of sphagnum moss (Sphagnum spp.) and other mosses.|$|E
50|$|The six mile square {{that would}} become Dexter was first {{surveyed}} {{in the summer of}} 1851 by a crew working for the U.S. government. In November and December another crew marked all the section corners of the six mile square, walking through the woods and wading the swamps, measuring with chain and compass. When done, the deputy surveyor filed this general description:Surface level, and principally swamp (Tamarack) excepting a narrow strip about forty chains wide on either Bank of Yellow River and Sections 4. 5. 8. 9. 16, 17, and North half of 20. soil 2 rate Hard Pan.

50|$|Matawan Creek's {{main flow}} begins as Bakers Brook in Marlboro Township, Monmouth County, {{north of the}} {{intersection}} of Tennent and Woolleytown Roads. From this point it flows northward through Marlboro and Aberdeen Townships to a point near the Middlesex County line, where it turns in a northeasterly direction. <b>Birch</b> <b>Swamp</b> Brook enters from the right; below this confluence is the impoundment, Lake Lefferts. The section of Bakers Brook in Aberdeen Township {{is also known as}} Matawan Brook.|$|R
50|$|A notable {{feature of}} Lough Derravaragh, as found at Lough Lene, are {{the range of}} {{stoneworts}} that occur within the lake. Eight species have been recorded here, several of which have a restricted range in Ireland. Fringing the lake's shores, a range of habitats has been created {{as a result of}} drainage of the River Inny. At the western side are extensive reed beds and <b>swamps</b> of downy <b>birch</b> and willows. Nearby, there is also freshwater marches vegetation dominated by sedges (Carex spp.) and often tussock-forming grasses such as tufted hair-grass (Deschampsia cespitosa) and fescues (Festuca spp.), with a flowering herbs including Bidens cernua, and trifid bur-marigold.|$|R

50|$|The {{town has}} a total area of 25.5 sq mi, of which 23.1 sq mi is land and 2.5 sq mi, or 9.67%, is water. The town is bordered by Dighton on the northeast, Somerset on the east, Mount Hope Bay on the south, Warren, Rhode Island, on the southwest, Barrington, Rhode Island, on the west, and Seekonk and Rehoboth to the north. Part of the town's border with Somerset {{is made up}} of the Lees River. The Cole, Kickamuit and Palmer rivers also pass through the town on their way south to Mount Hope Bay (for the Kickamuit, Cole and Lees rivers) and Narragansett Bay (for the Palmer). The entire town {{is a part of the}} Narragansett Bay {{watershed}} area. The town's neighborhoods include Barneyville, North Swansea, Swansea Village, <b>Birch</b> <b>Swamp</b> Corner, Hortonville, Luther Corner, South Swansea, Touissett, Ocean Grove, and Smokerise. Swansea is 12 mi southeast of Providence and 47 mi south of Boston.|$|R
50|$|According to the 2000 Census, {{there is}} 406,326 people living within 10 mi of this site. The superfund site is {{currently}} {{surrounded by a}} large hurricane fence to prevent unauthorized entry into the site. Surrounding the site are many areas that also may be critically affected by the contaminants in the soil and water, including wetlands, wooded areas, streams, ponds and lakes. When investigated, Off-site sediments were contaminated with arsenic, lead, phthalates, and PCBs. The surface soil is contaminated with heavy metals including chromium, lead, and arsenic, and PCBs. Surface water contained arsenic. On April 15, 2004 - properties adjacent to the Imperial Oil Superfund site in Marlboro Township were {{the focus of a}} clean-up. More than 18,000 cubic yards of contaminated sediment and soil were removed from <b>Birch</b> <b>Swamp</b> Brook and adjacent properties between the Imperial Oil site and Texas Road. Restoration of the brook and adjacent properties has followed in phases upon completion of excavation work. The contamination on the site affects the ground water at Englishtown Aquifer, an important source of water supply for Monmouth and Northern Ocean County residents.|$|R
5000|$|A young brave {{regularly}} paddled {{around the}} perimeter of Cold Lake (“Luwe Chok Tuwe” in Dene) to visit a beautiful young girl who he hoped would one day be his wife. It is safer to travel {{around the perimeter}} of Cold Lake because the wind can rapidly whip up large waves which can <b>swamp</b> a small <b>birch</b> bark canoe. This particular evening was calm and the lake was like glass so the brave decided to take a short cut across the water. As he got farther out, the water around him began to swirl. There was a thundering splash as the Kinosoo ("big fish" [...] in Dene) roared up and bit the canoe in half. The brave desperately tried to beat off the Kinosoo with his paddle but soon disappeared below the waves. The young girl {{on the other side of}} Bay witnessed the struggle and waited in vain for her beloved to appear. The next morning a broken paddle and bits of canoe drifted ashore and the brave was never seen again.So from this day forward the Dene have avoided crossing large expanses of open water in their canoes.|$|R
5000|$|Theodore Winthrop, in Life in the Open Air (1856?) wrote: [...] "At noon we floated out upon Lake Pemadumcook, {{the largest}} bulge of the Penobscot, and {{irregular}} as the verb To Be. Lumbermen name it Bammydumcook : Iglesias insisted upon {{this as the}} proper reading and as he was the responsible man of the party, I accepted it. Woods, woody hills, and woody mountains surround Bammydumcook. I have no doubt parts of it are pretty, and will be famous in good time but we saw little. By {{the time we were}} fairly out in the lake and away from the sheltering shore, a black squall to windward, hiding all the West, warned us to fly, for <b>birches</b> <b>swamp</b> in squalls. We deemed that Birch, having brought us through handsomely, deserved a better fate : swamped it must not be. We plied paddle valiantly, and were almost safe behind an arm of the shore when the storm overtook us, and in a moment more, safe, with a canoe only half- full of Bammydumcook water. It is easy to speak in scoffing tone but when that great roaring blackness sprang upon us, and the waves, showing their white teeth, snarled around, we were far from being in the mood to scoff. It is impossible to say too much of the charm of this gentle scenery, mingled with the charm of this adventurous sailing." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1991, EPA {{excavated}} and {{disposed of}} approximately 660 {{cubic yards of}} PCB-contaminated material from a waste filter clay pile located on-site. The contaminated soil beneath the former pile is covered with an impermeable material to prevent the infiltration of water and to prevent human contact. EPA installed extraction wells and an oil/water treatment system to remove the floating oil layer from the ground water. The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) is currently using these wells to continue the removal of floating oil. To date, NJDEP has removed over 20,000 gallons of PCB-contaminated oil. In 1998, EPA excavated and disposed of 6,488 cubic yards of contaminated soil (roughly equivalent to one football field, covered one yard deep) from four nearby residences. NJDEP completed a study determining the full {{nature and extent of}} the contamination. The cleanup plan calls for the excavation and off-site disposal of contaminated soil and removal and off-site incineration of floating product; dismantling buildings and tank farms needed to complete the soil excavation; and restoring wetlands. In 2004, NJDEP excavated and disposed of 14,889 cubic yards of contaminated soil and sediment from the <b>Birch</b> <b>Swamp</b> Brook and adjacent properties. In April 2009, Congressman Rush Holt announced Imperial Oil Superfund site is expected to get a $25 million-plus allotment of cash to complete the clean-up efforts. Mayor Hornik said [...] "With this allocation of federal funds, the final stages of the cleanup of the Imperial Oil Site can begin." ...|$|R
