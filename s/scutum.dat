5|$|The Ixodidae {{contains}} over 700 {{species of}} hard ticks with a <b>scutum</b> or hard shield, which the Argasidae lack. The Argasidae contains about 200 species; the genera accepted as of 2010 are Antricola, Argas, Nothoaspis, Ornithodoros and Otobius. They have no <b>scutum,</b> and the capitulum (mouth and feeding parts) is concealed beneath the body. The family Nuttalliellidae contains {{only a single}} species, Nuttalliella namaqua, a tick found in southern Africa from Tanzania to Namibia and South Africa.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, two Brazilian zoologists {{described}} {{a new species}} of arachnid called Taito spaceinvaders Kury & Barros, 2014, inspired in the game because of the resemblance of a fleck in the dorsal <b>scutum</b> of the animal with the typical alien of the game.|$|E
5|$|Serpens Caput is {{bordered by}} Libra to the south, Virgo and Boötes to the east, Corona Borealis {{to the north}}, and Ophiuchus and Hercules to the west; Serpens Cauda is bordered by Sagittarius to the south, <b>Scutum</b> and Aquila to the east, and Ophiuchus {{to the north and}} west. Covering 636.9 square degrees total, it ranks 23rd of the 88 constellations in size. It appears {{prominently}} in both the northern and southern skies during the Northern Hemisphere's summer. Its main asterism consists of 11 stars, and 108 stars in total are brighter than magnitude 6.5, the traditional limit for naked-eye visibility.|$|E
5|$|The classic legionary <b>scutum,</b> a convex {{rectangular}} shield, also disappeared {{during the}} 3rd century. All troops except archers adopted large, wide, usually dished, ovoid (or sometimes round) shields. These shields were still called Scuta or Clipei, despite {{the difference in}} shape. Shields, from examples found at Dura Europos and Nydam, were of vertical plank construction, the planks glued, and mostly faced inside and out with painted leather. The edges of the shield were bound with stitched rawhide, which shrank as it dried improving structural cohesion.|$|E
25|$|<b>Scutum</b> {{was named}} in 1684 by Polish {{astronomer}} Johannes Hevelius (Jan Heweliusz), who originally named it <b>Scutum</b> Sobiescianum (Shield of Sobieski) {{to commemorate the}} victory of the Christian forces led by Polish King John III Sobieski (Jan III Sobieski) in the Battle of Vienna in 1683. Later, the name was shortened to <b>Scutum.</b>|$|E

25|$|In late 1683, in {{commemoration}} of the victory of Christian forces led by Polish King John III Sobieski at the Battle of Vienna, he invented and named the constellation <b>Scutum</b> Sobiescianum (Sobieski's Shield), now called <b>Scutum.</b> This constellation first occurred publicly in his star atlas Firmamentum Sobiescianum, that was printed in his own house at lavish expense, and he himself engraved many of the printing plates.|$|E
25|$|Although not a large constellation, <b>Scutum</b> {{contains}} several open clusters, {{as well as}} a {{globular cluster}} and a planetary nebula. The two best known deep sky objects in <b>Scutum</b> are M11 (the Wild Duck Cluster) and the open cluster M26 (NGC 6694). The globular cluster NGC 6712 and the planetary nebula IC 1295 {{can be found in the}} eastern part of the constellation, only 24 arcminutes apart.|$|E
25|$|<b>Scutum</b> {{is a small}} {{constellation}} {{introduced in}} the seventeenth century. Its name is Latin for shield.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis: Capitulum with slender palpi, hypostome rounded apically, {{dentition}} 2/2; <b>scutum</b> {{about as}} long as wide, with faint lateral carinae; all coxae with small, external spurs.|$|E
25|$|Five {{bright stars}} of <b>Scutum</b> (α Sct, β Sct, δ Sct, ε Sct and η Sct) were {{previously}} known as 1, 6, 2, 3, and 9 Aquilae respectively.|$|E
25|$|The female does engorge. The shield (<b>scutum)</b> covers {{only the}} front {{part of the}} dorsal body. The {{mouthparts}} section (the capitulum) is very long because it is required for feeding.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis: Capitulum as in female, hypostome {{dentition}} mainly 2/2, 3/3 distally; <b>scutum</b> {{about as}} long as wide with lateral carinae; sternal plate present, oval; anal grooves converging posteriorly but remaining narrowly open; legs as in female.|$|E
25|$|The parma {{was used}} in the Roman army of the mid-Republic, by the lowest class {{division}} of the army — the velites. The velites equipment consisted of a parma, javelin, sword and helmet. Later, the parma was replaced by the <b>scutum.</b>|$|E
25|$|Scutum: Oval, convex, only {{a little}} smaller than body. Lateral grooves deep and {{completely}} encircling the <b>scutum,</b> anteriorly somewhat linear and may simulate mild lateral carinae. Punctations fine, usually most numerous submarginally and anteromedianly; pseudoscutum sometimes faintly apparent. Cervical grooves, short, shallow. Emargination moderate. Scapulae blunt.|$|E

Oxford Classical Text edition of the Greek text of Hesiod's Theogony, Works and Days, and Shield (usually in translation as the Shield of Heracles).|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis: Body {{measurements}} {{less than}} 3.0 x 2.5mm; lateral grooves completely encircling <b>scutum,</b> no lateral carinae; punctuations fine; basis capituli punctate dorsally, palpi short and very broad; hypostome dentition 2/2, with rounded teeth; anal plate bluntly pointed behind; adanal plate curving inwardly to a point; coxae with well-defined spurs decreasing in size posteriorly; trochanters III and IV frequently with small, ventral spurs.|$|E
25|$|The most {{prominent}} open cluster in <b>Scutum</b> is the Wild Duck Cluster, M11. It was named by William Henry Smyth in 1844 for its resemblance in the eyepiece to {{a flock of}} ducks in flight. The cluster, 6200 light-years from Earth and 20 light-years in diameter, contains approximately 3000 stars, making it a particularly rich cluster. It is 220 million years old.|$|E
25|$|Haemaphysalis leporispalustris is {{extremely}} {{similar to the}} 155 other members of its genus. It lacks eyes and has palpi that are wider than they are long. The <b>scutum</b> lacks ornamentation on both males and females. The basis of its capitulum is of rectangular shape, rather than a hexagonal shape. The adult rabbit tick is approximately 1 millimeter in length and contains festoons or wrinkles {{at the base of}} its body.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis: A {{very large}} tick when fully engorged; <b>scutum</b> {{about as long}} as broad and {{broadest}} a little posterior to mid length, with strong lateral carinae; capitulum relatively long porose areas deep, cornua usually absent, but when present at most only mild and rounded; auriculae present; hypostome lanceolate, dentition mainly 3/3; no sternal plate; anal grooves meeting at a point behind; all coxae with an external spur decreasing in size posteriorly; trochanters III and IV usually with small, pointed ventral spurs.|$|E
25|$|The male {{does not}} engorge. The shield (<b>scutum)</b> covers the entire dorsal body. It has a {{tortoiseshell}} pattern. The mouthparts section (the capitulum) is very short {{because it is}} not required for feeding from the host (though it may be used to feed from the female tick). The male tick does not pose a medical risk to humans or animals - the significance of finding a male is that it is looking for a female - so humans and animals should be checked fully for the possible presence of an adult female tick somewhere.|$|E
25|$|The {{infantry}} (armatura) was heavy, {{because they}} had helmets (cassis), coats of mail (catafracta), greaves (ocrea), shields (<b>scutum),</b> larger swords (gladius maior), which they call broadswords (spatha), and some smaller, which they name half-broadswords (semispathium), five weighted darts (plumbata) placed in the shields, which they hurl {{at the beginning of}} the assault, then double throwables, a larger one with an iron point of nine ounces and a stock of five and one-half feet, which was called a pilum, but now is called a spiculum, in the use of which the soldiers were especially practised, and with skill and courage could penetrate the shields of the infantry and the mail of the cavalry. The other smaller had five ounces of iron and a stock of three and one-half feet, and was called a vericulum but now is a verutum. The first line, of hastati, and the second, of principes, were composed of such arms. Behind them were the bearers (ferentarius) and the light infantry, whom now we say are the supporters and the infantry, shield-bearers (<b>scutum)</b> with darts (plumbata) and swords (gladius), armed just as are nearly all soldiers today. There were likewise bowmen (sagittarius) with helmet (cassis), coat of mail (catafracta), sword (gladius), arrows (sagitta) and bow (arcus). There were slingers (funditor) who slung small stones (lapis) in slings (funda) or cudgel-throwers (fustibalus). There were artillery-men (tragularius), who shot arrows from the manuballista and the arcuballista.|$|E
25|$|The Zulu warriors used a long {{version of}} the assegai javelin as their primary weapon. The Zulu legendary leader Shaka {{initiated}} military reforms in which a short stabbing spear, with a long, swordlike spearhead named iklwa had become the Zulu warrior's main weapon and {{was used as a}} mêlée weapon. The assegai was not discarded, but was used for an initial missile assault. With the larger shields, introduced by Shaka to the Zulu army, the short spears used as stabbing swords and the opening phase of javelin attack the Zulu regiments were quite similar to the Roman legion with its <b>Scutum,</b> Gladius and Pilum tactical combination.|$|E
25|$|<b>Scutum</b> is not {{a bright}} constellation, with the {{brightest}} star, Alpha Scuti, at magnitude 3.85. But some stars are notable in the constellation. Beta Scuti is the second brightest at magnitude 4.22, followed by Delta Scuti at magnitude 4.72. Beta Scuti is a binary system, with the primary with a spectral type similar to the Sun, although it is 1,270 times brighter. Delta Scuti is a bluish white giant star, which is now coming {{at the direction of}} the Solar System. Within 1.3 million years it will come as close to 10 light years from Earth, and will be much brighter than Sirius by that time.|$|E
25|$|The {{legions of}} the late Republic and early Empire are often called Marian legions. Following the Battle of Vercellae in 101 BC, Marius granted all Italian {{soldiers}} Roman citizenship. He justified this action to the Senate by saying that in the din of battle he could not distinguish Roman from ally. This effectively eliminated the notion of allied legions; henceforth all Italian legions would be regarded as Roman legions, and full Roman citizenship was open to all the regions of Italy. At the same time, the three different types of heavy infantry were replaced by a single, standard type based on the Principes: armed with two heavy javelins called pila (singular pilum), the short sword called gladius, chain mail (lorica hamata), helmet and rectangular shield (<b>scutum).</b>|$|E
25|$|The Opiliones {{are known}} for having {{exceptionally}} long legs relative to their body size; however, some species are short-legged. As in the Araneae, {{the body in the}} Opiliones has two tagmata, the anterior cephalothorax or prosoma, and the posterior 10-segmented abdomen or opisthosoma. The most obvious difference between harvestmen and spiders is that in harvestmen, the connection between the cephalothorax and abdomen is broad, so that the body appears to be a single oval structure. Other differences are that the Opiliones have no venom glands in their chelicerae and therefore pose no danger to humans. They also have no silk glands and therefore do not build webs. In some highly derived species, the first five abdominal segments are fused into a dorsal shield called the <b>scutum,</b> which in most such species is fused with the carapace. Some such Opiliones only have this shield in the males. In some species, the two posterior abdominal segments are reduced. Some of them are divided medially on the surface to form two plates beside each other. The second pair of legs is longer than the others and function as antennae or feelers. In short-legged species, this may not be obvious.|$|E
25|$|The {{difference}} between harvestmen and spiders {{is that in}} harvestmen the two main body sections (the abdomen or opisthosoma with ten segments and the cephalothorax or prosoma) are nearly joined, so that {{they appear to be}} one oval structure. In more advanced species, the first five abdominal segments are often fused into a dorsal shield called the <b>scutum,</b> which is normally fused with the carapace. Sometimes this shield is only present in males. The two hindmost abdominal segments may be reduced or separated in the middle on the surface to form two plates lying next to each other. The second pair of legs is longer than the others and works as antennae. They have a single pair of eyes {{in the middle of their}} heads, oriented sideways. They have a pair of prosomatic scent glands that secrete a peculiar smelling fluid when disturbed. Harvestmen do not have spinnerets and do not possess poison glands, posing absolutely no danger to humans. They breathe through tracheae. Between the base of the fourth pair of legs and the abdomen is a pair of spiracles, one opening on each side. In more active species, spiracles are also found upon the tibia of the legs. They have a gonopore on the ventral cephalothorax, and copulation is direct, as the male has a penis (while the female has an ovipositor).|$|E

500|$|In nymphs {{and adults}} {{of the family}} Ixodidae, the [...] is {{prominent}} and projects forwards from the body, a feature not present in the Argasidae. The eyes {{are close to the}} sides of the <b>scutum,</b> and the large spiracles are located just behind the coxae of the fourth pair of legs. The hard, protective scutellum, characteristic of this family, covers the whole dorsal surface in males but is restricted to a small, shield-like structure behind the capitulum in females and nymphs. They differ, too, in their life cycle; Ixodidae that attach to a host bite painlessly and generally unnoticed, and they remain in place until they engorge and are ready to change their skin; this process may take days or weeks. Some species drop off the host to moult in a safe place, whereas others remain on the same host and only drop off once they are ready to lay their eggs.|$|E
500|$|The type {{specimen}} numbers are UC no. 15174 and USNM no. 69617 {{for the part}} and counterpart; females of the type species A. rostratus have a body length estimated to be between , with a small gaster that is shorter than the mesosoma and sporting a short thick sting. The length of the head when excluding the mandibles is , the mesosoma is [...] and the middle femur is around [...] The preserved specimens are brown and the upper area {{of the head and}} gaster is black, which is similar to Myrmecia nigriceps. The head capsules have antennae borne on a scape which is long and passes the edge of the occipital margin of the head. The short, thickened mandibles have several larger teeth interspersed with small denticles, and are about 50% of the length of the head capsule. The scape is believed to be long and thin, and its mesosoma is narrow and long. The width of the <b>scutum</b> is greater than its length, the legs are noticeably elongated and thin, and the podeum (a narrow stalk that connects the mesosoma with the abdomen) is slightly convex.|$|E
500|$|The mesosoma is [...] {{wide and}} covered in erect setae (on the dorsal surfaces). On the propodeum, the setae are {{slightly}} recurved. The neck is long and one-quarter {{the length of the}} thorax (when excluding the propodeum). V-shaped sulci are present on the dorsomedial portion of the pronotum. The promesonotal suture (a rigid joint between two or more hard elements of an organism) is also well developed and complete. The sulcus is known to demarcate the entirety of the ants' mesoscutum and mesoscutellum. When measured, the scutellum is approximately half the length of the <b>scutum,</b> and the scutellums dorsal surface has a pair of deep, rectangular-shaped foveae that is located nearby the median line. The dorsellum is well developed and has a pair of shallow foveae. The pronotum contains little to no foveae or setae, but it is fully developed. The mesopleuron is separated from the mesosoma by complete sulci, and when viewed dorsally, it bears a series of C-shaped grooves and foveae. The propodeum measures [...] long and sports a slit-like spiracle which faces to the rear; the posterior margin of the propodeum is shelf-like and medically emarginates. The metapleural gland has a large, crescent shaped opening and well developed metapleural bulla. Trochantellus is found on all legs, and they are very well separated from the trochanter (leg part attached rigidly to the femur) and femur on both the meso- and metathoracic legs (the middle and hindmost pair of legs). On the ventral margin, a subapical tooth can be seen on the large claws. The metasoma is mostly obscured by a large bubble. A large stinger appears to be present.|$|E
500|$|The retiarius was {{traditionally}} {{pitted against}} a secutor or, possibly on rare occasions, a murmillo. Despite {{the disparity between}} the nearly nude net-fighter and his heavily armoured adversary, modern re-enactments and experiments show that the retiarius {{was by no means}} outmatched. His lack of heavy equipment meant that he could use speed and evasion to his advantage. He also fought with three offensive weapons to his opponent's one. The net-fighter had to avoid close combat at all costs, keep his distance, and wait for an opening to stab with his trident or throw his net. The name secutor means [...] "pursuer" [...] or [...] "chaser", because this gladiator had to chase down the retiarius. They were also known as contraretiarii ("those against the net-man"). The secutors strategy was to keep behind his shield (<b>scutum)</b> and force his opponent into close combat so that he could strike with his sword. In close quarters, the net-man had only his galerus shoulder guard for defence; its design forced him to keep his head ducked down behind it. The secutors helmet greatly restricted his sight, hearing, and airflow. Coupled with the heavy weight of his arms and armour—the gear of a murmillo, of which the secutor was a variant, weighed —this gladiator was in greater danger of exhausting himself in a long fight. One of the retiariuss tactics was to jab at the secutors shield (the heaviest part of his equipment), forcing him to block and wear himself out. [...] Overall, Roman oddsmakers gave an advantage to a retiarius, although skill and experience could affect the odds in individual matches.|$|E

The clypeus (one of the sclerites that make up the [...] "face" [...] of an arthropod or insect) is broad and convex and the ocelli (photoreceptors) are well developed. The mesosoma is slender and closely resembles those of Methocha malayana, measuring [...] The mesonotum is also long and slender with a distinct convexed <b>scutum</b> and scutellum, but these two features are separated from each other by an axillary region. Spiracles are present on the metathorax, but they are situated just below the scutellum. The petiole has a raised node and separated from the propodeum and the gaster. The gaster measures , and an acute protruding stinger, measuring [...] is present. The legs are long and slender with two tibial spurs present at each tibia, and the tarsal claws have a median tooth. The two worker specimens have little morphological differences, but they range in size. The head and segments of the antenna tend to be smaller in the holotype specimen while in the paratype they are slightly larger. The pubescence is short but scattered throughout the body, measuring [...] The colour of the specimens appears to be light-brown. The metapleural gland exhibits a notably wide and oval-shaped orifice, (openings into the body). The separation between the orifice and the posterior portion of the propodeum is twice the diameter than the orifice itself. The cuticle situated in the anterior portion (referring to what is in front) of the orifice is thinner in contrast to the cuticle surrounding the mesosoma, where it is notably transparent. An oddly shaped chamber can be seen beneath the cuticle, but this is most likely the atrium (chamber with a hardened, thickened wall). The gland itself is covered in a whitish mass and is located in the [...] region (meaning in front and toward the back) of the subcuticular chamber. The gland is said to be shrunken from its original size.|$|E
