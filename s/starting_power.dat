5|$|West and Cooke settled their differences—and {{the former}} Laker's lawsuit—and Cooke {{hired him to}} replace Sharman as the team's coach. West became upset, however, when Cooke refused {{to spend the money}} {{necessary}} to acquire forward Julius Erving, who the Nets were selling. Behind another MVP season from Abdul-Jabbar, Los Angeles won the Pacific Division, finishing the 1976–77 season a league-best 53–29. They defeated the Warriors in a seven-game series to open the postseason before being swept by Portland in the Western Conference Finals. During the offseason, Los Angeles picked up Jamaal Wilkes from Golden State and signed first-round draft pick Norm Nixon. In the first two minutes of {{the first game of the}} 1977–78 season, Abdul-Jabbar punched Bucks center Kent Benson for an overly aggressive elbow and broke his hand. Two months later, a healthy Abdul-Jabbar got into an altercation with Houston Rockets center Kevin Kunnert after a rebound. The team's <b>starting</b> <b>power</b> forward, Kermit Washington, who was averaging 11.5 points and 11.2 rebounds, entered the fight, and when Rudy Tomjanovich ran in from the bench to break up the action, Washington punched him in the face. Tomjanovich nearly died from the punch, suffering a fractured skull and other facial injuries which prematurely ended his playing career. Washington, who stated that he assumed Tomjanovich was a combatant, was suspended for two months by the NBA, and released by the Lakers. The team won 45 games despite being down a starter in Washington and not having Abdul-Jabbar for nearly two months, but lost in the first round of the playoffs to Seattle. During the 1978–79 season, the team posted a 47–35 record but lost to the SuperSonics in the semifinal round of the playoffs.|$|E

25|$|After {{finishing}} as the National Runner-up in the 2014 NCAA Tournament, {{the expectations}} {{for this team}} were high. The team, however, would be without some of its top players from the 2013–14 team including <b>starting</b> <b>power</b> forward Julius Randle and starting small forward James Young, who were first-round draft choices in the 2014 NBA Draft. Returning were starting point guard Andrew Harrison, starting shooting guard Aaron Harrison, and starting center Dakari Johnson. Former McDonald's All-Americans Marcus Lee and Alex Poythress also returned to school. Willie Cauley-Stein opted {{to return to school}} after his leg injury in the 2014 NCAA Tournament.

25|$|The Nets {{were in the}} mix {{prior to}} the season to be contenders in the Eastern Conference {{alongside}} the Miami Heat. Pierce and Garnett were set to be the 'supporting cast' to Deron Williams, Joe Johnson, and Brook Lopez. However, with Lopez going down with a season-ending injury in December, Pierce was entrusted with the <b>starting</b> <b>power</b> forward spot. As the season moved along and the Nets continued to struggle, doubt began to creep around the locker room, front office, and fan base. That's when the Nets saw revitalization in Pierce's game and his never-say-die attitude. After scrapping past the Toronto Raptors {{in the first round}} of the playoffs thanks to a last-second block from Pierce in Game 7, their attempt to get past the Heat and win a championship fell short. They lost to Miami in five games in the second round, and questions began to linger about whether Pierce would give it another year in Brooklyn.|$|E

Howard only started 38 games, including 32 consecutive starts between December 26, 2006, and March 3, 2007, while center Yao was recovering from his fractured right leg. The 2006–07 Rockets were 52–30 under Van Gundy for the regular season. The Rockets entered the 2007 NBA Playoffs with little experience; Howard was one of only three players on the team (along with Rafer Alston and Dikembe Mutombo) to have previously won any NBA playoff series. Once the playoffs began, Howard served as a key reserve on the Rockets' short bench rotation that also included Luther Head and Mutombo. The Rockets managed to split the first 4 games even though Head and Howard only combined to average 7.6 points, including a combined pointless 0-for-10 game three. Although Howard had a productive game five with 12 points and 6 rebounds which contributed to a Rockets victory, the team lost {{in the first round of}} the 2007 playoffs to the , four games to three. [...] In the playoffs, reserve Howard averaged 5.0points and 4.4rebounds in 22.4minutes. Although Howard was described as a consistent role player and locker-room leader, his salary continued to be perceived as outrageous by sportswriters such as the Houston Chronicle Jerome Solomon.|$|E

50|$|In addition, {{four-stroke}} cycle flat-fours {{have a problem}} common to all four-cylinder engines: the power strokes do not overlap.

This results in gaps between power strokes and a pulsating delivery of torque to the flywheel, causing a rotational vibration on the entire engine along the crankshaft axis. By contrast, in engines with more cylinders the power strokes overlap; the next piston <b>starts</b> its <b>power</b> stroke before the previous one has finished, and the delivery of power is much smoother.|$|R

On March 6, Odom posted a triple double, scoring 30 points with 19 rebounds and 11 assists in a home win against the Sacramento Kings. The Heat would go on to the clinch the 4th seed in the playoffs, facing off the New Orleans Hornets in the first round.

[...] In January, when asked by the late Craig Sager {{as to whether he}} thought would be traded, Pippen replied, [...] "I hope I am". However, Pippen would remain a Bull and those rumors were put to rest once it was announced that Michael Jordan would be returning to the Bulls late in the [...] season. The Pippen-led Bulls did not play as well in the [...] season as they had in the season before. In fact, {{for the first time in}} years they were in danger of missing the playoffs (though much of this may be due to a lack of interior defense and rebounding due to Grant's departure). The Bulls were just 34–31 prior to Jordan's return for the final 17 games, and Jordan led them to a 13–4 record to close the regular season. Still, Pippen finished the [...] season leading the Bulls in every major statistical category—points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks—becoming only the second player in NBA history to accomplish this (Dave Cowens did it in it has since been achieved also by Kevin Garnett in , LeBron James in , and Giannis Antetokounmpo in [...] ).|$|E
