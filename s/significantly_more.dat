25|$|Most habitat {{attributes}} measured for the Indiana bat were insignificant {{as well as}} inconsistent {{from one}} location to another. In Missouri, oak-hickory stands with maternity colonies had <b>significantly</b> (p=0.01) <b>more</b> medium trees (12–22inches (30–57cm) dbh) and <b>significantly</b> (p=0.01) <b>more</b> large sized trees (>22inches (57cm) dbh) than areas where Indiana bats were not found. No other major landscape differences were detected.|$|R
30|$|Scratches {{with smaller}} width-to-depth ratio enhance laser light {{intensity}} <b>more</b> <b>significantly</b> and <b>more</b> {{harmful to the}} improvement of laser damage threshold of KDP. The {{results suggest that the}} mechanical scratches must be avoided to achieve high-quality surface of strong resistance to UV laser pulses, especially those with smaller width-to-depth ratios.|$|R
5|$|Though not {{confirmed}} to be a terrestrial planet and <b>significantly</b> <b>more</b> massive than Earth (at 6.98 Earth masses), the Super-Earth {{is the first}} exoplanet of terrestrial mass proposed to orbit within the habitable zone of its parent star.|$|E
5|$|According to Freitas, {{direct contact}} with civilizations <b>significantly</b> <b>more</b> {{advanced}} than humanity {{would have to take}} place within the Solar System, as only the more advanced society would have the resources and technology to cross interstellar space. Consequently, such contact could only be with civilizations rated as Type II or higher on the Kardashev scale, as Type I civilizations would be incapable of regular interstellar travel. Freitas expected that such interactions would be carefully planned by the more advanced civilization to avoid mass societal shock for humanity.|$|E
5|$|Although flat designs {{have the}} benefit of simplicity, other designs such as {{inverted}} pyramids and cones can be <b>significantly</b> <b>more</b> effective. This is probably because the designs shield the condensing surfaces from unwanted heat radiated by the lower atmosphere, and, being symmetrical, they are not sensitive to wind direction.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to examine whether reasons to adopt vegetarian lifestyle differ significantly among generations. Using a Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ), we identified that 4 % of the participants were vegans, 25 % lacto-ovo-vegetarians, 4 % pesco-vegetarians and 67 % non-vegetarian. Younger people <b>significantly</b> agreed <b>more</b> with the moral reason and with the environmental reason. People ages 41 – 60 <b>significantly</b> agreed <b>more</b> with the health reason. There are significant differences across generations as to why people choose to live a vegetarian lifestyle...|$|R

5|$|As an even-numbered lanthanide, in {{accordance}} with the Oddo-Harkins rule, ytterbium is <b>significantly</b> <b>more</b> abundant than its immediate neighbors, thulium and lutetium, which occur in the same concentrate at levels of about 0.5% each. The world production of ytterbium is only about 50 tonnes per year, reflecting that it has few commercial applications. Microscopic traces of ytterbium are used as a dopant in the , a solid-state laser in which ytterbium is the element that undergoes stimulated emission of electromagnetic radiation.|$|E
5|$|Having taken heavy {{casualties}} and losing strategic superiority, Burbridge {{and his men}} conducted a disorganized withdrawal. The Confederates had succeeded in holding the rail breastworks, yet had expended most of their ammunition in doing so. Each Confederate infantryman had fired at least seventy-five rounds, with some firing <b>significantly</b> <b>more.</b> The Union commanders then ordered another charge with a cavalry regiment that reinforced the Union infantry. The unexpected fighting capabilities of the small Confederate force had temporarily created a reprieve for the salt works.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, {{the police}} in Tripura {{recorded}} 5,803 cognisable offences under the Indian Penal Code, a number second only to Assam (66,714) in North East India. The crime rate in the state was 158.1 per 100,000 people, less than the all-India average of 192.2. However, 2010 reports showed that the state topped all the states for crime against women, with a rate of 46.5 per 100,000 people, <b>significantly</b> <b>more</b> than the national rate of 18.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{influence}} of butanol/gasoline blends at low temperature for- 7 oC, on cold-start emissions of a spark-ignition engine was tested. In cold-start {{period of the}} engine, {{the efficiency of the}} engine was expected to be poor, and the air/fuel mixture would be leaner for the more butanol added. The experimental results showed that the engine could be stable with B 10 and B 30 in cold-start, and HC and CO emissions reduced <b>more</b> <b>significantly</b> with <b>more</b> butanol added...|$|R
5|$|In later years, Wenger's {{training}} {{regime has}} come under criticism, given his squad's poor injury record. From 2004–05 to 2014–15, Arsenal's players lost 13,161 days through injury, {{the most in the}} Premier League, and <b>significantly</b> <b>more</b> than Chelsea in second (7,217). In 2014, Wenger acquired the help of fitness coach Shad Forsythe to solve the problem; statistics revealed a year later that Arsenal's average injury length dropped more than 25% in Forsythe's first season.|$|E
5|$|It is {{slightly}} larger than Pallas, though <b>significantly</b> <b>more</b> massive. Vesta is the last remaining rocky protoplanet (with a differentiated interior) {{of the kind that}} formed the terrestrial planets. Numerous fragments of Vesta were ejected by collisions one and two billion years ago that left two enormous craters occupying much of Vesta's southern hemisphere. Debris from these events has fallen to Earth as howardite–eucrite–diogenite (HED) meteorites, which have been a rich source of information about Vesta.|$|E
5|$|Predator {{detection}} by {{the males}} becomes particularly important {{during the period}} when the infants are born. Raptors spend <b>significantly</b> <b>more</b> time near the squirrel monkey troops during this period, and prey on {{a significant number of}} the newborn infants. Other animals that prey on Central American squirrel monkey infants include toucans, tayras, opossums, coatis, snakes, and even spider monkeys.|$|E

5|$|Since {{trade and}} {{commerce}} typically involve items <b>significantly</b> <b>more</b> massive than one gram, and since a mass standard made of water would be inconvenient and unstable, {{the regulation of}} commerce necessitated the manufacture of a practical realization of the water-based definition of mass. Accordingly, a provisional mass standard was made as a single-piece, metallic artifact one thousand times as massive as the gram—the kilogram.|$|E
5|$|Sonatas and Interludes is a {{collection}} of twenty pieces for prepared piano by American avant-garde composer John Cage (1912–1992). It was composed in 1946–48, shortly after Cage's introduction to Indian philosophy and the teachings of art historian Ananda K. Coomaraswamy, both of which became major influences on the composer's later work. <b>Significantly</b> <b>more</b> complex than his other works for prepared piano, Sonatas and Interludes is generally recognized as one of Cage's finest achievements.|$|E
5|$|The {{adverse effects}} of {{long-term}} linezolid therapy were first identified during postmarketing surveillance. Bone marrow suppression was not identified during Phase III trials, in which treatment did not exceed 21 days. Although some participants of early trials did experience thrombocytopenia, it {{was found to be}} reversible and did not occur <b>significantly</b> <b>more</b> frequently than in controls (participants not taking linezolid). There have also been postmarketing reports of seizures, and, , a single case each of Bell's palsy (paralysis of the facial nerve) and kidney toxicity.|$|E
30|$|At Hirna site, NSCBR-(25) 2, NSCBR- 59, NSCBR- 31 and NSCBR- 57 {{isolates}} {{significantly increased}} the NDW of Dursitu genotype. All, except NSCBR-(25) 2 and NSCBR- 18 isolates, <b>significantly</b> increased <b>more</b> NDW with Gofta {{than with the}} uninoculated control. With Kufanzik, inoculating NSCBR- 16, NSCBR- 18 and NSCBR- 57 <b>more</b> <b>significantly</b> increased NDW than uninoculated control. At Babile site, none of the isolates with Dursitu and Kufanzik significantly affected the NDW {{when compared to the}} control.

5|$|The {{following}} season, Keenor became <b>significantly</b> <b>more</b> {{involved in}} the first team at Ninian Park, missing the opening game of the season, a defeat to Watford, before playing in five consecutive matches due to an injury to Patrick Cassidy. Following Cassidy's return {{he dropped out of}} the side, not appearing for the first team from October 1914 until a match on 2 January 1915, which led to Keenor featuring in 15 of the Bluebirds next 18 matches.|$|E
50|$|No {{significant}} differences in habitat use between genders were observed in Arizona. Typical habitat in southern Arizona was characterized by 74% tree cover, 60% leaf cover, 21% shrub cover, and 16% rock cover. Additionally, 67% of all brush mice relocated by radiotelemetry {{in the study were}} located in a riparian zone with the other observations occurring in uplands and an intermittent stream channel. Brush mice used sites with <b>significantly</b> (P<0.05) <b>more</b> rock cover (19% to 22%) during winter and spring than at other times of the year.
