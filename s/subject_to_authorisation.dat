40|$|The {{objective}} is to investigate if a system of tradable environmental permits to reduce VOC-Emissions for facilities not requiring official approval for operation is applicable, and wether such a system offers benefits in practice. A general tradeable permit model and a pilot project for VOC abatement among approval exempt auto paint and body shops were designed. Both are ready for approval. The legal framework for the conception was the EU directive on the limitation of VOC emissions from solvent-using industries, which {{as an alternative to}} a command-and-control approach explicitly allows the use of a tradable permit model. The concept came about through a mediation approach: the model was designed by Prognos and B, S, S. Volkswirtschaftliche Beratung in direct co-operation with the German Ministry for the Environment, the Federal Environmental Agency and the paintjob repair shops related trade associations BFL and VdL. The model found is a detailed and very much praxis-oriented approach which offers - compared to traditional environmental law - significant savings: due to our calculations savings of about 11. 000 DM for only four small enterprises are offered by tradable permits in comparison with a command-and-control approach. Finally possibilities to transfer this model to other sectors which are not <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>authorisations</b> were analysed. A transfer can be recommended for the sectors: machinery manufacturing, large vehicle manufacturing, electrical/electronics products, iron, tin and metal processing as well as the wood and furniture industry.

50|$|HBCD's {{toxicity}} and its harm to {{the environment}} are currently discussed. HBCD can be found in environmental samples such as birds, mammals, fish and other aquatic organisms as well as soil and sediment.On this basis, on 28 October 2008 the European Chemicals Agency decided to include HBCD in the SVHC list, Substances of Very High Concern, within the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals framework. On 18 February 2011, HBCD was listed in the Annex XIV of REACH and hence is <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>Authorisation.</b> HBCD can be used until the so-called “sunset date” (21 August 2015). After that date, only authorised applications will be allowed in the EU. HBCD has been found widely present in biological samples from remote areas and supporting evidences for its classification as Persistent, Bioaccumulative and Toxic (PBT) and undergoes long-range environmental transportation.In July 2012, an EU harmonised classification and labelling for HBCD entered into force. HBCD has been classified as a category 2 for reproductive toxicity. Since August 2010 hexabromocyclododecanes are included in the EPA's List of Chemicals of Concern.On May 2013 the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) decided to include HBCD in the Convention’s Annex A for elimination, with specific exemptions for expanded and extruded polystyrene in buildings needed to give countries time to phase-in safer substitutes. HBCD is listed for elimination, but with a specific exemption for expanded polystyrene (EPS) and extruded polystyrene (XPS) in buildings. Countries may choose to use this exemption for up to five years after the request for exemption is submitted. Japan was the first country to implement a ban on the import and production of HBCD effective in May 2014.|$|E

50|$|While the Economic Council was {{a decisive}} {{platform}} for the political debate and factual implementation of any emerging economic concept, the parliament’s resolutions and acts remained <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> the <b>authorisation</b> by the Allied Zwei-Zonen-Amt (Bipartite Board) in Berlin and were controlled by the so-called ‘Zweizonenkontrollamt’ (Bipartite Control Office) (BICO) in Frankfurt. Foreign trade and monetary transactions were {{carried out by the}} Allied Joint Export-Import Agency (JEIA). Due {{to the fact that the}} Economic Council was restricted in its legislative scope and also not a representative assembly elected by the plebiscite, the bizonal institution was often ill-regarded as quasi-parliament. Nevertheless, this first German parliament after World War II was a central prerequisite for Germany’s political and economic reconstruction and marked an important step towards German political and economic self-determination. Henceforth, German political parties were given the opportunity actively to conduct an economic policy and to affect the definition of an emerging economic model for post-war West Germany.|$|R
30|$|For {{substances}} {{with certain}} properties {{of very high}} concern (SVHC), the REACH Regulation gives the option of inclusion in the candidate list and possibly in Annex XIV (list of substances <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>authorisation).</b> This brings information requirements for manufacturers, importers and suppliers of articles. Furthermore, an application for authorisation must be made for substances listed in Annex XIV of the REACH regulation [8]. After a transitional period, substances included in this list can be used only for expressly authorised uses for limited time spans.|$|E
30|$|A SVHC {{will become}} <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>authorisation</b> by {{inclusion}} into Annex XIV of the Regulation. Responsible {{for the decision}} on inclusion in Annex XIV is the REACH committee of the European Commission. In advance of this decision, ECHA is requested to recommend which substances of the candidate list {{should be included in}} Annex XIV with high priority. Once included in Annex XIV, production and use of the substance in the EU is limited by a sunset date. From this date on, every single use needs to be assessed by ECHA and authorised by the European Commission for a limited period on request of manufactures or users.|$|E
30|$|The {{stability}} of legal requirements is another basic prerequisite for a workable and efficient implementation. This applies {{in particular to}} the REACH Regulation which entered into force more than 5 years ago in 2007 and whose implementation has really begun only just now. The practical impacts of the REACH implementation in the first registration phases are gradually starting to penetrate the supply chains. First substances are <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>authorisation.</b> The necessary implementation aids, tools and guidance documents have been newly developed; {{some of them are}} still being completed and have to prove their worth in practice. Now, more small and medium-sized enterprises need to submit registrations to the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) by mid- 2018, respectively.|$|E
50|$|Human {{rights and}} {{democracy}} are internationally recognised as interdependent {{and provide a}} framework for assessing the extent to which democratic rights are respected in law and practice. According to this framework, there are two key democratic principles. The principle of popular control is the right to a controlling influence over public decisions and decision-makers. The principle of political equality is the right to be treated with equal respect and as of equal worth in the context of such decisions. Recognition of the above principles requires a framework for guaranteed citizens' rights, a system of representative and accountable political institutions <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> popular <b>authorisation,</b> and active channeling of popular opinion and engagement with government by the people. Under this model, New Zealand recognises the political rights of its citizens in both law and practice. It does so by way of the Human Rights Commission, which provides a framework within the legal and political system; the ability to communicate and participate in the political system, and processes such as judicial review and complaints to the Office of the Ombudsman hold government and governmental departments accountable where necessary in order to maintain political rights.|$|R
25|$|After the {{nomination}} of the new High Commissioner Sir John Chancellor to succeed Lord Plumer in December 1928, the question was re-examined, and in February 1929 legal opinion established that the mandatory authority was within its powers to intervene to ensure Jewish rights of access and prayer. Al-Husseini pressed him for a specific clarification of the legal status quo regarding the Wall. Chancellor mulled weakening the SMC and undermining al-Husseini's authority by making the office of mufti elective. The Nabi Musa festival of April that year passed without incident, despite al-Husseini's warnings of possible incidents. Chancellor thought his power was waning, and after conferring with London, admitted to al-Husseini on 6 May that he was impotent to act decisively in the matter. Al-Husseini replied that, unless the Mandatory authorities acted, then, very much like Christian monks protecting their sacred sites in Jerusalem, the sheikhs {{would have to take}} infringements of the status quo into their own hands, and personally remove any objects introduced by Jews to the area. Chancellor asked him to be patient, and al-Husseini offered to stop works on the Mount on condition that this gesture not be taken as a recognition of Jewish rights. A change of government in Britain in June led to a new proposal: only Muslim works in the sector near where Jews prayed should be <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> mandatory authorisation: Jews could employ ritual objects, but the introduction of seats and screens would be <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> Muslim <b>authorisation.</b> Chancellor authorised the Muslims to recommence their reconstructive work, while, responding to further Zionist complaints, prevailed on the SMC to stop the raucous Zikr ceremonies {{in the vicinity of the}} wall. He also asked the Zionist representatives to refrain from filling their newspapers with attacks on the government and Muslim authorities. Chancellor then departed for Europe where the Mandatory Commission was deliberating.|$|R
40|$|Hospitals {{and care}} homes are {{making use of}} new {{measures}} designed to protect people unable to give consent for their care. The Mental Capacity Act Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards were introduced by law on 1 April 2009 to provide a legal framework for depriving someone of their liberty where {{they are unable to}} give informed consent regarding their care. The statistics presented here provide the first official information about <b>authorisations</b> <b>to</b> legally detain a person using the legislation. The safeguards apply to people aged 18 and above who suffer from a mental disorder of the mind (such as dementia or a profound learning disability) and who lack capacity to give consent to the arrangements made for their care and / or treatment. The safeguards cover people in all hospitals and care homes in the statutory, independent and voluntary sectors. A rigorous, standardised assessment and authorisation process is used to ensure only appropriate use is made of the safeguards. Key facts?The number of authorisation requests were: 1, 772 in quarter 1 1, 681 in quarter 2 and, 1, 869 in quarter 3. ?Of the total assessments completed in each quarter, a higher proportion were for females than for males ?For each quarter, around three out of four assessments were made by local authorities while the remaining ones were made by primary care trusts. ?The percentage of <b>authorisations</b> granted leading <b>to</b> someone being deprived of their liberty varied between 33. 5 per cent and 50. 7 per cent across quarters 1 to 3. ?At 31 December 2009 1, 074 people were <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> such <b>authorisations.</b> Quarterly analysis of Mental Capacity Act 2005, Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards Assessments (England) Quarter 1 (0. 31 MB) Quarterly analysis of Mental Capacity Act 2005, Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards Assessments (England) Quarter 2 (0. 31 MB) Quarterly analysis of Mental Capacity Act 2005, Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards Assessments (England) Quarter 3 (0. 31 MB) Have your say - give us your comments on this publication�...|$|R
30|$|Moreover, the {{candidate}} list and the authorisation procedure stir great uncertainty among companies {{that use the}} listed substances in industrial processes and syntheses. This applies, e.g. for solvents or catalysts. According to the competent authorities, the latter substances are no longer deemed intermediates {{so that they can}} become <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>authorisation.</b> Next, the concerned companies need to apply for authorisation, which involves much cost and work and an uncertain outcome. Failure to obtain authorisation for the catalyst or the solvent for just one out of several synthesis steps, e.g. in active substance synthesis for a pharmaceutical, would cause the entire synthesis process to collapse. Even if an authorisation is granted, it can be withdrawn at any time after having been reviewed.|$|E
30|$|ECHA and Member States {{authorities}} learned {{an important}} lesson while proposing SVHC {{for inclusion in the}} candidate list, and in Annex XIV for authorisation. The experience revealed that authorisation is not always the appropriate measure to reduce and to control the risks of SVHC. Authorisation is focusing on the use of a substance and on placing on the market for a certain use. Especially for SVHC released into the environment as constituents or residues in articles, authorisation is not helpful to reduce emissions, because articles are not <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>authorisation.</b> In addition, authorisation is not appropriate to introduce maximum residue levels for substances of very high concern in articles. The need to minimise the levels of SVHC in articles might especially be considered for imported articles. Hence, for certain SVHC, a restriction might be a better alternative to control the risks adequately.|$|E

By drawing on the notion of throughput legitimacy, this article argues that decision making processes in the authorisation procedure are characterized by insufficient legitimacy...|$|E
