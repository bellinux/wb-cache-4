25|$|Over sixty {{species of}} fish, {{invertebrates}} and seaweed are commercially cultivated by aquaculture or fish farming in Russia. Aquaculture is based mainly on buffalo, grass and <b>silver</b> <b>carp,</b> rainbow trout, scallops, mussels and laminaria. In 2007 there were 300 aquaculture enterprises.|$|E
25|$|Wildlife in {{the lake}} mostly {{consists}} of the fish species which were introduced since the 1950s. The most common fish {{in the lake}} are the introduced <b>silver</b> <b>carp</b> and grass carp, but large autochthonous wels catfish, weighting over , can also be found, causing concern among the swimmers so the authorities issued a statement that they are harmless.|$|E
25|$|Some {{fish and}} {{amphibians}} {{found in the}} Sundarbans are sawfish, butter fish, electric ray, common carp, <b>silver</b> <b>carp,</b> barb, river eels, starfish, king crab, fiddler crab, hermit crab, prawn, shrimps, Gangetic dolphins, skipping frogs, common toads and tree frogs. One particularly interesting fish is the mudskipper, a gobioid that {{climbs out of the}} water into mudflats and even climbs trees.|$|E
50|$|Residents {{around the}} lake rely on income from fishpens and fishcages that grow cultured tilapia and <b>silver</b> <b>carps.</b>|$|R
50|$|Fishery {{products}} are {{mostly in the}} irrigated ponds {{with a lot of}} grass <b>carps,</b> <b>silver</b> <b>carps,</b> carps, tilapia etc. The fishing port also is the biggest one in Taoyuan County with the capacity of accommodating 50 ships in the interior part and 100 ships in the exterior part. Main fish species including pomfrets, sharks and mullets.|$|R
50|$|Fishes {{present in}} the lake include smelt, pike, roach, rudd, tench, bleak, <b>silver</b> bream, <b>carp</b> bream, crucian carp, burbot, perch, zander, and ruffe. Signal {{crayfish}} were introduced in the 1970s.|$|R
25|$|Some cyprinids, such as {{the grass}} carp, are {{specialized}} herbivores; others, {{such as the}} common nase, eat algae and biofilms, while others, such as the black carp, specialize in snails, and some, such as the <b>silver</b> <b>carp,</b> are specialized filter feeders. For this reason, cyprinids are often introduced as a management tool to control various factors in the aquatic environment, such as aquatic vegetation and diseases transmitted by snails.|$|E
25|$|While {{many fish}} species {{native to the}} Yangtze are seriously threatened, others have become {{important}} in fish farming and introduced widely outside their native range. A total of 26 native fish species of the Yangtze basin are farmed. Among the most important are four Asian carp: grass carp, black carp, <b>silver</b> <b>carp</b> and bighead carp. Other species that support important fisheries include northern snakehead, Chinese perch, Takifugu pufferfish (mainly in the lowermost sections) and predatory carp.|$|E
2500|$|Carp are {{a commercially}} {{important}} species, particularly <b>silver</b> <b>carp,</b> bighead carp, black carp, grass carp, [...] common carp and crucian carp. Other commercially important species are bream, reeves shad, eel, cat fish, rainbow trout, salmon, whitebait, mullet, Siniperca chuatsi, perch, sturgeon, murrel and pangolin. Commercial shellfish include freshwater shrimp and river crabs, molluscs include freshwater mussels, clams and freshwater snails. Aquatic plants are also harvested: lotus, water chestnut and the gorgon nut Euryale ferox. Other commercial species include the soft-shell turtle and the frog.|$|E
40|$|<b>Silver</b> crucian <b>carp</b> Carassius auratus langsdorfii {{comprises}} a diploid-polyploid {{complex in}} wild Japanese populations. Bisexually reproducing diploids are sympatrically distributed with gynogenetically developing triploids and tetraploids. Triploid and tetraploid males are very rare among Japanese <b>silver</b> crucian <b>carp</b> {{due to their}} gynogenetic reproduction. We examined the genetic characteristics of progeny that arose in a tank by natural spawning of a tetraploid <b>silver</b> crucian <b>carp</b> pair. The ploidy status of 120 samples randomly collected from these progeny {{was determined to be}} tetraploid by DNA content flow cytometry. DNA fingerprints from a random amplified polymorphic DNA assay indicated that almost all the progeny examined had genotypes identical to the maternal tetraploid female with no paternally derived fragments. Selected specimens’ cytogenetic analyses revealed that the progeny examined had tetraploid chromosome numbers, categorized into 40 metacentric, 80 submetacentric, and 80 subtelocentric or telocentric chromosomes, which were arranged into quartets and six supernumerary microchromosomes. Fluorescence in situ hybridization signals were detected in four homologous chromosomes in all analyzed metaphases prepared from diploid goldfish specimens. Contrary, tetraploid <b>silver</b> crucian <b>carp</b> gave eight rDNA signals. These results suggest that gynogenetic development in eggs spawned by tetraploid females should be triggered by tetraploid males’ homospecific sperm. 四倍体ギンブナ雌雄の自然産卵により得た子孫のDNA 量を調べたところ、全個体が四倍体であった。さらにRAPD-PCR 法により分析したところ、子孫と母親の間で電気泳動像は一例を除き同一で、かつ父親の遺伝的影響は認められなかった。子孫は染色体数 4 n= 206 、核型 40 M+ 80 SM+ 80 ST/T+ 6 m(微小染色体) を示し、 5. 8 S+ 28 SrDNA をプローブとしたFISH では、二倍体キンギョの 4 シグナルに対して 8 シグナルを示した。以上の結果は、四倍体の精子によっても、四倍体の卵の雌性発生が生じ、子孫は四倍体クローンとなったことを示す...|$|R
50|$|The Prussian <b>carp,</b> <b>silver</b> Prussian <b>carp</b> or Gibel carp (Carassius gibelio), is {{a member}} of the family Cyprinidae, which {{includes}} many other fish, such as the common carp, and the smaller minnows. It is a medium-sized cyprinid, and does not exceed a weight of 6.6 pounds (3 kg) and a size of 45 cm. They are usually silver, although other color variations exist. They are omnivorous and feed on plankton, invertebrates, plant material and detritus. Originally from Asia (Siberia), they have been introduced to and are now inhabiting lakes, ponds, and slow-moving rivers throughout Europe, North America, and Asia.|$|R
50|$|Naturally {{occurring}} fishes are melt, northern pike, roach, rudd, tench, bleak, <b>silver</b> bream, <b>carp</b> bream, eel, burbot, perch, zander, and ruffe.

2500|$|The commercially {{important}} {{marine species}} are bigeye, golden thread, croaker, horse-head and pomfret. The total capture fisheries and marine fish culture production {{is equivalent to}} about 31% of seafood consumed in Hong Kong, while pond fish farmers produce about 6% of the freshwater fish eaten. [...] The majority of fish farms in New Territories are engaged in carp polyculture (bighead carp, <b>silver</b> <b>carp,</b> common carp and grass carp) in combination with tilapia or grey mullet as the major species. Other cultured species include seabreams and spotted scat. At present there are 26 fish culture zones designated under the [...] "Marine Fish Culture Ordinance". Common species cultured include green grouper, brownspotted grouper, Russell's snapper, mangrove snapper, cobia and pompano. [...] The voluntary [...] "Accredited Fish Farm Scheme" [...] has been launched to assist local fish farmers.|$|E
2500|$|St. Anthony Falls was {{the upper}} limit of {{commercial}} navigation on the Mississippi until two dams {{and a series of}} locks were built between 1948 and 1963 by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The locks made commercial navigation possible above Minneapolis but, since the locks in Minneapolis are smaller than most of the locks {{on the rest of the}} river, the practical limit for many commercial tows is further downriver. [...] A smaller number of barges go to Minneapolis. At midnight on June 9, 2015, the Upper St. Anthony Falls lock was permanently closed by Section 2010 of “H.R.3080 - Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014” which was signed into law by President Barack Obama on June 10, 2014, and was required to be implemented [...] "Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment" [...] The closure is intended to stop the spread of invasive species namely two types of Asian carp: bighead carp and <b>silver</b> <b>carp.</b> Minneapolis is once again the site of the head of navigation of the river.|$|E
2500|$|The Chicago River {{has been}} highly {{affected}} by industrial and residential development with attendant {{changes to the}} quality of the water and riverbanks. Several species of freshwater fish are known to inhabit the river, including largemouth and smallmouth bass, rock bass, crappie, bluegill, catfish, and carp. The river also has a large population of crayfish. The South Fork of the Main (South) Branch, which was the primary sewer for the Union Stock Yards and the meat packing industry, was once so polluted that it became known as Bubbly Creek. Illinois has issued advisories regarding eating fish from the river due to PCB and mercury contamination, including a [...] "do not eat" [...] advisory for carp more than 12inches long. There are concerns that <b>silver</b> <b>carp</b> and bighead carp, now invasive species in the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers, may reach the Great Lakes through the Chicago River. Despite the pollution concerns, the Chicago River remains a very popular target for freshwater recreational fishing. In 2006, the Chicago Park District started the annual [...] "Mayor Daley's Chicago River Fishing Festival", which has increased in popularity with each year.|$|E
40|$|In {{tropical}} {{countries like}} India, climatic conditions vary in different parts, {{as a result}} the breeding of fast growing species such as Catla and <b>silver</b> <b>carps</b> poses considerable problems due to erratic or late monsoon or prolonged dry spell. Hence {{it is not possible to}} meet the fish seed requirement of the country. Therefore: to meet the future requirement and to over-come the environmental conditions a Modern carp Hatchery CIFE D- 81 was designed. The system provides optimum temperature, silt free clean, cool, highly oxygenated water, low current and continuous removal of metabolites. It has been successfully demonstrated at Rawatbhata (Rajasthan), Badkhal (Haryana), Badbhada (M. P), Guntur and East Godavari District (A. P). Recently a Modern Carp Hatchery was installed in a semi-arid zone, Damdama (Haryana), during 1984, where it has produced record 1. 88 crores of fish seed and worked successfully...|$|R

50|$|The largescale <b>silver</b> <b>carp</b> {{is closely}} related to the <b>silver</b> <b>carp,</b> but its native range is to the south of that of the <b>silver</b> <b>carp,</b> mostly within Vietnam. Unlike bighead and <b>silver</b> <b>carp,</b> largescale <b>silver</b> <b>carp</b> have not been widely {{introduced}} around the world for use in aquaculture, although at least one introduction was made to some waters of the Soviet Union, where they hybridized with the introduced <b>silver</b> <b>carp.</b>|$|E
50|$|Two {{other species}} {{are in the}} genus Hypophthalmichthys, the bighead carp (H. nobilis) and the largescale <b>silver</b> <b>carp</b> (H. harmandi). The genus name Aristichthys has also {{sometimes}} been used for bighead carp, but is deprecated. The bighead carp differs from the <b>silver</b> <b>carp</b> in its behavior (it does not leap from the water when startled) and also in its diet. Bighead carp are also filter feeders, but they filter larger particles than <b>silver</b> <b>carp</b> and in general consume {{a greater proportion of}} zooplankton in their diets than <b>silver</b> <b>carp,</b> which consume more phytoplankton. In at least some parts of the United States, bighead and <b>silver</b> <b>carp</b> hybridize in the wild and produce fertile offspring.|$|E
50|$|The <b>silver</b> <b>carp</b> (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) is {{a species}} of {{freshwater}} cyprinid fish, a variety of Asian carp native to China and eastern Siberia.

50|$|The <b>silver</b> <b>carp</b> is {{sometimes}} called the flying carp for its tendency to leap from the water when startled; it can leap up to 10 ft into the air. Boaters traveling in uncovered high-speed watercraft {{have been reported to}} be injured by running into the fish while at speed. A leaping <b>silver</b> <b>carp</b> broke the jaw of a teenager being pulled on an inner tube, and water skiing in areas where <b>silver</b> <b>carp</b> are present is extremely dangerous.|$|E

50|$|<b>Silver</b> <b>carp,</b> {{with the}} closely related bighead carp, often reach {{extremely}} high population densities, and {{are thought to}} have undesirable effects on the environment and native species. They have spread into the Mississippi, Illinois, Ohio, and Missouri Rivers and many of their tributaries in the United States and are abundant in the Mississippi River watershed from Louisiana to South Dakota and Illinois. Navigation dams seem to have slowed their advance up the Mississippi River, and until late November 2008, <b>silver</b> <b>carp</b> had not been captured north of central Iowa on the Mississippi. Dams that do not have navigation locks are complete barriers to upstream natural movement of <b>silver</b> <b>carp,</b> unless fishermen unintentionally assist this movement by the use of <b>silver</b> <b>carp</b> as bait.|$|E
