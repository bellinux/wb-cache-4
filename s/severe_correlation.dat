40|$|The {{paper is}} devoted to {{improvements}} in technology of electrohydraulic impact forming (EHF) via investigation of stability of high-voltage underwater discharges and pressure fields they generate along surface of a sheet blank. The experimental research is held with use of conical discharge chamber equipped with one pair of electrodes. Measurements of pressure fields along round flat area are based on application of multi-point membrane pressure gauge (MPG). The tests conditions include wide range of spark gaps with four levels of charge voltage and energy. The investigation results showed strong influence of geometric parameters of discharge work volume and electric parameters of discharge circuit on repeatability of pressure fields. The spark gap value should be in <b>severe</b> <b>correlation</b> with distance to a sheet blank and dimensions of a loaded area. Parameter “normalised spark gap” is proposed for determination of geometric characteristics of discharge volume. The results confirm the validity of charge voltage-to-spark gap ratio of 1 kV/mm recommended for approximate setting the gap {{in order to ensure}} high pressure generation. This ratio is also good for repeatability of pressure fields and can be also expended. The factors that influence the stability of discharge parameters, shock wave generation and pressure fields are analysed...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationship between five neurocognitive domains, including memory, visual-spatial skills, executive functioning, language, and attention, and three instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), (financial management, medication management, and driving), as well as three basic activities of daily living (ADLs), including dressing, feeding, and grooming. Subjects were community dwelling older adults diagnosed with Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s Disease (AD) ranging in severity from mild to <b>severe.</b> <b>Correlation</b> and regression models were used to analyze the relationship between neurocognitive domains and self-care activities. All of the neurocognitive domains were significantly but mildly correlated with declines in IADLs, and all of the neurocognitive domains, except memory, were significantly but mildly correlated with ADL decline. None of the regression models, except driving, produced significant results. The hypotheses were {{based on the belief that}} overlap occurs between declines in cognitive domains and self-care skills. The results of this study support the assertion that global cognitive decline occurs followed by declines in IADLs and later declines in ADLs. Thus, instead of specific neurocognitive domains predicting decline in individual self-care skills, this research indicates that the degree of severity of cognitive decline is predictive of impairments in IADLs or ADLs with milder global impairment predicting IADLs and more pronounced decline predicting declines in ADLs. Degree of severity may have been more predictive because while individuals vary in cognitive symptom presentation, the course of AD always progresses from mild to more severe. The role of over-learning also potentially impacted the results of the study. Individuals learn and daily practice ADLs at a young age causing them to require less higher level cognitive skills (over-learned). Since over-learned IADLs require less higher level cognition, they were preserved longer in AD course, thus declining after global cognitive impairment. Clinicians need to thoroughly assess the degree to which an individual has over-learned a task in order to make the most accurate recommendations. If an individual has milder global decline, IADLs are likely to be impaired, and if an individual has moderate global decline with memory reaching a floor, ADLs are likely to be impaired...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} the problem of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) spatial {{multiplexing}} (SM) systems in the presence of antenna fading correlation. It is well known that <b>severe</b> spatial <b>correlations</b> present at the transmitter and/or receiver can significantly compromise the performance of existing SM systems. Recent results showed that joint-over-antenna (JA) iterative detection schemes can improve the performance of SM systems in correlated channels as compared to schemes that detected the signals on an antenna-by-antenna basis. We extend this idea in this paper by incorporating a so-called antenna doping (AD) scheme into the SM system, in order to further counteract the detrimental effects of spatial correlation. Through simulations, we show that AD can improve the performance by 3 - 4 dB in <b>severe</b> spatial <b>correlation</b> as compared to non-doping systems. This improvement is explained with the aid of extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) charts, which illustrate the convergence behavior of the JA iterative detection with and without AD...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe Bayesian {{approach}} has been suggested as a suitable method {{in the context of}} mechanistic pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) modeling, as it allows for efficient use of both data and prior knowledge regarding the drug or disease state. However, to this day, published examples of its application to real PK-PD problems have been scarce. We present an example of a fully Bayesian re-analysis of a previously published mechanistic model describing the time course of circulating neutrophils in stroke patients and healthy individuals. While priors could be established for all population parameters in the model, not all variability terms were known with any degree of precision. A sensitivity analysis around the assigned priors used was performed by testing three different sets of prior values for the population variance terms for which no data were available in the literature: "informative", "semi-informative", and "noninformative", respectively. For all variability terms, inverse gamma distributions were used. It was possible to fit the model to the data using the " informative" priors. However, when the " semi-informative" and "noninformative" priors were used, it was impossible to accomplish convergence due to <b>severe</b> <b>correlations</b> between parameters. In addition, due to the complexity of the model, the process of de. ning priors and running the Markov chains was very time-consuming. We conclude that the present analysis represents a first example of the fully transparent application of Bayesian methods to a complex, mechanistic PK-PD problem with real data. The approach is time-consuming, but enables us to make use of all available information from data and scientific evidence. Thereby, it shows potential both for detection of data gaps and for more reliable predictions of various outcomes and "what if" scenarios...|$|R

40|$|Background The {{prevalence}} of thrombocytopenia in neonates ranges from 22 to 35 %, {{and one of}} the most feared complica­tions is intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH). Previous research in Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital (CMH), Jakarta reported a high incidence of IVH (43. 47 %) in infants with a gestational age of 2). Thrombocyte counts were recorded on the same day as the diagnosis of IVH. Results The risk of severe IVH was 28. 2 % in neonates with thrombocyte counts < 100, 000 /uL, and 10. 4 % in neonates without thrombocytopenia (P= 0. 014). Multivariate analysis revealed that gestational age < 32 weeks and the use of respira­tory support (ventilator and high frequency oscillatory ventila­tion) had significant associations with severe IVH. However, multivariate analysis did not show a significant relationship between thrombocytopenia and <b>severe</b> IVH (<b>correlation</b> coef­ficient = 0. 21).

40|$|SummaryAlthough {{osteoarthritis}} (OA) is {{the most}} common cause of articular skeletal disability in humans, assessing progression (staging) with noninvasive methods remains a major clinical problem. Using the rhesus macaque animal model, the objective of this study was to compare OA staging by noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) against gross pathology and histopathology. Right knee joints from 18 rhesus macaques were used in this study. Using a four-point ordinal scale for each of the above-mentioned modalities, the lateral and medial femoral condyle and tibial plateau of each knee joint was independently scored for OA severity, i. e. normal, mild OA, moderate OA and <b>severe</b> OA. <b>Correlation</b> between each staging system was performed using Stuart's Tau-c correlation coefficient. By our criteria, MRI staging correlated as well with gross pathology (τ = 0. 75) and histopathology (τ = 0. 80) as did gross pathology with histopathology (τ = 0. 78). Our study shows that MRI is a promising noninvasive modality to evaluate the severity of OA. MRI appears to be sensitive for demarcating the presence and extent of focal OA cartilage lesions. However, at this time, while MRI is sensitive for detecting OA change it cannot distinguish between certain lesions such as superficial cartilage matrix fibrillation and hypertrophy both of which show elevated signal intensity...|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} we address two {{problems}} in computational chemistry relevant to biomolecular modeling. In the first project, {{we consider the}} conformer space of melatonin as a a representative example of “real-life” flexible biomolecules. Geometries for all 52 unique conformers are optimized using spin-component scaled MP 2, and then relative energies are obtained at the CCSD (T) level near the complete basis set limit. These are then used to validate a variety of DFT methods with and without empirical dispersion corrections, {{as well as some}} lower-level ab initio methods. Basis set convergence is found to be relatively slow due to internal C-H…O and C-H…N contacts. Absent dispersion corrections, many DFT functionals will transpose the two lowest conformers. Dispersion corrections resolve the problem for most functionals. Double hybrids yield particularly good performance, as does MP 2. 5. In the second project, we propose a simple DFT-based diagnostic for nondynamical correlation effects. Aλ= (1 -TAE [ΧλC]/TAE[XC]) /λ where TAE is the total atomization energy, XC the “pure” DFT exchange-correlation functional, and ΧλC the corresponding hybrid with 100 λ% HF-type exchange. The diagnostic is a good predictor for sensitivity of energetics to the level of theory, unlike most of the wavefunction-based diagnostics. For GGA functionals, Aλ values approaching unity indicate <b>severe</b> non-dynamical <b>correlation.</b> The diagnostic is only weakly sensitive to the basis set (beyond polarized double zeta) and can be applied to problems beyond practical reach of wavefunction ab-initio methods required for other diagnostics...|$|R

Subvolumes of severe ischemia relative to total ischemic area were significantly larger in the malignant group than in the benign group and were significantly correlated with edema formation. The highest correlation and best predictive values for edema formation with a sensitivity, specificity, and a positive and negative predictive value of 100 % were found for subvolumes with <b>severe</b> ischemia. <b>Correlation</b> coefficients and prediction decreased for subvolumes with less severe perfusional deficit, pointing to the risk of misclassifying patients when relying on the volume of total perfusional deficit alone.

There is a need to understand the relative contribution of respiratory impairment, physical disability, coping, age, and socioeconomic variables on HRQL. METHODS: Patients with COPD were recruited on admission to a pulmonary rehabilitation centre. Respiratory impairment was assessed by lung function tests and physical disability was evaluated by a 12 minute walking test. HRQL was assessed by means of the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) measuring "symptoms", "activity", and "impact". Because the SGRQ does not include a measure of "well being", this was taken from the medical psychological questionnaire for lung diseases. The COPD coping questionnaire and a questionnaire covering basic socioeconomic variables were also used. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty six patients of mean (SD) age 65 (9) years and mean (SD) forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) 39 (9) % predicted were included. The scores on the SGRQ indicated <b>severe</b> impairment. <b>Correlations</b> were found between lung function parameters, 12 minute walking test, and the HRQL "activity" and "impact" components. Coping strategies were correlated with the "activity", "impact", and "well being" components. No correlations were found between age, socioeconomic variables, and HRQL.

Furthermore, dynamic scaling factors derived from the despreader weights are used for interference cancellation process. This method applied on each subcarrier is followed by maximum ratio or equal gain combining to fully exploit the frequency diversity inherent in the multicarrier CDMA systems. It is shown that this way of MAI estimation on individual subcarrier provides significantly improved performance for a MC DS-CDMA system compared to that with conventional matched filter (MF) and SIC techniques at a little added complexity. Performance evaluation under <b>severe</b> nearfar, fading <b>correlation</b> and system loading conditions are carried out to affirm the gain of the proposed adaptive receiver design approach. ...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), School of Mechanical and Materials Engineering, Washington State UniversityAccurate {{prediction}} of evaporative losses from light water reactor {{nuclear power plant}} (NPP) spent fuel storage pools (SFPs) is important for activities ranging from sizing of water makeup systems during NPP design to predicting the time available to supply emergency makeup water following <b>severe</b> accidents. Existing <b>correlations</b> for predicting evaporation from water surfaces are only optimized for conditions typical of swimming pools. This new approach modeling evaporation as a diffusion process has yielded an evaporation rate model that provided a better fit of published high temperature evaporation data and measurements from two SFPs than other published evaporation correlations. Insights from treating evaporation as a diffusion process include correcting {{for the effects of}} air flow and solutes on evaporation rate. An accurate modeling of the effects of air flow on evaporation rate is required to explain the observed temperature data from the Fukushima Daiichi Unit 4 SFP during the 2011 loss of cooling event; the diffusion model of evaporation provides a significantly better fit to this data than existing evaporation models.

40|$|Metalloproteinase- 3 (MMP- 3) {{plays a role}} in the {{destruction}} of the cartilage matrix in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In this study, MMP- 3 serum levels in patients with RA and osteoarthritis (OA) were measured by immunoassay, and comparisons were made between patients with early RA and patients with progressive RA and OA. In addition, correlations between serum MMP- 3 levels and classical clinical parameters and other molecular indexes that indicate the disease activity of RA, were investigated. Furthermore, trends in the concentrations of molecular indexes were analyzed and the changes in MMP- 3 concentrations were observed over a period of one year. MMP- 3 serum levels were significantly higher in early and progressive RA than in OA. Elevated MMP- 3 serum levels seem to appear during the early stage of RA when joint destruction is not yet <b>severe.</b> Significant <b>correlations</b> were found between MMP- 3 levels and many clinical parameters that indicate inflammation (TIMP- 1, HA, plt, ESR, CRP, Fe, TIBC, Ferrit, ALP, WBC, joint score) in patints with early RA. CRP, Fe, HA and ICTP levels correlated positively with MMP- 3 levels in progressive RA, though the number of parameters that correlate with MMP- 3 levels decreased. Changes in MMP- 3 levels over the course of one year were similar to those of CRP in most cases. However, some cases with progressive RA showed a wider variation, and their MMP- 3 levels did not correlate with CRP. HA, ICTP and TIMP- 1 concentrations showed similar tendencies to that of MMP- 3 in patients with RA. Our studies suggest that changes in MMP- 3 serum levels reflect both joint inflammation and joint destruction and {{can be used as a}} marker for both conditions. Monitoring of MMP- 3 levels may be useful for early and differential diagnoses and the assessment of present joint activity as well as the patient 2 ̆ 7 s response to treatment, especially during early stage of the disease. MMP- 3 levels may also be useful in predicting the degree of joint destruction, especially in progressive RA...|$|R
