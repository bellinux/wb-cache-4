The data were collected through documentary sources, questionnaires, and observation and it was analyzed using SPSS. The findings revealed that the emerging <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>finance</b> in Tanzania are not sustainable and suitable to SSEs. The findings identified factors that lead to un-sustainability and unsuitability <b>of</b> these <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>finance</b> as being attributed to the difficult conditions imposed by the <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>finance,</b> high interest rates, and small loan amount provided to SSEs, short grace period and short loan repayment time.

25|$|The {{powers of}} the {{legislature}} are checked {{by a number of}} devices: first, by certain constitutional limitations; second, by the president as defined under the constitution; and third, by the Constitutional Court. Articles 64, 131, and 132 of the constitution circumscribe the ability of the Seimas to control the Government, especially the budget. Article 64 specifies the times of parliamentary sessions. Although extension is possible, ordinarily the legislature cannot sit longer than seven months and three days, divided into two sessions. The budget submitted by the Government can be increased by the legislature only if the latter indicates the <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>financing</b> for additional expenditures. If the budget is not approved {{before the start of the}} budget year, proposed expenditures cannot be higher than those of the previous year. Finally, the legislature is not entrusted with making decisions concerning the basic characteristics of Lithuanian statehood and democracy. These are left to the citizens by means of referendum. Similarly, the initiative for making laws is not limited to the legislature but also belongs to the citizens, who can force the legislature to consider a law by submitting a petition with 50,000 signatures.|$|E

Dutch farmers make use <b>of</b> different <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>finance</b> whereby bank loans {{continue to serve}} as the major <b>source</b> <b>of</b> debt <b>financing.</b> The average bank loan was approximately 740, 000 euro per farm in 2015 while equity amounted 1. 8 million euro per farm. Traditional family loans amounted about 60, 000 euro per farm. Recent developments in, and examples <b>of,</b> alternative <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>finance</b> indicate that the diversity will increase in the future, whereby various forms <b>of</b> <b>financing</b> will be used simultaneously. This can also be of interest for mainstream banks since their funding capacity is becoming more restricted as they are required to retain more capital to comply with the Basel Accords. The prospects for crowdfunding in agriculture are promising for projects relating to sales in niche markets. The relative low return on equity in agriculture indicates that private equity or venture capital is often not a viable option...|$|R

[...] Mortgage companies could no longer borrow money to originate mortgages, and many failed in 2007.
