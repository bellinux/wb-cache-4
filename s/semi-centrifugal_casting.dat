The main difference being that the mold is completely filled during the process {{through the use of}} a central sprue.If a central bore is required in the casting, a dry sand core is best suited. [...] This process can be completed using either permanent or, the more popular, sand molds. The rotational symmetry produced by this process make it ideal for objects such rail car wheels and pulleys.|$|E

Based on a literature study of centrifugal casting and centrifugal force, the principle of centrifugal casting is described. Centrifugal casting can be divided according to the position of the axis of rotation to horizontal and vertical or by the method of right centrifugal casting, <b>semi-centrifugal</b> <b>casting,</b> centrifugal casting, or Tekcast method. The most basic and most common centrifugal casting product is a pipe. The pipe production is progressing from material melting, pre-operation machine preparation, casting and solidification of the melt, to adjusting and finishing of the pipe. We can cast centrifugally a several of materials, especially steel, cast iron, copper, zinc, aluminum and titanium. Centrifugal casting can also cast multilayer castings...|$|E
