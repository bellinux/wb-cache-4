The thermorheological properties and the shape of the viscoelastic fingerprint of the samples obtained from the ansa-metallocene catalyst are those featured by linear polymers. The flow activation energy in these materials depends on the amount of comonomer, but the values are much higher than those corresponding to aliphatic copolymers with the same amount of comonomer, likely due to the hindrance effect of the styrene units in flow behavior. The results obtained for the samples polymerized by the constrained geometry catalyst indicate a complex molecular architecture. In fact, the samples show characteristic features like thermorheological complexity, increased values of the flow activation energy, and a bimodal linear viscoelastic fingerprint in the terminal zone.

The analogous Cp and indenyl compounds are generally inaccessible, as are the titanium compounds. The molecular structures of four examples [Cp*MLX 2] (variously M = Zr, Hf; X = Cl, Me) reveal chiral-at-metal structures which persist in solution, according to variable-temperature NMR studies; Delta G(298) (double dagger) for the racemization process {{was found to be}} ca. 75 kJ mol(- 1). Treatment of these compounds with MAO, [Ph 3 C][B(C 6 F 5) (4) ], or [PhNMe 2 H][B(C 6 F 5) (4) ] leads to catalysts for alkene polymerization, the nature of which depends on the cocatalyst chosen. The anilinium salt smoothly produces a single chiral species, [Cp*ZrLMe][B(C 6 F 5) (4) ], detected also by H- 1 NMR spectroscopy, which is a highly active <b>single-site</b> <b>catalyst</b> for polymerization of ethene (and less active for copolymerization of ethene/hexene). The trityl activator produces the same catalyst and at least one other catalytically competent species, as evidenced by NMR spectroscopy and polymer modality. The use of MAO leads to a less well-defined catalyst system. The steric demand of the salicyloxazoline ligand affects the catalyst performance significantly, and computational studies show that access of ethene to either of two inequivalent coordination sites is restricted. This stability of the species [Cp*ZrLMe](+) with respect to addition appears to be the limiting factor for catalytic activity. Catalyst stability is addressed, and the steric and electronic factors affecting this are consistent with a mechanism of catalyst death by salicyloxazoline ligand loss. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{of the few}} known molecular nitrogen-fixing systems, including nitrogenase enzymes, are of much interest but are not fully understood. We recently reported that Fe–N_ 2 complexes of tetradentate P_ 3 ^E ligands (E = B, C) generate catalytic yields of NH_ 3 under an atmosphere of N_ 2 with acid and reductant at low temperatures. Here we show that these Fe catalysts are unexpectedly robust and retain activity after multiple reloadings. Nearly {{an order of magnitude}} improvement in yield of NH_ 3 for each Fe catalyst has been realized (up to 64 equiv of NH_ 3 produced per Fe for P_ 3 ^B and up to 47 equiv for P_ 3 ^C) by increasing acid/reductant loading with highly purified acid. Cyclic voltammetry shows the apparent onset of catalysis at the P_ 3 ^BFe–N_ 2 /P_ 3 ^BFe–N_ 2 – couple and controlled-potential electrolysis of P_ 3 ^BFe^+ at − 45 °C demonstrates that electrolytic N_ 2 reduction to NH_ 3 is feasible.

In situ freeze-quench Mössbauer spectroscopy during turnover reveals an iron–borohydrido–hydride complex as a likely resting state of the P_ 3 ^BFe catalyst system. We postulate that hydrogen-evolving reaction activity may prevent iron hydride formation from poisoning the P_ 3 ^BFe system.

The melting temperatures of these polymers were analyzed, {{and found to}} correspond directly with the mole percent incorporation of comonomer, {{as well as with}} the frequency of stereoerrors in the polymers. Further analysis indicated that rmrr stereoerrors, a result of site epimerization, occur in close proximity to the incorporated comonomers. The MAO-activated fluorenyl/Oct-containing metallocene and CGC catalysts were further utilized to produce syndiotactic samples of poly(1 -butene) (s-PB) and poly(1 - pentene) (s-PPe). The syndiotacticity of the samples was quantified by 13 C NMR and the melting temperatures determined by DSC.

The MAO-activated Oct-CGC was also used to produce polyethylene samples at a variety of polymerization temperatures and pressures. All of the samples were found to contain an unprecedented degree of branching (13 - 65 total branches per 1000 carbon atoms) for an early transition metal <b>single-site</b> <b>catalyst.</b> The branches were found to be almost exclusively of two or greater than five carbon atoms in length, and the levels of the longer branches could be controlled by varying the polymerization conditions.

This MAOactivated catalyst system could be tuned to produce polyethylene samples with 17 - 49 total branches per 1000 carbon atoms. Between 4 and 16 of these branches were found to arise from incorporation of 1 -hexene produced by the chromium oligomerization catalyst. Adjusting the ratios of oligomerization catalyst, polymerization catalyst, and activator was found to allow rational control over the branch content of the polymers.

In chapter 1, an overview is provided on the polyhomologation reaction. The reaction builds linear sp 3 carbon chains one carbon {{at a time}} using an organoborane catalyst. The traditional method is a living polymerization using sulfoxonium ylides under anhydrous conditions. The newly developed aqueous method is a polymerization of sulfoxonium salts in an aqueous base. Chapter 2 develops the synthesis of telechelic polymers including ω-hydroxyacid esters, α,ω-diols and α,ω-diacids using the aqueous polyhomologation reaction with control of chain length and PDI. These polymers were used as macromonomers to produce long-chain aliphatic polyesters. The obtained polyesters have thermal and mechanical properties indistinguishable compared to related materials derived from biomass. Chapter 3 reports the synthesis of a gradient ersatz ethylene–propylene copolymer using the traditional polyhomologation reaction. A new and convenient source of the ethylide monomer was developed for the introduction of methyl branch on the polymer backbone. The gradient copolymer contains a gradual change of methyl branch content along the polymer chain. Chapter 4 focuses on the precise monomer insertion on a carbon chain using a sulfonium benzylide. The polymerization and validation protocols were established to demonstrate the precise insertion. A thermally more stable benzylide needs to be developed to complete this study. In chapter 5, three 9 -borafluorene derivatives are designed and evaluated {{in search of a}} <b>single-site</b> <b>catalyst</b> for the polyhomologation reaction. The catalyst is being developed for the synthesis of the yet unknown polyethylidene. Computational studies indicated a preferred 1, 2 -migration of the sp 3 over sp 2 carbon when an electron-withdrawing group is installed on the aromatic rings at the ortho position to boron. Experimental studies revealed the presence of competing sp 2 carbon migration due to the required high reaction temperature from the high activation energy of 1, 2 -migration. A side reaction produced ethylidene–methylidene copolymers rather than polyethylidene due to the competing decomposition of ethylide.

40|$|Polymerization by {{homogeneous}} single-site catalysts is {{a recent}} and growing area of research. While single-site catalysts are typically not as fast as heterogeneous ones, their major advantage is that the kinetic rate constants may be manipulated through precise changes to the catalyst structure and reaction conditions. Such a process yields tailored polymers not generally available through heterogeneous catalysis. Two breakthroughs are needed in this field {{in order to achieve}} this goal: (i) reliable rate constants must come from experimental data, and (ii) correlations between rate constants and chemical structure must be discovered. At present, the majority of new single-site catalysts are reported without detailed kinetic parameters, in part due to the complexity of simultaneously modeling all polymerization data. The purpose of this body of work is in part to discuss the complex process of kinetic modeling in the context of single-site polymerization in order to promote this activity by other researchers. ^ To this end, kinetic modeling has been performed for a number of <b>single-site</b> <b>catalyst</b> systems. The Group IV amine bisphenolate catalysts studied are all similar in structure except for the metal (Zr or Hf) and the pendant donor arm (THF, pyridine, NMe 2, furan, or SMe). The similar systems were chosen in order to probe how these small changes affect the kinetic rate constants. It was found that the donor arm has a large effect on the rate of chain transfer of the polymer, changing the rate by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude depending on the system. Meanwhile, the metal has a large effect on the propagation rate constant, with the rate constants in Zr faster than those in Hf by an order of magnitude. The temperature dependence of the rate constants was also examined for selected catalysts (Zr metal with THF, NMe 2, and SMe pendants). The key findings were: (i) lower temperatures were discovered to prefer monomer dependent chain transfer while higher temperatures prefer monomer independent chain transfer, and (ii) reactions with sterically bulky active sites have high entropies but low enthalpies of activation, while less sterically hindered active sites have low entropies but high enthalpies of activation. These results allow for the possibility to manipulate the kinetic mechanism and can direct future catalyst and experiment design in order to engineer desired polymer products. ...|$|E

Complexes (eta 6 -C 6 H 5 (CH 2) 3 SCH 3 RuCl 2), (eta 6 -C 6 H 5 (CH 2) 3 N(CH 3) 2 RuCl 2), and [(eta 6 -C 6 H 5 (CH 2) 3 OCH 3 RuCl 2) ] 2 with coordinating oxygen, sulfur, and nitrogen heteroatoms in the tethered arms have been compared for olefin polymerization. Nitrogen and sulfur-containing complexes are active for olefin polymerization while oxygen-containing complex is inactive. The nitrogen-containing complex is 1. 5 -fold more active than the sulfur-containing complex. The polymers obtained are composed of two different fractions, a high molecular weight fraction (55 - 161 kg*mol- 1) and a low molecular weight fraction (276 - 761 g*mol- 1). The polydispersities of both fractions are narrow, indicating a <b>single-site</b> <b>catalyst.</b> DFT calculations were carried out on to determine the migratory insertion barriers. Nitrogen-containing complex was found to have a migratory insertion barrier of the chain propagation of 19. 4 kcal*mol- 1 while sulfur-containing was found to be 21. 8 kcal*mol- 1. Theoretical calculations are in agreement with the experimental polymerization activity results. We hypothesize that a more electron deficient ruthenium complex will be more active. We synthesized Ru(IV) dimethyl complex [Cp*(k 2 -S 2 CNMe 2) RuIVMe 2] that polymerizes ethylene with higher activity. The polymers obtained were linear with high molecular weights (up to 322 kg*mol- 1) and narrow monomodal molecular weight distributions (Mw/Mn= 1. 69 - 2. 50). Pronounced counterion effects were observed: the methylaluminoxane activator gave the highest productivities, whereas HBArF resulted in no activity. These results are further supported by DFT calculations, which indicate a low migratory insertion barrier for chain propagation (9. 8 kcal*mol- 1) but high ethylene uptake energies (15. 6 kcal*mol- 1) ...|$|E
40|$|Alternative {{methods to}} control the {{molecular}} weight and short chain branching distribution of polyethylene were investigated. The ability to produce polyolefins with multimodal microstructural distributions using single catalyst/single reactor set-up is very attractive and could, in principle, be used to produce polyolefin resins with advanced molecular architecture. In this thesis, resins with controlled microstructures were produced, characterized and properties tested {{in order to develop}} a better understanding of polymerization structure-property relationships. Copolymerizations of ethylene and 1 -hexene were carried out with an in-situ supported metallocene catalyst. Copolymers were produced with different alkylaluminum activators and the effect on molecular weight and short chain branching distributions was examined. It was found that different activator types produce polymer with unimodal and narrow molecular weight distributions but with very different short chain branching distributions. Each activator exhibits unique comonomer incorporation characteristics to produce bimodal short chain branching distributions {{with the use of a}} single activator. By using individual and mixed activator systems, it is possible {{to control the}} short chain branching distributions of the resulting copolymers while maintaining narrow molecular weight distributions. To further investigate the capabilities of this in-situ supported catalyst system, an experimental design was carried out to study the effect of polymerization conditions on the catalyst activity and microstructure of poly(ethylene-co- 1 -octene). The parameters investigated were: polymerization temperature, monomer pressure, chain transfer to hydrogen, comonomer/ethylene feed ratio and concentration of alkylaluminum. The effect of each parameter on the catalyst activity, comonomer incorporation and molecular weight distribution was investigated. The results obtained were not typical of a conventional <b>single-site</b> <b>catalyst.</b> The copolymerization system was sensitive to all of the parameters and many interactions were evident. The most prominent effect was the catalyst response to temperature. As the temperature was decreased, the short chain branching distributions of the copolymers became broad and bimodal. Overall, it was found that a wide range of microstructures could be produced, ranging from copolymers with low and high 1 -octene content with unimodal to broad short chain branching distributions, and from low to high molecular weight with narrow to broad molecular weight distributions. To examine the effect of these broad short chain branching distributions on the polymer properties, a series of poly(ethylene-co- 1 -hexene) resins with very distinct, and in some cases bimodal crystalline distributions, were synthesized. The attractive feature of the resins in this study is that their molecular weight distributions are similar but each possesses a different short chain branching distribution, thus effectively minimizing the effect of molecular weight on the properties investigated. It was found that the tensile properties of a copolymer could be controlled by the ratio of the crystalline species present in the sample. In this study, a balance of stiffness and toughness was exhibited by a copolymer containing a large proportion of crystalline material and a small fraction of material of lower crystallinity. A series of poly(ethylene-co- 1 -octene) resins with tailored molecular weight and short chain branching distributions were synthesized with a heterogeneous metallocene catalyst in a two-stage polymerization process. Blends of high molecular weight copolymer and low molecular weight homopolymer and reverse blends of low molecular weight copolymer and high molecular weight homopolymer were produced. The physical properties of these resins were tested for their dynamic mechanical (tensile) and rheological properties. Increasing the copolymer content in the blend resulted in a decrease in stiffness. However, the energy dampening properties of these blends benefit from the presence of the copolymer. It was also confirmed that the melt flow properties of polymers mostly depend on their molecular weight distribution. Regardless of the comonomer content, the melt viscosities decreased with the addition of low molecular weight polymer...|$|E

Dynamic light scattering analysis indicates a self-assembly of PI-phi(2) OH in heptane, a good solvent for polyisoprene and a poor one for the polar end-group. The so-formed micelle-like nanoparticles, composed of a di-phenyl alcohol group core and a polyisoprene corona were used as organic supports for catalytic system composed of aluminic activators, trimethylaluminium (TMA) or methylaluminoxane (MAO), and metallocene or post-metallocene catalysts, to produce micrometric polyethylene beads...|$|R

Physical combination of various polyolefin types in a secondary extrusion process {{is also a}} common practice to achieve new products with improved properties.

Techniques like temperature rising elution fractionation (TREF) or crystallization analysis fractionation (CRYSTAF) are currently used to characterize the composition distribution of these resins.
