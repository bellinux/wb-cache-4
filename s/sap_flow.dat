500|$|Maples {{are usually}} tapped {{beginning}} at 30 to 40 years of age. Each tree can support {{between one and}} three taps, depending on its trunk diameter. The average maple tree will produce [...] of sap per season, up to [...] per day. This is roughly equal to 7% of its total sap. Seasons last for four to eight weeks, depending on the weather. During the day, starch stored in the roots for the winter rises through the trunk as sugary sap, allowing it to be tapped. Sap is not tapped at night because the temperature drop inhibits <b>sap</b> <b>flow,</b> although taps are typically left in place overnight. Some producers also tap in autumn, though this practice is less common than spring tapping. Maples can continue to be tapped for sap until they are over 100 years old.|$|E
500|$|In plant {{physiology}} research interest {{was focused on}} the movement of sap and the absorption of substances through the roots. Jan Helmont (1577–1644) by experimental observation and calculation, noted that the increase in weight of a growing plant cannot be derived purely from the soil, and concluded it must relate to water uptake. Englishman Stephen Hales (1677–1761) established by quantitative experiment that there is uptake of water by plants and a loss of water by transpiration and that this is influenced by environmental conditions: he distinguished [...] "root pressure", [...] "leaf suction" [...] and [...] "imbibition" [...] and also noted that the major direction of <b>sap</b> <b>flow</b> in woody tissue is upward. His results were published in Vegetable Staticks (1727) He also noted that [...] "air makes a very considerable part of the substance of vegetables". English chemist Joseph Priestley (1733–1804) is noted for his discovery of oxygen (as now called) and its production by plants. Later Jan Ingenhousz (1730–1799) observed that only in sunlight do the green parts of plants absorb air and release oxygen, this being more rapid in bright sunlight while, at night, the air (CO2) is released from all parts. His results were published in Experiments upon vegetables (1779) and with this the foundations for 20th century studies of carbon fixation were laid. From his observations he sketched the cycle of carbon in nature even though the composition of carbon dioxide was yet to be resolved. Studies in plant nutrition had also progressed. In 1804 Nicolas-Théodore de Saussure's (1767–1845) [...] was an exemplary study of scientific exactitude that demonstrated the similarity of respiration in both plants and animals, that the fixation of carbon dioxide includes water, and that just minute amounts of salts and nutrients (which he analysed in chemical detail from plant ash) have a powerful influence on plant growth.|$|E

50|$|Transpiration {{rates of}} plants can be {{measured}} {{by a number of}} techniques, including potometers, lysimeters, porometers, photosynthesis systems and thermometric <b>sap</b> <b>flow</b> sensors. Isotope measurements indicate transpiration is the larger component of evapotranspiration. Recent evidence from a global study of water stable isotopes shows that transpired water is isotopically different from groundwater and streams. This suggests that soil water is not as well mixed as widely assumed.|$|E

50|$|The yellow-bellied glider's diet {{consists}} of nectar, honeydew, insects, pollen {{and a wide}} spread of tree sap including different Eucalyptus sap, Corymbia sap, some Angophora sap, and Lophostemon sap. It shows a strong preference for trees with a smooth bark, possibly relating to the volume of <b>sap</b> <b>flow.</b> It obtains the tree sap by biting a 'V' shape wedge/notch into the bark to promote the flow of gum and sap. It usually incises the bark on the trunks or upper branches of the trees.|$|E
5000|$|Because {{blackberries}} {{belong to}} the same genus as raspberries, they share the same diseases including anthracnose which can cause the berry to have uneven ripening and <b>sap</b> <b>flow</b> may also be slowed. They also share the same remedies including the Bordeaux mixture, a combination of lime, water and copper(II) sulfate. The rows between blackberry plants must be free of weeds, blackberry suckers and grasses which may lead to pests or diseases. Fruit growers are selective when planting blackberry bushes as wild blackberries may be infected and gardeners are recommended to purchase only certified disease-free plants.|$|E

50|$|The complex has {{multiple}} species {{under the same}} name followed by the genus of its host plant (i.e. Enchenopa binotata 'Ptelea' for species that live in Ptelea trifoliata). The nutritional value of the host plant's sap could delay or boost adult maturation and egg hatching. Sap with more essential nutrients or more <b>sap</b> <b>flow</b> for the species can promote faster maturation and/or egg hatching. Species on different host plants have developed allochronic phenologies. This means that species on different host plants have evolved different timing in their life history.|$|E
50|$|The {{red-headed}} ash borer usually {{develops in}} recently dead or dying hardwood trees, so {{the most common}} impact on humans is damage to felled trees intended for hardwood lumber or firewood. These insects are commonly brought into homes with firewood and may emerge, but do no physical damage to the home. This species {{has been known to}} infest weak or newly planted living trees and is a pest of nursery stock in some areas. The feeding of the larvae may cut off <b>sap</b> <b>flow,</b> and in some cases weaken the trunk of young trees making them more susceptible to wind damage.|$|E
50|$|Maples {{are usually}} tapped {{beginning}} at 30 to 40 years of age. Each tree can support {{between one and}} three taps, depending on its trunk diameter. The average maple tree will produce 35 to 50 L of sap per season, up to 12 L per day. This is roughly equal to 7% of its total sap. Seasons last for four to eight weeks, depending on the weather. During the day, starch stored in the roots for the winter rises through the trunk as sugary sap, allowing it to be tapped.

40|$|Direct {{visualization}} of water-conducting pathways and <b>sap</b> <b>flows</b> in xylem vessels {{is important for}} understanding the physiology of vascular plants and their sap ascent. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) combined with synchrotron X-ray imaging technique is a new promising tool for investigating plant hydraulics in opaque xylem vessels of vascular plants. However, in practical applications of AuNPs for real-time quantitative {{visualization of}} <b>sap</b> <b>flows,</b> their interaction with a vascular network needs to be verified in advance. In this study, the effect of AuNPs on the water-refilling function of xylem vessels is experimentally investigated with three monocot species. Discrepancy in the water uptakes starts to appear at about 20 min to 40 min after the supply of AuNP solution to the test plant by the possible gradual accumulation of AuNPs on the internal structures of vasculature. However conclusively, {{it is observed that}} the water-refilling speeds in individual xylem vessels are virtually unaffected by hydrophilically surface-modified AuNPs (diameter ∼ 20 nm). Therefore, the AuNPs can be effectively used as flow tracers in the xylem vessels in the first 20 ∼ 30 min without any physiological barrier. As a result, AuNPs are found to be useful for visualizing various fluid dynamic phenomena occurring in vascular plants...|$|R

50|$|Propolis or {{bee glue}} is a {{resinous}} mixture that honey bees produce by mixing saliva and beeswax with exudate gathered from tree buds, <b>sap</b> <b>flows,</b> or other botanical sources. It {{is used as}} a sealant for unwanted open spaces in the hive. Propolis is used for small gaps (approximately 6 mm or less), while larger spaces are usually filled with beeswax. Its color varies depending on its botanical source, the most common being dark brown. Propolis is sticky at, and above, room temperature (20 C). At lower temperatures, it becomes hard and very brittle.|$|R
50|$|Life {{histories}} {{of this species}} {{vary according to the}} phenology of their host plants. These treehoppers lay their eggs on its host plant’s branches, as well as spend their juvenile and adult life on one plant. Egg hatching of these treehoppers are tied into the <b>sap</b> <b>flow</b> of their host plants. After winter, flow of the plant's sap to their stems is the stimuli the eggs need to start hatching. Once they have hatched from the stems as nymphs, they molt until adulthood (final form). Males start signaling first a week after they reach adulthood. Females become reproductively receptive 1-2 weeks about the males. After reproducing, females stay on one plant and oviposit their eggs continuously until they expire or until the first frost hits. Males live shorter than females and usually die shortly after mating a number of times.|$|E
50|$|During {{the last}} quarter of the twentieth century, the zone of {{latitude}} occupied by the boreal forest experienced some of the greatest temperature increases on Earth. Winter temperatures have increased more than summer temperatures. The number of days with extremely cold temperatures (e.g., −20 to −40 °C (-4 to -40 °F) has decreased irregularly but systematically in nearly all the boreal region, allowing better survival for tree-damaging insects. In summer, the daily low temperature has increased more than the daily high temperature. In Fairbanks, Alaska, the length of the frost-free season has increased from 60-90 days in the early twentieth century to about 120 days a century later. Summer warming has been shown to increase water stress and reduce tree growth in dry areas of the southern boreal forest in central Alaska, western Canada and portions of far eastern Russia. Precipitation is relatively abundant in Scandinavia, Finland, northwest Russia and eastern Canada, where a longer growth season (i.e. the period when <b>sap</b> <b>flow</b> is not impeded by frozen water) accelerate tree growth. As a consequence of this warming trend, the warmer parts of the boreal forests are susceptible to replacement by grassland, parkland or temperate forest.|$|E
50|$|The pygmy {{marmoset}} {{is one of}} the world's smallest primates, and is {{the smallest}} true monkey, with a head-body length ranging from 117 to 152 mm and a tail of 172 to 229 mm. The average adult body weight is just over 100 g with the only sexual dimorphism of females being a little heavier. The fur colour is a mixture of brownish-gold, grey, and black on its back and head and yellow, orange, and tawny on its underparts. Its tail has black rings and its face has flecks of white on its cheeks and a white vertical line between its eyes. It has many adaptations for arboreal living including the ability to rotate its head 180 degrees and sharp claw-like nails used to cling to branches and trees. Its dental morphology is adapted to feeding on gum, with specialised incisors that are used to gouge trees and stimulate <b>sap</b> <b>flow.</b> Its cecum is larger than usual to allow for the greater period of time gum takes to break down in the stomach. The pygmy marmoset walks on all four limbs and can leap up to 5 m between branches.|$|E

The spirit of the old woman lying in her last sleep had called them to this demonstration. It was her final appeal to that unity which had been their strength--it was her final triumph that she had died while the tree was yet whole.|$|R
