The rudder was mass-balanced, and the flutter mode studied was essentially one of three degrees of freedom (fin bending coupled with rudder and tab oscillations). Inasmuch as the <b>spring</b> was <b>preloaded,</b> the tab-spring system was a nonlinear one. Frequency of the tab was the most significant parameter in this study, and an increase in flutter speed with increasing frequency is indicated. At a given frequency, the tab of high aspect ratio is shown to have a slightly lower flutter speed than the one of low aspect ratio. Because the frequency of the <b>preloaded</b> <b>spring</b> tab was found to vary radically with amplitude, the flutter speed decreased with increase in initial displacement of the tab...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are to identify the dynamics of a Tenneco Automotive hydraulic damper valve and to predict valve performance. Accurate simulations of damper valve performance can be used to improve valve designs without the expense of physical testing. The Tenneco damper valve consists of thin shims and a <b>spring</b> <b>preloaded</b> disc that restricts fluid from exiting the main flow orifices. The deflection of the shims and spring are dependent on the flow-rate through the valve. The pressure distribution acting on the deformable valve components is investigated numerically using a dynamic modelling technique. This technique involves sequential geometry and simulation updating, while varying both the geometry and flow-rate. The valve deflection is calculated by post-processing the pressure distribution. Valve performance can be predicted by coupling the valve deflection with CFD pressure results...|$|R
5000|$|A more {{sophisticated}} method of presetting torque {{is with a}} calibrated clutch mechanism. One common form uses a ball detent and spring, with the <b>spring</b> <b>preloaded</b> by an adjustable screw thread, calibrated in torque units. The ball detent transmits force until the preset torque is reached, {{at which point the}} force exerted by the spring is overcome and the ball [...] "clicks" [...] out of its socket. The advantage of this design is greater precision and both tangible and audible feedback on reaching the desired torque. The wrench will not start slipping once the desired torque is reached, it will only click and bend slightly at the head, the operator can continue to apply torque to the wrench without any additional action or warnings from the wrench. For this reason, it is important to stop applying torque as soon as the wrench gives the click sound.|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} bearing thermal growth on the {{effectiveness}} of the bearing <b>preload</b> <b>springs</b> on the space shuttle main engine high pressure oxygen turbopump (SSME HPTOP) were examined. The SSME HPTOP turbine end bearings, <b>preload</b> <b>spring,</b> and bearing mounting design were evaluated relative to spalling, excessive ball wear, possible thermal problems, and cage delamination. The magnitude of the thermal stresses required to cause high levels of ball wear were calculated. Plots of maximum sheer stress and maximum reversing shear versus the axial load for the 57 mm SSME HPTOP bearing were created. A plot of the bearing thermal growth versus <b>preload</b> <b>spring</b> deflection was generated. It was determined that metallic wear, rather than thermal growth, caused enlargement of the contact zone between ball and races, that high fatigue-inducing shear stresses are generated under increased loads, and that at temperatures between 100 and 150 deg C, the springs bottom out and very high loads are developed in the bearing.

50|$|For 2010, the Triumph Sprint GT (Grand Tourer) was launched, {{featuring}} a {{revised version of}} the 1050 triple engine with slightly more power (128 hp / 96 kW @ 9200 rpm) and torque (108 Nm / 80 ft-lb @ 6300 rpm) though the peak torque was produced at significantly higher revs than before. The power changes were {{as a result of}} use of an uprated ECU, the elimination of the 1050 ST's signature triple under seat exhaust in favour of a side-mounted 3-into-1 exhaust, and a revised throttle body intake. The highest gear was made seven percent taller than the ST to allowing for more relaxed highway cruising, giving an engine speed at a steady 110 km/h (68 MPH) of just over 4,000 rpm. The GT chassis was slightly longer than the ST, with an overall length of 2260mm (89.0 inches) compared to the ST with 2114mm (83.2 inches) and a wheelbase for the GT of 1537mm (60.5 inches) compared to the ST at a smaller 1457mm (57.4 inches). Suspension components were also changed, the front forks containing all new internal spring rates and rear suspension featuring <b>spring</b> <b>preload</b> and rebound damping adjustability, the former being with a twist knob rather than adjustable with a flat-head screwdriver - front and rear suspension units were supplied by Showa. These modifications added just over 7 kg to the weight of the bike, which now had a kerb weight of 265 kg. The GT retained the 2008 ST headlamp design, and included anti-lock brakes (ABS) that had been optional on the ST 1050. The longer chassis allowed pillion footpegs to be repositioned and the seat reshaped to be more accommodating for carrying a passenger, and the use of a new design of hard panniers that were significantly larger than those available on the ST 1050 (31 litres each side vs. 22 litres each side on the ST 1050) were supplied as a standard fitting, with an optional 55 litre top box able to be obtained as a factory accessory.|$|E

It also takes into account the valve <b>spring</b> <b>preload</b> in the overall balance of forces moving the valve.

40|$|Tutorialpg. 221 Compared to {{leading edge}} {{technologies}} such as high speed turbomachinery, reciprocating pumps {{may appear to be}} a simple technology: A reciprocating plunger causes liquid to be drawn from a low pressure manifold through the suction check valves, and expelled into a high pressure manifold through the discharge check valves. However, the interaction of flow, valve dynamics, and the acoustics of the pump and piping system can generate high amplitude pressure pulsation, causing severe vibration and reliability problem in some systems. The effects of improperly operating valves, and the successful resolution of such problems with valve design modifications are examined. Since the pump vales are operated by the action of the fluid, valve components (including the spring, valve body, valve disc shape, and sealing surfaces, etc.) must be carefully selected to ensure that the valves open and close at the appropriate times. Problems associated with valve dynamics include over pressure spikes at the opening of discharge valves, under pressure spikes {{at the opening of the}} suction valves, high noise levels, and excessive wear of valve components. Severe over pressure spikes have been known to cause fatigue failures of pump working barrels, connecting rods, bearings, and even drive-train components. Under pressure spikes can cause cavitation that can also lead to plunger and valve failures, due to pitting damage. High level valve noise is usually indicative of sever impacts associated with the opening and closing of the valves. Impacts at the valve closing are sometimes referred to as valve hammer and can result in damage to the sealing surfaces. Impacts at the valve opening, which may be identified by damage to the back side of the valve disc, are due to the over pressure and under pressure spikes which can result in fatigue failures of the components. Excessive valve wear can also be experienced when the valve disc material is not suitable for the pumping conditions. The use of field data coupled with a computer model to analyze the valve dynamics will be presented. Using this tool, the effect of various valve modifications such as changes in sealing surfaces, valve lift, <b>spring</b> <b>preload,</b> and spring stiffness can be observed. Instrumentation and data analysis techniques to evaluate these problems will also be discussed. The effects of modifications to valves (including changes in lift, <b>spring</b> <b>preload,</b> spring construction and stiffness, valve disc geometries, etc.) will be examined using data from actual systems...|$|E

Apparent spiral stability is the term used to describe the spiraling tendencies of an airplane in uncontrolled flight as affected both by the true spiral stability of the perfectly trimmed airplane and by out-of-trim control settings. Centering springs were used in both the aileron and rudder control systems to provide both a positive centering action and a means of trimming the airplane.

40|$|Advanced {{performances}} in nanospacecraft are {{typically associated with}} high onboard power availability, requiring deployed solar arrays. Nanospacecraft geometrical and weight constraints do not allow the use of reversible dynamics and lock systems used in conventional spacecraft. Most nanospacecraft deployed solar panel systems are therefore based on compact and reliable miniaturized mechanisms, such as simple passively deployed <b>preloaded</b> <b>springs.</b> The use {{of these kinds of}} deployed solar arrays may interfere with the performance of the attitude control system. Agile nanospacecraft, designed to perform rapid attitude maneuvers, may potentially be affected by the solar array dynamical interaction with the main satellite body motion. In addition, the presence of inherently nonlinear elements, such as bounds on allowed rotations and <b>preloaded</b> <b>springs,</b> deserve a dedicated analysis. The analysis developed in this paper is based on the performance of state-of-the art agile nanosatellite attitude control systems, specifically developed for delivering high torque and fast attitude maneuvering, such as miniaturized control moment gyros. By numerical simulation, it is shown that, despite the simplicity of the deployment system and the absence of locking mechanisms, the attitude dynamics remains substantially unaffected by the solar array dynamics. This is obtained straightforwardly by properly sizing the spring stiffness and by a sufficient level of preload...|$|R

Spring designer used to think under certain extreme operating conditions, the spring could be lifted off from the ledge because the spring is not stiff enough to prevent the “lift-off”. Therefore, the spring was designed as stiff as it practically can be. However, finite element study indicated that the magnitude of preload is a strong function of friction coefficient. To find {{the magnitude of the}} friction coefficient, a series of tests were conducted on 1 / 10 scale hold down spring samples of three different spring designs. From the test results, {{it was found that the}} friction coefficient increases rapidly as the number of loading cycles increases.

40|$|A CFD {{test case}} of a {{positive}} displacement reciprocating pump is presented to demonstrate the capability and benefits which numerical analysis may bring to designers in terms of information on fluid dynamic fields useful to optimize the geometry of the discussed device in all the different operating conditions; even in the worst operating conditions when cavitation appears. The paper discusses the role of design parameters such as the inlet valve shape, mass and <b>spring</b> <b>preload</b> in full cavitating conditions. The comprehensive CFD model makes use of the Singhal et al. (1) cavitation algorithm in conjunction with an Eulerian multiphase model. User defined functions add a few more functionalities to the CFD solver such as the valve dynamics model and the compressibility of water. For each of the cases, the work presented shows the capability of the CFD technique to predict quantitative results such as the volumetric efficiency loss and amount of water vapour generated when cavitation arises. Providing pump designers with this information before the design process {{has come to an}} end would give them the possibility to improve the operational life of the device as well as its efficiency.

40|$|Numerical and {{experimental}} investigations {{have been carried}} out in order to study the effect of the poppet geometry on the flow-pressure characteristic of a direct acting pressure relief valve, which is equipped with a flow deflector for flow force compensation. A dynamic 3 D-CFD model was built in ANSYS Fluent™, which is capable of simulating the interaction between the fluid flow and the poppet dynamics by means of mesh deformation and of a user-defined function (UDF). This model was applied to predict the flow-pressure characteristics of the valve for different <b>spring</b> <b>preload</b> settings and deflector geometries. The simulated curves were validated using experimental data acquired at FPRL (Fluid Power Research Laboratory) at the Politecnico di Torino, and an excellent agreement was found. The CFD model was then used to predict the effect of geometric parameters of the poppet, such as the cone angle and the position of the deflector. Finally, a 0 D model has been developed in order to predict the flow forces; this model requires very few calibration points using 3 D-CFD simulations, and can easily be implemented in lumped parameter simulation tools. It was found that this model leads to a satisfactory prediction of the flow-pressure characteristic of the valve...|$|E

The Moon is a unique science platform because it allows access to radio frequencies that do not penetrate the Earth's ionosphere and because its far side is shielded from intense terrestrial emissions. A radio antenna can be realized by using polyimide film as a substrate, with a conducting substance deposited on it. Such an antenna can be rolled into a small volume for transport, then deployed by unrolling, and a robotic rover offers a natural means of unrolling a polyimide film-based antenna. An antenna deployment mechanism was developed that allows a thin film to be deposited onto a ground surface, in a controlled manner, using a minimally actuated rover. The deployment mechanism consists of two rollers, one driven and one passive. The antenna film is wrapped around the driven roller. The passive roller is mounted on linear bearings that allow it to move radially {{with respect to the}} driven roller. <b>Springs</b> <b>preload</b> the passive roller against the driven roller, and prevent the tightly wrapped film from unspooling or "bird's nesting" on the driven spool. The antenna deployment mechanism is integrated on the minimally-actuated Axel rover. Axel is a two-wheeled rover platform with a trailing boom that is capable of traversing undulated terrain and overcoming obstacles of a wheel radius in height. It is operated by four motors: one that drives each wheel; a third that controls the rotation of the boom, which orients the body mounted sensors; and a fourth that controls the rover's spool to drive the antenna roller. This low-mass axle-like rover houses its control and communication avionics inside its cylindrical body. The Axel rover teleoperation software has an auto-spooling mode that allows a user to automatically deploy the thin-film antenna at a rate proportional to the wheel speed as it drives the rover along its trajectory. The software allows Axel to deposit the film onto the ground to prevent or minimize relative motion between the film and the terrain to avoid the risk of scraping and antenna with the terrain...|$|R
