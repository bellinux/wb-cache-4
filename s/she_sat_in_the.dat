Reagan hosted two 2008 Republican presidential debates at the Reagan Presidential Library, {{the first in}} May 2007 and the second in January 2008. While she {{did not participate in}} the discussions, <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> front row and listened as the men vying to become the nation's 44th president claimed to be a rightful successor to her husband. Though some speculation arose as to whether Reagan might support New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg in a presidential bid, nothing came of it. On March 25, she formally endorsed Senator John McCain, then the presumptive Republican party nominee for president, but McCain would go on to lose the election to Barack Obama.|$|E

Although she maintained her residence, Ray Mill House, which she purchased in 1995 at Lacock, Wiltshire, she then moved into Clarence House, Charles's household and official residence since 2003.|$|E
25|$|In 1952, Florence {{attempted}} to swim the 26 miles between Catalina Island and the California coastline. As she began, she was flanked by small boats that watched for sharks and {{were prepared to}} help her if she got hurt or grew tired. After about 15 hours a thick fog set in. Florence began to doubt her ability, and she told her mother, who {{was in one of}} the boats, that she did not think she could make it. She swam for another hour before asking to be pulled out, unable to see the coastline due to the fog. As <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> boat, she found out she had stopped swimming just one mile away from her destination. Two months later, she tried again. The same thick fog set in, but she succeeded in reaching Catalina. She said that she kept a mental image of the shoreline in her mind while she swam. She later swam the Catalina channel on two additional occasions.|$|E

25|$|Over the {{following}} days, Chikatilo confessed to a further 22 killings {{which had not}} been connected to the case, either because the murders had been committed outside the Rostov Oblast, because the bodies had not been found, or, {{in the case of}} Yelena Zakotnova, because an innocent man had been convicted and executed for the murder. (Aleksandr Kravchenko received a posthumous pardon for Yelena Zakotnova's murder.) As had been the case with the victims compiled upon the initial list of charges, Chikatilo was able to provide details of these additional killings only the perpetrator could have known: one of these additional victims, 14-year-old Lyubov Volobuyeva, had lived in south-western Siberia, and had been killed in a sorghum field near Krasnodar Airport on 25 July 1982. Chikatilo recalled that he had killed Volobuyeva in a millet field, and that he had approached the girl as <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> waiting rooms at Krasnodar Airport. Volobuyeva, Chikatilo stated, had informed him she lived in the Siberian city of Novokuznetsk, and was awaiting a connecting flight at the airport to visit relatives.|$|E
500|$|In 1910, Alexandra {{became the}} first queen consort to visit the British House of Commons during a debate. In a {{remarkable}} departure from precedent, for two hours <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Ladies' Gallery overlooking the chamber while the Parliament Bill, a bill to remove {{the right of the}} House of Lords to veto legislation, was debated. Privately, Alexandra disagreed with the bill. Shortly afterward, she left to visit her brother, King George I of Greece, in Corfu. While there, she received news that King Edward was seriously ill. Alexandra returned at once and arrived just the day before her husband died. In his last hours, she personally administered oxygen from a gas cylinder to help him breathe. She told Frederick Ponsonby, [...] "I feel as if I had been turned into stone, unable to cry, unable to grasp the meaning of it all." [...] Later that year, she moved out of Buckingham Palace to Marlborough House, but she retained possession of Sandringham. The new king, Alexandra's son George, soon faced a decision over the Parliament Bill. Despite her personal views, Alexandra supported her son's reluctant agreement to Prime Minister H. H. Asquith's request to create sufficient Liberal peers after a general election if the Lords continued to block the legislation.|$|E
2500|$|She was a founder, in 1947, of the Democratic Women's League ("Demokratischer Frauenbund Deutschlands" [...] / DFD), {{serving on}} its {{national}} executive between 1948 and 1955. [...] The DFD {{was one of}} several mass organisations which, under the Leninist constitutional structure being unrolled in the occupation zone, operated {{under the control of the}} ruling party to broaden the popular mandate of the political power structure in the Soviet zone, which was relaunched, in October 1949, as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic (East Germany). [...] The DFD displayed several of the features of a political party, and was allocated a (fixed) quota of seats in the national parliament ("Volkskammer") by the SED. [...] Malter herself was a member both of the People's Council ("Volksrat") and of the national parliament ("Volkskammer") which emerged from it, between 1948 and 1954. [...] During 1949/50 she served as a member of the parliamentary presidium. [...] Although she was, naturally, a member of the ruling SED (party), <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Volkskammer not as a representative of the SED but as a representative of the FDGB which, like the DFD, enjoyed the status of an officially mandated mass organisation, and was allocated its own quota of seats in the Volkskammer. [...] She also served in the Ministry for Labour and Professional Training as a secretary of state and deputy minister between 1950 and 1956.|$|E

30|$|Another {{resistance}} {{strategy was}} refusal. “I will not raise {{my hand in}} that stupid way,” Dasha told me. “And I will not move my seat; I like being <b>in</b> <b>the</b> back. It’s stupid.” Sadly, {{it became clear to}} me that despite <b>the</b> fact <b>she</b> had <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Mongolian track class for two years, over 50  % of <b>the</b> information spoken <b>in</b> Mongolian and in Chinese was unknown or unclear to her. Instead of trying to catch up or keep up with her peers, Dasha’s strategy was to stay <b>in</b> <b>the</b> back corner and play with her phone, IPod, and/or IPAD using Russian. Unfortunately, her strategy of refusing to participate also undermined her chances for gaining much communicative competence in either Mongolian or Chinese.|$|R
2500|$|Mercedes Gleitze was {{the first}} British woman to swim the English Channel on 7 October 1927. However, as John E. Brozek (author of The Rolex Report: An Unauthorized Reference Book for the Rolex Enthusiast) points out in his article [...] "The Vindication Swim, Mercedes Gleitze and Rolex take the plunge", some doubts were cast on her {{achievement}} when a hoaxer claimed {{to have made a}} faster swim only four days later. Hence Gleitze attempted a repeat swim with extensive publicity on 21 October, dubbed the [...] "Vindication Swim". For promotional purposes, Hans Wilsdorf offered her one of the earliest Rolex Oysters if she would wear it during the attempt. After more than 10 hours, in water that was much colder than during her first swim, she was pulled from the sea semi-conscious seven miles short of her goal. Although she did not complete the second crossing, a journalist for The Times wrote [...] "Having regard to the general conditions, the endurance of Miss Gleitze surprised the doctors, journalists and experts who were present, for it seemed unlikely that {{she would be able to}} withstand the cold for so long. It was a good performance". As <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> boat, the same journalist made a discovery and reported it as follows: [...] "Hanging round her neck by a ribbon on this swim, Miss Gleitze carried a small gold watch, which was found this evening to have kept good time throughout". When examined closely, the watch was found to be dry inside and in perfect condition. One month later, on 24 November 1927, Wilsdorf launched the Rolex Oyster watch in the United Kingdom with a full front page Rolex advert in the Daily Mail. The Vienna Herald described the 1969 Apollo moon landing as: 'an event almost as significant as the time a woman swam most of the English Channel with a waterproof watch on.' ...|$|E

Nelly mentions how she doesn't want to hear Flo Rida ever again. Her boyfriend broke up with her at a Flo Rida concert. Jenny and Elise run into the dog-walker again. It turns out that he's rich. Jenny then gets interested in him. Blair sees Nelly studying, so she turns on Flo Rida and walks by. Nelly mentions her break-up, so Blair comforts her. She then invites Nelly to her penthouse to let all her feelings out. Vanessa is waiting at a diner for Nate. Nate shows up and after the waitress says Nate's name, he explains that his father is in rehab a couple blocks away. Vanessa feels bad while Nate explains how he comes here afterwards. Vanessa apologizes to him for reading one of his practice essays. She begins to see that Nate isn't like a regular rich snob. Georgina calls Serena and wants {{to make it up}} to her. Georgina says that Serena's transformation for the better is an inspiration to her.

She added that she, as a woman and while recalling what manga she liked to read as a child, felt that [...] "humans turning into animals might also be fun and ... you know, like a fairy tale." [...] In 2013, she revealed that at the start of Ranma her editor told her to make it more dramatic, but she felt that was something she could not do.

40|$|<b>The</b> famine <b>in</b> {{southern}} Sudan {{is threatening}} {{the lives of}} {{more than half a}} million southerners, especially in Bahr El Ghazal province. The famine has provoked a debate into its causes. Most commentators <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom accused the war of being the main culprit. A few days ago, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House of Commons, a conservative MP stood up and said that <b>the</b> war <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sudan, and all wars in Africa for that matter, are caused by the political vacuum left behind by colonial powers and wondered if something could be done about that! Clare Short, the Minister for Overseas Development, called the Hounrable Gentleman foolish to ask implicitly for the return of colonialism. The war and the famine, she said, are the responsibility of the leadership on both sides of the conflict. They have to stop the war now and everything would go back to normal. <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> down happy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> feeling that she had defeated the argument of her conservative opponent. The war, according to Clare Short, is all about African leaders. The BBC, however, knew better. Commenting on the pictures of emaciated southern Sudanese children, its newsreader described the war as between Muslim Arabs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> north and Christian Africans <b>in</b> <b>the</b> south. The war is thus a religious and ethnic war. All three interpretations belong to traditional schools of conflict analysis, which explain all armed conflicts in Africa as ethnic, tribal, cultural, religious, etc. These interpretations throw the stick of ethnicity at all conflicts and see there, it devours them all. This is not only unhelpful, but could seriously hamper efforts at genuine conflict management and conflict resolution. A study of all three major violent conflicts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sudan shows the futility of this traditional approach to conflict analysis and conflict resolution...|$|R
