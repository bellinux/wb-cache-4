Only three of the preparations (hypochlorite, peracetic acid, and cupric ascorbate) studied here inactivated more than 99. 9 % of the spore load after a 30 -min incubation at 20 degrees C at concentrations generally used to decontaminate medical devices. Under similar conditions, glutaraldehyde inactivated approximately 90 %, and hydrogen peroxide, formaldehyde, and phenol produced little killing of spores in suspension. By kinetic analysis at different temperatures, we calculated the rate of spore inactivation (k) and the activation energy of spore killing (delta E) for each chemical agent.

Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicidal concentrations (MFC) were determined against twelve Candida strains. Acrylic resin specimens were exposed to artificial saliva (GI), C. zeylanicum (GII), and nystatin (GIII) for 15 days. Data were submitted to ANOVA and Tukey posttest (α= 5 %).

In the present study, wildtype (C 57 Bl/ 6 J) and TRPV 1 knockout mice were tested in three behavioral assays for irritation to determine if TRPV 1 is necessary to detect trigeminal irritants in addition to capsaicin.

The following substances were tested: 0. 2 % farnesol; 5 % and 20 % xylitol; 0. 2 % farnesol plus 20 % xylitol; and saline (control). For comparison with an established endodontic irrigant, 2. 5 % NaOCl was included in each test. Three experiments were conducted: the crystal violet assay, to evaluate the effects on the biofilm biomass; the dentin disinfection test, to evaluate the effects on bacterial viability in biofilms; and the root canal disinfection test, to simulate the use in the root canal environment. Farnesol was the most effective substance in reducing the biofilm biomass, followed by 20 % xylitol. All substances affected bacterial viability in biofilms; farnesol showed the best results followed by the farnesol/xylitol combination. Irrigation with all substances significantly reduced the bacterial load (p< 0. 001), but only the farnesol/xylitol combination was significantly more effective than saline (p= 0. 02). NaOCl was more effective than any other <b>substance</b> <b>tested</b> in the three experiments (p< 0. 001).

30|$|An {{evaluation}} method that promotes transparency, {{such as the}} CRED {{evaluation method}}, can effectively reduce bias related to expert judgment. However, expert judgment should, and cannot, be excluded from the evaluation process. It is needed because {{the weight of the}} individual evaluation criteria leading to a final reliability and relevance categorization strongly depends on study design, <b>substance</b> <b>tested,</b> and organisms used. Thus, a single criterion may be critical for one study, but not for another. When a study is evaluated, the final categorization should be based on a balanced assessment of its strengths and weaknesses within a specific framework. Thus, the reliability and relevance categorization of a study should never be based on merely counting the number of fulfilled criteria [48, 49]. Systematic evaluation approaches for toxicological studies such as the ToxRTool [9, 23] emphasize this need for expert judgement. Failure to meet a single criterion considered critical for a particular study result may invalidate a study, while this criterion may not be critical for another study with a different substance or test organism. By requiring the reporting of evaluation results for each criterion, the CRED evaluation method provides documented transparency regarding the use of expert judgment in study evaluations. This allows risk assessors to focus their discussions on the specific strengths and weaknesses of a study rather than solely on Klimisch categories. Such improved transparency can guide and facilitate the identification and use of key studies, and ensure that all relevant and reliable ecotoxicological information is included in future hazard and risk assessment.|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the action of ozone (O 3), and the association of sodium fluoride (NaF) with chlorhexidine (CHX) on bacteria related to ECC. Overnight culture of the bacteria was performed. On exponential phase the suspension was adjusted (101 - 108 CFU/mL). A drop (10 μL) of each concentration of bacteria was applied on sheep blood agar plates and treated with O 3 (2, 20, 200, and 2, 000 ppm); after 18 hours, recovery analysis of CFU verified the reduction of bacterial activity. For NaF-CHX, sterile 96 -well plates were prepared and divided into groups: G 1 (150 µL TSB); G 2 (20 µL of bacteria + 25 µL CHX + 25 µL NaF); and G 3 (150 µL TSB + 20 µL of bacteria + 50 µL water). The plates were verified by analysis of the optical density (0, 12, 14, 16, and 18 hours). The data from O 3 test were submitted to ANOVA and Tukey’s test (p 3 log 10 (99. 9 %) for all bacteria (ozone ≥ 20 ppm), while the combination of NaF-CHX was more effective (p < 0. 001) compared to each <b>substance</b> <b>tested</b> alone and the control group.

40|$|Introduction: Treatment {{of cancer}} has been subject of great interest. Researchers are {{continuously}} searching for new medicines. In this sense, ruthenium complexes have big potential. Some evidences suggest that ruthenium compounds possess anticancer activities. We synthesized two recently published ruthenium(III) complexes with bidentate O,N and tridentate O,O,N Schiff bases derived from 5 -substituted salicylaldehyde and aminophenol or anilineare. These compounds showed affinity for binding to the DNA molecule, however, insufficient {{data are available}} regarding their possible toxic effects on biological systems. Methods: In the present study we evaluated genotoxic, cytotoxic, and cytostatic effects of Na[RuCl 2 (L 1) 2] and Na[Ru(L 2) 2], using the Allium cepa assay. Results: Different toxic effects were observed depending on the <b>substance,</b> <b>tested</b> concentration, and endpoint measured. In general, the tested compounds significantly lowered the root growth and mitotic index values {{as compared to the}} control group. Additionally, a wide range of abnormal mitotic stages, both clastogenic and non-clastogenic were observed in the treated cells. Na[RuCl 2 (L 1) 2] significantly increased the frequency of sticky metaphases, chromosome bridges, micronuclei, impaired chromosome segregation, as well as number of apoptotic and necrotic cells over the controls. In contrast, Na[Ru(L 2) 2] did not show significant evidence of genotoxicity with regard to chromosome aberrations and micronuclei, however, significant differences were detected in the number of apoptotic and necrotic cells when the highest concentration was applied. Conclusions: In this study we demonstrated antiproliferative effects of Na[RuCl 2 (L 1) 2] and Na[Ru(L 2) 2]. At clinical level, these results could be interesting for further studies on anticancer potential of the ruthenium(III) complexes using animal models. </p...|$|E

With I ‘ 4 C 1 antipyrine and [‘ 4 C 1 barbital steady-state conditions for radioactivity concentrations in uterine fluid were nearly achieved by 80 mm after injection. At this time, the ratios of uterine fluid to serum radioactivity concentrations for these relatively lipophilic sub-stances were marginally less than 1. 0, indicating that equilibration between serum and uterine fluid radioactivity had nearly occurred. In contrast, these ratios at 80 mm ranged between 0. 30 and 0. 31 for the least lipophiic <b>substance</b> <b>tested,</b> [3 H] mannitol. The ratios of uterine fluid to serum radio-activity concentrations at 5 mm after injection in animals receiving the same hormone treatment indicated that steady-state conditions were approached at differing rates depending upon the test substance.

The result of our experiments demonstrate that anti-influenza activity of PABA solution is almost 100 times higher than that of “ACA”, furthermore in our in vitro experiment the mixture of PABA and ε-aminocaproic acid (in ratio 1 : 100) demonstrates a synergetic effect.
