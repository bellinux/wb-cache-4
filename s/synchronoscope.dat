40|$|Abstract. According to the {{requirements}} and characteristics of Marine Power Station quasi-synchronizing operation, a new high-precision digital <b>synchronoscope</b> is designed. Proteus and Keil are used as experimental platform. The corresponding software programming and peripheral hardware circuit design are completed. Moreover, the implementation {{and analysis of the}} main technical aspects are given. Simulation results show that the new digital <b>synchronoscope</b> fully achieve the functions that display and detection of frequency difference and phase difference between generator voltage and grid voltage. Besides, the operation is reliable, the detection is precise and the cost is low...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- The paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} an experiment in an electrical power systems laboratory using Hall tension and current sensors, an A/D board and the LabVIEW software (National Instruments) to monitor electrical variables, and to calculate and analyze the power, energy and power factor of a mini power system in low tension. The minisystem contains synchronous generators of 2 kVA- 220 V, a transmission line model with reactors and capacitors, and a resistor box to represent a passive charge or an induction motor. The A/D board allows the control of digital outputs, which in turn, can control contactors that switch on or off elements of the circuit under analysis. A program was developed in four main screens: the first screen enables the monitoring of and intervention in the experimental assembly; the second shows the waveform of the signals monitored in the minisystem with their respective harmonics; the third screen shows the phasor graphs of all current and tension signals simultaneously; the fourth and last screen provides a virtual <b>synchronoscope,</b> allowing the analysis of tension and frequency adjustments in the parallelism operation of the minisystem with the local power company. The program allows remote access to the experimental assembly of the mini power system from the computers installed on each laboratory bench. With the experiment, the concepts studied in theory are consolidated. A set of new and future implementations are presented too...|$|E
