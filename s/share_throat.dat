[...] Thus, human mimicry of nature's sounds {{is seen as the}} root of throat singing. An example of this is the Mongolian story of the waterfall above the Buyant Gol (Deer River), where mysterious harmonic sounds are said to have attracted deer to bask in the waters, and where it is said harmonic sounds were first revealed to people. Indeed, the cultures in this part of Asia have developed many instruments and techniques to mimic the sounds of animals, wind, and water.

5000|$|Carl Bernstein did {{not even}} <b>share</b> Deep <b>Throat's</b> {{identity}} with his immediate family, which included his wife, writer Nora Ephron. (As he said on NBC's Today Show on June 2, 2005, [...] "I was never dumb enough to tell her...which was very smart because I would have told the whole world by now.") His wife became obsessed with figuring out the secret and eventually correctly concluded that he was Mark Felt. (It had previously been revealed that Deep Throat was definitely a man.) In 1999, a 19-year-old college freshman, Chase Culeman-Beckman, {{claimed to have been}} told by Bernstein's son that Mark Felt was really Deep Throat. According to Culeman-Beckman, Jacob Bernstein had said that he was [...] "100 percent sure that Deep Throat was Mark Felt. He's someone in the FBI." [...] Jacob had reportedly said this approximately 11 years prior, when he and Chase Culeman-Beckman were classmates. His wife explained that their son overheard her [...] "speculations"; Carl Bernstein himself also immediately stepped forward to reject the claim, but many did not believe these claims.|$|R
50|$|The {{species is}} a medium sized whistler, {{typically}} around 14 - 16 cm {{in length and}} weighing 18 - 25 g, though some subspecies are larger. In the nominate subspecies the male has a dark slate-grey crown, face and nape, a white throat, ochraceous-yellow belly and rump, and olive back and wings with a black line between the throat and belly. The legs are dark brown. Males of other subspecies <b>share</b> the white <b>throat,</b> but are less ochraceous below, and may -depending on the exact subspecies involved- have a far broader black band between the throat and belly, and a black or olive crown, face and nape.|$|R
40|$|Purpose - This study {{investigates the}} nature of Corporate Entrepreneurship (CE) in the Liquor {{industry}} in South Africa. This industry finds itself in turbulent trading conditions and all liquor segments compete for the same <b>share</b> of <b>throat</b> with a situation where competitiveness is increasing within a “free trade” climate. Corporate Entrepreneurship serves as an unconditional solution in this regard. This study defines CE in broad as entrepreneurship {{within the boundaries of}} organisational context. It implies the application of the principles of innovation coupled with entrepreneurial traits and orientation. Methodology – The research design embraces firstly a secondary assessment of the research evidence available in the sub-science, Corporate Entrepreneurship and secondly an empirical investigation based on quantitative assessment measures. The Corporate Entrepreneurship Assessment Instrument (CEAI) was used as the data collection tool whereby the organisations identified areas where management and in particular middle management can make noteworthy impact by developing strategies that can create, increase or sustain endeavours toward Corporate Entrepreneurship. Results – It was found that management support is the underlying factor that initiates and drives entrepreneurship. The results presented a trend that showed an increase in length of tenure with an organisation and the liquor industry in particular. The availability of time plays a very important role initiating entrepreneurial actions from within an organisation. CopyrightDissertation (MBA) [...] University of Pretoria, 2010.

40|$|The Goldberger-Wise {{mechanism}} enables one {{to stabilize}} {{the length of the}} warped extra dimension employed in Randall-Sundrum models. In this work we generalize this mechanism to models with multiple warped <b>throats</b> <b>sharing</b> a common ultraviolet brane. For independent throats this generalization is straight forward. If the throats possess a discrete interchange symmetry like Z_n the stabilizing dynamics may respect the symmetry, resulting in equal throat lengths, or they may break it. In the latter case the ground state of an initially symmetric configuration is a stabilized asymmetric configuration in which the throat lengths differ. We focus on two- (three-) throat setups with a Z_ 2 (Z_ 3) interchange symmetry and present stabilization dynamics suitable for either breaking or maintaining the symmetry. Though admitting more general application, our results are relevant for existing models in the literature, including the two throat model with Kaluza-Klein parity and the three throat model of flavor based on a broken Z_ 3 symmetry.

50|$|The M42 {{lens mount}} is a screw thread {{mounting}} standard for attaching lenses to 35 mm cameras, primarily single-lens reflex models. It is more accurately {{known as the}} M42 &times; 1 mm standard, which means {{that it is a}} metric screw thread of 42 mm diameter and 1 mm thread pitch. (The M42 lens mount {{should not be confused with}} the T-mount, which <b>shares</b> the 42mm <b>throat</b> diameter, but differs by having a 0.75mm thread pitch.) It was first used in Zeiss' Contax S of 1949; this East German branch of Zeiss also sold cameras under the Pentacon name; after merger with other East German photographic manufacturers, the name Praktica was used. M42 thread mount cameras first became well known under the Praktica brand, and thus the M42 mount is known as the Praktica thread mount. Since there were no proprietary elements to the M42 mount, many other manufacturers used it; this has led to it being called the Universal thread mount or Universal screw mount by many. The M42 mount was popularized in the United States by Pentax; thus, it is also known as the Pentax thread mount, despite the fact that Pentax did not originate it.|$|R
5000|$|In December 2011, Franco {{received}} {{the part of}} Hugh Hefner. Robert Patrick, Hank Azaria, Chris Noth, and Bobby Cannavale landed the respective roles of John Boreman (Lovelace's father), Jerry Damiano, Anthony Romano and Butchie Peraino. On January 2, 2012, Adam Brody and Eric Roberts were cast as Harry Reems and Nat Laurendi, while Demi Moore agreed to a cameo appearance as Gloria Steinem. A few weeks later she {{dropped out of the}} film for personal issues and was replaced by Sarah Jessica Parker. However, Parker's cameo was ultimately deleted. Cory Hardrict and Debi Mazar play Frankie Crocker and Dolly Sharp. Chloë Sevigny plays a feminist journalist. [...] To prepare for the role, Seyfried read Lovelace's books and studied videos of her speaking. She also watched the film Deep Throat and underwent a New York accent training. Seyfried said of Lovelace: [...] "She was such a different person than what we expect. It’s a good story to tell, and I’m really, really excited about it." [...] Brody prepared for the role of Reems by watching his interviews. He told that [...] "the arrest and indictment of Reems on federal charges of conspiracy to distribute obscenity across state lines" [...] are not shown in the film. He described as [...] "brotherly" [...] the relationship Reems <b>shares</b> with Deep <b>Throat</b> co-star Lovelace, explaining that [...] "he was the antithesis of her husband Traynor".|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{particularly}} simple model of axion monodromy: Our axion is the lowest-lying KK-mode of the RR- 2 -form-potential $C_ 2 $ {{in the standard}} Klebanov-Strassler throat. One can think of this inflaton candidate as being defined by the integral of $C_ 2 $ over the $S^ 2 $ cycle of the throat. It obtains an exponentially small mass from the IR-region in which the $S^ 2 $ shrinks to zero size both {{with respect to the}} Planck scale and the mass scale of local modes of the throat. Crucially, the $S^ 2 $ cycle has to be <b>shared</b> between two <b>throats,</b> such that the second locus where the $S^ 2 $ shrinks is also in a warped region. Well-known problems like the potentially dangerous back-reaction of brane/antibrane pairs and explicit supersymmetry breaking are not present in our scenario. However, the inflaton back-reaction starts to deform the geometry strongly once the field excursion approaches the Planck scale. We derive the system of differential equations required to treat this effect quantitatively. Numerical work is required to decide whether back-reaction makes the model suitable for realistic inflation. While we have to leave this crucial issue to future studies, we find it interesting that such a simple and explicit stringy monodromy model allows an originally sub-Planckian axion to go through many periods with full quantitative control before back-reaction becomes strong. Also, the mere existence of our ultra-light throat mode (with double exponentially suppressed mass) is noteworthy.

40|$|Retailers, Wholesalers, Marketers, Alcohol {{distributors}} and Manufacturers continuously {{fight for}} volume growth and market-share gain within the total alcohol market. Most {{of the answers}} of how much each can gain {{over a period of}} time remain a mystery that can only be answered by the consumers. The consumers determine who will have more share of wallet or <b>share</b> of <b>throat</b> more than the other. This is also equally applicable to brands, packs and the various alcohol categories that exist in the market. Why is it important, you possibly wonder? It is important because the alcohol market is an integrated part of our society; it contributes immensely to the South African economy and its value chain is enormous in value. Consumption expenditure increased from R 3 513 039 000 in 2004 to R 8 558 232 000 by 2013 in the Eastern Cape alone. In the last 10 years there has been an increase of new products that are being introduced into the market across all categories ranging from traditional alcoholic brands to flavoured and ready to drink brands. This presents an opportunity to alcohol consumers, alcohol shoppers and sellers alike. This opportunity meant that the consumer is spoilt for choice and retailers / wholesalers have an opportunity to list more brands which could possibly result in increased margins. Further to the above, South African marketers face both market challenges as well as proposed legislation regarding advertising of alcohol products. Some of the challenges include marketing clutter, competition, diverse nature of the South African consumer, infrastructure issues, government legislations, social media and digital platforms. The liquor industry of the Eastern Cape contributes approximately R 7, 7 billion to the Gross Geographic Product of the economy of the Eastern Cape through direct and indirect impacts; Approximately 23 620 permanent jobs are supported by the Eastern Cape liquor industry annually; Tax revenue attributable to the liquor industry in the Eastern Cape is R 3, 9 billion; and the economic impact of the liquor industry on gross capital formation is in the region R 3, 4 billion per annum. The purpose of this research is to optimise the marketing mix to influence consumer purchasing decisions in liquor outlets within the Border district within the above context. The objective of this study is to identify the marketing mix that influences consumer purchasing decisions in liquor outlets. The study will be conducted within the Border district. The Border district consists of various geographies within the Eastern Cape, South Africa. The area of the study will focus on key municipalities namely; Buffalo city, Amathole, Chris Hani and Joe Gqabi municipalities. The target sample size for this study was 360 consumers. A survey questionnaire was used to measure respondents’ preferences, attitudes, motivations and perceptions. The respondents were instructed to highlight the answer that best described them and / or their preferences. Questions were asked and the respondents had to highlight to what extent they agreed or disagreed with the question. Key findings are that there is high level of agreement that price and promotions influence consumer-purchasing decision in liquor outlets. The highest percentage of respondents are in agreement that beer is a first choice of drink and a second is spirits. 69 % of the respondents agree that they change from the usual drink to a different drink when they go out. This can be attributed to the notion that consumers like to badge and want to be seen drinking brands that will be deemed socially acceptable in public, or brands that are the latest trend. The key benefits from the study include improved ability for marketers to reposition brands, give clear recommendations for drinking occasions and better understanding on how to efficiently distribute alcohol portfolios, extend brands and introduce limited editions...|$|R
