25|$|United States {{security}} {{assistance to}} the Palestinian Authority (PA) has been provided since the Palestinian Authority was established by the Oslo Accords in the mid-1990s. The security assistance was given on an adhoc basis and often covert at the outset. Since 2005 the U.S. State Department has provided direct financial and personnel assistance to Palestinian security organizations when they established {{the office of the}} United States <b>Security</b> <b>Coordinator</b> (USSC) for Israel and the Palestinian territories through their Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL). In 2007 the USSC team began training certain Palestinian Authority Security Forces (PASF) including the Palestinian National Security Forces (NSF) and the Presidential Guard with the intent to train, equip, and garrison 10 NSF battalions by the end of 2010. U.S. security {{assistance to the}} Palestinian Authority has expanded over the years and has received praise as well as criticism from American, Palestinian, and Israeli groups.|$|E

Nathan Thrall reports that [...] "overnight, Dayton's task changed from reforming the security forces to preventing a Hamas-led government from controlling them."

30|$|The {{qualitative}} study [4], {{which was}} based on expert interviews at SAP, revealed several factors that impact the issue/vulnerability fix time, such as communication and collaboration issues, experience and knowledge of the involved developers and <b>security</b> <b>coordinators,</b> and technology diversification. The results of this study confirm the impact of some of these factors and show their importance. For example, the category technology diversification included factors related to technologies and libraries supported by the components associated with the given vulnerability. The impact of the component, found in our current study, reflects these underlying factors. Unfortunately, it was only possible to relate components’ attributes to security messages, i.e., post-release issues, not to pre-release issues to further investigate the components’ impact on these. The impact of the development groups reflects the importance of the experience and vulnerability- and software-related knowledge of the teams as well as the importance of the smoothness of communication and collaboration between the involved stakeholders.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{main idea}} {{of this paper is}} to {{illustrate}} the interaction between various kinds of power system operational limits and corrective actions. In particular, the paper focuses on the interplay between line flow limits and active generation redispatch as the corrective action. The proposed methodology handles a wide range of flow limits by explicit inclusion of line flow equations into the set of the system model equations. Four options for active generation redispatch are discussed. The applicability of the methodology in deregulated environments for operating a power system within its security constraints by <b>Security</b> <b>Coordinators</b> or Transmission Providers is discussed. The power system model is based on a computationally efficient point of collapse power flow for tracing steady state behavior due to slow system parameter variations. Results of tests obtained with help of the IEEE- 39 and IEEE- 118 bus systems are given to illustrate the performance of the proposed methodology...|$|R
2500|$|Lieutenant General Michael R. Moeller of the United States Air Force {{served for}} two years as the U.S. <b>Security</b> <b>Coordinator</b> from October 2010 to October 2012. According to his {{official}} military biography, immediately prior to this appointment, Moeller served as Director for Strategy, Plans and Policy for Headquarters U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM). General Moeller {{has served as a}} pilot in operations Desert Storm, Enduring Freedom, and Iraqi Freedom. Since this was designated a [...] "position of importance and responsibility" [...] under United States law (10 USC 601), the incumbent holds the rank of Lieutenant General. Moeller's appointment by the Obama Administration is reported to be an effort to increase coordination between CENTCOM and the USSC program. Additionally, since taking over for Dayton, Lt. Gen. Moeller has kept a low profile, which has been attributed to his desire to smooth relations with the PA, who were quite displeased with his predecessor. On 15 May 2012, Moeller was nominated by the President for reappointment to the grade of Lieutenant General and assignment to a different [...] "position of importance and responsibility". As of 20 December 2012, General Moeller is serving as Deputy Chief of Staff for Strategic Plans and Programs at Headquarters of the U.S. Air Force.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the end of}} Operation Sinbad, the {{military}} situation for the British in Basra worsened and the British base at Basra Palace was repeatedly attacked. [...] However, by summer 2007, Maliki's political position no longer depended on Sadrist support and Muqtada al-Sadr had publicly criticized Maliki. [...] In July 2007 Maliki replaced his Basra security co-ordinator and {{during one of his}} visits to Iraq, Stirrup met the new Basra <b>security</b> <b>coordinator,</b> General Mohan. [...] Mohan wanted the British forces to withdraw from Basra and Stirrup stressed that once British forces had departed, Mohan's Iraqi forces would have to deal with security. [...] Both Mohan and Stirrup were clear that retaining British forces outside Basra would be an insurance policy against a deteriorating situation within Basra as well as give Mohan something additional with which he could threaten the militias. [...] Stirrup was concerned that a redeployment would look as though the British had been [...] "bombed out of Basra" [...] but judged that this was preferable to the significant damage to British military reputation were security in Basra to completely break down. [...] Much of the British redeployment took place in August and despite Stirrup making public statements to the effect that the withdrawal was part of the overall plan, some commentators judged that the British had been defeated in southern Iraq. [...] By early September all British troops had been withdrawn from Basra city to the airport to perform what was dubbed an [...] "overwatch" [...] role.|$|E
2500|$|Following the Roadmap for Peace Agreement (Roadmap) {{arranged}} by President George W. Bush's administration, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice oversaw {{the creation of}} the United States <b>Security</b> <b>Coordinator</b> (USSC) team with the intent to assist the new PA President Mahmoud Abbas in reforming the Palestinian security sector. In March 2005, the Ward Mission was dispatched, headed by Lieutenant General (Lt. Gen.) Kip Ward, to Tel Aviv. This new agency was tasked with supervising and advising the Palestinian security sector and the USSC stated that the U.S. would regard the USSC as the only channel for international security assistance to the PA. The USSC chose to conduct a needs assessment {{with the help of a}} third party American NGO, known as the Strategic Assessments Initiative. The Initiative then created the International Transition Assistance Group (ITAG) to oversee the assessment. ITAG was run by Jarat Chopra and had several international consultants with significant experience with the Palestinian government and the PLO. A Palestinian–International Transitional Security Planning Team (TSPT) was formed in April 2005 as a joint effort between the PA Minister of the Interior General Nasser Youssef, and Lt. Gen. Kip Ward. The Palestinian side was led by Major General Jamal Abu Zayed who was at the time the Assistant Minister of the Interior. Most of the international experts were also part of the ITAG. The primary purpose of the TSPT was to concentrate on the Israeli unilateral disengagement plan from Gaza, working to assess the ability of PA forces to take over security tasks in Gaza and to coordinate security issues with Israel. There were ten meetings held in mid-2005, however there was a major rift in July 2005 after the Security Assessment Initiative's report on the findings of the ISAG assessment was leaked and then formally published. This report: [...] "Planning Considerations for International Involvement in the Palestinian Security Sector" [...] was embarrassing to Palestinian representatives of the TSPT because of its criticism of General Youssef and its emphasis on the corruption and lack of reform in the Palestinian security sector. Ultimately, Lt. Gen. Ward ended ties with the Strategic Assessments Initiative and the ITAG after Israel's disengagement.|$|E
