50|$|The entire rocket is {{suspended}} in the launch system by the load-bearing mechanisms on the <b>strap-on</b> <b>boosters</b> where they {{are attached to the}} central core. The latter rests on the nose sections of the <b>strap-on</b> <b>boosters.</b> This scheme resembles flight conditions when the <b>strap-on</b> <b>boosters</b> push the central core forward. The concept of suspending the rocket was one of the novelties introduced with the R-7/Soyuz.|$|R
50|$|On the PSLV and PSLV-XL, {{first stage}} thrust is {{augmented}} by six <b>strap-on</b> solid <b>boosters.</b> Four boosters are ground-lit {{and the remaining}} two ignite 25 seconds after launch. In the standard PSLV, each booster carries nine tonnes of propellant and produces 510 kN thrust. The PSLV-XL uses larger boosters which carry 12 tonnes of propellant and produce 719 kN thrust. Two <b>strap-on</b> <b>boosters</b> are equipped with SITVC for additional attitude control. The PSLV-CA uses no <b>strap-on</b> <b>boosters.</b>|$|R
50|$|Studied in 1965, {{the same}} year that Project Gemini started, the Saturn IB-C was simply {{designed}} as an orbital launch vehicle like the original Saturn IB. The booster would consist of an ordinary Saturn IB with four Minuteman first stages used as <b>strap-on</b> <b>boosters.</b> The Saturn IB core booster did fly until 1975, but not its <b>strap-on</b> <b>boosters.</b>|$|R

40|$|Various {{types of}} twin <b>strap-on</b> <b>boosters</b> were {{evaluated}} by applying them to a core vehicle. The core vehicle has a clipped delta wing and a simple circular body, and is equipped with five Space Shuttle main engines. The only propellants in the core vehicle are liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen. The <b>strap-on</b> <b>boosters</b> investigated include the current Shuttle solid rocket motors with steel cases and advanced solids with graphite composite filament-wound cases. Also, two types of liquid-oxygen/hydrocarbon boosters were investigated - one pair without crossfeed to the core vehicle and one with. The payloads obtained were tabulated for various assumptions, such as power levels on the core vehicle engines, number of engines, and maximum allowable flight dynamic pressures. The payload for the core vehicle with two filament-wound Shuttle solid rocket <b>strap-on</b> <b>boosters</b> was 83, 000 lb and the payload for two liquid strap-ons with crossfeed was 84, 000 lb. The core vehicle with Shuttle solid rocket <b>strap-on</b> <b>boosters</b> {{is regarded as a}} near term technology system...|$|R

50|$|The Ariane 3 {{followed}} the same basic design as the earlier Ariane 1, but incorporated modifications made for the Ariane 2. Unlike the Ariane 2, two solid-fuelled PAP <b>strap-on</b> <b>booster</b> rockets were used to augment the first stage at liftoff.|$|E
50|$|Although the Soyuz-U is {{generally}} very reliable, occasional failures have happened, {{such as the}} October 2002 launch of a Foton satellite which crashed near the pad at Plesetsk after the Blok D <b>strap-on</b> <b>booster</b> suffered an engine malfunction. One person on the ground was killed.|$|E
50|$|The ninth {{flight of}} a Luna 8K72 (April 1960) failed when the Blok G <b>strap-on</b> <b>booster</b> {{developed}} only 75% thrust at liftoff, breaking {{away from the}} launch vehicle, which then disintegrated, the strap-ons flying in random directions and exploding as they impacted the ground. The Blok A core stage then crashed into a salt lake.|$|E
40|$|Wind tunnel {{tests were}} carried out on 1 : 40 scale PSLV_XL {{configuration}} to determine the separation trajectories of four ground-lit <b>strap-on</b> <b>boosters.</b> Aerodynamic forces and moments were measured on the four boosters simultaneously {{in the presence of}} core vehicle. The tests were conducted in the NAL 1. 2 m wind tunnel using a special test rig in the incidence range of - 8 degree to 8 degree at M= 3. 2 for wind plane angles of 0 degree, - 50 degree and - 90 degree. Few grid tests were also carried out for two air-lit <b>strap-on</b> <b>boosters</b> at M= 3. 2. The Reynolds number based on core body diameter was 2. 3 million. It seems that separation trajectories of all the four <b>strap-on</b> <b>boosters</b> occur without any collision with the core vehicle...|$|R
50|$|Superficially, the UR-700 {{was of the}} {{well-known}} design of Soviet launchers with a central core stack and lateral <b>strap-on</b> <b>boosters.</b> But one distinguishing feature was that the engines of the first stage were cross-fed with fuel and oxidizer from the tanks of the <b>strap-on</b> <b>boosters</b> during the initial flight phase. This meant that when the boosters were spent and jettisoned, the central stack still flew with full tanks, thus reducing dead weight and increasing a possible payload.|$|R

5000|$|The Zenit {{first stage}} {{was used as}} a <b>strap-on</b> <b>booster</b> rocket for the Energia carrier rocket. [...] Four Zenit first stages were {{attached}} to the core vehicle to produce extra thrust at lift-off, {{in the same way that}} Solid Rocket Boosters were used on the US Space Shuttle.

50|$|Luna E-1 No.2 was {{launched}} on 11 October 1958 atop a Luna 8K72 carrier rocket, flying from Site 1/5 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. One hundred and four seconds after launch, longitudinal resonance within the rocket's <b>strap-on</b> <b>booster</b> rockets caused {{the vehicle to}} disintegrate. This was the same problem which had caused the loss of Luna E-1 No.1 three weeks earlier.|$|E
50|$|ISRO has envisaged {{a number}} of {{variants}} of PSLV to cater to different mission requirements. There are currently three operational versions of the PSLV â€” the standard (PSLV), the core-alone (PSLV-CA) without the six <b>strap-on</b> <b>booster</b> motors, and the (PSLV-XL) version, which carries more solid fuel in its strap-on motors than the standard version. These configurations provide wide variations in payload capabilities ranging from 3800 kg in LEO to 1800 kg in Sun-synchronous orbit.|$|E
5000|$|The first GSLV flight, GSLV-D1 {{used the}} L40 engine. Subsequent flights of the GSLV used high {{pressure}} engines in the <b>strap-on</b> <b>boosters</b> called the L40H. [...] The GSLV uses four L40H liquid <b>strap-on</b> <b>boosters</b> {{derived from the}} L37.5 second stage, which are loaded with 42.6 tons of hypergolic propellants (UDMH & N2O4). The propellants are stored in tandem in two independent tanks 2.1 m diameter. The engine is pump-fed and generates 760 kN (150,000 lbf) of thrust, with a burn time of 150 seconds.|$|R
5000|$|... 06:09 UT (T+ 119 s) The four <b>strap-on</b> <b>boosters</b> of the Vostok rocket used up {{the last}} of their {{propellant}} and dropped away from the core vehicle.|$|R
50|$|This variant had 139 t (S-139) {{first stage}} and {{improved}} fuel in the <b>strap-on</b> <b>boosters</b> and second stage. This variant can launch 1900 kg into geostationary transfer orbit.|$|R
5000|$|Okhotsimsky's team, {{along with}} a group managed by Mikhail Tikhonravov at NII-4, did {{analysis}} and optimization of multi-stage rocket designs. Okhotsimsky studied the general problem of how rockets could increase their range by dropping parts of their construction during flight. This included sequential stages and parallel [...] "packet" [...] rockets and schemes involving the pumping of fuel between stages during flight. This led directly {{to the design of}} the R-7 missile and the exact proportions of its <b>strap-on</b> <b>booster</b> stages.|$|E
5000|$|Shelby has {{supported}} {{development of the}} Space Launch System (SLS), but disagreed with how funds for the program have been spent. He favors competition for the <b>strap-on</b> <b>booster</b> design. [...] The SLS earmark has been opposed by fiscal conservative groups, including the Tea Party. [...] When President Obama decided to cancel Constellation, the Bush-era NASA program that was to provide America's next manned rocket and instead give NASA a new $6 billion to ramp up a commercial space industry while NASA studies deep-space missions, Shelby ridiculed the plan as a [...] "faith-based initiative".|$|E

50|$|The {{standard}} {{version of the}} PSLV (PSLV-G) has four stages using solid and liquid propulsion systems alternately and six <b>strap-on</b> <b>boosters.</b> It currently has capability to launch 1,678 kg to 622 km into Sun-synchronous orbit.|$|R
5000|$|The launch {{capability}} of an H-IIA launch vehicle {{can be enhanced}} by adding SRB-A (solid rocket booster or SRB) and Castor 4AXL (solid <b>strap-on</b> <b>booster</b> or SSB) to its basic configuration, creating a [...] "family". The models are indicated by three or four numbers following the prefix [...] "H2A". The first number in the sequence indicates the number of stages; the second number of liquid rocket boosters (LRBs); the third number of SRBs; and, if present, the fourth number shows the number of SSBs. The first two figures are virtually fixed at [...] "20", as H-IIA is always two-staged, and the plans for LRBs were cancelled and superseded by the H-IIB.|$|E
50|$|The R-7 was 34 m long, 3.02 m in {{diameter}} and weighed 280 MT; it had two stages, powered by rocket engines using liquid oxygen (LOX) and kerosene and capable of delivering its payload up to 8800 km, with an accuracy (CEP) of around 5 km. A single thermonuclear warhead was carried with a nominal yield of 3 megatons of TNT. The initial launch was boosted by four strap-on liquid rocket boosters making up the first stage, with a central 'sustainer' motor powering through both {{the first and the}} second stage. Each <b>strap-on</b> <b>booster</b> included two vernier thrusters and the core stage included four. The guidance system was inertial with radio control of the vernier thrusters.|$|E
50|$|PSLV-XL is the {{upgraded}} version of Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle in its standard configuration boosted by more powerful, stretched strap-on boosters. Weighing 320 tonnes at lift-off, the vehicle uses larger strap-on motors (PSOM-XL) to achieve higher payload capability. PSOM-XL uses larger 1-metre diameter, 13.5m length motors, and carries 12 tonnes of solid propellants instead of 9 tonnes {{used in the}} earlier configuration of PSLV. On 29 December 2005, ISRO successfully tested the improved version of <b>strap-on</b> <b>booster</b> for the PSLV. The first version of PSLV-XL was the launch of Chandrayaan-1 by PSLV C11. The payload capability for this variant is 1800 kg compared to 1600 kg for the other variants. Other launches include the RISAT (Radar Imaging Satellite) and GSAT-12.|$|E
50|$|ISRO is also {{considering}} {{the development of}} a three-stage version of the rocket without six <b>strap-on</b> <b>boosters</b> (with the second stage of the four-stage version removed) which will be capable of placing 500 kg to LEO.|$|R
50|$|The Delta IV Medium+ (4,2) (Delta 9240) {{is similar}} to the Medium, but uses two Alliant-built 1.5-m (60-in) {{diameter}} solid rocket booster Graphite-Epoxy Motors (GEM-60s) <b>strap-on</b> <b>boosters</b> to increase payload capacity to 6,150 kg to GTO.|$|R
