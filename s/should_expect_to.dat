This, Chilembwe believed, was the only way change would ever occur.|$|E

25|$|Her {{body was}} {{discovered}} on 20 August 2001 in dense woodland just 50 yards from a busy car park at Lindley Woods near Otley, {{on the border of}} North and West Yorkshire. Post mortem examination indicated that Tiernan's body had only been at the woodland site for a matter of weeks, and had been stored in a cold, dry place for the previous nine months. Following the discovery of her body, DNA samples were taken from 200 people, including family, friends and known sex offenders living in the area. Forensic evidence led police to her killer, John Taylor, who lived only 1,300 yards from Tiernan's home. On 8 July 2002 Taylor pleaded guilty at Leeds Crown Court to her kidnap and murder and received two life sentences, with the trial judge telling him that he <b>should</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> {{spend the rest of his}} life in prison. At the end of his trial, the police officers who brought him to justice spoke of their belief that he may have been responsible for other unsolved murders, including the 1992 murder of Yvonne Fitt, a Bradford prostitute.|$|E

500|$|Chapter one, [...] "Ritual and the archaeologist", {{begins by}} {{describing}} the ritual deposits from the pre-Roman Iron Age sites of Cadbury Castle and Danebury, hillforts in southern Britain. Merrifield laments {{the fact that}} the majority of archaeologists, particularly those studying literate, historical periods, have avoided ritual explanations for unusual phenomenon in the archaeological record; he believes that they exhibit a [...] "ritual phobia". He contrasts this view with that of those archaeologists studying the Neolithic and Bronze Age Britain, who have widely accepted the ritual uses of chambered tombs and stone circles. He specifies particular definitions for words such as [...] "ritual", [...] "religion" [...] and [...] "superstition", arguing that such terms must be used with precision by archaeologists. Offering a case study, he describes how Neolithic stone axes were adopted as amulets or talismans in the later Roman Iron Age onward in Britain, and that as such archaeologists <b>should</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> find them in non-prehistoric contexts.|$|E

[...] It additionally noted that while players <b>should</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> {{have to do some}} grinding, the game offers [...] "lots of little areas to explore." [...] IGN described the game as one that may be [...] "amazingly frustrating for the now mainstream Final Fantasy fan," [...] and noted {{that while the}} unique concept of the job system was one that [...] "simply blew gamers' minds" [...] at the time, in the contemporary environment, comparing it to Final Fantasy XIIs license board system was [...] "literally no contest." [...] The review additionally argued that the remake hampered the game, citing that battles that would take [...] "mere seconds to scroll through" [...] were now [...] "lengthened to nearly a minute." [...] Another complaint was in the game's presentation on the Nintendo DS, noting that the handheld's top screen was inactive for [...] "75% of the game," [...] and that even displaying only artwork on the screen during those periods would have been a preferable outcome. However IGN described the game as [...] "graphically phenomenal and...set to a simply beautiful musical score."

Chris Younie for 4Music wrote that Aguilera is [...] "ramping up the romance and sexual energy" [...] on [...] "Red Hot Kinda Love", which will make the listener {{need to take a}} cold shower. He also wrote that the listener <b>should</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> hear [...] "lots of 'oooh', 'aah', and 'la la la' in her usual Mariah Carey-shrilling manner." [...] Sam Hine for Popjustice described the song as [...] "a welcome blast of upbeat pop following the rather serious start to the album. There are lots of good [...] "oooh" [...] "lalala" [...] hooky bits that all fit together and make a for an enjoyable listen." [...] Andrew Hampp for Billboard described it as the [...] "standout song on Lotus" [...] which sees her [...] "at her most relaxed and playful." [...] He also noted that Secon's production takes [...] "precedence" [...] on the song. Annie Zaleski for The A.V. Club called it a [...] "dancehall-tinged, vibrant party jam," [...] while Sarah Rodman for The Boston Globe named it a [...] "kooky horn-and-yodel fest". Robert Copsey for Digital Spy described the song as [...] "care-free" [...] and [...] "a bit cheeky." [...] Sarah Godfrey for The Washington Post praised Aguilera for sounding more like herself on the [...] "frenzied" [...] track. Jim Farber for Daily News wrote that [...] "Red Hot Kinda Love" [...] contains [...] "a can't-miss gimmick of a chorus". He also wrote that Aguilera [...] "hits the clubs in horny revenge." ...|$|E

"Good Jupiters" [...] are gas giants, {{like the}} Solar System's Jupiter, that orbit their stars in {{circular}} orbits {{far enough away}} from the habitable zone not to disturb it but close enough to [...] "protect" [...] terrestrial planets in closer orbit in two critical ways. First, they help to stabilize the orbits, and thereby the climates of the inner planets. Second, they keep the inner stellar system relatively free of comets and asteroids that could cause devastating impacts. Jupiter orbits the Sun at about five times the distance between the Earth and the Sun. This is the rough distance we <b>should</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> find good Jupiters elsewhere.
