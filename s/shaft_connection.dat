50|$|Epicyclic gearing or {{planetary}} gearing is a gear system consisting {{of one or}} more outer gears, or planet gears, revolving about a central, or sun gear. Typically, the planet gears are mounted on a movable arm or carrier, which itself may rotate relative to the sun gear. Epicyclic gearing systems also incorporate the use of an outer ring gear or annulus, which meshes with the planet gears. Planetary gears (or epicyclic gears) are typically classified as simple or compound planetary gears. Simple planetary gears have one sun, one ring, one carrier, and one planet set.

40|$|Enlarged (Type II) {{pile shaft}} {{foundations}} are used frequently in reinforced concrete bridges {{because of the}} convenience in construction and efficiency in post- earthquake inspection and repair. According to the specifications of the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), the diameter of a Type II shaft {{should be at least}} 610 mm (2 ft) larger than that of the column. Hence, the column reinforcement extended into the pile shaft can be perceived as forming a non-contact splice with the pile shaft reinforcement. Because of the lack of data, the seismic design specifications of Caltrans on the embedment length of column reinforcement in Type II shafts are very conservative for large-diameter columns, which could complicate the construction work and entail high construction costs. This dissertation presents an experimental and analytical investigation to characterize the bond between concrete and reinforcing steel when a reinforced concrete member is subjected to severe cyclic loading, and determine the minimum embedment length required for column longitudinal reinforcement extended into a Type II shaft. Experiments were carried out to investigate the bond strength and cyclic bond deterioration of large-diameter bars (No. 11, 14, and 18) commonly used in large-diameter bridge columns and piles. The experimental results have been used to develop, calibrate, and validate a phenomenological bond-slip model for bars embedded in well-confined concrete. The model successfully reproduces bond deterioration caused by cyclic bar-slip reversals and tensile yielding of the bar, and has been implemented in an interface element in a finite element program. A physics-based dilatant interface model formulated with a multi-surface plasticity concept has also been developed and implemented in the finite element program to simulate bond-slip under a broad range of confinement situations. With the phenomenological bond- slip model, nonlinear finite element analysis has been conducted to extrapolate results of development length tests conducted on large-diameter bars, and assess the reliability of the development lengths required in the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications. Finally, two large-scale tests on column-pile shaft assemblies were conducted. The tests were combined with finite element analysis to evaluate the conservatism of the current Caltrans specifications, and provide new design recommendations that can significantly reduce the embedment length required for column reinforcement, while ensuring an appropriate performance of the column-pile <b>shaft</b> <b>connections</b> under severe seismic load...|$|R

40|$|Technological {{advances}} in the aerospace industry have improved aircraft efficiency and reduced the cost of air transport, leading since 1960 to a continuous growth of the worldwide air traffic. Today it is postulated that also into the foreseeable future both the passenger and cargo air traffic will continue to growth, increasing the CO 2 air transport emissions. In this contest, there are many environmental as well as commercial pressures on aircraft manufacturers to improve performances of future aircraft in terms of safety, air pollution, noise and climate change. To achieve these goals, it is necessary revisiting the whole aircraft architecture system, {{with the introduction of}} new technologies for performing key functions on aircraft. Today the conventional civil aircraft are characterized by four different secondary power distribution systems: mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic and electrical. This implies a complex power distribution nets aboard, and the necessity of an appropriate redundancy of each of them. In order to reduce this complexity, with the aim to improve efficiency and reliability, the aerospace designer community trend is towards the `More Electric Aircraft (MEA) ' concept, that is the wider adoption of electrical systems in preference to the others. This solution involves an increase of the aircraft electrical loads and, as a consequence, heavy implications for the on-board electrical generation systems are predictable. The resulting increase of the electrical power requirements encourage the research of alternative solutions rather than simply scaling up existing technologies such as generators driven by gearboxes. To address these challenges, many studies are {{in the direction of the}} so called `More Electric Engine (MEE) ', in which the electrical machines are integrated inside the main gas turbine engine to generate electrical power, start the engine and guarantee safety generation in case of a critical on-flight failure. In this way the mechanical gearbox which connects the actual generators to the aeroengine shaft can be eliminated. The MEA and the MEE concept can be considered as an evolutionary implementation of the `All Electric Aircraft (AEA) ', in which all the aircraft on-board systems are supplied in an electrical form. The MEE concept will involve important mechanical and thermodynamic implications in the aeroengine design, making necessary a preliminary system analysis on today conventional aeroengine, in order to evaluate the integration feasibility with the actual mechanical and environmental constraints. The electrical machines can be integrated inside the engine in some different positions, either in the front part before the combustion chamber, in particular in the low-pressure or in the high-pressure compressor stages, or in the rear part of the engine, in the tail-cone zone. In the frame of the GREAT 2020 (GReen Engine for Air Transport in 2020) project co-founded by Regione Piemonte, aimed to the development of new eco-compatible aircraft engines for the entry into service in 2020, the MEE concept focus is on the evaluation of the most suitable solution between four possible integration positions in the front part of the today conventional two-shaft GEnx turbofan engine. The rotational speeds and the maximum available volumes are respectively imposed by the <b>shaft</b> <b>connection</b> and by the available spaces inside the aeroengine. In the purpose of the MEE concept on which the work presented in this dissertations is based, in order to evaluate the less critical solution between the proposed, a trade-off study conducted on preliminary electromagnetic design has been performed considering both radial and axial flux surface mounted permanent magnet synchronous machines. The comparison of the different solutions have been done on the base of same sizing indexes. Due to the particular application in which the electrical machine integration is involved, in order to evaluate impact on the whole system performance, a wider trade-off study concerning the overall aeroengine system has been done by the aerospace company Avio, partner of the GREAT 2020 project. The focus of the work presented in this dissertation, is the development of appropriate tools to perform a preliminary electromagnetic design of radial and axial flux, surface mounted, permanent magnet synchronous machines with three-phase distributed and single-layer fractional-slot non-overlapping concentrated windings. In particular, this latter winding topology has been considered for its specific application for its shorter end-winding connections respect to the distributed layout, and for their high fault tolerant capability due to the electrical and physical separation between the phases which reduces the possibility of a fault propagation. Regarding the radial flux topologies, both inner and outer rotor machine structures have been considered; for the axial flux machines the single-stage (one stator and one rotor) as well as the multi-stage structures, obtained connecting on the same axis more than one single-stage structure, have been considered. The developed general purpose tools are based on simple geometrical approach using conventional design equations. The geometrical dimensions are computed starting from the design specifications and material utilization indexes imposed by the designer. The implemented codes would be a useful tool for the electrical machine designer in order to quickly define a preliminary electromagnetic design starting from a fresh sheet of paper. The conducted comparisons with commercial software have proved the validity of the tools for the conducted MEE trade-off study; however, in a prototype design aimed to the construction, detailed analysis using commercial software available on the market and Finite Element Method analysis have to be done in order to verify and improve in details the preliminary electromagnetic design obtained by the implemented code...|$|E

The P 3 G and P 4 C shaft and hub have been compared for interference, line to line and clearance fit. The conformal contact between the shaft and the hub in polygonal profile makes it difficult to design them analytically.

The clearance fit was found to be the most detrimental fit and interference fit to be the most suitable for larger power transmission.

The variation of the preload for clamping connections can be predicted if the temperature-dependent elasticity of the shape-memory element is known. The experimental results for longitudinal pressfit connections match the extended theoretical elastic plastic model. The load transfer is characterized by considerable slip between shaft and collar even if small loads are applied. This results in huge hysteresis for cyclic loading.

Considering that nest architecture is an important behavioural trait that can clarify essential points of the social level of the species, here we describe the architectural model of the Ponerinae ant Odontomachus chelifer. Five subterranean nests were excavated; one of them filled with liquid cement for extraction of casts of chambers, shafts and tunnels. All nests were found in a woodland area, with Dystrophic Red Latosol soil, associated with roots of large trees and, differently from the pattern currently described for this subfamily, presented a complex structure with multiple entrances {{and more than one}} vertical shaft connected by tunnels to relatively horizontal chambers. The number of chambers varied from 24 to 77, with mean volume ranging from 200. 09 cm 3 to 363. 79 cm 3, and maximum depth of 134 cm. Worker population varied between 304 and 864 individuals with on average 8. 28 cm 2 of area per worker. All nests had at least one Hall, which is a relatively larger chamber serving as a distribution centre of the nest, and to our knowledge, there is no record of Ponerinae species building similar structure. All nests had chambers "paved" with pieces of decaying plant material and on the floor of some of them, we found a fungus whose identification and function are being investigated.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to study the effectiveness of a typical oilfield corrosion inhibitor, which {{is considered to be a}} green inhibitor (non toxic to the environment) in controlling internal corrosion of welded X 65 pipeline steel in brines saturated with carbon dioxide at one bar pressure, under dynamic flowing conditions, over a range of temperatures. Several experimental configurations were used ranging from a simple flat plate design to a novel rotating cylinder electrode, to allow high shear stress to be achieved. The rotating cylinder electrode (RCE) apparatus was designed to allow steel from the weld metal, heat affected zone (HAZ) and parent material to be galvanically coupled and tested in high shear stress conditions. In producing the RCE, the three regions of the weld were identified by optical metallography and samples of each were machined to produce cylindrical electrodes, which were mounted on a motor driven <b>shaft.</b> Electrical <b>connections</b> were made to the three electrodes via a high quality slip-ring assembly. The galvanic currents flowing between the regions of the weld were recorded using zero-resistance ammeters and their self-corrosion rates were found by uncoupling the electrodes and performing polarization resistance measurements. For static conditions the inhibitor had an effective performance and after a short initial period during which film formation took place, at longer exposure times a dramatic reduction of corrosion rate was obtained. Under flowing conditions, both the galvanic currents and the self-corrosion rates were found to increase with the shear stress, as the rotational speed of the RCE was increased. The total corrosion rate of each weld region was assessed from the sum of the self-corrosion and galvanic contributions. In most cases, the weld metal and HAZ were shown to be cathodic to the parent material and this was considered to be a desirable situation as localised corrosion of the weld was minimised. However, in some circumstances, including inhibition of pre-corroded steel surfaces, a current reversal took place, which resulted in accelerated corrosion of the weld. These findings are explained in terms of the protective nature of the films that form on each region of the weld. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

Using precast bridge elements is one solution. However, achieving good connections between precast elements is challenging, particularly in seismically hazardous areas, like the Pacific Northwest, in which the largest forces are developed at the beam-to-column or column-to-footing connections. Therefore, the connections need to {{be strong enough to}} resist seismic excitation and easy to construct with high quality.

Two specimens were fabricated and tested at the University of Washington. The only difference between the two specimens was the amount of spiral reinforcement in the column-to-shaft transition region, which was reduced by half in the second specimen. The goal was to promote failure in the shaft transition region in the second specimen, in order to develop an understanding of the load transfer mechanism there.

Shrink fitted testing is not standard and common as the bridge type test, however, the round geometry implies no edge effect, the shrinkage and the bending loads can be carefully controlled with strain gages, and the stress distribution easily calculated with finite element analyses. Though the shrink fit compressive state, the cyclic bending introduces tensile stresses, hence the introduction of compressive residual stresses can play a significant role to prevent the initiation and the propagation of the fretting fatigue cracks. Experimental results are reported in the paper where the fretting fatigue strength was remarkably improved after a deep rolling treatment. Numerical analyses even predicted the complete mode I closure of potential fretting fatigue cracks by taking into account the compressive residual stresses. SEM investigation showed how the crack pattern was significantly different with deep rolling, having multiple crack initiation sites and then either coalescence or crack branching. From the modelling point of view, the paper shows that the self-arrest theory cannot be used to assess the fretting fatigue strength, for deep rolled specimens, where the crack remains closed. A better prediction can be obtained with a critical plane multiaxial fatigue criterion, based on the shear stress amplitude, which under a compressive stress state can be more effectively assumed as the driving force of the crack. Consistently the orientation of the plane experiencing the maximum shear stress amplitude was found in agreement with the observed initial crack direction...|$|R
40|$|Robotic {{arms are}} {{indispensable}} tools in both industry and education. The robotic arm currently {{used in the}} MIT class 2. 12, Introduction to Robotics, {{is in need of}} revision. The arm is heavy, imprecise, bulky, and difficult to customize. The new design presented in this thesis resolves these issues while making the arm more user-friendly and inexpensive enough for classroom use. It uses Hitec HS- 805 BB hobby servo motors to directly drive each joint. Controlling these motors is effortless with the many commercially available servo motor drivers. Modular construction allows students to change the shape and size of the arm's workspace easily; creating and installing custom linkages is a simple task. Linkages and motor output shafts mount to a common <b>connection</b> <b>shaft</b> with one-sided cut hubs. The radial loads in these shafts are supported by maintenance-free Super Oilite bronze bearings. This robotic arm is better suited for a classroom environment than the current one. It weighs 2. 7 pounds; the old one weight 21. 2 pounds. Though its workspace and recommended linkage length are about 7 % smaller than those of the old design are, it is 87 % more precise. (cont.) It is 60 % cheaper with a materials cost of $ 120 for a two degree of freedom arm. The new motors have 343 oz-in of torque, which is sufficient to handle a 12 oz payload 17 inches from the joint axis or a 16 oz payload at 14 inches. Students will spend less time connecting wires and calibrating sensors. This arm should be a welcome addition to the introductory robotics classroom. by David Lafferty. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|Polygonal shafts {{are a major}} {{competitor}} {{to spline}} and keyed shafts for power transmission due to features as self-centering, lack of stress concentration area, and ease of assembly and disassembly. Past studies on polygonal profiles have focused on a single profile and comparisons based on nominal sizes of three and four lobe profiles. This research explores the loading strength of the standardized three and four lobe polygonal shafts and hubs manufactured from the same stock size, subjected to pure torsional and torsional bending load from a spur gear of 20 ° pressure angle at various fits. In absence of analytical solution, Finite element method has been used after verifying the results experimentally, theoretically, and DIN standard. From the finite element analysis, the hub was found to experience greater stress than the shaft in all cases. The clearance fit {{was found to be}} the most critical connection and interference fit to be the most suitable for larger power transmission. The P 4 C connection had greater stress, especially in the hub, than the P 3 G connection. The difference between the P 4 C shaft and the P 3 G shaft was 4. 05 % in the interference fit and 60. 6 % in the clearance fit, suggesting P 4 C clearance fit to be less favorable for larger power transmission. Owing to its small normal axial stress, the P 4 C clearance fit has its use in low power transmission where sliding fit is a requirement. The reason for greater stress in P 4 C <b>shaft</b> and hub <b>connection</b> is due to the large pressure angle at the point of contact, which leads to a smaller contact area and greater contact pressure. The contact pressure was found to be triangular shaped in clearance and transition fit and with a large crest, followed by a trough and a small crest in interference fit for torsional bending load...|$|R
