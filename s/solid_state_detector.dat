The phosphor detector records the X-ray energy during exposure and is scanned by a laser diode to excite the stored energy which is released and read out by a digital image capture array of a CCD.|$|E
50|$|The TET {{consists}} of eight solid state detectors with different thicknesses of tungsten between each detector. The detectors and tungsten layers are stacked {{one on top}} of each other. The tungsten layers range from 0.56 mm to 2.34 mm thick and function as absorbers. Each TET <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>detector</b> has an area of 4.5 cm2 and is 3 mm thick.|$|E
50|$|Infrared {{and optical}} {{astronomy}} are often practiced {{using the same}} telescopes, as the same mirrors or lenses are usually effective over a wavelength range that includes both visible and infrared light. Both fields also use <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>detectors,</b> though the specific type of <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>detectors</b> used are different. Infrared light is absorbed at many wavelengths by water vapor in the Earth's atmosphere, so most infrared telescopes are at high elevations in dry places, above {{as much of the}} atmosphere as possible. There are also infrared observatories in space, including the Spitzer Space Telescope and the Herschel Space Observatory.|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] A new {{mixed signal}} {{integrated}} circuit (IC) for frontend readout electronics of position sensitive <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>detectors</b> has been developed. It is called RENA- 2 {{and can be}} used for readout of position sensitive <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>detectors</b> such as CdTe, CdZnTe, Ge, GaAs, HgI 2, PbI 2, Se and Si strip, pad and pixel detectors, with large numbers of channels. It is designed to have very low noise and, therefore, high energy resolution. It has numerous possible applications in astrophysics, medical and industrial imaging, security such as baggage inspection and nuclear physics. The RENA- 2 chip is a monolithic integrated circuit and has 36 channels with low noise, high input impedance charge sensitive amplifiers. The RENA- 2 chip can be optimized for individual applications. I...|$|R
50|$|By {{the use of}} conical foil optics, {{developed}} in our lab, the response of a grazing incidence X-ray telescope was extended to 12 keV, amply covering the crucial iron K-band of emission. A cooled Si(Li) <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>detector</b> was used at the focus of such a telescope for the BBXRT (Broad Band X-Ray Telescope) on the Astro-1 shuttle mission (STS-35) on Columbia in December 1990, the first broadband (0.3-12keV) X-ray observatory to use focusing optics.|$|E

50|$|MENA: Medium energy ENAs {{would lose}} too much energy {{penetrating}} the film {{used in the}} HENA instrument. The thinner film required would be vulnerable to damage by incident UV and EUV. Therefore, photons are prevented from entering the instrument by using a gold diffraction grating. An ultra thin carbon film is mounted {{on the back of}} the grating. ENAs pass through the grating and the film to impact a <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>detector</b> (SSD), scattering electrons and allowing path length and TOF determinations as for the HENA above.|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] Single photon {{emission}} computed tomography (SPECT) {{is a widely}} used medical imaging technique, both for clinical (human) and preclinical (small animal) use to obtain in vivo functional information. Recently, effort {{has been devoted to}} the development of <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>detectors</b> for scintillation cameras because they are lighter, smaller, and more reliable than the photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) commonly used. However, a significant disadvantage of most <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>detectors</b> is that they require pixellization to produce position resolution, which greatly increases the number of amplifier channels and the cost of a detector with a large enough area for medical imaging. New position sensitive avalanche photodiodes (PSAPDs) can produce submillimeter position resolution over a relatively wide area with a small number of amplifier channels and therefore have the potential to replace PMTs in scintillator based gamma-ra...|$|R
40|$|The {{measurement}} of radon using <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> nuclear track <b>detectors</b> is presented. The importance of radon in environmental radiation and {{to human health}} is well known and thus the measurement and evaluation of indoor radon is important not only for dosimetry purposes but also for evaluation of public health impacts. In this work we discuss the detection and calibration systems and the etching method of <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>detectors.</b> Some considerations regarding potential problems that can be encountered in measuring indoor radon in an underdeveloped country, and {{how can they be}} solved are discussed...|$|R
50|$|HENA: TOF is {{determined}} by a coincidence detection requirement {{that turns out to}} be efficient at eliminating photon background noise as well. An ENA passes through a thin film to a particle energy detector with its energy nearly completely preserved. At the same time, electrons forward scattered from the film are electrostatically deflected to a detector to create a start pulse. The ENA arriving at its <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>detector</b> (SSD) creates the end pulse and its impact position yields its trajectory and therefore path length. The start and stop signals enable TOF to be determined.|$|E
5000|$|Only {{the very}} highest quality lenses have {{diffraction}} limited resolution, however, and normally {{the quality of}} the lens limits its ability to resolve detail. This ability is expressed by the Optical Transfer Function which describes the spatial (angular) variation of the light signal as a function of spatial (angular) frequency. When the image is projected onto a flat plane, such as photographic film or a <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>detector,</b> spatial frequency is the preferred domain, but when the image is referred to the lens alone, angular frequency is preferred. OTF may be broken down into the magnitude and phase components as follows: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{scientific}} instruments consisted of an ion chamber and Geiger-MÃ¼ller tube to measure total radiation flux, a proportional radiation counter telescope to measure high energy radiation, a scintillation counter to monitor low-energy radiation, a scintillation spectrometer {{to study the}} Earth's (and possible lunar) radiation belts, a VLF receiver for natural radio waves, a transponder to study electron density, {{and part of the}} flux-gate and search coil magnetometers mounted on the instrument platform. A plasma probe was mounted on the sphere to measure energy and momentum distribution of protons above a few kilovolts to study the radiation effect of solar flares. The micrometeorite detector and sun scanner were mounted on the sphere as well. The only difference between Pioneer P-31 and the earlier Pioneer P-30 was the addition of a <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>detector</b> sensitive to low energy protons on the satellite and an STL-designed rubidium frequency standard experiment placed on a pod attached to the booster. The total mass of the science package including electronics and power supply was roughly 60 kg. Total cost of the mission was estimated at 9-10 million dollars.|$|E
40|$|Three {{types of}} analog-to-digital {{converters}} are described: parallel, successive-approximation, and integrating. The functioning of comparators and sample-and-hold amplifiers is explained. Differential and integral linearity are defined, and {{good and bad}} examples are illustrated. The applicability and relative advantages of {{the three types of}} converters for precision astronomical photometric measurements are discussed. For most measurements, integral linearity is more important than differential linearity. Successive-approximation converters should be used with multielement <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>detectors</b> because of their high speed, but dual slope integrating converters may be superior for use with single element <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>detectors</b> where speed of digitization is not a factor. In all cases, the input signal should be tailored so that they occupy {{the upper part of the}} converter's dynamic range; this can be achieved by providing adjustable gain, or better by varying the integration time of the observation if possible...|$|R

50|$|Another {{method of}} {{detection}} for ERDA is time of flight (TOF)-ERD. This method does not present the same issues, as those for the silicon detector. However, the throughput of TOF detectors is limited; the detection is performed in a serial fashion (one ion in the detector at a time). The longer the TOF for ions, the better the time resolution (equivalent to energy resolution) will be. TOF spectrometers that have an incorporated <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>detector</b> must be confined to small solid angles. When performing HI-ERDA, TOF detectors are often used and/or âE/E detectors-such as ionization chambers. These types of detectors usually implement small solid angles for higher depth resolution. Figure 6, on the left, shows a Time-of-Flight detector commonly used in ERDA. Heavier ions have a longer flight time than the lighter ions. Detectors in modern time-of-flight instruments have improved sensitivity, temporal and spatial resolution, and lifetimes. Hi mass bipolar (high mass ion detection), Gen 2 Ultra Fast (twice as fast as traditional detectors), and High temperature (operated up to 150 Â°C) TOF {{are just a few}} of the commercially available detectors integrated with time-of-flight instruments. Linear and reflectron-TOF are the more common instruments used.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} a portable system for mammographic x-ray spectroscopy, {{based on a}} 2 Ã 2 Ã 1 mm 3 cadmium telluride (CdTe) <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>detector,</b> that is greatly improved over a similar system based on a 3 Ã 3 Ã 2 mm 3 cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>detector</b> evaluated in an earlier work. The CdTe system utilized new pinhole collimators and an alignment device that facilitated measurement of mammographic x-ray spectra. Mammographic x-ray spectra acquired by each system were comparable. Half value layer measurements obtained using an ion chamber agreed closely with those derived from the x-ray spectra measured by either detector. The faster electronics and other features of the CdTe detector allowed its use with a larger pinhole collimator than could be used with the CZT detector. Additionally, the improved pinhole collimator and alignment features of the apparatus permitted much more rapid setup for acquisition of x-ray spectra than was possible on the system described in the earlier work. These improvements in detector technology, collimation and ease of alignment, as well as low cost, make this apparatus attractive {{as a tool for}} both laboratory research and advanced mammography quality control...|$|E
