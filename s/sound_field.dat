40|$|The {{two main}} {{approaches}} for {{the description of}} <b>sound</b> <b>fields</b> are methods derived from solutions of the wave equation and geometric methods based on analogies to ray optics. Their mathematical representations are reviewed and it is shown that representations by projective geometry and descriptions by Fourier acoustics lead to similar para-metric representations of <b>sound</b> <b>fields.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|The {{merits of}} various {{numerical}} and experimental methods for computing <b>sound</b> <b>fields</b> radiated from vibrating structures are examined. The finite difference method, the finite element method, direct boundary element method, indirect boundary element near-field acoustic holography, two-microphone methods, and spatial transformation of <b>sound</b> <b>fields</b> are considered. The proper {{utilization of the}} methods is discussed...|$|R
25|$|The <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> may {{be similar}} to that created by oscillatory flow from a pipe, except for {{presence}} of the supersonic jet structure which can strongly modify the directivity. The original equation of Hartmann is shown below.|$|E
25|$|In these whistles, {{the flow}} {{instability}} is asymmetric, often resulting in rows of alternate vortices {{and the sound}} generation is associated with fluctuations of applied force. The <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> {{is as close to}} a dipole source as local geometry allows.|$|E
25|$|Based on a Strouhal {{number of}} 0.20, the {{characteristic}} dimension δ was calculated {{to be near}} ¼ inch; the boundary layer thickness. A dipole <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> was created at the trailing edge due to the fluctuating force exerted on it.|$|E

25|$|The {{equation}} above indicated 146Hz and the Nielsen equation indicated 138Hz. Clearly, {{the whistle}} was {{being driven by}} a cavity resonance. This {{is an example of}} a whistle being driven in edge tone fashion but the result is a monopole <b>sound</b> <b>field.</b>|$|E
25|$|In these whistles, {{the flow}} {{instability}} is symmetric, often resulting in periodic ring vortices {{and the sound}} generation is associated with fluctuations of volumetric (mass) flow rates. The <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> {{is as close to}} the directivity of an actual monopole source as local geometry allows.|$|E
25|$|This whistle has {{dozens of}} popular names. Pipes with {{sinusoidal}} variations of radius are often created to permit bending. Steady {{flow through the}} pipe at low Reynolds numbers results in a fluctuating volumetric flow rate that generates a monopole-like <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> at the pipe exit. Examples of such pipes {{are shown in figure}} on the right.|$|E
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{theoretical model}} has been developed for interior <b>sound</b> <b>fields</b> which are created by flexible wall motion resulting from exterior <b>sound</b> <b>fields.</b> Full coupling between the wall and interior acoustic cavity is permitted. An efficient computational method is used to determine acoustic natural frequencies of multiply connected cavities. Simplified formulae are developed for interior sound levels in terms of cavity, wall and external acoustic field parameters. Comparisons of theory and experiment show generally good agreement...|$|R
40|$|The fast {{multipole}} BEM (FMBEM), {{which is}} an efficient BEM {{with the use of}} the fast multipole method (FMM), has been well known and applied a lot in the field of acoustics. This paper deals with the FMBEM analysis of <b>sound</b> <b>fields</b> in porous materials. In the FMBEM, it is of a great importance to evaluate the multipole expansion of Green’s function (or its integral representation) with high accuracy. As is the same for real wavenumbers, the expansion is mathematically valid for complex ones used for <b>sound</b> <b>fields</b> in porous materials, whereas its numerical behavior has not been well known. Firstly, we investigate numerical errors of multipole expansions of Green’s functions with complex wavenumbers through a numerical experiment. Secondly, based on the previous numerical results we propose a setting to obtain sufficient accuracy in the FMBEM calculation of <b>sound</b> <b>fields</b> in porous materials. Thirdly, we calculate <b>sound</b> <b>fields</b> filled with porous materials using three methods, i. e., the standard BEM and the FMBEM with/without the above setting, and compare these results to validate the setting. Lastly, we apply the domain decomposition approach in the three methods to calculate acoustic impedance and normal incident absorption coefficients in an impedance tube, and compare these results to the theoretical values. ...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{benefits}} of thermal comfort provided by rooftop equipment such as air-conditioning equipment, vibratory equipment can cause problems in indoor acoustical environment. The building structure where the rooftop equipment is placed vibrates and emits sound into indoor space. Although considerable engineering works such as installation of vibration isolators are employed, {{the amount of the}} sound emitted by the building structure into the indoor space is still unclear. In order to reduce the interior noise levels at the design stage, it would be valuable if a computer-modeling technique could be employed to simulate the indoor <b>sound</b> <b>fields</b> caused by external vibratory forces imposed {{on the top of the}} room space. The aims of the present study are therefore to model the interior <b>sound</b> <b>fields</b> due to vibratory rooftop equipment; and investigate the possibility of predicting and controlling the interior <b>sound</b> <b>fields</b> by computer modeling technique.

25|$|Wilson, et al., {{in their}} study of human {{whistling}} (see below), pointed out the importance of including the symmetry or asymmetry of the unstable flow in addition to the feedback classes listed below. Because of the close relationship of flow symmetry to the <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> generated, their concept was included here as part of the sound source description (monopole -symmetric and dipole - asymmetric).|$|E
25|$|The {{disturbance}} in the jet is a symmetric vortex ring that moves at some speed {{slower than the}} mean jet speed until it encounters the hole and some fluid is forced through it, resulting in a monopole-like <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> in the half space outside. The oscillatory volumetric flow in the hole sends a wave back to the orifice to complete the feedback loop and causing a nearly pure tone.|$|E
25|$|The {{uniformity}} of the measured <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> for this whistle confirmed its monopole-like nature. Measurements of speed {{dependence of the}} sound level showed it to be very close to U4, further confirming the monopole nature of the source. At these speeds and spacings, the feedback was normally Class II, but reflecting surfaces {{as far away as}} three meters and with proper phasing, controlled the tone, converting the feedback to Class III.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{experimental}} technique for the decomposition of broadband ducted <b>sound</b> <b>fields</b> into their mode constituents {{is applied to}} two laboratory scale experimental setups. The broadband mode analysis technique is based on spectral coherences. In both cases, incoherent broadband <b>sound</b> <b>fields</b> were excited {{by means of a}} loudspeaker array. The results derived from the basic setup S 1 were validated successfully with analytical findings. The second setup S 2 mimics the fundamental arrangement in an aero-engine exhaust, con-sisting of a broadband sound source (an annular combustor ring) and a turbomachinery stage (the LP turbine). In between, microphone arrays are arranged to acquire the broad-band <b>sound</b> <b>fields.</b> Sample results of setup S 2 are presented analyzed by means of the new technique. The experimental outcome proves the usefulness of the analysis technique to help interpreting and understanding broadband sound propagation in turbomachinery flow ducts. I...|$|R

25|$|It {{appears that}} this whistle {{has only two}} stages. The <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> was {{measured}} and clearly indicated a dipole whose axis was aligned with the jet axis. Since there were no reflecting surfaces near the source, the data also indicated that a weaker radial dipole component also existed. Such a field can only exist {{if there is a}} time delay at a distant point between each of the force components.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of whistle {{phenomena}} in which heat plays a role. The temperature in a sound wave varies, but since it is so small normally it is common to neglect its effects. When amplification can occur a small variation can grow and have important influence on the <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> created. The most well known thermal whistle is the Rijke tube. Peter Rijke placed a heated a gauze material inside a vertical tube.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of a dipole <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> and a periodic force proportional to U2 was confirmed by Powell. Numerical simulations of the edge tone and extensive references {{can be found in}} a NASA report. The lower figure on the right may be called a wake edge tone. If the preferred frequencies of the trailing edge instability match the preferred frequencies of the free edge tone, a stronger dipole sound should arise. There does not appear to be any research on this configuration.|$|E
40|$|Factors {{affecting}} {{individual differences}} in subjective preferences for various <b>sound</b> <b>fields</b> are discussed. The relations between temporal and spatial factors of <b>sound</b> <b>fields</b> and the {{individual differences in}} preferences for those fields were investigated by evaluating several characteristics of the 408 subjects in preference tests that were conducted in a sound simulation room {{over a period of}} four years. As the subjective preference for temporal factors is closely related to the effective duration of a sound source, ten different music pieces were used for the preference tests. The results show that, for each music piece, the most-preferred values of temporal factors can be predicted from the effective duration. Preference differences due to musical experiences were investigated by comparing the responses of test subjects with and without extensive musical experience. The experienced subjects preferred smaller values of temporal factors than did the inexperienced subjects did, and all subjects preferred <b>sound</b> <b>fields</b> with smaller IACC...|$|R

25|$|An {{interior}} vortex of {{this type}} would explain why no frequency jumps occur. Since the excess fluid in the cavity must be discharged, the jet lateral movement must be considerably larger than that found in the edge tone; this is likely {{the reason for the}} high level sound. The flow over the edge results in an applied force and a dipole-like <b>sound</b> <b>field.</b> The characteristic speed must be U the jet exit speed. The characteristic dimension must be D, the cavity diameter.|$|E
25|$|When two {{vortices}} {{are equidistant}} from the ring, one being beyond {{and the other}} approaching, the net circulation around the ring is zero; the null point for the flow oscillation. Each vortex creates a circular (ring) flow field whose axis varies slightly from the vertical as it passes. The figure suggests that {{the main component of}} the force on the physical ring is {{in the direction of the}} jet flow. If the vortex is a true ring (all parts are in phase), a dipole <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> directed along the jet axis is created.|$|E
25|$|Another {{characteristic}} length associated with sound power is αL, {{the position of}} the gauze. The characteristic speed must be the convection speed u at the heat source. For detailed study of the whistle, see Matveev. Since the first mode resonance is about half-wave, the <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> emitted from the tube is from two in-phase monopole-like sources, one at either end. A gas flame inside a tube can drive resonance; it was called a singing flame. There is a reverse Rijke Tube when hot air passes through a cold grid.|$|E
