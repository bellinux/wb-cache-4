5|$|Although {{the astronomical}} armillary sphere (representing the {{celestial}} sphere) existed in China since the 1st century BCE, the mathematician and court astronomer Zhang Heng (78–139 CE) provided it with motive power {{by using the}} constant pressure head of an inflow water clock to rotate a waterwheel that acted on a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>gears.</b> Zhang Heng {{was also the first}} {{to address the problem of}} the falling pressure head in the inflow water clock (which gradually slowed the timekeeping) by setting up an additional tank between the reservoir and inflow vessel.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{archaeology}} {{has led to}} {{the discovery}} of Han artwork portraying inventions which were otherwise absent in Han literary sources. This includes the crank handle. Han pottery tomb models of farmyards and gristmills possess the first known depictions of crank handles, which were used to operate the fans of winnowing machines. The machine was used to separate chaff from grain, but the Chinese of later dynasties also employed the crank handle for silk-reeling, hemp-spinning, flour-sifting, and drawing water from a well using the windlass. To measure distance traveled, the Han-era Chinese also created the odometer cart. This invention is depicted in Han artwork by the 2nd century CE, yet detailed written descriptions were not offered until the 3rd century CE. The wheels of this device rotated a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>gears</b> which in turn forced mechanical figures to bang gongs and drums that alerted the travelers of the distance traveled (measured in li). From existing specimens found at archaeological sites, it is known that Han-era craftsmen made use of the sliding metal caliper to make minute measurements. Although Han-era calipers bear incised inscriptions of the exact day of the year they were manufactured, they are not mentioned in any Han literary sources.|$|E
25|$|The {{advantage}} to this design {{is that the}} brake is not being applied to slow the vehicle, it is simply clutching the second <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>gears</b> in or out. This means it does not dissipate energy, except in the brief period it is being applied or released. Smoother steering {{can be accomplished by}} partial application of the brake, but then it begins to dissipate energy like the braked differential. The main disadvantage is {{that there is only one}} turning radius. Like the standard differential solution, these systems are also subject to self-turning when travelling over terrain.|$|E

Testing performed at NASA Glenn Research Center have shown correlations between specific condition indicators and specific types <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> wear. To speed up the detection and analysis <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> teeth, an image detection program based on the Viola-Jones algorithm was trained to automatically detect spiral bevel gear wear pitting. The detector was tested using a training <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> wear pictures and a blind <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> wear pictures. The detector accuracy for the training set was 75 percent while the accuracy for the blind set was 15 percent. Further improvements on {{the accuracy of the}} detector are required but preliminary results have shown its ability to automatically detect gear tooth wear. The trained detector would be used to quickly evaluate a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> or pinion pictures for pits, spalls, or abrasive wear. The results could then be used to correlate with vibration or oil debris data. In general, the program could be retrained to detect features of interest from pictures of a component taken over a period of time...|$|R

500|$|After X1 was {{commissioned}} in December 1925 and accepted in April 1926 {{she made a}} voyage to Gibraltar after which her main engine drive wheels {{were found to be}} damaged. After repairs she was sent to the Mediterranean Sea.

By 1930 her commanding officer reported [...] "internal arrangements not very satisfactory because of overcrowding with auxiliary machinery, accommodation is cramped, ventilation poor and the ship suffers from humidity, diving arrangements good." [...] Both the main and auxiliary engines were troublesome and she spent most of her time under repair, before being laid up. X1 was placed in reserve after 1930, before she was finally scrapped at Pembroke on 12 December 1936.|$|E
500|$|The armillary sphere, a {{three-dimensional}} {{representation of the}} movements in the celestial sphere, was invented in Han China by the 1st century BC. Using a water clock, waterwheel {{and a series of}} gears, the Court Astronomer Zhang Heng (78–139 AD) was able to mechanically rotate his metal-ringed armillary sphere. To address the problem of slowed timekeeping in the pressure head of the inflow water clock, Zhang was the first in China to install an additional tank between the reservoir and inflow vessel. Zhang also invented a device he termed an [...] "earthquake weathervane" [...] (houfeng didong yi 候風地動儀), which the British scientist and historian Joseph Needham described as [...] "the ancestor of all seismographs". This device was able to detect the exact cardinal or ordinal direction of earthquakes from hundreds of kilometers away. It employed an inverted pendulum that, when disturbed by ground tremors, would trigger a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>gears</b> that dropped a metal ball from one of eight dragon mouths (representing all eight directions) into a metal toad's mouth. [...] The account of this device in the Book of the Later Han (Hou Han shu 後漢書) describes how, on one occasion, one of the metal balls was triggered without any of the observers feeling a disturbance. [...] Several days later, a messenger arrived bearing news that an earthquake had struck in Longxi Commandery (in modern Gansu Province), the direction the device had indicated, which forced the officials at court to admit the efficacy of Zhang's device.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the initial}} {{development}} of railroad electrical propulsion, {{a number of}} drive systems were devised to couple {{the output of the}} traction motors to the wheels. [...] Early locomotives used often jackshaft drives. In this arrangement, the traction motor is mounted within the body of the locomotive and drives the jackshaft through a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>gears.</b> This system was employed because the first traction motors were too large and heavy to mount directly on the axles. Due to the number of mechanical parts involved, frequent maintenance was necessary. The jackshaft drive was abandoned for all but the smallest units when smaller and lighter motors were developed, ...|$|E

Each <b>set</b> <b>of</b> valve <b>gear</b> {{was controlled}} by two overhead camshafts coupled and balanced with an inside rod. Reversing was achieved with a screw and wheel. With a fully open regulator, live steam was supplied to the low-pressure cylinders by an automatic throttle.|$|R
50|$|Three-cylinder {{locomotives}} {{have certain}} advantages over two-cylinder ones, but a significant disadvantage over a two-cylinder locomotive {{is the need}} for a third <b>set</b> <b>of</b> valve <b>gear,</b> normally mounted between the frames where routine maintenance is inconvenient.
