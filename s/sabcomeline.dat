50|$|<b>Sabcomeline</b> (Memric; SB-202,026) is a {{selective}} M1 receptor partial agonist that was under {{development for the}} treatment of Alzheimer's disease. It made it to phase III clinical trials before being discontinued due to poor results.|$|E
40|$|<b>Sabcomeline</b> (SB- 202026, 0. 03 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, p. o.), {{a potent}} and {{functionally}} selective M 1 receptor partial agonist, caused {{a statistically significant}} improvement {{in the performance of}} a visual object discrimination task by marmosets. No such improvement was seen after RS 86 (0. 1 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, p. o.). Initial learning, which only required an association of object with reward and an appropriate response to be made, was not significantly affected. Reversal learning, which required both the extinction of the previously learned response and the acquisition of a new response strategy, was significantly improved after administration of <b>sabcomeline</b> (0. 03 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, p. o.). <b>Sabcomeline</b> (0. 03 and 0. 1 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, p. o.) had no significant effect on mean blood pressure measured for 2 [*]h after administration in the conscious marmoset. <b>Sabcomeline</b> (0. 03 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, p. o.) caused none of the overt effects such as emesis or behaviours often seen after the administration of muscarinic agonists, e. g. face rubbing and licking. This is the first study to demonstrate cognitive enhancement by a functionally selective M 1 receptor partial agonist in a normal (i. e. non-cognitively impaired) non-human primate and this effect was seen at a dose which did not cause side effects. Perseverative behaviour and deficient acquisition of new information are seen in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore the data suggest that <b>sabcomeline</b> might be of therapeutic benefit in the treatment of AD...|$|E
40|$|This study {{describes}} the pharmacological {{comparison of the}} muscarinic partial agonists <b>sabcomeline,</b> xanomeline and milameline at human cloned muscarinic receptor subtypes (hM 1 – 5). Radioligand binding studies at the hM 1 – 5 muscarinic receptor subtypes were compared with functional studies using microphysiometry using carbachol as the standard full agonist. In binding assays none of the compounds studied displayed preferential affinity for the M 1, 3, 4 or M 5 subtypes although carbachol was less potent at hM 1 than hM 3, 4, 5. In functional studies, all of the compounds studied displayed similar levels of efficacy across the muscarinic receptors {{with the exception of}} M 3, where there was a large apparent receptor reserve and the compounds behaved essentially as full agonists. <b>Sabcomeline</b> was the most potent agonist in functional studies but also showed the lowest efficacy. In terms of potency, xanomeline showed some selectivity for M 1 over M 2 receptors and milameline showed some selectivity for M 2 over M 1 receptors. These results show the value of microphysiometry in being able to compare receptor pharmacology across subtypes irrespective of the signal transduction pathway. None of the partial agonists showed functional selectivity for M 1 receptors, or indeed any muscarinic receptor, in the present study...|$|E
