However, his sickness, {{which turned out to}} be smallpox, sharply intensified and eventually killed him on 22 or 23 January 1894. With the king dead, Mjaan, the most senior of the izinDuna, took command of the Matabele. Mjaan was an old man, and his only son had been killed in the war. He wished to make peace. In late February 1894, he convened an indaba at which he and his contemporaries met with James Dawson, a trader known to them for many years, who offered the olive branch on behalf of the Company. The izinDuna unanimously accepted. They also told the trader what had happened to the Shangani Patrol, and led him to the battle site to survey it, as well as to examine and identify the largely <b>skeletonised</b> bodies of the soldiers, which still lay where they had fallen.

2500|$|The CPW is {{available}} in 9mm Parabellum (9×19mm NATO) caliber for now and [...] "resembles an updated/modernized MP7A1". The main differences are the angled pistol grip of the CPW for enhanced ergonomics and natural aiming, and a transparent rear magazine so that the operator can see the rounds remaining. Other features include a <b>skeletonised</b> trigger, a full-length Mil-Std-1913 Picatinny top rail for mounting accessories such as optics and lasers, and a shorter bottom rail {{in front of the}} trigger guard for mounting a vertical foregrip.|$|E

50|$|Generally, {{members of}} the Epilachninae attack plants by {{scraping}} one face of a leaf, largely leaving the larger veins and the epidermis on the far face more or less intact. As a rule, the beetles (i.e. the adults) will feed on the upper surface of the leaf, whereas the larvae feed on the lower surface. Any given species leaves characteristic marks on the leaf as it eats; for example, those that feed on maize tend to feed in long streaks parallel with the veins of the plant. Those feeding on Solanaceae leaves {{are more inclined to}} leave little arcs of <b>skeletonised</b> leaf.|$|E
50|$|The larvae {{feed on the}} leaves, buds and {{developing}} flowers of young eucalypts, including Eucalyptus microcorys, Eucalyptus nitens, Eucalyptus fastigata, Eucalyptus saligna, Eucalyptus cladocalyx, Eucalyptus baxteri, Eucalyptus muelleriana, Eucalyptus obliqua, Eucalyptus globoidea, and Eucalyptus regnans. The larvae create a protective shelter from which they feed by combining silken threads and foliage. A single larva may construct several shelters within its life span. Young larvae scour the leaf surface as they feed, and may also excavate terminal buds. Continuous feeding and webbing results in a browned surface which eventually becomes <b>skeletonised</b> and dies. Young larvae are translucent green/yellow. Full-grown larvae are 8-14 mm long and become dark green. Pupation {{takes place in a}} silk cocoon in an old leaf roll, loose bark, dry leaf or within soil {{at the base of a}} tree.|$|E

5000|$|In 1944, the American poet Winfield Townley Scott {{was working}} as a {{reporter}} in Rhode Island when a sailor displayed his skull trophy in the newspaper office. This led to the poem The U.S. sailor with the Japanese skull, which described one method for preparation of skulls (the head is skinned, towed in a net behind a ship to clean and polish it, and in the end scrubbed with caustic soda).Charles Lindbergh refers in his diary entries to several instances of mutilations. For example, in the entry for August 14, 1944, he notes a conversation he had with a Marine officer, who claimed that he had seen many Japanese corpses with an ear or nose cut off. In the case of the skulls however, most were not collected from freshly killed Japanese; most came from already partially or fully <b>skeletonised</b> Japanese bodies. Lindbergh also noted in his diary his experiences from an air base in New Guinea, where according to him the troops killed the remaining Japanese stragglers [...] "as a sort of hobby" [...] and often used their leg-bones to carve utilities.|$|E
50|$|In New South Wales {{the most}} {{destructive}} pest to waratah crops is the macadamia twig girdler (Neodrepta luteotactella). The damage {{is caused by}} the larvae and damage generally first shows at a branch fork or leaf. The condition is generally confined to young shrubs or trees. The leaves are <b>skeletonised</b> and the larvae web them together into a shelter that incorporates larval faeces. Larvae can also burrow into the developing flower head, obliterating a crop entirely if left uncontrolled. Biological control methods include encouragement of bird species. The borer is present throughout the year and so pesticide treatments with a strong persistent spray should be carried out monthly. What is used for the borer should also control lesser pests such as white scale, which is common in the natural state, and Macadamia leafminer (Acocercops chionosema). Leafminer poses no threat {{to the life of the}} plant but it is preferred that stems for the market still have leaves attached. Thus damaged leaves lower the value of the crop. Chemicals with zylene or toluene should not be used as the will not be tolerated by the plant.|$|E
50|$|The larvae feed on Canarium and Ailanthus species, {{including}} Ailanthus fordii. Young larvae <b>skeletonise</b> leaflets, while older larvae are defoliators. They {{are also}} found to feed on Ailanthus altissima, Amygdalus persica, and Toona sinensis from China.|$|R
50|$|The larvae feed on Quercus agrifolia. Young larvae {{mine the}} leaves of their host plant. When older, they create a case by cutting oval {{sections}} from the host leaves and continue feeding by <b>skeletonising</b> the leaves.|$|R
50|$|The larvae feed on Rhododendron reticulatum. They <b>skeletonise</b> {{the leaves}} of their host plant, {{including}} {{the edge of their}} own case. They create an irregular subrectangular case. The species overwinters as a larva on the ground.|$|R
5000|$|Discovery {{of such a}} well-preserved {{brain is}} all the more remarkable, {{considering}} the fragility of all human brains following death. Even when placed in a chilled environment in a mortuary, brains quickly dissolve into liquid. The high fat content of the brain means that it is usually the first major organ to deteriorate. The brains of the crew of the American Civil War submarine H. L. Hunley were recovered along with their <b>skeletonised</b> bodies in 2000, and brains were found in the wreck of the English warship Mary Rose, but archaeologists found that they [...] "liquefied within a matter of minutes" [...] unless preserved immediately in formalin. Brains found in terrestrial environments have tended to be better preserved, as the surviving material tends to have a higher proportion of hydrophobic (water-repellent) matter than in a fresh brain. There appear to be a number of routes by which brains have been preserved, though a common factor appears to be the existence of a wet, anoxic environment. The presence of such an environment is thought to have been responsible for a similar but less complete preservation of brain matter discovered in the 1990s during {{the construction of a new}} magistrates' court in Hull.|$|E
5000|$|Both {{the larvae}} and the adults are diurnal and {{feed on the}} foliage of alfalfa, the larvae doing the most damage. The adults eat {{the edges of the}} leaves, giving them a {{feathery}} appearance. At first, the larvae feed on terminal leaves leaving puncture marks, but they later move down the plant to feed on lower leaves. The leaves attacked are <b>skeletonised</b> as the larvae feed between the veins, and plant yields can be reduced by up to 15%. Sometimes the larvae are killed by the pathogenic fungus Zoophthora phytonomi, especially in warm and humid weather. They may also be parasitized by ichneumon wasps, Bathylplectes anurus and B. curculionis. The female of these wasps is only about 0.125 in long, and lays an egg inside an early stage of the larva of the weevil. The developing wasp larva is a parasitoid, living inside the weevil larva and devouring it, eventually pupating soon after its host. The wasp's brownish cocoon has a broad white band in the case of B. curculionis, and a narrower, raised one in the case of B. anurus. When it is disturbed, the cocoon of the latter species can [...] "jump" [...] several centimetres to avoid predation. Both these species of wasp have been investigated for their potential for biological control of the weevil, and B. anurus is generally considered superior to B. curculionis because of its higher reproductive rate.|$|E

25|$|The larval head is {{concealed}} under folds. First-instars <b>skeletonise</b> {{the leaf}} (avoiding small veins and eating mostly one surface), but later instars eat the whole leaf, usually from the underside. Many species seem {{to feed on}} several genera of host plants.|$|R
