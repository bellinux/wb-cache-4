[...] The agency's letter warned that Xango Juice had not been properly tested for safety and efficacy, and as a proposed new drug, it could not be legally sold in the U.S. without prior approval of the FDA. Xango was warned that it could face enforcement action including seizure and/or injunction of products or suspension of business.

2500|$|Murray-Darling Macquarie perch are now {{listed as}} {{endangered}} {{on state and}} Commonwealth listings. [...] Gross overfishing by anglers, habitat degradation through siltation, and regulation of flow and [...] "thermal pollution" [...] by dams have all been major causes of decline. [...] A mysterious but endemic disease called Epizootic Haemotopoeitic Necrosis virus (EHN virus), now vectored by introduced redfin perch, has been proven to be fatal to Macquarie perch, and {{may have contributed to}} the decline of some populations of Macquarie perch in upland impoundments. [...] What has become clear however is that total domination of the Macquarie perch's upland habitats by introduced brown trout (Salmo trutta) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) have also been a major cause of decline. [...] Indeed, Macquarie perch populations have failed in significant stretches of relatively pristine upland river that offer excellent habitat, are not silted, dammed or overfished, and where there are no possible explanations for their demise except introduced trout species. [...] Dietary studies have documented significant overlap between the diet of Macquarie perch and introduced trout species, and anglers have observed predation of Macquarie perch juveniles by introduced trout species. [...] Several publications in the 1940s through to the 1960s by the director of the Victorian Fisheries and Game Department (A.D.Butcher) documents predation on juvenile trout cod, Macquarie perch and other upland native fish species by introduced trout species, and major dietary overlaps. [...] Recent research (Lintermans, 2006) records dietary overlaps that are significant by <b>scientific</b> <b>criteria</b> between Macquarie perch and introduced trout species.|$|E

The thrust toward the development of Pareto optimality as a <b>scientific</b> <b>criterion</b> of economic welfare was a response to the methodological tensions between the clearly political nature of economics and the scientific aspirations of economists.

40|$|Granular debris {{flows in}} nature are {{composed}} {{of a wide range}} of solids and viscous pore fluids, moving at high velocities down sloping channels. The pore fluids in a granular debris flow affect the interactions between the solid and fluid phases and thus govern the debris-flow mobility. Study of the pore fluid effect (i. e., excess pore water pressures correlated to solid structures, and the viscous shearing and dragging) is essential for understanding the high flow mobility of granular debris flows. This study critically reviews two dimensionless numbers with clear physical meanings, then demonstrates a new application of field monitoring data for identifying natural debris flows on large scales (i. e., surge and continuous debris-flows, respectively). This study illustrates that, the pore fluid viscous shearing stress dominates solid inertial stress due to solids collision. It is also found that different to continuous debris-flows, the high pore fluid pressures generated in surge debris-flow body dissipate quite slowly and mostly influence particle contact behaviour significantly. A new <b>scientific</b> <b>criterion</b> for identification of continuous and surge debris flow in nature can be given by this study...|$|R
