40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} habitat fragmentation {{on the use of}} nest <b>site</b> <b>resources</b> by a secondary cavity-nesting bird species, the great tit (Parus major), we placed 443 artificial nest boxes on 21 islands in Thousand Island Lake from February to August 2008. Among the nest boxes 72 (16. 3 %) were used by great tits. We analyzed the relationships between island area, island isolation, predator activity, vegetation cover and nest box orientation and the use of nest boxes by great tits. Great tits preferred nest boxes with lowerpredator activity, lower vegetation cover, and an eastern or southern orientation. Island area and isolation did not affect the use of nest boxes directly, but island area indirectly influenced the use of nest boxes by affecting predator activity. Our results suggest that attention should be paid to environmental variables that directly affect the use of nest <b>site</b> <b>resources</b> by great tits. Our study also highlights the importance of the indirect effects of habitat fragmentation on the use of nest <b>site</b> <b>resources</b> by great tits...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{theoretically}} based {{analytic model}} of plant growth in single species conifer communities {{based on the}} species fully occupying a site and fully using the <b>site</b> <b>resources</b> is introduced. Model derivations result in a single equation simultaneously describes changes over both, different site conditions (or resources available), and over time for each variable for each species. Leaf area or biomass, or a related plant community measurement, such as site class, {{can be used as}} an indicator of available <b>site</b> <b>resources.</b> Relationships over time (years) are determined by the interaction between a stable foliage biomass in balance with <b>site</b> <b>resources,</b> and by the increase in the total heterotrophic biomass of the stand with increasing tree size. This structurally based, analytic model describes the relationships between plant growth and each species ’ functional depth for foliage, its mature crown size, and stand dynamics, including the self-thinning. Stand table data for seven conifer species are used for verification of the model. Results closely duplicate those data for each variable and species. Assumptions used provide a basis for interpreting variations within and between the species. Better understanding of the relationships between the MacArthur consumer resource model, the Chapman–Richards growth functions, the metabolic theory of ecology, and stand development resulted. Key Words: Biomass–density relationships, solar equivalent leaf area, site–vegetation relationships, plant allometry, consumer–resource model, plant geometry, self-thinning, monomolecular growth function, Chapman– Richards growth function, metabolic theory of ecology. 1.

Current Web archiving activities, collaborative or organisational, whilst extremely valuable in their own right, often do not and cannot incorporate requirements for proper records management. Material collected under such initiatives therefore may not be reliable or authentic from a legal or archival perspective, with insufficient metadata collected about the object during its active life, and valuable materials destroyed whilst ephemeral items are maintained. Education, training, and collaboration between stakeholders are integral to avoiding these risks and successfully preserving valuable Web-based materials. ...|$|E
