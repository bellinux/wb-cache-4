60|$|It is {{not usually}} known in England that a young French naval officer, unaware that Dr. Strauss was {{composing}} an opera {{on the theme of}} Salome, wrote another music drama to accompany Wilde's text. The exclusive musical rights having been already secured by Dr. Strauss, Lieutenant Marriotte's work cannot be performed regularly. One presentation, however, was permitted at Lyons, the composer's native town, where I am told it made an extraordinary impression. In order to give English readers some faint idea of the world-wide effect of Wilde's drama, my friend Mr. Walter Ledger has prepared a <b>short</b> <b>bibliography</b> of certain English and Continental translations.|$|E

5000|$|A {{major step}} in the {{development}} of the literature of Financial Gerontology was the publication in 1996 of the Encyclopedia of Financial Gerontology edited by Dr. Lois Vitt and Dr. Jurg Siegenthaler. The one-volume publication includes over 150 authors each writing a two- to five-page article on a subject relevant to one of eight core topics: Economic and Income Security; Employment, Work, and Retirement; Family and Intergenerational Issues; Financial Advice, Investments, and Consumer Services; Health Care and Health Insurance; Housing and Housing Finance; Legal Issues and Services; Quality of Life and Well-Being. As an encyclopedia, the organization is of course alphabetical, ranging literally from Accelerated Death Benefits to Zoning. To enhance its educational value to educators, however, each of the 150+ articles is listed under one of the eight core topics at the front of the volume. To enhance value to researchers and teachers, each article includes a <b>short</b> <b>bibliography</b> plus a number of [...] "see also" [...] references to other articles in the collection. Finally, given the broad multidisciplinary nature of the developing field of Financial Gerontology, including the non-standardization of several disciplinary vocabularies, the encyclopedia includes a massively detailed 40-page index in which such subjects as [...] "assets," [...] "consumer protection," [...] or [...] "employment" [...] are included in multiple articles.|$|E
