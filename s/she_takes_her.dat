25|$|Very {{nearly as}} {{visually}} evocative are the scenes involving Astor, {{almost all of}} which suggest prison.

He purchases an Opel automobile and has it crushed, then mounted in an Amsterdam park, elevated to an art form. Marshall McLuhan introduces an exhibition of New Style painting in Toronto, broadcast on television. Louis talks to jazz composer Mal Waldron about how his music expresses his protest against the lack of communication in our world.

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Ready, Set, Don't Go" [...] was {{directed}} by Elliot Lester. The video begins with a close-up of Cyrus' hand playing an acoustic guitar.

[...] Wang is also unhappy, despite the club's success, {{and it is no}} consolation the crowd is having a good time – after all, in the old country, no crowd ever came to his theater expecting to enjoy themselves. [...] Outraged at Harvard's poor acting skills, Wang takes the stage in his place, his stage instincts take over ("Gliding Through My Memories"), and he is soon an enthusiastic supporter of the change, taking the stage name Sammy Fong. [...] Linda advises Mei-li to put on one of her old stripper dresses to attract Ta, but the stratagem backfires, since Ta is attracted to Mei-li because of her wholesomeness.

500|$|USA Todays Ann Oldenburg {{described}} the video as sexy and [...] "pretty personal." [...] Kenneth Partridge of AOL commented, [...] "Packed with sex, violence and questionable acting, the new Britney Spears video, 'Criminal,' {{has all the}} trappings of a midnight movie." [...] A reporter from the American edition of The Huffington Post said: [...] "We can't honestly remember the last time Britney Spears looked so gorgeous in a music video" [...] and deemed it as the best video from Femme Fatale. Erin Strecker Entertainment Weekly also called it the best video of the album, and highlighted Spears' look, the ending scene and the [...] "fun story". Katherine St Asaph of Popdust said it is [...] "probably the best video of the Femme Fatale era." [...] Tom Townshend of MSN stated that although the video was not appropriate for Spears' younger fans, [...] " [...] is actually rather compelling and feels more like a short film rather than a pop starlet's music video." [...] A writer for VH1 said that part of the reason the video works is the comic sensibility between Spears and Marrs Piliero, explaining that [...] " [...] point to one of Spears's greatest talents: giving the impression that although <b>she</b> <b>takes</b> <b>her</b> career extremely seriously, she nevertheless doesn't take it too seriously." [...] The critic summarized the review by saying that the video is [...] "entertaining [...] a bad-girl adventure story, and her role here is essentially that of a (wait for it) femme fatale." ...|$|E

500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from August 13, 1910. It states: [...] "The story centers on Harry Willard, a plodding farmer. A city gentleman promises Harry's frivolous wife a life of ease and luxury - {{and it is the}} old, old story. <b>She</b> <b>takes</b> <b>her</b> tiny daughter, Agnes, with her, and leaves a note announcing the fact for Harry. The young farmer, who loves his wife and child with an all-consuming love, loses his reason as he reads the announcement of his betrayal. Although without the bare means for his subsistence, he searches for days for his loved ones. Eventually the strain, mental and physical, tells on him - he comes out of it all a maniac. His wrath takes the form of an aversion to all mankind. He wants to forget the world that has treated him so ill - he decides to become a hermit and betakes himself to a desolate cave, where he spends the years execrating humanity. A quarter century goes by. Rarely in that time does he venture on beaten paths for fear that he may meet a hated human, but one day he forgets his resolve long enough to cross a carriage drive. He hears the clatter of hooves and sights a horse tearing toward him with a swaying carriage and screaming occupants - runaway! As the carriage passes by him, a woman flings a bundle to him; he catches it and finds it a pink and white bit of humanity. Dazed he runs into the wilderness with a baby and makes for his cave. Arrived at the cave the maniac resolves to even his score with society by taking the babe's life. But his eyes light on the baby's locket and his hand is stayed. For the locket bears a picture of the child of the wife who betrayed him!" ...|$|E

2500|$|And yet she is {{also shown}} as having real power in the play.
