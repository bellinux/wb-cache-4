5|$|In 1451, {{the very}} {{powerful}} Bosnian regional lord Herzeg Stjepan Vukčić Kosača attacked Dubrovnik, and laid siege to the city. He had earlier been made a Ragusan nobleman and, consequently, the Ragusan government now proclaimed him a traitor. A reward of 15,000 ducats, a palace in Dubrovnik worth 2,000 ducats, {{and an annual}} income of 300 ducats was offered to anyone who would kill him, along {{with the promise of}} hereditary Ragusan nobility which also helped hold this promise to whoever did the deed.

They were not thinking about Death in June as Being a Nazi group, they are thinking that I, Jean Pierre Nobody, want to be Mayor of this town and I must win the good citizens over of this town to my cause and, therefore, I will be a knight in shining armour, I will always stand up to those things that everybody hates.

40|$|When {{different}} types of policy interventions are available, there is an understandable desire to evaluate all alternatives using common metrics <b>so</b> <b>scare</b> resources can be allocated in the most efficient manner. However, systems that display significant lags in their response to some interventions can confound such an empirical approach. This paper provides a parsimonious mathematical representation {{of some of the}} challenges confronted when trying to evaluate upstream interventions on lagged systems to help clarify when it is and when it is not practical to expect those interventions to meet the same standard of proof as downstream interventions. Implications for drug policy and delinquency prevention are elaborated...|$|R

Hathaway summed up her character with a caption on a magnet of Happy Bunny holding a knife; [...] "Cute but psycho. Things even out." [...] According to Hathaway, [...] "She comes from the same gene pool as the Red Queen. She really likes the dark side, but she's <b>so</b> <b>scared</b> of going too far into it that she's made everything appear very light and happy.

[...] Hathaway described her interpretation of the White Queen as [...] "a punk-rock vegan pacifist", with inspiration drawn from Debbie Harry, Greta Garbo, and the artwork of Dan Flavin. Burton said that the White Queen's appearance was inspired by Nigella Lawson.|$|E

Star! (1999), Kiss Kiss (Bang Bang) (2000), The 3 Kings (2000), and Two Days, Nine Lives (2000). During this time, Guillory decided to go on with her acting career because [...] "I was <b>so</b> <b>scared</b> of going to university and being with people my own age again, having been with that tiny little sect of girls in Norfolk whose daddies were farmers and politicians, who didn't trust me and didn't know where I was coming from".|$|E

500|$|Newspaper records {{suggest that}} between 1916 and 1917, the Cornwall Victorias went unbeaten for 46 games; winning 45 and tying 1. During that period, they outscored their opponents 228–29, of which Lapensée scored 150, {{averaging}} {{more than three}} goals per game. Lapensée's ability and strength led to some odd occurrences in games she was involved in. In one, the Montreal Westerns played a 17-year old, Ada Lalonde, who was being touted as [...] "a hockey prodigy" [...] and a talent to rival Lapensée. Lalonde {{turned out to be}} a young man that Montreal's owner had convinced to take part to try and outshine Lapensée. In another game, the Westerners goaltender, a Miss Hardman, was <b>so</b> <b>scared</b> of Lapensée's powerful shot that she wore a baseball catcher's mask. Lapensée realised how much money the league was making for the arenas, and how significant her role was in her team's success, and she demanded a share of the profits. These claims, leaked to the press, led the Montreal Star to dub her a prima donna. The team owners refused, and Lapensée retired from the league in 1918.|$|E
500|$|In 2008, viewers saw Martha {{coming to}} terms with a second pregnancy. The storyline began after Martha left old boyfriend Roman Harris (Conrad Coleby) for Jack. She was unsure of the child's paternity, but kept it a secret from Jack. Gordon said this is [...] "Because she doesn't think he ever needs to know. Roman's said he doesn't want to be {{involved}} and he wants to say it's Jack's. And so does Martha..." [...] After Martha has a miscarriage scare, Roman wanted to know if the baby was his. Gordon explained that [...] "Roman says he needs to know if he is or isn't the baby's father and Martha has to agree to do a DNA test. [...] They wait till Jack's out of the room then quickly arrange it. Martha's <b>so</b> <b>scared</b> of losing Jack she wants the facts before deciding her next step." [...] Martha's relationship with Jack was at its strongest at that time, but Gordon was concerned about Martha's lies: [...] "Martha and Jack have been through more than most and right now their relationship is as solid as it could be. But she's taking a big chance not being honest about her pregnancy." [...] She described Roman being the baby's father as [...] "Martha's worst nightmare".|$|E
500|$|People's {{reactions}} varied: some {{described themselves}} as [...] "shocked"; others admitted to being [...] "shaky" [...] or nervous {{for the rest of}} the day. Harold Kittinger, a worker at the Suntone Factory, said, [...] "I do not care to tell anyone I was frightened. But I was not shaking in my shoes. My shoes were moving." [...] One woman hypothesized that the shaking was a [...] "bomb". Grace Standerfer suggested the earthquake was sudden, saying, [...] "I was just scared to death. My husband and I were in the house. The Venetian shades began to shake one way, then another. When that awful blast came, he grabbed me and we ran outside. Things were falling and breaking in the house. I said to him, 'This is it.'

[...] His voice seemed suffocated, and my first impulses, which had suggested to me the duty of obeying the dying request of my friend in destroying his enemy, were now suspended by a mixture of curiosity and compassion. I approached this tremendous being; I dared not again raise my eyes to his face, there was something <b>so</b> <b>scaring</b> and unearthly in his ugliness. I attempted to speak, but the words died away on my lips. The monster continued to utter wild and incoherent self-reproaches. At length I gathered resolution to address him in a pause of the tempest of his passion.|$|R
500|$|The pair {{wrote the}} song, while {{longtime}} producer Scott Hendricks handled the production. It portrays a midtempo, country pop crossover duet. Shelton believed that writing his own music had [...] "been a great channel {{for him to}} vent and celebrate his tumultuous year".

Additionally, she explains in the lyrics how the two artists met: [...] "I never ever meant to get so into you / Thought I was using you just to get me through" [...] and [...] "You know I'm broken, I don't trust anymore / Last thing I needed was to fall in love".|$|E
500|$|In December 1889, {{a letter}} written by a {{resident}} of St. Lawrence named Charles J. H. Saunders appeared in The Bromley Record. Saunders stated that he had conversed with many elderly residents of Thanet {{on the subject of}} hoodening, and that they informed him that the custom had been discontinued around fifty years previously, after a woman in Broadstairs was <b>so</b> <b>scared</b> by the hooden horse that she died. He added that a horse's skull was rarely used, [...] "owing to the difficulty procuring one", and that the wooden head was thus typically used as a replacement. He stated that the hoodening company typically consisted of a [...] "Jockey" [...] who placed himself {{on the back of the}} individual carrying the horse, and that it was the [...] "sport" [...] that bystanders attempted to throw him off, resulting in violence. The horse and jockey were also accompanied by two singers, two attendants, and an individual dressed as an [...] "old woman" [...] carrying a broom; when the company knocked on people's doors, it was the old woman's job to sweep the inhabitants feet away with her broom and to chase any girls until being paid off with money or refreshments. He was of the opinion that the custom had been restricted to the Isle of Thanet, noting that locals informed him that it had been carried out in Ramsgate, St. Lawrence, Minster, St. Nicholas, Acol, Monkton, and Birchington. However, contradicting this was a number of letters published in The Church Times in January 1891 which attested to the continuing practice of the hooden horse tradition at both Deal and Walmer.|$|E
