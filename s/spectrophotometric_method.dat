40|$|ABSTRACT: Macrolides, one of {{the most}} {{commonly}} used class of antibiotics, are a group of drugs produced by Streptomyces species. They belong to the polyketide class of natural products. Their activity is due to the presence of a large macrolide lactone ring with deoxy sugar moieties. They are protein synthesis inhibitors and broad-spectrum antibiotics, active against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Different analytical techniques have been reported for the determination of macrolides such as chromatographic methods, flow injection <b>methods,</b> spectrofluorometric <b>methods,</b> <b>spectrophotometric</b> <b>methods,</b> and cap-illary electrophoresis methods. Among these <b>methods,</b> <b>spectrophotometric</b> <b>methods</b> are sensitive and cost effective for the analysis of various antibiotics in phar-maceutical formulations as well as biological samples.

40|$|AbstractThe Kjeldahl {{method and}} four classic <b>spectrophotometric</b> <b>methods</b> (Biuret, Lowry, Bradford and Markwell) {{were applied to}} {{evaluate}} the protein content of samples of UHT whole milk deliberately adulterated with melamine, ammonium sulphate or urea, {{which can be used}} to defraud milk protein and whey contents. Compared with the Kjeldahl method, the response of the <b>spectrophotometric</b> <b>methods</b> was unaffected by the addition of the nitrogen compounds to milk or whey. The methods of Bradford and Markwell were most robust and did not exhibit interference subject to composition. However, the simultaneous interpretation of results obtained using these methods with those obtained using the Kjeldahl method indicated the addition of nitrogen-rich compounds to milk and/or whey. Therefore, this work suggests a combination of results of Kjeldahl and <b>spectrophotometric</b> <b>methods</b> should be used to screen for milk adulteration by these compounds...|$|R
