60|$|<b>She</b> <b>flung</b> {{herself on}} her knees--she could not collect her thoughts.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>flung</b> it {{over her}} {{shoulder}} and danced around the kitchen.|$|E
60|$|Her face flashed into a smile. <b>She</b> <b>flung</b> {{her arms}} about him again.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> then <b>flung</b> {{her arms}} about {{as if she}} were sowing seed, and turned round three times.|$|R
60|$|In some {{surprise}} the youth put the cigar-case into her hand, and <b>she</b> immediately <b>flung</b> {{it into a}} neighbouring pool.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> was <b>flung</b> on one side. Off her {{guard for}} a moment, he had pushed past her with {{unexpected}} strength.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>flung</b> {{back her}} head and the grim mouth broke into a smile.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>flung</b> her parcels on {{the floor}} and {{snatched}} the child from him.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>flung</b> herself over {{against the}} wall of the garret with a slam.|$|E
60|$|For answer <b>she</b> only <b>flung</b> {{her arms}} round his neck; then, since he held back from kissing her, let them fall again, and jumped up.|$|R
5000|$|The {{ability to}} cling to all surfaces. Emp {{discovered}} this power accidentally when <b>she</b> was <b>flung</b> to {{the underside of the}} outstretched hand of a large statue.|$|R
6000|$|... "I really don't understand." [...] The doctor began, with a physician's carefulness, {{to unwind}} the coil <b>she</b> had <b>flung</b> down to him. [...] "Are the Savors going, and the child?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>flung</b> out {{her hands}} and shook her head. Susceptible! She denied it vehemently.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly, in {{the fading}} light, <b>she</b> <b>flung</b> her arms around me, {{pressing}} me tightly, desperately.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>flung</b> her shawl {{about her}} and went downstairs, leaving him {{standing}} in the room.|$|E
6000|$|Where <b>she</b> was <b>flung,</b> above, beneath, [...] By the rude {{dance of}} life and death, [...] Grow she at Gotham--die at Rome, [...] Between the pine trees is her home.|$|R
6000|$|... "Good-bye!" [...] <b>She</b> {{suddenly}} <b>flung</b> {{her arms}} round his neck, and, pressing her cheek tight against his, flashed {{out of the}} room by one door as her father entered it by another.|$|R
6000|$|Before {{he could}} answer, and quite {{before the judge}} could reach the tragical group, <b>she</b> had <b>flung</b> her arms round Boyne's neck, and was kissing his tear-drabbled face, while he lamented back, [...] "They're taking me to prison." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>flung</b> {{herself on}} her knees to implore mercy, but he cut her in four pieces.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>flung</b> the bridle of {{her horse}} round the veranda post, and I helped her tie it.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>flung</b> the peel {{into the}} fire, {{laughing}} a short laugh, {{and went on}} with her work.|$|E
2500|$|During {{her time}} on the show, the Downton Abbey cast won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series in 2012 (for series 2), and were {{nominated}} also in 2013 (for series 3). Finneran announced her departure in March 2013, ahead of the fourth series, explaining {{that she had been}} signed for only three series and did not wish to extend her contract, adding: [...] "When I stop loving something, I stop doing it." [...] Later that year, when asked by the Radio Times how her character's abrupt exit would be handled, Finneran retorted: [...] "I’m hoping <b>she’s</b> <b>flung</b> off the roof of the Abbey".|$|R
6000|$|... "Proud?" [...] he echoed. [...] "Ah! Then {{it must be}} {{that you}} are {{resolved}} to take this impudent, fleering coxcomb for a husband," [...] he said, rallying her with the words <b>she</b> had <b>flung</b> at him {{that night in the}} moonlit Croydon garden.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> {{suddenly}} <b>flung</b> {{her hands}} above her head, {{and there was}} {{what seemed to be}} a miraculous increase in the little group. Three men in plain, dark clothes sprang from behind a gigantic bowlder, and, in an instant, the Sicilian was seized from behind.|$|R
60|$|The swift {{gesture with}} which <b>she</b> <b>flung</b> over the {{carriage}} of her machine might have warned him.|$|E
60|$|And {{there were}} hasty steps along the passage. Louisa entered. <b>She</b> <b>flung</b> herself upon Helena and kissed her.|$|E
60|$|Dick {{was sitting}} in his bedroom, reading an evening paper, and <b>she</b> <b>flung</b> herself sobbing into his arms.|$|E
6000|$|... "But--" [...] Phillotson {{seized the}} knob and {{pulled at the}} door. She had {{fastened}} it inside {{with a piece of}} string, which broke at his pull. There being no bedstead <b>she</b> had <b>flung</b> down some rugs and made a little nest for herself in the very cramped quarters the closet afforded.|$|R
60|$|Holding her, therefore, {{within the}} shelter of my arms, where in her heedless innocence <b>she</b> had <b>flung</b> herself, and by very {{instinct}} stroking with one hand her little brown head to soothe her fears, I became truculent {{for the first time}} in my new-found manhood, and boldly challenged her pursuer.|$|R
25|$|The crash flung {{some of the}} {{survivors}} into a stream, lessening the severity of their burns. A 30-year-old woman with British and Spanish dual citizenship survived with a punctured lung and broken left arm but no burns, as <b>she</b> was <b>flung</b> from row 6, still attached to her seat, into the stream.|$|R
60|$|Margaret gave a hysterical laugh. <b>She</b> <b>flung</b> {{herself on}} her knees by Arthur's side and seized his hands.|$|E
60|$|The child's sobs increased, and <b>she</b> <b>flung</b> herself {{upon the}} dirt floor of the hut, {{apparently}} overcome by grief.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>flung</b> {{out into}} the hall, and Mr. Vickers, after a lofty glance at Mr. Stobell, {{followed}} her outside.|$|E
60|$|In {{the last}} weeks of Miss Kitty's life Miss Ailie {{conceived}} a passionate unspoken hatred of Mr. McLean, and her intention was to write {{and tell him that}} he had killed her darling. But owing to the illness into which <b>she</b> was <b>flung</b> by Miss Kitty's death, that unjust letter was never written.|$|R
60|$|Brooke {{looked at}} her steadily. Exactly where she wished to lead him he did not know, but <b>she</b> had <b>flung</b> away her power to lead him {{anywhere}} long ago. Perhaps she was influenced by vanity, for there was no genuine passion or tenderness in her, but Brooke was a well-favored man, and she had her caprices and drifted easily.|$|R
50|$|An {{animation}} {{series in}} production about {{the struggles of}} Kendra Call, a young cryptozoologist, haunted by ghoulish visions of her childhood, desperately searching for proof of monsters unknown to modern science. Upon discovering a note addressed to her and written in riddles, <b>she</b> is <b>flung</b> into a secret war of monsters, to which {{the rest of the}} world is seemingly oblivious.|$|R
