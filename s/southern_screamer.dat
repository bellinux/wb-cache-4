25|$|Unlike other stork species, this stork is {{commonly}} found to nest on the ground, whereas many other stork species habitually nest at higher elevation. The nest always lies near to shallow water amongst tall grass and reeds, since aquatic organisms form {{the bulk of}} the nestlings’ diet. The maguari stork's nest is also unusual in extensively comprising grass and reeds. Common species used in nest fabrication include the reed Cyperus giganteus and the marsh grass Zizianopsis bonariensis, alongside other aquatic plants in the families Polygonaceae and Solinaceae. Ground nests found in the southern parts of the maguari stork's range are one meter high conical structures measuring 1.5-2.5m in basal diameter, tapering to a flat platform of 1-1.5m at the top. The nest rises up to two feet above {{the surface of the water}} and its location is largely treeless. Hence overall, the maguari stork's nest seems to more closely resemble that of cranes and screamers such as the <b>southern</b> <b>screamer</b> Chauna torquata than that of other stork species.|$|E

50|$|On December 30, 2008, after {{a nearly}} two-year absence from college basketball, Smith {{stepped onto the}} court {{as a member of}} the University of <b>Southern</b> Indiana <b>Screaming</b> Eagles. Rusty skills, nerves and embarrassment over having to play while wearing an ankle monitor led to a slow start in his first game for USI, but Smith was soon back to his old form, leading his team to a #2 {{national}} ranking in Division II, and was given Honorable Mention Division II All-American, and finished the season averaging 18.5 points per game. As a senior in 2010 Smith was named the Basketball Times Division II Player of the Year, with a career-high 21.6 points per game average.|$|R
50|$|The <b>southern</b> <b>screamer</b> averages 81 - 95 cm {{long and}} weighs 3 - 5 kg. They are the heaviest, {{although}} {{not necessarily the}} longest, of the three screamers. The wingspan is around 170 cm. Among standard measurements, the wing chord measures 54 cm, the tail 23.2 cm, the culmen 4.5 cm and the long tarsus 11 cm. It lives in tropical and sub-tropical swamps, estuaries and watersides.|$|E

5000|$|The {{horned screamer}} [...] (Anhima cornuta) {{is a member}} of a small family of birds, the Anhimidae, which occurs in {{wetlands}} of tropical South America. There are three screamer species, the other two being the <b>southern</b> <b>screamer</b> and the northern screamer in the genus Chauna. They are related to the ducks, geese and swans, which are in the family Anatidae, but have bills looking more like those of game birds.|$|E
50|$|They are large, bulky birds, {{with a small}} downy head, {{long legs}} and large feet which are only {{partially}} webbed. They have large spurs on their wings which are used in fights over mates and territorial disputes. The <b>southern</b> <b>screamer</b> is overall fairly common and sometimes considered a pest as it raids crops and competes with farm birds for food. In contrast, the northern screamer is relatively rare and therefore considered near threatened.|$|E
50|$|The <b>southern</b> <b>screamer</b> {{is a good}} swimmer, having {{partially}} webbed feet, but {{prefers to}} move on the ground. The bony spurs on its wings are used for protection against rival screamers and other enemies. Although it is non-migratory, it is an excellent flier. It lives in large flocks, feeding {{on the ground in}} grasslands and cultivated fields until nesting season, when birds pair off. Their unfuzzy diet makes them amenable to domestication and they make excellent guard animals due to their loud screams.|$|E
50|$|Birds include elegant crested tinamou (Eudromia elegans), {{cinnamon}} warbling finch (Poospiza ornata), Darwin's nothura (Nothura darwinii) and burrowing parrot (Cyanoliseus patagonus). Threatened {{birds are}} peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) and Chaco eagle (Buteogallus coronatus).Endangered birds include yellow cardinal (Gubernatrix cristata) and Eskimo curlew (Numenius borealis).The Guanacache, Desaguadero y Bebedero system has rich biodiversity and supports more than 50 species of waterbirds.These include maguari stork (Ciconia maguari), <b>southern</b> <b>screamer</b> (Chauna torquata), white-faced ibis (Plegadis chihi), Chilean flamingo (Phoenicopterus chilensis) and dabbling ducks of the Anas genus. It {{is also used}} by migratory birds such as plovers and sandpipers.|$|E
50|$|The <b>southern</b> <b>screamer</b> {{establishes}} monogamous {{relationships that}} last its lifetime, {{estimated to be}} 15 years. Courtship involves loud calling by both sexes, which can be heard up to two miles away. For the nest the couple makes a big platform of reeds, straws, and other aquatic plants in an inaccessible place near water. The female lays between two and seven white eggs. The couple share incubation, which takes 43 to 46 days. Chicks leave the nest {{as soon as they}} hatch, but the parents care for them for several weeks. The fledging period takes 8 to 14 weeks.|$|E
5000|$|Screamers (Anhimidae) {{have two}} large spikes on the carpometacarpus. The larger one {{emerges from the}} {{extensor}} process, and a more distally located spur grows from {{near the end of}} the major metacarpal. In the black-necked screamer (Chauna chavaria) the spikes are oval in cross-section, but in the <b>southern</b> <b>screamer</b> (Chauna torquata) there is a sharp-edged keel along the spike’s proximal edge, and in the horned screamer (Anhima cornuta) the spikes are triangular in cross-section with three sharp keels. [...] In the black-necked screamer, the proximal spike can be 4.5-4.7 cm long, but in the male horned screamer it can reach 6.1 cm in length.|$|E
50|$|The {{three species}} occur only in South America, ranging from Colombia to {{northern}} Argentina. They are large, bulky birds, {{with a small}} downy head, long legs and large feet which are only partially webbed. They have large spurs on their wings which are used in fights over mates and territorial disputes; these can break off in the breast of other screamers, and are regularly renewed. Unlike ducks they have a partial moult, {{and are able to}} fly throughout the year. They live in open areas and marshes with some grass and feed on water plants. One species, the <b>southern</b> <b>screamer,</b> is considered a pest as it raids crops and competes with farm birds.|$|E
50|$|The screamers {{are a small}} family, Anhimidae, of South American birds. For a long time, {{they were}} thought to be most closely related to the Galliformes because of similar bills, but they are instead more closely related to ducks (family Anatidae), most closely to the magpie goose (which some DNA {{evidence}} suggests are closer to screamers than to ducks). The clade is exceptional within the living birds in lacking uncinate processes of ribs. The screamers are represented by three species, the horned screamer (Anhima cornuta), the <b>southern</b> <b>screamer</b> or crested screamer (Chauna torquata) and the northern screamer or black-necked screamer (Chauna chavaria). A penis is absent in the males, and the birds' skin has a layer about a quarter of an inch thick that is filled with small bubbles of air, which produce a crackling sound when pressed.|$|E

40|$|It is {{described}} herein {{a case study}} of albinism in Chauna torquata Oken, 1816 (<b>Southern</b> <b>screamer)</b> occurred at the Ecological Station of Taim, Rio Grande do Sul. Brazil. Screamers are birds of marshes, wet grasslands and forest lagoons. The bill is short and curved, the head is small and slender and the neek rather short. The strong wings are armed with two large, sharp spurs on their forward edge. The feet and legs are fleshy, {{the lower half of the}} tibia is bare, and the three long front toes show just a trace of webbing between them, They are often seen walking in pairs on the floating masses of vegetation or in large groups for feeding. The albino specimen described herein was observed feeding in the midst of a group of almost fifty birds. Their plumage was white but their legs and bill were normally red pigmented, and also presented a light grey ring on its neek. It did not represent a case of total albinism, in which pigment should be totally absent...|$|E
40|$|The Pantanal region (Brazil) {{is under}} {{increasing}} anthropic pressure {{partly due to}} an increase in tourism and {{there is a lack of}} information about the influence of human presence on avifauna. Here we study the relationships between human activity in the river (boats and fishermen) and 15 bird species along a 70 km stretch of the Paraguay River, also including other confounding factors such as distance to towns and spatial autocorrelation. Human density along the river was low and as expected decreased with distance from towns. Bird richness and density were negatively associated with human density and the distance to towns along the river, suggesting a permanent impact on avifauna. Riparian forests had higher bird density. Four species were apparently sensitive to human presence: the anhinga Anhinga anhinga, the great white egret Egretta alba, the ringed kingfisher Megaceryle torquata and the <b>southern</b> <b>screamer</b> Chauna torquata. Thus, these species could serve as indicators of human pressure. Any management plan for sustainable development of the study area should preserve the riparian forest, consider the control of numbers of tourists and people in the river, and monitor the bird community, especially the sensitive species...|$|E
