40|$|The Ricardo Wave engine {{modelling}} software {{has been}} used to examine the effect of increased <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> on a turbocharged diesel engine. Steady state and varying <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> are considered. The results show that high <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> has a significant adverse effect on the operation and reliability of the engine. The response to fluctuating <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> is strongly non-linear, and depends on the amplitude and period of the fluctuations. For a constant output load, the exhaust gas temperature increases significantly with increasing <b>back</b> <b>pressure,</b> leading to reduced engine reliability. Due to the speed control strategy used on this engine, speed fluctuations are an unavoidable consequence of imposed <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> fluctuations...|$|R
40|$|After-treatment {{technologies}} are adopted in automobiles and ships to meet strict emission regulations, which increase exhaust <b>back</b> <b>pressure.</b> Furthermore, underwater exhaust systems are employed on board ships to save space, and reduce noise and pollution on working decks. However, water at exhaust outlet creates a flow resistance for the exhaust gases, which {{adds to the}} <b>back</b> <b>pressure.</b> High <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> reduces the operating limits of an engine, increases fuel consumption, {{and can lead to}} exhaust smoke. While the effects of <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> were recognized earlier, {{there is a lack of}} experimentally validated research on the performance limits of a turbocharged, marine diesel engine against high <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> for the entire operating window. The focus of this research is to provide a comprehensive understanding of <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> effects on marine diesel engine performance, and to identify limits of acceptable <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> along with methods to tackle high <b>back</b> <b>pressure.</b> In this work, a pulse turbocharged, medium speed, diesel engine was tested at different loads and engine speeds; against different values of static <b>back</b> <b>pressure.</b> Additionally, mean value model simulations could be validated and were used to compare the performance of a pulse and constant pressure turbocharged engine against high <b>back</b> <b>pressures</b> of 1  meter water-column (mWC), and for two different values of valve overlap. Using the validated simulation model, the conceptual basis for the engine smoke limit as well as for thermal overloading is investigated. A methodology applying the conceptual basis to define boundaries of acceptable <b>back</b> <b>pressures</b> has been presented in this paper.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to find the relationship between the <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> and the noise level. <b>Back</b> <b>pressure</b> needs to be kept to a minimum.

40|$|Samples of {{electrolytic}} {{tough pitch}} (ETP) pure copper {{were subjected to}} 12 passes of Equal-Channel Angular Pressing (ECAP) at room temperature with and without <b>back</b> <b>pressure.</b> Subsequent annealing was performed to evaluate the influence of <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> during ECAP on the thermal behavior of ultrafine-grained copper. The microstructural and hardness changes caused by annealing were characterized by orientation imaging microscopy (OIM) and microhardness measurements. The application of <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> resulted in an earlier drop in hardness upon annealing, which {{is believed to be}} associated with a lower critical temperature for the initiation of recrystallization and a rapid coarsening of microstructure. Regardless of whether <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> was applied or not, structure coarsening during short-time annealing of ECAP-processed copper was governed by discontinuous static recrystallization. This is seen as a result of microstructure heterogeneity. Analysis of recrystallization kinetics was carried out based on observations of the microstructure after annealing in terms of the Avrami equation. The magnitude of the apparent activation energies for recrystallization in the absence of <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> {{and in the case of}} <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> of 100 MPa was estimated to be ~ 99 kJ/mol and ~ 91 kJ/mol, respectively.

This topic mainly {{research}} the high <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> heat supply technology of {{steam turbine generator}} unit and the correlation analysis of turbine under high <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> operating condition. High <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> heat supply is an energy saving technology developed {{in order to meet}} the requirements of energy saving and environmental protection. This technology can not only reduce the cold end losses to improve the thermal efficiency of power plant, but also decrease the energy loss and pollution emissions because it take the place of traditional heating boiler.
