40|$|The {{primary road}} surface {{characteristics}} that affect users are safety, noise and riding quality. Safety particularly relates to surface texture (macro texture), which infl u-ences water dispersal and {{ability of a}} tire to contact the road surface. This paper deals mainly with texture depth contribution to tire pavement contact. A slab mould was designed and built specifi cally of SMA to conduct <b>skid</b> and texture <b>depth</b> tests to simulate the actual fi eld behavior. A stepwise regression analysis was used, to indicate the separate and distinct effect of several aggregate factors such as angularity, type of aggregate, percent of asphalt voids in the mix, density, Polished Stone Value, Particle Index, Surface area, on the skid resistance of the experimental surface mixtures. At 95 % confi dence limit, a total of fi ve dependent variables {{were found to be}} signifi cantly infl uence texture depth of StoneMasticAsphalt (SMA). Those variables were angularity, coarse aggregate, percent of asphalt, voids in the mixture and density. It may therefore be concluded that the texture depth of SMA has the potential to optimize the contact area between tires and road surface under dry and wet conditions.

Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) seedlings were hand planted at eight recent clearcuts in skid ruts in either nontilled or tilled trails, in adjacent soil berms, and in adjacent logged-only portions. Four and 5 years after <b>skidding,</b> rut <b>depths</b> averaged 15 cm below the original soil surface; mean fine-soil bulk density (0 - 30 cm depth) below ruts of nontilled trails exceeded that on logged-only portions by 14 %. Height growth on nontilled trails averaged 24 % less than on logged-only portions in year 4 after planting and decreased to 6 % less in year 7. For years 8 - 10, mean height growth was similar for all treatments. Reduced height growth lasted for about 7 years compared with 2 years for coastal Washington. Ten years after planting, trees in skid-trail ruts averaged 10 % shorter with 29 % less volume than those on logged-only portions. Tillage improved height and volume growth to equal that on logged-only portions. Generalizations about negative effects of skid trails on tree growth have limited geographic scope.

40|$|Micro {{surfacing}} {{is developed}} from slurry seal technique. It {{is a mixture}} of polymer modified bitumen emulsion with 9. 5 mm chipping, quarry dust, cement, additive and water. The emulsion used in micro surfacing is CQS- 1 h and added with natural latex as its polymer modifier. This study was carried out to evaluate the performance of micro surfacing applied on expressway. In 2008, a number of preventive maintenance projects in North South Expressway used micro surfacing especially in the northern region. This study involved particular sections of expressways located at km 58. 60 to km 59. 60 south bound and km 84. 60 to km 85. 60 south bound from Bukit Kayu Hitam. The construction was completed on 7 th January 2009. The performance of micro surfacing in this specific expressway sections was monitored for one year. The Portable Pendulum Tester was used to evaluate skid resistance performance while the texture depth of micro surfacing was measured using Sand Patch Test. The surface irregularities data was collected using a 3 m rolling straight edge while the rutting measurement was based on 3 m static straight edge. The measurement was carried out after 4, 6, 9 and 12 months period of operations starting from April 2009 to January 2010. The result shows that the <b>skid</b> resistance, texture <b>depth,</b> surface irregularities and rut depth for micro surfacing comply with the specification requirements after one year of operation.

40|$|Transportation {{and highway}} {{orientation}} {{are going to}} use from sustainable material and recycling material. As the amount of disposed industrial waste material is increasing in road construction, researchers are exploring the use of waste materials which could preserve natural resources and save the environment. One of these sustainable materials is steel-furnace slag, which is a synthetic aggregate produced {{as a consequence of the}} electric arc furnace (EAF). Steel slag was select due to its characteristics, which are almost similar to conventional aggregates, and the fact that it is easily obtainable as a by-product from the steel industry. The same gradations of mixtures would produce using normal crushed aggregate as control samples. This project was carried out to evaluate the performance of eaf steel slag aggregate in ac 14 -wearing course mix, where the conventional granite aggregate was replaced with steel slag. In addition the following mix design and performance characterization of the bituminous and aggregates (steel slag aggregates and conventional aggregates) were evaluated in this project through creep tests, resilient modulus tests at various temperatures, texture <b>depth,</b> <b>skid</b> resistance. The bitumen 60 - 70 pen was used and percentage of steel slag was considered 0, 30, 50 and 100 % for each sample. All the mixtures with eaf steel slag have satisfied the requisites for acceptance in the road sector technical standards, thus resulting as suitable for use in the construction of road infrastructures. Samples made from steel slag showed considerably better results than conventional aggregate. Therefore, operation of steel slag would reduce land fill, save natural resources and improve the strength of pavement to sustain a higher volume of vehicles. On the other hand, laboratory test result results illustrates better performance against deformation characteristics, skid resistance, stripping of the binder and lateral movement of material compare with conventional wearing course...|$|R
40|$|At present, {{friction}} stir welding (FSW) {{represents one}} of the most interesting techniques in the field of welding. The process is has been implemented in industrial practice for joining aluminium alloys, while the welding of the titanium alloy and the steels is still primarily in a developmental stage. The thermo-mechanical action of the tool causes a residual stress field in the FSW joint. Although, the peak temperatures of the process are relatively low; residual stresses similar to the traditional welding technique may develop in the FSW joint. Moreover, the restraints of clamps, which are used for fixing the plates during the process, impede the relief of the heated zones that causes longitudinal and transversal residual stresses. The fatigue crack growth behaviour in FSW joints was investigated by several authors [1 - 4] and most of them [1, 3 - 4] have shown through experimental tests that the residual stresses play a predominant role on the fatigue crack growth rate as compared to the effects of microstructure and hardness changes. Therefore, an accurate method has to be adopted for measurement of the residual stress field in order to evaluate the influence of the same residual stresses on the fatigue crack growth behaviour of FSW joints. Several experimental techniques can be used to evaluate the residual stress field developing in FS welded joints. The non-destructive techniques of X-rays and neutrons have enabled the determination of the longitudinal and transverse residual stress profiles The destructive cut compliance method described by Prime [5] is widely used to provide the through-thickness residual stress intensity factor of a supposed crack front. Subsequently, the residual stress profile can be analytically extrapolated by the knowledge of the residual stress intensity factor, Kres. Similarly, the hole drilling method provides the residual stress distribution by means of incremental hole-drilling steps and numerical routines. Nevertheless, both these techniques require the knowledge of the influence functions which depend from the cut <b>depth,</b> the strain <b>gage</b> location and the geometry of the investigated body. Moreover, it has been recently illustrated that the innovative techniques of the contour method described by Prime et al. [6] and the on-line crackcompliance method [7] combined with the adjusted compliance ratio [8, 9], ACR, can be used to measure the residual stress field in FSW joints. In this paper, an application of the ACR method and of the on-line crack-compliance technique is shown for a FSW joint in titanium alloy. The on-line crack-compliance is used to obtain the residual stress intensity factor in real time from a fatigue crack growth test. Thus, the postprocessing ACR methodology is adopted to separate the closure and residual stress effects from the fatigue crack growth rate data. The on-line crack-compliance method is similar to the cut compliance method. This technique uses the load-displacement curve directly provided during the fatigue test, so that a specific test for the determination of the residual stresses is avoided. Moreover, the practical application of this methodology does not require the knowledge of the influence functions; only a sufficient signal stability and linearity of displacement need to compute the residual stress intensity factor. At the same way, on the basis of ratio of displacement, the AC...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the degree of correlation between internal water potential of Engelmann spruce trees and selected environmental factors. The secondary objective of the study was to determine the effect of summer precipitation, both in meadow and forested sites, on the soil drying cycle. Four study plots (each roughly 154 square meters) under spruce cover and two study plots (100 square meters) in a small meadow were established. At each spruce plot, a thermocouple psychrometer was installed at one meter above the ground on the north side of three selected, mature Engelmann spruce trees. Thermocouple psychrometers were installed at 5, 15, and 30 cm depths in the soil at the meadow plots and at 15, 30, 45, and 90 cm depths at the spruce plots. A tensiometer and two soil temperature thermocouples were installed near the thermocouple psychrometers at each of the plots but at 15, 30, 45, and 90 cm soil <b>depths.</b> Throughfall <b>gages</b> were placed at each plot to obtain an estimate of rainfall which was not intercepted by the canopy but which fell to the forest floor. Gross precipitation was measured by a 20. 3 cm diameter recording gage located at the meadow. Global radiation and wind were recorded at the meadow area also. Air temperature and relative humidity were recorded in wooden shelters. One shelter was located at the meadow area and one was located in the vicinity of the four spruce plots. Except for wind, weather parameters were recorded continuously. Wind movement was totalized on a digital counter and recorded on data sheets when needed. Psychrometric, pressure chamber, and soil data were obtained according to two schedules. Diurnal measurements of trunk water potential in six trees and independent variables were made during seven days in the summer months of 1971. Seasonal measurements of trunk water potential in twelve trees and independent variables were done at periodic intervals during the summer averaging every three to four days. Data to evaluate the effect of summer precipitation on the soil drying cycle was obtained periodically the summer of 1970 and concurrently (for the most part) with tree water potential measurements during 1971. Significant findings of this study included the following: as shown by analyses of variation of the data, within-season variations of tree water potential (by psychrometer and pressure chamber measurements) were statistically significant. In other words, fluctuations in water potential with time were large enough that they could not have been due to chance alone. On an hourly basis for seven cycles of diurnal measurements, daily peaks in wind movement corresponded roughly with trunk water potential minima, peak radiation occurred about two hours before water potential minima, and maximum vapor pressure deficits corresponded closely to water potential minima. Diurnal fluctuations in water potential of small understory branches, as determined by the pressure chamber, did not correlate well with weather factors. Seasonally, trunk water potential appeared to be highly correlated with fluctuations in vapor pressure deficit and less correlated with global radiation and wind. Soil factors such as matric potential and temperature were not correlated with trunk water potential. Correlations between water potential determined by the pressure chamber and environmental factors were not consistent. Pressure chamber values of water potential, however, did correlate roughly with trunk water potential during the latter half of the summer of 1971. By multiple regression analysis, a predictive equation was devised to predict trunk water potential on a daily and on a seasonal basis. With diurnal input data, radiation, vapor pressure deficit, and a transformation of vapor pressure deficit were significant variables. The model explained 81 percent of the diurnal variation in trunk water potential. Evaluation of the model with seasonal data input showed only one variable, vapor pressure deficit, highly significant. With seasonal data, 72 percent of the variation in trunk water potential was explained. Analysis of 18 rainstorms which occurred during two summers of study showed that roughly 0. 25 cm of rain must fall before interception storage of a spruce canopy is satisfied and measurable amounts of rain can fall to the forest floor. Variability among sample catches of a given storm was great, apparently reflecting the irregular nature of the overmature spruce canopy. On the average, 96 percent of rainfall from storms between 0. 0 0 and 0. 13 cm, 70 percent between 0. 13 and 1. 3 cm, and 38 percent between 1. 3 and 2. 5 cm was intercepted. The influence of rain on soil matric potential was restricted to the first 45 cm of soil at the spruce plots with no substantial increase of matric potential before the onset of fall rains. The effect of rain on matric potential of soil in the meadow was more pronounced. The matric potential of the 5, 15, and 30 cm depths fluctuated greatly. A temporary increase in matric potential of these depths following summer storms was noted while more marked increases in matric potential were measured after heavier fall rains. The major conclusions made as a result of this study are (1) relative vapor pressure in the trunks of Engelmann spruce changes markedly from hour-to-hour and from day-to-day during the summer months, (2) trunk water potential as measured by thermocouple psychrometers is functionally related to atmospheric factors of radiation, wind, and vapor pressure deficit, (3) fluctuations in trunk water potential with weather factors imply a causal relation with transpiration, (4) precipitation during the summer months modifies soil matric potential-but only in the shallow profiles, (5) matric potential fluctuations in the meadow areas are extreme (from saturation to low as - 40 bars) and would impose a serious threat to the water economy of young Engelmann spruce seedlings established in such meadows, and (6) Peltier type thermocouple psychrometers are useful instruments for investigation of the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum in field situations...|$|R
