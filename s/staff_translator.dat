From 2003 through 2010, the role and function of the CWS changed. All of these components had become centralized departmentally with CWS losing its ability to set priorities or control policy in these areas. By 2008 CWS lacked public outreach programs and the public profile of the CWS protected areas was very low. By 2010 CWS {{no longer had a}} homepage.|$|R

5000|$|Having {{avoided the}} {{political}} upheaval and student riots at Columbia and Barnard in 1968, Garafola {{spent a year}} in Quito, Ecuador, teaching English and studying Spanish. Then, after another year in the American Midwest and some time in Mexico, she returned to New York, where she found employment in 1970 as a <b>staff</b> <b>translator</b> at the Berlitz Translation Service in midtown Manhattan. Deciding to pursue graduate studies, she entered the doctoral program in Spanish at the Graduate Center of City University of New York. She soon switched her field from Spanish to comparative literature, which she found more intellectually stimulating, and began regular attendance at dance performances in the city. She eventually earned a master's degree (M.Phil.) in 1979. More years of study followed, as her interest in dance history grew to become her primary focus. With a dissertation entitled [...] "Art and Enterprise in Diaghilev's Ballets Russes," [...] she earned a doctoral degree (Ph.D.) in 1985.|$|E

40|$|Translating in a {{national}} institutional setting such as the Italian Ministry of the Interior poses unique challenges to in-house professional translators as they endeavour to convey the “voice” of the public administration to a large and diverse international audience of practitioners and private citizens who interact with the Ministry for various reasons on a daily basis. Starting from an overview of foreign language services provided by the Ministry’s staff linguists, this paper focuses on translation services and explores in detail text types, clients and readership and the special challenges represented by L 2 translation along with the strategies and practices adopted by <b>staff</b> <b>translators</b> to cater for the specific translation needs of both central and peripheral offices of the Interior Ministry. To illustrate all this, the two authors have drawn extensively on their own daily experience as staff linguists within two different structures of the Ministry, namely the Criminal Police Directorate in Rome and the Police Headquarters of Gorizia, offering a number of practical examples of translation of Italian texts into English, their L 2 and the preferred choice for almost {{the totality of the}} Ministry’s communication needs...|$|R
5000|$|Norden enlisted {{immediately}} upon President Franklin D. Roosevelt declaring war on Japan and Germany, {{and due to}} his fluency in German worked in U.S. Military Intelligence reaching the rank of Major in the Army with an intelligence service grade of G2. After the war during American occupation in Germany, Norden became {{editor in chief of}} Heute, the U.S. occupation magazine. In Heutes September 15, 1947, edition, Norden provided [...] "We, the People" [...] a three-page condensed and illustrated version of the American Constitution, this was supplemented with a full translation, under Nordens direction by two of his ablest German <b>staff</b> <b>translators</b> Peter Fischer and Fortunat Weigel, of the U.S. Constitution and Amendments that was provided free in pamphlet form to the thousands that requested it. This proved to be an influential and perhaps historically critical act as it was learned that existing translations of the U.S. Constitution in circulation up to that time in Germany contained gross misinformation and errors. During a period of East-West tensions between the Soviet Union and the United States there were many in the U.S. State Department who felt that this work was of tremendous benefit and importance to the West German government.|$|R
40|$|The twenty-seven Member States that {{constitute}} the European Union differ on linguistic, cultural and legal grounds. Nevertheless, one of the EU’s founding principles is multilingualism and the translation of its entire legislation in all the twenty-three official languages. Originally conceived for a four-member community, multilingualism has resisted throughout the numerous waves of EU enlargement and is today aimed at giving national Governments {{the chance to be}} equally represented. In particular, unlike other international organizations, the European Union enacts legislative measures that override national law; multilingualism is therefore also indispensable to guarantee that citizens in each Member State thoroughly understand the law in their native language in order to comply with it. Following an introductory section on multilingual legal drafting and on the difficulties related to the uniform interpretation of EU specialised concepts throughout national courts, the study concentrates on the semantic and morphosyntactic aspects that help classify EU language as a Language for Special Purposes (LSP). From a lexical perspective, the focus shifts to a diachronic analysis of the neologisms derived from Community debates, policy and legislation. Reflecting the continuous evolution of its political, economic and legislative measures, ‘Eurolanguage’ becomes a highly productive mechanism that increasingly permeates national languages through politics and the media. Terminological productivity is also constantly guaranteed by the meticulous work of EU <b>staff</b> <b>translators,</b> who exploit the inner resources of national languages and thus actively contribute to the introduction and diffusion of EU specialised terminology...|$|R

50|$|The {{game was}} nearly left unlocalized {{due to its}} {{religious}} content; its localization was handled entirely by Square Electronic Arts <b>staff</b> and <b>translator</b> Richard Honeywood, who described {{it as one of}} the most troublesome games of his career. Upon release, Xenogears received critical acclaim, with praise particularly going towards the storyline, gameplay, characters, and physiological and religious themes. By 2003, the game had shipped over 1.19 million copies worldwide. It has since gained cult classic status and is often acknowledged as one of the greatest role-playing video games of all time. While a direct sequel was never developed, Takahashi would later found the studio Monolith Soft and develop the Xenosaga trilogy as a spiritual successor.|$|R

2500|$|The German occupying forces, {{which had}} a need for builders, electricians, plumbers, mechanics, {{cleaning}} staff, quarry men, secretarial <b>staff,</b> labourers, <b>translators</b> and many other trades and skills, offered twice the normal island pay. All young men in the islands were required to register with the Feldkommandantur {{so they could be}} assessed and [...] "recruited" [...] as workers if not employed in useful work elsewhere. By 1943, around 4,000 islanders were directly employed by the Germans. Most of the skilled workers in the German building businesses under the collective Organisation Todt (OT) were volunteers, paid for their work and fed better than the drafted forced labourers from many nations, who were treated like slaves. The Germans would demand labour be provided. One job involving 180 men was to help level the airport, a clear breach of the Geneva Convention. Others, like gathering in the harvest in Alderney, were less objectionable.|$|R
40|$|By piecing {{together}} the many but scattered references to linguistic and cultural mediation in contemporary sources, {{some of which}} were first-hand accounts, we can build a picture of interpreters and interpreting during the Portuguese voyages of discovery and their early quests in India and the East. Linguistic and cultural mediators were not held in high regard, with convicts or slaves, regardless of hether or not they possessed the requisite language skills, often being forced into this role when it involved dangerous tasks such as gathering intelligence and making the very first contact with new peoples. They thus developed survival skills, in particular, to tread a fine line between the two camps, which in turn aroused suspicions about their loyalty, a prime consideration for the Portuguese. Subsequently, with the increase of missionary activity, another group of interpreters developed with quite different characteristics: they had to be Christian and of good moral standing, have a good grasp of Portuguese and be eloquent speakers of their native languages, in which they had to express novel religious concepts. Even though the Jesuits paid attention to their technical abilities and rovided training, like the Portuguese administration, they also judged their interpreters’ effectiveness {{on the extent to which}} their substantive goals were achieved.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{transcendental}} phenomenological {{study was to explore}} effective instructional strategies of mainstream classroom teachers working with English Language Learners (ELLs). Many teachers feel unprepared to adequately educate English Language Learners. School systems have attempted to rectify this situation by providing teachers with professional development that provides instructional strategies {{which may or may not}} be effective. This study answered the questions: What teaching strategies do teachers and administrators perceive to have the most positive impact on learning for ELLs?; How does the culture of the classroom and school impact ELLs’ academic success?; and What are building level administrators’ perceptions of obstacles that hinder ELLs’ academic success? Data was collected through the use of semi-structured interviews and focus group sessions, as well as videotaped lessons. Data collected provided a means to identify themes and shared experiences of effective teaching practices for ELLs; the data provided insight that will assist other school systems in helping their ELLs achieve academic success. All data collected was analyzed utilizing methods of data analysis as discussed by Moustakas (1994), epoche, phenomenological reduction, imaginative variation, and synthesis of structural and textural descriptions to arrive at the essence of the phenomena. During the data analysis the following themes were identified as pertinent to the research study: (a) specialized programs, (b) differentiation, (c) hands on learning, (d) high expectations, (e) respect for home cultures, (f) bilingual <b>staff</b> and <b>translators,</b> (g) community, (h) safety, (i) language barriers, (j) low schooled in native languages, (k) lack of experiences...|$|R
