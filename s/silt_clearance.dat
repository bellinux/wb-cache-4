40|$|Water {{rather than}} land is the {{limiting}} factor for crop production in Sudan. This study attempts {{to use the}} water footprint (WFP) and virtual water concepts to account for crops water consumption under the Sudanese rainfed and irrigated conditions. The general average of the green WFP of sorghum and millet {{were found to be}} about 7700 and 10700 m 3 ton- 1, respectively. According to experimental results at three different climates, in-situ rainwater harvesting techniques could reduce the WFP of rainfed sorghum by 56 % on the average. The blue component (surface water) shows the highest contribution to the total WFP of irrigated crops: 88 % for cotton, 70 % for sorghum, 68 % for groundnut and 100 % for wheat. However, the role of the green water (rainwater) is not marginal since it largely influences the operation and maintenance (<b>silt</b> <b>clearance)</b> of the gravity-fed irrigation system. Under normal conditions, the annual total virtual water demand of sorghum (the dominant food crop in Sudan) is found to be 15 km 3, of which 91 % is green water. During a dry year, however, Sudan could experience a deficit of 2. 3 km 3 of water, necessitating the adoption of a wise food stocking-exporting policy...|$|E
40|$|It is {{recognized}} that sedimentation is a main factor influencing a fish way {{whether it is}} freely flowing. In this study, two experiments, scour experiment and sedimentation experiment, are utilized on the U-turn horizontal section of fishway to examine causes which lead to sedimentation situation. Through scour experiment,the <b>silt</b> <b>clearance</b> capacity of clear-water discharge revealed on U-turn horizontal section of fish way is explored. On the other hand, while proceeding sedimentation experiment some elements are conducted such as changing slop, discharge, sand added particle and setting T-bone structure, etc. Adding sand following by a period time, we inspect how sand particle affects sedimentation furthering to see whether fish way is blocked accordingly. By analyzing experiment data, it is to know {{as long as the}} sand is smaller (19. 05 mm mixed particle under), the sedimentation could be divided into three types. Under different discharges and slops, all those three types of sedimentation could achieve a balance of sand added and collected. That means although there is sedimentation however the fish way is not unlikely to be blocked. On the contrary, while there is bigger sand(50. 80 mm mixed particle under) the fish way is blocked owing to upstream sedimentation or sediment deposit in U-turn horizontal section. Once there is sedimentation occurred at the U-T-turn horizontal section of fish way, it is difficult to clean away by clear-water discharge. For the reason, setting T-bone structure along with regular management and maintenance could decrease sedimentation. These findings are expected as reference in fish way design of engineering practice. 砂石進入魚道後的淤砂情形是影響魚道是否暢通的主要原因。本研究主要針對魚道水平迴頭彎段，進行兩種不同起始條件之沖刷試驗與淤砂試驗，利用沖刷試驗了解清水流對魚道水平迴頭彎段淤砂之清除能力；利用淤砂試驗，以改變坡度、流量、加砂粒徑及有無設置丁骨構造物等情況下，對魚道水平迴頭彎段淤積情形之影響，並觀察是否會有阻塞魚道之現象。 經由試驗資料分析，當加砂粒徑較小(19. 05 mm混合粒徑級配) 時，能將其淤砂情形分為三種淤砂型態，其在各種流量與坡度下，均能達到加砂、收砂平衡，雖有淤砂產生但不至於阻塞魚道；當採用較大加砂粒徑(50. 80 mm混合粒徑級配) ，魚道發生傾斜段淤積或水平迴頭彎段回淤，使魚道阻塞；魚道水平迴頭彎段一旦發生淤砂現象，難以清水流清除淤砂，可搭配設置丁骨構造物並配合人工管理維護定時清淤，希望此研究能對將來在魚道之內部設計方面有所幫助。第一章 前言	 1 第二章 前人研究	 3 2. 1 有關防砂壩對河川生態的影響及魚道效用之評估	 3 2. 2 有關魚道設計之研究	 4 2. 3 台灣魚類溯游特性之研究	 10 2. 4 有關丁壩設計之研究	 11 第三章 理論分析	 16 3. 1 消能方式	 16 3. 2 福祿數與水躍現象	 17 3. 2 砂丘(Sand Dunes) 	 17 3. 3 丁壩(Spur Dikes) 	 18 第四章 渠槽試驗	 20 4. 1 試驗目的	 20 4. 2 試驗設備	 21 4. 3 試驗設計條件及步驟	 29 第五章 結果與討論	 36 5. 1 福祿數之結果與討論	 36 5. 2 沖刷試驗結果與討論	 38 5. 3 淤砂試驗-不同加砂粒徑之加砂、收砂情形探討	 39 5. 4 淤砂試驗-魚道水平迴頭彎段之淤砂量探討	 44 5. 5 淤砂試驗-魚道水平迴頭彎段之淤砂型態與淤砂厚度探討	 48 第六章 結論與建議	 56 6. 1 結論		 56 6. 2 建議		 58 參考文獻	 59 附表、淤砂試驗時段加砂、收砂量表	 61 附圖、淤砂試驗淤砂型態等厚度線及立體圖	 6...|$|E
