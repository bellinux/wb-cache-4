25|$|George Profous, a {{forester}} {{for what}} had by then become the state's Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) wrote in an early 1990s planning document that the aged, deteriorating tower should be dismantled and removed, not only due to its age but because, out of use, {{it was no longer}} permitted on <b>state-owned</b> <b>Forest</b> Preserve land, which New York's constitution requires be kept forever wild. Worried residents of Denning and the nearby hamlet of Claryville contacted the Catskill Center for Conservation and Development, a regional advocacy group, to see what they could do to save it, a development Profous had been hoping for. DEC's guidelines governing the use of the Forest Preserve do allow the retention of otherwise incompatible structures within it if they enhance the public's understanding of the Forest Preserve, and many visitors and past observers wrote about how seeing the vastness of the Catskill wildlands at once helped them appreciate the importance of protecting it.|$|E

2500|$|Kalinderu earned {{additional}} favors from Carol I, crowned King of the Romanians, who {{appointed him}} his adviser on legal and agricultural matters. For a while, {{he served as}} administrator of the <b>state-owned</b> <b>forest</b> and fields. In June 1884, Kalinderu was named the first administrator of crown domains, which had been set aside by organic law, resigning from his position at the railways company in December 1885. Owned {{by the state and}} managed by the House of Hohenzollern (through Kalinderu), the domains originally included twelve country estates and two mountains of the Southern Carpathians: Clăbucetul Taurului and Caraiman. During the first years of his new assignment, Kalinderu tried to pursue a parallel career in politics. He ran for Bucharest Council in 1886, second on the National Liberal list. He withdrew upon winning, citing his [...] "many other engagements". During the election of 1888, [...] "I. Calenderoglu" [...] ran at Olt as an independent, but lost, collecting 55 of 165 votes. He eventually handled the purchase of Strousberg railways, negotiating a loan for 175 million lei in 1889. In 1891, following the resignation of a Conservative Party government under Gheorghe Manu, Carol reportedly proposed Kalinderu as Prime Minister of an independent cabinet. This maneuver was rejected by the opposition National Liberals—the refusal was instigated by a moribund Brătianu.|$|E

40|$|SummaryWe {{explore the}} {{relationship}} between tenure and forest income in 271 villages throughout the tropics. We find that <b>state-owned</b> <b>forests</b> generate more forest income than private and community-owned forests both per household and per hectare. We explore whether forest income varies according {{to the extent of}} rule enforcement, and congruence (i. e., overlap of user rights between owners and users). We find negative associations between enforcement and smallholder <b>forest</b> income for <b>state-owned</b> and community <b>forests,</b> and positive associations for privately owned forests. Where user rights are limited to formal owners we find negative associations for <b>state-owned</b> <b>forests.</b> Overlapping user rights are positively associated with forest income for community forests. Our findings suggest that policy reforms emphasizing enforcement and reducing overlapping claims to forest resources should consider possible negative implications for smallholder forest income...|$|R

40|$|Wood {{products}} can store carbon {{removed from the}} atmosphere by trees for long periods, potentially helping to offset some of the carbon dioxide emissions that {{are believed to be}} contributing to global warming and climate change. We undertook this study to examine whether harvesting practices in Maryland's <b>state-owned</b> <b>forests</b> could be modified {{to increase the amount of}} carbon that would be sequestered, and whether it would be economically justified to do so. The study uses a carbon accounting model that is being developed by the Power Plant Research Program (PPRP) to evaluate carbon sequestration projects in Maryland. Part I of this report describes the assumptions and approximations that were used to improve the tree growth calculations included in the model and adapt them to the forests managed by Maryland's Department of Natural Resources. Parameters in the growth equations were derived from Maryland forest data, and then rules of thumb that approximate forest harvesting practices in the state were applied. The result can be characterized as the technical production function for important environmental services provided by Maryland's <b>state-owned</b> <b>forests,</b> and hence can be used as the basis fo...|$|R

40|$|Extensive {{forests in}} Croatia {{represent}} an important biological and economic resource in Europe. They are characterised by heterogeneity in forest management practices {{dating back to}} the socialist planned economy of the pre- 1991 era. In this study we investigated the difference in rates of deforestation and reforestation in private- and <b>state-owned</b> <b>forests</b> during the post-socialist period and the causal drivers of change. The selected region of Northern Croatia is characterised by a high percentage of privately owned forests with minimal national monitoring and control. We used a mixed-methods approach which combines remote sensing, statistical modelling and a household-based questionnaire survey to assess the rates of forest cover change and factors influencing those changes. The results show that predominantly privately owned forests in Northern Croatia have recorded a net forest loss of 1. 8 % during the 1991 – 2011 period, while Croatia overall is characterised by a 10 % forest cover increase in predominantly <b>state-owned</b> <b>forests.</b> Main factors influencing forest cover changes in private forests are slope, altitude, education structure, population age and population density. The results also show that the deforestation in private forests is weakening overall, mostly due to the continuation of the de-agrarisation and de-ruralisation processes which began during socialism...|$|R
