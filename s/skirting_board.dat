25|$|Timmy Willie is {{a country}} mouse who falls asleep in a hamper of {{vegetables}} after eating peas and is carried to the city. When the hamper is opened, Timmy escapes to find himself in a large house.

25|$|There should {{normally}} {{be a fairly}} wide gap between {{the floor and the}} wall to allow for expansion and to allow air to circulate. This is often covered by a <b>skirting</b> <b>board</b> or molding, to make the gap less apparent. It is because the floor is free-standing, rather than connected to walls or joists, that it is also referred to as a floating floor.|$|E
25|$|The ballet {{became famous}} for Nijinsky's leap {{through one of}} the two large windows {{at the back of the}} stage. The height of the leap was an {{illusion}} though. Nijinsky took five running steps from the middle of the stage and leapt through the window on the sixth step. The <b>skirting</b> <b>board</b> (base board) under the window was very low, giving the illusion that the leap was higher than it actually was. Behind the set, four men caught Nijinsky in the air and put warm towels on him. No one in the audience saw Nijinsky land. It looked like he would soar on for all time. The illusion was helped by the conductor in the orchestra pit who held the penultimate chord. In doing so, the leap was given a sense of great length and height.|$|E
50|$|Walls and {{ceilings}} were lath and plaster, while <b>skirting</b> <b>boards,</b> {{doors and}} architraves were cedar.|$|R
50|$|There are timber floors {{throughout}} the house and all walls are lined with vertically-jointed tongue and groove boarding. Similarly, all ceilings are lined with vertically-jointed tongue and groove boarding, excluding the dining room which features {{what appears to be}} a pressed metal ceiling. All rooms have high picture rails. The hallway and living room both have bolection mould <b>skirting</b> <b>boards,</b> while all other rooms have plain <b>skirting</b> <b>boards.</b>|$|R

2500|$|The east window by William Wailes {{represents}} the Parable of the Good Samaritan; it cost £100 and was funded in 1870 {{by the local}} inhabitants in memory of Thomas Brooke, father of the 1869–1870 fund-raising treasurer Colonel Brooke. Rev. Richard Collins stated at the 1870 consecration that the theme of Good Samaritan and the word [...] "just" [...] in the window's dedication referred to Thomas Brooke's good deeds. The reredos was installed in the 1920s, and on its bottom right hand <b>skirting</b> <b>board</b> there is a wooden plaque commemorating its presentation. The sanctuary has decorative encaustic floor tiles whose arrangement was designed by Mallinson and Barber. These tiles were funded by D. Sharman who was master of Thurstonland Endowed School. The choir stalls and the altar rail are decoratively carved, and were designed and commissioned by Mallinson and Barber.|$|E
60|$|Anna Maria {{went down}} {{by way of}} <b>skirting</b> <b>board</b> and a window shutter {{to the kitchen to}} steal the dough.|$|E
60|$|He groped his way {{carefully}} for several yards; {{he was at}} the back of the <b>skirting</b> <b>board</b> in the attic, where there is a little mark * in the picture.|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} walls are generally of concrete, finished with wall-paper and featuring a reproduction cornice. The floor {{has been raised}} which has caused shallow <b>skirting</b> <b>boards.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} {{rooms of}} the ground floor feature early chimney pieces, mantle pieces and cast iron fire grilles. The rooms are generally quite simple, with timber <b>skirting</b> <b>boards,</b> stained architraves and stained timber boarded ceilings.|$|R
50|$|The {{caterpillars}} feed on organic detritus that accumulates indoors, e.g. behind <b>skirting</b> <b>boards</b> {{and other}} similar places. Recorded foodstuffs are for example cereals (including maize, oatmeal, pearl barley and rice) and other seeds, potatoes, furs and dog biscuits.|$|R
50|$|<b>Skirting</b> <b>board</b> {{radiators}} are a form {{of heating}} which involves placing radiators inside a <b>skirting</b> <b>board.</b> Hot water is piped though the system, usually taken directly from the central heating system.|$|E

5000|$|In architecture, the dado is {{the lower}} part of a wall, below the dado rail and above the <b>skirting</b> <b>board.</b> The word is {{borrowed}} from Italian meaning [...] "" [...] (as an architectural term) or plinth.|$|E
50|$|The {{first floor}} area retains its early timber floorboards, {{interior}} partitioning, picture rails, and deep <b>skirting</b> <b>boards.</b> Early panelled timber doors and moulded timber architraves also exist throughout this level. The ceiling {{is lined with}} early, narrow, jointed timber boards.|$|R
50|$|Both rooms {{retain their}} early <b>skirting</b> <b>boards</b> and the {{interior}} of the cottage is lined with plaster - walls, ceilings, partitioning wall and chimney. Much of this is early lathe and plaster work and early cement render, but sections of the ceilings have been replaced with recent plasterboard sheeting.|$|R
50|$|The {{house was}} heated by hot air {{channelled}} through brass grilles in the <b>skirting</b> <b>boards</b> from seven stoves in the basement. Lighting was {{by means of}} candles, oil, naptha distilled from coal, paraffin and finally electricity. Wigan Corporation connected a gas supply that was used for cooking in the late 19th century.|$|R
50|$|In architecture, a {{baseboard}} (also called <b>skirting</b> <b>board,</b> skirting, mopboard, floor molding, or base molding) is a usually {{wooden board}} covering the lowest {{part of an}} interior wall. Its purpose is to cover the joint between the wall surface and the floor.|$|E
50|$|The {{internal}} staircase {{consists of}} closed risers and treads with elaborate turned balusters and newel posts. The handrail follows {{the turn of}} the stairs and the <b>skirting</b> <b>board</b> is also carefully shaped to follow the incline. The underside of the stair is enclosed with timber paneling.|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} {{house has}} eight large rooms, {{each with a}} fireplace framed by a wooden geometric trabeated mantelpiece with classical elements. The four large rooms {{on the first floor}} open from either side of the center hallway. They contain simple wide wood trim, including <b>skirting</b> <b>boards</b> and door frame moldings with [...] "subtly demarcated corners". The house's living and dining rooms have wide, wooden dado rails. Most of the wooden decorative trim is painted white, and the walls are plaster. The lone exception is the room serving as an office and den, which has dark stained wooden trim and interior brick structural walls (exposed by the removal of its plaster during the 1960s). All rooms have the original wide plank wooden floors. The second floor has four bedrooms, with closets on either side of a fireplace and simple wood <b>skirting</b> <b>boards</b> and door frames.|$|R

5000|$|In September 2000, {{the case}} was reopened and detectives {{discovered}} fresh forensic evidence, including a small trace {{of blood on the}} cellophane wrapper from a cigarette packet and a further ten traces of the same blood underneath several layers of paint on a <b>skirting</b> <b>board</b> at the crime scene. The killer was dubbed [...] "Cellophane Man" [...] by scientists and detectives. No match was found in the United Kingdom National DNA Database.|$|E
50|$|Despite being {{cleared of}} suspicion, the {{marriage}} of Roubaud and Séverine declines. Zola casually tosses in a remark that the money and watch stolen from Grandmorin was hidden behind the <b>skirting</b> <b>board</b> in their apartment, thus confirming the reader’s suspicion that Roubaud was the murderer all along. Séverine and Lantier begin an affair, at first clandestinely but then more blatantly until they are caught in flagrante delicto by Roubaud. Despite his previous jealousy, Roubaud seems unmoved and spends less and less time at home and turns to gambling and drink.|$|E
50|$|The {{walls in}} the core are mainly single-skin, {{constructed}} of narrow, vertically-jointed tongue and groove boarding. The ceilings, with {{the exclusion of the}} pressed metal ceiling in the front northeastern room, are lined with the same boarding. All rooms off the hallway have high picture rails and lambs tongue <b>skirting</b> <b>boards.</b> Joinery in the hallway, including the doors, is decorated with an early timber graining effect.|$|R
50|$|Baseboards / <b>skirting</b> <b>boards</b> {{generally}} have typical variations {{depending on the}} country. For example, in China the baseboards are usually very low in height, are made of plastic or redwood, and have a very simple or unprofiled design. In contrast, in the UK there are {{a vast number of}} profiles available. These profiles are frequently named after the period when they were developed, such as Victorian or Edwardian.|$|R
50|$|Internal {{openings}} are {{generous in}} height and house fine timber-paneled doors with tall glazed pivoting fanlights. Generous moulded plaster <b>skirting</b> <b>boards</b> and timber <b>skirting</b> blocks and architraves are intact throughout. All interior timber work and joinery is varnished. Walls and ceilings {{are lined with}} hardset plaster with deep moulded cornices. A single decorative plaster ceiling rose {{is located in the}} banking chamber. Floors are generally covered with recent carpet.|$|R
5000|$|Formed in 1999 in Glasgow, Scotland by {{graduates}} of the University of Glasgow, its first production was an adaptation of Les Aveugles (The Blind) by Maurice Maeterlinck, performed in total darkness. The piece was performed at BAC in London in a season entitled [...] "Playing in the Dark". The company's first major show was in 2004, entitled Lost Ones, a surreal show concerning a man, a murder on a mountain, the little creatures who are smuggling things out of him years later and a void {{on the other side}} of the <b>skirting</b> <b>board.</b> Lost Ones went on to tour internationally.|$|E
50|$|Also in the 18th century, {{the style}} of {{panelling}} changed from a floor-to-ceiling covering to one in which only {{the lower part of}} the wall was covered. Hence wainscot or wainscoting became a panelling style applied to the lower 90 to 150 cm of an interior wall, below the dado rail or chair rail, and above the baseboard or <b>skirting</b> <b>board.</b> It is traditionally constructed from tongue-and-groove boards, though bead-board or decorative panels, such as a wooden door might have, are also common. New manufacturing techniques are capable of milling large panels from one sheet, reducing seams, caulking, and expansion/contraction cracks that have plagued traditional construction. Wainscoting may also refer to other materials used in a similar fashion.|$|E
50|$|The {{upper floor}} is {{accessed}} via a concrete stair {{in the southern}} tower, dating from the early 1940s. An open balcony {{on the first floor}} acts as an entrance vestibule to the courtroom which is entered via a double timber door. The courtroom is a large open plan room fitted with nineteenth century furniture. The original ceiling has been concealed with a suspended grid ceiling, housing lighting and other services. The room is naturally lit with a number of large windows and french lights opening onto the adjacent verandahs. Above these openings are high level semi-circular windows which sit on a string course lining the room. The walls are painted and bagged brickwork with a plaster <b>skirting</b> <b>board.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} of the hut is unlined and has a wooden floor. The pine <b>skirting</b> <b>boards</b> are of recent construction. Fastened to the wall opposite the door are three groups of cables passing through the floor. These cables run vertically up the wall and are {{held in place by}} a long wooden beam extending the length of the wall. The beam is fastened to the brickwork by bolts.|$|R
50|$|The {{first floor}} is {{substantially}} intact. It contains five rooms, including a large front parlour. Twelve feet high, timber {{tongue and groove}} lined ceilings feature central circular ventilators. The 370mm brick walls are plaster lined and divided internally by walls of eight inch wide tongue and groove vertical joint boards, with narrow timber picture rails and wide <b>skirting</b> <b>boards.</b> Three sets of wide French doors with single pane fanlights open onto the front verandah.|$|R
50|$|Internally the {{building}} is divided into suites of medical offices, accessed via a hallway on each level. The ground floor corridor is particularly intact, and displays a sequence of arches, plastered walls, and timber <b>skirting</b> <b>boards</b> and dado rail (now painted). A central staircase of dark-stained, silky oak treads and handrail, with wrought iron balustrading and dado tiles, services all floors, as does the adjacent elevator. A casement window and arched fanlight with multi-paned leadlights is a prominent feature of the ground-floor stairwell.|$|R
