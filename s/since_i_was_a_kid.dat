500|$|In November 2013, the Halcyon Gallery in London mounted Mood Swings, an {{exhibition}} in which Dylan displayed seven wrought iron gates he had made. In a statement {{released by the}} gallery, Dylan said, [...] "I've been around iron all my life ever <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>kid.</b> I {{was born and raised}} in iron ore country, where you could breathe it and smell it every day. Gates appeal to me because of the negative space they allow. They can be closed but at the same time they allow the seasons and breezes to enter and flow. They can shut you out or shut you in. And in some ways there is no difference." ...|$|E
500|$|After the sprint race, Coletti {{spoke of}} his {{childhood}} dream of hearing the Monegasque national anthem while standing {{on the top step}} of the Monaco podium, [...] "It feels great I mean I’ve seen all the drivers winning here <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>kid.</b> I’m really, really happy especially that with this win I’ve consolidated my lead in the standings." [...] He said for the season's next race at Silverstone his team need to improve his car in qualifying trim and then aim to secure victory in the feature race. Quaife-Hobbs said it felt [...] "amazing" [...] to clinch his first career podium, [...] "Today, it’s a great reward for the team and how hard they’ve worked. We are a new team. Now every new team have had a podium." [...] Quaife-Hobbs believed if he had defended from Coletti on the third lap both drivers would not have entered the Novelle Chicane and affirmed that he elected to follow Coletti with the view for a attack later in the race. Third-place finisher Evans revealed on the formation lap he struggled to get the optimum rear tyre temperature especially {{since the start of the}} race was the best time to gain track position and was aware that finishing on the podium would probably not be realistic. Nevertheless he was happy to have again finished on the Monaco podium after altering his car.|$|E
500|$|Shortz was {{the first}} guest star the {{producers}} of The Simpsons approached. Long later asked Reagle to make puzzles for the episode. Reagle recorded his lines in a studio near his home. Reagle told the Arizona Daily Wildcat that [...] "for me, {{to be such a}} total nut for animation <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>kid,</b> I never even dreamed [...] It's like a dream I never had coming true." [...] He added that [...] "you don't see [...] in the episode for very long, but when crossword fans watch this show, we want them to think that we got it right." [...] Reagle designed every puzzle that appears in the episode, including one that appears in a hopscotch court in Lisa's daydream. There were certain lines in the script that had to be incorporated into Reagle's puzzles, including one where Gil says [...] "I think I'll throw some Q's around,", and he enters a number of Q's onto the grid. Reagle therefore had to create a puzzle which used words that included the letter Q more frequently than would be usual. Reagle said he saw the early script of the episode, [...] "but they change it right up to the last minute. In a lot of ways, I'll be seeing {{it for the first time}} right along with everyone else." [...] Scott Thompson has a cameo in the episode as Grady, a character that he first voiced in the season 14 episode [...] "Three Gays of the Condo".|$|E

2500|$|In October 2008, Cleverly {{landed a}} shot at the vacant Commonwealth light heavyweight title topping the bill {{for the first time in}} his career at the Everton Park Sports Centre in Liverpool. [...] His {{opponent}} was the experienced former British champion Tony Oakey who he beat on points over 12 rounds. [...] Speaking after picking up his first belt Cleverly said [...] "What a memorable night for me, winning a title is something I have dreamed of <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>kid...</b> I have worked hard for this but this is just the start for me – I want to rule the world." ...|$|E
2500|$|McIlroy {{is a fan}} of Manchester United. In his {{acceptance}} speech following his 2014 Open Championship win at Royal Liverpool, McIlroy addressed the crowd by joking; [...] "Even though I'm a Man United fan standing here," [...] which saw him booed in jest by archrival Liverpool fans, before he thanked them for their great support. McIlory also plays the sport in his spare time. He injured ankle ligaments in 2015 while playing football with friends which forced him to miss the 2015 Open Championship, but states he won't give up playing: [...] "I’m not going to stop doing what I do. I enjoy having that normality in my life. I’ve done it <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> and won’t stop.” McIlroy is also a fan of Ulster Rugby. He often interrupts his busy golfing schedule to attend rugby matches at the Kingspan Stadium in Belfast.|$|E

5000|$|According to {{lead singer}} Reggie Youngblood, the track was {{inspired}} by Jacksonville's dance party scene: he realized that usually, he would end up with girls who couldn't dance. The line [...] "You are the girl, that I've been dreaming of, ever <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> little girl" [...] <b>is</b> based on <b>an</b> inside joke between Reggie and his sister Ali Youngblood where they would refer to wanting something as [...] "Ever <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> little girl".|$|R

He's a mild, hopeless sort of chump who spends all his time at home--they live near Philadelphia--and has never been known to come to New York. He's writing a history of the family, or something, I believe.|$|E

He {{had to find a way}} of holding me for a while and postponing the {{squaring}} of accounts while he got away, and he invented this twin-brother business. He knew I should find out sooner or later, but meanwhile he would be able to get off to South America, which he has done. He's on his way now." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{had known}} the family ever <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>kid,</b> and from boyhood up this old boy had put the fear of death into me. Time, the great healer, could never remove from my memory the {{occasion}} when he found me--then a stripling of fifteen--smoking one of his special cigars in the stables. He got after me with a hunting-crop just {{at the moment when}} I was beginning to realise that what I wanted most on earth was solitude and repose, and chased me more than a mile across difficult country. If there was a flaw, so to speak, in the pure joy of being engaged to Florence, {{it was the fact that}} she rather took after her father, and one was never certain when she might erupt. She had a wonderful profile, though.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wonder if}} I {{can get some}} advice from you," [...] he began, and {{received}} an acquiescence of willingness that made his heart bound. [...] "You remember the other time I was here I said I couldn't talk about books an' things because I didn't know how? Well, I've ben doin' a lot of thinkin' ever since. I've ben to the library a whole lot, {{but most of the}} books I've tackled have ben over my head. Mebbe I'd better begin at the beginnin'. I ain't never had no advantages.

You know the books you find in cattle- camps an' fo'c's'ls ain't the same you've got in this house, for instance. Well, that's the sort of readin' matter I've ben accustomed to. And yet--an' I ain't just makin' a brag of it--I've ben different from the people I've herded with. Not that I'm any better than the sailors an' cow-punchers I travelled with,--I was cow-punchin' for a short time, you know,--but I always liked books, read everything I could lay hands on, an'--well, I guess I think differently from most of 'em.|$|E
