25|$|Boyle's Law {{was perhaps}} the first {{expression}} of an equation of state. In 1662 Robert Boyle performed a series of experiments employing a J-shaped glass tube, which was sealed on one end. Mercury {{was added to the}} tube, trapping a fixed quantity of air in the short, sealed end of the tube. Then the volume of gas was carefully measured as additional mercury was added to the tube. The pressure of the gas could be determined by the difference between the mercury level in the <b>short</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tube and that in the long, open end. The image of Boyle's Equipment shows some of the exotic tools used by Boyle during his study of gases.|$|E
25|$|Adult seals {{more than}} one year old must be shot in the head with {{expanding}} bullets, and cannot be clubbed to death. The hakapik shall be used to ensure the animal is dead. This is done by crushing the skull of the shot adult seal with the <b>short</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hakapik, before the long spike is thrust deep into the animal's brain. The seal is then bled by making an incision from its jaw to the end of its sternum. The killing and bleeding must be done on the ice, and live animals may never be brought on board the ship. Young seals may be killed using just the hakapik, but only in the aforementioned manner, i.e., they need not be shot.|$|E

500|$|Michael Schumacher and Jacques Villeneuve vied for {{the title}} in [...] Villeneuve, driving the {{superior}} Williams FW19, led the championship {{in the early part}} of the season. However, by mid-season, Schumacher had taken the championship lead, winning five races, and entered the season's final Grand Prix with a one-point advantage. Towards the end of the race, held at Jerez, Schumacher's Ferrari developed a coolant leak and loss of performance indicating he may not finish the race. As Villeneuve approached to pass his rival, Schumacher attempted to provoke an accident, but got the <b>short</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stick, retiring from the race.

500|$|At some point, however, {{disagreements}} over funding evidently arose between the McDonald brothers and Hogan. On February 18, 1907, the Zanesville Signal reported that Hogan had received permission from [...] "the Messrs.

The following day, Hogan was quoted as saying, [...] "Youngstown couldn't or didn't raise enough money to cover a sparrow's blanket". The ball club manager's evident frustration during this period was reflected in comments published in The Youngstown Daily Vindicator almost a week after the team's sale. When questioned on his widely publicized decision to resign as manager of the Youngstown club before the opening of the 1907 season, Hogan reportedly said that he had received [...] "the <b>short</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deal".

500|$|Several reviews {{criticized the}} changes made to Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock {{compared}} to previous {{games in the}} Guitar Hero series. IGN's review of the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions considered the game a [...] "pretty safe effort" [...] from Neversoft, doing little to change the game due to it being their first time working on the series. [...] They also criticized the lack of customizable characters. IGN's review of the Wii version described the game's presentation and art direction as feeling [...] "forced", and, as a result, less visually appealing than previous installments. GameDaily questioned the [...] "white boy soundtrack" [...] and {{would have liked to}} have seen more tracks from legends like Jimi Hendrix and Prince in the mix." [...] GameSpy criticized some of the difficulty tweaks in the game. They stated that [...] "Medium simply feels like Hard-minus-the-orange-button," [...] and that the Star Power phrases were too long, comparing the overall game to a [...] "trial by fire" [...] in contrast to the previous games in the series. They were also critical of the dongle approach used for the PlayStation 3 controllers, and failings in the online support for the PlayStation 3 version. GameSpot criticized the game for its [...] "heavy dose of in-game advertising." [...] GameSpy stated that the PlayStation 2 version received [...] "the <b>short</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stick" [...] because of a lack of online play. Official Xbox Magazine also criticized the game for being [...] "too competitive", a facet not readily found in the previous games. The PC version has been criticized for its high system requirements, and for lag and slowdown problems even on high-end systems.|$|E

He {{had a large}} {{repertoire of}} practiced shots—more than 500—affording him the luxury to not having to repeat a single shot during a week-long exhibition. The abundance of shots was unusual, and was described by one sports writer as [...] "more extensive than the entire billiard fraternity put together". The following description of Adams' shots appeared in an 1891 newspaper article, which highlighted them as, [...] "among his difficult feats":Two quart wine bottles are placed at the <b>short</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> table, three feet apart; a ball {{is placed on the}} top of each bottle, and a third ball, six feet from the bottles in the opposite corner. Adams makes the hand ball jump from bottle to bottle then to take an English in space, counting on the third bail, a double shot.Fifteen balls are placed in a line, three inches apart. On the last ball is placed a piece of chalk, while two feet from the other end, at a square angle, is placed a single ball. Yank drops the hand ball with a Massé twist, which, after hitting the single ball, describes a semi-circle, taken the cushion first, then makes a carrom on the fifteen balls, but is played with such a delicate calculation as barely to reach the last ball; in fact, freezes against it so gently as not to dislodge the chalk previously placed thereon.A derby hat is placed on the table, under which is a ball. One foot from the hat are two balls a foot apart, which he carroms on, the hand ball continues striking the rim of the hat, forces it up, and goes under making the stroke on the third ball, then returns from under the hat when it rocks the second time.He also stand {{at the head of the}} table, throwing the balls with a hundred-yard force but has them stop eight feet away in such a position as to spell his name.|$|E

On <b>the</b> other hand at this <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> term structure, the results do indicate that <b>the</b> term structure <b>of</b> nominal interest rates contain a great deal <b>of</b> information about <b>the</b> term structure <b>of</b> real interest rates. This finding is quite important because it suggests that researchers can examine observable data on <b>the</b> <b>shortest</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nominal term structure to provide them with information about <b>the</b> behavior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> real term structure. For maturities of nine and twelve months, the term structure does appear to contain information about <b>the</b> future path <b>of</b> inflation in <b>the</b> full sample period and in the sub-periods before October 1982.
