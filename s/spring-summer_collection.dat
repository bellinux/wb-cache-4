50|$|Not {{everyone}} {{was pleased with}} the New Look, however. Some considered the amount of material to be wasteful, especially after years of cloth rationing. Feminists in particular were outraged, feeling that these corseted designs were restrictive and regressive, and that they took away a woman's independence. Fellow designer Coco Chanel remarked, “Only a man who never was intimate with a woman could design something that uncomfortable.” Despite such protests, the New Look was highly influential, continuing to inform the work of other designers and fashion well into the 2010s.
