Only two British power stations {{had previously been}} fitted with such equipment: Battersea power station and Fulham power station. At Bankside flue-gases from the boilers were washed with a three-pass counter-current/co-current flow of river water from the Thames (to which chalk was added) in cedar wood scrubber towers. This process produced a characteristic white plume from the chimney. The plant was effective at removing sulphur compounds from the flue-gases (over its operational life it achieved an overall average <b>sulphur</b> <b>removal</b> efficiency of 97.2%). However, the process cooled the gases which caused ‘plume-droop’ under certain atmospheric conditions, causing a fume nuisance at ground level. Contaminated water from the flue-gas washing plant was treated in tanks through which air was bubbled, this oxidised the sulphite to sulphate, the water was diluted with water from the condensers before being returned to the river.

40|$|The {{cleanliness}} {{of steel}} {{with respect to}} non-metallic inclusions and the precise alloy compositions in the steel products have always been of great concern in steel making technology. The development of steel making process to meet the compositional requirements for specific mechanical properties such as ductility, toughness, fatigue and machinability requires dynamic and continuous investigations. The refining of molten steel in the ladle furnace to meet the required compositional range requires the optimisation of the process parameters. For <b>sulphur</b> <b>removal</b> control, parameters such as argon gas flow rate through the porous plugs, inductive stirring effect, vacuum pressure of the tank degasser, amount & composition of the top slag should be optimised. In this thesis project an investigation was carried out on {{the factors that influence}} the top slag composition before vacuum treatment and also to optimise the top slag composition for precise <b>sulphur</b> <b>removal.</b> 12 heats were followed during the project: slag samples, steel samples, temperature and oxygen activities were taken at eight different process stages at Ovako steel mill. A relatively large variation was observed for all the oxide components of the slag phase before vacuum treatment in all the heats followed. A PLS analysis made shows that topslag composition before degassing is influenced by the amount of slag former added, oxygen potential at tapping, the yield of Al and Si deoxidants into the steel at tapping. The model has a poor predictability because some important parameters such as ladle glaze condition, amount of EAF slag tapped and refractory wear could not be measured. An alternative solution of extra slag practice was suggested instead of modelling the composition and mass of carry over slag left after slag removal. The extra slag practice involves the addition of lime during tapping so as to aid the removal of all the slag before ladle refining and thus optimisation of the new synthetic slag for precise <b>sulphur</b> <b>removal</b> could be easily achieved.

40|$|Now a day, {{because of}} the {{dramatic}} environmental impact of sulfur oxides contained in engines emissions, sulfur content specification in fuels {{are becoming more and}} more stringent worldwide. In the petroleum refining industry, hydrodesulfurization (HDS) is the conventional process to reduce the sulfur levels of the fuels. However, HDS is cost consuming, besides requiring high temperature and high hydrogen pressure in order to eliminate the aliphatic and alicyclic sulfur compounds. Refractory sulfur compounds such as dibenzothiophene (DBT), methyl dibenzothiophene and 4, 6 -methyl dibenzothiophene are less reactive to this process. Due to this reason, alternative sulfur removal techniques are being explored. In the past years, due to its unique properties both as extractant and also as catalyst, ionic liquids have gained increasing interest. 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate [EMIM][BF 4], has been study in this work. These ionic liquids were characterized using Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The ionic liquids were then screened for sulfur removal from model oil (dodecane).

40|$|Desulphurization of {{gas phase}} sulphur {{compounds}} has been receiving dramatic attention since hazardous, corrosive, and toxic gases that cause environmental damages (especially acid rain) and industrial challenges (i. e., corrosion {{of equipment and}} deactivation of catalysts). This dissertation presents results of R&D efforts to develop efficient MeOx/SBA- 15 -based sorbents for H 2 S removal in view of possible applications in hydrogen purification, air pollution control, and deep desulphurization of fossil fuels. It is precisely in the latter topic that the research project was born. The production of power, fuels and chemicals in most countries is predominantly based on oil and, to a minor extent, on natural gas. It is well-known that the reserves of both of these fuels are limited {{to a range of}} 40, 60 years. On the contrary, coal is a widely available fossil fuel, and it is expected to last for about 230 years. The imminent oil production limitations and the longer availability of coal, the wish to improve the security of the energy supply, and the possibility to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by means of carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) are sufficient motivations to increase the use of this resource. Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) process is a high efficiency power generation technology which gasifies coal to generate the fuel (syngas) for a high efficiency gas turbine. A key challenge for producing clean power or hydrogen via gasification is cost effective purification of the sour syngas. There are many commercial treatment techniques that are used to remove H 2 S, but their disadvantage is that hot coal gas must be cooled down near to ambient temperature for desulphurization. The cooling equipment required, and the need to reheat the clean syngas before its use in a gas turbine result in economic and thermodynamic penalties that decrease the efficiency of a gasification plant. It {{is for this reason that}} hot gas desulphurization technique has attracted more and more attention due to the fact that it can reduce H 2 S down to 100 ppm level and avoid heat loss. Mid-temperature desulphurization is achieved by the use of solid sorbents such as oxides of those metals that form stable sulphides, based on the non-catalytic reaction between a metal oxide and hydrogen sulphide. The optimum desulphurization temperature has been recommended in the range of 300 to 450 °C, also in according to the more favourable thermodynamic equilibrium of <b>sulphur</b> compounds <b>removal.</b> To accomplish this task, Zinc oxide- and Iron oxide-based materials have been successfully employed for decades in different domains of the chemical industry. The pure metal oxides used as sorbents, however, suffer from evaporation, loss in the surface area and porosity due to sintering and mechanical disintegration that affect their performance and life time adversely. With the purpose of overcoming this problem and to improve their performance, metal oxides can be confined into a support, where under such conditions the materials are stable. The main properties required for support materials are inertness, high surface area, large pores and good mechanical strength. The thesis reports some simple and versatile routes which can be proposed to prepare a great variety of MeOx/SBA- 15 composites where the mesostructured SBA- 15 silica, a high-surface area (up to 1000 m 2 /g) material, with 6 – 7 nm-wide regular channels and thick (3 – 4 nm) pore walls has been used as efficient and stable support. MeOx active phase, formed inside the mesochannels, can reach the maximum size of 6 - 7 nm physically imposed by the pore diameter. Such a structure provides an ideal reactor where the mesopores act as channels for the transport of reactant. As a consequence, enhancement of the active phase reactivity might be expected. The proposed “Two-solvents” incipient impregnation method is easily reproducible and easy to scale up. Furthermore, this method should provide, at least in principle, ideal systems to be compared, and therefore to understand how the active phase nature influence their performance. For the first time, a careful comparative study on the effect of the different nature of the nanostructured MeOx (Me = Zn, Fe) dispersed into a mesostructured silica matrix (SBA- 15) on the H 2 S removal performance is carried out. The behaviour of the MeOx/SBA- 15 composites in the removal of H 2 S is investigated in a fixed-bed reactor and compared with that of an unsupported ZnO commercial sorbent. The morphological, structural, and textural features of fresh, sulphided, and regenerated sorbents have been assessed by a multi-technique approach, including the study of the possible interactions between the guest oxide and the host silica support. Furthermore, the sorption-desorption behaviour, which is commonly justified only on the basis of the different nature of the active phase and of the textural features (surface area and pore volume), is discussed also considering the morphology and the crystallinity of the active phase. In the literature, to our best knowledge, no one have reported similar correlations. For this reason this work can give an important contribution to improve the basic knowledge in the field of sorbents for gas-removal...|$|R

The removal by 3 % SMC amendment applied twice accounted for 56 - 64 %, 31 [...] 33 % and 51 [...] 54 % disappearance of the TPH, oil and grease and DEHP contaminants, respectively. Beside chemical analysis, six bacteria and six fungi were inoculated into the sterilized soil samples for ecotoxicity tests. The original soil samples containing residual oil and DEHP contents were found to be more toxic than the SMC-treated soil. Thus SMC simultaneously degrades organic pollutants and reduces toxicity in less than a month. An underground water sample contaminated with dibutyl phthalate (DBP, 127. 5 +/- 20. 7 mu 1 / 1) and DEHP (67. 0 +/- 7. 7 mu 1 / 1) was tested. One percent SMC could remove 94. 2 +/- 3. 6 % and 100 % for DBP and DEHP, respectively, within 1 h at room temperature. DBP and DEHP were degraded completely by SMCE except 0. 2 % SMCE for DBP after 24 -h treatment. SMC had higher removal efficiencies than SMCE, because SMC had an integrated system of biosorption and biodegradation to remove DBP and DEHP. The sorption kinetics of DBP and DEHP by SMC could be described by the Freundlich monolayer model. Even after eight cycles of the sorption-desorption of DEHP SMC maintained the 100 % removal efficiency. Thus SMC is a good biosorbent for DEHP. Besides, DEHP-contaminated sediment was collected from Kai Tak Approach Channel, Kowloon. This sediment contained 44. 4 - 128. 0 mg/kg DEHP and heavy metals 21. 3 - 23. 4 mg/kg Cd, 24. 9 - 43. 5 mg/kg Ni, 128. 5 - 198. 5 mg/kg Pb, 144. 6 - 329. 2 mg/kg Zn and 164. 5 - 230. 0 mg/kg Cu, and bore an unpleasant sewer smell. SMC and SMCE as strong oxidizing agents could decrease the S content of sediment significantly as well as calcium nitrate, and consequently lowered the evolution of nuisance gas hydrogen sulfide. With the treatment of the optimized combination of 2. 25 % SMCE and 0. 25 % nitrate, the malodor could be removed completely and the contents of H 2 S and NH 3 in the air were decreased significantly. For the degradation of organic pollutants, the target pollutant DEHP showed a sharp decrease in the first week in the time effect experiment after the treatment with the combination of 2. 25 % SMCE and 0. 25 % nitrate, while the decrease of DEHP slowed down in the second week. The results may be attributed to the immediate degradation of DEHP by enzymes in SMCE. When raw sediment and nitrate-treated sediment were bioremediated with SMCE, larger fluctuation in DEHP removal was observed with the nitrate-treated sediment. It supports that nitrate and SMCE would act in optimum at a certain combination. The effect on mobilization of sediment heavy metals by SMC or SMCE was also examined. Although some laboratory results suggested reduction of copper and lead, other results using different environmental samples of the sediment did not reproduce the results. Further investigation is needed. Plasticizers are additives used in the manufacture of plastics, and high residual plasticizer levels are encountered in the environment. Bis(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), being the most common plasticizer, is a suspected human carcinogen and an endocrine disruptor. Therefore, DEHP-contaminated soil, sediment and water samples were collected, and the bioremediation capacities of the spent compost of mushroom Pleurotus pulmonarius (SMC) were determined. This study reveals the potential in applying SMC of P. pulmonarius in bioremediation of DEHP from the soil, sediment and water environments. More investigation and field studies would be appropriate for developing spent P. pulmonarius compost in environmental cleanup. Using artificially spiked garden soil with DEHP and ultra-low <b>sulphur</b> diesel, the <b>removal</b> efficiencies of SMC were 41. 7 +/- 9. 8 % and 36. 1 +/- 8. 4 % for TP 11 and DEHP, respectively. SMCE which contained the water-soluble nutrients, SMC enzymes and micro-organisms had about half removal efficiency of SMC on the same pollutant. The enriched SMC microorganisms also showed biodegradation of DEHP and diesel, so did the filtrate containing enzymes and nutrients of SMC. Thus SMC acted in multiple ways in bioremediation of DEHP: biostimulation and bioaugmentation. Besides, the immobilized lignolytic enzymes of the mushroom P. pulmonarius {{played a major role in}} biodegradation. Gao, Ting. "October 2009. "Adviser: S. W. Chiu.
