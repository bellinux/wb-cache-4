5|$|Herpetic keratoconjunctivitis, {{a primary}} infection, {{typically}} presents as <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conjunctiva and eyelids (blepharoconjunctivitis), accompanied by small white itchy lesions {{on the surface}} of the cornea.|$|E
5|$|Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD or OD) {{is a joint}} {{disorder}} in which cracks form in the articular cartilage and the underlying subchondral bone. OCD usually causes pain and <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> affected joint which catches and locks during movement. Physical examination typically reveals an effusion, tenderness, and a crackling sound with joint movement.|$|E
5|$|The {{pressure}} {{around the}} brain may rise, causing papilledema (<b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> optic disc) {{which may be}} experienced as visual obscurations. In severely raised intracranial pressure, the level of consciousness is decreased, the blood pressure rises, the heart rate falls and the patient assumes an abnormal posture.|$|E
30|$|Clay {{containing}} formations {{are easily}} hydrated by water and swell. <b>The</b> use <b>of</b> aqueous-based fluids can cause <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> clay. <b>The</b> <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> claying {{can lead to}} an unstable wellbore, stuck pipe and damage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fracture by migration of fines. Fracture fluids should be selected to minimize <b>the</b> <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> clay. <b>The</b> use <b>of</b> 2  % KCl in water-based fluids and other chemicals can prevent clay swelling.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND Thyroglossal cysts are {{the most}} common cause of {{congenital}} cyst formation in the neck that may present at any age. Classically, it presents as an anterior midline neck swelling that moves with deglutition and protrusion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tongue. Occasionally, thyroglossal cyst present clinically in atypical manner, which may pose a diagnostic challenge. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients came to outpatient department with anterior neck <b>swellings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> neck during the period from June 2014 till May 2015 were included in this study. <b>Swellings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thyroid gland are excluded.

5|$|The viral {{infection}} that causes croup leads to <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> larynx, trachea, and large bronchi due to infiltration of {{white blood cells}} (especially histiocytes, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and neutrophils). Swelling produces airway obstruction which, when significant, leads to dramatically increased work of breathing and the characteristic turbulent, noisy airflow known as stridor.|$|E
5|$|About 5% of {{all people}} are {{diagnosed}} only when they develop fulminant acute liver failure, often {{in the context of}} a hemolytic anemia (anemia due to the destruction of red blood cells). This leads to abnormalities in protein production (identified by deranged coagulation) and metabolism by the liver. The deranged protein metabolism leads to the accumulation of waste products such as ammonia in the bloodstream. When these irritate the brain, the person develops hepatic encephalopathy (confusion, coma, seizures and finally life-threatening <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brain).|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} discovery Wigner {{made during}} the project was the Wigner effect. This is a <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> graphite moderator caused by the displacement of atoms by neutron radiation. The Wigner effect was a serious problem for the reactors at the Hanford Site in the immediate post-war period, and resulted in production cutbacks and a reactor being shut down entirely. It was eventually discovered {{that it could be}} overcome by controlled heating and annealing.|$|E

50|$|Both kinds, {{moistened}} with vinegar, have <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> dispersing tumours and arresting defluxions. They are curative also <b>of</b> inflammatory <b>swellings</b> and imposthumes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parotid glands; and, applied topically, {{they are}} good for affections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spleen and pustules on the body. With <b>the</b> addition <b>of</b> aphronitrum, oil of cypros, and vinegar, they reduce <b>swellings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> feet, care being taken to apply the lotion in the sun, and at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> six hours to wash it off with salt and water.|$|R

5|$|Encephalopathy often occurs {{together}} with other symptoms and signs of liver failure. These may include jaundice (yellow discolouration of the skin and the whites of the eyes), ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity), and peripheral edema (<b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> legs due to fluid build-up in the skin). The tendon reflexes may be exaggerated, and the plantar reflex may be abnormal, namely extending rather than flexing (Babinski's sign) in severe encephalopathy. A particular smell (foetor hepaticus) may be detected.|$|E
5|$|Hypothyroidism, {{also called}} underactive thyroid or low thyroid, {{is a common}} {{disorder}} of the endocrine {{system in which the}} thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone. It can cause a number of symptoms, such as poor ability to tolerate cold, a feeling of tiredness, constipation, depression, and weight gain. Occasionally there may be <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> front part of the neck due to goitre. Untreated hypothyroidism during pregnancy can lead to delays in growth and intellectual development in the baby, which is called cretinism.|$|E
5|$|Like other mambas {{the eastern}} green mamba {{is a highly}} venomous snake. The venom {{consists}} of both neurotoxins and cardiotoxins. The toxicity of individual specimens can vary greatly based on several factors including geographical region, age, seasonal variation, diet, and so on. Symptoms of envenomation by this species include <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bite site, dizziness and nausea, accompanied by difficulty breathing and swallowing, irregular heartbeat and convulsions progressing to respiratory paralysis. Bites that produce severe envenomation can be rapidly fatal.|$|E

5|$|Other bite {{symptoms}} {{that may occur}} in humans include edema, which may become extensive, shock, watery blood oozing from the puncture wounds, nausea and vomiting, subcutaneous bruising, blood blisters that may form rapidly, and a painful <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> regional lymph nodes. Swelling usually decreases after a few days, except for the area immediately around the bite site. Hypotension, together with weakness, dizziness and periods of semi- or unconsciousness is also reported.|$|E
5|$|Recently the Canning Dam {{has been}} {{subjected}} to considerable cracking of the upper parts of the dam and upper gallery. Investigations have shown that cracking was due to strong AAR (alkali aggregate reactivity) in the concrete. AAR results in <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concrete, which may cause secondary compressive stresses, localised map cracks, and, ultimately structural cracks. In addition, the concrete tensile strength and elasticity significantly decreases. Many old concrete dams are known to suffer from AAR, including Fontana Dam in Tennessee and Pian Telessio dam in Italy among others.|$|E
5|$|Small {{children}} with DKA are relatively prone to cerebral edema (<b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brain tissue), which may cause headache, coma, {{loss of the}} pupillary light reflex, and progress to death.

5|$|The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{warned in}} 2014 that {{over-the-counter}} acne products containing benzoyl peroxide and/or salicylic acid, including Proactiv, can cause severe irritation, {{as well as}} rare but life-threatening allergic reactions. Consumers were advised to stop using the products if they experience hives or itching, and to seek emergency medical attention if they feel faint, or experience throat tightness, breathing problems, or <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eyes, face, lips or tongue. The FDA noted that it remains unclear whether the reactions are caused by the active ingredients, inactive ingredients or a combination.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A 42 -year-old {{woman from}} Culiacan in <b>the</b> Sinaloa State <b>of</b> Mexico {{presented}} with a four-year history of migratory, pruritic, painful <b>swellings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> face. Palpebral edema with conjunctival erythema developed when lesions developed near the eye. Routine eye examination showed a mobile worm in the anterior chamber. Following surgical removal, the parasite was identified by light and electron microscopy as an advanced third-stage larva of Gnathostoma sp.

5|$|The most {{recognized}} {{marker of}} acute Chagas disease is called Romaña's sign, which includes <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eyelids {{on the side}} of the face near the bite wound or where the bug feces were deposited or accidentally rubbed into the eye. Rarely, young children, or adults may die from the acute disease due to severe inflammation/infection of the heart muscle (myocarditis) or brain (meningoencephalitis). The acute phase also can be severe in people with weakened immune systems.|$|E
5|$|The unique {{crest of}} Saurolophus {{is made up}} almost {{completely}} by the nasal bones, and in S. angustirostris it is solid. In adult specimens the crests are a rounded triangular shape in cross section. The crest protrudes past {{the edge of the}} skull backwards. Thin processes from the frontals and prefrontals extend along the underside of the crest, probably to strengthen it. At the end of the crest is a <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nasal, which is often termed differently.|$|E
5|$|Wilson's {{disease is}} a genetic {{disorder}} in which copper builds up in the body. Symptoms are typically related to the brain and liver. Liver related symptoms include vomiting, weakness, fluid build up in the abdomen, <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> legs, yellowish skin, and itchiness. Brain related symptoms include tremors, muscle stiffness, trouble speaking, personality changes, anxiety, and seeing or hearing things that others do not.|$|E
30|$|As {{cross-linking}} temperature (65 – 85  °C) increases, <b>the</b> degree <b>of</b> equilibrium <b>swelling</b> decreases {{and thus}} <b>the</b> selectivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> composite membrane increases. Some observations show reducing the chain length between the cross-linking. Reducing chains between cross-linking increases <b>the</b> elastic resistance <b>of</b> <b>swelling</b> stress in composite membranes and thus <b>the</b> <b>swelling</b> degree <b>of</b> <b>the</b> membrane reduces. Thereby, reducing <b>the</b> degree <b>of</b> <b>swelling</b> increases <b>the</b> selectivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> composite membranes to sulfur compounds and ultimately <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> sulfur in <b>the</b> backflow reduces.|$|R
