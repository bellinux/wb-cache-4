40|$|Prawn farming {{effluent}} nitrogen is {{a potential}} polluter of coastal waterways. Consequently, environmental regulators are placing increasingly stringent discharge limitations on farmers, fuelling research into the development of cost-effective effluent treatment options. One such treatment option involves the cultivation of <b>secondary,</b> often detritivorous, <b>crops</b> (fish, prawns) {{in the presence of}} vertically deployed artificial substrates. <b>Secondary</b> <b>crops</b> could valuably assimilate effluent nutrients while the artificial substrate should improve bacterial effluent remediation processes, such as denitrification and nitrogen assimilation. Artificial substrates may also improve water quality and detritivore growth in systems containing detritivores. Furthermore, detritivorous <b>secondary</b> <b>crops</b> may improve substrate associated nutrient removal processes. The combination of substrates and <b>secondary</b> <b>crops</b> therefore, may enhance nutrient removal relative to their singular effects. The investigations outlined in this thesis have provided new knowledge regarding the cultivation of <b>secondary</b> <b>crops</b> in prawn farm effluent treatment systems containing artificial substrates. Detritivorous mullet assimilated effluent nutrients, and, artificial substrates improved both water quality and fish growth. At optimised C:N ratios, banana prawns were found to stimulate nitrogen assimilation and mullet enhanced substrate biofilm denitrification. Both grey mullet and banana prawns showed the potential to stimulate bacterial effluent remediation by increasing bacterial growth rates. The herbivorous S. Nebulosus, and to a lesser degree M. cephalus, showed they could be effective at harvesting, and assimilating, opportunistic macroalgae during effluent treatment.

40|$|AbstractThe use of food-crop {{intercropping}}, {{hedgerow intercropping}} and <b>secondary</b> or cover <b>cropping</b> to increase incomes of resource-poor farmers in South East Asia was investigated. Since all systems improve conservation of nutrients and most give extra marketable produce, {{they were expected}} to increase farm profitability. On upland farms in Lampung, South Sumatra, both inter- and <b>secondary</b> <b>crops</b> were found to improve yields compared with cassava monocropping and thus the income derived from growing cassava or rice with maize. These increases were equivalent to between 70 and 440 US dollars per hectare. An economic analysis of the lowland rice-producing systems in North East Thailand suggested that with the exception of growing cowpea, the use of pre-rice cover crops was not profitable despite a substantial increase in rice yield, because the additional labour cost more than the additional income was worth. A benefit of leguminous crops, however, can be the extra marketable product. Groundnut in Indonesia and cowpea in Thailand gave an attractive extra US$ 400 – 1150 total income increase per hectare per year (i. e. extra yield of the main food crop plus extra marketable produce from the <b>secondary</b> <b>crop)</b> even after the additional costs were deducted. Hedgerow intercropping gave smaller profit margins of about US$ 90. Although both hedgerow intercropping and <b>secondary</b> <b>cropping</b> represent a considerable investment of labour by farmers, this investment may be more feasible than paying for fertilizer on credit. On balance the most attractive option tested was the use of a leguminous <b>secondary</b> <b>crop,</b> e. g. groundnut or multipurpose cowpea, within the food crop cycle...|$|R
