5|$|Morgan did {{not stay}} long in Port Royal and in October 1668 sailed with ten ships and 800 men for Île-à-Vache, {{a small island}} he used as a {{rendezvous}} point. His plan was to attack the Spanish settlement of Cartagena de Indias, the richest and most important city on the Spanish Main. In December he was joined by a former Royal Navy frigate, Oxford, which {{had been sent to}} Port Royal to aid in any defence of Jamaica. Modyford sent the vessel to Morgan, who made it his flagship. On 2 January 1669 Morgan called a council of war for all his captains, which took place on Oxford. A spark in the ship's powder magazine destroyed the ship and over 200 of its crew. Morgan and the captains seated on one <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> were blown into the water and survived; the four captains on the other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> were all killed.|$|E
5|$|According to Prime Minister Einar Gerhardsen, it took long {{to persuade}} Meisdalshagen to even take the post as Minister of Finance, {{and he was}} more {{interested}} in agro-economical questions than traditional planning of the economy. It was even said that Gerhardsen's Cabinet had an interest in luring Meisdalshagen away from the Parliament, where he had driven through significant increases in farmer's income, threatening the overall balance and planning of the state finances. In fact the income from farming, measured in the amount of money earned per decare, was doubled between the war's end in 1945 and 1950, when the Main Agreement for Agriculture, , was introduced. It regulated future price negotiations, and institutionalized the negotiating partners: the state on one <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> the Norwegian Agrarian Association and the Norwegian Farmers and Smallholders Union on the other.|$|E

5|$|On the upper-left side of what {{is today}} {{considered}} {{the back of the}} vessel, the mask of young Pan {{can be seen in the}} tree. Below, a goat is reaching for ripened grapes. Behind the goat lies fruit and a table, most likely an anclabris with five ceremonial vessels on top. On the left <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> stands a small female figure, whose lit torches represent the festivities and the orgies associated with the cult's rites. Frédéric de Clarac argued that the statues could very well symbolize either Telete or Ceres, two deities often associated with Dionysus. Above the table is a tapestry and two bacchante masks. To the right, in an apple tree, another mask of Pan can be seen. Two more bacchante masks are present on the bottom, in front of the table.|$|E
5|$|What {{is today}} {{considered}} {{the front of}} the vessel depicts six masks surrounding an anclabris. The anclabris is depicted as if it were made out of marble, and two sphinxes—beings that serve as allegories for the secrets and mysteries of the Dionysian cult—are supporting the table. On the anclabris stands a small statue of Hermes, next to which hangs a mask with pipes. Above this mask may very well be the raven of Apollo. On the left <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> a goat is seen resting on the ground, surrounded by the symbols of the cult. Finally, a wicker basket can be found {{to the right of the}} table, out of which a snake emerges; this basket motif is often found in Dionysian artwork, and seemingly was an object of great importance to the religion.|$|E

25|$|The table {{setup is}} {{important}} as well, and individual place settings, {{moving from the}} diner's left should be as follows: rice bowl, spoon, then chopsticks. Hot foods are set to the right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> with the cold foods to the left. Soup must remain {{on the right side}} of the diner along with stews. Vegetables remain on the left along with the rice, and kimchi is set to the back while sauces remain in the front.|$|E
25|$|The script {{laid out}} quite {{specifically}} how characters were {{to move and}} behave, but the actors themselves chose how to bring these directions to life. For example, when Alec Hardy tells Ellie Miller that her husband is the murderer, the script called for Hardy to come round to Miller's <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> and for Miller to vomit after the revelation. David Tennant was allowed to improvise how he came round the table and whether he sat or stood. Olivia Colman improvised the portrayal of nausea by rising, crouching, turning to the wall, and vomiting. Director James Strong knew that this put stress on his technical crew, who often had to guess what technical adjustments {{had to be made}} (such as lighting or the placement of microphones) in order to accommodate this unusual style of direction and acting. But he felt this spontaneity freed the cast and permitted them to deliver far more intense performances. A heavy reliance was also placed on getting the first take right, as Strong believed the first take was more spontaneous and more natural. Subsequently, most of what the viewer sees in Broadchurch series one are first takes.|$|E

Adrian Fisher, State Department Legal Adviser and {{a close friend of}} Acheson, caught his arm, fortunately, because Acheson would have missed Wherry by about three feet and probably fallen flat on his face on the floor.

[...] That is what the West is expecting [...] us - to bring the killers of our brothers, to bring those who cut the noses of the Afghan women, to bring those who do suicide bombings in our wedding parties, to put them on the other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> and say, 'Brother, you represent our religion and I have lost my direction.

500|$|The {{peace process}} was a complex one, with four {{distinct}} groups involved, {{each with its}} own agenda. The first group was the Hutu hardliners, centred around the family of Agathe Habyarimana. They were represented by the CDR, as well as extremists within the president's own MRND party. This group opposed the entire peace process, being unwilling to cede any ground to the RPF or the Tutsi, whom they continued to brand as enemies. The second group was the official opposition, which excluded the CDR. They generally had much more democratic and conciliatory aims, but they also remained deeply suspicious of the RPF, whom they saw as trying to upset the [...] "democratic" [...] policy of Hutu rule established in the 1959 revolution. The third group was the RPF. Paul Kagame engaged with the peace process against the advice of some of his senior officers, and in the knowledge that many of those on the other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> were hardliners; he feared that shunning the opportunity for peace would weaken the RPF politically and lose them international goodwill. Finally, there was the group representing President Habyarimana himself, who sought primarily to hold on to his power in whatever form he could. This meant publicly striving for a middle ground compromise solution, but privately obstructing the process and trying to delay change to the status quo for as long as possible. Habyarimana recognised the danger posed to him by the radical Hutu faction and attempted in mid-1992 to remove them from senior army positions. This effort was only partially successful; akazu affiliates Augustin Ndindiliyimana and Théoneste Bagosora remained in influential posts, providing them with a link to power.|$|E

Each team usually also has a separate cup of water used to rinse off the ball.|$|E
2500|$|The {{game was}} {{originally}} {{believed to have}} evolved from the original beer pong played with paddles which is generally regarded to have had its origins within the fraternities of Dartmouth College in the U.S. in the 1950s and 1960s, where it has since {{become part of the}} social culture of the campus. The original version resembled an actual ping pong game with a net and one or more cups of beer on each <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> [...] Eventually, a version without paddles was created and the names Beer Pong and Beirut were adopted in some areas of the United States sometime in the 1980s.|$|E
