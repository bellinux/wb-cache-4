In such an application, the 'standard' resistor (Rs) will in reality be a sub-standard type (that is a resistor having an accuracy some 10 times better than the required accuracy of the <b>standard</b> <b>resistor</b> being calibrated). For such use, the error introduced by the mis-match of the ratio in the two potential arms {{would mean that the}} presence of the parasitic resistance Rpar could {{have a significant impact on}} the very high accuracy required. To minimise this problem, the current connections to the <b>standard</b> <b>resistor</b> (Rx); the sub-standard resistor (Rs) and the connection between them (Rpar) is designed to have as low a resistance as possible, and the connections both in the resistors and the bridge more resemble bus bars rather than wire.|$|E

The above formula requires the current in amperes, although this is usually given by the manufacturer in milliamperes, such as 20 mA.

50|$|The {{accuracy}} of measurements made using this bridge are dependent {{on a number of}} factors. The {{accuracy of}} the <b>standard</b> <b>resistor</b> (Rs) is of prime importance. Also of importance is how close the ratio of R1 to R2 is to the ratio of R&prime;1 to R&prime;2. As shown above, if the ratio is exactly the same, the error caused by the parasitic resistance (Rpar) is completely eliminated. In a practical bridge, the aim is to make this ratio as close as possible, but {{it is not possible to}} make it exactly the same. If the difference in ratio is small enough, then the last term of the balance equation above becomes small enough that it is negligible. Measurement accuracy is also increased by setting the current flowing through Rs and Rx to be as large as the rating of those resistors allows. This gives the greatest potential difference between the innermost potential connections (R2 and R&prime;2) to those resistors and consequently sufficient voltage for the change in R&prime;1 and R&prime;2 to have its greatest effect.|$|E

50|$|The {{operation}} of the Kelvin bridge {{is very similar to}} the Wheatstone bridge, but uses two additional resistors. Resistors R1 and R2 are connected to the outside potential terminals of the four terminal known or <b>standard</b> <b>resistor</b> Rs and the unknown resistor Rx (identified as P1 and P&prime;1 in the diagram). The resistors Rs, Rx, R1 and R2 are essentially a Wheatstone bridge. In this arrangement, the parasitic resistance of the upper part of Rs and the lower part of Rx is outside of the potential measuring part of the bridge and therefore are not included in the measurement. However, the link between Rs and Rx (Rpar) is included in the potential measurement part of the circuit and therefore can affect the accuracy of the result. To overcome this, a second pair of resistors R&prime;1 and R&prime;2 form a second pair of arms of the bridge (hence 'double bridge') and are connected to the inner potential terminals of Rs and Rx (identified as P2 and P&prime;2 in the diagram). The detector D is connected between the junction of R1 and R2 and the junction of R&prime;1 and R&prime;2.|$|E

40|$|Papers {{presented}} to the 11 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, South Africa, 20 - 23 July 2015. In this paper {{the influence of the}} resistor temperature coefficient to the uncertainty of the temperature measurement is presented. At the level of highest accuracy of the temperature measurements the standard platinum resistance thermometers (SPRT) in combination with an automatic resistance bridge and a <b>standard</b> <b>resistor</b> is used. The electrical resistance is like any other quantity more or less dependent on the temperature. This dependence is usually specified using the temperature coefficient, which gives the relative change of resistance, when the temperature changes for one °C. A temperature coefficient is also temperature dependent, so the relation between an electrical resistance and a temperature is given using the polynomial equations. These equations have an inflection point at a certain temperature, where the derivative of the resistance change on temperature (temperature coefficient) is equal to zero. The knowledge of the temperature of the inflection point is very important, because the use of the <b>standard</b> <b>resistor</b> at this temperature greatly reduces the influence of temperature on the electrical resistance, even if the thermal conditions are not optimal, and thus enabling low uncertainty and accurate measurements of the temperature using a SPRT. In the scope of this paper, measurements of the temperature coefficient are performed on series of a standard resistors in a wide temperature range and the temperature of the inflection point was determined for each <b>standard</b> <b>resistor.</b> All the measurements were performed by placing the resistors in an oil bath, where temperatures in the range from 19 °C to 37 °C could be precisely set. Electrical resistance of each resistor was measured using the precise automatic resistance bridge, which had its reference resistor placed in a separate thermal enclosure at constant temperature. Thus the resistor temperature coefficient of each <b>standard</b> <b>resistor</b> has been measured. It is influence to the uncertainty of the temperature measurement has been evaluated and uncertainty model presented.

40|$|An ultrastable low-noise current {{amplifier}} (ULCA) is presented. The ULCA is a non-cryogenic instrument {{based on}} specially designed operational amplifiers and resistor networks. It involves two stages, the first providing a 1000 -fold current gain {{and the second}} performing a current-to-voltage conversion via an internal 1 MOhm reference resistor or, optionally, an external <b>standard</b> <b>resistor.</b> The ULCA's transfer coefficient is extremely stable versus time, temperature and current amplitude within the full dynamic range of +/- 5 nA. A low noise level of 2. 4 fA/sqrt(Hz) helps to keep averaging times low at small input currents. A cryogenic current comparator is used to calibrate both input current gain and output transresistance, providing traceability to the quantum Hall effect. Typically, within one day after calibration, the uncertainty contribution from short-term fluctuations of the transresistance is below one part in 10 ^ 7. The long-term stability {{is expected to be}} better than one part in 10 ^ 5 over a year. A high-precision variant is available that shows a substantially improved stability at the expense of a higher noise level of 7. 5 fA/sqrt(Hz).

The device is a passive four resistor matrix that enables for 35 different resistances to be generated by parallel/series switching of the four base resistors. The device had been previously automated for easier use [6]. This eliminates the need for an operator to be present during calibration, the device can also be placed in an thermally stable enclosure and switched from within it. The software that was purposely developed for the automated work with the RBC 100 controls both the calibrator as well as gathers measurements from the instrument under test. The software also calculates non-linearity and keeps record of the measurements that were performed. During testing, two rounds of measurement sets were performed. During each round 3 sets of all 35 combinations were measured on every instrument under test. The multimeter type instruments nonlinearity was measured to be far lower than the declared uncertainty. The linearities of the resistance bridges were in most cases equal to the declared uncertainty value. This was however to be expected, since bridge nonlinearity accounts for the major part of its uncertainty.

The organic mass fraction, organic molecular composition, and relative humidity (RH) were varied to assess their effects separately on the N 2 O 5 uptake coefficient, γ(N 2 O 5). At a constant RH, mixtures of organic components having an O : C 0. 8) had a smaller or even negligible impact on N 2 O 5 (g) uptake at all RHs probed; however, a few exceptions were observed. Notably, γ(N 2 O 5) for mixtures of ammonium bisulfate with polyethylene glycol (PEG), PEG- 300 (O : C = 0. 56), decreased nearly linearly as the PEG mass fraction increased at constant RH until leveling off at the value measured for pure PEG. The response of γ(N 2 O 5) to increasing PEG mass fraction was similar to that measured on ambient atmospheric particles as a function of organic mass fraction. The effects of the organic mass fraction on γ(N 2 O 5), for mixtures having an O : C < ~ 0. 8, were best described using a <b>standard</b> <b>resistor</b> model of reactive uptake assuming the particles had an RH-dependent inorganic core–organic shell morphology. This model suggests that the N 2 O 5 diffusivity and/or solubility in the organic layer is up to a factor of 20 lower compared to aqueous solution particles, and that the diffusivity, solubility, and reactivity of N 2 O 5 within organic coatings and particles depend upon both RH and the molecular composition of the organic medium. We use these dependencies and ambient measurements of organic aerosol from the global aerosol mass spectrometry (AMS) database to show that the typical impact of organic aerosol components is to both uniformly decrease γ(N 2 O 5), by up to an order of magnitude depending on the RH, organic mass fraction, and O : C ratio, and to induce a stronger dependence of γ(N 2 O 5) upon RH compared to purely inorganic aqueous solutions...|$|E
40|$|Bibliography: leaf [70]The United States' {{electronic}} industry {{continues to}} look for better methods to control processes {{in order to improve}} yields and reduce costs. One area of concern in the thick film portion of the industry is the question of what effect the <b>standard</b> <b>resistor</b> printing and firing variables have on the negative Beta thick film thermistor. This study is an analysis of the effects on resistance and Beta with common variations in firing furnace characteristics. The changes in firing furnace characteristics which would commonly vary during day-to-day operations are the peak temperature and the volume of air flow. In addition, the time at peak temperature and the effects of palladium silver versus gold for use as a terminating conductor were also studied. A total of seven thermistor pastes ranging in value from 1000 ohms to 6000 ohms and from - 350 to - 2600 Beta were studied under the different conditions. The study attempted to control all other possible parameters, such as printed thickness variations, to reasonable, but not perfect, conditions. This permitted the study to take on the appearance of actual production conditions rather than looking like a laboratory experiment. Once samples had been printed under these conditions, sets were processed under the five different furnace variables to be studied. The fired parts were then measured for resistance and Beta was calculated. The results were summarized in tabular form and statistical comparisons were made. The study concluded that most of the pastes tested were relatively unaffected by the realistic changes that occur in furnace peak temperature and air flow on a daily basis. Changes in time at peak temperature, specifically changing from a 30 -minute profile to a 60 -minute profile did not significantly change the Beta but did cause a large increase in resistance which is undesirable. The comparison of palladium silver to gold for termination also showed no significant changes. The study showed that standard furnace parameters and the use of either conductor for termination were acceptable in daily operations without loss of control of the thermistor. M. S.
