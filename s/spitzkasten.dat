50|$|The smelter 1 {{site has}} a {{standing}} chimney with {{a height of}} approximately 18 metres. The smelter area is very overgrown with vegetation covering the collapsed remains of the smelter's brickwork. Little can be interpreted, though {{it does appear that}} this is the site of the reverberatory furnaces. Adjacent to the smelter and the chimney is a series of at least 6 pits. It is possible that there could be more pits but the area is covered by galvanised iron from the roof of the collapsed work's building. The six pits that are visible are in two rows of three, each of the pits is two metres in width, with their lengths increasing from 1 metre to 2 metres to 2.5metres. Adjacent to the pits are the remains of standing and collapsed posts and roof trusses of a 7 metres by 7.5 metres building. A three hopper feed bin that may be the remains of a <b>spitzkasten</b> classifer is located near the chimney. A small slagheap covers an area 29 metres by 20 metres. Approximately 66 metres to the southwest is a flat area accessed by a road that runs south towards the Lady Inez Mine and northwest towards Smelter 2 and the Blue Bag Mine. This flat area could be an ore sorting/storage floor.|$|E
