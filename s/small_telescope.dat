That is, the planet always appears nearly fully {{illuminated}} when viewed through Earth-based telescopes. It was only during spacecraft missions to Jupiter that crescent views of the planet were obtained. A <b>small</b> <b>telescope</b> will usually show Jupiter's four Galilean moons and the prominent cloud belts across Jupiter's atmosphere.

5|$|North of Sirius lie Theta and Mu Canis Majoris, Theta {{being the}} most northerly star with a Bayer {{designation}} in the constellation. Around 8 billion years old, it is an orange giant of spectral type K4III that is around as massive as the Sun but has expanded to 30 times the Sun's diameter. Mu is a multiple star system located around 1244 light-years distant, its components discernible in a <b>small</b> <b>telescope</b> as a 5.3-magnitude yellow-hued and 7.1-magnitude bluish star. The brighter star is a giant of spectral type K2III, while the companion is a main sequence star of spectral type B9.5V.

5|$|The Triangulum Galaxy, {{also known}} as Messier 33, was {{discovered}} by Giovanni Battista Hodierna in the 17th century. A distant member of the Local Group, it is about 2.3 million light-years away, and at magnitude 5.8 it is bright enough {{to be seen by}} the naked eye under the darkest skies. Under light-polluted skies, it is challenging or invisible even in a <b>small</b> <b>telescope</b> or binoculars. Because of its low surface brightness, low power is required. It is a spiral galaxy with a diameter of 46,000 light-years and is thus smaller than both the Andromeda Galaxy and the Milky Way. A distance of less than 300 kiloparsecs between it and Andromeda supports the hypothesis that it is a satellite of the larger galaxy. Within the constellation, it lies near the border of Pisces, 3.5 degrees west-northwest of Alpha Trianguli and 7 degrees southwest of Beta Andromedae. Within the galaxy, NGC 604 is an H II region where star formation takes place.|$|E

5|$|The galactic anticenter {{is located}} about 3.5° {{to the east}} of Beta Aurigae. This marks the point on the {{celestial}} sphere opposite the location of the Galactic Center; hence, this region marks a less extensive and less luminous part of the dust band that forms the spiral arms of the Milky Way. Auriga has many open clusters and other objects because the Milky Way runs through it. The three brightest open clusters are M36, M37 and M38, all of which are visible in binoculars or a <b>small</b> <b>telescope</b> in suburban skies. A larger telescope resolves individual stars. Three other open clusters are NGC 2281, lying close to ψ7 Aurigae, NGC 1664, which is close to ε Aurigae, and IC 410 (surrounding NGC 1893), a cluster with nebulosity next to IC 405, the Flaming Star Nebula, found about midway between M38 and ιAurigae.

500|$|Some of the {{earliest}} recorded observations ever made through a telescope, Galileo's drawings on 28 December 1612 and 27 January 1613, contain plotted points that match up with what is now known to be the position of Neptune. On both occasions, Galileo seems to have mistaken Neptune for a fixed star when it appeared close—in conjunction—to Jupiter in the night sky; hence, he is not credited with Neptune's discovery. At his first observation in December 1612, Neptune was almost stationary in the sky because it had just turned retrograde that day. This apparent backward motion is created when Earth's orbit takes it past an outer planet. Because Neptune was only beginning its yearly retrograde cycle, {{the motion of the}} planet was far too slight to be detected with Galileo's <b>small</b> <b>telescope.</b> In July 2009, University of Melbourne physicist David Jamieson announced new evidence suggesting that Galileo was at least aware that the [...] "star" [...] he had observed had moved relative to the fixed stars.|$|E
500|$|Saturn is {{the most}} distant of the five planets easily {{visible to the naked}} eye from Earth, the other four being Mercury, Venus, Mars and Jupiter. (Uranus and {{occasionally}} 4 Vesta are {{visible to the naked eye}} in dark skies.) Saturn appears to the naked eye in the night sky as a bright, yellowish point of light with an apparent magnitude of usually between +1 and 0. It takes approximately 29.5 years for the planet to complete an entire circuit of the ecliptic against the background constellations of the zodiac. Most people will require an optical aid (very large binoculars or a <b>small</b> <b>telescope)</b> that magnifies at least 30 times to achieve an image of Saturn's rings, in which clear resolution is present. [...] Twice every Saturnian year (roughly every 15 Earth years), the rings briefly disappear from view, due to the way in which they are angled and because they are so thin. Such a [...] "disappearance" [...] will next occur in 2025, but Saturn will be too close to the Sun for any ring-crossing observation to be possible.|$|E

2500|$|Galileo's {{drawings}} {{show that}} he observed Neptune on December 28, 1612, and again on January 27, 1613; on both occasions, Galileo mistook Neptune for a fixed star when it appeared very close (in conjunction) to Jupiter in the night sky. Historically {{it was thought that}} he believed it to be a fixed blue star, and so he is not credited with its discovery. At the time of his first observation in December 1612, it was stationary in the sky because it had just turned retrograde that very day; because it was only beginning its yearly retrograde cycle, Neptune's motion was thought to be too slight, and its apparent size too small, to clearly appear to be a planet in Galileo's <b>small</b> <b>telescope.</b> However, in July 2009 University of Melbourne physicist David Jamieson announced new evidence suggesting that Galileo was indeed aware that he had discovered something unusual about this [...] "star". Galileo, in one of his notebooks, noted the movement of a background star (Neptune) on January 28 and a dot (in Neptune's position) drawn in a different ink suggests that he found it on an earlier sketch, drawn on the night of January 6, suggesting a systematic search among his earlier observations. However, so far there is neither clear evidence that he identified this moving object as a planet, nor that he published these observations of it. There is no evidence that he ever attempted to observe it again.|$|E

By means of pivots and screws the telescope can be moved up or down, right or left, without in the smallest degree altering the flatness or position of its stand.

60|$|The sea moderating as the {{sun came}} up, though the sky was cloudy and wild, we spoke the other boat, to know what stores they had, and to {{overhaul}} what we had. I had a compass in my pocket, a <b>small</b> <b>telescope,</b> a double-barrelled pistol, a knife, and a fire-box and matches. Most of my men had knives, and some had a little tobacco: some, a pipe as well. We had a mug among us, and an iron spoon. As to provisions, there were in my boat two bags of biscuit, one piece of raw beef, one piece of raw pork, a bag of coffee, roasted but not ground (thrown in, I imagine, by mistake, for something else), two small casks of water, and about half-a- gallon of rum in a keg. The Surf-boat, having rather more rum than we, and fewer to drink it, gave us, as I estimated, another quart into our keg. In return, we gave them three double handfuls of coffee, tied up {{in a piece of}} a handkerchief; they reported that they had aboard besides, a bag of biscuit, a piece of beef, a small cask of water, a small box of lemons, and a Dutch cheese. It {{took a long time to}} make these exchanges, and they were not made without risk to both parties; the sea running quite high enough to make our approaching near to one another very hazardous. In the bundle with the coffee, I conveyed to John Steadiman (who had a ship's compass with him), a paper written in pencil, and torn from my pocket-book, containing the course I meant to steer, in the hope of making land, or being picked up by some vessel--I say in the hope, though I had little hope of either deliverance. I then sang out to him, so as all might hear, that if we two boats could live or die together, we would; but, that if we should be parted by the weather, and join company no more, they should have our prayers and blessings, and we asked for theirs. We then gave them three cheers, which they returned, and I saw the men's heads droop in both boats as they fell to their oars again.|$|E
60|$|Since the Invention (and {{perfecting}} in some measure) of Telescopes, it {{has been}} observ'd by several, that the Sun and Moon neer the Horizon, are disfigur'd (losing that exactly-smooth terminating circular limb, which they are observ'd to have when situated neerer the Zenith) and are bounded with an edge every way (especially upon {{the right and left}} sides) ragged and indented like a Saw: which inequality of their limbs, I have further observ'd, not to remain always the same, but to be continually chang'd by a kind of fluctuating motion, not unlike that of the waves of the Sea, so as that part of the limb, which was but even now nick'd or indented in, is now protuberant, and will presently be sinking again; neither is this all but the whole body of the Luminaries, do in the Telescope, seem to be depress'd and slatted, the upper, and more especially the under side appearing neerer to the middle then really they are, and the right and left appearing more remote: whence the whole Area seems to be terminated by a kind of Oval. It is further observ'd, that the body, for the most part, appears red, or of some colour approaching neer unto it, as some kind of yellow; and this I have always mark'd, that the more the limb is slatted or ovalled, the more red does the body appear, though not always the contrary. It is further observable, that both fix'd Stars and Planets, the neerer they appear to the Horizon, the more red and dull they look, and the more they are observ'd to twinkle; in so much, that I have seen the Dog-starr to vibrate so strong and bright a radiation of light, as almost to dazle my eyes, and presently, almost to disappear. It is also observable, that those bright scintillations neer the Horizon, are not by much so quick and sudden in their consecutions of one another, as the nimbler twinklings of Stars neerer the Zenith. This is also notable, that the Starrs neer the Horizon, are twinkled with several colours; so as sometimes to appear red, sometimes more yellow, and sometimes blue, and this when the Starr is a pretty way elevated above the Horizon. I have further, very often seen some of the small Starrs of the fifth or sixth magnitude, at certain times to disappear for a small moment of time, and again appear more conspicuous, and with a greater luster. I have several times, with my naked eye, seen many smaller Starrs, such as may be call'd of the seventh or eighth magnitude to appear for a short space, and then vanish, which, by directing a <b>small</b> <b>Telescope</b> towards that part they appear'd and disappear'd in; I could presently find to be indeed small Starrs so situate, as I had seen them with my naked eye, and to appear twinkling like the ordinary visible Stars; nay, in examining some very notable parts of the Heaven, with a three foot Tube, me thought I now and then, in several parts of the constellation, could perceive little twinklings of Starrs, making a very short kind of apparition, and presently vanishing, but noting diligently the places where they thus seem'd to play at boe-peep, I made use of a very good twelve foot Tube, and with that it was not uneasie to see those, and several other degrees of smaller Starrs, and some smaller yet, that seem'd again to appear and disappear, and these also by giving the same Object-glass a much bigger aperture, I could plainly and constantly see appear in their former places; so that I have observ'd some twelve several magnitudes of Starrs less then those of the six magnitudes commonly recounted in the Globes.|$|E
