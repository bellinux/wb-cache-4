In 1989 JBIC had {{approved}} two loans to support two Metropolitan Water Supply Projects to transfer bulk {{water from the}} Khanpur Dam and the Simly Dam {{for a total of}} 18.268 billion Yen. The Khanpur project, implemented between 1994 and 2000, aimed at increasing bulk water supply to Islamabad and Rawalpindi from the Khanpur Dam. An [...] ex-post evaluation of the project in 2002 judged that [...] "the effect of the project was not necessarily high". The amount of water supplied was only 41% of what had been planned, and there were [...] "various problems with the executing agency (the Capital Development Authority) such as the scarcity of personnel, underdeveloped institutions, and the shortage of active efforts." [...] A Japanese field survey in 2008 re-examined the situation and found that [...] "no noticeable improvements have been made". The total amount spent was US$109 million (12,442 million Yen).

The largest tank had a capacity of 6 million gallons of water. There were completely false rumors, that a treasure belonging to the Kachwaha rulers of Amber had been stacked in the fort precincts (including the water tanks), that led to a totally unsuccessful search. The search had been ordered during the Emergency declared by the Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi during 1975–1977. A futile search was also launched, in 1977, of all the buildings in the fort, by the Income Tax department, using metal detectors. There was also a Parliament Question on this issue where a question was posed whether a [...] "Search for treasure carried out from 10th June 1976 till November 1976 by the Income Tax Authorities at Jaigarh Fort on the Jaipur Delhi Road was closed to ordinary traffic for one or two days so as to make way for military trucks carrying treasures to the residence of the then Prime Minister, Smt. Indira Gandhi?". However, the search carried out for treasures by an Army unit at Jaigarh Fort, after a three-month search had found no treasures. It was then conjectured that Sawai Jai Singh probably used the treasure to build the city of Jaipur.|$|E
