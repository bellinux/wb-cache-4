25|$|For this reason, and the {{political}} fallout after the 1605 Gunpowder plot and the Plantation of Ulster in 1613-15, the constituencies for the Irish House of Commons were changed to give Protestants a <b>majority.</b> The Plantation <b>of</b> Ulster allowed English and Scottish Protestant candidates in as representatives of the newly formed boroughs in planted areas. Initially this gave Protestants a <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> 132-100 in the House of Commons. However, after vehement Catholic protests, including a brawl in the chamber on Parliament's first sitting, {{some of the new}} Parliamentary constituencies were eliminated, giving Protestants a <b>slight</b> <b>majority</b> (108-102) <b>of</b> members of the House of Commons thereafter.|$|R
25|$|In 1870 the Post Office resumed its {{tradition}} of printing postage stamps with the portraits of American Presidents and Franklin but now added several other famous Americans, including Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, Alexander Hamilton and General Winfield Scott among other notable Americans. Indeed, the balance had now shifted somewhat; {{of the ten}} stamps issued in 1870, only four offered presidential images. Moreover, presidents also appeared on {{less than half of}} the denominations in the definitive sets of 1890, 1917, 1954 and 1965, while occupying only a <b>slight</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> values in the definitive issues of 1894–98, 1902 and 1922–25.|$|E
25|$|While the planter {{class had}} persuaded poor whites {{to vote for}} this {{legislative}} effort to suppress black voting, the new restrictions resulted in their disenfranchisement as well, due mostly to {{the imposition of a}} cumulative poll tax. By 1941, whites constituted a <b>slight</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> those disenfranchised by these laws: 600,000 whites vs. 520,000 African-Americans. Nearly all African Americans had lost the ability to vote. Despite numerous legal challenges that succeeded in overturning certain provisions, the state legislature would create new ones to maintain disenfranchisement. The exclusion of blacks from the political system persisted until after passage of federal civil rights legislation in the 1965 to enforce their constitutional rights as citizens.|$|E
25|$|The Canadian {{public is}} divided in opinion on {{regards to the}} {{necessity}} of the mission. A survey in late October 2006 showed that a <b>slight</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> Canadians approved of the mission despite an increase of casualties from Canadian troops over the previous few months. However, the number of casualties increased rapidly in 2006 and 2007, the percentage of Canadians opposed increased significantly. The province with the strongest opposition was Quebec. A June 2007 Journal de Montréal poll conducted after the first Quebec casualties in the mission showed that nearly 70 percent of its population were opposed to the mission, while it was 53 percent in a March poll. The Quebec City area that includes CFB Valcartier, at which are based most of the Quebec troops assigned for the mission, had the strongest support for the mission, but were also in majority opposed.|$|E

25|$|The {{commission}} members {{surveyed the}} history of execution and sent out a fact-finding questionnaire to government officials, lawyers, and medical experts all around the state asking for their opinion. The questionnaires were a bit skewed because they pushed forward electrocution and {{did not include the}} choice of abolishing the death penalty, but, despite that, a <b>slight</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> respondents recommended hanging over electrocution, and a few recommended the abolition of capital punishment. The commission also contacted electrical experts, including Thomson-Houston Electric Company's Elihu Thomson (who recommended high voltage AC connected to the head and the spine) and the inventor Thomas Edison (who also recommended AC, as well as using a Westinghouse generator). They also attended electrocutions of dogs by George Fell who had worked with Southwick in the early 1880s experiments. Fell was conducting further experiments, electrocuting anesthetized dissected dogs trying to discern exactly how electricity killed a subject.|$|E
25|$|Historically, Silesia {{was about}} equally split between Protestants (overwhelmingly Lutherans) and Roman Catholics. In a 1890 census {{taken in the}} German part, Roman Catholics made up a <b>slight</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> 53%, while the {{remaining}} 47% were almost entirely Lutheran. Geographically speaking, Lower Silesia was mostly Lutheran except for the Glatzer Land (now Kłodzko County). Upper Silesia was mostly Roman Catholic except for some of its northwestern parts, which were predominantly Lutheran. Generally speaking, the population was mostly Protestant in the western parts, and it {{tended to be more}} Roman Catholic the further east one went. In Upper Silesia, Protestants were concentrated in larger cities and often identified as German. After World War II, the religious demographics changed drastically as Germans, who constituted the bulk of the Protestant population, fled or were forcibly expelled. Poles, who were mostly Roman Catholic, were resettled in their place. Today, Silesia remains predominantly Roman Catholic.|$|E

40|$|Previous systems {{analyses}} {{in plants}} {{have focused on}} a single developmental stage or time point, although it is often important to additionally consider time-index changes. During seed development a cascade of events occurs within a relatively brief time scale. We have collected protein and transcript expression data from five sequential stages of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) seed development encompassing the period of reserve polymer accumulation. Protein expression profiling employed two-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled with tandem mass spectrometry, while transcript profiling used oligonucleotide microarrays. Analyses in biological triplicate yielded robust expression information for 523 proteins and 22, 746 genes across the five developmental stages, and established 319 protein/transcript pairs for subsequent pattern analysis. General linear modeling {{was used to evaluate}} the protein/transcript expression patterns. Overall, application of this statistical assessment technique showed concurrence for a <b>slight</b> <b>majority</b> (56 %) <b>of</b> expression pairs.

Husbands’ perceptions of their own marital equity described a U-shaped curve across these phases, with significantly more men feeling equitably treated both initially and after children’s departure than during {{any of the three}} phases with children in the home. Wives’ perceptions, by contrast, showed little variation with life cycle phase. Overall, a <b>slight</b> <b>majority</b> (52 percent) <b>of</b> husbands and wives perceived their marriages as equitable.
