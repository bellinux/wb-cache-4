40|$|Celiac disease (CD) {{is a type}} of {{intestinal}} malabsorption syndrome, in which the patients are intolerant to the gliadin in dietary gluten, resulting in chronic diarrhea and <b>secondary</b> <b>malnutrition.</b> The disease is common in Europe and the United States, but only sporadic reports are found in East Asia including China. Is CD really rare in China? We examined 62 patients by capsule endoscopy for chronic diarrhea from June 2003 to March 2008. Four patients with chronic diarrhea and weight loss were diagnosed to have CD. Under the capsule endoscopy, we observed that the villi of the proximal small bowel became short, and that the mucous membrane became atrophied in these four patients. Duodenal biopsies were performed during gastroscopy and the pathological changes of mucosa were confirmed to be Marsh 3 stage of CD. A gluten free diet significantly improved the conditions of the four patients. We suspect that in China, especially in the northern area where wheat is the main food, CD might not be uncommon, and its under-diagnosis could be caused by its clinical manifestations that could be easily covered by the symptoms from other clinical situations, particularly when it came to subclinical patients without obvious symptom or to patients with extraintestinal symptoms as the initial manifestations...|$|E
40|$|Nutrition {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} factors affecting pubertal development. Puberty entails a progressive nonlinear process starting from prepubescent to full sexual maturity through the interaction and cooperation of biological, physical, and psychological changes. Consuming an adequate and balanced healthy diet during all phases of growth (infancy, childhood and puberty) appears necessary both for proper growth and normal pubertal development. Girls begin puberty at an earlier age compared to past decades. Excessive eating of many processed, high-fat foods, may be the cause of this phenomenon. Overweight or obese children are more likely to enter puberty early. Some evidence suggests that obesity can accelerate the onset of puberty in girls and may delay the onset of puberty in boys. Moreover, the progression of puberty is affected by nutrition. On the other hand, puberty triggers a growth spurt, which increases nutritional needs including macro and micronutrients. Increased caloric, protein, iron, calcium, zinc and folate needs have to be provided during this critical period of rapid growth. Severe primary or <b>secondary</b> <b>malnutrition</b> also can delay the onset and progression of puberty. The higher incidence of anorexia nervosa and bulimia in adolescents imposes a nutritional risk on pubertal development. Moreover, many environmental endocrine disruptors (EDs) have been identified that can significantly impair the normal course of puberty. This mini-review sums up some important findings in this important complex that link nutrition and pubertal development...|$|E

The non-inflammatory cardiomyopathies do not appear to cause late gadolinium enhancement or T 2 hypersignal; (2) inflammatory cardiomyopathy are secondary to viral myocarditis, abnormal immune responses in pregnancy, abnormal response to hemodynamic stress, increased myocyte apoptosis and cytokine-mediated inflammation.

40|$|Regardless {{of which}} {{parts of the}} world they live in, most {{children}} will develop and grow at a similar rate if proper nutrition is ensured. Children from develop-ing countries are at risk for primary malnutrition. Children undergoing anticancer therapy are at higher risk for <b>secondary</b> <b>malnutrition,</b> including obesity and growth retardation. Periodic nutritional assess-ments are important for planning effective dietary interventions for such children. In this review, we describe malnutrition as it occurs in children with cancer and various ways of assessing the nutritional status of these children, depending on the availability of resources in their local hospitals. Objective and subjective data should be used to complete the nutri-tional assessment. We discuss screening methods, including the use of subjective global assessment. Different parts of nutritional assessment include medical history; physical examination; biochemical and hematological data, such as visceral proteins, blood glucose levels, and lipid profiles, hemoglobin and hematocrit, and the lymphocyte count; anthropo-metric measurements; and food and nutrition history. We review medical tests and procedures to determine nutritional status, including nitrogen balance, delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity, prognostic nutritional index, creatinine height index, maldigestion and mal-absorption tests, indirect calorimetry, and dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA scan). Evaluation and interpretation of data and estimation of nutritional risk are discussed, including proper techniques and use of anthropometric measures, selection and use of growth charts, calculation of caloric and protein needs, and the percentage of calories ingested. These methods will enable local health care providers to accurately assess the nutritional status of children with cancer, identify children at risk, and plan adequate nutritional interventions.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionFractures {{are known}} {{sequelae}} of seizures. We present a young male with bilateral acetabula and surgical neck of humerus (SNOH), right neck of femur (NOF) and thoracolumbar fractures {{in the context}} of a hypocalcaemic seizure <b>secondary</b> to severe <b>malnutrition,</b> <b>secondary</b> hyperparathyroidism and vitamin D deficiency. The authors believe that numerous severe injuries in a single patient secondary to seizure are extremely rare and have not been seen in the literature. Case reportA 25 -year-old male presented to A&E following a collapse. He described limited movement and pain in all four limbs and collateral history described a generalised tonic–clonic seizure. XR and CT identified pelvic, femoral and humeral fractures, as well as compression fractures of T 11, T 12 and L 1 vertebrae. His pelvic, femoral and SNOH fractures all required ORIF with intra-operative biopsy revealing abnormal bone quality. His spinal fractures did not require management. His young age and severe injuries prompted endocrinology and neurological evaluation. These revealed severe <b>malnutrition</b> <b>secondary</b> to behavioural and dietary factors with severe hypocalcaemia, secondary hyperparathyroidism and vitamin D deficiency. His metabolic and nutritional deficits were replaced intravenously and orally and his seizure attributed to hypocalcaemia. Discussion and conclusionClinical suspicion for fractures should be high as the rate of fracture following seizure is approximately 6 % [1]. Close evaluation and tertiary survey should be completed as missed musculoskeletal injury has been reported to be over 10 % [2] and pre-existing medical and social risk factors may increase the incidence of these injuries [3 – 4]. Given the young man's presentation, a high clinical suspicion was held for an underlying syndrome such as osteomalacia. Secondary to early aggressive treatment, a biopsy performed was non-diagnostic and features of osteomalacia were not present. Due to the potential consequences of a seizure, the authors recommend individuals who present with seizure or collapse be thoroughly examined and investigated to ensure no co-existing injury or pathology...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Thymulin (or FTS-Zn) a {{well-defined}} thymic hormone was studied in fifteen female patients hospitalized for anorexia nervosa. The circulating hormone was measured {{together with the}} plasma levels of thyroid hormones, cortisol and zinc. Thymulin activity determined by the rosette assay was significantly reduced in the anorexia nervosa patients compared to sex- and age-matched healthy control subjects. The patients were characterized by very depressed plasma levels of tniodothyronine (T 3) but exhibited normal concentrations of thyroxine (T 4), thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), cortisol and zinc. The distribution of their peripheral lymphocyte cells into several subsets was not affected. The observed decrease of thymulin activity in this illness might be the consequence of thymic atrophy <b>secondary</b> to <b>malnutrition</b> and/or hormonal disturbances. Our results suggested that the fall in thymulin level might explain the variability of cellular immune responses in anorexia nervosa patients and occurrence of anergy when their weight loss is far advanced.

However, it has been not established whether the dysregulation of CAR was a primary phenomenon or a change <b>secondary</b> to <b>malnutrition.</b> Therefore, we aimed to explore the salivary CAR in both underweight and weigh-restored women with AN. Fifty-nine women volunteered for the study. They were 18 underweight AN women, 15 weight-restored AN women and 26 normal-weight healthy women. Saliva samples were collected in the morning, immediately on awakening and after 15, 30 and 60 min to measure saliva levels of cortisol. Participants' anxiety levels in the morning of sampling were measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. As compared to control women, underweight AN patients showed an enhanced CAR whereas weight-restored patients had a normal CAR. These results could be not explained by group differences in body mass index or levels of anxiety. These findings show, for the first time, that the enhanced CAR occurring in the acute phase of AN is not seen in weight-recovered patients, suggesting that the dysregulated activity of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis of symptomatic AN patients is a state-dependent phenomenon...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. Factors {{that have}} been {{reported}} to affect erythropoietin (EPO) responsiveness in hemodialysis (HD) patients include iron deficiency, chronic inflammation, <b>secondary</b> hyperparathyroidism, <b>malnutrition</b> and inadequate HD dose. The aim {{of the study was to}} analyze the deteminants of hemoglobin variability in HD patients. Methods. The study encompassed 526 patients (197 F and 329 M). According to HD vintage at the beginning of the study the patients were divided into two groups: group- 1 encompassed 153 patients with HD vintage bellow 24 months, and group- 2 encompassed 329 patients with HD vintage over 24 months. Over a period of 21 months after admission the following parameters were analyzed: hemoglobin (Hb), EPO dose, iron dose, HD dose (eKT/V), transferrin saturation (TSAT), C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin and serum albumin at 3 months and parathyroid hormone (PTH) at 6 months. Results. The percentage of patients with Hb>= 105 g/L significantly improved, and the average Hb level significantly increased in both groups over a period of 21 months. The average EPO and iron dose significantly decreased, but TSAT and ferritin levels significantly increased over a period of 21 months. The average eKT/V and s-albumin values significantly increased, but the average CRP and PTH levels significantly decresead over a period of 21 months. In group- 1 EPO dose and CRP, but in group- 2 EPO dose, ferritin, HD vintage, and iron dose were statistically significant predictors of the Hb level 9 months after admission. Conclusions. Insufficient EPO therapy, iron deficiency and chronic inflammation were the main factors of inadequate correction of anemia in HD patients before admission...|$|R
40|$|Leptin is a {{pleiotropic}} molecule {{involved in}} energy homeostasis, hematopoiesis, inflammation, and immunity. Hypoleptinemia characterizing starvation has been strictly related to increased susceptibility to infection <b>secondary</b> to <b>malnutrition.</b> Nevertheless, ESRD {{is characterized by}} high susceptibility to bacterial infection despite hyperleptinemia. Defects in neutrophils {{play a crucial role}} in the infectious morbidity, and several uremic toxins that are capable of depressing neutrophil functions have been identified. Only a few and contrasting reports about leptin and neutrophils are available. This study provides evidence that leptin inhibits neutrophil migration in response to classical chemoattractants. Moreover, serum from patients with ESRD inhibits migration of normal neutrophils in response to N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine with a strict correlation between serum leptin levels and serum ability to suppress neutrophil locomotion. Finally, the serum inhibitory activity can be effectively prevented by immune depletion of leptin. The results also show, however, that leptin by itself is endowed with chemotactic activity toward neutrophils. The two activities-inhibition of the cell response to chemokines and stimulation of neutrophil migration-could be detected at similar concentrations. On the contrary, neutrophils exposed to leptin did not display detectable [Ca 2 +](i) mobilization, oxidant production, or beta(2) -integrin upregulation. The results demonstrate that leptin is a pure chemoattractant devoid of secretagogue properties that are capable of inhibiting neutrophil chemotaxis to classical neutrophilic chemoattractants. Taking into account the crucial role of neutrophils in host defense, the leptin-mediated ability of ERSD serum to inhibit neutrophil chemotaxis appears as a potential mechanism that contributes to the establishment of infections in ERSD...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{identify}} the characteristics of malnourished adults at risk of imminent death during complex humanitarian emergencies (i. e. in need of intensive medical and nutritional treatment). I studied the anthropometric and clinical presentation of 2409 out-patients from Supplementary Feeding Centres (SFC) and 2500 in-patients from Therapeutic Feeding Centres (TFC) in Burundi and Congo. SFC patients were admitted with BMI below 17 kg/m 2 and only received weekly food distribution.   Those in TFC were admitted with BMI below 16 kg/m 2 and received intensive medical and nutritional treatment. Overall, 9. 7 % of patients observed in SFC did not recover.   Among those in SFC with BMI below 16 kg/m 2, 570 (76. 7 %) recovered, including some with BMI below 13 kg/m 2.   BMI on admission is associated with outcome of treatment, but its ability to predict outcome is insufficient (positive predictive value 23. 3 %).   MUAC is associated with outcome as well, but has a lower predictive ability than BMI.   Symptoms of weakness (e. g. muscle hypotony), associated infection (e. g. fever and cough {{of more than one}} month) and malnutrition (typical skin lesions, sunken eyes), identified patients with a negative outcome of treatment.   Logistic regression modelling showed the need to consider separately three groups of patients i) patients with <b>malnutrition</b> <b>secondary</b> to disease (suspicion of tuberculosis) ii) patients with stable weight, and iii) patients with active weight loss.   Only the latter are equated to “Acute Malnutrition”.   Among them, BMI and muscular hypotony identified patients in need of intensive treatment (“Sever Acute Malnutrition”).   Low BMI or MUAC with stable weight are not absolute markers of risk of death in the short term.   Patients with stable weight are equated to “Chronic Malnutrition”. In TFC, BMI and MUAC are good prognostic indicators, with the second identifying better patients with associated infectious disease.   The clinical characteristics and the survival experience of patients in Congo approaches that expected in a population of patients with Acute Malnutrition, but not in Burundi.   This suggests the presence in Burundi TFCs of important number of patients with Chronic Malnutrition or Moderate Acute Malnutrition, rather than Severe Acute Magnetron, and confirms findings in SFC.   More than half of the deaths in TFC happened in patients with associated disease or <b>malnutrition</b> <b>secondary</b> to chronic disease, during the Rehabilitation phase of treatment.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{addressed}} the question of starvation effects on immune function by means of changes in lymphocyte subsets, cytokine induction or lymphocyte activation. Anorexia nervosa (AN) patients are severely malnourished and contradictory results have been obtained regarding the accompanying immunodeficiency, including its assignation {{as a part of}} the primary nervous disorder. In the present work, an extensive immunological function examination was carried out on 40 AN patients who were compared with a control group of 14 healthy girls. The AN patients were also classified according to their nutritional status (by the Body Mass Index: BMI), this being critical for a better understanding of these secondary immunodeficiency bases. Moreover, another immune system study was performed on five patients after refeeding. Lymphocyte subsets and function, cytokine induction and peripheral blood concentrations, and innate as well as humoral immunity were evaluated. Deregulation in the cytokine network, owing to the interaction of the central nervous (CNS) and immune systems, seems to be the initial immune alteration in AN immunodeficiency but it has not been disproved that the immunodeficiency is a direct consequence of the original psychiatric perturbation. Spontaneous high levels of circulating interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 beta) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) have been observed; this is probably one of the causes of the anomalies found in the T-cell subpopulations (mainly the naive CD 4 +CD 45 RA+ reduction and the cytotoxic CD 8 + increase) and T-cell activation status (mainly the down-regulation of the CD 2 and CD 69 activation pathways). This finally leads to an impairment, not only in T-cell function but also in T-cell to B-cell co-operation. The AN specificity of these results is confirmed by the fact that these immune alterations improve after refeeding and when nutritional status becomes less critical, which also suggests that AN immunodeficiency is indeed <b>secondary</b> to <b>malnutrition...</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{pandemic}} {{increase in}} obesity prevalence {{leads to a}} large {{increase in the number}} of obese patients admitted in the intensive care unit. The “obesity paradox” defines the protective effect of overweight and obesity (until 40 of body mass index) on intensive care unit mortality. In critically ill patients, obesity-related mortality is likely to be underestimated because of the use of non-suitable prognostic scores. During critical illness, the adipose tissue of obese patients stores lipids instead of utilizing them as energy source. It leads to the worsening of the muscle protein catabolism. The metabolic response to critical illness in obese patients may involve qualitative changes of the adipose tissue. Hyperglycemia is frequent and associated with patients’ poor prognosis making mandatory the glycemic control. Overnutrition must be avoided as it is deleterious. The main objective of nutritional support is to limit the <b>malnutrition</b> <b>secondary</b> to critical illness. In the critically ill obese patients, no method is validated for assessing nutritional status and protein–energy needs.

40|$|ABSTRACT Eleven infants {{recovering}} from protein-calorie <b>malnutrition</b> <b>secondary</b> to ac-quired monosaccharide intolerance {{were found to}} have reduced plasma bicarbonate concentra-tion associated with inadequate weight gain. Renal net acid excretion (NAE) was decreased to a mean of 34. 2 jLEq/ 1. 73 m 2 /min. Titratable acidity (TA) was markedly reduced, accounting for only 16 % of NAE. This marked reduction in TA was associated with reduced mean phosphate (P 04) excretion (. 074 mg/mm) and a reduced mean serum P 04 (3. 9 mg/dl), suggesting P 04 depletion. Two patients received intravenous phosphate loads, resulting in an increase in mean NAE from 35. 1 to 89. 7 j. Eq/ 1. 73 m 2 /min. A similar response was seen after oral PG 4 supple-mentation. Three patients were studied after partial correction of their acidosis. At a relatively low plasma bicarbonate concentration (mean = 16. 6 mmoles/liter) significant amounts of bicarbonate were detected in the urine (mean = 8. 7 Eq/l. 73 m 2 /min), suggesting a defect in bicarbonate reabsorption. Five patients studied after complete recovery from malnutrition had normal NAE in response to ammonium chloride load. The reduction in NAE appears to be secondary to unavailability of urinary buffers and a reduction in bicarbonate reabsorption; both of these defects can be explained by phosphate depletion. Am. I.

Foods that {{were not in the}} food composition tables were analyzed chemically in the laboratory to know their nutrient contents. Values from the chemical analysis were used for the calculation of food nutrients. The mean intakes in all the nutrients tested for adolescent female university students were significantly higher (p< 0. 05) than those of adolescent female secondary school girls. Both adolescent female secondary school and university students, however, had nutrient intakes higher than FAO requirements except for iron intake where the secondary school girls did not meet the requirement for iron (36 - 42 g/day). Snacks contribution to the daily nutrient intakes of the adolescent female secondary school students were significantly higher (p< 0. 05) than those of the university students except for the carbohydrate intake (146. 66 g vs 170. 26 g) respectively.

Our objective was to determine the prevalence of SIBO in Bangladeshi children and its association with <b>malnutrition.</b> <b>Secondary</b> objectives included determination of SIBO’s association with sanitation, diarrheal disease, and environmental enteropathy. We performed a cross-sectional analysis of 90 Bangladeshi 2 -year-olds monitored since birth from an impoverished neighborhood. SIBO was diagnosed via glucose hydrogen breath testing, with a cutoff of a 12 -ppm increase over baseline used for SIBO positivity. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to investigate SIBO predictors. Differences in concomitant inflammation and permeability between SIBO-positive and -negative children were compared with multiple comparison adjustment. A total of 16. 7 % (15 / 90) of the children had SIBO. The strongest predictors of SIBO were decreased length-for-age Z score since birth (odds ratio [OR], 0. 13; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 03 to 0. 60) and an open sewer outside the home (OR, 4. 78; 95 % CI, 1. 06 to 21. 62). Recent or frequent diarrheal disease did not predict SIBO. The markers of intestinal inflammation fecal Reg 1 β (116. 8 versus 65. 6  µg/ml; P = 0. 02) and fecal calprotectin (1, 834. 6 versus 766. 7  µg/g; P = 0. 004) were elevated in SIBO-positive children. Measures of intestinal permeability and systemic inflammation did not differ between the groups. These findings suggest linear growth faltering and poor sanitation are associated with SIBO independently of recent or frequent diarrheal disease. SIBO is associated with intestinal inflammation but not increased permeability or systemic inflammation...|$|R

The management of nonstaggered (acute) paracetamol overdose {{is based on}} the plasma paracetamol concentration plotted on a treatment nomogram. In the UK there are two treatment lines on this nomogram, with the lower treatment line used for individuals felt to be at &lsquo;high risk&rsquo; of paracetamol-related hepatotoxicity either as a result of induction of cytochrome P 450 isoenzymes or reduction of intrahepatic glutathione. In this article we review the risk factors that, in current guidelines, are felt to increase risk due to a reduction in intrahepatic glutathione concentrations. Based on our review of the published literature, we feel that cystic fibrosis, acute viral illness, malnutrition, and eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa are likely to be associated with reduction in intrahepatic glutathione concentrations, and that this risk is likely to be related to <b>malnutrition</b> <b>secondary</b> to the disease. Chronic hepatitis C infection is also associated with reduced glutathione concentrations, although this appears to be independent of any associated malnutrition. Ageing and acute fasting are not associated with an increased risk of paracetamol-related hepatotoxicity due to reductions in glutathione concentrations. Finally, the evidence for HIV infection is inconclusive, particularly as the majority of studies were conducted in the pre-anti-viral treatment (HAART) era; however it is likely that patients with symptomatic HIV/AIDS have reduced glutathione concentrations due to associated malnutrition. Although there have been few studies which have specifically investigated whether there is an association between reduced intrahepatic glutathione concentrations and increased risk of paracetamol-related hepatotoxicity, in our opinion, {{it is likely that the}} above conditions that are associated with reduced glutathione concentrations, will be associated with an increased risk of paracetamol-related hepatotoxicity.

A limitaÃ§Ã£o funcional respiratÃ³ria estÃ¡ potencial-mente associada Ã s complicaÃ§Ãµes da tÃ©cnica. UsÃ¡mos a tÃ©cnica descrita por Gauderer, na sala de endoscopia: {{analgesia}} e sedaÃ§Ã£o locais. A PEG foi colocada em 26 doentes, 10 Â H/ 16 Â M; todos tinham disfagia bulbar. Os resultados sÃ£o apresentados em nÃºmero, mÃ©dia, desvio-padrÃ£o: idade â 26; 64, 3 Â± 11, 5; CVF% â 17; 64, 5 Â± 35, 6; PaCO 2 â 26; 41, 6 Â± 7, 1; PaO 2 â 26; 81, 6 Â± 14, 3. Em quatro, dos 17 doentes que realizaram espirometria, a CVF% era inferior a 50 %. Nove doentes tinham insuficiÃªncia respiratÃ³ria crÃ³nica. Apenas em duas doentes surgiram complicaÃ§Ãµes (laringoespasmo transitÃ³rio) nÃ£o relacionÃ¡veis com a funÃ§Ã£o pulmonar, mas provavelmente dependentes do envolvimento bulbar. ConclusÃ£o: na nossa experiÃªncia, a PEG revelouse segura, mesmo em doentes com doenÃ§a avanÃ§ada e capacidade funcional respiratÃ³ria limitada. Abstract: In ALS PEG tube placement attenuates <b>malnutrition,</b> <b>secondary</b> to bulbar dysphagia, {{and prevents}} other frequently fatal complications such as chocking and respiratory arrest. Respiratory insufficiency {{may be associated}} to the complications observed in this procedure. PEG tubes were placed in 26 patients (10 Â M/ 16 Â F) with dysphagia using the Gauderer technique, mild sedatives and local anaesthetics. Results are presented in absolute numbers; average; standard deviation: Age â 26, 64, 3 Â± 11, 5; CVF% â 17, 64, 5 Â± 35, 6; PaCO 2 â 26, 41, 6 Â± 7, 1; PaO 2 â 26, 81, 6 Â± 14, 3. Four of the seventeen patients with spirometric evaluation had FVC inferior to 50 %. Nine patients had chronic respiratory failure (CRF). Complications were identified in 2 patients (transient laryngeal spasm) and most likely secondary to bulbar involvement rather than pulmonary function. Conclusion: Our experience shows PEG to be a safe procedure even in patients with advanced disease and reduced pulmonary capacity.

40|$|Artículo científico [...] Universidad de Costa Rica. Instituto de Investigaciones en Salud, 1986 This {{discussion}} {{will review}} current knowledge on malnutrition infection interactions, {{to provide a}} basis for justifiable interventions to curtail infectious diseases. Interventions should be implemented within the frame of primary health care (PHC). By doing so, malnutrition and mortality are expected to be reduced. The paradigm proposes that infectious diseases, including those caused by parasites, are in fact primary or <b>secondary</b> causes of <b>malnutrition</b> [1, 2]. Malnutrition-infection interactions begin when weaning foods are given to breast-fed infants. While such foods may be nutritionally adequate, they are often contaminated with agents that cause diarrhea. Malnutrition, in turn, may be accompanied by alterations in immune response and its amplification [3, 4]. Thus, the negative effects of infection are enhanced, augmenting the risk of severe energy-protein malnutrition (EPM) and death. Good evidence that this paradigm is correct stems from the rapid change of health profiles of several traditional and transitional countries, after emphasizing control and prevention of infectious disease. Just 20 years ago, the role of infection in the causality of malnutrition was mostly ignored by nutrition workers, despite the impressive body of information and the pioneer work of some enlightened authors [3]. However, the relevance of infection had been obvious to those directly involved in village work; the original descriptions of kwashiorkor by Dr. Cicely Williams clearly showed the prominence of episodes of acute infections in children with the syndrome. The emphasis on food, with neglect for infection, stemmed from demonstration that kwashiorkor and marasmus get cured by a diet rich in protein and calories. Such clinical experience influenced scientific thought for more than three decades, with neglect of the other ecologic determinants of mal- nutrition. The "food paradigm" led to the belief that protein was the main limiting factor in diets of poor populations. Later, some authors convincingly demonstrated that the main deficit throughout the world was of calories more than protein [6]. Simultaneously, great skepticism arose regarding the alleged deficiency of local village diets [1, 6]. Failure to recognize the leading role of infection in the causality of malnutrition resulted in the equivocal assumption that diarrheal diseases in children were due to nutritional causes, hence the old term "nutritional diarrheas" [7]. Technological advances in the last 15 years enabled scientists to demonstrate viral and microbial entities in about 70 % of diarrhea cases seen in pediatric emergency and outpatient services. It is now accepted that childhood diarrheas originate after ingestion of infectious agents present in food and water, or from direct or indirect contact with contaminated fingers, utensils or fomites [7]. Pediatricians had recognized the importance of diarrheal diseases and other infectious processes in the causality of malnutrition, thanks to their long-term as- sociation with the same children through their development. In reviewing the scientific basis of malnutrition-infection interactions, all infectious diseases deserve consideration because the human host reacts in similar fashion to them, whether they are systemic or localized, whether they affect the skin, blood or other tissues, or whether they are due to viruses, rickettsiae, chlamydia, mycoplasma, bacteria, yeasts, fungi or parasites. However, some emphasis will be given to diarrheal diseases because they are extremely common in less developed countries, and because they have a distinct negative effect on host nutrition and growth [8].
