40|$|Figure 1 : Example {{session in}} which a user {{segmented}} a model with intelligent <b>scissoring.</b> Strokes are shown in transparent black. Different colored surfaces indicate separate parts computed by the intelligent <b>scissoring</b> algorithm. Note how the cuts between parts are smooth and well-placed, even though the user drew wide, inaccurate strokes. This sequence took under a minute with the system {{presented in this paper}} and the viewpoint never changed. The image on the far right shows the cuts as seen from on the backside of the mesh. Many algorithms and tools exist for the segmentation of 3 D meshes. However, they are labor intensive and lack the simplicity of 2 D image segmentation systems, limiting them to a small set of expert users. This paper introduces a new segmentation tool which aims for accurate and flexible interactive mesh segmentation, yet maintains an easy-to-use interface suitable for novices and experienced users alike. Extending the stroke based interface of 2 D intelligent <b>scissoring,</b> 3 D intelligent <b>scissoring</b> tackles the difficulties that arise from three dimensionality {{while at the same time}} gives the user more freedom than in previous systems. Intelligent <b>scissoring</b> obtains desirable segmentations easily and interactively, and presents many possibilities for future work within the field...|$|R

5|$|In {{languages}} {{other than}} English, its name also reflects the action it resembles. Sports journalist Alejandro Cisternas, from Chilean newspaper El Mercurio, {{compiled a list}} of these names. In most cases, they either refer to the kick's scissor-like motion, such as the French ciseaux retourné (returned <b>scissor)</b> and the Greek psalidaki, or to its bicycle-like action, such as the Portuguese pontapé de bicicleta. In other languages, the nature of the action is described: German Fallrückzieher (falling backward kick), Polish przewrotka (overturn kick), Dutch omhaal (turnaround drag), and Italian rovesciata (reversed kick).|$|E

5000|$|Some {{lesbian and}} {{bisexual}} {{women do not}} engage in the <b>scissoring</b> position, because they find it physically uncomfortable, {{feel that it is}} not representative of lesbian sexual practices and is more attributable to the male fantasies of the heterosexual porn industry, or because they otherwise have not included it as part of their sex lives. The Raw Story states, [...] "Whether <b>scissoring</b> position describes a traditional or even common lesbian act remains up for debate." [...] Some sources, however, such as Shere Hite's 1976 and 1981 research, show that women may enjoy performing the <b>scissoring</b> position with other women because it is a variation of vulva-to-vulva contact or can allow for maximum vulva-to-vulva contact and therefore an elevated level of intimacy.|$|R
5|$|To create Edward's <b>scissor</b> hands, Burton {{employed}} Stan Winston, {{who would}} later design the Penguin's prosthetic makeup in Batman Returns.

5|$|A bicycle kick, {{also known}} as an {{overhead}} kick or scissors kick, is a physical move in association football. It is achieved by throwing the body backward up into the air, making a shearing movement with the lower limbs to get one leg {{in front of the}} other in order to strike an airborne ball rearwards above head level, without resting on the ground. In most languages, the manoeuvre is named after either the cycling motion or the <b>scissor</b> motion that it resembles. Its complexity, and uncommon performance in competitive football matches, makes it one of association football's most celebrated skills.|$|E

One of the foremost architects of his time, Wynford worked for the king at Windsor, Winchester Cathedral and New College, Oxford. At Wells, he designed the western towers of which north-west was not built until the following century. In the 14th century, the central piers of the crossing were found to be sinking {{under the weight of the}} crossing tower which had been damaged by an earthquake in the previous century. Strainer arches, sometimes described as <b>scissor</b> arches, were inserted by master mason William Joy to brace and stabilise the piers as a unit.|$|E
