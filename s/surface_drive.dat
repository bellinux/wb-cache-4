40|$|International audienceRecent {{developments}} in optical microscopy and nanometer tracking have facilitated {{our understanding of}} microtubules and their associated proteins. Using fluorescence microscopy, dynamic interactions are now routinely observed in vitro {{on the level of}} single molecules, mainly using a geometry in which labeled motors move on surface-immobilized microtubules. Yet, we think that the historically older gliding geometry, in which motor proteins bound to a substrate <b>surface</b> <b>drive</b> the motion microtubules, offers some unique advantages. (1) Motility can be precisely followed by coupling multiple fluorophores and/or single bright labels to the surface of microtubules without disturbing the activity of the motor proteins. (2) The number of motor proteins involved in active transport can be determined by several strategies. (3) Multimotor studies can be performed over a wide range of motor densities. These advantages allow for studying cooperativity of processive as well as non-processive motors. Moreover, the gliding geometry has proven to be most promising for nanotechnological applications of motor proteins operating in synthetic environments. In this chapter we review recent methods related to gliding motility assays in conjunction with 3 D-nanometry. In particular, we aim to provide practical advice on how to set up gliding assays, how to acquire high-precision data from microtubules and attached quantum dots, and how to analyze data by 3 D-nanometer tracking...|$|E

40|$|Urea-induced protein {{denaturation}} {{is widely used}} to study protein folding and stability; however, the molecular mechanism and driving forces of this process are not yet fully understood. In particular, {{it is unclear whether}} either hydrophobic or polar interactions between urea molecules and residues at the protein <b>surface</b> <b>drive</b> denaturation. To address this question, here, many molecular dynamics simulations totalling ca. 7 µs of the CI 2 protein in aqueous solution served to perform a computational thought experiment, in which we varied the polarity of urea. For apolar driving forces, hypopolar urea should show increased denaturation power; for polar driving forces, hyperpolar urea should be the stronger denaturant. Indeed, protein unfolding was observed in all simulations with decreased urea polarity. Hyperpolar urea, in contrast, turned out to stabilize the native state. Moreover, the differential interaction preferences between urea and the 20 amino acids turned out to be enhanced for hypopolar urea and suppressed (or even inverted) for hyperpolar urea. These results strongly suggest that apolar urea–protein interactions, and not polar interactions, are the dominant driving force for denaturation. Further, the observed interactions provide a detailed picture of the underlying molecular driving forces. Our simulations finally allowed characterization of CI 2 unfolding pathways. Unfolding proceeds sequentially with alternating loss of secondary or tertiary structure. After the transition state, unfolding pathways show large structural heterogeneity...|$|E
40|$|The Micro Walker project,which is {{reported}} in this thesis, focuses {{on the development of}} linear micro-motors with a large dynamic range (reach : resolution). The key question for this project is if it is possible to implement walking motion in MEMS, and what can be the performance of linear micromotors employing walking motion. From their potential application in data storage guiding specifications are derived: An output acceleration of a mg load larger than 100 m / s 2, 10 nm resolution, reach larger than 10 mm, a driving voltage below 30 V and a maximum linear size smaller than 1 mm. The linear micromotors to made in the project, are based on variable capacitance electrostatic actuation and surface micromachining fabrication technology. Electrostatic motors have already been made in the 18 th century. The first known variable capacitance motor has been built by Zipernowski in 1889. Different propulsion principles for linear micromotors have been found in literature: Inertial drive, elastic inertial drive, impact drive, traveling field <b>surface</b> <b>drive,</b> scratch drive, zigzag drive, transformation of rotary into linearly motion, and walking motion.
