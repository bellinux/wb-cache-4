40|$|New {{fields of}} knowledge, {{information}} technology and an emphasis on economic rationalism {{over the past decade}} have led to major changes in curriculum, content and delivery in the Landscape <b>Architecture</b> <b>Programme</b> at the University of Canberra. In the mid- 1970 s, the predominant mode of delivery in the Landscape <b>Architecture</b> <b>Programme</b> was through the design studio. In the late 1980 s only 70 per cent of the four-year programme was delivered through the design studio and within five years it had dropped to less than 50 per cent. In parallel, it was found that students were constrained in their ability to integrate critical and practical skills with complex problem-solving exercises. To address these issues, and constrained by a diminishing budget, the Landscape <b>Architecture</b> <b>Programme</b> has moved to reinstate the primacy of the design studio for professional education. This paper traces changes to the Landscape <b>Architecture</b> <b>Programme</b> {{and the role of the}} design studio and suggests future possibilities as well as potential weaknesses...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In 1994 Unitec Institute of Technology welcomed {{its first}} cohort of {{enthusiastic}} {{students into the}} new Bachelor of <b>Architecture</b> <b>programme</b> within the School of Architecture and Construction. This new <b>programme,</b> a second <b>architecture</b> <b>programme</b> in Auckland city, was reportedly initiated by professional dissatisfaction {{with the lack of}} work preparedness of the graduates from the existing <b>architecture</b> <b>programmes</b> in the country. Little has been written, to date, about the origins of this new <b>programme.</b> <b>Architecture</b> <b>programmes</b> globally are evolving to meet contemporary needs and the discourse surrounding the beginnings of this programme may shed light on current trajectories. Situating the programme within a School of Architecture and Construction was part of a strategy to produce an architectural graduate who was more practice focused. But how was this intention manifest in the programme organisation and what were the distinctive features of this new programme that were designed to meet this objective? This paper will examine the originating documents and the context in which this programme was developed. It argues that, while the proposed curriculum and course structure contain elements that meet this professional, practice focused need, there are other elements embedded within the course that have a more expansive vision...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been an {{increase}} in the number of applicants seeking admission into <b>architecture</b> <b>programmes.</b> As expected, prior academic performance (also referred to as pre-enrolment requirement) is a major factor considered during the process of selecting applicants. In the present study, machine learning models were used to predict academic success of architecture students based on information provided in prior academic performance. Two modeling techniques, namely K-nearest neighbour (k-NN) and linear discriminant analysis were applied in the study. It was found that K-nearest neighbour (k-NN) outperforms the linear discriminant analysis model in terms of accuracy. In addition, grades obtained in mathematics (at ordinary level examinations) had a significant impact on the academic success of undergraduate architecture students. This paper makes a modest contribution to the ongoing discussion on the relationship between prior academic performance and academic success of undergraduate students by evaluating this proposition. One of the issues that emerges from these findings is that prior academic performance can be used as a predictor of academic success in undergraduate <b>architecture</b> <b>programmes.</b> Overall, the developed k-NN model can serve as a valuable tool during the process of selecting new intakes into undergraduate <b>architecture</b> <b>programmes</b> in Nigeria...|$|R
