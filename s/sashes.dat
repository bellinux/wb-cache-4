40|$|Objective. SAM and SH 3 domain {{containing}} 1 (<b>SASH</b> 1) is {{a recently}} discovered tumor suppressor gene. The role of <b>SASH</b> 1 in glioma {{has not yet}} been described. We investigated <b>SASH</b> 1 expression in glioma cases to determine its clinical significance on glioma pathogenesis and prognosis. Methods. We produced tissue microarrays using 121 patient-derived glioma samples and 30 patient-derived nontumor cerebral samples. Immunohistochemistry and Western blotting were used to evaluate <b>SASH</b> 1 expression. We used Fisher’s exact tests to determine relationships between <b>SASH</b> 1 expression and clinicopathological characteristics; Cox regression analysis to evaluate the independency of different <b>SASH</b> 1 expression; Kaplan-Meier analysis to determine any correlation of <b>SASH</b> 1 expression with survival rate. Results. <b>SASH</b> 1 expression was closely correlated with the WHO glioma grade. Of the 121 cases, 66. 9 % with low <b>SASH</b> 1 expression were mostly grade III-IV cases, whereas 33. 1 % with high <b>SASH</b> 1 expression were mostly grades I-II. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between <b>SASH</b> 1 expression and postoperative survival. Conclusions. <b>SASH</b> 1 was widely expressed in normal and low-grade glioma tissues. <b>SASH</b> 1 expression strongly correlated with glioma grades, showing higher expression at a lower grade, which decreased significantly as grade increased. Furthermore, <b>SASH</b> 1 expression was positively correlated with better postoperative survival in patients with glioma...|$|R

5|$|Building {{materials}} vary greatly. Brick {{was rarely}} {{used at the}} time Round Hill was developing (although a few houses in Belton Road were built of it); bungaroosh was often used for walls instead. Characteristic of Brighton but almost unknown elsewhere, this consisted of random assortments of materials such as low-quality brick, cobbles, flints, pebbles, rubble, wood and sand, set in hydraulic lime and shuttered. Bungaroosh was often faced with render or stucco to make it weatherproof. Some flint buildings survive on Prince's Crescent. When built, most windows in the conservation area's houses were <b>sashes,</b> and roofs were of Welsh slate.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the early}} {{industrial}} development in Minneapolis was tied to St. Anthony Falls and the power it provided. Between 1848 and 1887, Minneapolis {{led the nation in}} sawmilling. In 1856, the mills produced 12 million board feet (28,000 m³) of lumber. That total had risen to about 91,000,000 board feet (215,000 m³) in 1869, and 960,000,000 board feet (2,270,000 m³) in 1899. During the peak of this activity, at least 13 sawmills were operating on the falls. The sawmills also supported related industries such as mills that planed and smoothed the lumber; factories that built <b>sashes,</b> doors, and windows; and manufacturers of shingles and wooden buckets.|$|E

However, 14th-century Egyptian historian Ahmad al-Qalqashandi counters al-Umari's account, writing that Darum was the last halting post before Gaza. Roads, bridges, postal stations and a khan (caravanserai) {{were built in the}} town to accommodate the messengers. Pigeon mail service was introduced for which towers were built. Produce available in Darum during this time period included barley, wheat, grapes and grape leaves, olives, raspberries, lemons, figs, sweet melons, pomegranates and dates.

5000|$|A <b>sash</b> {{window or}} hung <b>sash</b> window {{is made of}} one or more movable panels, or [...] "sashes", that form a frame to hold panes of glass, which are often {{separated}} from other panes (or [...] "lights") by glazing bars, also known as muntins in the US (moulded strips of wood). Although any window with this style of glazing is technically a <b>sash,</b> the term is used almost exclusively to refer to windows where the glazed panels are opened by sliding vertically, or horizontally in a style known as a [...] "Yorkshire light", sliding <b>sash,</b> or <b>sash</b> and case (so called because the weights are concealed in a box case). The oldest surviving examples of <b>sash</b> windows were installed in England in the 1670s, for example at Ham House. The invention of the <b>sash</b> window is sometimes credited, without conclusive evidence, to Robert Hooke. Others see the <b>sash</b> window as a Dutch invention. H.J.

40|$|Apoptosis is {{a highly}} {{regulated}} cellular process that functions to remove undesired cells from multicellular organisms. This pathway is often disrupted in cancer, providing tumours with a mechanism to avoid cell death and promote growth and survival. The putative tumour suppressor, <b>SASH</b> 1 (SAM and SH 3 domain containing protein 1), has been previously implicated in the regulation of apoptosis; however, the molecular role of <b>SASH</b> 1 in this process is still unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that <b>SASH</b> 1 is cleaved by caspase- 3 following UVC-induced apoptosis. Proteolysis of <b>SASH</b> 1 enables the C-terminal fragment to translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus where it associates with chromatin. The overexpression of wild-type <b>SASH</b> 1 or a cleaved form of <b>SASH</b> 1 representing amino acids 231 – 1247 leads {{to an increase in}} apoptosis. Conversely, mutation of the <b>SASH</b> 1 cleavage site inhibits nuclear translocation and prevents the initiation of apoptosis. <b>SASH</b> 1 cleavage is also required for the efficient translocation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) to the nucleus. The use of the NF-κB inhibitor DHMEQ demonstrated that the effect of <b>SASH</b> 1 on apoptosis was dependent on NF-κB, indicating a codependence between <b>SASH</b> 1 and NF-κB for this process...|$|R

Women's blouses in Suvalkija are distinguishable from those of other regions by their wider sleeves and by more extensive decorations. Their aprons were especially richly decorated and colorful, with Kapsai laying stripes and other ornaments horizontally, while the Zanavykai preferred vertical compositions. Women also wore richly decorated <b>sashes</b> around their waists. These <b>sashes</b> used more complex ornaments than in other regions, where more archaic but simpler geometric forms prevailed. Because of their relative complexity, folk art collectors placed a higher value on these <b>sashes.</b> A few examples were presented in the first Lithuanian art exhibition in 1907. Bodices at first were identical to those in Dzūkija, but diverged by the mid-19th century. Bodices in Zanavykai had short laps, while bodices of Kapsai were long and flared. Young girls and married women could be told apart by their headdresses. Young girls in Kapsai wore tall golden galoons, while maidens in Zanavykai wore narrow galloons, sometimes replacing them with beads. Married women wore bonnets {{similar to those in}} Dzūkija.|$|E

40|$|International audienceObjective: We have {{previously}} reported that <b>SASH</b> 1 expression is increased in circulating human monocytes from smokers and {{was positively correlated}} with the number of carotid atherosclerotic plaques. The aim {{of this study was to}} further validate the link between smoking, <b>SASH</b> 1 and atherosclerosis within the vascular wall and to assess the impact of <b>SASH</b> 1 expression on endothelial cell functions. Method: Human carotids with atherosclerotic plaques were obtained from 58 patients (45 of them with known smoking status: smoker, non-smoker, ex-smokers), and were processed for gene expression analyses and immunostaining. To investigate its function, <b>SASH</b> 1 was silenced in human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) using two different siRNA and subcellular localization of <b>SASH</b> 1 was determined by immunostaining and subcellular fractionation. Subsequently the transcriptomic analyses and functional experiments (wound healing, WST- 1 proliferation or Matrigel assays) were performed to characterize <b>SASH</b> 1 function. Results: <b>SASH</b> 1 was expressed in human vascular cells (HAECs, smooth muscle cells) and in monocytes/macrophages. Its tissue expression was significantly higher in the atherosclerotic carotids of smokers compared to non-smokers (p < 0. 01). In HAECs, <b>SASH</b> 1 was expressed mostly in the cytoplasm and <b>SASH</b> 1 knockdown resulted in an increased cell migration, proliferation and angiogenesis. Transcriptomic and pathway analyses showed that <b>SASH</b> 1 silencing results in a decreased CYP 1 A 1 expression possibly through the inhibition of TP 53 activity. Conclusion: We showed that <b>SASH</b> 1 expression is increased in atherosclerotic carotids in smokers and its silencing affects endothelial angiogenic functions; therefore we provide a potential link between smoking and atherosclerosis through <b>SASH</b> 1 expression...|$|R
