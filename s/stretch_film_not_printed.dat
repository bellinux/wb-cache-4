40|$|ABSTRACT: The <b>stretch</b> <b>film</b> {{industry}} has grown at phenomenal rates {{over the past}} 6 – 8 years. During that time, <b>stretch</b> <b>film</b> has evolved from monolayer to three layer and now commonly a five or seven layer product. This film is processed on equipment that varies in size and width along with other technolo-gical differences. This paper reviews the <b>stretch</b> <b>film</b> industry, outlines the major <b>stretch</b> <b>film</b> properties, and shows (by a case study comparison of two similar cast systems) how equipment and process variables can affect <b>stretch</b> <b>film</b> properties...|$|R
40|$|We use plastic packagings in {{our daily}} life to store our food, making it to keep its {{freshness}} for longer. Plastic packages main function is to preserve food from spoilage by cutting off the contact with oxygen as it causes organisms to react with food, leading to deterioration and after some point, spoilage. I chose to study with ‘stretch film’ as it is mostly used in daily life. The focus {{of this study is}} to test that if <b>stretch</b> <b>film</b> is preventing food from spoilage or not. It is not possible to investigate a specific bacteria in deterioration, so that total colonization is used. As meat is one of the products which is widely consumed and able to deteriorate faster than others, I used ‘boiled meat’(boiled to make it sterilized) to test in this experiment. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate whether <b>stretch</b> <b>filming</b> preserve food from spoilage, by counting total colonization, on meat. In the experiment, the ‘boiled meat’ divided equally to 14 containers, 7 open and 7 wrapped by sretch film, which will be analyzed at different days to see deterioration as the time passes. Meat samples are homogenized via serial dilution and incubated on agar medium over 30 ⁰C for 72 hours, total colonization were counted. These values were then processed and microbiological deterioration of boiled meat were obtained. As the time passes, meat samples in open containers were spoiled while the ones that in containers wrapped with <b>stretch</b> <b>film</b> preserved from spoilage. In this investigation, it was found that wrapping <b>stretch</b> <b>film</b> is effective in protection of food. No spoilage of boiled meat is observed in the containers wrapped by <b>stretch</b> <b>film</b> while the most spoilage is observed in the open containers. Overall, the results of this study advocates the hypothesis that <b>stretch</b> <b>filming</b> is protective against the spoilage of food...|$|R

40|$|The {{composition}} of baled silage on Irish farms frequently {{differs from that}} of comparable precision-chop silage. This paper concerns a field-scale study designed to investigate: (a) the effects of number of layers (2, 4, 6 or 8) of polyethylene <b>stretch</b> <b>film</b> and the duration of storage (7 vs. 18 months) on the conservation characteristics of baled silage, and (b) the conservation characteristics of baled (4 layers of <b>stretch</b> <b>film)</b> and precision-chop silages. All silages were made following three durations of wilting (0, 24 or 48 h). Wilting restricted silage fermentation, with silage pH being highest (P< 0. 001) and the concentration of fermentation products lowest (P< 0. 001) for the 48 h wilt treatment. Wrapping bales in only 2 layers of polyethylene <b>stretch</b> <b>film</b> resulted in extensive visible mould growth, but mould growth was practically eliminated by the application of 4 or more layers of film. Silage fermentation characteristics were generally improved by wilting, and by 4 compared to 2 layers of <b>stretch</b> <b>film.</b> Extending the storage duration of baled silage from 7 to 18 months reduced (P< 0. 001) the concentration of fermentation products and increased in-silo fresh weight losses (P< 0. 001) and visible mould growth. Whereas 4 layers of conventional <b>stretch</b> <b>film</b> are normally sufficient, 6 layers may be necessary to prevent mould growth when bales of unwilted silage are stored for a second season. Under good farm-management conditions differences observed between baled and precision-chop silages probably result mainly from differences in the concentration of dry matter in herbage at ensiling. peer-reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Relaxation {{processes}} and structural transitions in nonstretched and uniaxially <b>stretched</b> <b>films</b> of poly(vinylidene fluoride-hexafluoropropylene) (P(VDF-HFP)) and its homopolymer polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) for comparison were investigated {{with the aim}} of understanding the electromechanical properties of this lower-modulus ferroelectric copolymer. The mechanical and the dielectric response at the glass transition (a relaxation) exhibit similar temperature dependence of the relaxation time, whereas mechanical and dielectric processes above the glass transition are not related. They represent a continuous softening process within the amorphous phase and the dielectric c relaxation, respectively. The latter is attributed to conformational changes of VDF segments in lamellae of spherulites constituting the nonpolar crystalline phase. Furthermore, there is a contribution from melting of secondary crystallites formed in the amorphous phase during annealing or storage. Mecha nically, this transition appears in nonstretched and <b>stretched</b> <b>films</b> as an accelerated decrease of the elastic modulus that terminates the rubber plateau. Dielectrically, this transition becomes visible as a frequency-independent loss peak only in <b>stretched</b> <b>films,</b> because <b>stretching</b> removes the c relaxation, which superimposes the transition in nonstretched films. Melting of secondary crystallites is shown to appear in the homopolymer, too, though less pronounced because of more complete primary crystallisation...|$|R

40|$|Beta-phase poly(vinylidene fluoride-hexafluoropropylene) (P(VDF-HFP)) {{copolymer}} {{films were}} prepared by uniaxially stretching solution-cast or melt-quenched samples. Different preparation routes lead to different {{amounts of the}} crystalline alpha and beta phases in the films, as detected by means of Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffractometry. The beta phase is significantly enhanced in melt-quenched and <b>stretched</b> <b>films</b> in comparison to solution-cast and <b>stretched</b> <b>films.</b> This is particularly true for copolymer samples with higher HFP content. The beta-phase enhancement is also observed in ferroelectric-hysteresis experiments where a rather high polarization of 58 mC/m(2) was found on melt-quenched and stretched samples after poling at electric fields of 140 MV/m. After poling at 160 MV/m, one of these samples exhibited a piezoelectric d(33) coefficient as high as 21 pC/N. An electric-field-induced partial transition from the alpha to the beta phase was also observed on the melt-quenched and stretched samples. This effect leads to a further increase in the applications-relevant dipole polarization. Uniaxially <b>stretched</b> ferroelectric-polymer <b>films</b> are highly anisotropic.

40|$|Despite much {{excellent}} {{work over}} the years, the vast history of scientific filmmaking is still largely unknown. Historians of science have long been concerned with visual culture, communication and the public sphere on the one hand, and with expertise, knowledge production and experimental practice on the other. Scientists, we know, drew pictures, took photographs and made three-dimensional models. Rather like models, <b>films</b> could <b>not</b> be <b>printed</b> in journals until the digital era, and this limited their usefulness as evidence. But that did not stop researchers from making movies for projection at conferences {{as well as in}} lecture halls, museums and other public venues, not to mention for breaking down into individual frames for analysis. Historians of science {{are more likely to be}} found in the library, archive or museum than the darkened screening room, and much work is still needed to demonstrate the major effects of cinema on scientific knowledge. Film may have taken as long to change science as other areas of social life, but one can begin to glimpse important ways in which 'image machines' (cameras, projectors and the like) were beginning to mediate between backstage experimental work and more public demonstration even around 1900.
