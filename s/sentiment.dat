Much of this press coverage took a negative stance toward the EU, mainstream newspapers like the Daily Mail, The Telegraph and The Times promoting Eurosceptic <b>sentiment.</b> Such debates were influenced by the UK's recent signing of the Maastricht Treaty and the looming possibility that the country would adopt the euro currency.|$|E

There are positive effects of past stock market returns on irrational <b>sentiments</b> but not on rational <b>sentiments.</b> The results support the economic fundamentals-based arguments of stock returns.

5|$|Accusations of Żydokomuna {{accompanied}} the incidents of anti-Jewish violence in Poland during Polish–Soviet War of 1920, legitimized as self-defense against {{a people who}} were oppressors of the Polish nation. Some soldiers and officers in the Polish eastern territories shared the conviction that Jews were enemies of the Polish nation-state and were collaborators with Poland's enemies. Some of these troops treated all Jews as Bolsheviks. According to some sources, anticommunist <b>sentiment</b> was implicated in anti-Jewish violence and killings {{in a number of}} towns, including the Pinsk massacre, in which 35 Jews, taken as hostages, were murdered, and the Lwów pogrom during the Polish-Ukrainian War, in which 72 Jews were killed.

40|$|This study {{provides}} {{new insights into}} the relationships between social media <b>sentiments</b> and the stock market in China. Based on machine learning, we classify microblogs posted on Sina Weibo, a Twitter's variant in China into five detailed <b>sentiments</b> of anger, disgust, fear, joy, and sadness. Using wavelet analysis, we find close positive linkages between <b>sentiments</b> and the stock return, which have both frequency and time-varying features. Five detailed <b>sentiments</b> are positively related to the stock return for certain periods, particularly since October 2014 at medium to high frequencies of less than ten trading days, when the stock return is undergoing significant fluctuations. Sadness appears to have a closer relationship with the stock return than the other four <b>sentiments.</b> As to the lead-lag relationships, the stock return causes Weibo <b>sentiments</b> rather than reverse for most of the periods with significant linkages. Compared with polarity <b>sentiments</b> (negative vs. positive), detailed <b>sentiments</b> provide more information regarding relationships between Weibo <b>sentiments</b> and the stock market. The stock market exerts positive effects on bullishness and agreement of microblogs. Meanwhile, agreement leads the stock return in-phase at the frequency of approximately 40 trading days, indicating that less disagreement improves certainty about the stock market...|$|R

40|$|Several authors {{recognize}} that consumers have social <b>sentiments</b> and therefore derive utility from contributing {{resources to the}} provision of public goods. However, there is little discussion {{in the literature on}} how these <b>sentiments</b> develop. This paper models how social <b>sentiments</b> develop in communities and how they affect private provision. We propose that increases in the provision of public goods lead to increases in consumers’ social <b>sentiments.</b> Given the assumptions of the model a community would converge to an equilibrium level of social <b>sentiments</b> with higher private provision that predicted by traditional theory. Although government provision partially crowds out private provision in the short-run it can increase, or crowds in, private provision in the long run by moving the community to a new equilibrium with higher social <b>sentiments.</b> When consumers have heterogeneous preferences, the government can increase private provision and move the community to an equilibrium with higher social <b>sentiments</b> by redistributing income between consumers. ...|$|R

There is existing literature on individual and country-level variable s to explain why prejudice exists, but this research examines the impact of political institutions on anti-Muslim <b>sentiments.</b> Based on new institutionalism theory, electoral systems can shape public attitudes by providing far-right parties a platform to put their concerns on the agenda, and these parties promote anti-Muslim popular <b>sentiments.</b> The results of this analysis support this argument in that the larger the average district magnitude in a country, the greater the anti-Muslim <b>sentiments.</b> The findings also show that an increase in far-right party vote-share also covaries {{with an increase in}} anti-Muslim <b>sentiments...</b>|$|R
