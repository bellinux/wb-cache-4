5|$|When Wilkes {{returned}} from California to New York City, {{he began to}} work for William T. Porter at Porter's newspaper The <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> the Times. Porter sold the paper in 1856 to Wilkes, who retained Porter on the newspaper's staff until Porter's death in 1858. Wilkes, however, renamed the paper to Porter's <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> the Times, a title it retained until 1859. In September 1859, Abraham C. Dayton, who had previously worked for the Spirit, left the paper and because he had purchased {{a share of the}} paper at one point from Porter, began publishing a paper he called Porter's <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> the Times. Dayton got a court order preventing Wilkes from using Porter's name, so Wilkes changed the name of his paper to Wilkes' <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> the Times, while Dayton continued to publish Porter's <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> the Times. Dayton was only able to publish until August 1861, however, as Wilkes drove the other paper out of business. Wilkes owned the surviving paper until his death in 1885.|$|E
