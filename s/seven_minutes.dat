40|$|Cognitive tests play {{a crucial}} part in the {{assessment}} of dementia. In 1998 the <b>Seven</b> <b>Minute</b> Screen was developed by Solomon and colleagues. The test was originally designed to distinguish between Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and normal ageing, and research showed that the instrument is highly sensitive to AD. Subsequent research also proved the diagnostic accuracy of the <b>Seven</b> <b>Minute</b> Screen in the detection of other common types of dementia, such as vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies. This article reports new research on the predictive validity of the <b>Seven</b> <b>Minute</b> Screen using 289 cognitively intact subjects, 175 patients with MCI and 563 patients with dementia in the setting of a memory clinic. In addition, a comparison is made with the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). The study demonstrates that the <b>Seven</b> <b>Minute</b> Screen is a valuable screening instrument for all common types of dementia, and it has added value to the MMSE. The sensitivity for dementia is 96 % and the specificity 93 %, in comparison to 69 and 98 % for the MMSE (< 24). The sensitivity for the various types of dementia is consistently high, ranging from 92 % for a subcortical dementia to 97 % for AD. The <b>Seven</b> <b>Minute</b> Screen requires little training, and combines a short administration time with a high diagnostic accuracy. This makes the <b>Seven</b> <b>Minute</b> Screen useful for application in memory clinics...|$|R
