40|$|A sound {{financial}} {{system is the}} cornerstone of any country‘s economy. As South Africa has always been deemed to have a sound legal framework pertaining to the financial market, it has never faced the situation where it had to extensively review its entire legal framework. However, the recent global economic meltdown left policy makers, internationally, questioning the soundness of their {{financial system}}s and South Africa has been no exception. This dissertation provides an overview of the legal framework pertaining to selected segments of the financial market. This legal framework is then tested against certain selected issues highlighted by the global economic meltdown in order to establish whether it was and still is sufficiently robust to effectively negotiate these challenges. In order to deal with the selected segments of the legal framework pertaining to the financial market as comprehensively as possible, the selected segments {{for the purposes of this}} dissertation include the capital market, the money market and the derivative market. This dissertation also evaluates the impact of other recent domestic developments pertaining to securities settlement in South Africa. These developments include the recently promulgated Companies Act 71 of 2008 and the currently drafted Participant Failure Manual. This dissertation suggests that the Companies Act 71 of 2008 will have a significant impact on securities settlement. It is recommended that companies, holders of uncertificated securities and holders of beneficial interests in uncertificated securities familiarise themselves with their revised rights and obligations in order to, amongst other things, ensure compliance with this new legislative framework. This dissertation reveals that, even though our financial system has been found to be fundamentally sound and thus far have dealt with the global economic meltdown quite well, legislative reform to conform to international best practice is imperative. It is recommended that policy makers should strive to ensure that the South African legal framework pertaining to the financial market is sufficiently aligned with the principles, methodologies and recommendations as provided for by the international institutions providing best practice. The highlighted areas of legislative reform include the legal frameworks pertaining to credit rating agencies, investor due diligence, ix crisis management tools, compensation structures, accounting and valuations <b>standards,</b> <b>issuer</b> transparency, market transparency and risk management. This dissertation highlights that a significant amount of legislative amendments and endorsements by the relevant regulators and the Master of the Court are required for the successful integration of the Participant Failure Manual into the legal framework pertaining to the financial market. If, when and how the notion of Participant Failure will be accepted and regulated by the relevant regulators, without creating a conflict of interest, remains a question to be answere...|$|R
40|$|In 2015, the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) Economic Community was {{formally}} established and its {{aim was to}} achieve, among other things, an integrated securities market within ASEAN. Before the formal establishment of the ASEAN Economic Community, in 2009, {{with a view to}}wards achieving the objective of securities integration, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand adopted the ASEAN Disclosure Standards, a set of harmonized disclosure <b>standards</b> for <b>issuers</b> making cross-border initial public offerings (IPOs). These participating Member States also entered into a framework for the expedited review for cross-listings. However, more than 5 years later, there is no documented use of the ASEAN Disclosure Standards; cross-border IPOs and cross-listings remain rare. This article is a study of cross-border IPOs of issuers in, and cross-listings within, the participating Member States during the 2010 – 2014 period, with a view to obtaining insights on how issuers access capital markets. These insights are relevant to the broader questions about the long-term viability of ASEAN’s regulatory policies of promoting integration through harmonization of minimum standards along with limited mutual recognition. This article compares the ASEAN approach with the EU Prospectus Directive and the Trans-Tasman Mutual Offering Framework. This article argues that to move to a truly pan-ASEAN equity offering, there needs to be, at a minimum, a greater supervisory and enforcement convergence...|$|R

Despite the cramped and less than suitable quarters the bank continued to grow, opening branches in Eskifjörður in the East Fjords and Selfoss in South Iceland in 1918. [...] During the economic upheaval caused by World War I countries abandoned the gold <b>standard.</b> The currency <b>issuer</b> in Iceland, Íslandsbanki, was authorised to issue Icelandic krónur notes not backed by gold, but which it was to keep at par value with Danish kroner. Which Íslandsbanki could not manage, as both banks’ activities during the post-war years especially reflected the country’s economic difficulties and plummeting prices for Icelandic exports. The major economic crisis caused widespread defaults on loans, especially at Íslandsbanki. It lost its monopoly to issue banknotes and after a two-year dispute the question was resolved and Landsbanki was granted this right. From 1924 onwards, Landsbanki regained its vitality and re-opened in new and even more imposing premises built on its former Austurstræti location. The building was designed by State Architect Guðjón Samúelsson and decorated with murals by painters Jón Stefánsson and Jóhannes Kjarval.|$|R
40|$|Investors {{and policy}} makers often view agency and Treasury debt as substitutes, even {{formally}} so in some contexts. Using a large sample of Government Sponsored Enterprise (GSE) issues and corporate, financial issues floated during 1994 - 2004, we study {{the behavior of the}} portion of spreads over Treasury yields that are unexplained by <b>standard</b> issue and <b>issuer</b> characteristics. GSE residual yields (1) reflect priced, time-varying macroeconomic risk, (2) strongly correlate with non-GSE residual spreads, (3) responded similarly to non-GSE yields during the Long Term Capital Management Crisis. In terms of exposure to macroeconomic risk, agency debt is surprisingly comparable to corporate debt. Agency debt issued by Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs) such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is thought by many to carry an implicit federal guarantee against default, even though formal backing by the full faith and credit by the U. S. Government is absent. For this and other reasons, agency debt has long held special status as a near substitute for Treasury debt. Ambrose and King (2002) find evidence that as the stock of Treasury debt fell during the late 1990 s, investors increasingly turned to a growing supply of GSE debt. In some contexts, substitutability is made explicit. For example, to meet reserve requirements, U. S. banks ar...|$|R
40|$|In the United States, when a {{consumer}} presents a payment to a merchant, the merchant typically makes {{a request for}} authorization before accepting the payment. Personal information, such as an account number, address, or telephone number, are often enough to initiate a payment. A serious weakness of this system is that criminals who obtain the correct personal information can impersonate an honest consumer and commit payments fraud.; A key to improving security-and reducing payments fraud-might be payment smart cards. Payment smart cards have an embedded computer chip that encrypts messages to aid authorization. If properly configured, payment smart cards could provide direct benefits to consumers, merchants, banks, and others. These groups would be less vulnerable {{to the effects of}} fraud and the cost of fraud prevention would fall. Smart cards could also provide indirect benefits to society by allowing a more efficient payment system. Smart cards have already been adopted in other countries, allowing a more secure payments process and a more efficient payments system.; Sullivan explores why smart cards have the potential to provide strong payment authorization and thus put a substantial dent into the problems of payments fraud and identity theft. But adopting smart cards in the United States faces some significant challenges. First, the industry must adopt payment smart cards and their new security <b>standards.</b> Second, card <b>issuers</b> and others in the payments industry must agree on the specific forms of security protocols used in smart cards. In both steps the industry must overcome market incentives that can impede the adoption of payment smart cards or limit the strength of their security. ...|$|R
40|$|According to the Reserve Bank of Australia (2006) the {{increased}} supply of Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities (CMBS), {{with a range}} of subordination, has broadened the investor base in real estate debt markets and reduced the commercial property sector’s dependence on bank financing The CMBS market {{has been one of the}} most dynamic and fastest-growing sectors in the capital markets, for a market which was virtually nonexistent prior to 1990. The global CMBS market issuance which stood at AU 5. 1 billion (US 4 billion) in 1990 had grown to AU 380 billion (US 299 billion) by the end of 2006. In Australia, a total of over 60 CMBSs with nearly 180 tranches totalling over AU 17. 4 billion had been issued to December 2006 from when they were first introduced in 1999. To date few studies have been done on Australian CMBSs outside the credit rating agency circles. These studies are predominantly practitioner focused (Jones Lang LaSalle 2001; Richardson 2003; Roche 2000, 2002). O’Sullivan (1998) and Simonovski (2003) are the only academic studies on CMBSs. As such, this thesis examines issues relating to the development of Australian CMBSs and quantitatively and qualitatively analyses the structuring of Australian CMBSs. In assessing the growth of the Australian CMBS market, an interpretive historical approach (Baumgarter & Hensley 2005) is adopted to provide a cogent review and explanation of features of international and Australian CMBSs. This helps to understand the changing nature of the market and provides better understanding of the present and suggests possible future directions. The Australian CMBS market is matured in comparison with the larger US and EU CMBS markets as seen by the diversity of asset classes backing the issues and transaction types, tightening spreads, and record issuance volumes. High property market transparency (Jones Lang LaSalle 2006 b) and predominance of Listed Property Trusts (LPT) as CMBS <b>issuers</b> (<b>Standard</b> & Poor’s 2005 b), who legally have to report their activities and underlying collateral performance to regulatory regimes such as Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) /Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) and their equity partners, have contributed to the success of the Australian CMBS market. Furthermore, the positive commercial real estate market outlook should support future CMBS issuance, with LPTs continuing their dominance as issuers. In investigating property risk assessment in Australian CMBSs, all the CMBSs issued over a six year period of 2000 to 2005 were obtained from Standard and Poor’s presale reports as found in their Ratings Direct database to identify and review how property risk factors were addressed in all issues and within specific property asset classes following the delineation of property risk by Adair and Hutchinson (2005). Adequate assessment of property risk and its reporting is critical to the success of CMBS issues. The proposed framework shows that assessing and reporting property risk in Australian CMBSs, which are primarily backed by direct property assets, under the headings of investment quality risk, covenant strength risk, and depreciation and obsolescence risk can easily be done. The proposed framework should prove useful to rating agencies, bond issuers and institutional investors. Rating agencies can adopt a more systematic and consistent approach towards reporting of assessed property risk in CMBSs. Issuers and institutional investors can examine the perceived consistency and appropriateness of the rating assigned to a CMBS issue by providing inferences concerning property risk assessment.

The ultimate goal of structuring CMBS transactions is to obtain a high credit rating as this has an impact on the yield obtainable and the success of the issue. The credit rating process involves highly subjective assessment of both qualitative and quantitative factors of a particular company as well as pertinent industry level or market level variables (Huang et al. 2004), with the final rating assigned by a credit committee via voting (Kwon et al. 1997). As such, credit rating agencies state that researchers cannot replicate their ratings quantitatively since their ratings reflect each agency’s opinion about an issue’s potential default risk and relies heavily on a committee’s analysis of the issuer’s ability and willingness to repay its debt. However, researchers have replicated bond ratings on the premise that financial ratios contain a large amount of information about a company’s credit risk. In this study, quantitative analysis of determinants of CMBS credit ratings issued by Standard and Poor’s from 2000 – 2006 using ANNs and OR and qualitative analysis of factors considered necessary to obtain a high credit rating and pricing issues necessary for the success of an issue through mail surveys of arrangers and issuers are undertaken. Of the quantitative variables propagated by credit rating agencies as being important to CMBS rating, only loan-to-value ratio (LTV) is found to be statistically significant, with the other variables being statistically insignificant using OR. This leads to the conclusion that statistical approaches used in corporate bond rating studies have limited replication capabilities in CMBS rating and that the endogeneity arguments raise significant questions about LTV and debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) as convenient, short-cut measures of CMBS default risk.

However, ANNs do offer promising predictive results and can be used to facilitate implementation of survey-based CMBS rating systems. This should contribute to making the CMBS rating methodology become more explicit which is advantageous in that both CMBS investors and issuers are provided with greater information and faith in the investment.
