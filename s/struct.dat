40|$|AutoMap is a {{compiler}} {{that automatically}} translates C <b>structs</b> into MPI datatypes. Its grammar recognizes flags {{in the code}} that tell which C <b>structs</b> require MPI datatypes. It then reads these <b>structs</b> and creates the MPI datatypes for them. There are few limitations on the C <b>structs</b> it can handle. For example, <b>structs</b> can contain pointers and arrays, {{as well as the}} usual data types. Additionally, the <b>structs</b> can be nested, creating nested datatypes. The utility can be used standalone; or it can be used in conjunction with AutoLink. AutoLink is an MPI library for sending and receiving dynamic data structures.

25|$|This {{function}} {{defines a}} method that works on any instance conforming to Equatable, providing a not equals function. Any instance, class or <b>struct,</b> automatically gains this implementation simply by conforming to Equatable. As many instances gain Equatable through their base implementations or other generic extensions, most basic objects in the runtime gain equals and not equals with no code.|$|E
25|$|Similarly to C# and in {{contrast}} to most other OO languages, Swift offers built-in support for objects using either pass-by-reference or pass-by-value semantics, the former using the class declaration and the latter using <b>struct.</b> Structs in Swift have almost all the same features as classes: methods, implementing protocols, and using the extension mechanisms. For this reason, Apple terms all data generically as instances, versus objects or values. Structs do not support inheritance, however.|$|E

40|$|We {{represent}} strings over {{a finite}} alphabet {{by the data}} structures, called string <b>structs,</b> introduced in the evolving transformation system (ETS) model, which was proposed as a general model for structural object representation and classification and has been formalized recently. Then we describe string languages as classes of <b>structs</b> generated by a finite set of context-sensitive transformations. The transformations {{are assumed to be}} additive, or non-deleting, {{in order to maintain the}} explicitness of representation of the constructive history of objects from a class, postulated in the ETS formalism. In case of strings, additive transformations are context-sensitive insertions; however, in case of <b>structs</b> they are more general. We prove that any recursive language can be represented as a class of string <b>structs</b> generated by additive transforms. ...|$|R

2500|$|Structures {{are more}} {{commonly}} known as <b>structs.</b> <b>Structs</b> are user-defined value types that are declared using the [...] keyword.

2500|$|Structures {{require some}} {{more work than}} classes. For example, you need to {{explicitly}} create a default constructor which takes no arguments to initialize the <b>struct</b> and its members. The compiler will create a default one for classes. All fields and properties of a <b>struct</b> must have been initialized before an instance is created. Structs do not have finalizers and cannot inherit from another class like classes do. However, they inherit from , that inherits from [...] Structs {{are more suitable for}} smaller constructs of data.|$|E
