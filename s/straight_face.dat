25|$|Following Meiners, Blumenbach {{described}} the Caucasian race as {{consisting of the}} native inhabitants of Europe, West Asia, the Indian peninsula, and North Africa, including toward the south the Moors, Abyssinians and adjacent groups. His idealized Caucasian variety was distinguished by a white complexion, with rosy cheeks; brown or chestnut-colored hair; a subglobular head; an oval and <b>straight</b> <b>face,</b> with moderately defined parts; a smooth forehead; a narrow nose, often slightly hooked; and a small mouth. However, pragmatically, Blumenbach acknowledged that skin color of the Caucasian variety naturally ranged from white to dark brown tones.|$|E

In VIP label's Popular Old People's Home, {{released in}} December 2004, Tachibana {{was part of the}} female staff at a rest home populated by sexually aggressive senior citizens. AV Actress Is A Receptionist, released in January 2005, was part of a humiliation-themed series on the Hot Entertainment label. The situation, claimed to have been rehearsed for two months and employing thirty extras, has Tachibana taking a job as a receptionist at a job fair. While she is engaged in the duties of her job, an actor has sex with Tachibana from behind. The video records Tachibana's embarrassed efforts to maintain a <b>straight</b> <b>face</b> while performing her receptionist role.|$|E
500|$|According to Aycox, the {{exorcism}} of {{the demon}} from Meg Masters took {{two days to}} shoot; {{the first day of}} filming lasted 13 hours, while the second lasted for [...] "about a half a day". Director Kim Manners used 360-degree shots and close-ups to make the sequence exciting. In the scene following the exorcism, in which Bobby is bent over a dying Meg, Aycox and Ackles read their lines off-screen so that Beaver's reaction could be shot. However, the two were [...] "so slap-happy" [...] to be almost done that they could not stop laughing; to everyone's surprise, Beaver was able to keep a <b>straight</b> <b>face.</b> The setBobby Singer's homewas filled with waist-high stacks of six thousand books.|$|E

500|$|For {{the scenes}} {{involving}} self-defense courses, the supporting cast underwent stunt training {{with the help}} of stunt coordinator Sean Graham. Ron wears a back support belt during the course, which was actor Nick Offerman's idea. Offerman has many fight choreography skills from his past work in the Chicago theater, and he combined those skills with his training in Kabuki dance and theater. Offerman said, [...] "I threw in a couple of Kabuki moves that we all had a hard time keeping a <b>straight</b> <b>face</b> through." [...] It was a reference to the episode [...] "The Stakeout", in which Ron suffered a hernia, and Muharrar said, [...] "The idea [...] that Ron has the belt in his car trunk and is ready to go at a moment's notice." ...|$|E
500|$|Anderson {{sought to}} capture the nostalgic feel of the 1950s. In this effort, he used several themes {{associated}} with the time period, including alien invasion movies, nuclear threats, Cold War paranoia, and optimism in the future. About the time period, Anderson said [...] "it seemed like {{this was a time}} when you could say with a <b>straight</b> <b>face,</b> 'I'm fighting for truth, justice and the American way.'" [...] For the characters Anderson was picturing George Reeves's Superman and Noel Neill's Lois Lane as portrayed in the 1950s television series Adventures of Superman. One reviewer noted that Anderson's portrayal of Lex Luthor is that of the post-Crisis on Infinite Earths amoral businessman and Batman was more reminiscent of a 1930s-style or a [...] ""-style Batman where he is actively pursued by the police.|$|E
500|$|Mendes {{encouraged}} some improvisation; for example, when Lester masturbates in {{bed beside}} Carolyn, the director asked Spacey to improvise several euphemisms for the act in each take. Mendes said, [...] "I wanted that {{not just because}} it was funny but because I didn't want it to seem rehearsed. I wanted it to seem like he was blurting it out of his mouth without thinking. [...] is so in control—I wanted him to break through." [...] Spacey obliged, eventually coming up with 35 phrases, but Bening could not always keep a <b>straight</b> <b>face,</b> which meant the scene had to be shot 10 times. The production used small amounts of computer-generated imagery. Most of the rose petals in Lester's fantasies were added in post-production, although some were real and had the wires holding them digitally removed. When Lester fantasizes about Angela in a rose-petal bath, the steam was real, save for in the overhead shot. To position the camera, a hole had to be cut in the ceiling, through which the steam escaped; it was instead added digitally.|$|E

[...] Knoxville News Sentinels writer Terry Morrow also commented that the episode reminded him of The Carol Burnett Show because of its [...] "goofiness and by-the-seat-of-its-pants style." [...] Morrow added that the episode made him laugh {{more than any other}} sitcom on network television. Jeffrey Kauffman of DVD Talk praised Baldwin for his performance and commented that [...] "Alive and Schticking" [...] helped [...] "jumpstart the series creatively after a couple of seasons" [...] and [...] "It's fun [...] to see the actors momentarily break character, a la The Carol Burnett Show, where the absurdity of certain situations (usually involving Jack and/or Karen) makes giggling all but impossible." [...] Entertainment Weekly television critic Gary Susman gave [...] "Alive and Schticking" [...] four stars, while Frazier Moore of the Associated Press lauded it as a [...] "fun, and attention-grabbing, note."

500|$|Some {{parts of}} the episode {{consisted}} of a mixture of written dialogue and comedic improvisation from the actors. In one such scene, Aziz Ansari attempts to flirt with Rashida Jones when she speaks at a Parks and Recreation public forum. The scene {{was included in the}} script, but Ansari continued to improvise long after his dialogue ended, and Jones said she found it difficult to keep a <b>straight</b> <b>face</b> during filming. Schur encouraged Ansari to continue, and suggested the line in which Ansari asks to go away with Jones for the weekend. Daniels called the scene [...] "probably the highlight of the pilot." [...] The ending included another example of written dialogue mixed with improvisation, when Ansari recited a list of unusual things Leslie has attempted to do while drunk. In other scenes, the written dialogue was abandoned altogether in favor of improvisation, such as the scene of Ann and Andy talking on Ann's couch after Leslie fell into the pit and injured herself. Chris Pratt improvised a number of other lines and scenes in the episode, including when Andy asked Leslie to pass him his [...] "itch stick", which he then used to scratch under his leg cast in an awkward and disgusting way.|$|E
500|$|The character's {{role in the}} anime {{adaptation}} of Persona 4 earned similar response. A reviewer from T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews commented that Yu [...] "seems to be the aggregate of all the quirkiest possible choices you could make in the game," [...] making him likable character for his diverse scenes. When first watching the Persona 4 anime, Elliot Page from UK Anime Network noted that although Yu was not a silent character as in the video game, he had little dialogue and the pacing managed {{to make up for}} it. In a later review, Andy Hanley from the same site said he liked how the protagonist was handled, as the staff used his [...] "blank state" [...] to create comedic interactions. Briana Lawrence from the Fandom Post shared similar feelings, stating that the staff [...] "somehow managed to give a silent protagonist a personality that's not only believable, but likable." [...] Lawrence appreciated how the character was developed across the series thanks to all the bonds he forms into a [...] "snarky, lovable main character who can keep a <b>straight</b> <b>face</b> while being kicked off a cliff." [...] While also commenting how Yu manages to reinforce both the comical and [...] "spooky" [...] elements of the plot, Blu-ray's Jeffrey Kauffman noted he [...] "remains something of a cipher throughout the series" [...] with the possibility of having the viewer relate with him.|$|E

500|$|Soderbergh {{decided to}} omit the post-revolution {{execution}} sentences of [...] "suspected war criminals, traitors and informants" [...] that Guevara reviewed at La Cabana Fortress because [...] "there is {{no amount of}} accumulated barbarity that would have satisfied the people who hate him". Soderbergh addressed the criticism for this omission in a post release interview where he stated: [...] "I don't think anybody now, even in Cuba, is going to sit with a <b>straight</b> <b>face</b> and defend the events. La Cabana was really turned into a Roman circus, where I think even the people in power look back on that as excessive. However, every regime, in order to retain power when it feels threatened, acts excessively ... This is what people do when they feel they need to act in an extreme way to secure themselves". The filmmaker noted as well that, [...] "with a character this complicated, you’re {{going to have a}} very polarized reaction". Furthermore, he was not interested in depicting Guevara's life as [...] "a bureaucrat", stating that he was making a diptych about two military campaigns, declaring the pictures [...] "war films". Soderbergh said, [...] "I'm sure some people will say, 'That's convenient because that's when he was at his worst.' Yeah, maybe—it just wasn't interesting to me. I was interested in making a procedural about guerrilla warfare".|$|E
500|$|Rashad {{has also}} {{garnered}} critical acclaim for her performance. Writing for AARP, Allan Fallow wrote that Rashad charmed audiences [...] "with her wholesome brand of comedy." [...] Robert Weintraub of The New York Times hailed Rashad as [...] "America’s mom, dispensing tough {{love with a}} <b>straight</b> <b>face</b> opposite Cosby’s comic mugging". Jason Bailey of Slate wrote that Rashad portrayed her character [...] "majestically", while The Huffington Posts Mlsee Harris praised the actress for playing Clair [...] "with class and poise from 1984 through 1992." [...] Writing for the same publication, Jennifer Armstrong dubbed Rashad [...] "a great ranter". Nick Hartel of DVD Talk reviewed that she [...] "perfectly ... captures {{some of his best}} caricatures of [...] own wife, Camille." [...] However, Time television critic Richard Zoglin criticized the actress for being [...] "too young by a decade". Rashad has won numerous awards and accolades for her performance over the course of two decades, including two Primetime Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series. Although she never won, Randee Dawn of Today felt that Rashad's performances during the show's first and last seasons were most deserving. Dawn elaborated, [...] "While it seems hard to imagine today, in 1984, finding a tough-minded, super smart, middle-class black woman on TV was all but unheard of, much less finding one who could contend with and occasionally upstage a legendary comedian." [...] Following her 1986 nomination, Rashad would remain the last African American actress to be nominated for an Emmy Award in that particular category for 30 years, until 2016. At the 15th People's Choice Awards in 1989, Rashad won in the category of Favorite Female TV Performer. Rashad also won two NAACP Image Awards. Former South African President Nelson Mandela once personally thanked Rashad for her contributions to The Cosby Show, which he claimed to have watched while imprisoned on Robben Island.|$|E

At this time, Stewart {{was asked to}} leave the band. He was replaced soon after by Damon Beard, who had been playing with Polentz and Louis in Adverse Reality. <b>Straight</b> <b>Faced</b> recorded their first full length, Guilty, and released it with Lethal Records, but {{due to the lack}} of a signed contract, quickly took the recording to Bob Becker to release on Fearless.

[...] Huddleston criticized Cage's {{performance}} but praised Perlman's. The critic concluded, [...] "Season of the Witch is not for everyone: it’s creaky, predictable and frequently idiotic.

2500|$|Although {{variable}} in color from blond to nearly black, grizzly bear fur is typically brown with darker legs and commonly white or blond tipped fur on the flank and back. A pronounced hump appears on their shoulders; the hump {{is a good}} way to distinguish a grizzly bear from a black bear, as black bears do not have this hump. Aside from the distinguishing hump a grizzly bear can be identified by a [...] "dished in" [...] profile of their face with short, rounded ears, whereas a black bear has a <b>straight</b> <b>face</b> profile and longer ears. A grizzly bear can also be identified by its rump, which is lower than its shoulders, while a black bear's rump is higher.

[...] "The movement is a veneer over a certain theological message.
