5000|$|Many of {{his songs}} {{contained}} themes with a bizarre, morbid or sexual twist in them. An early success, [...] "Le Poinçonneur des Lilas", describes {{the day in the}} life of a Paris Métro ticket man, whose job is to <b>stamp</b> <b>holes</b> in passengers' tickets. Gainsbourg describes this chore as so monotonous, that the man eventually thinks of putting a hole into his own head and being buried in another.|$|R
40|$|Plate fin-and-tube heat {{exchangers}} {{are made by}} inserting oval tubes through sheet metal strips with <b>stamped</b> <b>holes</b> and then expanding the tubes slightly to cause pressure at the tube-to-strip contacts. The gap between the fin base and the outer tube surface may be filled with air or corrosion products causing {{a decline in the}} ability of plate fins to transfer heat. The contact resistance must be accounted for in the design and performance calculations of {{heat exchangers}}. In this paper, the thermal contact resistance of the fin-to-tube attachment is estimated from the condition that the dimensionless correlations for the Colburn j-factors obtained from two different methods are in good agreement. The first method is based on the experimental data, while the second one on the CFD simulation of the flow and heat transfer in the heat exchanger...|$|R
2500|$|A bit used {{to enlarge}} an {{existing}} hole {{is called a}} core drill bit. The existing hole {{may be the result}} of a core from a casting or a <b>stamped</b> (punched) <b>hole.</b> [...] The name comes from its first use, for drilling out the hole left by a foundry core, a cylinder placed in a mould for a casting that leaves an irregular hole in the product. This core drill bit is solid.|$|R

5000|$|At {{this stage}} in the process all the metal parts {{that make up the}} fuel tank are cut to shape, <b>stamped</b> with <b>holes</b> and are flat {{according}} to a pattern, ready to be shaped three-dimensionally.Next, the heads which are {{often referred to as the}} [...] "end caps" [...] are formed in a die using a stamping press. This applies to all fuel tanks regardless of shape - D-Tanks, cylindrical or rectangular. The [...] "body" [...] of the diesel tank is then formed to fit around the heads. Cylindrical tanks are rolled in a roll forming machine while non-cylindrical tanks are bent on a press brake.|$|R
50|$|Additive {{manufacturing}} of keysUnlike most ordinary keys {{which were}} produced by key blank <b>stamping</b> and subsequent <b>hole</b> drilling, the Stealth key is a mechanical key made by additive manufacturing (3D metal printed). It {{was a major}} disruption to the key manufacturing status quo and took {{full advantage of the}} novel manufacturing process, i.e. complex internal features and a batch size of one (each single key in the printed batch is unique).|$|R

50|$|The M1935 {{design was}} {{slightly}} modified in 1940 to simplify its construction, {{the manufacturing process}} now incorporating more automated stamping methods. The principal change was to <b>stamp</b> the ventilator <b>hole</b> mounts directly onto the shell, rather than utilizing separate fittings. In other respects, the M1940 helmet was identical to the M1935. The Germans still referred to the M1940 as the M1935, while the M1940 designation were given by collectors.|$|R
50|$|The Austrian Bundesheer {{utilized}} {{a single}} long, rectangular tag, with oval ends, stamped with blood group & Rh factor at the end, with ID number underneath. Two slots and a <b>hole</b> <b>stamped</b> beneath the nunicew the tag {{to be broken}} in half, and the long bottom portion has both the ID number {{and a series of}} holes which allows the tag to be inserted into a dosimeter. This has been replaced with a more conventional, wider and rounded rectangle which can still be halved, but lacks the dosimeter reading holes.|$|R
5000|$|Sometimes steps may {{be taken}} to ensure that {{certified}} funds cannot easily be forged. These steps can include various unique <b>stamps,</b> inks and <b>hole</b> punchers, {{as well as the}} assistance of a machine such as a protectograph. Unfortunately these steps cannot prevent someone from erasing the payee's name and writing in their own name. Fraud is specifically not reimbursed by many issuer's of money orders (e.g. Western Union), and so has to go through local police. The perpetrator can then claim [...] "identity theft" [...] to the investigating detective. Such money orders can be obtained from places like rent-drop boxes.|$|R
50|$|Nissan New Zealand {{assembled}} several {{versions of}} the Bluebird 910. These were shipped in CKD from Japan, including a top ZX model that was the first, and only, car to be assembled {{in the country with}} electrically adjustable Japanese domestic style 'hockey stick' rear view mirrors on the front guards (which had to be sent out after kit unpacking for a local specialist to <b>stamp</b> the mounting <b>holes).</b> NZ cars initially had the two-tone brown interior; this was switched to grey at the mid-life facelift when the top model's power exterior mirrors were relocated to the door mounting now universal today. Japan itself eventually phased out the mandatory wing-mount mirrors that also distinguished thousands of used cars imported from Japan into NZ in the late 1980s and early 90s.|$|R
5000|$|The disc wheels, 4" [...] wide by 18" [...] diameter, are {{described}} as [...] "motorcycle type". The earliest trailers had two tie-down <b>holes</b> <b>stamped</b> in a recess {{on either side of}} the wheel hub, visible in one of the images used here. Later plain wheels sometimes had a single hole cut in a corresponding place in each wheel centre, or a welded-on loop, and the post war Regent production had a different style entirely with more of a lattice section towards the outside of the centre disc. This variation can be attributed to manufacturers using whatever wheels were available at time of production, but all wheels appeared to have been made or altered to be able to be secured by hole(s) or loop. The wheels appear to be subject to more corrosion and damage than the rest of the trailer, and are a particular problem for current restorers.|$|R
5000|$|The frame has vents on {{the upper}} and lower edge. The upper vents were {{produced}} in two patterns. One using a small brass tube with the inward open end faced slightly forward along the top edge of the frame. The other with a lower profile design that consists of a stamped and soldered channel, curved along the upper edge of the frame with two milled openings, one facing forward and one downward. The frame's lower edge vents are three depressions or three sets of small holes on the flat area of the underside. The two-piece milled bridge acts as a hinge and the larger midsection of the hinge is stamped 'AN 6530'. The manufacturer's identification / inscription can usually be found stamped on the left half of the frame's underside of the Charles Fischer Spring Co. goggles. The American Optical goggles are not identified. Regarding the vents, many collectors believe the tube-type were [...] "early" [...] design and the streamlined vents were [...] "later design". If this is so, why do we see the [...] "later" [...] vents on some forerunner, B-7 goggles? Truth is, both tube-type and streamline-type vents were being produced at the same time! The difference was, Charles Fischer was using his patented streamlined vents in the construction of his B-7s, Navy Mk-II and AN-6530s, while American Optical was using their own tubular design. You can always distinguish a Charles Fischer Spring goggle from an American Optical-made goggle at first glance simply by looking at the vent design. Also on the lower vents, AO used small round pinholes, while Charles Fischer used triangular-shaped <b>stamped</b> vent <b>holes.</b> No such thing as [...] "early tube-type" [...] or [...] "later streamlined vent-type". Both styles were being made at the same time.|$|R
40|$|International audienceMicro and nano-patterned {{surfaces}} {{are important for}} many applications ranging from antibiofouling over tissue engineering to electronics. Often the incorporation of functional entities is of interest. Polymer coatings especially polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) films and patterns are materials offering a large variety of tuning and engineering. The PEM pattern printing quality bases {{not only on the}} surface force balance but also in the way the PEM is softened, which can be done by printing the PEM in water, using an ultrasound humidifier or by exposing the film to (hot) water vapor. In this publication it is shown, that cold water vapor from an ultrasound humidifier or direct printing in water is superior to steam evaporation onto PEM thin films as humidification method. In addition the capillary pressure of the patterns within the stamp and the glass–viscous flow transition point of the PEM thin film are the significant parameters for PEM printing. This is because the PEM can surpass the glass–viscous flow transition point due to the shear forces and be sucked into the <b>stamp</b> microwells (or <b>holes)</b> preventing a structure replication. Under high temperatures and in aqueous conditions, the PEM can be expelled from the microwells due to the osmotic pressure produced by the counter ions of PEM in glass–viscous flow state and dissolving polyelectrolyte if a PEM with counter ion based charge balance is used...|$|R
