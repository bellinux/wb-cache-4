The “Key Standards ” approach was implemented in 2000, greatly reducing the number of topics and allowing students to focus on the core curriculum, including a strong pre-algebra component. A set of schools from low income and/or minority districts aggressively adopted and started to implement these new California methods for the 1998 - 1999 school year. Most of the “early adoption ” group of elementary schools purchased and began using matching textbooks when they first became available for the 1999 - 2000 school year, and all were using them by the following year.

40|$|Introduction In {{an effort}} to assist cattle {{producers}} in Oklahoma and Texas judge forage crop performance, a trial was held to determine forage yield of commercially available varieties and advanced experimental lines of annual ryegrass. The objective of this report is to summarize results from the 2008 trial. Materials and Methods The trial was conducted on a Wilson silt loam at the Noble Foundation Headquarters Farm near Ardmore, Okla. The trial consisted of 25 entries contributed from seven sources (Table 1). The entries were seeded in a clean-tilled seedbed on Sept. 17, 2007. Each entry was drilled in 5 - by 15 -foot plots, in 7 -inch rows, at 25 lb/acre (pure live seed basis) at a ½-inch planting depth with a HEGE 500 drill. Fertilization consisted of preplant incorporation of 23 lb P 205 /acre and 20 lb K 2 O/acre on Sept. 13, 2007. Plots were topdressed with 80 lb N/acre on Oct. 29, 2007, and Feb. 4, 2008. Plots were harvested with a HEGE sickle bar forage plot harvester at a 3 -inch height on Jan. 4, March 14, March 31, April 29 and June 3, 2008. The trial was a randomized complete block design with three replications. Data were analyzed with the general linear models procedure in SAS (Statistical Analysis Software, Cary, N. C.), and means were separated by the least significant difference (LSD) method (P ≤ 0. 05). Results and Discussion Precipitation was below the 30 -year average for Ardmore (Table 2). The deficit occurred primarily during the fall, limiting fall forage production. Good precipitation during the spring allowed for good spring forage production. Consequently, yields on average were 1000 lb/acre greater than average yield of entries in the 2007 trial. by J. A. Guretzky / jaguretzky@noble. org, and S. Norton / slnorton@noble. org Forage yield depended on the harvest date and entry (Table 3). Entries that stood out for producing the most forage during early spring, more than 4000 lb/acre by April 1, included Attain, Big Boss, Diamond T, Ed, Fantastic, Flying A, ME 4, ME 94, Surrey II, TXR 2006 -T 22 and WD- 40. Ed, ME 4, ME 94 and WD- 40 also produced good forage yields during this <b>same</b> time <b>period</b> <b>last</b> <b>year.</b> Entries that stood out for producing more forage during late spring (April 29 harvest) included AM- 4 T, Attain, Barextra, Big Boss, Florida 4 N, Hercules, ISI-LWD 4, Jumbo, Marshall, MO 1, Surrey II, Tam TBO, TXR 2006 -T 22 and Verdure (Table 3). When forage yield was examined over the whole season, differences among entries were mostly not significant. Forage yield among the top entries ranged from 6079 to 7420 lb/acre (Table 3).
