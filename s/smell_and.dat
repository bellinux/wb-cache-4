5|$|Pholiota flammans fruit bodies bear no {{distinctive}} <b>smell</b> <b>and</b> taste mild {{to slightly}} bitter. Opinions are divided {{as to its}} edibility, however, as some authors regard the mushroom as inedible, while others consider it edible or of unknown edibility.|$|E
5|$|Although {{each type}} of tea has {{different}} taste, <b>smell,</b> <b>and</b> visual appearance, tea processing for all tea types consists of a very similar set of methods with only minor variations. Without careful moisture and temperature control during its manufacture and life thereafter, fungi will grow on tea. This form of fungus causes real fermentation that will contaminate the tea and may render the tea unfit for consumption.|$|E

It {{may be considered}} the conjugate acid of the azide anion, and is similarly analogous to the hydrohalic acids.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. To better support {{software}} maintenance and evolution, {{it is important}} to evaluate the quality of a system, identifying defects, code <b>smells</b> <b>and</b> anti patterns as hints pointing to subsystems that require improvement. In this paper we analyze the possible dependencies ex-isting among code <b>smells</b> <b>and</b> between code <b>smells</b> <b>and</b> micro patterns – structural characteristics capturing common programming techniques. Knowledge of possible relations could improve the detection techniques of code <b>smells</b> <b>and</b> provide hints on how {{to improve the quality of}} a sys-tem. We discover these relations in an experiment employing machine learning techniques. Key words: source code quality evaluation, micro patterns, code smell detection...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Software Inspection is used {{to enhance}} {{software}} quality by detecting and removing software defects that mar software quality. Software design defects are design flaws which might not stop application from working but will hamper the process of extension and reuse of application. Software design defects manifest themselves {{in the form of}} AntiPatterns <b>and</b> Code <b>Smells.</b> In Software Inspection, we can detect Code <b>Smells</b> <b>and</b> Anti Patterns by using visualization or metrics based solution. But, currently there is no process that defines the steps to detect Code <b>Smells</b> <b>and</b> Anti Patterns by using Rule Based Checklist. In this paper, we propose Process-based Detection of Code <b>Smells</b> <b>and</b> Anti Patterns. We have defined Rule Set and Checklist for software design defects i. e. Code <b>Smells</b> <b>and</b> Anti Patterns and applied and validated the Rules set and Checklists on an industrial project...|$|R

5|$|The most {{recognizable}} symptoms in Parkinson's disease are movement ("motor") related. Non-motor symptoms, which include autonomic dysfunction, neuropsychiatric problems (mood, cognition, behavior or thought alterations), and sensory (especially altered sense of <b>smell)</b> <b>and</b> sleep difficulties, are also common. Some of these non-motor symptoms {{may be present}} {{at the time of}} diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|The {{shape of}} the nasal {{chambers}} of Ankylosaurus indicate that airflow was unidirectional, (looping through the lungs during inhalation and exhalation), although it {{may also have been}} bidirectional in the posterior nasal chamber, which directed air past the olfactory lobes. The enlarged olfactory region of ankylosaurids indicates a well-developed sense of <b>smell,</b> <b>and</b> the position of the orbits of Ankylosaurus suggest some stereoscopic vision.|$|E

5|$|For {{the first}} few days, the newborn is {{unsteady}} on its feet, and needs the support of its mother. It relies on touch, <b>smell,</b> <b>and</b> hearing, as its eyesight is poor. It has little precise control over its trunk, which wiggles around and may cause it to trip. By its second week of life, the calf can walk more firmly and has more control over its trunk. After its first month, a calf can pick up, hold, and put objects in its mouth, but cannot suck water through the trunk and must drink directly through the mouth. It is still dependent on its mother and keeps close to her.|$|E
5|$|Inocybe maculata {{is similar}} to the {{variable}} Inocybe lacera, the split fibrecap, but it can be differentiated by the darker colouration of the cap, and the white remains of the veil in the centre of the cap. The species is also similar in appearance to Inocybe lanatodisca, but can be readily distinguished by odour (I.lanatodisca has a characteristic sweet, green-corn <b>smell)</b> <b>and</b> the colour of the cap (I.lanatodisca has a fulvous cap). It is closely related to Inocybe fastigiata, but can again be distinguished by colour; I.fastigiata has lighter coloured fibrils.|$|E

40|$|Some {{previous}} work began studying {{the relationship between}} application domains and quality, in particular through the prevalence of code <b>and</b> design <b>smells</b> (e. g., anti-patterns). Indeed, it is generally believed {{that the presence of}} these smells degrades quality but also that their prevalence varies across domains. Though anecdotal experiences and empirical evidence gathered from developers and researchers support this belief, there is still a need to further deepen our understanding of the relationship between application domains and quality. Consequently, we present a large-scale study that investigated the systematic relationships between the presence of <b>smells</b> <b>and</b> quality-related metrics computed over the bytecode of 1, 343 Java Mobile Edition applications in 13 different application domains. Although, we did not find evidence of a correlation between <b>smells</b> <b>and</b> quality-related metrics, we found (1) that larger differences exist between metric values of classes exhibiting <b>smells</b> <b>and</b> classes without <b>smells</b> <b>and</b> (2) that some smells are commonly present in all the domains while others are most prevalent in certain domains...|$|R
5|$|Manganism is a biphasic disorder. In {{its early}} stages, an {{intoxicated}} person may experience depression, mood swings, compulsive behaviors, and psychosis. Early neurological symptoms {{give way to}} late-stage manganism, which resembles Parkinson's disease. Symptoms include weakness, monotone and slowed speech, an expressionless face, tremor, forward-leaning gait, inability to walk backwards without falling, rigidity, and general problems with dexterity, gait and balance. Unlike Parkinson's disease, manganism is not associated with loss of <b>smell</b> <b>and</b> patients are typically unresponsive to treatment with L-DOPA. Symptoms of late-stage manganism become more severe over time even if the source of exposure is removed and brain manganese levels return to normal.|$|E
5|$|The Beagle is a {{breed of}} small hound {{that is similar}} in {{appearance}} to the much larger foxhound. The beagle is a scent hound, developed primarily for hunting hare. With {{a great sense of}} <b>smell</b> <b>and</b> superior tracking instinct, the beagle is employed as detection dog for prohibited agricultural imports and foodstuffs in quarantine around the world. The beagle is intelligent but single-minded. It is a popular pet due to its size, good temper, and lack of inherited health problems.|$|E
5|$|The Ichneumonidae are {{specialized}} parasitoids, {{often of}} Lepidoptera larvae deeply buried in plant tissues, {{which may be}} woody. For this purpose, they have exceptionally long ovipositors; they detect their hosts by <b>smell</b> <b>and</b> vibration. Some of the largest species, including Rhyssa persuasoria and Megarhyssa macrurus, parasitise horntails, large sawflies whose adult females also have impressively long ovipositors. Some parasitic species have a mutualistic relationship with a polydnavirus that weakens the host's immune system and replicates in the oviduct of the female wasp.|$|E

5|$|The spiny scallop {{lives on}} the seabed in the sublittoral zone between low tide mark and a depth of , on soft {{sediment}} or on rock, particularly in areas with a strong current. It is a filter feeder, sieving microscopic algae from water that passes through its gills. It is preyed on by starfish, octopuses and sea otters. It can detect predators by <b>smell</b> <b>and</b> by sight and can swim away from them by opening and closing its valves. Other organisms often grow on the exterior of its shell and it often forms a symbiotic relationship with an encrusting sponge which grows on the upper valve and helps protect it from predators.|$|E
5|$|After drying, the {{harvested}} stems or rhizomes were steamed for 24 {{hours or}} more in the umu tī pit. Steaming converted the carbohydrate fructan in the stems to very sweet fructose. The cooked stems or rhizomes were then ﬂattened by beating and carried back to villages for storage. Kāuru could be stored dry until {{the time came to}} add it to fern root and other foods to improve their palatability. The sugar in the stems or rhizomes would be partially crystallised, and could be found mixed in a sugary pulp with other matter between the fibres of the root, which were easily separated by tearing them apart. Kāuru could also be dipped in water and chewed, and was said to <b>smell</b> <b>and</b> taste like molasses.|$|E
5|$|Domestic cats select food {{based on}} its temperature, <b>smell</b> <b>and</b> texture; they dislike chilled foods and respond most {{strongly}} to moist foods rich in amino acids, which are similar to meat. Cats may reject novel flavors (a response termed neophobia) and learn quickly to avoid foods that have tasted unpleasant in the past. They may also avoid sugary foods and milk. Most adult cats are lactose intolerant; the sugars in milk are not easily digested and may cause soft stools or diarrhea. They can also develop odd eating habits. Some cats like to eat or chew on other things, most commonly wool, but also plastic, cables, paper, string, aluminum foil, or even coal. This condition, pica, can threaten their health, depending on the amount and toxicity of the items eaten.|$|E

5|$|Elephants have a fission–fusion {{society in}} which {{multiple}} family groups come together to socialise. Males ("bulls") leave their family groups when they reach puberty and may live alone or with other males. Adult bulls mostly interact with family groups when looking for a mate and enter a state of increased testosterone and aggression known as musth, which helps them gain dominance and reproductive success. Calves are the centre of attention in their family groups and rely on their mothers {{for as long as}} three years. Elephants can live up to 70 years in the wild. They communicate by touch, sight, <b>smell,</b> <b>and</b> sound; elephants use infrasound, and seismic communication over long distances. Elephant intelligence has been compared with that of primates and cetaceans. They appear to have self-awareness and show empathy for dying or dead individuals of their kind.|$|E
5|$|In {{humans and}} many other mammals, new neurons are created mainly before birth, and the infant brain {{contains}} substantially more neurons than the adult brain. There are, however, a few areas where new neurons continue to be generated throughout life. The two areas for which adult neurogenesis is well established are the olfactory bulb, which {{is involved in the}} sense of <b>smell,</b> <b>and</b> the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, where there is evidence that the new neurons play a role in storing newly acquired memories. With these exceptions, however, the set of neurons that is present in early childhood is the set that is present for life. Glial cells are different: as with most types of cells in the body, they are generated throughout the lifespan.|$|E
5|$|Like other insects, flies have chemoreceptors that detect <b>smell</b> <b>and</b> taste, and mechanoreceptors that {{respond to}} touch. The third {{segments}} of the antennae and the maxillary palps bear the main olfactory receptors, while the gustatory receptors are in the labium, pharynx, feet, wing margins and female genitalia, enabling flies to taste their food by walking on it. The taste receptors in females {{at the tip of}} the abdomen receive information on the suitability of a site for ovipositing. Flies that feed on blood have special sensory structures that can detect infrared emissions, and use them to home in on their hosts, and many blood-sucking flies can detect the raised concentration of carbon dioxide that occurs near large animals. Some tachinid flies (Ormiinae) which are parasitoids of bush crickets, have sound receptors to help them locate their singing hosts.|$|E
