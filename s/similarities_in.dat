40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} {{the role of}} <b>similarity</b> <b>in</b> music preferences in the formation and discontinuation of friendships over a one-year period. Questionnaire data were gathered from 283 Dutch same-sex mutual best friends (Mean age = 12. 97) in two waves with a one-year interval. Results show consistent evidence for high <b>similarity</b> <b>in</b> specific music dimensions among friends at both waves. Moderate <b>similarity</b> was found <b>in</b> the overall patterning of preferences for music genres at both waves, even after controlling for <b>similarity</b> <b>in</b> social background. Girls {{were found to be}} more similar in their preference for Rock than boys. Specific music <b>similarity</b> <b>in</b> more non-mainstream music dimensions and overall music similarity at Wave 1 were related to selecting a new friend at Wave 2. However, <b>similarity</b> <b>in</b> music preferences was not related to the discontinuation of an existing friendship at Wave 2. Thus, results suggest that <b>similarity</b> <b>in</b> music preferences is related to friendship formation, and not to friendship discontinuation...|$|R
40|$|Using a {{representative}} sample of Belgian adolescents (N= 1, 530) and both their parents, we investigated the parent-child <b>similarity</b> <b>in</b> prejudice toward different outgroups and ideological attitudes (right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation). Contrary to previous studies, we distinguished between common and specific components of prejudice to test whether the parent-child <b>similarity</b> <b>in</b> one specific type of prejudice was symptomatic of parent-child <b>similarity</b> <b>in</b> prejudice toward outgroups in general. Second, we evaluated whether the parent-child <b>similarity</b> <b>in</b> common and specific components of prejudice was related to the parent-child <b>similarity</b> <b>in</b> ideological attitudes. Third, we investigated the moderating role of political discussion in the intergenerational framework of ideology and prejudice. Results indicated that parent-child similarity was particularly pronounced for the common rather than the specific component of prejudice and that the <b>similarity</b> <b>in</b> ideological attitudes was partly related to the <b>similarity</b> <b>in</b> the common component of prejudice. Finally, adolescents who discuss social and political issues more (vs less) frequently with their parents, more strongly resembled their parents in the common component of prejudice and levels of authoritarianism. These results suggest that generalized prejudice runs in families and highlight politicization of the family as an important socialization mechanism. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Spousal <b>similarity</b> <b>in</b> life {{satisfaction}} {{is important for}} causal theories of life satis-faction. This study examined the concurrent and cross-lagged spousal <b>similarity</b> <b>in</b> {{life satisfaction}} over a 21 -year period based on 847 married couples in the German Socio-Economic Panel. Concurrent spousal similarity (e. g., husband 1990 & wife 1990) was considerably higher than one-year lagged similarity (e. g., husband 1990 & wife 1991). This finding reveals spousal <b>similarity</b> <b>in</b> the variable component of life satisfaction that fluctuates from year to year. In addition, cross-lagged spousal similarity systematically decreased with length of the time lag. This finding reveals spousal <b>similarity</b> <b>in</b> the changing component of life satisfaction. Finally, there was considerable cross-lagged spousal similarity over the longest time lag (e. g., husband 1984 & wife 2004). This finding reveals spousal <b>similarity</b> <b>in</b> the stable component of life satisfaction.

5|$|A {{striking}} {{feature of}} metabolism is {{the similarity of}} the basic metabolic pathways and components between even vastly different species.

These striking <b>similarities</b> <b>in</b> metabolic pathways are likely due to their early appearance in evolutionary history, and their retention because of their efficacy.|$|E
5|$|Because of <b>similarities</b> <b>in</b> {{morphology}} and lifestyle, the slime molds (mycetozoans, plasmodiophorids, acrasids, Fonticula and labyrinthulids, now in Amoebozoa, Rhizaria, Excavata, Opisthokonta and Stramenopiles, respectively), water molds (oomycetes) and hyphochytrids (both Stramenopiles) were formerly classified in {{the kingdom}} Fungi, in groups like Mastigomycotina, Gymnomycota and Phycomycetes. The slime molds were studied also as protozoans, leading to a ambiregnal, duplicated taxonomy.|$|E
5|$|Berkelium is a soft, silvery-white, {{radioactive}} actinide metal.

Its density of 14.78g/cm3 lies between those of curium (13.52g/cm3) and californium (15.1g/cm3), as does its melting point of 986°C, below that of curium (1340°C) but higher than that of californium (900°C). Berkelium is relatively soft and has one of the lowest bulk moduli among the actinides, at about 20 GPa (2Pa).|$|E

40|$|Dyadic latent panel {{analysis}} (DLPA) {{was applied}} to eight waves of the Panel Study of Belgium Households (N = 954 couples).

Total observed similarity between members of a dyad on one occasion is decomposed into stable <b>similarity,</b> <b>similarity</b> <b>in</b> factors that change over time, and occasion-specific similarity. The results show that depressive symptoms are influenced by stable and changing factors and that spousal <b>similarity</b> <b>in</b> both factors contribute to spousal <b>similarity</b> <b>in</b> depression on a single occasion.

However, Ostrom's study of 1978 has disproven this. Jens Zinke in 1998 assigned forty-nine teeth from the Kimmeridgian Guimarota formation of Portugal to the genus.

5|$|Experts {{disagree}} {{over whether}} temnospondyls were ancestral to modern amphibians (frogs, salamanders, and caecilians), {{or whether the}} whole group died out without leaving any descendants. Different hypotheses have placed modern amphibians as the descendants of temnospondyls, another group of early tetrapods called lepospondyls, or even as descendants of both groups (with caecilians evolving from lepospondyls and frogs and salamanders evolving from temnospondyls). Recent studies place a family of temnospondyls called the amphibamids as the closest relatives of modern amphibians. <b>Similarities</b> <b>in</b> teeth, skulls, and hearing structures link the two groups.|$|E

40|$|Bipartite data {{is common}} in data {{engineering}} and brings unique challenges, {{particularly when it comes}} to clustering tasks that impose strong structural assumptions. This work presents an unsupervised method for assessing <b>similarity</b> <b>in</b> bipartite data.

The method is reflexive <b>in</b> that <b>similarity</b> <b>in</b> one dimension informs <b>similarity</b> <b>in</b> the other. The method also uses local graph transitivities, a contribution governed by its only free parameter. Reflexive regular equivalence can be used to validate assumptions of co-similarity, which are required but often untested in co-clustering analyses. The method is robust to noise and asymmetric data, making it particularly suited for cluster analysis and recommendation in data of unknown structure...|$|R

Since the Rodrigues and Mauritius starlings seem morphologically closer to each other than to the hoopoe starling—which appears closer to Southeast Asian starlings—there may have been two separate migrations of starlings from Asia to the Mascarenes, with the hoopoe starling the latest arrival. Except for Madagascar, the Mascarenes were the only islands in the southwestern Indian Ocean with native starlings, probably due to their isolation, varied topography, and vegetation.|$|E
