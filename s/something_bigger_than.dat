In December 2004, he was elected Commander of his local POW chapter, the Tidewater ex-POW Association. In 2008, he was also serving as the head of a Virginia state ex–POW association. Coker and his wife are also active in church and civic activities, such as counseling young married couples. Coker still has nightmares from his time as a POW. Reflecting on his wartime experiences in a Veterans Day tribute to POWs, he said [...] "If you're never tested, you don't know...You're capable of a great deal more than you realize, if you really set your mind to it. Look at me. I did it, and there's nothing special about me. I'm just another guy." [...] Coker went on to say part of that is [...] "...realizing there's <b>something</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> yourself..." ...|$|E
500|$|Miley: The Movement commences with Cyrus stating [...] "I don't {{apologize}} for anything." [...] Shortly after, she comments that [...] "For me, the movement {{needs to be}} <b>something</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> just a record. For me, a movement is something that represents, like, taking over the world." [...] Cyrus notably avoids specifically naming her former television series Hannah Montana, instead calling it [...] "my show" [...] when flashback pictures of her earlier career was shown, presumably to distance herself from the franchise. However, she commented that after its conclusion [...] "I made one movie, and I never {{wanted to do it}} again. I want to make music {{for the rest of my}} life." [...] Having been filmed after Bangerz was recorded, the documentary instead depicts Cyrus finalizing details including its album artwork and track listing. A brief discussion in a recording studio with Britney Spears, who is featured on the track [...] "SMS (Bangerz)" [...] is additionally included.|$|E
500|$|... "Good Enough" [...] is a {{moderately}} slow piano ballad {{with a happy}} theme. According to the sheet music published on the website Musicnotes.com by Alfred Music Publishing, the song is in a common time and performed in moderately slow tempo of 92 beats per minute. [...] "Good Enough" [...] is written in the key of F minor, while Lee's vocals for the song range from the musical note of G3 to the note of E5. The song contains strings, piano and Amy Lee's vocals as the main instrumentation. In [...] "Good Enough", Lee [...] "talks about the rapturous hold of <b>something</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> herself" [...] in the text [...] "Shouldn't have let you torture me so sweetly … / Shouldn't have let you conquer me completely / Now I can't let go of this dream / Can't believe that I feel / Good enough for you." [...] In the song she also sings the lines [...] "I'm {{still waiting for the}} rain to fall. Pour down real life on me/Cause I can't hold onto anything this good enough/Am I good enough/For you to love me too?".|$|E

500|$|... "Can't Get You Out of My Head" [...] is a [...] "robotic" [...] midtempo dance-pop song, with a {{tempo of}} 126 beats per minute. According to the sheet music {{published}} at Musicnotes.com by EMI Music Publishing, {{the song is}} written in the key of C major, with Minogue's vocal range spanning from C4 to D5. Minogue chants a [...] "la la la" [...] hook in the song, which is often heralded as its most appealing part. BBC Radio 2 noted that {{the composition of the}} song is [...] "deceptively simple, but its veins run with the whole history of electronic music." [...] They described the song's bassline as [...] "pulsing," [...] and recognised influences of English rock band New Order and German electronic music band Kraftwerk. The song does not follow the common verse-chorus structure and is instead composed of numerous [...] "misplaced sections." [...] Dennis reasoned that these sections [...] "somehow work together" [...] as she and Davis [...] "didn't try to force any structure after the event. The seeds were watered and they very quickly sprouted into <b>something</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> any of us." [...] Likewise, Davis commented: [...] "It breaks a few rules as it starts with a chorus and in comes the 'la's'– that is what confused my publisher [...] when he first heard it." ...|$|E
500|$|A dance {{version of}} the song, mixed with {{fragments}} of the dance track [...] "Feels Like Home" [...] by Meck, was performed in the 2008–09 Sticky & Sweet Tour {{as part of the}} rave segment. In the rave segment, Madonna appeared wearing a breastplate and a short wig. She danced energetically around the whole stage as backup singer Nicki Richards provided vocals during the intermediate solo. Screens displayed a message of equality of religions, as symbols and texts from different scriptures flashed by, including messages from the Bible, Qur'an, Torah and Talmud. Helen Brown from The Daily Telegraph declared the performance as {{one of the highlights of}} the tour, while Joey Guerra from Houston Chronicle compared Madonna rising on a platform with that of a superhero. The performance was included both in the CD and DVD of the live release of the tour, titled Sticky & Sweet Tour, filmed in Buenos Aires, Argentina from December 4–7, 2008. In January 2010, Madonna performed an acoustic {{version of the}} song live during the [...] telethon. Jon Caramanica of The New York Times commented: [...] "For 20 years, that song has been the symbol of one of the most tumultuous and controversial periods in Madonna's life. But for five minutes tonight, it was pure, put in service of <b>something</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> the singer." ...|$|E
500|$|Carl Swanson of New York {{magazine}} was {{amazed by the}} ArtRave, from the Volantis display to the actual party area, and added that [...] " [...] event, mostly staged for Gaga's cameras {{as well as those}} of the feverishly Instagramming guests, was surprisingly well organized for something so manifestly difficult. The idea was clearly to be in control of it." [...] However, he noticed a bit of [...] "vulnerability" [...] in Gaga as she performed onstage. Swanson relegated Gaga's lectures about Koons and their collaboration as [...] "borderline gibberish", adding that: [...] "It's less of a collaboration than a feeling that she is searching to attach herself to <b>something</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> herself, something less evanescent than pop, or maybe just something to contain herself before she flames out completely, like a hashtag in the wind." [...] Kia Makarechi of The Huffington Post was critical of the set up when Gaga had to wade through a crowd to reach the stage, but wrote that [...] "nce Gaga took the stage, however, all was nearly forgotten. The singer worked through the new album with an impressive commitment to weirdness." [...] Nick Murray of Spin magazine criticized the [...] "underwhelming display" [...] of Volantis and found that Gaga's ideas about [...] "changing the world" [...] with the album and the technology were [...] "both dry and ridiculous, vaguely utopian but overly confident in the liberating power of technology, and just when the whole thing was beginning to seem more and more like a farce, [...] cannily explained that beyond whether the Volantis is ever mass-produced, 'the important thing is about the possibilities'." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It doesn't {{matter where}} I aim," [...] {{answered}} Bastin sturdily, [...] "or whether I hit or miss, {{since there is}} <b>something</b> much <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> me waiting to deal with you.

2500|$|With {{magnitudes}} {{the contrary}} holds. What is continuous is divided ad infinitum, {{but there is}} no infinite in the direction of increase. For the size which it can potentially be, it can also actually be.

2500|$|Founded in Greensboro, North Carolina in 2010, Crystal Bright & the Silver Hands {{take their}} name from a classic piece of {{folklore}} by The Brothers Grimm. [...] "There {{is a story}} called 'The Handless Maiden'," [...] Bright said, [...] "and it is about her losing her hands and gaining {{them back in the}} end, representing her coming into her full creative and soulful self, which I felt like I was doing then, and am still doing." [...] "I had written all these songs and I needed help in creating a band and taking my music to the next level. The Silver Hands help me create <b>something</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> my own hands could." ...|$|E
2500|$|By 1983, {{the members}} of Hüsker Dü wanted to create music outside of the {{confines}} and restrictions of hardcore. In an interview with Matter in 1983, Mould told interviewer Steve Albini, [...] "We're {{going to try to}} do <b>something</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> anything like rock & roll and the whole puny touring band idea. I don't know what it's going to be, we have to work that out, but it's going to go beyond the whole idea of 'punk rock' or whatever." [...] The following year, Hüsker Dü recorded the double album Zen Arcade in 45 hours for the cost of $3,200. Zen Arcade is a concept album following a boy who leaves home to face a harsh and unforgiving world. Its artistic and conceptual ambitions were a great stretch given the purist sentiment then prevalent in U.S. punk rock. Zen Arcade received critical praise and significant mainstream music press attention, ending up on several year-end best-of lists. It also helped expand the band's audience beyond the punk community. In his review for Rolling Stone, David Fricke described Zen Arcade as [...] "the closest hardcore will ever get to an opera ... a kind of thrash Quadrophenia." [...] In 1989, Zen Arcade was ranked No. 33 on Rolling Stones list of the 100 greatest albums of the 1980s. SST erred on the side of caution and initially pressed between 3,500 and 5,000 copies of the album, but the record sold out a few weeks into the band's tour in support of the record. The album remained out of stock for months afterward, which affected sales and frustrated the band.|$|E
5000|$|Generation X is the {{generation}} born after the Western post-World War II Baby Boomers between approximately 1965 and 1980. The term was noted by photographer Robert Capa {{in the early}} 1950s.

50|$|According to {{journalist}} Lecia Bushak {{writing in}} the 18 February 2014 issue of Newsweek magazine, EuroMaidan had grown into <b>something</b> far <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> just an angry response to the fallen-through EU deal. It's now about ousting Yanukovych and his corrupt government; guiding Ukraine away from its 200-year-long, deeply intertwined and painful relationship with Russia; and standing up for basic human rights to protest, speak and think freely and to act peacefully without the threat of punishment.|$|R

He also finds himself in an uneasy alliance with erstwhile foe Lane-Walsh, who turns out {{to be on the same}} undercover assignment for the rival firm. Eventually they discover Ryan is part of <b>something</b> far <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> corporate one-upmanship; nothing less than a vast conspiracy against the status quo among the lowly engineers whose ill-recompensed work underpins the companies' wealth.|$|R
5000|$|The Straits Times, Singapore's largest newspaper, in an {{editorial}} published on May 15, called on China to [...] "not ignore the balanced call made at the Asean Summit for all parties to refrain from taking actions that would escalate tensions further".

6000|$|The hooks were baited {{with pieces}} of meat and lowered, and the paddles laid in. Scarcely were the lines out when Godfrey felt a fierce tug. [...] "Hulloa!"

60|$|He {{seemed to}} have two pairs of hands and a head of cast-iron, for, not content with blowing through a big conch-shell, he must needs stand up to it, swaying with the sway of the {{flat-bottomed}} dory, and send a grinding, thuttering shriek through the fog. How long this entertainment lasted, Harvey could not remember, for he lay back terrified {{at the sight of}} the smoking swells. He fancied he heard a gun and a horn and shouting. <b>Something</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> the dory, but quite as lively, loomed alongside. Several voices talked at once; he was dropped into a dark, heaving hole, where men in oilskins gave him a hot drink and took off his clothes, and he fell asleep.|$|E

These objects are kind of short quotations from different places, ready to be reused, interpreted or sometimes misused. The exhibition explores the idea of how an incomplete could shape the complete. Taking place at No. 12 Breakfast Room and the Crypt area of Sir John Soane's Museum, each work presented is a suggestion or a proposition of how we might make sense of <b>something</b> <b>bigger</b> through <b>something</b> small, insignificant or fragmentary...|$|R

60|$|The captain, named Astley, was a jovial {{person who}} held {{every kind of}} certificate.

In this I believe I was right; otherwise a man of such attainments would have been commanding <b>something</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> a private yacht. The first mate, Jacobsen, was a melancholy Dane, a spiritualist who played the concertina, and seemed to be able to do without sleep. The crew were a mixed lot, good men for the most part and quite unobjectionable, more than half of them being Scandinavian. I think that is all I need say about the Star of the South.|$|E
60|$|And then my {{argument}} with Father Addis began all over again. It was {{easy enough to}} say that every man makes his own eyes: indeed the embryologists had actually caught him doing it. But what about the very evident purpose that prompted him to do it? Why did he want to see, if not to extend his consciousness and his knowledge and his power? That purpose was at work everywhere, and must be <b>something</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> the individual eye-making man. Only the stupidest muckrakers could fail to see this, and even to know it as part of their own consciousness. Yet to admit it seemed to involve letting the bogey come back, so inextricably had we managed to mix up belief in the bogey's existence with belief in the existence of design in the universe.|$|E

The whole second story was a large unfinished room littered with piles of folding chairs, a lime-crusted mortar-mixing box, and the skeletons of Fourth of July floats covered with decomposing plaster shields and faded red, white, and blue bunting. At the end was an abortive stage. The room was large enough for the community dances which Mrs. Nat Hicks advocated. But Carol was after <b>something</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> dances.|$|E
