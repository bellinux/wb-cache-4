Yaron commented, [...] " [...] it was so intense and [...] was crying and she was really in it and I felt like <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> sister because I'm going to be like her in a while. So it was really helpful to experience all these things and to see how it is and to feel a part of it actually." ...|$|E
500|$|In March 1948 Horne {{appeared}} with Murdoch in six episodes of the BBC Television comedy series Kaleidoscope. In June that year he and Murdoch again appeared {{on television in}} a one-off sitcom, At Home, which they wrote. The following year Horne began his connection with Twenty Questions, an association that lasted, on-and-off, for 20 years. By the fourth series of Much-Binding in 1950, the listener figures had declined to a level that concerned the BBC and they decided against a fifth series. Rather than {{wait to see what}} other offers of work would come in from the Corporation, Horne and Murdoch signed the comedy to a 35-programme series on Radio Luxembourg between October 1950 and June 1951. The programme was poorly received on the commercial channel: Murdoch observed that [...] "it wasn't really a great success—even my mother said it was rotten, and <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> greatest fan". After one series, the show returned to the BBC in 1951–52, although renamed as Over to You. Murdoch and Horne again appeared together, in April 1952, on Desert Island Discs.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Mercury had a {{long-term}} relationship with Mary Austin, whom he met through guitarist Brian May. He lived with Austin for several years in West Kensington, London. By the mid-1970s, the singer had begun {{an affair with a}} male American record executive at Elektra Records and, in December 1976, Mercury told Austin of his sexuality, which ended their romantic relationship. Mercury moved out of the flat they shared, into 12 Stafford Terrace in Kensington and bought Austin a place of her own nearby. They remained close friends through the years, with Mercury often referring to her as his only true friend. In a 1985 interview, Mercury said of Austin, [...] "All my lovers asked me why they couldn't replace Mary , but it's simply impossible. The only friend I've got is Mary and I don't want anybody else. To me, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> common-law wife. To me, it was a marriage. We believe in each other, that's enough for me." [...] He also wrote several songs about Austin, the most notable of which is [...] "Love of My Life". Mercury's final home, Garden Lodge, 1 Logan Place, a twenty-eight room Georgian mansion in Kensington set in a quarter-acre manicured garden surrounded by a high brick wall, had been picked out by Austin. In his will, Mercury left his London home to Austin, rather than his partner Jim Hutton, saying to her, [...] "You would have been my wife {{and it would have been}} yours anyway." [...] Mercury was also the godfather of Austin's oldest son, Richard.|$|E

500|$|... "Champion" [...] {{was written}} by Minaj, along with T-Minus, Nikhil S., Drake, Young Jeezy, and Nas, with {{production}} handled by T-Minus and Nikhil S., who had previously worked with Minaj on her debut studio album Pink Friday (2010). Minaj had wanted several artists {{to appear on the}} song, including fellow New York rapper Nas. She had stated that she did not think that she could get Nas on the song, saying [...] "He's always been so exclusive. He doesn't work with everybody and I respect people that are like that. They take pride in their craft." [...] Minaj told Vibe, [...] "I keep saying to be from Queens and to end up having him... We know how picky he is [...] He said 'I like the song, I'm a do it, you can wait 'til Monday and I got you' and he kept his word. He murked it, for me to wait for a feature and it be that and murk the song and finish the song that way... I was amazed." [...] After hearing the song, Nas agreed to be on the track, and sent his verse back to Minaj the following Monday. After collaborating, Nas said that he {{had fallen in love with}} the song: [...] "Nicki hit us up, I got love, so it was nothin'--I did the record....If I feel it, I can get on it. I heard the track. I felt it. I loved it." [...] Another artist Minaj wanted on [...] "Champion" [...] was long-time idol and fellow female rapper Lauryn Hill. [...] "I wanted to get her on 'Champion'... That would have been crazy, right? <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> fave. [...] Lauryn to me is the goddess. I'd love to meet her. I'm pretty sure she's heard me talk about her a billion times." [...] Although Minaj vouched for Hill to appear on the track, plans were never finalized and the collaboration ultimately fell through.|$|E

6000|$|All folk {{literature}} has indeed a passion whose like {{is not in}} modern literature and music and art, except where it has come by some straight or crooked way out of ancient times. Love was held to be a fatal sickness in ancient Ireland, {{and there is a}} love-poem in The Songs of Connacht that is like a death cry: 'My love, O <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> love, the woman who is most for destroying me, dearer <b>is</b> <b>she</b> for making me ill than the woman who would be for making me well. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> treasure, O <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> treasure, the woman of the grey eyes ... a woman who would not lay a hand under <b>my</b> head.... <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> love, O <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> love, the woman who left no strength in me; a woman who would not breathe a sigh after me, a woman who would not raise a stone at <b>my</b> tomb.... <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> secret love, O <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> secret love. A woman who tells me nothing,... a woman who does not remember me to <b>be</b> out.... <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> choice, O <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> choice, the woman who would not look back at me, the woman who would not make peace with me.... <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> desire, O <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> desire: a woman dearest to me under the sun, a woman who would not pay me heed, if I were to sit by her side. It <b>is</b> <b>she</b> ruined <b>my</b> heart and left a sigh for ever in me.' There is another song that ends, 'The Erne shall be in strong flood, the hills shall be torn down, and the sea shall have red waves, and blood shall be spilled, and every mountain valley and every moor shall be on high, before you shall perish, my little black rose.' Nor do the old Irish weigh and measure their hatred. The nurse of O'Sullivan Bere in the folk song prays that the bed of his betrayer may be the red hearth-stone of hell for ever. And an Elizabethan Irish poet cries: 'Three things <b>are</b> waiting for <b>my</b> death. The devil, who <b>is</b> waiting for <b>my</b> soul and cares nothing for my body or my wealth; the worms, who <b>are</b> waiting for <b>my</b> body but care nothing for my soul or my wealth; <b>my</b> children, who <b>are</b> waiting for <b>my</b> wealth and care nothing for my body or my soul. O Christ, hang all three in the one noose.' Such love and hatred seek no mortal thing but their own infinity, and such love and hatred soon become love and hatred of the idea. The lover who loves so passionately can soon sing to his beloved like the lover in the poem by 'A. E.,' 'A vast desire awakes and grows into forgetfulness of thee.' ...|$|R

2500|$|Capote based the {{character}} of Idabel in Other Voices, Other Rooms on his Monroeville neighbor and best friend, Harper Lee. Capote once acknowledged this: [...] "Mr. and Mrs. Lee, Harper Lee's mother and father, lived very near. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> best friend. Did you ever read her book, To Kill a Mockingbird? I'm a character in that book, which {{takes place in the}} same small town in Alabama where we lived.
