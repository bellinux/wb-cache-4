This access is difficult to obtain for current systems, and {{may be even more}} so for larger future systems. In this environment, satellite systems that minimize the amount of spectrum orbit resource required to meet a specific traffic requirement are essential.

40|$|We discuss {{general aspects}} of {{dimensional}} reduction induced by nonlinear scalar dynamics, including the small fluctuation {{expansion of the}} action. The case of compact positively curved scalar manifolds described by symmetric spaces G/H is shown {{to be free of}} tachyonic instabilities; the spectrum consists of a graviton, a massless scalar and towers of massive spin-two, spin-one, and spin-zero fields. These towers are worked out explicitly for the case of a two-sphere. The case of noncompact negatively curved scalar manifolds inducing a noncompact nonhomogeneous space for the extra dimensions is studied in the particular example of SU(1, 1) /U(1). The massless spectrum consists of a graviton and a scalar and suitable boundary conditions are seen to give a discrete <b>spectrum,</b> actual <b>conservation</b> of formally conserved quantities, and no problems of interpretation.

However, hardware imperfections and propagation effects, particularly rain depolarization, prevent the achievement of this doubling without severe system performance degradation. A decision-directed cross-polarization correction network is presented whose operation depends on only simple base-band signal processing. No pilot tones or frequency offsets are required. The loop can work with any two-dimensional signal set for digital data transmission. The loop has been experimentally verified and provides a means of doubling the data capacity with little performance degradation...|$|E
40|$|Any future mobile {{satellite}} service (MSS) which is to provide simultaneous mobile communications for {{a large number of}} users will have to make very efficient use of the spectrum. As the spectrum available for an MSS is limited, the system's channels should be packed as closely together as possible, with minimum-width guard bands. In addition the employment of frequency reuse schemes is an important factor. Difficulties regarding these solutions are related to the introduction of interference in the link. A balance must be achieved between the competing aims of <b>spectrum</b> <b>conservation</b> and low interference. While the interference phenomenon in narrowband FM voice channels is reasonably well understood, very little effort, however, has been devoted to the problem in digital radios.

40|$|In {{the past}} a wide <b>spectrum</b> of <b>conservation</b> {{strategies}} {{has been used}} to manage forests and recently a country-driven policy instrument known as REDD+ has been proposed as a new tool for forest protection. This paper reviews a set of Cameroon policy instruments alongside 86 relevant publications in the conservation area to feed the existing REDD+ debate. Two specific shortcomings are identified: (1) incoherence between existing forestry policy instruments with regard to community forest concept and REDD+ rules and (2) locally over-constraining approaches used in forest management which would provide guidelines and caution about the REDD+ implementation. These shortcomings, if not considered, may lead to ineffectiveness of emission reduction programs as well as to social disconnection at the local level. This means that effective implementation of REDD+ will require further policy actions mainly dealing with actors' consents within developed equitable instruments while setting up efficient conflict management systems...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a {{communications}} system which uses a combination of single and double- sideband techniques. Audio intelligence information is transmitted via single sideband and a single frequency tone is transmitted via double sideband to provide a means of carrier- frequency reinsertion at the receiving terminal. This system provides the power and <b>spectrum</b> <b>conservation</b> achieved by single-sideband techniques, and the means of obtaining the proper frequency for carrier reinsertion at the receiver which can be obtained by synchronous reception of the double- sideband information. The carrier frequency, which is common to both the single and doublesideband signals during the generation process at the transmitter, is suppressed to the fullest possible extent prior to the actual transmission of the sidebands. Use of a narrow bandwidth filter for the double sidebands at the receiver allows the synchronizing tone to be transmitted at a level much lower than that of the intelligence-bearing single sideband, providing economy of transmitted power. The inherent automatic-frequency-control feature of the synchronous detector allows system frequency stability requirements to be lessened, and provides rapid frequency correction to overcome Doppler frequency shifts.

40|$|The {{evolution}} equations for nonlinear Scholte waves (finite amplitude {{elastic waves}} propagating along liquid/solid interface), {{which account for}} the second order nonlinearity of a liquid, are derived for the first time. For mathematical simplicity the nonlinearity of the solid, which influence {{is expected to be}} weak in the case of weak localization of the Scholte wave, is not taken into consideration. The analysis of these equations demonstrates that the nonlinear processes contributing to the evolution of the Scholte wave can be divided into two groups. The first group includes nonlinear processes leading to wave spectrum broadening which are common to bulk pressure waves in liquids and gases. The second group includes the nonlinear processes which are active only in the frequency down-conversion (leading to wave <b>spectrum</b> <b>conservation</b> or narrowing), which are specific to the confined nature of the interface wave. It is demonstrated that the nonlinear parameters, which characterize the efficiency of various nonlinear processes in the interface wave; Strongly depend on the relative properties of the contacting liquid and solid (or, in other words, on the deviation of the Scholte wave velocity from the velocities of sound in liquid and in solid). In particular, the sign of the nonlinear parameter responsible for the second harmonic generation can differ from the sign of the nonlinear acoustic parameter of the liquid. It is also verified that there are particular liquid/solid combinations where the nonlinear processes, which are inactive in the frequency up-conversion, dominate {{in the evolution of the}} Scholte wave. In this case distortionless propagation of the finite amplitude harmonic interface wave is possible.

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / September 15 - 17, 1969 / Sheraton Park Hotel, Washington, D. C. Telemetry systems {{require the}} {{transmission}} of information in analog, sampled, and digital forms. There also are requirements for <b>spectrum</b> <b>conservation,</b> for minimum spurious transmission outside the assigned band, and for highest flexibility in multiplexing and in accepting {{a wide range of}} sensors. The paper describes the conceptual design of an advanced information transmission system that operates basically in the sampled mode, but that can accept analog inputs through an information compressing sampler or digital inputs by taking one sample of each input bit and making binary decisions in the receiver. The system uses three different encoding processes in an integrated manner. The first encoding process is performed by a redundancy reducing computer-like subsystem called the contractive encoder. Its purpose is to eliminate unnecessary samples while keeping the essential samples at their correct place on the time scale. Repetition of already transmitted samples. or the insertion of samples from other channels will fill the space of samples that have been removed. The second encoding process is performed by a distributive encoder. The purpose of this part of the information processor is the protection of the information against sudden pulsive disturbances. The distributive encoder spreads the information content of each sample over tens to hundreds of other samples in an ordered manner. If, during transmission, one sample or a group of samples is heavily mutilated by pulsive disturbances, the corresponding decoder in the receiver will recover most of the information of these mutilated samples from the other undisturbed samples while spreading the energy of the pulsive disturbances over all samples so that it contributes only a negligibly small error to any one of them. The third encoding process is performed by the modulative encoder. This device has the task of shaping the samples that are produced by the distributive encoder into bandlimited waveforms so that a noise-like, bandlimited composite transmission signal with a uniform spectral distribution is finally fed into the communication channel. Many adaptive features and the option to use a return channel for repetitions of blocks of samples give the system high stability, high efficiency, and low error ratio...|$|E
40|$|In South Africa, {{communal}} {{rural community}} development has, {{for the most}} part, been viewed as an add-on, {{rather than as an}} integral value in the broad <b>spectrum</b> of <b>conservation</b> activities being practised in the country. This paper, therefore, argues for the reality-based adoption of an extension of existing conservation paradigms to incorporate the development of communal rural communities {{as an integral part of}} the overall wildlife conservation and management policy in South Africa. The answer to the seeming contradiction in the focus of wildlife conservation and rural development lies in the devel- opment of wildlife management programmes based on multi-disciplinary and multiinstitutional interaction, by also harnessing scientific knowledge and skills found in the social sciences. In this manner, the present largely lip service related to so-called com- munity participation in wildlife management can be changed into programmes which really achieve conservation-based community development enhancing survival for both the communities and their inherent natural resources...|$|R

They uniquely have a massive ‘captive audience’ of visitors whose knowledge, understanding, attitude, behaviour and involvement can all be positively influenced and harnessed. They have a huge resource of technical skills and dedicated people. As habitats shrink and collection-managed populations grow, the definition of what is a zoo, what is a botanic garden, what is a reserve, and who is a collection-based conservationist, who is a field-based conservationist, will inevitably blur. Indeed, zoos, aquariums and botanic gardens {{have an opportunity to}} establish themselves as models of ‘integrated conservation’. In the German speaking part of Europe e.g. 45 zoos have united themselves in the “Foundation species conservation” with the purpose to advertise conservation projects on a large scale.|$|R

50|$|The first {{principle}} in determining treatment is {{to require that}} all conservation be reversible, appropriate and the least invasive possible. It should be {{the intent of the}} conservation to place the object in a stable condition with the least amount of future deterioration. The simplest form of this process can be found in moving an object to a more stable environment. An example of a minor concern would stabilizing loose sections of leather or a flaking surface of the material. Several solutions could be utilized from application of surface finishes or inpainting of damage. Careful consideration should be given to ensure the selected method is the best conservation practice. On the more severe side of the <b>spectrum</b> of <b>conservation</b> is full restoration. This would mean that a most if not all of the leather covering of an object would need to be replaced.

We find that the tunneling conductance spectra for the underdoped compound in the superconducting state do not follow the conservation of states rule. There is a consistent loss of states for the underdoped BI 2212 implying an underlying depression in the density of states (DOS) and hence the pseudogap near the Fermi energy (E$_F$). Such an underlying depression can also explain the peak-dip-hump structure observed in the <b>spectra.</b> Furthermore, the <b>conservation</b> of states is recovered and the dip-hump structure disappears after normalizing the low temperature spectra {{with that of the}} normal state.

40|$|Alarm {{over the}} {{prospects}} for survival of species in a rapidly changing world has encouraged discussion of translocation conservation strategies that move beyond the focus of ‘at-risk’ species. These approaches consider larger spatial and temporal scales than customary, {{with the aim of}} recreating functioning ecosystems through a combination of large-scale ecological restoration and species introductions. The term ‘rewilding’ has come to apply to this large-scale ecosystem restoration program. While reintroductions of species within their historical ranges have become standard conservation tools, introductions within known paleontological ranges—but outside historical ranges—are more controversial, as is the use of taxon substitutions for extinct species. Here, we consider possible conservation translocations for nine large-bodied taxa in tropical Asia-Pacific. We consider the entire <b>spectrum</b> of <b>conservation</b> translocation strategies as defined by the IUCN in addition to rewilding. The taxa considered are spread across diverse taxonomic and ecological spectra and all are listed as ‘endangered’ or ‘critically endangered’ by the IUCN in our region of study. They all have a written and fossil record that is sufficient to assess past changes in range, as well as ecological and environmental preferences, and the reasons for their decline, and they have all suffered massive range restrictions since the late Pleistocene. General principles, problems, and benefits of translocation strategies are reviewed as case studies. These allowed us to develop a conservation translocation matrix, with taxa scored for risk, benefit, and feasibility. Comparisons between taxa across this matrix indicated that orangutans, tapirs, Tasmanian devils, and perhaps tortoises are the most viable taxa for translocations. However, overall the case studies revealed a need for more data and research for all taxa, and their ecological and environmental needs. Rewilding the Asian-Pacific tropics remains a controversial conservation strategy, and would be difficult in what is largely a highly fragmented area geographically. Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{consensus}} among scientists and natural resource managers that conservation efforts addressing nonpoint source pollution are most effective when coordinated at a watershed scale. In light of this understanding, {{the question is how}} to mobilize effective conservation strategies at the watershed scale in order to ensure desired water quality. With public resources limited, much of this question can be understood as a tension between seeking to put in place those actions that will assure the largest improvements in water quality while striving for the lowest costs to land owners, citizens, and agencies. The Maumee River watershed, whose 8, 316 square mile area is over 70 % in agricultural land cover, presents an interesting and timely setting for tackling this challenge. 1 The Maumee’s tri-state river watershed, spanning OH, IN, and MI, drains into the Western Lake Erie Basin and carries with it an excess load of dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP), a nutrient that contributes significantly to the occurrence of harmful algal blooms (HABs). While HABs have been an increasing concern over the last decade, they came to the forefront of national news when in August 2014 the City of Toledo was forced to shut off its drinking water supply sourced from Western Lake Erie to approximately 500, 000 metropolitan area residents due to microcystin contamination, a toxin produced by a HAB in Western Lake Erie. 2 This report identifies a wide <b>spectrum</b> of <b>conservation</b> practices and policy approaches for reducing DRP at the watershed scale, including both voluntary and regulatory approaches. These are combined with model analysis of the physical watershed’s landscape and an independently designed cost effectiveness analysis in order to create marginal cost of abatement curves that define a suite of possible watershed scale management scenarios structured to achieve optimum improvements to water quality...|$|R
40|$|The {{functional}} trait-based bioenergetic {{approach is}} emergent in many ecological <b>spectra,</b> from the <b>conservation</b> {{of natural resources}} to mitigation and adaptation strategies in a global climate change context. Such an approach relies {{on being able to}} exploit mechanistic rules to connect environmental human-induced variability to functional traits (i. e. all those specific traits defining species in terms of their ecological roles) and use these to provide estimates of species life history traits (LH; e. g. body size, fecundity per life span, number of reproductive events). LHs are species-specific and proximate determinants of population characteristics in a certain habitat. They represent the most valuable quantitative information to investigate how broad potential distributional boundaries of a species are, and to feed predictive population models. There is much {{to be found in the}} current literature that describes mechanistic functional trait-based bioenergetics models, using them to test ecological hypotheses, but a mathematical framework often renders interpretation and use complicated. Here, we wanted to present a simpler interpretation and description of one of the most important recent mechanistic bioenergetic theories: the dynamic energy budget theory by Kooijman (Dynamic Energy Budget Theory for Metabolic Organisation, 2010, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge). Our main aim was to disentangle those aspects that at first reading may seem too mathematically challenging to many marine biologists, ecologists and environmental scientists, and present them for use in mechanistic applications...|$|R
40|$|In 2001, {{a diverse}} group of {{citizens}} ranging from conservationists to industrial developers joined forces to produce a factual description of Oak Ridge's environment and the issues associated with contamination on the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) reservation. This consensus effort was a result of common values not generally seen in this spectrum of philosophies, and of shared concerns about rising property taxes, declining city services, fleeing retail establishments, and diminishing real estate values. These problems are attributed to waning local DOE budgets coupled with Oak Ridge's national reputation of being contaminated and unsafe. This undeserved reputation harms the city's ability to attract new industry to replace declining federal employment and to induce families to live in the community. Representatives from a <b>spectrum</b> of <b>conservation,</b> environmental, economic development, local government, and civic organizations were invited to meet regarding how to best explain the complex environmental story of Oak Ridge and the DOE reservation. This large group decided to publish a straightforward explanation of the environmental quality of the city and its relationship to the DOE reservation in easy-to-understand language. The result was Oak Ridge, Tennessee [...] A Citizen's Guide to the Environment, a 28 -page glossy booklet, distributed through the Chamber of Commerce and other organizations. The Oak Ridger ensured wide distribution in the community by publishing it as an insert in the daily paper. The material is also available on several web sites. A trifold brochure summarizing and promoting the larger document was also produced for wider distribution. The integrity of the Citizen's Guide was ensured by having a six-member editorial team manage writing and review of the document. There was no direct involvement by the DOE and its contractor. Knowledgeable citizen writers from throughout the community contributed technical and descriptive text. A professional technical editor melded the disparate styles into a cohesive publication. Volunteers from about 100 organizations reviewed the draft for accuracy of content and readability. Participating organizations, upon review of the final draft, then decided whether their names would be listed in the document as contributors and supporters. While the writing and editing was primarily accomplished by conservation and civic organizations, funding to print the final publications came largely from economic development interests and their supporters.

40|$|Proteins make up {{for most}} of the dry mass of a cell and they are highly {{involved}} in virtually all cellular processes. The importance of the proteins is reflected by frequent association between dysfunctional proteins and diseases. Proteins have also wide applications in industries. The function of a protein is closely related to its marginally stable structure, which is encoded in its primary amino acid sequence. In order to understand protein functions and design proteins for new applications, we need to understand the stability and the folding process of a protein. Further proteins often assert their functions by interacting with other molecules and ions. The capability of recognizing and binding other molecules and ions is the key to many vital functions. Although the protein stability and recognition may appear to be different problems, they share the same basic physiochemical principle. In this thesis, the issues of protein stability and folding and the recognition of specific DNA sequences are examined for a number of different systems. In the first study, molecular dynamics simulations have been conducted to examine the homeodomain-DNA recognition. It was found that residue 50 interacts more favourably through a number of interaction modes (hydrogen bonds, water mediated hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions) with its consensus DNA sequence thus plays a considerable role in DNA recognition. Further high mobility water molecules were found in the protein-DNA interface and they may have nanosecond scale residence time. In the second study, the influence of Zn ion on DNA binding and stability of the transcriptional factor p 53 DNA binding domain is probed by molecular dynamics simulations. The Zn ion had an attractive force on the DNA backbone phosphates; further Zn ion appeared to coordinate motions among different structural elements. Possible aggregation initiation site on p 53 DNA binding domain without Zn ion was proposed. In the third paper, we examined the thermal unfolding pathways of the p 53 tetramerization domain, a small tetramer. The transition state was studied by phi value analysis. In the initial stage the native hydrophobic contacts were lost followed by simultaneous unfolding of the tertiary and secondary structures. The unfolding followed tetramer to dimer to monomer pathway and the transition state was not a well-defined structure but an ensemble of different structures. In the last study the stability and function of hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase were inspected and related to the mutational <b>spectrum</b> and evolutionary <b>conservation.</b> The results show {{that there are a number}} of residues where no substitution was found despite several of them are vitally important to the protein.

40|$|The first {{scope of}} this work was to {{investigate}} the effects of liquid nitrogen and formalin-based conservation in the laser-induced fluorescence spectra taken from peripheral vascular tissue. A He-Cd laser emitting at 442 nm and an Ar+ laser emitting at 457. 9 nm, 476. 5 nm, 488 nm, 496. 5 nm and 501. 7 nm were used as excitation sources. Separate sets of measurements were made for all samples at each of these wavelengths. All samples were obtained from by-pass operations and amputations performed at the Vascular Surgery Clinic of the University of Crete. The samples were irradiated one hour after the excision. The fluorescence spectra from fresh tissues were compared to those taken after the tissues were stored in liquid nitrogen or formalin for 24 and 48 hours. The comparison of the fluorescence signals was made with the implementation of twelve (12) simple algebraic algorithms which were based on the intensity difference of the recorded spectra. All the in vitro laser induced fluorescence spectroscopy studies were performed after the conservation of the specimens for a certain time in formalin or in liquid nitrogen. So far the effects of the liquid nitrogen or formalin-based conservation in the fluorescence spectra of the tissues have not been extensively studied. The lack of this kind of study in the international literature made its realization a necessity. The aims of this study were: the investigation of the changes in the fluorescence <b>spectra</b> due to <b>conservation,</b> the study of the time required for the generation of such changes and the selection of a way of conservation which induces the less changes in the distribution of the recorded fluorescence signals. The algorithms seemed to give better results in the discrimination of the tissues, for formalin than for liquid nitrogen conservation. Some of the algorithms succeeded to detect changes in the fluorescence signal of tissue samples obtained directly after excision from those stored in liquid nitrogen or formalin for 24 hours, but usually failed to detect any variations between 24 and 48 hours. The results suggest that liquid nitrogen conservation does not seriously alter the spectral features of excised tissue whereas formalin conservation seem to affect the distribution of the laser induced fluorescence spectra within the first 24 hours. The second {{scope of this}} work {{was to investigate the}} feasibility of application of laser induced fluorescence spectroscopy (in vitro) in order to discriminate between normal and pathologic peripheral vascular tissue. 	A He-Cd laser emitting at 442 nm and an Ar+ laser emitting at 457. 9 nm, 476. 5 nm, 488 nm, 496. 5 nm were again used as excitation sources. All samples were subjected to either single or dual wavelength excitation from the He-Cd laser and one of the Ar+ laser emission lines. All the samples (abdominal aortas, as well as flank, femoral, tibial, fibular and ham artery tissues) were obtained from by-pass operations and amputations performed at the aforementioned Clinic. The discrimination and the classification of different types of tissue (normal artery, fibrous plaque, calcified plaque) was done with: i) the implementation of twelve (12) simple algebraic algorithms, which were related to the recorded spectra and ii) study of the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the spectra. In addition, a number of the obtained fluorescence spectra was processed with the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) in order to analyze them in a more detailed way. Furthermore, the way of excitation (single or dual wavelength) which gives the best results in terms of discrimination of tissues was investigated. Finally, a number of in vivo fluorescence measurements was taken during by-pass operations using as an excitation source a He-Cd laser. The in vivo measurements were performed at The Royal London Hospital, Whitechapel, London. 	The primary aim of this study, was to investigate the possibility for the clinical use of this relatively new, minimally invasive technique (laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy), as a diagnostic tool for the early detection of diseased peripheral vascular tissues. The collection and the analysis of the data was made in a relatively small time interval (a few seconds), in order to make possible the application of this technique to in vivo measurements too. The intention is to use this technique in conjunction with the existing diagnostic methods, in order to obtain more accurate and reliable information about diseased peripheral vascular tissues at an early stage. 	In the case of in vitro measurements, the use of algorithms made possible the discrimination between normal and fibrous or calcified tissue. The application of the algorithms seemed to be more efficient regarding the discrimination of tissues in the case of dual wavelength excitation. This was more profound in the discrimination between normal and fibrous tissue. The best results were obtained when the combination of wavelengths 442 nm + 488 nm and 442 nm + 496. 5 nm were used for the excitation of the samples. The analysis of the fluorescence spectra with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) allowed not only the discrimination between normal and fibrous and normal and calcified tissue, but the discrimination between fibrous and calcified plaque as well. For the in vivo measurements the samples were subjected only to single wavelength excitation {{with the use of the}} He-Cd laser (442 nm). Initial results were promising with respect to the discrimination between normal and abnormal vessels. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to support the preliminary observations. The third scope of this work was to investigate fluorescence spectra taken from lamb and human hearts (in vitro). 	An Ar+ laser emitting at 457. 9 nm was used for excitation. The lamb hearts were irradiated within the first two hours after the excision. The human hearts were obtained from the morgue and were irradiated one hour after the excision. Spectra from different cardiac compartments (the left and right atria and ventricles, the myocardium, the epicardium, the aorta and the fat deposits) were recorded. It was investigated whether each chamber exhibited constant spectral response. Efforts were also made to discriminate the different cardiac compartments, using laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy, by comparing the spectral intensity and by using simple algorithms based on the spectral intensity variation. The alterations in the fluorescence spectra due to the conservation of the samples in formalin for 48 hours were also investigated. Finally, a number of in vivo measurements was taken during open heart operations at the Saint Bartholomew Hospital, London. Due to technical reasons, these measurements were performed using the He-Cd laser. In the present work healthy hearts were examined. In this way the emission spectrum of the myocardial tissue was investigated and an effort was made to detect any pathologic state of the myocardium. The aim is to use this diagnostic technique along with the ordinary biopsy, for the extraction of better results. 	It was observed that both in human and in lamb heart tissue all the measurements that were taken from the same chamber were remarkably constant. Since the samples were characterized as healthy, it is expected that there will be alterations in the fluorescence signals recorded from diseased parts. In all the hearts that were investigated (both human and lamb), the fluorescence spectra obtained from the aortas and the atria (in particular the left atrium) were more intense than the ones obtained from other parts (e. g. ventricles). The fluorescence spectra recorded from the myocardium of the human heart (in vitro) exhibited significant spectral differences from the ones recorded from other compartments of the heart. After the conservation of the human and lamb hearts in formalin for 48 hours, changes were observed in their spectral response, similar to those observed in the case of the peripheral vascular tissues. The fluorescence signals that were obtained during the in vivo measurements in human hearts presented a lot of similarities (in the morphology and in the change of the intensity of the signal from different cardiac compartments) with the spectra that were recorded in vitro. 	The methodology and the results of this work are expected to have clinical applications in the future of the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. Ο πρώτος στόχος ήταν η μελέτη της επίδρασης της συντήρησης σε φορμόλη και υγρό άζωτο στο φάσμα φθορισμού επαγόμενου από λέιζερ των περιφερειακών αγγείων. Για την διέγερση των δειγμάτων χρησιμοποιήθηκαν τα λέιζερ Ηλίου-Καδμίου (442 nm) και ιόντων Αργού (457. 9, 476. 5, 488, 496. 5, και 501. 7 nm) σε ξεχωριστές σειρές μετρήσεων. Όλα τα δείγματα πάρθηκαν από εγχειρήσεις by-pass και ακρωτηριασμούς που έγιναν στην Αγγειοχειρουργική Κλινική του Πανεπιστημίου Κρήτης και ακτινοβολήθηκαν περίπου μία ώρα μετά την εκτομή τους. Πραγματοποιήθηκε σύγκριση των φασμάτων φθορισμού των ιστών όταν ήταν νωποί και μετά τη συντήρηση τους σε φορμόλη ή υγρό άζωτο για 24 και 48 ώρες. Η σύγκριση των σημάτων φθορισμού έγινε με την εφαρμογή δώδεκα (12) απλών αλγεβρικών αλγορίθμων, οι οποίοι ήταν βασισμένοι στις διαφορές της έντασης των καταγραφόμενων φασμάτων. Όλες οι in vitro μελέτες φασματοσκοπίας φθορισμού επαγόμενου από λέιζερ πάνω σε ανθρώπινους ιστούς πραγματοποιήθηκαν κατόπιν συντήρησης των δειγμάτων για κάποιο χρονικό διάστημα σε φορμόλη ή υγρό άζωτο. Μέχρι τώρα δεν υπήρξε καμία εκτεταμένη μελέτη για το ρόλο της συντήρησης σε φορμόλη ή υγρό άζωτο στα σήματα φθορισμού. Η έλλειψη στη διεθνή βιβλιογραφία μίας τέτοιας έρευνας έκανε επιτακτική την ανάγκη υλοποίησης της. Οι στόχοι της παρούσας εργασίας ήταν: η διερεύνηση των αλλοιώσεων στα φάσματα που οφείλονται αποκλειστικά στην συντήρηση, η μελέτη του χρόνου που απαιτείται για τη δημιουργία αυτών των αλλοιώσεων και η ανάδειξη του τρόπου συντήρησης που επιφέρει τις|$|R
