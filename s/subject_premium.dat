40|$|Let {{me begin}} with some {{practical}} examples of experience rating. a) Swiss Automobile Tariff 1963 — Within each tariff-position there are 22 grades: — The new owner of a car starts at grade 9 — The basic premium is determined {{on the basis of}} objective characteristics of the risk and essentially depends on the horse-power classification of the car — The 22 grades are experience-rated as follows: For each accident one rises three grades and for each accident-free year one falls one grade. A driver who has I accident in every 4 years hence remains within four adjacent grades. b) Sliding Scale Premiums in Reinsurance Excess of Loss Contracts often stipulate that: The rate of premium to be applied to the <b>subject</b> <b>premium</b> volume is determined {{at the end of the}} cover period as follows: subject to a minimum of 0, 04 and a maximum of 0, 08 c) Participation in Mortality Profit in Group Life Insurance A group life insurance covers the members of the group on a one year term basis. It is often agreed that at the end of the year mortality profits are given back to the group according to the formula refund = x% gross premiums — y% claims (where x < y) All these examples fall under the heading "Experience Rating”.

40|$|Wisconsin’s BadgerCare Plus (BC+) {{program was}} {{designed}} to ensure access to health insurance coverage to virtually all Wisconsin children and to bolster coverage for parents and other caretaker adults. The program, launched in February of 2008, expanded upon BadgerCare (Wisconsin’s Children’s Health Insurance Program- CHIP) and Medicaid. Its reforms included eligibility expansions; simplification of eligibility rules and enrollment and verification processes; and an aggressive marketing and outreach campaign. BadgerCare Plus eliminated the income eligibility ceiling for children. Coverage operates as a single program with two insurance products: the Standard Plan, for enrollees 200 % FPL. The former is the traditional Medicaid plan and requires only minimal cost-sharing, while the latter is comprised of a more limited set of covered services and requires co-payments on non-preventive services, similar to private insurance policies. The premium threshold for children was set at 150 % FPL under BadgerCare and was raised to 200 % FPL under BadgerCare Plus. Modest-income children (200 - 300 % FPL) enrolled in the Benchmark Plan are <b>subject</b> to <b>premium</b> payments that increase with family income level...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSocial {{interactions}} may {{alter the}} purchase of fair-trade food products by triggering social- or self-image concerns. We identify these concerns by eliciting the willingness-to-pay (WTP) premium for fair-trade vs. non-fair-trade chocolate of subjects under various conditions. We find that both social- and self-image matter: (i) subjects' WTP premium for fair-trade is higher when their decisions are made public; and (ii) <b>subjects</b> revise this <b>premium</b> upward (downward) when their expectations about the premium of others increase (decrease). However, there are significant asymmetries. Making decisions public decreases the WTP for non-fair-trade chocolate rather than increases the WTP for fair-trade chocolate. Downward revisions of the premium are larger and more frequent than upward revisions...|$|R
5000|$|To {{reduce the}} {{electric}} energy consumption from motors and their associated carbon footprints, various regulatory authorities in many countries have introduced and implemented legislation to encourage the manufacture and use of higher efficiency electric motors. A well-designed motor can convert over 90% of its input energy into useful power for decades. When the efficiency of a motor is raised by even a few percentage points, the savings, in kilowatt hours (and therefore in cost), are enormous. The electrical energy efficiency of a typical industrial induction motor can be improved by: 1) reducing the electrical losses in the stator windings (e.g., by increasing the cross-sectional area of the conductor, improving the winding technique, and using materials with higher electrical conductivities, such as copper), 2) reducing the electrical losses in the rotor coil or casting (e.g., by using materials with higher electrical conductivities, such as copper), 3) reducing magnetic losses by using better quality magnetic steel, 4) improving the aerodynamics of motors to reduce mechanical windage losses, 5) improving bearings to reduce friction losses, and 6) minimizing manufacturing tolerances.

The objective is to develop insurance contracts that maximize the correlation between yield losses and indemnities, <b>subject</b> to possessing <b>premiums</b> cheap enough to attract participation of poor smallholder farmers. Using historical crop yields from nine selected districts and satellite data obtained from SADC Remote Sensing unit, we show that for most districts VCIs show correlations with crop yields that range from 0. 60 - 0. 90. Further, for most districts, premium rates within the desirable range (5 - 10 %) are recoverable. In addition, for most districts VCIs were able to consistently trace extreme drought events but tended to miss on events of lesser intensity. ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{presents}} a time series examination of price premiums in the US airline industry. Price premiums {{are defined as}} price markups due to domination and concentration {{at the airport and}} route market levels. The differential effect of these price premium drivers is empirically investigated, and it is shown that the largest components of price premiums are those from airport market share and airport concentration. The effect of low cost carrier competition on the level and composition of price premiums is of particular interest in this study. The results indicate that low cost carriers do not charge price premiums, and that high cost carriers' price premiums tend to be lower when there is competition by low cost carriers. While the absolute values of price premiums have been fairly constant over the 1992 - 2002 time frame, the proportion of US passengers <b>subject</b> to price <b>premiums</b> has decreased due to the increasing share of low cost carrier traffic.

Introduction The Canadian retirement income system (RIS) is generally considered a success story. Since 1971, senior citizens have experienced a significant improvement in their relative incomes, and an impressive number of seniors has moved out of poverty. The system provides most elderly Canadians at the low-to-middle income level with the means to largely preserve their living standards in retirement. At the same time, middle -to-high income households have an incentive to save for retirement because public pension benefits remain relatively modest. The reforms that have been implemented since the late 1990 s have rendered the system viable in the long-run. They include a gradual increase in contributions (to a "steady-state" level) and in the amount of earnings <b>subject</b> to <b>premium</b> payments, changes in the administration and calculation of benefits, and the creation of an investment board to invest funds not immediately needed for benefits. However, the retirement of the baby boom generation, starting at the end of this decade, raises new challenges. The old-age dependency ratio is expected to rise sharply (Chart 1), and the RIS will have to cope with these new demographic trends. Although the adjustments to the RIS and the economic recovery of the late 1990 s restored the financial health of the RIS, there is still scope for additional reforms in preparation for the retirement of the baby boom generation. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{sought to}} {{estimate}} the economic value of selected Sydney beaches, {{in order to provide}} the necessary information to allow local and State government agencies to identify the most appropriate management response to projected climate change impacts. Three case-study sites (Collaroy-Narrabeen, Manly Ocean Beach, and a combined site in the Hawkesbury River that included the Brooklyn Baths and Dangar Island) were selected via a weighted-criteria method using an expert panel. Valuation methods were selected in response to the key coastal management challenges in the region, vulnerability to inundation and shoreline recession. A truncated negative binomial travel cost model identified consumer surplus values of between AUD$ 2. 72 and $ 20. 63 for a beach day, depending on the site under investigation and the specification of the cost parameter. These are similar to those in the published literature. Aggregate values are derived only for comparison with costs of management options, due to concerns about the quality of visitation information. These comparisons suggest a strong economic argument for beach nourishment at the case-study beaches. The Contingent Valuation (CV) method was employed {{to estimate the}} willingness to pay (WTP) of beach visitors for prevention of climate change erosion at the case-study beaches. Screening and follow-up questions were employed to identify the influence of scenario rejection on WTP responses and values. Binary probit analysis of non-protest responses resulted in average WTP of AUD$ 116. 27 ± 69. 63 as a one-time donation. Comparison with previous studies is not possible due to difference in contingent scenarios and payment vehicles. The Hedonic Pricing Method (HPM) was employed to identify price premiums for beachfront property in Collaroy-Narrabeen. Significant variation in beachfront price premiums is explained by the variation in erosion risk information linked to property titles. &# 145;Risk-free&# 146; beachfront properties were <b>subject</b> to price <b>premiums</b> around 264 %, relative to an average property in the sample. Properties in the central portion of the beach, which is subject to greater exposure to erosion, were subject to much lower premiums, in the order of 130 %. These figures are substantially higher than those in the published literature, which {{is a function of the}} exclusivity of the Sydney beachfront property market...|$|R
40|$|These essays {{study how}} private {{incentives}} affect {{the functioning of}} three dimensions of health care markets: health insurance, prescription drugs, and the delivery of health care by physicians. In the first chapter, I study the workings of long term health insurance, a form of contracts {{with the potential to}} efficiently insure individuals against reclassification risk, but {{at the expense of other}} limitations like provider lock-in. I empirically investigate the workings of long-term guaranteed-renewable contracts, which are subject to this tradeoff. Individuals are shielded against premium increases and coverage denial as long as they stay with their initial contract, but those that become higher risk are <b>subject</b> to <b>premium</b> increases or coverage denials upon switching, potentially leaving them locked-in with their original network of providers. I provide the first empirical evidence on the importance of this phenomenon using administrative panel data from the universe of the private health insurance market in Chile, where competing insurers offer guaranteed-renewable plans. I fit a structural model to yearly plan choices, and am able to jointly estimate evolving preferences for different insurance companies and supply-side underwriting in the form of premium risk-rating and coverage denial. To quantify the welfare effects of lock-in, I compare simulated choices under the current rules to those in a counterfactual scenario with no underwriting. The results show that consumers would be willing to pay around 13 percent more in yearly premiums to avoid lock-in. Finally, I study a counterfactual scenario where guaranteed-renewable contracts are replaced with community-rated spot contracts, and I find only minor general-equilibrium effects on premiums and on the allocation of individuals across insurers. I argue that these small effects are the result of large levels of preference heterogeneity uncorrelated to risk. In the second chapter, David Silver and I study worker interactions among the medical staff in the emergency department. Using rich administrative case-level data from two hospital-based emergency departments, we start by documenting peer effects among physicians. We find that physicians are 1. 5 percent faster when working with peers who are 10 percent faster. We devise a test for random patient-physician assignment and we provide a number of tests to discern the mechanisms underlying these spillovers. The evidence points to spillovers that are driven primarily by faster peers responding negatively to working with slower peers. Utilization of shared resources accounts for little of the spillover, and event-study evidence points to spillovers that come into effect as soon as slower peers begin their shifts. In the third chapter, José Ignacio Cuesta, Morten Sæthre and I study regulations to pharmaceutical laboratories in the form of bioequivalence (BE) requirements [...] the most prevalent tool used in developed economies to ensure the effectiveness of generic drugs allowed in the market. The main goal is to empirically investigate how the market reacts to BE requirements, and the consequences in prices, market shares, and product availability for branded and generic drugs. In particular, this study is an early exploration of the experience of Chile, where BE requirements were adopted for 172 molecules, leading to the BE approval of 642 generic drugs between March 2009 and March 2015. We show that the introduction of the requirements lead to a significant increase in BE approvals and in the share of BE drugs in the market. However, prices and market shares of other competing drugs were not significantly affected during the period we analyze. Other outcomes, like number of products, and market concentration are also found to be unaffected...|$|R
