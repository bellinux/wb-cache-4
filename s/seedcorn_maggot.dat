40|$|The seed maggot complex, {{composed}} of the <b>seedcorn</b> <b>maggot</b> (Hylemya platura [Meigen]) and the bean seed maggot (/-/. florilega) can damage beans, peas, corn, and cucurbits. Larvae feed on germinating seeds, sometimes destroying growing tips resulting in snakeheads (leafless seedlings). Occasionally, complete seed destruction oc-curs. H. platura, which predominates in western New York, overwinters as a pupariumfrom which afly emerges in early spring (Fig. 1). Although heavy fly populations occur at various times during the planting season, infestations are difficult to predict since weather and soil conditions also in-fluence the degree of injury (1). Also, damage by this pest is not always readily distinguishable from other injuries. Figure 1. —Life stages of the <b>seedcorn</b> <b>maggot,</b> Hylemya platura (Meigen). This report describes and illustrates varying levels of <b>seedcorn</b> <b>maggot</b> damage on eight susceptible crops. We hope that this will aid in the diagnosis of maggot injury. PROCEDURE Seeds were placed on moistened sand in a plastic dish and infested with varying numbers of 1 -day-old <b>seedcorn</b> <b>maggot</b> from a laboratory colony to produce different injury levels. All seeds were pretreated with a fungicide to protect against rots. Infested seeds were covered with 1 / 2 - 1 -inch layer of sand {{and placed in the}} greenhouse until seedling emergence. Damaged seedlings were rated for maggot in-jury and photographed with a healthy plant. In general, in-creasing numbers of maggots decreased vigor and size of the seedlings...|$|E

40|$|Part I. Absolute {{population}} estimates, {{based on}} emergence trapping, {{were made for}} the <b>seedcorn</b> <b>maggot,</b> Hylemya platura (Meigen) (Diptera: Anthomyiidae), during germination in 4 typical Iowa soybean tillage systems (fall moldboard plow, fall chisel plow, till-plant, and no-tillage). The emergence trapping method gave acceptable levels of precision for an intensive sampling program. Although significant differences in emergence were found between tillage systems, numbers of seedcorn maggots present were not a serious problem in any system. Emergence was greatest in the fall chisel-plow system, followed by the till-plant system. Emergence in the no-till and fall moldboard-plow systems was similar. Comparisons of emergence between within-row and between-row areas in these systems suggested that germinating soybeans were not attractive for oviposition under field conditions. Surface corn residue and soil moisture were not significant factors influencing oviposition and development;Part II. Interactive damage effects of stand loss and plumule abscission from <b>seedcorn</b> <b>maggot</b> on soybean (var. Amsoy 71) growth and yield were investigated using actual- and simulated-damage methods. Stand reduction affected seed yield more than did the presence of surviving seedlings without plumules. Over all years, seed yields were greatest at 29. 7 plants per 1 -m row. At all plant stands, the seedlings without plumules were shorter and produced less leaf area, fewer flowers, and fewer pods than did normal plants. This retarded growth reduced leaf area index, flowers per unit area, and pods per unit area. The decrease in pods per unit area was accompanied {{by an increase in}} beans per pod. When some of the surviving seedlings lacked plumules, seed yields were reduced at poor plant stands in some years. Plant-growth characteristics were very similar for actual and simulated damage. Seed-yield comparisons between actual and simulated damage suggested that <b>seedcorn</b> <b>maggot</b> injury to cotyledons had a small, negative effect on seed yield...|$|E

40|$|More {{and more}} corn {{producers}} will be planting hybrids this spring with an insecticide applied {{directly to the}} seed. These seed treatments belong to a class of insecticides known as the neonicotinoids and depending on the rate, they offer the promise of control of <b>seedcorn</b> <b>maggots,</b> wireworms, white grubs, black cutworms, and even corn rootworms. Prevention of cutting and stand loss from soil-dwelling pests is a goal of many corn producers. The seed treatments, such as Cruiser®, Gaucho®, and Poncho®, are systemic in action, meaning that the chemical is absorbed from the seed coat by the growing seedling and transported to the more actively growing sections of the plant, i. e., new leaves and roots...|$|R
40|$|<b>Seedcorn</b> <b>maggots</b> (SCM) {{and bean}} leafbeetles (BLB) can {{substantially}} reduce soybean grain yield in Iowa and surrounding states. SCM feed on germinating seeds {{and the growing}} tips of seedlings, resulting in reduced stands and abnormal plants. Adult bean leaf beetles feed mostly on leaves and pods, with the most serious losses caused by pod feeding. Pod lesions caused by the beetles allow excess moisture and secondary plant disease organ­ isms to enter the pod, causing seed shriveling and discoloration. As a result, seed weight and quality are reduced. The pod feeding problem has increased in severity since the early 1980 s, making the bean leaf beetle the most economi­ cally important insect pest on soybeans in Iowa...|$|R

40|$|The <b>seedcorn</b> <b>maggot</b> (SCM) {{is widely}} {{distributed}} in the corn / soybean growing {{regions of the world}} and has been reported in this country since at least 1855. SCM has a very wide host range, commonly feeding on seeds of beans, peas, and corn, as well as roots of cabbage, radish and onion sets. If fact, many seeds and roots are at risk if this insect is present. The larvae (maggots) develop in the soil and feed on decaying organic matter. They also will attack newly planted seeds both before and after emergence. If feeding occurs before germination the seeds will die. This causes reduced plant populations in the form of ‘skips ’ in the field. If feeding occurs after germination, the resultin...|$|E

40|$|Crucifer root-feeding maggots {{occur in}} field Brassica crops across the prairies, causing the {{greatest}} damage to canola fields {{in central and}} northern Alberta. No chemical options are available for their control in canola. Seed treatments currently utilized for flea beetle control are not efficacious against root maggots, and flies emerge over extended periods, making application of insecticide sprays impractical. Biological and cultural practices are the primary methods of root maggot management in canola. Fall cultivation, the use of vigorous canola cultivars, increased seeding rates, wider row spacings, and suitable fertilization regimes will aid in diminishing root maggot damage. Because natural enemies are an important means of root maggot control, research is needed into co-ordinating cultural management practices with biological control strategies for maximum effectiveness of both strategies and a truly integrated crop management approach to maggot control. Species Composition and Host Range The crucifer-feeding Delia root maggot complex that attacks canola on the prairies comprises five species.

40|$|Effects of {{an early}} season stress on plants were {{evaluated}} by characterizing the response of soybean, Glycine max, to simulated <b>seedcorn</b> <b>maggot</b> (SCM), Delia platura (Diptera: Anthomyiidae), injury. Physiological responses, altered intraspecific competition, and stress interactions were examined in field experiments from 1982 - 1986 in Iowa. Two aspects of SCM injury, stand reduction and plumule destruction (causing formation of a Y-plant with two main stems), were considered. Phenological delay associated with plumule injury contributed to height differences between injured and uninjured plants, which, in turn, lead to substantial differences in many growth parameters. Plant density did not influence plot yields, but stands with increasing proportions of Y-plants had reduced yields in 1982 - 84 but not 1985 - 86. Total pods per plant was most influenced by density and proportion of Y-plants. Results from a replacement series of injured to uninjured plants demonstrated that uninjured plants were competitively superior to injured plants regarding growth and reproductive characteristics. A conceptual basis for categorizing stress interactions was developed. Interactions in weed incidence and weed effects on yield with SCM-injury were observed. Interactions were related to reduced competitive abilities of plants having abscissed plumules. Increases in potato leafhopper (PLH), Empoasca fabae (Homoptera: Cicadellidae), occured with increases in porportions of Y-plants. A phenological delay hypothesis proposes that plumule injury delays soybean development and delayed plants {{are more susceptible to}} PLH because of reduced leaf pubescence. Experiments supported the phenological delay hypothesis...|$|E
40|$|Climate {{change has}} brought about an {{increasing}} level of <b>seedcorn</b> <b>maggot</b> (Delia platura Meigen, 1826) (Diptera: Anthomyiidae) damage in Hungary. In {{order to have a}} more accurate understanding of the effects of these plant injuries induced by the larvae of D. platura, the nutrient content of soybean (Glycine max L. Merill.) was studied. Our results show that the moisture, raw fat, raw fibre, and raw ash content of the batches damaged by D. platura were significantly less in comparison with that of the control samples. In response to the deleterious effect of the insect, the infected soybean plants showed forced ripening (P = 0. 004) (P > 0. 05). The difference of moisture content between damaged and control samples was 2. 30 % on average. The fact of nutritional value loss was also reflected by the alteration of sugar mobilisation. As the result of this experiment the sucrose breakdown to glucose and fructose during the germination was significantly slower in the damaged seeds than that of the control ones. Overall, this late and surprising damage caused by D. platura led to the forced ripening of the affected soybean plants and a significant change in their nutritional values. Based on the herein reported results, it is presumable that in cases when the current climatic extremities, which are envisaged to occur more frequently in the future, and effects of agricultural practices will be coincided in the future a qualitative change of the produced soybean batches can be expected through the damage caused by this fly species...|$|E
