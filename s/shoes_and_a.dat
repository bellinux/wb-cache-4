5|$|Armour {{has been}} {{employed}} in battles in Japan since the Yayoi period. Some {{of the oldest}} extant items from the 4th to the 7th centuries were excavated from kofun and have been designated as archaeological National Treasures. These ancient armours were of two types: a tight fitting solid plate cuirass (tankō) and a skirted lamellar type (keikō), both believed {{to be based on}} Chinese or Korean prototypes. This list includes more recent pieces of armour, developed as result of a trend toward (lamellar) scale armour that began in Japan in the 6th to the 7th centuries and matured in the mid-Heian period (9th to 10th centuries). Combining materials such as leather and silk with iron or steel parts, these armours had the advantage of being light, flexible, foldable and shock absorbent. They were generally lacquered to protect them from the humid climate and were used widely from the late Heian period to the mid-14th century. A complete set consisted of a helmet, mask, neck guard, throat protector, breastplate with shoulder guards, sleeve armour, skirt, greaves, <b>shoes</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> pennant attached to the back.|$|E

25|$|Though {{a dynamic}} stage personality, Atwell was, in person, a shy, {{retiring}} and soft-spoken woman of modesty. Eloquent and intellectual, {{she was well}} read and, unlike many {{in the world of}} professional showbusiness, keenly interested in and informed about issues and current events. Voracious in her reading habits and a devotee of crosswords, she confessed to an inordinate love of mangoes, a dislike of new <b>shoes,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> keen interest in televised cricket (she backed England). She was also a devout Catholic, who unpretentiously played the organ for her parish church.|$|E

The cap may have differed depending on the regiment, but a traditional pattern was the Tricorne to be replaced by the Stovepipe Shako. This too would be replaced in the majority of regiments by the widespread use of the Belgic shako by 1812, as displayed by the 33rd Regiment of Foot. A greatcoat, fashioned in grey wool, would be worn and was normally tied on top of the haversack or knapsack which was carried by the men whilst on the move.|$|E

50|$|A king {{lost his}} wife a long time ago, and {{declared}} he would not marry anyone who did not fit her clothes. One day, their daughter tried on her dress and found it fit. Her father declared he would marry her. At her foster-mother's advice, she put him off with demands for clothing: a dress of swan's down, a dress of moorland canach, a silk dress that stood {{on the ground with}} gold <b>and</b> silver, <b>a</b> gold <b>shoe</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> silver <b>shoe,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> chest that could lock inside and out, and travel over land and sea. When she got the chest, she put her clothing in it and got in herself, and asked her father to put it to sea, so she could see how well it worked. It carried her off to another shore.|$|R

25|$|Rajesh, who is {{normally}} called Raj or just by his surname Koothrappali, is from New Delhi, India. He despises Indian food, and {{his lack of}} knowledge about Indian culture and Hinduism are often rebuked by Sheldon. He was born into a wealthy family and has five siblings, one of whom is Priya, a former on-off girlfriend of Leonard. Raj {{is normally}} seen wearing a layered combination of a shirt and sweater vest, khakis or cargo pants with skate <b>shoes</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> fleece or nylon track top-style windbreaker. Raj wore a red cap in the pilot episode, but has not worn any headgear on a regular basis {{for the rest of the}} series' run.|$|E
25|$|The pope's {{ordinary}} dress (also called house dress), {{which is}} worn {{for daily use}} outside of liturgical functions, consists of a white cassock with attached pellegrina and girded with a fringed white fascia (often with the papal coat of arms embroidered on it), a pectoral cross suspended from a gold cord, red papal <b>shoes,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> white zucchetto. On more formal occasions, the pope may wear a red cape similar to the ferraiuolo except for its gold decoration. Alternatively, he may wear a red cape with a shoulder cape attached. Outdoors, the pope may wear the cappello romano, a wide-brimmed hat used by all grades of clergy. While most other clergy wear a black cappello romano, the pope's is usually red (although {{it may also be}} white).|$|E
25|$|Already in 1883, Eckenfelder had {{exhibited}} his Überschwemmung im Neckarthal (Flooding in the Neckar Valley) at {{the international}} art exhibition in the Glaspalast in Munich. Prince Regent Luitpold of Bavaria purchased his painting Pferde vor dem Pflug (Ploughing Horses) in 1888 and Eckenfelder was {{for the first time}} mentioned in the specialist press. The prince regent took a lively interest in the artistic life of Munich and through such acquisitions supported young artists not only financially, but also with the renown they entailed. He often visited painters in their studios. When he paid his first such visit to Eckenfelder, it was a cold day and the artist was wrapped up against the cold and wearing thick winter slippers; Eckenfelder was so embarrassed that soon after he formed the habit of wearing dress <b>shoes</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> suit with no smock when working. He maintained this habit until late in life.|$|E

25|$|Just {{like the}} cover art, the music video of Vay Anam Vay is {{dominated}} by grey colors, which is only broken by the dark red color of the stage curtains. The video is without a storyline, Tarkan {{can be seen in}} several spots singing, with Liraz Dror in the background on a screen. First, he is seen {{in the middle of a}} virtual corridor in the same shiny grey suit he wears on the album cover. The second location is an attic, where he is sitting on a white sofa. Then he is dancing in an empty room, wearing black trousers, a black vest, sports <b>shoes</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> hat; as well as jeans, a leather coat and a yellow T-shirt with a Bruce Lee motif on it. The fourth location is a virtual stage with dark red curtains, with a screen behind that features Liraz Dror.|$|E
25|$|When {{the video}} {{switches}} {{to the real}} Aguilera, she is seen descending {{from the top of}} a circus tent on a rope, onto the back of an elephant, in Pointe <b>shoes</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> structured jeweled outfit, with her father watching adoringly in the audience. She later attempts to greet him but is pulled away by fans and photographers. The content of the telegram is then revealed to be a message of her father's death, and as Aguilera realizes that she was too wrapped up in her stardom to deal with what matters, she races through the circus in a belated attempt to find her father. Overwhelmed, Aguilera collapses on the ground and then sees a shadow figure of a man {{standing in front of the}} circus tent. Hoping the shadow figure to be her father, Aguilera holds out her hand with the elephant necklace on it in an attempt of reconciliation. She break down crying when she realizes the silhouette has disappeared and that her father is truly gone. The video ends with a shot of Aguilera sitting on a circus box, singing and crying, before fading out to Aguilera's grief-stricken form on the ground outside the circus tent. The camera then zooms out and Aguilera is seen on the ground.|$|E
25|$|OSU ROTC's {{shoulder}} insignia {{was a red}} {{and gray}} circle. This was worn on the right shoulder. On the right sleeve, a five pointed star signifying OSU was {{the recipient of the}} ROTC Honor School award was worn. Near the cuff of the left sleeve, a shield patch with U.S. R.O.T.C embroidered on it was worn. If the cadet had attained a rank in ROTC, they wore their rank insignia on each sleeve. The color of rank chevrons and the ROTC shield patch were determined by the military division in which the cadet was looking to commission. For example, an Artillery cadet would wear a black shield with scarlet lettering and black chevrons on a scarlet background, while an Infantry cadet would wear a black shield with teal lettering and black chevrons on a teal background. The hat took on a more modern look as well, looking more like the modern military style visor hat. ROTC chin straps and uniform buttons were gold colored. The peace eagle remained, but an addition was made to the eagles, an extra banner that arced above the E. Pluribus Unum banner from the eagle’s beak. This banner simply read “OHIO,” earning the OSUMB’s peace eagles the nickname “Eagle Ohio.” These early Eagle Ohios were made in gold colored metal to match the buttons and chin strap of the uniform jacket and hat. The regular uniform of an OSU ROTC cadet included a navy blue service coat, a light blue dress shirt, black tie, navy blue pants, white cotton spats, black dress <b>shoes,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> white canvas belt with a gold buckle.|$|E

500|$|Unlike other {{climbing}} sports, bouldering can {{be performed}} safely and effectively with very little equipment, an aspect which makes the discipline highly appealing to many climbers. Bouldering pioneer John Sherman asserted that [...] "The only gear really needed to go bouldering is boulders".
