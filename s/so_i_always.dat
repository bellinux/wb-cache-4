25|$|In {{the whole}} of the ten years I have been working on radio and television, I have been working to a {{majority}} of women. I think women prefer men to be well-mannered, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> try to watch my manners. They like men to be well dressed, so I do my best to observe this. Others bring to my notice the fact that I sometimes make grammatical errors in my speech; so, because of this, I try to watch my grammar – {{but at the same time}} I bear in mind that it's more profitable for me to be entertaining than to be perfect in my use of English.|$|E
500|$|Regarding {{the musical}} {{arrangements}}, Lafourcade explained, [...] "I {{felt that the}} arrangements had to function as the perfect embrace to the songs... since each song had its own distinct personality. So it was like creating the ideal musical surroundings. I'm very visual with music, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> try to create atmospheres, panoramas, and images. Kind of like creating photographs through music". She stated to Venue Magazine that the album sequence was selected to create a cycle, to have a beginning and an ending. Lissette Corsa of MTVIggy said that the songs are [...] "crafted as expansive, cinematic soundscapes that lend themselves to the mood of each song".|$|E
500|$|Volk {{enrolled}} at the University of Michigan in 1963. His decision to attend Michigan rather than Ohio State was influenced by family ties, including Bob Chappuis, who was Volk's uncle and {{finished second in the}} Heisman Trophy voting while playing for the undefeated 1947 Wolverines. Volk noted:"I had all these stories growing up. He [...] was my hero, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> wanted to go to Michigan. ... And I didn't like Woody [...] anyway. It was just my Grandpa telling me because he didn't like Woody, and he hoped Woody would choke on his Thanksgiving turkey. ... Because of Uncle Bob going to Michigan, that's where I wanted to go. You know, I loved the helmets, loved the uniforms. I said 'Hey, if I could just sit on the bench, that's all I care about.'" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "He's a noble fellow, Greenly, that Comte de Vervillin!" [...] murmured Sir Gervaise, {{in a tone}} of admiration, [...] "and <b>so</b> have <b>I</b> <b>always</b> found him, and <b>so</b> have <b>I</b> <b>always</b> {{reported}} him, too! The fools {{about the}} Gazettes, and the knaves about the offices, may splutter as they will; Mr. de Vervillin would give them plenty of occupation were they here. I question if he mean to keep off in the least, but insists on holding every inch he can gain!" ...|$|R

500|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} was {{directed}} by Joseph Kahn, who revealed that the concept for the music video was created by Spears herself, by saying [...] "I would like to dance {{in a chair and}} drive in a car and break up with [...] boyfriend. [...] Those are your three elements." [...] Kahn ended up creating, according to Jocelyn Vena of MTV, [...] "a semi-futuristic world in which Spears walks into a club, breaks up with her cheating boyfriend and triumphantly walks in the rain, knowing her life is better off without him." [...] Kahn also considered the music video as very sophisticated, saying that it is [...] "definitely a departure from the sort of candy-colored videos she was doing before, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> thought this was the transition between Britney the teenage pop star and Britney the sort of diva she became." [...] An alternate footage of the video {{can be found on the}} DVD of Spears first compilation album [...]|$|E
500|$|In April 1844, Verdi took on Emanuele Muzio, {{eight years}} his junior, as a pupil and amanuensis. He {{had known him}} since about 1828 as another of Barezzi's protégés. Muzio, who in fact was Verdi's only pupil, became {{indispensable}} to the composer. He reported to Barezzi that Verdi [...] "has a breadth of spirit, of generosity, a wisdom." [...] In November 1846, Muzio wrote of Verdi: [...] "If you could see us, I seem more like a friend, rather than his pupil. We are always together at dinner, in the cafes, when we play cards...; all in all, he doesn't go anywhere without me at his side; in the house {{we have a big}} table and we both write there together, and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> have his advice." [...] Muzio was to remain associated with Verdi, assisting in the preparation of scores and transcriptions, and later conducting many of his works in their premiere performances in the US and elsewhere outside Italy. He was chosen by Verdi as one of the executors of his will, but predeceased the composer in 1890.|$|E
500|$|In 1968 Le Mesurier {{was offered}} a role in a new BBC {{situation}} comedy playing an upper-class Sergeant Arthur Wilson in Dad's Army, although he was the second choice after Robert Dorning. Le Mesurier was unsure about taking the part as he was finishing the final series of George and the Dragon {{and did not want}} another long-term television role. He was persuaded both by an increase in his fee—to £26210s (£262.50) per episode—and by the casting of his old friend Clive Dunn as Corporal Jones. Le Mesurier was initially unsure of how to portray his character, and was advised by series writer Jimmy Perry to make the part his own. Le Mesurier decided to base the character on himself, later writing that [...] "I thought, why not just be myself, use an extension of my own personality and behave rather as I had done in the army? <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> left a button or two undone, and had the sleeve of my battle dress slightly turned up. I spoke softly, issued commands as if they were invitations (the sort not likely to be accepted) and generally assumed a benign air of helplessness". Perry later observed that [...] "we wanted Wilson to be the voice of sanity; he has become John".|$|E

6000|$|... "He's a mean chap all the same," [...] {{said the}} footman, [...] "and it an't along {{of him that}} <b>I</b> says <b>so.</b> But <b>I</b> <b>always</b> did admire the missus's sister; and she'd well become the situation." ...|$|R
500|$|Two {{versions}} of the song are present on the album; the English-language version features vocals from English rapper Dizzee Rascal (who also wrote the lyrics of his parts), while the Spanish-language version features El Cata. Speaking about the collaboration, Dizzee Rascal said that [...] "I know it sounds a bit mad now, but you'll see it and see what's going on". He further said [...] "It's me doing something different man, on a merengue tip." [...] In an interview with Billboard, Dizzee Rascal said about Shakira that, [...] "she's {{a bit of a}} trendsetter -- she does loads of different things on a major scale" [...] and added [...] "You'd expect her to use an American rapper , but she chose me. It meant a lot." [...] He then commented about the song that, [...] "I'd like to be in that Spanish market. I got into the whole reggaeton thing when it came out, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> wanted to get around to something like that". [...] "Loca" [...] served as the lead single from Sale el Sol. The Spanish version of the song, featuring El Cata, was released on 10 September 2010. The English version, featuring Dizzee Rascal, debuted later on 13 September 2010.|$|E
500|$|... "Stronger" [...] is a dance-pop and electropop {{song with}} {{a length of}} three minutes and 41 seconds. According to the sheet music {{published}} by Hal Leonard Corporation, it {{is set in a}} common time and has a moderately fast tempo of 116 beats per minute. Written in the key of A minor, it follows the chord progression Am–F–C-G/B. Clarkson's vocals span two octaves, from G3 to G5. The song begins with a [...] "rumbling guitar" [...] and a [...] "shimmering synth" [...] riff as Clarkson sings the opening line [...] "You know the bed feels warmer / Sleeping here alone." [...] Jason Lipshutz of Billboard noted that the guitar riff in the verses is reminiscent of Clarkson's [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] which narrates an anthem of personal reinvention, and dancing. The bridges contain pulsating beats with synth and electric guitar that display some elements of electronic sound. During chorus, the song explodes into an upbeat dance-pop number, complete with guitars and electronic drums as Clarkson sings [...] "What doesn't kill you makes you stronger / Stand a little taller / Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone." [...] Jonathan Keefe of Slant felt nobody else could sell the song's [...] "ginormous chorus" [...] better than Clarkson. Lyrically, [...] "Stronger" [...] explores the theme of moving on from an inimical relationship. In an interview, Clarkson remarked that the song doesn't refer to a specific person, stating [...] "I didn't have a bad breakup or anything, I just think life is about relationships <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> write all about these different ones going on in my life. And I don't have a filter, so it's pretty verbatim." [...] Jason Scott of Blogcritics felt that out of all tracks in Stronger, Clarkson's vocals are best and trendiest in [...] "What Doesn't Kill You (Stronger)".|$|E
2500|$|Manson's lyrics {{deal with}} darker themes, {{often in a}} mocking manner. She credits that to her Scottish psyche that leads to preferring {{depressing}} themes, and the fact she always felt like an outsider, even within Garbage – [...] "I’m the odd one out by default. I’m the only girl, I’m younger than they are, they’ve all {{known each other for}} 40 years, or something crazy like that. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> felt, like, off the centre of things." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, don't say that!" [...] cried Mrs. Clibborn, with a {{positive}} groan. [...] "It sounds <b>so</b> middle-aged.... <b>I</b> <b>always</b> thought Mary was too old for you. A woman should be ten years younger than her husband." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There {{never was}} any one beyond our own selves that loved me <b>so</b> well. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> {{knew it would}} not last--that it ought not; but oh! it was endearing; and I did think to have seen him a shining light!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} disagreeable {{to have it}} in the newspapers," [...] said Parson John. [...] "And then {{he was such a}} {{pleasant}} fellow, and <b>so</b> handsome. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> enjoyed his society when once I had buttoned up my breeches' pocket." ...|$|R
2500|$|Subsequent to {{end of the}} West Indies {{domestic}} season, Australia {{toured the}} Caribbean. Having not been selected for either the Test series or the initial or the first three ODIs, Miller was [...] "surprised" [...] {{to be one of}} three new players called up for the final two ODIs in St Kitts, replacing Suliemann Benn. [...] "I was looking out for it [...] because I had a good season <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> kept my mind in tune for that call so that I won't be surprised," [...] said Miller. [...] "I was disappointed [...] but now that I got the chance I have to take it with both hands." [...] The West Indies had already lost the series 30.|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked for}} her opinion of Bigfoot in a September 27, 2002, {{interview}} on National Public Radio's [...] "Science Friday", Jane Goodall said [...] "I'm sure they exist", and later said, chuckling, [...] "Well, I'm a romantic, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> wanted them to exist", and finally, [...] "You know, why isn't there a body? I can't answer that, and maybe they don't exist, but I want them to." [...] In 2012, when asked again by the Huffington Post, Goodall said [...] "I'm fascinated and would actually love them to exist," [...] adding, [...] "Of course, it's strange that {{there has never been}} a single authentic hide or hair of the Bigfoot, but I've read all the accounts." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Ryan Seacrest, Clarkson stated {{that she and her}} producers strove to record her voice in the album as it is heard at live performances, with as little auto-tune processing as possible, saying [...] "What separates this album are the vocals. They sound richer and fuller, and, for the first time, how I sound when I’m performing live. The producers I worked with just let me sing and be me." [...] Clarkson remarked that [...] "It was a lot of soulful stuff. You know what I'm saying? Like, Radiohead is alternative, but they're very soulful. And Sheryl Crow, very soulful singer-songwriter. So it's all very soulful, rhythmic pop rock." [...] Shortly after the final track listing was revealed, MTV observed that the word [...] "you" [...] featured prominently in the songs' titles. Clarkson asserted [...] "They're all different 'you's'. There's no common, like, it wasn't like one, I didn't have a bad breakup or anything, it wasn't like that. No, I just think life is about relationships, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> write about all these different ones going on in my life and I don't really have a filter. So it's usually very [...]" ...|$|E

2500|$|Since {{coming out}} as a lesbian, Bianca's romantic {{entanglements}} have consisted of sexual confusion, unrequited love, bad timing, and betrayal, including a short-lived romance with Lena Kundera (Olga Sosnovska) and an on-but-mostly-off-screen romantic relationship with Maggie Stone (Elizabeth Hendrickson). The pairing of Reese and Bianca finally allowed the character to be scripted into an on-screen committed relationship. The show had been criticized {{in the past for}} not giving Bianca a full-fledged on-screen romance. When asked by The Advocate if she felt Bianca's pairing with Reese, especially by bringing on a recognized name (Braun), would make a difference, Riegel replied, [...] "I think {{there has to be a}} difference." [...] She responded to the criticism about Bianca's lack of onscreen intimacy with past romantic partners. [...] "I don’t know if the criticism is entirely warranted," [...] she said. [...] "I know I was glad that the show’s priority was in giving me good stories, and I thought that they did go further than anyone else had ever gone, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> thought that they should be commended." [...] Riegel added, however, that she knows the lack of onscreen intimacy between Bianca and the character's past romantic love interests left fans and herself unsatisfied. [...] "She never really got to have the kind of relationship that she deserved," [...] stated Riegel. Riegel said of Bianca's return this time, [...] "you’ll see a couple of things you haven’t seen in a while".|$|E
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> had a {{rough time}} of it, no matter whose watch it was; and {{sometimes}} {{it seemed to me}} that Ritchie's good-natured badgering was pretty nearly as aggravating as Brown's dead-earnest nagging.|$|E
