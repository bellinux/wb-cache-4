50|$|Luther and Reinhold {{agreed that}} {{tax cuts and}} other {{measures}} to stimulate the economy, {{such as the use}} of unemployment funds, were urgently needed. Reinhold suggested a reduction of the value-added tax as well as of the merger tax and the <b>stock</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>tax.</b> He argued that these measures were only possible if the Reichstag was prevented from voting extra expenditures without ensuring offsetting revenues. A change in budget law in this regard proved elusive however, and the coalition parties only agreed that decisions having a considerable fiscal impact were to be discussed between the parties and with the cabinet before being tabled.|$|E
40|$|The study {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of working capital management (WCM) on performance of small medium enterprises (SME’s) in Pakistan. The duration {{of the study is}} seven years from 2006 to 2012. The data used in this study was taken from different sources i. e. SMEDA, Karachi <b>Stock</b> <b>Exchange,</b> <b>tax</b> offices, company itself and Bloom burgee business week. Data of SME’s acquired from these sources forms the foundation of our calculation and then interpretation. As the data was gathered for a period of seven years i. e. 2006 - 2012, the reason for choosing this period was because of the availability of the latest data. The dependent variable of the study is Return on assets which is used as a proxy for profitability. Independent variables were number of days account receivable, number of day’s inventory, cash conversion cycle (CCC) and number of days account payable. In addition to these variables some other variables were used which includes firm size, leverage and growth. Panal data technique is used to study {{the influence of}} WCM on profitability of SME’s. Results suggest that number of day’s accounts payable has positive association with profitability whereas average collection period, inventory turnover and CCC have inverse relation with performance. On the other hand the variable size and growth in sales has positive influence on profitability. In contrast debt ratio has negative impact on profitability...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the Corporation of Foreign Bondholders (CFB), {{an association of}} British investors holding bonds issued by foreign governments. The CFB {{played a key role}} during the heyday of international bond finance, 1870 - 1913, and {{in the aftermath of the}} defaults of the 1930 s. It fostered coordination among creditors, especially in cases of default, arranging successfully for many important debt restructurings, though failing persistently in a few cases. While a revamped creditor association might once again help facilitate creditor coordination, the relative appeal of defection over coordination is greater today than it was in the past. The CFB may have had an easier time than any comparable body would have today.

A significant association is found for the revaluations that occurred in 1992 but not for those that took place in 1988 or 1982 As the tax benefits are probably measured with error, we use the amount of the revaluation to explain stock returns with similar findings. When we extend the period over which we accumulate stock returns from one to two years, the association between stock returns and the amount of the revaluation is significant both in 1992 and in 1982. For the years 1992 and 1982, we also observe a significant association between stock prices and the revaluation amounts. ...|$|R
