5|$|The video {{opens in}} a deserted, {{destroyed}} school hallway with Lee's character shown <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> As the first verse begins, he slowly begins {{to stand up}} and makes his way through the hallway. The boy then sees a female teacher in a classroom who's stricken with fear and closes the door, realizing that the boy is the cause of the damage. As the boy makes his way outside the school building, a police car arrives and the teacher rushes outside to tell the policeman about the boy, who then quickly rides a bicycle home to pack his things. While at home, he sees a news report about the incident, causing him to quickly gather his things to flee. Several policemen then appear outside {{the front door of the}} boy's house, while he tries to escape through the back door. The boy realizes that the door is locked so he uses his telekinetic powers to grab the keys from the kitchen bench. The policemen then enter the house to find that the boy has escaped, but find a teddy bear and a plush frog floating in the air. The final scene shows the boy running away from a SWAT team in the woods. The boy is caught by one of the men who pushes him to the ground. The video ends with the boy using his supernatural powers once again to push the men away in a burst of power; this references how the boy destroyed the school in the first place, as he's in the same position he was in at the beginning of the video. The aftermath of the outburst in the end, however, remains unknown.|$|E
5|$|Young {{started the}} season in the second spot in the Padres {{rotation}} between ace Peavy and Maddux. He pitched his first three turns from the second spot in the rotation. On April 18, he missed his turn and Maddux moved into the second spot in the rotation. Young has since been pitching in the third spot in the rotation. The number three spot in the rotation {{is the only one}} that was not scheduled to start during the Padres visit to Wrigley Field May 12–15, 2008. Young, thus, did not make a start against the Cubs with whom he had an altercation in 2007. On May 21, 2008 in a game against the St. Louis Cardinals, Young was hit in the face by a line-drive from Albert Pujols. Young was <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> for several minutes but was able to leave the field under his own power as he only sustained a nasal fracture and a laceration on his nose. Later in the same inning, Pujols would also sprain the ankle of Padres catcher Josh Bard while sliding into home plate. Young returned to the mound on July 29 with five shutout innings against the Arizona Diamondbacks. Young then did not pitch between August 10 and September 1 due to another disabled list stint and returned to the lineup to take the loss in a game where Greg Maddux, who had become a Los Angeles Dodger, earned his 354th victory to tie Roger Clemens for eighth on the all-time list.|$|E

Camels mate by having both male and female <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> with the male mounting from behind.

25|$|An {{example of}} the {{changing}} perspectives on the Virgin Mary based on specific spiritual views, and its adoption within a culture a world away is {{the transformation of the}} image of Mary from a Heavenly Queen to a mother of humility, and the construction of views to accommodate both perspectives. While depictions of the Virgin Mary as the Queen of Heaven or Coronation of the Virgin by artists such as Paolo Veneziano or Giuliano da Rimini were common {{in the early part of}} the 14th century, they did not fit with the virtue of humility which was a key tenet of the spirituality of Saint Francis of Assisi. The concept of the Virgin of humility was developed in the 14th century in order to accommodate Franciscan piety, by depicting the Madonna <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> rather than a throne. It offered a view of the Virgin Mary (often barefoot) as a mother nursing a child, rather than a Queen in a coronation scene.|$|E
25|$|Following the Allied Invasion of Normandy {{the already}} largely {{depleted}} bomber forces {{had to fly}} support missions of the Heer on the Invasion Front. On 26 June 1944 Pletz was honorably mentioned in the Wehrmachtbericht, an information bulletin issued by {{the headquarters of the}} Wehrmacht. On 10 October 1944, the bomber crews of IX Fliegerkorps were remustered as infantry or as fighter pilots. Peltz, who by training and experience was a bomber expert but admired by Hitler for efficiency in carrying out orders, became the commander of the II. Jagdkorps (2nd Fighter Corps) which saw action during the Ardennes offensive, in particular the Operation Bodenplatte, the attempt to gain air superiority during the stagnant stage of the Battle of the Bulge so that the German Army and Waffen-SS forces could resume their advance. The operation achieved some surprise and tactical success, but was ultimately a failure. A great many Allied aircraft were destroyed on the ground but replaced within a week. Allied aircrew casualties were quite small, since the majority of Allied losses were empty planes <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> The Germans, however, lost many of their fighter pilots that they could not readily replace.|$|E
25|$|In {{their first}} five seasons, the Broncos played their matches at the 32,500 {{capacity}} Lang Park, the ground {{considered to be}} the home of rugby league in Queensland. However, following ongoing conflict with the Queensland Rugby League and Lang Park Trust due to a sponsorship conflict with the QRL having a commercial agreement with Castlemaine XXXX brewery with prominent signs around the ground, while the Broncos were sponsored by rival brewery Powers who were not permitted any permanent signs (the Broncos initially got around this by not using the change rooms at half time during games, instead <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> with a temporary protective banner surrounding them which just happened to have prominent Powers logos), the team relocated to the 60,000 capacity ANZ Stadium in 1993 (ANZ had been the main stadium of the 1982 Commonwealth Games). The club's home match attendance, which had averaged 19,637 at Lang Park, increased to 43,200 at the new ground in the first season following the club's first premiership title in the previous season. However, despite the team's second premiership in 1993, crowds gradually declined and it was not until 2002 that the club again registered more than the 1996 average attendance of 23,712. ANZ Stadium, as the Queensland Sport and Athletics Centre was called at the time due to sponsorship rights, was featured on an episode of The Mole in April 2002.|$|E

500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Early Winter" [...] {{was directed by}} Stefani's frequent collaborator Sophie Muller, who had previously directed the music videos of [...] "Cool" [...] and [...] "Wind It Up". Filming of the music video took place at destinations like Budapest, Milan, and Prague, where Stefani had been touring during The Sweet Escape Tour in October 2007. It opens with a black-and-white scene of Stefani {{lying on the ground}} in a long white gown. In the next scene, Stefani is shown walking on the street under red street lights and then holds her love interest, played by her tour backup dancer Steelo Vazquez, against the wall and talks to him. The scene then changes to Stefani walking on a street and later walking into the railway station. In the next scene, Stefani is seen singing under falling red-coloured feathers in a huge palace-type hall. Scenes of Stefani staring {{at herself in the mirror}} with her hair up and snow falling slowly down, with the lights turning on and off intermittently, are interspersed throughout the video. Stefani is also seen <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> and singing while crying. She is then shown at a railway station walking besides a moving train. The video ends with Stefani running out of the hall. Tamar Anitai from MTV Buzzworthy praised the video for being [...] "acutely artful, immeasurably stylish" [...] and commented that [...] "Gwen’s managed to raise the bar on her own superlatively supreme style in her new video." ...|$|E
2500|$|Salah ("Muslim prayer", informally {{pronounced}} as pl. [...] ), called namāz (...) in some languages, {{is one of}} the Five Pillars in {{the faith}} of Islam and an obligatory religious duty for every Muslim. It is a physical, mental, and spiritual act of worship that is observed five times every day at prescribed times. In this ritual, the worshiper starts standing, bows, prostrates themself, and concludes while <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> During each posture, the worshiper recites or reads certain verses, phrases and prayers. The word salah is commonly translated as [...] "prayer" [...] but this definition might be confusing. Muslims use the words [...] "dua" [...] or [...] "supplication" [...] when referring to the common definition of prayers [...] which is [...] "reverent petitions made to God".|$|E
2500|$|The theatres were {{originally}} {{built on a}} very large scale to accommodate {{the large number of}} people on stage, as well as the large {{number of people in the}} audience, up to fourteen thousand. Mathematics played a large role in the construction of these theatres, as their designers had to be able to create acoustics in them such that the actors' voices could be heard throughout the theatre, including the very top row of seats. The Greek's understanding of acoustics compares very favourably with the current state of the art. The first seats in Greek theatres (other than just <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground)</b> were wooden, but around 499 BCE the practice of inlaying stone blocks into the side of the hill to create permanent, stable seating became more common. They were called the [...] "prohedria" [...] and reserved for priests and a few most respected citizens.|$|E

2500|$|A simple example {{concerns}} the model on which aether was originally built: sound. The speed of propagation for mechanical waves, {{the speed of}} sound, {{is defined by the}} mechanical properties of the medium. Sound travels 4.3 times faster in water than in air. [...] This explains why a person hearing an explosion underwater and quickly surfacing can hear it again as the slower travelling sound arrives through the air. [...] Similarly, a traveller on an airliner can still carry on a conversation with another traveller because the sound of words is travelling along with the air inside the aircraft. This effect is basic to all Newtonian dynamics, which says that everything from sound to the trajectory of a thrown baseball should all remain the same in the aircraft flying (at least at a constant speed) as if still <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> This is the basis of the Galilean transformation, and the concept of frame of reference.|$|E
2500|$|Tarsila's first {{painting}} {{during this}} period was Abaporu (1928), which had been given as an untitled painting to Andrade for his birthday. The subject is a large stylized human figure with enormous feet <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> next to a cactus with a lemon-slice sun in the background. Andrade selected the eventual title, Abaporu, which is an Indian term for [...] "man eats", {{in collaboration with the}} poet Raul Bopp. This was related to the then current ideas regarding the melding of European style and influences. Soon after, Andrade wrote his Anthropophagite Manifesto, which literally called Brazilians to devour European styles, ridding themselves of all direct influences, and to create their own style and culture. Instead of being devoured by Europe, they would devour Europe themselves. Andrade used Abaporu for the cover of the manifesto as a representation of his ideals. The following year the manifesto's influence continued, Tarsila painted Antropofagia (1929), which featured the Abaporu figure together with the negroid figure from Le Negra from 1923, as well as the Brazilian banana leaf, cactus, and again the lemon-slice sun.|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "Project Reborn", Tommy {{learns that}} in order for him and Malina to stop the H.E.L.E., they need a third person to act as a conduit for their power, someone willing to {{sacrifice}} themselves to save the world. Tommy goes back in time two days and saves Noah's life, transporting him seven years into the past to when Angela tested the twins powers. Noah watches as Angela states that there was a third faceless person in her vision and seems to look right at Noah. Tommy explains to Noah that after failing to stop the H.E.L.E. [...] "a thousand times", he realized Noah was the key: if Noah acts as their conduit, they can stop it, but it will be fatal to him. Noah tells Tommy {{to take him to the}} present where he takes Malina's hand. Though Tommy protests, Noah tells him that this is his destiny and Tommy takes his hand. With the power boost from Tommy, Malina fires a blast of energy into the sky through Noah, causing him great pain but successfully shielding the planet from the H.E.L.E. and saving the world. After the future is changed, Tommy and Malina find Noah <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> near death.

The bird represents [...] "something strong, free [...] powerful". Bonacorso added: [...] "She lets it go into the world and that literally letting this force within her go wild. That's an important part of love is that you have to let it go." [...] The video also shows Perry, with a golden dress and cross-shaped earrings, with flames on her body. By the second repetition of the chorus, a bed gets lit on fire, which the director included to refer to love that [...] "can burn you like an inferno". As the song reaches its climax, Perry gets hit by a car, with tiny broken debris from it shattering behind her, while she remains stationary and unharmed. This scene symbolizes the experience of true love, that changes [...] "your world" [...] and [...] "hits you out of the blue". This scene cuts to the ballroom, where Perry is surrounded by a similar explosion of [...] "colorful" [...] flowers, which is used to contrast the more violent nature of falling in love and the softer part of it, the [...] "joyful and wonderful" [...] feelings.|$|E
