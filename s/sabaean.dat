5|$|Cosmas Indicopleustes, a 6th-century Eastern Roman monk {{and former}} {{merchant}} {{who wrote the}} Christian Topography (describing the Indian Ocean trade leading {{all the way to}} China), visited the Aksumite port city of Adulis and included eyewitness accounts of it in his book. He copied a Greek inscription detailing the reign of an early 3rd-century polytheistic ruler of Aksum who sent a naval fleet across the Red Sea to conquer the Sabaeans in what is now Yemen, along with other parts of western Arabia. Ancient <b>Sabaean</b> texts from Yemen confirm that this was the Aksumite ruler Gadara, who made alliances with <b>Sabaean</b> kings, leading to eventual Axumite control over western Yemen that would last until the Himyarite ruler Shammar Yahri'sh (r. c. 265 – c. 287) expelled the Aksumites from southwestern Arabia. It is only from <b>Sabaean</b> and Himyarite inscriptions that we know the names of several Aksumite kings and princes after Gadara, including the monarchs `DBH and DTWNS. Inscriptions of king Ezana mention stone-carved thrones near the Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion in Axum (the platforms of which still exist), and Cosmas described a white-marble throne and stele in Adulis that were both covered in Greek inscriptions.|$|E
5|$|Although Saba' was {{previously}} allied with Aksum against Ḥimyar, both Ḥimyarite and <b>Sabaean</b> troops {{were used in}} the attack against Ḥaḑramawt. Immediately following the conquest of Hadramaut, Sha`ir Awtar allied with Ḥimyar against his former ally GDRT. A second <b>Sabaean</b> inscription from the sanctuary 'Awam in Marib during the reign of Sha`ir Awtar's successor, Luha`atht Yarhum, describes events {{in the latter part of}} his predecessor's reign. The inscription tells of a diplomatic mission sent by Sha`ir Awtar to GDRT, the results of which are unknown; however, the text later goes on to describe a war between Saba' and Aksum in the southern highlands of Yemen, implying that the negotiations were futile. Aksum lost a battle as a result of the Saba'-Ḥimyar alliance, allowing the South Arabian forces to expel GDRT's son BYGT and his forces from the Ḥimyarite capital Zafar, which had previously been held by Aksum after the Aksum-Ḥaḑramawt-Qatabān-Saba' alliance. Despite this loss, Aksum still held territory in South Arabia, as evidenced by inscriptions of Luha`atht Yarhum (r. c. 230), which detail at least one known clash with hbšt troops in Yemen after GDRT's reign. Peace may have been established after GDRT's death, but war and Aksumite involvement was renewed under his successors such as `DBH and GRMT, and the whole 3rd century was to be dominated by Ethio-Yemeni conflicts.|$|E
5|$|Europa Barbarorum {{was first}} {{released}} to the public as an open beta in December 2005. After several more minor releases throughout 2006 which mostly fixed bugs and made small adjustments to the modification, the next major release of Europa Barbarorum was version 0.80 in December 2006. Its changes included the addition of the <b>Sabaean</b> faction, new music, and the inclusion of a new military–industrial complex system. There were three more 0.8-series releases {{during the first half of}} 2007 which primarily made minor adjustments to the modification and fixed bugs. In total, over 135,000 downloads of the 0.80–0.81 versions were tracked.|$|E
50|$|The Minaean {{people were}} one of four ancient Yemeni groups {{mentioned}} by Eratosthenes. The others were the <b>Sabaeans,</b> Ḥaḑramites and Qatabānians. Each of these had regional kingdoms in ancient Yemen, with the Minaeans in the north-west (in Wādī al-Jawf), the <b>Sabaeans</b> to the south-east of them, the Qatabānians to the south-east of the <b>Sabaeans,</b> and the Ḥaḑramites further east still.|$|R
25|$|By {{the third}} century BC, Qataban, Hadramout, and Ma'in became {{independent}} from Saba and established themselves in the Yemeni arena. Minaean rule stretched as far as Dedan, with their capital at Baraqish. The <b>Sabaeans</b> regained their control over Ma'in {{after the collapse of}} Qataban in 50 BCE. By the time of the Roman expedition to Arabia Felix in 25 BC, the <b>Sabaeans</b> were once again the dominating power in Southern Arabia. Aelius Gallus was ordered to lead a military campaign to establish Roman dominance over the <b>Sabaeans.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Virtually {{all modern}} {{scholars}} agree that Sheba was the South Arabian kingdom of Saba, {{centered around the}} oasis of Marib, in present-day Yemen. Sheba was quite known in the classical world, and its country was called Arabia Felix. Around {{the middle of the}} first millennium B.C., there were <b>Sabaeans</b> also in the Horn of Africa, in the area that later became the realm of Aksum. There are five places in the Bible where the writer distinguishes Sheba (שׁבא), i. e. the Yemenite <b>Sabaeans,</b> from Seba (סבא), i. e. the African <b>Sabaeans.</b> In Ps. 72:10 they are mentioned together: [...] "the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts". This spelling differentiation, however, may be purely factitious; the indigenous inscriptions make no such difference, and both Yemenite and African <b>Sabaeans</b> are there spelt in exactly the same way.|$|R
25|$|Between 700 and 680 BC, the Kingdom of Awsan {{dominated}} Aden and {{its surroundings}} and challenged the <b>Sabaean</b> supremacy in the Arabian South. <b>Sabaean</b> Mukarrib Karib'il Watar I conquered the entire realm of Awsan, and expanded <b>Sabaean</b> rule and territory to include much of South Arabia. Lack {{of water in}} the Arabian Peninsula prevented the Sabaeans from unifying the entire peninsula. Instead, they established various colonies to control trade routes.|$|E
25|$|Scholars like Stuart Munro-Hay thus {{point to}} the {{existence}} of an older D'mt or Da'amot kingdom, which flourished in the area between the 10th and 5th centuries BC, prior to the proposed <b>Sabaean</b> migration of the 4th or 5th century BC. They also cite evidence indicating that the <b>Sabaean</b> settlers resided in the region for little more than a few decades. Furthermore, Ge'ez, the ancient Semitic language of Eritrea and Ethiopia, is now known to have not derived from <b>Sabaean,</b> and there is evidence of an Ethiopian Semitic-speaking presence in Eritrea and Ethiopia at least as early as 2000 BC.|$|E
25|$|Evidence of <b>Sabaean</b> {{influence}} {{is found in}} northern Ethiopia, where the South Arabian alphabet, religion and pantheon, and the South Arabian style of art and architecture were introduced. The <b>Sabaean</b> created {{a sense of identity}} through their religion. They worshipped El-Maqah and believed that they were his children. For centuries, the Sabaeans controlled outbound trade across the Bab-el-Mandeb, a strait separating the Arabian Peninsula from the Horn of Africa and the Red Sea from the Indian Ocean.|$|E

25|$|Largely on {{the basis}} of Carlo Conti Rossini's {{theories}} and prolific work on Ethiopian history, Aksum was previously thought to have been founded by <b>Sabaeans,</b> who spoke a language from the Semitic branch of the Afro-Asiatic family. Evidence suggests that Semitic-speaking Aksumites and semiticized Agaw peoples, who originally spoke other Afro-Asiatic languages from the family's Cushitic branch, had already established an independent civilisation in the territory before the arrival of the <b>Sabaeans.</b>|$|R
25|$|The first kingdom {{known to}} have existed in Ethiopia was the kingdom of D'mt, with its capital at Yeha, where a <b>Sabaean</b> style temple was built around 700 BC. It rose to power around the 10th century BC. The D'mt kingdom was {{influenced}} by the Sabaeans in Yemen, however it is not known to what extent. While it was once believed that D'mt was a <b>Sabaean</b> colony, it is now believed that <b>Sabaean</b> influence was minor, limited to a few localities, and disappeared after a few decades or a century, perhaps representing a trading or military colony in some sort of symbiosis or military alliance with the civilization of Dʿmt or some other proto-Aksumite state. Few inscriptions by or about this kingdom survive and very little archaeological work has taken place. As a result, it is not known whether Dʿmt ended as a civilization before Aksum's early stages, evolved into the Aksumite state, or was one of the smaller states united in the Aksumite kingdom possibly around the beginning of the 1st century.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Sabaean</b> Kingdom {{came into}} {{existence}} from at least the 11th century BC. The four major kingdoms or tribal confederations in South Arabia were: Saba, Hadramout, Qataban, and Ma'in. Saba {{is thought to be}} biblical Sheba and was the most prominent federation. The <b>Sabaean</b> rulers adopted the title Mukarrib generally thought to mean unifier, or a priest-king, or the head of confederation of South Arabian kingdoms, the 'king of the kings'. The role of the Mukarrib was to bring the various tribes under the kingdom and preside over them all. The Sabaens built the Great Dam of Marib around 940 BC. The dam was built to withstand the seasonal flash floods surging down the valley.|$|E
25|$|Other {{scholars}} regard Dʿmt as {{the result}} of a union of Afroasiatic-speaking cultures of the Cushitic and Semitic branches; namely, local Agaw peoples and Sabaeans from South Arabia. However, Ge'ez, the ancient Semitic language of Ethiopia, is thought to have developed independently from <b>Sabaean,</b> one of the South Semitic languages. As early as 2000 BC, other Semitic speakers were living in Ethiopia and Eritrea where Ge'ez developed. <b>Sabaean</b> influence is now thought to have been minor, limited to a few localities, and disappearing after a few decades or a century. It may have been a trading or military colony in alliance with the Ethiopian civilization of Dʿmt or some other proto-Aksumite state.|$|E

25|$|There are two dates {{mentioned}} in the “letter of Simeon of Beit Aršam.” One date indicates {{the letter was written}} in Tammuz in the year 830 of Alexander (518/519 CE), from the camp of GBALA (Jebala), king of the ‘SNYA (Ghassanids or the Ġassān clan). In it, he tells of the events that transpired in Najran, while the other date puts the letter’s composition in the year 835 of Alexander (523/524 CE). The second letter, however, is actually a Syriac copy of the original, copied in the year 1490 of the Seleucid Era (= 1178/79 CE). Today, it is largely agreed that the latter date is the accurate one, as it is confirmed by the Martyrium Arethae, as well as by epigraphic records, namely <b>Sabaean</b> inscriptions discovered in the Asir of Saudi-Arabia (Bi’r Ḥimâ), photographed by J. Ryckmans in Ry 507, 8 ~ 9, and by A. Jamme in Ja 1028, which give the old <b>Sabaean</b> year 633 for these operations (said to correspond with 523 CE).|$|E
25|$|Esimiphaios {{was a local}} Christian lord, {{mentioned}} in an inscription celebrating the burning of an ancient <b>Sabaean</b> palace in Marib to build a church on its ruins. Three new churches were built in Najran alone. Many tribes did not recognize Esimiphaios's authority. Esimiphaios was displaced in 531 by a warrior named Abraha, who refused to leave Yemen and declared himself an independent king of Himyar.|$|E
25|$|However, {{archaeology}} {{has revealed}} {{the existence of}} many civilizations in pre-Islamic Arabia (such as Thamud), especially in South Arabia. South Arabian civilizations include Sheba, Himyarite Kingdom, Kingdom of Awsan, Kingdom of Ma'īn and <b>Sabaean</b> Kingdom. Central Arabia was the location of Kingdom of Kindah in the 4th, 5th and early 6th centuries AD. Eastern Arabia was home to the Dilmun civilization. The earliest known events in Arabian history are migrations from the Peninsula into neighbouring areas.|$|E

25|$|The Romans had a {{vague and}} {{contradictory}} geographical knowledge about Arabia Felix or Yemen. The Roman army of 10,000 men was defeated before Marib. Strabo's {{close relationship with}} Aelius Gallus led him to attempt to justify his friend's defeat in his writings. It took the Romans six months to reach Marib and 60 days to return to Egypt. The Romans blamed their Nabataean guide and executed him for treachery. No direct mention in <b>Sabaean</b> inscriptions of the Roman expedition has yet been found.|$|E
25|$|The Ge'ez {{language}} {{is classified as}} a South Semitic language. It evolved from an earlier proto-Ethio-Semitic ancestor used to write royal inscriptions {{of the kingdom of}} Dʿmt in the Epigraphic South Arabian script. The Ge'ez {{language is}} no longer universally thought of, as previously assumed, to be an offshoot of <b>Sabaean</b> or Old South Arabian, and there is some linguistic (though not written) evidence of Semitic languages being spoken in Eritrea and Ethiopia since approximately 2000 BC. However, the Ge'ez script later replaced Epigraphic South Arabian in the Kingdom of Aksum. Epigraphic South Arabian letters were used for a few inscriptions into the 8th century, though not any South Arabian language since Dʿmt. Early inscriptions in Ge'ez and Ge'ez script have been dated to as early as the 5th century BC, and in a sort of proto-Ge'ez written in ESA since the 9th century BC. Ge'ez literature properly begins with the Christianization of Ethiopia (and the civilization of Axum) in the 4th century, during the reign of Ezana of Axum.|$|E
500|$|Alexander Sima {{translates}} {{the text}} slightly differently, specifying {{that it was}} GDRT who [...] "sent a diplomatic mission to [...] in order to form an alliance." [...] Both interpret [...] "Zararan" [...] or [...] "Zrrn" [...] as {{the name of the}} palace in Aksum at the time, parallel to [...] "Sahlen," [...] the palace of Saba in Marib. This Sahlen-Saba parallel, along with the Dhu-Raydan-Ḥimyar parallel, was often used by Aksumite kings in their inscriptions enumerating the territories under their control. A Ḥimyarite inscription confirms the <b>Sabaean</b> text, mentioning that Aksum, Saba', Ḥaḑramawt, and Qatabān were all allied against Ḥimyar. [...] `Alhan Nafhan's son Sha`ir Awtar or Sha`irum Awtar later abandoned the alliance with GDRT after he became king of Saba'. However, during the first part of Sha`ir Awtar's reign, the two powers seem to have joined in an alliance once again, this time against Ḥaḑramawt. Saba's invasion of Ḥaḑramawt with Aksumite help culminated in the latter's defeat and the occupation of its capital, Shabwah, in 225. Sha`ir Awtar's attack represented a major shift in policy as, before the attack, the king of Ḥaḑramawt, Il`azz Yalut, was married to his sister; he had even helped suppress a revolt against Il`azz Yalut.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are also}} several {{historical}} works which {{suggest that a}} Jewish kingdom existed in Yemen during pre-Islamic late antiquity.

In Bayt al-Ḥāḍir, a village situated near Tan‘im, Professor Walter Müller also discovered in the central mosque of the village an important Judeo-Ḥimyarite inscription showing a partial list of the 24-priestly wards described in IChronicles 24, which said inscription happened to be engraved upon a column believed to have formerly belonged to a synagogue. Yet, even here, part of the inscription was embedded in the ground belonging to the mosque. The inscription is believed to date back to the 4th century CE, and attests to the antiquity of the Jews in that area. To that same period belongs another bilingual Sabaean-Hebrew inscription, which Professor Giovānnī Garbinī of Naples discovered in 1970. The inscription is found on a column in Bayt al-Ašwāl near Ẓafār [...] (c. 17km. from the town of Yarim) and shows, interposed on an earlier writing, the words, [...] "The writing of Judah, of blessed memory, Amen shalom amen," [...] engraved in antiquated Assyrian (Hebrew) script in between larger, sculpted <b>Sabaean</b> script.|$|E
