The second error affects only north-western North America for the years 1899 - 1909. Here pressure is again too high compared with reconstructed data. The cause of this error is not immediately apparent, but is probably the result of an erroneous correction to sea level for stations in the region. Both errors seriously affect the homogeneity of the gridded Arctic series.

5|$|Storm surges {{caused by}} extratropical {{cyclones}} {{have been recorded}} along the coastal areas. These storm surges are formed from strong winds that blow towards the land.

The sudestada, which brings the worst storm surges, occurs when there is a high pressure system over southern Argentina in the Atlantic Ocean that interacts with a low pressure over Uruguay and southern Brazil, causing strong winds from the southeast. Storm surges have caused flooding of coastal areas, leading to extensive property loss and other damage. It is also the main natural factor in the erosion of coastlines. The flooding as a result of storm surges are particularly destructive in flat coastal areas such as the Rio de La Plata shores, and the Salado Basin.|$|R
5000|$|The Azores High (Anticiclone dos Açores) {{also known}} as North Atlantic (Subtropical) High/Anticyclone or the Bermuda-Azores High, is a large {{subtropical}} <b>semi-permanent</b> centre of <b>high</b> atmospheric pressure typically found south of the Azores in the Atlantic Ocean, at the Horse latitudes. It forms one pole of the North Atlantic oscillation, the other being the Icelandic Low. The system influences the weather and climatic patterns of vast areas of North Africa and southern Europe, {{and to a lesser}} extent, eastern North America. The aridity of the Sahara Desert and the summer drought of the Mediterranean Basin is due to the large-scale subsidence and sinking motion of air in the system. In its summer position (the Bermuda High), the high is centered near Bermuda, and creates a southwest flow of warm tropical air toward the East Coast of the United States. In summer, the Azores-Bermuda High is strongest. The central pressure hovers around 1024 mbar (hPa).|$|R
5000|$|Bermuda's {{weather is}} largely {{controlled}} by the position {{and structure of the}} Bermuda-Azores High. This <b>semi-permanent</b> <b>high</b> pressure area (often centered southwest of the Azores) extends a ridge westward toward Bermuda during the spring and summer when the high is most intense. Oriented west-to-east to the near south of Bermuda, clockwise flow around the surface high brings prevailing winds from the southwest for much of the summer and subsequently prevents fronts from reaching the island. However, the ridge sometimes shifts {{to the north of the}} island allowing easterly or northeasterly winds. In fall and winter, the ridge near Bermuda becomes more transient, allowing frontal systems to affect the island. Winds around these systems are much more variable (and often stronger) but typically settle out of the southwest ahead of a cold front and shift to the west or northwest behind a cold front.|$|E

40|$|We use an {{ensemble}} of aircraft, satellite, sonde, and surface observations for April&ndash;May 2006 (NASA/INTEX-B aircraft campaign) {{to better understand}} the mechanisms for transpacific ozone pollution and its implications for North American air quality. The observations are interpreted with a global 3 -D chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem). OMI NO 2 satellite observations constrain Asian anthropogenic NOx emissions and indicate a factor of 2 increase from 2000 to 2006 in China. Satellite observations of CO from AIRS and TES indicate two major events of Asian transpacific pollution during INTEX-B. Correlation between TES CO and ozone observations shows evidence for transpacific ozone pollution. The <b>semi-permanent</b> Pacific <b>High</b> and Aleutian Low cause splitting of transpacific pollution plumes over the Northeast Pacific. The northern branch circulates around the Aleutian Low and has little impact on North America. The southern branch circulates around the Pacific High and impacts western North America.

Model simulation of ozone observations at Mt. Bachelor Observatory in Oregon (2. 7 km altitude) indicates a mean Asian ozone pollution contribution of 9 &plusmn; 3 ppbv to the mean observed concentration of 54 ppbv, reflecting mostly an enhancement in background ozone rather than episodic Asian plumes.

5|$|Different {{climatic factors}} {{influence}} {{the climate of}} Buenos Aires. The <b>semi–permanent</b> South Atlantic <b>High</b> influences its climate throughout the year by bringing in moist winds from the northeast, which bring most of the precipitation to {{the city in the}} form of frontal systems during winter or storms produced by cyclogenesis in autumn and winter. The hot temperatures and high insolation in the summer months form a low pressure system called the Chaco Low over northern Argentina, generating a pressure gradient that brings moist easterly winds to the city – because of this, summer is the rainiest season. In contrast, this low pressure system weakens in the winter, which combined with strong southerly winds results in a drier season due to weaker easterly winds. Being located in the Pampas, Buenos Aires has variable weather due to the passage of contrasting air mass – the cold, dry Pampero from the south and warm, humid tropical air from the north. The coastal location results in a strong maritime influence, causing extreme temperatures (hot or cold) to be rare.|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the effects of summertime {{stratocumulus}} over the eastern Pacific. This cloud is linked to the <b>semi-permanent</b> sub-tropical <b>highs</b> that dominate the low-level circulation over the Pacific and Atlantic. Subsidence on the eastern flank of these highs creates an inversion based about 800 m above sea level that caps moist air near the surface. This air overlies cool waters driven by upwelling along the coastal regions of North America. Strong surface north-westerlies mix the boundary layer enough to saturate the air just below the capping inversion. Widespread stratocumulus is thus formed. All calculations were carried out using the GENESIS general circulation model that was run at MSFC. Among the more important properties of the model is that it includes radiative forcing due to absorption of solar radiation and the emission of infrared radiation, interactive clouds (both stratocumulus and cumulus types), exchanges of heat and moisture with the lower boundary. Clouds are interactive {{in the sense that they}} impact the circulation by modifying the fields of radiative heating and turbulent fluxes of heat and moisture in the boundary layer. In turn, clouds are modified by the winds through the advection of moisture. In order to isolate the effects of mid- and high-latitude stratocumulus, two runs were made with the model: one with and the other without stratocumulus. The runs were made for a year, but with perpetual July conditions, i. e., solar forcing was fixed. The diurnal solar cycle, however, was allowed for. The sea surface temperature distribution was fixed in both runs to represent climatological July conditions. All dependent variables were represented at 12 surfaces of constant sigma = p/p(sub O), where p is pressure and p(sub O) is surface pressure. To facilitate analysis, model output was transformed to constant pressure surfaces. Structures no smaller in size than 7. 5 degrees longitude and 4. 5 degrees in latitude were resolved. Smaller features of the circulation were parameterized. The model thus captures synoptic- and planetary-scale circulation features...|$|R

40|$|Collective {{agreements}} {{have played}} a central role in the system of wage formation in Norway for more than fifty years. Although the degree of coordination achieved has been variable, pattern wage bargaining has been a mainstay of the system. We investigate the degree of invariance in wage formation in Norway with respect to two recent structural changes: the transition towards inflation targeting in monetary policy and an unprecedented surge in labour supply due to higher immigration rates. We report empirical results that support the view that a <b>semi-permanent</b> <b>high</b> immigration may affect wages negatively in a significant way. However we do not find evidence that the stability of the arbitration system, and in particular the wage-bargaining pattern, has been changed by labour immigration or by inflation targeting monetary policy. An explanation of why we do not find evidence of structural changing effects of the transition of monetary policy, can be found in the fact that the wage arbitration system itself has syncronized the inflation expectations of the social partners. In that analysis, inflation targeting became a new layer of nominal stabilization, on top of the existing one...|$|E
40|$|Pre-Columbian raised field {{agriculture}} in the tropical lowlands of South America has received increasing attention and {{been the focus of}} heated debates regarding its function, productivity, and {{role in the development of}} pre-Columbian societies. Even though raised fields are all associated to permanent or <b>semi-permanent</b> <b>high</b> water levels, they occur in different environmental contexts. Very few field-based studies on raised fields have been carried out in the tropical lowlands and little is known about their use and past management. Based on topographic surveying and mapping, soil physical and chemical analysis and OSL and radiocarbon dating, this paper provides insight into the morphology, functioning and time frame of the use of raised fields in the south-western Llanos de Moxos, Bolivian Amazon. We have studied raised fields of different sizes that were built in an area near the town of San Borja, with a complex fluvial history. The results show that differences in field size and height are the result of an adaptation to a site where soil properties vary significantly on a scale of tens to hundreds of metres.

40|$|Warm, high {{pressure}} systems are measured from a weather station {{on a high}} elevation peak in the Oregon Coast range during the winter months. Temperature observations on Mary’s Peak show abnormally warm air {{in relation to the}} surrounding areas. The goal {{of this study was to}} characterize the frequency and duration of these warm events around the Oregon Coast range during the cold season between November and February, determine how widespread they were, and to determine the background meteorological conditions which give rise to them. Temperature, relative humidity, height and wind were the main variables of data collected from radiosonde soundings, satellites and various weather stations. These sources showed wind directions, pressure systems, cloud formation and possible inversions which furthered the understanding of how and where the warm air formed. Analyses of the vertical structure of temperature and wind from the National Center for Atmospheric Prediction’s (NCEP) North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) provided high resolution depictions of what occurred during these warm periods. The anomalous warm events that were observed affecting the summit of Mary’s Peak are likely caused by strong subsidence of warming air in the centers of {{high pressure}} ridges.

5|$|The {{climate of}} Buenos Aires is {{dominated}} by the <b>semi–permanent</b> South Atlantic <b>High</b> throughout the year. This brings in moist winds from the northeast, which brings most of the precipitation to the city. During winter, it brings in frontal systems responsible for precipitation in the city. In autumn and summer, it produces storms that are generally located north of the city and produces strong winds from the south or southeast that can occasionally lead to the swelling of the Río de la Plata, flooding coastal areas. The South Pacific High is the origin of polar air masses that are responsible for the coldest temperatures and result in clear and very dry conditions. These air masses originate from the South Pacific high and move in a northeastern direction during winter towards Buenos Aires by passing. Although it is polar maritime (this is a cool, moist air mass that forms from oceans located in the subarctic and arctic regions at the southern tip of South America), it becomes modified as it passes over the South American continent, becoming drier as it arrives at Buenos Aires. This is because as the cold air masses from the South Pacific High move over the Pacific Ocean and the Andes and reach the land south of 35oS (where the Andes are shorter in height), anticyclogenesis leads to the formation of a strong high pressure system {{in the center of the}} country (at around 40oS). This high pressure system brings cold and dry, polar continental air masses to Buenos Aires. Cold fronts are more common during winter than in summer as the South Atlantic and South Pacific highs are at their southernmost positions during summer, making it difficult for cold fronts to enter.|$|R
40|$|The {{existence}} of the Saharan air layer (SAL), a layer of warm, dry, dusty air that frequently moves westward off of the Saharan desert of Africa and over the tropical Atlantic Ocean, has long been appreciated. As air moves over the desert, it is strongly heated from below, producing a very hot air mass at low levels. Because there is no moisture source over the Sahara, the rise in temperature causes {{a sharp drop in}} relative humidity, thus drying the air. In addition, the warm air produces a very strong jet of easterly flow in the middle troposphere called the African easterly jet that is thought to {{play a critical role in}} hurricane formation. In recent years, there has been an increased focus on the impact that the SAL has on the formation and evolution of hurricanes in the Atlantic. However, the nature of its impact remains unclear, with some researchers arguing that the SAL amplifies hurricane development and with others arguing that it inhibits it. The argument for positively influencing hurricane development is based upon the fact that the African easterly jet produces the waves that eventually form hurricanes and that it leads to rising motion south of the jet that favors the development of deep thunderstorm clouds. The potential negative impacts of the SAL include 1) low-level vertical wind shear associated with the African easterly jet; 2) warm SAL air aloft, which increases thermodynamic stability and suppresses cloud development; and 3) dry air, which produces cold downdrafts in precipitating regions, thereby removing energy needed for storm development. As part of this recent focus on the SAL and hurricanes (which motivated a 2006 NASA field experiment), there has been little emphasis on the SAL s potential positive influences and almost complete emphasis on its possible negative influences, almost to the point of claims that the SAL is the major suppressing influence on hurricanes in the Atlantic. Multiple NASA satellite data sets (TRMM, MODIS, and AIRS/AMSU) and National Centers for Environmental Prediction global analyses are used to characterize the SAL s properties and evolution in relation to developing hurricanes. The results show that storms generally form on the southern side of the jet, where favorable background rotation is high. The jet often helps to form the northern side of the storms and rarely moves over their inner cores, so jet-induced vertical wind shear does not appear to be a negative influence on developing storms. Warm SAL air is confined to regions north of the jet and generally does not impact the tropical cyclone precipitation south of the jet. Of the three proposed negative influences, dry air appears to be the key influence; however, the presence of dry SAL air is not a good indicator of whether a storm will weaken since many examples of intensifying storms surrounded by such dry air can be found. In addition, a global view of relative humidity shows moisture distributions in other ocean basins that are almost identical to the Atlantic. The dry zones correspond to regions of descending air on the eastern and equatorward sides of <b>semi-permanent</b> oceanic <b>high</b> pressure systems. Thus, the dry air over the Atlantic appears to be primarily a product of the large-scale flow, but with enhanced drying at low levels associated with the Sahara. As a result, we conclude that the SAL is not a major negative influence on hurricanes. It is just one of many possible influences and can be both positive and negative...|$|R
40|$|Two 3 -dimensional global {{atmospheric}} transport models for {{persistent organic pollutants}} (POPs) have been employed to investigate the association between the large-scale atmospheric motions and poleward transports of persistent semi-volatile organic chemicals (SVOCs). We examine the modeled daily air concentration of α- and γ-hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) over a period from 1997 – 1999 during which a number of episodic {{atmospheric transport}} events were detected in this modeling study. These events provide modeling evidence for improving the interpretation on the cold condensation effect and poleward atmospheric transport of SVOCs at the mid-troposphere. Two episodic transport events of γ-HCH (lindane) to the high Arctic (80 – 90 &deg; N), one from Asian and another from Eurasian sources, are reported in this paper. The both events suggest that the episodic atmospheric transports occurring at the mid-troposphere (e. g. from 3000 – 5500 m height) are driven by atmospheric horizontal and vertical motions. The association of the transport events with atmospheric circulation is briefly discussed. Strong southerly winds, forced by the evolution of two <b>semi-permanent</b> <b>high</b> pressure systems over mid-high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere, {{play an important role}} in the long-range transport (LRT) of HCHs to the high latitudes from its sources. Being consistent with the cold condensation effect and poleward atmospheric transport in a mean meridional atmospheric circulation simulated by a 2 -D atmospheric transport model, as reported by the first part of this study, this modeling study indicates that cold condensation is likely occurring more intensively at the mid-troposphere where rapid declining air temperature results in condensed phase of the chemical over and near its source regions and where stronger winds convey the chemical more rapidly to the polar region during the episodic poleward atmospheric transport events...|$|E
40|$|Plutonium (Pu) is a predominately {{anthropogenic}} element {{produced during}} neutron irradiation of U in reactors and nuclear weapon detonations. Pu {{has been released}} to the environment during nuclear weapon detonations, nuclear reactor accidents, and in association with reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel. The most important source of Pu in the environment were the 543 atmospheric nuclear detonations conducted worldwide in the period 1945 – 1980 by the former Soviet Union (FSU), USA, United Kingdom (UK), China and France. The most intensive period of atmospheric nuclear testing was 1945 – 1962, interrupted by a moratorium during November 1958 to September 1961. This period was dominated by US testing during the premoratorium period and FSU testing during the post-moratorium period. Debris from the atmospheric nuclear detonations was deposited on a local, regional and global scale depending on detonation height, yield and meteorological conditions. The isotopic composition of Pu is source dependent. Pu is produced by neutron capture in 238 U, generating 239 U which rapidly (t 1 / 2 = 23. 5 min) decay to 239 Pu. Heavier isotopes are produced due to neutron capture in this 239 Pu. Heavier isotopes of Pu are successively produced during continued neutron irradiation. Reactor derived Pu would have 240 Pu/ 239 Pu atom ratios reflecting the irradiation history of the fuel (burn up). For technical reasons, the 240 Pu/ 239 Pu atom ratios in weapon purpose Pu has to be below 0. 07. The burn up in weapon production reactors kept low by frequent exchange of the fuel {{in order to ensure}} this. For power production reactors on the other hand, frequent exchange of the fuel is impracticable and uneconomical. The fuel is exchanged after a prolonged irradiation and high burn up. As the proportion of heavier Pu isotopes increase in relation to 239 Pu, all Pu atom ratios, and in particular the 240 Pu/ 239 Pu atom ratios increase; 240 Pu/ 239 Pu atom ratios up to 0. 67 have been reported. Debris from undetonated weapons and low yield detonations would also have low 240 Pu/ 239 Pu atom ratios, similar to the original weapon material. Post detonation Pu atom ratios depend on the yield and design of the device with high yield detonations generally producing Pu with higher 240 Pu/ 239 Pu atom ratios than low yield detonations. Global fallout was the mixed debris injected into the stratosphere by high yield detonations. After a considerable retention time in the stratosphere, this debris was deposited to form a general Pu background with an easily recognizable 240 Pu/ 239 Pu signature of ~ 0. 18. Pu isotopic signatures substantially different from global fallout indicates significant influence from local or regionally deposited Pu from nuclear weapon test sites, reactor accidents or releases from reprocessing. In the present thesis U and Pu isotopic signatures has been utilised for source identification and quantification purposes. The samples employed have been humic surface soils from 45 geographically well distributed sites in Norway (Paper I); an ice core from Austfonna (Svalbard) covering the period 1949 – 1999 (Paper II); and air filter samples from Norway during 1957 - 1963 (Paper III). Radioactive particles have been identified in the air filter samples the ice core samples (Paper II) and (Paper III), while atmospheric dispersion modelling (NOAA HYSPLIT_ 4) has been used to corroborate the source identification in (Paper III). Debris from the Chernobyl accident in 1986 was distributed over vast areas of Europe, including Fenno-Scandinavia. Whereas the deposition of caesium from the Chernobyl accident is known to have been strong in Norway, knowledge of the Pu deposition is scarce. In order to assess the relative importance of sources to Pu deposition in mainland Norway, Pu concentrations and atom ratios in humic surface soil samples collected from 45 geographically well distributed sites were determined by SF-ICP-MS (sector field inductively coupled plasma – mass spectrometry) and AMS (Accelerator mass spectrometry). Pu concentrations in samples collected from the same sites in 1990 and 2005 were compared in order to assess the relative migration of Pu from the surface layers. Pu concentrations (0. 7 – 149 Bq m- 2) were found to be higher at coastal sites with high annual precipitation than at inland sites with lower annual precipitation, this is in accordance with the global fallout theory. The 240 Pu/ 239 Pu atom ratios were found to vary within 0. 161 – 0. 211, mainly in accordance with the global fallout signature. However, at some inland sites Pu atom ratios were found to exceed global fallout Pu signatures, indicating a slight Chernobyl influence. Time resolved samples permit the investigation of variations of deposition and isotopic signatures in deposited debris. Pu and 236 U concentrations and atom ratios were determined by AMS in an Arctic ice core from Austfonna (Svalbard) covering the period 1951 – 1999, and in air filter samples collected during 1957 – 1963. The Austfonna represents an interesting sampling location in its proximity to FSU test site Novaya Zemlya (NZ). In addition tropospheric transport from Eurasia, and possibly the FSU test site in Semipalatinsk (STS) is facilitated by a <b>semi-permanent</b> <b>high</b> pressure area above Siberia during winter. Digital autoradiography indicated the presence of radioactive particles at depths corresponding to atmospheric nuclear testing (1949 – 1962) and the Chernobyl accident or a vented NZ underground detonation (1985 – 1989). Concentrations of Pu and 236 U in the Austfonna ice core (0. 008 to 0. 254 mBq cm- 2 and 0. 0039 to 0. 053 μBq cm- 2 respectively) were found to be higher at depths corresponding to the pre-moratorium period (1956 – 1959) than at depths corresponding to the post- moratorium period (1959 – 1962). This observation contrasts with observations at other sites where the deposition of anthropogenic radionuclides was found to be higher in the post-moratorium period. The discordance either indicates post depositional redistribution or a different depositional regime at the Austfonna glacier than at other sites. The 240 Pu/ 239 Pu atom ratio measured in air filters (0. 0517 – 0. 237) showed a strong dependence on northern hemisphere atmospheric test activities, tending towards a value reflecting stratospheric fallout during periods without atmospheric nuclear testing, and substantially lower ratios in periods associated with atmospheric nuclear testing activities. The lower Pu atom ratios observed during periods of atmospheric nuclear testing indicates significant influence of tropospherically transported Pu from FSU atmospheric nuclear testing. A further indication is provided by the presence of radioactive particles in filters from the autumn and winter seasons of 1961 and 1962, i. e. periods associated with atmospheric testing at FSU test sites NZ and STS. Direct tropospheric transport from FSU test site STS was indicated by high Pu and 236 U concentrations and low 240 Pu/ 239 Pu, 241 Pu/ 239 Pu and 236 U/ 239 Pu atom ratios during November 1962. Atmospheric dispersion modelling (HYSPLIT) using real time meteorological data confirmed the plausibility of this transport, and limited the potential source to three low yield STS test detonations during 30 October – 1 November 1962...|$|E
