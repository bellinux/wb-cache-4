500|$|The film's title {{came from}} the song [...] "Naan Paadum Mouna Ragam", from Ratnam's Idaya Kovil (1985). Although he began work on the script while making Pallavi Anu Pallavi, Mouna Ragam did not begin {{production}} until after Idaya Kovil release. Ratnam said that due to budgetary constraints {{it would have been}} easier to send the female lead to Bangalore instead of Delhi, but he did not want her to be able to easily return to her parents because she could not adjust to her husband. The line [...] "Neenga thottaa kambilipoochi oorraa madhri irukku", spoken by Divya to Chandrakumar, expressed how <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> on her wedding night.|$|E
500|$|The first verse of [...] "I Could Fall in Love" [...] implores {{the object}} of the singer's desire to walk away, because her {{emotions}} are too overpowering and she feels love of unprecedented intensity. She fears that by allowing him to stay attached, she may [...] "lose control". Selena believes that her infatuation can lead to romantic love. She then sings [...] "I could fall in love (in love) with you" [...] before wondering how <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> if she were to touch him for the first time. The fear of being rejected and unloved leads her to keep her feelings to herself, and she begins to believe that her love is [...] "not right". She continues, [...] "and I guess I should try/ to do what I should do/ but I could fall in love/ fall in love with you". During the midpoint break, Selena sings in Spanish that she is always dreaming about him, imagining that he loves her. She sings the chorus twice before the song comes to an end without her ever having come to terms with her loved one.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I do," [...] he replied. [...] "I {{am quite}} sure that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not <b>feel</b> as <b>she</b> does unless you had been guilty of {{something}} very terrible indeed." ...|$|R
60|$|If {{he should}} never touch her again, <b>she</b> reasoned, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> never <b>feel</b> {{attracted}} toward him. She had not loved him, then. It {{had been nothing}} more than a passing hallucination, super-induced by excitement and by personal contact.|$|R
500|$|After this, Very {{told her}} <b>she</b> <b>would</b> soon <b>feel</b> different, explaining, [...] "I am the Second Coming". He {{performed}} similar [...] "baptisms" [...] {{to other people}} throughout Salem, including ministers. It was Reverend Charles Wentworth Upham who finally had him committed.|$|R
2500|$|During a candidates' {{debate for}} {{governor}} in 2006, when asked how <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> if a church pastor endorsed a candidate for governor, Palin said that she [...] "would never support any government effort to stifle our freedom of religion or freedom of expression or freedom of speech," [...] but would caution the pastor that the endorsement could result in [...] "frustration" [...] and [...] "fewer dollars in the offering plate".|$|E
2500|$|... 22 November 1952 â€“ Julia Thomas, 72, {{was being}} treated by Adams (she called him [...] "Bobbums") for {{depression}} after her cat died in early November. On the 19th, Adams gave sedatives so <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> [...] "better {{for it in the}} morning". The next day, after more tablets, she went into a coma. On the 21st he told Thomas' cook; [...] "Mrs. Thomas has promised me her typewriter, I'll take it now". She died at 3am the next morning.|$|E
2500|$|The Diamond on Longs Peak in Colorado is {{the first}} place Davis went alpine-{{climbing}}. It is [...] "the most famous alpine rock climbing destination in Colorado". It is vertical to overhung granite full of cracks {{and at the top}} is [...] After her first experience there at the age of 24, she returned frequently in the summers. She began her free solo experience of the area by soloing Kiener's Route (5.3) [...] on 7 July 2007, working up to harder routes. Next, on 14 July, she free soloed Casual Route (5.10) and returned again on 27 August, after soloing a route on another mountain, to see if <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> more at ease.|$|E
60|$|Anne {{looked at}} Theodora's placid, finely-moulded face {{and tried to}} imagine what <b>she</b> herself <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> like if <b>she</b> were sitting there, waiting for an elderly lover who had, seemingly, taken so long to make up his mind. But even Anne's {{imagination}} failed her for this.|$|R
25|$|Steel's parents, Nina and Jason, {{who work}} as National Health Service audiologists, {{said that she}} was entered in Britain's Got Talent so <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not <b>feel</b> left out as they felt her brother, Joshua, five years older, was more likely to progress. The judges {{preferred}} Hollie's audition and Joshua dropped out.|$|R
60|$|COLONEL. 'Perhaps it is she, Steve! No, that is Alice's voice. Catch, you scoundrel,' and {{he tosses}} him the glove. Alice is shown in, and is warmly acclaimed. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> not <b>feel</b> {{so much at}} ease if she knew who, hand on heart, has {{recognised}} her through the pantry key-hole.|$|R
2500|$|Mercedes begins {{working as}} an escort which Lynsey discovers. Metcalfe {{explained}} that Lynsey comes to Mercedes' rescue when she is at her lowest point and she can see how broken Mercedes is so just hugs her friend. Lynsey begins a relationship with Mercedes' ex-fiance Riley. Metcalfe explained that if Mercedes discovered this <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> [...] "utterly betrayed by Lynsey". Metcalfe revealed that Lynsey and Mercedes learn that Silas will not stand trial. Mercedes feels can confide in Lynsey about the situation and has a few heart-to-hearts with Lynsey as {{she is the one}} person who fully understands the situation. Metcalfe said Lynsey proves how much she cares about Mercedes when she convinces her to see a psychiatrist. Hassan praised the plot saying it was great because of the chemistry between herself and Metcalfe. Metcalfe similarly praised the friendship saying she has loved it and has enjoyed seeing Mercedes and Lynsey form a good bond.|$|E
2500|$|Jade {{has also}} been {{compared}} to other characters in video games. GamePro cited her {{as an example of}} the right way to do female video game characters, along with other female protagonists such as Portals Chell, Half-Life 2s Alyx Vance, and Silent Hill 3s Heather Mason. Kotaku editor Stephen Totillo compared her to Kendra Midori, protagonist of the Avatar video game, describing Midori as a [...] "nature-loving scientist lady" [...] while describing Jade as a [...] "nature-loving photographer," [...] stating that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> at home in the world of Avatar. In an article discussing racial ambiguity in video games, Wired editor Chris Kohler uses Jade as an example of someone whose race is ambiguous, also bringing up a reader's blog post listing Jade in his list of black characters. This caused a [...] "mini-controversy" [...] on the NeoGAF forums, from which Kohler took statements as evidence of the ambiguity. He feels that the developers made Jade racially ambiguous, intending to allow players to see themselves in her.|$|E
2500|$|Nebuchadnezzar II was {{to prove}} himself to be the {{greatest}} of the Chaldean rulers, rivaling another non-native ruler, the 18th century BC Amorite king Hammurabi, as the greatest king of Babylon. He was a patron of the cities and a spectacular builder, rebuilding all of Babylonia's major cities on a lavish scale. His building activity at Babylon, expanding on the earlier major and impressive rebuilding of the Assyrian king Esarhaddon, helped to turn it into the immense and beautiful city of legend. Babylon covered more than three square miles, surrounded by moats and ringed by a double circuit of walls. The Euphrates flowed {{through the center of the}} city, spanned by a beautiful stone bridge. At the center of the city rose the giant ziggurat called Etemenanki, [...] "House of the Frontier Between Heaven and Earth," [...] which lay next to the Temple of Marduk. He is also believed by many historians to have built The Hanging Gardens of Babylon (although others believe these gardens were built much earlier by an Assyrian king in Nineveh) for his wife, a Median princess from the green mountains, so that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> at home.|$|E
25|$|Rose again {{announced}} her intentions to appeal her sentence via her solicitor Leo Goatley in October 2000, although in September 2001, she {{announced her}} intentions to cancel her appeals, stating <b>she</b> <b>would</b> never <b>feel</b> free even if released. Nonetheless, Rose maintains her innocence {{in any of}} the murders for which she was convicted.|$|R
6000|$|Those few gentle sayings {{had brought}} back Theodora's affection {{and sense of}} right. She longed to recall her glance. If it had taken effect she must persevere. She could not endure the humiliation of having a third time trifled with a lover; <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not <b>feel</b> herself sunk into a mere coquette. But what would Violet think! ...|$|R
50|$|Short and pencil-thin, {{she rarely}} ate her own baking. To study {{the work of}} other bakers, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> examine, <b>feel,</b> and smell a piece of pastry and could then make her own version of it without tasting. She {{believed}} that outcomes in baking depend {{on the quality of}} ingredients, and she urged her cookbook readers to use the finest and freshest.|$|R
2500|$|Sackville-West {{constantly}} {{sought to}} improve Woolf's self-esteem, telling {{her not to}} think of herself as a sickly semi-reclusive who needed to hide herself from the world, but rather praised her for her health, her liveliness and sense of wit, her intelligence and achievements as a writer. Sackville-West led Woolf to a reappraisal of herself, helping her to develop a more positive self-image, and a sense that her writings were the products of her strengths, rather than her weakness. From the age of 15 on, Woolf had been led to believe by her father's doctor and her father that reading and writing had a deleterious effect on her nerves, and she needed to engage in physical labour like gardening to prevent a total collapse of her nerves, leading Woolf to spend her time obsessively engaging in physical labor. Woolf tended to push herself relentlessly until illness, whether real or imagined, became the only way that she could relax without guilt. Sackville-West was the first to persuade Woolf that her nervous aliments had been misdiagnosed, and she was better to engage in reading and writing to calm her nerves, advice that was taken. Under her influence, Woolf learned to spend her time switching from one form of intellectual activity to another, from writing a novel to a book review to reading a book, instead of spending her time in physical activities that sapped her strength. In 1925, Sackville-West wrote to Woolf: [...] "Why do you give so much of your energies to the manuscripts of other people? You told me in London that you had at least six novels in your head but were being severe with yourself until you should go to Rodmell. Now you are at Rodmell and what of the six novels? Between Ottoline, Gertrude Stein, and bridal parties which cause you to faint, what time is there for Virginia?" [...] Sackville-West tried to persuade Woolf to learn to relax without guilt, telling her <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> better if she only learned to rest.|$|E
6000|$|... "She has {{not said}} a word to me to the contrary. I only fear <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> that she was being sent there,--as to a convent." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't {{understand}} it at all," [...] Miss Gleason confessed. [...] "But I'm sure there's nothing in it. He isn't her equal. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> that it wasn't right--under the circumstances." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly," [...] she said, but the Doctor was {{now with}} his pupils at Mistress Rivett's. He always left them at eleven of the clock, more shame of Mrs. Rivett {{not to give}} the good man his dinner, which <b>she</b> <b>would</b> never <b>feel.</b> Steadfast had better watch {{for him at the}} gate which opened on the down, for there he could speak more privately and {{securely}} than at home.|$|R
60|$|Young Thomas shaved {{and put on}} his Sunday suit. As soon as it {{was safely}} dark, he hied him away to Adelia Williams. He felt very {{doubtful}} about his reception, but the remembrance of the twinkle in Adelia's brown eyes comforted him. She looked like a woman who had a sense of humour; she might not take him, but <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not <b>feel</b> offended or insulted because he asked her.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was to go}} to Miss Covington. I am {{sure that}} I can say, in her name, that under other {{circumstances}} <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not <b>feel</b> in any way aggrieved at the loss of a property she can well dispense with, especially as the chances of that provision coming into effect were but small, as the child was a healthy little fellow, and in all respects likely to live to come of age." ...|$|R
60|$|I agreed {{entirely with}} Miss Enderton's remark, but I {{could not help}} {{thinking}} of the surprise <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> if she knew of the kind thing that these two women {{were trying to do}} for her.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have thought}} of that," [...] the {{sergeant}} said. [...] "The school enables them to live, but it cannot do much more, so that I should think <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> no reluctance at giving that up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But I cannot give up {{meeting her}} at Epsom. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> it a desertion, and my {{influence}} {{is the best}} hope for her. Besides, I will not sacrifice her to curry favour with the Worthbourne people.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes? What did you say?" [...] asked Ellen, {{trying to}} speak {{naturally}} and off-handedly, and failing completely. She could not meet Rosemary's eyes. She looked down at St. George's sleek back and felt horribly afraid. Rosemary had either said <b>she</b> <b>would</b> or <b>she</b> wouldn't. If <b>she</b> <b>would</b> Ellen <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> so ashamed and remorseful that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be a very uncomfortable bride-elect; and if she wouldn't--well, Ellen had once learned to live without Norman Douglas, but she had forgotten the lesson and felt that she could never learn it again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I {{am going}} in," [...] said the lady. [...] "You {{asked me to}} walk with you, and I refused. You have now waylaid me, and {{therefore}} I shall escape--unless I am prevented by violence." [...] As she spoke she stood still for a moment, and looked into {{his face with a}} smile which seemed to indicate that if such violence were used, within rational bounds, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not <b>feel</b> herself driven to great danger.|$|R
2500|$|Goulding {{dropped out}} of a degree {{programme}} at the University of Kent after two years in order to pursue her musical career. She explained to BBC News Wales, [...] "I'd entered a university talent contest and was spotted by {{some people in the}} audience". She signed a record deal with Polydor Records in July 2009. However, Goulding opted to release lead single [...] "Under the Sheets" [...] on independent label Neon Gold Records so <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not <b>feel</b> under pressure.|$|R
60|$|Well, well! It had to come. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> better afterward! June {{stroked the}} short hair of that shapely head; {{and all the}} {{scattered}} mother-sense in her focussed itself and passed through {{the tips of her}} fingers into the girl's brain.|$|E
60|$|MRS BRIDGENORTH. Certainly not. Reginald: {{you were}} not asked to come; and I have asked you to go. You know how fond I am of Leo; {{and you know what}} <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> if she came in and found you here.|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose Kenneth would enlist too if it weren't for his ankle. I {{think that}} is quite providential. He is his mother's only son and how dreadful <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> if he went. Only sons should never think of going!" ...|$|E
60|$|The infant was buried, {{and then}} there was not much show of {{mourning}} in the house. The poor mother would sit gloomily alone day after day, telling herself that it was perhaps better that she should have been robbed of her treasure than have gone forth with him into the wide, unknown, harsh world with such a father as she had given him. Then <b>she</b> <b>would</b> look at all the preparations she had made,--the happy work of her fingers when her thoughts of their future use were her sweetest consolation,--and weep till <b>she</b> <b>would</b> herself <b>feel</b> that there never could be an end to her tears.|$|R
60|$|Whilst she {{remained}} before the picture, wondering her favourite wonder, how <b>would</b> <b>she</b> <b>feel</b> if this and its accompanying canvases were {{pictures of her}} own ancestors, she was surprised by a light footstep upon the carpet which covered part of the room, and turning quickly she beheld the smiling little figure of Charlotte De Stancy.|$|R
60|$|And the potion proved equally {{ineffective}} on {{mind and}} body, as indeed {{did all the}} manipulations exercised upon a little waxen image {{that was supposed to}} represent M. le Baron. Another figure was offered to Diane, in feminine form, with black beads for eyes and a black plaster for hair, which, when stuck full of pins and roasted before the fire, was to cause Eustacie to peak and pine correspondingly. But from this measure Diane shrank. If aught was done against her rival it must be by her father and brother, not by herself; and <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not <b>feel</b> herself directly injuring her little cousin, nor sinking herself below him whom she loved. Once his wife, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be good for ever, held up by his strength.|$|R
