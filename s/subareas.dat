40|$|At present, {{customized}} <b>subarea</b> {{models have}} been widely used in local transportation planning throughout the United States. The biggest strengths of a <b>subarea</b> model lie in its more detailed and accurate modeling outputs which better meet local planning requirements. In addition, a <b>subarea</b> model can substantially reduce database size and model running time. In spite of these advantages, <b>subarea</b> models remain quite weak in maintaining consistency with a regional model, modeling transit projects, smart growth measures, air quality conformity, and other areas. Both opportunities and threats exist for <b>subarea</b> modeling. In addition to examining <b>subarea</b> models, this paper introduces the decision-making process in choosing a proper <b>subarea</b> modeling approach (windowing versus focusing) and software package. This study concludes that <b>subarea</b> modeling will become more popular in the future. More GIS applications, travel surveys, transit modeling, microsimulation software utilization, and other modeling improvements are expected to be incorporated into the <b>subarea</b> modeling process. <b>subarea</b> model, regional model, SWOT analysis, software evaluation...|$|R

For wines labeled as Bianco Superiore, the yield is further restricted to a maximum of 8 tonnes/ha with a minimum alcohol level of 12%.

25|$|On {{the stock}} Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), {{as well as}} on most 8-bit arcade hardware, {{platform}} games generally only scroll in one direction at a time, usually horizontally. This means designers must use a very narrow level progression, or break levels up into <b>subareas</b> that scrolled either horizontally or vertically, {{as was the case in}} Metroid and Mega Man — or effectively upgrade the system using memory management controller chips, embedded into each relevant cartridge. One of the first platform games to scroll in all four directions freely and follow the on-screen character's movement is in a vector game called Major Havoc, which comprises a number of mini-games, including a simple platformer, a shoot 'em up sequence, a landing sequence, and a Breakout clone. One of the first raster-based platform games to scroll fluidly in all directions in this manner is the previously mentioned 1984 classic, Legend of Kage.|$|E

2500|$|British Columbia is customarily {{divided into}} three main regions, the Interior, the Coast and the Lower Mainland (though the last-named is {{technically}} part of the Coast). [...] These are broken up by a loose and often overlapping system of cultural-geographic regions, often based on river basins but sometimes spanning them. [...] Examples of the former would be the Kootenays, the Okanagan, and the Chilcotin, while of the latter would be the Lillooet Country and Cariboo. [...] Important <b>subareas</b> of these include the Fraser Valley, part of the Lower Mainland, the Fraser Canyon (which overlaps with various regions) and the Robson Valley, which is the uppermost basin of the Fraser River southeast of Prince George. [...] Vancouver Island is seen as its own region within the Coast, as are the Haida Gwaii (Queen Charlotte Islands) and the Gulf Islands.|$|E
2500|$|Mesoamerica can {{be divided}} into smaller {{linguistic}} <b>subareas</b> wherein linguistic diffusion has been especially intense, or where certain families have extended to become predominant. One such subarea would be the Maya area covering the Yucatán Peninsula, all of Guatemala and Belize, and parts of the states of Chiapas and Tabasco, where Mayan languages have been highly predominant. In Chiapas and on the Guatemalan Pacific coast, speakers of Mixe–Zoquean languages were initially dominant, but with the spread of Mayan languages they were pushed out on the fringes of the areas, or into isolated pockets, and the same was the case for speakers of Xinca and Lenca which were probably also spoken in the area in the preclassic period. Another linguistic area is Oaxaca, which is dominated by speakers of Oto-Manguean languages; here Mixe–Zoque speakers were also gradually displaced by speakers of Zapotecan languages, as well as by speakers of Huave and Tequistlatecan languages. Oaxaca is the most linguistically diverse area of Mesoamerica and its [...] contain at least 100 mutually unintelligible linguistic variants. The subarea commonly called Central Mexico, covering valleys and mountainous areas surrounding the Valley of Mexico, originally contained mostly northern Oto-Manguean (Oto-Pamean) languages; however, beginning in the late classic these languages were gradually displaced by Nahuatl, which is now the predominant indigenous language of the area. The Western area was inhabited mostly by speakers of Purépecha and some Uto-Aztecan languages such as Huichol and Nahuatl. The Northern Rim area has been inhabited by semi-nomadic speakers of Uto-Aztecan languages (the Tepiman and Cora-Huichol groups) as well as Pamean (Oto-Mangue), and other languages that are now extinct. The Gulf area is traditionally the home of speakers of Totonacan languages in the northern and central area and Mixe–Zoque in the southern area. However, the northern gulf area became home to the speakers of Huastec in the preclassic period, and the southern area fell under Nahuan dominance in the post-classic period. The Central American area was originally inhabited by speakers of Misumalpan, Jicaquean and Chibchan languages which became subject to dominance and linguistic influence by Maya speaking groups in the classic period. Guerrero does not really constitute its own linguistic area; however, it has been influenced from the Oaxacan, Western or central Mexican area at different times of its history.|$|E

Since existing methods may not be suitable for big traffic data processing, this paper presents a MapReduce-based Parallel Three-Phase K-Means (Par 3 PKM) algorithm for solving traffic <b>subarea</b> division problem on a widely adopted Hadoop distributed computing platform. Specifically, we first modify the distance metric and initialization strategy of K-Means and then employ a MapReduce paradigm to redesign the optimized K-Means algorithm for parallel clustering of large-scale taxi trajectories. Moreover, we propose a boundary identifying method to connect the borders of clustering results for each cluster. Finally, we divide traffic <b>subarea</b> of Beijing based on real-world trajectory data sets generated by 12, 000 taxis {{in a period of}} one month using the proposed approach. Experimental evaluation results indicate that when compared with K-Means, Par 2 PK-Means, and ParCLARA, Par 3 PKM achieves higher efficiency, more accuracy, and better scalability and can effectively divide traffic <b>subarea</b> with big taxi trajectory data...|$|R
