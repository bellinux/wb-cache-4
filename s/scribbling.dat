25|$|Drawing is a {{means of}} making a picture, using any {{of a wide variety of}} tools and techniques. It {{generally}} involves making marks on a surface by applying pressure from a tool, or moving a tool across a surface. Common tools are graphite pencils, pen and ink, inked brushes, wax color pencils, crayons, charcoals, pastels, and markers. Digital tools that simulate the effects of these are also used. The main techniques used in drawing are: line drawing, hatching, crosshatching, random hatching, <b>scribbling,</b> stippling, and blending. A computer aided designer who excels in technical drawing is referred to as a draftsman or draughtsman.|$|E

40|$|<b>Scribble</b> is a {{potential}} tumor suppressor protein, whose loss is a frequent event in late stage cancer development. In both Drosophila and mammalian model systems, <b>Scribble</b> has been shown capable of regulating cell polarity, cell proliferation and apoptosis. Although several interacting partners, including βPiX, have been identified that help to explain how <b>Scribble</b> can regulate cell polarity and migration, {{little is known about}} how <b>Scribble</b> can control cell proliferation. Recent work from our laboratory has shown that <b>Scribble</b> can directly regulate the ERK signaling pathway. This is mediated by a direct protein-protein interaction between <b>Scribble</b> and ERK, which has two components. In the first, <b>Scribble</b> appears to anchor ERK at membrane-bound sites, with the loss of <b>Scribble</b> enhancing ERK nuclear translocation. In the second, <b>Scribble</b> can decrease the levels of active phosphorylated ERK, a function that is dependent upon the ability of <b>Scribble</b> to bind ERK directly. One of the consequences of this activity of <b>Scribble</b> is the inhibition of EJ-ras induced cell transformation. These results provide some of the first direct mechanistic information on how <b>Scribble</b> can regulate cell proliferation and, furthermore, they provide indications as to the identity of other signaling intermediates that may be recruited by <b>Scribble</b> to directly regulate mitogenic signaling pathways...|$|R

40|$|AbstractNeurite {{outgrowth}} {{is mediated}} by dynamic {{changes of the}} cytoskeleton and is largely controlled by Rho GTPases and their regulators. Here, we show that the polarity protein <b>Scribble</b> controls PC 12 cell neurite outgrowth in response to nerve growth factor. <b>Scribble</b> knockdown decreases neurite numbers and increases neurite length. This effect is linked to TrkA the cognate receptor for NGF as pharmacological inhibition of phosphorylated TrkA (pTrkA) reduces <b>Scribble</b> expression. Moreover, <b>Scribble</b> forms a complex with the MAPK components ERK 1 / 2 in a growth factor dependent manner. In RNAi experiments where <b>Scribble</b> expression is efficiently depleted sustained ERK 1 / 2 phosphorylation is reduced. Conversely, siRNA with intermediate <b>Scribble</b> silencing efficiency fails to match this effect indicating that ERK 1 / 2 activation depends on basic <b>Scribble</b> protein levels. Finally, <b>Scribble</b> translocates to the plasma membrane in response to growth factor where it complexes with HRas and Rac 1 suggesting that the phenotype activated by loss of <b>Scribble</b> may {{be a result of}} altered GTPase activity. Together, these results demonstrate a novel role for <b>Scribble</b> in neurite outgrowth of PC 12 cells...|$|R
40|$|<b>Scribble</b> complex {{proteins}} maintain apicobasal polarity, regulate cell fate {{determination and}} function as tumour suppressors in epithelial tissue. Despite evidence that the function of <b>Scribble</b> is maintained in the lymphocyte lineage, we still understand little about {{its role as a}} tumour suppressor in haematological malignancies. Using the Eμ-myc model of Burkitt’s lymphoma we investigated the role of <b>Scribble</b> in lymphomagenesis. We found that contrary to its well-documented tumour suppressor role in epithelial tissue, loss of <b>Scribble</b> expression delayed the expansion of peripheral B cells and delayed the onset of Eμ-myc-driven lymphoma. This was despite upregulated ERK phosphorylation levels in Scribble-deficient tumours, which are associated with loss of <b>Scribble</b> expression and the development of more aggressive Burkitt’s lymphoma. Interestingly, the developmental stage of lymphoma was unaffected by <b>Scribble</b> expression challenging any role for <b>Scribble</b> in fate determination in the haematopoetic lineage. These data provide evidence for oncogenic properties of <b>Scribble</b> in Myc-driven B-cell lymphomagenesis, reinforcing recent findings that overexpression of a mutant form of <b>Scribble</b> can act as an oncogene in epithelial cells. Our results support the growing appreciation that the tumour regulatory functions of <b>Scribble,</b> and other polarity protein family members, are context dependent...|$|R

30|$|The color {{propagation}} domain should induce low costs between pixels {{belonging to}} a single <b>scribble.</b> On the other hand, the cost should be high, when the path crosses a boundary between areas marked with different <b>scribbles.</b> It is therefore important to find such image properties that would be uniform within a single <b>scribble</b> and different between the <b>scribbles.</b> In the work reported here, we select the distinctive properties for every <b>scribbled</b> image using LDA.

40|$|Mammalian <b>Scribble</b> is {{a target}} for {{proteins}} encoded by human papilloma virus, retro- and flaviviruses. Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is a flavivirus that have evolved distinct strategies to escape antiviral responses. Information of how flaviviruses intrude on cell integrity comes from understanding of the roles that host-factors play when they interfere with viruses. The {{first part of this}} thesis describes a novel interaction between the TBEVNS 5 protein and <b>Scribble.</b> The importance of the interaction was demonstrated by RNAi-mediated depletion of <b>Scribble,</b> which prevented suppression of JAK-STAT signaling by NS 5. Together, these results define <b>Scribble</b> as a novel target for NS 5. TBEV is known to cause central nervous system disease TBE in humans that can lead to cognitive dysfunction. A unifying theme in CNS related diseases are defects in neuronal extensions. We therefore addressed the effects of TBEV expression in PC 12 cell differentiation, which is characterized by extensive neurite growth. Our data show that TBEVNS 5 suppresses neurite outgrowth through the Rho GTPase Rac 1. These findings provide evidence that Rac 1 is an indirect target of NS 5 in neurite inhibition. <b>Scribble</b> was recently implicated in spine morphogenesis. Thus, we tested the role of <b>Scribble</b> in neurite elongation. Depletion of <b>Scribble</b> in PC 12 cells, reduced neurite density but increased length of those remaining. Moreover, <b>Scribble</b> bound components in the Ras/ERK cascade in a growth factor dependent manner. Together, these results demonstrate that <b>Scribble</b> controls neurite elongation by scaffolding MAPK components. Moreover, as loss of dendritic spines, actin-rich protrusions on neurons, is a feature in cognitive dysfunction we speculate that cognitive dysfunction in TBE might involve disturbed <b>Scribble</b> expression by NS 5. We also investigated the binding between NS 1 of Influenza A virus and <b>Scribble.</b> The PDZ domains of <b>Scribble</b> are usually selective for specific C-terminal motifs in proteins. Because NS 1 has a canonical PDZ motif we tested if binding to <b>Scribble</b> depends on this motif.
