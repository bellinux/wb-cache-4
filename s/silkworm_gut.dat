50|$|The {{history of}} intrauterine devices {{dates back to}} the early 1900s. Unlike IUDs, early interuterine devices crossed both the vagina and the uterus, causing a high rate of pelvic {{inflammatory}} disease in a time period when gonorrhea was more common. The first IUD was developed in 1909 by the German physician, Richard Richter of Waldenburg. His device was made of <b>silkworm</b> <b>gut</b> and was not widely used.|$|E
40|$|The gut {{microbiota}} has {{a crucial}} role in the growth, development and environmental adaptation in the host insect. The objective of our work was to investigate the microbiota of the healthy <b>silkworm</b> Bombyx mori <b>gut</b> and changes after the infection of B. mori cypovirus (BmCPV). Intestinal contents of the infected and healthy larvae of B. mori of fifth instar were collected at 24, 72 and 144 h post infection with BmCPV. The gut bacteria were analyzed by pyrosequencing of the 16 S rRNA gene. 147 (135) and 113 (103) genera were found in the gut content of the healthy control female (male) larvae and BmCPV-infected female (male) larvae, respectively. In general, the microbial communities in the gut content of healthy larvae were dominated by Enterococcus, Delftia, Pelomonas, Ralstonia and Staphylococcus, however the abundance change of each genus was depended on the developmental stage and gender. Microbial diversity reached minimum at 144 h of fifth instar larvae. The abundance of Enterococcus in the females was substantially lower and the abundance of Delftia, Aurantimonas and Staphylococcus was substantially higher compared to the males. Bacterial diversity in the intestinal contents decreased after post infection with BmCPV, whereas the abundance of both Enterococcus and Staphylococcus which belongs to Gram-positive were increased. Therefore, our findings suggested that observed changes in relative abundance was related to the immune response of silkworm to BmCPV infection. Relevance analysis of plenty of the predominant genera showed the abundance of the Enterococcus genus was in negative correlation with the abundance of the most predominant genera. These results provided insight into the relationship between the gut microbiota and development of the BmCPV-infected silkworm...|$|R

5000|$|The tippet {{connects the}} leader to the fly. Tippet sizes were {{traditionally}} expressed as X sizes in a scale based on <b>silkworm</b> <b>gut</b> leader material, but nowadays gut has been superseded {{by a variety}} of synthetics, mainly monofilaments. Monofilament is calibrated in thousandths of an inch from 0.020" [...] and larger (used for leader butts or in saltwater fishing) to 0.011" [...] (old size 0X) and as small as 0.003" [...] (8X.) Fly fishing records are classed by tippet diameter, not breaking strength, which varies between material and manufacturers. Choice of tippet involves a tradeoff: finer tippets are less visible to the fish, resulting in more strikes, but are more easily abraded and broken. Stiffer or softer tippets may be used depending on water temperature, visibility, and need for abrasion resistance. Some toothy species require specially strong and durable tippets so they will not be bitten through, called shock tippets, made of thick monofilament or stainless steel wire.|$|E
50|$|The {{small fly}} shop {{remained}} at the W. Park Street location {{for less than a}} year. In early 1954, Merton moved the business to a small store on S. 2nd Street that had been relocated from the abandoned town of Cinnabar, Montana a few miles north of Gardiner. By the early 1960s, Merton moved the business into a more permanent structure, its present location at 202 S. 2nd Street, next to the old store, sharing the building with the U.S. Forest Service offices in Gardiner.The fly shop {{was one of the first}} in the region to offer guided float fishing on the Yellowstone River. In 1955, Merton guided his first float clients in a war surplus rubber raft, but quickly transitioned to wooden rowboats and eventually aluminum jonboats. In 1978, Richard began using fiberglass drift boats or dories with his float clients. Although the fly shop has continued its mail order fly business to the present day, especially for locally produced custom flies, its mainstay was always and continues to be servicing local and visiting anglers on the Yellowstone River and Yellowstone National Park waters. Since its opening, flies and fly fishing tackle have changed significantly and Parks' Fly Shop helped its clients transition from bamboo fly rods, to fiberglass, to today's graphite rods. When the shop was opened, fly lines were made of silk and leaders of <b>silkworm</b> <b>gut.</b> Flies were tied with fur, feathers, yarn and floss. Today's flies are innovative combinations of fur, feathers and a myriad of synthetic materials.|$|E
40|$|Enterococcus mundtii {{was shown}} to be {{directly}} correlated with flacherie disease of the silkworm larvae reared on artificial diet supplemented with chloramphenicol. Its identification {{was carried out by}} means of light and electron microscopy and nucleotide sequencing of 16 S gene. The bacterium is capable of rapidly multiplying in the <b>silkworm</b> <b>gut</b> and of invading other body tissues, as demonstrated by deliberate infection of germfree larvae and by subsequent TEM observations. E. mundtii can endure alkaline pH of the <b>silkworm</b> <b>gut</b> and it has been proved to adapt in vitro to commonly applied doses of chloramphenicol, whose use can further contribute to reduce competition by other bacteria in Bombyx mori alimentary canal. The modality of transmission of the infection to the larvae was among the objectives of the present research. Since contamination of the progeny by mother moths can be avoided through routine egg shell disinfection, a trans-ovarian vertical transmission can be ruled out. On the other hand the bacterium was for the first time identified on mulberry leaves, and therefore artificial diet based on leaf powder could be a source of infection. We showed that while microwaved diet could contain live E. mundtii cells, the autoclaved diet is safe in this respect. Being E. mundtii also part of the human-associated microbiota, and since B. mori is totally domestic species, a possible role of man in its epidemiology can be postulated...|$|E
40|$|This work {{describes}} {{a new approach}} to the delivery of light in deeper tissues, through a silk filament that is implantable, biocompatible, and biodegradable. In the present work, <b>silkworm</b> <b>gut</b> fibers (SGFs) of Bombyx mori L., are made by stretching the silk glands. Morphological, structural, and optical properties of the fibers have been characterized and the stimulatory effect of red laser light diffused from the fiber was assayed in fibroblast cultures. SGFs are formed by silk fibroin (SF) mainly in a β-sheet conformation, a stable and non-soluble state in water or biological fluids. The fibers showed a high degree of transparency to visible and infrared radiation. Using a red laser (λ = 650 nm) as source, the light was efficiently diffused along the fiber wall, promoting a significant increment in the cell metabolism 5 h after the irradiation. SGFs have shown their excellent properties as light-diffusing optical fibers with a stimulatory effect on cells...|$|E
40|$|Chlorpyrifos is a {{most widely}} used {{organophosphate}} insecticide because of its cost effectiveness and degradable nature. However, this pesticide enters and contaminates the environment either by direct application, spray drifts or crop run off and shows adverse effect on the non-targeted organisms. Philosamia ricini (eri silkworm), {{one of the most}} exploited, domesticated and commercialized non mulberry silkworm is known for mass production of eri silk. The silkworm larvae get exposed to pesticide residues on the leaves of food plants. The present study investigates the effect of commercial formulation of chlorpyrifos (Pyrifos- 20 EC) on eri silkworm. Initially the LC 50 value of chlorpyrifos was determined at 24 - 96 h and further experiments were carried out with sub lethal concentrations of the chlorpyrifos after 24 h of exposure period. The potential toxicity of chlorpyrifos was evaluated as a fuction of metabolism and nutritional physiology in 3 rd, 4 th and 5 th instar larvae. Alteration in histoarchitecture of 5 th instar eri <b>silkworm</b> <b>gut</b> exposed to sub lethal concentration of chlorpyrifos formulation was also studied. Chlorpyrifos induced genotoxicity in silkworm hemocytes was also investigated by single cell gel electrophoresis, micronuclei assay and apoptosis assay. Herein, LC 50 values of chlorpyrifos were calculated as 3. 83, 3. 35, 2. 68 and 2. 35 mg/L at 24 h, 48 h, 72 h and 96 h respectively. A significant decrease in trehalose activity along with digestive enzyme activity was observed in chlorpyrifos affected groups (P < 0. 05). Further, genotoxicity study revealed higher tail percentage, tail length and tail moment of the damage DNA in chlorpyrifos exposed groups (P < 0. 001). Moreover, at 2. 0 mg/L concentration, ~ 10 fold increases in tail length was observed as compared to the control. Results showed activation of caspase activity following 24 hr chlorpyrifos exposure (1. 5 mg/L and 2. 0 mg/L) in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, in control group less number of apoptotic cells was detected, however in both chlorpyrifos exposed groups number of apoptotic cells were more. Taken together, this study provides evidence that chlorpyrifos pollution might have adverse effect on overall nutritional physiology and genotoxicity of eri silkworm that could lead to reduced survivability of this economically beneficia...|$|E
