50|$|Doc {{returns to}} Thrush, who has fallen ill to the virus. Before {{he has a}} chance to inject her with the serum, the Tyrannosaurus makes its way to the {{construction}} site. Doc battles the creature with a <b>skidsteer</b> but is nearly killed. Thrush joins in with another <b>skidsteer</b> and impales the dinosaur, killing it. Bringing Thrush back into the trailer, she succumbs to the virus and Doc is shot and killed by government soldiers, who then burn his and Thrush's bodies.|$|E

50|$|Backhoe loaders are {{general-purpose}} tools, and {{are being}} displaced to some extent by multiple specialist tools like the excavator and the speciality front end loader, especially {{with the rise of}} the mini-excavator. On many job sites which would have previously seen a backhoe used, a <b>skidsteer</b> (colloquially often called a Bobcat after the most well known manufacturer and inventor of the category) and a mini excavator will be used in conjunction to fill the backhoe's role. However, backhoes still are in general use.|$|E

Fountain Tire also offers servicing {{to a wide variety}} of industrial equipment, as well as foam filling and solid tire pressing at various locations.|$|R
40|$|Abstract â€” Localization and {{wheel slip}} {{estimation}} of a <b>skidsteered</b> mobile robot is challenging {{because of the}} complex wheel/ground interactions and kinematics constraints. In this paper, we present a localization and slip estimation scheme for a skid-steered mobile robot using low-cost inertial measurement units (IMU). We first analyze the kinematics of the skid-steered mobile robot and present a nonlinear Kalman filter (KF) based simultaneous localization and slip estimation scheme. The KF-based localization design incorporates the wheel slip estimation and utilizes robot velocity constraints and estimates to overcome the large drift resulting from {{the integration of the}} IMU acceleration measurements. The estimation methodology is tested and validated experimentally with a computer visionbased localization system. I...|$|R
50|$|NZG {{specializes in}} a wide variety of heavy {{equipment}} types ranging from hand pallet movers, forklifts, scissors lifts, reach stackers, power generators and <b>skidsteers</b> to front loaders, shovels, excavators, graders, and mammoth ore carrying dump trucks. Caterpillar and other engines and machinery are sometimes also made and displayed free-standing. Some offerings, like pavement profilers, road finishers, asphalt strippers, road rollers, pipelayers, large cranes and drill rigs have also been offered, and NZG seems to have the market corner in promoting many models for a variety of manufacturers (Toy Fair 2011). Considering the variety of commercial model vehicles and equipment, one sees that details are intricate and sometimes delicate. To call NZG models 'toys' is too simple - they are precise replicas of the real thing - and quite sophisticated.|$|R

5000|$|... "Bail Ring Tents" [...] {{are usually}} tents that are 100 to 150 ft wide and {{expandable}} to any length. They {{can be made}} from either vinyl or canvas. The purpose of the bail ring style is to raise an enormous amount of material [...] "the tent" [...] off the ground without using heavy machinery. Initially, the center poles are raised and guyed out to stakes after which the tent is spread out and connected to the bail ring using shackles. Once the outside of the tent is raised a crew of men can go under the tent and start raising the bail ring up the center pole using a system of pulleys. This style of tent is not as popular {{as it was in the}} past due to the advancement of forklifts and <b>skidsteers.</b> There was a time when even smaller tents 40 to 100 ft were often raised and set using a bail ring.|$|R
40|$|Outdoor {{mobile robot}} motion {{planning}} and navigation is a challenging problem in artificial intelligence. The search space density and dimensionality, system dynamics and environmental interaction complexity, and the perceptual horizon limitation {{all contribute to}} the difficultly of this problem. It is hard to generate a motion plan between arbitrary boundary states that considers sophisticated vehicle dynamics and all feasible actions for nontrivial mobile robot systems. Accomplishing these goals in real time is even more challenging because of dynamic environments and updating perception information. This thesis develops effective search spaces for mobile robot trajectory generation, motion planning, and navigation in complex environments. Complex environments are defined as worlds where locally optimal motion plans are numerous and where {{the sensitivity of the}} cost function is highly dependent on state and motion model fidelity. Examples include domains where obstacles are prevalent, terrain shape is varied, and the consideration of terramechanical effects is important. Three specific contributions are accomplished. First, a model-predictive trajectory generation technique is developed that numerically linearizes and inverts general predictive motion models to determine parameterized actions that satisfy the two-point boundary value problem. Applications on a number of mobile robot platforms (including <b>skidsteered</b> field robots, planetary rovers with actively articulating chassis, mobile manipulators, and autonomous automobiles...|$|R
