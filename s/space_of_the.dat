5|$|Kiarostami's films often {{reflect upon}} {{immaterial}} {{concepts such as}} the soul and afterlife. At times, however, {{the very concept of}} the spiritual seems to be contradicted by the medium itself, given that it has no inherent means to confer the metaphysical. Some film theorists have argued that The Wind Will Carry Us provides a template by which a filmmaker can communicate metaphysical reality. The limits of the frame and the representation through dialogue with another that is not represented, physically become metaphors for the relationship between this world and those that may exist apart from it. By limiting the <b>space</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mise en scène, Kiarostami expands the <b>space</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> art.|$|E

5|$|A {{large part}} of the {{watershed}} of Darby Creek is on developed land, and many suburbs of Philadelphia are in the watershed. The majority (61%) of the land use is considered residential, while 11% is undeveloped and 10% is open <b>space.</b> <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> remaining land, most of it is considered industrial, commercial, and institutional, with 2.45% classified as paved. Estimates for the population of the watershed range from 484,000 to 500,000. In general, the topography of the watershed consists of rolling land that is densely settled. A large undeveloped tract of land owned by the Delaware County Industrial Development Authority is located {{at the mouth of the}} creek.|$|E

50|$|In practice, all slits are of finite {{length and}} will {{therefore}} produce diffraction on both directions. If <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slit {{is much greater}} than its width, then <b>the</b> <b>spacing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> horizontal diffraction fringes will be much less than <b>the</b> <b>spacing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vertical fringes.

5|$|An {{example of}} this type of {{decomposition}} into interdigitating trees can be seen in some simple types of mazes, with a single entrance and no disconnected components of its walls. In this case both the maze walls and the space between the walls {{take the form of a}} mathematical tree. If the free <b>space</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> maze is partitioned into simple cells (such as the squares of a grid) then this system of cells can be viewed as an embedding of a planar graph, in which the tree structure of the walls forms a spanning tree of the graph and the tree structure of the free space forms a spanning tree of the dual graph. Similar pairs of interdigitating trees can also be seen in the tree-shaped pattern of streams and rivers within a drainage basin and the dual tree-shaped pattern of ridgelines separating the streams.|$|E
5|$|Cobain and Novoselic {{met while}} {{attending}} Aberdeen High, although they never connected, according to Cobain. The pair eventually became friends while frequenting the practice <b>space</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Melvins. Cobain wanted {{to form a}} band with Novoselic, but Novoselic did not respond {{for a long period}} of time. In persuading Novoselic to form a band, Cobain gave him a demo tape of his project Fecal Matter. Three years after the two first met, Novoselic notified Cobain that he had finally listened to the Fecal Matter demo and suggested they start a group. The pair recruited Bob McFadden on drums, but after a month the project fell apart. In early 1987, Cobain and Novoselic recruited drummer Aaron Burckhard. The three practiced material from Cobain's Fecal Matter tape but started writing new material soon after forming.|$|E
5|$|Comcast's {{office space}} was {{designed}} by Daroff Design + DDI Architects and Gensler. Comcast's space is topped by a conference room floor with the executive offices on the four floors below it. Below that are more offices and then, on the 43rd and 44th floors, is Ralph's Cafe, a two-story cafeteria space named after the company founder Ralph J. Roberts. Below the cafe is the training center called Comcast University. The rest of the space is used for content and programing teams, customer service, Technology & Product teams, Finance and Legal. The interior design of the offices are designed {{with a variety of}} shape and color ranging from the open white <b>space</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper offices to the colorful walls of the training center. Other designs include a glass and stainless steel staircase that wraps around a four-story column of flat-screen monitors and connects the executive floors.|$|E

5|$|The church, {{which is}} {{built in the}} Decorated style, has a nave at the west end and a chancel at the east end. It is built from rubble masonry dressed with freestone; the roof is made of slate and edged with stone. There is a porch at {{the west end of}} the south wall of the nave and a vestry at the west end of the north wall of the chancel, {{abutting}} the nave. The nave measures approximately 39feet 8inches by 20feet 8inches (12.10m by 6.30m) and the chancel is shorter and narrower at approximately 18feet by 14feet 1inch (5.50 by 4.30m).

This followed discussion at four War Cabinet meetings (including the 31 October meeting) over the <b>space</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous two months. In order to aid the discussions, the War Cabinet Secretariat, led by Maurice Hankey and supported by his Assistant Secretaries – primarily Sykes and his fellow Conservative MP and pro-Zionist Leo Amery – solicited outside perspectives to put before the Cabinet. These included the views of government ministers, war allies – notably from President Woodrow Wilson – and in October, formal submissions from six Zionist leaders and four non-Zionist Jews.|$|E

5|$|The {{music for}} Digital Devil Saga was principally {{composed}} by Shoji Meguro, {{who had worked}} on multiple previous Megami Tensei titles. Some tracks from the first game were composed by Kenichi Tsuchiya. While he had previously been restricted in his music quality by the limited storage <b>space</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CD medium, Meguro was able to play half the tracks using real-time streaming. For the sound compression, Meguro used ATRAC3 compression software. Using the software, Meguro was able to fit in high-quality music alongside the sound effects and voice track. Nevertheless, he needed to make some compromises on tracks.|$|E

5|$|Vesicles {{sent off}} by the ER {{containing}} proteins are further altered at the Golgi apparatus and then prepared for secretion from the cell or transport {{to other parts of}} the cell. Various things can happen to the proteins on their journey through the enzyme covered <b>space</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Golgi apparatus. The modification and synthesis of the carbohydrate portions of glycoproteins is common in protein processing. The Golgi apparatus removes and substitutes sugar monomers, producing a large variety of oligosaccharides. In addition to modifying proteins, the Golgi also manufactures macromolecules itself. In plant cells, the Golgi produces pectins and other polysaccharides needed by the plant structure.|$|E

5|$|When clocked, {{the phase}} {{accumulator}} (PA) creates a modulo-2N sawtooth waveform {{which is then}} converted by the phase-to-amplitude converter (PAC) to a sampled sinusoid, where N {{is the number of}} bits carried in the phase accumulator. N sets the NCO frequency resolution and is normally much larger than the number of bits defining the memory <b>space</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> PAC look-up table. If the PAC capacity is 2M, the PA output word must be truncated to M bits as shown in Figure 1. However, the truncated bits can be used for interpolation. The truncation of the phase output word does not affect the frequency accuracy but produces a time-varying periodic phase error which is a primary source of spurious products. Another spurious product generation mechanism is finite word length effects of the PAC output (amplitude) word.|$|E
5|$|While {{most of the}} LNC's {{business}} was now operated by road, an agreement on 13 May 1946 allowed the LNC {{to make use of}} SR services from Waterloo to Brookwood station for funerals, subject to the condition that should the service be heavily used the SR (British Railways after 1948) reserved the right to restrict the number of funeral parties on any given train. Although one of the LNC's hearse carriages had survived the bombing it is unlikely that this was ever used, and coffins were carried in the luggage <b>space</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SR's coaches. Coffins would either be shipped to Brookwood ahead of the funeral party and transported by road to one of the mortuaries at the disused cemetery stations, or travel on the same SR train as the funeral party to Brookwood and be transported from Brookwood station to the burial site or chapel by road.|$|E
5|$|The bailey was {{designed}} to include a number of spacious domestic buildings. These include a great hall, a solarium, kitchen, buttery and pantry, with a luxuriously large number of gardrobes and fireplaces. The large towers provided additional accommodation. The design of the domestic buildings was skilfully interlocked to support the defensive arrangements of the bailey. The great hall for example, , {{was placed in the}} strongest position overlooking the river Wye, allowing it to benefit from multiple large windows and a huge fireplace without sacrificing defensive strength. Water for the castle was originally raised from the courtyard well, but was later piped in from a spring across the valley; the castle kitchens had acquired running water {{by the beginning of the}} 17th century. The design of the buildings ensured that the servants and nobility were able to live separately from one another in the confined <b>space</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> castle, revolutionary at the time.|$|E
