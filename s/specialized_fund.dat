We find that investors rely on mutual fund supermarkets to buy highly differentiable funds from small, <b>specialized</b> <b>fund</b> families. Investors ’ use of supermarkets is consistent with efforts to reduce search costs while obtaining the benefits of product focus at the fund origination level.

40|$|Circular dichromatic {{absorption}} difference spectroscopy {{is developed}} {{to measure the}} spin diffusion dynamics of electrons in bulk n-GaAs. This spectroscopy has higher detection sensitivity over homodyne detection of spin-grating-diffracted signal. A model to describe circular dichromatic absorption difference signal is derived and used to fit experimental signal to retrieve decaying rate of spin gratings. A spin diffusion constant of D-s= 201 +/- 25 cm(2) /s for bulk n-GaAs has been measured at room temperature using this technique and is close to electron diffusion constant (D-c), which is {{much different from the}} case in GaAs quantum wells where D-s is markedly less than D-c.

Methods: Their in vitro characterizations and biomimetic properties, simultaneously tumor distribution and pharmacodynamics in tumor bearing mice were elaborately investigated. Results: In vitro characterization {{results showed that}} cP-d-gamma HDL had nano-size diameter, high negative zeta potential and high entrapment efficiency (EE). Furthermore, morphology study indicated that cP-d-gamma HDL did not remodel {{in the presence of}} LCAT, compared with that of paclitaxel-loaded d-gamma HDL (P-d-gamma HDL, not modified). And cellular uptake, together with cytotoxicity toward tumor cells of cP-d-gamma HDL was not affected after interaction with LCAT. Tumor distribution and pharmacodynamics tests revealed that cP-d-gamma HDL possessed specific targeting property and anti-tumor efficacy. Conclusion: cP-d-gamma HDL served to restrain remodeling process and drug leakage, at the same time reinforce the targeting effect, and could act as a potential drug delivery system for cancer therapy...|$|E

Funds that invest globally could achieve better risk-adjusted returns by adding stocks held by more <b>specialized</b> <b>funds</b> within the same family.

40|$|Abstract Background Research {{policy in}} the field of HIV has changed {{substantially}} in recent decades in Switzerland. Until 2004, social science research on HIV/AIDS was <b>funded</b> by <b>specialized</b> <b>funding</b> agencies. After 2004, funding of such research was “normalized” and integrated into the Swiss National Science Foundation as the main funding agency for scientific research in Switzerland. This paper offers a longitudinal analysis {{of the relationship between the}} changing nature of funding structures on the one hand and the production and communication of policy-relevant scientific knowledge {{in the field of}} HIV on the other hand. Methods The analysis relies on an inventory of all social sciences research projects on HIV in Switzerland that were funded between 1987 and 2010, including topics covered and disciplines involved, as well as financial data. In addition, in-depth interviews were conducted with 18 stakeholders. Results The analysis highlights that the pre- 2004 funding policy ensured good coverage of important social science research themes. Specific incentives and explicit promotion of social science research related to HIV gave rise to a multidisciplinary, integrative and health-oriented approach. The abolition of a specific funding policy in 2004 was paralleled by a drastic reduction in the number of social science research projects submitted for funding, and a decline of public money dedicated to such research. Although the public administration in charge of HIV policy still acknowledges the relevance of findings from social sciences for the development of prevention, treatment and care, HIV-related social science research does not flourish under current funding conditions. Conclusions The Swiss experience sheds light on the difficulties of sustaining social science research and multidisciplinary approaches related to HIV without <b>specialized</b> <b>funding</b> agencies. Future funding policy might not necessarily require specialized agencies, but should better take into account research dynamics and motivations in the field of social sciences. </p...|$|R
