60|$|How {{the fire}} {{originated}} {{no one could}} tell, but the instant it was discovered, the captain, who was a brave and able man, took prompt measures for its extinction. But his utmost efforts failed of success, because (the old story) there was no <b>suitable</b> <b>machinery</b> on board for the extinction of fire! The owners of this ship, however, were not, like too many, utterly regardless of human life. On the contrary they had done a great deal--much more than is done by many ship-owners--for the comfort and safety {{of those who had}} entrusted their lives to them. There were boats on board sufficient to carry the entire crew and passengers; and two of these were lifeboats. There was also a large supply of life-buoys and life-jackets; the latter being made of cork, in such a form that the wearers might be able to work in them without inconvenience. But in preparing the ship for sea, fire had not been sufficiently considered. There was no fire-engine aboard. Buckets there were, and these were plied with vigour, but, as we have said, without success.|$|E
60|$|At Aji Bipa the lode runs N. 38º E. (Mag.) in {{the centre}} shaft, and N. 40 E. in the {{southern}} shaft, a sort of fault occurring in the centre shaft. In the northern shaft I should put it at 38º, but from {{the way in which}} the neighbouring rock had cleaved it was difficult to get the strike accurately. The dip is the same in all three shafts, viz. 82º. The lode being so near vertical, it can be clearly traced for the whole depth of the shafts, and is very well defined. The hanging (eastern) wall is highly coloured with iron oxides, and contains many quartz crystals which are through-coloured with the same, and I do not think it at all unlikely that garnets and other gems may be found in it. One or two minute crystals showed a green colour, and might be tourmaline or emerald; but perhaps it was only a surface-colour caused by the presence of copper. The foot wall is very well marked by a strip of whitish yellow clay about an inch in thickness. The rock on both sides of the lode is gold-bearing, and is evidently, as well as the real lode, formed of the debris of old quartz and granites. Talcose flakes are frequent, and in some places it seems to be clearly gneiss. Although with a small plant it might not be profitable to treat this, still with large and <b>suitable</b> <b>machinery</b> it may be made to pay, and the trouble of separating the rich lode from the inferior stone avoided. One remarkable trait in the lode is the manner in which it splits into blocks and slabs, all the faces of the quartz pebbles being cloven in precisely the same plane.|$|E

40|$|AbstractDirecting at the {{problems}} {{that it is hard}} to determine fault type if the vibration of aero-engine's rotor system is over standard during the maintenance testing, a fault diagnosis approach based on kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) feature extraction and multi-class support vector machines (SVM) is proposed. This method first takes the use of nonlinear feature extraction of KPCA to extract the feature of testing cell standard fault samples. By computing the inner product kernel functions of rotor vibration signal's original feature space, the nonlinear map of rotor vibration signal transformed from low dimensional feature space to high dimensional feature space is achieved. The nonlinear principal components of original feature are obtained by performing PCA on the high dimensional feature data. Then, the nonlinear principal components are taken as eigenvectors of multi-class SVM to perform training and test. During the training period, optimize the relatively parameter by adopting cross optimization algorithm to find out the best penalty parameter and kernel function parameter. A high classification accuracy of training set and test set is sustained, overfitting and underfitting are avoided. Experiment results indicated that this method had good performance in distinguishing different fault modes for high-speed rotor, and was <b>suitable</b> for <b>machinery's</b> state recognition...|$|R

40|$|The {{giant reed}} is a {{herbaceous}} energy crop that demonstrates a good adaptability for areas of central-northern Italy. However, {{its size and}} stem resistance to cutting pose problems for harvesting in relation both to the availability of <b>suitable</b> <b>machinery</b> and costs of the operation. A technical and economic evaluation has been conducted of a harvesting system based on an experimental machine, the biotriturator, developed by University of Bologna {{in collaboration with the}} Nobili Company (Bologna, Italy) and adapted to field operating conditions. The harvesting system consists of cutting-shredding and baling in a single pass. The system was evaluated by performing a winter harvest when the crop was in quiescence and had a low moisture content. The total harvesting costs were evaluated as 11. 6 € Mg- 1 dry biomass. Given that the estimated area that can be covered by the harvesting system was 123 hectares per year the system represents an effective solution for not very large areas and is therefore suitable for the Italian environment where average farm sizes are slightly over seven hectares (ISTAT, 2011) ...|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} {{and study}} finite d-volumes - the high dimensional generalization of finite metric spaces. Having developed a <b>suitable</b> combinatorial <b>machinery,</b> we define ℓ_ 1 -volumes {{and show that}} they contain Euclidean volumes and hypertree volumes. We show that they can approximate any d-volume with O(n^d) multiplicative distortion. On the other hand, contrary to Bourgain's theorem for d= 1, there exists a 2 -volume that on n vertices that cannot be approximated by any ℓ_ 1 -volume with distortion smaller than Ω̃(n^ 1 / 5). We further {{address the problem of}} ℓ_ 1 -dimension reduction in the context of ℓ_ 1 volumes, and show that this phenomenon does occur, although not to the same striking degree as it does for Euclidean metrics and volumes. In particular, we show that any ℓ_ 1 metric on n points can be (1 + ϵ) -approximated by a sum of O(n/ϵ^ 2) cut metrics, improving over the best previously known bound of O(n n) due to Schechtman.

40|$|In {{the area}} of multivariate {{modelling}} of living arrangements and family transfers, we are inevitably led towards a desire, or need, for complexity in model specification and hence difficulty in estimation. This complexity arises because we generally wish to represent the situations of multiple actors (decision makers), for example, an older person or couple and their several children, and, possibly, the children’s parents-in-law as well. Furthermore, each actor may engage {{in one or more}} of a set of multiple activities of interest, including co-residence, financial transfers, or the provision of personal-care services. The spatial proximity of members of a kin group may be a further outcome of interest. Thus, we are faced with jointly modelling what may be an array of discrete and continuous (or truncated) outcomes of varying numbers over varying numbers of individual decision makers (when we look across observations in, say, a cross-sectional data file). Yet, the econometrics literature provides a number of tools with which to formulate estimable models, and provides estimation algorithms, for most or all of the situations that might arise in the preceding substantive context. Software with which to estimate all the potential variants of these models may not be readily available, which can be a major problem. Nonetheless, the binding constraint at the margins of applied work in this area is more likely to come from data limitations than from a lack of <b>suitable</b> econometric <b>machinery.</b> Data sets may not include information on all the actors of interest, or may do so but provide too littl...|$|R
40|$|Due {{to short}} growing season {{harvesting}} two crops sequentially {{in one year}} is not common in Sweden. In this experiment a cropping system was designed where rye was grown as a first crop for production of biomass feedstock for bioenergy. Aim {{of the study was}} to design a cropping system that can increase overall crop production and provide food, feed, energy and non-market ecosystem services such as increase annual carbon input and reduce leaching loss of nitrogen in the soil. With these ideas a field experiment was conducted in 2014 - 15 in Dybäck, southern part of Sweden. Rye was planted as first crop in September 2014 and harvested in green condition for energy production at the end of May, 2015. Blue lupin, soybean, black bean, lentil and buckwheat were selected as second crops and were grown in between June to September, 2015. It was an interdisciplinary research work. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used for this study. A literature search was conducted to collect preliminary data to assess sustainability of double cropping system using Sustainability Assessment of Food and Agriculture systems (SAFA) as a concept. Quantitative method was used for determining crop yield and crop residues. Qualitative method was used to investigate possible motives and constraints that might influence farmers’ decision to adopt double cropping system through semi-structured interviews. According to the literatures reviewed, conventional double cropping system requires a high level of water consumption and fertilizer utilization. This system also emits a high quantity of GHG. However, due to high soil coverage the system may enhance soil quality and protects soil from land degradation. Double cropping system also supports a large number of diverse species such as beetles and spiders. Increase yield could result in rise in net income. It should be noted that overall outcome of the double cropping system can greatly vary depending on the country/region, climate, soil, choice of the crops/varieties and, cultivation system (irrigated/non-irrigated, tillage/non- tillage, organic/conventional). Grain yield of lentil was highest (1. 7 t/ha) among all the crops. Grain yield of buckwheat, black bean, soybean and blue lupin were 1. 3 t/ha, 0. 9 t/ha, 0. 6 t/ha and 0. 5 t/ha respectively. Production of crop residues was highest in buckwheat (3. 2 t/ha). Crop residues production of lentil, black bean, soybean and blue lupin were 2. 1 t/ha, 1. 1 t/ha, 1. 1 t/ha and 0. 8 t/ha respectively. Highest annual C input in the soil was determined in buckwheat (304. 2 kg/ha). Annual C input in the soil by lentil, blue lupin, black bean and soybean were 214. 5 kg/ha, 121. 7 kg/ha, 107. 7 kg/ha and 101. 2 kg/ha respectively. Amount of available N was determined for three crops: buckwheat, lentil and soybean at the depth of 0 - 60 cm. Total amount of available nitrogen in buckwheat, soybean and lentil were 14. 3 kg/ha, 11. 3 kg/ha and 9. 6 kg/ha respectively. Crops residues are suitable for animal feed and energy production. Results from five interviews demonstrated that absence of market, lack of <b>suitable</b> <b>machineries</b> to handle second crops and lack of knowledge of double cropping system might be the major barriers of potential adoption of bioenergy double cropping system by the farmers who are growing rye for production of biomass feedstock for bioenergy production...|$|R
