Typical Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) catalyst with a mean particle size of 76 μm and a density of 1400 kg/m 3 was used. Both single and double-drainage protocols were tested. The local pressure drop and bed surface collapse height were acquired throughout the bed settling. Typical results were found regarding dense phase voidage of a fluidised bed and the bed surface collapse velocity. In addition, bubble fraction was calculated based on the collapse curve. Experimental results showed that windbox effect is significantly reduced compared to previous works since the volume of air within the windbox was reduced. The comparison of single/double-drainage protocols revealed a new period in the defluidisation of Geldart-A particles concerning gas compressibility.

40|$|Overflow of Northern Component Water, the {{precursor}} of North Atlantic Deep Water, {{appears to have}} varied during Neogene times. It {{has been suggested that}} this variation is moderated by transient behavior of the Icelandic mantle plume, which has influenced North Atlantic bathymetry through time. Thus pathways and intensities of bottom currents that control deposition of contourite drifts could be affected by mantle processes. Here, we present regional seismic reflection profiles that cross sedimentary accumulations (Björn, Gardar, Eirik, and Hatton Drifts). Prominent reflections were mapped and calibrated using a combination of boreholes and legacy seismic profiles. Interpreted seismic profiles were used to reconstruct <b>solid</b> <b>sedimentation</b> rates. Björn Drift began to accumulate in late Miocene times. Its average sedimentation rate decreased at ? 2. 5 Ma and increased again at ? 0. 75 Ma. In contrast, Eirik Drift started to accumulate in early Miocene times. Its average sedimentation rate increased at ? 5. 5 Ma and decreased at ? 2. 2 Ma. In both cases, there is a good correlation between sedimentation rates, inferred Northern Component Water overflow, and the variation of Icelandic plume temperature independently obtained from the geometry of diachronous V-shaped ridges. Between 5. 5 and 2. 5 Ma, the plume cooled, which probably caused subsidence of the Greenland-Iceland-Scotland Ridge, allowing drift accumulation to increase. When the plume became hotter at 2. 5 Ma, drift accumulation rate fell. We infer that deep-water current strength is modulated by fluctuating dynamic support of the Greenland-Scotland Ridge. Our results highlight the potential link between mantle convective processes and ocean circulation...|$|E

In this work, the occurrence and fate of seven emerging 2 -hydroxyphenyl substituted BZT-UVs were investigated in a Chinese WWTP. This group of hydrophobic BZT-UVs possess log K-ow values ranging from 4. 31 to 7. 67 which could be associated with their fate in WWTPs. Field samples including 24 h flow composites of influent, effluent and grab sludge samples from different treatment processes were collected and analyzed.

50|$|Unhindered {{settling}} is {{a process}} that removes the discrete particles in a very low concentration without interference from nearby particles. In general, if the concentration of the solutions is lower than 500 mg/L total suspended <b>solids,</b> <b>sedimentation</b> will be considered discrete. Concentrations of raceway effluent total suspended solids (TSS) in the west are usually less than 5 mg/L net. TSS concentrations of off-line settling basin effluent are less than 100 mg/L net. The particles keep their size and shape during discrete settling, with an independent velocity. With such low concentrations of suspended particles, the probability of particle collisions is very low and consequently the rate of floculation is small enough to be neglected for most calculations. Thus the surface area of the settling basin becomes the main factor of sedimentation rate. All continuous flow settling basins are divided into four parts: inlet zone, settling zone, sludge zone and outlet zone (Figure 2).|$|R
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of using hydrochloric acid (HCl), heat, dilution and magnetic stirring for the pre-treatment of palm oil mill Effluent (POME) before the primary anaerobic treatment {{was investigated in}} this study. The theoretical background of oily water emulsion which is the characteristic of POME was reviewed. A range of experiments was performed on samples made up of different combinations {{of the three major}} components of POME namely, palm oil, solid from decanter and water. The results suggest that the development of a pre-treatment system to remove the 0. 5 - 1. 2 % residue oil and 3 - 4 % solid matter from the fresh POME is feasible thus it could improve the efficiency of further downstream POME treatment. Experiments were conducted to examine the rate of oil flotation from the mixtures of different ratios of palm oil and water treated with different concentrations of HCl, and temperatures and magnetic stirring. Similarly, a series of experiments were performed to determine the rate of solid settlement from palm oil-solid mixture, solid-water mixture and palm oil-solid-water mixture of different ratios treated with different concentrations of HCl and different temperatures. The data obtained from the experiments were used to determine the optimum dosage of HCl used and the temperature required for best oil recovery and solid settlement. From the kinetic studies, the models of the kinetic rate of palm oil flotation and solid settlement were derived. A macro kinetic modeling was adapted to the oil flotation while a power model was used for solid settling. The results showed that treatment with 0. 5 % HCl was sufficient to increase the rate of oil flotation significantly in Palm oil-water mixture. However, the effect was dependent on the oil-water ratio. An increase in temperature gave higher rate of oil flotation but not as great as that of HCl treatment. Dilution was found to be the two other factors that affected the rate of flotation. The solid settling rates in all tested samples were not significantly affected when they were treated with HCl. The rate of solid settlement was found to be temperature dependent. The optimum temperature for the rate of <b>solid</b> <b>sedimentation</b> was found to be in the region of 800 C.

40|$|Melt {{convection}} {{and solid}} phase movement {{play an important}} role in solidification processes, which significantly influence the formation of grain structures and solute segregations. In general, the melt convection and grain movement are a result of buoyancy forces. The densities within melt are different due to the variation of temperature and concentration, leading to thermally and solutally driven melt convection. Similarly, the density differences between the grains and the bulk melt cause the grain movement, leading to <b>solid</b> <b>sedimentation</b> or grain floating, as the case may be. Free, unattached solid grains are produced by partial remelting and fragmentation of dendrites, by mechanical disturbances such as stirring or vibration and by heterogeneous nucleation of grains in solidification of grain-refined alloys. In this way, movement of solid crystals during solidification can be ascertained in the following two cases. In the first case, during columnar solidification of non-grain-refined alloys, solid movement is possible in the form of dendrite fragments detached from the columnar stalks by the process of remelting and fragmentation. Movement of grains during columnar solidification gives rise to altogether different microstructure from columnar to equiaxed. In the second case, during equiaxed solidification of grain-refined alloys, the movement of solid crystals is possible in the form of equiaxed dendrite crystals nucleated due to presence of grain refiners. The rate and manner by which the free solids settle (or float) will influence macrosegregation in metal castings. Control of the solidification process is possible through an understanding of the solid movement and its effect on macrosegregation and microstructure. With this viewpoint, the overall objective of the present thesis is to study, experimentally and numerically, the phenomenon of solid phase movement during solidification. Through this study, deeper insights of the role of solid phase movement in solidification are developed which can be used for possible control of quality in castings. Both columnar and equiaxed solidification are considered. Models for transport phenomena associated with columnar solidification with solid phase movement are rarely found in the literature, because of inherent difficulty associated with consideration of microscopic features such as remelting and fragmentation. To tackle this problem, solidification modules for remelting and fragmentation are developed first, followed by integration of these molecules in a macroscopic solidification model. A Rayleigh number based fragmentation criterion is developed for detachment of dendrite fragments from the developing mushy zone, which determines the conditions favorable for fragmentation of dendrites. The criterion developed is a function of net concentration difference, liquid fraction, permeability, growth rate of mushy layer, and thermophysical properties of the material. The effect of various solidification parameters on fragmentation is highlighted. The integrated continuum model developed is applied to stimulate the solidification of aqua-ammonia system in a side-cooled rectangular cavity. The numerical results are in good qualitative agreement with those of experiments reported in literature. A gentle ramp of the mushy zone due to settling of solid crystals, as also noticed in experimental literature, is observed towards the bottom of the cavity. The influence of various modeling parameters on solid phase movement and resulting macrosegregation is investigated through a parametric study. Movement of grains during columnar solidification gives rise to altogether different microstructure and sometimes may initiate a morphological transition of the microstructure from columnar to equiaxed if the number and size of equiaxed grains ahead of the columnar front become sufficient to arrest the columnar growth. The generalised model developed, considering solid phase movement during columnar solidification is used to predict columnar-to-equiaxed transition (CET) based on a prescribed cooling rate criterion. It is found that presence of convection significantly affects the solidification behaviour. Moreover, the movement of dendrite fragments and their accumulation at the columnar front further trigger the occurrence of CET. Cooling configuration, too significantly affects the nature of CET. In unidirectional solidification cases, the locations of CET are found to be in a plane parallel to the chill face. However, for the case of the non-unidirectional solidification (as in side-cooled cavity), the locations of CET need not be in a plane parallel to the chill face. In contrast to fixed columnar solidification, equiaxed solidification is poorly understood; in particular, the phenomena associated with solid crystal movement. Movement of unattached solid crystals, formed due to heterogeneous nucleation on grain-refiners, is induced by the convective currents as well as by buoyancy effects, causing the solid to sediment or to float, depending on density of solid compared to that of the bulk melt. While moving in the bulk melt these crystals can also remelt or grow. A series of casting experiments with AI-based alloys are performed to investigate the role and influence of movement of solid crystals on macrosegregation and microstructure evolution during equiaxed solidification. Controlled experiments are designed for studying, separately, settling and floatation of equiaxed crystals for different cooling conditions and configurations. Further, these experiments are carried out in convective and non-convective cases to understand the effect of convection on solid phase movement. Temperature measurements are performed at various locations in the mould during the experiments. After the cavity is solidified, microstructural and chemical analyses of the experimental samples are carried out, several notable features are observed in temperature histories, macrosegregation pattern, and microstructures due to settling/flotation phenomenon of solid crystals. It is found that the flow behavior of solid grains has a profound influence on the progress of solidification (in terms of grain size distribution and fraction eutectic) and macrosegregation distribution. In some cases, the induced flow due to solid phase movement can cause a flow reversal. The observations and quantitative data obtained from experiments, with the help of detailed solidification conditions provided, can be used for future validations of models for equiaxed solidification. Subsequently, numerical studies are carried out, using a modified version of the macroscopic model developed for columnar solidification with motion of solid crystals, to predict the transport phenomena during equiaxed solidification. The model is applied to simulate the solidification processes corresponding to each of the experimental cases performed in this study. For a better understanding of the phenomenon of movement of solid crystals, the following two special cases of solidification are also presented: 1) without movement of solid crystals and 2) movement of solid crystals without any relative velocity between solid and liquid phases. The numerical predictions showing nature of flow field and progress of solidification are substantiated by the experimental data for the thermal analysis, qualitative microstructural Images and quantitative microstructural analysis. It is concluded, with the help of various experiments and simulations, that movement of solid crystals influences the casting quality appreciably, in terms of macrosegregation and microstructures. It is expected that the improved understanding of the role and influence of solid phase movement during solidification processes (both columnar and equiaxed) obtained through this thesis will be useful for possible control of quality of as-cast products...|$|E

40|$|Particles mobilized by {{stormwater}} {{negatively affect}} receiving surface waters. Stormwater {{best management practices}} (BMPs) can reduce solids along with associated pollutants in runoff but engineers and environmental managers have been long vexed by the problem of choosing the optimal BMP for a given situation. A common BMP process for <b>solids</b> removal is <b>sedimentation.</b> This thesis addresses {{the question of whether}} the effectiveness (and thus choice) of a sedimentation device can be estimated (and thus optimized) from the particle size properties of runoff, which, in turn, could be associated with specific runoff zones or land uses. Presented here is a series of experiments to determine the solids-removal capabilities of a manufactured oil-water separator that also removes <b>solids</b> via <b>sedimentation.</b> A statistical model developed from the experimental data shows that, under normal operating conditions, influent particle size can be used to accurately estimate effluent total suspended solids (TSS) for BMPs of this type. Relationships between particle size and particle-bound metal concentrations for Cu, Zn and Pb were then obtained from the literature and incorporated into the model to allow estimates of metal removal efficiencies based on TSS and PSD. The model can be used with an arbitrary particle size distribution (PSD); this allows effluent quality predictions to be made considering that particle sizes entering stormwater BMPs could vary due to anthropogenic, hydraulic or hydrologic factors. To place these experimental and modeling results in the context of an urban environment, samples of deposited stormwater solids were collected from residential areas, commercial areas and an industrial zone in Portland, Oregon, and the PSD of each sample was determined using light obstruction particle sizing. PSDs ranging over sizes from 3 μm to 200 μm vary among these locations. Areas with high anthropogenic impact were found to have PSDs skewed toward the smallest particle sizes. The statistical model developed here was then used to show that the effluent quality of the BMP tested would differ depending on the locations where solids were collected.

30|$|Stormwater {{retention}} ponds, {{also called}} wet detention ponds, {{are among the}} most widely used Best Management Practices (BMP) for stormwater management (USEPA 1999; Scholes et al. 2003). Sedimentation is the primary removal mechanism in wet detention ponds for several stormwater pollutants, but depending on the substance properties, processes like adsorption, microbial degradation, and volatilization can also be important (Scholes et al. 2008). Removal of suspended solids (TSS) and other pollutants associated with <b>solids</b> via <b>sedimentation</b> depends mainly on the hydraulic retention time (HRT), with longer HRT leading to higher removal rates (e.g. USEPA 1999; Vollertsen et al. 2007). One of the major characteristics of stormwater runoff is the high temporal and spatial variability of hydraulic flow and pollutant concentrations (e.g. He et al. 2010; Gnecco et al. 2005; Jacobsen 2011; Wium-Andersen et al. 2011). Various relationships have been proposed in the literature to link stormwater quality to different catchment attributes such as land use, rainwater quality and traffic loads (especially for roads and highways), and to forcing functions such as rainfall intensity (when the release of pollutants from a surface is assumed to be linked to the raindrop energy), runoff volume (when pollutant release is assumed to be dependent on the runoff stress on the catchment surface), antecedent rainfall volume and antecedent dry periods (ADP) (e.g. Vaze and Chiew 2003; Ouyang 2003; Gnecco et al. 2005; Goonetilleke et al. 2005; Obropta and Kardos 2007; He et al. 2010, 2011). The latter is commonly used to estimate the mass of particulate pollutants that are available on the catchment surfaces, which, as confirmed by the measurements carried out by Vaze and Chiew (2002), increases during dry weather with an asymptotic behavior. The importance of ADP is magnified in areas characterized by long dry periods and high intensity rainfall events (Sabin et al. 2005).|$|R

30|$|Heavy metals are {{considered}} one of the most common and hazardous pollutants in industrial effluents that might cause serious problems to the sewage network pipelines. The deleterious effects of heavy metals on biological processes are complex and generally related to species, solubility and concentration of the metal and the characteristics of the influent, such as pH, as well as presence and concentration of other cations and/or molecules and suspended solids (Gikas 2008). Metal toxicity results from alterations in the conformational structure of nucleic acids, proteins or by interference with oxidative phosphorylation and osmotic balance (Yaoa et al. 2008). The most common mechanisms by which metals are eliminated from wastewater treatment processes depend on precipitation, adsorption to suspended <b>solids</b> during primary <b>sedimentation</b> or adsorption to extra-cellular polymers (Qodah 2006). Use of bio-adsorbents such as bacteria, fungi, algae and some agricultural wastes that emerged as an eco-friendly, effective and low cost material option could offer potential inexpensive alternatives to the conventional adsorbents (Valls and Lorenzo 2002). Different species of Aspergillus, Pseudomonas, Sporophyticus, Bacillus, Phanerochaete, etc., have been reported as efficient chromium and nickel reducers. The response of microorganisms towards toxic heavy metals is very important for reclamation of polluted sites (Congeevaram et al. 2007).|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an assessment of}} the availability and quality of biomass from the wastewaters in a traditional corn mill in Mexico City for biogas production. To date, these wastewaters (called nejayote) are discharged untreated to the sewer with a chemical composition that surpasses the maximum permissible levels of pollutants established in the Official Mexican Standards (NOMs). From the study case four scenarios were proposed to tackle this problem: 1) separate the suspended <b>solids</b> (SS) by <b>sedimentation</b> {{in order to reduce the}} organic content of nejayote, 2) recover a protein-rich microbial biomass for animal feed through the aerobic treatment of these wastewaters, 3) produce biogas to cover part of the energy demand of the corn mill under study, and 4) switch to the alkaline extrusion of corn as an alternative the traditional corn-cooking technique known as nixtamalization. Despite their environmental benefits, none of the proposed scenarios offer, separately, the economic incentives to change the business as usual in this traditional corn mill. Yet, biogas production can be combined with other alternatives like the alkaline extrusion of corn in a two-stage technological package. This processing technology would completely eliminate nejayote while preserving the nutritive value of the nixtamal dough and most importantly, the organoleptic uniqueness of the traditionally-made tortillas...|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{models for}} the {{prediction}} of turbulent flow field and suspended <b>solid</b> distribution in <b>sedimentation</b> tanks are characterized by refined modeling of hydrodynamics, but apparently weak modeling of settling properties of suspensions. It is known that sedimentation tanks typically treat highly heterodisperse suspensions, whose concentrations range from relatively high to low values. However, settling is modeled either by considering one or more particle classes of different settling velocity, without accounting for hindered settling conditions, or by treating the suspension as monodisperse, even in regions of low concentration. A new generalized settling model is proposed to account for both discrete settling conditions in low concentration regions of the tanks and hindered settling conditions in high concentration regions. Settling velocities of heterodisperse suspensions are then determined {{as a function of}} particle velocities in isolation and their total concentration. The settling model is used in the framework of a transport model for the simulation of hydrodynamics and solid distribution in a rectangular sedimentation tank. Results show that solid distribution is mainly affected by particle interactions in the inlet region and by settling properties of individual particles in the outlet region. Comparison of the proposed settling model with other settling models suggests that a generalized approach of the modeling of settling properties of suspensions is a primary concern to obtain reliable predictions of the removal rate...|$|R

After <b>sedimentation,</b> due to a low hydraulic conductivity of the tailings, both dewatering and consolidating the tailings are difficult. Since electrokinetic (EK) is an effective method to consolidate low permeability soils, the objective {{of this study is to}} assess the effectiveness and efficiency of EK dewatering of MFT, a man-made geomaterial. Two series of tests were conducted in this study. In the first series, four EK cell tests were performed on oil sands tailings to measure the electroosmotic permeability, ke, along with other parameters, such as the EK induced water flow rate, electrical conductivity of the tailings, and power consumptions. The second test series was the dewatering model tests to investigate the feasibility of EK dewatering on oil sands tailings. The performance of the EK dewatering under two conditions was compared, i. e., 5 kPa consolidation at first followed by EK dewatering; and 5 kPa consolidation and EK dewatering simultaneously. The final water content, undrained shear strength and plasticity properties of MFT were measured after the EK dewatering tests. After the EK dewatering model tests, a significant overall increase in the undrained shear strength and decrease in the water content of tailings samples are observed, along with significant changes of the plasticity...|$|R
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{water quality}} monitoring program {{was conducted in}} the Yeongsan (YS) River, Korea from 2005 to present to investigate wet and dry weather pollutant discharge {{in an attempt to}} establish point and non-point pollution management strategies. As part of this monitoring program, 11 heavy metal species were measured during dry and wet weather conditions in the YS River, where Gwangju City (GJ), a subcatchment of the YS River, was further monitored to clarify the responsibility of different metal species discharged into the mainstream. Monthly grab water samples showed that greater amounts of metals along the YS River were discharged during the wet summer months due largely to storm runoff. In addition, further monitoring results revealed that GJ, a highly urbanized area, was a significant contributor of the heavy metals being discharged into the YS River during both wet and dry weather. The most abundant metal species discharged from GJ were manganese, aluminum and iron with different contributions of wet and dry weather flows to the total discharge load. Wet weather flow was a significant contributor to the annual dissolved metal loads, accounting for 44 &# 8211; 93 % of the annual load depending on the metal species, with the exception of chromium and cadmium (9 % and 27 %, respectively). Mostly, metal loads during wet weather were shown to be proportional to the rainfall depth and antecedent dry period. A substantial fraction of metals were also associated with <b>solids,</b> suggesting that <b>sedimentation</b> might be an appropriate management practice for reducing the metal load generated in GJ. Overall, although dissolved metal concentrations in YS River were at an acceptable level for aquatic community protection, continual metal discharge throughout the year was considered to be a potential problem in the long-term due to gradual water quality degradation as well as continuous metal accumulation in the system. clos...|$|R
30|$|Considering {{the quality}} and {{quantity}} of produced water, following options may be useful for appropriate use and disposal of CBM water in Raniganj Coalfield. Irrigation may be a suitable option for CBM-produced water only after desalinization and proper treatment. Irrigation has several critical aspects which need to be taken care for proper balance of soil quality and crops grown in the area. Impounding CBM water by pumping it into storage facilities, reservoirs and ponds has traditionally been a preferred water management option for CBM operators and may be one of the effective methods in Raniganj Coalfield. These impoundments are well known as infiltration ponds, evaporation ponds, or zero-discharge ponds. Drinking water availability is the major issue in Raniganj Coalfield. The large quantity of water generated from CBM production wells can be potential freshwater sources for various applications, including potable consumption. These challenges include high treatment cost, potential chronic toxicity of the treated produced water and public acceptance. Because of the need of desalination and removal of a large number of chemical compounds, RO will most likely be used for potable reuse applications. It is emphasized that the main challenges present in produced water are desalination, degassing, suspended solids removal, organic compounds removal, heavy metal and others. Achieving the various treatment goals requires the use of multiple treatment technologies, including physical, chemical, and biological treatment processes (Ahmadun et al. 2009). Some of the technologies are removal of TDS by precipitation, electrochemical or photocatalytic oxidation, nanofiltration or reverse osmosis, removal of metal through aeration, settling, sand filtration with suspended <b>solids</b> removal, coagulation/flocculation, <b>sedimentation</b> and filtration. The surface discharge and sub-surface injection of the produced water should be treated up to the requirements of the locals and state regulatory limitations for discharge and injection.|$|R
40|$|A {{polar stratospheric cloud}} submodel {{has been}} {{developed}} and incorporated in a general circulation model including atmospheric chemistry (ECHAM 5 /MESSy). The formation and sedimentation of polar stratospheric cloud (PSC) particles can thus be simulated as well as heterogeneous chemical reactions that {{take place on the}} PSC particles. For <b>solid</b> PSC particle <b>sedimentation,</b> the need for a tailor-made algorithm has been elucidated. A sedimentation scheme based on first order approximations of vertical mixing ratio profiles has been developed. It produces relatively little numerical diffusion and can deal well with divergent or convergent sedimentation velocity fields. For the determination of solid PSC particle sizes, an efficient algorithm has been adapted. It assumes a monodisperse radii distribution and thermodynamic equilibrium between the gas phase and the solid particle phase. This scheme, though relatively simple, is shown to produce particle number densities and radii within the observed range. The combined effects of the representations of <b>sedimentation</b> and <b>solid</b> PSC particles on vertical H 2 O and HNO 3 redistribution are investigated in a series of tests. The formation of solid PSC particles, especially of those consisting of nitric acid trihydrate, has been discussed extensively in recent years. Three particle formation schemes in accordance with the most widely used approaches have been identified and implemented. For the evaluation of PSC occurrence a new data set with unprecedented spatial and temporal coverage was available. A quantitative method for the comparison of simulation results and observations is developed and applied. It reveals that the relative PSC sighting frequency can be reproduced well with the PSC submodel whereas the detailed modelling of PSC events {{is beyond the scope of}} coarse global scale models. In addition to the development and evaluation of new PSC submodel components, parts of existing simulation programs have been improved, e. g. a method for the assimilation of meteorological analysis data in the general circulation model, the liquid PSC particle composition scheme, and the calculation of heterogeneous reaction rate coefficients. The interplay of these model components is demonstrated in a simulation of stratospheric chemistry with the coupled general circulation model. Tests against recent satellite data show that the model successfully reproduces the Antarctic ozone hole...|$|R
40|$|Coastal {{wetlands}} {{dominated by}} mangroves provide important ecological {{services to the}} coastal zone, {{many of which are}} associated with tidal inundation. In this study I investigated whether all coastal wetlands provide similar ecosystem services, or whether these varied depending on their geomorphological setting and the eutrophication level of the floodwater. Sampling was conducted over two years with significantly different levels of rainfall over six estuaries in Southeast Queensland, Australia. Sediment, nutrient and carbon exchange were investigated in tidal and riverine estuaries dominated by mangrove forests. The estuaries selected also comprised a gradient from low mesotrophic to low eutrophic. Spatial variation within the coastal wetlands was also investigated, comparing nutrient exchange in the low and high intertidal cyanobacteria mat. To assess sediment exchange, I measured retention of total suspended <b>solids</b> and <b>sedimentation</b> rates. Additionally, in order to assess the origin of sediment deposited in mangroves, glomalin, a novel terrestrial soil carbon (C) tracer, was used. Nutrient and C exchange were quantified by comparison of concentrations of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), nitrogen oxides (NOx [...] N), ammonium (NH 4 +) total organic carbon (TOC) and dissolved organic C (DOC) in water entering and leaving the mangroves during complete tidal cycles (3 tidal cycles in 6 estuaries for 2 years). Finally, the biogeochemical function of the cyanobacteria mat was measured through experiments investigating nitrogen fixation (N) and nutrient exchange in the extensive mats in the Exmouth Gulf, Western Australia. My results show that the seaward fringe mangrove retains the majority of sediment entering the wetland during a tidal cycle accounting for 52. 5 ± 12. 5 % of the total sedimentation (fringe mangrove + scrub mangrove + saltmarsh/ cyanobacteria mat). Geomorphological setting had a stronger influence on spatial patterns of deposition than on sedimentation rates. Riverine mangroves had more homogeneous distribution of sediments across the intertidal zone than tidal mangroves, where most sedimentation occurred in the seaward fringe mangrove zone. The presence of glomalin in sediments, and thus the relative importance of terrigenous sediment, was strongly influenced by geomorphological setting. Glomalin was primarily delivered to riverine mangroves and deposited within the scrub mangrove zone, while tidal mangroves received less glomalin during tidal inundation and most of it was deposited within the fringe mangrove zone. Overall, NOx [...] N concentrations decreased in the floodwater after flooding the coastal wetland, suggesting that these ecosystems act as sinks of dissolved NOx [...] N during tidal inundation. In average, NOx [...] N concentrations in the floodwater decreased 28 %. Additionally, during periods of high rainfall the decrease in nutrient concentrations was more pronounced, and not only NOx [...] N but also SRP and NH 4 + concentrations decreased to up to 51 % and 83 %, respectively. My results suggest that rainfall enhances nutrient removal by coastal wetlands in the region. Geomorphological setting also affected nutrient removal. Riverine mangroves received stronger nutrient pulses, which resulted in strongest rates of nutrient removal during tidal inundation. Nutrient removal was closely related to the nutrient concentration of the floodwater: high nutrient removal occurred when floodwater was rich in nutrients. The C entering the wetland in the floodwater was mainly composed of DOC and its exchange did not vary among sites with differing geomorphological setting. However, DOC exchange was strongly affected by the water quality of floodwater inundating the coastal wetland. DOC concentrations were higher in the flood compared to the ebb tide in sites flooded by water high in C, NH 4 + and SRP, suggesting DOC import. Contrary, DOC concentrations were lower in the flood compared to the ebb tide in sites flooded by water high in C, NH 4 + and SRP, suggesting DOC export. The high intertidal cyanobacteria mat was important in regulating N fluxes in coastal wetlands. In the arid Exmouth Gulf, where cyanobacteria mats are abundant, nitrogen fixation rates were 4. 9 ± 3. 2 nmol cm- 1 h- 1. Cyanobacteria mats also removed N from the floodwater in the form of NOx [...] N (0. 47 ± 0. 45 g m- 2 h- 1) and NH 4 + (0. 31 ± 0. 02 g m- 2 h- 1). N fixation and nutrient removal from the floodwater was highly variable spatially and temporally. N fixation rates were highest during the day in the mat situated at low tidal elevations. Overall, I found that the material exchange in coastal wetlands is variable within the coastal zone as a result of natural factors, such as geomorphology, vegetation composition and rainfall. But material exchange in wetlands is also affected by anthropogenic factors, particularly eutrophication. From all these factors, eutrophication of the floodwater appears to be the most critical, shifting the mangrove function from a DOC source to a nutrient and DOC sink. Approximate thresholds of nutrient and C concentrations in the floodwater that are likely to trigger shifts in ecosystem function in coastal wetlands in Southeast Queensland, and thus in the ecosystem services they provide, are 0. 02 mg L- 1 of SRP, 0. 04 mg L- 1 of NH 4 + and 7. 5 mg L- 1 of DOC...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} carried out at the Industrial Area of Khartoum North in the Khartoum state to {{determine}} the industrial effluents characteristics, their effect on sewers and their impact to the surrounding environment. Special {{attention has been given}} to tanneries effluents. In this study some factories, in the Industrial Area of Khartoum North, with different industrial types were selected for a closer study; their industrial operations and processing were observed, and their effluents were taken for physical and chemical analysis. The factories were: 1 -Food Industry (Tahnia), Military Forces Factory. 2 -Textiles, Sudanese Dyers Co. Ltd. 3 -Pharmaceuticals, Amipharma. 4 -Soaps and Oils, Soap and Allied Industries (Bittar). 5 -Tanneries, Hibatan Tannery. Most of the factories in the Industrial Area of Khartoum North have no pretreatment units for the treatment of their effluents and therefore characteristics of wastewater flowing to the pubic sewerage system are not conforming with the standard limits. The analyses were performed to measure the characteristics of these industrial effluents: they include physical tests like: colour, odor, temperatures, and chemical tests like: pH, BOD, COD, SS, TDS, Chrome content, and dissolved sulphides tests. The results of the physical and chemical tests showed different degrees of pollution for different industries. These results were compared with THE INDUSTRIAL LOCAL ORDER FOR KHARTOUM NORTH OF 1971 together with the limits used by INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT ORDERS of the nineties. Pharmaceutical, textiles, and soap industries showed less pollution, while food industries and tanneries showed a great degree of pollution; they almost exceeded all the acceptable limits of 1971. Tanneries were selected for the design of the pretreatment unit plant. All tanning processes, chemicals used in each process, and the types of wastes (solid and liquid) produced in each stage were observed. The max number of the different types of skins (i. e. the batch), the amount of water used in the industry, and the amount of wastewater produced were calculated. Many other tanneries in Khartoum state were visited to know the different tanning processing used and also to see their pretreatment units. Almost all of these tanneries use the same operations and processes for the tanning, but unfortunately most of them have only physical treatment (screens and settling tanks) with no maintenance or cleaning intervals. No treatment for the chrome content or the dissolved sulphides {{is carried out}}; their effects to the man and environment are widely known. Afrotan tannery has relatively a more advanced pretreatment unit plant. A typical pretreatment unit plant is proposed for the tanneries effluents, it comprises: - A bar screen: this decreases the suspended solids in the effluent. - A lifting tank with a lifting pump of submersible type. - A Chrome (Cr) storage and precipitation tank, where calcium hydroxide is added. Aeration can be used to enhance the precipitation. All Cr and other heavy metals are precipitated as hydroxides in the process. A mobile helicoidally sludge suction pump is used to remove all the precipitated Cr sludge and transferred to the Cr sludge drying beds. BOD and COD are also reduced. - Equalization and sulphides oxidation tank: all effluents are collected in this tank, mixed together, neutralized and become a homogenous solution. A rotary vane blower and a system of air diffuser devices are used for aeration of the effluent to oxidize all the dissolved sulphides. BOD and COD are also reduced in the process. - Pit for eventual dosage of chemicals: poly, manganese sulphate, and iron chloride may be added to the effluent, just before the sedimentation tank, to enhance the settling of all the remaining suspended <b>solids.</b> - <b>Sedimentation</b> tank, Dortmund type: all the suspended solids are removed in this tank; BOD is also reduced by a great percentage. The mobile suction pump (used for the suction of Cr sludge above) is used to remove all the other settling sludge from the sedimentation tank and transfer it to the other sludge drying beds. - Drying beds: Cr drying beds and other sludge drying beds are used to dry the sludge for the removal of odors and for volume reduction. Cr can also be reused after its drying but it needs special separate system for the process. The construction of the effluent treatment plant cost lots of money, but here in this design, this problem is highly considered and overcomed. The proposed pretreatment unit plant will cost about 60, 000 US. $. This is all done to enhance the construction of these plants to provide a clean effluent and hence a clean environment. A comparison is made with other designs prepared by the UNIDO, solving the problems of 7 tanneries in Africa. The designs were almost similar, depending on the situation. The cost varies between 100, 000 and 250, 000 US. $. This cost is really cheap compared with the great hazards that are caused by tanneries effluents...|$|R
