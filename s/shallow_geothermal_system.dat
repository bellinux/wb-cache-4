40|$|With the fi rst oil {{crises in}} the {{beginning}} of 1970, the Swedish governmentinvested in, at that time, innovative technology using the underground asa source of energy for space heating. By developing these shallow geothermalsystems the goal was to decrease the dependence of oil. The result of these efforts is that some 25 % of the world’s total amount ofshallow <b>geothermal</b> <b>systems</b> is placed in Sweden. Today, heat and cold derivedfrom the underground is the third largest renewable energy source inSweden. It has been estimated that the <b>shallow</b> <b>geothermal</b> <b>systems</b> contributewith 11 – 12 TWh to the heat supply in Sweden. There is a lack of proper data for calculations of how much thermal energyis captured from the underground. Hence, the statistics shown in this reportare based on reasonable estimates, having the sales of heat pumps as aprime source of information. The Swedish Energy Agency chose not to report the domestic contributionfrom small-scale geothermal plants in Swedish statistics. Only the fi guresfrom the heat pumps in the district heating systems are reported. On theother hand in the statistic reports to EU, the Agency calculates with a significant amount from small-scale ground source heat pumps. This indicatesthat <b>shallow</b> <b>geothermal</b> should be more properly dealt with in the energysupply statistics. The <b>geothermal</b> storage <b>systems</b> are used for combined heating and coolingof commercial and institutional buildings, often in a large scale. Someof these systems are also applied to district heating and cooling as well asin some industries. The unique technology to store thermal energy in theunderground from one season to another makes a great positive impact tothe economy and to the climate. From an environmental perspective, <b>shallow</b> <b>geothermal</b> should be equivalentto solar energy and some other renewables. The electricity needed torun the plants should preferably be evaluated based on current directivesfor calculations of carbon dioxide emissions within each country. <b>Shallow</b> <b>geothermal</b> <b>systems</b> are most often reasonable profi table, lookedupon as short term repayment of the investment. In addition, the user isless sensitive for price changes on the energy market. This is due to thehigh effi ciency of such systems.

40|$|Although {{a variety}} of {{engineering}} guidelines, planning software, and modelling techniques are available for <b>shallow</b> <b>geothermal</b> <b>system</b> planning and design, only {{a few studies have}} investigated their long-term operational effects in the field. The present study deals with an in-situ experiment on a borehole thermal energy storage (BTES) from combined heat and power production (CHP), which has been in operation on the site of Green Gas DPB in Paskov (the Czech Republic) for more than three years. This experimental BTES was monitored through six monitoring boreholes, and the temperatures were measured at various depths up to 80 m under the ground. The maximum temperatures measured at the centre of the BTES at the depths of 2 – 60 m under the ground ranged from 69. 0 °C to 78. 5 °C. The data acquired from the BTES operation was then used to set up and calibrate a heat transport model in the rock environment by means of the FEFLOW code. The calibrated numerical model contributed to optimisation of the BTES operation by simulation of various cycles of injection and exploitation of heat with an objective to minimise the loss of heat due to dissipation to the ground. The long-term feasibility of 65 -percent recovery of heat stored underground in the BTES in Paskov was predicted, and recommendations concerning efficient operation of this BTES were provided.

40|$|The {{performance}} of very <b>shallow</b> <b>geothermal</b> <b>systems,</b> as horizontal collector systems or special forms (i. e. heat baskets), interesting the first 2 m of depth from ground level, is strongly correlated {{to the kind}} of sediment locally available. In detail, the thermal properties (i. e. thermal conductivity) of quaternary deposits are greatly affected by two parameters, the soil moisture content and the grain size. A key challenge for very <b>shallow</b> <b>geothermal</b> <b>systems</b> is to understand how to enhance the heat transfer of the sediments surrounding the pipes, taking into account the interactions between the soil, the horizontal heat exchangers and the surrounding environment and the daily and seasonal variability of weather conditions, able to modify the moisture and water content in the first ground meters’ depth. Trying to answer these questions, the ITER Project (Improving Thermal Efficiency of horizontal ground heat exchangers, European project funded by European Commission under the Marie Skłodowska Curie Fellowship Program Horizon 2014 - 2020) focuses on testing thermally enhanced backfilling material (TEBM), created using natural sediments and acting on their ability to preserve a constant thermal behavior in the long term. In fact, the heat transfer exchange between the ground, the collectors and the ground heat pumps is improved in water saturated soil, where the presence of water in the pore size favors the heat transfer continuity in the medium. Given the heterogeneity of sedimentary deposits in alluvial plain and the uncertainties related to the estimation of thermal parameters for unconsolidated material affected by thermal use, here are presented the preliminary results determined for the same material (sand and loamy sand) both on a field test site and in laboratory, under different degree of water saturation...|$|R

Injection and {{production}} tests with temperature and pressure logging {{were performed on}} the OH- 1 and LCSH- 5 core holes. OH- 1 was permanently modified by cementing an NQ tubing string in place below a depth of 947 ft. The LCSH- 1 a hole was drilled in Quaternary blue clay {{to a depth of}} 1727 ft and reached a temperature of 193 oF at a depth of 1649 ft. This hole failed to find evidence of a <b>shallow</b> <b>geothermal</b> <b>system</b> east of the Mud Volcano but the conductive temperature profile indicates temperatures near 325 oF could be present below depth of 4000 ft. The LCSH- 5 hole was drilled to a depth of 4727 ft and encountered a significant shallow permeability between depths of 1443 and 1923 ft and below 3955 ft. LCSH- 5 drilled impermeable Quaternary fanglomerate to a depth of 1270 ft. Below 1270 ft the rocks consist primarily of Tertiary sedimentary rocks. The most significant formation deep in LCSH- 5 appears to be a series of poikoilitic mafic lava flows below a depth of 4244 ft that host the major deep permeable fracture encountered. The maximum static temperature deep in LCSH- 5 is 323 oF and the maximum flowing temperature is 329 oF. This hole extended the known length of the geothermal system by ¾ of a mile toward the north and is located over ½ mile north of the northernmost hot spring. The OH- 1 hole was briefly flow tested prior to cementing the NQ rods in place. This flow test confirmed the zone at 947 ft is the dominant permeability in the hole. The waters produced during testing of OH- 1 and LCSH- 5 are generally intermediate in character between the deep geothermal water produced by the Phipps # 2 well and the thermal springs. Geothermometers applied to deeper fluids tend to predict higher subsurface temperatures with the maximum being 382 oF from the Phipps # 2 well. The Lake City geothermal system can be viewed as having shallow (elevation > 4000 ft and temperatures of 270 to 310 oF), intermediate (elevation 2800 to 3700 ft and temperatures 270 to 320 oF) and deep (elevations < 1000 ft and temperatures 323 to 337 oF) components. In the south part of the field, near Phipps # 2 the shallow and deep components are present.

The influence of the vegetation cover on the <b>shallow</b> <b>geothermal</b> <b>system</b> was observed in the sites studied. There were variations of monthly average values of temperature between the places with and without vegetation cover. During the "dry" period, this variation was up to 6. 01 ?C at the depth of 0. 02 m, and 2. 84 ?C at the depth of 1. 0 m. During the "rainy" period, however, the variation was up to 2. 94 ?C, at the depth of 0. 02 m, and 2. 51 ?C at the depth of 1. 0 m. The difference of the daily extreme values of temperature between sites with and without vegetation cover were 3. 97 ?C during the "rainy" period and 9. 63 ?C during the "dry" period, at the depth of 0. 02 m. It was noticed that at 06 : 00 PM {{the magnitude of the}} temperature remained high compared to other times on the day studied. The values of the thermal conductivity were 0. 54 W/m?C during the "dry" period, and 1. 23 W/m?C during the "rainy" period. The values of the shallow geothermal flows at depths of 0. 5 m and 1. 0 m, were 2. 51 W/m? and 0. 64 W/m?, respectively. These values are 10 ? larger than the terrestrial heat flow in the region. The thermal variations at 0. 5 m to 1. 0 m depth are influenced by external sources that reach the surface and cannot be neglected.

The numbers of installed ground source heat pump (GSHP) systems, for example, is continuously increasing worldwide. The objective of the current study is not only to discuss the net energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions or savings by GHP operation, but also to fully examine environmental burdens and benefits related to applications of such <b>shallow</b> <b>geothermal</b> <b>systems</b> by employing a state-of the-art life cycle assessment (LCA). The latter enables us to assess the entire energy flows and resources use for any product or service that is involved in the life cycle of such a technology. The applied life cycle impact assessment methodology (ReCiPe 2008) shows the relative contributions of resources depletion (34 %), human health (43 %) and ecosystem quality (23 %) of such GSHP systems to the overall environmental damage. Climate change, as one impact category among 18 others, contributes 55. 4 % to the total environmental impacts. The life cycle impact assessment also demonstrates that the supplied electricity for the operation of the heat pump is the primary contributor to the environmental impact of GSHP systems, followed by the heat pump refrigerant, production of the heat pump, transport, heat carrier liquid, borehole and borehole heat exchanger (BHE). GHG emissions related to the use of such GSHP systems are carefully reviewed; an average of 63 Â t CO 2 equivalent emissions is calculated for a life cycle of 20 years using the Continental European electricity mix with 0. 599 Â kg CO 2 eq/kWh. However, resulting CO 2 eq savings for Europe, which are between - 31 % and 88 % in comparison to conventional heating systems such as oil fired boilers and gas furnaces, largely depend on the primary resource of the supplied electricity for the heat pump, the climatic conditions and the inclusion of passive cooling capabilities. Factors such as degradation of coefficient of performance, as well as total leakage of the heat carrier fluid into the soil and aquifer are also carefully assessed, but show only minor environmental impacts.

These ERT-derived temperatures were then compared to direct temperature measurements in control piezometers collected with distributed temperature sensing (DTS) and groundwater temperature loggers. Spatially, it enabled to map the horizontal and vertical extent of the heated water plume, as well as the zones where maximum temperatures occurred. Quantitatively, the temperatures and breakthrough curves estimated from ERT were in good agreement with the ones observed directly during the rise and maximum of the curve. An overestimation, likely related to 3 D effects, was observed for the tail of the heat breakthrough curve. The error made on temperature can be estimated to be between 10 to 20 %, which is a fair value for indirect measurements. From our data, we estimated a quantification threshold for temperature variation of 1. 2 °C. These results suggest that ERT should be considered when designing heat tracing experiments or <b>geothermal</b> <b>systems.</b> It could help also to assess the geometrical complexity of the concerned reservoirs. It also appears that ERT could be a useful tool to monitor and control <b>geothermal</b> <b>systems</b> once they are in operation. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|In {{southern}} Tuscany (central Italy), deep to <b>shallow</b> <b>geothermal</b> <b>systems</b> {{were active}} since the Pleistocene and comprise fluids carrying variable amounts of CO 2. The Monte Amiata geothermal fields include two main reser- voirs: a deep one {{located in the}} Palaeozoic metamorphic succession (1300 – 3000 m deep) belonging to the Tus- can metamorphic ‘basement’ and a shallow one hosted in the Mesozoic sedimentary succession (500 – 1000 m deep) belonging to the Tuscan Nappe. Multiple sets of calcite veins were investigated in some outcrops of the Tuscan Nappe succession exposed in the Monte Amiata area and surroundings. Two main fluid systems were characterized: the former related to combined diagenetic syn-tectonic processes from highly saline fluids after interaction with the Late Triassic evaporites (Burano Fm) and the latter related to a fossil <b>geothermal</b> <b>system,</b> Pleistocene in age, fed by low-salinity meteoric fluids, carrying CO 2, radiogenic Sr and heavy O isotopes after interaction with the subsurface rocks. Comparison with the present-day hydrothermal fluids allowed to sketch the thermal evolution of the system from past to present. Geochemical data proved that portions of the vein–host rocks were reset after interaction with CO 2 -rich fluids circulating in the past. Consequently, textural and mineral- ogical changes {{are expected to have}} occurred with respect to the undisturbed rock masses. Understanding these modifications, their location and extension, is a prerequisite to construct (i) geochemical models addressed to the comprehension of the diagenesis induced in sediments after long-term CO 2 storage; and (ii) geological models applied to the prediction of rock heterogeneity distribution within the upper reservoirs, characterizing the shallow (500 – 1500 m) <b>geothermal</b> <b>systems</b> of southern Tuscany...|$|R

Geophysical methods may be useful in order to yield additional information with greater coverage than conventional wells. We report a heat transport study during a shallow heat injection and storage field test. Heated water (about 50 °C) was injected for 6 days at the rate of 80 l/h in a 10. 5 °C aquifer. Since bulk electric resistivity variations can bring important information on temperature changes in aquifers (water electric conductivity increases about 2 %/°C around 25 °C), we monitored the test with surface electric resistivity tomography and demonstrate its ability to monitor spatially temperature variations. Time-lapse electric images clearly show the decrease and then the increase in bulk electric resistivity of the plume of heated water, during respectively the injection and the storage phase. This information enabled to calibrate the conceptual flow and heat model used to simulate the test. Inverted resistivity values are validated with borehole electromagnetic measurements (EM 39) and are in agreement with the temperature logs used to calibrate the parameters of the thermo-hydrogeological model for the injection phase. This field work demonstrates that surface electric resistivity tomography can monitor heat and storage experiments in shallow aquifers.

40|$|Groundwater {{resources}} are increasingly used {{around the world}} for <b>geothermal</b> exploitation <b>systems.</b> To monitor such systems and to estimate their governing parameters, we rely mainly on borehole observations of the temperature field at a few locations. Bulk electric resistivity variations can bring important information on temperature changes in aquifers. We have used surface electric resistivity tomography to monitor spatially temperature variations in a sandy aquifer during a thermal injection test. Heated water (48 degrees C) was injected for 70 hours at the rate of 87 l/h in a 10. 5 degrees C aquifer. Temperature changes derived from time-lapse electric images were in agreement with laboratory water electric conductivity-temperature measurements. In parallel, a coupled hydrogeologic saturated flow and heat transport model was calibrated on geophysical data for the conceptual model, and on hydrogeologic and temperature data for the parameters. The resistivity images showed an upper flow of heated water along the well above the injection screens and led to a new conceptualization of the hydrogeologic source term. The comparison between the temperature models derived from resistivity images and from the simulations was satisfactory. Quantitatively, resistivity changes allowed estimating temperature changes within the aquifer, and qualitatively, the heated plume evolution was successfully monitored. This work demonstrates the ability of electric resistivity tomography to study heat and storage experiments in shallow aquifers.

40|$|Nowadays {{renewable}} energy resources for heating/cooling residential and tertiary buildings and agricultural greenhouses {{are becoming increasingly}} important. In this framework, a possible, natural and valid alternative for thermal energy supply is represented by soils. In fact, since 1980 soils have been studied and used also as heat reservoir in geothermal applications, acting as a heat source (in winter) or sink (in summer) coupled mainly with heat pumps. Therefore, the knowledge of soil thermal properties and of heat and mass transfer in the soils {{plays an important role}} in modeling the performance, reliability and environmental impact in the short and long term of engineering applications. However, the soil thermal behavior varies with soil physical characteristics such as soil texture and water content. The available data are often scattered and incomplete for geothermal applications, especially very <b>shallow</b> <b>geothermal</b> <b>systems</b> (up to 10 m depths), so it is worthy of interest a better comprehension of how the different soil typologies (i. e. sand, loamy sand [...] .) affect and are affected by the heat transfer exchange with very <b>shallow</b> <b>geothermal</b> installations (i. e. horizontal collector systems and special forms). Taking into consideration these premises, the ITER Project (Improving Thermal Efficiency of horizontal ground heat exchangers, [URL] funded by European Union, is here presented. An overview of physical-thermal properties variations under different moisture and load conditions for different mixtures of natural material is shown, based on laboratory and field test data.

40|$|Time-lapse {{inversion}} of geoelectrical data is increasingly growing as remote monitoring systems {{are being used}} in more applications such as seawater intrusions, landslides, bioremediation of contaminated sites, landfill operations, <b>shallow</b> <b>geothermal</b> <b>systems,</b> or water resources. To date, several inversion strategies exist for {{taking into account the}} temporal dimension of the data. Among the most used ones are the independent {{inversion of}} multi-temporal data sets, the difference inversion, the temporally-constrained inversion, and the more recent process-based inversion. The success of a particular time-lapse inversion scheme depends on the validity of several assumptions made by these inversion schemes. Difference inversion schemes generally assume that part of the noise contained in the data cancels out when working with temporal data differences. Process-based inversion requires a more advanced knowledge of the system prior the inversion. Temporally-constrained inversion on the other hand assumes that the changes are localized and minor. We show in this paper using data sets with different time and spatial scales, and with different degrees of geological complexity and resistivity contrasts, that the particular success of a time-lapse inversion scheme is highly dependent on the temporal behaviour of the noise estimation in the time-lapse data set and of the model-dependent resolution pattern of the survey. We attempt to provide guidelines for successful quantitative interpretation of time-lapse data sets whenever possible...|$|R
40|$|<b>Shallow</b> <b>geothermal</b> <b>systems</b> are {{increasingly}} being used to store or harvest thermal energy for heating or cooling purposes. This technology causes temperature perturbations exceeding the natural variations in aquifers, which may impact groundwater quality. Here, we report the results of laboratory experiments {{on the effect of}} temperature variations (5 - 80 °C) on redox processes and associated microbial communities in anoxic unconsolidated subsurface sediments. Both hydrochemical and microbiological data showed that a temperature increase from 11 °C (in situ) to 25 °C caused a shift from iron-reducing to sulfate-reducing and methanogenic conditions. Bioenergetic calculations could explain this shift. A further temperature increase (> 45 °C) resulted in the emergence of a thermophilic microbial community specialized in fermentation and sulfate reduction. Two distinct maxima in sulfate reduction rates, of similar orders of magnitude (5 × 10 - 10 M s- 1), were observed at 40 and 70 °C. Thermophilic sulfate reduction, however, had a higher activation energy (100 - 160 kJ mol- 1) than mesophilic sulfate reduction (30 - 60 kJ mol- 1), which might be due to a trade-off between enzyme stability and activity with thermostable enzymes being less efficient catalysts that require higher activation energies. These results reveal that while sulfate-reducing functionality can withstand a substantial temperature rise, other key biochemical processes appear more temperature sensitive...|$|R

Crystalline rocks are in general considered of poor interest for geothermal applications atshallow depths (< 100 m), because of the low permeability of the medium.

The {{purpose of this study}} is to test the possibility of efficient thermal energystorage in shallow fractured rocks with a single well semi open loop heat exchanger (standing column well). Fordoing so, a simplified numerical model of fractured media is considered with few fractures. Here we present the different steps for building the model and for achieving the sensitivity analysis. First,an analytical and dimensional study on the equations has been achieved to highlight the main parameters thatcontrol the optimization of the system.

40|$|Very low {{enthalpy}} <b>geothermal</b> <b>systems</b> (open or closed) {{are increasingly}} considered for heating or cooling houses and offices using groundwater energy combined with heat pumps. However, {{the design and}} the impact of current <b>shallow</b> <b>geothermal</b> <b>systems</b> are often set up and assessed in a semi-empirical way. In our country, this situation seems accepted by most of the private partners but not by the authorities and responsible administrations evaluating the impact on groundwater with a mid- to long-term perspective. A rigorous methodology is needed based on a physically based estimation of heat transfer parameters. In this study, the simultaneous use of heat and dye tracers allows estimating simultaneously heat transfer and solute transport parameters in an alluvial aquifer. The experimental field site, located near Liege (Belgium), is equipped with 21 piezometers drilled in the alluvial deposits of the Meuse River. These alluvial deposits are composed of a loam layer (3 m) overlying a sand and gravel layer which constitutes the alluvial aquifer (7 m). The tracing experiment consisted in injecting simultaneously heated water and a dye tracer in a piezometer and monitoring the evolution of groundwater temperature and tracer concentration in a series of control panels set perpendicularly to the main groundwater flow. Results showed drastic differences between heat transfer and solute transport due to the main influence of thermal capacity of the saturated porous medium. The tracing experiment was then simulated using a numerical model and the best estimation of heat transfer and solute transport parameters is obtained by calibrating this numerical model using inversion tools. The developed concepts and tests may lead to real projects of various extents that can be now optimized by the use of a rigorous and efficient methodology at the field scale...|$|R
