40|$|Radioactive {{sources are}} being {{incorporated}} into the world’s <b>scrap</b> <b>metal</b> supply. In order to prevent this unwanted radioactive material from entering <b>metal</b> <b>processing</b> sites, some facilities have voluntarily installed radiation monitoring devices {{at the entrance to}} their facilities (Figure 1). However, this monitoring does not guarantee that all radioactive sources will be detected in <b>scrap</b> <b>metal</b> loads. Shielding of the sources by the <b>metal</b> <b>scrap,</b> location of the source within the scrap load and the location and sensitivity of the monitoring system will determine if the source is detected. To date, there have been 83 meltings of radioactive sources in <b>metal</b> <b>processing</b> facilities (1), with site cleanups averaging $ 12 – 15 million (1). One facility, the site of a melted a radiation source, has incurred cleanup costs in excess of $ 26 million (1). The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in a cooperative partnership with the <b>scrap</b> <b>metal</b> industry, developed a CD ROM based training program to provide a protocol for response to facility radiation alarms (2). This training enables site workers to identify and properly manage radioactive sources after they have been detected in the <b>scrap</b> <b>metal</b> supply. In order to prevent these sources from becoming uncontrolled, it is necessary to identify and manage these radioactive sources before they get placed in the <b>scrap</b> <b>metal</b> supply. A CD ROM based training program entitled “Identifying Radioactive Sources at the Demolition Site ” is designed to address this problem and help the demolition industry secure radioactive gauges and devices at their point of installation...|$|R
5000|$|Another {{example of}} this {{phenomenon}} {{can be seen in}} the region near the transportation corridor between Prešov and Poprad in Slovakia. The area is an important foraging region for Romani communities, who collect mushrooms and berries during the summer for trade and direct consumption. Romani selling mushrooms and berries at the side of the road is a common sight; the activity is particularly important due to the poor living conditions of many Romani in the area, who frequently take part in the illegal harvesting of state and private agricultural lands. In 2006, a popular magazine published an article titled [...] "Grasshoppers: While Roma from Tatra Region Make Money on Forests, Bears are Getting Hungry." [...] In the article, it was alleged that due to Romani foraging, Slovak bears could not find sufficient food to survive the winter. This fits a pattern described by K. Harper et al, in which Romani people in Hungary are viewed as a group that [...] "lacks environmental awareness", while simultaneously being [...] "dissociated from any timeless connections to land":Contemporary environmental discourses tend to portray marginalized and indigenous people in either of two ways: as noble savages or as environmental profligates (Krech, 1999). Unlike indigenous people, however, the Roma in Hungary are not associated with a timeless, revered 'environmental ethic'—perhaps because they were excluded from owning land (Csalog, 1994). In fact, the most destitute Roma have been chided for their short-sighted use of environmental resources: heating the house with forest wood and parts of the house itself (Ladányi and Szelényi, 2006 ...), engaging in extremely hazardous <b>scrap</b> <b>metal</b> <b>processing</b> and allegedly overharvesting snowdrop flowers to sell in the city. While many observers acknowledge the structural inequalities and histories underlying Roma communities' rural and post-industrial indigence, the fact remains that non-Roma widely see the Roma as a group that profoundly lacks environmental awareness.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to test the ability of Graphene Oxide (GO) to attract and hold heavy radionuclides to be mechanically filtered out using an aluminum oxide ceramic filter. The radionuclides of interest are strontium- 90, cesium- 137 and uranium. Naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM) are abundant throughout the earth's crust. Human manipulation of NORM for economic ends, such as mining, ore processing, fossil fuel extraction, and commercial aviation, may lead to what is known as "technologically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive materials? (TENORM). The existence of TENORM results in an increased risk for human exposure to radioactivity. TENORM-producing industries may cause workers to be occupationally exposed to ionizing radiation and may release significant amounts of radioactive material into the environment resulting in the potential for widespread exposure. These industries include mining, phosphate processing, metal ore processing, heavy mineral sand processing, titanium pigment production, fossil fuel extraction and combustion, manufacture of building materials, thorium compounds, aviation, and <b>scrap</b> <b>metal</b> <b>processing.</b> Treatment and decontamination of waste products and contaminated groundwater containing human-made radionuclides, among which the transuranic elements are the most toxic, is an essential task in the clean-up of legacy nuclear sites.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that downstream mineral resource beneficiation {{has the potential}} to promote socio-economic growth in resource-rich nations. Many African countries, including South Africa, are thus prioritizing mineral beneficiation in their national policies and development strategies. However, policies with a strict focus on promoting downstream mineral beneficiation may {{come at the expense of}} other emerging sectors, as well as overshadow potential economic benefits of cross linkages into lateral sectors. Therefore, when presented with different beneficiation alternatives for a particular commodity, decision makers ideally need to base decisions on a systematic analysis of positive and negative impacts, if the sustainability benefits are to be maximised. Decision support frameworks (DSF) have been recommended for the promotion of sustainable development in the minerals sector, in particular for corporate and public policy development. They provide a structured and systematic approach to decision-making in complex situations, often characterised by multiple decision-makers with potentially conflicting views and objectives. Furthermore, the structured approach allows for transparent decisions to be made which take into consideration both the decision situation and stakeholder perspectives. Research thus far, on DSFs in the minerals sector, has been in the context of mineral processing decision situations which were primarily concerned with technology selection or process design. This dissertation investigates the applicability of decision support frameworks for sustainability performance analysis and comparison of decision alternatives, aimed at strategic planning in the minerals sector. More specifically, this entails the sustainability performance evaluation of decision alternatives as well as exploration of stakeholder perspectives regarding the relative importance of different factors in the decision-making process. The dissertation places particular emphasis on the different steps outlined in DSFs, rather than the final decision outcome, enabling analysis of the value that may be gleaned from the DSF as a whole, and from the individual stages. The application of decision support frameworks is demonstrated for the case of the iron and steel scrap industry in South Africa, with a particular focus on the potential for increased local beneficiation of scrap in steel mills and/or foundries. The export of scrap metal has been identified as a significant concern to some, as it is viewed to come at the expense of local beneficiation, hampering access to affordable and quality scrap for local processors. As such, decision-makers are faced with the question of which option for <b>scrap</b> <b>metal</b> <b>processing</b> has the most potential sustainability benefits. The sustainability performance evaluation was based on available industry data, and assumptions were made when data were unavailable. Interviews were conducted with key stakeholders in the industry, which included representatives of metal recycling, steel mills, foundries and institutions...|$|E

For purposes of defining the project, it is divided into phases: economic feasibility and conceptual design; preliminary design; detail design; construction; and operation. This study comprises the bulk of Phase 1. It is divided into four sections. Section 1 provides the reader with a complete overview extracting pertinent data, recommendations and conclusions from the remainder of the report. Section 2 defines the variables that impact the design requirements. These data form the baseline to create a preliminary conceptual design that is technically sound, economically viable, and capitalizes on economies of scale. Priorities governing the design activities are: (1) minimizing worker exposure to radionuclide hazards, (2) maximizing worker safety, (3) minimizing environmental contamination, (4) minimizing secondary wastes, and (5) establishing engineering controls to insure that the plant will be granted a license in the state selected for operation. Section 3 provides details of the preliminary conceptual design that was selected.
