40|$|Research on {{effective}} {{leadership and}} emotional intelligence is growing. Yet, there still remains a gap on the relationships that exist between leadership and emotional intelligence especially on school effectiveness. Utilizing these connections, the main {{aim of this}} study was to identify the relationship of principals' leadership style and emotional intelligence and on school effectiveness. This study utilized both quantitative and qualitative approaches in gathering the data for this study. A total of 115 school principals participated in this study for the quantitative analysis while 8 school principals participated in the qualitative analysis. A focus group interview was also conducted for the development of the School Effectiveness Indicator Instrument (SEII) that measured the level of school effectiveness. Two other instruments that were adapted for this study were Bass and Avolio's Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ 5 X Form) that identified the principals' leadership styles, and Mayer - Salovey - Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT) was used to operationalize emotional intelligence. The findings of this study are as follow. First, it indicated that the principals perceived themselves as exhibiting a highly transformational leadership style as compared to the other two leadership styles, namely transactional and laissez- faire. Second, it revealed that the principals assessed themselves as demonstrating more on managing emotions as compared to the other three emotional branches namely perceiving emotions, facilitating emotions, and understanding emotions. Third, it depicted that over the three years (2007 - 2009), the schools in Sarawak occupied the three lower bands of school namely Band 3 (Fairly Low), Band 4 (Satisfactory) and Band 5 (High). Fourth, it revealed that there was a weak but significant relationship between the transactional leadership relationship and emotional intelligence while the other two leadership styles did not indicate any significant relationship. Fifth, there was no evidence to believe that principals' leadership style scores was significantly related to school effectiveness. Sixth, the findings indicated the existence of significant relationships between EI branches and school effectiveness. Seventh, there was no significant relationship between gender and leadership style scores. Eighth, findings indicated no significant relationship between <b>salary</b> <b>grade</b> and leadership style scores and finally, in terms of gender and <b>salary</b> <b>grade,</b> there was no significant difference in the EI as a whole.

This thesis examines {{the effects of}} personal, human capital and job related characteristics on the quit decision of managerial or professional level women. In addition, perceptual or equity factors, such as crowding within grade level and functional area, relative time to promotion and pay compared {{to others in the}} firm, were modeled. The micro-data are from the personnel files of a large manufacturing firm. Three types of analysis were conducted. The first was a logit analysis of a cross-sectional sample of the managerial/professional women in this firm. The second was a logit analysis of a pooled cohort sample of these women, during their second full year after hire. The third examination of the data used proportional hazard analysis, compensating for the selection bias, due to censored data, inherent in quit studies. The relative advantages and disadvantages of the three techniques are discussed. Empirical results of the proportional hazards model show that such job related factors as recent promotion, <b>salary,</b> <b>grade</b> level and favorable performance ratings significantly reduce quits, with promotion having the strongest effect. Personal factors such as marriage and children also reduce the managerial/professional woman's propensity to quit. [URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|E

40|$|Large {{international}} {{organizations such as}} the World Bank pursue multiple objectives in hiring policies, including cultural diversity, reducing costs and avoiding discrimination. There can be sharp trade-offs between these objectives. Diversity is enhanced by recruiting from an international labor market. But {{international organizations}} face unusually large differences in reservation wages for staff capable of doing the same work. One way to reduce costs would be to pay employees their reservation wages, implying unequal pay for equal work, or discrimination. The paper studies how these trade-offs are resolved in the World Bank's hiring processes. It estimates the disparities in <b>salaries</b> and <b>grades</b> between men and women and by country of origin which cannot be attributed to differences in the productive characteristics of workers. The results indicate that around half of <b>salary</b> and <b>grade</b> differentials between men and women and staff from high- and low-income countries are attributable to differences in worker characteristics. A number of alternative explanations for the remainder are explored including omitted variable bias, quotas imposed to assure diversity, and discrimination in hiring and promotion. It is argued that neither omitted variable bias nor quotas are compelling explanations for disparities, and that discrimination probably exists, though certainly less than would be implied by a cost minimizing hiring policy. Recent hiring processes have succeeded in reducing <b>salary</b> and <b>grade</b> differentials that cannot be attributed to observed differences in worker characteristics. ** The authors, listed in alphabetical order, are all of the World Bank's Development Research Group in Development Economics.

This thesis is {{an application of}} logistic regression and survival analysis techniques {{to the study of}} current estimated potential (CEP), manpower performance, and attrition behavior in the Singapore military. The manpower data includes both active (30 %) and reserve personnel (70 %) who entered service as early as the late fifties to as recent as the year 1992. The covariates under consideration are education level, academic or overseas military training award, current rank, length of service, rank seniority, age, <b>salary</b> <b>grade,</b> previous year's annual performance grade and CEP estimates. The study identifies the covariates that explain the CEP and annual performance for the binary and polytomous models of the officers who were still on active duty as of 31 Dec 1992. It also examines the trend of attrition behavior of officers using data from both the active and reserve personnel. The results of the study show that (1) higher education level does not necessary result in better performance grade although it seems to give an indication of higher CEP, (2) The higher the rank of an officer, {{the more likely it is}} for him to have a poorer performance grade than when he was in the previous rank, (3) Education level is a significant covariate of the survival functions, and (4) Engineering officers generally has a higher attrition rate than the other service support officers.

40|$|Despite {{numerous}} studies and reviews on faculty turnover, {{there appeared to}} be no systematic investigation of factors which influenced voluntary turnover among full-time faculty members in Nigerian educational institutions such as those studied here. In addition, it appeared that Nigeria lacked faculty turnover data for use in any meaningful research study. Therefore, this study investigated factors perceived to be influential among full-time faculty members leaving their jobs or institutions voluntarily. The six facets of the Job Descriptive Index developed by Smith, Kendall, and Hulin as well as a questionnaire about commitment development by Mowday, Porter and Steers elicited data concerning: present work, pay, promotion, supervision, coworkers, job in general, and commitment. Two hundred and eight (84. 21 %) of 247 full-time faculty members from ten selected colleges of technology/polytechnics in Nigeria became involved in this study. Means, frequencies, percentages, one-way ANOVA set at. 05 level and Scheffe Test of Multiple Comparison set at. 10 level were used for the analysis of data. Based on the findings, it could be established that full-time faculty members in Nigerian Colleges of Technology/Polytechnics are dissatisfied with their conditions of service. The most influential factors for voluntary turnover were pay and opportunities for promotion. Conclusions drawn from the study indicate that the demographic characteristics (gender, age, level of education, years of college teaching experience, <b>salary</b> <b>grade</b> level, college/polytechnic of employment, and region of origin) affect full-time faculty members' work attitudes.

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} {{formulate}} and estimate, using ordinary least squares, expected job satisfaction func-tions for {{male and female}} pharmacy students immediately prior to entering rotations or internship. Two issues are addressed: Whether or not expected job satisfaction functions can be estimated empirically and, if so, the extent to which inter-gender differences exist in the coefficients of the explanatory variables. The data consist of 60 men and 93 women enrolled at Nova Southeastern University. Expected level of job satisfaction from first job as pharmacist is measured along a one-to-ten scale, higher numbers indi-cating greater anticipated satisfaction. It is postulated to be a linear function of expected starting <b>salary,</b> <b>grade</b> average, age, preferred work setting, and ethnicity. For these variables least-squares estimates and their standard errors, levels of significance, and elasticities are developed separately for men and women, with statistically significant F ratios and relatively high Ft 2 values. The empirical evidence shows that expected job satisfaction functions and corresponding elasticities can be estimated successfully {{for male and female}} pharmacy students. The evidence also suggests that the rapidly changing gender composi-tion in the pharmacy profession may have eliminated or altered inter-gender differences in outlooks and expectations prevalent until recently. While grades are a stronger determinant of job satisfaction for men than for women, age is a significant predictor for women but not for men. Surprisingly, women derive more expected satisfaction out of expected initial salary and out of potential retail-work setting than do men, which contradicts the traditional argument of greater male than female concern for income and business aspects of pharmacy...|$|E

A shift seems to be occurring in the hiring process of the Bank, possibly because 1) the application pool, including women and Part II nationals (from developing countries) has significantly improved in quality; 2) information gathering during hiring has intensified, decreasing guesswork; 3) there is more incentive to staff from minority groups; and 4) the Bank's increasing diversity in terms of gender and nationality groups is more conducive to high performance by the people against whom there may previously have been bias.
