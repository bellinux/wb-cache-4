40|$|Lame {{volumes of}} {{wastewater}} containing metals such as Cd, Zn, Cu, Ph, Hg, Ni or Co are mainly treated by precipitation processes. However, waters treated in such ways {{do not always}} meet regulatory standards. And in many cases, ecotaxes must be paid on the heavy metals load in the discharged water. Therefore, a second polishing treatment is often necessary. In order to be economically acceptable, the technology must be cheap and adapted {{to the treatment of}} large volumes. The use of sand filters inoculated with heavy metal biosorbing and bioprecipitating bacteria fulfils these objectives. The system is based on a moving bed sand filter. A biofilm is formed on the sand grains after inoculation with heavy metal-resistant bacteria able to biosorb or to bioprecipitate heavy metals. Passage of the wastewater over these biofilms leads to the binding of the metals to the biofilm and consequently the removal of the metals from the wastewater. The metal-laden biofilm is removed from the sand grains in a <b>sand</b> <b>washer</b> created by an airlift for the continuous movement of the filter bed. The metal-loaded biomass is separated from the sand in a labyrinth {{on the top of the}} <b>sand</b> <b>washer.</b> Nutrients and a carbon source are provided continuously in the system in order to promote the regrowth of the biofilm on the sand grains. The reactor can be used for the removal of heavy metals, nitrates and some COD. The obtained biosludge contains heavy metals at concentrations of more than 10 % of the dry weight. The treatment of the sludge is also taken into account. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Today, Providing {{drinking}} water and process water {{is one of the}} major problems in most countries; the surface water often need to be treated to achieve necessary quality, and in this way, technological and also financial difficulties cause great restrictions in operating the treatment units. Although water supply by simple and cheap systems has been one of the important objectives in most scientific and research centers in the world, still a great percent of population in developing countries, especially in rural areas, don't benefit well quality water. One of the big and available sources for providing acceptable water is sea water. There are two ways to treat sea water first evaporation and second reverse osmosis system. Nowadays R. O system has been used for desalination because of low budget price and easily to operate and maintenance. The sea water should be pretreated before R. O plants, because there is some difficulties in raw sea water that can decrease yield point of membranes in R. O system. The subject of this research may be useful in this way, and we hope to be able to achieve complete success in design and construction of useful pretreatment systems for R. O plant. One of the most important units in the sea water pretreatment plant is filtration, the conventional method for filtration is pressurized sand filters, and the subject of this research is about new filtration which is called continuous back wash sand filtration (CBWSF). The CBWSF designed and tested in this research may be used more economically with less difficulty. It consists two main parts first shell body and second central part comprising of airlift pump, raw water feeding pipe, air supply hose, backwash chamber and <b>sand</b> <b>washer</b> as well as inlet and outlet connections. The CBWSF is a continuously operating filter, i. e. the filter does not have to be taken out of operation for backwashing or cleaning. Inlet water is fed through the sand bed while the sand bed is moving downwards. The water gets filtered while the sand becomes dirty. Simultaneously, the dirty sand is cleaned in the <b>sand</b> <b>washer</b> and the suspended solids are discharged in backwash water. We analyze the behavior of CBWSF in pretreatment of sea water instead of pressurized sand filter. There is one important factor which is not suitable for R. O membranes, it is bio-fouling. This factor is defined by Silt Density Index (SDI). measured by SDI. In this research has been focused on decreasing of SDI and NTU. Based on this goal, the prototype of pretreatment had been designed and manufactured to test. The system design was done mainly by using the design fundamentals of CBWSF. The automatic backwash sand filter can be used in small and also big water supply schemes. In big water treatment plants, the units of filters perform the filtration and backwash stages separately, and in small treatment plants, the unit is usually compacted to achieve less energy consumption. The analysis of the system showed that it may be used feasibly for water treating, especially for limited population. The construction is rapid, simple and economic, and its performance is high enough because no mobile mechanical part is used in it, so it may be proposed as an effective method to improve the water quality and consequently the hygiene level in the remote places of the country...|$|E
50|$|McMillan Sand Filtration Site is a twenty-five acre {{decommissioned}} {{water treatment}} plant in northwest Washington, D.C., built {{as part of the}} historic McMillan Reservoir Park. It is bound on the north by Michigan Avenue, on the east by North Capitol Street, on the south by Channing Street and on the west by McMillan Drive; which runs {{along the edge of the}} reservoir, to which it was formerly attached. Two paved courts lined by regulator houses, tower-like <b>sand</b> bins, <b>sand</b> <b>washers</b> and the gated entrances to the underground filter cells provided a promenade for citizens taking the air in the park before it was fenced off in WWII.|$|R
