40|$|Electrokinetic {{stabilisation}} is {{a method}} of improving the geotechnical parameters and behaviour of a soft soil by the application of electric current between electrodes. This improvement {{is due to the}} physiochemical changes generated in the soil; however not all the changes are desirable.

Therefore, it is important to study the physiochemical changes in the <b>soil</b> during electrokinetic <b>stabilisation</b> in order to estimate the behaviour of the soil in response to treatment. This study investigates the suitability of electrokinetic stabilisation for improving the geotechnical parameters and behaviour of dredged mud and demonstrates how the physiochemical nature of the soil changes during the process.

This entire process was conducted under closed conditions; that is, no water was allowed to flow through <b>soil</b> during <b>stabilisation.</b> Consequently, the water content of the soil was significantly reduced near the anode and this {{can be attributed to the}} changes of pH and physiochemical properties of the soil.

40|$|Clay {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the suitability of soil for use in construction. The affinity of a clay for moisture makes it susceptible to shrinkage and swelling on drying and wetting and therefore problematic in terms of construction, where stability is required for the integrity of a structure to remain intact. It is therefore important to have methods of dealing with problematic clays in order to allow clays to be used as a construction material. One of the methods is known as <b>soil</b> <b>stabilisation,</b> where the properties of a soil and mainly the clay fraction are altered to make it more suitable for its intended purpose. The thesis investigates the use of a highly plastic clayey soil for the production of building blocks. Due to the clayey nature and its associated properties the soil it is not suitable in its natural state. <b>Soil</b> <b>stabilisation</b> is investigated as a method to alter the properties of the soil. The principles of <b>soil</b> <b>stabilisation</b> are presented as an introduction to the laboratory testing programme.

40|$|The {{international}} 4 per 1000 initiative aims at supporting {{states and}} non-governmental stakeholders {{in their efforts}} towards a better management of soil carbon (C) stocks. These stocks depend on soil C inputs and outputs. They {{are the result of}} fine spatial scale interconnected mechanisms, which stabilise/destabilise organic matter-borne C. Since 2016, the CarboSMS consortium federates French researchers working on these mechanisms and their effects on C stocks in a local and global change setting (land use, agricultural practices, climatic and soil conditions, etc.). This article is a synthesis of this consortium’s first seminar. In the first part, we present recent advances in the understanding of <b>soil</b> C <b>stabilisation</b> mechanisms comprising biotic and abiotic processes, which occur concomitantly and interact. Soil organic C stocks are altered by biotic activities of plants (the main source of C through litter and root systems), microorganisms (fungi and bacteria) and ‘ecosystem engineers’ (earthworms, termites, ants). In the meantime, abiotic processes related to the soil-physical structure, porosity and mineral fraction also modify these stocks. In the second part, we show how agricultural practices affect soil C stocks. By acting on both biotic and abiotic mechanisms, land use and management practices (choice of plant species and density, plant residue exports, amendments, fertilisation, tillage, etc.) drive soil spatiotemporal organic inputs and organic matter sensitivity to mineralisation. Interaction between the different mechanisms and their effects on C stocks are revealed by meta-analyses and long-term field studies. The third part addresses upscaling issues. This is a cause for major concern since <b>soil</b> organic C <b>stabilisation</b> mechanisms are most often studied at fine spatial scales (mm–μm) under controlled conditions, while agricultural practices are implemented at the plot scale. We discuss some proxies and models describing specific mechanisms and their action in different soil and climatic contexts and show how they should be taken into account in large scale models, to improve change predictions in soil C stocks. Finally, this literature review highlights some future research prospects geared towards preserving or even increasing C stocks, our focus being put on the mechanisms, the effects of agricultural practices on them and C stock prediction models...|$|R

40|$|Soils {{are a key}} {{component}} of the terrestrial carbon cycle as they contain the majority of terrestrial carbon. Soil microorganisms mainly control the accumulation and loss of this carbon. However, traditional concepts of <b>soil</b> carbon <b>stabilisation</b> failed so far to account for environmental and energetic constraints of microorganisms.

In a long-term experiment we incubated 13 C labelled compost with natural soils at various soil carbon concentrations. Unexpectedly we found that soil carbon turnover decreased with lower carbon concentration. We developed a conceptual model that explained these observations. In this model two types of particles were submitted to random walk movement in the soil profile: soil organic matter substrate and microbial decomposers. Soil carbon turnover depended only on the likelihood of a decomposer particle to meet a substrate particle; in consequence carbon turnover decreased with lower carbon concentration, like observed in the experiment. This conceptual model was able to simulate realistic depth profiles of soil carbon and soil carbon age. Our results, which are simply based on the application of a two-step kinetic, unmystify the stability of soil carbon and suggest that observations like high carbon ages in subsoil, stability of carbon in fallows and priming of soil carbon might be simply explained by the probability to be decomposed...|$|R

The {{stabilisation}} of 14 C-labelled {{farmyard manure}} was investigated under different cropping systems (crop rotation, monoculture, and bare fallow) {{in a long-term}} field experiment established in 1967. Solid-state 13 C-NMR of bulk soils yielded a gradient of increasing aromatic properties in the order: straw manure–crop rotation < straw manure–monoculture< straw and farmyard manure–bare fallow. The opposite trend was observed for O-alkyl groups. The farmyard manure–bare fallow treatment was used to investigate changes of humic acids (HAs) with time. The FT-IR bands of aromatics, carbonyl groups, and a band of methyls and benzene rings increased over the 36 years of the experiment, whereas 2 amide bands and a band of sulfone and/or ester groups decreased. Fluorescence spectroscopy verified the increase in aromatic properties with age. Consequently, during <b>soil</b> organic matter <b>stabilisation,</b> HAs showed increasing properties of carbonyl and aromatic groups, whereas amidic groups decreased.

40|$|International audienceThis study (i) {{quantified}} the kinetics of selenate sorption and (ii) {{measured the}} influence of biotic processes in <b>soil</b> selenate <b>stabilisation.</b> Stirred flow-through reactor experiments were conducted on samples of a silty clay soil (pH= 8, Eh= 240 - 300 mV) from Bure (France) in both non-sterile and sterile conditions. Parameters of the proposed two-site sorption model (EK), adapted from van Genuchten and Wagenet (1989), were estimated by nonlinear regression. Fast selenate sorption on type- 1 sites was moderate, with an equilibrium constant of 25. 5 and 39. 1 L/kg for non-sterile and sterile conditions. Rate-limited sorption on type- 2 sites increased with time, and was predominant {{for longer periods of}} time in non-sterile conditions. At equilibrium, it would represent over 96 % of the sorbed inventory, with mean sorption times of 17 h and 191 h for non-sterile and sterile conditions. Our results showed for Bure soil that (i) selenate sorption in flowing and mildly-oxidising conditions was strongly kinetically controlled, especially in non-sterile conditions, (ii) selenate desorption was much slower than sorption, which suggests its pseudo-irreversible stabilisation, and (iii) microbial activity increased the contribution of rate-limited sorption on type- 2 sites, for which it increased sorption rate by a factor 7 but also facilitated its reversibility. This work stresses the limits of the K d approach to represent selenate sorption in flowing conditions and supports an alternative formulation like the EK model, but also points out that biotic conditions are significant sources of variability for sorption parameters. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
