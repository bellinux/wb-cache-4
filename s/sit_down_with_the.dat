500|$|Rangel {{endorsed}} Koch {{for re-election}} in 1981, but by 1983 his relations with the mayor had broken down: [...] "I don't know anybody in politics that I dislike enough that I would recommend that he <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> mayor." [...] By 1984, Rangel was the most influential black politician in New York State. [...] His position on Ways and Means allowed him to bring federal monies {{to the state and}} city for transit projects, industrial development, Medicare needs, low-income housing, and shelters for the homeless. [...] Rangel was one of the city's most recognizable politicians, and there was speculation that he would run for mayor in 1985, but Rangel preferred to remain in the House, with the goal of eventually becoming Ways and Means chairman and in the best possible case even House Speaker. [...] Indeed, Rangel never showed any interest in a different political job other than being the Congressman from Harlem.|$|E
500|$|In 1990 William Bennett, who at {{the time}} was drug czar of the United States, visited a drug {{treatment}} centre in Pittsburgh and upon noticing a poster of Bart remarked, [...] "You guys aren't watching The Simpsons, are you? That's not going to help you any." [...] When a backlash over the comment ensued, Bennett apologized, claiming he [...] "was just kidding" [...] and saying [...] "I'll <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> little spike head. We'll straighten this thing out." [...] In a 1991 interview, Bill Cosby described Bart as a bad role model for children, calling him [...] "angry, confused, frustrated." [...] In response, Matt Groening said, [...] "That sums up Bart, all right. Most people are in a struggle to be normal. He thinks normal is very boring, and does things that others just wished they dare do." [...] On January 27, 1992, then-President George H. W. Bush said, [...] "We are going to keep on trying to strengthen the American family, to make American families a lot more like the Waltons and a lot less like the Simpsons." [...] The writers rushed out a tongue-in-cheek reply {{in the form of a}} short segment which aired three days later before a rerun of [...] "Stark Raving Dad" [...] in which Bart replied, [...] "Hey, we're just like the Waltons. We're praying for an end to the Depression, too." ...|$|E

2500|$|Overall {{critical}} {{reception for}} Mega Man V has been average to positive. While {{many aspects of}} the game were commended, critics found very little change from previous installments in the series. VideoGames summarized, [...] "If you don't have a Mega Man game for your Game Boy, this one is a good as any. It's entertaining...it's Mega Man. If you're thinking 'rehash', you might be right and it's still a pretty fun game, though." [...] Nintendo Power was impressed by its gameplay and graphics, but felt that the game is too short, [...] "especially when you <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Super Game Boy and cruise". GamePro was contrastingly unimpressed with the controls on the SNES, considering the use of Game Boy much simpler.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fact that}} Obama never {{mentioned}} the word [...] "terrorism" [...] or [...] "terror" [...] was positively interpreted {{by many in}} the Muslim street, given that many of them see a 'war on terror' interchangeably as a 'war on Islam'. American conservatives also picked up on this and argued that it weakened Obama's overall message. House Republican leader John Boehner also commented after the speech that Obama [...] "seemed to place equal blame on the Israelis and the Palestinians.... I have concerns about that because Hamas is a terrorist organisation". As well, he said, [...] "here he continues to say he will <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Iranians without any preconditions, I just think that that puts us in a position where America looks weak in the eyes of their rulers." ...|$|E

2500|$|By August 2009, Rosenberg {{said that}} the scripts for Part 1 and 2 were 75 to 85 percent completed. She found the {{greatest}} challenge in writing the scripts {{to be the final}} sequence of Part 2: [...] "The final battle sequence is a big challenge because it lasts 25 pages", she said. [...] "It's almost an entire three-act story in and of itself. You have to track [...] hundreds of characters. It's an enormous challenge to choreograph on the page and for Bill [...] to choreograph on the stage." [...] She had written various drafts of the scene but, at that, hadn't revised or discussed them with Condon yet. She said, [...] "That's the next big hurdle to <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> stunt coordinator and create the ballet. It's a lot of work. I'm exhausted, but we're intent on making them the best scripts yet." [...] Godfrey called Part 2 [...] "an action film in terms of life-and-death stakes" [...] and said that in Part 1 [...] "there are the pangs of newlywed tension that occur that are relatable even in a fantasy film. Marriage is not quite the experience that they thought it was." [...] Condon thought of Part 1 [...] "as a real companion piece to Catherine Hardwicke's movie". Condon explains, [...] "Like, everything that got set up there gets resolved here. I think you'll find that there are stylistic and other nods to that film." ...|$|E
2500|$|In his May 2014 {{interview}} with NBC News, Snowden accused the U.S. government {{of trying to}} use one position here or there in his career to distract from the totality of his experience, downplaying him as a [...] "low level analyst." [...] In his words, he was [...] "trained as a spy {{in the traditional sense}} of the word in that I lived and worked undercover overseas—pretending to work in a job that I'm not—and even being assigned a name that was not mine." [...] He said he'd worked for the NSA undercover overseas, and for the DIA had developed sources and methods to keep information and people secure [...] "in the most hostile and dangerous environments around the world. So when they say I'm a low-level systems administrator, that I don't know what I'm talking about, I'd say it's somewhat misleading." [...] In a June {{interview with}} Globo TV, Snowden reiterated that he [...] "was actually functioning at a very senior level." [...] In a July interview with The Guardian, Snowden explained that, during his NSA career, [...] "I began to move from merely overseeing these systems to actively directing their use. Many people don’t understand that I was actually an analyst and I designated individuals and groups for targeting." [...] Snowden subsequently told Wired that while at Dell in 2011, [...] "I would <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> CIO of the CIA, the CTO of the CIA, the chiefs of all the technical branches. They would tell me their hardest technology problems, and it was my job {{to come up with a}} way to fix them." ...|$|E
