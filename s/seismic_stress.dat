Level of {{photon flux}} (PPF) influenced {{the type and}} extent of plant response to mechanical stress. Plant parts responded differently as PPF varied between 135 and 592 micromoles m- 2 s- 1. Stem length was significantly reduced by <b>seismic</b> <b>stress</b> at 135 micromoles m- 2 s- 1 but this effect was insignificant at higher PPFs. Reduced stem length resulted from an inhibition of internode elongation. Stem diameter was unaffected by stress at the PPFs tested. In contrast to effects on stem elongation, leaf area was insensitive to stress treatments at 135 micromoles m- 2 s- 1 but was progressively inhibited by stress as PPF increased.

40|$|The Arachthos Bridge in Greece {{is about}} 1 km long and crosses the future Arachthos reservoir. This paper {{presents}} the results of the earthquake analysis of the bridge design that won an international design competition. The spans vary from 83 m to 107 m. The Y-shaped piers with heights of up to 80 m are founded on piles. Because of the high <b>seismic</b> <b>stresses</b> in the bridge piers, hydraulic dampers are needed in both the longitudinal and transverse directions. The dampers reduce the <b>seismic</b> <b>stresses</b> in the piers by about 50 %. The optimisation of the seismic dampers is discussed in this paper. Two transverse seismic dampers are provided on each pier and one at each abutment. The seismic dampers allow relative movements between the bridge deck and the top of the bridge piers of up to ∓ 500 mm in the transverse direction. The longitudinal stability of the bridge girder under the static and dynamic loads is achieved by the piers, which are connected with the girder in the longitudinal direc-tion, and the seismic dampers at the abutments. In the longitudinal direction, seismic movements of up to ∓ 250 mm are allowed. The longitudinal dampers at the ends of the bridge girder must allow both longitudinal and transverse movements. The dy-namic analysis shows that maximum residual transverse movements of up to 200 mm are possible. Therefore, provision for the placement of hydraulic jacks is fore-seen on the pier tops for re-centering the bridge deck after a strong earthquake. The stability of the bridge girder under the service loads is provided by shear keys, which are integrated in the pot bearings. Under the design earthquake or an earthquake exceeding the design earthquake, the bridge girder is prevented from falling down from the bearings...|$|R

Shaken plants also had a 36 % greater leaf water potential 30 minutes after treatment. Continuous measurement of whole plant photosynthetic rate shows that a decline in CO 2 fixation began within seconds after the onset of shaking treatment and continued to decline to 16 % less than that of controls 20 minutes after shaking, after which gradual recovery of photosynthesis begins. Photosynthetic assimilation recovered completely before the next treatment 5 hours later. The transitory decrease in photosynthetic rate was due entirely to a two fold increase in stomatal resistance to CO 2 by the abaxial leaf surface. Mesophyll resistance was not significantly affected by periodic seismic treatment. Temporary stomatal aperture reduction and decreased CO 2 fixation are responsible for the lower dry weight of seismic stressed plants growing in a controlled environment...|$|E

A greenhouse {{study was conducted}} to test the influence of mechanical stress on soybean yield and to determine if exposure to mechanical stress during discrete growth periods has differential effects on seed yield. A modified rotatory shaker was used to apply seismic (i. e., shaking) stress. Brief, periodic episodes of <b>seismic</b> <b>stress</b> reduced stem length, total seed dry weight, and seed number of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr. ]. Lodging resistance was greater for plants stressed during vegetative growth or throughout vegetative and reproductive growth than during reproductive growth only.

Dry weight per 100 seeds was unaffected by seismic-stress treatment. Growth and yield reductions resulting from treatments applied only during the vegetative stage imply that long-term mechanical effects were induced, from which the plants did not fully recover.

40|$|A violent {{earthquake}} {{the strongest}} ever experienced in Formosa daring the past forty years, {{occurred in the}} early morning of April 21, 1935. This earthquake has practically destroyed the towns in the western district of central Formosa, where the occurrence of eartquakes has been very seldom. As is already stated in the preliminary note, a great damage has been done in the somewhat curved zone of about 70 km long and 15 km wide extending nearly in a NS direction. The loss of life and the destruction of houses were very great owing to the weakness of the native Formosan houses of the so-called "Dokaku" construction. The walls of the native houses are built up of sun-dried mud blocks of about 35 × 20 × 10 cm, cemented together with mud-mortar, the roof being thatched with straw or mode of Formosan tile. Since the houses of this type may be considered as a structure of rigid construction against earthquake motion, the <b>seismic</b> <b>stresses</b> will be nearly equal to the product of mass of the walls and the acceleration of earthquake motion. The strength of the walls is too small in spite of their heavy weight to resist the <b>seismic</b> <b>stresses</b> acting upon them and, therefore, the collapse of walls is quite easy. The dwelling houses of the ordinary Japanese in Formosa do not much differ from the wooden houses found everywhere in the mainland of Japan and the damage done to these houses was not so remarkable. The damage due to the pesent earthquake dome to the native houses and the wooden houses being separately known, the comparison of the earthquake resistivity of these two kinds of houses in Formosa has been made, the result of which is as shown in Fig. 4. As may be seen from Fig. 4, the earthquake resistivity of the native Formosan houses is far less than that of the wooden houses, though the ravages of white ants have rendered the latter less resistive to the earthquake shocks than similar houses in Japan proper. By combing the relation as shown in Fig. 4 with that between the seismic intensity and the percentage of collapse of wooden houses in Japan proper, the maximum seismic intensity of the present earthquake works out g/ 3 (g=acceleration due to gravity), which should be however reduced in some degree, if the ravages of white ants are taken into account. It is desirable to improve the construction of the native Formosan houses such that thcire earthquake resistivity shall be somewhat increased in order to provide against the future earthquakes. 昭和 10 年台湾中部地震に関する論文及報告　第 1 編　論...|$|R

Slurry wall properties, such as strengths and permeability are well known, but there is very little research on their seismic performance. This research includes shake table testing of two common types of slurry walls: sand-cement-bentonite (SCB), and cement-bentonite (CB) walls. Reduced-scale slurry walls with dimensions of 150 cm (long) x 160 cm (tall) x 20 cm (thick) were constructed inside a rigid, steel box that was mounted on top of a shake table.

40|$|The {{best way}} to design a nuclear steam {{generating}} system to withstand <b>seismic</b> <b>stresses</b> {{is to establish a}} mathematical model, to which seismic loading can be applied, to deter-mine the dynamic responses of the system. A practical approach for establishing such a model is to idealize the components in terms of beam elements which form the essential building blocks of the analytical model. The major shell structures of reactor vessels and steam generators are usually supported at a single elevation in the system, and are often simulated by cantilever beam elements. The use of a beam element to represent shell structure must be justified. This paper presents the results of a para-metric study of thin-walled cylindrical shells which are clamped at one end while the other end is free. By using S-D plate/shell finite element analysis, the region of ap-plication, where the beam element can reasonably simulate to shell structure, has been defiined as the combination of its geometrical parameters, e. g., the thickness/radius and length /radius. As an illustrative example, the S-D finite element method has been used to investigate the seismic analysis of a cantilever cylindrical shell similar to the Clinch River LMFBR reactor vessel. The numerical values are compared with those produced by a beam element model.
