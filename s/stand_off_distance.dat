Lasers combine the narrow-track area-of-interest with a large <b>stand</b> <b>off</b> <b>distance</b> from the tire. In order to cover a larger area-of-interest, mechanical positioning systems have been employed to take readings at multiple positions in the sidewall. Fixed-Point Laser sensors employ void filtering to remove the effect of the voids between the tread lugs in radial run-out measurement, and letter filtering to remove the effect of raised letters and ornamentation on the sidewall.|$|E

PLAN incursions from Angola into Namibia {{restarted}} in Ernest after the Portuguese withdrawal from Angola. Infiltration particularly started after the first rains {{during the rainy season}} when conditions were favourable for the combatants.Vegetation was tall and this provided for cover. The Oshanas were filled with drinking water that combatants needed during the long treks from their Angolan bases into Namibia. The rain also washed away foot tracks which made follow up operations by South African forces difficult. Once in Namibia combatants either planted Landmines, sabotaging administration infrastructure i.e. electricity pylons, ambushed SADF convoys, or attacked SADF bases from a <b>stand</b> <b>off</b> <b>Distance</b> mainly with mortars.|$|E

The predicted outgassing {{rate of the}} comet and the solar wind properties close to its perihelion at 1. 24 AU lead to the expectation that a cometary bow shock will form during the escort phase. Since the forecasts of the subsolar <b>stand</b> <b>off</b> <b>distances</b> differ, this study revisits selected models and presents hybrid simulations of the comet–solar wind interaction region performed with the A.

50|$|Sheet-of-Light Laser (SL) Systems were {{introduced}} in 2003, and have emerged as the most capable and reliable run-out, bulge and depression measurement methods. SL sensors project a laser line instead of a laser point, and thereby create a very large area-of-interest. Sidewall sensors can easily span an area from the bead area to the tread shoulder, and inspect the complete sidewall for bulge and depression defects. Large radial sensors can span 300mm or more to cover the entire tread width. This enables characterization of RRO in multiple tracks. SL sensors also feature <b>stand</b> <b>off</b> <b>distances</b> large enough to assure no collisions with the tire. Two-dimensional tread void filtering and sidewall letter filtering are also employed to eliminate these characteristics from the runout measurements.|$|R

The cracking behavior of these coatings under four point bending load was examined using an acoustic emission (AE) recorder. The numbers of AE events exhibited during the elastic and plastic deformation of coatings were analyzed. Using multi-linear regression analysis, {{the number of}} AE events was correlated to the spray parameters. This analysis revealed that coatings with thicker YSZ top coat and NiCrYAl bond coat sprayed on a heated substrate at shorter <b>stand</b> <b>off</b> <b>distance</b> exhibited more AE activity and released higher AE energy under the bending.

First, measurements {{were carried out}} on standard samples in order to verify the accuracy and reliability of the Archimedian method. Then, porosity measurements were taken for hydroxyapatite samples and correlated to its physical properties. The results from the experiments show that as the crystallinity of the HAp increases, the porosity increases. Also, as the amorphous content increases, porosity decreases.

40|$|The {{effect of}} very low speed forced flows {{on the size}} and shape of a solid fuel {{diffusion}} flame are investigated experimentally. Flows due to natural convection are eliminated by performing the experiment in low gravity. The range of velocities tested is 1. 5 cm/s to 6. 3 cm/s and the mole fraction of oxygen in the O 2 /N 2 atmosphere ranges from 0. 15 to 0. 19. The flames did not reach steady state in the 5. 2 sec to which the experiment was limited. Despite limited data, trends in the transient flame temperature and, by means of extrapolation, the steady state flame size are deduced. As the flow velocity is reduced, the flames move farther from the fuel surface, and the transient flame temperature is lowered. As the oxygen concentration is reduced the flames move closer to the fuel sample and the transient flame temperature is reduced. With <b>stand</b> <b>off</b> <b>distances</b> up to 8. 5 + or - 0. 7 mm and thicknesses around 1 or 2 mm, these flames are much weaker than flames observed at normal gravity.

The system’s instrumental response was 70 ps full width at half-maximum, which meant that 1 cm surface-to-surface resolution could be achieved by locating the centroids of each return signal.

40|$|The {{pressure}} distribution on {{the bottom}} of an armored vehicle caused by a detonating explosive buried in soil has been long of interest in the community of the Armed Services. This experimental study discusses results from small-scale tests conducted to determine the distribution of pressure on target plates when subjected to loading due to the detonation of buried mines. A new methodology has been developed in order to measure the pressure - time profiles {{on the bottom}} of a vehicle. The tests are conducted by using water, saturated sand, and dry sand as the loading media. Different <b>stand</b> <b>off</b> <b>distances</b> are investigated using saturated sand. Kolsky bars and pressure sensors, on the target plate, are used to determine the free-field pressure - time profile of the output of the charge at any location for the vehicle bottom. For verification of the pressure results at certain distances, the specific impulse measured by utilizing different size round plates are employed. In order to investigate the loading mechanisms, high speed cameras are applied. The small-scale test results can be scaled to full scale by using verified scaling laws. The results of this research are of interest to the U. S NAVY and U. S ARMY in order to develop and evaluate computer codes which are mainly used in soil models.

40|$|Efficient {{methods to}} model and {{optimise}} {{the design of}} open cut mines have been known for many years. The design of the infrastructure of underground mines has a similar potential for optimisation and strategic planning. Over {{the last five years}} our group has developed two pieces of software to tackle this problem – UNO (Underground Network Optimiser) and DOT (Decline Optimisation Tool). The idea is to connect up a system of declines, ramps, drives and possibly shafts, to minimise capital development and haulage costs over the lifetime of a mine. Constraints that can be handled by the software include: gradient bounds (typically 1 : 7), turning circle restrictions for navigability, and obstacle avoidance. The latter constraint keeps development at <b>stand</b> <b>off</b> <b>distances</b> from orebodies and ensures it avoids regions that involve high cost, such as faults, voids and other geological features. The software is not limited to only interconnecting fixed points. It has the useful feature that a group of points can be specified such that the development is required to connect to one member of the group. So for example, if an existing ventilation rise must be accessed at some level, then a group of points along the rise can be selected. Similarly, this gives the opportunity to use variable length cross-cuts from a decline to an orebody. The latter gives important flexibility and can significantly reduce the development and haulage cost of a design. Finally, the goals for the next phase of development for this project will be discussed, including speeding up the algorithms and allowing for heterogeneous materials, such as aquifers and faults, as additional costs rather than obstacles...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the project}} is to {{investigate}} the detail of cavitation loading and erosion process using a submerged jet cavitation technique. Large size cavitating jet apparatus in the University of Nottingham was used with an long orifice nozzle and experiments were carried out using tap water as a test liquid with upstream pressure ranging from 8 D- 120 bar. Distribution of the mean pressure, cavity clouds and cavitation damage on a specimen have been obtained and their mutual relation was discussed. Effects of pressures and stand off distances {{on the characteristics of}} the erosion produced by the cavitating jet were studied and the results were compared with previous investigations. These include not only the weight loss but also the size of the damage and the jet length both related with the optimum <b>stand</b> <b>off</b> <b>distance.</b> Indentations on soft aluminium produced by the cavitating jet were investigated. Their size distributions were obtained for various pressures and stand off distances. Variations of the total number and the average size of indentations with <b>stand</b> <b>off</b> <b>distance</b> were also presented. The cavitation loading pulses were successfully measured by a novel piezoelectric pressure transducer using PYDF polymer and the pulse height measurement system, both of which were developed in the present project. During the process to determine the size of the sensitive area of the transducer, its effect on the pulse height was found. Then, the loading pressure was estimated from the pulse height and the indentation size distribution. The value estimated is around 2 GPa and compared with results of the other investigators using similar method with different, vibratory and water tunnel, cavitation facilities. All of them show the similar magnitude. Good correlations of the indentation counting and the pulse height analysis with erosion results were obtained in terms of the intensity of cavitation loading.

These 17 groups of coating types, with six identical samples in each group, were four point bend tested while coupled with an in-situ acoustic emission transducer. Optical microscopy was then used to examine and map the resulting crack patterns. Measurements of the number of cracks, crack separation, delaminating length, and micro-crack density were also made. The combination of this information, along with properties obtained from the four point bend tests and acoustic emission signals, provided insight into the cracking and delaminating processes...|$|E
40|$|During {{the recent}} years, several {{promising}} finite element solutions {{have been presented}} for finding the response of structures subjected to blast loading. This thesis gives as a comparative study on 3 major solution strategies, and their implication on the response on constrained plates of varying standoff distances. The strategies chosen are the Lagrangian method using load blast function in LS-DYNA, in which the plate nodes are subjected directly to forces attained from empirical ConWep data. The Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) method in LS-DYNA, where an initial charge is detonated within an air medium and impulse transferred through contact algorithms. Finally a particle method, where air and soil are treated as discrete particles. This novel approach gives faster calculations than the ALE method and possible more reliable results than the Lagrangian method. Dharmasena et. al (2009) performed experiments where final deflection of steel plates was recorded for a charge off constant mass with varying standoff distances. These results were used to validate the models. It {{was found that the}} Lagrangian analysis provided conservative results at short standoff distances, and very accurate predictions at greater distances. An ALE analysis was performed under the same assumptions. Even though the analysis gave accurate final deflections at short standoff distances, it was found to be giving increasing impulse with standoff distance, for fine meshes. This resulted in increasing final deflection with standoff distance, which was unsupported by experimental data. Finally, a discrete particle method has been applied using the IMPETUS code. It gave the most accurate prediction in terms of final deflections. It was found to give almost equal results as the ALE analysis for short standoff distances, and equal results as the Lagrangian analysis for the longer <b>stand</b> <b>off</b> <b>distances.</b> The computational times were also greatly reduced compared to the ALE method. </p...|$|R
