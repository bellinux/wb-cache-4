25|$|In 1982 Marriott {{was back}} on the road with Jim Leverton (bass, backing vocals), former Steppenwolf keyboardist Goldy McJohn and Chicago born drummer Fallon Williams III. This {{grouping}} was originally set to be called The Official Receivers, The Three Trojans (after McJohn departed) or The Pie but ended up being billed by promoters as Humble Pie. McJohn was let go after suffering drug troubles and the remaining trio toured Australia in October 1982 billed mostly as Small Faces to entice patrons. In January 1983 Leverton ran into trouble at US Immigration and was deported back to England. Marriott based himself in the Atlanta, Georgia area, since that was where his second wife, Pamela Stephens, was from, and continued to tour clubs as Humble Pie. Atlanta musician Keith Christopher (from The Brains) took over bass and a young guitarist from Tennessee, Tommy Johnson, joined as well. And after a hoped for deal with Capricorn Records in nearby Macon fell through after that label's second collapse, this line-up went into Pyramid Eye Studios in Chattanooga, Tennessee to record three songs for a projected album, but nothing further came from it. After Johnson missed a show, he was replaced by Phil Dix. The band was then scheduled to record demos with Yes/ELP producer Eddy Offord at Eddy's studio in Atlanta with Rick Richards (also from The Brains and soon to find fame with the Georgia Satellites) as the new guitarist. But when Rick and Keith missed rehearsals, Steve was <b>so</b> <b>mad</b> that he not only fired Rick but Keith as well. The recordings were done with Fallon on drums and Dave Hewitt (ex-Babe Ruth) on bass. But when these demos failed to attract another record deal and Pamela left Steve for another man, Steve disbanded this version of the Pie and departed the US to return to England in late 1983.|$|E
500|$|The {{relative}} {{failure of}} Allegro reinforced the team's determination {{to have another}} hit. [...] Author James Michener recalled his meeting with the duo over the possibility of converting his book Tales of the South Pacific into a musical. [...] "They were inwardly burning because of the reception accorded to Allegro. [...] Those fellows were <b>so</b> <b>mad</b> I was fairly certain that {{they could make a}} great musical out of the Bronx telephone directory." [...] That project would become South Pacific and be a tremendous hit.|$|E
500|$|The seventh track, [...] "Freakshow", {{is built}} around the [...] "wobbler" [...] effect of dubstep. Spears sings about dancing and being in the {{spotlight}} in lyrics such as [...] "Make them other chicks <b>so</b> <b>mad</b> / I'm 'bout to shake my ass / Watch that boy". During the bridge, her vocals are pitched down low, making her sound masculine. Nearly {{a decade after the}} release of Blackout, Spears stated [...] "Freakshow" [...] is one of her favorite tracks that weren't released as singles, describing it as [...] "sassy".|$|E

500|$|After audiences {{began to}} view Van Winkle as a novelty act and a pop star {{rather than a}} {{legitimate}} rapper, his popularity began to decline. Detroit-based rapper Eminem states that when he first heard [...] "Ice Ice Baby", [...] "I felt like I didn't want to rap anymore. I was <b>so</b> <b>mad,</b> because he was making it real hard for me." [...] Van Winkle lost some credibility among hip hop fans, but later began to regain some success, attracting a new audience outside of the mainstream audience that had formerly accepted him, and then rejected him. [...] "Ice Ice Baby" [...] {{continues to be the}} song that Van Winkle is best known for internationally, although Van Winkle states that his American fans like his newer music better.|$|E
500|$|The {{album is}} named after an {{incident}} at The Pump Room restaurant in Chicago, Illinois. Collins, entering the restaurant with former Led Zeppelin lead vocalist Robert Plant, was denied admittance {{because he did not}} meet the restaurant's dress code of [...] "jacket required" [...] for dinner while Plant was allowed in. Collins was wearing a jacket and argued about it. The maître d'hôtel argued that the jacket was not [...] "proper". Collins {{said in an interview with}} Playboy that he was, at that point, never <b>so</b> <b>mad</b> in his life. After the incident, the singer often appeared on shows such as Late Night with David Letterman and The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, denouncing the restaurant and telling his story. The management of the restaurant later sent him a complimentary sport coat and an apology letter, stating that he could come to the restaurant wearing whatever he wanted.|$|E
500|$|Minaj {{commented on}} On Air with Ryan Seacrest that [...] "I {{feel like the}} music is such a better {{representation}} of me where I am now as an artist in my career. As long as people can hear the music, I'm good." [...] Much of the new material incorporates hip hop and R styles previously seen in Minaj's earlier mixtapes. The opening track [...] "Up in Flames" [...] incorporates a [...] "slow, heavy and melodramatic beat", where Minaj addresses her wealth and delivers negative remarks directed towards her adversaries. The second song [...] "Freedom" [...] was compared to material from her debut studio album Pink Friday (2010); it utilizes minimal production and reflects on Minaj's rise to prominence. The third song [...] "Hell Yeah" [...] features Parker and further criticizes Minaj's opponents. She references her much-publicized on-set tension with fellow American Idol judge Mariah Carey in the line [...] "But I'm quick to check a bitch if she’s outta line" [...] and references the series' personnel in the line [...] "Shout out Mike Darnell and Nigel [...] / Why these bums <b>so</b> <b>mad</b> that the queen on Idol".|$|E

500|$|The title design, {{that was}} awarded Excellence in Title Design at South by Southwest, {{was made by}} Allison and Anthony Brownmoore of Blue Spill {{production}} studio. Kijak's requirement was to [...] "blow people off their seats". According to Anthony Brownmoore, the project was a challenge, since he [...] "was very taken by their [...] look but that can also be quite daunting. To try to make something and be creative with something that's already <b>so</b> <b>mad</b> and so creative". They worked on the title design for months, syncing it to the song [...] "Jade" [...] {{the way that the}} images would pulsate to Yoshiki's drum beats. When creating the background sequences, they used the band's slogan, Psychedelic Violence Crime of Visual Shock as an inspiration. They used old photos of the band members, pairing them up with pulsating, moving, otherworldly backgrounds, for example they filmed floating fluorescent paint in a fish tank with a GoPro camera. The scene where Toshi appears to be standing on top of a waterfall, was filmed in the couple's own kitchen sink with running tap water, while the camera emerging from the water to show the waterfall was actually filmed in Greece. Adobe After Effects and Smoke was used during the production.|$|E
500|$|Series creator Chris Carter {{explained}} that the cast listing for the episode, along with [...] "Patient X" [...] was [...] "longer than most cast lists you'll ever see on a TV series". In order {{to allow for the}} increased expenses of hiring additional actors, Carter and the producers of the series talked Fox into allowing the episodes to be slightly more expensive because they would lead into the soon-to-be-released X-Files movie. Carter explained, [...] "we convinced them to spend the extra money to do this extra special work because it was all leading up to [...] when the X-Files movie would be released." [...] In addition, the child he gave the message to was a young boy and the son of production manager J.P. Finn. Rob Bowman originally intended to direct the episode but, due to reshoots, he was unable to do it, resulting in Carter directing. Bowman later recounted, [...] "I was supposed to direct 'The Red and the Black' [...] but we were prepping for the reshoots [...] so I couldn't do it. [...] Chris had to direct this episode. He was <b>so</b> <b>mad</b> at me." [...] When filming the scene where Mulder and Scully go to a medic station, Carter made homage to the medical drama ER, filming it entirely with a Steadicam.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{arriving}} in the NBA, Javie developed a reputation early for having a [...] "quick trigger finger", and he {{was believed to be}} one of the league leaders in calling technical fouls during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Reflecting on his early years in the league, Javie told Sports Illustrated in October 2000, [...] "I'd get <b>so</b> <b>mad</b> I'd lose control for two or three minutes, and that's when I would miss calls." [...] Javie developed mentorships with referees Joe Crawford and Jack Madden to assist in the maturation process. [...] Working his debut game with Crawford at the Pontiac Silverdome in Detroit, Michigan, Javie received a grade of 40 points out of 100 by supervisor Darell Garretson. [...] While reviewing game film later at the hotel, Crawford noted errors made throughout the game by himself. [...] As a result of this film study, Javie learned that experienced officials make mistakes and admitting error will improve a referee's ability in the long-term. Ninety minutes after the conclusion of a game, Javie reviews game film. [...] In addition to film review, Madden taught Javie not to lose focus when players and coaches were upset, and to walk away from them rather than becoming angry. [...] Javie credited his mentors for success as a referee saying, [...] "My mentors have made me what I am today. I'm a little part of each of them. It's their success in teaching me." ...|$|E

Lewin's {{direction}} is static, yet his staging is <b>so</b> luxuriantly <b>mad</b> that it's {{easy to get}} fixated on what, if anything, {{he could have had}} in mind. Sally Bowles might have called it divinely incoherent--it's as nutty-fruity as another Ava Gardner film, The Barefoot Contessa, but without as much talk." ...|$|R

2500|$|Billingsley, however, {{questioned}} her character's {{reactions to the}} Cleaver children's misbehavior, basing her concern on personal experience {{as the mother of}} two sons. As the co-producer Joseph Connelly explained, [...] "In scenes where she's mad at the boys, she's always coming over to us with the script and objecting. 'I don't see why June is <b>so</b> <b>mad</b> over what Beaver's done. I certainly wouldn't be.' As a result, many of Beaver's crimes have been rewritten into something really heinous like lying about them, in order to give his mother a strong motive for blowing her lady-like stack." ...|$|E
2500|$|Thomas quickly had {{to adjust}} to Knight's disciplinarian style. At the 1979 Pan American Games in Puerto Rico Knight got <b>so</b> <b>mad</b> at Thomas he {{threatened}} {{to put him on}} a plane home. Knight recalled yelling at the freshman-to-be, [...] "You ought to go to DePaul, Isiah, because you sure as hell aren't going to be an Indiana player playing like that." [...] Prior to the start of his freshman year, the 1979–80 season, Knight became so upset with Thomas that he kicked him out of a practice. According to Thomas, Knight was making a point that no player, no [...] "matter how talented, is bigger than Knight's philosophy." ...|$|E

2500|$|When Pu Tong Seal {{brought back}} the captive to Theizang, Pu Tong Seal's {{father-in-law}} thought that his son-in-law's action was detrimental to his people, and had great concern and fear that the Burmans would invade Theizang, which was situated nearby the Kalay valley. The father-in-law was <b>so</b> <b>mad,</b> and wasn't ready yet to condone this sort of behavior that could jeopardize and endanger their livelihoods, that he hit Pu Tong Seal with a long stick known as [...] "Ak ngawciang" [...] locally, that was usually used to keep chickens away from their grains while exposing them to the sunlight. The father-in-law fervently hoped that a peaceful solution would soon be found.|$|E
2500|$|Noriko calmly accepts this {{sexual content}} when couched in the [...] "archaic" [...] form of Noh drama, {{but when she}} sees her father nod politely to the {{attractive}} widow, Mrs. Miwa, who {{is also in the}} audience, [...] "that strikes Noriko as outrageous and outraging. Had this woman and her father arranged to meet at this play about sexuality? Is this remarriage 'filthy' like [...] remarriage? She feels both angry and despairing. She is <b>so</b> <b>mad</b> at her father that, quite uncharacteristically, she angrily walks away from him after they leave the theater." [...] Holland thus sees one of the film's main themes as [...] "the pushing of traditional and inhibited Noriko into marriage." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{a meeting}} at the War Office (4 November 1913), Wilson told French, who had {{recently}} been asked by the King for his views, that he for one “could not fire on the north at the dictates of Redmond” and that “England qua England is opposed to Home Rule, and England must agree to it … I cannot bring myself to believe that Asquith will be <b>so</b> <b>mad</b> as to employ force”. It is unclear what Wilson meant by [...] "England qua England", although he did believe that the Government should be forced to fight a General Election on the issue, which on the basis of recent by-elections the Conservatives might win. Each side thought the other was bluffing. French, whom Wilson urged to tell the King that he could not depend on the loyalty of the whole of the Army, was unaware that Wilson was leaking the contents of these meetings to the Conservative leader Bonar Law.|$|E

2500|$|In 1921, Ty Cobb {{took over}} from Hughie Jennings {{as manager of}} the Tigers. Bush became {{involved}} in repeated arguments with Cobb's [...] "first lieutenant", Dan Howley. The Detroit Free Press wrote that Howley [...] "never is quite so contented" [...] as he is when arguing with Bush and added: [...] "Bush would fight {{at the drop of}} a hat for Dan, yet the midget never gets nearly <b>so</b> <b>mad</b> at anyone as he does when Howley, with deliberate intent, corners Donie somewhere and starts a debate[...] [...] [...] Often Donie becomes so enraged that he pulls his cap off his head and throwing it off the door of the hotel lobby or in the turf of the ball field, stamps on it in his hysteria." [...] For the first half of the season, Bush continued as the Tigers' starting shortstop. Halfway through the season, however, Cobb moved Bush from his regular shortstop position to second base.|$|E
2500|$|In 1999, Gurewitz {{reunited with}} Graffin to co-write a song together, called [...] "Believe It", which would appear on their next album, The New America (2000). For it, Todd Rundgren, an early musical {{inspiration}} for Graffin, {{was brought in}} to produce. [...] "Todd was kind of an underground sensation back in 1974. Here's a guy who was making pop music but in a way that you wouldn't hear on the radio. So much of my early musical identity was wrapped up in the way he conducted himself." [...] In the summer of 2000, they set out on a 3-month U.S. arena tour opening for Blink-182. Unfortunately, the experience might not have been all that Greg {{and the rest of the}} band might have hoped. Interest in recording the record waned, due to Rundgren's poor attitude. Jay Bentley reflects on this by saying, [...] "I didn't feel we were going anywhere and so did Greg. Todd didn't like Greg and that made Greg <b>so</b> <b>mad!</b> He met his idol and he was a jerk! I don't think Todd gave a shit about anything." [...] However, Graffin later writes in his book, Anarchy Evolution, that although Todd Rundgren was difficult to work with, he and Graffin are friends to this day. Meanwhile, Bobby Schayer left the band following a serious shoulder injury and was replaced by Brooks Wackerman (Suicidal Tendencies).|$|E
2500|$|Significant edits {{were made}} to {{aggressive}} and violent lyrics that were aimed at police, prostitutes, women, homosexuals, and schools. In response to the attack that had occurred at Columbine High School in April 1999, names of guns and sounds of them firing were censored. [...] Interscope Records insisted on censoring the words [...] "kids" [...] and [...] "Columbine" [...] from the line [...] "I take seven [...] from , stand them all in line" [...] from [...] "I'm Back", even on the explicit version of the album. Mike Rubin of Spin called the censorship a [...] "curious decision, given that lyrics like 'Take drugs / Rape sluts' are apparently permissible". Eminem commented on his lyrics regarding the shooting, [...] "That Columbine shit is so fucking touchy. As much sympathy as we give the Columbine shootings, nobody ever looked {{at it from the}} fuckin' {{point of view of the}} kids who were bullied—I mean, they took their own fucking life!
