Computational solutions are presented for two example design problems. A comparison among solutions for different ratios of stiffness between the two materials gives an indication of how the distribution of concentrated <b>stiffer</b> <b>material</b> varies with this factor.

50|$|The metal used to {{construct}} modern optical tables has a higher speed of sound than granite and therefore a higher frequency of the first eigenmode. Any vibration produced on the table below this frequency does not produce a resonant response, making the setup less sensitive to vibrations from motorized optics, cooling water pumps, etc. Vibration damping may be added to tables during their construction. As with granite's composite structure, the combination of several <b>stiff</b> <b>materials</b> with different speeds of sound produces a table for which {{a wide range of}} vibrations are critically damped.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to determine if cycling shoes made with <b>stiff</b> <b>material</b> cause an increase in peak plantar stress over shoes with less <b>stiff</b> <b>material.</b> Shoe stiffness measurements were collected under controlled conditions and in two different configurations using a dynamic hydraulic tensile testing machine. Measurements of plantar stress were taken while subjects pedaled in a seated position at a controlled power output of 400 Watts. Capacitive-based sensor insoles were placed in the shoes to measure the peak stress under each foot during pedaling. The shoes made with carbon fiber produced peak plantar stresses 18 % higher than those of a more traditional plastic design (121. 2 kPa vs. 103. 0 kPa, p-value = 0. 005). Carbon fiber shoes presented stiffness values 42 % and 550 % higher than plastic shoes in longitudinal bending and three-point bending, respectively...|$|R

40|$|A dynamic mechanical. thermal {{analysis}} (DMTA) performed on stacked coated supports or on samples sandwiched between rigid supports (carbon or glass fibers, metal or glass plates, [...] .) is described. The {{choice of a}} dual cantilever deformation favors the shear strain of the less <b>stiff</b> <b>material</b> between the more rigid supports. A theoretical model demonstrates that the less <b>stiff</b> <b>material</b> response is mainly recorded and moreover amplified. An exceptional sensitivity to the soft material is therefore observed. This method does not require any special sample (only stacking of coated supports or sample sandwiching) whilst it enables to characterize in situ polymer coating, even nanocoating. This characterization is of prime interest in technological coating developments such as paints, fiber sizings, glues, [...] . This possible measurement of thermal transitions peculiar to nanocoatings also opens more fundamental studies as the probing of interface influence on thermal transitions.

40|$|In {{order to}} reduce {{environmental}} ground vibration due to railway traffic, mitigation measures at the source, the transmission path and the receiver can be applied. Mitigation measures on the transmission path are particularly appealing in situations with existing track and buildings. In this contribution, the optimal design of stiff wave barriers is considered. Up to now, wall barriers with a rectangular cross section have mostly been studied. However, current construction methods of wave barriers provide a wide flexibility in design geometry. Therefore further improvement is feasible. Topology optimization is used to discover novel, improved design geometries. <b>Stiffer</b> <b>material</b> is inserted into a design domain located between the source and a building. The objective is to minimize the amount of <b>stiffer</b> <b>material</b> in the design domain while satisfying the required vibration criteria in the building. The optimization problem is solved using a gradient based method and the adjoint method is used to enable an efficient calculation of the sensitivities. In this way, an optimal geometry is determined that considerably reduces the required amount of <b>stiffer</b> <b>material.</b> Topology optimized <b>stiff</b> wave barriers are therefore effective in reducing vibration levels, outperforming the rectangular wave barriers. The design contains, however, small features, making it sensitive to geometric imperfections, and a worst case robust optimization is applied. The resulting smaller sensitivity with respect to geometric imperfections also ensures that a posteriori design simplifications have a minimal impact on the barriers performance. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|In {{the second}} half of the 19th century the ideal of Victorian manliness became {{increasingly}} defined by imperialism because the subordination of non-western cultures was in its heyday in Britain. Thus, part of the concept of masculinity became military and patriotic virtue, which defined the ideal man as courageous and enduring like hunters, adventurers, and pioneers, all of whom were profoundly self-sufficient and independent and had broad scientific knowledge.
