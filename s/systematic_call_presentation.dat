The first release, named BRUNO (after an HP sales training puppet), ran on the HP 1000 minicomputer taking advantage of HP's first bitmapped computer terminal the HP 2640.

40|$|Cervical {{screening}} {{has been}} shown to be effective in several countries, although not by means of randomised controlled trials. A screening programme has been in operation in the United Kingdom since 1964, but it has, in the past, been beset with problems of organisation, accountability, and commitment. The introduction in 1988 of a <b>systematic</b> <b>call</b> and recall introduction in 1988 of a <b>systematic</b> <b>call</b> and recall system and the setting up of an NHS cervical screening programme national coordinating network has brought a greater sense of coherence. Coverage of the target population in England between 1989 - 90 and 1992 - 3 increased from 61 % to 83 %, and there is a strong indication that cervical screening is now beginning to reach those most at risk [...] namely, older women from lower social classes. Primary care is central to the overall success of the cervical screening programme. General practitioners are in a unique position to invite women for a smear test, to take smears, to ensure that abnormal smear test results are followed up, and to check on reasons for non-attendance. Numerous studies have looked at the involvement of general practice in cervical screening, identifying many ways in which the programme can be improved. Many practices are now running well organised and effective programmes...|$|R

50|$|In every swap chain {{there are}} at least two buffers. The first framebuffer, the screenbuffer, is the buffer that is {{rendered}} to the output of the video card. The remaining buffers are known as backbuffers. Each time a new frame is displayed, the first backbuffer in the swap chain takes the place of the screenbuffer, this is <b>called</b> <b>presentation</b> or swapping. A variety of other actions may be taken on the previous screenbuffer and other backbuffers (if they exist). The screenbuffer may be simply overwritten or returned to the back of the swap chain for further processing. The action taken is decided by the client application and is API dependent.|$|R

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} differences was the coordinate system. While in Windows the 0,0 coordinate was located in the upper left corner, in PM it was in the lower left corner. Another difference was that all drawing operations went to the Device Context (DC) in Windows. PM also used DCs but there was an added level of abstraction <b>called</b> <b>Presentation</b> Space (PS). OS/2 also had more powerful drawing functions in its Graphics Programming Interface (GPI). Some of the GPI concepts (like viewing transforms) were later incorporated into Windows NT. The OS/2 programming model was thought to be cleaner, since {{there was no need to}} explicitly export the window procedure, no WinMain, and no non-standard function prologs and epilogs.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Diverse {{types of}} {{structured}} domain models are nowadays {{in use in}} various contexts. On the one hand there are generic models, especially domain ontologies, which are typically used in applications with artificial intelligence (reasoning) flavor; {{on the other hand}} there are more specific models that only come to use in areas like software engineering or business analysis. Furthermore, the discipline of information extraction has invented very specific knowledge models called extraction ontologies, whose purpose is to help extract and semantically annotate textual data. In this paper we present a constituents <b>called</b> <b>presentation</b> ontologies) via reusing different types of other knowledge models, especially domain ontologies and UML models. Our priority is to maintain consistency between extracted data and those prior models...|$|R

In the TablePresenter, a user ed-its a table on Microsoft Excel, and also {{specifies}} the pre-sentation contents for explaining {{the table in}} the form of tree structure, <b>called</b> <b>presentation</b> tree. The system then generates animated presentation by an agent. Presenta-tion trees have intermediate nodes labeled as “contrast ” and “compare, ” and such types of nodes are associated with ap-propriate speech text templates with gesture specifications. Traversing the presentation tree then yields speech texts for explaining the table, and the resultant texts animate the agent. We developed a prototype TablePresenter system, and it successfully generated animated presentations for ta-bles.

30|$|A <b>presentation</b> {{training}} system <b>called</b> <b>Presentation</b> Sensei was implemented {{to observe a}} presentation rehearsal and give presentation feedback to the speaker Kurihara et al. (2007). The system {{is equipped with a}} microphone and camera to analyze the presentation by combining speech and image processing techniques. Based on the results of the analysis, the system provides the speaker with recommendations for improving presentation delivery such as speed and audience engagement. During the presentation, the system can alert the speaker when some of the indices: speaking rate, eye contact with the audience, and timing, exceed predefined warning thresholds. After the presentation, the system generates summaries of the analysis results for the user’s self-examination. Although this system focuses on self-training, it still needs to be tested in a real presentation environment.|$|R

The web browser sends requests to the middle tier, which services them by making queries and updates against the database and generates a user interface.|$|R

In this project, the placement problem consists of a computer-aided visual placement of interaction objects (IO) included in a more composite IO <b>called</b> <b>Presentation</b> Unit (PU). Two strategies for placing IO within a PU are characterised and investigated : a static twocolumn based strategy and a dynamic right/bottom strategy. Each strategy decomposes the placement into three partially overlapping dimensions : localisation, dimensioning, and arrangement. A set of simple mathematical relationships is introduced to rate the quality of visual principles gained with the result of each strategy within the three dimensions. This rating shows that the lack of flexibility should lead us more towards a dynamic strategy for computer-aided visual placement. KEYWORDS: Dynamic Strategy, Grid, Interaction Objec [...] ...|$|R
