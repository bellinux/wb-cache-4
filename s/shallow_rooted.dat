5|$|Early on November 30, as {{the system}} moved towards the east-southeast, TCWC Nadi issued a gale warning for the Cook Islands of Rarotonga and Mangaia, while issuing strong wind {{warnings}} and tropical cyclone alerts {{for the rest of}} the Southern Islands. The warnings were subsequently maintained until later that day, as Sina spared the Cook Islands its major effects and re-curved sharply towards the south-southeast. Only minor damage to <b>shallow</b> <b>rooted</b> crops and weak structures was reported, after high seas and gale force winds buffeted the northern side of Rarotonga.|$|E
500|$|The 1920s saw a {{population}} boom in South Florida {{that created the}} Florida land boom fueled by a demand for land described by author Michael Grunwald as [...] "insanity". Land was sold before any homes or structures were built on it, {{and in some cases}} before any plans for construction were in place. New landowners, eager to make good on their investments, hastily constructed homes and small towns on recently drained land. Mangrove trees on the coasts were taken down for better views and replaced with <b>shallow</b> <b>rooted</b> palm trees. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began construction on larger canals to control the rising waters in the Everglades. Nevertheless, Lake Okeechobee continued to rise and fall, the region was covered with rain, and city planners continued to battle the water. The 1926 Miami Hurricane caused Lake Okeechobee levees to fail; hundreds of people who had just moved in south of the lake drowned. Two years later, the 1928 Okeechobee Hurricane claimed 2,500lives when Lake Okeechobee once again surged over its levees. Politicians who declared the Everglades uninhabitable were silenced when a four-story wall, the Herbert Hoover Dike, was built around Lake Okeechobee. This wall effectively cut off the water source from the Everglades.|$|E

40|$|Drought is {{the most}} serious abiotic stress {{limiting}} rice production, and deep root is the key contributor to drought avoidance. However, the genetic mechanism regulating the development of deep roots is largely unknown. In this study, the transcriptomes of 74 root samples from 37 rice varieties, representing the extreme genotypes of <b>shallow</b> or deep <b>rooting,</b> were surveyed by RNA-seq. The 13, 242 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between deep <b>rooting</b> and <b>shallow</b> <b>rooting</b> varieties (H vs. L) were enriched in the pathway of genetic information processing and metabolism, while the 1, 052 DEGs between the deep <b>roots</b> and <b>shallow</b> <b>roots</b> from each of the plants (D vs. S) were significantly enriched in metabolic pathways especially energy metabolism. Ten quantitative trait transcripts (QTTs) were identified and some were involved in energy metabolism. Forty-nine candidate DEGs were confirmed by qRT-PCR and microarray. Through weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), we found 18 hub genes. Surprisingly, all these hub genes expressed higher in deep <b>roots</b> than in <b>shallow</b> <b>roots,</b> furthermore half of them functioned in energy metabolism. We also estimated that the ATP production in the deep roots was faster than <b>shallow</b> <b>roots.</b> Our results provided a lot of reliable candidate genes to improve deep rooting, and firstly highlight the importance of energy metabolism to the development of deep roots...|$|R

40|$|<b>Shallow</b> basal <b>root</b> growth angle (BRGA) {{increases}} phosphorus acquisition efficiency {{by enhancing}} topsoil foraging because in most soils, phosphorus {{is concentrated in}} the topsoil. Root hair length and density (RHL/D) increase phosphorus acquisition by expanding the soil volume subject to phosphorus depletion through diffusion. We hypothesized that shallow BRGA and large RHL/D are synergetic for phosphorus acquisition, meaning that their combined effect {{is greater than the}} sum of their individual effects. To evaluate this hypothesis, phosphorus acquisition in the field in Mozambique was compared among recombinant inbred lines of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) having four distinct root phenotypes: long <b>root</b> hairs and <b>shallow</b> basal <b>roots,</b> long root hairs and deep basal roots, short <b>root</b> hairs and <b>shallow</b> basal <b>roots,</b> and short root hairs and deep basal roots. The results revealed substantial synergism between BRGA and RHL/D. Compared with short-haired, deep-rooted phenotypes, long root hairs increased shoot biomass under phosphorus stress by 89 %, while <b>shallow</b> <b>roots</b> increased shoot biomass by 58 %. Genotypes with both long <b>root</b> hairs and <b>shallow</b> <b>roots</b> had 298 % greater biomass accumulation than short-haired, deep-rooted phenotypes. Therefore, the utility of <b>shallow</b> basal <b>roots</b> and long root hairs for phosphorus acquisition in combination is twice as large as their additive effects. We conclude that the anatomical phene of long, dense root hairs and the architectural phene of <b>shallower</b> basal <b>root</b> growth are synergetic for phosphorus acquisition. Phene synergism may be common in plant biology and can have substantial importance for plant fitness, as shown here...|$|R
40|$|Key message Deep root {{hydraulic}} conductance is upregulated during severe {{drought and}} {{is associated with}} upregulation in aquaporin activity. In 2011, Texas experienced the worst single-year drought in its recorded history and, based on tree-ring data, likely its worst in the past millennium. In the Edwards Plateau of Texas, rainfall was 58 % lower and the mean daily maximum temperatures were > 5 Â°C higher than long-term means in June through September, resulting in extensive tree mortality. To better understand the balance of deep and <b>shallow</b> <b>root</b> functioning for water supply, we measured root hydraulic conductance (KR) in deep (~ 20 m) and shallow (5 - 10 cm) roots of Quercus fusiformis at four time points {{in the field in}} 2011. Deep roots of Q. fusiformis obtained water from a perennial underground (18 - 20 m) stream that was present even during the drought. As the drought progressed, deep root KR increased 2. 6 -fold from early season values and <b>shallow</b> <b>root</b> KR decreased by 50 % between April and September. Inhibitor studies revealed that aquaporin contribution to KR increased in deep roots and decreased in <b>shallow</b> <b>roots</b> as the drought progressed. Deep root aquaporin activity was upregulated during peak drought, likely driven by increased summer evaporative demand and the need to compensate for declining <b>shallow</b> <b>root</b> KR. A whole-tree hydraulic transport model predicted that trees with greater proportions of deep roots would have as much as five times greater transpiration during drought periods and could sustain transpiration during droughts without experiencing total hydraulic failure. Our results suggest that trees shift their dependence on deep <b>roots</b> versus <b>shallow</b> <b>roots</b> during drought periods, and that upregulation of aquaporin activity accounts for at least part of this increase.

50|$|One {{important}} change in farming methods was the move in crop rotation to turnips and clover {{in place of}} fallow. Turnips can be grown in winter and are deep rooted, allowing them to gather minerals unavailable to <b>shallow</b> <b>rooted</b> crops. Clover fixes nitrogen from the atmosphere into a form of fertiliser. This permitted the intensive arable cultivation of light soils on enclosed farms and provided fodder to support increased livestock numbers whose manure added further to soil fertility.|$|E

It grows {{about two and a half}} feet tall, and is <b>shallow</b> <b>rooted</b> and thus suitable for container growing. The potato is suitable for roasting, baking or steaming. The potato is fairly small compared with modern cultivars, and when sliced has a purple ring near the edge. Once cooked it has a fluffy floury texture.|$|E
50|$|Causes of the tree's decline {{have been}} {{attributed}} to coal-burning locomotive soot and lowering of the water table by nearby orchard wells, including the 1912 Tower Well two blocks away. By the 1960s, the water table was so low that salt water was intruding into nearby wells, and Peninsula cities like Palo Alto began obtaining water from the Hetch Hetchy system. El Palo Alto was unable to access the lowered groundwater, as redwoods are typically <b>shallow</b> <b>rooted.</b>|$|E

30|$|When submerged, Indonesian rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars {{that belong}} to the Bulu ecotype develop thick primary roots above and near the soil surface (Lafitte et al. 2001; Ueno and Sato 1989, 1992).

The fresh weight of superficial roots is positively correlated with yields in paddy fields (Morita and Yamazaki 1993). Thus, soil-surface and <b>shallow</b> <b>roots</b> may contribute to the avoidance of hypoxic environments and promote rice growth.|$|R
