The Machine Check Handler (MCH) in SVS can correct a parity or ECC error in an unmodified page by unassigning the damaged page frame and marking the page table entry to cause a pagein operation into a newly assigned page table. This replaces the special handling of refreshable transient SVC routines in OS/360.|$|E

The S/360-67 virtual address space {{was divided into}} pages (of 4096 bytes) grouped into segments (of 1 million bytes); pages were dynamically mapped onto the processor's real memory. These S/360-67 features plus reference and change bits {{as part of the}} <b>storage</b> <b>key</b> enabled operating systems to implement demand paging: referencing a page that was not in memory caused a page fault, which in turn could be intercepted and processed by an operating system interrupt handler.|$|E

5000|$|Simulation {{is the use}} of a {{monitoring}} program to interpret the machine code instructions of some computer architectures. Such an instruction set simulator can provide memory protection by using a segmentation-like scheme and validating the target address and length of each instruction in real time before actually executing them. The simulator must calculate the target address and length and compare this against a list of valid address ranges that it holds concerning the thread's environment, such as any dynamic memory blocks acquired since the thread's inception, plus any valid shared static memory slots. The meaning of [...] "valid" [...] may change throughout the thread's life depending upon context. It may sometimes be allowed to alter a static block of storage, and sometimes not, depending upon the current mode of execution, {{which may or may not}} depend on a <b>storage</b> <b>key</b> or supervisor state.|$|E

40|$|Finding {{an optimal}} key {{assignment}} (subject to given constraints) for a key predistribution scheme in {{wireless sensor networks}} is a difficult task. Hence, most of the practical schemes are based on probabilistic key assignment, which leads to sub-optimal schemes requiring <b>key</b> <b>storage</b> linear in {{the total number of}} nodes. A graph theoretic framework is introduced to study the fundamental tradeoffs between <b>key</b> <b>storage,</b> average <b>key</b> path length (directly related to the battery consumption) and resilience (to compromised nodes) of key predistribution schemes for wireless sensor networks. Based on the proposed framework, a lower bound on <b>key</b> <b>storage</b> is derived for a given average key path length. An upper bound on the compromising probability is also given. This framework also leads to the design of key assignment schemes with a storage complexity of the same order as the lower bound...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Pooled semen {{from several}} inbred special chicken strains was diluted with {{solutions}} containing glycerol or dimethylacetamide as a cryoprotectant. One-half milliliter samples in capped glass vials were frozen at 3 C/min to- 35 C in a programmable freezer {{and stored in}} a nitrogen vapor tank. One vial of thawed semen was used to inseminate 4 hens by intravaginal, intrauterine, or intramagnal procedures. The intramagnal technique required minor surgery but always produced chicks in seven lines {{in contrast to the}} nonsurgical methods. Frozen semen of one strain stored for 29 weeks produced 12 to 14 chicks per vial when inseminated into 4 hens.

40|$|Abstract. We {{identify}} new organelles {{associated with}} the vacuolar system in plant cells. These organelles are defined biochemically by their internal content of three integral membrane proteins: a chimeric reporter protein that moves there directly from the ER; a specific tonoplast intrinsic protein; and a novel receptor-like RING-H 2 protein that traffics through the Golgi apparatus. Highly conserved homologues of the latter are expressed in animal cells. In a developmentally regulated manner, the organelles are taken up into vacuoles where, in seed protein storage vacuoles, they form a membrane-containing crystalloid. The uptake and preservation {{of the contents of}} these organelles in vacuoles represents a unique mechanism for compartmentalization of protein and lipid for <b>storage.</b> <b>Key</b> words: integral membrane protein • storage protein • prevacuolar compartment • autophagy • RING-H...|$|E
40|$|Growing {{evidence}} suggests that food intake, energy expenditure and endogenous glucose production are regulated by hypothalamic areas that respond {{to a variety of}} peripheral signals. Therefore, in response to a reduction in energy stores or circulating nutrients, the brain initiates responses in order to promote positive energy balance to restore and maintain energy and glucose homeostasis. In contrast, in times of nutrient abundance and excess energy <b>storage,</b> <b>key</b> hypothalamic areas activate responses to promote negative energy balance (i. e. reduced food intake and increased energy expenditure) and decreased nutrient availability (reduced endogenous glucose production). Accordingly, impaired responses or ‘resistance’ to afferent input from these hormonal or nutrient-related signals would be predicted to favour weight gain and insulin resistance and may {{contribute to the development of}} obesity and type 2 diabetes...|$|E

40|$|Mobile {{phones are}} {{increasingly}} used for security sensitive {{activities such as}} online banking or mobile payments. This usually involves some cryptographic operations, and there-fore introduces the problem of securely storing the corre-sponding keys on the phone. In this paper we evaluate the security provided by various options for secure <b>storage</b> of <b>key</b> material on Android, using either Android’s service for <b>key</b> <b>storage</b> or the <b>key</b> <b>storage</b> solution in the Bouncy Castle library. The security provided by the <b>key</b> <b>storage</b> service of the Android OS depends on the actual phone, as {{it may or may}} not make use of ARM TrustZone features. Therefore we investigate this for different models of phones. We find that the hardware-backed version of the Android OS service does offer device binding – i. e. keys cannot be exported from the device – though they could be used by any attacker with root access. This last limitation is not surprising, as it is a fundamental limitation of any secure storage service offered from the TrustZone’s secure world to the insecure world. Still, some of Android’s documentation is a bit misleading here. Somewhat to our surprise, we find that in some respects the software-only solution of Bouncy Castle is stronger than the Android OS service using TrustZone’s capabilities, in that it can incorporate a user-supplied password to secure access to keys and thus guarantee user consent...|$|R
