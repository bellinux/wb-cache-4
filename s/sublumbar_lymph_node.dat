Radiographic evidence of osteosarcoma development was first demonstrated at 10 to 15 days postinoculation in both groups. Subsequent radiographic and light and electron microscopic evaluation of tumor-bearing rats demonstrated that osteosarcomas in rats inoculated at Day 4 of age were more osteoproliferative osteosarcomas than those in rats inoculated on Day 1. Rats inoculated at 4 days of age lived longer, had more slowly growing osteosarcomas, and developed a consistent tumor-associated cachexia compared to tumor-bearing rats inoculated at Day 1. Both groups of rats had a 93 % metastasis rate involving either <b>sublumbar</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> lungs, or both. Tumor-bearing rats inoculated at 4 days of age had consistent elevations in both urinary hydroxyproline excretion (HOP/CR) and serum alkaline phosphatase levels, and in serum calcium levels at some time points.

Objective: The purpose of this report was to describe the clinical, cytologic, histologic, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural findings in a dog with metastatic balloon cell melanoma. Methods: A 6 -year-old female Golden Retriever was evaluated for a white, flocculent infiltrate in the anterior chamber of the left eye and an enlarged left prescapular <b>lymph</b> <b>node.</b> Cytologic evaluation of the eye and <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> were performed following aqueocentesis and fine-needle aspiration, respectively. The affected <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> was examined histologically and stained for cytokeratin, vimentin, S- 100, and Melan A. Following euthanasia a necropsy was performed and samples of the affected <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> were examined by electron microscopy. Results: Cytologic examination of the <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> and aqueocentesis sample revealed round neoplastic cells that had abundant clear vacuolated cytoplasm. A tentative diagnosis of metastatic sebaceous cell carcinoma or clear cell neoplasm was made. Histologically, the affected <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> had similar polygonal clear cells arranged in sheets and packets divided by delicate fibrovascular stroma. Immunohistochemical staining of the cells was negative for cytokeratin but positive for vimentin, weakly positive for S- 100, and strongly positive for Melan A. At necropsy, metastatic lesions were identified in the diaphragm, heart, lung, kidneys, left eye, prescapular and <b>sublumbar</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> and multiple skin sites. Ultrastructural examination of neoplastic <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> revealed many membranebound vacuoles, myelinlike figures, and rare melanosomes. Conclusion: Immunohistochemical staining and ultrastructural features of the neoplastic cells supported a diagnosis of metastatic balloon cell melanoma.

40|$|Hemangiosarcoma (HSA) is a {{malignant}} vascular neoplasm of endothelial origin with very aggressive behaviour. It occurs {{more frequently in}} dogs than in other spe-cies (Priester & McKay, 1980) and ac-counts for about 5 % of all canine malig-nancies (Oksanen, 1978). In dogs, the commonest primary sites of HSA are the spleen – 50 − 65 %, the right atrium – 3 − 25 %, the subcutaneous tissue – 13 − 17 % and the liver – 5 − 6 % (Smith, 2003). About 80 % of the dogs have me-tastases {{by the time of}} diagnosis. HSA tends to metastasize through haematoge-nous or transabdominal implantation and the most frequently reported metastatic sites are the liver, the omentum, the mes-entery, the lungs, and the brain (Withrow & MacEwen, 2001). In this study, a case of HSA in the right atrium and an enor-mous tumour metastasis in <b>sublumbar</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> causing atypical clinical presentation with tenesmus is described.

Methods: There are 10 patients, which they had stomach cancer involved in the study. As {{a result of this}} study before and during the cancer surgery, they had resectable cancer and they did not involve any <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> clinically. In all patients the sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> or <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> marked with radio nucleoid scan and the biopsy of the sentinel lymph nodeand lymphatic dissection done in standard way, then the patient put under the gastrectomy. At last, the pathology result of the sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> and other <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> have been compared and the concordance of them have been analysed. Results: Tumor location in 7 cases was in lesser curvature, one in greater curvature, one in antrum and one in EG junction. In 9 cases the sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> was against to the tumor in pregastric area, in one case of GE junction tumor, the sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> was in the hilum of spleen, and only in one case there was skip metastasis.

To identify the sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> for excision, a gamma-emitting radiotracer is injected inside the primary tumor and allowed to accumulate inside the sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node.</b> MSOT may provide a non-radioactive, non-invasive alternative for examination of the metastatic status of the sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node.</b> Initial {{studies have shown that}} MSOT can detect sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> based on indocyanine green (ICG) accumulation after injection in the tumor, as well as melanoma metastasis inside the <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> the spleen and Peyer's patches, {{are known}} as {{secondary}} lymphoid organs. <b>Lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> are found between lymphatic ducts and blood vessels. Afferent lymphatic vessels bring lymph fluid from the peripheral tissues to the <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> The <b>lymph</b> tissue in the <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> consists of immune cells (95%), for example lymphocytes, and stromal cells (1% to 5%) The genesis of <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> begins within the blood and the lymphatic system. Interactions between stromal and hematopoietic cells are important {{for the development of}} <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> Crosstalk LEC, lymphoid tissue inducer cells and mesenchymal stromal organizer cells initiate the formation of <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} value of the clearing technique and multilevel sectioning of <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> to aid in optimally examining axillary dissections for <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> metastases. One hundred consecutive mastectomy specimens with axillary dissections were initially examined by our routine technique: examination of fat for <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> by inspection and palpation and examination of one microsection from each <b>lymph</b> <b>node.</b> The remaining axillary tissue was then cleared using the technique of Durkin and Haagensen and each of the originally examined <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> was resectioned at two additional deeper levels. In our routine examination, 2203 <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> were found with 211 <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> containing metastatic tumor. Clearing disclosed 412 additional <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> of which 17 contained metastatic tumor. The two additional microsections of <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> revealed tumor in only two <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> which were initially free of tumor. The extended study of the axilla did not add significantly to our routine examination...|$|R

We were able to omit systematic <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> dissection by confirming the absence of inguinal <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> metastasis (-) through rapid pathological diagnosis.|$|R
