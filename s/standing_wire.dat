The oscillations of the sample reflectivity are correlated with individual modes of resonance for wires with a diameter ranging from 100 to 500 nm and are compared with 2 D finite element simulation.

We demonstrate elastic confinement in free <b>standing</b> <b>wires</b> which allowed the detection of up to the third harmonic of the breathing mode. By removing the energy relaxation channel towards the substrate, we obtained nano-oscillators with quality factors up to 130.

40|$|Ioffe-Pritchard trap. In {{the latter}} we have {{achieved}} the trapping parameters required in the experiments with Bose-Einstein condensates with much reduced power consumption. In a second time we have replaced the free <b>standing</b> <b>wires</b> with an atom chip, which we have used to compress the atomic cloud in potentials with trap frequencies above 100 kHz and ground state sizes below 100 nm. Such potentials are especially interesting for quantum information proposals of performing quantum gate operations with controlled collisions between trapped atoms. Finally, by combining two wire guides we have experimentally realized an innovative kind of beam splitter for guided atoms. We have investigated the splitting potential generated by a Y-shaped wire which has one input, i. e. the central arm of the Y, and two outputs corresponding {{to the left and}} right arms of the Y. By tuning the current ratio in the two outputs we have observed atoms switching from left to right as well as symmetric splitting. This and other similar designs are suitable for integration in more complex atomic circuits, i. e. atom interferometers, designed on the atom chip surface. Atom chips will open the way to a new generation of 'surface-mounted' experiments where many atom optical elements are assembled in a single circuit. Such a robust and easy to use device can find widespread applications from clocks and acceleration sensors to implementations of quantum information processing and communication. This thesis reports on the experimental demonstration of magnetic guides, traps and beam splitters for neutral atoms using current carrying wires. A straight wire allows to create two basic guide configurations: the magnetic field generated by the wire alone produces a guide where atoms in a strong field seeking state perform orbits around the wire (Kepler guide); by adding an external magnetic field, atoms in a weak field seeking state are guided at the location where the external field and the field generated by the wire cancel out (side guide). Furthermore, bending the wire in various shapes allows to modify the side guide potential and hence to create a large variety of three dimensional traps. A relevant property of these potentials is that higher trapping gradients are obtained by decreasing the current flowing in the wires. As the trap is compressed, it also moves closer to the wire. This feature has allowed us to create microscopic potentials by using thin wires designed on a surface (atom chip) by means of high resolution microfabrication techniques. Wires mounted on a surface have the advantage of being more robust and able to sustain larger currents due to their thermal coupling with the substrate. In our experiment we have developed methods to load these traps and guides with laser cooled atoms. Our first investigations have been performed with free <b>standing</b> <b>wires</b> which we have used to study the Kepler guide, the side guide and a three dimensiona...|$|R

40|$|Scanning Hall probe {{microscopy}} is {{a widely}} used technique for quantitative high resolution imaging of magnetic stray fields. Up to now probes with nanometer spatial resolution have only been realized by electron beam lithography, which is a slow and expensive fabrication technique. In this thesis, we employ corner lithography to enable batch fabrication of high resolution scanning Hall probes. The initial design consisted of a sub-&m Hall cross supported by four free <b>standing</b> <b>wires</b> in a pyramidal configuration, located {{at the end of}} an AFMtype cantilever. This implementation was mechanically and electrically too fragile to operate. Therefore the design was improved by supporting the wires with a robust silicon-nitride membrane. These robust probes allowed for scanning operation, but we discovered that the output signals suffered from large topographic crosstalk. We determined that this crosstalk was caused by the combination of cross asymmetry, resulting from fabrication imperfections, and topography induced probe-sample distance modulation, leading to temperature variation. To circumvent the crosstalk, we introduced an electronic compensation method to suppress the effect of temperature variation on the detected Hall signal. The method suppresses the temperature effect by at least a factor of ten, provided that the probe temperature varies uniformly over the entire structure. However, the method is not capable of compensating temperature changes within the probe structure itself, for instance caused by asymmetric probe cooling at step edges on the sample, or cantilever torsion. To increase the signal-to-noise ratio and improve the electrical robustness of the probes even more, we improved the probe design further by widening the leads to the Hall cross and increasing its dimensions. Using this final design, we successfully demonstrated imaging on a thermo-magnetically patterned magnetic sample with domains of 10 &m£ 10 &m, at a sensitivity of 4. 12 V/T...|$|R

The identification of the SQW was possible exploiting the large scattering contrast between GaAs and GaInAs at the (200) in-plane Bragg reflection. For HRXRD the nearly rectangular shaped wires directed along [110] give the main contribution to the intensity map in reciprocal space whereas the SQW itself is not visible.

40|$|Atomic size {{conductors}} are ideally at {{the limit}} of miniaturization, and a big effort is devoted {{to them in the}} fields of electronics and more recently molecular electronics. Quantum effects become important leading to a physical behaviour of atomic-size conductors fundamentally different from macroscopic ones. Inelastic effects can take place in these junctions. Hence, studies concerning the ballistic regime need be revisited. Indeed, inelastic effects in tunnelling junctions have been used to identify the vibrational spectra of impurities or objects in the junction. This is the case of the inelastic electron tunnelling spectroscopy (IETS) both in metal-insulator-metal junctions [1] and in STM junctions (STM-IETS) [2]. Recently, similar vibrational signatures in the high-conductance regime have been revealed [3].

40|$|Despite {{the ongoing}} {{progress}} in nanotechnology and its applications, {{the development of}} strategies for connecting nano scale systems to micro or macroscale elements is hampered {{by the lack of}} structural components that have both, nano and macroscale dimensions.

In this paper, we report on a technique for producing arrays of ordered, flexible and free <b>standing</b> polymer nano <b>wires</b> filled with different types of nano particles. The process utilizes the strong response of photosensitive polymer brushes to irradiation with UV interference patterns, resulting in a substantial mass redistribution of the polymer material along with local rupturing of polymer chains.

40|$|Ankara : Department of Physics and Institute of Engineering and Science, Bilkent Univ., 1997. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Bilkent University, 1997. Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 92 - 97. Modern semiconductor {{growth and}} processing techiques {{have provided the}} capability of fabricating a huge variety of devices which have atomically precise layered structures and lateral patterns with nanometer sizes. This not only provided novel device possibilités but also opened a new field in condensed matter physics, so called mesoscopics. It does not seem likely that the mesoscopic electronic devices {{will be available in}} the near future. Two main obstacles for mesoscopic electronics are the low temperature requirements and the breakdown of the phase coherence of the carriers as their energies exceed the Fermi level. This strongly suggests the investigation of the excited carriers with energies well in excess of their thermal equilibrium energy as the dimensions shrink. In this thesis, the interactions of hot electrons in semiconductor and metal structures with deep submicron characteristic dimensions have been studied. Tunneling Hot Electron Transfer Amplifier (THETA) constructed by abrupt semiconductur heterojunctions is a perfect system to analyze the interaction of hot electrons with cold electrons and the other possible excitations in solids. Recently, it has been discovered that an electron multiplication effect took place in such devices under certain conditions and resulted in a transfer ratio of greater than unity. In this work a novel fabrication technique has been developed. It would make it possible to utilize this effect for fabrication of a high frequency oscillator in the THz regime, in a future work. In addition, a kind of lateral THETA device has been constructed using a Two Dimensional Electron Gas structure. Electron multiplication effect for the first time has been observed in 2 DEG structures. Moreover, the dependence of the effect on parameters such as injection energy, emitter and collector barrier heights and electron transit length has been investigated. The other direction of the work has been the investigation of metal wires under extremely high current densities. A strong nonlinearity in conductivity is introduced when a free <b>standing</b> submicrometer <b>wire</b> is biased to heat upto very high temperatures.

30|$|The tower-like GaN {{nanowires}} in Figure  1 b {{are nearly}} vertical to the substrate. Similar vertically standing GaN nanowires grown with Au catalyst {{have also been}} fabricated under low pressure by Hou et al. [20]. As the reactor was kept at reduced pressure (approximately 52  Pa), radicals of Ga and N {{were expected to be}} partly bumped away and their quantity would be reduced significantly. The growth rate of the nanowires was then reduced greatly which would promote vertical alignment of the nanowires. Also, the microcrystal layers around the central wire were helpful for the <b>standing</b> of the <b>wires.</b> Under low pressure, Ga droplet which transported to the substrate was expected to be converted into GaN nanodots. The GaN nanodots acted as seed (or) nucleation for subsequent growth of GaN nanowires via VS mechanism with slow growth rate, which promoted vertical standing of the nanowires [21].Figure  1 c displays the GaN products grown for 40  min. It shows that the products have the tail-tapered morphology and their length is increased. In addition, some long nanowires can be observed. As growth time increases, more nanowires may grow out from Au islands surviving from the early growth. Furthermore, Ga vapor is transported to Si substrate continuously. A portion of Ga accumulates at Si substrate and forms islands which act as seed nucleation for the nanowire growth. These lead to an increase in density of the nanowires. In addition, non-vertical standing nanowires and the longer length of nanowires make their density look like to be increased. With growth duration increasing to 40  min at a rather high temperature (approximately 850 °C), Au nanoparticles at the tips disappear due to volatilization or desorption and then, {{it is hard to see}} nanoparticles at the tips of the nanowires in Figure  1 c.|$|R
40|$|The {{magnetic}} properties and interactions between transition metal (TM) impurities and clusters in low-dimensional metallic hosts are studied using a first principles theoretical method. In {{the first part}} of this work, the effect of magnetic order in 3 d- 5 d systems is addressed from the perspective of its influence on the enhancement of the magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE). In the second part, the possibility of using external electric fields (EFs) to control the {{magnetic properties}} and interactions between nanoparticles deposited at noble metal surfaces is investigated. The inﬂuence of 3 d composition and magnetic order on the spin polarization of the substrate and its consequences on the MAE are analyzed for the case of 3 d impurities in one- and two-dimensional polarizable hosts. It is shown that the MAE and easy- axis of monoatomic free <b>standing</b> 3 d-Pt <b>wires</b> is mainly determined by the atomic spin-orbit (SO) coupling contributions. The competition between ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AF) order in FePtn wires is studied in detail for n= 1 - 4 as a function of the relative position between Fe atoms. Our results show an oscillatory behavior of the magnetic polarization of Pt atoms as a function of their distance from the magnetic impurities, which can be correlated to a long-ranged magnetic coupling of the Fe atoms. Exceptionally large variations of the induced spin and orbital moments at the Pt atoms are found as a function of concentration and magnetic order. Along with a violation of the third Hund’s rule at the Fe sites, these variations result in a non trivial behavior of the MAE. In the case of TM impurities and dimers at the Cu(111), the effects of surface charging and applied EFs on the magnetic properties and substrate-mediated magnetic interactions have been investigated. The modifications of the surface electronic structure, impurity local moments and magnetic exchange coupling as a result of the EF-induced metallic screening and charge rearrangements are analysed. In a ﬁrst study, the properties of surface substitutional Co and Fe impurities are investigated as a function of the external charge per surface atom q. At large inter-impurity distances the effective magnetic exchange coupling ∆E between impurities shows RKKY-like oscillations as a function of the distance which are not signiﬁcantly affected by the considered values of q. For distances r < 10 Å, important modifications in the magnitude of ∆E, involving changes from FM to AF coupling, are found depending non-monotonously on the value and polarity of q. The interaction energies are analysed from a local perspective. In a second study, the interplay between external EF effects, internal magnetic order and substrate-mediated magnetic coupling has been investigated for Mn dimers on Cu(111). Our calculations show that EF (∼ 1 eV/Å) can induce a switching from AF to FM ground-state magnetic order within single Mn dimers. The relative coupling between a pair of dimers also shows RKKY-like oscillations as a function of the inter-dimer distance. Their effective magnetic exchange interaction is found to depend significantly on the magnetic order within the Mn dimers and on their relative orientation on the surface. The dependence of the substrate-mediated interaction on the magnetic state of the dimers is qualitatively explained in terms of the differences in the scattering of surface electrons. At short inter-dimer distances, the ground-state conﬁguration is determined by an interplay between exchange interactions and EF effects. These results demonstrate that external surface charging and applied EFs offer remarkable possibilities of manipulating the sign and strength of the magnetic coupling of surface supported nanoparticles...|$|R
