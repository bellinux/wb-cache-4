40|$|Two {{cases of}} {{potentially}} fatal cervical spine fractures {{in children who}} were inadequately restrained by malfunctioning car seat restraints are presented.

'Light {{clothing}} and an improved style of native house and more cleanly way of eating their food--not of cooking it, {{for they are}} cleanly already in that--may be adopted, and more easily perpetuated {{in their own homes}} than the <b>heavy</b> <b>clothing</b> necessary here, and the different style of houses and more English food.|$|R
60|$|Thus {{half an hour}} went by, and by that time, {{weighed down}} as he was by his <b>heavy</b> <b>clothing</b> and <b>heavy</b> footwear, Dick was well-nigh exhausted.

50|$|Walker was a {{supporter}} of the natural female form, often publicly rebuking other women for wearing makeup and <b>heavy</b> <b>clothing</b> that hid their form. Her models were never allowed to wear makeup, lipstick, or nail polish during sittings. She painted a series of works that reflected mythological themes, and several works depicting nude female models.|$|R

50|$|Expanding bullets {{are less}} likely to pass through the target, and if they do they will exit at a lower velocity. This reduces the risk of {{accidental}} shootings. For this reason, and to maximize the stopping effect, law enforcement organizations use expanding bullets. Even then some penetration is needed, e.g. to penetrate a windshield or <b>heavy</b> <b>clothing.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Dr. Bennett cut his wife's abdomen with {{a single}} sweep of his knife and {{extracted}} his infant daughter, Maria.

60|$|He did {{hope for}} a moment that it might be Avice, with a changed mind. But it was not she, nor anybody like her.

50|$|The rip {{currents}} {{along this}} section of coast are very unpredictable and can shift with little warning. They claim many lives {{despite the efforts of}} surf life-savers. Most of these drownings, however, occur after lifeguards are off duty or after rock fisherman wearing <b>heavy</b> <b>clothing</b> are washed off rocks, {{out of sight of the}} lifeguards. Lifeguards advise swimming between the red and yellow flags, during patrol hours.|$|R

60|$|The {{one thing}} to do now was to swim, and Earl struck out boldly for the shore, still thirty feet away. The weight of his <b>heavy</b> <b>clothing</b> was against him, and the current carried him on and on down the stream and toward a mass of jagged rocks fearful to behold.

50|$|To {{protect against}} injury, <b>heavy</b> <b>clothing,</b> a helmet {{with a full}} visor, and {{protective}} gloves are recommended for all spectators. Local residents modify motorcycle helmets by riveting fire retardant material to create an aventail at the back and a flexible gorget at the front. If this is not done a towel is advised to be worn around the neck because many can temporarily lose their hearing if a stray rocket goes inside their helmet.|$|R

In Black Powder Cartridge Rifle competition only period costumes are permitted.|$|R

40|$|International audienceRestrictions of preterm newborns' {{movements}} {{could have}} consequences ranging from stress enhancement to impairment of their motor development. Therefore, ability to freely express motor activities appears crucial for their behavioural and physiological development. Our {{aim was to}} evaluate behavioural issues of two types of clothing used in NICU. We observed 18 healthy 34 - 37 post-conception week-old preterm newborns, during resting periods, when they were undisturbed by any interventions. Newborns wore either light clothing (bodysuit and a light wrapping) or <b>heavy</b> <b>clothing</b> (pyjamas, cardigan and sleep-sack). The percentages of time each subject spent in different postures were compared between clothing situations. Arm and hand postures differed in relation to clothing: babies bent their arms more and held their hands nearer their heads when in bodysuits than when in sleepwear. Consequently, babies in bodysuits spent more time touching their body or their environment whereas the others generally were touching nothing. Self-touch is an important way to comfort one's self. <b>Heavy</b> <b>clothing</b> may impair self-soothing behaviours of preterm newborn babies that already lack other forms of contact. Results suggest that more attention should be paid to apparently routine and marginal decisions such as choice of clothes...|$|R

In this mass of white stood Bill Glutts and Gabe Werner, their <b>heavy</b> <b>clothing</b> covered with a ghost-like mantle. Behind them was a one-seated sleigh drawn by a horse that looked ready to drop from exhaustion.|$|R
