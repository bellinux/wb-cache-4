50|$|The Lilliput {{effect is}} a term coined in 1993, used to {{describe}} the dramatic reduction in size observed in populations of a taxa which have survived a major extinction event, attributable to a variety of environmental factors. This effect has been documented in numerous “survivor” taxa of such events. In his work, Adam K. Huttenlocker examined fossil records of Moschorhinus kitchingi from before and after the mass extinction demarcating the Permo-Triassic boundary. Specifically, he looked at changes in cranial size and limb bone histology indicating vascular growth patterns.Great size reductions are observed in Triassic Moschorhinus, as compared to their Permian forerunners. Histological evidence shows that Permian and Triassic Moschorhinus skeletons grew at different rates early in life, largely believed to be an effect of the harsher environmental variability of the early Triassic. This less stable environment favored a faster growth and development to reach a minimum body size requirement. Because of the Lilliput effects observed across the Permo-Triassic boundary, both size and <b>stratigraphic</b> <b>stage</b> must be considered when determining the maturity and age (in life) of a specimen.|$|E
40|$|There are diverse {{controversial}} and contradictory models about the geological {{history of the}} Caribbean region. Some {{issues such as the}} origin of the Caribbean plate, the nature of basement of the Caribbean basins and the regional tectonics, have been in discussion during decades. There are disperse and punctual studies across the Caribbean. Application of seismic stratigraphy in regional seismic lines across the Colombian, Sinú Offshore and Sinú-San Jacinto basins suggests a stratigraphic continuity between these regions. A chronostratigraphic chart of the Colombian and Sinú Offshore basins based on stratal terminations and seismic facies was proposed. Seven stratigraphic stages were identified in the Colombian, Sinú Offshore and Sinú-San Jacinto basins, which, also, have been recognized across the Caribbean region. First <b>stratigraphic</b> <b>stage</b> was characterized by continental to restricted marine deposition during a Triassic/Jurassic rifting. Second, third and fourth stages correspond with deposition of a wide carbonate platform in the Cretaceous, sandy carbonate platform during the Paleocene and carbonate and coarse-grained fluvial sedimentation during the Eocene, respectively. Another stage was characterized by rising of base level and deep-water deposition (turbidites and pelagic/hemipelagic sediments) during the Oligocene. The Early to Middle Miocene was characterized by shallow marine to fluvial sedimentation during falling base level, which was controlled by episodic events of tectonic inversion. During the Late Miocene to recent, the sedimentation consisted of terrigenous coarse-grained deposits. Stratigraphic relationships between these zones, suggest a shared geological history between the Caribbean and northern South America. The geologic continuity founded in this study is easily explained by the model of an in situ origin for the Caribbean plate...|$|E
40|$|Contemporary and Phanerozoic Patterns of Global Biodiversity is {{a global}} study testing {{theories}} explaining variation in taxic richness, and drawing parallels between contemporary- and paleodiversity. The unifying idea of the thesis {{is that most of}} the variation in contemporary and past richness depends on analogous factors: (1) sampling effects, (2) richness-energy relationships, and (3) geometric considerations pertaining to isolation and fragmentation. We present a predictive model of global island biogeography, uniting classic ideas of the Equilibrium Theory of Island Biogeography (ETIB) with the Species-Energy Theory (Chapter 1). We quantify insular isolation and propose an equation to measure the isolation reducing effects of neighboring islands. In Chapter 2 we extend our model to continental parcels of land. We show that area-climate interactions are strong both on continents and on islands. Notwithstanding, species-area slopes do not depend either on distance-based or on historical isolation, in apparent contradiction with some predictions of the ETIB. Thus, broad-scale patterns of diversity on islands and continents are commensurable. In Chapter 3 we evaluate the completeness of the global Phanerozoic record of continental (terrestrial and freshwater) metazoans, aiming to use these data in subsequent chapters. Results of this analysis suggest the relative completeness of the continental fossil record is not markedly inferior to that of the marine fossil record at the taxonomic level of the family and at the stratigraphic level of the stage. The exponential diversification curve of suprageneric continental taxa is unlikely to be the result of rock bias. Chapter 4 adopts a multivariate approach to model variation in fossil diversity. Our main finding is that turnovers of metazoan families are strongly correlated with the number of magnetic polarity reversal records per <b>stratigraphic</b> <b>stage</b> over the Phanerozoic. This suggests that either variation in fossil richness and reversal intensity are both strongly influenced by preservation bias, or that extinction and origination rates have a strong and quantifiable perturbation regime. In Chapter 5 we classify stratigraphic stages into alternating extinction and origination cycles to test for supercyclicity. Paleomagnetic and fossil data both support this hypothesis over the Lower Paleozoic, the Upper Paleozoic and the Mesozoic...|$|E

Here, to examine the dynamics of background ex-tinction, we analyzed the generic diversity trajectories of 19 Cenozoic terrestrial mammalian families with excellent fossil records.

40|$|Time-stratigraphic {{interpretations of}} Late Pliocene to Early Pleistocene sediments from onshore {{locations}} and from marginal marine settings of the North Sea Basin often {{refer to the}} subdivision of the Dutch and British ‘Quaternary’ regional <b>stratigraphic</b> <b>stages.</b> Since age control for these stages and their stage boundaries are based on relative dating methods, in this study pollen, dinoflagellate cysts and foraminiferal assemblages were investigated to correlate the regional <b>stratigraphic</b> <b>stages</b> independently to the global chronostratigraphy and the paleomagnetic timescale. The data were obtained from eight boreholes located in the depocentre setting of the Late Pliocene North Sea Basin comprising a 1000 m thick sedimentary succession. The British Gedgravian and Waltonian stages, the Dutch Reuverian to Brunssumian as well as published foraminiferal zones (NSB 14, FB and {{the lower part of}} the FA 2 zone) fall within the Zanclean and Piacenzian. The lower boundaries of the Pre-Ludhamian and Pretiglian stages and of the NSB 14 to 15 zones are close to the paleomagnetic Gauss-Matuyama boundary. The Pre-Ludhamian, Ludhamian, Thurnian and the Pretiglian, Tiglian A and Tiglian B stages presumably cover the marine isotope stages 103 to 95. It is proposed that the Ludhamian, Thurnian and the Tiglian A were short lasting, warm, periods during which sea level highstand facilitated sedimentary deposition at the marginal areas of the North Sea Basin. The lower boundary of the paleomagnetic Olduvai subchron is situated in the Tiglian C 1 - 4 b stage while the TC 4 c stage is found within the Olduvai subchron. Foraminiferal NSB 15 and NSB 16 zone as well as the upper part of the FA 2 and FA 1 zone fall within the Gelasian and cover the Matuyama chron as well as {{the lower part of the}} Olduvai subchron. Comparison with formerly dated North Sea sediments shows a good agreement between foraminiferal zonations on a broader scale but significant differences in absolute ages occur. Strontium isotope values indicate approximately 1 Ma younger ages as expected from our chronostratigraphic model. This discrepancy is explained by the dominance of freshwater from river discharge contributing high amounts of eroded material to the basin, leading to an increase of the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratio in the shelf-sea water...|$|R

40|$|During {{the period}} from {{approximately}} 150 to 35  million years ago, the Cretaceous–Paleocene–Eocene (CPE), the Earth was in a “greenhouse” state {{with little or no}} ice at either pole. It was also a period of considerable global change, from the warmest periods of the mid-Cretaceous, to the threshold of icehouse conditions {{at the end of the}} Eocene. However, the relative contribution of palaeogeographic change, solar change, and carbon cycle change to these climatic variations is unknown. Here, making use of recent advances in computing power, and a set of unique palaeogeographic maps, we carry out an ensemble of 19 General Circulation Model simulations covering this period, one simulation per <b>stratigraphic</b> <b>stage.</b> By maintaining atmospheric CO 2 concentration constant across the simulations, we are able to identify the contribution from palaeogeographic and solar forcing to global change across the CPE, and explore the underlying mechanisms. We find that global mean surface temperature is remarkably constant across the simulations, resulting from a cancellation of opposing trends from solar and palaeogeographic change. However, there are significant modelled variations on a regional scale. The stratigraphic stage–stage transitions which exhibit greatest climatic change are associated with transitions in the mode of ocean circulation, themselves often associated with changes in ocean gateways, and amplified by feedbacks related to emissivity and planetary albedo. We also find some control on global mean temperature from continental area and global mean orography. Our results have important implications for the interpretation of single-site palaeo proxy records. In particular, our results allow the non-CO 2 (i. e. palaeogeographic and solar constant) components of proxy records to be removed, leaving a more global component associated with carbon cycle change. This “adjustment factor” is used to adjust sea surface temperatures, as the deep ocean is not fully equilibrated in the model. The adjustment factor is illustrated for seven key sites in the CPE, and applied to proxy data from Falkland Plateau, and we provide data so that similar adjustments can be made to any site and for any time period within the CPE. Ultimately, this will enable isolation of the CO 2 -forced climate signal to be extracted from multiple proxy records from around the globe, allowing an evaluation of the regional signals and extent of polar amplification in response to CO 2 changes during the CPE. Finally, regions where the adjustment factor is constant throughout the CPE could indicate places where future proxies could be targeted in order to reconstruct the purest CO 2 -induced temperature change, where the complicating contributions of other processes are minimised. Therefore, combined with other considerations, this work could provide useful information for supporting targets for drilling localities and outcrop studies...|$|E

The interpretation of the regional Mediterranean stratigraphic sequence was debated.

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that extinction events have recurred periodically {{over the last}} quarter billion years is greatly strengthened by new data on the stratigraphic ranges of marine animal genera. In the interval from the Permian to Recent, these data encompass some 13, 000 generic extinctions, providing a more sensitive indicator of species-level extinctions than previously used familial data. Extinction time series computed from the generic data display nine strong peaks that are nearly uniformly spaced at 26 Ma intervals over the last 270 Ma. Most of these peaks correspond to extinction events recognized in more detailed, if limited, biostratigraphic studies. These new data weaken or negate most arguments against periodicity, which have involved criticisms of the taxonomic data base, sampling intervals, chronometric time scales, and statistical methods used in previous analyses. The criticisms are reviewed in some detail and various new calculations and simulations, including one assessing the effects of paraphyletic taxa, are presented. Although the new data strengthen the case for periodicity, they offer little new insight into the deriving mechanism behind the pattern. However, they do suggest {{that many of the}} periodic events may not have been catastrophic, occurring instead over several <b>stratigraphic</b> <b>stages</b> or substages...|$|R
40|$|Because many {{survivors}} of mass extinctions do {{not participate in}} postrecovery diversifications, and therefore fall into a pattern that can be termed “Dead Clade Walking” (DCW), the effects of mass extinctions extend beyond the losses observed during the event itself. Analyses at two taxonomic levels provide a first-order test of the prevalence of DCWs by using simple and very conservative operational criteria. For four of the Big Five mass extinctions of the Phanerozoic, the marine genera that survived the extinction suffered ≈ 10 – 20 % attrition in the immediately following geologic stage that was significantly greater than the losses sustained in preextinction stages. The stages immediately following the three Paleozoic mass extinctions also account for 17 % of all order-level losses in marine invertebrates over that interval, which is, again, significantly greater than that seen for the other <b>stratigraphic</b> <b>stages</b> (no orders are lost immediately after the end-Triassic or end-Cretaceous mass extinctions). DCWs are not evenly distributed among four regional molluscan time-series following the end-Cretaceous extinction, demonstrating the importance of spatial patterns in recovery dynamics. Although biotic interactions have been invoked to explain the differential postextinction success of clades, such hypotheses must be tested against alternatives that include stochastic processes in low-diversity lineages—which is evidently not a general explanation for the ordinal DCW patterns, because postextinction fates are not related to the size of extinction bottlenecks in Paleozoic orders—and ongoing physical environmental changes...|$|R
40|$|The {{result of}} seven years of {{research}} on Late Cretaceous Osteichthyan fishes from the northeastern Mexican states Coahuila and Nuevo León is presented here. The fossil record of the area yielded single species of Coelacanthiforms, Pycnodontiforms, Aspidorhynchids, Elopiforms, Crossognathids, Clupeiforms and Beryciforms. Additionally two tselfatiiform species and two aulopiform species were recognized. Furthermore three Pachyrhizodontids and four Ichthyodectiforms were described. Nine species were recognized {{for the first time}} in the area. Seven of them were hitherto unknown in the Western hemisphere. Four species were erected. The combined assemblage consisting of 18 taxa came from six localities and is distributed into four different <b>stratigraphic</b> <b>stages</b> ranging from the middle Cenomanian to the middle Santonian. A compilation of the “mid”-Cretaceous actinopterygian record of Mexico integrates 65 genera from ten localities, distributed within six time slices from the Albian to the Middle Santonian. A significant faunal turnover is evidenced by taxonomical changes during the Albian and Cenomanian, followed by an interval of taxonomic stability during the Latest Cenomanian up to the Santonian. This evolutionary pattern parallels a similar pattern of environmental factors such as sea surface temperature and sea level. During the Albian the Mexican fish assemblages are palaeobiogeographically related with western Gondwana localities, but these similarities decline during the Cenomanian. A Central and Eastern Tethyan influence on Mexican fish assemblages increases during this stage and culminates during the early Turonian in similar species on both sides of the early Proto-Atlantic and Tethys. The Coniacian and Santonian localities of Mexico share the majority of genera with the Western Interior Seaway forming a distinct actinopterygian “Southern Interior-Northern Gulfian” paleobiogeographical sub-province, which developed in the Turonian. These faunal changes coincide with an unchanging tectonic framework, which identifies oceanic dispersal as a driving mechanism for the changes of Mexican actinopterygian assemblages. Vicariance events in the Cenomanian were followed by regional extinction and subsequent strong westbound oceanic dispersal during the Early Turonian. Postulated dispersal routes coincide with ocean current models for this period of time. The composition of Mexican “Mid” Cretaceous actinopterygian assemblages was therefore affected by a mixture of dispersal, subsequent vicariance and extinction events, followed by faunal replacement probably due to subsequent dispersal. The velocity of faunal turnover is correlated to the frequency of environmental changes...|$|R

40|$|From the Oligocene onwards, {{the complex}} tectonic {{evolution}} of the Africa–Eurasia collision zone led to paleogeographic and biogeographic differentiation of the Mediterranean and Paratethys, two almost land-locked seas, in the area formerly occupied by the western Tethys Ocean. Episodic isolation of the basins triggered strong faunal endemism leading {{to the introduction of}} regional <b>stratigraphic</b> <b>stages</b> for the Paratethys. Chronostratigraphic control on the Paratethys stages remains rudimentary compared to the cyclostratigraphically constrained Mediterranean stages. This lack of chronostratigraphic control restricts the insight in the timing of geodynamic, climatic, and paleobiogeographic events and thereby hinders the identification of their causes and effects. In this paper, we here derive better age constraints on the Badenian, Sarmatian and Pannonian CentralParatethys regional stages through integrated 40 Ar/ 39 Ar, magnetostratigraphic, and biostratigraphic research in the TransylvanianBasin. The obtained results help to clarify the regions MiddleMiocene geodynamic and paleobiogeographic evolution. Six new 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages were determined for tuffs intercalating with the generally deep marine basin infill. Together with data from previous studies, there is now a total of 9 radio-isotopically dated horizons in the basin. These were traced along seismic lines into a synthetic seismic stratigraphic column in the basin center and serve as first order tie-points to the astronomically tuned Neogene timescale (ATNTS). Paleomagnetically investigated sections were treated similarly and their polarity in general corroborates the 40 Ar/ 39 Ar results. The integrated radio-isotopic and magnetostratigraphic results provide an improved high-resolution time-frame for the sedimentary infill of the TransylvanianBasin. Early Badenian deep water sedimentation is characterized by accumulation of the Dej Tuff Complex in response to a period of intensive volcanism, the onset of which is constrained between the first occurrence (FO) of Orbulina suturalis at 14. 56 Ma and 14. 38 ± 0. 06 Ma. During the subsequent Badenian Salinity Crisis (BSC) up to 300 m of salt accumulate in the basin center. The faunal turnover that marks the Badenian–Sarmatian Boundary is dated at 12. 80 ± 0. 05 Ma. A second phase of intense volcanism occurs at 12. 4 Ma and leads to deposition of the middle Sarmatian tuff complex (Ghiriş, Hădăreni, Turda and Câmpia Turzii tuffs). Rates of sediment accumulation strongly diminish in the basin center {{at the onset of the}} Pannonian stage coincident with an approximately 20 ° CW tectonic rotation of the Tisza–Daciaplate. Concurrent enhanced uplift in the Eastern a'nd Southern Carpathians leads to the isolation of the CentralParatethys and triggers the transition from marine to freshwater conditions. An additional Pannonian to post-Pannonian 6 ° of CW rotation is related to the creation of antiform geometries in the Eastern Carpathians which are notably larger in the north than in the south. An 8. 4 Ma age is determined for the uppermost Pannonian sediments preserved in the central part of the TransylvanianBasin. Two sections belonging to middle Pannonian Zone D, and the lower part of Zone E (Subzone E 1) are found to cover the 10. 6 – 9. 9 Ma time-interva...|$|R

This core 34 KL complements the heavily disturbed late Pliocene-Pleistocene core sections of DSDP Site 317, and is well suited for stratigraphic correlation. The sediments consist of calcareous microfossils (93 - 97 % CaCO 3), minor portions of siliceous microfossils and detrital minerals. All important calcareous microfossil zones could be identified and correlated with the magnetostratigraphic and isotope <b>stratigraphic</b> events, <b>stages</b> and periods. Due to {{the high degree of}} silica dissolution, the late Quaternary radiolarian Buccinosphaera invaginata Zone is the only siliceous fossil zone which could be identified. An interval with Globigerinoides gomitulus/pink was found within the middle Pleistocene which is clearly distinguished from the Globigerinoides ruber/pink interval of the late Pleistocene. The magnetostratigraphic Gauss-Matuyama and Matuyama-Brunhes boundaries as well as the Olduvai and Jaramillo events were clearly identified. The d 18 O curve displays the 100 kyr (Milankovitch) and the 41 kyr (Laplace) cyclicity periods. The beginning of the Laplace Period and the last occurrence of the calcareous nannofossil Discoaster brouweri, which marks the end of the Pliocene, fall within the base of the Olduvai Event. There is also a marked drop in sedimentation rates around this time, which seems to be a regional phenomenon. Prominent 3. 5 kHz subbottom reflectors at 8 ms and 15 ms reflection time are related to lithologic changes near the Mid-Pleistocene Revolution (MPR) {{and the beginning of the}} Laplace Period or the Pleistocene, respectively.

Distinct dark/light cycles from the uppermost 37 m of the record (i. e. the last 200, 000 years) were sampled in detail and analyzed for TOC content, C/N-ratios and hydrogen index values to characterize the organic material. A subdivision into three types of cycles was possible, representing different environmental conditions during formation of the dark/light rhythms. Additionally, the data were correlated with the global oxygen isotope curve and biogenic opal data to define the <b>stratigraphic</b> framework and <b>stage</b> boundaries. The results indicate that glacial intervals are generally dominated by a very distinctive cyclicity whereas interglacial sediments are more homogenous and cycles less pronounced. Glacial sea-level lowstands probably lead to a stratification of the water column and anoxic sedimentary conditions (and, thus, distinct dark/light cyclicity with an enrichment of marine organic carbon in the dark part) while the well-mixed Japan Sea of the interglacial periods barely reached oxygen-deficient levels although high productivity caused the enhanced oxygen demand due to the decay of marine organic material.

Based on their <b>stratigraphic</b> setting, three <b>stages</b> of potassic and ultrapotassic volcanism are distinguishable. Melilite-leucitite lavas are {{the products of the}} first stage and followed by lamproites that represent the second stage of volcanism. The leucitite block- and fragment-rich BalÝkhisar volcaniclastic succession overlies the products of the first and second stage volcanism. Lacustrine sedimentary rocks cover the products of first and second stage volcanism. Lacustrine sedimentary rocks are gradationally overlain by the Tokluk volcano-sedimentary succession. Phonotephritic lava domes, dykes, and flows represent the third stage of volcanic activity. Melilite leucitites from two occurrences in the Afyon volcanic province were studied. The melilite leucitites crop out as small lava domes and spatially limited lava flows. The melilite-leucitite lavas typically have porphyritic texture and are composed of leucite, nepheline, barium feldspar, melilite, diopside, melanite, calcite, apatite, and opaque minerals. Melilite crystals are relatively gehlenite- to akermanite-rich. The diopsidic clinopyroxene phenocrysts are partially and/or completely transformed to melilite aggregates. Geochemically, the SiO 2 content of the melilite leucitites varies from 44 % to 47 % and they are ultrapotassic with K 2 O contents of 9. 5 to 11. 8 % and average Na 2 O/K 2 O of about 2. The Al 2 O 3 and CaO contents are rathe...|$|R
40|$|Botrychiopsis {{has been}} {{considered}} an important floristic element of Westphalian/Artinskian associations of the Paraná Basin. The occurrence of Botrychiopsis in roof-shales of the Rio Bonito Formation in Southern Paraná Basin (Quitéria area), supported by the identification of Botrychiopsis valida, enlarges the genus biochron. Consequently, the stratigraphic hierarchy for Botrychiopsis plantiana and Botrychiopsis valida was defined for the Paraná Basin. Although it is climatically controlled and related to a deglaciation icehouse <b>stage,</b> <b>stratigraphic</b> distribution of the genus presents a substantial climate tolerance, from cold/cool to warm/temperate conditions. A new phytostratigraphic zonation is proposed for the southern portion of the basin that includes the Botrychiopsis Zone (Asselian/Kungurian), which is subdivided into the Botrychiopsis plantiana (Asselian/Artinskian) and Botrychiopsis valida (Late Artinskian/Kungurian) subzones. O gênero Botrychiopsis tem sido considerado um elemento florístico importante das associações do intervalo Westphaliano/Artinskiano da Bacia do Paraná. O registro de formas relacionadas ao gênero Botrychiopsis, especificamente Botrychiopsis valida, em roof-shales na área de Quitéria, Formação Rio Bonito, no sul da Bacia do Paraná amplia o biocron do gênero, definindo uma hierarquia estratigráfica para as espécies Botrychiopsis plantiana e Botrychiopsis valida para esta bacia. A distribuição estratigráfica do gênero está condicionada a controle climático relacionado a um ciclo de deglaciação em estágio icehouse, com espectro de tolerância climática abrangente, desde condições climáticas do tipo frio até temperado/ quente. É proposto um novo zoneamento fitoestratigráfico para essa porção da bacia, incluindo uma Zona Botrychiopsis (Asseliano/Kunguriano) com duas sub-zonas Botrychiopsis plantiana (Asseliano/Artinskiano) e Botrychiopsis valida (topo do Artinskiano/Kunguriano) ...|$|R
40|$|Lower Cretaceous {{ostracod}} associations (marine and nonmarine) {{have been}} studied from 34 sections of the Iberian chain or, geologically spoken, the Iberian basin (eastern Spain), in order {{to contribute to the}} chronostratigraphic correlation of the various predominantly nonmarine lithostratigraphic units in the Cameros, Maestrazgo, and South Iberian sub-basins (and the Central Iberian high in between). We have combined 87 ostracod species from 22 genera to 11 associations, each typical for certain <b>stratigraphic</b> levels (mostly <b>stages)</b> and ecologies. Nonmarine associations (dominated by the genera Cypridea and Theriosynoecum) prevailed from the Berriasian to the Barremian interval, whereas marine-brackish associations (much more diverse on the generic level) pre-vailed during the Aptian and Albian, {{and to a lesser extent}} during the Berriasian and Barremian. In most cases, our new ostracod data are consistent with previous correlative charts, as based upon other biostratigraphic data, mainly from charophytes, but also from few marine fossils in marine intercalations, and on depositional sequence stratigraphy. But in a few cases, our results are more or less different from those of established charts, namely in the eastern Cameros sub-basin (the Urbión group considered Late Berriasian in age instead of Valanginian-Barremian, and the Enciso group considered Late Valanginian-Barremian instead of Late Barremian-Aptian), in the northeastern Maestrazgo sub-basin (the Polacos Formation considered Late Berriasian-Early Hauterivian instead of Late Berriasian only), and in the uppermost part of the Lower Cretaceous in the South Iberian sub-basin (the Contreras and El Caroig Formations considered Albian instead of Aptian). Finally, we evaluate the usability of ostracod biostratigraphy in th...|$|R
40|$|Our aim {{has been}} to develop an {{integrated}} biostratigraphy and seismic stratigraphy for the Pliocene and Pleistocene formations (Ariki, Mangaa, Giant Foresets) in northern Taranaki Basin {{to better understand the}} evolution of the modern continental margin offshore central-western North Island, New Zealand. Detailed mapping of seismic reflectors in part of the basin, when compared with correlations of late Neogene stage boundaries between 11 well sections, has highlighted crossover between the datasets. To help resolve this issue, the biostratigraphy of the Pliocene-Pleistocene parts of each of four well sections (Arawa- 1, Ariki- 1, Kora- 1, and Wainui- 1) has been re-examined using a dense suite of samples. In addition, the biostratigraphy of seven other well sections (Awatea- 1, Kahawai- 1, Mangaa- 1, Taimana- 1, Tangaroa- 1, Te Kumi- 1, and Turi- 1) has been re-evaluated. The crossover is partly attributed to a combination of sampling resolution inherent in exploration well sections, the mixed nature of cuttings samples, and the general scarcity of age-diagnostic planktic foraminifera in the late Neogene formations. The achievement of seismic closure suggests that error in the mapping of the seismic reflectors is not a significant source of the uncertainty (crossover). We have developed a workable time-stratigraphic framework by qualitatively weighting the biostratigraphic data in each of the well sections, thereby identifying the parts of particular well sections with the highest resolution microfossil data and the optimal <b>stratigraphic</b> position of <b>stage</b> boundaries with respect to the mapped seismic horizons/seismic units. Hence, it is possible to assign the known numerical ages for these stage boundaries to reflection horizons/seismic units mapped within the basin. We have applied this information to produce a series of isopach maps for successive stage boundaries that help show the sedimentary evolution of the continental margin succession west of central North Island...|$|R
