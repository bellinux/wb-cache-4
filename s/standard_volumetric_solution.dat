40|$|Due to the {{specific}} character of problems {{in the field of}} ionizing radiation spectroscopy, the R&D and making process of <b>standard</b> <b>volumetric</b> activity metal samples (standard samples) for calibration and verification of spectrometric equipment is not only expensive, but also requires the use of highly qualified experts and a unique specific equipment. Theoretical and experimental studies performed have shown the possibility to use imitators as a set of alternating point sources of gamma radiation and metal plates and their use along with <b>standard</b> <b>volumetric</b> activity metal samples for calibration of scintillation-based detectors used in radiation control in metallurgy. Response functions or instrumental spectra of such spectrometer to radionuclides like 137 Cs, 134 Cs, 152 Eu, 154 Eu, 60 Co, 54 Mn, 232 Th, 226 Ra, 65 Zn, 125 Sb+ 125 m Te, 106 Ru+ 106 Rh, 94 Nb, 110 m Ag, 233 U, 234 U, 235 U and 238 U are required for calibration in a given measurement geometry. Standard samples {{in the form of a}} probe made of melt metal of a certain diameter and height are used in such measurements. However, the production of reference materials is costly and even problematic for such radionuclides as 94 Nb, 125 Sb+ 125 m Te, 234 U, 235 U  etc. A recognized solution to solve this problem is to use the Monte-Carlo simulation method. Instrumental experimental and theoretical spectra obtained by using standard samples and their imitators show a high compliance between experimental spectra of real samples and the theoretical ones of their Monte-Carlo models, between spectra of real samples and the ones of their imitators and finally, between experimental spectra of real sample imitators and the theoretical ones of their Monte-Carlo models.

The volumetric and temperature reactivity feedback coefficients are determined for the CRAC, KEWB- 5, SILENE, and SHEBA solution assemblies. Spectral temperature coefficients are also calculated for poisoned, unpoisoned, and reflected plutonium solutions.

Water weight was used instead of volumetrics for preparation of media. Media prepared by the volumetric and water weight methods were compared for (i) preparation time, (ii) pH, (iii) osmolarity and (iv) the percentage of two-cell murine embryos developing to blastocysts. The time required for preparation of media was significantly less for the water weight method. Following equilibration with 5 % CO 2, no differences were observed between the two methods for pH, osmolarity or development of embryos to the blastocyst stage.

A headspace volumetric Karl Fischer titration (HS-V-KFT) method is presented for the quantification of water content in different finished tobacco materials.

40|$|An {{important}} goal of statistical shape analysis is the discrimination between populations of objects, exploring {{group differences in}} morphology not explained by <b>standard</b> <b>volumetric</b> analysis. Certain applications additionally require analysis of objects in their embedding context by joint statistical analysis of sets of interrelated objects. In this paper, we present a framework for discriminant analysis of populations of 3 -D multi-object sets. In view of the driving medical applications, a skeletal object parametrization of shape is chosen since it naturally encodes thickening, bending and twisting. In a multi-object setting, we not only consider a joint analysis of sets of shapes but also {{must take into account}} differences in pose. Statistics on features of medial descriptions and pose parameters, which include rotational frames and distances, uses a Riemannian symmetric space instead of the standard Euclidean metric. Our choice of discriminant method is the distance weighted discriminant (DWD) because of its generalization ability in high dimensional, low sample size settings. Joint analysis of 10 subcortical brain structures in a pediatric autism study demonstrates that multi-object analysis of shape results in a better group discrimination than pose, and that the combination of pose and shape performs better than shape alone. Finally, given a discriminating axis of shape and pose, we can visualize the differences between the populations. 1...|$|R

We show that sensitivity encoding in two spatial dimensions (two-dimensional sensitivity encoding [2 D-SENSE]) can be used to reconstruct SMS acquisitions with periodic but otherwise arbitrary undersampling patterns. Theory and MethodsBy adopting a 3 D k-space representation of the SMS sampling process, the accelerated in-plane and slice-encoding directions form a 2 D-reconstruction problem that is equivalent to volumetric controlled aliasing in parallel imaging results in higher acceleration (CAIPIRINHA). 2 D-SENSE does not otherwise distinguish between <b>standard</b> <b>volumetric</b> and SMS imaging with arbitrary CAIPIRINHA sampling. ResultsUse of the SENSE algorithm is demonstrated for in vivo brain data obtained with blipped-CAIPRINHA sampling in 2 D SMS-echo planar imaging (EPI) and rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement (RARE) acquisitions as well as 3 D-EPI with various in-plane and through-plane acceleration factors and CAIPIRINHA shifts. The proposed SENSE reconstruction works for any combination of SMS-factor and CAIPIRINHA shift by the addition of dummy slices that allow for noninteger undersampling in the slice direction. Images with commonly used slice-generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisitions reconstruction are shown for reference. ConclusionSENSE is conceptually simple and provides a one-step reconstruction along both undersampled dimensions. It also provides a contrast-independent parallel imaging reconstruction for SMS.

We retrospectively reviewed the images of patients who underwent CCT or TBCT imaging in the management of renal cortical neoplasms. We used <b>standard</b> <b>volumetric</b> CT dose index (CTDIvol) and dose length product (DLP) to estimate radiation exposure. In addition, 2 urologists rated the quality of 20 CT images from each group using a survey with a 5 -point Likert scale.

40|$|Due to {{the wide}} use of {{increasingly}} larger tetrahedral meshes in volumetric visualization, simplification of tetrahedral meshes has {{become more and more}} popular in last two decades. In this thesis, we first introduce a basic tetrahedral mesh simplification algorithm based on cell collapse. Then, we present a new feature preserving simplification algorithm for tetrahedral meshes. The algorithm decimates the original dataset by iteratively removing tetrahedra without significantly altering boundary or interior field features. In a pre-processing step, we apply a level set method to find a segmentation of the volume dataset, and then label vertices on the region boundaries that potentially contribute to visually perceptible features in the rendered volume. The simplification algorithm preserves these labeled vertices as much as possible. Both incremental and greedy strategies are used to decimate tetrahedra that contain at most one labeled vertex. Field gradients, tetrahedral aspect ratio changes and variances of interior region values are further used so as to maintain features of the original dataset in regional interiors. A possible extension of combining edge collapse also presented to achieve higher decimation rates. We have implemented these algorithms and tested them using a number of <b>standard</b> <b>volumetric</b> datasets. The results have shown that the feature preserving simplification algorithm is able to preserve more features at the same decimation rates in comparison to other simplification algorithms...|$|R
