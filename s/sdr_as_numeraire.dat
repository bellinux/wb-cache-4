50|$|In finance, a T-forward {{measure is}} a pricing measure {{absolutely}} continuous {{with respect to}} a risk-neutral measure but rather than using the money market <b>as</b> <b>numeraire,</b> it uses a bond with maturity T. The use of the forward measure was pioneered by Farshid Jamshidian (1987), and later used as a means of calculating the price of options on bonds.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} default-free {{bond markets}} where the standard {{relationship between a}} possibly existing bank account process and the term structure of bond prices is broken, i. e. the bank account process is not a valid numéraire. We argue that this feature is not the exception but rather the rule in bond markets when starting with, e. g., terminal bonds <b>as</b> <b>numéraires.</b> Our setting are general càdlàg processes as bond prices, where we employ directly methods from large financial markets. Moreover, we do not restrict price process to be semimartingales, which allows for example to consider markets driven by fractional Brownian motion. In {{the core of the}} article we relate the appropriate no arbitrage assumptions (NAFL), i. e. no asymptotic free lunch, to the existence of an equivalent local martingale measure with respect to the terminal bond <b>as</b> <b>numéraire,</b> and no arbitrage opportunities of the first kind (NAA 1) to the existence of a supermartingale deflator, respectively. In all settings we obtain existence of a generalized bank account as a limit of convex combinations of roll-over bonds. Additionally we provide an alternative definition of the concept of a numéraire, leading to a possibly interesting connection to bubbles. If we can construct a bank account process through roll-overs, we can relate the impossibility of taking the bank account <b>as</b> <b>numéraire</b> to liquidity effects. Here we enter endogenously the arena of multiple yield curves. The theory is illustrated by several examples...|$|R

The same two-step procedure under (quantitative) uncertainty is suboptimal {{if one of the}} goods is used <b>as</b> <b>numéraire.</b> Optimality is restored however, if nominal prices are deflated by the exact price index.

Explicit pricing and hedging formulas of variance swaps are obtained under the benchmark approach, which only requires {{the existence of}} the numéraire portfolio.

This pricing concept provides minimal prices for variance swaps even when an equivalent risk neutral probability measure does not exist. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} the asset allocation strategies {{for members of}} defined-contribution pension plans with exponential utility when there are three types of asset, cash, bonds and stocks. The portfolio problem is to maximize the expected utility of terminal wealth that uses the plan member’s final wage <b>as</b> a <b>numeraire,</b> {{in the presence of}} three risk sources, interest risk, asset risk and wage risk. The use of a stochastic numeraire makes usual riskless cash assets risky. A closed form solution is found for the asset allocation problem when a portfolio replicates exactly the wage process exists, which is the true riskless asset. The optimal portfolio composition is horizon dependent, while the investments in the three asset classes have constant wealth-to-wage ratios. The paper discusses the implication of using wage <b>as</b> <b>numeraire</b> and assuming exponential utility function in portfolio and pension investment strategy studies...|$|R

40|$|In {{this short}} note we show how to setup a one {{dimensional}} single asset model, e. g. equity model, which calibrates {{to a full}} (two dimensional) implied volatility surface. We show that the efficient calibration procedure used in LIBOR Markov functional models may be applied here too. In a addition to the calibration to a full volatility surface the model allows the calibration of the joint asset-interest rate movement (i. e. local interest rates) and forward volatility. The latter allows the calibration of compound or Bermudan options. The Markov functional modeling approach consists of a Markovian driver process x and a mapping functional representing the asset states S(t) {{as a function of}} x(t). It was originally developed in the context of interest rate models, see [7]. Our approach however is similar to the setup of the hybrid Markov functional model in spot measure, as considered in [5]. For equity models it is common to use a deterministic Numéraire, e. g. the bank account with deterministic interest rates. In our approach we will choose the asset itself <b>as</b> <b>Numéraire.</b> This is a subtle, but crucial difference to other approaches considering Markov functional modeling. Choosing the asset itself <b>as</b> <b>Numéraire</b> will allow for a very efficient numerically calibratio...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper proposes an {{integrated}} approach to discrete time modelling in nance and insurance. This approach {{is based on}} the existence of a speci c benchmark portfolio, known as the growth optimal portfolio. When used <b>as</b> <b>numeraire,</b> this portfolio ensures that all benchmarked price processes are supermartingales. A fair price is characterized in terms of the type of maximum that the growth rate of the perturbed growth optimal portfolio attains. In general, arbitrage amounts arise due to the supermartingale property of benchmarked traded prices. No measure transformation is needed for the fair pricing of insurance policies and derivatives...|$|R

It considers security prices and portfolios with finite expected returns, where the growth optimal portfolio is taken <b>as</b> <b>numeraire</b> or benchmark. Benchmarked nonnegative wealth processes are {{shown to be}} supermartingales. Fair benchmarked values are conditional expectations of future benchmarked prices under the real world probability measure. Standard risk neutral and actuarial pricing formulas are obtained as special cases of fair pricing.
