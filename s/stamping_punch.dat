40|$|Abstract. Two basic {{types of}} load for the tool active {{elements}} {{can be distinguished}} for the shear cutting process of sheet metal. For high strength, brittle materials, the <b>stamping</b> <b>punch</b> will be exposed to distinctive oscillating axial dynamic loads {{as a result of}} abrupt released potential energy, from the tool active elements, the blanking tool and the stamping press, caused by a sudden cracking of the sheet. In contrast, when shear cutting ductile materials, sheet metal will be drawn into the die clearance and the resulting friction between the punch and the cut surface can cause high forces when pulling the punch out of the hole. When using punches featuring a complex cutting peripheral form,- not available as a standard part- it is necessary to decide between head and shank of the punch manufactured out of one part or a shaft without head, which is usually cheaper and can be manufactured by electro-erosive wire-cutting. In the second case, a linking element must be accepted, transferring the load transmission between shaft and tool. This linking element, realized by a form lock or traction, can be the reason for premature failure of the punch. The two described cases of load, in combination with lacking knowledge of the real load on the link as well as eligibility of different punch linking types for each case of loading, caus...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Ductile {{damage is}} a {{consequence}} of large strains more or less localized. Taking into account damage in constitutive behaviour of metallic materials is necessary to model various engineering problems involved in forming processes (<b>stamping,</b> <b>punching,</b> shearing [...] .). It would lead to accurate predictions introducing microstructural features of materials [1 - 2]. In the present study, two crystalline plasticity models including damage effects in the framework of scale transition methods are investigated. These models are developed and based on different approaches with direct application to duplex stainless steels. The first approach is a variant of the Berveiller-Zaoui model in which the effect of ductile damage has been introduced. The second one is a generalized Cailletaud model taking into account the ductile damage [3 - 6]. Because of the microstructural complexity of the chosen materials, some particular developments of the micromechanical approaches are considered. Moreover, continuous damage mechanics is used at grain scale including its effect (or coupling) on plastic or elastic-plastic flow with more or less complex hardenings. The modelling is justified on some previous experimental results in metallic duplex materials [7 - 8]. The developed models allow then deducing the macroscopic behaviour of the aggregate with damage effects from the grains behaviour...|$|R

40|$|To {{improve the}} {{lifetime}} of blanking tools, the application of high quality steel, heat treatment and coatings has become an interesting issue for many European companies dealing with <b>stamping,</b> <b>punching</b> and blanking operations. Important trends such as longer lifetime, higher accuracy and higher complexity of the products are challenging and require more special materials and techniques. The technological solutions to improve the existing processes are not obvious because of the enormous amount of possibilities in available materials, heat and surface treatments such as PVD coatings for the envisaged industrial processes and applications. An in-depth research to understand the manufacturing processes with the consequence of an increased performance and lifetime of the tools {{as well as the}} opportunity of further optimization was the main goal of this project. In many blanking processes where heavy duty conditions are applied, the use of hard metals, durable coatings and wear resistant tool steel is already established to extend the lifetime. The tools studied in this project were applied without coatings. The increasing production rate and the use of high strength steel sheet induce wear, crack formation and flaking of blanking tools with consequent low lifetimes. This project studied the tribological synergy of the substrate-heat treatment-surface preparation relationship and their influence on lifetime in heavy load conditions. A preliminary study was performed on the cutting edges of special designed triangular punches made of several high alloyed steels which were heat treated in a conventional way and by deep cryogenic treatment after quenching.

This project studied the tribological synergy of the substrate-heat treatment-surface relationship and their influence on life-time in heavy load conditions. The project shows some specials regarding the conventional tool making. Many influences in the mechanical treatment of different tool materials can support the live time or can lead to very bad cutting results, that means for example you have loose particles or bad polished and compacted surfaces. A preliminary study was performed on the cutting edges of special designed triangular punches made of several high alloyed steels which were heat treated in a conventional way and by deep cryogenic treatment after quenching. The influence of additional plasmanitriding treatments and coatings were investigated. After the research some demonstration tools were tested in industrial conditions to show the feasibility of certain selected combinations. From results of the preliminary study it can be concluded that all the selected steel substrates performed well during blanking operations. The best results were found with the Vanadis 4 e and 23 steel. A special coating could improve the adhesive wear of the reference steel 1. 2379. In case of the PM steels the use of a coating is optional. Furthermore DCT treatment could improve the flaking and wear behaviour in both the lab scale and industrial tests. The surface preparation after EDM is found to have an important positive influence on the wear especially when the surface is blast and polished. The industrial blanking tests confirm the positive contribution of DCT on several sheet materials...|$|R
