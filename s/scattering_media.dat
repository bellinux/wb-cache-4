40|$|Objective In {{this study}} {{open-source}} software (QSPECT) {{suitable for the}} iterative reconstruction of single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) data is presented. QSPECT implements maximum likelihood expectation maximization and ordered subsets expectation maximization algorithms in a user-friendly graphical interface. The software functionality is described and validation results are presented. Methods Maximum likelihood expectation maximization and ordered subsets expectation maximization algorithms are implemented in C++. The Qt toolkit, a standard C++ framework for developing high-performance cross-platform applications, {{has been used for}} the graphical user interface development. QSPECT is tested using original projection data from two clinical SPECT systems: (i) APEX SPX- 6 / 6 HR and (ii) Millennium MG. Phantom experiments were carried out to evaluate the quality of reconstructed images in terms of (i) spatial resolution, (ii) sensitivity to activity variations, and (iii) the presence of <b>scatter</b> <b>media.</b> A cardiac phantom was used to simulate a normal and abnormal scenario. Finally, clinical cardiac SPECT images were reconstructed. In all cases, QSPECT results were compared with the clinical systems reconstruction software that uses the standard filtered backprojection algorithm. Results The reconstructed images show that QSPECT, when compared with standard clinical reconstruction, provides images with higher contrast, reduced background, and better separation of small sources located in small distances. In addition, reconstruction with QSPECT provides more quantitative images, and reduces the background created by <b>scatter</b> <b>media.</b> Finally, the phantom and clinical cardiac images are reconstructed with similar quality. Conclusion QSPECT is a freely distributed, open-source standalone application that provides real-time, high-quality SPECT images. The software can be further modified to improve reconstruction algorithms, and include more correction techniques, such as, scatter and attenuation correction.

40|$|Background: The {{ability to}} measure glucose {{concentration}} through noninvasive approaches would impact {{the treatment of}} diabetes significantly. Polarization-based optical approaches have received considerable interest because of their potential medical applications. Glucose, a chiral molecule, {{has the ability to}} rotate the plane of linearly polarized light, commonly referred to as optical activity, as well as changing the refractive index of the media, which therefore affects the overall scattering coefficient in a given media. The magnitude of each effect is related to the concentration of glucose. Although most previous studies have reported on the use of polarimetry in the aqueous humor of the eye because of its nonscattering nature, one would also expect that glucose concentration could be measured in more turbid media such as tissue through a similar approach. This study investigated how each of these effects is correlated to glucose concentration in a physiological range for highly <b>scattering</b> biological <b>media.</b> Methods: A custom-designed imaging polarimeter was used to image highly <b>scattering</b> Intralipid-based <b>media</b> containing different concentrations of glucose.

50|$|Multi-spectral optoacoustic {{tomography}} (MSOT) is an imaging technology that generates high-resolution optical images in <b>scattering</b> <b>media,</b> including biological tissues. MSOT illuminates tissue with light of transient energy, typically light pulses lasting 1-100 nanoseconds. The tissue absorbs the light pulses, {{and as a}} result undergoes thermo-elastic expansion, a phenomenon known as the optoacoustic or photoacoustic effect. This expansion gives rise to ultrasound waves (photoechoes) that are detected and formed into an image. Image formation can be done by means of hardware (e.g. acoustic focusing or optical focusing) or computed tomography (mathematical image formation). Unlike other types of optoacoustic imaging, MSOT involves illuminating the sample with multiple wavelengths, allowing it to detect ultrasound waves emitted by different photoabsorbing molecules in the tissue, whether endogenous (oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin, melanin) or exogenous (imaging probes, nanoparticles). Computational techniques such as spectral unmixing deconvolute the ultrasound waves emitted by these different absorbers, allowing each emitter to be visualized separately in the target tissue. In this way, MSOT can allow visualization of hemoglobin concentration and tissue oxygenation or hypoxia. Unlike other optical imaging methods, MSOT is unaffected by photon scattering and thus can provide high-resolution optical images deep inside biological tissues.|$|E

In a series of experiments, his group demonstrated that these spectroscopic techniques have the potential to provide the diagnostic ability to distinguish between normal tissues and tumors, as well as between malignant and benign tumors. A major breakthrough was his use of near-ultraviolet and blue light for excitation of proteins and amino acids in tissues, and recognition of the ratio of peak fluorescence intensities emitted by biological tissues at two wavelengths (such as the 340 nm peak associated with tryptophan and the 440 nm peak associated with NADH as a parameter for identification of the tissue as normal or cancerous.

A new reactive optical theorem is also derived which clarifies the possibilities and limitations of the extraction of reactive energy storage information of an scatterer from scattering field data. Fundamental and practical imaging implications of the derived optical theorems are discussed.
