5|$|Microbiology {{was largely}} ignored by early {{evolutionary}} theory. This {{was due to}} the paucity of morphological traits and the lack of a species concept in microbiology, particularly amongst prokaryotes. Now, evolutionary researchers are taking advantage of their improved understanding of microbial physiology and ecology, produced by the comparative ease of microbial genomics, to explore the taxonomy and evolution of these organisms. These <b>studies</b> <b>are</b> revealing unanticipated levels of diversity amongst microbes.|$|E

Also, selenium interacts with other minerals, such as zinc and copper. High doses of Se supplements in pregnant animals might disturb the Zn:Cu ratio and lead to Zn reduction; in such treatment cases, Zn levels should be monitored.

5|$|Studies on {{embryogenesis}} {{and developmental}} biology. Mutants {{are created by}} adding transposons into their genomes, or specific genes are deleted by gene targeting. By studying the changes in development these changes produce, scientists aim to understand both how organisms normally develop, and what can go wrong in this process. These <b>studies</b> <b>are</b> particularly powerful since the basic controls of development, such as the homeobox genes, have similar functions in organisms as diverse as fruit flies and man.|$|E

The reduction in yield reported for Limousins is possibly a result of the loss of French Limousin content and of F94L myostatin mutations from the US purebred population, which would be an expected result of the purebred grading up process practiced there.
