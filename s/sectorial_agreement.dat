40|$|Despite {{overwhelming}} scientific {{consensus on}} the importance of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, it has proven very difficult to create a comprehensive international environmental agreement targeted at limiting these emissions. Sectorial agreements have been proposed as a means of bypassing many of the more difficult parts of negotiating an economy-wide agreement. Despite being a hot topic in the environmental debate, the subject of sectorial agreements is under-studied within the field of economics. My contribution to this topic will be a survey of the existing literature on international environmental and sectorial agreements, where I define six essential criteria that any successful environmental agreement should meet. I later apply these criteria to the maritime sector, where several propositions for a <b>sectorial</b> <b>agreement</b> are currently discussed within the International Maritime Organization (IMO). My main conclusions from this qualitative study of sectorial agreements are firstly that sectorial agreements can ensure that a higher percentage of emissions from the sector are included. There are several reasons for this. Asymmetry between countries is reduced when only looking at one sector, and they thus have more common ground. If fewer countries are large producers of the good in question, fewer participants are needed. Additionally, costs are more certain, eliminating uncertainty that could make countries less inclined to sign. Secondly, it is easier to impose credible threats when the scope is limited because gains from participation can be clearly stated. Trade restrictions can be imposed on goods from non-signatories. Thirdly, a tax is the more efficient instrument to reduce CO 2 in general because it is a stock pollutant, and in sectorial agreements in particular because price stability {{is more important than the}} yearly quantity of emissions. And lastly, in the case of the maritime sector, a combination of taxes and command-and-control instruments should be employed. A tax because it is the most efficient instrument. Command-and-control instruments because maritime sector is a carbon-intensive sector with high abatement costs and long-lived investments. If carbon-intensive ships are built now because the tax is lower than the marginal abatement cost, the sector will be “locked” to a more emission-heavy path, making abatement costs even higher in the future...|$|E

40|$|Quatre ans après la loi Auroux touchant la negociation collective, l'auteur apprecie ses effets pratiques et s'interroge sur ses pouvoirs et ses limites lorsqu'elle cherche à agir sur les {{relations}} collectives du travail. Four {{years after}} {{the adoption of the}} Auroux laws, the author evaluates the legislation's practical consequences in the areas of collective bargaining and time allocation. The 1982 law on collective bargaining was aimed at stimulating such activities at the industry and above all the firm level, particularly regarding salaries and work time. The law was adopted, though, before government wage and price controls had come to an end. On the salary question, it appears that the legislation did not stimulate collective bargaining on a sectorial level. These negotiations were complète and salary riders concluded, the established pattern set in — in conformity with government and management recommendations. Within the firm, where the legislation created an obligation for the employer to negotiate real salaries, an obvious development is noticeable. Firm-level negotiations, however, only made minor adjustments to <b>sectorial</b> <b>agreements.</b> As regards time allocation and time reduction, <b>sectorial</b> <b>agreements</b> determined the form and results of the hours of work. It is in the area of firm-level collective bargaining that new approaches appeared most clearly. Nevertheless, {{it should be noted that}} agreements were so firm specifie that is probable that they could have been reached without reference to the legislation. Thus, collective agreements have evolved since 1982 in a framework clearly defined by the objectives and the recommendations of the government. The legislation certainly contributed to the development of collective bargaining, particularly at the firm-level. It did not create a power of negociation sufficient to validate agreements aimed at upgrading salary conditions to levels acceptable to central government bodies, as far as unions were concerned. Underlying these remarks, of course, are the economic context and union crisis felt in France as elsewhere. Concerning negotiations on time allocation and time reduction, they revealed an offensive strategy by firms preoccupied with creating a more flexible organization as regards work time and production. The legislation proposed certain formulas accepted by firms, but it was not the legislation requiring negotiation which was at the root of what happened — it was the strategy of the firms themselves. Moreover, it is probably this very strategy which is the most significant factor in the development of French industrial relations, making it possible, for example, to profit from the requirements of the legislation — turning a restraint into an advantage...|$|R
40|$|Estimates {{show that}} fossil fuel {{subsidies}} average USD 400 – 600 billion annually worldwide while renewable energy (RE) subsidies amounted to USD 66 billion in 2010 and are predicted {{to rise to}} USD 250 billion annually by 2035. Domestic political rationales for energy subsidies include promoting innovation, job creation and economic growth, energy security, and independence. Energy subsidies may also serve social and environmental goals. Whether {{and to what extent}} subsidies are effective to achieve these goals or instead lead to market distortions is a matter of much debate and the trade effects of energy subsidies are complex. This paper offers an overview of the types of energy subsidies that are used in the conventional and renewable energy sectors, and their relationship with climate change, in particular greenhouse gas emissions. While the WTO’s Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (ASCM) is mostly concerned with harm to competitors, this paper considers {{the extent to which the}} Agreement could also discipline subsidies that cause harm to the environment as a global common. Beyond the existing legal framework, this paper surveys a number of alternatives for improving the ability of subsidies disciplines to internalize climate change costs of energy production and consumption. One option is a new multilateral agreement on subsidies or trade remedies (with an appropriate carve-out in the WTO regime to allow for it if such an agreement is concluded outside it). Alternatively, climate change-related subsidies could be included as part of another multilateral regime or as part of regional agreements. A third approach would be to incorporate rules on energy subsidies in <b>sectorial</b> <b>agreements,</b> including a Sustainable Energy Trade Agreement such as has been proposed in other ICTSD studies...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} provide the policymakers with a {{reliable}} scenario on public investment expenditure, we have developed a forecasting system for public infrastructure projects. The system, built as a combination of statistical models, yields a forecast of the spending distribution for a generic project, given past behaviour of similar projects, and can be applied both to on-going and new projects. In this paper we apply the forecasting system onto projects included in the <b>sectorial</b> Framework Programme <b>Agreements,</b> {{commonly referred to as}} APQs (Accordi di Programma Quadro), which represent the main instrument of planning national “additional ” resources committed to regional development policy. The analyses carried out on the forecasts highlight the positive impact of new regulation on the expenditure and the need for improvement of the spending plans laid out by the Administrations in charge of the projects...|$|R
40|$|This text {{constitutes}} {{an attempt to}} explain {{the complexity of the}} question of the decentralization of the industrial relations. At the beginning of the years 70 the branch became the prevalent level in most countries of the European Union, with the noticeble exception of the United Kingdom. Nevertheless, a certain diversity of the sectorial systems of collective relations of work constitutes a first illustration of the question. Moreover, during the recent time, the wages?increase is subjected to a national standard like with an European coordination. In addition, the multidimensionnality is observed in the choice of the topics negotiated between the interlocutors. This evolution seems to support the widening of the gap between the standards determined at the central level and the evolution of the effective terms of employment on the level of the companies. decentralization, industrial relations, <b>sectorial</b> level, social <b>agreements,</b> collective bargaining...|$|R
40|$|The {{continental}} {{integration of}} the US and Canadian automobile industries quickly followed the negotiation of a <b>sectorial</b> managed trade <b>agreement</b> [...] the Auto Pact [...] in 1965. Thus the recent Canada - US Free Trade Agreement (FTA) will likely have less short-term impact on restructuring {{in the auto industry}} than it will in most other industries. The paper begins with an analysis of the significant restructuring that occurred within the North American auto industry during the 1980 s in response to the globalization of production and dramatic changes in competitive conditions. The future prospects of the industry as it enters the 1990 s are examined with regard to three issues: the likely impact of the implementation of the automotive-industry provisions of the FTA; the consolidation of the significant auto-manufacturing presence in North America established by Japanese automakers during the 1980 s; and the fact that, with or without the negotiation of a North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), it appears likely that Mexico during the 1990 s will become fully integrated into a truly North American automotive industry. ...|$|R
