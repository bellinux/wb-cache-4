However, from 2003, a dual clutch six-speed Direct-Shift Gearbox (DSG) became available, with the United Kingdom TT variants becoming the world's first user of a dual clutch transmission configured for a right-hand drive vehicle, although the outright world first for a road car equipped with a dual clutch transmission was claimed earlier by a Volkswagen Group platform-mate, the left hand drive Volkswagen Golf Mk4 R32.|$|E
50|$|The {{optional}} {{motor drive}} for the F3, {{known as the}} MD-4, contained either 8 AA batteries or a special NiCd battery pack that would be recharged. Its performance surpassed that of past Nikon models, with a capability of 4 frames per second with uninterrupted reflex viewing, or 6 frame/s with the reflex mirror locked up. The integral <b>seamless</b> <b>design</b> of the MD-4 motor drive made it an extremely popular option for many F3 users. A bulk film back could be fitted {{in lieu of the}} normal back to the F3.

50|$|Although {{the basic}} design for boardshorts remains largely the same, some {{manufacturers}} {{have taken advantage}} of new technology. Because surfers and other water-sports enthusiasts commonly wear boardshorts without underwear, one of the major complaints has been about the use of velcro for the fly closure which tends to entangle pubic hair. A solution that some manufactures have come up with is to use a neoprene fly, which does not allow the fly to completely open, but provides enough stretch so that the shorts can be easily pulled on and off. Pubic hair does not get caught on the neoprene fly. To remedy another common complaint, about boardshorts stitching in the inseam area which would rub directly against the wearer's skin, many manufacturers switched to a <b>seamless</b> <b>design,</b> or use welding or glue, rather than stitches. Although it is very common for boardshorts to be worn without underwear, some male wearers prefer to wear compression shorts, boxers, a jockstrap or briefs under them. Some female surfers wear a swimsuit or bikini bottom under boardshorts.|$|E

40|$|Traditionally drug {{development}} is generally {{divided into three}} phases which have different aims and objectives. Recently so-called adaptive <b>seamless</b> <b>designs</b> that allow combination of the objectives of different development phases into a single trial have gained much interest. Adaptive trials combining treatment selection typical for Phase II and confirmation of efficacy as in Phase III {{are referred to as}} adaptive <b>seamless</b> Phase II/III <b>designs</b> and are considered in this paper. We compared four methods for adaptive treatment selection, namely the classical Dunnett test, an adaptive version of the Dunnett test based on the conditional error approach, the combination test approach, and an approach within the classical group-sequential framework. The latter two approaches have only recently been published. In a simulation study we found that no one method dominates the others in terms of power apart from the adaptive Dunnett test that dominates the classical Dunnett by construction. Furthermore, scenarios under which one approach outperforms others are described. ...|$|R

Methods:We develop an innovative adaptive trial design for SPMS, which builds on recent developments in statistical methodology. A literature search and individual clinical datasets were used to inform a framework to run simulations to evaluate the proposed design.

The context of our work is adaptive seamless Phase II/III trials and a systematic Limb-Leaf Design is developed. In {{a case of a}} nonmonotonic dose response curve where the desired level of effect exists in only a narrow dose range, a simulated comparison between a Limb-Leaf Design and a standard (Thall, Simon, and Ellenberg or TSE-type) adaptive <b>seamless</b> <b>design</b> shows a savings in risk adjusted expected sample size of up to 25 %. Chapter 1 is a review of concepts and particular adaptive seamless designs of interest.

40|$|There is {{a current}} trend towards {{clinical}} protocols which involve an initial “selection” phase {{followed by a}} hypothesis testing phase. The selection phase may involve a choice between competing treatments or different dose levels of a drug, between different target populations, between different endpoints, or between a superiority and a non-inferiority hypothesis. Clearly there can be benefits in elapsed time and economy in organizational effort if both phases can be designed up front as one experiment, with little downtime between phases. Adaptive designs have been proposed {{as a way to}} handle these selection/testing problems. They offer flexibility and allow final inferences to depend on data from both phases, while maintaining control of overall false positive rates.

40|$|The {{adaptive}} <b>seamless</b> phase II/III <b>design</b> {{combines the}} conventional separate phases II and III trials {{into a single}} trial, and it allows for adaptations (e. g. sample size reassessment and early stopping for futility or success) after the interim analysis. In this study, we propose a simulation-based method to determine the optimal sample size for the adaptive <b>seamless</b> phase II/III <b>design.</b> We assume that a power law relationship exists between the overall sample size and statistical power of the final test. The optimal sample size {{is defined as the}} minimum sample size that provides adequate power with overall type I error rate under control. To find the optimal size, we also take correlations between the early and the final outcomes into consideration. The methodology is applied to determining sample sizes in a study for a candidate treatment that can avoid renal damage during cardiac operations while the most effective dose of the treatment will be selected at the interim analysis. PUBLIC HEALTH SIGNIFICANCE Adaptive <b>seamless</b> phase II/III <b>design</b> eliminates the time between the traditional separate trials and better utilizes the data collected before the interim analysis, thus will result in faster clinical trials. Treatment effect can be confirmed at the final test if adequate power is achieved and the overall type I error rate is under control. Using these faster clinical trials, effective treatment can be approved sooner to benefit more patients. In addition, in an adaptive <b>seamless</b> phase II/III <b>design</b> more patients will be allocated to the more effective treatment than they would in conventional clinical trials...|$|R
