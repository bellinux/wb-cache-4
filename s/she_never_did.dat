5|$|In 1558, Elizabeth succeeded her {{half-sister}} to {{the throne}} {{and set out to}} rule by good counsel. She depended heavily on a group of trusted advisers, led by William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley. One of her first actions as queen was the establishment of an English Protestant church, of which she became the Supreme Governor. This Elizabethan Religious Settlement was to evolve into the Church of England. It was expected that Elizabeth would marry and produce an heir to continue the Tudor line. <b>She</b> <b>never</b> <b>did,</b> despite numerous courtships. As she grew older, Elizabeth became famous for her virginity. A cult grew around her which was celebrated in the portraits, pageants, and literature of the day.|$|E
5|$|After Picard is {{returned}} to the schoolroom, the lead Ferengi threatens to harm the children if Riker does not unlock the computer and teach his lieutenant how to operate the Enterprise. Riker pretends to instruct the Ferengi officer, but only spouts deliberately meaningless technobabble as he unlocks the computer console in Picard's schoolroom. With command functions enabled, Picard is able to activate a transporter safety function. With help from Worf's son, Alexander Rozhenko (Brian Bonsall), Guinan, and Ro, they use communication badges to trap most of the Ferengi on a transporter pad with their weapons disarmed and the exit blocked by a force field. Once {{most of them are}} detained, the children and Riker are able to overpower the remaining members and retake the Enterprise. After the events, the transporter is used to return Picard, Guinan, and Keiko to their adult states. Ro, buoyed by her experience, decides to remain a child for just a little while longer and draw some pictures, something <b>she</b> <b>never</b> <b>did</b> during her childhood.|$|E

Her lawyer told jurors <b>she</b> <b>never</b> <b>did</b> so, and performed medical duties only under Gosnell's orders.|$|E

25|$|Italian {{photographer}} Franko Vitale, {{best known}} for his collaborations with Fellini, came to Russia in the late 1980s {{and fell in love with}} Nina Shatskaya, then a Mosconcert singer. He proposed to her but she refused. Vitale made more than a thousand portraits of Shatskaya which later appeared in Italian magazines. This caused the widespread rumour that she worked as a model in Italy, which she's adamant that <b>she</b> <b>never</b> <b>did.</b> In the 1990s she was romantically involved with the composer Maksim Dunayevsky.|$|E
25|$|Back {{at work in}} Tokyo, Tsukuru and his {{colleague}} Sakamoto visit a stationmaster whose strange tale reminds him of Haida's story. After discussing his findings with Sara over dinner, Tsukuru decides he has to know {{the rest of the}} story. To do so he must visit the only other surviving member of the friendship group, Kuro, who now lives in Finland with two daughters. While preparing for the visit, Tsukuru goes to buy presents for Kuro's children and sees Sara hand in hand with a middle-aged man, smiling in a way <b>she</b> <b>never</b> <b>did</b> with Tsukuru.|$|E
25|$|In 16 BC, {{she married}} the Roman general and consul Nero Claudius Drusus. Drusus was the stepson of her uncle Augustus, second son of Livia Drusilla and brother of future Emperor Tiberius. They had several children, but only three survived: the famous general Germanicus, Livilla and the Roman Emperor Claudius. Antonia was the {{grandmother}} of the Emperor Caligula, the Empress Agrippina the Younger and through Agrippina, great-grandmother and great-aunt of the Emperor Nero. Drusus died in June 9 BC in Germany, due to complications from injuries he sustained after falling from a horse. After his death, although pressured by her uncle to remarry, <b>she</b> <b>never</b> <b>did.</b>|$|E

25|$|Hatton {{became very}} wealthy {{as a result}} of his {{progressing}} career and the Queen's fondness for him, so much so that in 1583 he embarked on the construction of a magnificent house in Holdenby, Northamptonshire. It was, at the time, the largest privately owned Elizabethan house in England. It contained 123 huge glass windows, in the days when glass was very expensive (indeed, a good show of wealth was how many windows you could afford in your house). It had two great courts and was as large as the palace of Hampton Court. It was three storeys high and had two large state rooms, one for himself and another for the queen should she ever come and stay, which <b>she</b> <b>never</b> <b>did.</b>|$|E
500|$|... "Ten Sessions" [...] {{was written}} by series co-creators Carter Bays and Craig Thomas, and {{directed}} by Pamela Fryman. In early March 2008, {{it was confirmed that}} singer Britney Spears would guest star on the show. Neil Patrick Harris was [...] "shocked" [...] that Spears was willing to [...] "come and do some acting", noting that she had not acted in a while. Spears's last acting role was on Will & Grace in 2006. Harris told Entertainment Tonight that the paparazzi would not be a problem, since the show is shot on the Fox secure lot. Before Sarah Chalke was given the role as Stella, Alicia Silverstone was originally set to guest star, but dropped out when her representatives feared she would be [...] "overshadowed" [...] by Spears. Co-creators Carter Bays and Craig Thomas [...] "love" [...] Silverstone and hoped she would eventually guest star on the show, although <b>she</b> <b>never</b> <b>did.</b>|$|E
500|$|Associated {{with the}} house is an inner garden of about [...] {{surrounded}} by a parkland of about both are enclosed by walls. [...] To {{the south of the}} hall the inner garden comprises a modern formal garden occupying the site of the original 16th-century formal garden. [...] Beyond this, in the parkland, are the earthworks of an earlier garden. [...] The parkland is almost square in shape, with a section curving out from the south border. [...] It consists of [...] "one huge grassed area" [...] with [...] "lumps and bumps". [...] The Cheshire historian George Ormerod, writing in 1819, considered that this area contained a tilting ground for jousting. [...] That claim is repeated in the hall's official guidebook, which goes on to suggest that it was created in the hope that Queen ElizabethI would visit the hall on her royal progress, but <b>she</b> <b>never</b> <b>did</b> so. [...] There is some doubt regarding the dating of the creation of the garden, but it is generally accepted that it comprised an Elizabethan pleasure garden. [...] A raised mound of earth in the southwest corner of the garden would have been used to view the garden from an elevated position. [...] A corresponding mound at the southeast corner was removed during the Second World War. [...] To the west of the hall a wooded area known as the Rookery contains mature lime trees. Limited excavation work carried out in 1989â€“90 discovered, inter alia, a filled-in canal running in a north-south axis down the centre of the garden. The excavations provided [...] "a tremendous insight into the past, although not enough to date it with certainty". [...] To the north of the hall are four fish ponds.|$|E

2500|$|The idea {{of killing}} Supergirl was first {{conceived}} by DC's vice president/executive editor Dick Giordano, who lobbied {{for the death}} to DC's publishers. He later said he has never had any regrets about this, explaining, [...] "Supergirl was created initially {{to take advantage of}} the high Superman sales and not much thought was put into her creation. She was created essentially as a female Superman. With time, writers and artists improved upon her execution, but <b>she</b> <b>never</b> <b>did</b> really add anything to the Superman mythosâ€”at least not for me." [...] The poor initial reception of the 1984 film Supergirl was also blamed by some sources.|$|E
2500|$|She castigated Justice Hunt for denying her a {{trial by}} jury, but stated {{that even if}} he had allowed the jury to discuss the case, she still would have been denied a trial by a jury of her peers because women were not allowed to be jurors. When Justice Hunt sentenced Anthony to pay a fine of $100, she responded, [...] "I shall never pay a dollar of your unjust penalty", and <b>she</b> <b>never</b> <b>did.</b> If Hunt had ordered her to be imprisoned until she paid the fine, Anthony could have appealed her case to the Supreme Court. Hunt instead {{announced}} he would not order her taken into custody, closing off that legal avenue.|$|E

2500|$|Welch {{posed for}} Playboy {{magazine}} in 1979, but <b>she</b> <b>never</b> <b>did</b> a full nudity photo shoot. Hugh Hefner and Gary Cole later wrote: [...] "Raquel Welch, {{one of the}} last of the classic sex symbols, came from the era when you could be considered the sexiest woman in the world without taking your clothes off. She declined to do complete nudity, and I yielded gracefully. The pictures prove her point." [...] Welch has refused to take all her clothes off on screen or pose naked throughout her career spanning five decades, saying it is the way she has been brought up. While her image in the 1960s was that of a torrid sex temptress, Raquel's private life was quite different. She once famously said: [...] "What I do on the screen is not to be equated with what I do in my private life. Privately, I am understated and dislike any hoopla".|$|E
2500|$|Diplomatic {{relations}} were also established with the Ottoman Empire with the chartering of the Levant Company and the dispatch {{of the first}} English ambassador to the Porte, William Harborne, in 1578. For the first time, a Treaty of Commerce was signed in 1580. Numerous envoys were dispatched in both directions and epistolar exchanges occurred between Elizabeth and Sultan Murad III. In one correspondence, Murad entertained the notion that Islam and Protestantism had [...] "much {{more in common than}} either did with Roman Catholicism, as both rejected the worship of idols", and argued for an alliance between England and the Ottoman Empire. To the dismay of Catholic Europe, England exported tin and lead (for cannon-casting) and ammunition to the Ottoman Empire, and Elizabeth seriously discussed joint military operations with Murad III during the outbreak of war with Spain in 1585, as Francis Walsingham was lobbying for a direct Ottoman military involvement against the common Spanish enemy. Although <b>she</b> <b>never</b> <b>did</b> receive any assistance from the Ottomans, her relations with the Sultan's did not waver.|$|E

It is very odd, but so it is; and I am quite sure that she knows best. Perhaps she wishes people to keep their fingers out of the fire, by having them burned.|$|R

2500|$|William A Irvin {{could carry}} up to 14,000 tons of iron ore {{in either the}} {{processed}} taconite form, or the raw iron ore straight from the mines. [...] About 90% of what she carried was taconite, although she did switch to coal and limestone for periods of time. [...] William A Irvin was equipped to carry grain, although <b>she</b> <b>never</b> <b>did</b> due to {{the problems associated with}} switching cargoes from taconite to grain. [...] All cargo was loaded and unloaded through the top of the ship, through the 18 hatches on deck. [...] All hatches were covered with large one-piece steel hatch covers, which weighed 5.5 tons per cover. [...] After all the covers were lifted off and placed aside using the hatch crane, the cargo could be dumped {{to the bottom of the}} three holds, which would normally take 3â€“4 hours to complete. [...] Unloading used Hulett cranes: cranes whose necks reach down to the bottom of the holds and grab 10-15 tons per bite, much like a large playground crane. [...] After all the cargo was either in or out of the holds, the hatch covers would be replaced and clamped down using the dog-ear or butterfly clamps. [...] Although the covers needed a crane to move them, they would need to be secured to ensure that they would not be dislodged by waves washing the decks during storms.|$|E
