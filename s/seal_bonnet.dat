50|$|Another type of bonnet {{construction}} in a gate valve is pressure <b>seal</b> <b>bonnet.</b> This construction is adopted for valves for high pressure service, typically {{in excess of}} 2250 psi (15 MPa). The unique feature of the pressure <b>seal</b> <b>bonnet</b> is that the bonnet ends in a downward-facing cup which fits inside {{the body of the}} valve. As the internal pressure in the valve increases, the sides of the cup are forced outward. improving the body-bonnet seal. Other constructions where the seal is provided by external clamping pressure tend to create leaks in the body-bonnet joint.|$|E

50|$|The bonnet {{provides}} a leakproof closure for the valve body. The threaded {{section of the}} stem goes through a hole with matching threads in the bonnet. Globe valves may have a screw-in, union, or bolted bonnet. Screw-in bonnet is the simplest bonnet, offering a durable, pressure-tight <b>seal.</b> Union <b>bonnet</b> is suitable for applications requiring frequent inspection or cleaning. It also gives the body added strength. A bonnet attached with bolts is used for larger or higher pressure applications. The bonnet also contains the packing, a wearable material that maintains the <b>seal</b> between the <b>bonnet</b> and the stem during valve cycling.|$|R
