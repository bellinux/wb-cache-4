40|$|The present work {{collects}} {{the results}} of research conducted on thermo-fluid dynamics and aero-acoustic noise sources, especially on the characteristic noise of the condensing boilers combustion and centrifugal fans noise. The confined combustion cause instability phenomena which produce pressure fluctuations inside the combustion chamber, resulting in generation of noise. The instability phenomena of condensing boilers can be divided in two main types: {{the first one is}} called "Rumbling," where an interaction among flame, acoustic field and system fluid dynamics occurs; the second one is called "Hooting", which is a thermo-kinetic instability. On {{the first part of this}} paper is shown the experimental and numerical analysis of the "Hooting" in order to find: causes, characteristics, and a methodology that allows the prediction of this phenomenon. For this purpose has been made a simplified prototype of a condensing boiler to study: the main acoustic characteristics of the instability phenomenon, the fluid dynamic parameters which affect its generation and find a simple geometry to perform 3 D simulation analysis. In order to evaluate the influence on the emitted spectrum of combustion chamber geometry, it has been performed an acoustic modes FEM analysis of the combustion chamber prototyped cavity. To study the reproducibility and therefore the prediction of the “Hooting” <b>spectra</b> sound <b>pressure</b> <b>level</b> a hybrid CFD/CAA model has been performed. The above numerical model combining a thermo-fluid dynamics simulation of combustion chemical reaction, with a frequency domain acoustic simulation considering the Lighthill’s acoustic analogy extension proposed by Curle. Beyond to this numerical method, CFD transient simulations have been performed to calculate the <b>spectra</b> of sound <b>pressure</b> <b>levels</b> of combustion chamber, analyzing the obtained pressure fluctuation. The last part of this work described two numerical methodologies to predict the noise level emitted from centrifugal fan outlet. The first one requires the combination of a transient CFD simulation with a CAA acoustic simulation using two different acoustic analogies. The Ffowcs Williams-Hawkins analogy estimates the emitted sound <b>pressure</b> <b>level</b> with the definition of a dipoles distribution placed on fixed and mobile hard surfaces present in a fluid domain. This numerical method enables to calculate centrifugal fans blade passing frequency noise and broadband noise as well. The Lowson theory defines an equivalent single sound source considering the pressure distribution on blades and rotation speed of the impeller. This numerical method enables to calculate only the noise contribution of blade passing frequency and its harmonics. The second numerical method considered enable to calculate the sound <b>pressure</b> <b>level</b> <b>spectra</b> directly from relative pressure fluctuations from CFD transient simulations. The simulation results have been compared with the experimental measurements performed on a test rig carried out according to UNI EN ISO 5136...|$|R

The purpose of this work is to investigate the aerodynamics and the acoustic noise generated by a single stream jet flow operating at low Mach number 0. 25 and Reynolds number of 2, 1 105. The main focus is the flow and acoustics characterization of this low speed jet by appling different experimental techniques for evaluating the velocity field via measurements with pitot tube and hot-wire anemometry and farfield noise acquisition by free field microphones. In order to verify the validity of aeroacoustics prediction for such low speed jet, a Computational Fluid Dynamics by means of RANS simulations via k- SST model have been employed coupled with a statistically low-cost Lighthill-Ray-Tracing method in order to numerically predict the acoustic noise <b>spectrum.</b> Sound <b>pressure</b> <b>level</b> {{as a function of}} frequency is contructed from the experiments and compared with the noise calculations from the acoustic modeling.

Field data {{used in the study}} were obtained from vertical stacks of bi-directional current meters and a pressure sensor mounted on a rigid frame at 3 locations along a cross-shore transect in depths of 2, 4, and 8 m. Observed <b>pressure</b> and velocity <b>spectra</b> are compared to transfer functions based on linear finite depth theory and a simple nonlinear model that accounts for harmonic generation in shallow water. At high frequencies, the observed vertical aftenuation of horizontal velocity spectra in 8 and 4 m depth is much weaker than predicted by linear theory and generally in good agreement with the nonlinear model predictions. In 2 m depth, differences between the linear and nonlinear transfer function are small and both predictions are in reasonable agreement with the observed weak vertical decay. At infragravity frequencies in shallow water depths, observed velocity spectra often show significant vertical decay that is not predicted by either model.
