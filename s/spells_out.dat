25|$|In the 1958–59 Scottish League Cup group stage Hearts {{eliminated}} Rangers. That October 1958 Scottish League Cup Final was {{won with}} a heavy 5–1 defeat of Partick Thistle. Bauld and Murray each scored two and Johnny Hamilton netted one. Hearts defended their league title by being leaders in mid December. However a side visiting Ibrox missing injured Mackay were beaten 5–0 with all goals in the first 35 minutes. This put Rangers into top position in the table on goal average. This precipitated a poor run of only two wins from the next seven games without injured Mackay. Hearts beat Queen of the South in a 2–1 home league win on 7 March 1959. After that QoS game Rangers with six games to play were firm favourites for the title, six points ahead of second placed Hearts. Even if Hearts were to win their remaining seven games including a game in hand and beating Rangers in their visit Tynecastle in Rangers' penultimate game of the season, Rangers {{would still have to}} drop two points elsewhere and give away a superior goal average. The league game against QoS was Mackay's last for Hearts after they accepted a bid of £32,000 from Tottenham Hotspur for their captain who was fit at this time despite having had lengthy <b>spells</b> <b>out</b> injured in the previous 12 months. Bobby Rankin was brought in to bolster the squad and scored twice in each of his first two games (both victories). On the penultimate Saturday of the league campaign goals by Cumming and Rankin at home to Rangers meant Hearts were four points behind with a game in hand. In midweek they next won 4–2 at Aberdeen with Rankin scoring a hat-trick. The last day of the season began with Rangers two points clear with an identical goal average to Hearts. Rangers thus needed a point to clinch the title but lost 2–1 at home to Aberdeen. Despite missing Bobby Kirk at right back with a knee injury, Rankin's ninth goal from his fifth Hearts game had Hearts 1–0 up at half time at Celtic Park. Any victory would have given Hearts the title. Then Celtic's Bertie Auld playing at left wing equalised before Eric Smith scored Celtic's winning second goal to seal the title for their cross city rivals leaving those at the Tynecastle to wonder {{what would have happened if}} Mackay hadn't been sold when he was.|$|E

500|$|As {{stated in}} the preface, there is a code hidden in the {{illustrations}} throughout the book. This {{was the idea of}} Brett Helquist and Ballet's editor, Tracy Mack. The code involves images of pentominoes and frogs, which are recurring themes throughout the book. To understand the code, one must count the number of frogs in every other illustration and find the hidden pentomino. The pentominoes and the quantity of frogs in the illustrations correspond to letter-number combinations in the code that Calder and Tommy use to write their letters throughout the book. For example, the first code sequence included in an illustration is represented by a hidden pentomino corresponding to the letter V, and two frogs. This means that the code sequence is V:2, referring to the letter T in Calder and Tommy's decoding key. When the entire message hidden in the book is decoded, it <b>spells</b> <b>out</b> [...] "The Lady Lives".|$|E
