25|$|A common problem, {{called the}} {{subgraph}} isomorphism problem, {{is finding a}} fixed graph as a subgraph in a given graph. One reason {{to be interested in}} <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> is that many graph properties are hereditary for subgraphs, which means that a graph has the property if and only if all subgraphs have it too.|$|E
25|$|The {{constitutional}} principle {{is that a}} member of the Court Constitutional Court cannot be dismissed. Decisions to dismiss a Court members must be taken by the person or body (i.e. the President of the Republic or the National Assembly; in the latter case, by a majority vote {{of the total number of}} Deputies) having appointed the member in question. Where <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> has been raised, the Constitutional Court must consider the case in the member’s absence, and must issue a conclusion- on the termination of the member’s office by a majority of at least two thirds of the Court membership (i.e. 6 out of 9). Once the conclusion has been issued, the actual decision on the Constitutional Court member’s dismissal must be taken by the authority having appointed him or her (although in fact no member of the Constitutional Court has ever been dismissed since its inauguration). The independence of the members of the Constitutional Court is guaranteed by their submission to the Constitution and the Law on the Constitutional Court. It is prohibited to influence {{a member of the}} Constitutional Court, and anyone attempting to do so is liable to prosecution.|$|E
500|$|From 2011 to 2014, certain {{weeks of}} the show were {{designated}} as [...] "Double Your Money" [...] weeks. In those, a pre-selected question in round one was designated the [...] "Double Money Question." [...] When a contestant answered <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> correctly, the monetary value behind the question was doubled and added {{to his or her}} bank, giving him or her the possibility of adding up to $50,000 to his or her bank on a single question; under these special rules, it was possible for a contestant to finish round one with a maximum total of $93,600 in their bank. However, when a contestant [...] "jumped" [...] the question, they forfeited the doubled money.|$|E

500|$|With {{a newborn}} involved, the {{decision}} is made more complex due {{to the principles of}} respect for autonomy and consent, as a newborn cannot understand or engage in a logical discussion of his own values and best interests. [...] A mentally more mature child can understand the issues involved to some degree, and the physician and parents may elicit input from the child and weigh it appropriately in the decision-making process, although the law may not treat such input as legally informative. Ethicists and legal theorists also state that it is questionable for parents to make a decision for the child that precludes the child from making a different decision for himself later. <b>Such</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> can be raised for the decision by the parents either to circumcise or not to circumcise the child.|$|E
500|$|Margaret Eagar {{also noted}} that Olga was bright but said she had little {{experience}} with the world because of her sheltered life. She and her sisters had little understanding of money because they had not {{had an opportunity to}} shop in stores or to see money exchange hands. Young Olga once thought that a hat maker who came to the palace had given her a new hat as a present. Olga was once frightened when she witnessed a policeman arresting someone on the street. She thought the policeman would come to arrest her because she had behaved badly for Miss Eagar. When reading a history lesson, she remarked that she was glad she lived in current times, when people were good and not as evil as they had been in the past. When she was eight, in November 1903, Olga learned about death first hand when her first cousin, Princess Elisabeth of Hesse and by Rhine, died of typhoid fever while on a visit to the Romanovs at their Polish estate. [...] "My children talked much of cousin Ella and how God had taken her spirit, and they understood that later God would take her body also to heaven", wrote Eagar. [...] "On Christmas morning when Olga awoke, she exclaimed at once, 'Did God send for cousin Ella's body in the night?' I felt startled at <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> on Christmas morning, but answered, 'Oh, no, dear, not yet.' She was greatly disappointed, and said, 'I thought He would have sent for her to keep Christmas with Him.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Turning to the {{particulars}} of Ham's case, the Court noted that voir dire, although subject to the Fourteenth Amendment, is governed by {{the discretion of the}} trial court. [...] As such, the trial judge was not required to put the question of racial bias in any particular form or to ask potential jurors any number of questions. [...] For example, the Court addressed the jury instruction concerning beards and determined that <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> was well within the trial court's discretion to allow or disallow. [...] However, given the context of the case, the Court found that the questions regarding racial prejudice were appropriate and necessary.|$|E
2500|$|... "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" [...] (1950) was {{the first}} {{published}} paper by Turing to focus exclusively on machine intelligence. Turing begins the 1950 paper with the claim, [...] "I propose to consider the question 'Can machines think? As he highlights, the traditional approach to <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> is to start with definitions, defining both the terms [...] "machine" [...] and [...] "intelligence". Turing chooses not to do so; instead he replaces the question with a new one, [...] "which {{is closely related to}} it and is expressed in relatively unambiguous words." [...] In essence he proposes to change the question from [...] "Can machines think?" [...] to [...] "Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?" [...] The advantage of the new question, Turing argues, is that it draws [...] "a fairly sharp line between the physical and intellectual capacities of a man." ...|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with syndicated columnist Billy Evans after the 1924 season, Blott asked the question: “Is it worth while for a college player to consider the professional game?” [...] Blott frankly noted, “I’m {{not so sure that}} I am to be a star.” [...] Evans wrote that there were many “ifs” to <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>question,</b> including love of the game and other business prospects. [...] However, Evans noted that Blott was left with a decision as to whether to return to the Reds in 1925, realizing he would likely be “sitting on the bench as a substitute possessing just enough ability to fill in when one of the regulars was out of the lineup.” [...] Evans opined that it was a “waste of time” for a collegian to play such a role. [...] Evans later revealed that Blott had confided in him that he liked football best and would prefer to coach a grid team than play baseball.|$|E
2500|$|Paul's {{announcement}} {{that he is}} not [...] "ashamed" [...] (epaiscúnomai) of his gospel because it holds power (dúnamis). These two verses form a backdrop {{for the rest of the}} book. First, we note that Paul is unashamed of his love for this gospel that he preaches about Jesus Christ. He also notes that he is speaking to the [...] "Jew first." [...] There is significance to this, but much of it is scholarly conjecture as the relationship of Paul the Apostle and Judaism is still debated. We are hard-pressed to find an answer to <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> without knowing more about the audience in question. Wayne Brindle argues, based on Paul's former writings against the Judaizers in Galatians and 2Corinthians, that rumors had probably spread about Paul totally negating the Jewish existence in a Christian world (see also Antinomianism in the New Testament and Supersessionism). Paul may have used the [...] "Jew first" [...] approach to counter such a view.|$|E
2500|$|FitzRoy and Darwin got on well together, {{but there}} were {{inevitable}} strains during the five-year survey voyage. The captain had a violent temper, his outbursts had gained him the nickname [...] "Hot Coffee", which resulted in quarrels sometimes [...] "bordering on insanity", as Darwin later recalled. On a memorable occasion in March 1832 at Bahia, Brazil, Darwin was horrified at tales of the treatment of slaves. FitzRoy, while not endorsing brutality, recounted how an estancia owner once asked his slaves if they wished to be free and was told they did not. Darwin asked FitzRoy if he thought slaves could answer <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> honestly when it was posed by their master, at which the captain lost his temper and, before storming out, told Darwin that if he doubted his word {{they could no longer}} live together; effectively he banished Darwin from his table. Before nightfall FitzRoy's temper cooled and he sent an apology, with the request that Darwin [...] "continue to live with him." [...] They avoided the subject of slavery from that time on. None of their quarrels were over religious or doctrinal issues; such disagreements came after the voyage.|$|E
