5000|$|Pull-ups use the teres major, a small muscle at {{the back}} of the <b>shoulder</b> <b>blade.</b> The nearby rhomboids, which connect the spine to the <b>shoulder</b> <b>blade,</b> play a part too. Pull-ups also use the {{trapezius}} along the spine and shoulder, and the levator scapulae along the side of the neck.

50|$|In neolithic {{times and}} earlier a large animal's scapula (<b>shoulder</b> <b>blade)</b> was {{often used as}} a crude shovel or spade.

25|$|The Roman {{physician}} Caelius Aurelianus (5th century) used pala {{to refer}} to the <b>shoulder</b> <b>blade.</b> The name pala is normally used {{to refer to}} a spade in Latin and was therefore probably used by Caelius Aurelianus to describe the <b>shoulder</b> <b>blade,</b> as both exhibit a flat curvature.|$|R
2500|$|After the Middle Ages, {{the name}} scapula for <b>shoulder</b> <b>blade</b> became dominant. The word scapula can {{etymologically}} {{be explained by}} its relatedness to ancient Greek verb σκάπτειν, to dig. This relatedness give rise to several possible explanations. First, the noun σκάπετος, trench [...] derived from this verb, and the to scapula related noun σκαφη, similarly derived from the aforementioned verb, might connect scapula {{to the notion of}} (con)cavity. The name scapula might be related that due to existence of the spine of the scapula a concavity exist in the scapula. Otherwise, the designation scapulae is also seen as synonym of ancient Greek συνωμία, the space between the <b>shoulder</b> <b>blades,</b> that is obviously concave. Συνωμία consists of σύν, together with, and ὦμος, shoulder. Second, scapula, due to its relatedness to σκάπτειν might originally meant shovel. Similarly to the resemblance between the Latin pala (spade) and the <b>shoulder</b> <b>blade,</b> a resemblance might be felt between the shape of a shovel and the <b>shoulder</b> <b>blade.</b> Alternatively, the <b>shoulder</b> <b>blade</b> might be used originally for digging and shoveling.|$|R
