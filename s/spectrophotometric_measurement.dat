50|$|In 1939, the system’s {{approach}} {{was published in}} the Journal of Research of the National Bureau of Standards, and the ISCC formally approved the system, which consisted of a set of blocks within the color space defined by the Munsell color system as embodied by the Munsell Book of Color. Over the following decades the ISCC-NBS system’s boundaries were tweaked and its relation to various other color standards were defined, including for instance those for plastics, building materials, botany, paint, and soil. After the definition of the Munsell system was slightly altered by its 1943 renotations, the ISCC-NBS system was redefined in the 1950s in relation to the new Munsell coordinates. In 1955, the NBS published The Color Names Dictionary, which cross-referenced terms from several other color systems and dictionaries, relating them to the ISCC-NBS system and thereby to each other. In 1965, the NBS published Centroid Color Charts made up of color samples demonstrating the central color in each category, as a physical representation of the system usable by the public, and also published The Universal Color Language, a more general system for color designation with various degrees of precision from completely generic (13 broad categories) to extremely precise (numeric values from <b>spectrophotometric</b> <b>measurement).</b> In 1976, The Color Names Dictionary and The Universal Color Language were combined and updated with the publication of Color: Universal Language and Dictionary of Names, the definitive source on the ISCC-NBS system.|$|E
50|$|The cuvette {{calibration}} has a {{great effect}} on the absorbance measurement. Many variables {{need to be considered}} to ensure precision and accuracy. The <b>spectrophotometric</b> <b>measurement</b> is sensitive to the change in volume. The calibration cuvette helps scientists to convert the volume data from relative value units to the true volume with the less uncertainty. The cuvette adjustment is important for laboratory technicians who acquiring a precise estimation of the volume of solution. In the laboratory facility, sometimes a round glass cuvette is frequently utilized. The adjusted cuvette that has been aligned and sold in the market is expensive in comparison with the cost of normal glass tubes. The glass cell costs approximately 30 times more than an ordinary glass tube. In turn, the cuvettes do the most appropriate sort of spectrophotometer, but in the some researches need the great number of cuvette and can be costly. A high quality glass tube as calibrated can give similar result as a cuvette. However, the manually calibrated cuvette has less consistency. The adjustment and position of the tube affect the reading value of the absorbance as the light goes through the sample controlled by the width of the cuvette. The distance traveled by light and the concentration of solution influence the estimation of absorbance. The appropriate wavelength and type of cuvette is the main component for measuring the correct absorbance with manually calibrating the cuvette.|$|E
