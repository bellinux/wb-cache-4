At {{the suggestion of}} Ono's live-in companion at the time, [...] interior decorator Sam Havadtoy, she recast her old pieces in bronze after some initial reluctance. [...] "I realized that for something to move me so much that I would cry, there's <b>something</b> <b>there.</b> There seemed like a shimmering air in the 60s when I made these pieces, and now the air is bronzified.

500|$|In {{most of his}} films, Sukumar's protagonists {{are shown}} to be characterised with grey shades. Y. Sunita Chowdary of The Hindu commented that Sukumar [...] "revels in giving a slight twist to his protagonist, in his {{background}} and character" [...] and leaves the audience to understand him as he [...] "unties the knots during narration and justifies his behaviour and makes us root for him". Karthik Keramalu of CNN-IBN, in his review of Kumari 21F, stated that Sukumar’s lead characters are [...] "psychologically wired differently", adding {{that at least one}} of the characters in his films [...] "behaves in a way that will amuse the audience and the other characters present in the film". Regarding the same, Sukumar said, [...] "We all have a lot of emotions and we suppress most of them fearing rejection. Instead we sport a smile and move on in this world. Problems arise when we don’t enjoy all feelings like jealousy, selfishness and don’t express them. To achieve <b>something,</b> <b>there</b> must be a driving force and that could be jealousy which you term as negative".|$|E
500|$|Written {{in the key}} of D {{major at}} a quick allegretto tempo of 108 beats per minute in common time, the [...] "playful" [...] "Something There" [...] is a Broadway musical-inspired duet in which Belle and the Beast finally {{conclude}} that [...] "there's <b>something</b> <b>there</b> that wasn't there before." [...] The song spans a duration of two minutes and eighteen seconds, making it the third shortest song on the soundtrack behind the reprises of [...] "Belle" [...] and [...] "Gaston", respectively. Describing [...] "Something There" [...] as [...] "a fluffy song," [...] Filmtracks.com observed that the song [...] "shares many instrumental devices with 'Belle';" [...] one of Belle's verses in [...] "Something There" [...] serves as [...] "a reprise of the secondary phrase from [...] ". Combined, O'Hara and Benson's vocal ranges span two octaves, from the low note of G3to the high note of E5. The song, described as [...] "a poignant character number" [...] performed [...] "Against a background of the easy rhythms of soft, lilting violins," [...] "allowed [...] to blend their voices." [...] In addition, Women's Studies in Communication observed that the [...] "tentative bursts of notes symbolize the uncertainties of this new way of relating".|$|E

500|$|Swivel {{dedicated}} {{much time}} in getting the vocal sound right, which according to him is crucial while working with Beyoncé's music. He further explained, [...] "I only put a quick EQ on the vocal {{at the end of}} a recording session if I have been cutting her, but mixing is far more particular, so I spent a lot of time dialling in the perfect frequency." [...] For the delay throws in the verses on [...] "I Care", he sent it through a large hall reverb at 50 percent — half reverb, half clean — then through an Amp Farm plug‑in for the grittiness, and that then went through a quarter‑note delay. In the bridge, é matches the guitar solo vocally — that was doubled — and one of the vocal tracks has an Amp Farm on it to add to that grittiness. To do justice to the multitude of vocal tracks within the song, Swivel created a stereo field using some clever panning techniques and a Waves S1 Imager plug‑in. He said that it was worth noting that whenever he mixes a record, [...] "I hate hard‑panned L/R. To get the right width, I pan them all differently in pairs: 40/40, 60/60, 70/70, 80/80, 90/90, and OK, maybe one is 100/100, but this process is ultimately what creates the stereo field." [...] Swivel used Waves' SSL E‑Channel plug‑in to shape Beyoncé's lead vocal. He took a Waves S1 Imager and spread with that without isolating he width. He added that something is hard‑panned, it feels too isolated and also confuses the listener's ears. Swivel explained further, [...] "I like smooth sound, and with B that works fine as she’s so good at matching everything. I like a wall of background vocals. It's the best way of putting your vocal in every area of the stereo field: a wide sound, but you’ve still got <b>something</b> <b>there</b> in the middle." ...|$|E

2500|$|During {{the final}} years of his life, Mantle {{purchased}} a condominium on Lake Oconee near Greensboro, Georgia, near Greer Johnson's home, and frequently stayed there for months at a time. He occasionally attended the local Methodist church, and sometimes ate Sunday dinner with members of the congregation. He was well-liked by the citizens of Greensboro, and seemed to like them in return. This was probably because the town respected Mantle's privacy, refusing either to talk about their famous neighbor to outsiders or to direct fans to his home. In one interview, Mantle stated that the people of Greensboro had [...] "gone {{out of their way to}} make me feel welcome, and I've found <b>something</b> <b>there</b> I haven't enjoyed since I was a kid." ...|$|E

Shaw embarked on two more successful university tours, and made appearances at Gay pride and Peace festivals.|$|E
2500|$|Shaw also {{embarked}} on a successful legal battle to establish ownership of her entire recording catalogue, and began working with contemporary acts and producers, reworking much of her 1960s and 1980s material.

Meanwhile, EMI released compilations of her French and Italian recordings, and the following year released similar compilations in Spanish and German. Newly remastered versions of Reviewing the Situation and Hello Angel also were issued with bonus tracks, and {{toward the end of}} the year a 4-CD box set entitled Nothing Comes Easy was released.
