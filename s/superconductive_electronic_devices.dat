40|$|Introduction Despite the {{increasingly}} widespread popularity of <b>electronic</b> <b>devices,</b> there are limited comprehensive {{studies on the}} effects of usage and exposure to multiple <b>electronic</b> <b>devices</b> over extended periods of time. Therefore, this study explored the cumulative musculoskeletal implications of exposure to various <b>electronic</b> <b>devices</b> among university students. Methods A self-reported questionnaire was administered in the university in Hong Kong and students provided information about the frequency and duration of <b>electronic</b> <b>devices</b> use, including computers, mobile phones and game consoles, and reported on any musculoskeletal pain or discomfort that may relate to <b>electronic</b> <b>devices</b> usage in the immediate 12 months prior to the survey date. Results A total of 503 university students (59 % males and 41 % females) aged 18 – 25 years completed the questionnaire. The results showed that 251 (49. 9 %) respondents reported upper limb musculoskeletal symptoms, particularly in the neck and shoulder regions. Among these, 155 (61. 8 %) indicated that their discomfort was related to <b>electronic</b> <b>device</b> usage. Statistically significant differences in exposure to <b>electronic</b> <b>devices</b> and musculoskeletal outcomes between genders were found (p <  0. 05).

The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate daytime screen use and use of <b>electronic</b> <b>devices</b> before bedtime in relation to sleep. Design: A large cross-sectional population-based survey study from 2012, the youth@hordaland study, in Hordaland County in Norway. Setting: Cross-sectional general community-based study. Participants: 9846 adolescents from three age cohorts aged 16 – 19. The main independent variables were type and frequency of <b>electronic</b> <b>devices</b> at bedtime and hours of screen-time during leisure time. Outcomes: Sleep variables calculated based on self-report including bedtime, rise time, time in bed, sleep duration, sleep onset latency and wake after sleep onset. Results: Adolescents spent a large amount of time during the day and at bedtime using <b>electronic</b> <b>devices.</b> Daytime and bedtime use of <b>electronic</b> <b>devices</b> were both related to sleep measures, with an increased risk of short sleep duration, long sleep onset latency and increased sleep deficiency. A dose–response relationship emerged between sleep duration and use of <b>electronic</b> <b>devices,</b> exemplified by the association between PC use and risk of less than 5  h of sleep (OR= 2. 70, 95 % CI 2. 14 to 3. 39), and comparable lower odds for 7 – 8  h of sleep (OR= 1. 64, 95 % CI 1. 38 to 1. 96).
