40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> <b>concessions</b> or other obligations in the World Trade Organization (WTO), specifically with how the arbitrators have understood this suspension, how they have interpreted the respective legal norms and how they have argued to set the level of suspension. The first chapter contains an introduction. The second chapter discusses the main objectives of suspending WTO concessions or other obligations, especially to induce compliance and to rebalance concessions. The former means creating incentives to bring the complaining party {{to comply with the}} recommendations and rulings of the WTO Dispute Settlement Body. The latter means restoring the balance between the parties' concessions that was upset by the complainant. This dissertation offers a three level approach that allows {{a better understanding of how}} these two objectives work. Chapter three {{deals with the}} level of nullification or impairment, and especially with the definition of nullification or impairment, the presumption contained in Art. 3. 8 DSU, the burden of proof and pass through estimations. The fourth chapter addresses the <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> <b>concessions</b> or other obligations, quantitatively as well as qualitatively. The focal point lies on defining the <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> <b>concessions</b> or other obligations, punitive sanctions, carousel sanctions, diachronically variable suspension levels, cross retaliation, standing, the right to suspend concessions or other obligations, and transferring the suspension potential. Chapter five analyses WTO decisions, reports and awards concerning the <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> <b>concessions</b> or other obligations. The results are systematised according to the three yardsticks that define the relation between the level of nullification or impairment and the level of <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> <b>concessions</b> or other obligations: equivalence (Art. 22. 4 DSU), appropriateness (Art. 4. 10 and 4. 11 SCM Agreement), and commensurateness (Art. 7. 9 and 7. 10 SCM Agreement).

40|$|To {{assess the}} {{effectiveness}} of the dispute settlement system of the World Trade Organization (WTO), it is necessary to evaluate whether WTO members promptly take the actions required to bring themselves into compliance with their WTO obligations, as those obligations have been defined or clarified in the dispute settlement reports issued by WTO panels and the Appellate Body. In this paper, the operation of the WTO dispute settlement system is briefly outlined, with particular emphasis on the overall time taken by the various stages. This is followed by an analysis of the implementation record for disputes brought under the WTO - both overall and on a member-by-member and agreement-by-agreement basis, with consideration of the types and disputes that have proved problematic. The conclusion of this paper is as follows: while overall record of implementation is relatively good, there are problem areas. Those problems could be mitigated with the modification of remedies provided for in the WTO dispute settlement so that (i) money payments could be substituted for the right to suspend concessions; (ii) such payments or <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> <b>concessions</b> could be calculated on a retrospective basis; and (iii) such payments or <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> <b>concessions</b> could be increased periodically over time in the event of continued non-implementation. ...|$|E

40|$|WTO dispute {{settlement}} procedures have been praised for their effectiveness, but recently {{there have been}} significant examples of Members failing to observe, or delaying implementation of, rulings and recommendations issued by the Dispute Settlement Bodies to rectify violations of the WTO Agreement. This issue has arisen particularly {{in cases where the}} U. S. has been challenged its "law as such" violations, in other words cases claiming that a country's domestic law or regulation in itself constitutes a violation of the WTO Agreement. These cases include those won by Japan against the U. S., and this implementation problem is becoming a pressing trade policy issue. Given special-interest politics and the "sectionalism" of the compartmentalized committee system in the U. S. Congress, it is desirable that procedures to ensure compliance be structured to encourage the Congress to promptly implement rulings by the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB). However, the current DSU (Dispute Settlement Understanding) and its operation in cases involving "law as such" are not necessarily conducive to this goal. First, when a reasonable period of time (RPT) for compliance is determined, the complained party is allowed a broad degree of discretion in selecting the measure to comply with the recommendation, and there is no guarantee of the shortest possible RPT enabling appropriate implementation. Second, while financial compensation imposes a broad-based fiscal burden on the concerned citizens of the complained party, continuation of the violation benefits special interest groups and circumvents pressure to comply with the DSB ruling. Third, under existing practice, the level of nullification or impairment for determining suspensions of concessions (countermeasures) is calculated on the basis of actual trade loss created by the violation in question, excluding the chilling effects on trade. In the few examples where the rules on contravention of the WTO agreement have been applied, the <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> <b>concessions</b> allowed has not been sufficient to cover this loss. It would be possible to partially resolve some of these issues by making some changes to the interpretation or application of the existing rules, but the agreement needs to be amended, particularly regarding the calculation of the level of <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> <b>concessions.</b> However, this issue has not been dealt with adequately in the proposals submitted to the DSU negotiations in the Doha Round. ...|$|E

The function of the DSM is to preserve and clarify the rights and obligations of WTO members states and “secure a positive and if possible a mutually acceptable solution to a dispute”. In order to recourse to the DSM, the injured Member should successfully demonstrate that the nullification or impairment resulted from three situations: violation, non-violation and any other situation.

40|$|The {{juridification}} of {{the dispute}} settlement procedure under the World Trade Organization (WTO) has extended the effective rule of law {{into the realm of}} international trade. Over the years, however, there has been a series of cases in which a losing complained party failed to correct its violation in a timely manner and the complainant had to fall back on the <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> <b>concessions</b> - countervailing measures whereby certain violation measures were maintained and left uncorrected {{over an extended period of}} time. Such non-implementation or delayed implementation tends to occur in cases of special importance, with a highly complex political background, and has been observed particularly among major WTO Members such as the U. S. and the European Communities. The presence of this implementation issue does not mean that the WTO dispute settlement mechanism is altogether defective. But major Members' repeated disregard of recommendations and rulings of the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) will in the long run threaten the legitimacy of the WTO as a forum for solving trade disputes. Kawase and Araki (2005) examines this problem from various angles to illustrate the diverse factors, both legal and practical, that lie beneath it. Consequently, it has been found that, regarding factors relating to dispute settlement procedures, the adequacy of the interpretation of WTO rules by panel or the Appellate Body, the clarity of panel/Appellate Body recommendations, and the level of concessions to be suspended have provoked the implementation issue. To solve this problem, it is necessary to amend the current dispute settlement procedures. Against the backdrop of compliance theory, these findings can be summed up as follows. The problem of non-compliance by WTO members primarily stems from two deficiencies - the lack of enforceability that is based on rational choice theory, and the lack of normative recognition or respect on the part of a losing complained party for the particular WTO judgment. Therefore, procedurally amending these two aspects would improve the implementation of WTO rulings. In negotiations on the amendment of the Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) under the Doha Round, however, not many proposals made have sufficiently addressed the implementation issue. Moreover, there seems to be no prospect of agreement on the DSU. Under such conditions, the realistic and most desirable choice would be to seek gradual improvements in the implementation by employing a "soft" method with measures that can be taken under the existing DSU, in lieu of trying to amend it. For instance, to strengthen enforceability the DSB could authorize the <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> <b>concessions</b> in a way more focused on the qualitative aspects of remedies. From the normative point of view, WTO panels and the Appellate Body could exercise judicial economy and discretion over the recommendations of specific way for implementation with a greater recognition of the feasibility of compliance, while the DSB, as a political collegial body, could strengthen the reviewing of panel/Appellate Body reports. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{issue of}} {{non-compliance}} with the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) recommendations and rulings emerges when the violator state fails to bring its inconsistent measures into conformity with its WTO obligations {{within a reasonable}} period of time. Compensation and <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> <b>concessions</b> or other obligations (retaliation) are the only remedies provided under WTO law for cases of non-compliance. Many academic writings, as well as statements from WTO Members, have demonstrated pessimism concerning {{the effectiveness of these}} remedies, particularly retaliation. The central point of this thesis concerns three main issues: the problems of WTO retaliation, the question of the effectiveness of retaliation, and the purposes of retaliation. This thesis aims to provide another perspective, besides the common “harm-resulted” perspective, for assessing the effectiveness of WTO retaliation. Accordingly, it provides several approaches: (1) identification of the purpose of retaliation in order to assess its effectiveness; (2) analysis of the enquiry whether there are in fact several purposes of WTO retaliation; (3) examination of the question whether the presence of retaliation purposes other than that inducing compliance is within the ambit of WTO law; (4) consideration of retaliation as a way of inducing a mutually agreeable solution; and (5) consideration of the question whether any deviation from strict compliance would undermine the WTO dispute settlement system. On the basis of extensive research on the purposes of WTO retaliation, namely through interpreting Article 22 of the DSU, examining the design of WTO treaty, assessing the academic writings/debates as well as the statements of arbitrators; several conclusions are made, of which the main one is that inducing compliance is not the sole purpose that WTO retaliation can pursue. Therefore compliance is not the only benchmark by which the effectiveness of WTO retaliation should be measured...|$|E
40|$|In theory, the WTO dispute {{settlement}} system is expected, via an elaborate system of sequential legal maneuvers {{to ensure the}} implementation of the {{dispute settlement}} body (DSB) recommendations. In reality when trade issues rise above some critical threshold to a respondent, the theory behind the DSU enforcement breaks down and the well meaning legal system only leads to prolonging the dispute rather than resolving it. Since 1995, more than 300 complaints have been filed through the WTO dispute settlement system. In most cases, the parties reach a mutually satisfactory solution in accordance with the WTO Agreements through consultations without having recourse to the panel and Appellate Body review. When the consultation process fails the resulting process of Panel reports and Appellate Body reports result in a removal or modification of the violating measures. In those cases where there is no removal or modification of the violating measures, the period of non-compliance tends to be very long and leads to core questions about the true intent of the DSU. In particular, was the DSU designed to ensure a legal process for the settlement of a dispute and to recommend a remedy to the offending violation but was not designed to secure compliance. The intent {{of this paper is to}} show that this is indeed the case. Moreover, if one treats the WTO as a contract, then the non-compliance issue may be viewed as an `efficient breach' and the only efficient remedy is a `fine' rather than the usual practice of <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> <b>concessions</b> or other obligations to the offending Member. Under our suggested enforcement rules, it may be possible for a Member to continue to breach her obligation to the WTO contract while simultaneously compensating for damages created by the offending measure. The end result will be more efficient than the current system of diplomatic maneuvering designed to pressure the Member to remove or modify the offending measure. ...|$|E
40|$|To settle {{disputes}} concerning {{rights or}} obligations under WTO agreements, the WTO enforces a dispute settlement system. The WTO dispute settlement {{system has been}} in operation since 1995 and has, during this time, been the most productive of all international dispute settlement systems. The Dispute Settlement Understanding is a dispute settlement system between governments, {{and the use of}} the system is limited to members of the WTO. The WTO dispute settlement process contains four main stages, namely consultations, the panel stage, appellate review proceedings, and implementation and enforcement. I am focusing on the critical stage of implementation and enforcement and the practical problems that may arise using the remedies available in this phase of the process in this thesis. The Dispute Settlement Understanding offers three types of remedies when a member is breaking WTO law. The withdrawal or amendment of the WTO-inconsistent measure is the final remedy. The DSU also provides for two temporary remedies which may be applied while awaiting the withdrawal or amendment or if the losing party fails to bring its inconsistent measure into compliance with WTO obligations. The two temporary remedies are compensation and <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> <b>concessions</b> or other obligations. One issue arising at the implementation stage of the DSU is the relationship between article 21. 5 of the DSU and article 22. 2 of the DSU. Question may arise whether the compliance proceedings or the <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> <b>concessions</b> proceedings has priority, if either. Past DSU review negotiations have not found a solution to this issue of sequencing yet, the discussion is continuing in the current negotiations. The concept of compensation has not been used very frequently. There are several possible reasons why compensation as a remedy is rarely used in practice and I am focusing on three aspects in this thesis. First, compensation is voluntary, and the disputing parties have to agree on the solution. Second, the compensation must be consistent with the covered agreements. Third, the current system on compensation may not provide for effective reparation of damages suffered by the complaining party. There have been discussions from time to time to make the compensation within the DSU financial but every proposal has always been turned down. To suspend concessions or other obligations is a remedy used more frequently than compensation. However, there are practical problems arising with this remedy as well. First, retaliation measures are trade destructive and can affect the injured party negatively as well as the losing party. Second, in particular the possibility to retaliate is not a genuine option to smaller or developing country members. Third, these smaller and developing country members are also the ones that are most affected by the possibility to “cross-retaliate”. The discussion in this thesis shows that the remedy is not efficient for every party in every single dispute and may therefore uphold the inequality between the members of the WTO. It was determined by the time of the introduction of the DSU that the system was to be examined and evaluated after using it for a couple of years. The negotiations are still in progress. The members were encouraged to contribute with questions, proposals, and comments concerning changes and improvements of the DSU to these special sessions. The Chairman of the Special Session of the DSU summarized the proposals and drafted legal texts which ended up in the so-called Chairman’s text. To me, it seems like the review of the DSU has been set aside while awaiting the negotiations in other important WTO areas. We may see the DSU as part of the overall “give and take” in the end anyway, even if this was not a desirable outcome in the beginning of the negotiations. 356 consultation questions have been made since the introduction of the dispute settlement system. It is important to remember that the great majority of the cases are settled through consultations or mutually agreed solutions, never reaching the full DSU process and the problems with the remedies described in this thesis. The remedies available today may not always result in the most efficient solution. However, it is important to remember that the remedies existing today are the remedies which the member states found they were willing to accept both as successful complainants and as unsuccessful defendants. From a democratic, diplomatic, and political point of view, an emergency exit like article 22 of the DSU is necessary for the practical function of the WTO dispute settlement system...|$|E

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{overview of the}} jurisprudence of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2015 would clearly exceed the space the editors of this journal have kindly reserved for this annual effort: in 2015, eleven Appellate Body reports and nine panel reports were circulated. In addition, arbitrators issued three decisions as to the reasonable period of time for compliance under Article 21. 3 (c) of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (DSU) and issued two decisions regarding <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> <b>concessions</b> under Article 22. 6 DSU. These numbers are indicative of the ongoing interest of the membership in the WTO’s dispute settlement mechanism, which, regrettably, is not matched {{by the use of}} the WTO as negotiating forum. Thus, we do not aim to paint a comprehensive picture of what has been noteworthy in 2015 in the world of WTO dispute settlement. Rather, we submit a (highly subjective) selection of what we consider particularly interesting reports of both the Appellate Body and the panels. This year, we present at some length three Appellate Body reports, dealing, inter alia, with the relationship between free trade agreements (FTAs) and WTO law, the relevance of the general law on treaties for the interpretation of WTO law (Peru – Agricultural Products) and the thorny issue of interpreting Article 2. 1 and 2. 2 of the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) raised in the Article 21. 5 DSU procedures in the context of two seminal TBT disputes (US – Tuna II and US – COOL). The two panel reports selected deal with the law of the GATS and the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures: both explore particularly relevant issues, such as the conditions {{for the use of the}} prudential exception in GATS and the conditions, under which sanitary and phytosanitary measures can be used as precaution against what seems, on the basis of available pertinent information a threat to life or health of humans, flora and fauna. The Appellate Body and panel reports we did not report in detail deal with core issues of WTO law, including anti-dumping law, safeguard measures, quantitative restrictions, discrimination under GATT, the role of standards in international trade, agricultural trade and other legal issues that would merit further discussion. A case in point is India – Agricultural Products; there, the Appellate Body dealt for the first time with Article 6 of the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS). This provision contains a concretization of the principle of proportionality: Members undertake to adapt the measures they take against threats emanating from imported agricultural goods to the conditions prevailing in the pertinent region.

As an institution with Membership of 149 countries, {{the goal of the}} WTO is to facilitate the implementation, administration, and operation of the Multilateral Trade Agreements (MTAs); to provide a forum for negotiations among Member States; to administer the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes, amongst others. The Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (DSU) of the WTO has been touted as one of the biggest achievements of the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations. Its aim is to provide security and predictability to the multilateral trading system. It provides for a range of remedies where there has been a violation of WTO obligations. With all these remedies in place, the WTO dispute settlement mechanism is actively being used in the resolution of disputes among WTO Members. Despite this however, cases generally revolve around ‘the usual suspects’ i. e. the countries that have been making the most use of dispute settlement procedures under the WTO (e. g. the United States, the European Communities, Canada, and Brazil). It is a fact that the smaller developing countries have been sorely lacking in the WTO dispute settlement procedure. This paper argues {{that one of the reasons}} why more use is not being made of the dispute settlement process by developing countries is the inadequacy of the existing remedies, for their peculiar situation. The existing dispute settlement remedies are: withdrawal of the offending measure, compensation, and <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> equivalent <b>concessions</b> i. e. retaliation. But it has been found that these remedies do not always meet the expectations of Members. The violating Member will not always remove the violation; Compensation is hardly ever agreed on; and Retaliation is at odds with the trade liberalization goal of the WTO and hardly benefits either party anyway. Consequently, there is an urgent need to review the existing remedies with a view to finding alternative remedies, particularly for developing countries. This paper is proposing monetary compensation as an alternative dispute settlement remedy. With the current negotiations going on as part of the Doha Round, the appropriate forum is available for these discussions to take place...|$|R

After extending in reduced form a standard regulation model, in which renegotiation occurs due to the imperfect enforcement <b>of</b> <b>concession</b> contracts, we use a unique data set <b>of</b> 307 <b>concessions</b> awarded in Latin America from 1989 to 2000, covering the sectors of transport and water, to analyze the determinants of this high incidence of renegotiations of infrastructure contracts. We look in details at the impact, on the probability of renegotiation <b>of</b> a <b>concession,</b> <b>of</b> regulatory institutions, institutional features, economic shocks and of the characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>concession</b> contracts themselves. We then derive some policy implications of our work. ...|$|R
