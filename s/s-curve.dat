5|$|Continuing {{north of}} Manotick through fields, Highway416 is crossed by the Prescott Highway {{for the fourth}} and final time as that road turns {{northeast}} and travels into downtown Ottawa as Prince of Wales Drive. Shortly thereafter is an interchange with Brophy Drive / Bankfield Road; the latter provides access to the Prescott Highway / Prince of Wales Drive. Approaching urban Ottawa, the route passes alongside a large quarry, then jogs to the west along an <b>S-curve,</b> crossing the Jock River in the process. After this, an interchange with Fallowfield Road provides access to the suburb of Barrhaven which occupies portions of the land immediately east of the freeway. The route jogs back to the east along a second <b>S-curve</b> and passes through an aesthetically designed bridge while traveling alongside the Stony Swamp.|$|E
5|$|Variable-speed drives {{can also}} run a motor in {{specialized}} patterns to further minimize mechanical and electrical stress. For example, an <b>S-curve</b> pattern {{can be applied}} to a conveyor application for smoother deceleration and acceleration control, which reduces the backlash that can occur when a conveyor is accelerating or decelerating.|$|E
5|$|In December 2006 and January 2007, {{during the}} off-season, both zero-G rolls {{were removed from}} the ride. The rolls were a problem due to {{concerns}} of occasional stalling caused by a failure of the tower's LIMs. The rolls were replaced by a slightly banked inclined <b>S-curve.</b> Batman's train had its shells painted red so Robin could be ready to open first before Batman. This was done because Robin was more reliable than Batman and the track replacement for Robin was completed first on March 13. It re-opened on April 7. Batman's track was replaced between April 16 and April 20, while the park was closed. However, Batman never re-opened.|$|E

5|$|In Dix, NY414 makes a large reverse <b>S-curve,</b> {{turning to}} the east and {{northeast}} as it follows the Corning Secondary through another creek valley, this one surrounding Shequaga Creek. The creek eventually heads east toward Montour Falls; however, NY414 and the rail line continue northeast to the outskirts of Watkins Glen, a village located inside of a wide valley holding Seneca Lake. At {{the western edge of the}} gully, the Corning Secondary breaks from NY414 to follow the ridge north through Watkins Glen State Park. The route, meanwhile, descends the side of the valley to enter Watkins Glen, where it merges with NY14 at the foot of the hill.|$|E
5|$|MD7 crosses North East Creek {{and enters}} the town of North East, where the highway is known as Cecil Avenue. The highway intersects MD272, which follows a one-way pair, Main Street {{southbound}} and Mauldin Avenue northbound. MD7 leaves the town and passes through a forested area with scattered residences. The route passes through an <b>S-curve</b> during which it crosses to {{the north side of}} the Amtrak Northeast Corridor. On {{the north side of the}} bridge is a stub of old alignment, MD7H. MD7 continues east, passing Old Elk Neck Road before turning north and reaching its eastern terminus at US40. The roadway continues beyond the intersection as MD279 (Elkton Road).|$|E
5|$|Once in Otsego County, it {{traverses}} an <b>s-curve</b> before veering to {{the east}} to follow the southern bank of the Susquehanna River through the town of Oneonta. The route initially connects {{to the city of}} Oneonta, which is located across the river from NY28, via Main Street. Shortly afterward, NY28 meets NY23. The route turns north, overlapping NY23 along the four-lane James F. Lettis Highway. The two routes cross the River and enter the Oneonta city limits before separating at I-88 exit15. NY23 continues north on the arterial, while NY28 joins I-88eastward out of the city.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – Since the {{introduction}} of the concepts of the J- and <b>S-curves,</b> many researchers have tried to verify their validity empirically. This paper aims to review the related papers and to offer direction for future research. Design/methodology/approach – This is a review paper. As such, no method is employed here. Rather, the methodologies used by others to test the J- and <b>S-curves</b> are explained and reviewed. Findings – No new findings are offered since this is a review paper. Practical implications – The J- and <b>S-curves</b> show whether currency depreciation worsens the trade balance first before improving it. Since the majority of studies are country-specific, policymakers could benefit by learning whether currency depreciation will be effective in improving the trade balance. Originality/value – This is a literature review paper and its originality is in terms of collecting the literature together and presenting it in one single paper.

5|$|East of NY198, {{the road}} becomes more open {{as it passes}} through neighborhoods with a more {{suburban}} residential feel to them. Along this stretch, NY33 connects to several streets, including Bailey Avenue (U.S. Route62 or US62) and Harlem Road (NY240). Past Harlem Road, the expressway makes a slight curve to the south as it prepares to meet a toll-free section of the New York State Thruway (I-90) at a cloverleaf interchange. Beyond I-90, the expressway veers to the south again, traversing an <b>S-curve</b> before connecting to Union Road (NY277) {{by way of a}} partial interchange. After another , NY33 curves south under Genesee Street before joining it at a traffic light in front of the Buffalo Niagara International Airport.|$|E
5|$|MD 285 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with MD 213 (Augustine Herman Highway) {{at the north}} end of the Chesapeake City Bridge. The highway heads east as two-lane Lock Street, which curves south at county-maintained Hemphill Street. MD 285 curves to the southwest at its junction with the north end of MD 284 (Hemphill Street) and enters the town of Chesapeake City. The highway continues to Biddle Street, onto which the route turns east; Lock Street continues south to the Chesapeake & Delaware Canal. MD 285 meets the southern end of MD 284 (Hemphill Street) and passes through an <b>S-curve</b> before leaving the town. The highway parallels the canal to the north and intersects Knights Corner Road before reaching its eastern terminus at the Delaware state line, from which the highway continues as Chesapeake City Road.|$|E
5|$|Now in {{the town}} of Walworth, NY441 becomes Walworth–Penfield Road. Just east of the county line, NY441 shifts {{slightly}} northward by way of an <b>S-curve</b> that serves as a connector between the segmented West Walworth Road, which NY441 intersects {{at both ends of the}} curve. This is the last curve along NY441 as it follows a linear east–west routing over several small hills to a junction with NY350 west of the hamlet of Walworth, where NY441 terminates. The roadway, however, continues east to Marion as Walworth–Penfield Road, Walworth–Marion Road, and Buffalo Street, a continuous highway maintained by Wayne County as County Route205 (CR205) west of Hall Center Road and Maple Avenue and as CR207 east of those roads.|$|E
50|$|The {{cities of}} Grand Island and Hastings {{are less than}} 30 mi apart, but have {{different}} area codes. Hastings {{is just a few}} miles east of the <b>S-curved</b> line defining the 308/402 divide.|$|R
30|$|The {{gathered}} {{information about}} {{advantages and disadvantages}} can be combined with the study of <b>S-curves</b> and with a full-scale failure analysis to provide precise indications about the potential of development for a given technology.|$|R
30|$|It {{is evident}} that the {{explosive}} early growth is well captured in the model, whereas both <b>S-curves</b> fail to fit the data. The deviation between the data and <b>S-curves</b> is more evident in the semi-log and log-log plots of Figure  7. To further quantify the goodness of the fits, we calculated the normalized average residuals to be 0.013, 0.81, and 6.23 for the multiplicative model, sigmoid Eq. (9), and sigmoid Eq. (10) respectively. These {{results indicate that the}} model of Eq. (3) provides a better fit to the data and considering that Eq. (10) has four free parameters (compared to our model with three), one can confidently reject the superiority of a logistic S-shaped model.|$|R
5|$|MD 198 curves {{northeast}} and meets {{the northern end}} of MD 197 (Laurel Bowie Road) before crossing the Patuxent River, where the route leaves the city of Laurel and enters Anne Arundel County. The highway, now named Laurel Fort Meade Road, passes one of the main entrances to Laurel Park Racecourse and passes through Maryland City. MD 198 drops to four lanes at its partial cloverleaf interchange with the BaltimoreWashington Parkway (unsigned MD 295) and then becomes a two-lane road a short distance east of the interchange. The state highway crosses the Little Patuxent River, then curves southeast and expands to a four-lane divided highway as it parallels MD 32 (Patuxent Freeway). At the entrance to Tipton Airport, MD 198 curves north and meets MD 32 at a dumbbell interchange. The highway passes through an <b>S-curve</b> then reaches its northern terminus at an entrance to Fort Meade. The road continues into the military installation as Mapes Road.|$|E
5|$|MD32 {{heads into}} a forested area and crosses the Morgan Run arm of Liberty Reservoir. The state highway passes through an <b>S-curve</b> before heading through the {{communities}} of Louisville and Gamber, where the highway meets {{the southern end of}} MD91 (Gamber Road). MD32 continues northwest through a mix of farmland and residential subdivisions toward Fenby, where the highway intersects MD97 (New Washington Road). Just north of MD97 adjacent to Carroll Community College, the state highway meets MD97's old alignment, Old Washington Road, which is unsigned MD854B. MD32 continues north as Washington Road through a suburban area; the highway parallels MD97 and passes to the east of the historic Friendship Valley Farm and Carroll County Almshouse and Farm, which is now the Carroll County Farm Museum. Just north of Bennett Avenue, MD32 reaches its northern terminus at the southern city limit of Westminster. The roadway continues north as a municipal street to Main Street, which heads northwest through the Westminster Historic District.|$|E
5|$|The {{first state}} {{highways}} along the US131 corridor were designated {{as early as}} 1919. When the US Highway System was formed on November 11, 1926, US131 was created along the route of M-13 in Michigan. Originally ending at Fife Lake on the north end, the highway was extended to Petoskey in the late 1930s. Further changes were made, starting in the 1950s, to convert segments {{of the road to}} a full freeway. The state started this conversion simultaneously at two locations: heading north from Three Rivers, and heading both north and south from a point in southern Kent County. A third segment was built south of Cadillac and over subsequent years Michigan filled the gaps in the freeway. Cadillac and Manton were bypassed {{in the early part of}} the 21st century, resulting in the current freeway configuration. Another large-scale construction project in 2000 rebuilt an unusual section of the freeway through Grand Rapids known as the <b>S-Curve.</b> Two bridges formerly used by US131 have been labeled by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) as historic structures; one of them has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).|$|E

5|$|The {{vertebral}} column consisted of ten cervical (neck), twelve dorsal, six fused sacral and {{an unknown number}} of caudal (tail) vertebrae. The neck was nearly straight, rather than having the <b>S-curve</b> seen in other theropods, and also unusually wide, especially towards its base. The top of the neck's spinal column featured a double row of enlarged, upwardly directed bony processes called epipophyses, creating a smooth trough {{on the top of the}} neck vertebrae. These processes were the highest points of the spine, towering above the unusually low spinous processes. The epipophyses probably provided attachment areas for a markedly strong neck musculature. A similar double row was also present in the tail, formed there by highly modified caudal ribs, in front view protruding upwards in a V-shape, their inner sides creating a smooth, flat, top surface of the front tail vertebrae. The end of each caudal rib was furnished with a forward projecting hook-shaped expansion that connected to the caudal rib of the preceding vertebra.|$|E
