40|$|ABSTRACT: Soil {{grouting}} {{has become}} a popular method for soil improvement in recent years. Grouting is generally intended to increase a soil’s strength, increase its liquefaction resistance, or reduce its hydraulic conductivity. Soil grouting involves the injection, permeation, or me-chanical mixing of cementitious, silica, or clay grout into a soil deposit. With the increase in popularity of these methods comes the issue of testing grouted soils to verify the expected soil improvement. While some of the methods and materials mentioned result in soils that are sufficiently cemented to produce trimmable specimens that can stand under their own weight, other methods produce softer materials that {{are very difficult to}} sample or even to recreate and test in the lab. Preparing such soft samples in the laboratory poses two challenges: 1) if the specimen is prepared in the triaxial cell directly, the grouting process might not be feasible because of the porous stones and small diameter tubing in the triaxial cell; and 2) if the specimens are prepared outside the triaxial cell, soft specimens {{might not be able to}} stand under their own weight without significant strains and damage to the soil structure. This paper will thoroughly describe a three-way <b>split</b> <b>mold</b> specifically designed to accommodate the per-meation and testing of soils that are too soft or too weak to be easily sampled or tested in the lab. A simple procedure outlining the use of this three-way <b>split</b> <b>mold</b> will also be described. Finally, the results from a series of consolidated undrained, monotonically loaded triaxial tests will be presented as an example of the <b>split</b> <b>mold</b> application. These tests utilized the new three-way <b>split</b> <b>mold</b> for sample preparation of loose Ottawa sand permeated with a thixotropic bentonite suspension...|$|E

40|$|Context: Relining {{with heat}} cure denture base resin is {{time-consuming}} {{and the patient}} has to remain without dentures within this period. Recently, some autopolymerizing resins marketed as hard chairside reline systems with low exothermic heat allow the dentists to reline prosthesis directly in the mouth. However, {{the decision to use}} these materials must be based on physical properties such as dimensional accuracy that directly influences the accuracy of fit of the denture base. Aim: The aim was to compare the linear dimensional changes of two hard chairside reline resins with two laboratory heat cure resins at 3 times intervals after processing. Settings and Design: A stainless steel <b>split</b> <b>mold</b> (International Organization for Standardization 1567) was used for sample fabrication. Five measurements of the reference dimensions (AB and CD) were measured directly from the mold and the samples with a profile projector, and mean difference were calculated. Subjects and Methods: Forty samples were fabricated by incorporating the <b>split</b> <b>mold</b> into first pour of denture flasks and packing each of the chairside reline resins ("Kooliner" and "Ufi Gel Hard") and laboratory heat cure resins ("Dental Products of India Heat Cure" and "Trevalon"). The mean difference in dimensional change at 3 times intervals (0 h, 4 days and 2 months) were calculated and subjected to statistical analysis. Statistical Analysis Used: One-way ANOVA, RMANOVA and post hoc Tukey′s tests. Results: All resins showed different levels of significant shrinkage (P < 0. 001) after processing (T 0) ranging from − 0. 128 to − 0. 310 mm. After 4 days (T 1), there was significant shrinkage (P < 0. 001) ranging from − 0. 168 to − 0. 296 mm. After 2 months (T 2), there was again significant shrinkage (P < 0. 001) ranging from − 0. 018 to − 0. 216 mm. Chairside reline resins showed less dimensional shrinkage at each time interval than the laboratory heat cure resins.

40|$|The {{test for}} {{compressive}} strength {{has been studied}} using zinc oxide eugenol cements. The distribution of results is negatively skewed; however, removal of outlying results converts it to a normal one. Test parameters have little effect on results with the excep-tion of {{the shape of the}} test cylinder. Compressive strength is a property com-monly measured to assess the quality of a dental cement. A minimum requirement is contained in international recommendations or specifications for all classes of luting and filling cements. Since this is a test to de-struction, the scatter of experimental results is considerable. In this short study using zinc oxide eugenol cements, the distribution of experimental results has been established. In addition, the influence of various test pa-rameters on experimental results has been examined. Materials and Methods Two brands of zinc oxide eugenol cement were used, a simple one and a reinforced one (Table 1). Cement pastes were pre-pared under carefully controlled conditions of temperature (23 + 1 C) and relative hu-midity (50 + 2 %) using a fixed powder-liquid ratio for each cement brand.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the time to final set and compressive strength of the white mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) formulation to the original grey MTA. To test compressive strength, each MTA formulation was placed into Teflon <b>split</b> <b>molds</b> for four hours at 37 ° Celsius (C) and 100 % humidity. Compressive strength of both MTA formulations was measured at 24 hours (n= 12) and 21 days (n= 19) using an Instron Testing Machine. For determination of time to final set, each MTA formulation (n= 6) was placed into a metal mold and maintained at 37 ° C and 100 % humidity while setting. At five-minute time intervals, an indenter needle was lowered onto the surface of the MTA material and allowed to remain in place for five seconds before it was removed from the specimen surface. This process was repeated until the needle failed to make a complete circular indentation in the MTA specimen. Results of a two-way ANOVA indicate that white MTA had a significantly higher compressive strength (mean= 32. 7 MPa) than grey MTA (mean= 25. 2 MPa) at 24 hours and no statistically significant differences at 21 days (white mean= 38. 6 MPa and grey mean= 38. 0 MPa).

40|$|Researchers and {{laboratory}} personnel often encounter some difficulties when using standard compaction methods to compact a soil sample {{before they are}} tested with the triaxial machine. The difficulties include; difficulties in extrusion, bulkiness of rammers, and non-uniformity {{in the distribution of}} blows, and associated sample disturbance when preparing specimens for triaxial testing. These problems have been curbed by the use of minicompactors which are newer technologies. A minicompactor (Nanjing Soil Minicompactor) manufactured to enable production of 39. 1 mm diameter that can fit into triaxial machine (Model TS 2 - 1) was used for the compaction studies.

This study was planned to evaluate the effect of two different postcuring techniques on microhardness of indirect composite resin after wet-aging and comparing them with the direct type. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 99 composite disk-shaped (6. 5 × 2. 5 mm) specimens of composite (Gradia GC, Japan) were prepared in <b>split</b> <b>mold.</b> The indirect composite specimens were postcured by laboratory light source (Labolite LV-III GC Corp, Japan) or microwave unit (MC 2002 JR, LG, Korea). Then, the aging procedure was done for 24 h, 30 and 180 days in distilled water. The Vicker′s Hardness test (VHN) on surface of specmens was measured by Wolpert microhardness tester and the data were analyzed by the two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey′s post hoc tests. (P ≤ 0. 05). Results: The statistical analysis revealed that surface microhardness of postcured composite by microwave and laboratory light source was more than that of direct composite (P = 0. 0001) and postcuring by microwave was more effective than postcuring by laboratory light source (P = 0. 004). The 30 days stored composite demonstrated significant decrease of VHN compared with the 24 -h stored samples (P = 0. 0001), with a more significant VHN decrease after 180 days of aging (P = 0. 045).

40|$|Statement of the Problem: Sufficient {{adhesion}} between silorane/methacrylate-based composites and methacrylate impregnated {{glass fiber}} increases {{the benefits of}} fibers and enhances the mechanical and clinical performance of both composites. Purpose: The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the compatibility of silorane and methacrylate-based composites with pre-impregnated glass fiber by using flexural strength (FS) test. Materials and Method: A total of 60 bar specimens were prepared in a <b>split</b> <b>mold</b> (25 × 2 × 2 mm) in 6 groups (n= 10). In groups 1 and 4 (control), silorane-based (Filtek P 90) and nanohybrid (Filtek Z 350) composites were placed into the mold and photopolymerized with a high-intensity curing unit. In groups 2 and 5, pre-impregnated glass fiber was first placed into the mold and after two minutes of curing, the mold was filled with respective composites. Prior to filling the mold in groups 3 and 6, an intermediate adhesive layer was applied to the glass fiber. The specimens were stored in distilled water for 24 hours and then their flexural strength was measured by 3 point bending test, using universal testing machine at the crosshead speed of 1 mm/min. Two-way ANOVA and post-hoc test were used for analyzing the data (p< 0. 05). Results: A significant difference was observed between the groups (p< 0. 05). The highest FS was registered for combination of Z 350 composite, impregnated glass fiber, and application of intermediate adhesive layer. The lowest FS was obtained in Filtek P 90 alone. Cohesive failure in composite was the predominant failure in all groups, except group 5 in which adhesive failure between the composite and fiber was exclusively observed. Conclusion: Significant improvement in FS was achieved for both composites with glass fiber. Additional application of intermediate adhesive layer before composite build up seems to increase FS. Nanohybrid composite showed higher FS than silorane-based composite. ...|$|E
40|$|Aims: To {{compare the}} effects of {{repeated}} use of two one-bottle adhesives with that of two all- in- one adhesives (with acetone solvent) on bond strength to dentin. Materials and Methods: A flat dentin surface was prepared on 120 bovine incisors using 600 - grit abrasive pape. The teeth were randomly assigned into 12 equal groups. The four adhesive systems [Prime and Bond NT (P&B NT), One-Step Plus (OS), iBond (iB), and G-Bond (GB) ] were used at baseline, after {{the lid of the}} container had been opened 30 times, and after it had been opened 60 times. Before each use of the adhesives, the lids of the containers were left open for 1 min. The resin composites were applied on the dentin in a cylindrical <b>split</b> <b>mold.</b> After thermocycling, shear bond strength test was performed with a universal testing machine at 1 &# 8197;mm/min. We used Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn tests for statistical analysis. Results: There was no statistically significant difference among bond strength (MPa) of the groups of P&B NT (31. 9 &#x 00 B 1; 4. 6, 31. 8 &#x 00 B 1; 6. 5, 26. 1 &#x 00 B 1; 6. 7) and OS (33. 2 &#x 00 B 1; 5. 1, 30. 9 &#x 00 B 1; 7, 29. 3 &#x 00 B 1; 5. 9), respectively (P > 0. 05). The mean of the bond strength of iB and GB after 60 times (15. 3 &#x 00 B 1; 4. 1 and 12. 2 &#x 00 B 1; 3. 9, respectively) was significantly lower than that of iB and GB at baseline (23. 5 &#x 00 B 1; 4. 8 and 22. 2 &#x 00 B 1; 4. 5, respectively) (P < 0. 05). Conclusions: Repeated use (60 times) of the all-in-one adhesive led to a decline in the dentin bond strength. To avoid this problem it would be advisable to have containers with smaller amounts of adhesive or perhaps those with only a singe dose...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effect of different filler sizes and shapes on the surface roughness of experimental resin-composite series. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-three disc-shaped specimens of the series (Spherical-RZD 102, 105, 106, 107, 114 and Irregular-RZD 103, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112) were prepared in a <b>split</b> Teflon <b>mold</b> and irradiated with an halogen light-curing unit (450 mW/cm² for 40 s) at both top and bottom surfaces. The specimens were stored for 3 months in distilled water. The surface roughness values in form of surface finish-vertical parameter (Ra), maximum roughness depth (Rmax) and horizontal roughness parameter (Sm) were recorded using a contact profilometer. The data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and the means were compared by Scheffé post-hoc test (a= 0. 05). RESULTS: The lowest surface roughness (Ra) was observed in S- 100 (0. 079 ± 0. 013), while the roughest surface was noted in I- 450 / 700 / 1000 (0. 125 ± 0. 011) and I- 450 / 1000 (0. 124 ± 0. 004). The spherical-shape series showed the smoothest surface finish compared to the irregular-shape ones with higher significant difference (p> 0. 05). The vertical surface roughness parameter (Ra) values increased as the filler size increased yielding a linear relation (r²= 0. 82). On the contrary, the horizontal parameter (Sm) was not significantly affected by the filler size (r²= 0. 24) as well as the filler shape. CONCLUSIONS: Filler particle's size and shape have a great effect on the surface roughness parameters of these composite series...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The {{aim was to}} {{evaluate}} and compare the shear bond strength of nano-hydroxyapatite (Nano-HAp) incorporated and conventional glass ionomer cement (GIC). Materials and Methods: Nano-HAp GIC was prepared by replacing 8 wt% of GIC powder with nano-HAp powder. Twenty-six HAp disks were used as substrate for bonding and divided into two equal groups. Before bonding the HAp disk was prepared by silicon carbide (no. 2500) followed by 10 % polyacrylic acid conditioning. The standardized samples were prepared using <b>split</b> teflon <b>mold</b> on customized bonding jig so as to adhere testing materials to pretreated HAp disk. These samples were stored in distilled water for 24 h at 37 °C before bond strength testing. Results: The descriptive statistical analysis and independent samples t-test were used. The nano-HAp incorporated and conventional GIC had the mean shear bond strength of 3. 28 ± 0. 89 MPa and 5. 25 ± 0. 88 MPa, respectively. Nano-HAp incorporated GIC had lower shear bond strength with {{very high level of}} significance (P < 0. 001). The nano-HAp incorporated GIC showed mainly mixed type of failure whereas conventional GIC showed mainly a cohesive failure. Conclusion: The lower shear bond strength of nano-HAp incorporate GIC revealed that the addition of nano-HAp interfered with the bonding ability of GIC to the substrate interface, but the mixed type of failure in nano-HAp incorporated GIC suggests that it increases the strength of the matrix. However, the role of nano-size particles on the micro-size particles of GIC for the bonding mechanism and the ratio and proportions of nano-HAp to the GIC needs further elucidation...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} the tensile bond strength of three one step self-etch adhesives: Adper easy Bond, G-Bond, Tetric N bond self etch to dentin which contained ethanol and water, acetone {{and water and}} only water as a solvent respectively. Materials and Methods: Freshly extracted intact sixty permanent molars were collected for the study. To standardize the depth of cavity, 1. 5 mm hole was drilled in the deepest part of the central fossa. All the teeth were ground and polished to expose the flat dentinal surface. All the teeth were embedded in the autopolymerising acrylic resin in separate moulds and were divided into three equal groups of twenty teeth each. Group 1 : Twenty samples restored with composite and Adper easy one as bonding agent. Group 2 : Twenty samples restored with composite and G-Bond as bonding agent. Group 3 : Twenty samples restored with composite and Tetric N Bond as bonding agent. A wire loop was placed over the predesigned locationin the composite held with the <b>split</b> brass <b>mold.</b> Tensile loading was done using UTM and statistical analysis was done using one step ANOVA and Tukey's HSD test. Results: The mean bond strengths of ethanol containing, acetone containing and water containing adhesives were 12. 57 MPa, 10. 16 MPa and 11. 46 MPa. Conclusion: Comparison of contemporary adhesives in this ex-vivo study revealed that in self-etch adhesives, the type of solvent {{may be one of}} the factors that affects the bond strength. The adhesives containing ethanol based solvent showed better bonding than acetone and water based self etch adhesives...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aim: The bonding {{mechanisms}} of self etching primers, {{based upon the}} simultaneous etching and priming of dentin, simplifies the bonding technique, but the efficiency of these systems is still controversial. This study compared the shear bond strength of three self etch adhesive systems in dry and wet conditions. Materials and Method: In this experimental study, 77 intact bovine lower incisors with flat 600 grit sanded enamel surface were fixed in acrylic molds and divided into 7 groups, of 11 teeth. The enamel surfaces were treated according to a special procedure as follows: Group 1 : Prompt L-Pop (PLP) in dry condition, Group 2 : Prompt L-Pop in wet condition, Group 3 : Clearfield SE Bond (CSEB) in dry condition, Group 4 : Clearfield SE Bond in wet condition, Group 5 : iBond (iB) in dry condition, Group 6 : iBond in wet condition, Group 7 : Margin Bond (Control) in dry condition. Surfaces were air dried for ten seconds, or blot dried in wet condition. Composite resin was bonded on the enamel and built up by applying a cylindric teflon <b>split</b> <b>mold</b> (4 mm height 2 mm diameter). After 24 hours storage in dionized water at room temperature, all specimens were thermocycled and shear bond test was employed by a universal testing machine (Instron) with a cross-head speed of 1 mm/min. The shear bond strength was recorded in MPa and data were analyzed with ANOVA and Scheffe statistical tests. P< 0. 05 was considered as statistically significant. The mode of failure was examined under a stereomicroscope. Results: 1 - Shear bond strength of CSEB in dry condition (21. 5 ± 4. 8 MPa) {{was significantly higher than}} PLP and iB groups (p< 0. 0001). 2 - Shear bond strength of iB and PLP groups in dry condition (9. 60 ± 2. 2, 9. 49 ± 3 MPa) were significantly lower than CSEB and control (2. 99 ± 5. 1 MPa) (P< 0. 0001). 3 - There {{was no significant difference between}} PLP and iB groups in dry condition (P= 1). 4 - Shear bond strength of CSEB in wet condition (21. 8 ± 3 MPa) was significantly higher than PLP and iB groups (P= 0. 0). 5 - Shear bond strength of CSEB (10. 8 ± 3 MPa) and PLP (10. 6 ± 4 MPa) in wet condition were significantly lower than CSEB and Control groups (P= 0. 0). 6 - There was no significant difference between PLP and iB groups in wet condition (P= 0. 99). 7 - Shear bond strength of the three adhesives had no significant difference in dry and wet conditions (PLP: P= 0. 53, CSEB: P= 0. 84, iB: P= 0. 53). The mode of failure in two groups of PLP and two groups of iB was predominantly in the adhesive bond and in the two groups of CSEB, mixed failure (adhesive with cohesive in composite) was predominantly observed. Conclusion: CSEB had higher while iB and PLP showed lower bond strength to ground enamel. The three self-etch adhesives in this study did not show technique sensitivity to wet and dry enamel...|$|E

Foi avaliada também a resistência ao cisalhamento de corpos-de-prova reembasados com a resina L. Para cada material, 48 corpos-de-prova (50 mm diâmetro x 0. 5 mm espessura) foram preparados, seguindo-se as recomendações dos fabricantes, utilizando-se uma matriz metálica circular com pontos de referência (A, B, C e D). Um projetor de perfil Nikon foi utilizado para mensurar a distância entre os pontos de referências (AB e CD) na matriz metálica e nos corpos-de-prova. Os corpos-de-prova foram divididos em 6 grupos (n= 8) e as mensurações foram realizadas após as seguintes condições experimentais: G 1 - 2 ciclos de desinfecção química (corpos-de-prova imersos em solução de perborato de sódio a 3, 8 % aquecida a 50 º C por 10 minutos); G 2 - 2 ciclos de desinfecção com microondas (corpos-de-prova imersos em 200 mL de água e irradiados com 650 W por 6 minutos); G 3 - 7 ciclos de desinfecção química; G 4 - 7 ciclos de desinfecção com microondas; C 1 - grupo controle 1 - após a polimerização para as resinas de reembasamento e após imersão em água a 37 ° C por 48 + 2 horas para a resina de base; C 2 - grupo controle 2 - corpos-de-prova imersos em água a 37 ° C por 7 dias.

40|$|O presente estudo avaliou a influência das dimensões e das formas de fotoativação do corpo de prova através dos testes de sorção, de solubilidade e de microdureza Knoop. Este trabalho foi dividido em duas fases. Na primeira fase, corpos de prova de um compósito {{experimental}} medindo 15 mm de diâmetro x 1 mm de espessura foram confeccionados usando uma matriz de teflon bipartida, sendo o compósito inserido em um único incremento e, em seguida, planificado por uma tira de poliéster aderida a uma placa de vidro. Todos os grupos tiveram as mesmas dimensões, porém, foram fotopolimerizados de três maneiras diferentes: G 1 - Com cinco exposições de cada lado do corpo de prova, de acordo com o padrão especificado pela ISO 4049; G 2 - Retirando a ponta do aparelho fotoativador de forma que a luz atingisse toda a superfície do espécime e G 3 - Distanciando a ponta do fotopolimerizador 1, 5 cm com o mesmo intuito (n= 5). Anova (p< 0, 05) e teste de Tukey 5 % para diferenciação das médias não mostraram diferenças estatísticas significativas entre os grupos para o teste de sorção (p= 0, 517). Os valores em g/mm 3 com seus desvios padrão foram: G 1 = 22, 58 ± 1, 20; G 2 = 23, 51 ± 0, 61 e G 3 = 22, 16 ± 1, 39. Já para o teste de solubilidade foram encontradas diferenças estatísticas significativas (p= 0, 002), de acordo com as letras sobrescritas. Os valores em g/mm 3 com seus respectivos desvios padrão foram G 1 = 0, 54 ± 0, 14 B; G 2 = 0, 37 ± 0, 14 B e G 3 = 1, 04 ± 0, 09 A. Para o teste de microdureza Knoop, a análise estatística apresentou diferenças significativas entre os grupos (p= 0, 003). Os valores em KHN com seus desvios padrão foram G 1 = 78, 9 ± 2, 74 A; G 2 = 69, 4 ± 4, 77 B e G 3 = 67, 4 ± 4, 94 B. A conclusão desta primeira fase foi que a melhor forma de fotoativação foi do G 1 (de acordo com a ISO), a qual apresentou menor solubilidade e a maior microdureza Knoop. A segunda fase do trabalho foi feita utilizando apenas a melhor forma de fotoativação obtida na primeira fase que foi correspondente ao G 1 (ISO 4049), variando as dimensões dos corpos de prova com os tamanhos mais usados na literatura de sorção e solubilidade. Os grupos experimentais foram divididos em: (diametro x espessura) g 1 = 15 x 1 mm (ISO), g 2 = 5, 8 x 0, 8 mm e g 3 = 6 x 0, 5 mm, confeccionados da mesma forma que os corpos de prova da primeira etapa. Os espécimes foram então submetidos ao teste de sorção, de solubilidade e de microdureza Knoop. ANOVA (p< 0, 05) e teste de Tukey (5 %) mostraram que não houve diferenças estatisticamente significativas para o teste de sorção (p= 0, 915). Os valores em g/mm 3 com seus respectivos desvios padrão foram: g 1 = 22, 58 ± 1, 2; g 2 = 22, 28 ± 2, 26 e g 3 = 22, 78 ± 2, 02. Já para o teste de solubilidade foram encontradas diferenças estatísticas significativas (p= 0, 006). Os valores em g/mm 3 com seus respectivos desvios padrão foram: g 1 = 0, 54 ± 0, 14 B; g 2 = 3, 2 ± 2, 07 A, e g 3 = 2, 16 ± 1, 06 AB. O teste de microdureza Knoop não demonstrou diferenças estatisticamente significativas entre os grupos (p= 0, 106). Os valores em KHN, com seus respectivos desvios padrão foram: g 1 = 62, 12 ± 0, 86; g 2 = 64, 88 ± 4, 21 e g 3 = 66, 20 ± 2, 33. Levando em consideração os diversos fatores estudados pode-se concluir que as dimensões e a forma de fotoativação preconizadas pela ISO 4049 parecem ser a melhor forma de confeccionar os corpos de prova para os testes de sorção e de solubilidade, associados ao teste de microdureza Knoop. This study {{evaluated the}} influence of the dimensions and the light-cure mode of specimens in the tests of sorption, solubility and Knoop microhardness. This research was divided into two phases. In the first stage, disc shaped samples of an experimental composite resin (15 mm in diameter x 1 mm in thickness) were fabricated using a teflon <b>split</b> <b>mold.,</b> The composite was inserted in one increment and then flattened by a polyester strip adhered to a glass plate. All groups had the same dimensions, however, were polymerized in three different ways: G 1 -five exposures for each side of the specimen, according to the standard specified by ISO 4049, G 2 -removing the tip of the curing unit and allowing light to reach all the surface of the specimen, and G 3 -distancing the tip of the curing unit 1. 5 cm with the same intention (n= 5). Anova and Tukey test (p< 0. 05) for the means comparisons showed no statistically significant differences among groups for the sorption test (p= 0. 517). The values in g/mm 3 with their standard deviation were: G 1 = 22. 58 ± 1. 20, G 2 = 23. 51 ± 0. 61 and G 3 = 22. 16 ± 1. 39. The solubility test showed statistically significant differences (p= 0. 002), according to the superscript letters. The values in g/mm 3 with their respective standard deviations were G 1 = 0. 54 ± 0. 14 B, G 2 = 0. 37 ± 0. 14 B and G 3 = 1. 04 ± 0. 09 A. For the microhardness test, statistical analysis showed significant differences among groups (p= 0. 003). The KHN values with their standard deviation were: G 1 = 78. 9 ± 2. 74 A, G 2 = 69. 4 ± 4. 77 B and G 3 = 67. 4 ± 4. 94 B. The conclusion of this first phase was that the best way of light-curing was G 1 (according to ISO), which showed lower solubility and the higher Knoop microhardness. The second research stage was performed using only the best way of light-curing achieved in the first round, which was corresponding to Group 1 (ISO 4049), varying the dimensions of the specimens with the sizes most used in the literature of sorption and solubility. The experimental groups were divided into: (Diameter x thickness) g 1 = 15 x 1 mm (ISO), g 2 = 5. 8 x 0. 8 mm and g 3 = 6 x 0. 5 mm, prepared {{in the same way as}} the samples of the first phase. The specimens were then submitted to the sorption, solubility and Knoop microhardness tests. ANOVA and Tukey test (p< 0. 05) showed no statistically significant differences for the sorption test (p= 0. 915). The values in g/mm 3 with their respective standard deviations were: g 1 = 22. 58 ± 1. 2; g 2 = 22. 28 ± 2. 26 and g 3 = 22. 78 ± 2. 02. The solubility test showed statistically differences among groups (p= 0. 006). The values in g/mm 3 with their respective standard deviations were: g 1 = 0. 54 ± 0. 14 B, g 2 = 3. 2 ± 2. 07 A, and g 3 = 2. 16 ± 1. 06 AB. The Knoop microhardness test showed no statistically significant differences among groups (p= 0. 106). The values in KHN with their respective standard deviations were: g 1 = 62. 12 ± 0. 86, g 2 = 64. 88 ± 4. 21 and g 3 = 66. 20 ± 2. 33. Taking into consideration the studied factors, it can be concluded that the size and the shape of photoactivation recommended by ISO 4049 seems to be the best way of preparing the specimens for sorption and solubility tests, associated with the Knoop microhardness test...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{study was}} {{conducted}} with the aim of comparing the shear bond strength (SBS) and microleakage of Tetric N-Bond, G-bond, and Xeno V (seventh generation dentin adhesives) in primary anterior teeth. Materials and Methods: For the shear bond strength, 45 teeth were randomly divided in to three groups namely group A, B, C (n = 15). Samples were mounted horizontally on acrylic block exposing the facial surface and bonded with different adhesives according to manufacturer instructions. A <b>split</b> Teflon <b>mold</b> was used to build the composite resin cylinder and light cured. Shear bond strength was tested using a universal testing machine. The values were statistically analysed. For microleakage, another 45 teeth were similarly grouped. Two class V cavities were prepared on the labial surface and treated with different dentine bonding agents and restored with resin composite (Ivoclar vivadent) A 2 shade. The restorations were subsequently thermally stressed for 200 cycles and were subjected to dye penetration test, followed by sectioning {{through the center of the}} restoration labiolingually. Each section was examined using stereomicroscope at × 40 magnification to asses dye penetration at the margins of the restoration. Results: The SBS varied between 22. 12 - 23. 77 N/mm 2 (P-value = 0. 231). The microleakage scores varied between 0. 6 - 1. 2 (P-value = 0. 03; Post-hoc test A vs B (0. 007)). There was a statistically higher degree of microleakage observed in group A when compared to group B.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to compare the microleakage of composite resin (Z- 100) and shear bond strength to bovine dentin using different types of adhesive systems (Scotch Bond Multi-Purpose, All Bond 2, One-Step, and Perma Quick) to compare and correlate microleakage to shear bond strength. For the microleakage aspect of the study, 20 class V were prepared (bovine incisors) with 90 -degree cavosurface margins and were located at the cement-enamel junction using a template. Each dentin bonding system was applied to five cavities following the manufacturers’ instructions and restored with Z- 100 composite resin. After 24 hours of storage in distilled water at 37 oC, the teeth were immersed in 2 % basic fuchsin dye. All teeth were sectioned in a mesiodistal direction using a diamond saw, and each section was inspected under a stereomicroscope. For the shear bond strength aspect of the study, 20 bovine incisors were centrally horizontally mounted in Teflon mold with cold cure acrylic resin. Flat labial dentin surfaces were prepared using different grit silicon carbide abrasive wheels. Five specimens were used for each of the bonding agent systems. Each specimen was bonded with restorative composite resin (Z- 100) and applied to the treated dentinal surface through a <b>split</b> Teflon <b>mold.</b> All specimens were stored in distilled water at 37 oC for 24 hours. The bonds were stressed using shear forces at a crosshead speed of 0. 5 mm/min using an Instron Universal testing machine. Findings indicate none of the systems tested in this study were free from microleakage. Scotch bond multi-purpose achieved the best seal, with One-Step being second best, while All-Bond 2 and Perma Quick had the poorest seal. However, there were significant differences among the shear bond strengths of the four bonding systems tested. Scotch Bond Multi-Purpose has a higher bond strength to composite resin when compared to the other dentin adhesives. The study also concluded there is no association between microleakage and shear bond strength. King Saud Universit...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} the hardness versus depth profile of several polyacid-modified composite resins (PAM-Cs) {{as a function}} of shade (A 2, A 4) and compare the depth of cure (DoC) based on these profiles with that previously obtained with the scraping and penetrometer methods. Method and Materials: Samples of 6 PAM-Cs (Hytac, 3 M FSPE; F 2000, 3 M ESPE; Glasiosite, Voco; Dyract, Dentsply DeTrey; Dyract AP Dentsply DeTrey; Compoglass F, Vivadent) and 3 composite resins (Herculite Enamel XRV, Kerr; Z 100, 3 M ESPE; Durafill VS, Heraeus Kulzer) with shades A 2 and A 4 were light-cured in bulk in <b>split</b> stainless steel <b>molds</b> (thickness ranging from 0. 5 to 3. 5 mm in steps of 0. 5 mm). The Knoop hardness of the irradiated top (KHNsurface) and nonirradiated bottom (KHNbottom) surfaces was determined {{as a function of}} sample thickness using a microhardness tester. Results: Regression analysis demonstrated that for a given material, KHNbottom equals KHNsurface up to a specific depth (= DoC) depending on the material and shade and then decreases linearly with increasing depth. The decrease of the KHN per unit depth differs significantly among materials and shades. According to a regression analysis. the scraping and penetrometer methods overestimate the Doc of PAM-Cs compared to the method based on the change of the hardness indentation with depth. Conclusions: Shade A 2 results in greater values of Doc than shade A 4, the effect depending quantitatively on the formulation of the material. Some formulations of PAM-Cs do not reach a Doc of 2 mm, a layer recommended to be applied In the incremental technique. The Doc as determined according to ISO 4049 : 2000 apparently is based on a lower degree of polymerization cor responding to a KHN of 80 % of the irradiated surface...|$|R
