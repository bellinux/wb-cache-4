The dissipation of the acoustic energy in a porous material due to viscous and thermal losses inside the pores is enhanced by the low frequency resonances of the inclusions and energy trapping between the inclusion and the rigid backing.

40|$|Summary. This {{contribution}} {{concerns the}} construction of meshless Lagrangian particle methods for the numerical simulation of multiscale phenomena in linear transport problems, where mass conservative discretization methods are essentially required. The proposed discretization scheme works with a finite set of unstructured nodes, each corresponding to one flow particle. In this method, corresponding particle average values are maintained during the simulation. The discrete nodes are subject to adaptive modifications, leading to semi-Lagrangian particle simulations, whose adaption rules rely on the insertion (refinement) and removal (coarsening) of the nodes at each time step. The resulting meshless particle method is mass conservative by construction. The required algebraic rules for the downstream particle advection and the local redistribution of the particle masses are developed. Moreover, the implementation of boundary conditions is addressed. The efficacy of the proposed conservative and meshless adaptive particle method is finally shown by using one numerical simulation concerning the <b>slotted</b> <b>cylinder,</b> a popular standard test case for passive advection. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{research}} {{excitation system}} was test flown at the NASA Dryden Flight Research Facility on the two-seat F- 16 XL aircraft. The excitation {{system is a}} wingtip-mounted vane with a rotating <b>slotted</b> <b>cylinder</b> at the trailing edge. As the cylinder rotates during flight, the flow is alternately deflected upward and downward through the slot, resulting in a periodic lift force at twice the cylinder's rotational frequency. Flight testing was conducted to determine the excitation system's effectiveness in the subsonic and transonic flight regimes. Primary research objectives were to determine the system's ability to develop adequate force levels to excite the aircraft's structure and to determine the frequency range over which the system could excite structural modes of the aircraft. The results from the exciter were compared with results from atmospheric turbulence excitation at the same flight conditions. The results from the forced excitation were of higher quality and had less variation than the results from atmospheric turbulence. The forced excitation data also invariably yielded higher structural damping values than those from the atmospheric turbulence data...|$|R
5000|$|The {{diaphone}} horn {{was based}} {{directly on the}} organ stop {{of the same name}} invented by Robert Hope-Jones, creator of the Wurlitzer organ. Hope-Jones' design was based on a piston that was closed only at its bottom end and had slots, perpendicular to its axis, cut through its sides; the slotted piston moved within a similarly <b>slotted</b> <b>cylinder.</b> Outside of the cylinder was a reservoir of high-pressure air. Initially, high-pressure air would be admitted behind the piston, pushing it forward. When the slots of the piston aligned with those of the cylinder, air passed into the piston, making a sound and pushing the piston back to its starting position, whence the cycle would repeat. [...] A modification of Hope-Jones' design was patented by John Pell Northey, head of the Northey Co. Ltd. of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, which manufactured pumps and small gasoline engines. [...] Northey added a secondary compressed air supply to the piston in order to power it during both its forward and reverse strokes and thus create an even more powerful sound. The entire horn apparatus was driven by a compressor.|$|R
40|$|Submerged {{submarine}} communications {{above 200}} MHz {{require the use}} of retractable mast antennas to transmit or receive intelligence. For a vessel situated in hostile coastal waters, such action may give away its presence and compromise its intended mission. In order to help maintain stealth while exchanging data, a low-profile antenna which can be deployed from the submerged vessel and towed on the ocean surface behind it is needed to mitigate the detection problem posed by the retractable antenna mast. ^ In this thesis the characteristics of a <b>slotted</b> <b>cylinder</b> antenna, which have been experimentally observed to operate satisfactorily in the ocean environment while towed, were studied. The investigation focused on the conditions under which the antenna operated optimally in regard to its input impedance bandwidth and gain; that end was achieved through a parametric study to yield a device with the desired characteristics. Quantities such as the length-to-diameter ratio, slot width as well as the end-terminations of the slot were studied to note the trends leading to the satisfactory design. Comparisons between finite-element computations and experimental results were made throughout the frequency range of interest, which spanned from 200 MHz to 1 GHz. ...|$|R

40|$|A spherical 2 D {{adaptive}} mesh refinement (AMR) {{technique is}} applied to the so-called Linâ€“Rood advection algorithm, which is built upon a conservative and oscillation-free finite-volume discretization in flux form. The AMR design is based on two modules: a block-structured data layout and a spherical AMR grid library for parallel computer architectures. The latter defines and manages the adaptive blocks in spherical geometry, provides user interfaces for interpolation routines, and supports the communication and loadbalancing aspects for parallel applications. The adaptive grid simulations are guided by user-defined adaptation criteria. Both statically and dynamically adaptive setups that start from a regular block-structured latitudeâ€“longitude grid are supported. All blocks are logically rectangular, self-similar, and independent data units that are split into four in the event of refinement requests, thereby doubling the horizontal resolution. Grid coarsenings reverse this refinement principle. Refinement and coarsening levels are constrained so that there is a uniform 2 : 1 mesh ratio at all fineâ€“coarse-grid interfaces. The adaptive advection model is tested using three standard advection tests with increasing complexity. These include the transport of a cosine bell around the sphere, the advection of a <b>slotted</b> <b>cylinder,</b> and a smooth deformational flow that describes the roll-up of two vortices. The latter two examples exhibit very sharp edges and gradients tha...|$|R

The rotation tests {{have been designed}} to test and compare the advection schemes for different spatial and temporal resolutions in different chemical conditions (rural and urban) and for different shapes (cone and <b>slotted</b> <b>cylinder)</b> giving the advection schemes different challenges with respect to relatively slow or fast chemistry and smooth or sharp gradients, respectively. In every test, error measures have been calculated and used for ranking of the advection schemes with respect to performance, i. e. lowest overall errors for all chemical species. Furthermore, the HEL and SL schemes have been compared in a shallow water model, demonstrating the performance in a more realistic non-linear deformation flow. The results in this paper show that the new advection scheme, HEL, by far outperforms both the Eulerian and semi-Lagrangian schemes with very low error estimates compared to the two other schemes. Although no analytic solution can be obtained for the performance in the non-linear shallow water model flow, the tracer distribution appears realistic as compared to LMCSL when a mixing between local parcel concentrations is introduced in HEL...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the perturbation of the radiation pattern of a <b>slotted</b> <b>cylinder</b> antenna due to the presence of one or more obstacles on the conducting cylinder. The obstacles of particular concern are one or more long axial conducting columns whose height is small compared to a wavelength. The study, incorporating three different methods as outlined below, was specifically used as a partial evaluation of the radiation pattern of a microstrip antenna array mounted on the Plasma Diagnostics Package (PDP) satellite. (1) An analytical approach to evaluate the near and far-field enabled us to determine the sensitivity of the far-field pattern with respect to the positioning of these axial columns around the cylinder. It also provided the fields needed to evaluate the currents induced on the columns. (2) An experimental investigation was conducted on a half-size scale model of the PDP to verify the analytical method. This was done inside a microwave anechoic chamber. (3) A numerical method was the third approach used to analyze this problem. The NEC (Numerical Electromagnetic Code Method of Moments) was modified for application to this radiating structure, and the resulting computer program was utilized in predicting the effect of the axial columns on the far-field pattern;The results of all three methods provide the same conclusions about the influence of the columns on the far-field pattern.

40|$|Various semi-Lagrangian {{methods are}} tested {{with respect to}} {{advection}} in air pollution modeling. The aim {{is to find a}} method fulfilling as many of the desirable properties by Rasch and Williamson (1990) and Machenhauer et al. (2008) as possible. The focus in this study is on accuracy and local mass conservation. The methods tested are, first, classical semi-Lagrangian cubic interpolation, see e. g. Durran (1999), second, semi-Lagrangian cubic cascade interpolation, by Nair et al. (2002), third, semi-Lagrangian cubic interpolation with the modified interpolation weights, Locally Mass Conserving Semi-Lagrangian (LMCSL), by Kaas (2008), and last, semi-Lagrangian cubic interpolation with a locally mass conserving monotonic filter byKaas and Nielsen (2009). Semi-Lagrangian (SL) interpolation is a classical method for atmospheric modeling, cascade interpolation is more efficient computationally, modified interpolation weights assure mass conservation and the locally mass conserving monotonic filter imposes monotonicity. All schemes are tested with advection alone or with advection and chemistry together under both typical rural and urban conditions using different temporal and spatial resolution. The methods are compared with a current state-of-the-art scheme, Accurate Space Derivatives (ASD), see Frohn et al. (2002), presently used at the National Environmental Research Institute (NERI) in Denmark. To enable a consistent comparison only non-divergent flow configurations are tested. The test cases are based either on the traditional <b>slotted</b> <b>cylinder</b> or the rotating cone, where the schemes' ability to model both steep gradients and slopes are challenged. The tests showed that the locally mass conserving monotonic filter improved the results significantly for some of the test cases, however, not for all.

40|$|Wastewater {{contains}} large solids {{and grit}} that {{can interfere with}} treatment processes or cause undue mechanical wear and increased maintenance on wastewater treatment equipment. To minimize potential problems, these materials require separate handling. Preliminary treatment removes these constituents from the influent wastewater. Preliminary treatment consists of screening, grit removal, septage handling, odor control, and flow equalization. This fact sheet discusses screening and grit removal. Screening Screening is the first unit operation used at wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Screening removes objects such as rags, paper, plastics, and metals to prevent damage and clogging of downstream equipment, piping, and appurtenances. Some modern wastewater treatment plants use both coarse screens and fine screens. Figure 1 depicts a typical bar screen (a type of coarse screen). Coarse Screens Coarse screens remove large solids, rags, and debris from wastewater, and typically have openings of 6 mm (0. 25 in) or larger. Types of coarse screens include mechanically and manually cleaned bar screens, including trash racks. Table 1 describes {{the various types of}} coarse screens. Fine Screens Fine screens are typically used to remove material that may create operation and maintenance problems in downstream processes, particularly in systems that lack primary treatment. Typical opening sizes for fine screens are 1. 5 to 6 mm (0. 06 to 0. 25 in). Very fine screens with openings of 0. 2 to 1. 5 mm (0. 01 to 0. 06 in) placed after coarse or fine screens can reduce suspended solids to levels near those achieved by primary clarification. Comminutors and Grinders Processing coarse solids reduces their size so they can be removed during downstream treatment operations, such as primary clarification, where both floating and settleable solids are removed. Comminuting and grinding devices are installed in the wastewater flow channel to grind and shred material up to 6 to 19 mm (0. 25 to 0. 75 in) in size. Comminutors consist of a rotating <b>slotted</b> <b>cylinder</b> through which wastewater flow passes.
