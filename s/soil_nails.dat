50|$|In {{terms of}} construction, <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> walls have a decisive {{advantage}} over other alternatives. <b>Soil</b> <b>nail</b> walls require a smaller right-of-way than ground anchor walls and have less environmental impact. Installation of <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> walls is relatively rapid and typically uses less materials and smaller construction equipment than ground anchor walls.|$|R
50|$|Shotcrete {{reinforcement}} {{and ground}} support is utilized at the tunnel portals {{and in the}} interior of the wine caves. At the portals, soil nail and shotcrete walls are typically used for permanent support and are constructed from the top down in lifts. <b>Soil</b> <b>nails</b> are installed 4 to 6 ft (1.2 to 1.8 m) apart in the horizontal and vertical directions. The shotcrete is typically a minimum of 6 inches (15 cm) thick and reinforced with welded wire fabric. The typical 4,000 psi (28 MPa) design strength mix is applied using the wet process.|$|E
50|$|Four {{main points}} to be {{considered}} in determining if soil nailing would be an effective retention technique are as follows. First, the existing ground conditions should be examined. Next, the advantages and disadvantages for a soil nail wall should be assessed for the particular application being considered. Then other systems should be considered for the particular application. Finally, cost of the soil nail wall should be considered. Soil nail walls can be used for a variety of soil types and conditions. The most favorable conditions for soil nailing are as follows: The soil should be able to stand unsupported one to two meters high for a minimum of two days when cut vertical or nearly vertical. Also all <b>soil</b> <b>nails</b> within a cross section should be located above the groundwater table. If the <b>soil</b> <b>nails</b> are not located above the groundwater table, the groundwater should not negatively affect the face of the excavation, the bond between the ground and the soil nail itself. Based upon these favorable conditions for soil nailing stiff to hard fine-grained soils which include stiff to hard clays, clayey silts, silty clays, sandy clays, and sandy silts are preferred soils. Sand and gravels which are dense to very dense soils with some apparent cohesion also work well for soil nailing. Weathered rock is also acceptable as long as the rock is weathered evenly throughout (meaning no weakness planes). Finally, glacial soils work well for soil nailing.|$|E
50|$|The first {{application}} of soil nailing was implemented in 1972 for a railroad widening project near Versailles, France. <b>Soil</b> <b>nails</b> {{were used to}} stabilize an 18 m high slope consisting of sandy soil. This method {{proved to be more}} cost-effective, {{while at the same time}} cut down the construction time when compared to other conventional support methods. Germany was the next country to investigate soil nailing. From 1975 to 1981 the University of Karlsruhe and the construction company Bauer collaborated to establish a research program. This program conducted full scale testing of experimental walls with different configurations and developed analysis procedures for use in design. The United States first used soil nailing in 1976 for the support of a 13.7 m deep foundation excavation in dense silty sands. Soil nailing was implemented in the expansion of The Good Samaritan Hospital in Portland, Oregon. This retaining system was produced in approximately half the time at about 85% of the cost of conventional retaining systems.|$|E
50|$|Initial design {{considerations}} include wall layout (wall height and length), <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> {{vertical and horizontal}} spacing, <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> pattern on wall face, <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> inclination, <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> length and distribution, <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> material and relevant ground properties. With all these variables {{in the mind of}} the design engineer the next step is to use simplified charts to preliminarily evaluate nail length and maximum nail force. Nail length, diameter and spacing typically control external and internal stability of the wall. These parameters can be adjusted during design until all external and internal stability requirements are met. After the initial design is completed, final design progresses where the <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> wall has to be tested for external and internal failure modes, seismic considerations and aesthetic qualities. Drainage, frost penetration and external loads such as wind and hydrostatic forces also have to be determined and included in the final examination of the design. <b>Soil</b> <b>nail</b> walls are not ideal in locations with highly plastic clay soils. Soils with high plasticity, a high liquid limit and low undrained shear strengths are at risk of long-term deformation (creep).|$|R
40|$|Pull-out {{strength}} of a <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> is an important parameter {{in the design of}} a <b>soil</b> <b>nailing</b> system. The pull-out strength is determined by the normal stress acting on the <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> surface during pull-out. The variation of normal stress in soil surrounding a drill-and-grout <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> during drilling, grouting and pull-out is studied through both laboratory pull-out tests and numerical simulation. It is found that for a drill-and-grout <b>soil</b> <b>nail,</b> most of the normal stress in the soil surrounding the hole is released after drilling. For a <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> grouted under low pressure, the normal stress does not substantially recover after the nail is installed. During pull-out, the normal stress acting on the nail increases with the increase in pull-out distance because of the constrained dilatancy of the <b>soil</b> surrounding the <b>nail,</b> which eventually increases the pull-out resistance. It is indicated that the dilatancy of the soil is very important to a drill-and-grout <b>soil</b> <b>nail.</b> For <b>soils</b> with low dilatancy, further measures, such as high pressure grouting should be employed to compensate the released stress during drilling.

50|$|Inspection {{activities}} play a {{vital role}} in the production of high-quality soil nail walls because conformance to project plans and specifications should result in a soil nail wall that will perform its intended duty for its designed duration. Inspections usually involve evaluation of the following: conformance of system components to material specification, conformance of construction methods to execution specifications, conformance to short-term performance specifications, and long-term monitoring. Short-term performance specifications are checked with loads tests, which utilize hydraulic jacks and pumps to perform several load applications. Three common load tests for short-term performance are verification or ultimate load tests, proof tests and creep tests. Verification or ultimate load tests are conducted to verify the compliance of the <b>soil</b> <b>nails</b> with pullout capacity and strengths resulting from the contractor's installation method. Proof tests are intended to verify that the contractor's construction procedure has been consistent and that the nails have not been drilled and grouted in a soil zone not tested in the verification stage. Creep tests are performed to ensure that the nail design loads can be safely carried throughout the structure's service life.|$|E
50|$|With {{the design}} complete, {{construction}} {{is the next}} step. Most soil nail wall construction follows a specific procedure. First a cut is excavated and temporary bracing is put in place if necessary. This is done with conventional earth moving equipment and hydraulic drills. Next, holes for the <b>soil</b> <b>nails</b> are drilled at predetermined locations as specified by the design engineer. The equipment used for this step {{is dependent on the}} stability of the material in which the soil nail wall is supporting. Rotary or rotary percussive methods using air flush or dry auger methods can be used with stable ground. For unstable ground, single tube and duplex rotary methods with air and water flush or hollow stem auger methods are used. With the holes drilled, {{the next step is to}} install and grout the nails into place. After all nails are inserted, a drainage system is put into place. Synthetic drainage mat is placed vertically between the nail heads, which are extended down to the base of the wall where they are most commonly connected to a footing drain. A layer of shotcrete is applied and bearing plates are installed before a final facing is put in place to complete the soil nail wall. Variations of the steps described above may be necessary to accommodate additional preparation tasks or supplementary activities for specific project conditions.|$|E

40|$|Finite {{difference}} {{analyses were}} conducted to explore the possible behaviour of <b>soil</b> <b>nails</b> in loose fill slopes which were formed by strain-softening materials. Numerical models simulating a 20 m high 35 degrees loose fill slope were set up. With the use of an undrained strain-softening soil model, the behaviour of a loose fill slope reinforced with <b>soil</b> <b>nails</b> subjected to rainfall infiltration was studied. Results indicated that <b>soil</b> <b>nails</b> together with a proper facing structure may reduce the deformation of a loose fill slope caused by rainfall infiltration and hence maintain the stability of the slope. Tensile forces in the <b>soil</b> <b>nails</b> were mobilised through the effective connections between the facing structure and the nail heads when a potential slide was being initiated. Through this mechanism, the development of a flow slide at shallow depths could be avoided by the pull out resistance between the soil and the nails at deeper locations of the slope.

40|$|The pullout {{behaviour}} of cement-grouted <b>soil</b> <b>nails,</b> {{particularly in}} field conditions, {{is not yet}} fully understood. In this study, {{a series of tests}} was conducted to evaluate the pullout response of grouted <b>soil</b> <b>nails</b> in a field slope.

30|$|<b>Soil</b> <b>nailing</b> is {{a method}} in which soil slopes, {{excavations}} or retaining wall are passively reinforced by the insertion of relatively slender elements-normally steel reinforcing bars [1].

The fundamental concept of <b>soil</b> <b>nailing</b> relies upon two possible mechanisms, both of which donating to improve stability of soil mass: the transfer of tensile forces generated in the nails through frictional interaction between the ground and the <b>soil</b> <b>nail,</b> and the development of shear stress and bending stiffness in the nails as a result of deformation of soil mass [2]. In the accumulation to the aforementioned mechanisms, the soil structure interaction between the facing and the soil helps to restrain displacement, limit decompression during and after excavation, and produce nail head load at the connection between the nail and the facing necessary to develop the force along the nail. The long term performance of <b>soil</b> <b>nailed</b> excavations is a major unknown to those designing the <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> systems because there are very few over 20  years old [3].|$|R
