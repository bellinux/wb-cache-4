2500|$|During the Workshop Round of Season 4 and Season 5, many contestants said [...] "Saya sudah berusaha.." [...] ("At least I have tried...") or [...] "Apabila saya diberi kesempatan untuk minggu depan, saya akan ..." [...] ("If {{people give}} me the chance to <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> another week, I will...") when they {{received}} negative feedbacks from the panels. This stirred up some rumors among fans {{that it might have}} been scripted.|$|E
2500|$|The club's board {{indicated}} that they were losing money due to the facilities at the County Ground not generating enough income to keep the club afloat. Swindon director Bob Holt issued a statement to the town stating: [...] "Please, please come to the games. We know it's expensive, but you have to if you want football in Swindon." [...] Earlier in the season the club had announced its new proposal to redevelop the County Ground, a plan which received the backing of the local council who own the land. Chief Executive Bob Holt commented: [...] "We have been at the County Ground for over 100 years and it is only appropriate that we should explore every opportunity to <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> another 100 years." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} {{was featured in}} various other storylines, including a feud with Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp); a tug-of-love for Ricky's affections with his first wife Sam Mitchell (Danniella Westbrook); a one-night stand with Lenny Wallace (Des Coleman), causing a sexually transmitted disease scare; {{and the death of}} her best friend Tiffany Mitchell (Martine McCutcheon). In November 1998, the BBC announced that Patsy Palmer had decided to leave EastEnders {{to spend more time with}} her family. The BBC said that Bianca would not be killed off, and a spokesman commented: [...] "Bianca has always been an amazingly powerful character and the door is open to her if she wants to return in the future. She has been fantastic in the years she has been in EastEnders and we will miss her." [...] Palmer was one of several high-profile EastEnders stars to announce their departures that year; McCutcheon and Kemp also decided to leave, and Gillian Taylforth left the serial in 1998 after 13 years playing Kathy Beale. The BBC said, [...] "no-one is bigger than the show, which is doing extremely well at the moment. We will send her off with all our very best wishes." [...] Richard Stokes, EastEnders series editor and producer of Palmer's exit storyline commented, [...] "you don't expect people to <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> ever. But it's a double-edged sword. Yes, it's a shame when a well-loved character announces they're going, but the flipside is that it provides us with the space to do the best possible story. If someone is going, you can up the stakes. The whole of Bianca's story was developed once we knew she was going to go." ...|$|E
