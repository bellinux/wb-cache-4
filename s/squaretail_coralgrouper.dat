40|$|Seed {{industry}} {{innovation and}} industrialization of Fujian Province of ChinaThe complete mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) sequence of <b>squaretail</b> <b>coralgrouper</b> Plectropomus areolatus was determined with long PCR approach. The genome was 16, 770 bp {{in length and}} contained 13 protein-coding genes, 22 transfer RNAs (tRNAs), 2 ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), and 2 non-coding regions, with the gene content and order being similar to most other teleosts. The overall base composition of the mitogenome {{was estimated to be}} 28. 81 % A, 27. 63 % T, 27. 24 % C, and 16. 33 % G, with a high AT content of 56. 44 %, indicating an obvious anti-guanine bias commonly observed in fishes. It shared 90. 7 %, 78. 8 %, and 78. 7 % mitogenome sequence with Plectropomus leopardus, Epinephelus moara, and Epinephelus coioides, respectively...|$|E
40|$|The <b>squaretail</b> <b>coralgrouper</b> Plectropomus areolatus was {{identified}} as a fast-growing, early maturing and relatively short-lived aggregation-spawning epinephelid. Examinations of sectioned otoliths found females and males first maturing at 2 and 3 years, respectively, suggesting protogynous hermaphroditism; however, no transitionals were observed in samples. Age distribution for the two sexes was similar and both were represented in the oldest age class; however, significant sex-specific differences in size-at-age were identified. Both sexes fully recruit into the fishery at age 4 years and reach 90 % of asymptotic length by age 3 years. Underwater visual assessments, combined with the gonado-somatic indices, revealed a 5 month reproductive season, with interannual variability observed in the month of highest density within the spawning aggregation. Catch restrictions on adults during spawning times and at reproductive sites, combined with gear-based management and enhanced enforcement, are recommended to maintain spawning stocks. Based on the available evidence, the sexual pattern for this species is unresolved...|$|E
40|$|Project summary Pohnpei {{is one of}} {{only two}} Pacific island nations to include {{specific}} fish spawning aggregation (FSA) conservation protocols into fisheries management. These actions include area protection of the largest recorded multi-species FSA site (Kehpara Marine Sanctuary, KMS) in the Indo-Pacific and a two-month sales ban on serranids during a portion of the presumed reproductive season for three species. Three other known (and likely several unknown) multi-species FSA remain vulnerable to fishing and have not been assessed for fishing impacts, spawning population area distribution or reproductive season. To determine reproductive times for serranids at KMS to improve the effectiveness of the commercial ban, the state marine resource agency and a local NGO conducted monthly underwater site monitoring from 2000 - 2005. Results were presented to the state marine resources committee in May 2005 and include recommendations to match the sales ban to the observed reproductive season and include a concomitant subsistence fishing ban. In 2005, a NOAA-funded vulnerability assessment of <b>squaretail</b> <b>coralgrouper</b> was initiated at KMS (PI) to show the effects of fishing on reproductively active individuals within the spawning season. Results show that subsistence fishing during th...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 647 <b>squaretail</b> <b>coralgrouper,</b> Plectropomus areolatus, were tagged within the Kehpara Marine Sanctuary (KMS) using {{conventional}} spaghetti-type Floy tags between 25 January and 25 May 2005. Included within this total are 22 males and 21 females implanted with Vemco V 16 ® acoustic tags. Fifty-nine conventionally tagged fish (9. 1 % of the total) were recaptured over 15 months, with 38 (64. 4 %) of those taken within the spawning season (January-May). The latter total includes 20 fish recaptured within the KMS by taggers and 18 by fishers outside the sanctuary. Of the fish taken outside the sanctuary, five were from unknown locations, while 82 % were captured within 10 - 12 km of the KMS, including 25 of 39 fish taken from channels immediately {{adjacent to the}} spawning site. The maximum reported distance for a recaptured fish was approximately 24 km. Inter-annual and inter-monthly spawning site fidelity was shown for 20 of the 43 acoustically tagged individuals that included both males and females. Nine individual returned to the site repeatedly within the spawning season, oftentimes disappearing from the site for several months before returning. These patterns provide evidence that individual monthly aggregations are composed of a mixture of individuals that ar...|$|E
40|$|The {{harvesting}} of groupers (Serranidae) in Indonesia for {{the live}} reef food fish trade (LRFFT) has been ongoing {{since the late}} 1980 s. Eight sites in Komodo National Park that included two fish spawning aggregation (FSA) sites were monitored for groupers and humphead wrasse, Cheilinus undulatus, from 1998 to 2003 and from 2005 to 2008 to examine temporal changes in abundance and assess the effectiveness of conservation and management efforts. Monitoring identified FSA sites for <b>squaretail</b> <b>coralgrouper,</b> Plectropomus areolatus, and brown-marbled grouper, Epinephelus fuscoguttatus. Both species formed aggregations before and during full moon from September to December, prior to lapses in monitoring (2003 – 2005) and in enforcement (2004 - 2005). Following these lapses, data reveal substantial declines in P. areolatus abundance and the apparent extirpation of one aggregation at one site. Other non-aggregating species targeted by the LRFFT showed similar declines at three of eight monitored sites. This paper highlights the impact of FSA fishing {{and the need for}} a seamless monitoring and enforcement protocol in areas where aggregation fishing pressure is high. Within Komodo National Park, local fishers, particularly those operating on behalf of the LRFFT, pose a serious threat to population persistence of species targeted by this trade...|$|E
40|$|<b>Squaretail</b> <b>coralgrouper</b> (Plectropomus areolatus) were {{captured}} and tagged at a fish spawning aggregation (FSA) site with conventional and acoustic tags {{to assess their}} vulnerability to fishing and spatial dynamics during reproductive periods. Males outnumbered females in catch and, on average, were larger than females. Findings revealed a high vulnerability to fishing, particularly during reproductive periods, and most fish were recaptured within the 5 -month spawning season and within 10 − 12 km of the aggregation site. Individual and sex-specific variability in movement to, and residency times at, the FSA site indicates that individual monthly spawning aggregations represent subsets of the total reproductive population. Some individuals appeared to move along a common migratory corridor to reach the FSA site. Sex-specific behavioral differences, particularly longer residency times, appear to increase the vulnerability of reproductively active males to fishing, particularly within a FSA, which could reduce reproductive output. Both fishery-dependent and fishery-independent data indicate that only males were present within {{the first month of}} aggregation. The combined results indicate that reproductively active P. areolatus are highly vulnerable to fishing and that FSAs and migratory corridors of reproductively active fish should be incorporated into marine protected areas. The capture of P. areolatus during reproductive periods should be restricted as part of a comprehensive management strate...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{estimate}} home range areas and distance of movement away from a <b>squaretail</b> <b>coralgrouper</b> (Plectropomus areolatus) spawning aggregation site located within a small-scale 1. 5 km 2 Marine Protected Area (MPA) in Pohnpei, Micronesia. Fifteen P. areolatus were acoustically tagged and re-located within a ca. 50 km 2 search area over a 4 -month period that included reproductive and non-reproductive months. All relocated fish were found in areas of moderate to high coral cover either on the fore reef or inside the lagoon in home ranges of 0. 048 ± 0. 018 km 2 (l ± S. E.). Variability in home range area (0. 004 – 0. 12 km 2) and distance of movement from aggregation sites following spawning (0. 02 – 23. 0 km; 5. 3 ± 3. 6 km, l ± S. E.) was observed, but did not appear to be sex specific. Five of the six relocated individuals were found within 0. 02 – 6. 1 km of the aggregation. This evidence and that from recent tag-recapture studies of epinephelids suggest that a substantial proportion of individual P. areolatus spawning populations reside within close proximity to their respective aggregation sites. Reproductive populations could be protected by MPAs of moderate scale (10 s of km 2) that include aggregation sites, migratory corridors and adjacent home range habitats...|$|E
40|$|The {{broodstock}} of two grouper species, {{tiger grouper}} Epinephelus fuscoguttatus and <b>squaretail</b> <b>coralgrouper</b> Plectropomus areolatus, were maintained in sea cages near Rutland Island, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, India, and their spawning performance was monitored from June 2007 to December 2010. E. fuscoguttatus generally spawned monthly {{in association with}} the new moon phase, for 8 - 9. months each year. Each year, they underwent a 3 - to 4 -month refractory period between February and June then recommenced spawning in May-July. P. areolatus showed a different spawning pattern to E. fuscoguttatus, spawning for less than 6. months each year, also {{in association with the}} new moon, and demonstrating much longer refractory periods (up to 15. months) than E. fuscoguttatus. Analysis of temperature data from the sea cage site showed that water temperature was significantly lower during spawning events than during comparable non-spawning periods. We postulate that one factor inhibiting spawning is higher water temperatures exceeding the upper thermal inhibitory limit for both grouper species during the hotter months of the year. Selected broodstock fish of both species were also maintained in onshore tanks fitted with recirculating filtration systems, but the spawning performance of both grouper species in the onshore tanks was inferior to broodstock held in the sea cages. E. fuscoguttatus maintained in onshore tanks spawned during only 5. months of the 42 -month study period, whereas E. fuscoguttatus held in the sea cages spawned during 29. months over the same time frame. P. areolatus held in onshore tanks over the same period did not spawn, whereas P. areolatus held in sea cages spawned during 16. months out of the 42 -month study period. © 2013 Elsevier B.
