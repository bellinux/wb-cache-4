5000|$|The film {{opened to}} {{predominantly}} positive reviews on 18 April 2014. Sify wrote, [...] "Shree {{has come out}} with a thriller comedy that seldom loses its grip. Credible performances from its leads and a nail-biting screenplay makes it an engaging trip. Damaal Dumeel is an enjoyable and racy fun ride". M Suganth of The Times of India, giving the film 3 stars out of 5, termed the film [...] "a worthy attempt" [...] and further wrote, [...] "Right in the opening shot sic we realize {{that we are in the}} hands of a competent filmmaker and Shree keeps things moving at a brisk pace till the end. Even the romantic track is used only in small doses and the director doesn't allow a possible melancholic moment to linger". IANS also gave 3 stars out of 5 and called it [...] "a reasonably good dark comedy that you seldom see from an industry that has an urge for predominantly making masala entertainers". Behindwoods gave 2.5 stars out of 5 and wrote, [...] "Unlike the usual commercial masala that we get to watch every second Friday, Damaal Dumeel slips into the crux of the <b>story</b> <b>right</b> <b>after</b> the public service advertisement on smoking is played and clutches onto it right till the end. The movie has an interesting combination of dark comedy and titillation and the actions of the characters that appear in the film are quite unpredictable".|$|E

5000|$|For {{years the}} track {{was listed as}} being 1.53 miles in length—the <b>story</b> goes that <b>right</b> <b>after</b> it was built, {{somebody}} used the odometer in a Chevrolet to measure the track length—and 1.53 was taken as gospel. Following the 2008 reconstruction (see below), Lime Rock's operations people measured all four possible configurations, and as it turns out, each was 1.5 miles long, plus or minus a few hundred feet.

2500|$|The {{series was}} {{originally}} {{meant to be}} set in a then contemporary 1985, but Waldrop, who was to write the first story, insisted that his <b>story</b> take place <b>right</b> <b>after</b> World War II. This created a forty-year gap between the first chapter and the remaining stories, pushing later contributions {{to fill in the}} intervening decades. Martin noted that this forced the authors to write about events they would have otherwise ignored, particularly the House Un-American Activities Committee and the McCarthy hearings which gave rise to characters and plot points that [...] "added immeasurable richness to our world and depth of our characters". Waldrop's story also forced Williams to rewrite a new story, [...] "Witness", which became the only shared world story to appear on the final ballot for a Nebula Award.|$|R

They were able to obtain the <b>story</b> <b>rights</b> for $60,000 instead of the original $100,000. When news broke concerning just what was intended with the play, the three authors threatened to sue.
