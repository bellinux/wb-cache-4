5|$|The next day, Ruskin follows Monk {{again as}} he investigates a case at a {{pawnshop}} in which its owner was shot during a robbery. Monk is intrigued {{as to why the}} burglar entered through the wall and only stole a <b>small</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> and a wristwatch. After discussing if Ruskin's presence can harm Monk, Natalie (Traylor Howard) and Monk find the crime's weapon. Monk finds the same glitter he found on Cullman's hair in the gun and argues the thief stole the watch to replace his one, deducing that the same person committed both crimes.|$|E
25|$|However, {{only one}} of these Nash equilibria {{satisfies}} a more restrictive equilibrium concept, subgame perfection. Suppose that the first demands a large amount that gives the second some (<b>small)</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money.</b> By rejecting the demand, the second is choosing nothing rather than something. So, {{it would be better for}} the second to choose to accept any demand that gives him/her any amount whatsoever. If the first knows this, he/she will give the second the smallest (non-zero) amount possible.|$|E

He worked in Placer County, and was subsequently hired to oversee construction of a mill near present-day Bakersfield. Smith became half-owner of the mill, which grew to become the largest milling plant in California at the time. In 1856, Smith and R.A. McClellan purchased the entire Gold Ledge property. Smith continued working the mine and operating the mill until May 1859. He sold his share to McClellan and the family returned east.|$|E
25|$|Following a {{short period}} of work {{addressing}} envelopes at the National Cyclists' Union in Fleet Street, he found himself unemployed and forced to live on the <b>small</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> he had saved from his time in Bristol. MacDonald eventually found employment as an invoice clerk in the warehouse of Cooper, Box and Co. During this time he was deepening his socialist credentials, and engaged himself energetically in C. L. Fitzgerald's Socialist Union which, unlike the SDF, aimed to progress socialist ideals through the parliamentary system. MacDonald witnessed the Bloody Sunday of 13 November 1887 in Trafalgar Square, and in response, had a pamphlet published by the Pall Mall Gazette, entitled Remember Trafalgar Square: Tory Terrorism in 1887.|$|E
25|$|In August 1927, {{when the}} {{conflict}} {{was at its}} height, the Inyo County bank collapsed, which massively undermined valley resistance. An audit revealed that there were shortages in both cash in the vault and amounts shown on the books. The Watterson brothers were indicted for embezzlement, then tried and convicted on thirty-six counts. Since all local business had been transacted through their bank, the closure left merchants and customers {{with little more than}} the <b>small</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> they had on hand. The brothers claimed that the fraud was done {{for the good of the}} Owens Valley against Los Angeles, and this excuse was generally believed to be true in Inyo County. The collapse of the bank wiped out the lifetime savings of many people, including payments gained from the sale of homes and ranches to Los Angeles.|$|E

25|$|Cast {{members in}} the Disney College Program at the Walt Disney World Resort have the {{opportunity}} to meet and live with other cast members within their housing complexes in Lake Buena Vista, FL. In the Netherlands, the law forbids companies to offer housing to their employees, because the government wants to prevent people who have just lost their job adding to their stressful situation by having to search for new housing. In Japan, many of the larger companies {{as well as some of}} the ministries still offer to their newly graduated freshmen a room in a dormitory. A room in such a dormitory often comes with a communal cook (for the men) or rooms with furnished kitchen blocks (for the women). Usually the employees pay a very <b>small</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> to enable the men (especially) to save money to buy a house when they get married.|$|E
25|$|From childhood, James Dunn was a {{voracious}} {{reader with}} an excellent memory. After completing his schooling, he left {{home to find}} employment {{and for a time}} he worked as a deckhand for an American shipping company on Lake Michigan. After this, {{he made his way to}} the east coast where he was employed by a manufacturing company in Lynn, Massachusetts. However, before long he returned home where a job as a clerk at the law firm of George Gilbert, where he worked alongside Richard Bedford Bennett, led him to the decision to apply to Dalhousie University Law School in Halifax, Nova Scotia. The <b>small</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> he had been able to save was not nearly enough to cover his education costs and Dunn worked at a variety of part-time jobs to pay his way through university, including a position in the university library. He graduated in 1898, then worked as a lawyer in Halifax before setting up a law practice in Edmonton, Alberta. Within a short time, Dunn was drawn to the booming economy of Montreal, Quebec where he landed a position with one of the city's prominent law firms.|$|E

500|$|The Schindlers {{continued}} {{operation of the}} Terri Schindler Schiavo Foundation, with a new goal of helping individuals in situations similar to Terri's. In April 2010, Michael Schiavo charged that the Schindlers were improperly using Terri's name, as he held the rights to it, and that the family was using the foundation {{in order to make}} money. A Florida television station looked at the foundation's tax records and found that for 2008, it paid 64% of the $91,568 it raised in salaries to Terri's father, Robert Schindler, Sr., her sister, Suzanne Vitadamo, and her brother, Robert Schindler, Jr. Their attorney said the foundation does its work effectively and that the high percentage for salaries was due to the <b>small</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> the foundation raises. He also said that the Schindlers had the right to use Terri's name as she is a public figure. The foundation had been fined $1,000 shortly before Schiavo's death for failing to file timely paperwork. In September 2010, the Schindlers renamed the organization the [...] "Terri Schiavo Life and Hope Network." ...|$|E

It states: [...] "John Deering is a poor inventor living modestly {{with his wife and}} only daughter. He has approached Mr. Cobleigh, a capitalist, with a proposition to share the profits of a new invention with him, providing that he (Cobleigh) furnish the capital to swing it. Cobleigh comes to see the model of Deering's invention and is greatly impressed with it. Cobleigh offers Deering a <b>small</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> for the invention, but Deering refuses to accept it. Then Cobleigh, having failed to get his invention by fair means, determines to secure it by foul. He drugs Deering, and the result of the poison is to make the inventor temporarily insane. While in this condition, Cobleigh has Deering transferred to an insane asylum. Then he forges the inventor's name to the bill of sale and thinks that his crime will never be discovered. Deering's daughter, Grace, failing to induce her sweetheart, Tom Reynolds, to aid in rescuing Deering, breaks into the asylum and takes her father out singlehandedly. She conveys him to a camp in the woods where her tender care restores him to health. Then she takes him home again and he demands his rights from Cobleigh. The latter denies that he owes Deering a cent, and the inventor goes to law. Tom, who acts as his counsel, shows by enlarged stereopticon views of the two signatures that Cobleigh had traced the one from the other. Cobleigh, overcome by the revelation of his crime, is arrested, and the Deering family and the faithful Tom are happy." ...|$|E
