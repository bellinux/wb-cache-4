Spezia - Spezia Firefighters): since most of Spezia's players were drafted, the society's {{president}} had to ask the local firefighters to play for the team.|$|E
25|$|As <b>said</b> <b>above,</b> the {{centerpiece}} of the Zeppelin airship display is the full-scale, partial replica of the LZ 129 Hindenburg, which was reproduced true to the original and authentically furnished. It is 33 m in length, large enough to convey an idea of the enormous dimensions of the original airship.|$|E
25|$|The city is {{strongly}} turned towards the tertiary sector. As <b>said</b> <b>above,</b> {{a majority of}} the enterprises of the city are shops. Mende is the centre of an area's population of approximately 20,000 inhabitants around the Lot Valley, the city therefore centralises much of the services. Its quality of prefecture adds to the presence of public service.|$|E

25|$|A Euclidean {{space is}} not {{technically}} a vector space {{but rather an}} affine space, on which a vector space acts by translations, or, conversely, a Euclidean vector is the difference (displacement) in an ordered pair of points, not a single point. Intuitively, the distinction says merely {{that there is no}} canonical choice of where the origin should go in the space, because it can be translated anywhere. When a certain point is chosen, it can be declared the origin and subsequent calculations may ignore the difference between a point and its coordinate vector, as <b>said</b> <b>above.</b> See point–vector distinction for details.|$|E
500|$|Each playable {{character}} in the game {{has the ability to}} equip items. Weapons in the game, unlike its predecessors, are gained in levels. Some items are only found in certain stages, but is only obtainable if completing a goal. Sometimes the goal may be very simple, but some may be not that easy {{to figure out how to}} obtain the certain item. By defeating generals and lieutenants, the player's character is awarded experience scaled by the difficulty of each officer, and the amount of them defeated. This experience is allocated at the end of the level and allows the player to increase their attributes or obtain new forms. Each playable officer has 9 levels to achieve with their standard weapon, while a 10th level is accessible through special in-game requirements, and on the [...] "Hard" [...] difficulty, which is found to be frustrating like most games, the harder the difficulty the more eager you gain. Items can have a number of effects on the player such as increasing attack power, defense, and movement speed. You can also retrieve your health level to avoid getting killed and having [...] "Game Over" [...] by obtaining [...] "Chinese Meatbuns" [...] that at first, look like onions like in any other game in the so far successful Dynasty Warriors franchise. You can also obtain item boost that increase a certain skill by 2 for limited time only. You can also get packs of wine and packs of Chinese Meatbuns in certain stages in certain locations during gameplay. As <b>said</b> <b>above,</b> special items can also be unlocked by completing objectives during gameplay. Special items can grant the player a statistics boost, a unique ability or skill, or even a ride-able mount such as an Elephant or Horse.|$|E
2500|$|As <b>said</b> <b>above,</b> time {{measurement}} method and vocabulary below 1 hour is very peculiar in Tunisian {{and is not}} found in neither the other dialects of Maghrebi Arabic or standard Arabic. Indeed, Tunisian, uses fractions of 1 hour and a special unit of 5 minutes called دراج [...] "drāj", to express time. Also, as in English as [...] "it's 3 am/pm" [...] or just [...] "it's 3" [...] and contrary to other languages such as standard Arabic, Tunisian do not precise the word [...] "sāɛa (hour)" [...] when expressing {{the time of the}} day as the subject is considered implied. Below is the list of the vocabulary used for time indication: ...|$|E

In the island of Panay, the natives declare that no {{one of them had}} ever been afflicted with buboes until the people from Bohol - who, as we <b>said</b> <b>above,</b> abandoned Bohol on account of the people of Maluco - came to settle in Panay, and gave the disease to some of the natives. For these reasons the governor, Don Gonzalo Ronquillo, founded the town of Arevalo, {{on the south side of}} this island; for the island runs north and south, and on that side live the majority of the people, and the villages are near this town, and the land here is more fertile." ...|$|E
2500|$|So far we {{have spoken}} only {{of the office of}} Prime {{properly}} so called, which ends like the other Little Hours. It is followed by some prayers which are called the office of the chapter, and are composed in the Roman Liturgy of the reading of the martyrology, of a prayer, [...] "Sancta Maria et omnes sancti" [...] ("May holy Mary and all the Saints..."), a prayer concerning work, [...] "Respice in servos tuos [...] [...] [...] Dirigere et sanctificare" [...] ("Look upon thy servants... Direct and sanctify"), and a blessing. This addition to Prime is a legacy bequeathed by the monks to the secular clergy. As has been <b>said</b> <b>above,</b> originally after Prime the monks had to betake themselves to manual work or reading. The office therefore ended with a prayer for their work [...] "... et opera manuum nostrarum dirige super nos et opus manuum nostrarum dirige" [...] ("...and direct thou the works of our hands over us; yea, the work of our hands do thou direct."), and the prayer [...] "Dirigere". Later the reading of the martyrology, the necrology, the rule, and a prayer for the dead were added.|$|E
2500|$|... {{which is}} known as the {{dispersion}} relation for a free particle. Here one must notice that now, since the particle is not entirely free but under the influence of a potential (the potential V described above), the energy of the particle given above {{is not the same thing}} as [...] where p is the momentum of the particle, and thus the wavenumber k above actually describes the energy states of the particle, not the momentum states (i.e. it turns out that the momentum of the particle is not given by [...] ). In this sense, it is quite dangerous to call the number k a wavenumber, since it is not related to momentum like [...] "wavenumber" [...] usually is. The rationale for calling k the wavenumber is that it enumerates the number of crests that the wavefunction has inside the box, and in this sense it is a wavenumber. This discrepancy can be seen more clearly below, when we find out that the energy spectrum of the particle is discrete (only discrete values of energy are allowed) but the momentum spectrum is continuous (momentum can vary continuously) and in particular, the relation [...] for the energy and momentum of the particle does not hold. As <b>said</b> <b>above,</b> the reason this relation between energy and momentum does not hold is that the particle is not free, but there is a potential V in the system, and the energy of the particle is , where T is the kinetic and V the potential energy.|$|E
