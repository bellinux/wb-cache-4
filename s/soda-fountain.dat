6000|$|Between games, {{sitting on}} the davenport, Babbitt spoke to her with the {{requisite}} gallantry, that sonorous Floral Heights gallantry which is not flirtation but a terrified flight from it: [...] "You're looking like a new <b>soda-fountain</b> to night, Louetta." ...|$|E
60|$|I look on {{that moment}} as the happiest of my life. I {{met her at}} the stage door, and {{conducted}} her to the nearest <b>soda-fountain.</b> We were inside and I was buying the checks before she realized where she was, and I shall never forget her look of mingled pain and horror.|$|E
6000|$|Dyer's Drug Store, {{a corner}} {{building}} of regular and unreal blocks of artificial stone. Inside the store, a greasy marble <b>soda-fountain</b> {{with an electric}} lamp of red and green and curdled-yellow mosaic shade. Pawed-over heaps of tooth-brushes and combs and packages of shaving-soap. Shelves of soap-cartons, teething-rings, garden-seeds, and patent medicines in yellow [...] "packages-nostrums" [...] for consumption, for [...] "women's diseases"--notorious mixtures of opium and alcohol, in the very shop to which her husband sent patients for the filling of prescriptions.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nobody's {{going to}} pass no slighting remarks on nobody," [...] Babbitt observed, [...] "not if they stay home and study their {{geometry}} and mind their own affairs instead of hanging around a lot of poolrooms and <b>soda-fountains</b> and places where nobody's got any business to be!" ...|$|R
6000|$|It was a vain desire. At {{the front}} door of the apothecary's hung a thermometer, and as they entered they heard the next comer cry out with a maniacal pride in the affliction laid upon mankind, [...] "Ninety-seven degrees!" [...] Behind them at the door there poured in a ceaseless stream of people, each pausing at the shrine of heat; before he tossed off the hissing draught that two pale, close-clipped boys served them from either side of the fountain. Then in the order of their coming they issued through another door upon the side street, each, as he disappeared, turning his face half round, and casting a casual glance upon a little group near another counter. The group was of a very patient, half-frightened, half-puzzled looking gentleman who sat {{perfectly}} still on a stool, and of a lady who stood beside him, rubbing all over his head a handkerchief full of pounded ice, and easing one hand with the other when the first became tired. Basil drank his soda and paused to look upon this group, which he felt would commend itself to realistic sculpture as eminently characteristic of the local life, and as [...] "The Sunstroke" [...] would sell enormously in the hot season. [...] "Better take a little more of that," [...] the apothecary said, looking up from his prescription, and, as the organized sympathy of the seemingly indifferent crowd, smiling very kindly at his patient, who thereupon tasted something in the glass he held. [...] "Do you still feel like fainting?" [...] asked the humane authority. [...] "Slightly, now and then," [...] answered the other, [...] "but I'm hanging on hard to the bottom curve of that icicled S on your <b>soda-fountain,</b> and I feel that I'm all right as long as I can see that. The people get rather hazy, occasionally, and have no features to speak of. But I don't know that I look very impressive myself," [...] he added in the jesting mood which seems the natural condition of Americans in the face of all embarrassments.|$|E
60|$|Above {{railroad}} {{yards and}} mean tenements in Long Island City, {{just across the}} East River from New York, the shining milky walls of Pemberton's bulk up like a castle overtowering a thatched village. It is magnificently the new-fashioned, scientific, efficient business institution.... Except, perhaps, in one tiny detail. King Pemberton and his princely sons {{do not believe in}} all this nonsense about profit-sharing, or a minimum wage, or an eight-hour day, or pensions, {{or any of the other}} fads by which dangerous persons like Mr. Ford, the motor manufacturer, encourage the lazier workmen to think that they have just as much right to rise to the top as the men who have had nerve and foresight. And indeed Mr. Pemberton may be sound. He says that he bases wages on the economic law of supply and demand, instead of on sentiment; and how shrewdly successful are he and his sons is indicated by the fact that Pemberton's is one of the largest sources of drugs and proprietary medicines in the world; the second largest manufactory of <b>soda-fountain</b> syrups; of rubber, celluloid, and leather goods of the kind seen in corner drug-stores; and the third largest manufactory of soaps and toilet articles. It has been calculated that ninety-three million women in all parts of the world have ruined their complexions, and, therefore, their souls, by Pemberton's creams and lotions for saving the same; and that nearly three-tenths of the alcohol consumed in prohibition counties is obtained in Pemberton's tonics and blood-builders and women's specifics, the last being regarded by large farmers with beards as especially tasty and stimulating. Mr. Pemberton is the Napoleon of patent medicine, and also the Napoleon of drugs used by physicians to cure the effects of patent medicine. He is the Shakespeare of ice-cream sodas, and the Edison of hot-water bags. He rules more than five thousand employees, and his name is glorious on cartons in drug-stores, from Sandy Hook to San Diego, and chemists' shops from Hong-Kong to the Scilly Isles. He is a modern Allah, and Mr. S. Herbert Ross is his prophet.|$|E
6000|$|On a wet and smoky night I {{went from}} the London streets into the {{brightness}} and warmth of that refuge for American soldiers and sailors, the [...] "Eagle Hut," [...] as the Y. M. C. A. is called. The place was full, as usual, but my glance was at once attracted by three strapping, intelligent-looking men in sailor blouses playing pool in a corner. [...] "I simply can't {{get used to the}} fact that people like that are ordinary sailors," [...] said the lady in charge to me as we leaned against the <b>soda-fountain.</b> [...] "They're a continual pride and delight to us Americans here--always so willing to help when there's anything to be done, and so interesting to talk to." [...] When I suggested that her ideas of the navy must have been derived from Pinafore she laughed. [...] "I can't imagine using a cat-o'-nine-tails on them!" [...] she exclaimed--and neither could I. I heard many similar comments. They are indubitably American, these sailors, youngsters with the stamp of our environment on their features, keen and self-reliant. I am not speaking now only of those who have enlisted since the war, but of those others, largely from the small towns and villages of our Middle West, who in the past dozen years or so have been recruited by an interesting and scientific system which {{is the result of the}} genius of our naval recruiting officers. In the files at Washington may be seen, carefully tabulated, the several reasons for their enlisting. Some have [...] "friends in the service"; others wish to [...] "perfect themselves in a trade," [...] to [...] "complete their education" [...] or [...] "see the world"--our adventurous spirit. And they are seeing it. They are also engaged in the most exciting and adventurous sport--with the exception of aerial warfare ever devised or developed--that of hunting down in all weathers over the wide spaces of the Atlantic those modern sea monsters that prey upon the Allied shipping. For the superdreadnought is reposing behind the nets, the battle-cruiser ignominiously laying mines; and for the present at least, until some wizard shall invent a more effective method of annihilation, victory over Germany depends primarily on the airplane and the destroyer. At three o'clock one morning I stood on the crowded deck of an Irish mail-boat watching the full moon riding over Holyhead Mountain and shimmering on the Irish Sea. A few hours later, in the early light, I saw the green hills of Killarney against a washed and clearing sky, the mud-flats beside the railway shining like purple enamel. All the forenoon, in the train, I travelled through a country bathed in translucent colours, a country of green pastures dotted over with white sheep, of banked hedges and perfect trees, of shadowy blue hills in the high distance. It reminded one of nothing so much as a stained-glass-window depicting some delectable land of plenty and peace. And it was Ireland! When at length I arrived at the station of the port for which I was bound, and which the censor does not permit me to name, I caught sight of the figure of our Admiral on the platform; and the fact that I was in Ireland and not in Emmanuel's Land was brought home to me by the jolting drive we took on an [...] "outside car," [...] the admiral perched precariously over one wheel and I over the other. Winding up the hill by narrow roads, we reached the gates of the Admiralty House.|$|E
6000|$|When they alighted, {{they took}} their way up {{through one of the}} streets of the great {{wholesale}} businesses, to Broadway. On this street was a throng of trucks and wagons lading and unlading; bales and boxes rose and sank by pulleys overhead; the footway was a labyrinth of packages of every shape and size: there was no flagging of the pitiless energy that moved all forward, no sign of how heavy a weight lay on it, save in the reeking faces of its helpless instruments. But when the wedding-journeyers emerged upon Broadway, the other passages and incidents of their dream faded before the superior fantasticality of the spectacle. It was four o'clock, the deadliest hour of the deadly summer day. The spiritless air seemed to have a quality of blackness in it, as if filled with the gloom of low-hovering wings. One half the street lay in shadow, and one half in sun; but the sunshine itself was dim, as if a heat greater than its own had smitten it with languor. Little gusts of sick, warm wind blew across the great avenue at the corners of the intersecting streets. In the upward distance, at which the journeyers looked, the loftier roofs and steeples lifted themselves dim out of the livid atmosphere, and far up and {{down the length of the}} street swept a stream of tormented life. All sorts of wheeled things thronged it, conspicuous among which rolled and jarred the gaudily painted Stages, with quivering horses driven each by a man who sat in the shade of a branching white umbrella, and suffered with a moody truculence of aspect, and as if he harbored the bitterness of death in his heart for the crowding passengers within, when one of them pulled the strap about his legs, and summoned him to halt. Most of the foot-passengers kept to the shady side, and to the unaccustomed eyes of the strangers they were not less in number than at any other time, though there were fewer women among them. Indomitably resolute of soul, they held their course with the swift pace of custom, and only here and there they showed the effect of the heat. One man, collarless, with waistcoat unbuttoned, and hat set far back from his forehead, waved a fan before his death-white flabby face, and set down one foot after the other with the heaviness of a somnambulist. Another, as they passed him, was saying huskily to the friend at his side, [...] "I can't stand this much longer. My hands tingle as if they had gone to sleep; my heart--" [...] But still the multitude hurried on, passing, repassing, encountering, evading, vanishing into shop-doors and emerging from them, dispersing down the side streets, and swarming out of them. It was a scene that possessed the beholder with singular fascination, and in its effect of universal lunacy, it might well have seemed the last phase of a world presently to be destroyed. They who were in it but not of it, as they fancied, though there was no reason for this,--looked on it amazed, and at last their own errands being accomplished, and themselves so far cured of the madness of purpose, they cried with one voice, that it was a hideous sight, and strove to take refuge from it in the nearest place where the <b>soda-fountain</b> sparkled.|$|E

5000|$|Restaurant slang: Another {{notion of}} the term's origin claims that {{it came from a}} code {{supposedly}} used in some restaurants among restaurant workers in the 1930s, where 86 meant [...] "we're all out of it."

50|$|In 1832, John Matthews of New York City and John Lippincott of Philadelphia began {{manufacturing}} soda fountains. Both added {{innovations that}} improved <b>soda-fountain</b> equipment, {{and the industry}} expanded as retail outlets installed newer, better fountains. Other pioneering manufacturers were Alvin Puffer, Andrew Morse, Gustavus Dows, and James Tufts. In 1891 the four largest manufacturers—Tufts, Puffer, Lippincott, and Matthews—formed the American Soda Fountain Company, which was a trust designed to monopolize the industry. The four manufacturers continued to produce and market fountains under their company names. The trust controlled prices and forced some smaller manufacturers out of business.|$|E

Before I was five I had learned {{to read and write}} and {{discovered}} a talent for drawing which developed over the years until my ambition was to first become a cartoonist, then an illustrator. I delivered the Dallas Journal every morning, taking as pay watercolor lessons, and during the great hurricane of 1915 when I was ten, I was considered quite a hero for having delivered the paper, even though flying tin roofs sailed about me. My education was cut short after a year of college when I went to work to help support my mother and young sister. I was a <b>soda-fountain</b> boy, a sign painter, a door-to-door magazine salesman; I worked in the oil fields and aboard cargo vessels plying the Mexican Gulf and Caribbean Sea, where I met many odd but wonderful characters who appear in my works of sea fiction.|$|E
5000|$|The use of {{malted milk}} powder in milkshakes was popularized in the USA by the Chicago {{drugstore}} chain Walgreens. Malted milk powder — {{a mixture of}} evaporated milk, malted barley, and wheat flour — had been invented by William Horlick in 1897 for use as an easily digested restorative health drink for disabled people and children, and as an infant's food. However, healthy people soon began drinking beverages made with malted milk simply for the taste, and malted milk beverages containing milk, chocolate syrup, and malt powder became a standard offering at soda fountains. In 1922, Walgreens employee Ivar [...] "Pop" [...] Coulson made a milkshake by adding two scoops of vanilla ice cream to the standard malted milk drink recipe. This item, under the name [...] "Horlick's Malted Milk", was featured by the Walgreen drugstore chain {{as part of a}} chocolate milk shake, which itself became known as a [...] "malted" [...] or [...] "malt" [...] and {{became one of the most}} popular <b>soda-fountain</b> drinks.|$|E
