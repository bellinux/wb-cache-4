In related work, Schimmer's team showed that FLIP levels are higher in metastatic cells than non-metastatic cells, and that reducing FLIP levels using RNAi (RNA Interference) or other small molecule inhibitors of FLIP can sensitize metastatic cells to anoikis. Given that FLIP is an inhibitor of anoikis, and that reducing FLIP can sensitize metastatic cells to anoikis, Mawji et al. hypothesize that FLIP reduction may be a viable therapeutic strategy against cancer metastasis.|$|E

The results of both assays were compared to the “gold standard” of combined culture results and clinical diagnosis. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the DR.

Inhibition of other enzymes affected by cannabinoids (monoacylglycerol lipase and liver carboxylesterase) was performed as a screen for biological selectivity for a small number of compounds, but compound 362 was not included.

40|$|The {{confirmation}} of positive <b>screening</b> <b>assay</b> reactions for antibodies to {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (anti-HIV- 1) by Western blot is expensive and often gives indeterminate results. We therefore carried out a collaborative study to investigate the {{confirmation of}} <b>screening</b> <b>assay</b> reactions using a second <b>screening</b> <b>assay.</b> For this purpose, seven laboratories prospectively tested sequential specimens, using at least one additional <b>screening</b> <b>assay,</b> until about 50 confirmed anti-HIV- 1 -positive specimens had been identified in each test centre. The reactions of 16 assays were analysed in pairs (assay A and assay B), using assay B on specimens reactive in assay A: A+/B+ reactions were considered positive and A-, negative anti-HIV results. These outcomes were compared with those obtained using confirmatory Western blot. In all, 7950 specimens were tested, and 359 were reported as positive by the laboratories. Within the test centres, eight <b>screening</b> <b>assay</b> pairings gave rise to no false-positive or false-negative results, and these combinations were at least as accurate as a single <b>screening</b> <b>assay</b> followed by Western blot. From 6. 3 % to 8. 3 % of the Western blot results were indeterminate. The number of specimens examined {{was too small to}} justify recommending for general use named pairs of screening assays; the choice of these would, in any case, depend on local conditions. However, individual laboratory managers may wish to investigate the large potential savings to be made by confirming HIV infection using a second <b>screening</b> <b>assay</b> on initially reactive specimens. If the more sensitive <b>screening</b> <b>assay</b> is used first, the sensitivity of this approach may be improved by further investigation of specimens that react as A+B-...|$|E
40|$|There is {{increasing}} {{concern over the}} potential adverse effects of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) present in the environment on human and wildlife. Many of these compounds are hydrophobic, lipophylic and resistant to biological and chemical degradation.

Screening bioassays are useful techniques for the determination of receptor-mediated activities in environmental samples containing complex mixtures of chemicals.

South Africa identified the need for a battery of screening tests relevant for the local conditions.
