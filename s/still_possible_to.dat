5|$|Even {{following}} the conversion to cylindrical smokeboxes, it was <b>still</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> distinguish some non-streamliners from ex-streamliners. On the former (Nos. 46230-46234 and 46249-46252, but not 46253-46257) the running plates veered downwards {{at right angles}} to connect with the buffer beam {{in the style of the}} Princess Royal Class. The ex-streamliners did not have any such connection, except No.46242 City of Glasgow which was rebuilt in 1952 following a serious collision.|$|E
5|$|It is <b>still</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> {{lose all}} three {{hydraulic}} systems if serious damage occurs elsewhere, as nearly {{happened to a}} cargo airliner in 2002 during takeoff when a main gear tire exploded in the wheel well area. The damage in the left wing area caused total fluid loss from the number 1 and the number 2 hydraulic systems. The number 3 system was dented but not penetrated. DC-10s still have no fuse protection {{for any of the}} three hydraulic systems {{in the event of an}} exploding main gear tire.|$|E
5|$|Mary Russell Mitford {{lived in}} Reading {{for a number}} of years and then spent the rest of her life just outside the town at Three Mile Cross and Swallowfield. The fictional Belford Regis of her eponymous novel, first {{published}} in 1835, is largely based on Reading. Described with topographical accuracy, it is <b>still</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> follow the steps of the novel's characters in present-day Reading.|$|E
50|$|The stadium has {{floodlights}} {{but it is}} <b>still</b> not <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> play {{an official}} match at night there.|$|R
50|$|Thus, the {{exhausted}} Franco-Spanish army {{was forced to}} choose between staying in front of Abrantes and starve, or withdraw, while <b>still</b> <b>possible,</b> closer <b>to</b> the border.|$|R
50|$|If the {{passwords}} {{are stored}} in an unencrypted fashion, it is <b>still</b> generally <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> obtain the passwords given local access to the machine.|$|R
5|$|Any {{mechanical}} component will unavoidably possess both mass and stiffness. This translates in electrical terms to an LC circuit, that is, a circuit consisting of an inductor and a capacitor, hence {{mechanical component}}s are resonators {{and are often}} used as such. It is <b>still</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> represent inductors and capacitors as individual lumped elements in a mechanical implementation by minimising (but never quite eliminating) the unwanted property. Capacitors may be made of thin, long rods, that is, the mass is minimised and the compliance is maximised. Inductors, on the other hand, may be made of short, wide pieces which maximise the mass {{in comparison to the}} compliance of the piece.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln Castle {{is a major}} castle {{constructed}} in Lincoln, England, during the late 11th century by William the Conqueror {{on the site of}} a pre-existing Roman fortress. The castle is unusual in that it has two mottes. It is only one of two such castles in the country, the other being at Lewes in Sussex. Lincoln Castle remained in use as a prison and law court into modern times, {{and is one of the}} better preserved castles in England; the Crown Courts continue to this day. It is open to the public as a museum. Lincoln Castle remains one of the most impressive Norman castles in the United Kingdom. It is <b>still</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> walk around the immense Norman walls which provide a magnificent view of the castle complex, together with panoramic views of the cathedral, the city, and the surrounding countryside.|$|E
5|$|The newer {{technologies}} of road and rail {{led to the}} navigation falling into disuse. Some lengths of the system were drained or allowed to overgrow with vegetation. Increasingly {{the difference between the}} canal and the river became less obvious, although it is <b>still</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> identify remains of the original locks. The threat to the remains which the construction of the M3 motorway posed spurred the Winchester Tenants and Residents Association and the local branch of the Inland Waterways Association into action in 1975, with both suggesting that the waterway could be restored. The two groups later co-operated, and the Itchen Navigation Preservation Society was formed.|$|E
2500|$|As {{indicated}} above, {{in general}} {{there is no}} way to associate a pure state to the component system [...] However, it <b>still</b> is <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> associate a density matrix. Let ...|$|R
2500|$|In general, {{it may not}} be easy to {{find such}} a simple {{description}} of the output interval for many functions. [...] But it may <b>still</b> be <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> extend functions to interval arithmetic.|$|R
50|$|Second {{layer of}} encryption:Optionally it is <b>still</b> <b>possible,</b> {{therefore}} <b>to</b> encrypt the capsule {{of the first}} layer in addition with an AES-256, - comparable to a commonly shared, 32-character long symmetric password. Hybrid Encryption is then added to multiple encryption.|$|R
5|$|These {{findings}} were contested {{a few years}} later by Catherine Forster, who reanalyzed Triceratops material more comprehensively and concluded that the remains fell into two species, T. horridus and T. prorsus, although the distinctive skull of T. ("Nedoceratops") hatcheri differed enough to warrant a separate genus. She found that T. horridus and several other species belonged together, and T. prorsus and T. brevicornus stood alone, and since there were many more specimens in the first group, she suggested that this meant the two groups were two species. It is <b>still</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> interpret the differences as representing a single species with sexual dimorphism.|$|E
5|$|Bede {{sometimes}} {{included in}} his theological books an {{acknowledgement of the}} predecessors on whose works he drew. In two cases he left instructions that his marginal notes, which gave {{the details of his}} sources, should be preserved by the copyist, and he may have originally added marginal comments about his sources to others of his works. Where he does not specify, it is <b>still</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> identify books to which he must have had access by quotations that he uses. A full catalogue of the library available to Bede in the monastery cannot be reconstructed, but it is possible to tell, for example, that Bede was very familiar with the works of Virgil. There is little evidence that he had access to any other of the pagan Latin writersâ€”he quotes many of these writers but the quotes are almost all {{to be found in the}} Latin grammars that were common in his day, one or more of which would certainly have been at the monastery. Another difficulty is that manuscripts of early writers were often incomplete: it is apparent that Bede had access to Pliny's Encyclopedia, for example, but it seems that the version he had was missing book xviii, as he would almost certainly have quoted from it in his De temporum ratione.|$|E
25|$|Even if {{one does}} not accept the axiom of {{infinity}} and therefore cannot accept that the set of all natural numbers exists, it is <b>still</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> define {{any one of these}} sets.|$|E
50|$|The nasal tissues should mostly {{stabilize}} within 3-6 months post-surgery, although shifting is <b>still</b> <b>possible</b> for up <b>to</b> {{and over}} a year afterwards.|$|R
50|$|In the Sint-Baafskerk, ("Saint Bavo's Church), Aardenburg {{houses the}} most {{complete}} example of the Scheldegotiek, the characteristic Gothic architecture of the Scheldt. It is also <b>still</b> <b>possible</b> today <b>to</b> see remains {{of some of the}} fortifications that used to enclose the city.|$|R
50|$|As of January 2017, it is <b>still</b> not <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> fly to Port Blair {{from outside}} of India. While {{international}} connections have been discussed for many years, particularly to nearby BKK Bangkok and HKT Phuket, direct international flights are not available.|$|R
25|$|Microsoft {{also argued}} that Felten's tool did not even {{completely}} remove web-browsing capability from the system since it was <b>still</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> access the web through other Windows executables besides iexplore.exe, such as the Windows help system.|$|E
25|$|It is <b>still</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> take {{a walking}} tour {{through the tunnel}} to Wapping from Rotherhithe and back, but these are {{infrequent}} and on an ad-hoc basis as they can only take place when that section of the line is closed for maintenance.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the slots}} are {{slightly}} {{longer than the}} biscuits, it is <b>still</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> slide the panels sideways after the joint is assembled (before the glue sets). This fact makes the biscuit joiner easy to use, {{because it does not}} require extreme accuracy or jigs to achieve perfect joints.|$|E
5000|$|Indefinite shelf life. Even 60-year-old tubes can be {{perfectly}} functional, and many types {{are available for}} purchase as [...] "new-old-stock". Thus, despite known reliability issues (see below), it is <b>still</b> perfectly <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> run most very old vacuum tube equipment.|$|R
50|$|In other words, first search {{where it}} most {{probably}} will be found, then search where finding it is less probable, then search where the probability is even less (but <b>still</b> <b>possible</b> due <b>to</b> limitations on fuel, range, water currents, etc.), until insufficient hope of locating the object at acceptable cost remains.|$|R
50|$|IFRS {{does not}} provide a rigid set of rules for {{classifying}} leases and there will always be borderline cases. It is also <b>still</b> sometimes <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> use leases to make balance sheets look better, provided that the lessee can justify treating them as operating leases.|$|R
25|$|In 1907 it was <b>still</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> review {{things at}} Greenacre without {{mentioning}} BahÃ¡'Ã­s. May Wright Sewall spoke in 1907 at Green Acre. Newspaper coverage began {{to cover the}} division and resolution at Greenacre and Farmer managed to keep the reputation of Greenacre high through 1907. Coverage of events occurred in Indianapolis.|$|E
25|$|Since 2002, SKM {{tickets are}} not valid on other PKP Group trains. Previously PKP Przewozy Regionalne tickets {{could be used}} on SKM trains, and SKM tickets could be used on PKP Przewozy Regionalne trains on SKM routes. It is <b>still</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> buy a monthly ticket valid on both companies.|$|E
25|$|For polyhedra with self-crossing faces, {{it may not}} {{be clear}} what it means for {{adjacent}} faces to be consistently coloured, but for these polyhedra it is <b>still</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> determine whether it is orientable or non-orientable by considering a topological cell complex with the same incidences between its vertices, edges, and faces.|$|E
5000|$|The {{definition}} of efficacy {{has been discussed}} by. [...] The only way in which absolute measures of efficacy have been obtained is by single ion channel analysis of ligand gated ion channels. It is <b>still</b> not <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> do this for G protein-linked receptors.|$|R
25|$|Despite {{these efforts}} by the French administration, the {{institution}} of slavery persisted {{through much of the}} colony and it was <b>still</b> <b>possible</b> in 1958 <b>to</b> purchase a slave in Timbuktu.|$|R
50|$|Mobile {{phone numbers}} {{start with the}} digit 3 and are {{generally}} ten digits long. It is <b>still</b> <b>possible,</b> but rare, <b>to</b> find nine-digit numbers, which {{were the first to}} be assigned.|$|R
25|$|In January 2014, Absolute Radio Network has {{restricted}} {{the access to}} the internet radio on their own website to UK listeners only, and removed their apps for iPhone and Android in non-UK app stores. But it is <b>still</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> access the internet radio outside the UK via the direct link or www.radioplayer.co.uk (which links to the official stream).|$|E
25|$|Recently, AQP4 {{has been}} found to {{distinguish}} standard multiple sclerosis from neuromyelitis optica, but as MS is a heterogeneous condition, and some MS cases are reported to be Kir4.1 channelopathies (autoimmunity against the potassium channels) it is <b>still</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> consider NMO as part of the MS spectrum. Besides, some NMO-AQP(âˆ’) variants are not astrocytopathic, but demyelinating.|$|E
25|$|Lemire {{shows that}} no scheme {{of this type}} can be 3-independent. Nevertheless, he shows that it is <b>still</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> achieve 2-independence. In particular, a {{tabulation}} scheme that interprets the values T (where x'i is, as before, the ith block of the input) as the coefficients of a polynomial over a finite field and then takes {{the remainder of the}} resulting polynomial modulo another polynomial, gives a 2-independent hash function.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{the third}} time a supply ship has been caught by the enemy at a meeting point. It is <b>still</b> not <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> tell from British radio messages, whether they knew about the meeting points, {{but the fact that}} there has been three interceptions is {{remarkable}} ...|$|R
50|$|The Name Shirbutt Lane is Derived from Shire Butts, from Days When {{the village}} was a Jousting Location, it is <b>still</b> <b>possible</b> on {{occasion}} <b>to</b> recognise {{the location of the}} jousting butts.|$|R
5000|$|In 2012-2014 a {{research}} group from University College London undertook {{a study of}} the Rubondo chimpanzees. Since 2015 Tanzania national park managers have been running a chimpanzee habituation project. The hope is that one day it will be <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> reliably view the Rubondo chimpanzees.
