50|$|The event {{started with}} a short superspecial stage on Thursday evening - which was won by Sébastien Loeb - before the first full day of action on Friday. The first stage on Friday {{demonstrated}} the competitive nature of the rally, with Loeb and Hirvonen <b>setting</b> <b>identical</b> times, and Jari-Matti Latvala only finishing three seconds behind them. However, Latvala was the first big casualty, hitting a rock on SS3 and damaging the suspension - an accident that put him out {{for the day and}} angered his Ford team boss Malcolm Wilson (rally). Meanwhile, Loeb was eking out a narrow advantage by winning every special stage until SS8. Hirvonen was also driving flat out and matched Loeb's time on SS6 and took his first outright stage win on the 7.86 mile test at Urria. At the end of day one, Loeb had built up a useful lead of 14.4 seconds, although Hirvonen had not given up hope. Behind the two leaders saw a three way battle between the two Stobart Ford drivers, Henning Solberg and Gigi Galli, and Loeb's teammate Dani Sordo. These three were covered by only twelve seconds. The two Subaru World Rally Team drivers, Petter Solberg and Chris Atkinson were having their own private battle, just over ninety seconds behind the leader. Suzuki's Per-Gunnar Andersson was in the final points paying position despite suffering a huge spin on SS2. Impressive performances were made by privateers Urmo Aava and Andreas Mikkelsen, with both featuring in the points earlier on day one - Aava was third after SS4 with Mikkelsen in fifth. However they both crashed out near the end of day one - Aava in SS9 and Mikkelsen in SS10.|$|E

40|$|Maximizing {{the optical}} network unit’s (ONU) sleep time is an {{effective}} approach for achieving maximum energy conservation in green Ethernet passive optical networks (EPONs). While overlapping downstream and upstream ONU transmissions can maximize the ONU sleep time, it jeopardizes the quality of service (QoS) performance of the network, especially for downstream trafﬁc in case the overlapping {{is based on the}} upstream time slot. In this paper, we study the downstream trafﬁc performance in green EPONs under the limited service discipline and the upstream-based overlapped time window. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst derive the expected mean packet delay, and then present a closed-form expression of the ONU sleep time, <b>setting</b> <b>identical</b> upstream/downstream transmission cycle times based on a maximum downstream trafﬁc delay re-quirement. With the proposed system model, we present a novel downstream bandwidth allocation scheme for energy conservation in green EPONs. Simulation results verify the proposed model and highlight the advantages of our scheme over conventional approaches...|$|E
40|$|We propose an {{approach}} for semantifying web extracted facts. In particular, we map subject and object terms of these facts to instances; and relational phrases to object properties defined in a target knowledge base. By doing this we resolve the ambiguity {{inherent in the}} web extracted facts, while simultaneously enriching the target knowledge base with {{a significant number of}} new assertions. In this paper, we focus on the mapping of the relational phrases {{in the context of the}} overall work ow. Furthermore, in an open extraction <b>setting</b> <b>identical</b> semantic relationships can be represented by different surface forms, making it necessary to group these surface forms together. To solve this problem we propose the use of markov clustering. In this work we present a complete, ontology independent, generalized workflow which we evaluate on facts extracted by Nell and Reverb. Our target knowledge base is DBpedia. Our evaluation shows promising results in terms of producing highly precise facts. Moreover, the results indicate that the clustering of relational phrases pays of in terms of an improved instance and property mapping...|$|E
40|$|Open Information Extractions (OIE) (like Nell, Reverb) {{frameworks}} {{provide us}} with domain independent facts in natural language forms containing knowledge from varied sources. Extraction mechanisms for structured knowledge bases (KB) (like DBpedia, Yago) often fail to retrieve such facts due to its resource specific extraction schemes. Hence, the structured KBs can extend themselves by augmenting their coverage with the facts discovered by OIE systems. This possibility motivates us to integrate these two genres of extractions into one interactive framework. In this work, we present a complete, ontology independent, generalized architecture for achieving this integration. Our proposed solution is modularized which solves {{a specific set of}} tasks: (1) mapping subject and object terms from OIE facts to KB instances (2) mapping the OIE relational phrases to object properties defined in the KB. Furthermore, in an open extraction <b>setting</b> <b>identical</b> semantic relationships can be represented by different surface forms, making it necessary to group them together. To solve this problem, (3) we propose the use of markov clustering to cluster OIE relations. Key to our approach lies in exploiting the inherent dependancies between relations and its arguments. This makes our approach completely context agnostic and generally applicable. We evaluated our method on the two state of the art extraction systems, achieving over 85...|$|E

40|$|Energy {{conservation}} in next generation Passive Optical Network system (NG-PON) has gained {{more and more}} attention. NG-PON system can not only deliver best-effort data traffic, but also real-time data traffic, e. g. voice and video, that have strict bandwidth, delay, and jitter requirements. To meet the energy and service requirements, a NG-PON system must have energy efficiency and differentiated QoS mechanism built in. Few research efforts have been reported on maximizing energy efficiency while maintaining QoS in the fairly new PON system design. We have extended the Upstream Centric Scheme (UCS-based) scheduling scheme idea into a novel QoS-differentiated energy-efficient PON system consisting of two main modules: firstly, the proposed differentiated QoS analytical model is described in detail to reduce the packet delay in the upstream traffic scheduling. The simulations further demonstrate the QoS metrics of the system: packet delay, bandwidth utilization, dropped packet rate, and queue length. Secondly, a novel analysis is proposed for downstream traffic scheduling with limited service discipline at Optical Line Terminal (OLT) side under the UCS-based Green Bandwidth Allocation (GBA) framework. We, first, derive the mean packet delay expression of this model. Then, the sleep time for each Optical Network Unit (ONU) is derived by <b>setting</b> <b>identical</b> upstream/downstream transmission cycle time. Based on the analytical model, an approach is developed to save the maximum energy in a dynamic PON system while without violating the delay requirement. Moreover, simulation is conducted to verify the developed analytical model and the proposed approach. In the end, considering the differentiated QoS and downstream traffic scheduling, an algorithm of the energy efficient scheduling scheme is proposed as well under the UCS-based GBA...|$|E
40|$|Zumba® {{is a group}} {{exercise}} format that incorporates aerobic dance components and claims to be an appropriate physical activity {{to be included in}} an exercise prescription for improving cardiorespiratory fitness. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the energy expenditure and physiological effects of a 58. 6 min Zumba® class and compare the average METs of the Zumba® class to the ACSM’s definition of vigorous activity of 6 METs. All participants (n= 30) were volunteers from Zumba® classes at Texas Woman’s University. Participants attended three Zumba® classes to become familiar with the choreography. The Zumba® session where data was collected was performed in a standard class <b>setting</b> <b>identical</b> to the three familiarization classes. The Zumba® class was composed of 16 songs corresponding to a specific set of choreography. The Zumba® class was divided into a warm up phase, aerobic phase, and cool down phase. Oxygen consumption (VO 2) was measured using a K 4 b 2 Cosmed unit that the participant wore during the Zumba® class. A one sample t test was used to determine if there was a significant difference between the METs of the Zumba® class and 6 METs. A repeated measures ANOVA, with a Bonferroni post-hoc test, was used to determine if there was a significant difference between variables in the three phases of the Zumba® class. Significance level was set at p ≤. 05. Mean METs for the full Zumba® class (5. 7 ± 1. 8 METs) was not significantly different (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) from 6 METs. The HR during the aerobic phase (164 ± 12 bpm) was significantly higher (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) than the warm up (148 ± 25 bpm) and cool down phase (139 ± 20 bpm). Similarly,...|$|E

40|$|Mouse clones were {{produced}} by serial nuclear transfer commencing with {{the transfer of}} four-cell nuclei at metaphase into unfertilized ooplasts. The donor four-cell-stage nuclei were synchronized in metaphase with nocodazole. The oocytes receiving a four-cell nucleus at metaphase formed two nuclei after artificial activation and inhibition of cytokinesis with cytochalasin B. To obtain embryos with diploid sets of chromosomes, nuclei from each reconstructed embryo were transferred individually into separate enucleated fertilized one-cell embryos, thus doubling the number of identical embryos. This procedure produced a high frequency of development of reconstructed embryos to the blastocyst stage. Of 11 <b>sets</b> of <b>identical</b> embryos produced by serial nuclear transplantation, 83 % developed into blastocysts, including three <b>sets</b> of <b>identical</b> septuplet blastocysts.
