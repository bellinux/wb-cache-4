5|$|At 01:00 on 25 April the British ships {{stopped at}} <b>sea,</b> <b>and</b> thirty-six rowing boats towed by twelve steamers {{embarked}} {{the first six}} companies, two each from the 9th, 10th and 11th Battalions. At 02:00 a Turkish sentry reported seeing ships moving at <b>sea,</b> <b>and</b> at 02:30 the report was sent to 9th Division's headquarters. At 02:53 the ships headed towards the peninsula, continuing until 03:30 when the larger ships stopped. With 50 yards (46m) to go, the rowing boats continued using only their oars.|$|E

50|$|The manaul is {{a mythical}} king {{who became a}} bird. He was {{believed}} to have caused the <b>seas</b> <b>and</b> the skies to fight against each other. The clash between the <b>seas</b> <b>and</b> skies resulted {{to the formation of}} the Philippine islands.|$|R

5|$|For Asian stocks, {{resident}} {{groups may}} {{exist in the}} Yellow <b>Sea</b> <b>and</b> East China <b>Sea,</b> <b>and</b> the Sea of Japan (though these populations are critically endangered and the population off China, Korea, and Japan are either near extinction or in very small numbers). Very small increases in sightings have been confirmed off Shiretoko Peninsula, Abashiri, and Kushiro in Hokkaido, Tsushima, Sado Island, off Maiduru in the Sea of Japan since in late 2000s as whales in Sea of Okhotsk might have started recolonizing into former habitats (for coastal Sakhalin, as well). Whales possibly used to migrated into Seto Inland Sea.|$|E
5|$|Fort Ricasoli has an {{irregular}} plan following the coastline {{of the peninsula}} it is built upon. The fort consists of a bastioned land front and its outworks, an enceinte facing the <b>sea,</b> <b>and</b> a tenaille trace facing Rinella Bay of the Grand Harbour.|$|E

40|$|<b>Seas</b> <b>and</b> oceans {{are confronted}} with a plethora of {{environmental}} problems, caused by land-based activities (agriculture, industries, and ports) and by maritime activities (such as shipping, fishing, oil and gas drilling, tourism, and navigational dredging). Environmental problems at sea challenge the efficacy of state sovereignty. Who is responsible, accountable, and regulates environmental and spatial problems {{at the level of}} regional <b>seas,</b> <b>and</b> {{what is the role of}} states in these processes of governance? In the regional <b>seas</b> <b>and</b> on the high seas, the environmental state is challenged by two developments: states become players at different levels, and states {{are confronted with}} the activities of big market players where they have no or little jurisdiction. The different forms of the environmental state in Europe’s regional <b>seas</b> <b>and</b> in the Arctic Ocean are examined...|$|R
40|$|A coupled {{model is}} {{developed}} {{to investigate the}} dynamic interaction between an offshore pile, a porous <b>seabed</b> <b>and</b> seawater when subjected to the pseudo-Stoneley wave along the <b>seabed</b> <b>and</b> the seawater interface. The pile <b>and</b> the <b>seabed</b> are treated as the porous medium governed by Biot's theory, while the seawater is considered as an acoustic medium and is described by the conventional Helmholtz equation. The free field solution of the incident pseudo-Stoneley wave is obtained using Biot's theory and the potential method. Based on the boundary element method (BEM) for the porous medium and the acoustic medium, three BEM formulations are constructed for the pile, the <b>seabed</b> <b>and</b> the seawater, respectively, which are combined together using the continuity conditions between the pile, the <b>seabed</b> <b>and</b> the seawater to formulate the coupled model for the system. As shown in numerical examples, when the system is subjected to the pseudo-Stoneley wave, the maximum pore pressure of the seabed usually occurs at the region near the interfaces between the <b>seabed</b> <b>and</b> the seawater.

50|$|The 1997 treaty {{essentially}} {{separates the}} sovereignty of the <b>seabed</b> <b>and</b> water column in the area between the water column boundary <b>and</b> the <b>seabed</b> boundary, whereby Australia has sovereignty over the <b>seabed</b> <b>and</b> its resources, while Indonesia has sovereignty over the water column and the resources which live in it.|$|R
5|$|In Southeast Asia, the {{importance}} of the sea gave rise to many myths of epic ocean voyages, princesses on distant islands, monsters and magical fish lurking in the deep. In Northern Europe, kings were sometimes given ship burials when the body was laid in a vessel surrounded by treasure and costly cargo and set adrift on the sea. In North America, various creation stories have a duck or other creature dive {{to the bottom of the}} <b>sea</b> <b>and</b> bring up some mud out of which the dry land was formed. Atargatis was a Syrian deity known as the mermaid-goddess and Sedna was the goddess of the <b>sea</b> <b>and</b> marine animals in Inuit mythology.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the canal crossing, Egypt laid a successful naval blockade against Israel in the Red <b>Sea</b> <b>and</b> Mediterranean Sea. The 1973 war is commemorated in a special Egyptian museum, the 6th of October Panorama in Cairo and in Damascus.|$|E
5|$|In the Croatian {{part of the}} Adriatic Sea, {{there are}} 718 islands, 389 islets and 78 reefs, making the Croatian {{archipelago}} {{the largest in the}} Adriatic <b>Sea</b> <b>and</b> the second largest in the Mediterranean Sea, the Greek archipelago being the largest.|$|E
50|$|The {{spot-tail shark}} spends the day near the <b>seabed</b> <b>and</b> {{the night at}} the surface, most {{frequently}} around reefs. It is a predator and feeds on bony fish such as bonito <b>and</b> <b>sea</b> bass, cephalopods <b>and</b> crustaceans.|$|R

5|$|Offshore oil and {{gas from}} North <b>Sea</b> <b>and</b> Irish <b>Sea,</b> <b>and</b> more {{recently}} offshore wind, are significant components in Northern England's energy mix. Although deep-pit coal mining in the UK ended in 2015 with the closure of Kellingley Colliery, North Yorkshire, there are also several open-pit mines in the area. Shale gas is especially prevalent across Northern England, although plans to extract it through hydraulic fracturing ("fracking") {{have proven to be}} controversial.|$|E

30|$|The East Asian {{marginal}} seas are {{bounded by}} volcanic arcs on their eastern sides, and these provide considerable amounts of volcanic {{material to the}} marginal <b>seas</b> <b>and</b> western Pacific region. This volcanic ash, {{in addition to being}} indicative of volcanism and tectonism through time, is an extremely powerful tool that facilitates high-precision correlation between land and ocean, within and among the marginal <b>seas,</b> <b>and</b> also between the marginal <b>seas</b> <b>and</b> the northwestern Pacific Ocean. Basic data on the chemical composition and stratigraphic position of volcanic ash layers (tephras) surrounding Japan are relatively abundant. Ikehara (2015) presents a tephrochronology for Japan <b>and</b> surrounding <b>seas</b> <b>and</b> demonstrates its utility from various aspects. The data presented provide an important approach {{that can be used to}} refine the existing regional chronostratigraphy and will serve as a new tool for various aspects of paleoclimatic and paleoceanographical research.|$|R
