40|$|<b>Self-replicating</b> <b>molecules</b> {{are likely}} to have {{played a central role in}} the origin of life. Most {{scenarios}} of Darwinian evolution at the molecular level require self-replicators capable of exponential growth, yet only very few exponential replicators have been reported to date and general design criteria for exponential replication are lacking. Here we show that a peptide-functionalized macrocyclic self-replicator exhibits exponential growth when subjected to mild agitation. The replicator self-assembles into elongated fibres of which the ends promote replication and fibre growth. Agitation results in breakage of the growing fibres, generating more fibre ends. Our data suggest a mechanism in which mechanical energy promotes the liberation of the replicator from the inactive self-assembled state, thereby overcoming self-inhibition that prevents the majority of <b>self-replicating</b> <b>molecules</b> developed to date from attaining exponential growth...|$|R

40|$|A {{class of}} generic models of protocells is introduced,which are {{inspired}} by the Los Alamos bug hypothesis but which,due to their abstraction level, {{can be applied to}} a wider set ofdetailed protocell hypotheses. These models describe the coupledgrowth of the lipid container and of the <b>self-replicating</b> <b>molecules.</b> A technique to analyze the dynamics of populations of such protocellsis described, which couples a continuous-time formalism for thegrowth between two successive cell divisions, and a discrete mapthat relates the quantity of <b>self-replicating</b> <b>molecules</b> in successivegenerations. This technique allows one to derive several properties inan analytical way. It is shown that, under fairly general assumptions,the two growth rates synchronize, so that the lipid container doublesits size when the number of <b>self-replicating</b> <b>molecules</b> has alsodoubled—thus giving rise to exponential growth of the populationof protocells. Such synchronization had been postulated a priori inprevious models of protocells; here it is an emergent property. We alsocompare the rate of duplication of two populations generated by twodifferent protocells with different kinds of self-replicating molecules,considering the interesting case where the rate of self-replicationof one kind is higher than that of the other, but its contribution tothe container growth rate is smaller. It is shown that in this case thepopulation of offspring of the protocell with the faster-replicatingmolecule will eventually grow faster than the other. The case wheretwo different types of self-replicating monomers are present inthe same protocell is also analyzed, and it is shown that, if thereplication follows a first-order kinetic equation, then the fasterreplicator eventually displaces the slower one, whereas if the growthis sublinear the two coexist.

40|$|Recently it {{has been}} argued that autocatalytic theory could be applied to the origin of culture. Here {{possible}} application to a theory of meaning in the philosophy of language, called radical interpretation, is commented upon and compared to previous applications. 1 Autocatalytic theory of the Origin of Life. Gabora (1998) [2] discusses the autocatalytic theory of the origin of life in sections 26 - 32. Instead of having one <b>self-replicating</b> <b>molecule,</b> there are a set of molecules each of which can replicate a different member of the set. The appearance of such a set may or may not be more likely than the appearance of a single <b>self-replicating</b> <b>molecule.</b> Also such a set may or may not evolve at a fast rate conditioned by selection. 2 Autocatalytic theory of the Origin of Culture. From sections 33 - 60 Gabora investigates whether a similar mechanism could explain the origin of human culture. There are various aspects of human culture the origin of which calls for explanation. The central problem is to explain how the mind transforms from being episodic, or only being capable of recalling episodes, to being capable of abstraction. Once the ability to abstract is present it will be selected for and increase, because abstraction allows for creative acts. The transition to an abstracting mind could originate by happening once and then developing- this is the analogy of the self-replicating molecule; or there could be several ideas occurring at once which by chance help in problem solving- this is the analog of a set of molecules each of which replicate a different member of the set. 1 3 Autocatalytic approach to Language Acquisi-tion.

40|$|A <b>self-replicating</b> <b>molecule</b> {{directs the}} {{covalent}} assembly of component molecules {{to form a}} product that is of identical composition to the parent. When the newly formed product also is able to direct the assembly of product molecules, the self-replicating system can be termed autocatalytic. A self-replicating system was developed based on a ribozyme that catalyzes the assembly of additional copies of itself through an RNA-catalyzed RNA ligation reaction. The R 3 C ligase ribozyme was redesigned {{so that it would}} ligate two substrates to generate an exact copy of itself, which then would behave in a similar manner. This self-replicating system depends on the catalytic nature of the RNA for the generation of copies. A linear dependence was observed between the initial rate of formation of new copies and the starting concentration of ribozyme, consistent with exponential growth. The autocatalytic rate constant was 0. 011 min− 1, whereas the initial rate of reaction in the absence of pre-existing ribozyme was only 3. 3 × 10 − 11 M⋅min− 1. Exponential growth was limited, however, because newly formed ribozyme molecules had greater difficulty forming a productive complex with the two substrates. Further optimization of the system may lead to the sustained exponential growth of ribozymes that undergo self-replication...|$|E
40|$|The biggest {{challenge}} for origin-of-life scientists is {{to account for}} the first <b>self-replicating</b> <b>molecule.</b> Genes are needed to make proteins and proteins are needed to make genes, so which came first? The answer is in ribozymes probably, RNA molecules capable of both coding and catalysis. An earlier, simpler biology might have relied on RNA for both heredity and metabolism. Evidence for such an “RNA world”, preceding modern life includes the central catalytic and informational roles of RNA in splicing, gene expression, and translation, as well as the versatility of RNA in forming specific receptors and catalysts. Forming the glycosidic link between the nucleoside bases and ribose is thought to be the most difficult step in prebiotic nucleotide synthesis in the presumed scarcity of RNA nucleotides on the prebiotic earth. Organisms of the putative RNA world would have required an RNA polymerase ribozyme for both RNA-based heredity and the expression of “RNA genes”. In vitro evolution of nucleic acids involve typically randomized synthetic DNA libraries that are either selected directly for desired binding or catalytic activities, or are transcribed into RNA prior to selection. The DNA –encoding molecules with desired activities are amplified (and in some cases intentionally diversified) either by PCR or by reverse transcription followed by PCR. The N at u...|$|E
30|$|Finally, {{in closing}} this section we briefly mention the 'metabolism first' vs. 'replication first' controversy, a long {{standing}} {{question at the}} heart of the origin of life debate [35, 63]. In the absence of historical data that can throw light on the question of whether life began through the emergence of some replicating system which then complexified, or with the initial emergence of an autocatalytic metabolic network, a definitive resolution of the question appears unlikely. Nevertheless, having a physicochemical model that provides a basis for the transformation of inanimate to animate could provide useful insights. As the general model described above makes clear, the essence of life derives from the unique kinetic characteristics associated with autocatalysis. That, in turn, suggests that all models for the emergence of life should be analyzed with respect to that critical element. So did life begin with some primal metabolic system that was holistically autocatalytic, as proposed by the 'metabolism first' school of thought, or with some <b>self-replicating</b> <b>molecule,</b> as proposed by the 'replication first' school of thought? Consider, Joyce's work has recently demonstrated that a single RNA enzyme with its constituent building blocks is a poor replicator and is unable to bring about sustainable replication. However, the cooperative cross-catalytic system involving two RNA enzymes was able to generate a self-sustained system [31]. This key result suggests that both template-directed autocatalysis and network formation may well have been critical elements in the emergence of life, most likely closely synchronized. That being the case, we would argue that the 'replication first' - 'metabolism first' debate, as a fundamental issue in the Origin of Life debate, may no longer be of real relevance, and should be replaced with a bridging 'replication and metabolism together' scenario. Simply put, complexification (of the special kind found in biology) could not have taken place without replication, and replication without complexification had nowhere to go. The idea that the distinction between 'replication first' and 'metabolism first' schools of thought may be largely artificial was recently expressed by Eschenmoser [64].|$|E
40|$|The {{quest for}} {{the origin of life}} {{requires}} the understanding of how the cells, the simplest living organisms, could have assembled from simple molecules to the point of bearing fundamental properties as self-replication (i. e. the ability to make copies of itself) and being capable of converting food into energy. This thesis focuses on the behavior of <b>self-replicating</b> <b>molecules</b> under different experimental conditions. The ultimate aim would be to give rise to a fully synthetic system that can be defined as “living”. Our group recently discovered that a class of simple building blocks could give rise to <b>self-replicating</b> <b>molecules.</b> Taking inspiration from living entities, we subjected the building blocks to different environments, finding that different replicators emerge accordingly; the change in environment was obtained {{with the addition of a}} second solvent other than water in the samples containing the building blocks. The population of replicators in a sample also changes if a gradual change in environment is being applied. Furthermore, competition between two replicators in a specific environment can be observed if they need common resources to maintain their own population. Finally, studies on mixtures of replicators to give rise to evolutionary pathways (similar to evolution of biological species) are reported. The same class of molecules has also been employed in the development of small-sized polymers with a narrow range of lengths, showing therefore their versatility and demonstrating we can control their properties...|$|R
40|$|<b>Self-replicating</b> <b>molecules</b> play a {{fundamental}} role in origins of life studies. In Chapter 2, evidence is provided that specific <b>self-replicating</b> <b>molecules</b> {{are capable of}} growing exponentially. This is a very important breakthrough: exponentially growing replicators are better prone to survive during Darwinian evolution. Almost all replicators discovered up to the latest years were not capable of exponential growth. Primordial life likely resulted from repeated attempts of replication in a destructive environment. This replication and destruction process {{is at the core of}} Darwinian evolution. In Chapter 3, such a replication/destruction system is studied experimentally and computationally. Based on these studies, it is possible to set up an experimental system where the replicators are constantly broken down into building blocks, and where the latter replicate again. Computer simulations allow the determination of optimal energy coupling conditions for such systems. In Chapter 4, information exchange pathways in peptide fibres were studied. The results show that the exchange of building blocks from one fibre to another one takes place at the extremities thereof, while building blocks in the fibre cores are hardly used in the replication of other fibres. These are therefore protected from replication and the information that they carry can hardly be exchanged, unless the fibres continuously break into smaller pieces. While in our experiments Darwinian evolution does not yet take place, we could observe significant processes for enabling Darwinian evolution: exponential growth of fibres, destruction of replicators and selective exchange of building blocks...|$|R
