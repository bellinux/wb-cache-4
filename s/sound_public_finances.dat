In the first stage, known as statutory autonomy (1925 - 1938), autonomy was formalized through rules which established ceilings to the growth of key operative variables. The next stage, known as charismatic autonomy (1955 - 1970), relied on the defense by important political figures on the central bank´s role. <b>Sound</b> <b>public</b> <b>finances</b> were a significant aid in this stage. The end of <b>sound</b> <b>public</b> <b>finances</b> signaled the termination of the central bank´s charismatic autonomy. The last stage, known as institutional autonomy (1994 to date), is certainly more robust.

Right-financing is therefore essentially about determining an acceptable supply of financing for government and private sector entities as they look to deliver higher-quality and more equitable services over time. Establishing the right policy, institutional, financing, debt and loan, revenue, fiscal, monetary and security decisions early on in the investment phase is therefore essential to establishing an effective economic growth policy, institutional and risk management framework.|$|R

The results show, for the whole sample considered, that - contrary to the accounting rules - the higher is the structural balance the higher is the debt especially after 2009. In regard to the effect on overall and primary public balance, the accounting relationship is confirmed for the whole period, while less than proportional for the two sub-samples.

40|$|The {{international}} community has invested {{a significant amount of}} resources to limit corruption in developing countries and institute <b>sound</b> <b>public</b> <b>finance</b> management systems.

Notwithstanding this trend, the quest for achieving transparency and participation in the budget process has become part of the general rubric of national developments.

40|$|Countries in the European Monetary Union {{have been}} {{divided into two}} major blocks {{according}} {{to their ability to}} respect fiscal criteria and ensure <b>sound</b> <b>public</b> <b>finance.</b> The widespread belief is that this ability influences the interest rate financial markets apply, the sustainability of deficit and debt and the long-run growth.

The aim {{of this paper is to}} show that the financial stability is realized at expenses of a lower targeted output, rather than representing the premise of a greater growth. When a negative shock occurs the deficit/GDP ratio goes up and sends the signal that governments are loosening their fiscal stance, so that financial markets increase the interest rates applied. Due to aggregate demand effect of the sharp increase in refinancing costs, deficit grows greater and greater causing unsustainability of <b>public</b> <b>finance.</b> Hence national policy authorities, following Emu prescriptions, accept to reduce public expenditure regardless the level of output and employment to be reached.

40|$|Sovereign {{credit risk}} is {{currently}} a significant issue for European banks and over coming years may have implications for global financial stability. This report examines the relationship between sovereign credit risk and bank funding conditions, how banks might respond to an environment of ongoing elevated sovereign risk and the implications for policy makers. It was prepared by a Study Group chaired by Fabio Panetta from the Bank of Italy. The report concludes that increases in sovereign credit risk push up the cost and weaken the composition of banks' funding, and that banks cannot fully insulate themselves by adjusting their operations. As a consequence, the official sector has {{a key role in}} minimising the impact of weaker <b>public</b> <b>finance</b> conditions on banks, but there are trade-offs. First and foremost, governments need to maintain <b>sound</b> <b>public</b> <b>finance</b> conditions. Bank supervisors should also closely monitor the interaction of sovereign risk with regulatory policies that encourage banks to hold large quantities of public debt. Central banks might also consider having flexible collateral frameworks that, during severe crises, allow funding to be supplied against a broad range of collateral, but this is not costless, and hence should be used sparingly and with appropriate safeguards in place. ...|$|R

As a consequence, some countries are asked to achieve severe retrenchment to restore financial market confidence. The aim {{of this paper is to}} show that the increase in government bond yields is not directly linked to default probability; rather it is due to liquidity needs that cannot be satisfied on domestic markets. In times of crisis the deficit/GDP ratio goes up and sends the signal that governments are loosening their fiscal stance. As long as there are liquidity constraints, foreign markets increase the interest rates applied and, due to the sharp increase in refinancing costs, force governments into fiscal retrenchments. The latter have little probability of success because of their effect upon real GDP. The high cost of exiting from the EMU makes devaluation highly unlikely and gives financial markets – lacking a common policy structure - the power to exert political pressure without having sovereignty...|$|R

The first nine years of the euro were not used effectively in order to improve public finances, while the Stability and Growth Pact was watered down.

While we respect the fact that the question of the mo- netary policy sovereignty in these countries at the present stage of economic integration is rather disputable (in situation when new EU member countries are strongly oriented toward the old EU member countries' markets and considering their high trade and financial openness, the exchange rate and the domestic interest rates are significantly affected by the exogenous determinants that are out of range of the domestic monetary authorities), at the same time we can't underestimate the stabilization role of the national monetary policies. The Stability and GrovAh Pact and the Maastricht convergence criteria are one of the key deter- minants that affect the medium-term character of the fiscal policy in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic. <b>Public</b> <b>finance</b> consolidation is then shaped by the explicitly defined parameters and corresponding fiscal policy objectives should aim the <b>sound</b> <b>public</b> <b>finance</b> development.
