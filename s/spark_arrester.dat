2500|$|The boiler was {{designed}} with a <b>spark</b> <b>arrester</b> which captured combusted {{material from the}} firebox, automatically hosed down the material with water, and discharged it into the river through a port in the hull. [...] This kept the upper decks clean from soot which {{would otherwise have been}} exhausted through the smokestack and reduced the amount of paint needed for the cabins.|$|E
2500|$|The {{components}} of Multnomah were {{manufactured in the}} eastern United States, then shipped to Oregon City, Oregon around Cape Horn on the bark Success. [...] At that time, there were no locks at Willamette Falls, so {{it was important to}} determine whether a boat would be built above or below the falls. [...] In the case of Multnomah, the vessel was assembled at Canemah, a settlement above the falls. [...] This allowed the vessel to run on the upper Willamette, running south from Canemah through the Willamette Valley. [...] Multnomah 's hull was barrel-shaped, and held in shape with iron hoops which made caulking unnecessary. [...] The Multnomah was a sidewheeler, as were all the boats operating in Oregon before 1854. [...] The vessel's funnel was equipped with a <b>spark</b> <b>arrester.</b>|$|E

50|$|Laws {{governing}} <b>spark</b> <b>arrester</b> {{use in the}} United States {{depend on}} the jurisdiction. Internal combustion engines operating on USDA Forest Service and most other federally managed lands must {{meet the requirements of}} the Code of Federal Regulations 36 CFR 261.52. This mandate requires the operator to have a certified and properly maintained <b>spark</b> <b>arrester</b> installed at all times. Many state and local land management agencies defer to the federal requirement.Exemptions exist for automobiles legally registered with their state's department of motor vehicles. During periods of extreme fire danger, land managers may prevent the use of all motorized equipment, even if a properly functioning <b>spark</b> <b>arrester</b> is installed. <b>Spark</b> <b>arrester</b> inspections are performed by trained agency law enforcement or fire prevention personnel. They may occur on an individual basis, or as part of an inspection checkpoint during busy recreation weekends. Operators caught using unqualified or modified devices could be cited. Penalties for violating <b>spark</b> <b>arrester</b> laws depend on the issuing agency. If it is determined a noncompliant vehicle was responsible for starting a fire, the operator could be held liable in civil or even criminal court.|$|E
50|$|Today, <b>spark</b> <b>arresters</b> can {{be found}} as OEM or {{aftermarket}} components on many types of equipment, such as large agricultural machines, off highway vehicles (OHVs), and small engines (chainsaws, string trimmers, leaf blowers, etc.).|$|R
50|$|The <b>spark</b> <b>arresters</b> {{were made}} from {{perforated}} plate, arranged in V-shape and attached to movable wings which were hinged to the blast pipe {{so that they could}} be moved aside when the tubes were being cleaned.|$|R
50|$|The locomotives, {{the first}} Cape gauge engines to enter service in Natal, were {{designed}} for wood-burning and were therefore equipped with American style balloon smokestacks which incorporated <b>spark</b> <b>arresters.</b> They used Salter safety valves and had axle-driven boiler feed-water pumps, placed between the frames.|$|R

50|$|A <b>spark</b> <b>arrester</b> {{is often}} {{installed}} within the smokebox. This {{may take the}} form of a cylindrical mesh running from the top of the blast pipe to the bottom of the chimney. The purpose of a <b>spark</b> <b>arrester</b> is to prevent excessively large fragments of hot ash from being exhausted into the environment where they may pose a fire risk. For this reason, spark arresters are generally installed on locomotives running through dry environments. They should not be confused with the external spark arrestors fitted to some locomotives. The presence of a <b>spark</b> <b>arrester</b> may have a thermodynamic effect, distorting the draw of air over the fire and thereby reducing total power output. Thus their use can be contentious.|$|E
5000|$|Certification {{testing of}} spark arresters is {{performed}} by the USDA Forest Service Technology and Development Center in San Dimas, CA. The technical requirements are outlined in Forest Service Specification FS5100-1. All spark arresters meeting the requirements of 36 CFR 261.52 must be certified and listed in the USDA Forest Service <b>Spark</b> <b>Arrester</b> Guide. This guide is a comprehensive directory of all qualified products available in the United States, and is published biannually. The <b>Spark</b> <b>Arrester</b> Guide is used by field inspectors and consumers to verify product certification status. Manufacturers pursuing <b>spark</b> <b>arrester</b> qualification in the United States should consult the USDA Forest Service's [...] "Manufacturer's Submission Procedure" [...] for both general purpose and small engine [...] spark arresters.|$|E
50|$|In 1882, two 4-4-0 American type tank locomotives, {{with works}} numbers 294 and 295, were {{delivered}} from Hunslet Engine Company to the Grahamstown and Port Alfred Railway Company. The locomotives were acquired for passenger working and were named Grahamstown and Bathurst respectively. They {{were designed for}} wood-burning and were equipped with large American-style balloon smokestacks which incorporated <b>spark</b> <b>arresters.</b>|$|R
50|$|In early 1897, six Converted Joy {{locomotives}} {{were sold}} to the Oranje-Vrijstaat Gouwerment-Spoorwegen (OVGS), where they were designated 4th Class G. These engines were all fitted with the Tilney-designed extended smokebox with <b>spark</b> <b>arresters</b> and had been reboilered prior to entering service on the OVGS. During reboilering, their Salter safety valves were replaced with the Ramsbottom type.|$|R
50|$|In late 1896, some {{of these}} {{locomotives}} were sold to the Oranje-Vrijstaat Gouwerment-Spoorwegen, where they retained their classification as 3rd Class. The sale most probably involved the five locomotives whose numbers were absent from the CGR roster {{for the first time}} by year-end 1896, as listed in the table. These engines were later fitted with the Tilney-design extended type of smokebox with <b>spark</b> <b>arresters.</b>|$|R

50|$|By then, {{the engine}} Stormberg was {{sporting}} a balloon-type <b>spark</b> <b>arrester</b> on its chimney and a headlight {{mounted on a}} shelf attached {{to the front of}} the smokebox.|$|E
50|$|A <b>spark</b> <b>arrester</b> (sometimes spark arrestor) is any device which {{prevents}} the emission of flammable debris from combustion sources, such as internal combustion engines, fireplaces, and wood burning stoves.|$|E
50|$|Compared to {{the second}} batch of 5th Class {{locomotives}} which were to be delivered a year later in 1891, it had a short smokebox on which the chimney {{was so close to}} the front of the smokebox that the headlight had to be mounted on a platform, attached {{to the front of the}} smokebox. The smokeboxes were later extended to suit South Africa's low-grade coal and to make room for wire-netting <b>spark</b> <b>arresters.</b>|$|R
50|$|Modern {{technologies}} have largely eliminated {{the production of}} large particulate matter from internal combustion engines. However, as engines wear, carbon deposits can build up on the internal walls of the engine. When these deposits break free, they exit through the exhaust system and present a potential fire hazard. Vehicles without properly functioning <b>spark</b> <b>arresters</b> have been suspected of starting numerous wildfires, including the devastating track fire near Raton, New Mexico in June 2011.|$|R
50|$|Wildfires were a {{constant}} consideration {{during the dry}} and hot seasons at Fort Eustis, and special care {{had to be taken}} with ash pans and <b>spark</b> screens (<b>spark</b> <b>arresters)</b> on steam locomotives and with carbon deposits breaking loose and flying from diesel-electric locomotives. Train crews were cautioned to be alert to defects or operating conditions that could lead to the setting of fires and to take corrective or ameliorating action to remove or minimize the chances of setting a trackside fire.|$|R
50|$|Another {{modification}} by Tilney was {{an extended}} smokebox {{to make room}} for a very efficient <b>spark</b> <b>arrester</b> which was constructed of wire mesh. Several locomotives were altered to incorporate these spark arresters.|$|E
50|$|Screen type spark arresters use a {{physical}} mesh to prevent large particles from leaving the exhaust system. This is {{the simplest and}} {{most common type of}} <b>spark</b> <b>arrester.</b> Screen type devices are used on most motorcycles, ATVs, and small engines.|$|E
50|$|Another {{modification}} by Tilney was {{an extended}} smokebox, {{to make room}} for a very efficient <b>spark</b> <b>arrester</b> which was constructed of wire mesh. Several locomotives were altered to incorporate these spark arresters, as shown in the photograph alongside of a locomotive with an extended smokebox.|$|E
5000|$|These {{were the}} first Cape gauge {{locomotives}} to enter service on the NGR. As built, the first five locomotives were identical in appearance to the two contractor's locomotives and were also wood-burners, equipped with balloon smokestacks with <b>spark</b> <b>arresters.</b> Tenders had been called on 1 March 1877, {{well in advance of}} their arrival, for the supply of [...] "10 tons of blue gum and 10 tons of thornwood per month" [...] as [...] "firewood for the locomotives on the NGR".|$|R
50|$|The Pug twins {{shared a}} water tank which was {{arranged}} between their engine frames and had chimneys with balloon-type <b>spark</b> <b>arresters.</b> The wheel {{arrangement of the}} individual engines is not known, but the boiler pressure was set at , the total heating surface of the boiler was 154 sq ft, the firegrate area was 3.65 sq ft and the tractive effort at 50% of boiler pressure was 2150 lbf kN. The boiler pitch was 3 ft and the engine weight in working order was 7 lt 0 lcwt 3 qtr kg.|$|R
50|$|The Zwillinge could {{negotiate}} {{curves of}} 66 ft and could haul loads of 32 lt t up a 1 in 25 (4%) gradient. They had balloon-type <b>spark</b> <b>arresters</b> in their chimneys and were coal-fired, the coal being imported from Germany. The steam regulator was arranged outside the high steam dome and, on some, two sandboxes were arranged {{on top of}} the boiler, fore and aft of the dome, while others had two small cylindrical sandboxes attached to the smokebox. They had flat Murdoch's D slide valves which were actuated by Stephenson valve gear, arranged outside the 5/8 in plate frames.|$|R
50|$|The Namaqua Copper Company {{acquired}} {{its first}} steam locomotive from Dick, Kerr & Company in 1901. It was named Pioneer and was constructed as a wood-burning 0-4-0 saddle-tank engine with a balloon chimney which contained a <b>spark</b> <b>arrester.</b> The locomotive had a fuel rack mounted {{on top of}} the tank, ahead of the cab.|$|E
50|$|In 1964, {{the engine}} Stormberg was {{refurbished}} at Germiston before being {{taken back to}} East London, where it was plinthed at East London station. It finally ended up as an exhibit in the Outeniqua Transport Museum in George. At some stage between being in storage at Germiston and becoming a museum exhibit, the <b>spark</b> <b>arrester,</b> headlight and headlight mount were removed.|$|E
50|$|Several {{modifications}} {{were made}} to the locomotives after they were placed in service. With the advent of Welsh coal, the balloon smokestacks of the first five engines were replaced by tall flared chimneys, with the <b>spark</b> <b>arrester</b> inside the smokebox. The flared chimneys were later brass-capped. On some, the smokebox was enlarged by extending it to within 3 in of the buffer beam.|$|E
500|$|The first months' service did {{not meet}} Hulin's expectations; {{passenger}} numbers were much lower than expected, the coefficient of use was catastrophic: 0.39. In 1906 a law was passed instituting a weekly day of rest, so it was decided, from 12 January 1907, to extend the line [...] to the Madrillet roundabout {{at the edge of}} the Rouvray Forest, which was popular for Sunday walks. This [...] double-track extension was inaugurated on 27 August 1907. The same year, diesel-electric locomotives (whose [...] "terrible noise" [...] frightened the horses, to the chagrin of their owners) were replaced by electromotive traction. Two Orenstein & Koppel 0-4-0T steam locomotives headed two open carriages each taking 16 passengers. Their chimneys were fitted with <b>spark</b> <b>arresters</b> to prevent forest fires around Rouvray.|$|R
50|$|By 1897 Prior had {{developed}} {{his theory of}} texture. Prior {{tried to find a}} way beyond historical style and vernacular logic. The wall surfaces are highly textured, incorporating the philosophy Prior expounded in his paper. The cavity walls are of brick, with a locally quarried red sandstone outer leaf. Pebbles from the beach and river are embedded in the mass concrete, adding pattern and texture to the walls. The stone is roughly dressed, uncoursed and varied by the inclusion of large boulders. The building was originally thatched. The large chimney stacks were lined with terracotta flues and cased in sandstone with <b>spark</b> <b>arresters.</b> The upper floors were constructed of concrete reinforced with nine inch logs at two and a half foot centres. This was partly done as fireproofing.|$|R
