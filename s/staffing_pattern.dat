30|$|The second {{question}} {{in the context of}} this study is how innovative performance is related to the different <b>staffing</b> <b>patterns.</b> For example, is innovative performance positively related to rejuvenation by inflows of younger workers? We expect that the interplay between <b>staffing</b> <b>patterns</b> and innovativeness varies across dominance and growth regime. In particular, we propose that dominant firms are in any case able to attract and retain the most motivated, loyal and creative workers within each segment, and to shed less prolific workers. It therefore does not matter whether the company experiences staffing dynamics that are considered favorable to innovation. An alternative proposition is that <b>staffing</b> <b>patterns</b> only have an effect on innovation for dominant firms, because dominated firms are left with less able and motivated workers even if they, for example, rejuvenate. To investigate these conflicting propositions, we relate innovative output to <b>staffing</b> <b>patterns</b> within dominance and growth regimes.|$|R

30|$|Frosch, Göbel and Zwick (“Separating Wheat and Chaff: Age-related <b>Staffing</b> <b>Patterns</b> and Innovation at the Establishment Level”) {{investigate}} to {{what extent}} the innovative capacity of German firms is influenced by their <b>staffing</b> <b>patterns.</b> They find that most of the 585 German establishments covered in their analysis rejuvenate their workforce through inflows of younger workers, and that half of them also do so through the outflow of older workers. Their results indicate that firms’ innovative performance is not significantly related to staffing patterns: Innovation is not demonstrably fostered by either the inflow of young professionals or by the retention of older experienced workers.|$|R
30|$|Up to now, we {{have only}} {{described}} the staffing patterns that the German establishments covered by our analysis have experienced in the years 1998 / 1999 and 2001 / 2002. To confirm that {{the differences in the}} staffing patterns as identified for different regimes of growth and dominance are actually statistically relevant, we have conducted significance tests on the share of establishments in each regime that experience the <b>staffing</b> <b>pattern</b> into question. However, unobserved heterogeneity, because, for example, general upwards or downwards trends in employment in different age groups lead to typical staffing patterns in different industries, may confound our results. To reduce potential biases that may arise from the fact that we did not control for such issues, we first compute indicators for the five staffing patterns as deviations from the median in the industry the establishment operates in, and only then differentiate between establishments that have the respective <b>staffing</b> <b>pattern</b> {{to a greater or lesser}} extent than the median establishment in the same industry.|$|E
30|$|Spurious {{correlations}} between {{the emergence of a}} certain <b>staffing</b> <b>pattern</b> in a certain growth or dominance regime are only of concern if there is a significant heterogeneity with respect to a confounding factor related to both the <b>staffing</b> <b>pattern</b> and the regime of growth and dominance. We thereby concentrate on the three staffing patterns that display significant differences across regimes, according to our results in Table  3. Indeed, the finding that larger establishments with older and longer-tenured workforces rejuvenate more often, both by the inflow of younger and the outflow of older workers, and, at the same time, are less represented among growing firms, provides an alternative explanation for why growing firms rejuvenate less often than downsizing firms, as found in Table  3. However, the finding that growing and dominant establishments rejuvenate far more frequently, based on the inflow of younger workers, than growing dominated establishments should not be the result of a spurious correlation, as the relevant confounding factors are unrelated to the dominance regime (see Table A. 5).|$|E
30|$|Rejuvenation {{through the}} outflow of older workers {{is a less}} {{pronounced}} <b>staffing</b> <b>pattern.</b> Overall, only 42 percent of all establishments rejuvenate because their shares of older workers among all separations exceed the share of older workers in the total workforce. Moreover, {{the differences between the}} share of older workers among hires and among the total workforce are mostly marginal. The most striking exception are dominant-downsizing firms, in which the share of older workers among separations exceeds the share of older employees in the total workforce by more than six percentage points.|$|E
30|$|However, even if {{dominant}} {{firms are}} better able to implement staffing strategies identified as promising based on observable worker characteristics, such as age or tenure—simply implementing these strategies may or may not lead to increased innovative performance, as success strongly depends on a firm’s ability to attract and retain the most motivated, loyal and creative workers within each segment, and to shed less prolific workers. With respect to the effect of <b>staffing</b> <b>patterns</b> on innovative performance among dominant versus dominated firms, two conflicting assumptions are possible. On the one hand, the above-described <b>staffing</b> <b>patterns</b> may have a more pronounced (positive) effect on innovative performance for dominant firms than for dominated firms, as they hire and retain the most prolific workers in each of the targeted groups. On the other hand, <b>staffing</b> <b>patterns</b> assumed to be more favorable to innovation may be of little relevance for dominant firms, as they would in any case succeed in recruiting and retaining the most prolific workers, regardless of whether they are, for example, old or young.|$|R
30|$|Firms’ {{innovative}} {{performance is}} measured by the share of turnover achieved with new products and services developed {{in the last two years}} preceding the survey, see Wagner (2008), Criscuolo et al. (2010) or Verworn and Hipp (2009). To characterize the <b>staffing</b> <b>patterns</b> of firms, we compute different indicators based on changes in the firm’s workforces over the two years prior to when innovative performance is observable, i.e., between 1998 (t= 1) and 1999 (t= 2) and between 2001 (t= 1) and 2002 (t= 2) for the innovation indicators in 1999 / 2000 and 2002 / 2003, respectively. Note that indicators related to the <b>staffing</b> <b>patterns</b> are based on full-time equivalents.|$|R

This assessment should examine factors such as <b>staffing</b> <b>patterns,</b> vacancies, salaries, benefits, duties, turnover, and retention.|$|R
30|$|On first view, {{across all}} {{staffing}} patterns, dominant firms under growth display considerable differentials in innovative performance {{depending on whether}} the establishment experiences a certain <b>staffing</b> <b>pattern.</b> For example, in times of workforce growth, the turnover share achieved with new products and services of establishments that rejuvenate by inflows of younger workers is, on average, 5.5 percentage points higher than that of the median firm in the respective industrial sector; whereas for firms without this staffing patterns, the difference from the median firm amounts only to 3.2 percentage points. For dominated firms, it works the other way round, i.e., industry-adjusted innovative performance is lower if the establishment rejuvenates based on inflows of younger workers. Another exemplary result is that increases in workforce age-heterogeneity are related to higher innovative performance in growing, dominant firms, whereas they are associated with lower innovative performance in downsizing, dominated establishment. Initially, dominant firms appear to profit more from favorable strategies than their dominated counterparts, a finding we attribute to the higher ability of dominant establishments to attract and retain the most motivated, loyal and creative workers within each targeted workforce group, and to shed less prolific workers. However, in no group of the firms considered differences in innovative performance are significant, regardless of whether the establishment experiences a certain <b>staffing</b> <b>pattern</b> {{to a greater extent than}} other firms in the same subgroup and industry.|$|E
30|$|Fourth, we also verify {{whether the}} {{methodology}} applied to determine industry-adjusted indicators for innovative {{performance and the}} staffing patterns leads to these inconclusive results. For example, the accuracy of separation may not be high enough if classifying the establishments into groups according to whether they experience a certain <b>staffing</b> <b>pattern</b> depends on whether they display indicator values above or below the industry median. However, applying the 40 th and the 60 th percentiles as lower and upper cut-off points and leaving out the one-fifth of establishments with staffing indicators close to the median establishment in the same industry, {{does not change the}} results.|$|E

The Nursing Intensity Index (Nil) and the GRASP instruments were used for data collection. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used for data analysis. [...] High internal consistency and inter rater reliability were demonstrated for both the Nil and GRASP. Factor analysis generated nine factors to explain 73. 6 % of the variance in GRASP and three factors to explain 59. 4 % {{of the variance in the}} Nil. Nil scores were significantly correlated with GRASP scores indicating a shared variability of 49 %. Regression analysis indicated that seven Nil items explained 55 % of the total GRASP score, thus leaving 45 % of the variability in nursing workload unexplained. Integration of GRASP and Nil data produced a skill mix ratio of 80 percent RN to 20 percent RNA. However, this ratio was not supported by the perceptions of direct caregivers. Methodological and application problems may have influenced this result. More research is needed to identify other factors that may affect skill mix before firm conclusions can be made.

30|$|Several {{explanations}} are possible for this result. First, innovative performance simply {{may not be}} related to the <b>staffing</b> <b>patterns</b> that are the focus of this study, at least if potential systematic co-variation of innovative performance and <b>staffing</b> <b>patterns</b> in industrial sectors is controlled for. That this possibility cannot be simply dismissed is also underlined by the recent results by Verworn and Hipp (2009). They used an innovation indicator that is based on a survey question with the exact wording in our dataset, and did not find any age dependency of innovation. 18 Why then should age-related <b>staffing</b> <b>patterns</b> affect innovation? Still, we should not forget that both our results and those by Verworn and Hipp (2009) are of a purely cross-sectional nature, and the results may be biased by omitted variables or reverse causation. However, as has been extensively discussed in the literature survey, the great majority of estimation biases inflate the contributions of younger workers, and reduce the contributions of older workers to firm performance. Furthermore, as in our case, none of the strategies is significantly related to innovative performance, not even the influx of younger workers, and the usual pattern of estimation biases are clearly not a problem here.|$|R

30|$|This {{directly}} {{leads us}} to the second issue raised in this study: {{not only does it}} appear that dominant firms may be better able to implement staffing strategies favorable to innovation—even if dominant and dominated firms experience the same <b>staffing</b> <b>pattern</b> identified as promising based on observable worker characteristics—but it seems that these staffing strategies may or may not lead to increased innovative performance. According to our results, the innovative performance is not significantly related to any of the staffing patterns.
