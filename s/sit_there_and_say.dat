Describing himself as [...] "an improviser by nature", every day for three weeks Shankar would leave London and head west on the M4, during which he would write the music to be run through with the musicians that day in Friar Park's grand drawing room. Harrison remarked of the process: [...] "It was amazing, because he'd <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> to one person, 'This is where you play,' and the next one, 'And you do this,' and 'You do that,' and they're all going, What? 'OK, one, two, three ...' And you'd think, 'This {{is going to be}} a catastrophe' – and it would be the most amazing thing." [...] The principal sound engineer on the sessions, and Harrison's regular engineer at FPSHOT during this period, was Shankar's nephew Kumar, with Phil McDonald assisting on [...] "Raga Jait" [...] and [...] "Naderdani". Kumar Shankar joined the cast for publicity photos taken by Clive Arrowsmith in the house and grounds.|$|E

5000|$|Ohshima {{was born}} on August 6, 1930, in Japan. By the age of five, he had already begun {{learning}} martial arts. He studied sumo from the ages of 5-15, kendo from 8-15, and judo from 9-13. Recalling an episode from his youth, Ohshima said, [...] "One day I was going to Tokyo. This group was beating one young student {{because he was a}} quiet boy, but something he pushed with his elbow. And this was a ridiculous reason. But these guys were beating this young boy—same age as me, fifteen or sixteen. I got so mad. Mad, because person next to me said, 'Don't go, you get beat up.' I was ashamed of myself. I knew this was injustice. Why couldn't I put myself out there? I could be beaten up, but I could stand it. But I just <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> overlook. I <b>say</b> to myself, 'Alas, how I am a coward guy.' I knew somebody was getting beaten up, but I couldn't help him. Therefore, when I was practicing karate, every time I asked myself, 'Are you ready to put yourself into something that you believe is justice?'" [...] (p. 34).|$|R
2500|$|As a child, {{he loved}} {{television}} and {{was fascinated by}} his parents' 8 mm film home movie camera. Starting off by filming family events like birthdays and holidays, he gradually began producing narrative films with his friends that incorporated stop-motion work and other special effects. Along with enjoying movies, Zemeckis remained an avid TV watcher. [...] "You hear {{so much about the}} problems with television," [...] he said, [...] "but I think that it saved my life." [...] Television gave Zemeckis his first glimpse of a world outside of his blue-collar upbringing; specifically, he learned of the existence of film schools on an episode of The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. After seeing Bonnie and Clyde with his father and being heavily influenced by it, Zemeckis decided that {{he wanted to go to}} film school. His parents disapproved of the idea, Zemeckis later said, [...] "But only in the sense that they were concerned... for my [...] family and my friends and the world that I grew up in, this was the kind of dream that really was impossible. My parents would <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>say,</b> 'Don't you see where you come from? You can't be a movie director.' I guess maybe some of it I felt I had to do in spite of them, too." ...|$|E

2500|$|Describing the {{composition}} of [...] "Oh Yeah", the album's best known track, Blank said, [...] "First I did the music and then I invited Dieter to sing along, and {{he came up with}} some lines which I thought, 'no Dieter, it's too complicated, we don't need that many lyrics'. I had the idea of just this guy, a fat little monster <b>sits</b> <b>there</b> very relaxed <b>and</b> <b>says,</b> [...] "Oh yeah, oh yeah". So I told him, 'Why don't you try just to sing on and on 'oh yeah'?... Dieter was very angry when I told him this and he said, 'are you crazy, all the time [...] "Oh yeah"? Are you crazy?! I can't do this, no no, come on, come on.' And then he said, 'some lyrics, like [...] "the moon... beautiful", is this too much?!' and I said, 'no, it's OK', and then he did this 'oh yeah' and at the end he thought, 'yeah it's nice', he loved it himself also. And also I wanted to install lots of human noises, all kind of phonetic rhythms with my mouth; you hear lots of noises in the background which are done with my mouth." ...|$|R

6000|$|The gossip, led by Noel Vanstone, {{consisted}} {{as usual}} of an endless string of questions, and was devoted {{entirely to the}} subject of himself and his future prospects. Where would Lecount take him to when they went away the next morning? Why to London? Why should he be left in London, while Lecount went on to St. Crux to give the admiral the Letter and the Will? Because his wife might follow him, if he went to the admiral's? Well, there was something in that. And because he ought to be safely concealed from her, in some comfortable lodging, near Mr. Loscombe? Why near Mr. Loscombe? Ah, yes, to be sure--to know what the law would do to help him. Would the law set him free from the Wretch who had deceived him? How tiresome of Lecount not to know! Would the law say he had gone and married himself a second time, because he had been living with the Wretch, like husband and wife, in Scotland? Anything that publicly assumed to be a marriage was a marriage (he had heard) in Scotland. How excessively tiresome of Lecount to <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> she knew nothing about it! Was he to stay long in London by himself, with nobody but Mr. Loscombe to speak to? Would Lecount come back to him as soon as she had put those important papers in the admiral's own hands? Would Lecount consider herself still in his service? The good Lecount! the excellent Lecount! And after all the law-business was over--what then? Why not leave this horrid England and go abroad again? Why not go to France, to some cheap place near Paris? Say Versailles? say St. Germain? In a nice little French house--cheap? With a nice French bonne to cook--who wouldn't waste his substance in the grease-pot? With a nice little garden--where he could work himself, and get health, and save the expense of keeping a gardener? It wasn't a bad idea. And it seemed to promise well for the future--didn't it, Lecount? ...|$|E

5000|$|After {{seven years}} with the show, Richter {{departed}} from Late Night after the May 26, 2000 show.

If there was no-one around I'd <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> wait. If anyone asked I'd say I was waiting for X, you know.

40|$|We {{report on}} the conduct of a two-year study of how a model of {{professional}} development (PD) supported two, year 3 teachers while implementing new content incorporated within the new mathematics syllabus. We explore what supported a professional learning community to {{develop a sense of}} agency and leadership for learning and how this was sustained two years on. The aim {{of the study was to}} develop teacher content and pedagogical content knowledge to enhance their agency when implementing the syllabus. The data sources included researcher field notes and interviews with the teachers. The teachers talked about the importance of the collaborative PD and the provision of appropriate literature, websites and suitable materials, and the ongoing access to the researcher as a way to support their growth in content and pedagogy knowledge. They talked about their sense of ownership of the lessons they developed. They also identified preparation of lesson plans as supporting their construction of knowledge. When probed about the reflective discussion at the end of each lesson, the teachers were in agreement that this period of reflection supported their ongoing development. For the two years following the project one teacher had continued to teach Year 3. When asked to reflect on the PD and how it was structured she commented, Pam:	It really changed my way of thinking [...] . We worked together collaboratively. That made our lessons more successful and we were very honest with each other [...] . Even when [researcher] wasn’t there we would actually just <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> what does this actually mean? [...] . All the talking helped us to get the language of mental computation to teach it [...] . The readings and websites were good too but I tell you what was great. The concept maps! There was evidence that the teachers began to lead their own learning. The teachers collaborated, supporting each other's growth in content and pedagogical content knowledge as well as agency. This leading of learning by the teachers themselves is a powerful opportunity to bringing about educational change that has not been realised traditionally (Frost, 2006). It is argued that, for teachers to develop a sense of agency, shared leadership must be possible and this is best reflected within a professional learning community where teachers have the capacity to influence outcomes.
