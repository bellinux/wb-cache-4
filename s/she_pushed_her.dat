25|$|Coup d'Etat was a {{breakthrough}} album {{that began to}} blend the punk and metal genres, something that would later be done {{time and time again}} by bands such as S.O.D., Anthrax, and the Cro-Mags {{by the end of the}} 1980s. Wendy also broke ground for her unique singing style. <b>She</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>her</b> vocals so hard she had to make trips into Cologne, Germany, where the album was being recorded, each day for treatments to avoid permanent damage to her vocal cords.|$|E
25|$|Another {{low point}} in Ribbentrop's {{relations}} with the SS occurred in February 1943, when the SD backed a Luther-led internal putsch to oust Ribbentrop as foreign minister. Luther had become estranged from Ribbentrop because Frau Ribbentrop treated Luther as a household servant. <b>She</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>her</b> husband into ordering an investigation into allegations of corruption on Luther's part. Luther's putsch failed largely because Himmler decided that a foreign ministry headed by Luther {{would be a more}} dangerous opponent than the Ribbentrop version. At the last minute, he withdrew his support from Luther. In the aftermath of the putsch, Luther was sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp.|$|E
500|$|In an interview, Lee told MTV News that <b>she</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>her</b> own limits, {{doing things}} she didn't {{have the courage}} to do in the making of Fallen. She told The Sun the main themes of The Open Door are freedom and her {{personal}} life. The lyrics delve on [...] "what was going on at the time" [...] in her life and about [...] "the experimenting and fun stuff" [...] the band tried on The Open Door. Lee described the songs on the album as [...] "very dark", and said they show how to pass the tough moments in life. When comparing the songs with the material from the group's previous album Fallen, she described them as [...] " [...] very different. The chords are still there but it's just a more mature version." [...] She also said her goal was to make a record that she loved even more than Fallen, rather than to copy the formula which made the previous record successful. Incorporating classical influences and several new elements in the music, [...] the sound of the record was inspired by the works of Portishead and Björk.|$|E
