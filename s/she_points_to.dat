She would assist with getting the family's meal of rice and beans ready, and then spend the morning at a table with a primer. As a little girl, she often pretended to be a teacher to her dolls and stuffed animals, using a small blackboard and desk. <b>She</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> this early play-time as the root of her desire to be an educator.|$|E
25|$|In May 2015, for {{the second}} year running, England’s Food Standards Agency devoted its annual Food Safety Week to – “The Chicken Challenge”. The focus was on the {{handling}} of raw chicken in the home and in catering facilities in a drive to reduce the worryingly high levels of food poisoning from the campylobacter bacterium. Anne Hardy argues that widespread public education of food hygiene can be useful, particularly through media (T.V cookery programmes) and advertisement. <b>She</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> the examples set by Scandinavian societies.|$|E

500|$|Feminist economists also examine early {{economic}} thinkers' interaction or lack {{of interaction}} with gender and women's issues, showing examples of women's historical engagement with economic thought. For example, Edith Kuiper discusses Adam Smith's engagement with feminist discourse {{on the role of}} women in the eighteenth century, France and England. She finds that through his writings, Smith typically supported the status quo on women's issues and [...] "lost sight of the division of labor in the family and the contribution of women's economic work." [...] In response, <b>she</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> Mary Collier's works such as The Woman's Labour (1739) to help understand Smith's contemporaneous experiences of women and fill in such gaps.|$|E
500|$|Ursula Franklin {{rejects the}} idea that {{powerful}} technologies automatically determine {{the ways in which}} people live and work. She maintains that the uses of technology are not preordained, but are the result of conscious choices. The dominant prescriptive technologies establish structures of power and control that follow what Franklin sees as male patterns of hierarchy, authoritarianism, competition and exclusion. Female workers are often victims of these patterns. Mechanical sewing machines were introduced in 1851 with the promise that they would liberate women from household drudgery. But when the machines ended up in factory sweatshops to produce cheap clothing, the new technology was used to exploit female workers. [...] "A strictly prescriptive technology with the classic division of labour arose from the introduction of new, supposedly liberating 'domestic' machines," [...] Franklin notes. [...] "In the subsequent evolution of the garment industry, much of the designing, cutting, and assembling began to be automated, often to the complete exclusion of workers." [...] <b>She</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> similar examples in other industries. Female operators helped introduce the telephone only to be replaced by automated switchboards after the technology had been successfully established while secretaries struggled to make the early mechanical typewriters function properly, but ended up performing fragmented and increasingly meaningless tasks.|$|E
500|$|Ruth K. MacDonald of New Mexico State University at {{the time}} of her Beatrix Potter (1986) argues that the theme of The Pie is the very proper social {{relations}} between neighbours in a small town. <b>She</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> the overly formal quality of the letters exchanged between the heroines as one example of the theme, and another, she indicates, is the manner in which the two pass each other on the street without a word to one another because [...] "they were going to have a party". Though Duchess probably does not speak to Ribby for fear of revealing her plan to switch the two pies, Ribby probably does not speak to Duchess out of an exaggerated sense of politeness or because she is rushed. [...] At the hour of the party, Duchess is anxious to arrive on time, yet not too early, and loiters outside Ribby's cottage before delivering her most [...] "genteel little tap-tappity" [...] and asking [...] "Is Mrs. Ribston at home?" [...] MacDonald notes that these instances not only underscore the elaborate codes of behaviour Potter's fictional animals observe but, by extension, the villagers of Sawrey. [...] For Potter, the result of such elaborate etiquette was nonsensical, distorted behaviour. Nevertheless, the cat and dog remain friends at the end of the story, and, in carefully avoiding any offence, their social pretenses and codes of etiquette are maintained.|$|E

2500|$|A {{critical}} part of Weiner's argument is {{that the ability to}} keep inalienable possessions outside of exchange is a source of difference, and hence brings high status. The development of Polynesian kingdoms is an example. <b>She</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> the inalienable possessions of the Australian aborigines, however, to demonstrate how the creation of hierarchy can be defeated. Australian inalienable possessions are given [...] cosmological authentication through their religious beliefs in the Dreaming.|$|E

2500|$|Dogs Today editor Beverley Cuddy, {{who said}} in the {{programme}} that [...] "dogs are falling apart" [...] and [...] "the number of genetic problems are increasing at a frightening pace" [...] disputes the Kennel Club's 90% figure. <b>She</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> a Kennel Club/British Small Animal Veterinary Association health survey, which shows that 37.4% of dogs {{had at least one}} serious health issue by age 5, and adds that the Kennel Club had to discount conditions such as hip dysplasia, slipping patellas and hereditary cataracts to get their 90% figure.|$|E

2500|$|Practices of BDSM survive {{from some}} of the oldest textual records in the world, {{associated}} with rituals to the Goddess Inanna (Ishtar in Akkadian). Cuneiform texts dedicated to Inanna which incorporate domination rituals. In particular <b>she</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> ancient writings such as Inanna and Ebih (in which the Goddess dominates Ebih), and Hymn to Inanna describing cross-dressing transformations and rituals [...] "imbued with pain and ecstasy, bringing about initation and journeys of altered states of consciousness; punishment, moaning, ecstasy, lament and song, participants exhausting themselves in weeping and grief." ...|$|E
2500|$|The classicist Lily Ross Taylor {{addresses}} this issue, as follows. Cicero, {{to refer}} to these two rival political groups, continually used the Latin word partes [...] Cicero (106–43) was {{a key figure in}} Roman politics who wrote volumes about it. In distinguishing the two groups, he employed the Latin terms optimates for proponents of the Senate nobility and populares for elite proponents of the popular demos or commoners. <b>She</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> the Roman historians Sallust (86–34) and Livy (59 BC-AD 17) for partial confirmation, as well as to later writers Plutarch (c.46–120), Appian (c.95-c.165), and Dio (c.155-c.235), and later still Machiavelli (1469–1527).|$|E
2500|$|Historian Judy Campbell {{argues that}} it is highly {{improbable}} that the First Fleet {{was the source of}} the epidemic as [...] "smallpox had not occurred in any members of the First Fleet"; the only possible source of infection from the Fleet being Tench’s “bottles”. <b>She</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> regular contact between fishing fleets from the Indonesia archipelago, where smallpox was endemic, and Aboriginal people in Australia's North as a far more likely source for the introduction of smallpox. Other historians have argued that {{it is likely that the}} outbreak came from First Fleet sources. [...] This area has been highly contentious, but in the 2014 review by Christopher Warren, in Journal of Australian Studies it was argued that British marines were most likely to have spread smallpox without the knowledge of Governor Phillip.|$|E

2500|$|Since its release, {{some critics}} and film historians have {{interpreted}} Night of the Living Dead as a subversive film that critiques 1960s American society, international Cold War politics and domestic racism. Elliot Stein of The Village Voice saw {{the film as}} an ardent critique of American involvement in the Vietnam War, arguing that it [...] "was not set in Transylvania, but Pennsylvania – this was Middle America at war, and the zombie carnage seemed a grotesque echo of the conflict then raging in Vietnam." [...] Film historian Sumiko Higashi concurs, arguing that Night of the Living Dead was a film about {{the horrors of the}} Vietnam era. While she admits that [...] "there are no Vietnamese in Night of the Living Dead, [...] they constitute an absent presence whose significance can be understood if narrative is construed". <b>She</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> aspects of the Vietnam War paralleled in the film: grainy black-and-white newsreels, search and destroy operations, helicopters, and graphic carnage. In the 2009 documentary film Nightmares in Red, White and Blue, the zombies in the film are compared to the [...] "silent majority" [...] of the U.S. in the late 1960s.|$|E
2500|$|Heather Ousby {{points out}} that the {{identity}} of the [...] "subbornd Informer" [...] has proved especially contentious for critics. <b>She</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> several interpretations of the informer which include the Friend, some sort of spy, and [...] "an abstract force such as jealousy". In her interpretation of the Sonnet, Ousby settles on the idea that the informer represents the Friend. She bases this thought on the various meanings of the word [...] "suborn" [...] during this time period. Rather than spying, informing could also be seen as inspiring and thus it would refer to the inspiration for the sonnet. Likewise, the term suborn meant corruption in loyalty which the Speaker accuses the Friend of in other sonnets. Ousby is making a case for eliminating the informer as some third party, much like Greene. The difference is that Ousby uses the subtraction of this would-be character to shift the tone of the sonnet. She agrees that the first two quatrains concern how the [...] "dwellers on form and favor are destroyed by that humiliating process" [...] of giving unreciprocated affection. She sees the third quatrain as a plea to the Friend or as a directive to both of them. The couplet, however, becomes a means of stating the Speaker's independence from the Friend due to his [...] "poor but free" [...] oblations which mean a lot but cost so little. For Ousby, the Speaker seems to be separating himself from a disloyal patron who demeans his work.|$|E
