50|$|The plaque is 49 in tall, 31+1/8 in wide, and {{approximately}} 3/4 in deep. The {{ground of the}} relief is dull and has a pebbled surface. The face and letter fronts have a polished, shiny patina. The relief is mounted to the wall with four <b>socket</b> <b>cap</b> screws, one in each upper corner and {{one on each side}} approximately six inches from the bottom. The right side screw is missing. The Indiana State Museum reported on 15 May 2006 that the sculpture's condition was excellent.|$|E
5000|$|Soon after SPS {{had begun}} {{producing}} the {{hex socket head}} set screw, Hallowell had the idea to make a hex <b>socket</b> head <b>cap</b> screw (SHCS). Hallowell said, [...] "Up to this moment {{none of us had}} ever seen a <b>socket</b> head <b>cap</b> screw, and what I am about to relate concerns what I believe was the first <b>socket</b> head <b>cap</b> screw ever made in this country U.S.." [...] SPS gave their line of screws the Unbrako brand name, chosen for its echoing of the word [...]|$|R
5000|$|A spider is a simple, {{relatively}} inexpensive, limited-capability {{version of}} an independent-jaw chuck. It typically consists of a ring of metal with screw threads tapped radially into it, in which screws (hex <b>cap,</b> <b>socket</b> hex <b>cap,</b> or set screws) serve as independent jaws. Spiders can serve various purposes: ...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>socket</b> head <b>cap</b> screws {{connecting}} the shell {{to the mother}} board were replaced with button head cap screws.|$|R

5000|$|A {{counterbore}} (symbol: ‚å¥) is a cylindrical flat-bottomed {{hole that}} enlarges another coaxial hole, or the tool {{used to create}} that feature. A counterbore hole is typically used when a fastener, such as a <b>socket</b> head <b>cap</b> screw, is required to sit flush with or {{below the level of}} a workpiece's surface.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} type of joint between shell and arbor {{involves}} a fairly large cylindrical feature at center (to locate the shell concentric to the arbor) and two driving lugs or tangs that drive the shell with a positive engagement (like a dog clutch). Within the central cylindrical area, one or several <b>socket</b> head <b>cap</b> screws fasten the shell to the arbor.|$|R
50|$|In some jurisdictions, {{replacement}} of the fuse cartridge by unskilled personnel is allowed only for fuses {{up to a certain}} maximum rating. If the fuse cartridge is inserted into the <b>socket</b> without the <b>cap,</b> a shock hazard exists.|$|R
5000|$|A socket is {{typically}} a cylinder {{which has a}} female six- or twelve-point recessed opening sized to fit over the common male hexagonal head of a bolt or nut fastener. The {{opposite end of the}} socket wrench has a standardized (ANSI B107, ISO, or other consensus standard) square recess to accept the socket wrench's drive size. Male drivers are also produced for use with <b>socket</b> head <b>cap</b> screws, and are often called Allen drivers (trademark) or the generic term male bit drivers ...|$|R
50|$|During the war, in {{addition}} to the engines for Dennis Brothers and Hallford, {{by the end of the}} war some 4,000 of them, White and Poppe also made fuses. More specifically Fuse 80 bodies and 18pdr shell <b>sockets,</b> rings, <b>caps</b> and base plugs. White and Poppe also managed the Ministry of Munitions No.10 (later 21) National Shell Filling & Fuse factory, part of which was switched at the end of 1916 from fuses to making aeroplane wings. By November 1918 they employed 13,500 people.|$|R
5000|$|Oracle Database 12c Standard Edition 2 (SE2): {{intended}} for small- to medium-sized implementations, this edition comes with Real Application Clusters option included, a reduced set of database features, and the licensing restriction {{to run on}} servers or clusters with a maximum of 2 <b>sockets</b> total and <b>capped</b> to use a maximum of 16 concurrent user threads. Oracle positions SE2 as a starter edition, stressing complete upward compatibility and ease of upgrade to the more costly Enterprise Edition.|$|R
40|$|Torque tension {{testing of}} a newly {{designed}} Reusable Solid Rocket Motor nozzle bolted assembly was successfully completed. Test {{results showed that the}} 3 -sigma preload variation was as expected at the required input torque level and the preload relaxation were within the engineering limits. A shim installation technique was demonstrated as a simple process to fill a shear lip gap between nozzle housings in the joint region. A new automated torque system was successfully demonstrated in this test. This torque control tool was found to be very precise and accurate. The bolted assembly performance was further evaluated using the Nozzle Structural Test Bed. Both current <b>socket</b> head <b>cap</b> screw and proposed multiphase alloy bolt configurations were tested. Results indicated that joint skip and bolt bending were significantly reduced with the new multiphase alloy bolt design. This paper summarizes all the test results completed to date...|$|R
5000|$|The engine {{features}} four inline cylinders inclined {{at an angle}} of approximately 45 degrees (hence the name), and this is because Vauxhall had originally planned to develop a whole family of engines all built on the same production line. There was to be slant four and V8 versions in both petrol and diesel versions, designed {{under the guidance of}} Vauxhall's then chief engineer, John Alden. Although several diesel 4-cylinder and a V8 petrol engine prototypes were built only the 4-cylinder petrol made it to series production. There is a single overhead camshaft operating two valves per cylinder. An ingenious valve train design incorporating an inclined <b>socket</b> head <b>cap</b> screw, allowed valve clearances to be adjusted with a feeler gauge and an Allen key. The block and crossflow head are both of cast iron. The layout makes good use of the cylinder inclination to lower the overall height of the engine, which allowed for more aerodynamic designs of cars to be achieved by lowering the bonnet line. It also means most of the engine is very easy to access for maintenance, {{with the exception of the}} exhaust manifold and spark plugs, which are [...] "underneath" [...] the slanted cylinders.|$|R
5000|$|Male bit {{drivers are}} {{sometimes}} incorrectly {{referred to as}} [...] "sockets", but are in fact the opposite of a socket, in that bit drivers fit into a <b>socket</b> head <b>cap</b> screw or pipe plug, rather than fit over a male drive head on a nut or bolt as a socket does. A socket is a [...] "female" [...] recess or opening which receives another object, together as a fitting connection. A socket is not a protruding [...] "male" [...] connection. Common male bit drivers of this type include Allen hex wrenches (in both metric and fractional inch sizes), Torx (T-3 thru T-50) spline wrenches, 4-point (square), and 12-point (triple square) male bit drivers. Other specialized screw heads that are often installed or removed with screwdriver type handles and appropriate type tip have socket varieties that fit the various screw head types and a can be attached to a socket wrench. Conversely, for low torque situations, a [...] "socket spinner" [...] screwdriver handle with a socket wrench type fitting on one end can be attached to {{many different types of}} sockets, bit drivers and extensions.|$|R
40|$|The {{traditional}} shoulder <b>socket</b> is a <b>cap</b> {{over the}} shoulder which leads to gapping of the myoelectric contacts. An improved socket design leaves the upper aspect of the socket open and achieves suspension on a wedge formed by the upper back and upper chest The wedge guarantees excellent myoelectric contact at all times. The socket is finther stabilized by a lateral strut and a T-section that surrounds the cage lower rib. All other areas are left open. When combined with a new X-shaped Neoprene suspension, this socket permits the free motion of the acromion {{to be used for}} adjusting the terminal device in space and for activating secondary devices such as mode selection switches or separate controls for wrist motion. This socket design has been tried on both a bilateral shoulder patient and a transradial/shoulder amputee. FINAL PAPER NOT RECEIVED AT PRESS TIM...|$|R
