40|$|The {{prediction}} {{and analysis}} {{of changes in the}} numbers of biological populations rest on mathematical formulations of demographic events (births and deaths) classified by the age of individuals. The development of demographic theory when birth and death rates vary statistically over time is the central theme of this work. A study of the standard Leslie model for the demographic dynamics of populations in variable environments is made. At each time interval a Leslie matrix of survival rates and fertilities of a population is chosen according to a Markov process and the population numbers in different age classes are computed. Analytical bounds are developed for the logarithmic growth rate and the age-structure of a population after long times. For a two dimensional case, it is shown analytically that a uniform distribution results for the age-structure if the survival rate from the first to the second age-class is a uniformly distributed random quantity with no serial auto correlation. Numerical studies are made which lead to similar conclusions when the survival rate obeys other distributions. It is found that the variance in the survival parameter is linearly related to the variance in the age structure. An efficient algorithm is developed for numerical simulations on a computer by considering a time <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>births</b> rather than whole populations. The algorithm is then applied to an example in three dimensions to calculate a <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>births</b> when the survival rate from the first to the second age-class is a random parameter. Numerical values for the logarithmic growth rate and the logarithmic variance for a population and the probability of extinction are obtained and then compared to the analytical results reported here and elsewhere...|$|E

Previously, the random-effect parameter in the random model has been interpreted in terms of unmeasured and unmeasurable factors, suggesting the presence of death clustering. This interpretation is problematic because the concept of unobserved heterogeneity {{is not the same}} as death clustering. This paper attempts to clarify the concept of death clustering and demonstrates that the concept needs to be closely associated, and therefore examined, with the <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>births</b> and deaths in a family. Earlier approaches have been insensitive to sequencing both in the clarification of the concept and in the analytical methods used to examine the presence and extent of death clustering.

Isolated fish from 2 susceptible Norwegian stocks (Rivers Lier and Alta) and 1 resistant Baltic stock of salmon (River Neva) were infected {{with a single}} gravid worm in order to record the temporal <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>births</b> and age at death of individual parasites. Establishment success (proportion of worms surviving to give birth) was generally low and mortality high, but significantly fewer worms survived on Neva (45 % with mean survival of 3 · 5 days) compared to Alta and Lier fish (60 %, mean survival 7 · 9 and 5 · 2 days, respectively). There was a dramatic difference in parasite fecundity between the host stocks: only 2 births occurred on Neva fish compared to third and fourth births on both Alta and Lier hosts. The timing of the first birth was more variable on Neva hosts and was significantly extended (mean 2 · 3 days) relative to that on Alta and Neva fish (1 · 8 days). However, timing of the second birth did not vary {{on any of the}} 3 salmon stocks. Age-specific mortality and fecundity data are consistent with exponential population growth of G. salaris on Alta and Lier fish but eventual extinction on Neva hosts. This is the first demonstration that gyrodactylids maintained on different host stocks exhibit variations in fecundity, development and mortality, which may in turn account for the variable virulence noted when G. salaris infects different salmonid hosts...|$|E

Three well developed attractors in the frequency locking, quasi-periodic and chaotic regions are subjected to membrane excitations.

It is interesting that all membrane configurations exhibit wealthy regions of complex dynamics and very beneficial to the fermentor performance. The simulated results reveal various fascinating phenomena such as hyperchaos, chaos and large bubble windows. It was shown that the chaotic regions are the attractive and best potential regions {{for the implementation of}} the membrane excitations. It {{is interesting to note that}} when the shock type and linear membranes are imposed on chaotic regions, the hyperchaotic attractors arise and have substantial impact in increasing the average ethanol yield to 18. 98 % and 19. 29 %, respectively.

The inclusion of Iscah must have had some significance that either J or his source chose not to elucidate. Nevertheless a strong tradition must have barred the redactors from omitting Iscah's name, a tradition, presumably, in which a sister had an important function; this tradition is apparent also in Genesis 4:22, in which Naamah, 64 sister of Tubal-Cain, is mentioned only by name. It can be surmised that Naamah and Iscah were originally recorded to categorize the descent group (or other characteristic) of their siblings Tubal-Cain and Milcah.

40|$|In {{this article}} we argue that social and {{economic}} changes in {{the past fifteen years}} have influenced distinct socio-economic categories of women differently. We show that the transition of family formation behaviours was not uniform but rather dependent on the educational level of women. We found wide differences between educational categories in terms of the changes in level, timing and <b>sequencing</b> <b>of</b> first <b>birth</b> and first marriage, using the techniques of nuptiality and fertility life tables and the hazard modelling of first marriage and first conception. Two different types of “trendsetters” were identified in Czech society. The trendsetters of non-marital fertility are women with primary education, who tend to be lone mothers or to cohabit even after childbirth. The second group of trendsetters are more highly educated women, who postpone their fertility onset until their 30 s, but who still place their first childbirth traditionally inside marriage. The number of possible reasons for the family formation transition is manifold, ranging from the changing economic roles of women through actual setting of family policy to the post-modern value change, all further reinforced by educational expansion since the 1990 s. There is no general explanation of the transitional behaviour, as women of different education levels are reacting differently to the social and economic changes. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. The ergodic theorems of {{demography}} {{describe the}} properties of a product of certain nonnegative matrices, in the limit {{as the number of}} matrix factors in the product becomes large. This paper reviews these theorems and, where possible, their empirical usefulness. The strong ergodic theorem of demography assumes fixed age-specific birth and death rates. An approach to a stable age structure and to an exponentially changing total population size, predicted by the Perron-Frobenius theorem, is observed in at least some human populations. The weak ergodic theorem of demography assumes a deterministic <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> changing <b>birth</b> and death rates, and predicts that two populations with initially different age structures will have age structures which differ by less and less. Strong and weak stochastic ergodic theorems assume that the birth and death rates are chosen by time-homogeneous or time-inhomogeneous Markov chains and describe the probability distribution of age structure and measures of the growth of total population size. These stochastic models and theorems suggest a scheme for incorporating historical human data into a new method of population projection. The empirical merit of this scheme in competition with existing methods of projection remains to be determined. Most analytical results developed for products of random matrices in demography apply to a variety of other fields where products of random matrices are a useful model. 1. Introduction.
