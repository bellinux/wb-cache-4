[...] "Batalus" [...] or [...] "Batalos" [...] meant [...] "stammerer" [...] {{in ancient}} Greek, {{but it was}} also the name of a flute-player (in ridicule of whom Antiphanes wrote a play) and of a songwriter.* D. Hawhee, Bodily Arts, 156. The word [...] "batalus" [...] was also used by the Athenians to {{describe}} the anus.* M. L. Rose, The Staff of Oedipus, 57. In fact the word actually defining his <b>speech</b> <b>defect</b> was [...] "Battalos", signifying someone with rhotacism, but it was crudely misrepresented as [...] "Batalos" [...] by the enemies of Demosthenes and by Plutarch's time the original word had already lost currency. Another nickname of Demosthenes was [...] "Argas." [...] According to Plutarch, this name was given him either for his savage and spiteful behaviour or for his disagreeable way of speaking. [...] "Argas" [...] was a poetical word for a snake, but also the name of a poet.|$|E
500|$|In the 1980 Senate {{election}} in South Dakota, McGovern {{was one of}} several liberal Democratic senators targeted for defeat by the National Conservative Political Action Committee (NCPAC), which put out a year's worth of negative portrayals of McGovern. It and other pro-life groups especially focused on McGovern's support for pro-choice abortion laws. McGovern faced a Democratic primary challenge for the first time, from a pro-life candidate. McGovern's Republican opponent was James Abdnor, a four-term incumbent congressman who held identical positions to McGovern's on farm issues, was solidly conservative on national issues, and was well liked within the state. Abdnor's campaign focused on both McGovern's liberal voting record and what it said was McGovern's lack of involvement in South Dakota affairs. McGovern made an issue of NCPAC's outside involvement, and that group eventually withdrew from the campaign after Abdnor denounced a letter it had sent out. Far behind in the polls earlier, McGovern outspent Abdnor two-to-one and repeatedly criticized Abdnor's refusal to debate him, thereby drawing attention to a slight <b>speech</b> <b>defect</b> Abdnor had. Showing the comeback pattern of some of his past races in the state, McGovern closed the gap for a while. However, in November 1980 McGovern was solidly defeated for re-election, getting only 39 percent of the vote to Abdnor's 58 percent. McGovern became one of many Democratic casualties of that year's Republican sweep, which became known as the [...] "Reagan Revolution".|$|E

The theoretical part of the thesis presents the connection between thinking and speaking. It particularly presents the child’s speech development and necessary conditions for speech development. Described are factors, which impact the development of speech, and phases of speech development and problems, appearing in the speech and linguistic development. The most important chapter of the thesis presents the description of <b>speech</b> <b>defects,</b> which can appear in the preschool child. In the empirical part I used a questionnaire to gain answers of teachers to the questions on <b>speech</b> <b>defects</b> in preschool children in order to acknowledge the actual state of <b>speech</b> <b>defects</b> in children and their familiarity with different disorders. I found out that the majority of teachers is familiar with <b>speech</b> <b>defects,</b> appearing in preschool children. The majority of teachers already had in their group a child with <b>speech</b> <b>defects.</b> I found out that a very large percentage of teachers in kindergarten is trying to fix the <b>speech</b> <b>defects</b> with various <b>speech</b> games, which the teachers find on their own, or with exercises, prescriber by a specialist.

[...] Unlike other Hindi films, in which the female lead is Sita, the protagonist is Rama and the {{antagonist}} is Ravana, the characters in Kaminey are nuanced humans in [...] "layered and complex" [...] situations. Namrata Joshi from Outlook wrote that Kaminey reflects Bhardwaj's [...] "enduring fascination for underdogs, characters {{on the margins of}} society and the morally compromised". Bhardwaj told Rediff.com that the film deals with [...] "themes that affect our lives directly", and [...] "is a reminder that we all have a dark side, and often we are not fully aware of that side". Rakesh Bedi from The Economic Times wrote, [...] "Bhardwaj presents the two warring brothers with speech defects. In today's world of logorrhea, communication is fraught with many dangers: misunderstandings, paranoias, recriminations, conflicts. Everyone speaks but no one understands. Bhardwaj gave the twins verbal impediments to show that the world has now been so hardwired to convoluted and calamitous communication that it needs silence or a <b>speech</b> <b>defect</b> to hash things out." [...] He continued, [...] "ith some glitches, Bhardwaj has almost re-birthed the Hindi film". The film also explores sex and sexuality, which according to Bedi were explored in a [...] "radically different and refreshing" [...] way, and the director [...] "daringly takes it a step further". When Sweety becomes pregnant, the couple [...] "decide to carry the pregnancy to term after a bit of hesitation. So she literally pushes her man into marriage. (Had Bhardwaj abjured marriage, {{it would have been a}} complete break but the nuptials were essential to the drama of the film.)" [...] The Daily Beast said that [...] "for aficionados of the Hindi-language genre, Kaminey is a revolutionary manifesto. It takes classic Bollywood tropes—estranged brothers, a case of mistaken identity, high drama approaching slapstick comedy—and presents them with Hollywood-style realism instead of Bollywood's wink-nudge mix of melodrama and posturing.|$|E
