5|$|As the Griffin family {{prepare to}} <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>for</b> their dinner, baby Stewie is shown {{watching}} television, with the annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade {{taking place on}} the screen. Stewie notices a hot air balloon in the parade resembling himself. After the family decides {{to go to the}} Griffin family's backyard to play football, Joe approaches his son to encourage him to beat the other team. Joe then references the 2009 war film The Hurt Locker, with Kevin responding with disdain for the film, despite supposedly being in a coma during its release. Joe also goes on to point out that Kevin is wearing an Ed Hardy t-shirt, which also became popularized during his supposed coma, and despite Kevin telling his father that he flew straight home after he awoke. Later during dinner, when Kevin reveals that he went A.W.O.L., Peter makes an off the wall reference, causing the episode to cut to a room showing several of the show's editors, who become confused about what cutaway to play on the screen. They then decide to play a clip involving several characters from The Wizard of Oz, including the Cowardly Lion, who is shown to be actress Lindsay Lohan's gynecologist.|$|E

25|$|During the Civil War II storyline, {{the vision}} of the Inhuman Ulysses showed a rampaging Hulk {{standing}} over the corpses of the superheroes. Meanwhile, Bruce Banner is shown to have set up a laboratory in Alpine, Utah, where he is approached by Captain Marvel, followed by Tony Stark, the rest of the Avengers, the X-Men, and the Inhumans. The confrontation leads to the Beast hacking into Banner's work servers and the revelation that he had been injecting himself with dead gamma-irradiated cells. S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Maria Hill places him under arrest. Banner gets infuriated at all these events, when suddenly, Hawkeye shoots Banner with an arrow to the head and then to the heart, killing him, much to the dismay and horror of the superheroes, especially Tony Stark. At an Avengers-presided tribunal, Hawkeye states that Bruce Banner had approached him and ordered him to kill him if he ever showed signs of turning into the Hulk again. At the funeral, Korg of the Warbound stated how Hulk wanted to be left alone and how his allies that he made along the way have become his family. In his video will, Bruce leaves various items to other heroes and his allies including leaving Doctor Strange his notes on the Hulk's ability to perceive ghosts and an egg-timer for the various former/current other Hulks (based on one of Bruce's more successful attempts to control himself as he would <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>for</b> three minutes doing nothing before making a particularly big decision and then decide if he still wanted to do it).|$|E

500|$|Writer Michael Michaelian {{originally}} {{pitched a}} story idea based on andropause, {{sometimes referred to}} as [...] "male menopause".

Fontana was brought in to overhaul the ending, and explained that a [...] "lot of what I put in at the end was also in Michael's story and drafts, but approached with a different emphasis". One significant alteration she made was to change the plot from involving actual terrorists to a trap that the crew must defuse. The original ending also had the two opposing parties on the planet <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>for</b> peace talks with Jameson surviving the effects of the de-aging drugs.

Liz convinces Toofer to work with Tracy. As they work together, Tracy gets upset with Toofer's supposed lack of blackness, and endearingly calls Toofer a racial slur. The next morning, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin), Liz, Toofer, and Tracy <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>for</b> a meeting about Tracy's vocabulary from the previous night. Tracy and Jack {{point out that the}} African-American community has adopted the word to deprive it of its meaning. In trying to reach out to Tracy, Toofer says the word again but because of his perceived cultural whiteness, everyone, including Tracy, is offended in a way they weren't when Tracy used the term. Tracy and Toofer attend sensitivity training, start arguing, and in the process develop a new sketch for TGS. When show starts running short on time, Liz offers Tracy the option to either air the sketch or one from the Star Jones cooking show, Tracy chooses the latter. Toofer is initially upset, but agrees with Tracy's decision when he finds the sketch funny.|$|E

2500|$|Care for the gods, {{the very}} meaning of religio, had {{therefore}} {{to go through}} life, and one might thus understand why Cicero wrote that religion was [...] "necessary". Religious behavior – pietas in Latin, eusebeia in Greek – belonged to action and not to contemplation. Consequently religious acts took place wherever the faithful were: in houses, boroughs, associations, cities, military camps, cemeteries, in the country, on boats. 'When pious travelers happen to pass by a sacred grove or a cult place on their way, {{they are used to}} make a vow, or a fruit offering, or to <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>for</b> a while' (Apuleius, Florides 1.1).|$|E
