40|$|Progress in {{predictive}} design capabilities {{for external}} heat transfer to turbine vanes was summarized. A two dimensional linear cascade (previously {{used to obtain}} vane surface heat transfer distributions on nonfilm cooled airfoils) {{was used to examine}} the effect of leading edge <b>shower</b> <b>head</b> film <b>cooling</b> on downstream heat transfer. The data were used to develop and evaluate analytical models. Modifications to the two dimensional boundary layer model are described. The results were used to formulate and test an effective viscosity model capable of predicting heat transfer phenomena downstream of the leading edge film cooling array on both the suction and pressure surfaces, with and without mass injection...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the fabrication and manufacturing process of a simulated leading edge {{portion of a}} turbine blade with a porous superalloy structure constructed using Laser Additive Manufacturing (LAM) techniques. The LAM method was assessed based {{on its ability to}} successfully fabricate complex, porous structures within traditional turbine components. To simulate the manufacturing process, the leading edge was designed, fabricated, heat-treated and closely examined for manufacturing accuracy. Manufactured out of Inconel, the leading edge is a single piece which is capable of both internal and external cooling through the use of <b>shower</b> <b>head</b> <b>cooling</b> as well as with an internal cavity undergoing jet impingement cooling. The internal structure was designed as a lattice of intersecting holes in order to mimic that of a porous material. External hole geometry was measured to determine the accuracy and tolerances of the manufacturing process in order to analyze the hole uniformity over the leading edge portion of the blade. Flow testing was performed in order to characterize the effective flow area and uniformity at the exit of porous structures at multiple pressure ratios. The velocity field at the exit was measured and compared with the physical geometry in order to pinpoint manufacturing defects. The analysis outline yields quantitative data on the LAM process, providing insight {{as to whether or not}} it is a viable option for current turbine blade production...|$|R
40|$|Impingement cooling {{has been}} widely {{employed}} to cool gas turbine hot components such as combustor liners, combustor transition pieces, turbine vanes, and blades. A promising technology is proposed to enhance impingement cooling with water droplets injection. However, previous studies were conducted on blade <b>shower</b> <b>head</b> film <b>cooling,</b> and less attention {{was given to the}} transition piece cooling. As a continuous effort to develop a realistic mist impingement cooling scheme, this paper focuses on simulating mist impingement cooling under typical gas turbine operating conditions of high temperature and pressure in a double chamber model. Furthermore, the paper presents the effect of cooling effectiveness by changing the mass and size of the droplets. Based on the heat-mass transfer analogy, the results of these experiments prove that the mass of 3 E – 3 kg/s droplets with diameters of 5 – 35 μm could enhance 90 % cooling effectiveness and reduce 122 K of wall temperature. The results of this paper can provide guidance for corresponding experiments and serve as the qualification reference for future more complicated studies with convex surface cooling...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study has been}} conducted to study the heat transfer characteristics within corrugation film <b>cooling</b> <b>holes</b> of different cross section area square, rectangular and circular. The experiments investigation for this paper have been performed using a thermal IR camera, and the flow field has been analyzed by numerical calculation using a commercial code (FLUENT) was utilized and the SST k- ω turbulence model. The effect of blowing ratio (0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5 and 2. 0) and twisted film <b>cooling</b> <b>holes</b> angles (90 °, 180 °, 270 ° and 360 °) were also considered. A duct flow enters into a twisted film <b>cooling</b> <b>hole</b> in a cross direction.

40|$|The {{development}} of a high pressure turbine requires the accurate prediction of flow within and around film <b>cooling</b> <b>holes.</b> However the length scales inherent to film cooling flows produce a large disparity against those of themainstreamflow, hence {{they can not be}} resolved by a mesh generated for an aerodynamics analysis. Furthermore, the process of meshing <b>cooling</b> <b>holes</b> is not only time consuming but cumbersome; thus making the parametric study of film cooling effectiveness for a given blade geometry, using hole geometry and distribution very difficult in a design environment. In this paper an immersed mesh block (IMB) approach is proposedwhich allows the refinedmesh of a <b>cooling</b> <b>hole</b> to be immersed into the coarser mesh of an NGV and solved simultaneously whilst maintaining mass conservation. By employing two-way coupling, the flow physics in and around <b>cooling</b> <b>holes</b> is able to interact with the mainstream, hence the length scales of both types of flow are appropriately resolved. A generic <b>cooling</b> <b>hole</b> design can then be mapped to a given aerofoil geometry multiple times to achieve an appropriate distribution of <b>cooling</b> <b>holes.</b> The results show that for a realistic transonic blade, a configuration consisting of up to 200 <b>cooling</b> <b>holes</b> can be efficiently and accurately calculated - whilst retaining the original aerodynamic mesh but with a much enhanced resolution for the film cooling.

40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} Navier-Stokes code {{has been}} used to compute the heat transfer coefficient on two film-cooled turbine blades, namely, the VKI rotor with six rows of <b>cooling</b> <b>holes,</b> including three rows on the <b>shower</b> <b>head</b> and the C 3 X vane with nine rows of holes, including five rows on the <b>shower</b> <b>head.</b> Predictions of heat transfer coefficient at the blade surface using three two-equation turbulence model specifically, Coakley's q-omega model, Chien's k-epsilon model and Wilcox's k-omega model with Menter's modifications, have been compared with the experimental data of Camci and Arts for the VKI rotor, and of Hylton et al. for the C 3 X vane along with predictions using the Baldwin-Lomar (B-L) model taken from Garg and Gaugler. It is found that for the cases considered here the two equation models predict the blade heat transfer somewhat better than the B-L model except immediately downstream of the film-cooled holes on the suction surface of the VKI rotor, and over most of the suction surface of the C 3 X vane. However, all two-equation models require 40 % more computer core than the B-L model for solution, and while the q-omega and k-epsilon models need 40 % more computer time than the B-L model the k-omega model requires at least 65 % more time because of the slower rate of convergence. It is found that the heat transfer coefficient exhibit a strong spanwise as well as streamwise variation for both blades and all turbulence models...|$|R

40|$|Advanced {{combustion}} {{techniques in}} aero engines require highly effective cooling schemes of combustor liners. One Parameter affecting the cooling performance is {{the geometry of}} the <b>cooling</b> <b>holes</b> themselves. So far, the freedom {{in the design of}} <b>cooling</b> <b>holes</b> was limited due to the manufacturing techniques. With emerging additive manufacturing methods, e. g. Direct Metal Laser Sintering, however, the geometry of the <b>cooling</b> <b>holes</b> is virtually unlimited. Especially the entrance and the curvature of the <b>cooling</b> <b>holes</b> determines the through-flow of the hole and consequently the cooling performance of the ejected cooling film. In this study a set of combustor liner tiles with two innovative and four traditional <b>cooling</b> <b>hole</b> geometries will be analyzed and compared to each other in terms of cooling performance. The innovative geometries have bent <b>cooling</b> <b>holes</b> with a nearly horizontal outlet. All specimens have the same <b>cooling</b> <b>hole</b> pattern. The <b>cooling</b> performance is determined by comparing the total cooling effectiveness for a given pressure difference across the combustor liner tiles. The coolant mass flow rate is gained from experimentally determined discharge coefficients for the respective pressure difference. The first set of measurements is conducted in an atmospheric open-loop test rig at reduced temperatures but realistic density ratios between hot gas and coolant. The specimen with the best cooling performance has been selected for an investigation in a high pressure test rig at realistic combustor conditions (pressure, temperature) including fluctuations of the cooling air to simulate combustion instabilities. The cooling performance again is determined by the total cooling effectiveness for a given pressure difference across the combustor liner tiles...|$|R

40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} Navier-Stokes analysis tool {{has been}} developed in order to study the effect of film cooling on the flow and heat transfer characteristics of actual turbine airfoils. An existing code (Arnone et al., 1991) has been modified for the purpose. The code is an explicit, multigrid, cell-centered, finite volume code with an algebraic turbulence model. Eigenvalue scaled artificial dissipation and variable-coefficient implicit residual smoothing are used with a full-multigrid technique. Moreover, Mayle's transition criterion (Mayle, 1991) is used. The effects of film cooling have been incorporated into the code {{in the form of}} appropriate boundary conditions at the hole locations on the airfoil surface. Each hole exit is represented by several control volumes, thus providing an ability to study the effect of hole shape on the film-cooling characteristics. Comparison is fair with near mid-span experimental data for four and nine rows of <b>cooling</b> <b>holes,</b> five on the <b>shower</b> <b>head,</b> and two rows each on the pressure and suction surfaces.

U. S. A. “AFRICA” Greetings to the Bryant Service Club: It {{was rather}} a {{pleasant}} surprize [sic] to receive your Memorial Day letter {{about two weeks}} ago. That {{is the way the}} mail goes with us; sometimes very slow service and at times it gets as low as ten day service which is considered very rapid delivery for us over here. I am now on my second year of foreign service having spent some time in England prior to our coming to Africa on the invasion last November. Since being in Africa I have visited such large cities as Oran. Constantine and Tunis and several smaller towns and points of interest too numerous to mention, I had the opportunity to visit the ruins of Carthage a short time ago. Of Course {{there are a lot more}} recent ruins now. During this time I have spent in Africa we have always lived and operated the hospital entirely in tents. The enlisted men have lived in their small pup tents. The boys have made many variations of homes by combining more tents and by building them up higher by use of sides of boards, tin or anything available. On the whole the boys have them fixed up quite cozy. Of course we have the old fashioned open type of plumbing, with a few modern variations. We wash up and shave in our helmets and even wash out a few clothes in them in a pinch, but most of the time for laundry purposes we can either get a pail or empty five gallon cans that previously had dehydrated potatoes in it. We have had showers varying from a steel drum up on a bank with a pipe and improvised <b>shower</b> <b>head</b> on it to the present outfit we have which is a GI portable shower unit which pumps the water from a tank into a overhead arrangement of four <b>shower</b> <b>heads.</b> In <b>cool</b> weather which is very rare now they can also heat the water with this outfit. Although it is very hot now with the temperature running up to 125 in some instances, last winter and spring ice on a helmet of water was a common sight, For a while we thought Hitler had ruined the heating plant here in Africa, but if he did it sure is working fine again this summer. With the first year of my foreign service there has been some very good news for the folks back there and I only hope that in my second year on this side of the pond we will be able to give the folks much better news.
