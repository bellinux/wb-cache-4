50|$|After the American Revolution, Passamaquoddy Bay was {{the scene}} of a {{thriving}} smuggling trade. Smuggling peaked in 1808 during Jefferson's Embargo, when smugglers illegally moved tens of thousands of barrels of American flour from American territory into New Brunswick. During the War of 1812, a thriving illicit trade in British manufactured goods existed. After the War of 1812, the primary <b>smuggled</b> <b>good</b> was gypsum from Nova Scotia, which was usually deposited directly into American vessels on or near the border. Smuggling was winked at by both officials and locals in the region, who discouraged outside intervention by British or American authorities who wanted to stop or control it.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{regimes of}} currency inconvertibility in the frame-work {{of a simple}} general equilibrium model where an officially-traded good, a <b>smuggled</b> <b>good</b> and a non-traded good are produced and consumed by residents, who hold domestic and foreign currency in their portfolios. It is shown that stability requires the effect of relative prices on demand for traded and non-traded goods to dominate their effect on asset demands and that a once-and-for-all devaluation {{does not change the}} currency substitution ratio. To the extent that the monetary authorities wish to change the currency composition of private financial wealth, a crawling peg is therefore the appropriate instrument. The direction of change depends on the nature of expectations about relative asset returns. Under perfect foresight, an increase in the rate of crawl increases the currency substitution ratio whereas, if expectations are static, it reduces it...|$|E

50|$|Much {{smuggling}} {{occurs when}} enterprising merchants attempt to supply {{demand for a}} good or service that is illegal or heavily taxed. As a result, illegal drug trafficking, and the smuggling of weapons (illegal arms trade), {{as well as the}} historical staples of smuggling, alcohol and tobacco, are widespread. As the smuggler faces significant risk of civil and criminal penalties if caught with contraband, smugglers are able to impose a significant price premium on <b>smuggled</b> <b>goods.</b> The profits involved in <b>smuggling</b> <b>goods</b> appear to be extensive. The Iron Law of Prohibition dictates that greater enforcement results in more potent alcohol and drugs being smuggled.|$|R

50|$|The first large {{export of}} weapons from Bulgaria was to Algeria in 1961-1962. Kintex {{maintained}} three bases in Sofia to load <b>smuggled</b> <b>goods.</b> These shipments were conveyed by sea to Turkey, {{traveling through the}} ports of Varna and Burgas. They were shipped aboard Bulgarian or foreign ships. Kintex realized an annual revenue from <b>smuggling</b> <b>goods</b> of between $5 million and $15 million. In the first years money was transported in suitcases. Following 1985 payments were made via transborder companies which were established by Bulgarian state security and the foreign trade ministry, usually in offshore zones. These entities were shielded by local citizens who were agents of the secret police.|$|R

40|$|Earlier {{models of}} {{smuggling}} are deficient in their treatment {{of risk and}} transport costs. A model of <b>smuggling</b> of agricultural <b>goods</b> in an intra-EEC context is constructed, with due regard to such costs. <b>Smuggling</b> of agricultural <b>goods</b> is an increasing cost industry, not because of unspecified or unplausible externalities, as in earlier papers, but because of increasing transport costs as the extensive margin of source-locations for <b>smuggled</b> <b>goods</b> is expanded. In consequence, intra-marginal smugglers can earn economic rents. The theoretical model is supported by empirical studies of trade between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland...|$|R
