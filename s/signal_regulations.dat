60|$|The {{scene of}} his new labours was an {{elevated}} box {{at the side of}} the line, not far from Gertie's home. As this box was rather curious we shall describe it. It was a huge square sentry-box, with three of its sides composed of windows; these commanded a view of the line in all directions. On the fourth side of the box hung a time-piece and a framed copy of <b>signal</b> <b>regulations.</b> There was a diminutive stove in one corner, and a chest in another. In front of the box facing the clock were two telegraphic instruments, and a row of eight or ten long iron levers, which very much resembled a row of muskets in a rack. These levers were formidable instruments in aspect and in fact, for they not only cost Sam a pretty strong effort to move them, but they moved points and signals, on the correct and prompt movements of which depended the safety of the line, and the lives of human beings.|$|E
40|$|The {{structural}} plasticity of dendritic spines {{is considered}} to be essential for various forms of synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory. The process is mediated by a complex signaling network consisting of numerous species of molecules. Furthermore, the spatiotemporal dynamics of the biochemical signaling are regulated in a complicated manner because of geometrical restrictions from the unique morphology of the dendritic branches and spines. Recent advances in optical techniques have enabled the exploration of the spatiotemporal aspects of the <b>signal</b> <b>regulations</b> in spines and dendrites and have provided many insights into the principle of the biochemical computation that underlies spine structural plasticity.

30|$|Introduction Mitochondria are {{evolutionary}} endosymbionts {{that are}} derived from ancestral aerobic bacteria and so might bear and release bacterial molecular motifs supporting the role of mitochondria in danger <b>signal</b> <b>regulations.</b> Free circulating mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is elevated in a wild range of critical illness observed in intensive care units, and is associated with bad outcomes and mortality. The mtDNA is a molecular pattern that belongs to mitochondrial damage associated molecular patterns (mtDAMPs), and can interact with pattern recognition receptors (PRR) to induce self defense reaction. Free mtDNA activates inflammatory signaling pathways through Toll-like endosomal receptor 9 (TLR 9) interactions. Nevertheless, new evidence advocates a role of the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) in mtDNA signaling. Experimental data suggest a role of mtDNA-PRR interaction in systemic inflammation and organ dysfunctions as septic acute kidney injury or pulmonary inflammation. Impact of free circulating mtDNA on endothelial cell is not known.|$|E

40|$|Road Traffic Crashes (RTCs) {{are one of}} {{the leading}} causes of {{premature}} deaths in Ghana. Recently, after the rehabilitation of a very critical link on the N 1 -Highway in Accra, RTCs have soared. The prevalence of traffic injuries and fatalities has attracted the attention of both, road safety professionals and policy makers. Road user behavior has been established to contribute significantly to RTCs. The object of this study was therefore to assess the attitude of both pedestrians and motorists in relation to compliance with traffic safety regulation on the N 1 -Highway. Covert but unobstructed spot speeds studies were undertaken at accident-prone location on the highway with posted speed limit of 70 km/h. Besides, driver compliance with traffic <b>signal</b> <b>regulations</b> and pedestrian road crossing behavior were also assessed. The 85 th percentile speeds realized was 78. 2 km/h, which was in excess of the posted speed limit. In all, 42, 298 motorists were registered, of which 0. 3 % was observed run the red traffic lights during the day on the highway. More than 1 in 5 of the 105, 151 pedestrian observed jaywalked. Road user behavior undoubtedly, presents a significant road safety challenge on the N 1 -Highway. Road user education and training must be pursued and sustained, alongside strict enforcement of traffic safety regulations to modify road user, while considering legislation to regulate pedestrian behavior in traffic for safer travels...|$|E
40|$|Bradykinin (BK) is a vasorelaxant, algesic and {{inflammatory}} agent. Angiotensin II (AngII) {{is known}} to control vascular tone and promote growth, inflammation and artherogenesis. There is evidence for cross talking between BK and AngII receptors. Therefore, the effect of lack of kinin receptors was assessed in mice with genetic disruption of B(1) or B(2) and both receptors. Responsiveness of abdominal aortic rings to BK and AngII {{as well as the}} receptor gene expression of both peptides were analysed. Although no specific phenotype was displayed in the normotensive and healthy mice lacking the kinin receptors, a decreased expression level of the remaining kinin receptor mRNA was observed. AT(1) receptor mRNA level was also reduced, indicating that kinin receptors regulate AngII receptors. Downregulation of the receptors was well correlated with reduction in the reactivity of both agonists to induce contraction of aortic rings, but other <b>signal</b> <b>regulations</b> must be sought in these transgenic mice. We conclude that cross talk between kinin and AngII receptors occurs in mouse abdominal aorta and that both peptides may regulate the initiation and progression of important pathophysiological processes, such as hypertension and inflammation.

40|$|Understanding traffic statics and {{dynamics}} in urban networks {{is critical to}} develop effective control and management strategies. In this paper, we provide a novel approach to study the traffic statics {{and dynamics}} in a signalized double-ring network, which can provide insights into the operation of more general signalized traffic networks. Under {{the framework of the}} link queue model (LQM) and the assumption of a triangular traffic flow fundamental diagram, the signalized double-ring network is studied as a switched affine system. Due to periodic <b>signal</b> <b>regulations,</b> periodic density evolution orbits are formed and defined as stationary states. A Poincaré map approach is introduced to analyze the properties of such stationary states. With short cycle lengths, closed-form Poincaré maps are derived. Stationary states and their stability properties are obtained by finding and analyzing the fixed points on the Poincaré maps. It is found that a stationary state can be asymptotically stable, Lyapunov stable, or unstable. The impacts of retaining ratios and initial densities on the macroscopic fundamental diagrams (MFDs) and the gridlock times are analyzed. Multivaluedness and gridlock phenomena as well as the unstable branch with non-zero average network flow-rates are observed on the MFDs. With long cycle lengths, fixed points on the Poincaré maps are solved numerically, and the obtained stationary states and the MFDs are very similar to those with short cycle lengths. Compared with earlier studies, this paper provides an analytical framework {{that can be used to}} provide complete and closed-form solutions to the statics and dynamics of double-ring networks. This can lead to a better understanding of how the combination of signalized intersections and turning maneuvers is expected to impact network properties, like the MFD.
