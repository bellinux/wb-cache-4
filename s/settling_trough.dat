40|$|The Bureau of Mines {{surveyed}} {{waste disposal}} sites at 18 metal and non-metal mines and conducted laboratory and full-scale field tests to de-termine {{the effects of}} tailings deposition techniques on physical properties of tailings pond beaches. Survey data included measurements of beach slopes, descriptions of deposition techniques, and measurements of beach physical properties taken at various distances {{from the point of}} discharge. Laboratory tests involved depositing two types of tailings, each with different grain-size distributions, into a <b>settling</b> <b>trough</b> and determining the resultant physical properties of settled materials {{along the length of the}} beach. Side confinement and the closeness of the water pool to the point of deposition caused the laboratory results to be inconclusive. Full-scale field deposition tests conducted at the tailings pond of a cooperating mine showed that there were similarities in relationships between exit velocities of tailings slurry and physical properties of the settled tailings on the beach...|$|E

40|$|The Existence {{of law in}} {{the society}} is badly {{needed to keep the}} orderliness, safety and peace. Besides,law is also used to settle the {{conflicts}} within the society. Some conflicts belong to the civil law occursinacontract law, in which there is an agreement inside. The agreement which made by the involved partsof dispute settlement. If there is a dispute, it will be <b>settled</b> <b>trough</b> the court or outside the court. Theproblem of theresearch is stated as follows: what factors which make the people prefer to settles their civildispute outside the court? The problem is divided into: (1) What reasons which make the civil dispute inthe society of Semarang Municipality? (2) What factors which make the settlement of civil dispute doneoutside the court?; What is the effect of that kind of settlement? The aims of the research are: (1) to knowthe reasons of emerging the civil dispute in Semarang Municipality; (2) to know the factors which makethe people settle their civil dispute outside the court. The result shows that the factor, which influencesthe catering businessmen/women in settling their dispute outside the court, is motivated by cultural andeconomic factors. Based on the result, it is suggested to settle the dispute outside the court firstly, to getthe intended settlement live, all parts involved in the dispute get the satisfaction and also fulfil their needs...|$|R
40|$|The expeditions ANT-XII/ 4 (1995) and ANT-XVIII/ 5 a (2001) of the RV POLARSTERN {{collected}} extensive bathymetric and seismic {{data sets}} {{as well as}} sediment cores from an area in the Bellingshausen Sea (eastern Pacific Southern Ocean) that allow the first comprehensive geoscientific documentation of an asteroid impact into a deep ocean (approx. 5 km) basin, named the Eltanin impact. Impact deposits have now been recovered from {{a total of more}} than 20 sediment cores collected in an area covering about 80, 000 km 2. Combined biomagnetostratigraphic dating places the impact event into the earliest Matuyama Chron, a period of enhanced climate variability. Sediment texture analyses and studies of sediment composition including grain size and microfossil distribution reveal the pattern of impact- related sediment disturbance and the sedimentary processes immediately following the impact event. The pattern is complicated by the San Martin Seamounts (approx. 57. 5 S, 91 W), a large topographic elevation that rises up to 3000 m above the surrounding abyssal plain in the area affected by the Eltanin impact. The impact ripped up sediments as old as Eocene and probably Paleocene that have been redeposited in a chaotic assemblage. This is followed by a sequence sedimented from a turbulent flow at the sea floor, overprinted by fall-out of airborne meteoritic ejecta that <b>settled</b> <b>trough</b> the water column. Grain size distribution reveals the timing and interaction of the different sedimentary processes. The gathered estimate of ejecta mass deposited over the studied area, composed of shock-melted asteroidal material and unmelted meteorites including fragments up to 2. 5 cm in diameter, point to an Eltanin asteroid larger than the 1 km in diameter size originally suggested as a minimum based on the ANT-XII/ 4 results. This places the energy released by the impact at the threshold of those considered to cause environmental disturbance at a global scale and it makes the impact a likely transport mechanism explaining the presence of extinct Cenozoic microfossils in the transantarctic Sirius Unit. Although a crater structure representing Eltanin ground zero has not been discovered, the distribution pattern of sediment disturbance and ejecta deposits now allows to better determine the central target area north of the San Martin Seamounts...|$|R
60|$|No attempt {{being made}} to save anything, the wreck was {{floating}} astern in five minutes, and the ship was fortunately extricated from this new hazard. Mr. Truck, {{in spite of his}} acquired coolness, looked piteously at all that gallant hamper, in which he had so lately rejoiced, as yard-arm, cross-trees, tressel-trees, and tops rose on the summits of swells or <b>settled</b> in the <b>troughs,</b> like whales playing their gambols. But habit is a seaman's philosophy, and in no one feature is his character more respectable than in that manliness which disinclines him to mourn over a misfortune that is inevitable.|$|R
5000|$|But his {{thoughts}} now {{turned to the}} great west, and in 1802 he joined his distinguished brother, General George Rogers Clark at the falls of the Ohio, <b>settling</b> finally at <b>Trough</b> Spring, near Louisville, Kentucky. Here he devoted himself to business with great success, accumulating a large fortune in real estate as well as personal property. The inventory of the latter, returned by Abraham Hite, his wife's cousin, and John H. Clark, his son, his administrators, covers eleven pages of book of inventories No. 2, Jefferson county, Kentucky. A glance over the long list shows that fifty-six of his slaves were mentioned by name. The following notice of General Jonathan Clark's death appeared in the Western Sun, published at Vincennes, December 14, 1811: [...] "Another Revolutionary hero is gone--Died at his seat near Louisville, Kentucky, on Monday, the 25th ult. (November, 1811), General Jonathan Clark--He supped with his family on the 24th, retired at his accustomed hour to rest, {{and in the morning}} was found numbered with the dead." ...|$|R
60|$|An {{involuntary}} cry {{of pleasure}} {{burst from the}} lips of Katherine, as she followed his directions, and first beheld the frigate {{through the medium of}} the fluctuating colors of the morning. The undulating outline of the lazy ocean, which rose and fell heavily against the bright boundary of the heavens, was without any relief to distract the eye as it fed eagerly on the beauties of the solitary ship. She was riding sluggishly on the long seas, with only two of her lower and smaller sails spread, to hold her in command; but her tall masts and heavy yards were painted against the fiery sky in strong lines of deep black, while even the smallest cord in the mazes of her rigging might be distinctly traced, stretching from spar to spar, with the beautiful accuracy of a picture. At moments, when her huge hull rose on a billow and was lifted against the background of the sky, its shape and dimensions were brought into view; but these transient glimpses were soon lost, as it <b>settled</b> into the <b>trough,</b> leaving the waving spars bowing gracefully towards the waters, as if about to follow the vessel into the bosom of the deep. As a clearer light gradually stole on the senses, the delusion of colors and distance vanished together, and when a flood of day preceded the immediate appearance of the sun, the ship became plainly visible within a mile of the cutter, her black hull checkered with ports, and her high, tapering masts exhibiting their proper proportions and hues.|$|R
40|$|In a nonadhesive environment, cells will self-assemble into microtissues, {{a process}} {{relevant}} to tissue engineering. Although {{this has been}} recognized for some time, there is no basis for quantitative characterization of this complex process. Here we describe a recently developed assay designed to quantify aspects {{of the process and}} discuss its application in comparing behaviors between cell types. Cells were seeded in nonadhesive micromolded wells, each well with a circular trough at its base formed by the cylindrical sidewalls and by a central peg {{in the form of a}} right circular cone. Cells <b>settled</b> into the <b>trough</b> and coalesced into a toroid, which was then driven up the conical peg by the forces of self-assembly. The mass of the toroid and its rate of upward movement were used to calculate the cell power expended in the process against gravity. The power of the toroid was found to be 0. 31 ± 0. 01 pJ/h and 4. 3 ± 1. 7 pJ/h for hepatocyte cells and fibroblasts, respectively. Blocking Rho kinase by means of Y- 27632 resulted in a 50 % and greater reduction in power expended by each type of toroid, indicating that cytoskeletal-mediated contraction plays a significant role in the self-assembly of both cell types. Whereas the driving force for self-assembly has often been viewed as the binding of surface proteins, these data show that cellular contraction is important for cell–cell adhesion. The power measurement quantifies the contribution of cell contraction, and will be useful for understanding the concerted action of the mechanisms that drive self-assembly...|$|R
6000|$|I now went aft {{to speak}} to Tibbets, telling him I {{thought it was all}} over with us. He had still some hope, as the bay was deep, and he thought light might return before we got to the bottom of it. I was of a {{different}} opinion, believing the brig then to be within the influence of the ground-swell, though not absolutely within the breakers. All this time the people were quiet, and there was no drinking. Indeed, I hardly saw any one moving about. It was an hour after the conversation with Tibbets, that I was standing, holding on by the weather-main-clew-garnet, when I got a glimpse of breakers directly under our lee. I sung out, [...] "there's breakers, and everybody must shift for himself." [...] At the next instant, the brig rose on a sea, <b>settled</b> in the <b>trough,</b> and struck. The blow threw me off my feet, though I held on to the clew-garnet. Then I heard the crash of the foremast as it went down to leeward. The brig rolled over on her beam-ends, but righted at the next sea, drove in some distance, and down she came again, with a force that threatened to break her up. I bethought me of the main-mast, and managed to get forward as far as the bitts, in order to be out of its way. It was well I did, as I felt a movement as if her upper works were parting from the bottom. I was near no one, and the last person I saw, or spoke to on board, was Tibbets, who was then standing in the companion-way. This was an hour before the brig struck.|$|R
60|$|The intense {{darkness}} of the night added to the horrors of that awful moment. Nevertheless, the effect was to arouse all that there was of manliness and seamanship in Captain Crutchely, who from that instant appeared to be himself again. His orders were issued coolly, clearly and promptly, and they were obeyed as experienced mariners will work at an instant like that. The sails were all clewed up, and the heaviest of them were furled. Hillson was ordered to clear away an anchor, while Mark was attending to the canvas. In the mean time, the captain watched {{the movements of the}} ship. He had dropped a lead alongside, and by that he ascertained that they were still beating ahead. The thumps were not very hard, and the white water was soon left astern, none having washed on deck. All this was so much proof that the place on which they had struck must have had nearly water enough to float the vessel, a fact that the lead itself corroborated. Fifteen feet aft was all the Rancocus wanted, in her actual trim, and the lead showed a good three fathoms, at times. It was when the ship <b>settled</b> in the <b>troughs</b> of the sea that she felt the bottom. Satisfied that his vessel was likely to beat over the present difficulty, Captain Crutchely now gave all his attention to getting her anchored as near the reef and to leeward of it, as possible. The instant she went clear, a result he now expected every moment, he was determined to drop one of his bower anchors, and wait for daylight, before he took any further steps to extricate himself from the danger by which he was surrounded.|$|R
