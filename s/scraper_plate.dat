40|$|We {{monitored}} the vertical distribution of (137) Cs in soil profiles under eight different land {{uses for the}} 2  y after the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant accident, and discussed the temporal changes in the early-stage of the migration and the determinants of the initial distribution. The soil samples were collected for four surveys using a <b>scraper</b> <b>plate</b> at each study site, which consisted of three forests (mixed forest, mature cedar, and young cedar), two grasslands (pasture and meadow) and three abandoned agricultural fields (farm land, tobacco field, and paddy field). The land use patterns have a large influence on some soil properties and the migration processes of (137) Cs above ground, resulting in different distribution of (137) Cs in those soil profiles. Specifically, the secondary deposition of (137) Cs from the coniferous canopy, retention of (137) Cs by litter layer, and the homogenization of (137) Cs concentrations in surface soil by natural soil mixing such as the disturbance by cattle grazing, roots growing {{and the formation of}} needle ice were important to cause redistribution of the deposited (137) Cs. Only in the paddy field, the (137) Cs inventory in subsurface soils (5 - 10  cm) gradually increased and comprised 26 % of the total (137) Cs in 2  y, showing the downward migration of (137) Cs to subsurface soil. In the other sites, it was considered that (137) Cs were strongly adsorbed by soil particles and rarely migrated downward as soluble form. Vertical distributions during the first survey were able to be used as the initial distributions and were well fitted to the exponential equation. The distribution parameters α (relaxation depth) and β (relaxation mass depth), calculated by the exponential equation were correlated with RIP (r = - 0. 806, p <  0. 05), macro pore (r =  0. 651, p =  0. 11), and dispersible fine particle content (r =  0. 856, p <  0. 05). It indicated that the initial distribution would be influenced by the Cs fixation ability of soil, and the penetration process of water and particles in soils...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDuring the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) accident, {{radioactive}} cesium {{was released}} in the environment and deposited on the soils. Depth profiles of radioactive cesium in contaminated soils provide useful information not only for radiation protection and decontamination operations but also for geoscience and radioecology studies. Soil samples were collected using a <b>scraper</b> <b>plate</b> three times between December 2011 and December 2012 at 84 or 85 locations within a 100 -km radius of the Fukushima Dai-ichi NPP. In most of the obtained radioactive cesium depth profiles, {{it was possible to}} fit the concentration to a function of mass depth as either an exponential or hyperbolic secant function. By using those functions, following three parameters were estimated: (i) relaxation mass depth β (g cm− 2), (ii) effective relaxation mass depth βeff (g cm− 2), which is defined for a hyperbolic secant function as the relaxation mass depth of an equivalent exponential function giving the same air kerma rate at 1  m above the ground as the inventory, and (iii) 1 / 10 depth L 1 / 10 (cm), at which the soil contains 90 % of the inventory. The average β value (wet weight) including ones by hyperbolic secant function in December 2012, was 1. 29 times higher than that in December 2011. In fact, it was observed that depth profiles at some study sites deviated from the typical exponential distributions over time. These results indicate the gradual downward migration of radioactive cesium in the soils. The L 1 / 10 values in December 2012 were summarized and presented on a map surrounding the Fukushima Dai-ichi NPP, and the average value of L 1 / 10 was 3. 01  cm (n =  82) at this time. It was found that radioactive cesium remained within 5  cm of the ground surface at most study sites (71 sites). The sech function {{can also be used to}} estimate the downward migration rate V (kg m− 2  y− 1). The V values in December 2012 (n =  25) were in good agreement with those found by a realistic approach using a diffusion and migration model. Almost all values ranged between 1. 7 and 9. 6  kg m− 2  y− 1 in this study...|$|E

40|$|We report {{measurements}} of transverse beam halo in mismatched proton beams in a 52 -quadrupole FODO transport channel following the 6. 7 -MeV LEDA RFQ. Beam profiles in both transverse planes are measured using beam-profile diagnostic devices that {{consist of a}} movable carbon filament for measurement of the dense beam core, and <b>scraper</b> <b>plates</b> for measurement of the halo. The gradients of the first four quadrupoles can be independently adjusted to mismatch the RFQ output beam into the beam-transport channel. The properties of the measured mismatched beam profiles in the transport channel will be compared with predictions from multiparticle beam-dynamics simulations...|$|R
40|$|We report {{measurements}} of transverse beam-halo formation in mismatched proton beams in a 52 -quadrupole FODO-transport channel following the 6. 7 MeV RFQ at the Low-Energy Demonstration Accelerator (LEDA) at Los Alamos. Beam profiles in both transverse planes were measured {{using a new}} diagnostic device that consists of a movable carbon filament for measurement of the beam core, and <b>scraper</b> <b>plates</b> for measurement of the outer part of the distributions. The initial results indicate a surprisingly strong growth rate of the rms emittance even for the modest space-charge tune depressions of the experiment.

50|$|A <b>plate</b> <b>scraper</b> {{consists}} of a plastic, wooden, or metal handle attached to a flexible rubber head. Although the original use of the implement was to remove food from plates before washing, its use has evolved to more of a utilitarian implement, the bowl scraper.|$|R
50|$|Bowl {{scrapers}} (also {{known as}} rubber feet) are, {{as the name}} suggests, used to remove material from mixing bowls. Often, a <b>plate</b> <b>scraper</b> is used for this purpose, particularly since the long handle allows it {{to be used to}} remove contents of bowls as well as jars, such as mayonnaise jars; however, for bowls, dedicated scrapers are available, lacking the handle, and consisting of a flat, flexible piece of plastic or silicone rubber sized for convenient holding with the palm and fingers, with a curved edge to match the curvature of the average bowl. The degree of curvature can vary from a slight curvature along one edge of a rectangle, to a complex shape composed of changing radii to adapt better to bowls of different sizes. Sometimes a hole is provided in one corner, to allow for hanging the utensil, as well as for placement of the thumb to allow for more secure grip. Prices vary from below one American dollar, to as much as $20 American.|$|R
