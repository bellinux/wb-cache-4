40|$|Department of Management EngineeringGlobal {{shipbuilding}} {{industry has}} gone through a tough time due to the reduction of <b>shipping</b> <b>order</b> quantities and shipbuilding tonnages since the global financial crisis of 2008. To overcome the challenges, big data analysis is expected to be an effective solution to increase the practical efficiency in the shipbuilding industry. After an organization applies big data analysis, benefits, such as better aimed marketing, more straightforward straight-forward business insights, client based segmentation, and recognition of sales and market chances, are anticipated. In the future, the key for competitiveness is finding an appropriate way of applying big data analysis. Although numerous studies for big data analysis are conducted, the studies tend to focus on the technical aspect of analyzing data including method, algorithm, and architecture. Therefore, it is required to study how to applying the analysis technique in the practice, specifically shipbuilding industry in this study. In this thesis, the reference model for big data analysis in shipbuilding industry is developed. The proposed reference model provides the big data analysis guideline according to four phases such as contract, design, production, and service. They are categorized based on value chain of shipbuilding industry. Each phase consists of three levels of big data analysis, e. g., category of analysis, analysis method, and detailed algorithm. Moreover, the importance of the analysis method is determined in order to increase the applicability of the reference model. To verify the validation of the model, experts of the shipbuilding industry consulted the model it is consulted by the experts of the shipbuilding industry. ope...|$|E
40|$|Basically, {{there are}} two models of export {{activity}} they are direct and indirect export. PT. Indo Veneer Utama is an export company moves on furniture in Karanganyar. This company has exports its product to Australian Country. Export activity of PT. Indo Veneer Utama recently is indirect exporter. The marketing of this product is helped by a mediator namely S 2 dio. The researcher has done the study in PT. Indo Veneer Utama by the purpose to study of mediator and exporting problematic faced by PT. Indo Veneer Utama using mediator in products marketing. Research method used in this Final Study is by held the direct observation in PT. Indo Veneer Utama in done interview and reference study. Data used in this research are primary and secondary data. Primary data gained by direct interview to the employees or staffs of exporting department of	PT. Indo Veneer Utama. Secondary data gained from some book or theories from export-import application, marketing strategies, and marketing management. The research result may be concluded that PT. Indo Veneer Utama in its business has been helped by a mediator that is S 2 dio. S 2 dio has an important role as mediator between the corporation and buyers from Australia with PT. Indo Veneer Utama, besides, S 2 dio also involved to monitor directly about products activity held in PT. Indo Veneer Utama by ensure that products has been made s suitable with buyers requirements. S 2 dio also has a role to manage the <b>shipping</b> <b>order</b> until the destination and if there possibility to have a fault in items shipping, so, S 2 dio has a job to recheck and ensure about the items accomplishing. Problematic faced by PT. Indo Veneer Utama using mediator, that is company dependently to mediator {{and there is no}} guarantee to get the ethics from mediator. Suggestion may be proposed here, is it is better the corporation to execute the evaluation bout team-work relationship with E 2 dio to identify if there some problems and tried to solve it, other, in order the firm would less dependence to mediator, so, the corporation is better to search the new buyers from the other countries, to keeps the corporation long life and never only focused to S 2 dio buyers only.

40|$|This study aims {{to apply}} System Dynamics (SD) {{to analyze the}} optimal timing of {{container}} <b>ship</b> <b>orders</b> by considering the uncertain shipping environment. The collected monthly data for 12 years {{was obtained from the}} China seaborne container trade (CSCT) and the China Containerized Freight Index (CCFI). Containership fleet development and the prices of new and second-hand container ships were classified based on five container vessel sizes (January of 2004 –December of 2015). The period of simulation for this study was from 2004 to 2020. To analyze the optimal timing for the container <b>ship</b> <b>orders,</b> container <b>ship</b> fleet development as a supply factor and the CSCT as a demand factor, both of which are components of CCFI, were simulated. After the first simulation, CCFI was simulated holistically. Based on the CCFI simulation results, it was possible to develop three optimal timing scenarios for <b>ship</b> <b>order</b> placement. The CCFI for October 2016 was in the initial entry status of a short-term rebound, which makes it possible for <b>shipping</b> companies to <b>order</b> <b>ships</b> without the risk of revenue loss. The second best time period is May 2018, before the CCFI recovery of May 2019. The third best time for <b>ship</b> <b>orders</b> is later in 2020 for a CCFI recovery after 2021...|$|R
