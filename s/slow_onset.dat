25|$|The primary {{treatment}} for tick paralysis is the careful administration of anti-tick serum. The effectiveness of anti-tick serum is most dependent on how early it is administered. Early treatment {{offers the best}} chance of full recovery. Unlike snake bite, tick envenoming has a relatively <b>slow</b> <b>onset.</b> Despite this <b>slow</b> <b>onset</b> the fatality rate can be very high (even higher than snake bite) if antiserum is not given sufficiently early, before the signs are advanced.|$|E
25|$|However, {{due to its}} slow rate of {{absorption}} and its <b>slow</b> <b>onset</b> of action, oxazepam has {{a relatively}} low potential for abuse compared to some other benzodiazepines, such as temazepam, flunitrazepam, or triazolam, which have a high potential for abuse similar to barbiturates.|$|E
25|$|It is also {{approved}} {{for treatment of}} typical and atypical absences, infantile myoclonic, myoclonic and akinetic seizures. A subgroup of people with treatment resistant epilepsy may benefit from long-term use of clonazepam; the benzodiazepine clorazepate may be an alternative due to its <b>slow</b> <b>onset</b> of tolerance.|$|E

Buprenorphine has a <b>slow</b> <b>onset,</b> has a mild effect, and is very long acting with a half-life of 24 to 60 hours. Once a patient has stabilized on the drug, there are two treatment options: continual use/maintenance, or medically supervised withdrawal from the physical dependence to the drug.|$|E

Disadvantages are the <b>slow</b> <b>onset</b> of adequate anaesthesia, inadequate analgesia for larger procedures, and toxicity of absorbed medication.|$|E
25|$|The {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of asbestosis typically manifest after a significant amount of time has passed following asbestos exposure, often several decades under current conditions in the US. The primary symptom of asbestosis is generally the <b>slow</b> <b>onset</b> of shortness of breath, especially with physical activity. Clinically advanced cases of asbestosis may lead to respiratory failure. When a physician listens with a stethoscope to the lungs of a person with asbestosis, they may hear inspiratory crackles.|$|E

5000|$|... 3,4-CTMP, the threo-diastereomer, is {{approximately}} seven times more potent than methylphenidate in animal studies, but has weaker reinforcing effects {{due to its}} <b>slower</b> <b>onset</b> of action.

50|$|Dichloropane ((−)-2β-Carbomethoxy-3β-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)tropane, RTI-111, O-401) is a {{stimulant}} of the phenyltropane {{class that}} acts as a serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (SNDRI) with IC50 values of 3.13, 0.79 and 18 nM, respectively. In animal studies, dichloropane had a <b>slower</b> <b>onset</b> and longer duration of action compared to cocaine.|$|R
25|$|It is an intermediate-acting {{benzodiazepine}} with a <b>slow</b> <b>onset</b> of action, so it {{is usually}} prescribed to individuals who have trouble staying asleep, rather than falling asleep. It is commonly prescribed for anxiety disorders with associated tension, irritability, and agitation. It is also prescribed for drug and alcohol withdrawal, and for anxiety associated with depression. Physicians may use oxazepam outside its approved indications to treat social phobia, post-traumatic stress disorder, insomnia, premenstrual syndrome, and other conditions.|$|E
25|$|Signs {{of these}} {{conditions}} include the <b>slow</b> <b>onset</b> of discomfort and pain in the upper shoulder or upper third of the arm and/or difficulty sleeping on the shoulder. Tendinitis and bursitis also cause pain when the arm is lifted {{away from the body}} or overhead. If tendinitis involves the biceps tendon (the tendon located in front of the shoulder that helps bend the elbow and turn the forearm), pain will occur in the front or side of the shoulder and may travel down to the elbow and forearm. Pain may also occur when the arm is forcefully pushed upward overhead.|$|E
500|$|... poisoning, {{sympathomimetic}} toxicity, or worsening psychiatric condition. The condition {{most often}} confused with serotonin syndrome is neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). The clinical features of neuroleptic malignant syndrome and serotonin syndrome share some features {{which can make}} differentiating them difficult. In both conditions, autonomic dysfunction and altered mental status develop. However, they are actually very different conditions with different underlying dysfunction (serotonin excess vs dopamine blockade). Both the time course and the clinical features of NMS differ significantly from those of serotonin toxicity. Serotonin toxicity has a rapid onset after the administration of a serotonergic drug and responds to serotonin blockade such as drugs like chlorpromazine and cyproheptadine. Dopamine receptor blockade (NMS) has a <b>slow</b> <b>onset</b> and typically evolves over several days after administration of a neuroleptic drug and responds to dopamine agonists such as bromocriptine.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{investigated}} {{the time course of}} modulation of synaptic transmission by group II and group III metabotropic glutamate receptors in region CA 1 of the hippocampus. In {{the presence of}} 50 mM picrotoxin, pressure pulse application of 1 mM glutamate resulted in a fast onset of suppression of synaptic transmission in stratum lacunosum moleculare and a <b>slower</b> <b>onset</b> of suppression in stratum radiatum, with both effects returning to baseline {{over the course of several}} minutes. Application of 50 mM of the group II agonist (2 R, 4 R) -APDC in stratum lacunosum moleculare resulted in the same fast onset of suppression while having no effect in stratum radiatum. Pressure pulse application of 100 mM DL-AP 4 instratum lacunosum moleculare and stratum radiatum resulted in a much <b>slower</b> <b>onset</b> of suppression of synaptic transmission than (2 R, 4 R) -APDC. Suppression by (2 R, 4 R) -APDC was accompanied by a rapid enhancement of paired pulse facilitation, indicative of a presynaptic mechanism. This demonstrates that activation of group II mGluRs in the hippocampus causes a fast onset of suppression in stratum lacunosum moleculare, while activation of group III mGluRs causes a <b>slower</b> <b>onset</b> of suppression. The difference in time course for group II vs. group III mGluRs suggests a different functional role, with group II playing a potential role in making synapses act as low pass filters.

40|$|Patients with severe, painful {{injuries}} and illnesses {{treated in the}} emergency department are commonly administered opioid medications. Intravenous administration provides the most rapid onset of pain relief and is readily titrated. Fentanyl, administered intravenously, is well documented as an effective medication for pain management in the emergency department. It is preferred in many settings due to its minimal hemodynamic effects, as compared to other commonly used opioids. However, not all patients require intravenous access. These patients are given orally administered pain medications. The oral route is effective at minimizing pain but has a much <b>slower</b> <b>onset</b> of action {{when compared to the}} intravenous route. As an alternative to the <b>slower</b> <b>onset</b> of action seen with oral opioids, this paper discusses the use of fentanyl buccal tablet for pain management in the emergency department. Fentanyl buccal tablets are readily absorbed, with a bioavailability of approximately 65 %, and have a more rapid onset of action than achieved with traditional oral opioids used in the emergency department...|$|R
