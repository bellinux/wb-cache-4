40|$|This paper studies scoring auctions, a {{procedure}} {{commonly used to}} buy di¤erentiated products: suppliers submit o¤ers on all dimensions of the good (price, level of non monetary attributes), and these are evaluated using a scoring rule. We provide a systematic analysis of equilibrium behavior in scoring auctions when <b>suppliers</b> <b>private</b> information is multidimensional (char-acterization of equilibrium behavior and expected utility equivalence). In addition, we show that scoring auctions dominate several other commonly used procedures for buying di¤erenti-ated products, including menu auctions, beauty contests and price-only auctions with minimum quality thresholds...|$|E
40|$|This {{monographic}} publication {{contributes to}} {{the debate about the}} relations between the agents intervening in the healthcare system (government authorities, Social Security, <b>suppliers,</b> <b>private</b> insurers, patients and pharmaceutical companies) and the health spending contention now being exercised in various European Union countries. As part of the broader discussion on whether competition in health insurance and care delivery can improve efficiency and bring down costs only at the expense of equity and service quality, the book focuses on two particularly controversial aspects: namely, price regulation and drug co-payment in the pharmaceutical industry; and health market negotiation mechanisms (that is, the competitive relations between suppliers and payers). It looks in depth at the economic background to alternative courses of action, and their implications in terms of demand elasticity and market interactions. Its findings, it is hoped, will provide solid theoretic grounds for the policymakers in charge of health system reform to construct expenditure control models based on formal economic thought as a means to optimize resources. This should lead to more robust policies that can maintain the efficiency of public healthcare without sacrificing equity or quality. Provider_Name: Fundacion BBVA / BBVA Foundation...|$|E

This paper aims to investigate how traceability {{may be used}} to screen <b>supplier</b> for <b>private</b> labels dedicated provider pools. Retailers in the UK and Italy have several private label product lines and increasingly select dedicated suppliers. The choice of providers is a typical agency problem as retailers contract the production for their private labels, having incomplete information on types and effort of their suppliers. Different contracts must be designed for <b>suppliers</b> of <b>private</b> labels depending on position of the product line and its food safety risk. A case study, based on the second largest Italian retailer reveals that traceability and quality assurance schemes are used together to manage <b>suppliers</b> of <b>private</b> labels...|$|R

40|$|Cameroon is {{committed}} to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation plus conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of carbon stocks (REDD+). To achieve this goal, the government has introduced a series of policy reforms and formulated {{a number of key}} strategic planning documents to advance the REDD+ readiness process in Cameroon. This paper assesses the extent to which major cross-sectoral policies support or impede {{the development and implementation of}} an optimal REDD+ strategy in Cameroon from a comparative multi-criteria perspective. Study results reveal that a majority of the policy instruments reviewed appeared to be less prescriptive in terms of any tangible REDD+ strategy, as they do not have provisions for tangible measures to reduce deforestation and forest degradation. Given the lack of adequate flexibility, prompt review and responsiveness of these cross-sectoral policies to adapt themselves to new realities and respond to a changing environment, this paper introduces a GIS-REDD+ decision support system (GIS-REDD+DSS) that is necessary to support the adaptive element of an adaptive REDD+ strategy in Cameroon. The GIS-REDD+DSS, an electronic REDD+agri intermediary hub, serves the following purpose: (1) host a database of locally-relevant climate information, improved input technologies, best practices as well as land use and forest cover geo-spatial maps; (2) host a virtual economic tool that performs economic valuations (costs and benefits) and financial analysis of REDD+agri projects to aid investment decision-making; and (3) host an electronic marketplace to mediate any-to-any transactions among REDD+agri project developers, service providers, input <b>suppliers,</b> <b>private</b> and institutional investors and buyers (wholesalers and retailers), thereby creating value in two ways: aggregation and matching. This decision support tool, we argue, is a fundamental prerequisite for “policy and REDD+ safeguard integration” innovation that allows new scientific findings to be integrated into REDD+ strategies in a short period of time.

40|$|A project {{requires}} an initial specific investment. The toatl {{cost of the}} project depends on {{the probability that the}} supplier will experience a delay in the production schedule. This probability is the <b>supplier's</b> <b>private</b> information. The buyer wouls like to hire a supplier with a low probability of delay. However, it can offer a screening contract only by committing to terminate the project if the supplier is not able to complete it within the original budget limits. We show that cost observability may prevent the buyer from terminating a cost overrun project and this, in turn, prevents screening out bad suppliers. Thus, we provide an example in which superior monitoring ability represents a disadvantage for the buyer. This finding contrast with the common argument that better monitoring represents an advantage of integrated organizations...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{analyze the}} {{interaction}} between revenue sharing and quality of order fulfillment that occurs in an Internet drop-shipping distribution system comprising an e-tailer and a supplier. The e-tailer manages sales activities and sends customer orders to the supplier, while the supplier fulfills the order. With drop-shipping strategy, the e-tailer cannot monitor or control the supplier's shipping operations and takes the risk of loss due to the supplier's inefficient deliveries. Using a Stackelberg game, we explore how the e-tailer (leader) can give the supplier (follower) appropriate incentive to improve the level of delivery reliability. We also address whether and when the supplier is willing to share its private cost information with the e-tailer. Since the e-tailer is always better off by knowing the <b>supplier's</b> <b>private</b> information, we study three possible strategies for the e-tailer to extract more accurate cost information from the supplier. Among them, we find that strategic partnership and utilization of information leakage are feasible strategies while a side payment is not. ...|$|R
40|$|We study a {{manufacturer}} that faces a <b>supplier</b> privileged with <b>private</b> information about supply disruptions. We investigate how risk-management {{strategies of the}} manufacturer change and examine whether risk-management tools {{are more or less}} valuable in the presence of such asymmetric information. We model a supply chain with one manufacturer and one supplier, in which the supplier's reliability is either high or low and is the <b>supplier's</b> <b>private</b> information. On disruption, the supplier chooses to either pay a penalty to the manufacturer for the shortfall or use backup production to fill the manufacturer's order. Using mechanism design theory, we derive the optimal contract menu offered by the manufacturer. We find that information asymmetry may cause the less reliable supplier type to stop using backup production while the more reliable supplier type continues to use it. Additionally, the manufacturer may stop ordering from the less reliable supplier type altogether. The value of supplier backup production for the manufacturer is not necessarily larger under symmetric information; for the more reliable supplier type, it could be negative. The manufacturer is willing to pay the most for information when supplier backup production is moderately expensive. The value of information may increase as supplier types become uniformly more reliable. Thus, higher reliability need not be a substitute for better information. supply risk, mechanism design, contract, nondelivery penalty...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: In Tanzania {{the supply}} of {{pharmaceuticals}} is from public and private. In public sector Medical Stores Department is the sole supplier of pharmaceuticals to public health facilities. When MSD is out of stoc k of some items, the public health facilities purchase from <b>private</b> <b>suppliers.</b> It is not known if these health facilities follow the rules and regulation set in the Public Procurement Act of 2011 and its Regulations when procuring from these <b>private</b> <b>suppliers.</b> This study explores the reasons for procure from <b>private</b> <b>suppliers</b> and if the health facilities follows appropriate procurement methods and tendering process {{as stated in the}} Act. OBJECTIVES: The aim {{of the study was to}} explore the procurement practic es in district hospitals, whether they adhere to policies and regulations when purchasing pharmaceuticals from private suppliers; and to identify challenges faced by these public hospitals during the whole process. METHODOLOGY:A cross sectional design was used. The study was conducted in five district hospitals, three from Dar-es-salaam; Amana, Mwananyamala and Temeke and two from Coast region including Bagamoyo and Tumbi. A number of recorded documents were reviewed to capture informations on procurement process. A sub study was done through use of structured questionnaire to assess the level of knowledge of personnels dealing with procurement in selected health facilities and challenges faced when procuring pharmaceuticals from <b>private</b> <b>suppliers.</b> RESULTS: The study revealed a number of weakness in implentation of PP Act and its Regulations, including lack of of Annual Procurement Plans, non compliance with contract specification, poor record keeping of adverts, and Time for submission of price quotation. Some of the major challenges facing the pharmaceutical sector include high price of pharmaceuticals, failure of suppliers to fulfill orders and meeting specification, insufficient funds to pay for pharmaceuticals and the process is time consuming. These le ad to unsafe practices, and reliance on outside agencies. Despite of the mention weakness, these hospitals performed better in number of indicators; the use of appropriate procurement method, Establishment of Tender Board and establishment of Evaluation sub-committee. vi CONCLUSION: Procurement of pharmaceuticals from <b>private</b> <b>suppliers</b> in public hospitals is not adhering to regulation. The hospitals over use fund due to lack of procurement plans, therefore products are procured out of estimated budget. Despite the fact <b>Private</b> <b>suppliers</b> are alternative source of MSD still they fail to fulfill orders and complying according to specifications.
