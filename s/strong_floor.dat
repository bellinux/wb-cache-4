The facility will combine the capability to test large-scale multiple bay, multi-storey structures, subject to real fires with real fuel loads, while applying controlled loads both vertically and laterally and providing data on heat release rates and gas analysis.

Reinforcing bar was delivered and then caged into the hole with four inch spacing where threaded anchors will fit to be flush with the top of the floor.

The bottom stub was fixed to the <b>strong</b> <b>floor</b> with anchors. In order to enforce zero moment at the mid-span of the coupling beam, the axis of the actuator was arranged to pass through the mid-span. Also, two roller supports were installed near the ends of the steel frame to prevent the top stub from rotation but allow horizontal translation. Also, the supports were to restrain the elongation of the coupling beam. In a coupled wall system, coupling beams tends to elongate axially when lateral loading causes severe cracking in concrete and inelastic residual strains in the longitudinal bars. However, such elongation was restrained due to large in-plane stiffness and strength of adjoining shear walls, consequently imposing compression in the coupling beams (Barbachyn et al. 2012). Stoppers were installed at the ends of the bottom stub to prevent the specimen from sliding.|$|E

40|$|Study Design: Cross-sectional {{secondary}} {{analysis of}} a prospective cohort study Background: The Quick-DASH is a widely used outcome measure which has been extensively evaluated using classical test theory (CTT). Rasch model analysis can identify {{strengths and weaknesses of}} rating scales which goes beyond CTT approaches. It uses a mathematical model to test the fit between the observed data and expected responses and converts ordinal-level scores into interval-level measurement. Objective: To test the structural validity of the Quick-DASH using Rasch analysis Methods: A prospective cohort study of 1030 patients with shoulder pain provided baseline data. Rasch analysis was conducted to i) assess how the Quick-DASH fits the Rasch model, ii) identify sources of misfit and iii) explore potential solutions to these. Results: There was evidence of multidimensionality and significant misfit to the Rasch model (χ²= 331. 04, p< 0. 001). Two items had disordered threshold responses with <b>strong</b> <b>flooring</b> effects. Response bias was detected in most items for age and gender. Rescoring resulted in ordered thresholds, however the 11 -item scale still did not meet the expectations of the Rasch model. Conclusion: Rasch model analysis on the Quick-DASH has identified a number of problems which cannot be easily detected using traditional analyses. Whilst revisions to the Quick-DASH resulted in better fit, a ‘shoulder-specific’ version is not advocated at present. Caution needs to be exercised when interpreting results of the Quick-DASH outcome measure as it does not meet the criteria for interval level measurement and shows significant response bias by age and gender...|$|R
