25|$|An unusual {{feature of}} Persian poetry, {{which is not}} found in Arabic or Latin and Greek verse, is that instead of two lengths of {{syllable}}s (long and short), there are three lengths (<b>short,</b> <b>long,</b> and overlong). Overlong syllables can be used instead of a long syllable plus a short one, or {{at the end of}} a verse in place of a long syllable.|$|E
25|$|From a distance, the BWR design {{looks very}} {{different}} from PWR designs because usually a square building is used for containment. Also, because {{there is only one}} loop through the turbines and reactor, and the steam going through the turbines is also slightly radioactive, the turbine building has to be considerably shielded as well. This leads to two buildings of similar construction with the taller one housing the reactor and the <b>short</b> <b>long</b> one housing the turbine hall and supporting structures.|$|E

25|$|In {{what was}} Frank Thomas' first game as Alabama head coach, Alabama opened the 1931 {{season with a}} 42–6 victory over Howard College (now Samford University) at Denny Stadium. The Crimson Tide took a 14–0 lead into halftime after Leon Long scored on {{touchdown}} runs of one-yard {{in the first and}} five-yards in the second quarter. In the third, Alabama extended their lead to 28–0 when Johnny Cain threw a 59-yard touchdown pass to Hillman Holley, followed by a <b>short</b> <b>Long</b> touchdown run later in the quarter. After Howard scored their only points on a 57-yard touchdown pass late in the third, Alabama closed the game with a pair of fourth-quarter touchdowns. Holley and Larry Hughes each scored on short touchdown runs to make the final score 42–6. Holley starred in the game with his 204 yards rushing and two touchdowns. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against Howard to 12–0.|$|E
25|$|The 2008 general {{elections}} marked {{the return of}} the leftists in the country's power politics, on 18 February 2008. The left oriented, PPP, and conservative PML, won majority of seats together in the election and formed a coalition government; the liberal alliance then finally faded. Yousaf Raza Gillani of PPP became the Prime minister and consolidated his power after ending a policy deadlock in order to lead the movement to impeach the president on 7 August 2008. Before restoring the deposed judiciary, Gillani and his leftist alliance leveled accusation against Musharraf for weakening Pakistan's unity, violating its constitution and creating economic impasse. As momentum on Musharraf gained, President Musharraf began consultations with his close aides on the implications of the impeachment and readily made available himself to reply to the charges levied upon him. Gillani's effective strategy to force Musharraf from presidency succeeded when Pervez Musharraf announced in a very <b>short</b> <b>long</b> televised address to the nation to announce his resignation, ending his nine-year-long reign on 18 August 2008.|$|E

It features a few styling and design cues from the best remembered tri-five (1955–57) models, such as the chrome windshield frame, traffic light viewfinder, and a gas filler cap behind the tail light, similar to 1956–1957 Chevy's gas cap behind the chrome trim {{on the back of}} the tail fin, but more reminiscent of the 1948–1958 Cadillac gas cap tail light.

The elegant, yet simple interior features a twin-element instrument panel, column-mounted gearshift and bench seats covered in soft high-tech fabrics colored red to match the exterior that are cleverly designed to slide forward for easier backseat entry. It also served as a showcase for their new turbocharged inline five-cylinder concept engine based on the L52 (Vortec 3500), straight-5 truck engine. According to a September 2002 GM press release, the all-aluminum 3.5L (211 cu in) 20-valve DOHC engine, with a bore of 93.0mm (3.7in), and a stroke of 102.0mm (4in), that delivers up to 315 horsepower and [...] of torque, mated to a Hydra-Matic 4L60-E electronically controlled four-speed automatic.

It also led the 13th Annual Stater Brothers Route 66 Rendezvous as the official vehicle in September 2002. General Motors has shown no interest in producing the car.|$|E

50|$|As a result, all {{stressed}} syllables came to have heavy syllable weight.
