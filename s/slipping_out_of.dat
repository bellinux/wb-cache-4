5|$|Intent on {{restoring}} {{the supremacy of}} Saladin's direct descendants within the Ayyubid family, an-Nasir Yusuf was eventually able to enlist the backing {{of all of the}} Syria-based Ayyubid emirs in a common cause against Mamluk-dominated Egypt. By 1250, he took Damascus with relative ease and except for Hama and Transjordan, an-Nasir Yusuf's direct authority stood unbroken from the Khabur River in northern Mesopotamia to the Sinai Peninsula. In December 1250, he attacked Egypt after hearing of al-Mu'azzam Turan-Shah's death and the ascension of Shajar al-Durr. An-Nasir Yusuf's army was much larger and better-equipped than that of the Egyptian army, consisting of the forces of Aleppo, Homs, Hama, and those of Saladin's only surviving sons, Nusrat ad-Din and Turan-Shah ibn Salah ad-Din. Nonetheless, it suffered a major defeat at the hands of Aybak's forces. An-Nasir Yusuf subsequently returned to Syria, which was slowly <b>slipping</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his control.|$|E

25|$|Just {{after midnight}} on 1 January 1586 Drake arrived off the Bajos de Haina, and Carleill and his {{soldiers}} {{landed on the}} beach which wasn't guarded. The path through the jungle that led towards the city was also defenseless and the English advanced forward. The main fleet under Drake meanwhile sailed ten miles along the coast to Santo Domingo. The Spanish soon saw the threat; troops were mustered, work began on building earthworks to defend the shore, whilst many of the townspeople began <b>slipping</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the city. At {{the mouth of the}} harbor, three ships were sunk to prevent any attempt to force the entrance but it was too late.|$|E
25|$|Higgins {{started the}} 2012/2013 season well, winning his 25th ranking title at the Shanghai Masters after {{coming back from}} 2–7 down to defeat Judd Trump 10–9 in the final. He made a maximum break during the final, and {{compiled}} another 147 break in his second-round match against Mark Davis at the UK Championship. He also won the minor-ranking Kay Suzanne Memorial Trophy, defeating Trump 4–2 in the final, and reached {{the final of the}} minor-ranking Bulgarian Open, where he lost 0–4 to Trump. However, the season thereafter was another disappointing one for Higgins, who lost 3–4 to unranked amateur Jordan Brown at the minor-ranking Scottish Open and reached only one other semi-final of a major ranking event, the World Open, which he lost 2–6 to Mark Allen. He exited the World Championship in the first round, losing 6–10 to Mark Davis. Afterward, he admitted that doubts about whether he could remain at the pinnacle of the sport after 20 years as a professional had affected his form. He finished the season ranked 11th, <b>slipping</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the top 10 {{for the first time in}} 17 seasons.|$|E
25|$|On 6 December 2002, {{the first}} ground {{tests of the}} BA609 {{prototype}} began, and the first flight took place on 6 March 2003 in Arlington, Texas, flown by test pilots Roy Hopkins and Dwayne Williams. After 14 hours of helicopter-mode flight testing, the prototype was moved to a ground testing rig to study the operational effects of the conversion modes. Following the completion of ground-based testing, on 3 June 2005 the prototype resumed flight testing, focusing on the expansion of its flight envelope. On 22 July 2005, the first conversion from helicopter to aeroplane mode while in flight took place. By October 2008, 365 flight-hours had been logged by two prototype aircraft. The AW609 demonstrated a safe dual-engine failure in normal cruise flight on 15 May 2009. By February 2012, this had risen to 650 hours, and {{it was reported that}} 85 percent of the AW609's flight envelope had been explored. Test pilot Paul Edwards has stated that the AW609 was not susceptible to the vortex ring state phenomena, naturally <b>slipping</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the vortex on its own since both rotors will not simultaneously enter the vortex ring state.|$|E

25|$|Galla Placidia, as Augusta, {{mother of}} the Emperor, and his {{guardian}} until 437, could maintain a dominant position in court, but women in Ancient Rome did not exercise military power {{and she could not}} herself become a general. She tried for some years to avoid reliance on a single dominant military figure, maintaining a balance of power between her three senior officers, Aetius (magister militum in Gaul), Count Boniface governor in the Diocese of Africa, and Flavius Felix magister militum praesentalis in Italy. Meanwhile, the Empire deteriorated seriously. Apart from the losses in the Diocese of Africa, Hispania was <b>slipping</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> central control and into the hands of local rulers and Suevic bandits. In Gaul the Rhine frontier had collapsed, the Visigoths in Aquitaine may have launched further attacks on Narbo and Arelate, and the Franks, increasingly powerful although disunited, were the major power in the north-east. Aremorica was controlled by Bagaudae, local leaders not under the authority of the Empire. Aetius at least campaigned vigorously and mostly victoriously, defeating aggressive Visigoths, Franks, fresh Germanic invaders, Bagaudae in Aremorica, and a rebellion in Noricum. Not {{for the first time in}} Rome's history, a triumvirate of mutually distrustful rulers proved unstable. In 427 Felix tried to recall Boniface from Africa; he refused, and overcame Felix's invading force. Boniface probably recruited some Vandal troops among others.|$|E

500|$|Ian Inglis admires {{the song}} as [...] "one of Harrison's most {{haunting}} and mysterious compositions", and writes of the recording: [...] "The gentle, largely acoustic backing, and Harrison's achingly beautiful vocal give the song a nebulous, yearning quality, {{almost as if}} something barely understood is <b>slipping</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> sight." [...] Inglis likens [...] "Be Here Now" [...] to the performance monologue [...] "Time" [...] by English actress and author Joyce Grenfell, whose conclusion that [...] "there {{is no such thing}} as time – only this very minute, and I am in it" [...] he finds echoed in Harrison's [...] "sense of wonder and helplessness in the face of the spiritual, scientific, and metaphysical implications of time".|$|E

While at sea, she captured one British freighter, but did not sink her. In need of engine repairs and coal, Geier put into the neutral United States port at Honolulu, Hawaii, in October 1914, where she was eventually interned. After the American entrance into the war in April 1917, the US Navy seized Geier, commissioned her as USS Schurz, and placed her on convoy duty. She was ultimately sunk following a collision with a freighter off the coast of North Carolina, with one man killed and twelve injured.

500|$|In Rahul Dholakia's crime-drama film Raees (2017), Khan took on {{the part}} of the titular anti-heroa bootlegger turned mobster in 1980s Gujarat. In a typical mixed review, Pratim D. Gupta of The Telegraph thought Khan's {{performance}} to be [...] "inconsistent, intense and power-packed at times, but often <b>slipping</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> character into his usual mix of stock mannerisms". Commercially, the film was a modest success, earning over [...] worldwide. Khan returned to the romantic genre with the role of a tourist guide who falls in love with a traveller (played by Anushka Sharma) in Imtiaz Ali's Jab Harry Met Sejal (2017). Writing for Mint, Uday Bhatia criticised Khan's pairing with Sharma, 22 years his junior, writing that Khan had performed [...] "similar gestures of love decades ago to actors his own age". The film proved to be a box office flop. Khan will next reunite with Sharma and Katrina Kaif in Aanand L Rai's untitled project, in which he plays the part of a dwarf.|$|E

Taran Adarsh rated the film 3.5 out of 5, praised the cinematography, screenplay, dialogue, costumes and styling, and called Fashion a [...] "hard-hitting film that enlightens you, moves you, motivates and deflates you, even shocks and surprises you and of course, entertains you". Rajeev Masand gave the film a rating of 3 out of 5, and wrote, [...] "Fashion is an easy watch because the very subject lends itself to so much interest. Like the director’s own film Page 3 it is mostly sensational and on several occasions compromises authenticity {{for the sake of}} exaggerated drama". He praised the performances of the lead cast, writing that [...] "Chopra turns in a respectable performance, one that will inevitably go down as her best. The truth is, it’s one of those by-the-book characters that she understands only too well and performs just as easily. Ditto for Kangana Ranaut who plays the eccentric superdiva with such a practiced hand, it almost seems like an effortless delivery. It's...Godse who invests such sincerity into her role, that she makes the character a real flesh and blood person.
