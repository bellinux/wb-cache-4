25|$|Shear {{strength}} {{is a term}} used in soil mechanics to describe {{the magnitude of the}} shear stress that a soil can sustain. The shear resistance of soil is a result of friction and interlocking of particles, and possibly cementation or bonding at particle contacts. Due to interlocking, particulate material may expand or contract in volume as it is subject to shear strains. If soil expands its volume, the density of particles will decrease and the strength will decrease; in this case, the peak strength would be followed by a reduction of shear stress. The <b>stress-strain</b> <b>relationship</b> levels off when the material stops expanding or contracting, and when interparticle bonds are broken. The theoretical state at which the shear stress and density remain constant while the shear strain increases may be called the critical state, steady state, or residual strength.|$|E

50|$|Results {{obtained}} from the experiment exhibited a linear <b>stress-strain</b> <b>relationship</b> during elastic deformation but also an unexpected non-linear relationship between stress and strain for the lumber after the elastic limit was reached, deviating from the model of plasticity theory. Multiple reasons were suggested as to why this came about. First, since wood is a biological material, {{it was suggested that}} under great stress in the experiment, the crushing of cells within the sample could have been a cause for deviation from perfectly plastic behavior. With greater destruction of cellular material, the <b>stress-strain</b> <b>relationship</b> is hypothesized to become more and more nonlinear and non-ideal with greater stress. Additionally, because the samples were inhomogeneous (non-uniform) materials, it was assumed that some bending or distortion may have occurred in the samples that could have deviated the stress from being perfectly uniaxial. This may have also been induced by other factors like irregularities in the cellular density profile and distorted sample cutting.|$|E
50|$|The {{relationship}} between {{stress and strain}} can be simplified for specific stress rates. For high stress states/short time periods, the time derivative components of the <b>stress-strain</b> <b>relationship</b> dominate. A dashpot resists changes in length, and in a high stress state it can be approximated as a rigid rod. Since a rigid rod cannot be stretched past its original length, no strain {{is added to the}} system.|$|E

Based on analyses with validated finite-element models, this paper investigates local buckling of extruded sections with <b>stress-strain</b> <b>relationships</b> representative for fire-exposed aluminum alloys.

This paper presents a new design model for local buckling under fire conditions. The study concludes that the local buckling resistance decreases less fast than the plastic capacity at increasing temperature.

5000|$|For many materials, linear elastic models do not {{accurately}} describe the observed material behaviour. The most common {{example of this}} kind of material is rubber, whose <b>stress-strain</b> <b>relationship</b> can be defined as non-linearly elastic, isotropic, incompressible and generally independent of strain rate. Hyperelasticity provides a means of modeling the stress-strain behavior of such materials. [...] The behavior of unfilled, vulcanized elastomers often conforms closely to the hyperelastic ideal.

5000|$|The {{slope of}} this line {{is known as}} Young's modulus, or the [...] "modulus of {{elasticity}}." [...] The modulus of elasticity {{can be used to}} determine the <b>stress-strain</b> <b>relationship</b> in the linear-elastic portion of the stress-strain curve.

50|$|Even {{under the}} {{assumption}} of linear elastic behavior of the material, {{the relation between the}} stress and strain tensors is generally expressed by a fourth-order stiffness tensor with 21 independent coefficients (a symmetric 6 × 6 stiffness matrix). This complexity may be required for general anisotropic materials, but for many common materials it can be simplified. For orthotropic materials such as wood, whose stiffness is symmetric with respect to each of three orthogonal planes, nine coefficients suffice to express the <b>stress-strain</b> <b>relationship.</b> For isotropic materials, these coefficients reduce to only two.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} predict ground {{behavior}} subjected to cyclic loading {{such as that}} induced by earthquake, {{it is necessary to}} accurately evaluate the deformation characteristics of soils subjected to cyclic loading and develop a model which expresses these deformation characteristics appropriately. This paper provides a simple three-dimensional elasto-plastic model for sand subjected to large cyclic loading. It is an extension of the work on one-dimensional modeling of the cyclic loading <b>stress-strain</b> <b>relationships</b> of sand (De Silva 2008), in which a series of large amplitude cyclic torsional shear tests were implemented on specimens of sand. The concept of the model with infinite number of nesting surfaces (INS model) (Mrozet al. 1978) was employed to introduce the Masing's rule, which has been often used in the onedimensional modeling of the cyclic <b>stress-strain</b> <b>relationships,</b> into the three-dimensional modeling. In thezconcept of the INS model, the active loading and stress reversal surfaces are defined to express the cyclic deformation behavior. In the proposed model, the effects of cyclic hardening behavior which were observed in the torsional shear test results were taken into account by using the relationship between the accumulated deviator plastic strain. Moreover, the stress-dilatation relationship was defined by the relationship between the ratio of the plastic volumetric strain to the plastic deviator strain {{and the size of the}} active loading surface. The proposed model was applied to simulate <b>stress-strain</b> <b>relationships</b> of dense sand subjected to drained large cyclic loading...|$|R

5000|$|Many {{materials}} can display linear elastic behavior, {{defined by a}} linear <b>stress-strain</b> <b>relationship,</b> {{as shown in the}} left figure up to point 3. The elastic behavior of materials often extends into a non-linear region, represented in the figure by point 2 (the [...] "yield point"), up to which deformations are completely recoverable upon removal of the load; that is, a specimen loaded elastically in tension will elongate, but will return to its original shape and size when unloaded. Beyond this elastic region, for ductile materials, such as steel, deformations are plastic. A plastically deformed specimen does not completely return to its original size and shape when unloaded. For many applications, plastic deformation is unacceptable, and is used as the design limitation.|$|E
50|$|The Cauchy-Born rule or Cauchy-Born {{approximation}} {{is a basic}} hypothesis used in {{the mathematical}} formulation of solid mechanics which relates the movement of atoms in a crystal to the overall deformation of the bulk solid.

The currently accepted form is Max Born's refinement of Cauchy's original hypothesis which was used to derive the equations satisfied by the Cauchy stress tensor. The approximation generally holds for face-centered and body-centered cubic crystal systems. For complex lattices such as diamond, however, the rule has to be modified to allow for internal degrees of freedom between the sublattices. The approximation can then be used to obtain bulk properties of crystalline materials such as <b>stress-strain</b> <b>relationship.</b>|$|E
