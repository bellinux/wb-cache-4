If without recycling rationally, waste plastic bottles will pollute the environment, that is of no advantage for “the construction of resource saving and environment-friendly society”.

And finally it can produce various raw materials of textile garments by the <b>staple</b> <b>fiber.</b> The process of PET bottle flakes recycling mainly takes five steps: sorting, separation, cleaning, crushing and using.

5000|$|Staple {{nonwovens}} {{are made}} in 4 steps. Fibers are first spun, cut to a few centimeters length, and put into bales. The <b>staple</b> <b>fibers</b> are then blended, [...] "opened" [...] in a multistep process, dispersed on a conveyor belt, and spread in a uniform web by a wetlaid, airlaid, or carding/crosslapping process. Wetlaid operations typically use 0.25 to 0.75 in long fibers, but sometimes longer if the fiber is stiff or thick. Airlaid processing generally uses 0.5 to 4.0 in fibers. Carding operations typically use ~1.5" [...] long fibers. Rayon {{used to be a}} common fiber in nonwovens, now greatly replaced by polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene. Fiberglass is wetlaid into mats for use in roofing and shingles. Synthetic fiber blends are wetlaid along with cellulose for single-use fabrics.

Randomly distributed fiber reinforced soils have recently attracted increasing attention in geotechnical engineering. At many sites, {{availability of the}} land is a huge problem; in such situations construction of steep slope fly ash embankments is worth considering. The polypropylene <b>staple</b> <b>fiber</b> of 1 % by dry weight was used with fly ash for the experimental work. Proctor compaction test, direct shear test, and unconfined compression test have been performed without and with polypropylene <b>staple</b> <b>fiber.</b> Centrifuge tests have been performed at 80 % compaction effort to observe the effect of fiber reinforcement taking two different slope angles (θ = 78. 6 °). Experimental results show that due to mixing of fiber in fly ash, maximum dry density decreases and optimum amount of water content increases. Fiber reinforcement increases the shear strength of fly ash and changes its brittle behaviour into ductile behaviour. In case of reinforced slope there is a reduction in the vertical settlement and it fails at higher values of ‘g’, which means that polypropylene <b>staple</b> <b>fiber</b> reinforced slopes can sustain higher loads. © IACMA...|$|R
