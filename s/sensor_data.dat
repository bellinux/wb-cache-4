25|$|Conventional {{temporal}} probabilistic models such as {{the hidden}} Markov model (HMM) and conditional random fields (CRF) model directly model {{the correlations between the}} activities and the observed <b>sensor</b> <b>data.</b> In recent years, increasing evidence has supported the use of hierarchical models which take into account the rich hierarchical structure that exists in human behavioral data. The core idea here is that the model does not directly correlate the activities with the <b>sensor</b> <b>data,</b> but instead breaks the activity into sub-activities (sometimes referred to as actions) and models the underlying correlations accordingly. An example could be the activity of preparing spaghetti, which can be broken down into the subactivities or actions of cutting vegetables, frying the vegetables in a pan and serving it on a plate. Examples of such a hierarchical model are Layered Hidden Markov Models (LHMMs) and the hierarchical hidden Markov model (HHMM), which have been shown to significantly outperform its non-hierarchical counterpart in activity recognition.|$|E

25|$|RFID tags contain {{at least}} three parts: an {{integrated}} circuit for storing and processing information that modulates and demodulates a radio-frequency (RF) signals; a means of collecting DC power from the incident reader signal; and an antenna for receiving and transmitting the signal.

25|$|The {{main purpose}} of using AVL {{is not only to}} locate the vehicles, but also to obtain {{information}} about engine data, fuel consumption, driver data and <b>sensor</b> <b>data</b> from i.e. doors, freezer room on trucks or air pressure.

Because most AVL consists of two parts, GPS and GSM modem with additional embedded AVL software contained in a microcontroller, most AVL systems are fixed for its purposes unless they connect to an open bus system for expansion possibilities.|$|E
25|$|The P-8 {{features}} the Raytheon APY-10 multi-mission surface search radar; the P-8I features an international {{version of the}} APY-10. Unlike the preceding P-3, the P-8 lacks a magnetic anomaly detector (MAD) due to its higher operational altitude; its acoustic sensor system is reportedly more effective at acoustic tracking and thus lacking a MAD won't impede its detection capabilities; India's P-8I {{is equipped with a}} MAD per the contract request. Various <b>sensor</b> <b>data</b> are combined via data fusion software to track targets. Following the cancellation of Lockheed Martin's Aerial Common Sensor project, Boeing proposed a signals intelligence variant of the P-8 for the Navy's requirement.
