In order to accomplish the {{expression of}} multiple genes in a <b>single</b> <b>transformation</b> <b>event,</b> we inserted {{both large and small}} subunits of allophycocyanin gene (apcA and apcB) into Chlamydomonas reinhardtii chloroplast expression vector, resulting in papc-S. The constructed vector was then introduced into the chloroplast of C. reinhardtii by micro-particle bombardment. Polymerase chain reaction and Southern blot analysis revealed that the two genes had integrated into the chloroplast genome. Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that the two genes from the prokaryotic cyanobacteria could be correctly expressed in the chloroplasts of C. reinhardtii. The expressed foreign protein in transformants accounted for about 2 %– 3 % of total soluble proteins.

To this purpose, Nicotiana benthamiana transgenic plants that simultaneously produce dsRNA originating from a conserved region of the BNYVV replicase gene and the HrpZ(Psph) protein in a secreted form (SP/HrpZ(Psph)) were produced. The integration and expression of both transgenes as well as proper production of the harpin protein were verified in all primary transformants and selfed progeny (T 1, T 2). Transgenic resistance was assessed by BNYVV-challenge inoculation on T 2 progeny by scoring disease symptoms and DAS-ELISA at 20 and 30 dpi. Transgenic lines possessing <b>single</b> <b>transformation</b> <b>events</b> for both transgenes as well as wild type plants were included in inoculation experiments. Transgenic plants were highly resistant to virus infection, whereas in some cases immunity was achieved.

Collectively, our findings demonstrate, for a first time, that the combination of two entirely different resistance mechanisms provide high level resistance or even immunity against the virus.

Homozygous doubled haploid (DH) (diploid) plants were generated, and selfed progeny from these plants were examined. Resistance was virus specific, functioning only against PVY. An inverse correlation between transgene-derived PVY transcript steady state levels and resistance was generally noted with lines expressing the untranslatable sense version of the PVY CP ORF.

Since the multiple genes of roots {{are found to}} have spatial and temporal differences in their expression and function, {{the search for the}} trait differences, genes and their function need to be expanded with large set of mutant resources (Wei et al. [2013] for a review). This includes the development of large saturation mutagenized populations, virtually exploring any amino acid variation along the encoded proteins. New gene targeting technologies, mainly TALEN and CRISPR are revolutionizing functional analysis of genes and should be critical to accelerate the characterization of genes of agronomic interest (Gaj et al. [2013]; Miao et al. [2013]). The establishment of an International repository containing CRISPR directed against all rice genes to generate knock-out mutants would be a helpful resource for speeding up gene discovery and validation. Another possibility would be to produce CRISPR in pairs targeting 5 ’ and 3 ’ end of each rice gene. This resource would be useful for allele replacement in any rice gene and to validate any QTL effect by introducing only the causative mutation in other genetic backgrounds. Finally, the CRISPR technology allows targeting multiple genes at once in a <b>single</b> <b>transformation</b> <b>event</b> and so opens a simple way to test QTL/gene interactions.|$|E

40|$|Transgene {{integration}} into plant genomes {{is a complex}} process accompanied by molecular rearrangements. Classic methods that are normally used to study transgenic population genetics are generally inadequate for assessing such integration. Two major characteristics of transgenic populations are that a transgenic genome may harbor many copies of the transgene and that molecular rearrangements can create an unstable transgenic locus. In this work, we examined the segregation of T 1, T 2 and T 3 transgenic tobacco progenies. Since transfer DNA (T-DNA) contains the NptII selectable marker gene that confers resistance to kanamycin, we used this characteristic in developing a method to estimate the number of functional inserts integrated into the genome. This approach was based on calculation of the theoretical segregation ratios in successive generations. Mendelian ratios of 3 : 1, 15 : 1 and 63 : 1 were confirmed for five <b>transformation</b> <b>events</b> whereas six <b>transformation</b> <b>events</b> yielded non-segregating progenies, a finding that raised questions about causal factors. A second approach based on a maximum likelihood method was performed to estimate recombination frequencies between linked inserts.

The relatively low throughput of soybean transformation necessitates {{the use of}} a transposon-tagging strategy where a <b>single</b> <b>transformation</b> <b>event</b> will produce many mutations over a number of generations. However, existing transposon-tagging tools being used in legumes are of limited utility because of restricted transposition (Ac/Ds: soybean) or the requirement for tissue culture activation (Tnt 1 : Medicago truncatula). A recently discovered transposable element from rice (Oryza sativa), mPing, and the genes required for its mobilization, were transferred to soybean to determine if it will be an improvement over the other available transposon-tagging tools. Stable transformation events in soybean were tested for mPing transposition. Analysis of mPing excision at early and late embryo developmental stages revealed increased excision during late development in most transgenic lines, suggesting that transposition is developmentally regulated. Transgenic lines that produced heritable mPing insertions were identified, with the plants from the highest activity line producing at least one new insertion per generation. Analysis of the mPing insertion sites in the soybean genome revealed that features displayed in rice were retained including transposition to unlinked sites and a preference for insertion within 2. 5 kb of a gene. Taken together these findings indicate that mPing has the characteristics necessary for an effective transposon-tagging resource...|$|E
40|$|Trehalose is a nonreducing {{disaccharide}} of glucose that {{functions as}} a compatible solute in the stabilization of biological structures under abiotic stress in bacteria, fungi, and invertebrates. With the notable exception of the desiccation-tolerant “resurrection plants,” trehalose is not thought to accumulate to detectable levels in most plants. We report here the regulated overexpression of Escherichia coli trehalose biosynthetic genes (otsA and otsB) as a fusion gene for manipulating abiotic stress tolerance in rice. The fusion gene has the advantages of necessitating only a <b>single</b> <b>transformation</b> <b>event</b> and a higher net catalytic efficiency for trehalose formation. The expression of the transgene was {{under the control of}} either tissue-specific or stress-dependent promoters. Compared with nontransgenic rice, several independent transgenic lines exhibited sustained plant growth, less photo-oxidative damage, and more favorable mineral balance under salt, drought, and low-temperature stress conditions. Depending on growth conditions, the transgenic rice plants accumulate trehalose at levels 3 – 10 times that of the nontransgenic controls. The observation that peak trehalose levels remain well below 1 mg/g fresh weight indicates that the primary effect of trehalose is not as a compatible solute. Rather, increased trehalose accumulation correlates with higher soluble carbohydrate levels and an elevated capacity for photosynthesis under both stress and nonstress conditions, consistent with a suggested role in modulating sugar sensing and carbohydrate metabolism. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of engineering rice for increased tolerance of abiotic stress and enhanced productivity through tissue-specific or stress-dependent overproduction of trehalose...|$|E

This linkage suggested to us that selection for β-lactam resistance might coselect for capsular transformants. The recombination event would then involve PBP genes, {{as well as the}} cps operon, and would change both the serotype and the resistance profile of the strain. We transformed β-lactam-susceptible strain TIGR 4 by using whole genomic DNA extracted from multidrug-resistant strain GA 71, a serotype 19 F variant of pneumococcal clone Spain 23 F- 1, and selected β-lactam-resistant transformants. Smooth colonies appearing on selective plates were subcultured, serotyped by the Quellung reaction, and genotyped to confirm the presence of the GA 71 pbp 2 x-cps 19 -pbp 1 a locus in the TIGR 4 genetic background by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the whole locus and its flanking regions.

That the merAB operon was stably integrated into the chloroplast genome was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction and Southern-blot analyses. Northern-blot analyses revealed stable transcripts that were independent of the presence or absence of a 3 ′-untranslated region downstream of the coding sequence. The merAB dicistron was the more abundant transcript, but less abundant monocistrons were also observed, showing that specific processing occurs between transgenes. The use of chloroplast transformation to enhance Hg phytoremediation is particularly beneficial because it prevents the escape of transgenes via pollen to related weeds or crops and there is no need for codon optimization to improve transgene expression.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae has an extensive repertoire of molecular methods for the genetic analysis of laboratory strains. Although this has widely {{contributed to the}} interpretation of gene functionality within haploid genomes, the genetic basis of desirable metabolic pathways in industrial diploid and polyploid yeast strain is still poorly understood. The genetic engineering of industrial yeasts is currently undergoing major changes due {{to the development of}} a marker-free, high-throughput, and multiplexed genome editing approach inspired to the bacterial immune systems: the “Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) immune system”. CRISPR/Cas 9 allows the knockout or the tuning of expression of specific targeted genes and pathways. The system requires an endonuclease (Cas 9) that is guided to a specific DNA sequence by a guide RNA (gRNA). The assembling of a ribonucleoprotein complex (Cas 9 /gRNA) can produce cuts in specific sites of eukaryotic genomes and generates different combinations of gene deletions through a <b>single</b> <b>transformation</b> <b>event.</b> CRISPR/Cas 9 is gaining significant attention because of its biotechnological applications and its potential to boost innovation.

The IEs placing in the N 6 O medium for 7 days were then co-cultivated with A. tumefaciens suspension within 30 mins and then incubated {{in the dark for}} 1 day. In <b>single</b> <b>transformation,</b> GUS assay revealed that about 64 % transient transformation frequency was obtained for IEs two weeks after co-cultivation, GFP activity was recorded as 41. 67 % transformation frequency for IEs 4 days after co-cultivation. In co-transformation, the transformation frequency was lower than <b>single</b> <b>transformation</b> and there was no GFP activity recorded in co-transformation...|$|R
40|$|Here it is {{demonstrated}} that the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae can take up and assemble at least 38 overlapping single-stranded oligonucleotides and a linear double-stranded vector in one <b>transformation</b> <b>event.</b> These oligonucleotides can overlap by as few as 20 bp, and can be as long as 200 nucleotides in length. This straightforward scheme for assembling chemically-synthesized oligonucleotides could be {{a useful tool for}} building synthetic DNA molecules...|$|R
40|$|In model transformations, rules handle mapping between source {{metamodel}} {{elements and}} target metamodel elements. There are {{cases in which}} more complex structures in the source have to be selected. In some transformation languages, these complex source patterns require decomposition of trans-formation specifications into multiple rules. This decomposition negatively affects qualities of transformation specifications such as modifiability and consistency. The handling of a complex source pattern by a <b>single</b> <b>transformation</b> rule requires composition at finer granularity, i. e., operation composition. In this paper, we show how operation composition improves the quality of transformation specifications for complex source patterns. As an illustration, we implemented a complex source pattern transformation for agent systems in two well-known model transformation languages, ATL and Tefkat. ATL supports com-position at rule level, and Tefkat supports composition at operation level. We describe the requirements for transformation languages {{in order to support}} the handling of complex source patterns in <b>single</b> <b>transformation</b> rules. We discuss some transformation mechanisms that provide operation composition...|$|R

The initial event in this process {{is thought to be}} the <b>transformation</b> f a <b>single</b> cell by a single virus particle. This <b>transformation</b> <b>event</b> can be observed in vitro by use of a number of selective assays (Todaro et al. 1964; Macpherson and Mon...|$|R
