5|$|Body {{impressions}} of Early Carboniferous temnospondyls from Pennsylvania <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> terrestrial temnospondyls mated on land like some modern amphibians.

The head of one individual rests under the tail of another {{in what may be}} a courtship display. Internal fertilization and similar courtship behavior are seen in modern salamanders.|$|E
5|$|By 1300, Southampton was a {{major port}} and a large provincial town, with a {{population}} of around 5,000. The raising of money through murage grants began again in 1321, possibly paying for the stone towers of the Bargate and some of the semi-circular wall towers. Work also appears to have begun on some stone walling to the south and west of the town, construction may have begun at the South Gate and a wooden barbican was constructed near the western docks. Later investigations by the Crown would <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> of the monies raised in these murage grants had been misspent, however, contributing to the poor standard of town defences, which included large gaps in the walled circuit.|$|E
5|$|Concealed shoes {{hidden in}} the fabric of a {{building}} have been discovered in many European countries, as well as {{in other parts of the}} world, since at least the early modern period. Independent researcher Brian Hoggard has observed that the locations in which these shoes are typically found– in chimneys, under floors, above ceilings, around doors and windows, in the roof– <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> may have been concealed as magical charms to protect the occupants of the building against evil influences such as demons, ghosts and witches. Others may have been intended to bestow fertility on a female member of the household, or been an offering to a household deity.|$|E

5|$|As the WSPU gained {{recognition}} and notoriety for its actions, Pankhurst resisted efforts to democratise the organisation itself. In 1907 {{a small group}} of members led by Teresa Billington-Greig called for more involvement from the rank-and-file suffragettes at the union's annual meetings. In response, Pankhurst announced at a WSPU meeting that elements of the organisation's constitution relating to decision-making were void and cancelled the annual meetings. She also insisted that a small committee chosen by the members in attendance be allowed to co-ordinate WSPU activities. Pankhurst and her daughter Christabel were chosen (along with Mabel Tuke and Emmeline Pethick Lawrence) as members of the new committee. Frustrated, several members including Billington-Greig and Charlotte Despard quit to form their own organisation, the Women's Freedom League. In her 1914 autobiography Pankhurst dismissed criticism of the WSPU's leadership structure:if at any time a member, or a group of members, loses faith in our policy; if any one begins to <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> other policy ought to be substituted, or if she tries to confuse the issue by adding other policies, she ceases at once to be a member. Autocratic? Quite so. But, you may object, a suffrage organisation ought to be democratic. Well the members of the W. S. P. U. do not agree with you. We do not believe in the effectiveness of the ordinary suffrage organisation. The W. S. P. U. is not hampered by a complexity of rules. We have no constitution and by-laws; nothing to be amended or tinkered with or quarrelled over at an annual meeting... The W. S. P. U. is simply a suffrage army in the field.|$|E

25|$|While no {{southern}} state abolished slavery, {{for a period}} individual owners could free their slaves by personal decision, often providing for manumission in wills but sometimes filing deeds or court papers to free individuals. Numerous slaveholders who freed their slaves cited revolutionary ideals in their documents; others freed slaves {{as a reward for}} service. Records also <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> slaveholders were freeing their own mixed-race children, born into slavery to slave mothers.|$|E
25|$|Historical records also <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> saints who {{developed}} anorexia (as {{a result of}} a life of asceticism) may also have displayed bulimic behaviors. Saint Mary Magdalen de Pazzi (1566–1607) and Saint Veronica Giuliani (1660–1727) were both observed binge eating—giving in, as they believed, to the temptations of the devil. Saint Catherine of Siena (1347–1380) is known to have supplemented her strict abstinence from food by purging as reparation for her sins. Catherine died from starvation at age thirty-three.|$|E

However, a CT scan of Grauballe Man by Danish scientists determined his skull was fractured due to pressure from the bog long after his death.|$|E
25|$|Around 80 BC, an Indo-Scythian king named Maues, {{possibly}} a {{general in the}} service of the Indo-Greeks, ruled for a few years in northwestern India before the Indo-Greeks again took control. He seems to have been married to an Indo-Greek princess named Machene. King Hippostratus (65–55 BC) seems to have been one of the most successful subsequent Indo-Greek kings until he lost to the Indo-Scythian Azes I, who established an Indo-Scythian dynasty in 48/47 BC. Various coins seem to <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> sort of alliance may have taken place between the Indo-Greeks and the Scythians.|$|E
25|$|Hybodonts have a {{wide variety}} of tooth shapes. This variety {{suggests}} that they took advantage of multiple food sources. It is thought that some hybodonts which had wider, flatter, teeth specialized in crushing hard-shelled prey. Well-developed wear facets on teeth from Lissodus <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> hybodontiforms crushed their food. Species described from Thailand have a range of teeth shapes, suggesting multiple feeding habits. Bulbous teeth were used for crushing hard shelled bottom-dwelling prey. Others were opportunistic feeders and were species that had a diet of large soft-bodied prey.|$|E
