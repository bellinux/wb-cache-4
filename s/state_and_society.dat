5|$|Politics in Belgium under Leopold I were {{polarized}} between {{liberal and}} Catholic political factions, though before 1847 they collaborated in unionist governments. The liberals {{were opposed to}} the church and particularly opposed its influence in politics and society, while supporting free trade, personal liberties and secularization. The Catholics saw religious teachings as a fundamental basis for the <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>society</b> and opposed all attempts by the liberals to attack the church's official privileges. Initially, these factions existed only as informal groups with which prominent politicians were generally identified. The liberals held power over much of Leopold I's reign. An official Liberal Party was formed in 1846, although a formal Catholic Party was only established in 1869. Gradually, these political groups would also spread into Belgium's society, creating a process of social stratification known as pillarisation. Leopold, who was Protestant, tended to favor Liberals and shared their desire for reform, though he was not partisan.|$|E

25|$|The cult of {{personality}} intensified around Hoxha, who became increasingly paranoid about foreign intrigue and conspiracy. Hoxha tolerated no dissent {{and thousands of}} Albanians were executed, sent to state labor camps or exiled to remote areas for work. After a purge {{in the military and}} the economic bureaucracy, in 1976, Albania implemented a rigidly Marxist-Leninist constitution that not only made the party the leading force in <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>society,</b> but also limited private property and forbade foreign loans. Isolating itself completely {{from the rest of the}} world, Albania embarked on a massive defense program, including the amassing of a huge arsenal of weapons and the construction of more than 700,000 concrete military bunkers for a country with only 3 million citizens.|$|E
25|$|A central axiom of Marxism is {{that the}} liberation {{of the working class}} must come {{at the hands of the}} working class itself. That this premise has been {{advanced}} by an unending string of middle-class intellectuals ranging from the professor-without-portfolio Dr. Karl Marx to the college-educated lawyer V. I. Lenin to lawyer and university lecturer Daniel DeLeon may be characterized as either inevitable, ironic, or a major contradiction, depending on one's personal perspective. Be that as it may, Marxists have universally assumed that only conscious and concerted effort by the working class itself can lead to cause the revolutionary transformation of economy and society. The devil lies in the details—how best to motivate this state of understanding and drive to action among those who sell their labor-power to others, how best to achieve the transformation of <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>society.</b>|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. A. (Political Studies)) [...] North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2011 This thesis {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} the <b>state</b> <b>and</b> civil <b>society</b> in Zimbabwe. The relationship between the <b>state</b> <b>and</b> civil <b>society</b> is discussed under the categories of the concepts democratisation, good governance and sustainable development. The nature of {{the relationship between the}} <b>state</b> <b>and</b> civil <b>society</b> in Africa is examined to set out parameters for state-civil society debate in Zimbabwe. The discussion {{of the relationship between the}} <b>state</b> <b>and</b> civil <b>society</b> in Zimbabwe is synthesised into three parts, the post-independence era, the post- 1990 s and the post- 2000. From these discussions it is argued that the relationship between the <b>state</b> <b>and</b> civil <b>society</b> was peaceful in the first decade of independence and this was because the <b>state</b> maintained dominance <b>and</b> control over all sectors of civil society. However, the 1990 s saw a collapse of peaceful relations between the <b>state</b> <b>and</b> civil <b>society</b> in Zimbabwe. The collapse of the peaceful relationship between the <b>state</b> <b>and</b> civil <b>society</b> came as a result of the country’s economic decline and the authoritarian practices in Zimbabwe, which saw the emergence of a confrontational civil society towards the state. In the early 2000 s, it is observed that the state became repressive towards civil society through the introduction of repressive laws which include Access to Information and Privacy Act (AIIPA) and the Public Order and Security Act (POSA). For peaceful relations between the <b>state</b> <b>and</b> civil <b>society</b> to exist in a sustainable manner, the state must continuously promote and practice democracy and good governance. In addition, the state should play a pivotal role of enhancing sustainable development in a manner that meets the socio-economic realities of its population. Master...|$|R

25|$|Migdal expands {{his theory}} of state-society {{relations}} by examining Sierra Leone. At the time of Migdal’s publication (1988), the country’s leader, President Joseph Saidu Momoh, was widely viewed as weak and ineffective. Just three years later, the country erupted into civil war, which continued for nearly 11 years. The basis for this tumultuous time, in Migdal’s estimation, was the fragmented social control implemented by British colonizers. Using the typical British system of indirect rule, colonizers empowered local chiefs to mediate British rule in the region, and in turn, the chiefs exercised social control. After achieving independence from Great Britain, the chiefs remained deeply entrenched and did not allow for the necessary consolidation of power needed to build a strong state. Migdal remarked, “Even with all the resources at their disposal, even {{with the ability to}} eliminate any single strongman, state leaders found themselves severely limited.” It is necessary for the <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>society</b> to form a mutually beneficially symbiotic relationship in order for each to thrive. The peculiar nature of postcolonial politics makes this increasingly difficult.|$|E
25|$|From the outset, {{the museum}} {{authorities}} charged the collections {{with a federal}} mission, wanting them to exert a “beneficial and salutary influence on the entire Fatherland”. The “unofficial national gallery” grew over time, primarily through acquisitions of Swiss works of art. When negotiations got underway in 1883 regarding {{the establishment of a}} federal museum, the canton of Basel-City sought to be chosen as the location for the new institution and proposed its collections of cultural history as the nucleus of the museum, systematically expanding them in light of its candidacy. While the Swiss National Museum (Schweizerisches Landesmuseum) ended up in Zurich, plans were nevertheless realized for a history museum that was no longer generally Swiss but specifically related to Basel, located in the historic former Barfüsser Church from the High Gothic period. The establishment of the Historical Museum “was a self-assured display of Basel’s art-mindedness and craftsmanship, a mix of educational corridor and enfilade of stalls”. The transfer of the Museum of Applied Arts (Gewerbemuseum) to the state a few years earlier as an arena of contemporary achievements can likewise be seen under the aspect of civic pride and reinvented sense of commonality in which the citizenry understood its ideals and capabilities as a foundation of <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>society.</b>|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} critical discourse analysis of <b>state</b> <b>and</b> civil <b>society</b> organisations’ efforts {{to implement the}} gender mainstreaming goals {{set out in the}} United Nations’ Beijing Declaration. It is argued that the latter represents a generational opportunity to apply a Feminist Political Economic Framework to development in Africa. However, the research findings show how current practice falls short of the sought-after participative democratic model of mainstreaming. Instead, analysis reveals significant differences in <b>state</b> <b>and</b> civil <b>society</b> organisations’ policy framing, issues over conceptual clarity and a disjuncture in <b>state</b> <b>and</b> civil <b>society</b> prioritisation of key gendered issues such as poverty, economic inequality and conflict resolution. This matters because it indicates that the capacity of the civil sphere to act as a political arena from which NGOs may challenge the traditionally male-dominated power structures is being undermined by a ‘disconnect’ between <b>state</b> <b>and</b> civil <b>society</b> as they pursue contrasting agendas...|$|R
