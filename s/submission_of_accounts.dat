40|$|Woman {{created in}} the image of God, Part 1 : a {{historical}} investigation - from Genesis to the Middle Ages. This study indicates that the traditions in the Pentateuch, especially the creation traditions, implied the egalitarian status of man and woman as image of God. The context of this traditions, however, was patriarchal and thus opened the possibility of the exploitation of women. Though Genesis 1 : 27 does not specifically attest to the asymmetry between man and woman in patriarchal society, the fate of women in general was bound up with the presentation of God as a male creator. The implications of this presentation can be clearly seen in texts of the intertestamental period. The study points out the degree to which Philo's view of a hierarchy concerning man and woman as immanent to God's order of creation, strongly influenced Christian thought on the place of women. Since the "fall of woman" necessitates a "soteriology", women in general are portrayed negatively in patristic texts. Mary is seen as the positive counterpart of Eve. The image of women then becomes that <b>of</b> <b>submission</b> on <b>account</b> <b>of</b> their alienation from God. The article concludes with the view of Thomas Aquinas that the subservience of slaves is less than that of women, because in their case it is not an order of creation...|$|R

First, commonly used Internet technologies (e. g., e-mail, Web, FTP, listserr, and ZRC) and traditional technolo- gies (e. g., mail, teleploone, and fax) are su. cient for delivering a rather technical and bands-on distance course. Second, among tloese technologies, fax was t 19 e favorite method for submitting assignments, and e-mail was the most used metlood for communications and dialogues. Third, communication related to the <b>submission</b> <b>of</b> assignments <b>accounted</b> for an outstanding proportion of all e-mail messages. And fourth, minimal control of technology use helped the instructor and tloe students focus on the subject matters, and students achieved bigb learning performance and satisfaction. Implications for distance education are discussed. (KeyworSts: distance learnin, g, information systems analysis and design,]'nternet technologies.) Distance education is a process that. creates and provides access to learning when time and distance separate the source of informatioa and the learners. Technology-assisted distance education (Eddy; Burnett, $pautding, St. Murphy, 1997) has become increasingly common in recent years, owing to the extremely rapid expansion of distance-education technologies. These. technologies have been evolving from traditional technologies such as mail, telephone, and fax, to instruc- tional television (Wheeler, Batchglder, &: Hampshire, 1997), to VCR-based tech- nology, and computer systems such as the Internet. With the increasing availability of the Internet to most potential distance students, Internet-based distance courses are booming. Although there are many [...] ...|$|R
