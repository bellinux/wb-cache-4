40|$|In a study {{investigating}} {{the effects of}} student engagement in inquiry learning {{through the development of}} Web sites, nearly every student reported having enjoyed the project, and the majority <b>scored</b> <b>an</b> <b>A</b> or B for their project grade. However, neither enjoyment nor high achievement on this performance task necessarily translated into high scores on the unit test. Therefore, this paper explores why success in a technology rich inquiry environment did not translate to measurable changes in student learning. Results demonstrated that students were not accustomed to this type of pedagogy and that the assessment did not match the task...|$|E
30|$|Another student {{successfully}} {{passed her}} first semester midterm. Every week the PT “noticed improvements in her mathematical ability, thinking, {{and her own}} confidence. She became less focused on memorizing math formulas and started to understand the underlying concepts that make up Geometry” (Paige’s Reflective Essay, 2011). The PTs were very excited to witness improvement in their students’ mathematical knowledge and confidence solving mathematics problems. The students began asking for more challenging problems to work on and answering more and more questions. One student showed her tutor her triangle test, which she <b>scored</b> <b>an</b> <b>A.</b> Leslie identified that the student she worked with had learned helplessness, and she found herself constantly reassuring the student that she could do the work even after her student repeatedly {{said she did not}} know. Leslie kept trying to help her realize she could do the mathematics. After a few sessions the student did “realize[d] she can do the harder stuff in math” (Leslie’s Reflective Essay, 2012). Destiny spoke to her student’s teacher, who reported that since working with her, the student’s confidence level significantly increased which correlated with a 10 % increase in the student’s overall grade. The PTs were extremely proud of their students. “I don’t know, they were just like, ‘my kids.’ I came back each week to see them and they had improved so much. I don’t know, I don’t know how to describe it. It’s like a wonderful feeling” (Destiny’s Interview, 2012).|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Each year, {{a cohort}} in the Northern Cape undergo colonoscopies {{as part of}} a {{surveillance}} program for individuals who have a C 1528 T mutation in the hMLH 1 gene that puts them at very high risk for the development of colon cancer (Lynch syndrome). A clean colon is essential as it allows a thorough evaluation and surveillance for small polyps or mucosal lesions mostly encountered in the ascending colon. This study evaluated both the subject acceptance and the effectiveness of a 2 L PEG electrolyte lavage solution containing ascorbic acid and sodium ascorbate (Moviprep®) as a preparation solution. Methods: The screening program was divided into two stages. Stage 1, 71 subjects were counselled individually on the importance of bowel cleansing and the use of Moviprep® as their bowel cleansing agent. Preparation was either a) 2 L the night prior to colonoscopy or b) 1 L the night prior to and the second litre {{on the morning of the}} colonoscopy. Subjects were encouraged to drink at least 500 ml clear fluid in addition to each litre of Moviprep®. Informed consent was obtained for participation in the study. Stage 2, approximately 6 weeks later, each subject completed a questionnaire, evaluating their experience with Moviprep® and also had their screening colonoscopy performed. Colonoscopies were performed at 4 medical facilities in the Northern Cape. All subjects were assessed for bowel cleanliness on arrival at the facility where colonoscopy was to be performed. If any of the subjects were found to be inadequately cleaned, extra oral preparation was given prior to colonoscopy. The Harefield cleansing scale was used to evaluate the quality of colonic cleansing during each colonoscopy. The colon was divided into 6 segments (rectum, sigmoid, descending-, transverse-, ascending colon and cecum). Preparation was scored as A = all colon segments clean; B = at least 1 segment with residual amounts of brown liquid or semisolid stool, which can easily be displaced or removed; C = at least 1 segment with only partially removable stool, preventing complete visualization; D = at least 1 segment which could not be examined due to solid stool). Grades A or B were considered successful cleansing and grades C or D were considered a failed colonic preparation. Results: A total of 46 subjects had colonoscopies performed. 41 (89 %) of them had successful and 5 (11 %) failed preparation. Three of those subjects that prepared successfully had previously undergone right hemicolectomies, leaving 38 with intact colons. 22 / 38 (58 %) subjects achieved an A grade for caecal cleansing and 16 / 38 (42 %) a B grading. 2438 (63 %) subjects <b>scored</b> <b>an</b> <b>A</b> grade for the ascending colon and 14 / 38 (37 %) a B grade. A total of 64 subjects completed the questionnaires of which 83 % (53 / 64) had used other colon preparations previously. When asked if they would use Moviprep® again in the future, 89 % (57 / 64) said yes and 11 % (7 / 64) said no. 94 % of subjects (60 / 64) would recommend Moviprep® to friend and family. Conclusion: Moviprep® provided adequate colonic cleansing in 89 % of subjects. In addition, nearly 90 % of subjects were satisfied with the product and would use it again...|$|E
