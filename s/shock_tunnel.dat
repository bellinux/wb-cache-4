40|$|One of {{the main}} aspects of space {{transportation}} is the aerodynamic of space vehicles. For the investigation of flow problematic and the interrelated transport phenomenas in hypersonic flows, the development of suitable tools is required. Here, development and verification of such tools is represented. On the experimental side a probe for the measurement of the static pressure inside hypersonic wind tunnels is described, on the numerical side the modification of a two dimensional axissymmetric navier stokes solver for the simulation of multispecies flow. The influence of the driver gas to the flow inside <b>shock</b> <b>tunnels</b> is investigated. Through it one basic problem of <b>shock</b> <b>tunnels</b> is detected. Due to the working principal, test and driver gases will be mixed up. Hence the contamination of the test gas yields to inadvertent flow phenomenas.

40|$|Fluorescence imaging {{techniques}} can accurately monitor {{a variety of}} gas-phase parameters including species concentrations, temperature and velocity. However, in using such techniques in free-piston <b>shock</b> <b>tunnels,</b> {{a number of problems}} are encountered. For example, emission from metallic impurities present in the flow imposes a severe limitation, especially at the very high specific flow enthalpies. In spite of this and other di#culties encountered, it has been possible to successfully apply such methods to many important flow studies in free-piston <b>shock</b> <b>tunnels,</b> some of which are described in this paper...|$|R

In both cases the gases are compressed and heated until the gases are released, expanding rapidly down the expansion chamber. The tunnels reach speeds from Mach 3 to Mach 30 to create testing conditions that simulate hypersonic to re-entry flight. These tunnels are used by military and government agencies to test hypersonic vehicles that undergo a variety of natural phenomenon that occur during hypersonic flight.|$|R

50|$|NASA's Hypersonic Pulse Facility (HYPULSE) is {{operated}} by the General Applied Science Laboratory (GASL) in New York. The HYPULSE facility was developed for the testing of re-entry vehicles and air-breathing engines. The specifications of the HYPULSE include a diameter of 7 feet and a 19 foot length. This facility was upgraded to have two modes, Reflected <b>Shock</b> <b>Tunnel</b> (RST) and Shock-Expansion Tunnel (SET). HYPULSE-RST generates speeds from Mach 5 to 10, whereas the HYPULSE-SET produces speeds from Mach 12 to 25.|$|E
50|$|The {{hypersonic}} <b>shock</b> <b>tunnel</b> {{is another}} impulse facility with a run time of 0.5 to 5.0 ms. The tunnel has a test section of 0.44 meters (diameter) by {{a length of}} 1 meter. The inviscid core is 0.17 m at Mach 8. It is capable of testing at Mach numbers from 5 to 16 and Reynolds numbers from 100 to 20 million per meter. The tunnel can be modified to accommodate a detonation driver using a mixture of hydrogen, oxygen and helium. This was completed in 1991, {{and led to a}} $1,000,000 grant to form the NASA/UTA Center for Hypersonic Research between 1993 and 1998.|$|E
50|$|They {{have been}} further {{developed}} into <b>shock</b> <b>tunnels,</b> with an added nozzle and dump tank. The resultant high temperature hypersonic flow {{can be used}} to simulate atmospheric re-entry of spacecraft or hypersonic craft, again with limited testing times.|$|R
40|$|The two {{enthalpy}} <b>shock</b> <b>tunnels</b> in Aachen and Goettingen, both Germany, are described. Both {{of these}} are <b>shock</b> <b>tunnels</b> operating in the reflected mode.

40|$|Available {{test time}} is an {{important}} issue for ground-based flow research, particularly for impulse facilities such as <b>shock</b> <b>tunnels,</b> where test times of the order of several ms are typical. The early contamination of the test flow by the driver gas in such tunnels restricts the test time. This paper reports measurements of the driver gas arrival time in the test section of the T 4 free-piston shock-tunnel over the total enthalpy range 3 – 17 MJ/kg, using a time-of-flight mass spectrometer. The results confirm measurements made by previous investigators using a choked duct driver gas detector at these conditions, and extend the range of previous mass spectrometer measurements to that of 3 – 20 MJ/kg. Comparisons of the contamination behaviour of various piston-driven reflected <b>shock</b> <b>tunnels</b> are also made...|$|R

50|$|A testing {{facility}} {{that relies on}} rapid release of stored energy to generate {{a short period of}} high enthalpy test conditions for testing of aerodynamic flow, aerodynamic heating and atmospheric reentry, combustion, chemical kinetics, ballistics, and other effects. The rapid release of energy can result in very high instantaneous energy release rates even though the total energy released is modest. This effect also produces short test times, however, with some types of tests in these facilities lasting less than 100 microseconds. Impulse facilities are a special case of blow down facilities where an energy storage mechanism is charged {{over a period of time}} and then released to initiate a test and must be charged again before the next test. This contrasts with continuous facilities such as wind tunnels that may run continuously. Examples of impulse facilities are the shock tube, the <b>shock</b> <b>tunnel,</b> the expansion tube, the expansion tunnel, and the Ludwieg tube.|$|E
50|$|Reflected <b>shock</b> <b>tunnels</b> {{heat and}} {{pressurize}} a stagnant gas by using shockwaves that are redirected {{back into the}} center; this excites the gases and produces movement, heat, and pressure. The gases are then released and expanded through the nozzle and into the test chamber. Operation time is approximately 20 milliseconds.|$|R
50|$|The {{high cost}} of flight testing and the {{unavailability}} of ground facilities have hindered scramjet development. A large amount of the experimental work on scramjets has been undertaken in cryogenic facilities, direct-connect tests, or burners, each of which simulates {{one aspect of the}} engine operation. Further, vitiated facilities (with the ability to control air impurities), storage heated facilities, arc facilities and the various types of <b>shock</b> <b>tunnels</b> each have limitations which have prevented perfect simulation of scramjet operation. The HyShot flight test showed the relevance of the 1:1 simulation of conditions in the T4 and HEG <b>shock</b> <b>tunnels,</b> despite having cold models and a short test time. The NASA-CIAM tests provided similar verification for CIAM's C-16 V/K facility and the Hyper-X project is expected to provide similar verification for the Langley AHSTF, CHSTF and 8 ft HTT.|$|R
40|$|In {{hypervelocity}} flows {{the speed}} of the considered fluid is much larger than {{the speed of}} sound. Commonly the hypersonic flow regime is considered to start above a Mach number of M= 5. Ground based testing of such flows is performed in many different types of facilities. The reason for this is the large range of flow conditions and phenomena encountered in hypersonic flight and the fact that no single facility can simulate all relevant flow parameters simultaneously. In the present chapter, the basic working principle of different types of <b>shock</b> <b>tunnels</b> and <b>shock</b> expansion <b>tunnels,</b> the special aspects of measurement techniques in such short duration facilities with test times of approximately 5 milliseconds and less and some selected typical applications in existing facilities will be discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|The use of impulse {{facilities}} for gas dynamic experimentation on scramjets at high stagnation enthalpies is discussed. It is seen that, although such facilities will produce adequate stagnation enthalpies, {{it is necessary}} to compromise somewhat on the requirements for simulating test section densities, in order to allow realistic operating pressure levels. The <b>shock</b> <b>tunnel</b> and the expansion tube are briefly described, before focusing on operation of the reflected <b>shock</b> <b>tunnel.</b> It is shown that test times and flow starting times are such as to allow testing with models of reasonable size, provided that large regions of flow recirculation do not exist. Some examples of experimental scramjet studies, conducted in a reflected <b>shock</b> <b>tunnel,</b> are presented, demonstrating that the reflected <b>shock</b> <b>tunnel</b> is suitable for basic studies of scramjet flow processes. Provided that the effective enhancement of fuel calorific value by free stream 'freezing' of oxygen in the <b>shock</b> <b>tunnel</b> nozzle expansion does not prove to be an insuperable obstacle, the reflected <b>shock</b> <b>tunnel</b> may be expected to provide realistic simulation of scramjet flows up to speeds approaching earth orbital velocity...|$|E
