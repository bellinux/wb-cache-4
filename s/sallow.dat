Snape praises pupils in Slytherin, his own House but seizes every opportunity to humiliate others, especially Harry. Several incidents, beginning with the shooting pain in Harry's scar during the start-of-term feast, lead Harry and his friends to think Snape is a follower of Voldemort.|$|E

25|$|Lee <b>Sallows</b> is {{the only}} son of Florence Eliza Fletcher and Leonard Gandy <b>Sallows.</b> He was born on 30 April 1944 at Brocket Hall in Hertfordshire, England, {{and grew up in}} the {{district}} of Upper Clapton in northeast London. <b>Sallows</b> attended Dame Alice Owen's School, then located at The Angel, Islington, but failed to settle in and was without diplomas when he left at age 17. Knowledge gained via interest in short-wave radio enabled him to find work as a technician within the electronics industry. In 1970 he moved to Nijmegen in the Netherlands, where until 2009, he worked as an electronic engineer at Radboud University. In 1973 <b>Sallows</b> met up with his Dutch partner Evert Lamfers, now a cardiologist, with whom he has lived ever since.|$|R

The southern flank of <b>Sallows,</b> above Park Beck, is smooth and grassy, other than for the remains of a quarry. The access track to these workings is still in existence, providing the easiest access from the east.|$|R

Mandarin ducks also visit occasionally.|$|E
25|$|But Lillinonah {{refused to}} eat or drink. Her once lovely face turned <b>sallow</b> {{and she began to}} shrink before the very eyes of her distraught father. As summer waned, the once {{beautiful}} daughter of Waramaug became a pale shadow of her former self, so great was her pain and powerful her will. Finally, although he still regarded marriage between his daughter and a white man as a burden almost too heavy to bear, Waramaug relented. Reluctantly, he consented to the marriage of his beloved Lillinonah to the man she had found lost in the woods on that long ago winter's day. Before the marriage could take place, the betrothed couple agreed, the fair young man should return to his own people, {{to let them know that}} he was still alive and well, and to tell them of his plans to wed Lillinonah and live for the rest of his life in the company of the Pootatucks. Both lovers realized that his people would urge him not to go back to his lovely Indian princess. They would remind him that there were plenty of young English women in the colonies just looking for a husband as attractive as he was. What right had he to wed a dusky maid from a foreign and inferior race? But he promised Lillinonah that no argument would ever persuade him to break their vow to marry. After one final winter with his own people, he would return to Lillinonah -- in the early spring. Sadly, he took his leave.|$|E

500|$|On 29 January 1879, Thomas took on Kate Webster as her servant. Webster {{had been}} born as Kate Lawler in Killanne in County Wexford in about 1849.

[...] To capture the [...] "seedy countenance" [...] of the character, Jude Law was given a <b>sallow</b> skin tone that reflected the wear from working in a darkroom. Law's teeth also received a lower gumline and had a rotted look. He was also given a weak, thinning hairline.

500|$|Some {{local field}} and road names, {{and the name}} of Sale itself, are Anglo-Saxon in origin, which {{indicates}} the town was founded in the 7th or 8th centuries. The Old English salh, from which [...] "Sale" [...] is derived, means [...] "at the <b>sallow</b> tree", and Ashton upon Mersey means [...] "village or farm near the ash trees". Although the townships of Sale and Ashton upon Mersey were not mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086, that may be because only a partial survey was taken. The first recorded occurrences of Sale and Ashton upon Mersey are in 1199–1216 and 1260 respectively. The settlements were referred to as townships rather than manors, which suggests further evidence of Anglo-Saxon origins as townships were developed by the Saxons.|$|E

50|$|On 13 May (NS) the {{expedition}} {{ran into the}} English off Bjørnøya. The following day there was talk among the English to detain <b>Sallows,</b> but they ultimately decided to let him go. On 5 June the ship sailed into the northern entrance of Forlandsundet, where, the next day, <b>Sallows</b> told the English {{of the loss of}} their merchant Kijn, who had fallen off a cliff and broken his neck. The same day the Neptunus sailed to the south. They anchored in a small bay on the north shore of Bellsund later called Van Muyden Harbor (modern Van Muydenbukta). Lacking the expertise of Basque whalemen, they had little success with catching whales, and when the men asked <b>Sallows</b> how to catch walrus and stated that they were prepared to follow his instructions, he provided none. <b>Sallows</b> proved incompetent. He appears to have never been to Spitsbergen before, as the information he provided the Dutch was incorrect; he in fact knew nothing about the country or its fauna. He further angered the men when drunk, daily consuming brandy.|$|R
500|$|The {{original}} decor {{consisted of}} grey and terracotta walls, Venetian red seating, large red lampshades suspended {{just above the}} orchestra's heads, mirrors surrounding the arena, and portraits of the leading composers {{to the sides of}} the platform. The paintwork was intended to be the colour of [...] "the belly of a London mouse", and Knightley is said to have kept a string of dead mice in the paint shop in order to ensure the correct tone. The arena had moveable seating on a [...] "brownish carpet that blended with the dull fawnish colour of the walls". The arched ceiling had an elaborate painting of the Paris Opéra, by Carpegat, described by E. M. Forster, as [...] "the attenuated Cupids who encircle the ceiling of the Queen's Hall, inclining each to each with vapid gesture, and clad in <b>sallow</b> pantaloons".|$|E
500|$|While English {{newspapers}} suppressed {{mention of}} the Prince's name {{in association with the}} case, Welsh-language, colonial, and American newspapers were less inhibited.

According to one American press report, when departing the Gare du Nord in Paris in May 1890, Albert Victor was cheered by a waiting crowd of English, but hissed and catcalled by some of the French; one journalist present asked him if he would comment [...] "as to the cause of his sudden departure from England". According to the report, [...] "The Prince's <b>sallow</b> face turned scarlet and his eyes seemed to start from their orbits," [...] and he had one of his companions upbraid the fellow for impertinence.|$|E
500|$|Blandine and Cosima were {{subjected}} to the Patersi curriculum for four years. Cosima's biographer Oliver Hilmes likens the regime to that used for breaking in horses, though Marek describes it as exacting but ultimately beneficial to Cosima: [...] "Above all, Patersi taught her how a 'noble lady' must behave, how to alight from a carriage, how to enter a drawing room, how to greet a duchess as against a commoner ... and how not to betray herself when she was hurt". On 10 October 1853 Liszt arrived at the Patersi apartment, {{his first visit to}} his daughters since 1845. With him were two fellow-composers: Hector Berlioz and Richard Wagner. Carolyne's daughter Marie, who was present, described Cosima's appearance as [...] "in the worst phase of adolescence, tall and angular, <b>sallow</b> ... the image of her father. Only her long golden hair, of unusual sheen, was beautiful". After a family meal, Wagner read to the group from his text for the final act of what was to become Götterdämmerung. Cosima seems to have made little impression on him; in his memoirs he merely recorded that both girls were very shy.|$|E

500|$|Almost {{from its}} inception, the Kingston Trio found itself {{at odds with}} the {{traditional}} music community. Urban folk musicians of the time (to whom Bob Dylan referred in Rolling Stone as [...] "the left-wing puritans that seemed to have a hold on the folk-music community") frequently associated folk music with leftist politics and were contemptuous of the Trio's deliberate political neutrality. Peter Dreier of Occidental College observed that [...] "Purists often derided the Kingston Trio for watering down folk songs in order to make them commercially popular and for remaining on the political sidelines during the protest movements of the 1960s." [...] A series of scathing articles appeared over several years in Sing Out! magazine, a publication that combined articles on traditional folk music with political activism. Its editor Irwin Silber referred to [...] "the <b>sallow</b> slickness of the Kingston Trio" [...] and {{in an article in the}} spring 1959 issue Ron Radosh said that the Trio brought [...] "good folk music to the level of the worst in Tin Pan Alley music" [...] and referred to them as [...] "prostitutes of the art who gain their status as folk artists because they use guitars and banjos." [...] Following the Trio's performance at the premier Newport Folk Festival in 1959, folk music critic Mark Morris wrote: [...] "What connection these frenetic tinselly showmen have with a folk festival eludes me... except that it is mainly folk songs that they choose to vulgarize." ...|$|E
500|$|Anne exerted a {{powerful}} charm {{on those who}} met her, though opinions differed on her attractiveness. The Venetian diarist Marino Sanuto, who saw Anne when Henry VIII met Francis I at Calais in October 1532, described her as [...] "not one of the handsomest women in the world; she is of middling stature, swarthy complexion, long neck, wide mouth, bosom not much raised... eyes, which are black and beautiful". Simon Grynée wrote to Martin Bucer in September 1531 that Anne was [...] "young, good-looking, of a rather dark complexion". Lancelot de Carle called her [...] "beautiful with an elegant figure", and a Venetian in Paris in 1528 also reported that {{she was said to}} be beautiful. The most influential description of Anne, but also the least reliable, was written by the Catholic propagandist and polemicist Nicholas Sanders in 1586, half a century after Anne's death: [...] "Anne Boleyn was rather tall of stature, with black hair, and an oval face of a <b>sallow</b> complexion, as if troubled with jaundice. It is said she had a projecting tooth under the upper lip, and on her right hand six fingers. There was a large wen under her chin, and therefore to hide its ugliness she wore a high dress covering her throat... She was handsome to look at, with a pretty mouth". Sanders held Anne responsible for Henry VIII's rejection of the Catholic Church, and writing fifty years after her death, was keen to demonise her. Sanders's description contributed to what biographer Eric Ives calls the [...] "monster legend" [...] of Anne Boleyn. Though his details were fictitious, they have formed the basis for references to Anne's appearance even in some modern textbooks.|$|E
