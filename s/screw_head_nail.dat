50|$|By design, Torx <b>head</b> <b>screws</b> resist cam-out {{better than}} Phillips head or slot <b>head</b> <b>screws.</b> Whereas Phillips <b>heads</b> were {{allegedly}} designed {{to cause the}} driver to cam out, to prevent overtightening, Torx heads were designed to prevent cam-out. The development of better torque-limiting automatic screwdrivers for use in factories allowed this change. Rather than rely on the tool to slip out of the <b>screw</b> <b>head</b> when a desired torque level is reached (which risks damage to the driver tip, <b>screw</b> <b>head,</b> and/or workpiece), torque-limiting driver designs achieve a desired torque consistently.|$|R

40|$|Objective: Objective: Polyaxial pedicle screws are a safe, useful {{adjunct to}} transpedicular fixation. However, the large <b>screw</b> <b>head</b> size can cause soft tissue irritation, high rod positioning, and facet joint injury. However, the {{mechanical}} resistance provided by small and low profile pedicle screws is very limited. We therefore developed a novel, low profile pedicle screw using grooving and blasting treatment that {{is able to}} resist a high compression bending load. Methods: We evaluated the compression bending force to displacement and yield loads for seven different <b>screw</b> <b>head</b> types that differed {{with regard to their}} groove intervals {{and whether or not they}} had been blasted. Results: The rank order of screw types that had the greatest compression bending force to displacement was as follows: (1) universal polyaxial, (2) low polyaxial with 0. 1 mm grooves and blasting, (3) low polyaxial with blasting, (4) low polyaxial with 0. 15 mm grooves and blasting, (5) low polyaxial with 0. 05 mm grooves and blasting, (6) low polyaxial with 0. 05 mm grooves, (7) and low polyaxial. Low polyaxial screws with 0. 1 mm grooves and blasting had the maximum yield load and highest compression bending force to displacement of all seven polyaxial <b>screw</b> <b>head</b> systems evaluated. Conclusion: Blasting and grooving treatment of pedicle <b>screw</b> <b>heads</b> resulted in <b>screw</b> <b>heads</b> with a high yield load and compression bending force relative to displacement because of increased friction.

50|$|Nail guns use {{fasteners}} {{mounted in}} long strips (similar to {{a stick of}} staples) or collated in a paper or plastic carrier, depending {{on the design of}} the nailgun. Some full <b>head</b> <b>nail</b> guns, especially those used for pallet making and roofing, use long plastic or wire collated coils. Some strip nailers use a clipped <b>head</b> so the <b>nails</b> can be closer together, which allows less frequent reloading. Clip <b>head</b> <b>nails</b> are sometimes banned by state or local building codes. Full Round <b>Head</b> <b>nails</b> and ring shank nails provide greater resistance to pull out. Nailers may also be of the 'coil' type where the fasteners come in wire or plastic collation; the advantage is many more fasteners per load, but at the expense of extra weight. Industrial nailers designed for use against steel or concrete may have a self-loading action for the explosive caps, but most need nails to be loaded by hand. Nail guns vary in the length and gauge (thickness) of nails they can drive.|$|R

In this research, an analytical beam mechanics model was developed to describe the elastic deflection of a cortical screw under a statically applied load. To test the predictive ability of the analytical model, a synthetic bone substitute was used for experiments. The bone substitute was a composite sandwich, consisting of two 6 mm cortical walls separated by a cancellous region. A novel instrument was developed to measure the bending deflection of screws under a radial load applied by a surgical plate at the <b>screw</b> <b>head.</b> A dial indicator and dowel pin arrangement was utilized to measure screw deflection at the <b>screw</b> <b>head</b> and {{along the length of}} the screw in order to determine a deflection curve for the screw axis. The analytical model accurately predicted deflection of the <b>screw</b> <b>head</b> at the location of the applied force, but overestimated deflection of the screw body in the cancellous region of the composite bone. Analytical predictions of location of the maximum bending moment matched the location of observed screw fracture in a clinical setting...|$|R

40|$|A simple, {{effective}} method of removing obstinate screws from bone is described. We have tried this method {{and found it}} effective in all instances. Self-tapping screws which have been embedded in bone {{for a long time}} are notoriously difficult to remove. Bone grows into the thread of the screw and firmly holds it in place. Attempts at removal break down the edges of the slot in the <b>screw</b> <b>head</b> and finally cause the <b>screw</b> <b>head</b> to shear off. This problem is increasingly important, since patients coming for total hip arthroplasty often have various plates and screws in their upper femora from previous osteotomies for osteo-arthritis.

40|$|The {{fundamental}} problem in osteoporotic fracture treatment is {{significant decrease in}} bone mass and bone tissue density resulting in decreased firmness and elasticity of osteoporotic bone. Application of standard implants and standard surgical techniques in osteoporotic bone fracture treatment makes {{it almost impossible to}} achieve stable osteosynthesis sufficient for early mobility, verticalization and load. Taking into account the form {{and the size of the}} contact surface as well as distribution of forces between the osteosynthetic materials and the bone tissue numerical analysis showed advantages of modified osteosynthesis with bone cement filling in the screw bed.
