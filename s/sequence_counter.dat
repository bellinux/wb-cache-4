5000|$|A {{group of}} {{security}} {{researchers at the}} Information Security Group at Royal Holloway, University of London reported a theoretical attack on TKIP which exploits the underlying RC4 encryption mechanism. TKIP uses a similar key structure to WEP with the low 16-bit value of a <b>sequence</b> <b>counter</b> (used to prevent replay attacks) being expanded into the 24-bit [...] "IV", and this <b>sequence</b> <b>counter</b> always increment on every new packet. An attacker can use this key structure to improve existing attacks on RC4. In particular, if the same data is encrypted multiple times, an attacker can learn this information from only 224 connections. While they claim that this attack {{is on the verge}} of practicality, only simulations were performed, and the attack has not been demonstrated in practice.|$|E

50|$|The Fast Packet {{protocol}} {{defined in}} NMEA 2000 {{provides a means}} to stream up to 223 bytes of data, with the advantage that each frame retains the parameter group identity and priority. The first frame transmitted uses 2 bytes to identify sequential Fast Packet parameter groups and sequential frames within a single parameter group transmission. The first byte contains a <b>sequence</b> <b>counter</b> to distinguish consecutive transmission of the same parameter groups and a frame counter set to frame zero. The second byte in the first frame identifies the total size of the parameter group to follow. Successive frames use just single data byte for the <b>sequence</b> <b>counter</b> and the frame counter. Because many of the NMEA 2000 parameter groups exceed 8 bytes but do not require the 1,785-byte capacity of multi-packet, the default method of transmitting multi-frame parameter groups in NMEA 2000 is using the Fast Packet protocol.|$|E

An Argonaute (Ago) protein, {{guided by a}} tightly bound, small RNA or DNA, lies {{at the core of}} these pathways. Argonaute uses its small RNA or DNA to find its target sequences, which it either cleaves or stably binds, acting as a binding scaffold for other proteins. We used Co-localization Single-Molecule Spectroscopy (CoSMoS) to analyze target binding and cleavage by Ago and its guide. We find that both eukaryotic and prokaryotic Argonaute proteins re-shape the fundamental properties of RNA:RNA, RNA:DNA, and DNA:DNA hybridization: a small RNA or DNA bound to Argonaute as a guide no longer follows the well-established rules by which oligonucleotides find, bind, and dissociate from complementary nucleic acid <b>sequences.</b> <b>Counter</b> to the rules of nucleic acid hybridization alone, we find that mouse AGO 2 and its guide bind to microRNA targets 17, 000 times tighter than the guide without Argonaute. Moreover, AGO 2 can distinguish between microRNA-like targets that make seven base pairs with the guide and the products of cleavage, which bind via nine base pairs: AGO 2 leaves the cleavage products faster, even though they pair more extensively. This thesis presents a detailed kinetic interrogation of microRNA and RNA interference pathways. We discovered sub-domains within the previously defined functional domains created by Argonaute and its bound DNA or RNA guide. These sub-domains have features that no longer conform to the well-established properties of unbound oligonucleotides. It is by re-writing the rules for nucleic acid hybridization that Argonautes allow oligonucleotides to serve as specificity determinants with thermodynamic and kinetic properties more typical of RNA-binding proteins than that of RNA or DNA. Taken altogether, these studies further our understanding about the biology of small RNA silencing pathways and may serve to guide future work related to all RNA-guided endonucleases...|$|R

Previously, we found a segment of Escherichia coli genomic DNA in bovine tooth germ mRNA encoding the proline-rich protein P-B. To examine whether E. coli genomic DNA is present in bovine genomic DNA, we constructed a plasmid library from the bovine DNA.

40|$|The {{choice of}} attacks by Karate exponents {{is not well}} {{understood}} but is of importance to coaching practices. This case study explores gaze tracking sequences prior to attacking and seeks possible associative actions performed by the karateka. One Malaysian Karate exponent with over 8 years experience in the National team volunteered {{to participate in a}} simulation match of 2 minutes while wearing the Mobile Eye glasses (ASL, USA). Gaze was recorded at 25 Hz and was synchronised with an additional camera (25 Hz) recording the performance from just outside the mat. Gaze fixations were manually coded along 6 different areas (head, above the head, chest, abdominal, arm and leg) of the opponent. Also performance tactics (attack or counter) and actions (lunges, kick, punch and blocks) by the participant were manually notated. Gaze fixation sequences were selected from the start of an action back to when fixation had stabilized after the last action. The sequences were then clustered using the longest common sequence method in the TraMineR package of R-project statistical software. The clusters, similar in fixations sequence and length, were then associated with the tactics and actions performed. In total 23 fixation sequences and a same number of actions were identified. The most frequent and longest fixations were concentrated around the body and head of the opponent. The dendrogram showed three major types of clusters. Type 1 was mostly associated with counter attacks (79 %) that included punches (57 %). The second and third clusters contained the same number of attacks as counters and were mostly associated with lunges (50 %) and kicks (38 %). Furthermore looking at the lengths of the sequences within each cluster, type 2 and 3 had longer lengths than type 1. Therefore, these two clusters could essentially be considered as one despite differences in eye fixation <b>sequence.</b> The <b>counter</b> chudan (punch to the body) technique was used the most (7 times) and is associated with cluster type 1. Attacking kicks (5 times) and backward lunges (5 times) on the other hand are associated with the combination of type 2 and 3. However, it is rather the length of the fixation sequence in between the attacks than the area of fixations themselves that was found {{to be associated with the}} actions by this karateka. Short fixation sequences evoke a fast punching response. This is likely due to pressured situations where the distance to the opponent was reduced quickly by an attacking opponent. While longer fixation sequences are followed by (evading) lunges and kicks to disrupt the opponent and keep distance from the opponent without a direct attempt to score...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Retroviral Gag {{proteins}} are {{encoded in}} introns and, {{because of this}} localization, {{they are subject to}} the default pathways of pre-mRNA splicing. Retroviruses regulate splicing and translation through a variety of intertwined mechanisms, including 5 '- post-transcriptional control elements, 3 '- constitutive transport elements, and viral protein RNA interactions that couple unspliced and singly spliced mRNAs to transport machinery. Sequences within the gag gene termed inhibitory or instability sequences also appear to affect viral mRNA stability and translation, and the action of these <b>sequences</b> can be <b>countered</b> by silent mutation or the presence of RNA interaction proteins like HIV- 1 Rev. Here, we explored the requirements for mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) Gag expression using a combination of in vivo and in vitro expression systems. Results We show that MMTV gag alleles are inhibited for translation despite possessing a functional open reading frame (ORF). The block to expression was post-transcriptional and targeted the mRNA but was not a function of mRNA transport or stability. Using bicistronic reporters, we show that inhibition of gag expression imparted a block to both cap-dependent and cap-independent translation onto the mRNA. Direct introduction of in vitro synthesized gag mRNA resulted in translation, implying a nuclear role in inhibition of expression. The inhibition of expression was overcome by intact proviral expression or by flanking gag with splice sites combined with a functional Rem-Rem response element (RmRE) interaction. Conclusions Expression of MMTV Gag requires nuclear interactions involving the viral Rem protein, its cognate binding target the RmRE, and surprisingly, both a splice donor and acceptor sequence to achieve appropriate signals for translation of the mRNA in the cytoplasm. </p...|$|R
40|$|Genetic {{algorithms}} (GA) are stochastic {{global search}} methods {{based on the}} mechanics of natural biological evolution, proposed by John Holland in 1975. Here in this thesis, we have exploited possible utilities of Genetic Algorithm optimization in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) experiments. We have performed (i) Pulse sequence generation and optimization for NMR Quantum Information Processing, (ii) efficient creation of NOON states, (iii) Composite operator design and (iv) delay optimization for refocused quantitative INEPT. We have generated time optimal as well as robust pulse sequences for popular quantum gates. A Matlab package is developed for basic Target unitary operator to pulse sequence optimization and is explained with an example. Chapter 1 contains a brief introduction to NMR, Quantum computation and Genetic algorithm optimization. Experimental unitary operator decomposition using Genetic Algorithm is explained in Chapter 2. Starting from a two spin homonu- clear system (5 -Bromofuroic acid), we have generated hard pulse sequences for performing (i) single qubit rotation, (ii) controlled NOT gates and (iii) pseudo pure state creation, which demonstrates universal quantum computation in such systems. The total length of the pulse sequence for the single qubit rotation of an angle π/ 2 is less than 500 µs, whereas the conventional method (using a selective soft pulse) would need a 2 ms shaped pulse. This substantial shortening in time {{can lead to a}} significant advantage in quantum circuits. We also demonstrate the creation of Long Lived Singlet State and other Bell states, directly from thermal equilibrium state, with the shortest known pulse sequence. All the pulse sequences generated here are generic i. e., independent of the system and the spectrometer. We further generalized this unitary operator decomposition technique for a variable operators termed as Fidelity Profile Optimization (FPO) (Chapter 3) and performed quantum simulations of Hamiltonian such as Heisenberg XY interaction and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Exact phase (φ) dependent experimental unitary decompositions of Controlled-φ and Controlled Controlled-φ are solved using ﬁrst order FPO. Unitary operator decomposition for experimental quantum simulation of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in the presence of Heisenberg XY interaction is solved using second order FPO for any relative strengths of interactions (γ) and evolution time (τ). Experimental gate time for this decomposition is invariant under γ or τ, which can be used for relaxation independent studies of the system dynamics. Using these decompositions, we have experimentally verified the entanglement preservation mechanism suggested by Hou et al. [Annals of Physics, 327 292 (2012) ]. NOON state or Schrodinger cat state is a maximally entangled N qubit state with superposition of all individual qubits being at | 0 and being at | 1. NOON states have received much attention recently for their high precession phase measurements, which enables the design of high sensitivity sensors in optical interfer- ometry and NMR [Jones et al. Science, 324 1166 (2009) ]. We have used Genetic algorithm optimization for efficient creation of NOON states in NMR (Chapter 4). The decompositions are, (i) a minimal in terms of required experimental resources – radio frequency pulses and delays – and have (ii) good experimental fidelity. A composite pulse is a cluster of nearly connected rf pulses which emulate the effect of a simple spin operator with robust response over common experimental imperfections. Composite pulses are mainly used for improving broadband de- coupling, population inversion, coherence transfer and in nuclear overhauser effect experiments. Composite operator is a generalized idea where a basic operator (such as rotation or evolution of zz coupling) is made robust against common experimental errors (such as inhomogeneity / miscalibration of rf power or errror in evaluation of zz coupling strength) by using a sequence of basic operators available for the system. Using Genetic Algorithm optimization, we have designed and experimentally verified following composite operators, (i) broadband rotation pulses, (ii) rf inhomogeneity compensated rotation pulses and (iii) zz evolution operator with robust response over a range of zz coupling strengths (Chapter 5). We also performed rf inhomogeneity compensated Controlled NOT gate. Extending Genetic Algorithm optimization in classical NMR applications, we have improved the quantitative refocused constant-time INEPT experiment (Q-INEPT- CT) of M¨kel¨ et al. [JMR 204 (2010) 124 - 130] with various optimization constraints. The improved ‘average polarization transfer’ and ‘min-max difference’ of new delay sets effectively reduces the experimental time by a factor of two (compared with Q-INEPT-CT, M¨kel¨ et al.) without compromising on accuracy (Chapter 6). We also introduced a quantitative spectral editing technique based on average polarization transfer. These optimized quantitative experiments are also described in Chapter 6. Time optimal pulse sequences for popular quantum gates such as, (i) Controlled Hadamard (C-H) gate, (ii) Controlled-Controlled-NOT (CCNOT) Gate and (iii) Controlled SWAP (C-S) gate are optimized using Genetic Algorithm (Appendix. A). We also generated optimal <b>sequences</b> for Quantum <b>Counter</b> circuits, Quantum Probability Splitter circuits and efficient creation of three spin W state. We have developed a Matlab package based on GA optimization for three spin target operator to pulse sequence generator. The package is named as UOD (Unitary Operator Decomposition) is explained with an example of Controlled SWAP gate in Appendix. B. An algorithm based on quantum phase estimation, which discriminates quantum states non-destructively within a set of arbitrary orthogonal states, is described and experimentally verified by a NMR quantum information processor (Appendix. C). The procedure is scalable and can be applied to any set of orthogonal states. Scalability is demonstrated through Matlab simulation...|$|R
