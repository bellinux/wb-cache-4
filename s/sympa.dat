The work of the main daemon can be split up into up to three parallel instances; of the bulk mailer, an arbitrary number of instances may be run in parallel. At least in theory, the bulk mailer processes can even be spread across a cluster of hosts.

The language is supported by a distributed platform called <b>SyMPA,</b> implemented in Java, compliant with the specifications of the MASIF standard from the OMG, that offers all the necessary mechanisms for a secure execution of a distributed MAS.

40|$|Context. Due to {{its great}} mass and its rapid formation, Jupiter {{has played a}} crucial role in shaping the Solar System. The {{knowledge}} of its internal structure would strongly constrain the solar system formation mechanism. Seismology is the most efficient way to probe directly the internal structure of giant planets. Aims. <b>SYMPA</b> is the first instrument dedicated to the observations of free oscillations of Jupiter. Principles and theoretical performance have been presented in paper I. This second paper describes the data processing method, the real instrumental performance and presents the first results of a Jovian observation run, lead in 2005 at Teide Observatory. Methods. <b>SYMPA</b> is a Fourier transform spectrometer which works at fixed optical path difference. It produces Doppler shift maps of the observed object. Velocity amplitude of Jupiter's oscillations is expected below 60 cm/s. Results Despite light technical defects, the instrument demonstrated to work correctly, being limited only by photon noise, after a careful analysis. A noise level of about 12 cm/s has been reached on a 10 -night observation run, with 21 % duty cycle, which is 5 time better than previous similar observations. However, no signal from Jupiter is clearly highlighted. Comment: 13 pages, 26 figure...|$|E

40|$|Dopamine, an ancestral catecholamine, is physiologically natriuretic and vasodilating, thus {{essentially}} protecting against hypertension. Its {{actions are}} {{overshadowed by the}} opposite effects of its main biological partner, norepinephrine, and this is accentuated with aging. Clinical observations combined with molecular biology approaches to catecholamine-synthesizing and catecholamine-metabolizing enzymes and receptors permit the identification of some inborn defects. Subtle changes in the dopamine-norepinephrine balance {{may account for the}} enhanced peripheral noradrenergic activity seen in the setting of decreased dopaminergic activity in advanced age. These changes may contribute to the diminished ability of the aged kidney to excrete a salt load, {{as well as to the}} finding that systolic blood pressure increases with age in populations with a high, but not in those with a low, intake of salt. The attainment of advanced age in Western societies with adverse lifestyle changes (mental rather than physical stress, excess salt intake, overeating, sedentarism) appears to facilitate the development of hyperten-sion. The adaptation to all the preceding lifestyle changes necessitates an increased dopamine generation, which may initially compensate to maintain appropriate natriuresis and vasodila-tion since many patients with initial borderline essential hypertension express their <b>sympa...</b>|$|E
40|$|Knowledge of Jupiter's deep {{interior}} {{would provide}} unique {{constraints on the}} formation of the Solar System. Measurement of its core mass and global composition would shed light on whether the planet formed by accretion or by direct gravitational collapse. At present, the inner structure of Jupiter is poorly constrained and seismology, which consists of identifying acoustic eigenmodes, offers a way to directly measure its deep sound speed profile, and thus its physical properties. Seismology of Jupiter has been considered since the mid 1970 s, but hitherto the various attempts to detect global modes led, at best, to ambiguous results. We report the detection of global modes of Jupiter, based on radial velocity measurements performed with the <b>SYMPA</b> Fourier spectro-imager. The global seismic parameters that we measure include the frequency of maximum amplitude 1213 +/- 50 μ Hz, the mean large frequency spacing between radial harmonics 155. 3 +/- 2. 2 μ Hz and the mode maximum amplitude 49 (- 10 /+ 8) cm/s, all values that are consistent with current models of Jupiter.

40|$|SUMMARY The {{cerebral}} ischemic {{response was}} elicited in anesthetized rabbits by briefly clamping both common carotid arteries after previously occluding the vertebral arteries. The primary cerebral ischemic response, elicited after elimination of baroreceptors, consisted of arterial hypertension, bradycardia, and apnea. The hypertension {{resulted from a}} sterotyped and differentiated pattern of vasoconstriction in renal, mesenteric, and femoral arteries. Total peripheral conductance and cardiac output were decreased. Vagotomy usually changed the bradycardia to a tachycardia unaffected by adrenalectomy. With baroreceptors intact {{the magnitude of the}} bradycardia increased and its latency decreased. The ischemic response persisted after transection of brainstem at the pontomedullary junction and/or of lower cranial nerves (except for the bradycardia which was abolished by transection of vagal rootlets). Transection of the spinal cord at Cl abolished the reflex hypertension and apnea, but not the bradycardia. Hypertension and changes of regional blood flow, comparable qualitatively and quantitatively to those elicited by ischemia, were produced by electrical stimulation of areas of the medullary reticular formation encompassing portions of the gigantocellular and parvocellular reticular nuclei. We conclude: (1) the primary cerebral ischemic response i « associated with a neurally mediated and differentiated pattern of vasoconstriction and with coactivation of the cardiac vagal and <b>sympa...</b>|$|E

In addition, we work on about a dozen projects simultaneously for customers on four continents, which requires a lot of travel and on-site work. Commercially available project management tools are not suited to manage such diversity. We have therefore adopted a set of open source tools, such as Request Tracker, Wiki, <b>Sympa</b> mailing lists, mySQL and maven, implemented some custom additions and integrated the tools into a coherent product to suit our purpose. It enables developers to track their work and communicate effectively; project managers to monitor progress of individual projects; and management to supervise critical parameters of the company at any time.
