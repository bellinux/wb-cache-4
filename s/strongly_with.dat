5|$|Phaeacius {{does not}} try to eat other spiders' eggs, does not enter webs voluntarily, and moves away if it touches one accidentally. It can bite through the threads and pull <b>strongly</b> <b>with</b> its legs, but cannot escape from very sticky webs.

5|$|The alkali metals, due {{to their}} high reactivity, do not occur {{naturally}} in pure form in nature. They are lithophiles and therefore remain close to the Earth's surface because they combine readily with oxygen and so associate <b>strongly</b> <b>with</b> silica, forming relatively low-density minerals that do not sink down into the Earth's core. Potassium, rubidium and caesium are also incompatible elements {{due to their}} large ionic radii.|$|E
5|$|The {{strategy}} appears paradoxical and counter-intuitive as {{a method}} of camouflage, since disrupting outlines depends on using patches of colour which contrast <b>strongly</b> <b>with</b> each other, so the patches are themselves conspicuous. While background matching works best for a single background, disruptive coloration is a more effective strategy when an animal or a military vehicle may have a variety of backgrounds.|$|E

5|$|Cochrane's own sympathies lie most <b>strongly</b> <b>with</b> utilitarianism and liberalism; his {{own account}} is most {{influenced}} by them. He argues that rights derived from considerations of interests can protect individual animals and place limits on {{what can be done}} to them. These rights cannot be violated, even in the name of the greater good, which means that the cultural and economic practices of human beings will be affected. Anticipating criticism, Cochrane explains that not every interest leads to a right. A full consideration of this argument is outside the scope of the book. The argument was expanded in Cochrane's Animal Rights Without Liberation (2012) which, though published after An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory, was based on his doctoral thesis.|$|E
5|$|He {{finished}} the season <b>strongly,</b> <b>with</b> 19 wickets {{in the last}} three matches against Queensland, South Australia and Victoria. This included a haul of 5/28 and 2/37 as he helped New South Wales to a win over their arch-rivals Victoria, who had defeated them earlier in the season. His debut season ended with 26 wickets at 18.73. He did not surpass his debut innings with the bat and ended with 110 runs at 15.71.|$|E
5|$|He started <b>strongly</b> <b>with</b> match {{figures of}} 7/87 in a drawn match against Queensland in Brisbane. The hosts managed {{to hang on}} with three wickets in hand, after Davidson's captain had held up play and wasted 20 minutes for {{the running of the}} Melbourne Cup. He {{performed}} steadily for the next six matches, not taking more than two wickets in any innings, before playing a prominent role in the final match of the Sheffield Shield season against Victoria. It was then 100th anniversary of matches between the old rivals. Davidson took 6/99 in the first innings, including Harvey for 128, before adding 2/61 in the second. It helped prevent a defeat on the anniversary and sealed New South Wales' hat-trick of Shield titles.|$|E

5|$|Incubation of {{the eggs}} lasts 11 to 13 days and is {{performed}} solely by the female. The hatchlings are naked and quills do not begin to show until the third day. Only females brood the nestlings, though both parents may bring whole insects to their young. When a young rufous-crowned sparrow leaves the nest after eight or nine days, it is still incapable of flight, though it can run through the underbrush; during this time it is still fed by the parents. Juveniles tend to leave their parent's territory and move into adjacent habitat in autumn or early winter. Reproductive success varies <b>strongly</b> <b>with</b> annual rainfall and is highest in wet El Niño years, since cool rainy weather reduces the activity of snakes, the main predator of the sparrow's nests.|$|E
5|$|On the 1921 Ashes tour, Macartney—who {{needed a}} special medical {{clearance}} before being selected— {{had a chance}} to rectify his poor batting performances of his pre-war tours of England. In his first match, against Leicestershire, he started <b>strongly</b> <b>with</b> 177. his fast scoring helped Australia complete an innings victory in just over half the allotted playing time. He scored 87 against Surrey, 51 against Combined Services and 77 against Oxford University in the next seven matches leading up {{to the start of the}} Tests, with a total of 539 runs at 53.90 under his belt.|$|E
5|$|Science {{fiction and}} fantasy have {{traditionally}} been puritanical genres aimed at a male readership, and can be more restricted than non-genre literature by their conventions of characterisation and the effect that these conventions have on depictions of sexuality and gender. However, speculative fiction also gives authors and readers the freedom to imagine societies that are different from real-life cultures. This freedom makes speculative fiction a useful means of examining sexual bias, by forcing the reader to reconsider his or her heteronormative cultural assumptions. It has also been claimed by critics such as Nicola Griffith that LGBT readers identify <b>strongly</b> <b>with</b> the mutants, aliens, and other outsider characters found in speculative fiction.|$|E

5|$|Since embryos {{are unknown}} in cairanoolithid eggs, the {{identity}} of their parent is uncertain. They have long been considered to be eggs of titanosaurs or ornithopods (like Rhabdodon). However, numerous characteristics distinguish Cairanoolithus from sauropod eggs (oofamilies Megaloolithidae and Faveoloolithidae), even though they bear superficial similarities in size and shape. Cairanoolithuss columnar eggshell units are quite unlike the fan-shaped ones seen in Megaloolithus, Faveoloolithus, or Fusioolithus. Also, its subdued ornamentation contrasts <b>strongly</b> <b>with</b> the heavily sculpted eggshells of sauropod eggs, {{and it has a}} different pore system. Eggs of ornithopods (Spheroolithidae and Ovaloolithidae), on the other hand, show much closer similarity to cairanoolithids in ornamentation and pore system. However, ornithopod eggs are typically much smaller, and the crystal structure of their eggshell units is distinct.|$|E
5|$|The Storm's 2012 season started very <b>strongly</b> <b>with</b> nine {{consecutive}} wins, the club's best {{start to}} a season {{up to that}} time. A five-game losing streak between Rounds 16 and 21, (the club's second worst losing streak to that time) saw them fall {{from the top of}} the ladder. However, from Round 22 forward they recovered their winning form and finished the regular season with five straight wins, ending the regular season in second place on the table. Storm began their finals campaign with a 24-6 win over South Sydney Rabbitohs. Storm played its fifth Preliminary Final in six years, this time defeating Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles 40-12 at AAMI Park, following this they then went on to claim their second official Premiership defeating the Canterbury Bulldogs 14 – 4 in the Grand Final.|$|E
5|$|The {{alkylation}} {{reaction is}} more widely used than the acylation reaction, although its practice is more technically demanding because {{the reaction is}} more sluggish. For both reactions, the aluminium chloride, {{as well as other}} materials and the equipment, should be dry, although a trace of moisture is necessary for the reaction to proceed. A general problem with the Friedel–Crafts reaction is that the aluminium chloride catalyst sometimes is required in full stoichiometric quantities, because it complexes <b>strongly</b> <b>with</b> the products. This complication sometimes generates a large amount of corrosive waste. For these and similar reasons, more recyclable or environmentally benign catalysts have been sought. Thus, the use of aluminium trichloride in some applications is being displaced by zeolites.|$|E
