25|$|In {{the south}} 83rd Division faced larger problems. It had to advance through {{the towns of}} <b>Strass</b> and Gey, the latter had just been the {{location}} of a heavy battle which practically had rendered 4th Division unable for further offensive operations. Nevertheless, the fresh 83rd Division assisted by the 5th Armored Division was able to take most of <b>Strass</b> and reach Gey the same day against the worn out 353rd VGD. However, the muddy road and mines prevented the Americans from bringing their tanks into both towns to support the infantry. As a result, after some determined German counterattacks on Schafberg, the American units in <b>Strass</b> were effectively cut off and had to be supplied by aircraft, while the Germans started several attacks on the town. Schafberg was retaken on 12 December and tanks reached Gey and <b>Strass,</b> easing the situations. Casualties nevertheless had been heavy, with about 1,000 men for the division in just 3 days.|$|E

After knocking Garth unconscious, <b>Strasser</b> attempts to kill Jill in person, but Joe sneaks up behind them and throws <b>Strasser</b> onto a power line over a transformer.

25|$|In {{the north}} of Gey the {{division}}'s advance fared better and the division took the towns Gürzenich and Birgel. On 14 December a renewed drive conducted by tanks was launched. After meeting initial heavy resistance east of <b>Strass,</b> the advance at {{other parts of the}} frontline forced the Germans to retreat. By 16 December VII Corps finally had reached the Rur, with only a few small bridgeheads west of the river remaining. Casualties for this campaign were tremendous, as VII Corps had about 27,000 casualties in one month.|$|E
25|$|Elements of the 8th and the 28th Infantry Divisions then {{advanced}} on Brandenberg. The 28th Division—just {{like the}} 9th before it (and the 4th Infantry Division, which would relieve the 28th)—also took heavy casualties during its {{stay in the}} Hürtgen Forest. On 14 November, the 2nd Ranger Battalion arrived to relieve elements of the 112th Infantry Regiment. On 6 December, the Rangers moved on Bergstein and subsequently took the strategic position of Hill 400 from defending troops from 980th Grenadier Regiment of the 272nd Volksgrenadier Division. Shortly thereafter, on 12 December, the towns of Gey and <b>Strass</b> were taken by American Forces. On {{the last day of}} the Hurtgen battle the Germans retook the hill from the 13th Regiment who had replaced the Rangers. The U.S. Army would not seize Hill 400 again until February 1945.|$|E
25|$|The {{formulation}} of glasses using lead, alumina, and thallium to increase RI and dispersion {{began in the}} late Baroque period. These glasses are fashioned into brilliants, and when freshly cut they can be surprisingly effective diamond simulants. Known as rhinestones, pastes, or <b>strass,</b> glass simulants are a common feature of antique jewelry; in such cases, rhinestones can be valuable historical artifacts in their own right. The great softness (below hardness 6) imparted by the lead means a rhinestone's facet edges and faces will quickly become rounded and scratched. Together with conchoidal fractures, and air bubbles or flow lines within the stone, these features make glass imitations easy to spot under only moderate magnification. In contemporary production it is more common for glass to be molded rather than cut into shape: in these stones the facets will be concave and facet edges rounded, and mold marks or seams may also be present. Glass has also been combined with other materials to produce composites.|$|E

50|$|At UFC 42, <b>Strasser</b> {{fought against}} Romie Aram. Aram had been undefeated before the fight, and was being groomed by the UFC for a {{possible}} title shot against Matt Hughes. As such, Aram came into the fight as the favorite. In the first round, <b>Strasser</b> was immediately dropped by a punch to the head, but he successfully pulled guard, and the referee stood the fighters up. <b>Strasser</b> scored a takedown later in the round, delivering punches and elbows from the top position. <b>Strasser</b> controlled the second round with standup striking, though Aram remained competitive. The fighters remained on their feet in the third round, with Aram delivering more powerful punches but <b>Strasser</b> displaying better precision. Strasser's blows in this round made Aram's nose bleed. All three judges scored the fight for <b>Strasser,</b> and he won by unanimous decision.|$|R

2500|$|After {{the siege}} of 1187, Jerusalem fell to Muslims. Forty years later Franciscans were allowed back into the Holy Land. Their founder, Saint Francis of Assisi, held the Passion of Christ in special veneration {{and was the first}} person to receive stigmata. In 1217, St. Francis also founded the Custody of the Holy Land to guard and promote the devotion to holy places. Their efforts were {{recognized}} when Franciscans were officially proclaimed custodians of holy places by Pope Clement VI in 1342. Although several travelers who visited the Holy Land during the 12–14th centuries (e.g. Riccoldo da Monte di Croce, Burchard of Mount Sion, James of Verona), mention a [...] "Via Sacra", i.e. a settled route that pilgrims followed, there is nothing in their accounts to identify this with the Way of the Cross, as we understand it. The earliest use of the word [...] "stations", as applied to the accustomed halting-places in the Via Sacra at Jerusalem, occurs in the narrative of an English pilgrim, William Wey, who visited the Holy Land in the mid-15th century, and described pilgrims following the footsteps of Christ to the cross. In 1521, a book called Geystlich <b>Strass</b> (German: [...] "spiritual road") was printed with illustrations of the stations in the Holy Land.|$|E
