It is shown that the critical line of flashover for the different fuels is between 600 °C and 700 °C, and critical condition is different for different fuels and different openings; for the different transverse ventilation, the smoke evacuation has the best effect only when the exhaust port neat the fire is opened...|$|R

5000|$|The Chinchaga fire, {{also known}} as the Wisp fire or the Chinchaga River fire, was a forest fire that burned in {{northern}} British Columbia and Alberta in the summer and early fall of 1950. With a final size of between 1400000 ha and 1700000 ha, it is the single largest recorded fire in North American history. The fire was allowed to burn freely, a result of local forest management policy and the lack of settlements in the region. The Chinchaga fire produced large amounts of smoke, creating the [...] "1950 Great Smoke Pall", observed across eastern North America and Europe. As the existence of the massive fire was not well-publicized, and the smoke was mostly in the upper atmosphere and could not be smelled, there was much speculation about the atmospheric haze and its provenance.

For various combinations of venting velocity and <b>smoke</b> <b>layer</b> temperature, critical <b>smoke</b> <b>layer</b> thickness for onset of entrainment was identified by eye-observation. Air {{entrainment ratio}} {{was measured by}} the change of carbon dioxide concentration in <b>smoke</b> <b>layer</b> (before entrainment) and in exhaust duct (after entrainment). By summarizing the measured results, the followings were clarified. 1) The critical thickness for onset of entrainment depends on <b>smoke</b> <b>layer</b> temperature and largely on <b>smoke</b> <b>layer</b> thickness. When the <b>smoke</b> <b>layer</b> is thick, large venting velocity is needed to cause air entrainment. In this condition, flow into vent opening can be approximated by potential flow to point sink. As the <b>smoke</b> <b>layer</b> thickness is decreased, relatively small venting velocity can cause air entrainment. In this condition, flow pattern can be approximated by potential flow to line sink or to plane sink depending on aspect ratio. 2) Even at the critical condition determined by eye-observation, certain amount of air is entrained. 3) Beyond the critical condition, air entrainment ratio can be approximated by the fraction of actual <b>smoke</b> <b>layer</b> thickness to critical <b>smoke</b> <b>layer</b> thickness for onset of visible air entrainment...|$|E

Because the boundaries of the dispersed smoke plume are often not well defined, user-defined criteria are considered, which allow utilizing the automatic data processing procedure. The smoke boundary height is defined as the location where a special function, determined from the scanning lidar signals, varies within acceptable limits, and the standard deviation of the calculated height does not exceed an established value.

The Fire Radiative Power (FRP) of these events ranged from 10 up to 6000 MW at 1 km resolution, {{and many of these}} fire episodes resulted in long-range transport of smoke over distances up to several hundred kilometers. Three different smoke episodes over Greece are analyzed here using real time hot-spot observations from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) satellite instrument as well as from MODIS hot-spots. Simulations of smoke dispersion are performed with the FLEXPART-WRF model and particulate matter emissions are calculated directly from the observed FRP. The modeled smoke plumes are compared with smoke stereo-heights from the Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) instrument and the sensitivities to atmospheric and modeling parameters are examined. Driving the simulations with high resolution meteorology (4 4 km) and using geostationary satellite data to identify the hot spots allows the description of local scale features that govern smoke dispersion.

An 84 -h WRF Model coupled with chemistry (WRF-Chem) mesoscale simulation of smoke particle transport at Kuching, Malaysia, in the southern Maritime Continent of Southeast Asia is evaluated relative to a unique collection of continuous ground-based lidar, sun photometer, and 4 -h radiosonde profiling. The period was marked by relatively dry conditions, allowing <b>smoke</b> <b>layers</b> transported to the site unperturbed by wet deposition to be common regionally. The model depiction is reasonable overall. Core thermodynamics, including landsea-breeze structure, are well resolved. Total model smoke extinction and, by proxy, mass concentration are low relative to observation. Smoke emissions source products are likely low because of undersampling of fires in infrared sun-synchronous satellite products, which is exacerbated regionally by endemic low-level cloud cover. Differences are identified between the model mass profile and the lidar profile, particularly during periods of afternoon convective mixing. A static smoke mass injection height parameterized for this study potentially influences this result.

40|$|The {{height of}} desert dust and {{carbonaceous}} aerosols layers and, {{to a lesser}} extent, the difficulty in assessing the predominant size mode of these absorbing aerosol types, are sources of uncertainty in the retrieval of aerosol properties from near UV satellite observations. The availability of independent, near-simultaneous measurements of aerosol layer height, and aerosol-type related parameters derived from observations by other A-train sensors, makes possible the direct use of these parameters as input to the OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument) near UV retrieval algorithm. A monthly climatology of aerosol layer height derived from observations by the CALIOP (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization) sensor, and real-time AIRS (Atmospheric Infrared Sounder) CO observations are used in an upgraded version of the OMI near UV aerosol algorithm. AIRS CO measurements are used as a reliable tracer of carbonaceous aerosols, which allows the identification of <b>smoke</b> <b>layers</b> in areas and {{times of the year}} where the dust-smoke differentiation is difficult in the near-UV.

Terephthalic Acid (TPA) smoke {{was developed by the}} U. S. Army and Sebacic Acid (SA) smoke is being developed by Thiokol Corp. The advantages these smokes offer over traditional pyrotechnic smokes include; low generation temperature (approximately 450 {degree}C), lower toxicity, and lower corrosivity. The low generation temperature reduces <b>smoke</b> <b>layering</b> effects and allows the addition of sensory irritants, such as o-Chlorobenzylidene Malononitrile (CS), to the formulation. Some advantages low temperature pyrotechnic smokes offer over nonpyrotechnic smokes include; low cost, simplicity, compactness, light weight, long storage life, and orientation insensitive operation. Low cost permits distribution of multiple units for reduced vulnerability and refill flexibility. Some disadvantages may include the combustibility of the smoke particulate; however, the published lower explosive limit of the mentioned materials is approximately ten times greater than the concentration required for effective obscuration. The TPA smoke cloud contains small quantities of benzene, formaldehyde, and carbon monoxide; no benzene or formaldehyde was identified during preliminary SA smoke analyses performed by Thiokol Corp.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model {{was developed for}} simulating the fire environment of a compartment under the action of a solid-cone water spray such as those discharged from a water mist fire suppression system. A <b>smoke</b> <b>layer</b> was induced by {{a fire in the}} compartment. The solid-cone water spray was discharged to act on the <b>smoke</b> <b>layer,</b> but not on the burning object. Under this condition of having a stable <b>smoke</b> <b>layer,</b> the compartment was divided into three regions. Region 1 is the upper hot <b>smoke</b> <b>layer,</b> Region 2 is the lower cool air layer and Region 3 is the solid-cone spray. The effects on the <b>smoke</b> <b>layer</b> development due to spray-induced flow were considered on the basis of mass, momentum and heat conservation. Water droplets of the solid-cone spray were divided into four typical classes based on the droplet distribution function. The parameters including the <b>smoke</b> <b>layer</b> interface height, smoke temperature and air temperature, smoke flow rate through the opening and oxygen concentration in the air layer were investigated under various heat release rates, water application rates and volume mean diameters of the solid-cone spray. Effective hot gas entrainment and water vapor production suggested that the water spray should contain a variety of droplet size. In this way, a compartment fire can be controlled effectively through indirect interaction such as oxygen concentration depletion. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|Fire {{presents}} a huge risk in buildings. Smoke {{produced in the}} event of a fire creates a large hazard which has the potential to cause fatality. Smoke rises as a plume from the fire and fills a layer at the ceiling. The amount of smoke produced and the rate of the smoke plume mixing with fresh air affects the time in which the air in a room becomes un-breathable. Computer modelling of smoke behaviour in buildings can be performed to help design safer buildings. However modelling packages are limited by the experimental data used in developing them. Models commonly use a free plume assumption. This regards the initial plume smoke as if the entrainment of fresh air into it is not restricted by the geometry of the surroundings. Recent research has been made at the University of Canterbury (Le Quesne, 2009) into the effects of horizontal ceiling openings on <b>smoke</b> <b>layers.</b> These experiments were conducted using a saltwater model. The results of this model suggested that the plume and clean air were mixing at lower rates than expected, based on the assumption of a free plume.

Model performance for February 2008 is evaluated using MODIS true color images, aerosol optical depth (AOD) measurements from the Aerosol Robotic Network, MODIS AOD retrievals, and the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar data with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) atmospheric backscattering and extinction products. Specification of smoke injection height of 650 m in WRF-Chem yields aerosol vertical profiles that are most consistent with CALIOP observations of aerosol layer height. Between the equator and 10 °N, Saharan dust is often mixed with smoke near the surface, and their transport patterns manifest the interplay of trade winds, subtropical highs, precipitation associated with the Intertropical Convergence Zone, and the high mountains located near the Great Rift Valley region. At the 700 hPa level and above, <b>smoke</b> <b>layers</b> spread farther {{to the north and}} south and are often above the dust layers over the Sahel region. In some cases, transported smoke can also be mixed with dust over the Saharan region.

30|$|Finally, we briefly {{discuss the}} {{transient}} timescale of the appearance and {{disappearance of the}} echo, as shown in Fig.  2. Note that both the horizontal and vertical appearance and disappearance of radar echoes in the wintertime mesosphere {{have been known to}} depend on a complex interplay of both ionizing sources and possibly turbulence, in addition to non-ionizing radiation, such as daylight, ion-chemistry and the charging behavior of dust or <b>smoke</b> <b>layers</b> (Kirkwood 2007; Lübken et al. 2006; Kirkwood et al. 2015; Nishiyama et al. 2018). It {{is important to note that}} during the present spike event the deep ionization disappeared rather quickly. At a nighttime altitude of 65  km, the recombination rate was 10 − 9 m 3 s− 1 (Friedrich et al. 2004), and the electron density from the results of model C was on the order of 107 m− 3. Therefore, the timescale is ~[*] 102 s, which is consistent with the spike appearance. However, the estimated electron density at 65  km was not large enough by itself to generate detectable mesospheric echoes (Lübken et al. 2006; Nishiyama et al. 2018). Therefore, the observed transient echo seems to have been caused by ionization due to electron precipitations and strong neutral turbulence and/or meteor smoke particles. Unfortunately, we have no mesospheric wind information during this period, and a vertical wind profile behind the echo layer cannot be examined. Ion-chemistry, including charging behavior of meteor smoke particles, also plays an important role in forming mesospheric echo layers in the VHF range. Electron density variations related to dust and smoke particles, especially during geomagnetically disturbed periods, should be taken into account in future research efforts.|$|R

This study investigates the initial injection height of aerosol generated by the fires over these regions during the biomass burning season, which determines the potential for long-range transport of the smoke. This information is critical for aerosol transport modeling, as it determines the smoke plume evolution. The study focuses on the period 2006 – 2008, and is based on observations made by the CALIOP instrument on board the NASA CALIPSO satellite. MODIS data are synergistically used for the detection of the fires and the characterization of their intensity. CALIPSO aerosol vertical distributions generated by the active fires are analyzed to investigate the aerosol top height which is considered dependent on the heat generated by the fires and can be associated with the initial injection height. Aerosol top heights of the vertically homogenous <b>smoke</b> <b>layers</b> are found to range between 1. 6 and 5. 9 km. Smoke injection heights from CALIPSO are compared with mixing layer heights taken by the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecast (ECMWF), to investigate the direct injection of smoke particles into the free troposphere. Our results indicate that the aerosol plumes are observed within the boundary layer for the 50 % of the cases examined. For the rest of the cases, the strong updrafts generated by the fires resulted to smoke injection heights greater than the ECMWF estimated mixing layer by 0. 5 to 3. 0 km, indicating a direct smoke injection into the free troposphere. The smoke injection height showed a dependence on the MODIS-Land Fire Radiative Power product which is indicative of the fire intensity, especially in the cases of lower static stability in {{the upper part of the}} boundary layer and the free troposphere...|$|R
40|$|Four-year {{observations}} (2010 – 2014) with EARLINET polarization lidar and AERONET sun/sky photometer at Limassol (34. 7 ° N, 33 ° E), Cyprus, {{were used}} to study the soil dust content in lofted fire smoke plumes advected from Turkey. This first systematic attempt to characterize less than 3 -day-old smoke plumes in terms of particle linear depolarization ratio (PDR), measured with lidar, contributes to the more general effort to properly describe {{the life cycle of}} free-tropospheric smoke–dust mixtures from the emission event to phases of long-range transport (> 4 days after emission). We found significant PDR differences with values from 9 to 18 % in lofted aerosol layers when Turkish fires contributed to the aerosol burden and of 3 – 13 % when Turkish fires were absent. High Ångström exponents of 1. 4 – 2. 2 during all these events with lofted <b>smoke</b> <b>layers,</b> occurring between 1 and 3 km height, suggest the absence of a pronounced particle coarse mode. When plotted vs. travel time (spatial distance between Limassol and last fire area), PDR decreased strongly from initial values around 16 – 18 % (1 day travel) to 4 – 8 % after 4 days of travel caused by deposition processes. This behavior was found to be in close agreement with findings described in the literature. Computation of particle extinction coefficient and mass concentrations, derived from the lidar observations, separately for fine-mode dust, coarse-mode dust, and non-dust aerosol components show extinction-related dust fractions on the order of 10 % (for PDR = 4 %, travel times > 4 days) and 50 % (PDR = 15 %, 1 day travel time) and respective mass-related dust fractions of 25 % (PDR = 4 %) to 80 % (PDR = 15 %). Biomass burning should therefore be considered as another source of free tropospheric soil dust...|$|R
