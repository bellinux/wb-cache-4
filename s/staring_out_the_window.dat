[...] The song follows a blues chord progression (I–IV–I) during the first eight bars. [...] Brown {{had a difficult time}} writing lyrics that fit the riff. [...] After an all-night session, Bruce played it on a standup bass while lyricist Pete Brown was <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> [...] Slowly, he started to write [...] "It's getting near dawn and lights close their tired eyes", which is used in the first verse.

5000|$|IndieLondon {{rated the}} song {{four out of}} five, stating it is [...] "as {{beautiful}} and haunting as we've come to expect from this Swedish performer... and perfectly ethereal to accompany <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> at a snowy landscape. If it wasn't essential beforehand, it damn sure is now!" [...] Marc Hogan of Pitchfork Media commented that the [...] "feedback-streaked piano ballad 'Possibility' is a relative bright spot, but {{like the rest of}} the tracks the soundtrack, it pales in comparison to the work on her own records." [...] Krista Richmond of KillerFilm called the song [...] "lovely in its haunted, enchanting way" [...] and added that it is [...] "soft and melodic enough to pull at even the toughest of heartstrings". MusicRadar's Joe Bosso opined that [...] "this stark, piano-based hymn is spiritual stuff, and Li's arresting vocal powers will have you on your knees in worship." [...] Adam Pfleider of AbsolutePunk expressed that [...] "Lykke Li is where the problem of the soundtrack lies. I can't listen to this music without thinking of where it will end up in the melodrama of some teenager metamorphosing into a CGI werewolf. 'Possibility' is a beautiful song, but I can't help feeling its placement in the film would kill its blossoming melody in the end." ...|$|E
