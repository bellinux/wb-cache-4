30|$|The materials, methods, {{and designs}} used for {{packaging}} vary widely {{depending on the}} device and application. For example, silicon microcantilevers are loaded into AFMs using clamps, spring-loaded clips, or adhesive gels, but other devices require custom-designed packages for electrical connections, thermal interfaces, microfluidic manifolds, or vacuum packaging to maintain the resonator at low pressure [16]. The dissipation due to all components associated with the <b>supporting</b> <b>frame</b> and package is collectively called boundary damping. There are three main mechanisms of boundary damping: (i) support losses or anchor losses due to the radiation of elastic waves (or stress waves) from the resonator into the <b>supporting</b> <b>frame</b> [20 – 35]; (ii) microsliding at the interfaces between the resonator and <b>supporting</b> <b>frame,</b> and between the <b>supporting</b> <b>frame</b> and package [61]; and (iii) viscoelasticity in the gels and adhesives used to bond the <b>supporting</b> <b>frame</b> to the package [9].

2500|$|Telescopes {{built in}} the 17th and early 18th century used single element non-achromatic {{objective}} lenses that suffered from interfering rainbow halos (chromatic aberration) introduced by the non-uniform refractive properties of single glass lenses. This degraded {{the quality of the}} images they produced. Telescope makers from that era found that very long focal length objectives had no appreciable chromatic aberration (the uncorrected chromatic aberration fell within the large diffraction pattern at focus). They also realized that when they doubled the diameter of their objectives they had to make the objective's focal length 4 times as long (focal length had to be squared) to achieve the same amount of minimal chromatic aberration. As the objective diameter of these refracting telescopes was increased to gather more light and resolve finer detail they began to have focal lengths as long as 150 feet. Besides having very long tubes, these telescopes needed scaffolding or long masts and cranes to hold them up. [...] Their value as research tools was minimal since the telescope's <b>support</b> <b>frame</b> and tube flexed and vibrated in the slightest breeze and sometimes collapsed altogether.|$|E

30|$|To gain a {{qualitative}} {{understanding of the}} various mechanisms, let us consider a generic description of micromechanical and nanomechanical resonators. Typically, the resonators are attached to relatively large <b>supporting</b> <b>frames</b> to facilitate handling and interconnection, and then packaged by mounting the <b>supporting</b> <b>frame</b> inside test stations, instruments, or customized packages. Illustrative examples include commercial silicon microcantilevers (1 to 10  μm thick and 0.1 to 0.5  mm long) used for atomic force microscopy (AFM), and silicon nitride nanomembranes (30 to 200  nm thick with lateral dimensions ranging from 10  μm to 1  mm) used in optomechanical systems [85, 86]. In both cases, the devices are attached to silicon frames with thickness {{of a few hundred}} microns and lateral dimensions of a few millimeters. The attachment can be monolithic (exemplified by bulk-micromachined silicon resonators) or engendered by the adhesion of thin films to the <b>supporting</b> <b>frame</b> in the case of surface-micromachined devices [16].|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{hydraulic}} steel {{radial gate}} (SRG) with two oblique arms is designed by using topology optimization and size optimization. Topology and size optimization {{are carried out}} by using CAD software, e. g., Hyperworks. In the current design, the SRG is initially considered to have three main components, i. e., the arms, the <b>supporting</b> <b>frame</b> of arms and a panel for water retaining. To give a better design of these components, e. g., arms and its <b>supporting</b> <b>frame,</b> topology optimization is adopted. By topology optimization method, the shape of arm and the <b>supporting</b> <b>frame</b> are obtained. As construction of the new SRG is reconstructed by the components obtained, the stiffness, strength and stability of the new SRG is checked and some sizes of components in SRG are readjusted by using size optimization. The final design of the SRG is around 24 % lighter than the traditional design whilst {{the safety of the}} new design is much better...|$|R

30|$|The {{other sources}} of {{boundary}} damping face challenges that are common to many aspects of thin-film adhesion and packaging of MEMS [16]. The variety of designs, processes, techniques, and materials {{makes it difficult to}} develop general guidelines for a large class of devices and applications. Models for adhesion and friction can provide useful qualitative insights into the underlying mechanisms but improving thin-film adhesion and reducing microsliding remains an art. Nevertheless, several general strategies can be formulated: (i) minimize deformations and strains at the interface between the <b>supporting</b> <b>frame</b> and package: for example, by employing the anti-symmetric modes of dual-cantilever beams [60] or double-paddle oscillators [62, 63], and acoustically isolating the resonator from the <b>supporting</b> <b>frame</b> and package; (ii) use precision-machined clamps and avoid spring-loaded clips, gels, polymer-based adhesives, and die bonds for packaging; and (iii) ensure good adhesion between the resonator and <b>supporting</b> <b>frame</b> by activating the substrate before depositing structural thin films, employing adhesion promoters in the form of ultrathin films of Ti or Cr, and using ion-beam assisted deposition techniques [88].|$|R
40|$|This paper studies {{a design}} {{approach}} that yields robust vibratory MEMS gyroscopes. The design {{is based on}} multiple drive-mode resonators with incrementally spaced frequencies, distributed symmetrically around {{the center of a}} <b>supporting</b> <b>frame.</b> These resonators are structurally constrained in the tangential direction with respect to the <b>supporting</b> <b>frame.</b> In the presence of an angular rotation rate about the z-axis, a harmonic Coriolis force is induced on each proof mass. These force vectors lie in the tangential direction, generating a resultant torque on the <b>supporting</b> <b>frame.</b> The net Coriolis torque excites the <b>supporting</b> <b>frame</b> into torsional oscillation about the z-axis, which is capacitively detected to generate angular rate measurement. Two batches of prototypes have been fabricated using in-house single crystal silicon on insulator (SCS-SOI) bulk-micromachining and EFAB ™ process commercially available from Microfabrica. Wideband drive operation was demonstrated in SOI devices. EFAB process yielded 850 Hz devices with quality factor 250 in air (bandwidth 3 Hz) and 850 in vacuum. Increase of temperature from 25 ° to 125 °C shifts the resonant frequency down by roughly bandwidth, while quality factor drops by 8 %. Parasitics model associated with EFAB consists of only a lumped capacitor and is simpler than two-parametric parasitics circuit in SOI devices. Nonlinear parametric excitation of motion at resonant frequency by super-harmonic AC voltage was experimentally characterized. This actuation method provides high amplitude of motion and separates motion from parasitics in frequency domain. The actuation method can potentially further improve the bandwidth and gain characteristics of distributed mass gyroscope...|$|R
