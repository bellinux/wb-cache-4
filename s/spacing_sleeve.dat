The mount {{is intended to}} be located between a compressor and a housing. The studs or ribs then deform to isolate the housing from radial vibration of the compressor, and the lip seal creates an annular seal between the housing and the compressor.

40|$|Sudden falls of large-area hard roofs in a {{mined area}} release {{a large amount}} of elastic energy, {{generate}} dynamic loads, and cause disasters such as impact ground pressure and gas outbursts. To address these problems, in this study, the sleeve fracturing method (SFM) was applied to weaken a hard roof. The numerical simulation software FLAC 3 D was used to develop three models based on an analysis of the SFM working mechanism. These models were applied to an analysis of the fracturing effects of various factors such as the borehole diameter, hole <b>spacing,</b> and <b>sleeve</b> pressure. Finally, the results of a simulation were validated using experiments with similar models. Our research indicated the following: (1) The crack propagation directions in the models were affected by the maximum principal stress and hole spacing. When the borehole diameter was fixed, the fracturing pressure increased with increasing hole spacing. In contrast, when the fracturing pressure was fixed, the fracturing range increased with increasing borehole diameter; (2) The most ideal fracturing effect was found at a fracturing pressure of 17. 6 MPa in the model with a borehole diameter of 40 mm and hole spacing of 400 mm. The results showed {{that it is possible to}} regulate the falls of hard roofs using the SFM. This research may provide a theoretical basis for controlling hard roofs in mining...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the historical development of}} blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) farming in Tracadie Bay (Prince Edward Island, Canada) and relates the <b>spacing</b> of suspended <b>sleeves</b> (SS) on longlines to seston uptake. From 1990 to 2001, mussel biomass in Tracadie Bay increased {{by a factor}} of four (from 1137 to 4743  t). By 2001, seston uptake rates were approximately three-fold water renewal rates, and harvest yields (kg sleeve− 1) were significantly lower than in the early 1990 s. A one-year field experiment was carried out to determine whether a change in SS could restore harvest yields. We found that SS (10, 20, 40, 60, 80  cm) had no significant effect on the condition index of mussels. However, high SS positively affected shell growth and abundance for small seeds that were densely packed within sleeves. A complete husbandry shift toward high SS and high seeding densities (within sleeves) may enhance farm productivity (production per unit of effort) and curtail seston uptake at the bay scale...|$|R
40|$|The present {{invention}} {{relates to}} an improved expandable intramedullary nail for the fixation of bone fractures. The nail includes an elongate sleeve having one end adapted to be inserted within the medullary cavity of the bone. The {{one end of}} the sleeve is formed of a predetermined maximum retracted diameter to permit the insertion of the one end within the bone cavity. A plurality of circumferentially spaced, radially expandable elements are carried by the {{one end of the}} sleeve. The elements are radially movable from a first, retracted position wherein the elements define a first diameter to a second, expanded position wherein the elements define a second diameter greater than the predetermined maximum retracted diameter and the first diameter. In accordance with the present invention, when the elements are in the expanded position, the elements provide at least two support points at the second diameter and axially <b>spaced</b> along the <b>sleeve</b> for engagement with the inner wall of the bone cavity. A camming member is carried by the one end of the elongate sleeve for moving the elements from the retracted position to the expanded position. An actuator is located {{at the other end of}} the sleeve and is coupled to operate the camming member for controlling the radial position of the elements...|$|R
40|$|The {{critical}} {{mission tasks}} assessments effort seeks {{to determine the}} physical performance requirements that astronauts must meet in order to safely and successfully accomplish lunar exploration missions. These assessments will determine astronaut preflight strength, fitness, and flexibility requirements, {{and the extent to}} which exercise and other countermeasures must prevent the physical deconditioning associated with prolonged weightlessness. The purpose is to determine the flexibility and strength that crewmembers must possess in order to reach Crew Exploration Vehicle controls during maneuvers that result in sustained acceleration levels ranging from 3. 7 G to 7. 8 G. An industry standard multibody dynamics application was used to create human models representing a 5 th percentile female, a 50 th percentile male, and a 95 th percentile male. The additional mass of a <b>space</b> suit <b>sleeve</b> was added to the reaching arm to account for the influence of the suit mass on the reaching effort. The human model was merged with computer models of a pilot seat and control panel for the Crew Exploration Vehicle. Three dimensional paths were created that guided the human models hand from a starting position alongside its thigh to three control targets: a joystick, a keyboard, and an overhead switch panel. The reaching motion to each target was repeated under four vehicle acceleration conditions: nominal ascent (3. 7 G), two ascent aborts (5. 5 G and 7. 8 G) and lunar reentry (4. 6 G). Elbow and shoulder joint angular excursions were analyzed to assess range of motion requirements. Mean and peak elbow and shoulder joint torques were determined and converted to equivalent resistive exercise loads to assess strength requirements. Angular excursions for the 50 th and 95 th percentile male models remained within joint range of motion limits. For the 5 th percentile female, both the elbow and the shoulder exceeded range of motion limits during the overhead reach. Elbow joint torques ranged from 10 N-m (nominal ascent) to 60 N-m (ascent abort). Shoulder joint torques ranged from 65 N-m (nominal ascent) to 280 N-m (ascent abort). Maximal equivalent exercise loads reached 30 lb in tricep extension, 9 lb in bicep curl, 110 lb in unilateral pullover and unilateral bench press for nominal conditions (lunar reentry), and 188 lb in unilateral pullover and unilateral bench press. The location of the pilot seat was found to be inadequately located to allow a 5 th percentile female to reach the switches on the overhead panel. Elbow strength requirements were found to be well within population norms. Shoulder strength was found to be a limiting factor. Reaching under nominal ascent and lunar reentry conditions was found to require near maximal shoulder strength. Reaching under ascent abort conditions requires shoulder strength well beyond population norms. Pilot seats must adjust to accomodate a 5 th percentile female. Exercise countermeasures must maintain maximal pullover and bench press strength to allow pilots to reach and operate controls during lunar reentry. Reaching will not be possible during ascent abort conditions. Flight controls should be built into armrests or flight control must be accomplished by autonomous systems during acceleration exceeding 4. 6 G...|$|R
