Crabs were collected monthly, over a period of one year (from July/ 2002 to June/ 2003), in seven depths, from 5 to 35 m. Abiotic factors were monitored as follows: superficial and bottom <b>salinity</b> (<b>psu),</b> superficial and bottom temperature (C), organic matter content (%) and sediment composition (%). In total, 366 hermit crabs were sampled in Caraguatatuba and 126 in Ubatuba. The highest frequency of occurrence was verified at 20 m during winter (July) in Caraguatatuba and 25 m during summer (January) in Ubatuba. The highest occurrences were recorded in the regions with bottom salinities ranging from 34 to 36 psu, bottom temperatures from 18 to 24 C and, low percentages of organic matter, gravel and mud; and large proportion of sand in the substrate. There was no significant correlation between the total frequency of organisms and the environmental factors analyzed in both regions. This evidence suggests that other variables as biotic interactions can influence the pattern of distribution of L. loxochelis in the analyzed region, which is considered the limit of the northern distribution of this species...|$|E

This study presents a centennially resolved record of Mg/Ca-derived sea surface temperature (SST) estimates from the eastern equatorial Atlantic (EEA) and a core top-based proxy validation.

The precise mechanism of adverse effect of such seasonal salinity changes on calcite secreting organisms is, however not clear. The seasonal fresh water influx from the estuaries also affects the pH and alkalinity of the coastal seawater. Therefore, to understand the effect of salinity induced pH/alkalinity variations on benthic foraminifera, living specimens of Rosalina globularis were subjected to different salinity. Additionally, water samples were collected from an estuary during both monsoon and post monsoon season to understand the relationship between salinity, pH and total alkalinity (TA).

40|$|Between about 9 and 13 ky bp, the {{isostatically}} {{depressed area}} of the Champlain, Ottawa and St Lawrence valleys were engulfed by the Atlantic Ocean. The resulting Champlain Sea had two distinct sources of water: fresh water sourced from large proglacial lakes fed by the collapsing Laurentide Ice Sheet and North Atlantic marine waters sourced via the contemporaneous eustatic rise. This study focuses on the most recent transition from the Champlain Sea (CS) to modern Lake Champlain when the fluxes between the two water sources were {{in a state of}} transition. Carbonate-associated sulfate (CAS) offers proxy evidence for the &# 948; 34 S of ancient waters, a key piece in our interpretation of both flux dynamics and primary redox conditions within the basin. Previous research into CAS has shown that sulfate can be structurally substituted into authigenic and biogenic carbonates. Following wide ranging efforts to calibrate and validate this proxy, it has been demonstrated that the isotopic composition commonly reflects the ambient waters at the time of carbonate precipitation. Because of relatively low rates of bacterial sulfate reduction, the &# 948; 34 S of CAS in the restricted CS can be used to approximate salinity relationships over the interval of interest. These data suggest the Champlain Sea was subject to four flood events from Lake Agassiz dropping salinity (measured in Practical Salinity Units) throughout the lifetime of the marine incursion. Splits taken from the CAS solution yield Mg, Fe, & Sr concentrations; unique to each water source, these data reflect the marine to lacustrine change in aqueous metals and identify the source of the proglacial flood source as Lake Agassiz. Due to the low concentrations of both CAS and calcium carbonate in our samples, we are {{in a unique position to}} assess the lower limits of the CAS proxys utility in studies of marine to lacustrine transitions. By capturing the transition from the Champlain Sea to Lake Champlain I detail the dynamics of this evolution as both unrelenting isostatic rebounding and diminishing flood sizes repeatedly lowered the <b>salinity</b> (<b>PSU)</b> of the CS. Moreover, low pyrite and iron monosulfide concentrations within the sediments reveal that aqueous sulfate must have been delivered back into the North Atlantic...|$|E

Some of these pollutants are not toxic but if it exist in excess of that environment will lead harm to human life and other marine organisms such as fish, and coral since all these ecosystem linked with each other very well. A study was carried out to determine and to compare the water quality in Ambong Bay and Usukan Bay, besides to determine and to compare the percentage of hard coral cover between the two bays. It is also were carried out to determine the relationship between the water quality of the two bays and the percentage of hard coral cover. Fecal coliform analyses were done by using Membrane Filter (14 F) method while heavy metals were done by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Otomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES). The results obtained showed that the in situ water parameter for both bays in terms of temperature (°C), pH, turbidity (NFU), <b>salinity</b> (<b>psu),</b> DO (mg/L) shows that it is in the range compared to National Water Quality Standards of Malaysia. Meanwhile for fecal coliform, Ambong Bay showed higher reading compared to Usukan Bay which was 1. 44 CFU/ 100 mL ± 1. 20 to 4. 70 CFU/ 100 mL ± 1. 03 respectively. For heavy metal analyses, Usukan Bay shows higher concentrations of Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Zn, and Al which were 0. 003 mg/L ± 0. 001, 0. 456 mg/L ± 0. 058, 0. 991 mg/L ± 0. 308, 0. 438 mg/L ± 0. 049, 2. 917 mg/L ± 1. 245, and 2. 336 mg/L ± 0. 344 respectively.

The statistical analysis of One way ANOVA showed that there were significance difference (p< 0. 05) for temperature, pH, turbidity, DO, fecal coliform and six heavy metals elements. Pearson's Correlation showed that only temperature shows relationship with the percentage of hard coral cover.

Using the above data sets, we derived the following relationships between visible Rrs and absorption by CDOM, i. e. Rrs (412) /Rrs (555) vs. aCDOM (400) (m&minus; 1 ) and aCDOM (412) (m&minus; 1 ) with a correlation coefficient R 2 0. 67 {{greater than those}} noted for Rrs (443) /Rrs (555) and Rrs (490) /Rrs (555) vs. aCDOM (400) (m&minus; 1 ) and aCDOM (412) (m&minus; 1 ). Determination of aCDOM (m&minus; 1 ) at 400 nm and 412 nm is particularly necessary to describe its absorption {{as a function of}} wavelength λ using a single exponential model in which the spectral slope S as a proxy for CDOM composition is estimated by the ratio of aCDOM at 412 nm and 400 nm and the reference is explained simply by aCDOM at 412 nm. In order to derive salinity from the absorption coefficient of CDOM, in-situ measurements of salinity made {{in a wide range of}} water types from dense oceanic to light estuarine/coastal systems were used along with in-situ measurements of aCDOM at 400 nm, 412 nm, 443 nm and 490 nm. The CDOM absorption at 400 nm was better inversely correlated (R 2 = 0. 86) with salinity than at 412 nm, 443 nm and 490 nm (R 2 = 0. 85 – 0. 66), and this correlation corresponded best with an exponential (R 2 = 0. 98) rather than a linear function of salinity measured in a variety of water types from this and other regions. Validation against a discrete in-situ data set showed that empirical algorithms derived from the above relationships could be successfully applied to satellite data over the range of water types for which they have been developed. Thus, we applied these algorithms to a series of SeaWiFS images for the derivation of CDOM and salinity in the context of operational mapping and monitoring of the springtime evolution of LSW plume in the ECS. The results were very encouraging and showed interesting features in surface CDOM and salinity fields in the vicinity of the Yangtze River estuary and its offshore domains, when a regional atmospheric correction (SSMM) was employed instead of the standard (global) SeaWiFS algorithm (SAC) which revealed large errors around the edges of clouds/aerosols while masking out the nearshore areas.

Elevation of sea surface temperature is projected under global climate change, and future increases in precipitation extremes related to the monsoon are also expected. Thus, the lowering of salinity could become a more common phenomenon and its impact on corals could be significant as extreme precipitation usually occurs during the coral spawning season. Here, we investigated the interactive effects of temperature [24, 27 (ambient), 30, 32 °C] and <b>salinity</b> [33 <b>psu</b> (ambient), 30, 26, 22, 18, 14 psu] on larval settlement, post-settlement survival and early growth of the dominant coral Platygyra acuta from Hong Kong, a marginal environment for coral growth. The results indicate that elevated temperatures (+ 3 °C and + 5 °C above ambient) did not have any significant effects on larval settlement success and post-settlement survival for up to 56 days of prolonged exposure. Such thermal tolerance was markedly higher than that reported in the literature for other coral species. Moreover, there was a positive effect of these elevated temperatures in reducing the negative effects of lowered <b>salinity</b> (26 <b>psu)</b> on settlement success. The enhanced settlement success brought about by elevated temperatures, together with the high post-settlement survival recorded up to 44 and 8 days of exposure under + 3 °C and + 5 °C ambient respectively, resulted in the overall positive effects of elevated temperatures on recruitment success. These results suggest that projected elevation in temperature over the next century should not pose any major problem for the recruitment success of P. acuta. The combined effects of higher temperatures and lowered <b>salinity</b> (26 <b>psu)</b> could even be beneficial.

Plants collected from shallow meadows at Alicante (SE Spain), with an ambient salinity of 36. 8 – 38. 0 psu, were placed in tanks of 300 L with an additional overhead light and exposed to different salinity treatments (ranging from 25 to 57 psu) during 15 days. To estimate the mortality and growth recuperation, in some experiments shoots were returned to control <b>salinity</b> (38 <b>psu).</b> Leaf growth was measured in the laboratory where epiphytic fauna and flora were removed from leaves, with a razor blade, to determine their biomass. P. oceanica was negatively influenced by increased salinity. Shoots showed a significant decrease in growth and survival, whereas epiphyte biomass did not show a clear response because of their high variability. Maximum leaf growth occurred between 25 and 39 psu. In addition, plants suffered considerable mortality at <b>salinities</b> above 42 <b>psu</b> and below 29 psu, with 100 % mortality at 50 <b>psu.</b> In <b>salinities</b> between 39 and 46 psu, surviving plants were able to regain their original growth rate when returned to normal seawater <b>salinity</b> (38 <b>psu).</b> These results suggest that P. oceanica is one of the most sensitive seagrasses to salinity increments it is more tolerant to salinity reductions (25. 0 – 36. 4 psu), perhaps due to the terrestrial origin of seagrasses.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to find the optimal conditions for harpacticoid copepod cultivation at the laboratory scale. Harpacticoid copepods were collected from the macroalgae, Padina sp. and Amphiroa sp., and used to study the effects on their survival rates of temperature, salinity, diet, substratum and initial density. Mixed cultures of the dominant harpacticoid copepods (Families Harpacticidae and Laophontidae), were used for subsequent experiments. After 7  d, copepods reared at 30  °C showed the highest mean (±SE) survival rate (46. 67  ±  5. 85 %; p <  0. 05), followed by the copepods cultivated at 25  °C and 35  °C, respectively. Harpacticoid copepods could survive in brackish water to hyper-saline water, between 10 practical <b>salinity</b> units (<b>psu)</b> and 40 psu, but not in freshwater (p <  0. 05). In addition, they also showed favorable results with <b>salinity</b> at 27 <b>psu</b> and 30 psu with mean survival rates of 44. 72  ±  6. 35 % and 42. 78  ±  4. 94 %, respectively, which were higher than the mean survival rate of 26. 67  ±  13. 33 % recorded in <b>salinity</b> at 10 <b>psu</b> (p <  0. 05). The feeding experiment was inconclusive since there were no significant differences between the survival rates of copepods on the different algal diets. On the other hand, copepods fed with commercial shrimp feed had the mean lowest survival rate (p <  0. 05). No significant differences among the different sediment types were observed. However, harpacticoid copepods showed a preference for smaller-sized particles as higher survival rates were obtained for copepods reared in sand-silt sediment rather than in fine sand, coarse sand, vermiculite (artificial sediment) and no substrate. Culture at low densities such as 100 individuals/L and 500 individuals/L is suggested for initial cultivation based on this experiment...|$|R

40|$|With {{increasing}} use {{of silver}} nanoparticles (AgNPs), concerns about their potential deleterious effects on aquatic ecosystems have increased. Most previous {{studies have focused on}} the toxicity of AgNPs while their bioavailability has been seldom investigated. The present study examined the effects of salinity on the aggregation kinetics as well as the bioavailability of commercial 80 -nm citrate-coated AgNPs (c-AgNPs) in {{the presence or absence of}} a nonionic surfactant (Tween 20) to marine medaka (Oryzias melastigma). In addition, the uptake of soluble Ag was quantified for comparison and for deducting the uptake of soluble Ag during AgNP exposure by applying a biokinetic model. The authors found that the addition of Tween 20 immediately slowed down the process of aggregation of AgNPs, and an elevated amount of Tween 20 (20 mu M) kept AgNPs well dispersed, even in the 30 -psu salinity medium. Uptake rate constants (k(u)) of AgNPs were less than half the soluble Ag at low <b>salinities</b> (1 <b>psu</b> and 5 psu), while limited bioavailability of c-AgNPs was observed at high <b>salinities</b> (15 <b>psu</b> and 30 psu). However, the Tween 20 -stabilized AgNPs (t-AgNPs) were accumulated by medaka at comparable rates as the soluble Ag, indicating the importance of dispersion for bioavailability of AgNPs in a highly ionic environment. The present study provided the first insight of the bioavailability of AgNPs to fish in a high-ionic environment. More studies are needed to gain a full understanding of bioavailability of AgNPs in marine environments. Environ Toxicol Chem 2014; 33 : 632 - 640. (c) 2013 SETA...|$|R
40|$|Problem statement: Regular {{sediment}} resuspension or dredging {{in coastal}} zones can induce stress in a postlaval penaeid shrimp, which affects immune response. Phenoloxidase {{is a significant}} enzyme in the penaeid shrimpâs immune system which, when used as a biomarker, can serve as an early warning sign in ecological systems. The stress response of shrimp postlarvae from sediment reuspension was analyzed by sediment toxicity test in laboratory. Approach: This {{study was designed to}} determine the activity of phenoloxidase with sediment resuspension in two types of postlarval penaeid shrimp, the white shrimp (Penaeus vannamei) (at <b>salinity</b> 17 <b>psu)</b> and the black tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon) postlarva 10 (at 17 psu and 3 psu). Sediment resuspension varied from 1 : 40, 1 : 16, 1 : 8 and 1 : 4 v/v (sediment/water) and control water (filtered seawater). Sediment in the experiment was taken from Chanthaburi Estuary, Thailand which may contaminated by several pesticides. After resuspension, 20 of the postlarval shrimp were added to one liter of resuspended water for 96 h. At the end of the test, phenoloxidase activity and shrimp survival were analyzed. Results: The study of black tiger shrimp at <b>salinity</b> 3 <b>psu</b> found that only sediment resuspension at 1 : 40 was sufficient to increase the activity of phenoloxidase in shrimp postlarvae. All sediment resuspension treatments had higher levels of phenoloxidase activity than in the control group. However, only phenoloxidase activity at 1 : 40 and 1 : 16 showed a significantly higher difference to the control group (p Conclusion: The phenoloxidase activity showed an early response with sediment resuspension even though the response did not show a clear increase in the order of sediment resuspension treatment...|$|R
