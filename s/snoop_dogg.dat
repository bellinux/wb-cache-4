5|$|Dr.Dre {{has stated}} {{that he is a}} perfectionist and is known to {{pressure}} the artists with whom he records to give flawless performances. In 2006, <b>Snoop</b> <b>Dogg</b> told the website Dubcnn.com that Dr.Dre had made new artist Bishop Lamont re-record a single bar of vocals 107times. Dr.Dre has also stated that Eminem is a fellow perfectionist, and attributes his success on Aftermath to his similar work ethic. He gives a lot of input into the delivery of the vocals and will stop an MC during a take if it is not to his liking. However, he gives MCs that he works with room to write lyrics without too much instruction unless it is a specifically conceptual record, as noted by Bishop Lamont in the book How to Rap.|$|E
5|$|The {{length of}} time that Detox had been record for, {{as well as the}} limited amount of {{material}} that had been officially released or leaked from the recording sessions, had given it considerable notoriety within the music industry. Numerous release dates (including the ones mentioned above) had been given for the album over the years since it was first announced, although none of them transpired to be genuine. Several musicians closely affiliated with Dr. Dre, including <b>Snoop</b> <b>Dogg,</b> fellow rappers 50 Cent and Game and producer DJ Quik, had speculated in interviews that the album will never be released, due to Dr. Dre's business and entrepreneurial ventures having interfered with recording work, as well as causing him to lose motivation to record new material.|$|E
5|$|Gangsta rap {{is a kind}} of hip hop, most {{importantly}} characterized by a lyrical focus on macho sexuality, physicality, and a dangerous criminal image. Though the origins of gangsta rap {{can be traced back to}} the mid-1980s style of Philadelphia's Schoolly D and the West Coast's Ice-T, the style broadened and came to apply to many different regions in the country, to rappers from New York, such as Notorious B.I.G and influential hip hop group Wu-Tang Clan, and to rappers on the West Coast, such as Too Short and N.W.A. A distinctive West Coast rap scene spawned the early 1990s G-funk sound, which paired gangsta rap lyrics with a thick and hazy sound, often from 1970s funk samples; the best-known proponents were the rappers 2Pac, Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, and <b>Snoop</b> <b>Dogg.</b> Gangsta rap continued to exert a major presence in American popular music through the end of the 1990s and early into the 21st century.|$|E
