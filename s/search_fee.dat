5000|$|Under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), an {{international}} application, {{which is also}} called PCT application, [...] "shall relate to one invention only or {{to a group of}} inventions so linked as to form a single general inventive concept". If the requirement of unity of invention is not met, the International Searching Authority (i.e., the patent office in charge of carrying out the international search) [...] "is entitled to request the applicant to pay an additional <b>search</b> <b>fee</b> for each invention beyond the first which is to be searched".|$|E
50|$|In most patent laws, {{unity of}} {{invention}} is a formal administrative requirement that must be met by a patent application to become a granted patent. Basically, a patent application can relate only to one invention {{or a group of}} closely related inventions. The purpose of this requirement is administrative, as well as financial. That is, the requirement serves to preclude the option of filing one patent application for several inventions, while paying only one set of fees (filing fee, <b>search</b> <b>fee,</b> examination fee, renewal fees, and so on). Unity of invention also makes the classification of patent documents easier.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{birth and}} death registrations, the local (church) copies of {{marriage}} registers for churches are treated as ecclesiastical records and thus are deposited in diocesan record offices or county record offices (often but not always the same office) when full or when the church is closed. Such records are thus available for inspection in their original form (or a direct filmed copy) without the requirement to pay a <b>search</b> <b>fee</b> or the purchase of certified copies. The availability can be somewhat random, some churches have not yet filled their original 1837 registers while others might have deposited a register in recent weeks.|$|E
5000|$|Therefore, the {{findings}} of the search division—that the application lacks unity—may be contested before the examining division, during the examination phase. If successful, and if further <b>search</b> <b>fees</b> were paid during the search phase, the further <b>search</b> <b>fees</b> may be refunded. If successful, and if further <b>search</b> <b>fees</b> had not been paid during the search phase, [...] "...the applicant is entitled as of right to have the whole subject-matter of his unitary invention searched." ...|$|R
50|$|The former {{time limit}} for paying the further <b>search</b> <b>fees</b> {{was a period}} the EPO {{specified}} as between two weeks and six weeks. Under new Rule 64 EPC, in force as of April 1, 2010, the time limit for the further <b>search</b> <b>fees</b> is now two months.|$|R
5000|$|In {{reaction}} {{to such a}} request from the International Searching Authority (ISA), the applicant may pay all {{or some of the}} requested additional <b>search</b> <b>fees,</b> and the International Searching Authority (ISA) then establishes the international search for all or some of the inventions or groups of inventions, respectively. The applicant may also decide not to pay any of the additional <b>search</b> <b>fees,</b> and, in such case, the ISA does not carry out a search for the inventions or groups of inventions for which no <b>search</b> <b>fees</b> have been paid. The international search report (ISR) is then established only for the first claimed invention.|$|R
50|$|Within {{one month}} after the filing of an application, a filing fee and a <b>search</b> <b>fee</b> are due. Additional fees may also be due {{depending}} on the size of the application and the number of claims. Namely, if the application comprises more than 35 pages, an additional fee is due (of 14 Euros, as of February 2014) for the 36th and each subsequent page. Furthermore, if the application contains more than fifteen claims at the time of filing, claim fees are due. As of February 2014, a claims fee of 225 Euros is due for the 16th and each subsequent claim up to the limit of 50, and a claims fee of 555 Euros for the 51st and each subsequent claim.|$|E
5000|$|Withdrawal of an {{application}} is the gravest procedural step {{that can be}} taken, since the application becomes dead without possibility of revival. A European patent application may be withdrawn at any time by the applicant, except when a third party has initiated proceedings concerning entitlement to the grant of the European patent. One reason for withdrawing {{an application}} may be to avoid its publication, if for instance it has been decided to keep the invention secret instead of applying for a patent. To avoid publication, the withdrawal must occur before [...] "the termination of the technical preparations for publication". Another reason for withdrawing an application may be to obtain a refund of the <b>search</b> <b>fee</b> and/or examination fee, if it has been decided not to pursue the application further. According to the EPO Guidelines, ...|$|E
5000|$|Extensive {{changes were}} also {{made to the}} {{possibilities}} for the legal remedy of the failure to observe various time limits within the European patent system. Most particularly, the failure to pay various fees (filing fee, designation fee, <b>search</b> <b>fee</b> and examination fee) were, until the coming into force of the EPC 2000, excluded from the standard legal remedies of further processing [...] and re-establishment of rights. Under the EPC 1973, the failure to observe the time limits for paying these fees could only be remedied by strict grace periods. These grace periods have now {{been replaced by the}} application of further processing [...] and, if the further processing time limit is missed, re-establishment of rights, which although not directly applicable to the time limit missed originally, is applicable to the failure to observe the time limit for further processing.|$|E
5000|$|A {{search report}} {{is carried out}} within 6 to 8 months. No {{additional}} <b>searching</b> <b>fee</b> is required.|$|R
50|$|Under certain circumstances, such as {{following}} {{the withdrawal of}} a European patent application, some fees that were paid may be refunded. This is true for <b>search</b> <b>fees</b> and the examination fee.|$|R
50|$|HM Land Registry {{receives}} {{no government}} funding, {{being required to}} ensure that its income covers expenditure, and finances itself from registration and <b>search</b> <b>fees.</b> It provides online access to its database of titles (ownership and charges or interests by other parties) and most plans (maps). People need to pay a fee to access some information.|$|R
50|$|One night Arthur Morstan, a pupil of Archer House is {{attacked}} and gets injured. His younger sister Mary Morstan requests Sherlock Holmes to solve why his brother is attacked while John H. Watson {{falls in love}} with her. They began searching Arthur's room with the help of Abdullah, roommate of Arthur. Holmes suspects that the offeder stole into the room from skylight and he and Mary find small handprints around it on the roof. Watson tries to get up on the roof also but he falls and injures his cheek. Holmes sticks the broken pieces on Arthur's bed and finds it's a piece of paper with the sign of four people - Arthur, Bart, Thady, and Jonny. He asks Langdale Pike to check who they are. Pike sells Watson two containers of ointment as substitute for <b>search</b> <b>fee</b> and Watson heals his injury with it.|$|E
40|$|Companies {{across all}} sectors with {{increasingly}} smaller size rely on alliance relationships to bolster revenues {{during times of}} economic uncertainty. When forming alliances, large firms typically hire vendors such as investment banks to help identify potential alliance partners. However, small businesses with intention to build alliance find difficulties to search desired partners especially on a global arena due to three causes: 1) lack of skills, resources and information; 2) too small to capture the attention of investment banks or alike; 3) not affordable to the high <b>search</b> <b>fee</b> charged by vendors. Thus, reliable information about small business market is often limited. The odds of successful search and match become very low given their limited access to right information. In fact, traditionally labor-intensive search and match either by investment banks or by firms themselves have been both costly and time-consuming. On the demand side, small businesses are searching for more alliance opportunities than ever before while deal size has been increasingly declining since the last two decades. The globalizing, deregulation and internet are attributed to the driving forces of this trend. Under this circumstances, E-Alliances is able to close the huge gap between the demand side which represents the tremendous alliance search needs of small businesses worldwide and the supply side which is constrained by search capacity. In this paper, the author will interpret how E-Alliances is able to help worldwide small business companies to reach their desired partners in a fast, cheap and DIY manner. The author will also discuss the outlook of alliance...|$|E
5000|$|If, when {{carrying}} out a search, the search division considers that the application lacks unity (i.e., it doesn't meet the provisions of Article 82), a partial search report is established. The EPO then requires one or more further <b>search</b> <b>fees</b> for the other identified inventions, or groups of inventions, that the search may cover.|$|R
50|$|One {{reason why}} {{companies}} decide to use defensive publication over patents is cost. In the United States, for example, {{to obtain a}} published patent application, one must incur at least filing <b>fee,</b> examination <b>fee,</b> <b>search</b> <b>fees,</b> and early publication fees (currently $530, minimum plus $300 for early publication), and meet the filing requirements for a proper patent application.|$|R
5000|$|If the {{applicant}} {{disagrees with the}} ISA’s finding of lack of unity of invention, the additional fees may be paid under protest. In the protest procedure, {{the applicant}} files a reasoned statement explaining why it considers that the requirement of unity of invention has been complied with, or {{that the number of}} additional fees required is excessive. After payment of the additional <b>search</b> <b>fees</b> and, if required, of a protest fee, the protest is examined by a review body. If the review body finds the protest justified, it orders the total or partial reimbursement of the additional <b>search</b> <b>fees,</b> and, if applicable, the protest fee, to the applicant. When, for instance, the European Patent Office acts as ISA, the review body in charge of examining the protest consists of three members: [...] "the head of a directorate, normally the head of the directorate by which the invitation to pay additional fees was issued, an examiner with special expertise in unity of invention and, normally, the examiner who issued the invitation." ...|$|R
5000|$|In the UK, solicitors {{generally}} {{refer to}} disbursements as payments {{which they have}} made or will make to third parties {{in connection with the}} matter they are dealing with on behalf of the client. Section 67 of the Solicitors Act 1974 refers to disbursements as [...] "costs payable in discharge of a liability properly incurred by solicitor on behalf of the party to be charged with the bill". These may include court fees, counsel's fees, fees for medical or other expert reports or <b>search</b> <b>fees</b> in a property transaction.|$|R
50|$|High-end {{executive}} search firms get a retainer (up-front fee) {{to perform a}} specific search for a corporate officer or other senior executive position. Typically, retained searches tend to be for positions that pay upwards of US$150,000 and often far more. <b>Search</b> <b>fees</b> are typically 33.33% of the annual compensation of the recruited executive. Fee payments may be made in thirds, 1/3 of fee paid on initiation of the search, 1/3 paid thirty days later, and the final 1/3 paid thirty days later or upon placement of the candidate. Alternatively, a fixed fee may be established. Retained search firms provide a guarantee to do an assignment over if the hired candidate leaves before one year {{as long as there}} has not been a material change in the position requirements or management team. In a retained <b>search,</b> the <b>fee</b> is for the time and expertise of the search firm. The firm is employed to conduct the entire recruitment effort from startup until the candidate has started working.|$|R
50|$|The {{international}} search report can help the applicant decide {{whether it would be}} worthwhile seeking national protection, and if so, in how many countries, as fees and other expenses, including translation costs, must be paid to enter the national phase in each country. Yet another advantage of filing a PCT application under the PCT is that many national patent authorities will rely on the {{international search}} report (although the PCT does not obligate them to do so) instead of performing a prior art search themselves, and the applicant may thus be able to save <b>search</b> <b>fees.</b>|$|R
50|$|Another form of {{high-end}} executive search, delimited or engaged search, {{is often}} improperly categorized as retained search, {{although there are}} distinct differences. Similar to retained search firms, delimited/engaged search firms require an up-front fee before engaging the search. Unlike a conventional retainer, however, the delimited/engaged <b>search</b> commitment <b>fee</b> is refundable if the recruiter fails to achieve a hire or other deliverable specified in the contract. Moreover, the delimited/engaged <b>search</b> commitment <b>fee</b> does not follow the typical 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 model of retainers, but rather is a relatively small up-front fee which is discounted from the final placement fee of 25-35% of the successful candidate’s first year compensation. Both retained and delimited/engaged searches involve partial payment prior to filling the job, and the contracted recruiter has the search exclusively. Therefore, the search can be customized to the client organization’s needs, with the search professional providing a consultative service throughout the process. While both retained and delimited/engaged searches serve client employers rather than job-seeking executives, delimited/engaged search contracts always (as opposed to sometimes) state a future date when the project must be completed or the downpayment refunded.|$|R
40|$|World-Wide Web-based search systems (or pull technology) stimulated large {{commercial}} database vendors {{to transfer}} to Web interfaces as well. Various reasons exist why Web-interfacing could be an asset to traditional online search systems, for example, using familiar Web browsers, implementing user-friendly Web sites, or lower <b>search</b> <b>fees</b> because of the unique features of client/server architecture. The differences between the content and retrieval procedures of search engines and database vendors emphasize the fact that vendors have to be extremely cautious when transferring to a Web interface. It seems possible that Web interfacing techniques and database vendors can soon become full partners in the pull technology environment. The purpose of the research was therefore to investigate and report on the trends currently noticeable among those online systems or databases embarking on full Web interfacing. Experienced online searchers, especially those who use front-end software to support their online search activities, seem dubious {{about the fact that}} Web interfaces can provide the same search sophistication level as obtained via traditional dial-up searching.

40|$|Graduation date: 2007 This project {{describes}} a web-based {{information management system}} which has been widely used by staff members and students at OSU. Without this system, {{it was very hard}} for the staff members to manage a variety of fees; for example, if they want to change a certain fee, staff members had to send email messages to notify every student and other staff members. For students, it was also hard to find out the latest fees of courses. Now, with the support of this system, it brought a bridge between staff members and students. There are four roles in this project; the first role is administrator who can manage course fees, course fee proposals, departments, and originators and so on. The second role is committee who can browse <b>fees,</b> <b>search</b> <b>fees,</b> and vote confirmation. The third role is originator whose responsibilities are creating course fees, dropping course fees, creating proposal, and withdrawing proposals. The last role is the guest who just can view various fees and download the fee book, but they can not change anything on the web site. With these four integrated roles, we can easily and efficiently manage the fees and streamline the workflow. This project was realized with the latest Microsoft technologies such as. Net C#, ASP. net, ADO. net, three-tier architecture, SQL Server 2005 and design pattern. It is also managed by the software engineering tools. The milestone and time schedule was set to control the risk of the software development...|$|R
