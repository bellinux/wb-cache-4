40|$|The in-cabin sound {{pressure}} level response of a vehicle in yawed wind conditions can differ significantly between the smooth flow conditions of the aeroacoustic wind tunnel and the higher turbulence, transient flow conditions experienced on the road. Previous {{research has shown that}} under low turbulence conditions there is close agreement between the variation with yaw of in-cabin {{sound pressure}} level on the road and in the wind tunnel. However, under transient conditions, {{sound pressure level}}s on the road were found to show a smaller increase due to yaw than predicted by the wind tunnel, specifically near the leeward sideglass region. The research presented here investigates the links between transient flow and aeroacoustics. The effect of small geometry changes upon the aeroacoustic response of the vehicle has been investigated. It was found that sideglass pressures showed close agreement at all turbulence levels while <b>surface</b> <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> levels also showed similar behaviour under a wide range of on-road flow conditions. While the overall sideglass sound pressure level changed under the various yaw conditions, the change in shape of the frequency spectrum was less significant. Geometry changes made to a base vehicle reduced the sensitivity of the in-cabin noise to on-road turbulence, showing that shape-change can modify sensitivity to on-road turbulence...|$|E
40|$|An inverse {{method for}} in-situ {{estimation}} of acoustic surface impedance targeting inverse sound rendering in rooms We propose two methods {{based on the}} inverse boundary element method (IBEM) for the estimation of acoustic impedances of the interior surfaces of a room. The algorithms take as input the geometrical model of the space, a set of <b>sound</b> field <b>pressures</b> measured at random points and the vibration strength of the sound source. A first approach is a constrained least-squares method that attempts to find simultaneously <b>surface</b> <b>sound</b> <b>pressures</b> and particle velocities, parameters that define the acoustic impedance. This is in contrast with previous work on similar acoustic inverse problems that solve for one parameter (typically {{the strength of the}} vibration velocity) and use regularization techniques to reduce the effects of the ill-conditioning and obtain smooth solutions. Our second approach is an iterative optimization process that estimates directly the sought impedances assuming that the interior surfaces have homogeneous impedance values. This assumption allows in addition a significant reduction of the dimensionality of the optimization problem. A numerical example of the performance of both methods is presented. Preliminary experiments in a reverberation chamber are also shown. ...|$|R

A double pressure peak is found in the model (credited to image action) which is qualitatively similar to measured sound correlations. Incompressible flow aerosound calculations are discussed. The effects of a series of vortices moving in the same idealized potential flow are also studied. The vortices are assumed to be statistically independent so their intensities can be added. The frequency of appearance of the vortices are determined from measurements.

The four most common sources of vacuum cleaner noise are the motor, the fan, the airflow and the surface vibrations. Connections between the motor and such vibrating surfaces of a vacuum cleaner allow very efficient transmission of the force and the motion, which are then transformed to <b>sound.</b> The <b>surface</b> velocity, the <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> and the acoustic power of the vibrating surfaces are very important parameters in the noise control and source location problems. The {{purpose of this study}} is to asses the vibro-acoustical characteristics of a sample wet and dry type vacuum cleaner and to determine the acoustic power radiated from this type of vacuum cleaner. For this purpose, the near-field <b>sound</b> <b>pressure,</b> the <b>surface</b> velocity and the sound intensity levels are measured. By using these measurements, the sound intensity, the near-field <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> and the <b>surface</b> velocity mappings are generated and using these measurements, the sound intensity compares the results compared to find the effects of the vibrating surfaces on the total vacuum cleaner sound power level...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT- An {{apparatus}} {{has been}} developed to find acoustic sound sources in the near field of a radiating object operating in a noisy environment. It is based on two orthogonally placed particle velocity probes (two Microflowns[1], [2]). The complete signal processing is done in real time with battery powered analogue circuitry, resulting {{in a very small}} and handheld measurement device. One Microflown is used to display the sound level and to listen to the source whilst rejecting the background noise and another Microflown is used to create a stereo indication in which direction the device must be moved to pinpoint the noise source. TECHNICAL PAPER- In complex sound fields, e. g. diffuse sound fields, reflections or many simultaneous radiating sound sources, it is often a difficult task to find specific <b>sound</b> sources with <b>pressure</b> microphones. However, in the near field of sources the use of a Microflown is advantageous over a pressure microphone because of three reasons [3]: 1. The <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> level and particle velocity level are of similar magnitude in the free field. Close to an acoustic hard <b>surface,</b> the <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> doubles and the particle velocity reduces to zero. Therefore, when a particle velocity sensor such as the Microflown is held close to a hard surface it will not pick up much of the background noise. The sound pressur...|$|R
40|$|A general {{analytical}} method is developed for {{determination of the}} radiated noise field from highly sheared, subsonic flows {{in the presence of}} rigid surfaces. The method is specifically formulated to use measurable flow field properties as the basis input data for calculations. The governing equations of a viscous, incompressible fluid are employed to determine approximately the so-called shear noise source strength distribution in the flow. Mean rates of strain and fluctuating velocity covariances are the fundamental input data for calculations. The method is applied to the wall jet region of a circular jet impinging at 45 deg to an infinite plane surface. Velocity field measurements of Foss are used to describe the required flow properties. Comparisons of calculated results with measured <b>surface</b> <b>pressures</b> and <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> levels are given and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Offshore piling {{for wind}} farm {{construction}} {{has attracted a}} lot of attention in recent years due to the extremely high noise emission levels associated with such operations. While underwater noise levels were shown to be harmful for the marine biology, the propagation of airborne piling noise over sea has not been studied in detail before. In this study, detailed numerical calculations have been performed with the Green's Function Parabolic Equation (GFPE) method to estimate noise levels up to a distance of 10 km. Measured noise emission levels during piling of pinpiles for a jacket-foundation wind turbine were assessed and used together with combinations of the sea surface state and idealized vertical sound speed profiles (downwind sound propagation). Effective impedances were found and used to represent non-flat sea surfaces at low-wind sea states 2, 3, and 4. Calculations show that scattering by a rough sea <b>surface,</b> which decreases <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> levels, exceeds refractive effects, which increase <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> levels under downwind conditions. This suggests that the presence of wind, even when blowing downwind to potential receivers, is beneficial to increase the attenuation of piling sound over the sea. A fully flat sea surface therefore represents a worst-case scenario...|$|R

Hence, an experimental setup was built where tyre tread samples are loaded and rapidly unloaded in the direction normal to a wearing course sample from an ISO 10844 -road. Time records of contact forces and <b>sound</b> <b>pressures</b> are acquired during the separation. The separation process {{in terms of the}} contact forces and noise generation is described and interpreted. There is good repeatability in the general character of the time signals for a given geometry, but variations occur requiring statistical analysis, as the initial conditions (on smaller length scales) are only approximately repeated. The measured adherence force depends strongly on load, load duration, and unloading rate, in a way supported by theories for contact of rough <b>surfaces.</b> The total <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> level of the noise generated during separation {{is directly related to the}} level of the adherence force, but the distribution of energy in 1 / 3 -octave bands cannot be estimated from the adherence force record alone, as they also depend on the exact contact geometry.

Understanding the effect of <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> on the acoustic properties of these materials is crucial when attempting to predict silencer performance. In this article, we experimentally investigate the sound absorption characteristics of porous metal materials at high <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> level. The effects of material parameters on the sound absorption characteristics of porous metal materials under high <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> level are further explored experimentally. Measurements are carried out by using a standard impedance tube that has been modified to accommodate <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> level of up to 150 [*]dB. The experimental results show that {{with the increase in}} <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> level, the effect of <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> level on the sound absorption characteristics yields different variation regularities in different frequencies. The sound absorption performance of porous metal materials increases with the increase in <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> level in low frequency, which is reasonably consistent with the theoretical results.

40|$|Understanding female mate {{preference}} {{is important for}} determining the strength and direction of sexual trait evolution. The <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> level (SPL) acoustic signalers use is often an important predictor of mating success because higher <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> levels are detectable at greater distances.

The aEC replaced the bony ear canal of cadaveric human temporal bones. The radial orientation of the aEC relative to the manubrium of the TM was varied. Tones of 0. 2 to 18. 4 kHz delivered through the aEC induced surface motions of the TM that were quantified using stroboscopic holography; the distribution of sound in {{the plane of the}} tympanic ring PTR was measured with a probe tube microphone. The results suggest that the ear canal orientation has no substantial effect on TM surface motions, but PTR at frequencies above 10 kHz is influenced by the ear canal orientation. The complex TM surface motion patterns observed at frequencies above a few kilohertz are not correlated with simpler variations in PTR distribution at the same frequencies, suggesting that the complex sound-induced TM motions are more related to the TM mechanical properties, shape, and boundary conditions rather than to spatial variations in the acoustic stimulus.
