5|$|Another one of Bowerman's pupils, Phil Knight, {{partnered with}} Bowerman and {{revolutionized}} the sport with {{the formation of}} the shoe company giant, Nike. Knight graduated from the University of Oregon in 1959 and went on to Stanford University for graduate school. There, he developed the idea to import Japanese running <b>shoes</b> to the American market. After earning his MBA from Stanford, he returned to the University of Oregon where he and Bowerman struck a handshake deal in 1964, each with a $500 investment into a company called Blue Ribbon Sports to import Japanese running <b>shoes.</b> In the late 1960s, Bowerman's pursuit of lighter <b>shoes</b> for his athletes led him to develop a sole by pouring rubber into his wife's waffle iron, inventing the modern running shoe. After Knight decided to rename the company Nike and develop its own <b>shoes,</b> Bowerman's invention became the prototype for the company. The shoe made its debut in the 1972 Olympic Trials at Hayward Field with Steve Prefontaine as one of the early endorsers. Although Bowerman retired from coaching in 1972, he remained on Nike's board until 1999. In that time, Nike exploded into a multibillion-dollar company.|$|E

50|$|The {{cutting of}} grooves in {{the sole of}} the Top-Sider was an {{implementation}} of a process of splitting or siping a <b>shoe</b> sole invented and patented in the 1920s by John Sipe. This process was instrumental in maximizing the traction of the Authentic Original Sperry Top-Sider boat <b>shoe,</b> which was first introduced in 1935. Sperry's first <b>shoe</b> featured a white outsole, which prevented the <b>shoe</b> from leaving marks on a boat's deck. The Commonwealth <b>Shoe</b> and Leather Co. later partnered with Paul A.

50|$|For {{the moment}} ignore <b>shoe</b> sizes: a pair {{consists}} of a left and a right <b>shoe,</b> which can then be sold for €10. Consider a game with 2001 players: 1000 of them have 1 left <b>shoe,</b> 1001 have 1 right <b>shoe.</b> The core of this game is somewhat surprising: it {{consists of a}} single imputation that gives 10 to those having a (scarce) left <b>shoe,</b> and 0 to those owning an (oversupplied) right <b>shoe.</b> No coalition can block this outcome, because no left <b>shoe</b> owner will accept less than 10, and any imputation that pays a positive amount to any right <b>shoe</b> owner must pay less than 10000 in total to the other players, who can get 10000 on their own. So, there is just one imputation in the core.|$|R
