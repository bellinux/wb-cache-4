50|$|Clamp-on vises are {{basically}} very light-duty bench vises. They usually have smooth jaws for wood, plastic and light metalworking, but some have <b>serrated</b> <b>jaws</b> for getting {{a better grip}} on metal. Some unique vises combine these features in a rotating design.They also help to secure an object while working on the object.|$|E
5000|$|A {{crocodile}} clip (also alligator clip or spring clip) is a sprung metal clip with long, <b>serrated</b> <b>jaws</b> {{which is used}} for creating a temporary electrical connection. This simple mechanical device gets {{its name from the}} resemblance of its jaws to that of an alligator's or crocodile's. It is used to connect an electrical cable to a battery or some other component. Functioning much like a spring-loaded clothespin, the clip's tapered, <b>serrated</b> <b>jaws</b> are forced together by a spring to grip an object. When manufactured for electronics testing and evaluation, one jaw of the clip is typically permanently crimped or soldered to a wire, or is bent to form the inner tubular contact of a ~4 mm female banana jack, enabling quick non-permanent connection between a circuit under test and laboratory equipment or to another electrical circuit. The clip is typically covered by a plastic shroud or [...] "boot" [...] to prevent accidental short-circuits.|$|E
50|$|Ants have long, broad, <b>serrated</b> <b>jaws,</b> {{used for}} digging, {{collecting}} food, fighting and cutting, and {{are probably the}} most important work tool ants possess. Ants typically bite each other when fighting. Some ants use mandibles to injure the enemy and squirt poison into the wound. Harvester ants use their mandibles to collect and carry seeds. Army ants have sharp mandibles that are better adapted for fighting than obtaining food or nursing the larvae. Carpenter ants make their nests in various wooden structures, which they hollow out with their sharp mandibles.|$|E
50|$|The diet {{of green}} turtles changes with age. Juveniles are omnivorous, {{but as they}} mature they become {{exclusively}} herbivorous. This diet shift {{has an effect on}} the green turtle's morphology. Green sea turtles have a <b>serrated</b> <b>jaw</b> that is used to eat sea grass and algae.|$|R
40|$|Mechanical {{testing of}} tendon and {{application}} of muscular tendon forces in cadaveric or animal studies {{requires the use of}} a clamp to hold the tendon rigidly at high loads without damaging it. Frozen type serrated clamp was able to achieve the objective but is less readily available and manageable because of its complex and massive configuration. In this study, a custom-made, <b>serrated</b> <b>jaw</b> clamp was fabricated. Maximum tension before visual slippage was monitored during tensile testing of a bovine tendon. The non-frozen <b>serrated</b> <b>jaw</b> clamp was able to sustain tension forces of more than 2500 N and strain of about 30 % without slippage and cutting of the tendon. The jaw clamp can be easily customised and fabricated for biomechanical studies to hold tendons of different sizes. The commercially available, serrated plastic material enables the jaw clamp to be custom-made with minimal workmanship and manufacturing time. Department of Health Technology and Informatic...|$|R
25|$|The diet {{of green}} turtles changes with age. Juveniles are carnivorous, {{but as they}} mature they become omnivorous. The young eat fish eggs, mollusks, jellyfish, small invertebrates, worms, sponges, algae, and crustaceans. Green sea turtles have a {{relatively}} slow growth rate because of the low nutritional value of their diet. Body fat turns green because of the consumed vegetation. This diet shift {{has an effect on}} the green turtle's skull morphology. Their <b>serrated</b> <b>jaw</b> helps them chew algae and sea grasses. Most adult sea turtles are strictly herbivorous.|$|R
50|$|Tongue-and-groove pliers—also {{known as}} water pump pliers, {{adjustable}} pliers, groove-joint pliers, arc-joint pliers, Multi-Grips, tap or pipe spanners, gland pliers and Channellocks—are {{a type of}} slip-joint pliers. They have <b>serrated</b> <b>jaws</b> generally set 45 to 60 degrees from the handles. The lower jaw can be moved {{to a number of}} positions by sliding along a tracking section under the upper jaw. An advantage of this design is that the pliers can adjust to a number of sizes without the distance in the handle growing wider. These pliers often have long handles—commonly 9.5 to 12 inches long—for increased leverage.|$|E
50|$|A {{common cause}} of {{brinelling}} {{is the use of}} improper installation procedures. Brinelling often occurs when pressing bearings into holes or onto shafts. Care must usually be taken to ensure that pressure is applied to the proper bearing race to avoid transferring the pressure from one race to the other through the balls or rollers. If pressing force is applied to the wrong race, brinelling can occur to either or both of the races. The act of pressing or clamping can also leave brinell marks, especially if the vise or press has <b>serrated</b> <b>jaws</b> or roughened surfaces. Flat pressing plates are often used in the pressing of bearings, while soft copper, brass, or aluminum jaw covers are often used in vises to help avoid brinell marks from being forced into the workpiece.|$|E
40|$|A {{hand-operated}} device for pulling cassava tubers {{out of the}} ground has been designed and manufactured by the Agricultural Mechanization Development Programme (AMDP) of the National Institute in the Philippines. The device weighs 2. 5 kilos (5 pounds) and is made of a 1. 3 metre long tubular pipe lever (about 1 inch diameter). This cassava lifter design is an adaptation from a similar device originally designed at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) in Nigena. To harvest a set of tubers, the operator inserts a self-locking pair of <b>serrated</b> <b>jaws</b> into the cassava stem at about 4 to 6 inches above the ground. The jaw locks itself automatically upon lifting because of the eccentricity of the system fixed on the pipe. The operator applies an upward shaking motion on the handle to loosen the soil until all the tubers are lifted.

40|$|Solitary uniloculated {{pancreatic}} cysts pose a major diagnostic dilemma. Cystic fluid {{carcinoembryonic antigen}} (CEA) concentration and cytology have low sensitivity in distinguishing mucinous from non-mucinous cysts [1], leading to frequent misdiagnoses and unnecessary surgical interventions [2]. Recently evaluated molecular markers seem very accurate, {{but they are}} not widely available in clinical practice [3]. We present the case of a 49 -year-old woman who was incidentally discovered to have a 25 -mm cystic pancreatic neck lesion, without apparent communication with the Wirsung duct ([Fig.   1], [Video 1]). At endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), the cyst had no septa, normal walls, and no mural nodules.

Download Endoscopic ultrasound-guided tissue acquisition from pancreatic cyst wall using a novel through-the-needle microforceps. Prophylactic intravenous antibiotics were administered and EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) was performed using a 19 -gauge needle. After 2  mL of fluid were aspirated, a toothed microforceps (Moray microforceps; US Endoscopy, Mentor, Ohio, USA) ([Fig.   2]), designed specifically for tissue acquisition through a 19 -gauge FNA needle, was inserted through the needle into the cyst cavity. Under EUS guidance, the microforceps was opened, pushed against the cyst wall, and then closed in order to obtain tissue samples ([Fig.   3]). Two bites of the cyst wall were taken using the biopsy microforceps, and the specimens were placed directly into formalin for histological examination. No procedural or delayed complications occurred.

This case clearly illustrates the diagnostic challenge of pancreatic cysts. The novel through-the-needle microforceps allowed the acquisition of tissue that showed all of the histological criteria needed for a diagnosis of mucinous non-neoplastic cyst [4]. These results allowed us to choose the most appropriate management for this patient, which, importantly, would have been different if based on CEA results alone. Mucinous non-neoplastic cysts are, in fact, benign conditions, without any malignant potential and for which both surgery and surveillance are not necessary...|$|E

40|$|Tadpoles of the {{monotypic}} Indian dancing frog family Micrixalidae {{have remained}} obscure for over 125 years. Here we report {{the discovery of}} the elusive tadpoles of Micrixalus herrei from the sand beds of a forested stream in southern Western Ghats, and confirm their identity through DNA barcoding. These actively burrowing tadpoles lead an entirely fossorial life from eggs to late metamorphic stages. We describe their internal and external morphological characters while highlighting the following features: eel-like appearance, extensively muscularized body and tail, reduced tail fins, skin-covered eyes, delayed development of eye pigmentation in early pre-metamorphic stages (Gosner stages 25 - 29), prominent tubular sinistral spiracle, large transverse processes on vertebrae II and III, ankylosed ribs on transverse processes of vertebra II, notochord terminating before the atlantal cotyle-occipital condyle junction, absence of keratodonts, <b>serrated</b> well-formed <b>jaw</b> sheaths, and extensive calcified endolymphatic sacs reaching sacrum posteriorly. The tadpole gut contains mostly fine sediments and sand. We discuss the eel-like morphology and feeding habits of M. herrei in the context of convergence with other well-known fossorial tadpoles. This discovery builds the knowledge base for further comparative analyses and conservation of Micrixalus, an ancient and endemic lineage of Indian frogs...|$|R
