25|$|This {{vision of}} a collegiate {{university}} has increasingly fallen away. The funding for colleges did not {{keep pace with the}} growth in student numbers, with the result that only four colleges were built. In later years when there was heavy student demand for scarce accommodation in Canterbury the solution was found in building additional on-campus accommodation but not in the form of further colleges. The hopes that students living off campus would <b>stay</b> <b>around</b> to eat dinner in their colleges were not met, whilst the abolition of college amenities fees removed students' direct stake in their colleges. With the growth of specialist subject departments as well as of other university wide facilities, {{more and more of the}} role of colleges was transferred to the central university.

25|$|The larval {{life history}} of E. junaluska {{is still not}} very well known. Studies have found the {{breeding}} season is spread from fall to early spring. The larval period reportedly lasts around two to three years, and metamorphosis occurs during the summer months. Eggs are laid in the streams and are attached under media such as large rocks. The depth of the eggs laid range from 6–20cm. The adult salamanders <b>stay</b> <b>around</b> where the eggs are laid to protect the egg clutch. Clutch sizes range from 30 to 50 eggs. The larvae are completely aquatic until they metamorphose into adults. The larvae can easily be distinguished as other Eurycea species, so {{it is important to}} distinguish them correctly. A successful method of discovering the larvae is by using leaf mats placed in the streams underneath or near rocks. This allowed surveyors to receive data on the egg clutches and adult salamanders.|$|E

2500|$|Derived {{from the}} {{traditional}} Western and honky tonk musical styles of the late 1950s and 1960s, including Ray Price (whose band, the [...] "Cherokee Cowboys", included Willie Nelson and Roger Miller) and mixed with the anger of an alienated subculture of the nation during the period, outlaw country revolutionized the genre of country music. [...] "After I left Nashville (the early 70s), I wanted to relax and play the music that I wanted to play, and just <b>stay</b> <b>around</b> Texas, maybe Oklahoma.

[...] (Willie Nelson) The term outlaw country is traditionally associated with Willie Nelson, Jerry Jeff Walker, Hank Williams, Jr., Merle Haggard, Waylon Jennings, Joe Ely, Steve Young, David Allan Coe, Whitey Morgan and the 78's, John Prine, Billy Joe Shaver, Gary Stewart, Townes Van Zandt, Kris Kristofferson, Michael Martin Murphey, Tompall Glaster, Steve Earle, and the later career renaissance of Johnny Cash, with a few female vocalists such as Jessi Colter, Sammi Smith, Tanya Tucker and Rosanne Cash.

However, before leaving Healy told the band that they should send the demo to Charlie Pinder of Sony Music Publishing, who they had known for a few years and regularly sent songs to, saying: [...] "If he's not into it, then we'll go." [...] Pinder was immediately impressed by the song [...] "All I Want to Do is Rock", which he felt was a dramatic change for the band: [...] "It was harder, more exciting, sexy; all things that they never really were. They turned a corner." [...] After performing a secret gig for Pinder and his boss at Sony, Blair McDonald, they were signed to Sony Music Publishing. The immediate impact of what was a very secret deal was that the line-up was changed—keyboard player Geoff Martyn was removed, and the bassist, Geoff's brother Chris, was replaced with Healy's best friend Dougie Payne—and the band was moved to London, where they were given a rehearsal room and a house.|$|E
