Advancements in clockworks and timekeeping included the mechanical gear systems of Zhang Heng (78–139) and Ma Jun (fl. 3rd century) gave the Tang engineer, astronomer, and monk Yi Xing (683–727) inspiration when he invented the world's first clockwork escapement mechanism in 725. This was used alongside a clepsydra clock and waterwheel to power a rotating armillary sphere in representation of astronomical observation. Yi Xing's device {{also had a}} mechanically timed bell that was struck automatically every hour, and a drum that was struck automatically every quarter-hour; essentially, a striking clock. Yi Xing's astronomical clock and water-powered armillary sphere became well known throughout the country, since students attempting to pass the imperial examinations by 730 had to write an essay on the device as an exam requirement. However, {{the most common type}} of public and palace timekeeping device was the inflow clepsydra. Its design was improved c. 610 by the Sui-dynasty engineers Geng Xun and Yuwen Kai. They provided a steelyard balance that allowed <b>seasonal</b> <b>adjustment</b> in the pressure head of the compensating tank and could then control the rate of flow for different lengths of day and night.|$|E

The study determined the optimum monthly tilt angles of PV solar panels and the <b>seasonal</b> <b>adjustments</b> needed for the panels in order to collect maximum solar radiation throughout the year.

40|$|This study {{presents}} a seven-step algorithm for hourly setpoint calculation of museums' indoor temperature (Ti) and relative humidity (RHi) integrating collection requirements (ASHRAE) and thermal comfort requirements. Moreover, building energy simulation results {{provide insight into}} the energy impact of five levels of museum indoor climate conditioning applied to four building quality levels (ranging from a historical building to a purpose-built museum building) using weather data from twenty locations throughout Europe. The five levels of indoor climate conditioning were calculated using the presented setpoint algorithm, a validated simulation model of museum Hermitage Amsterdam was adjusted to represent the four building quality levels, and technical-reference-year (TRY) weather data of twenty locations were used. The conclusions: The setpoint algorithm enables smooth control of <b>seasonal</b> <b>adjustments,</b> integrated with permissible short fluctuations of T and RH (according to ASHRAE classes); improving the building quality quickly follows the law of diminishing returns; supposing to result in the same collection risk, subclass Ad (no <b>seasonal</b> <b>adjustments,</b> but larger hourly fluctuations) is more energy efficient than subclass As (with <b>seasonal</b> <b>adjustments,</b> but smaller hourly fluctuations) for most locations; although class AA is more stringent than subclass As, class AA appears to require less energy than subclass As for some locations, due to efficiency differences of the humidification and dehumidification processes...|$|R
