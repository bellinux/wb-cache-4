In late 2012 Voyager 1 recorded a marked increase in cosmic ray collisions and a sharp drop in lower energy particles from the solar wind, which suggested that the probe had passed through the heliopause and entered the interstellar medium.|$|E
25|$|A common {{analogy is}} the sonic boom of a {{supersonic}} aircraft or bullet. The sound waves {{generated by the}} supersonic body propagate {{at the speed of}} sound itself; as such, the waves travel slower than the speeding object and cannot propagate forward from the body, instead forming a <b>shock</b> <b>front.</b> In a similar way, a charged particle can generate a light shock wave as it travels through an insulator.|$|E
25|$|These {{devices have}} been studied, and {{reviewed}} by Raman. Here we look primarily at the Hartmann whistle. The shock {{cells of the}} jet interact with the shock {{in front of the}} cavity (the flow in the cavity being subsonic). Small symmetric disturbances in the jet stream are amplified as they proceed toward the cavity (similar in some respects to the hole tone) causing the shock in front of the cavity to oscillate. The <b>shock</b> <b>front</b> acts much like a piston source of high energy resulting in a monopole-like sound field. Again the volumetric flow is directional unlike the theoretical monopole.|$|E

COS is based on solving a conservation law for modeling convection, a heat type equation for modeling diffusion, and finally a certain "residual" conservation law for necessary correction.

The most dynamic feature in the inner part of the nebula is the point where the pulsar's equatorial wind slams into the bulk of the nebula, forming a <b>shock</b> <b>front.</b> The shape and position of this feature shifts rapidly, with the equatorial wind appearing as a series of wisp-like features that steepen, brighten, then fade as they move away from the pulsar to well out into {{the main body of the}} nebula.|$|E
500|$|The XB-70 used {{compression}} lift, which {{arose from}} a shock wave {{generated by the}} sharp {{leading edge of the}} central engine intake splitter plate below the wing. [...] At Mach 3 cruising speed, the shock wave attached along the wing leading edge, preventing the high pressure behind the <b>shock</b> <b>front</b> from leaking up over the wing. The compression lift provided five percent of the total lift. The wing included inboard camber to more effectively use the higher pressure field behind the strong shock wave. Unique among aircraft of its size, the outer portions of the wings were hinged, and could be pivoted downward by up to 65 degrees, acting almost as a type of variable-geometry wingtip device. This increased the aircraft's directional stability at supersonic speeds, shifted the center of lift to a more favorable position at high speeds, and strengthened the compression lift effect. With the wingtips drooped downwards, the compression lift shock wave would be further trapped under the wings.|$|E

50|$|Inside the {{radiative}} fireball {{the bomb}} itself is rapidly expanding {{due to the}} heat generated by the nuclear reactions. This moves outward at supersonic speeds, creating a hydrodynamic shock wave at its outer edge. After a brief period this <b>shock</b> <b>front</b> reaches and then passes the initial radiative fireball. The shock wave contains so much energy that the compression heating it causes in the air causes it to glow.

40|$|It is only now, with low-frequency radio telescopes, long {{exposures}} with high-resolution X-ray {{satellites and}} gamma-ray telescopes, {{that we are}} beginning to learn about the physics in the periphery of galaxy clusters. In the coming years, Sunyaev-Zeldovich telescopes are going to deliver further great insights into the plasma physics of these special regions in the Universe. The last years have already shown tremendous progress with detections of shocks, estimates of magnetic field strengths and constraints on the particle acceleration efficiency. X-ray observations have revealed <b>shock</b> <b>fronts</b> in cluster outskirts which have allowed inferences about the microphysical structure of <b>shocks</b> <b>fronts</b> in such extreme environments. The best indications for magnetic fields and relativistic particles in cluster outskirts come from observations of so-called radio relics, which are megaparsec-sized regions of radio emission from the edges of galaxy clusters. As these are difficult to detect due to their low surface brightness, only few of these objects are known. But they have provided unprecedented evidence for the acceleration of relativistic particles at <b>shock</b> <b>fronts</b> and the existence of muG strength fields as far out as the virial radius of clusters.

40|$|Theoretical {{studies of}} the {{physical}} processes in clusters of galaxies are mainly {{based on the results}} of numerical simulations, which in turn are often directly compared to X-ray observations. Although trivial in principle, these comparisons are not always simple. We show that the projected spectroscopic temperature of clusters obtained from X-ray observations is always lower than the emission-weighed temperature. This bias is related to the fact that the emission-weighted temperature does not reflect the actual spectral properties of the observed source. This has implications for the study of thermal structures in clusters, especially when strong temperature gradients, like <b>shock</b> <b>fronts,</b> are present. In real observations <b>shock</b> <b>fronts</b> appear much weaker than what is predicted by emission-weighted temperature maps. We propose a new formula, the spectroscopic-like temperature function that better approximates the spectroscopic temperature, making simulations more directly comparable to observation...|$|R

It is shown that, when the poloidal flow is such {{to produce a}} properly defined Mach number of order unity somewhere on the flux surface, <b>shock</b> <b>fronts</b> can form.

50|$|A Blast Wave Phenomenon is an {{incident}} involving the violent {{release of energy}} created by detonation of an explosive device. The sudden and intense pressure disturbance is termed the “blast wave.” The blast wave is characterized by an almost instantaneous rise from ambient pressure to a peak incident pressure (Pi). This pressure increase or “shock front,” travels radially outward from the detonation point, with a diminishing velocity that is always {{in excess of the}} speed of sound in that medium. Gas molecules making up the front move at lower velocities. This velocity, which is called the “particle velocity,” is associated with the “dynamic pressure,” or the pressure formed by the winds produced by the <b>shock</b> <b>front.</b> As the <b>shock</b> <b>front</b> expands into increasingly larger volumes of the medium, the incident pressure decreases and, generally, the duration of the pressure-pulse increase. If the shock wave strikes a rigid surface (e.g., a building) at an angle to the direction of the wave’s propagation, a reflected pressure is instantly developed on the surface and this pressure rises to a value that exceeds the incident pressure. This reflected pressure {{is a function of the}} incident wave’s pressure and the angle formed between the rigid surface and the plane of the <b>shock</b> <b>front.</b>|$|E
