The Tender and Repair Ship <b>Load</b> <b>List</b> for these ships (AD/AR TARSLL) designates the range (number) and depth (quantity) of repair parts to be carried to support this industrial mission. This thesis details the logical reasoning and mathematical theory used to develop the 1977 AD/AR TARSLL, including {{an analysis of the}} data development, the mathematical inventory model and procedures used, and various assumptions and constraints applied during the process. Actual demand history for the six AD/AR 1 s in the Atlantic fleet for a two year period from 1977 to 1979 was used {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the <b>load</b> <b>list.</b> The effects of certain assumptions in the model on the <b>load</b> <b>list</b> were analyzed. The proposed changes for the 1980 TARSLL were incorporated in the 1977 TARSLL and evaluated. Also, alternative models and methods of <b>load</b> <b>list</b> development were proposed and evaluated.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedPresently, aircraft carriers on deployment request Fleet Issue <b>Load</b> <b>List</b> (FILL) material from supporting AFS ships on a "Fill or Kill" basis. If {{the material is}} available on the AFS, it is issued and delivered to the aircraft carrier during the next underway replenishment (UNREP). If the requested material is not-in-stock (NIS) the requisition is cancelled by the AFS. The aircraft carrier is notified of requisition cancellations during the underway replenishment. The aircraft carrier then cancels the outstanding requisition on its own inventory system, and reorders the material at the next scheduled underway replenishment or from an appropriate Naval Supply Center. This thesis suggests a procedure for an AFS to automatically forward cancelled aircraft carrier requisitions for Fleet Issue <b>Load</b> <b>List</b> material to a Navy Supply Center. During the study information was obtained from several on-site visits to an AFS and an in-depth review of current guidelines and procedures for AFS supply support and aircraft carrier requisitioning procedures. The procedure developed provides the AFS with a method for passing aircraft carrier requisitions for not-in-stock Fleet Issue <b>Load</b> <b>List</b> material, reducing requisition lead-time and aircraft carrier administrative work-load. Additional research is required to evaluate specific implementation problems and actual cost savings. [URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|R
