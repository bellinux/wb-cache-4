5|$|Giovanni Ribisi as Dex, ace {{mechanic}} of the Flying Legion. Ribisi {{met with}} Avnet and, initially, was not <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{wanted to do}} the movie but after seeing the teaser trailer, he signed on without hesitation.|$|E
5|$|Avici/Avicimat (waterless/waveless): A person, who lies on oath or in business, is {{repeatedly}} thrown head-first from a 100 yojana {{high mountain}} whose sides are stone waves, but without water. His body is continuously broken, {{but it is}} made <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> does not die.|$|E
5|$|Tracy {{is still}} {{struggling}} with his marriage to Angie, who had thrown him out of their family home. Later in this episode, the pair reconcile, but only if Tracy allows for Angie to follow him to make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> isn't having an affair.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing venture nothing have! Besides, {{you make}} <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> honourable before you begin. You'd be safe enough with yours. I wish I had the chance! Lots of girls do it; {{or do you}} think they'd get married at all?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look ye here, Girdlestone," [...] he said, as {{the latter}} stood looking sulkily {{up and down the}} street. [...] "You should learn a lesson from this. Never attack a man unless you're <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> unarmed. You may git shot, if you do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I must {{explain to}} you. Sir Lionel does {{come to see}} me very often; and I should think there was {{something}} in it--or, rather, I shouldn't be surprised at others thinking so--only that I am quite <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> thinking of somebody else." ...|$|R
5|$|Balard found bromine {{chemicals}} in the ash of seaweed from the salt marshes of Montpellier. The seaweed was used to produce iodine, but also contained bromine. Balard distilled the bromine from a solution of seaweed ash saturated with chlorine. The properties of the resulting substance were intermediate between those of chlorine and iodine; thus he tried {{to prove that the}} substance was iodine monochloride (ICl), but after failing to do so he was <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had found a new element, and named it muride, derived from the Latin word muria for brine.|$|E
5|$|Day {{wished for}} the girls to be {{isolated}} from external influences while he educated them so, {{at the beginning of}} November 1769, he decided to move them to France. It is also possible that he did this to protect himself from the legal ramifications of his experiment, as well as societal gossip. The trio travelled over 600 miles to Avignon, renting a house in le quartier des fusteries. The girls could speak no French and Day employed no English-speaking servants, to be <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would be the only person to influence them.|$|E
5|$|Aerox at Destructoid {{said that}} the game {{inherits}} issues from previous Ace Attorney games, such as how evidence sometimes can only be presented when the game's script allows it, and how it sometimes is unclear how to trigger events during investigations; he did however note that these occur less frequently than in previous Ace Attorney games. Osborn criticized the cross-examinations, saying that objections that should logically be valid are sometimes not accepted by the game, and that the player often has to resort to trial and error. Meanwhile, Bryan Vore at Game Informer {{said that the}} in-game task list and new way of traveling made <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> never felt lost during investigations, and {{knew what to do}} to proceed. Urara Honma at Famitsu also noted the hints and lower difficulty as helpful features.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{continued}} Soames, [...] "that's a {{very expensive}} business. Your grandfather isn't likely to consent to it unless <b>he</b> can make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> not got any other drain on him." [...] And he paused {{to see whether the}} boy understood his meaning.|$|R
6000|$|When she saw <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was {{a little}} cast down by it, she began to {{encourage}} him. [...] "He's just a common, ignorant man, and probably didn't know how to express himself. You may be perfectly <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> delighted {{with the success of}} the magazine, and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> understands as well as you do <b>that</b> <b>he</b> owes it all to you." ...|$|R
60|$|LIEUTENANT. I don't feel so <b>sure</b> about <b>that.</b> <b>He's</b> {{capable of}} anything.|$|R
5|$|I am {{at first}} {{inclined}} to agree... But on re-reading the whole Ode, this line {{strikes me as}} a serious blemish on a beautiful poem, and the reason must be either that I fail to understand it, or that it is a statement which is untrue. And I suppose that Keats meant something by it, however remote his truth and his beauty may have been from these words in ordinary use. And I am <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would have repudiated any explanation of the line which called it a pseudo-statement... The statement of Keats seems to me meaningless: or perhaps {{the fact that it is}} grammatically meaningless conceals another meaning from me.|$|E
5|$|Although Bucer {{assisted}} {{in the development of}} the English Reformation, he was still quite concerned about the speed of its progress. Both Bucer and Fagius had noticed that the 1549 Prayer Book was not a remarkable step forward, although Cranmer assured Bucer that it was only a first step and that its initial form was only temporary. However, by the winter 1550, Bucer was becoming disillusioned. Cranmer, however, made <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did not feel alienated and kept in close touch with him. This attention paid off during the vestments controversy. This incident was initiated by John Hooper, a follower of Heinrich Bullinger who had recently returned from Zürich. Hooper was unhappy with Cranmer's Prayer Book and Ordinal and he particularly objected to the use of ceremonies and vestments. When the Privy Council selected him to be the Bishop of Gloucester on 15 May 1550, he laid down conditions that he would not wear the required vestments. He found an ally among the Continental reformers in Jan Łaski who had become a leader of the Stranger church in London, a designated place of worship for Continental Protestant refugees. His church's forms and practices had taken reforms much further than Cranmer would have liked. However, Bucer and Peter Martyr, while they sympathised with Hooper's position, supported Cranmer's arguments of timing and authority. Cranmer and Ridley stood their ground. This led to Hooper's imprisonment and he eventually gave in. He was consecrated on 8 March 1551 according to the Ordinal and he preached before the king in his episcopal garments. Cranmer's vision of reform through careful steps under the authority of the government was maintained.|$|E
5|$|The P-40s {{were better}} armored and faster {{in level flight}} than the Japanese fighters they were up against, mostly Mitsubishi A6M Zeroes, and could outdive them. On the other hand, the Japanese fighters had greater range, could outclimb the P-40, and were far more maneuverable. For an American P-40 pilot, risking a dogfight with a Japanese fighter was {{practically}} suicidal. Wurtsmith attempted to develop tactics that would exploit {{the strengths of the}} P-40 and minimize its weaknesses. The two-plane element was fixed as the chief unit of combat, and individual dogfighting was strictly prohibited. The P-40s would attempt to dive into a Japanese formation, attack, and then continue diving at a speed the Japanese fighters could not match. Above all, Wurtsmith attempted to make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had enough P-40s in commission to outnumber the Japanese. The efforts of the ground crews and service troops made this possible. By May 1942, he had lost seven P-40s and three pilots while claiming the destruction of 38 Japanese aircraft. The heaviest Japanese attack had been by nine fighters and 24 bombers, which Wurtsmith had met with 50 P-40s; the P-40 pilots claimed 11 Japanese aircraft shot down. May was the first month that passed without a raid since January but the Japanese returned on four consecutive days in June, with three of these raids consisting of 18 to 20 fighters and 27 bombers. That month nine P-40s and 13 Japanese aircraft were lost. Wurtsmith was promoted to colonel on 6 July 1942. Between March 1942 and January 1943, his fighters claimed to have downed 78 enemy aircraft.|$|E
6000|$|... "A boar!" [...] said Bladud, {{in a low}} whisper, as he unslung his bow. [...] "Come, now, it {{will take}} all our united force to slay that brute, for, if I have not lost my power of judging such game, I'm pretty <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> a very big old boar with {{formidable}} tusks." ...|$|R
50|$|Ivan {{studies the}} Book for a year. He has fallen for Katia and misses her terribly. But the fat landlady Clava {{wants to marry}} him, being <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> her rescuer. Moreover, the Stone Countess orders Katia to marry Iangul (who {{genuinely}} loves the girl). As for Ivan's ugly fiancee, she also has an admirer - Ivan's friend Cusma, a blacksmith.|$|R
60|$|Kurt was <b>sure</b> now <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{recognized}} Glidden's voice. Excitement {{and anger}} then gave place to deadly rage.|$|R
5|$|The {{termination}} of the operation caught the CIA by surprise, and King quickly attempted to salvage what he could. The freighter was redirected to Panama, where the arms were unloaded; King kept the weapons there {{in the hope that}} the project could be rejuvenated. Castillo Armas was paid a retainer of $3000 a week, which allowed him to maintain a small force. The CIA remained in contact with him, and continued to provide support to the rebels. The CIA found it difficult to end the operation without drawing attention to it. Peréz Jimenez opened a line of credit that would allow Castillo Armas to purchase airplanes, and Trujillo and Somoza continued to support the operation, although they acknowledged that it would have to be postponed. The money paid to Castillo Armas has been described as a way of making <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did not attempt any premature action. Even after the operation had been terminated, the CIA received reports from Seekford that the Guatemalan rebels were planning assassinations. Castillo Armas made plans to use groups of soldiers in civilian clothing from Nicaragua, Honduras, and El Salvador to kill communist leaders in Guatemala. King continued to explore the CIA's ability to move arms around Central America without the approval of the State Department.|$|E
25|$|Marshall's {{remains were}} buried {{on the field}} at Gettysburg. It is assumed, but not known for <b>sure,</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was re-interred at Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia.|$|E
25|$|Appa still accompanies Aang and {{his group}} even after they enter the Fire Nation. However, {{in order to make}} <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> does not give away Aang's {{identity}} when flying, Aang covers Appa with clouds as a disguise while in flight.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> felt <b>sure</b> now <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was overtaken, and {{determined}} to keep his eyes and faculties thoroughly on watch.|$|R
60|$|At {{the same}} time, <b>he</b> felt <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> had <b>he</b> {{been in the}} prince's place any royal father might have been glad to own him.|$|R
60|$|Richard {{shook his}} head, not quite satisfied, but not <b>sure</b> enough <b>that</b> <b>he</b> entered into her meaning to {{question}} it.|$|R
25|$|Barrientos {{went so far}} as to make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was {{descended from}} {{converted}} Jews. However, the research's aim was to establish himself as an old Christian, with the goal of using this evidence to strengthen his ideological position: to defend converted Jews, but to attack unconverted Jews.|$|E
25|$|Ose {{has been}} Tobei's handler for 100 years. He was {{originally}} an angel. He was ordered by Lady Ema to follow Tobei {{in the human}} world as a dog to make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> doesn't disrupt {{the order of the}} natural world. He is often mistaken by other people as Tobei's pet.|$|E
25|$|Stegall {{said that}} he was 99.9% <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was going to retire after then 2007 season but on January 31, 2008, {{announced}} he was returning to the Bombers for another year. (He also signed for an option year in 2009) Stegall has attributed his long and consistent career to a strict work out.|$|E
60|$|You may be <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> after <b>he</b> {{had read}} these words {{he was not}} long in {{breaking}} open {{the lid of the}} box with his spade.|$|R
5000|$|George Crerar said of Telfer [...] "The {{great thing}} about Jim Telfer is <b>that</b> <b>he</b> makes <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> if <b>he</b> isnt {{going to win the}} ball the other side wont get it either." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The man's by way {{of being}} {{a friend of mine}} and took you into his house when you were in some danger of {{bleeding}} to death. I'm not <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> guilty, and now I've come with you, am going to see he gets fair play; but if you can prove your charge, you may do what you like with him. I think we'll let it go at that." ...|$|R
25|$|The Goths {{were also}} {{watching}} the Romans, and on 8 August Fritigern sent an emissary {{to propose a}} peace and an alliance in exchange for some Roman territory. <b>Sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would be victorious due to his supposed numerical superiority, Valens rejected these proposals. However, his estimates did not take into consideration {{a part of the}} Gothic cavalry that had gone to forage further away.|$|E
25|$|Obtaining a {{monopoly}} {{for the production}} and/or sale of matches in return for loans to governments was, in its essence, not {{a new way of}} doing business. Such schemes had {{been around for a long}} time (e.g. the Mississippi Bubble of John Law, and the South Sea Bubble) but Keuger was very creative inventing new ways of financing business, while making <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> kept control of his companies.|$|E
25|$|On March 6, 1939, {{she flew}} out of Spain under enemy naval fire to the major Algerian port city of Oran then under French sovereignty. Her arrival came as a {{surprise}} to the authorities, who hurriedly put her aboard a liner bound for Marseille. The ship's captain was a Nationalist sympathizer, but a clandestine Communist cell aboard ship made <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did not steer the ship toward Nationalist-held Barcelona. This was the third time that Ibárruri had evaded capture by the Nationalist.|$|E
60|$|He {{nodded his}} head at me with the most {{complete}} bright confidence, quite <b>sure</b> now <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had settled his case perfectly.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Are you quite <b>sure</b> of <b>that?</b> <b>He</b> deserted her, I {{think you}} said. If you could {{establish}} that, or prove a conviction against him--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Syme, [...] "if <b>he's</b> <b>that</b> {{particular}} kind of old gentleman, if you're quite <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> a large and fat old gentleman in grey clothes, you may {{take my word for}} it that the elephant has not run away with him. He has run away with the elephant. The elephant is not made by God that could run away with him if he did not consent to the elopement. And, by thunder, there he is!" ...|$|R
