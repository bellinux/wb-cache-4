5|$|In general, {{researchers}} in the field focus on development of cognitive flexibility {{between the ages of}} three and five. However, cognitive flexibility {{has been shown to be}} a broad concept that can be studied with all different ages and situations. Thus, with tasks ranging from simple to more complex, research <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a developmental continuum that spans from infancy to adulthood.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{feminism}} {{challenges the}} essentialist view of gender as biologically intrinsic. For example, Anne Fausto-Sterling's book, Myths of Gender, explores the assumptions embodied in scientific research that support a biologically essentialist view of gender. In Delusions of Gender, Cordelia Fine disputes {{scientific evidence that}} <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> an innate biological difference between men's and women's minds, asserting instead that cultural and societal beliefs are the reason for differences between individuals that are commonly perceived as sex differences.|$|E
5|$|Our {{understanding}} of the universe back to very early times <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a past horizon, though in practice our view is also limited by the opacity of the universe at early times. So our view cannot extend further backward in time, though the horizon recedes in space. If {{the expansion of the}} universe continues to accelerate, there is a future horizon as well.|$|E

5|$|As {{children}} get older their rate of vocabulary growth increases. Children probably understand their first 50 words before they produce them. By {{the age of}} eighteen months, children typically attain a vocabulary of 50 words in production, and between two and three times greater in comprehension. A switch from {{an early stage of}} slow vocabulary growth to a later stage of faster growth {{is referred to as the}} vocabulary spurt. Young toddlers acquire one to three words per month. A vocabulary spurt often occurs over time as the number of words learned accelerates. It is believed that most children add about 10 to 20 new words a week. Between the ages of 18 to 24 months, children learn how to combine two words such as no bye-bye and more please. Three-word and four-word combinations appear when most of the child's utterances are two-word productions. In addition, children are able to form conjoined sentences, using and. This <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a vocabulary spurt between the time that the child's first word appears, and when the child is able to form more than two words, and eventually, sentences. However, there have been arguments as to whether or not there is a spurt in acquisition of words. Only about one in five children do have a spurt. This suggests that most children do not have a vocabulary spurt.|$|E
5|$|Treatment of TB uses {{antibiotics}} to {{kill the}} bacteria. Effective TB treatment is difficult, due to the unusual structure and chemical composition of the mycobacterial cell wall, which hinders the entry of drugs and makes many antibiotics ineffective. The two antibiotics most commonly used are isoniazid and rifampicin, and treatments can be prolonged, taking several months. Latent TB treatment usually employs a single antibiotic, while active TB disease is best treated with combinations of several antibiotics {{to reduce the risk}} of the bacteria developing antibiotic resistance. People with latent infections are also treated to prevent them from progressing to active TB disease later in life. Directly observed therapy, i.e., having a health care provider watch the person take their medications, is recommended by the WHO in an effort to reduce the number of people not appropriately taking antibiotics. The evidence to support this practice over people simply taking their medications independently is of poor quality. There is no strong evidence indicating that directly observed therapy improves the number of people who were cured or the number of people who complete their medicine. Moderate quality evidence <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> also no difference if people are observed at home versus at a clinic, or by a family member versus a health care worker. Methods to remind people of the importance of treatment and appointments may result in a small but important improvement.|$|E

50|$|Among the Stoics, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> much {{discussion}} concerning {{the number of}} virtues {{and parts of the}} soul.

On the parts of the soul Plato divided it into two parts; Zeno into three; Panaetius into five or six; Soranus into seven; Chrysippus into as many as eight; Apollophanes into as many as nine; while other Stoics declared as many as twelve parts in the soul.|$|R
25|$|Similar {{notions that}} suggest animals—like fish, for example—feel less pain are brought forth {{today as a}} {{justification}} for animal cruelty.

25|$|The {{desirability}} of custom templates for non-compact group is {{in conflict with}} the principle of learning invariant representations. However, for certain kinds of regularly encountered image transformations, templates might be the result of evolutionary adaptations.
