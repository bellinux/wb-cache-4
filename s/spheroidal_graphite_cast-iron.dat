A “full model” is first proposed to correctly reproduce the alloy behaviour even for very small strain levels. A “light model” with a bit poorer experimental agreement but a simpler formulation is also proposed. These macroscopic models, whose equations are based on physical phenomena observed at the dislocation scale, are able to cope with the various load conditions tested – progressive straining and cyclic hardening tests – and to correctly describe anisothermal evolution. The accuracy of these two models and the experimental databases to which they are linked is estimated on different types of experimental tests and compared with the accuracy of more standard Chaboche-type constitutive models. Each test leads to the superiority of the “full model”, particularly for slow strain rates regimes. After developing a material user subroutine, FEM simulations are performed on Abaqus for a car engine exhaust manifold and confirm the good results obtained from the experimental basis. We obtain more accurate results than those given by more traditional laws. A very good correlation is observed between the simulations and the engine bench tests...|$|E

Two groups of parent alloys were prepared using high purity materials, i. e., Group 1 containing the spheroidizing element of Ce, Mg or Ca, while in Group 2, S was added as an anti-spheroidizing element. For discussing {{the influence of the}} cooling rate on the graphite morphology, 0. 5 g of the Group 1 samples were melted and held for 15 minutes at 1673 K in an Ar atmosphere, then cooled at 1000 K/min or 20 K/min. The results showed that perfect <b>spheroidal</b> <b>graphite</b> could not be confirmed, while irregular graphite appeared. The atmosphere was changed to Ar+ 3 %H 2 for preventing the oxidation, and the holding time was reduced to 10 minutes to prevent fading of the spheroidizing element.

Nevertheless, at the cooling rate of 20 K/min, graphite morphology was only chunky or flake in both groups. In order to investigate which parameter is more important for the formation of <b>spheroidal</b> <b>graphite,</b> the atmosphere and the holding time were independently changed at the cooling rate of 1000 K/min.
