This was presentation 16.6 of this IEDM meeting. To Bower and to the attorneys who litigated the Bower U.S. 3,472,712 patent it was determined in the courts that his patent covered the general principal of using a gate as mask for both metal and polysilicon gates using ion implantation to establish the source and drain regions. Bower does not acknowledge the statement [...] "Although Bower believed he was first in using aluminum as the gate and later developed the device using polysilicon as the gate, he was unable to prove it to the courts and the patent was awarded to Kerwin, Klein, and Sarace (U.S. 3,475,234)" [...] is true. Actually it was the Hans G. Dill patent U.S. 3,544,3999, filed on October 26, 1966 that described the formation of the polysilicon gate self-aligned gate FET using diffusion of the source and drain that was disputed by the Kerwin et al. patent, not the Bower patent.

The doped <b>source-drain</b> contact CNTFETs outperform the Schottky contact devices with and without strain applied. The off-state current in both types of contact is similar with and without strain applied. This is because both types of contact offer very similar potential barrier in off-state. However, the on-state current in doped contact devices is much higher due to better modulation of on-state potential profile, and its variation with strain is sensitive to the device contact type. The on/off current ratio and the inverse subthreshold slope are better with doped <b>source-drain</b> contact, and their variations with strain are relatively less sensitive to the device contact type.
