After one of his men had injured his leg, Brahe decided to return to Menindee, but before leaving buried some provisions in case Burke did return, and blazed (cut or carved) a message on a tree to mark the spot.|$|E
25|$|After {{the fourth}} show, Charlie Dominici {{was let go}} because the band was <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> the {{limitations}} of his voice based upon the vocal style they wanted. The band {{was looking for a}} singer with a style more like Bruce Dickinson or Geoff Tate, and Dominici's stage presence was not what they wanted for a front man. Shortly after, however, the band Marillion asked Dream Theater to open for them at a gig at the Ritz in New York, so Dominici was given the opportunity to perform one last time. It would be another two years before Dream Theater had a replacement vocalist.|$|E

Byrne's take on the undersea antihero Namor cast him {{as the head of}} a surface company, Oracle, Inc., in order to help keep the ocean unpolluted, and had Namor {{involved}} in corporate intrigue. After writing and drawing the book for 25 issues, Byrne told editor Terry Kavanagh that he was <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> constrained on the book and thought having a different artist might inspire him to a fresh approach. Kavanagh suggested newcomer Jae Lee, and Byrne continued as strictly writer of the book up through issue #32. Byrne later said he has great fondness for the title character and was unhappy that circumstances forced him to leave the series.|$|E

Just as they discuss their honeymoon, Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis) calls round to tell the couple that the ballroom at Lassister's Hotel has raw sewage running through it and the kitchen is out of order. Toadie asks Paul how they can have the reception there and Paul tells them that he has arranged a marquee for them in the hotel's grounds.

[...] The {{original}} release of The Marble Index included eight of 12 songs Nico recorded. [...] "Roses in the Snow", [...] "Nibelungen", [...] "Sagen die Gelehrten" [...] and [...] "Reve Reveiller" [...] were left off the album. The finished album was barely 30 minutes long, which [...] "was as much apparently as Frazier Mohawk, mixing and sequencing it, could stand without <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> suicidal".|$|E
500|$|The Huffington Post editor Laura Prudom and TV Fanatic's C. Orlando also {{highlighted}} Carlyle's {{acting and}} storyline. Prudom liked Dourif's casting, but singled out praise for Mary Margaret and David's poster scene, calling it [...] "beautifully written and played, understated {{and filled with}} longing." [...] The A.V. Clubs Oliver Sava was more critical of the episode, and graded [...] "Desperate Souls" [...] with a C. He remarked that Once Upon a Time [...] "lacks Losts sophistication and insight, instead laying out plot in the plainest terms possible, no matter how tedious that may be... It hasn’t even been ten episodes, and the formula is already <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> stale." [...] Despite this, Sava saw potential for the series, noting that [...] "the writers just need to take fuller advantage of the wealth of mythology that the fairy tale stories give them." ...|$|E
500|$|Early episodes based much {{of their}} comedy on Stewie's [...] "super villain" [...] antics, such as his {{constant}} plans for total world domination, his evil experiments, plans and inventions {{to get rid of}} things he dislikes, and his constant attempts at matricide. As the series progressed, the writers and MacFarlane agreed that his personality and the jokes were <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> dated, so they began writing him with a different personality. Family Guy often includes self-referential humor. The most common form is jokes about Fox Broadcasting, and occasions where the characters break the fourth wall by addressing the audience. For example, in [...] "North by North Quahog", the first episode that aired after the show's revival, included Peter telling the family that they had been cancelled because Fox had to make room in their schedule for shows like Dark Angel, Titus, Undeclared, Action, That '80s Show, Wonderfalls, Fastlane, Andy Richter Controls the Universe, Skin, Girls Club, Cracking Up, The Pitts, Firefly, Get Real, Freakylinks, Wanda at Large, Costello, The Lone Gunmen, A Minute with Stan Hooper, Normal, Ohio, Pasadena, Harsh Realm, Keen Eddie, The $treet, The American Embassy, Cedric the Entertainer Presents, The Tick, Luis, and Greg the Bunny. Lois asks whether there is any hope, to which Peter replies that if all these shows are canceled they might have a chance; the shows were indeed canceled during Family Guys hiatus.|$|E

500|$|Further reviews {{tended to}} be negative. IGN's Travis Fickett rated the episode 6.0/10, {{explaining}} [...] "It's <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> as if Walter's loony logic is starting to influence the actual writing of Fringe." [...] Fickett criticized Walter's science and [...] "silly ranting", Olivia's stepfather storyline, and believed certain lines of dialogue to be [...] "dangerously close to self-parody." [...] Sarah Stegall from SFScope was skeptical of the episode's science, and explained [...] "I really don't want any more of this. I'm tired of this formulaic series. I'm tired of Anna Torv's earnest, sad expressions—can we get this woman to laugh once or twice? Joshua Jackson and Kirk Acevedo are good supports and foils for Olivia, but there's no there there {{when it comes to}} Agent Dunham." [...] Patrick Kevin Day from the Los Angeles Times liked the opening sequence, but was distracted from fully enjoying the episode because he thought the science was [...] "wonky." [...] The A.V. Club columnist Noel Murray graded the episode with a B, explaining he liked Chris Eigeman's presence and the efforts at further developing the characters, but questioned the Pattern storyline, despite admitting that he does not require rational scientific explanations in science fiction. Tim Grierson of New York Magazine disliked the focus on Olivia, calling it [...] "a long hour of television." [...] Referring to Olivia's [...] "feminist" [...] speech to Broyles, Grierson continued, [...] "It's sort of cute how Fringe occasionally pretends that it's more than just a freak show. But if they're going to focus on a character, it should be Walter — though we shudder to think how his flatulence will factor into the plot." ...|$|E
500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning {{gave the}} episode a 7.4 out of 10 rating, writing that he [...] "merely" [...] liked the episode. [...] "It wasn't nearly as fun as I had {{hoped it would}} be. I mean, {{if you were going}} to bring Floyd back and name the episode after him, it would have been nice to give [...] a little spark." [...] The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin gave it a C rating, calling it [...] a disappointing episode. In regards to Jason Sudeikis, Rabin commented that he is a [...] "gifted comic actor" [...] but this episode [...] "found him at his hammy, embarrassing worst." [...] Meredith Blake, writing for the Los Angeles Times, remarked that the episode [...] "may have been the worst one yet", and said that when Floyd [...] called Liz a [...] "badger", her heart broke into smithereens, [...] "There's mean-funny, and then there's plain old mean. [...] Liz's love life has become the central butt of the joke on 30 Rock... and it's <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> like the writers have run out of ways to be funny without being sadistic." [...] Sean Gandert of Paste said that [...] "Floyd" [...] was not a great episode, [...] "but it's still pretty good by this season's standards, if a somewhat disappointing use of Floyd's return." [...] He explained that part of the episode's problem was that Liz's relationships not succeeding [...] "has become pretty old hat for the show since we've seen it time and time again", and hoped to see her [...] "find a good man and let the show move onto something else for a while." [...] TV Guides Adam Mersel wrote that it [...] "really didn't do it for me. I didn't really laugh out loud much, and the cameo from one of my favorite SNL players came off a bit forced." ...|$|E
500|$|... "She Wolf" [...] {{was written}} by Shakira, John Hill, and Sam Endicott. Shakira and Hill also served as the {{producers}} of the song. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Shakira said that the idea for [...] "She Wolf" [...] came to her [...] "very mysteriously", revealing [...] "I was in the studio {{in a bad mood}} that day, then I got inspired and went to a corner and I wrote the lyrics and the melody in 10 minutes. The image of the she wolf just came to my head, and when I least expected it I was howling and panting". Endicott, musician and lead singer of American post-punk band The Bravery, explained how he and Hill began working with Shakira, saying she [...] "contacted him (Hill), asking if he had any stuff. We never had her in mind. We just made the thing independently of her, and then she liked it a lot, and she sang over it. She used some of the melodies we put in there and then wrote these crazy lyrics about being a werewolf. And that's how it happened". [...] "She Wolf" [...] was described by Slant Magazine as a [...] "sleek, hi-NRG/Italo throwback that's drenched in disco strings". Mikael Wood from Spin identified the song's genre as synthpop. Shakira also howls and pants at various times during the song. It is written in B minor key and is a moderate dance groove with a tempo of 120 beats per minute. Shakira's vocal range on the song spans from B3 to D5. One of the lines of the song, in which Shakira sings [...] "I'm <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> just a little abused, like a coffee machine in an office", is often cited {{as an example of the}} unusual lyrics present in Shakira's songs.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the years}} {{immediately}} following the novel's publication, many American conservatives, such as William F. Buckley, Jr., strongly disapproved of Rand and her Objectivist message. In addition to the strongly critical review by Whittaker Chambers, Buckley solicited a number of critical pieces: Russell Kirk called Objectivism an [...] "inverted religion", Frank Meyer accused Rand of [...] "calculated cruelties" [...] and her message, an [...] "arid subhuman image of man", and Garry Wills regarded Rand a [...] "fanatic". In the late 2000s, however, conservative commentators suggested the book as a warning against a socialistic reaction to the finance crisis. Conservative commentators Neal Boortz, Glenn Beck, and Rush Limbaugh offered praise of the book on their respective radio and television programs. In 2006, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States Clarence Thomas cited Atlas Shrugged as among his favorite novels. Republican Congressman John Campbell said, for example, [...] "People are <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> like we're living through the scenario that happened in ...

2500|$|Episodes two {{and three}} did not fare as well, critically. Discussing the second episode, Michael Hogan in The Daily Telegraph found the quickened pace invigorating, and found the story gripping. But Neela Debnath at The Independent criticised the writing, concluding, [...] "Sadly, all the {{electric}} tension of episode one has evaporated, instead events are becoming improbable and additional drama seems to be shoehorned in {{for the sake of}} it. ... There's so much going on that it's <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> unbelievable." [...] Ross McG at Metro largely agreed with these points, and noted that the courtroom drama seemed bland because it essentially reiterated facts viewers already knew. Ben Skipper at the International Business Times was harsh in his appraisal, calling episode two [...] "Broadchurch first truly bad hour of television." [...] He blasted the plot, particularly the apparent kidnapping of Claire Ripley, the clichéd timing of Beth Latimer going into labour, and legal inconsistencies. He also called Marianne Jean-Baptiste's performance [...] "lacking". The [...] "Bafta-winning detective drama is a heap of old codswallop that makes no sense at all," [...] said Christopher Stevens in the Daily Mail, referencing episode three. [...] "The first episode was shaky. The second was riddled with errors. But the third was beyond all forgiving." [...] There was limited praise for episode three, however. Ben Dowell at Radio Times had high praise for cinematographer John Conroy's work: [...] "The cinematography was beautiful. Broadchurch always looks fabulously bucolic but tonight the lovely summer dawns and countryside was shown off to an even greater degree..." [...] He also lauded Olivia Colman's performance, calling her [...] "once again on top form".|$|E
