30|$|The {{monitoring}} of the high-energy particle environment in the Japanese meridian of GEO started {{at the beginning of}} Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA)’s satellite program. <b>Space</b> environment <b>monitors</b> (SEM) onboard Japan’s geostationary meteorological satellite (GMS) series ‘Himawari’ have been started with GMS- 1 in 1978 (Kurino 1985). <b>Space</b> environment <b>monitoring</b> by SEM continued up to GMS- 4. However, SEM was not installed onboard the satellites that followed GMS- 4 (GMS- 5, MTSAT- 1 R, MTSAT- 2).
