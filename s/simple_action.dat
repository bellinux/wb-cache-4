500|$|Planet Stories also {{improved}} dramatically {{by the end}} of the decade. [...] Several well-known writers, including Blish, Brown, and Knight, published good material in Planet, but the overall improvement was largely due to the contributions of Bradbury and Leigh Brackett, both of whom set many of their stories on a version of Mars that owed much to the Barsoom of Edgar Rice Burroughs. [...] Brackett, one of Planets most prolific contributors, developed her style over the 1940s and eventually became the leading exponent of planetary romances. [...] Her series of stories about Eric John Stark, considered by Ashley to be her best work, began in Planet with [...] "Queen of the Martian Catacombs" [...] in the Summer 1949 issue. [...] Bradbury's work for Planet included two of his Martian Chronicles stories, and a collaboration with Brackett, [...] "Lorelei of the Red Mist", which appeared in 1946. [...] Tim Forest, a historian of the pulps, considers Bradbury's work to be Planets [...] "most important contribution to the genre". [...] The covers were generally <b>simple</b> <b>action</b> scenes, featuring a helpless damsel threatened by a bug-eyed monster, but according to Clute [...] "the content was far more sophisticated than the covers".|$|E

2500|$|The Chichewa tense {{system also}} {{incorporates}} aspectual distinctions.

In the imperfective tenses {{for the most part}} there is no distinction between habitual and progressive aspect; however, in the present tense there is such a distinction; for example, ndímapíta [...] "I go (every day)" [...] (habitual) vs ndikupíta [...] "I am going (now)" [...] (progressive).|$|E
2500|$|In November 1989, the Princess {{visited a}} leprosy {{hospital}} in Indonesia. Following her visit, she became {{patron of the}} Leprosy Mission, an organisation dedicated to providing medicine, treatment, and other support services {{to those who are}} afflicted with the disease. She remained the patron of this charity until her death in 1997, and visited several of its hospitals around the world, especially in India, Nepal, Zimbabwe and Nigeria. She famously touched those affected by the disease when many people believed it could be contracted through casual contact. [...] "It has always been my concern to touch people with leprosy, trying to show in a <b>simple</b> <b>action</b> that they are not reviled, nor are we repulsed," [...] she commented. The Diana Princess of Wales Health Education and Media Centre in Noida, India, was opened in her honour in November 1999, funded by the Diana Princess of Wales Memorial Fund to give social support to the people affected by leprosy and disability.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{implication}} of this dualism {{is the notion of}} [...] "Worship through Corporeality", Avodah be-Gashmi'yut. As the Ein Sof metamorphosed into substance, so may it in turn be raised back to its higher state; likewise, since the machinations in the higher Sephirot exert their influence on this world, even the most <b>simple</b> <b>action</b> may, if performed correctly and with understanding, achieve the reverse effect. According to Lurianic doctrine, The netherworld was suffused with divine sparks, concealed within [...] "husks", Qliphoth. The glints had to be recovered and elevated to their proper place in the cosmos. [...] "Materiality itself could be embraced and consecrated", noted Glenn Dynner, and Hasidism taught that by common acts like dancing or eating, performed with intention, the sparks could be extricated and set free. Avodah be-Gashmi'yut had a clear, if not implicit, antinomian edge, possibly equating sacred rituals mandated by Judaism with everyday activities, granting them the same status in the believer's eyes and having him content to commit the latter {{at the expense of the}} former. While at some occasions the movement did appear to step at that direction – for example, in its early days prayer and preparation for it consumed so much time that adherents were blamed of neglecting sufficient Torah study – Hasidic masters proved highly conservative. Unlike in other, more radical sects influenced by kabbalistic ideas, like the Sabbateans, Worship through Corporeality was largely limited to the elite and carefully restrained. The common adherents were taught they may engage it only mildly, through small deeds like earning money to support their leaders.|$|E

What the Greeks {{did for the}} horse, and what, as far {{as regards}} {{domestic}} and expressional character, Landseer has done for the dog and the deer, {{remains to be done}} by art for nearly all other animals of high organisation. There are few birds or beasts that have not a range of character which, if not equal to that of the horse or dog, is yet as interesting within narrower limits, and often in grotesqueness, intensity, or wild and timid pathos, more singular and mysterious. Whatever love of humour you have,--whatever sympathy with imperfect, but most subtle, feeling,--whatever perception of sublimity in conditions of fatal power, may here find fullest occupation: all these being joined, in the strong animal races, to a variable and fantastic beauty far beyond anything that merely formative art has yet conceived. I have placed in your Educational series a wing by Albert Dürer, which goes as far as art yet has reached in delineation of plumage; while for the <b>simple</b> <b>action</b> of the pinion it is impossible to go beyond what has been done already by Titian and Tintoret; but you cannot so much as once look at the rufflings of the plumes of a pelican pluming itself after {{it has been in the}} water, or carefully draw the contours of the wing either of a vulture or a common swift, or paint the rose and vermilion on that of a flamingo, without receiving almost a new conception of the meaning of form and colour in creation.|$|E
6000|$|... 197. We pass, on {{the reverse}} of the die, to the figure of Zeus Aietophoros. Think of the {{invocation}} to Zeus in the Suppliants, (525), [...] "King of Kings, and Happiest of the Happy, Perfectest of the Perfect in strength, abounding in all things, Jove--hear us and be with us;" [...] and then, consider what strange phase of mind it was, which, under the very mountain-home of the god, was content with this symbol {{of him as a}} well-fed athlete, holding a diminutive and crouching eagle on his fist. The features and the right hand have been injured in this coin, but the action of the arms shows that it held a thunderbolt, of which, I believe, the twisted rays were triple. In the, presumably earlier, coin engraved by Millingen, however,[137] it is singly pointed only; and the added inscription [...] "[Greek: ITHÔM]," [...] in the field, renders the conjecture of Millingen probable, that this is a rude representation of the statue of Zeus Ithomates, made by Ageladas, the master of Phidias; and I think it has, indeed, the aspect of the endeavour, by a workman of more advanced knowledge, and more vulgar temper, to put the softer anatomy of later schools into the <b>simple</b> <b>action</b> of an archaic figure. Be that as it may, here {{is one of the most}} refined cities of Greece content with the figure of an athlete as the representative of their own mountain god; marked as a divine power merely by the attributes of the eagle and thunderbolt.|$|E
60|$|The {{successive}} {{stages of}} development of the colours and plumage of the Birds of Paradise are very interesting, from the striking {{manner in which they}} accord with the theory of their having been produced by the <b>simple</b> <b>action</b> of variation, and the cumulative power of selection by the females, of those male birds which were more than usually ornamental. Variations of colour are of all others the most frequent and the most striking, and are most easily modified and accumulated by man's selection of them. We should expect, therefore, that the sexual differences of colour would be those most early accumulated and fixed, and would therefore appear soonest in the young birds; and this is exactly what occurs in the Paradise Birds. Of all variations in the form of birds' feathers, none are so frequent as those in the head and tail. These occur more, or less in every family of birds, and are easily produced in many domesticated varieties, while unusual developments of the feathers of the body are rare in the whole class of birds, and have seldom or never occurred in domesticated species. In accordance with these facts, we find the scale-formed plumes of the throat, the crests of the head, and the long cirrhi of the tail, all fully developed before the plumes which spring {{from the side of the}} body begin to mane their appearance. If, on the other hand, the male Paradise Birds have not acquired their distinctive plumage by successive variations, but have been as they are mow from the moment they first appeared upon the earth, this succession becomes at the least unintelligible to us, for we can see no reason why the changes should not take place simultaneously, or in a reverse order to that in which they actually occur.|$|E
