Strontium- 90 {{is a principal}} radionuclide contaminant in the subsurface at several Department of Energy sites in the Western U.

In this work, we used laboratory-scale porous media flow cells to examine a potential remediation strategy employing coprecipitation of <b>strontium</b> in <b>carbonate</b> minerals. CaCO 3 precipitation and strontium coprecipitation were induced via ureolysis by Sporosarcina pasteurii in two-dimensional porous media reactors. An injection strategy using pulsed injection of calcium mineralization medium was tested against a continuous injection strategy. The pulsed injection strategy involved periods of lowered calcite saturation index combined with short high fluid velocity flow periods of calcium mineralization medium followed by stagnation (no-flow) periods to promote homogeneous CaCO 3 precipitation. By alternating the addition of mineralization and growth media the pulsed strategy promoted CaCO 3 precipitation while sustaining the ureolytic culture over time. Both injection strategies achieved ureolysis with subsequent CaCO 3 precipitation and strontium coprecipitation. The pulsed injection strategy precipitated 71 ? 85 % of calcium and 59 % of strontium, while the continuous injection was less efficient and precipitated 61 % of calcium and 56 % of strontium. Over the 60 day operation of the pulsed reactors, ureolysis was continually observed, suggesting that the balance between growth and precipitation phases allowed for continued cell viability. Our results support the pulsed injection strategy as a viable option for ureolysis-induced strontium coprecipitation because it may reduce the likelihood of injection well accumulation caused by localized mineral plugging while Sr coprecipitation efficiency is maintained in field-scale applications.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in Proterozoic micropaleontology and sedimentary isotope geochemistry suggest that improved interbasinal correlation of Neoproterozoic (1000 - 540 Ma) successions is possible.

Mineralogical and geochemical studies of these carbonate sediments indicate that submarine burial diagenesis has {{played an important}} role in the induration of sediments at this site. Metastable carbonates, high-magnesium calcite (HMC) and aragonite, convert to low-magnesium calcite (LMC) rapidly, within 1. 1 and 6. 0 Ma, respectively. <b>Strontium</b> concentrations in <b>carbonate</b> decrease with depth as the result of the burial diagenesis of calcium car- bonate, primarily aragonite, with excess strontium being expelled into pore waters. The formation of celestite at depth indicates that sufficient diagenesis of carbonate sediments has occurred to saturate or supersaturate pore waters with re- spect to this authigenic mineral. Sodium also decreases monotonically with depth as a result of the burial diagenesis of calcium carbonate. Magnesium and carbon and oxygen isotopic curves are remarkably similar. Carbon isotopic compositions record inputs of 13 C-enriched components from shallow carbonate banks. Magnesium concentrations vary widely, recording enhanced episodes of cementation by LMC with slightly elevated magnesium contents. Positive shifts in oxygen isotopic composition also record episodes of cementation during burial diagenesis.

40|$|Subduction of the Pacific plate {{beneath the}} Mariana forearc {{releases}} fluids to the overlying mantle wedge that ascend, producing serpentinite "mud" that discharges {{on the ocean}} floor. As part of Leg 195 of the Ocean Drilling Program cores were obtained from drill-holes into the mud volcanoes. We report the isotopic composition of Sr in water squeezed from intervals of the cores, in the serpentinite mud, in leaches of the serpentinite mud, and in entrained small harzburgitic clasts. Except in the upper few meters below the seawater-mud interface, where pore water approaches seawater Sr concentration and isotopic ratio, Sr concentration and isotopic composition remain constant at 3 - 6 µmol/kg and ~ 0. 7054. Because the elemental chemistry of the pore water is unlike seawater, this isotopic composition reflects fluids derived from the subducted slab, probably modified by reaction with mantle material during ascent. Higher Sr isotopic ratios, up to 0. 7087, - but not with higher Sr concentrations in pore water - occur superimposed on an advection profile at 13 - 16 mbsf surrounding {{a thin layer of}} foraminiferal sand. Since the upward seepage velocity of slab fluids in the mud volcano vents is a few cm/yr, exchange of Sr between these carbonates and the rising fluids must have occurred within a maximum of a few hundred years, essentially instantaneously given the millions, or tens of millions, of years the mud volcanoes have been in existence. In contrast, the strontium isotopic compositions of leached serpentinite mud, and of small harzburgite clasts entrained in the mud, are always significantly greater than that of the pore water. In small harzburgite clasts the ratio reaches 0. 7088, almost as high as the seawater value of 0. 7092 and much higher than the value of typical mantle-derived strontium of ~ 0. 704. The serpentinite muds and harzburgite clasts clearly equilibrated with seawater Sr when they were initially deposited at the surface of the seamount, but following burial they have not fully equilibrated with strontium in the pore water now discharging through the vents. These variations in the strontium isotopic composition of solids and pore waters are more consistent with episodic expulsion of fluids in the subduction zone than steady state flow. Whereas <b>strontium</b> in <b>carbonates</b> equilibrates isotopically within a few hundred years, strontium in buried harzburgite clasts does not equilibrate in the same time, assuming steady state rates of upward fluid flow. By inference, the harzburgite clasts and associated serpentinite mud must have been near the seafloor, unburied, for a yet undetermined but much longer period of time to have equilibrated from ~ 0. 704 to 0. 709 prior to subsequent burial. It may be possible to characterize at least the periodicity of fluid release in the mud volcano setting by investigating the zonation of strontium isotopic composition of hartzburgite clasts throughout the 60 -meter deep composite cores...|$|R

In Vineyard Sound, Massachusetts, U. S. A., d 18 O from several coexisting shallow marine taxa and well–constrained environmental parameters {{were used to}} test {{the extent to which the}} known local annual variation of these parameters was represented in the shell carbonate. This relation was explored through the construction of time series from bivalve d 18 O versus shell distance profiles and the calculation of growth rates and isotopic fractionation factors. It was discovered that the marine temperature range recorded in the biogenic carbonate extended to lower temperatures than expected and was, in its entirety, better represented not by a single taxon but by the concurrent use of multiple taxa. Modeling of bivalve d 18 O of modern shallow marine environments along the North American east coast showed that large salinity ranges complicate environmental interpretations. However, modeled clams showed that d 18 O seasonal variability can discriminate between tropical and temperate shallow water marine climates. Higher variability characterizes the winter of tropical zones while the opposite is true for temperate regions. 87 Sr/ 86 Sr and Sr concentration of unaltered calcite bivalves from ANDRILL’s core AND– 2 A produced reliable ages and confirm contrasting marine climate conditions across the Middle Miocene of Southern McMurdo Sound, Antarctica. In contrast, seemingly unaltered aragonite shells invariably produced older than expected ages. Additional analyses of the aragonite shells and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr compositions of pore water were carried out to reconcile these results. d 18 O and Sr concentrations of pore water and aragonites suggested that the anomalous ages are likely the result of early diagenetic alteration, even in the absence of mineralogical change...|$|R
