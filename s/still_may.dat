5|$|When the {{protostar}} {{has grown}} {{such that it}} ignites to form a star, the surviving disk {{is removed from the}} inside outward by photoevaporation, the solar wind, Poynting–Robertson drag and other effects. Thereafter there <b>still</b> <b>may</b> be many protoplanets orbiting the star or each other, but over time many will collide, either to form a single larger planet or release material for other larger protoplanets or planets to absorb. Those objects that have become massive enough will capture most matter in their orbital neighbourhoods to become planets. Protoplanets that have avoided collisions may become natural satellites of planets through a process of gravitational capture, or remain in belts of other objects to become either dwarf planets or small bodies.|$|E

25|$|When {{heraldry}} {{developed in}} the Middle Ages, not much was known about the biology of the dolphin and it was often depicted {{as a sort of}} fish.

25|$|The cost of {{antiretroviral}} drugs—which can {{prolong the}} lives of infected people—has plunged in recent years but <b>still</b> <b>may</b> be prohibitively high for low-income countries. More importantly, the drug costs are {{only a portion of}} HIV/AIDS treatment costs. Drug-resistant strains are likely to spread because of the inconsistent use of antiretroviral therapies and the manufacture overseas of unregulated, substandard drugs.|$|E
25|$|States {{that are}} {{generally}} strong <b>still</b> <b>may</b> need FID assistance for well-defined problems, especially problems where they lack skill and resources that they can, over time, acquire.

Nevertheless, they may need to develop additional resources ranging from port inspection to sea surveillance to advanced intelligence.|$|E
5000|$|Water is {{probably}} the most important of the Essentials. Dehydration may develop into heat exhaustion and heatstroke. The human body may only survive for a few days without water. Portable water purifiers and water <b>stills</b> <b>may</b> be used to obtain potable water from virtually any source. If a water-source is unavailable the use of a dromedary bag should be considered.|$|R

This significant investment has triggered the involvement of international NGOs to establish bases {{in the region and}} work to develop bonobo conservation programs.

25|$|There {{are many}} growth {{abnormalities}} associated with 1p36 deletion syndrome. One common problem is delayed growth or difficulty in gaining weight. Even {{though some of}} the children may eat well, they <b>still</b> <b>may</b> not grow normally. In contrast, some children may develop hyperphagia, which is overeating, and may become obese. These children clinically resemble children with Prader-Willi syndrome. Developmental delay has also been severe in the patients with the Prader-Willi like characteristics.|$|E
25|$|Local {{creeks and}} the nearby San Francisco Bay suffer {{somewhat}} from water pollution originating from street water runoff and industrial wastes. The creeks in Milpitas, especially Calera, Scott, and Berryessa Creeks, used to be prime fishing spots for native steelhead until pollutants from urban development and industry killed the fish starting in the 1950s. While small populations of steelhead and even salmon <b>still</b> <b>may</b> be seen in area streams these cannot legally be fished and consumption of legal catches is limited by mercury contamination.|$|E

25|$|St. Sergius was {{declared}} {{patron saint of}} the Russian state in 1422. The same year the first stone cathedral was built {{by a team of}} Serbian monks who had found refuge in the monastery after the Battle of Kosovo. The relics of St. Sergius <b>still</b> <b>may</b> be seen in this cathedral, dedicated to the Holy Trinity. The greatest icon painters of medieval Russia, Andrei Rublev and Daniil Chyorny, were summoned to decorate the cathedral with frescoes. Traditionally, Muscovite royals were baptized in this cathedral and held thanksgiving services here.|$|E
25|$|While {{different}} kinds of insurgency differ in where they place clandestine or covert cells, when certain types of insurgency grow in power, the cell system is deemphasized. Cells <b>still</b> <b>may</b> be used for leadership security, but, if overt violence by organized units becomes significant, cells are less important. In Mao's three-stage doctrine, cells are still useful in Phase II to give cover to part-time guerillas, but, as the insurgency creates full-time military units in Phase III, the main units are the focus, not the cells. The Eighth Route Army did not run on a cell model.|$|E
40|$|Salient Stills are a {{class of}} images that reflect the {{aggregation}} of the temporal changes that occur in a movingimage sequence with the salient features of individual frames preserved. They convey the intended expression of an entire series of moving frames—a visual summary of camera and object movements. The original frames, which may include variations in focal length or field of view, or moving objects, are combined to create a single still image. The <b>still</b> image <b>may</b> have multi-resolution patches, a larger field of view, or higher overall resolution than any individual frame in the original image sequence. Salient <b>Stills</b> <b>may</b> also contain selected significant objects from individual or multiple video frames. Salient Stills attempt to retain much of the original content (detail) and spatial and temporal extent (context) of the original video or film sequence...|$|R

25|$|The {{emergency}} telephone number is a special case in the country's telephone number plan. In the past, calls to the {{emergency telephone}} number were often routed over special dedicated circuits. Though {{with the advent of}} electronic exchanges these calls are now often mixed with ordinary telephone traffic, they <b>still</b> <b>may</b> be able to access circuits that other traffic cannot. Often the system is set up so that once a call is made to an {{emergency telephone number}}, it must be answered. Should the caller abandon the call, the line may still be held until the emergency service answers and releases the call.|$|E
25|$|The {{concerns}} {{raised by}} the above may be addressed in part by use of the Clipped Tag. The Clipped Tag is an RFID tag designed to increase consumer privacy. The Clipped Tag has been suggested by IBM researchers Paul Moskowitz and Guenter Karjoth. After the point of sale, a consumer may tear off {{a portion of the}} tag. This allows the transformation of a long-range tag into a proximity tag that <b>still</b> <b>may</b> be read, but only at short range– less than a few inches or centimeters. The modification of the tag may be confirmed visually. The tag may still be used later for returns, recalls, or recycling.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 19th century {{the basics of}} modern {{techniques}} including pre-heating and reflux were developed. In 1822, Anthony Perrier developed {{one of the first}} continuous stills. In 1826, Robert Stein improved that design to make his patent still. In 1830, Aeneas Coffey got a patent for improving that design. Coffey's continuous <b>still</b> <b>may</b> be regarded as the archetype of modern petrochemical units. The French engineer Armand Savalle developed his steam regulator around 1846. In 1877, Ernest Solvay was granted a U.S. Patent for a tray column for ammonia distillation and the same and subsequent years saw developments of this theme for oil and spirits.|$|E
