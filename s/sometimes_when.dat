5|$|In {{addition}} to the regular enemies, the player also needs to defeat several bosses and mini-bosses throughout the game. By defeating enemies, the player gains experience points, which make the hero's level increase; when this happens, the player gets points to spend on four different disciplines, each of which gives the hero access to different abilities and enhances different stats associated with the discipline: Warrior is associated with physical attacks, Monk with defense and health points, Mage with magic attacks and magic points, and Sage {{with an increase in}} the weapon limit gauge. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>when</b> enemies are defeated, they drop items; the player can carry items with them, which are grouped into stacks, each taking up one slot in the inventory.|$|E

25|$|<b>Sometimes,</b> <b>when</b> {{modeling}} {{a network}} {{with more than}} one source, a supersource is introduced to the graph. This consists of a vertex connected to each of the sources with edges of infinite capacity, so as to act as a global source. A similar construct for sinks is called a supersink.|$|E
25|$|After combining, the oats are {{transported to}} the {{farmyard}} using a grain truck, semi, or road train, where they are augered or conveyed into a bin for storage. <b>Sometimes,</b> <b>when</b> {{there is not enough}} bin space, they are augered into portable grain rings, or piled on the ground. Oats can be safely stored at 12-14% moisture; at higher moisture levels, they must be aerated or dried.|$|E
25|$|Dihydropyridine (DHP) {{calcium channel}} {{blockers}} {{are derived from}} the molecule dihydropyridine and often used to reduce systemic vascular resistance and arterial pressure. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>when</b> {{they are used to}} treat angina, the vasodilation and hypotension can lead to reflex tachycardia, which can be detrimental for patients with ischemic symptoms because of the resulting increase in myocardial oxygen demand. Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers can worsen proteinuria in patients with nephropathy.|$|E

25|$|The {{player has}} many acrobatic {{maneuvers}} at their disposal. Acrobatics {{are also used}} in combat to vault over enemies, or hit them into the air. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>when</b> performing these acrobatics, the player is aided by Elika. There are magical plates that allow the player to perform even more complicated acrobatic feats via Elika. If the player fails to signal Elika's magic, they fall off of the plate, sometimes to their death.|$|E
25|$|The {{singular}} number {{indicates that}} the denoted thing is one or indivisible (as in méilė – love, smė̃lis – sand, píenas – milk). The plural number, when it can be {{in contrast with the}} singular, {{indicates that the}}re are many of the things denoted by the word. But <b>sometimes,</b> <b>when</b> a word doesn't have the singular number, being a plurale tantum noun, the plural form doesn't indicate real singularity or plurality of the denoted object(s).|$|E

However, they are also subject to Major League Baseball rules requiring the road team to wear uniforms that contrast with the uniforms worn by the home team. Due to this rule, the gray uniforms are worn when the home team chooses to wear navy blue, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>when</b> the home team chooses to wear black.|$|E

25|$|On-site auctions – <b>Sometimes</b> <b>when</b> {{the stock}} or assets {{of a company}} are simply too vast or too bulky for an auction house to {{transport}} to their own premises and store, they will hold an auction {{within the confines of}} the bankrupt company itself. Bidders could find themselves bidding for items which are still plugged in, and the great advantage of these auctions taking place on the premises is that they have the opportunity to view the goods as they were being used, and may be able to try them out. Bidders can also avoid the possibility of goods being damaged whilst they are being removed as they can do it or at least supervise the activity.|$|E
25|$|Nest refoundation by colonies that {{lose the}} {{original}} one is pretty common, and allows this species of wasps {{to thrive in}} highly disturbed landscapes, that face frequent fires or other disturbances. When the nest is destroyed or goes lost, the swarm just moves to a near point (a branch or else) and begins another nest. <b>Sometimes,</b> <b>when</b> {{there are lots of}} wasps, the swarm may break up and create several new little nests. Only the one with the foundress in it will produce female offspring and complete the cycle, while the other ones will end up producing worker males. If one of those secondary nests is lost, its workers will rather rejoin a near group of other sisters instead of trying to found it again.|$|E
25|$|Many photographers {{continue}} to produce some monochrome images, sometimes {{because of the}} established archival permanence of well-processed silver-halide-based materials. Some full-color digital images are processed {{using a variety of}} techniques to create black-and-white results, and some manufacturers produce digital cameras that exclusively shoot monochrome. Monochrome printing or electronic display can be used to salvage certain photographs taken in color which are unsatisfactory in their original form; <b>sometimes</b> <b>when</b> presented as black-and-white or single-color-toned images they are found to be more effective. Although color photography has long predominated, monochrome images are still produced, mostly for artistic reasons. Almost all digital cameras have an option to shoot in monochrome, and almost all image editing software can combine or selectively discard RGB color channels to produce a monochrome image from one shot in color.|$|E

25|$|Unlike {{localized}} ("intra-atomic") {{absorption of}} light which causes color for chromium and vanadium impurities, blue color in sapphires comes from intervalence charge transfer, {{which is the}} transfer of an electron from one transition-metal ion to another via the conduction or valence band. The iron can take the form Fe2+ or Fe3+, while titanium generally takes the form Ti4+. If Fe2+ and Ti4+ ions are substituted for Al3+, localized areas of charge imbalance are created. An electron transfer from Fe2+ and Ti4+ can cause {{a change in the}} valence state of both. Because of the valence change there is a specific change in energy for the electron, and electromagnetic energy is absorbed. The wavelength of the energy absorbed corresponds to yellow light. When this light is subtracted from incident white light, the complementary color blue results. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>when</b> atomic spacing is different in different directions there is resulting blue-green dichroism.|$|E
25|$|In the kitchen, tempeh {{is often}} {{prepared}} by cutting it into pieces, soaking in brine or salty sauce, and then frying. Cooked tempeh can be eaten alone, or used in chili, stir fries, soups, salads, sandwiches, and stews. Tempeh's complex flavor {{has been described}} as nutty, meaty, and mushroom-like. It freezes well, and is now commonly available in many western supermarkets, as well as in ethnic markets and health food stores. Tempeh performs well in a cheese grater, after which it may be used in the place of ground beef (as in tacos). When thin-sliced and deep-fried in oil, tempeh obtains a crisp golden crust while maintaining a soft interior—its sponge-like consistency makes it suitable for marinating. Dried tempeh (whether cooked or raw) is more portable and less perishable and may be used as a stew base. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>when</b> tempeh is diced and left, they will create white feathery fluff which bonds the cut—this is the Rhizopus mold still growing—this is normal and perfectly edible.|$|E
25|$|Kawabata {{apparently}} {{committed suicide}} in 1972 by gassing himself, {{but a number of}} close associates, including his widow, consider his death to have been accidental. One thesis, as advanced by Donald Richie, was that he mistakenly unplugged the gas tap while preparing a bath. Many theories have been advanced as to his potential reasons for killing himself, among them poor health (the discovery that he had Parkinson's disease), a possible illicit love affair, or the shock caused by the suicide of his friend Yukio Mishima in 1970. Unlike Mishima, Kawabata left no note, and since (again unlike Mishima) he had not discussed significantly in his writings the topic of taking his own life, his motives remain unclear. However, his Japanese biographer, Takeo Okuno, has related how he had nightmares about Mishima for two or three hundred nights in a row, and was incessantly haunted by the specter of Mishima. In a persistently depressed state of mind, he would tell friends during his last years that <b>sometimes,</b> <b>when</b> on a journey, he hoped his plane would crash.|$|E
