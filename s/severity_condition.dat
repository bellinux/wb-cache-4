40|$|Studies of affective {{forecasting}} examine people’s {{ability to}} predict (forecast) their emotional (affective) responses to future events. Affective forecasts underlie nearly all decisions people make and the actions they take. However, people engage in systematic cognitive errors when making affective forecasts and most often overestimate {{the intensity and}} duration of their emotional responses. Understanding the mechanisms that lead to affective forecasting errors (e. g., immune neglect) and examining the utility of methods for improving affective forecasting errors (e. g., surrogation) can provide highly valuable information for clinicians as they assist clients in determining their goals both for therapy and for life. The first {{purpose of the current}} study was to determine if affective forecasting errors due to immune neglect lead to misjudgments about the relative emotional impact of minor versus moderate negative experiences (i. e., trauma severity). The second purpose was to examine the utility of surrogation for improving affective forecasts. Potential interaction effects between these two variables were also examined. The current study utilized a 2 (Trauma Severity: minor, moderate) X 3 (Prediction Information: surrogation information only, simulation information only, both types of information) experimental design. Undergraduates were recruited via the SONA system and {{randomly assigned to one of}} the six experimental conditions. A preliminary study was conducted to obtain surrogation information for use in the main study. All participants in the main study predicted how they would feel 10 minutes after receiving negative personality feedback, using a 10 -point scale ranging from (1) very unhappy to (10) very happy. These predictions constitute their affective forecasts. All participants then actually received the negative personality feedback (ostensibly from another participant, a peer, in a nearby room) and reported their actual affective states ten minutes later, using the same scale. These ratings constitute their affective reports. Affective forecasting error was calculated as the difference between affective forecasts and affective reports. Results showed the affective forecasts of participants in the moderate trauma <b>severity</b> <b>condition</b> were significantly less accurate than those of participants in the minor trauma <b>severity</b> <b>condition,</b> providing evidence of immune neglect. Surrogation information significantly improved the accuracy of affective forecasts when participants were deprived of simulation information.

METHODS: A prospective evaluation with a minimum follow-up of 5 years, eight elderly patients with cervical arthrosis and diagnosis of SCIWORA. The Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scale and ASIA were used on admission and at 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months. RESULTS: The central cord syndrome (CCS) was the neurological condition at admission. One patient recovered after corticosteroid therapy, but later, his disability worsened, and he was operated at 18 months, another patient recovered and a third died. The other patients underwent laminoplasty in the first 72 hours; patients with partial <b>severity</b> <b>condition</b> had a minimum improvement of five points in JAO scale and those with severe conditions died. CONCLUSIONS: The low-energy trauma can decompensate the relationship between container and content in the spine with asymptomatic arthrosis, and can be devastating to the patient.

40|$|Objective:A {{growing body}} of {{literature}} has examined the ways that bystander intervention can be helpful for situations involving sexual violence. The current study examined the little researched questions of how {{the relationship between the}} bystander and the victim and the bystander and the perpetrator impacts bystander perceptions (whether the situation is a problem and how safe it would be to intervene). Method: In the present study, 545 undergraduate students were randomly assigned by gender to vignettes (low and high severity) in which they had a relationship with the victim (stranger or friend) and a relationship with the perpetrator (stranger or friend). Participants were asked to fill out questionnaires about bystander perceptions (i. e., whether they perceived the situation as a problem, whether they felt the situation was safe to intervene). Results: The relationship with the victim and/or the perpetrator differentially impacted bystander perceptions, such that having a relationship with the victim was associated with more positive bystander perceptions whereas having a relationship with the perpetrator was mixed. Moreover, consistent with prior research, participants identified the situation as more of a problem and less safe to intervene in the high severity than the low <b>severity</b> <b>condition.</b> Conclusions: Bystander intervention programs aimed at preventing sexual violence need to include content that helps participants think through how they would handle situations where victims and/or perpetrator are known to them.

40|$|Abstract Background Chronic medical {{diseases}} require {{regular and}} longitudinal care and self-management for effective treatment. When chronic diseases include substance use disorders, care {{and treatment of}} both the medical and addiction disorders may affect access to care {{and the ability to}} focus on both conditions. The objective {{of this paper is to}} evaluate the association between the presence of chronic medical disease and recent addiction treatment utilization among adults with substance dependence. Methods Cross-sectional secondary data analysis of self-reported baseline data from alcohol and/or drug-dependent adults enrolled in a randomized clinical trial of a disease management program for substance dependence in primary care. The main independent variable was chronic medical disease status, categorized using the Katz Comorbidity Score as none, single condition of lower severity, or higher severity (multiple conditions or single higher <b>severity</b> <b>condition),</b> based on comorbidity scores determined from self-report. Asthma was also examined in secondary analyses. The primary outcome was any self-reported addiction treatment utilization (excluding detoxification) in the 3 months prior to study entry, including receipt of any addiction-focused counseling or addiction medication from any healthcare provider. Logistic regression models were adjusted for sociodemographics, type of substance dependence, recruitment site, current smoking, and recent anxiety severity. Results Of 563 subjects, 184 (33 %) reported any chronic disease (20 % low severity; 13 % higher severity) and 111 (20 %) reported asthma; 157 (28 %) reported any addiction treatment utilization in the past 3 months. In multivariate regression analyses, no significant effect was detected for chronic disease on addiction treatment utilization (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0. 88 lower severity vs. none, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 60, 1. 28; AOR 1. 29 higher severity vs. none, 95 % CI: 0. 89, 1. 88) nor for asthma. Conclusions In this cohort of alcohol and drug dependent persons, there was no significant effect of chronic medical disease on recent addiction treatment utilization.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2013 The {{presence}} of SO 2 in steam pretreatment creates {{a series of}} problems in environmental protection, equipment corrosion, chemical catalysis and waste water treatment. Moreover, SO 2 increases the pretreatment severity, resulting in more sugar degradation and increased inhibitor formation. In this study, hybrid poplar chips were steam exploded using 6 different conditions {{with or without the}} addition of SO 2. The steaming temperature ranged from 190 °C to 212 °C, and the residence time ranged from 5 min to 10 min, resulting in a range of fermentation inhibitors, including furfural, 5 -hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF), acetic acid and phenolic. It was found that certain concentration of inhibitors, particularly acetic acid, could promote the ethanol yield in hydrolysate fermentation, but always impairs the xylitol yield due to the acetyled xylan in hybrid poplar. At the lowest pretreatment <b>severity</b> <b>condition</b> at 205 °C, 10 minutes, without SO 2, the best inhibitor concentration for ethanol yield and the highest overall sugar recovery following pretreatment were achieved. However, since no SO 2 was applied, poor digestibility during enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose reduced the post-hydrolysis sugar recovery. For that reason, mechanical refining was applied to the solid fractions and improved the enzymatic hydrolysis for solids pretreated at 205 °C for 10 minutes, without SO 2 as much as 23 %. Similar improvements were observed for different enzyme loadings and solid consistencies. However, refining did not improve the hydrolyzability of solids pretreated at five other conditions. Reduced particle sizes were found to be correlated to increased sugar yields in enzymatic hydrolysis. Solids pretreated at 205 °C 10 minutes, without SO 2 exhibited the largest size reduction after refining and correspondingly achieved the highest overall sugar recovery improvement after steam pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis. In general, refining can enable a catalyst free, low inhibitor concentration, high overall sugar recovery bioconversion system based on the steam pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis method...|$|E
40|$|The {{primary goal}} {{of the present study}} was to test the effect of {{presenting}} young adults with educational information that was designed to decrease stigma and increase the favorability of attitudes toward seeking treatment for postpartum depression. The effect of information and symptom severity on ratings of stigma and attitudes toward help-seeking were investigated through the use of a 2 X 2 factorial design. Approximately 500 undergraduate students recruited from various classes at the University of Rhode Island were randomly assigned to receive information about pregnancy or postpartum depression. They were also assigned to read a vignette about a target who exhibited either high or low symptom severity. Participants were subsequently asked to fill out questionnaires that were designed to measure stigmatizing attitudes toward PPD, mental illness, and the target in the vignette. Participants 2 ̆ 7 help-seeking attitudes were also assessed. ^ Several interesting and important findings emerged from the current research. In what I view as the study 2 ̆ 7 s most important finding, receiving information about postpartum depression decreased the stigmatization of a target individual with this disorder. Receiving information about PPD also lessened participants 2 ̆ 7 stigmatization of mental illness more generally. Students who received information about postpartum depression were more likely than those who did not receive this information, to view a target with PPD as a good person, and as someone that they could understand. ^ While the findings that relate to changing people 2 ̆ 7 s stigmatizing attitudes were encouraging, the results that relate to help-seeking were not as positive. Receiving information about PPD did not result in more positive attitudes toward seeking mental health treatment. ^ One of the study 2 ̆ 7 s other main hypotheses had to do with the effect of symptom severity on help-seeking attitudes and stigmatizing beliefs about postpartum depression. As hypothesized, individuals who read a story about a target exhibiting a high level of symptom severity endorsed more stigmatizing attitudes toward that person than individuals who were assigned to the low symptom <b>severity</b> <b>condition.</b> However, much like the informational brochure, symptom severity did not have a significant effect on participants 2 ̆ 7 attitudes toward help-seeking. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to demonstrate the use of subcritical steam to pretreat coal for slurry liquefaction, allowing liquefaction to be carried out at lower severity and improving product yield and quality. Samples of Illinois No. 6 coal were pretreated in 750 psia steam at 340 {degree}C for 15 minutes. These samples, as well as raw coal, were liquefied at high (400 {degree}C, 30 min.) and low (385 {degree}C, 15 min.) <b>severity</b> <b>conditions</b> under 1500 psia hydrogen with tetralin as the donor solvent. Improved yields were obtained at both conditions. (Improved yields were not obtained at a liquefaction temperature of 350 {degree}C as that put the sample into the region of retrogressive reactions). The deleterious effects of slow heating and exposure of the sample to air were demonstrated. Under low <b>severity</b> <b>conditions,</b> steam pretreatment more that doubled the oil yield, increasing it from 12. 5 to 29 wt %. Tests were also conducted with aromatic ethers as model compounds.

Since 2000, five separate wildfires burned {{a large portion of the}} area in, and surrounding the Linville Gorge Wilderness in western North Carolina, two burned the same area a second time. Burn severity and vegetative recovery were measured in 152 plots established in 1992 prior to any wildfires. Field measurements of severity were strongly related to GIS data, allowing an accurate map of <b>severity</b> <b>conditions</b> in all 5 burned landscapes. Severity followed similar patterns at all fires. The most severely-burned areas were on the higher elevations, probably ridges, on slopes of moderate steepness, and facing to the south, southwest, west, or northwest.

Herb richness and total richness were highest in the highest level of re-burn severity. Significant changes (increases) in species richness occurred only at scales 3 ̆c 1 m 2, which is likely a reflection of large-scale community heterogeneity and/or heterogeneous patterns of burn severity.
