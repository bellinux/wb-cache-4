25|$|Each day Hilde visits Anton's grave mentally {{talking to}} {{him as if he}} is still alive. One evening, as she is {{returning}} home, Hilde discovers that a black cat seems to be following her. The cat causes her to remember two distinct experiences from her past. The first is a memory from when she was a small child and had attempted to hide a stray cat in her bedroom. Her family was very poor and could not afford a pet, but she saved her table scraps for it anyway. One day as <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> home, her father met her drunk in the doorway. After telling her he had snapped the cat's neck, he beat her harshly with a fly swatter. This first memory seeped into the second: her daughter, Erika, begging to keep a stray cat she had found. Anton had granted her wish, but the cat ruined the neighbors' gardens and Hilde was forced to drown it in the river.|$|E
25|$|Cornelio Arellano {{married a}} Pamplonesa, Juana Dihinx Vergara (1872-1969); with her father, Pascual Dihinx Azcárate, also an {{engineer}} engaged in Hidraúlica de Moncayo and other companies, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> {{from the same}} bourgeoisie background. The newlyweds followed the professional lot of Cornelio; in the early 20th century they lived in Zaragoza, to settle in Madrid in the 1920s. The couple had 7 children, 5 of them boys. Political preferences of Cornelio and Juana are not clear, except that she came from the family cultivating the Basque heritage; however, they brought up the children in highly Catholic ambience. It is not known whether Luis frequented the schools in Madrid or elsewhere, though he enrolled at the Jesuit University of Deusto in Bilbao. He graduated in law and economics at unspecified time in the late 1920s. In February 1936 he married María Dolores Aburto Renobales (?-2004), descendant to a wealthy bourgeoisie Biscay family. Her father, Eduardo Aburto Uribe, was engineer involved in number of provincial industrial enterprises, shareholder of many Biscay mining and metalworking companies, and alcalde of Getxo between 1916 and 1920. Luis and María had 4 sons; active in business, they did not engage in politics. Many of Luis' siblings were active in Traditionalism. Two of his younger brothers were executed by Republican militia in the Bilbao Angeles Custodios prison; an older one was later to become a Jesuit friar and another one a construction engineer. His sister María Teresa worked as a Carlist nurse during the Civil War.|$|E
500|$|Jamie Foster Brown in the 1994 {{issue of}} Sister 2 Sister wrote that [...] "R. Kelly {{told me that}} he and Aaliyah got {{together}} and it was just magic." [...] Brown also reported hearing about a relationship between them. [...] "I've been hearing about Robert and Aaliyah for a while—that she was pregnant. Or that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> and {{going in and out of}} his house. People would see her walking his dog, 12 Play, with her basketball cap and sunglasses on. Every time I asked the label, they said it was platonic. But I kept hearing complaints from people about her being in the studio with all those men. At 15," [...] Brown said. [...] "you have all those hormones and no brains attached to them." ...|$|E

500|$|Due to Manson's growing {{confidence}} and technical skill, the band decided that her vocals {{did not require}} much treatment; [...] "Shirley was singing so much better, and <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> up with melodies that were longer and had more range to them...there wasn't any point in doing a lot with it. On something like 'Nobody Loves You' she sings really low on the verse, almost {{at the bottom of}} her range, and then and the end she's singing three and a half octaves higher, almost in falsetto, as the song turns into a big wall of sound", Vig remarked. Manson's original guide vocals were used in the final mixes of several songs; the vocal on [...] "So Like a Rose" [...] was recorded on the first take. On some songs, however, Manson's vocal was subject to Pro Tools plug-ins and post effects. [...] "Til the Day Die" [...] featured a digital [...] "scratch"-effect, created by printing her vocal to DAT and using whatever edited passes sounded good. On [...] "Can't Cry These Tears", the four vocal parts were triple-tracked using different mikes, while a guitar riff was matched to her voice for a section of [...] "Breaking Up the Girl". On [...] "Cherry Lips", her entire vocal was sped up and heavily EQ'd. On slower songs such as [...] "Drive You Home", Garbage were not overly concerned with phrasing and pitch, giving it [...] "a rawer quality". Manson improved on her guitar skills and played more guitar in the studio and live on stage for the eventual tour.|$|E

Éole was described as being of 300 tons, carrying 16 guns, and having a crew of 125 men. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> from Cape François and was believed to be sailing to Jacquemel.|$|E

2500|$|Catherine {{paid for}} Blake's funeral with money lent {{to her by}} Linnell. He was buried five days after his death – {{on the eve of}} his 45th wedding anniversary – at the Dissenter's burial ground in Bunhill Fields, in what is today in the Borough of Islington, London. His parents were interred in the same grounds. Present at the ceremonies were Catherine, Edward Calvert, George Richmond, Frederick Tatham and John Linnell. Following Blake's death, Catherine moved into Tatham's house as a housekeeper. She {{believed}} she was regularly visited by Blake's spirit. She continued selling his illuminated works and paintings, but entertained no business transaction without first [...] "consulting Mr. Blake". On the day of her death, in October 1831, she was as calm and cheerful as her husband, and called out to him [...] "as if he were only in the next room, to say <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> to him, and it would not be long now".|$|E
2500|$|On March 21, 2005, Weise killed {{nine people}} before killing {{himself in a}} murder–suicide. With a [...]22 caliber pistol that he had {{acquired}} {{up to a year}} before the shooting, Weise first killed his grandfather, 58 year old Daryl Lussier Sr. while he was asleep in bed and his grandfather's girlfriend, 32 year old Michelle Sigana while <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> back upstairs from the basement with laundry. [...] He then took his grandfather's police issued firearms and drove his grandfather's police cruiser to the school. At the school, Weise shot and killed unarmed security guard Derrick Brun, 28, before going inside the school. Once inside, Weise fired randomly down a hallway and in a classroom, killing teacher Neva Wynkoop-Rogers, 62, and students Dewayne Lewis, 15; Chase Lussier, 15; Chanelle Rosebear, 15; Thurlene Stillday, 15, and Alicia White, 14. After engaging in a brief shootout with police and being injured in the hip and leg, Weise then retreated to another classroom and committed suicide using a shotgun.|$|E

[...] `Come, Smoky,' I said sharply, and she started through again. [...] When she was about 10 feet in, the string caught up and she looked over her {{shoulder}} as much as to say `what's holding us up there?' [...] The string loosened from the snag and she came on again. [...] By now the dust was rising from the shuffle of her paws as she crawled through the dirt and mold and I could no longer see her.

2500|$|Reese being {{introduced}} as Bianca's love interest {{was the first}} time an American soap opera would showcase same-sex partners having decided to create a child together. Riegel set up the Reese and Bianca storyline and what the couple's introduction entailed to newspaper New York Daily News. [...] "Zach is looking for Kendall," [...] she said. [...] "He is shocked to find Bianca. Nobody knew <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> to Pine Valley. Zach discovers Kendall's lifeless body and resuscitates her. Paramedics come, but they only have room in the vehicle for one person. Zach convinces them to take the kids, as well. He and Bianca wait." [...] This gave the series a chance to explain Bianca's return to the audience, as they saw Bianca, clearly pregnant, sit beside Zach. [...] "Zach agreed to be Bianca's [...] donor, but she failed to tell him that the pregnancy took," [...] explained Riegel. [...] "The reason she was not forthcoming is that Kendall was not told. Bianca came halfway across the world from France in the Cambias private jet - the only jet that can fly into a tornado - and didn't even get to tell Kendall the truth." ...|$|E
2500|$|Outhwaite {{has been}} asked {{numerous}} times {{about the possibility of}} Mel returning to EastEnders since her departure. At various stages she replied [...] "never say never" [...] when asked if she would return but also insisted the time was not right. Although she has always refused to rule out the possibility of a future return, in 2010 she pondered that a return would be unlikely as the character did not have links in the current cast, and that she had never been asked back anyway, stating: [...] "People always ask me, but I've never been asked! It looks like I'm turning it down on a yearly basis, but I'm not. They've never asked me! So they don't want me back for one and I don't have any family left on the show. There's nobody on the Square she knows, I don't even think any of Mel's friends are still in it ... I could walk down the market and be an extra, I suppose! [...] I don't know how Mel would return because there's no-one there for her to return to. She doesn't really know anyone apart from Ian Beale and Phil Mitchell. So unless <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> back to see one of them..." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2001, {{executive}} producer John Yorke decided to reintroduce the character once again. The {{decision was made}} to recast the role to another actress, Kim Medcalf, as Danniella Westbrook was still overcoming her drug problems at this time. During the audition process, EastEnders have said that they had to keep the part they were casting for [...] "top secret", meaning auditionees were not told about the part they were auditioning for until their actual interview. In the documentary, EastEnders Revealed - A Year In The Life Of Sam Mitchell, Medcalf has explained the audition process: [...] "They kind of sat me down and said 'actually we haven't been 100% truthful here, this [...] is not for...a new character at all, it's for the part of Sam Mitchell. Do you know who she is?' and I said, 'yes of course I do!' [...] Because my attitude was so laid back, it helped me a lot." [...] Producer Paul Annett has revealed: [...] "I saw Kim Medcalf along with two other actresses that had been short-listed, and I think almost immediately I knew that she was the right one." [...] Medcalf was an inexperienced actress, and her casting {{has been described as a}} [...] "big risk" [...] because of this. Annett has commented, [...] "she'd done...no television, secondly, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> into an immensely popular and beloved show, and the third thing was that she was taking over a role played by Danniella Westbrook...for [...]" [...] Medcalf revealed that she had reservations about taking on a role that was associated with another actress: [...] "I said 'that's going to be hard' [...] but they said 'we think we can do it, we're going to write it in quite cleverly, and part of it will be that we meet Sam away from Walford'." [...] She added, [...] "It was scary finding out I'd be taking over someone else's character because you wonder whether the public will accept it. I loved the show so I just decided to go for it". Commenting on Medcalf's casting, Sam's original actress Danniella Westbrook said, [...] "I wish her all the luck in the world. It's a great part and I'm sure she'll be great." ...|$|E
