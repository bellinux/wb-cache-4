50|$|The {{importance}} of the Silver Studio’s influence internationally is indicated {{by the fact that}} in the early 1900s, around two thirds of the Studio’s designs were sold to French and Belgian textile manufacturers, including Bergert Dupont et Cie, Dumas, Florquin, Gros Roman, Zuber Cie, Vanoutryve, Parison and Leborgne. Continental manufacturers were thus able to gain immediate access to the popular “Style Anglais” by purchasing Silver Studio designs, and the work of the Silver Studio undoubtedly helped to enhance the reputation of British designers abroad.During the 1890s, Arthur Silver was also heavily interested in and influenced by the art of Japan. He worked closely with Alexander Rottman who imported many different varieties of paper from Japan. With Rottman, the Silver Studio developed a pioneering technique of <b>stencil</b> <b>decoration,</b> influenced by Japanese stencils, which in turn came to influence the Studio’s own Art Nouveau designs. Anglo-Japanese collaboration of this kind in the 1890s meant that Japanese influences were absorbed into British design and decoration, and equally that British tastes influenced the products of Japan itself.|$|E

5000|$|The main {{living room}} or [...] "kitchen" [...] is an addition, dating from around 1680, {{as is the}} wooden {{staircase}} and sleeping area above it. The walls {{of the dining room}} (originally the only ground-floor room) are painted with a <b>stencilled</b> <b>decoration</b> of a type which pre-dates the general use of wallpaper. [...] This room was used as the interior of Captain Blamey's cottage in the filming of the BBC's 2015 drama series, Poldark.|$|R
50|$|The church {{occupies}} a lot between Summer and Pleasant Streets a short way west of downtown Augusta. It is {{built out of}} quarry-faced granite, with a gable-roofed main section oriented east-west and two south-facing gabled projections. The western of the two projections has a tall square tower, with buttressed corners, belfry, and pyramidal roof topped by a cross. Windows are either lancet-arched in the Gothic style, or rectangular, and are decorated with tracery. The interior includes marble columns and detailed high-quality woodwork. The chancel ceiling has original <b>stencil</b> <b>decorations.</b>|$|R
50|$|An overmantel with arched {{panels and}} Wylde {{heraldry}} dated c. 1594 has been relocated to the north-west {{room of the}} garden wing. The principal items of architectural interest are the Great Hall, 1470s, a good staircase of about 1600 and in a separate wing the Solar of similar detail to the hall. A remarkable survival is a painted chamber with <b>stencilled</b> <b>decoration</b> and wall paintings of religious subjects {{believed to have been}} made about 1490 and rediscovered in 1935: ceiling - the Trinity; north wall - St Michael weighing souls; south wall - martyrdom of St Erasmus and St Thomas Becket. There is more.|$|R

The ceiling of the apse has painted and <b>stencilled</b> <b>decoration.</b> The richly decorated alabaster reredos contains paintings with gold backgrounds depicting the Nativity, the Annunciation, and the Assumption. These have been attributed to J. A. Pippet of Hardman & Co. In front of the reredos is a richly-carved altar and benediction throne under an elaborate canopy. [...] The two-manual pipe organ was made in about 1880 by Wadsworth of Manchester.|$|R
50|$|Inside {{the church}} is a four-bay arcade in the nave, and a two-bay arcade n the chancel. The chancel walls have <b>stencil</b> <b>decorations</b> by Bodley. To {{the right of the}} altar is a piscina and a triple sedilia with trefoil heads and crocketted gables, and there is a similar niche {{to the left of the}} altar. The chancel floor is tiled. The stained glass in the east window is by Lavers, Barraud and Westlake, dating from about 1868, and there is more 19th-century stained glass {{elsewhere}} in the church.

5000|$|The Insole Court Trust {{was awarded}} £2m {{funding from the}} Heritage Lottery Fund and £750,000 from the Big Lottery and Welsh Government, to restore and redevelop Insole Court into a visitor attraction. The £4 million project started in December 2014, During restoration, {{beautiful}} <b>stencilling</b> and <b>decoration</b> {{was found on the}} walls throughout the house, which were believed to date to the 1870s. Newly built Room Hire facilities, 'The Stable Yard' and the Potting Shed Café opened in September 2016.|$|R
50|$|Inside {{the farms}} houses of Hälsingland are {{magnificent}} and well-preserved interiors with art {{painted on the}} walls, <b>stencilled</b> wall <b>decorations,</b> and expensive wallpaper. Biblical motifs were transformed into Hälsingland milieu, funny stories and cautionary tales mixed in the artwork with the decorative style of the wandering painters from Dalarna, characterized by religious motifs, ribbons and large flowers. Expensive, imported wallpaper was combined with popular painting into something entirely new, and the stencilled paintings in many places flowed onto walls, ceilings and fireplaces. The amount of well-preserved interiors kept in its original site, is unique in the world.|$|R
50|$|The stencil {{painting}} in the Dutton House {{can be found in}} the front four rooms and, by and large, is only found along the outer borders of the plaster walls, dating to about 1800. A sunburst is painted over the fireplace mantle in one of the second floor rooms, and is the only plaster replaced in the house after the move from Cavendish. Samples of each of the borders from the four rooms were removed and served as guides when the house was re-erected in Shelburne. Motifs used in the Dutton House borders are found in other houses in Massachusetts, Vermont and New Hampshire. One of the motifs, a freehand decoration used in a first floor room, is also found in the Grimes House in Keene, New Hampshire. The <b>stencil</b> painted <b>decoration</b> in that house has been attributed to either Jothan Stearns or Jedutham Bullin, thus one of them may have painted the Dutton House interiors.|$|R
