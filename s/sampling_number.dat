Because of the hardware and power supply limitations, wireless sensors are applied to discrete event control system. In wireless sensor network the highest <b>sample</b> <b>number</b> is restricted {{in comparison to the}} wired one. Moreover, the lowest <b>sample</b> <b>number</b> is also constrained by the limitations imposed by the control limits values. In this paper, relations between <b>sample</b> <b>number</b> and actuator’s frequency drift in discrete domain is formulated and presented. The central and autonomous sensor network structures are introduced. In addition, ways to compromise the <b>sample</b> <b>number</b> with the actuator’s frequency and control limits value are acknowledged.

40|$|In limited-view {{computed}} tomography reconstruction, iterative image reconstruction with sparsity-exploiting methods, such as total variation (TV) minimization, inspired by compressive sensing, potentially claims large reductions in sampling requirements. However, a quantitative notion of this claim is non-trivial {{because of the}} ill-defined reduction in sampling achieved by the sparsity-exploiting method. In this paper, exact reconstruction sampling condition for limited-view problem is studied by verifying the uniqueness of solution in TV minimization model. Uniqueness is tested by solving a convex optimization problem derived from the sufficient and necessary condition of solution uniqueness. Through this method, the sufficient <b>sampling</b> <b>number</b> of exact reconstruction is quantified for any fixed phantom and settled geometrical parameter in the limited-view problem. This paper provides a reference to quantify the sampling condition. Using Shepp-Logan phantom as an example, the experiment results show the quantified <b>sampling</b> <b>number</b> and indicate that an object would be accurately reconstructed as the scanning range becomes narrower by increasing <b>sampling</b> <b>number.</b> The increased samplings compensate for the deficiency of the projection angle. However, a lower bound of the scanning range is presented, in which an exact reconstruction cannot be obtained once the projection angle is narrowed to this extent no matter how to increase sampling...|$|E

An optimization problem on the Grassmann manifold is formulated for projection matrix completion, and an iterative gradient descend line-search al-gorithm on the Grassmann manifold (GGDLS) is proposed to solve such optimization problem. The convergence of the proposed al-gorithm has theoretical guarantee, and numerical experiments ver-ify that the required <b>sampling</b> <b>number</b> for successful recovery with probability 1 is 2 s(N − s) in the noiseless cases. Compared with some reference algorithms, in the noiseless scenario, the proposed algorithm is very time efficient, and the required <b>sampling</b> <b>number</b> is rather small for successful recovery.

40|$|Cities are {{increasingly}} vulnerable to floods generated by intense rainfall, {{because of their}} high degree of imperviousness, implementation of infrastructures, and changes in precipitation patterns due to climate change. Accurate information of convective storm characteristics at high spatial and temporal resolution is a crucial input for urban hydrological models {{to be able to}} simulate fast runoff processes and enhance flood prediction. In this paper, a detailed study of the sensitivity of urban hydrological response to high resolution radar rainfall was conducted. Rainfall rates derived from X-band dual polarimetric weather radar for four rainstorms were used as input into a detailed hydrodynamic sewer model for an urban catchment in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Dimensionless parameters were derived to compare results between different storm conditions and to describe the effect of rainfall spatial resolution in relation to storm and hydrodynamic model properties: rainfall <b>sampling</b> <b>number</b> (rainfall resolution vs. storm size), catchment <b>sampling</b> <b>number</b> (rainfall resolution vs. catchment size), runoff and sewer <b>sampling</b> <b>number</b> (rainfall resolution vs. runoff and sewer model resolution respectively). Results show catchment smearing effect for rainfall resolution approaching half the catchment size, i. e. for catchments sampling numbers greater than 0. 5 averaged rainfall volumes decrease about 20 %. Moreover, deviations in maximum water depths, form 10 to 30 % depending on the storm, occur for rainfall resolution close to storm size, describing storm smearing effect due to rainfall coarsening. Model results also show the sensitivity of modelled runoff peaks and maximum water depths to the resolution of the runoff areas and sewer density respectively. Sensitivity to temporal resolution of rainfall input seems low compared to spatial resolution, for the storms analysed in this study. Findings are in agreement with previous studies on natural catchments, thus the sampling numbers seem to be promising as an approach to describe sensitivity of hydrological response to rainfall variability for intra-urban catchments and local convective storms. More storms and different urban catchments of varying characteristics need to be analysed in order to validate these findings. Water ManagementCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

40|$|Cities are {{increasingly}} vulnerable to floods generated by intense rainfall, because of urbanisation of flood-prone areas and ongoing urban densification. Accurate information of convective storm characteristics at high {{spatial and temporal}} resolution is a crucial input for urban hydrological models {{to be able to}} simulate fast runoff processes and enhance flood prediction in cities. In this paper, a detailed study of the sensitivity of urban hydrodynamic response to high resolution radar rainfall was conducted. Rainfall rates derived from X-band dual polarimetric weather radar were used as input into a detailed hydrodynamic sewer model for an urban catchment in the city of Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The aim was to characterise how the effect of space and time aggregation on rainfall structure affects hydrodynamic modelling of urban catchments, for resolutions ranging from 100 to 2000 m and from 1 to 10 min. Dimensionless parameters were derived to compare results between different storm conditions and to describe the effect of rainfall spatial resolution in relation to storm characteristics and hydrodynamic model properties: rainfall <b>sampling</b> <b>number</b> (rainfall resolution vs. storm size), catchment <b>sampling</b> <b>number</b> (rainfall resolution vs. catchment size), runoff and sewer <b>sampling</b> <b>number</b> (rainfall resolution vs. runoff and sewer model resolution respectively). Results show that for rainfall resolution lower than half the catchment size, rainfall volumes mean and standard deviations decrease as a result of smoothing of rainfall gradients. Moreover, deviations in maximum water depths, from 10 to 30 % depending on the storm, occurred for rainfall resolution close to storm size, as a result of rainfall aggregation. Model results also showed that modelled runoff peaks are more sensitive to rainfall resolution than maximum in-sewer water depths as flow routing has a damping effect on in-sewer water level variations. Temporal resolution aggregation of rainfall inputs led to increase in de-correlation lengths and resulted in time shift in modelled flow peaks by several minutes. Sensitivity to temporal resolution of rainfall inputs was low compared to spatial resolution, for the storms analysed in this study...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The urinary {{proteome}} {{has been}} widely used for biomarker discovery. A urinary proteome database from normal humans can provide a background for discovery proteomics and candidate proteins/peptides for targeted proteomics. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} define the minimum number of individuals required for sampling to represent the normal urinary proteome. Methods In this study, inter-individual and inter-gender variations of urinary proteome were taken into consideration to achieve a representative database. An individual analysis was performed on overnight urine samples from 20 normal volunteers (10 males and 10 females) by 1 DLC/MS/MS. To obtain a representative result of each sample, a replicate 1 DLCMS/MS analysis was performed. The minimal <b>sample</b> <b>number</b> was estimated by statistical analysis. Results For qualitative analysis, less than 5 % of new proteins/peptides were identified in a male/female normal group by adding a new sample when the <b>sample</b> <b>number</b> exceeded nine. In addition, in a normal group, the percentage of newly identified proteins/peptides was less than 5 % upon adding a new sample when the <b>sample</b> <b>number</b> reached 10. Furthermore, a statistical analysis indicated that urinary proteomes from normal males and females showed different patterns. For quantitative analysis, the variation of protein abundance was defined by spectrum count and western blotting methods. And then the minimal <b>sample</b> <b>number</b> for quantitative proteomic analysis was identified. Conclusions For qualitative analysis, when considering the inter-individual and inter-gender variations, the minimum <b>sample</b> <b>number</b> is 10 and requires a balanced number of males and females in order to obtain a representative normal human urinary proteome. For quantitative analysis, the minimal <b>sample</b> <b>number</b> is much greater than that for qualitative analysis and depends on the experimental methods used for quantification. </p...|$|R
