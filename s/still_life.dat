5|$|During {{the years}} 1925–35, Jolin's style is {{characterized}} by light, soft, grey notes and pastels. Later on, <b>still</b> <b>life</b> featuring Oriental porcelain, preferably displayed on a reflecting mahogany tabletop, became a more common motif. He also painted numerous portraits of the Swedish socialites at that time.|$|E
5|$|Grasshoppers are {{occasionally}} {{depicted in}} artworks, {{such as the}} Dutch Golden Age painter Balthasar van der Ast's <b>still</b> <b>life</b> oil painting, Flowers in a Vase with Shells and Insects, c. 1630, now in the National Gallery, London, though the insect may be a bush-cricket.|$|E

50|$|A {{great number}} of Coosemans' <b>still</b> <b>lifes</b> can be {{characterized}} as 'vanitas' <b>still</b> <b>lifes</b> and 'pronkstillevens' (ostentatious <b>still</b> <b>lifes).</b> The <b>still</b> <b>lifes</b> are believed to carry a moralistic, hidden meaning.|$|R

5|$|As well as {{spending}} time in Sydney's art community, in 1954 Haefliger and Bellette purchased a cottage in Hill End, an old gold mining village in central New South Wales. They added a studio, and the site became both a weekender and a venue for social visits and artistic endeavours by colleagues from the Sydney circle, including Drysdale, Margaret Olley, John Olsen, David Edgar Strachan and Donald Friend. This gathering of artists, {{sometimes referred to as}} the Hill End Group, is known for its landscape art. Bellette, though sometimes a painter of landscapes, was known for her classical subjects and still lifes, which critics struggled to accommodate within their understanding of the Hill End Group. Nevertheless, several still lifes from this period are held in public collections, including <b>Still</b> <b>Life</b> with Fish (1954), in the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery, and <b>Still</b> <b>life</b> with wooden bowl (c. 1954), in the Art Gallery of New South Wales. These images were often rendered with strong colour, which was also sometimes a feature of earlier works on which critics would remark.|$|E
5|$|When Lichtenstein had {{his first}} solo show at the Leo Castelli Gallery in February 1962, it sold out before opening. Golf Ball {{was one of the}} works that Lichtenstein exhibited. Later, Lichtenstein {{included}} Golf Ball in <b>Still</b> <b>Life</b> with Goldfish Bowl, 1972, and Go for Baroque, 1979. The painting exemplifies the novel superimposition of abstraction and figuration. The work also represents abstraction as a result of elimination of three-dimensionality, chiaroscuro and a landscape context.|$|E
50|$|Carstian Luyckx, {{also known}} as the Monogrammist KL (1623 - c. 1675), was a Flemish painter and {{draughtsman}} who specialized in <b>still</b> <b>lifes</b> in various subgenres including flower <b>still</b> <b>lifes,</b> fruit <b>still</b> <b>lifes,</b> fish <b>still</b> <b>lifes,</b> pronkstillevens (sumptuous <b>still</b> <b>lifes),</b> vanitas <b>still</b> <b>lifes,</b> hunting pieces and garland paintings. He also painted animals and a few genre scenes. After starting his career in Antwerp he is believed to have worked later in France.|$|R
5000|$|De Bryer painted fruit <b>still</b> <b>lifes,</b> vanitas <b>still</b> <b>lifes</b> and pronkstillevens, i.e. sumptuous <b>still</b> <b>lifes</b> of luxurious objects. [...] His dated {{works are}} 10 <b>still</b> <b>lifes,</b> which bear dates between 1651 and 1658. [...] He signed Bryer or Brier.|$|R
5000|$|De Coninck painted <b>still</b> <b>lifes,</b> {{including}} fruit <b>still</b> <b>lifes</b> {{and hunting}} <b>still</b> <b>lifes,</b> landscapes with hunting scenes and architectural paintings. [...] De Coninck's stylistic development is unclear {{and it is}} difficult to date his paintings with any precision. It is possible that early in his career he painted fruit <b>still</b> <b>lifes,</b> since there is a record that in 1668 two fruit <b>still</b> <b>lifes</b> made by a 'Koninck' were exported to Vienna.|$|R
5|$|Many {{paintings}} can {{be found}} in the museums of Europe depicting tulips with attractive coloured stripes. Most, such as the <b>still</b> <b>life</b> studies of Johannes Bosschaert, were painted during the 17th century. These flowers were particularly popular and became sought after by those who could afford them. At the peak of this tulip mania in the 1630s, one bulb could cost as much as a house. It was not known at the time that the stripes were caused by a virus accidentally transferred by humans to tulips from jasmine. Weakened by the virus, the plants turned out to be a poor investment. Only a few bulbs produced flowers with the attractive characteristics of their parent plants.|$|E
5|$|Martin, Odlyzko, and Wolfram {{investigate}} pseudoforests {{that model}} {{the dynamics of}} cellular automata. These functional graphs, which they call state transition diagrams, have one vertex for each possible configuration that the ensemble of cells of the automaton can be in, and an edge connecting each configuration to the configuration that follows it according to the automaton's rule. One can infer properties of the automaton from the structure of these diagrams, such {{as the number of}} components, length of limiting cycles, depth of the trees connecting non-limiting states to these cycles, or symmetries of the diagram. For instance, any vertex with no incoming edge corresponds to a Garden of Eden pattern and a vertex with a self-loop corresponds to a <b>still</b> <b>life</b> pattern.|$|E
5|$|The {{reformed}} band {{worked at}} a prolific pace, rehearsing, and touring France before recording three new albums in just 12 months, beginning with Godbluff (October 1975). Unlike the earlier work with John Anthony at Trident, the sessions were produced by the band themselves, and both the Melody Maker and Sounds thought they were a tighter and more cohesive unit than previously. The album in particular saw Hammill making significant use of the Hohner clavinet keyboard. <b>Still</b> <b>Life</b> followed on 15 April 1976. Banton considers this album one of his favourites by the group.|$|E
5000|$|Jan van der Heyden painted <b>still</b> <b>lifes</b> in the {{beginning}} {{and at the end}} of his career. Nine of his <b>still</b> <b>lifes</b> survive. One of his earliest dated <b>still</b> <b>lifes</b> is a [...] (signed and dated 1664, Mauritshuis). This and other early <b>still</b> <b>lifes</b> typically depict a bible and other objects on a table with a carpet.|$|R
50|$|He {{is mainly}} {{known for his}} genre scenes and <b>still</b> <b>lifes</b> but also painted mythological and Christian {{religious}} scenes. His <b>still</b> <b>lifes</b> are mainly <b>still</b> <b>lifes</b> of armour {{in addition to a}} few hunting pieces.|$|R
50|$|About 100 {{works have}} been {{attributed}} to the Pseudo-Simons. None of the works are signed. These works are principally fruit <b>still</b> <b>lifes,</b> and some flower <b>still</b> <b>lifes</b> and pronkstillevens (i.e. sumptuous <b>still</b> <b>lifes</b> of luxurious objects).|$|R
5|$|With {{the birth}} of his first {{daughter}}, Michaela, in 1958, Jolin settled down to a more quiet life as a father and family man. His second daughter Angelina was born in 1966. He continued to paint, mostly <b>still</b> <b>life</b> and portraits, at his studio apartment at Stagneliusvägen 34, in Fredhäll. He spent most summers with his family in Tällberg in the Dalarna County or at Villa San Michele on the island of Capri. Although he held some minor exhibitions, his work from the 1960s to his death in 1976, did not receive the same acclaim as his earlier paintings.|$|E
5|$|Although {{depicted}} {{with the}} tower in a Rand McNally map from 1893, later lithographs {{of the first}} 141 Jackson Street location display a red-roofed building without a tower. Memorabilia of the current building is abundant, with postcards of panoramic scenes from LaSalle Street, the clock, and lighted upper decks having been produced for decades. In views from the Museum Campus, the building's crown is framed by the middle floors of the taller Sears Tower in the background. Photographer Andreas Gursky has used the location for <b>still</b> <b>life</b> prints such as 1997's Chicago Board of Trade, I and 1999's Chicago Board of Trade, II. A photograph of the exterior, from the Museum series by Thomas Struth, is {{in the collection of}} the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. An often-reproduced painting by Leslie Ragan for the New York Central Railroad depicts streamliner locomotives idling at LaSalle Street Station with the Board of Trade Building looming prominently in the background.|$|E
5|$|The {{group of}} artists {{connected}} with Edinburgh, {{most of whom}} had studied at Edinburgh College of Art during or soon after the First World War, {{became known as the}} Edinburgh School, many of whom belonged to the informal 1922 Group. They were influenced by French painters and the St. Ives School. Their art was characterised by use of vivid and often non-naturalistic colour and the use of bold technique above form. Members included William Gillies (1898–1973), who focused on landscapes and <b>still</b> <b>life,</b> John Maxwell (1905–62) who created both landscapes and studies of imaginative subjects, William Geissler (1894-1963), watercolourist of landscapes in Perthshire, East Lothian and Hampshire, William Crozier (1893–1930), whose landscapes were created with glowing colours, William MacTaggart (1903–81), noted for his landscapes of East Lothian, France and Norway and Anne Redpath (1895–1965), best known for her two dimensional depictions of everyday objects.|$|E
5000|$|Boel principally painted <b>still</b> <b>lifes</b> {{including}} flower <b>still</b> <b>lifes,</b> hunting <b>still</b> <b>lifes,</b> {{animal and}} fish <b>still</b> <b>lifes,</b> vanitas paintings and <b>still</b> <b>lifes</b> of weapons. He also painted some landscapes. [...] Since {{most of his}} works are undated, {{it is difficult to}} establish a chronology for his work. Boel achieved a very high quality in his work. It is believed that a number of his compositions may have had their signature removed so that they could pass as works by Frans Snyders or his master Jan Fyt. Only recently a number of <b>still</b> <b>lifes</b> in museums, which were formerly given to Fyt, have been reattributed to Pieter Boel.|$|R
50|$|He painted mainly genre {{scenes and}} <b>still</b> <b>lifes.</b> The genre scenes cover {{the whole range}} of farm, kitchen and market scenes often {{including}} <b>still</b> <b>lifes</b> of food, game and fruit. He also painted <b>still</b> <b>lifes</b> of game, fish, food and flowers.|$|R

5|$|Many Scottish {{painters}} {{of the early}} part of the eighteenth century remained largely artisans. Roderick Chalmers' (fl. 1709–30) painting The Edinburgh Trades (1720) shows the artist himself, perhaps ironically, among the glaziers, wrights and masons of the burgh. Thomas Warrender (fl. 1673–1713) produced the Allegorical <b>Still</b> <b>Life</b> (after 1708), of a letter board that seems to be a commentary on the union of 1707, but he made his living as a house decorator, working closely with architects, including William Adam. He may have trained James Norie (1684–1757), who with his sons James (1711–36) and Robert (d. 1766), painted the houses of the peerage with Scottish landscapes that were pastiches of Italian and Dutch landscapes. They tutored many artists and have been credited with the inception of the tradition of Scottish landscape painting that would come to fruition from the late eighteenth century. The painters Allan Ramsay (1713–84), Gavin Hamilton (1723–98), the brothers John (1744–68/9) and Alexander Runciman (1736–85), Jacob More (1740–93) and David Allan (1744–96), mostly began in the tradition of the Nories, but were artists of European significance, spending considerable portions of their careers outside Scotland. Henry Raeburn (1756–1823) was the most significant artist of the period to pursue his entire career in Scotland, born in Edinburgh and returning there after a trip to Italy in 1786.|$|E
5|$|Åkerfeldt and Lindgren, the two {{remaining}} members of the band, asked drummer Martin Lopez and bassist Martín Méndez to join the band, both of whom accepted. In 1999, they released the concept album <b>Still</b> <b>Life.</b> Steven Wilson joined Opeth in the studio for their fifth album, 2001's Blackwater Park, producing and providing extra backing vocals and instruments. The band supported the album with their first worldwide tour. After promoting the album, Opeth entered the studio again, recording two albums. The first album, Deliverance that was released in 2002, debuted at number 19 on the Top Heatseekers in the United States. The second album, Damnation was released a year later, and peaked at number 192 on the Billboard 200. Per Wiberg joined the band as a keyboardist and recorded Ghost Reveries, which peaked at number 64 on the Billboard 200. Lopez and Lindgren both left Opeth and were replaced by Martin Axenrot and Fredrik Åkesson. In 2008, the band released their ninth studio album Watershed, which debuted at number 23 on the Billboard 200 and peaked {{at the top of}} the Finnish charts. Their tenth studio album Heritage which released in 2011, debuted at number 19 on the Billboard 200, at number 2 on the US Hard Rock Albums and at number 6 on the Rock Albums charts, making it highest charting record to date. The album also peaked at number 22 on the UK Albums chart.|$|E
