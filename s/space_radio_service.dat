40|$|The {{existing}} and future {{use of the}} electromagnetic spectrum from 40 to 300 gigahertz is discussed. The activities envisioned for this segment {{of the electromagnetic spectrum}} fall generically into two basic categories: communications and remote sensing. The communications services considered for this region are focused on the {{existing and}} future frequency allocations that are required for terrestrial <b>radio</b> <b>services,</b> <b>space</b> to ground <b>radio</b> <b>services,</b> <b>space</b> to <b>space</b> <b>radio</b> <b>services,</b> and <b>space</b> to deep <b>space</b> <b>radio</b> <b>services.</b> The remote sensing services considered for this region are divided into two groups of activities: earth viewing and space viewing...|$|R
40|$|The 1985 World Administrative Radio Conference (WARC-ORB- 85) {{was held}} to {{determine}} which <b>space</b> <b>radio</b> <b>services</b> should be planned and which planning methods should be used. The second session of this Conference (WARC-ORB- 88) will meet to develop the required plans. This paper {{presents the results of}} WARC-ORB- 85, assesses the impact of those decisions, and identifies the intersessional work to be conducted by administrations and the CCIR (Consultative Committee on International Radio). The major decisions of WARC-ORB- 85 were: (1) the restriction of additional planning to the fixed satellite service at identified frequencies; and (2) the selection of a planning method consisting of two parts (a) an allotment plan, and (b) improved procedures. The paper also discusses WARC-ORB- 85 decisions relative to the Region 2 broadcast satellite service plans at 12 GHz, feederlink planning for Regions 1 and 3 broadcast satellites at 12 GHz, and sound broadcast satellite service...|$|R

These services include receiver gain control, frequency offset, IQ modulator balance, and transmit level control. Development, integration, and environmental testing of the <b>radio</b> <b>services</b> will be described. The added software allows the waveform application to operate properly in the space environment, and can be reused by future experimenters testing different waveform applications. Integrating such services with the platform provided STRS operating environment will attract more users, and these services are candidates for interface standardization via STRS...|$|R

During the Axis occupation of Greece, the service was renamed as the Limited Hellenic Radio Company or AERE (Ανώνυμη Ελληνική Ραδιοφωνική Εταιρεία, ΑΕΡΕ). After Liberation, in 1945 the service was reorganized as the National Radio Foundation or EIR (Εθνικό Ίδρυμα Ραδιοφωνίας, ΕΙΡ), still based at Zappeion. The <b>radio</b> <b>services</b> were expanded to three national <b>radio</b> <b>services</b> as well as international <b>radio</b> <b>services</b> for emigrant Greeks.

50|$|A {{personal}} <b>radio</b> <b>service</b> is {{any system}} that allows individual to operate radio transmitters and receivers for personal purposes with minimal or no special license or individual authorization. Personal <b>radio</b> <b>services</b> exist {{around the world and}} typically use light-weight walkie talkie portable radios. The power output, antenna size, and technical characteristics of the equipment are set by regulations in each country. Many regions (for example, the European Union) have standardized personal <b>radio</b> <b>service</b> rules to allow travelers from one country to use their equipment in another country. Examples of standardized services include PMR446 and FM Citizens Band Radio (CB) in the EU and several other countries/regions. 26-27 MHz CB radio is the oldest personal <b>radio</b> <b>service</b> and is used in nearly every country worldwide, with many countries and regions copying the United States 40-channel frequency plan. In many countries, CB radio is less popular due to the availability of other personal <b>radio</b> <b>services</b> that offer shorter antennas, better protection from noise and interference.|$|R
