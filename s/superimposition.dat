5|$|Chronophotograpic {{studies of}} animals in motion, created by {{scientist}} Étienne-Jules Marey beginning in the 1880s, led to the introduction in painting of techniques to show motion, such as blurring, multiplication, and <b>superimposition</b> of body parts—perhaps {{in an effort to}} imitate these mechanical images. Such multiplication can be see in Marcel Duchamp's Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2, painted the same year as Balla's painting.|$|E
5|$|Three centuries {{after the}} death of the Buddha (c. 150 BCE) saw the growth of a large body of {{literature}} called the Abhidharma in several contending Buddhist schools. In the Abdhidharmic analysis of mind, the ordinary thought is defined as prapañca ('conceptual proliferation'). According to this theory, perceptual experience is bound up in multiple conceptualizations (expectations, judgments and desires). This proliferation of conceptualizations form our illusory <b>superimposition</b> of concepts like self and other upon an ever changing stream of aggregate phenomena.|$|E
5|$|When Lichtenstein had {{his first}} solo show at the Leo Castelli Gallery in February 1962, it sold out before opening. Golf Ball {{was one of the}} works that Lichtenstein exhibited. Later, Lichtenstein {{included}} Golf Ball in Still Life with Goldfish Bowl, 1972, and Go for Baroque, 1979. The painting exemplifies the novel <b>superimposition</b> of abstraction and figuration. The work also represents abstraction as a result of elimination of three-dimensionality, chiaroscuro and a landscape context.|$|E
40|$|Summary. A new {{technique}} for computer aided radiograph <b>superimpositioning</b> has been developed, based on simple mathematical calculations. It {{can be used}} for direct <b>superimpositioning</b> of radiographs or indirect <b>superimpositioning</b> by means of tracings. This method eliminates the tedious job of punching holes, described by Baumrind and Frantz (1971). The validity of the method was tested by comparing the error of registration with the error of <b>superimpositioning</b> on the cranial base...|$|R
40|$|Parker's (1959) first {{example of}} a 10 x 10 Graeco-Latin square {{incorporates}} 4 balanced <b>superimpositions</b> of 3 x 7 Youden squares. Such <b>superimpositions</b> of size a x (2 s + 1), where s is odd and (2 s + 1) is prime, can be of two types, distinguished by the values taken by an invariant formed from the incidence matrices for the <b>superimpositions.</b> All four of the <b>superimpositions</b> in Parker's example are of Type 1. We now give 10 x 10 Graeco-Lattin squares similar to Parker's, but with x(= 0, 2, 3) <b>superimpositions</b> of Type 1 and 4 - x of Type 2. Our 10 x 10 examples with x = 0, 2, 3 and 4 are shown to be special cases of constructions for Graeco-Latin squares of order 3 s + 1; Graeco-Latin squares with x = 1 are shown to be impossible...|$|R

5|$|The film's visual style {{includes}} abrupt cuts, rapid camera movement, extensive <b>superimposition,</b> dim lighting, {{and shapes}} and forms in twisted and disoriented angles. Filmed {{with a budget}} of only $97 ($ in today's dollars), it includes a combination of close-ups of live actors and long shots of miniature sets, which were made from such items as cardboard, paper cubes, tin cans, cigar boxes, and toy trains. With no access to Hollywood studios or equipment, most of the filming {{took place in the}} filmmakers' residences, with walls painted black for use as a background.|$|E
5|$|The {{tape loops}} were played on BTR3 tape {{machines}} located in various studios of the Abbey Road building {{and controlled by}} EMI technicians in Studio Two at Abbey Road on 7 April. Each machine was monitored by one technician, who had to hold a pencil within each loop to maintain tension. The four Beatles controlled the faders of the mixing console while Martin varied the stereo panning and Emerick watched the meters. Eight of the tapes were used at one time, changed halfway through the song. The tapes were made (like {{most of the other}} loops) by <b>superimposition</b> and acceleration. According to Martin, the finished mix of the tape loops could not be repeated because of the complex and random way in which they were laid over the music.|$|E
25|$|In combinatorics, two n×n Latin squares {{are said}} to be {{orthogonal}} if their <b>superimposition</b> yields all possible n2 combinations of entries.|$|E

25|$|Another type {{of optical}} {{illusion}} exploits broken patterns to trick the mind into perceiving symmetries or asymmetries {{that are not}} present. Examples include the café wall, Ehrenstein, Fraser spiral, Poggendorff, and Zöllner illusions. Related, but not strictly illusions, are patterns that occur due to the <b>superimposition</b> of periodic structures. For example, transparent tissues with a grid structure produce shapes known as moiré patterns, while the <b>superimposition</b> of periodic transparent patterns comprising parallel opaque lines or curves produces line moiré patterns.|$|E
25|$|Persian music {{includes}} a mixed Persian-Western music that functions as popular commercial music. The use of western popular rhythms, an elementary harmonic <b>superimposition,</b> and relatively large ensembles composed of mostly western instruments, characterize this music. The melodic and modal aspects of these compositions maintain basically Persian elements.|$|E
25|$|By June 1934, Kazimierowski had {{finished}} painting the image {{based on the}} direction of Faustina and Father Sopoćko. That was the only Divine Mercy painting Faustina saw. A <b>superimposition</b> of the face of Jesus in the Image of the Divine Mercy upon that in the already well-known Shroud of Turin shows great similarity. This original Kazimirowski (Vilnius) Image, which was painted {{under the guidance of}} Saint Faustina in 1934, is once again becoming the most venerated Image of the Divine Mercy.|$|E

25|$|The {{most notable}} {{has been the}} work {{undertaken}} by amateur archaeologist Grahame Walsh, who began work there in 1977 and returned to record and locate new sites up {{until his death in}} 2007. The results of this work produced a database of 1.5 million rock art images and recordings of 1,500 new rock art sites. He expanded his records by studying <b>superimposition</b> and style sequences of the paintings to establish a chronology that demonstrated that Bradshaw art is found early in the Kimberley rock art sequence. He proposed that the art dated to a period prior to the Pleistocene.|$|E
25|$|One clear {{result of}} the renewal of the Anglo-French contest in the East Indies between 1778–1783 was a greater {{appreciation}} by the British of the strategic needs of their newly acquired possessions in Asia. The <b>superimposition</b> of a global struggle between European powers upon several localised Indian wars did unnerve the Company and seriously embarrass its presidencies. Furthermore, the war exposed the rival geo-political ambitions of the French and these in turn provoked the more stolid, unreflecting British to formulate their own logic of empire. When word reached India in 1778 that France had entered the war, the British East India Company moved quickly to capture French colonial outposts there, notably capturing Pondicherry after two months of siege.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} central qualities shared by African music and jazz, most {{prominently}} {{the importance of}} improvisation. Some instrumental qualities from African music that appear in jazz (especially its drumming) include using unpitched instruments to produce specific musical tones or tone-like qualities, using all instruments to imitate the human voice, <b>superimposition</b> of one rhythmic structure onto another (e.g., {{a group of three}} against a group of two), dividing a regular section of time (called a measure in musical terms) into groups of two and three, and the use of repetitive rhythms used throughout a musical piece, often called clave rhythms. This last quality is one of special importance, as there are several pronounced occurrences of this pattern and the aesthetics that accompany it in the world of jazz.|$|E
50|$|While most of {{the film}} was shot indoors, the nuptial cortege scene near the end was filmed {{outdoors}} in Méliès's garden, with a real horse.

25|$|The World at One, a lunchtime news programme, {{began on}} 4 October 1965 on the then Home Service, {{and the year}} before News Review had started on television. News Review was {{a summary of the}} week's news, first {{broadcast}} on Sunday, 26 April 1964 on BBC 2 and harking back to the weekly Newsreel Review of the Week, produced from 1951, to open programming on Sunday evenings–the difference being that this incarnation had subtitles for the deaf and hard-of-hearing. As this was the decade before electronic caption generation, each <b>superimposition</b> ("super") had to be produced on paper or card, synchronised manually to studio and news footage, committed to tape during the afternoon, and broadcast early evening. Thus Sundays were no longer a quiet day for news at Alexandra Palace. The programme ran until the 1980s by then using electronic captions, known as Anchor to be superseded by Ceefax subtitling (a similar Teletext format), and the signing of such programmes as See Hear (from 1981).|$|E
25|$|Cage's {{work from}} the sixties {{features}} some of his largest and most ambitious, not to mention socially utopian pieces, reflecting {{the mood of the}} era yet also his absorption of the writings of both Marshall McLuhan, on the effects of new media, and R. Buckminster Fuller, on the power of technology to promote social change. HPSCHD (1969), a gargantuan and long-running multimedia work made in collaboration with Lejaren Hiller, incorporated the mass <b>superimposition</b> of seven harpsichords playing chance-determined excerpts from the works of Cage, Hiller, and a potted history of canonical classics, with fifty-two tapes of computer-generated sounds, 6,400 slides of designs, many supplied by NASA, and shown from sixty-four slide projectors, with forty motion-picture films. The piece was initially rendered in a five-hour performance at the University of Illinois in 1969, in which the audience arrived after the piece had begun and left before it ended, wandering freely around the auditorium in the time for which they were there.|$|E
500|$|The {{underwater}} setting {{required the}} most special effects animation for a Disney animated feature since Fantasia in 1940. Effects animation supervisor Mark Dindal estimated {{that over a}} million bubbles were drawn for this film, {{in addition to the}} use of other processes such as airbrushing, backlighting, <b>superimposition,</b> and some computer animation. The artistic manpower needed for Mermaid required Disney to farm out most of the underwater bubble effects animation in the film to Pacific Rim Productions, a China-based firm with production facilities in Beijing. An attempt to use Disney's famed multiplane camera {{for the first time in}} years for quality [...] "depth" [...] shots failed because the machine was reputedly in dilapidated condition. The multiplane shots were instead photographed at an outside animation camera facility.|$|E
5000|$|The art style draws {{heavily from}} the German Expressionist-inflected artwork {{of the book}} and {{displays}} such influences as of Russian Constructivism poster art.

500|$|While the <b>superimposition</b> of Roman {{culture on}} the local {{population}} {{appears to have been}} unproblematic and thorough, the Celtic traditions did not disappear entirely, resulting in a fusion of Roman and local culture that characterized all aspects of society. Latin, the language of government and instruction, only gradually replaced the local Celtic dialects in everyday use. Local artworks and religious icons of the period exhibit influences of ornamental Celtic art, classical Greco-Roman art and even Oriental styles from {{the far reaches of the}} Empire. [...] An important incentive for the local people to Romanize was the perspective of obtaining the various degrees of Roman citizenship and the rights conferred thereby, including the right to vote, to hold public office and to render military service.|$|E
500|$|Watership Downs {{universal}} motifs {{of liberation}} and self-determination {{have led to}} the tendency of minority groups to read their own narrative into the novel, despite the author's assurance (in 2005) that it [...] "was never intended to become some sort of allegory or parable." [...] Rachel Kadish, reflecting on her own <b>superimposition</b> of the founding of Israel onto Watership Down, has remarked [...] "Turns out plenty of other people have seen their histories in that book...some people see it as an allegory for struggles against the Cold War, fascism, extremism...a protest against materialism, against the corporate state. [...] Watership Down can be Ireland after the famine, Rwanda after the massacres." [...] Kadish has praised both the fantasy genre and Watership Down for its [...] "motifs [...] hit home in every culture...all passersby are welcome to bring their own subplots and plug into the archetype." ...|$|E
500|$|When pure-frequency sine tones {{were first}} {{synthesised}} into complex timbres, starting in 1953, combinations using inharmonic relationships (noises) were used {{far more often}} than harmonic ones (tones). Tones were seen as analogous to vowels, and noises to consonants in human speech, and because traditional music had emphasised tones almost exclusively, composers of electronic music saw scope for exploration along the continuum stretching from single, pure (sine) tones to white noise (the densest <b>superimposition</b> of all audible frequencies)—that is, from entirely periodic to entirely aperiodic sound phenomena. In a process opposite to the building up of sine tones into complexes, white noise could be filtered to produce sounds with different bandwidths, called [...] "coloured noises", such as the speech sounds represented in English by sh, f, s, or ch. An early example of an electronic composition composed entirely by filtering white noise {{in this way is}} Henri Pousseur's Scambi (Exchanges), realised at the Studio di Fonologia in Milan in 1957.|$|E
40|$|AbstractGeneral constructions are {{provided}} for some cyclic balanced hyper-Graeco-Latin <b>superimpositions</b> of three Youden squares.

For 2 q + 1 ⩾ 11, the designs of each size fall into three combinatorially (and statistically) distinct classes. The basic constructions, which extend constructions by Potthoff (1963) and Agrawal and Sharma (1978), involve systematic use of successive even powers and successive odd powers of a primitive element of GF(2 q + 1). However, we illustrate how an idea taken from Preece and Phillips (1997) can be extended to produce some slightly more involved variants of the constructions when q is composite and sufficiently large...|$|R
