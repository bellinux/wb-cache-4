50|$|A pin shackle {{is closed}} with an anchor bolt and cotter pin, {{in a manner}} similar to a clevis. It is for this reason they are often {{referred}} to, in industrial jargon, as clevises. Pin shackles can be inconvenient to work with, at times, as the bolt will need to be secured to the shackle body to avoid its loss, usually with a split pin or <b>seizing</b> <b>wire.</b> A more secure version used in crane rigging features the combination of a securing nut (hardware) located alongside the cotter pin. Pin shackles are practical in many rigging applications where the anchor bolt is expected to experience some rotation.|$|E
60|$|It {{went over}} with a mighty splash, the {{platform}} rose with a jerk under them; then, as they backed clear, there was a rattle of cable, and they <b>seized</b> the <b>wire.</b> The lashed craft swung like a pendulum athwart the stream, the rattling winch hauled them back fathom by fathom to the Cumbria, while, when he had crawled on board her, Austin dropped limply, and a trifle grey in face, on to the settee in the skipper's room.|$|R
5000|$|Contact between {{pantograph}} {{and overhead}} catenary wire is usually assured through {{a block of}} graphite. This material conducts electricity {{while working as a}} lubricant. As graphite is brittle, pieces can break off during operation. Bad pantographs can <b>seize</b> the overhead <b>wire</b> and tear it down. So there is a two way influence where bad wires can damage the pantograph and bad pantographs can damage the wires. To prevent this, a pantograph monitoring station can be used. At sustained high speeds (above [...] ) friction can cause the contact strip to become red hot, which causes excessive arcing, and fail.|$|R
50|$|In February 1867 Fenians, one of {{whom was}} Michael Davitt, {{attacked}} Chester Castle in order to obtain arms for the rising. The revolt's organisers had hoped to benefit from considerable support among Irish nationals, or their descendants, living in England. The arms stored in the castle were to be <b>seized,</b> the telegraph <b>wires</b> cut, the rolling stock on the railway to be appropriated for transport to Holyhead, where shipping was to be seized and a descent made on Dublin before the authorities should have time to interfere. This scheme was frustrated by information given to the government by the informer John Joseph Corydon, one of Stephens' most trusted agents.|$|R

60|$|Slashing {{through the}} laces I dragged off one boot. Its heel was heavy and might serve for a mallet, {{and holding the}} blade of my knife on the top strand close against a post, I smote it furiously. The wire was not nicked half through when it burst beneath the pressure, and a barb on its flying end scored my face so that the blood trickled into my mouth and eyes; but the next wire was of treble twist, and as I struck and choked I regretted the {{thoroughness}} with which we had built the fence. The knife chipped under the blows I rained upon it, and when I shortened the blade its end snapped off. In a fit of desperation I <b>seized</b> the lacerating <b>wires</b> with my naked fingers and tore at them frenziedly, but what {{the pressure on the}} other side failed to accomplish the strength of twenty men might not do, so when in a few seconds reason returned to me I picked up what remained of the knife and set to work again. There was still no sign of Thorn, and as the wires did not slacken it was plain that Steel had failed to loose the straining screws without convenient tools. Three slender cords of steel alone pent in the stock that were to set me free of debt, but I had no implements with which to break them, so they also held me fast to be dragged down helpless to beggary.|$|R

Como os jovens constroem suas identidades nestes espaços como o trabalho e a escola e quais os sentidos que emergem deles e a experiência com o desemprego constitui a problemática central deste estudo. O objetivo foi analisar a heterogeneidade vivida pelos jovens na relação que estabelecem com o trabalho e a educação, os sentidos do trabalho e a experiência com o desemprego na atualidade. A abordagem é de natureza qualitativa em que foram {{realizadas}} entrevistas semi-estruturadas com oito jovens (quatro homens e quatro mulheres). Os resultados mostram que os jovens se constroem como sujeitos através de diversas experiências numa relação processual dinâmica. A dimensão que o trabalho ocupa em suas vidas aparece como fundamental em suas vivências. A experiência com o desemprego mostra as oscilações, flutuações, inconstâncias, inseguranças e movimentos circundantes de continuidades e descontinuidades diante das transformações do mundo do trabalho. A diversidade dos sentidos do trabalho é caracterizada pela complexidade da própria identidade sempre em constituição, em razão de o mundo estar em constante mudança. Foram apreendidos como fios que se conectam e se entrecruzam, dependendo de cada contexto que os jovens vivenciam. As escolhas e incertezas ficam entre o real, o possível e o desejado quanto a seus projetos educacionais e laborais.
