5|$|Based only on {{uncertain}} {{descriptions of}} the first practical telescope which Hans Lippershey tried to patent in the Netherlands in 1608, Galileo, in the following year, made a telescope with about 3x magnification. He later made improved versions with up to about 30x magnification. With a Galilean telescope, the observer could see magnified, upright images on the earth—it was what {{is commonly known as}} a terrestrial telescope or a <b>spyglass.</b> He could also use it to observe the sky; for a time {{he was one of those}} who could construct telescopes good enough for that purpose. On 25 August 1609, he demonstrated one of his early telescopes, with a magnification of about 8 or 9, to Venetian lawmakers. His telescopes were also a profitable sideline for Galileo, who sold them to merchants who found them useful both at sea and as items of trade. He published his initial telescopic astronomical observations in March 1610 in a brief treatise entitled Sidereus Nuncius (Starry Messenger).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Several early <b>spyglasses</b> are {{depicted}} in five paintings by Jan Brueghel the Elder completed between 1608 and 1625, {{as he was}} court painter of Archduke Albert VII of Habsburg. An optical tube that appears in the Extensive Landscape with View of the Castle of Mariemont, dated 1608 - 1612, represents the first painting of a telescope whatsoever. We collected some documents showing that Albert VII obtained <b>spyglasses</b> very early directly from Lipperhey or Sacharias Janssen. Thus the painting likely reproduces {{one of the first}} man-made telescopes ever. Two other instruments appear in two Allegories of Sight made in the years 1617 and 1618. These are sophisticated instruments and the structure suggests that they may be keplerian, but this is about two decades ahead this mounting was in use. Key words.

25|$|The first Internet Explorer {{was derived}} from <b>Spyglass</b> Mosaic.
