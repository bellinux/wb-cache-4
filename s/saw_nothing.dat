5|$|According to folklore, the priory {{is haunted}} by {{the ghost of a}} monk in a black habit who returns {{annually}} to check that its buried treasure has not been disturbed. He is said to arrive at midnight on the year's first new moon to lower a ghostly drawbridge spanning a vanished moat. In 1966 and 1967 a hundred people turned out to watch and allegedly managed to spot a cowled figure, but in 1968 the few spectators who turned up <b>saw</b> <b>nothing.</b>|$|E
5|$|Besides {{the series}} Phineas and Ferb, Phineas has been {{featured}} in several other pieces of merchandise from the series. To date, he has appeared in all Phineas and Ferb novelizations, published by Disney Press. Phineas appears in the Nintendo DS video game based on the series, simply titled Phineas and Ferb. Dan Povenmire {{has said that he}} <b>saw</b> <b>nothing</b> of the game until its release, on which he was given a copy for free.|$|E
5|$|Fearless and the 1st DF <b>saw</b> <b>nothing</b> {{during that}} same patrol. She damaged two German light cruisers during the Battle of Heligoland Bight later in August. The {{squadron}} provided close cover for the seaplane carriers of the Harwich Force during the Cuxhaven Raid in late December, but the cruiser was only engaged by several Zeppelins and aircraft without effect. The ship {{was transferred to the}} Grand Fleet in early 1915 and played a minor role in the Battle of Jutland the following year.|$|E

5|$|In 1855, Tchaikovsky's father funded {{private lessons}} with Rudolph Kündinger and {{questioned}} {{him about a}} musical career for his son. While impressed with the boy's talent, Kündinger said he <b>saw</b> <b>nothing</b> to suggest a future composer or performer. He later admitted that his assessment was also based on his own negative experiences as a musician in Russia and his unwillingness for Tchaikovsky to be treated likewise. Tchaikovsky was told to finish his course and then try for a post in the Ministry of Justice.|$|E
5|$|After half an hour's play Lycett Green {{once again}} became {{convinced}} that Gordon-Cumming was cheating. He left the table and sent a note to his mother-in-law—still at the table—recounting his suspicions: she took no action. By the time the game was finished Mary Wilson, the two Lycett Greens and Stanley Wilson—all {{of whom had been}} watching Gordon-Cumming closely—were convinced that he had been cheating, although they differed in their versions of what they saw. Others <b>saw</b> <b>nothing,</b> including people sitting closer to him, such as the prince, Lady Coventry (sitting next to Gordon-Cumming) and Levett (sitting opposite him). Over the two nights' play Gordon-Cumming won a total of £225.|$|E
5|$|McCormack {{transferred}} to the United States Air Force on 25 July 1950. After leaving the AEC in August 1951, he became Special Assistant to the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Air Force for Development. In January 1952 he was appointed Director of Nuclear Applications at the Air Research and Development Center in Baltimore, Maryland. He was subsequently promoted to major general, and became Deputy Commander of the Air Research and Development Command. He was called to testify at the Oppenheimer security hearing. Like other witnesses, McCormack testified that Oppenheimer was loyal, and that while {{the two men had}} disagreed over the merits of the Super, that he <b>saw</b> <b>nothing</b> dishonest or disloyal in Oppenheimer's opposition to it.|$|E

60|$|For two days, they {{continued}} their march through the forest, using every precaution against surprise. They <b>saw,</b> however, <b>nothing</b> of the enemy, and {{emerged from the}} forest, {{on the evening of}} the second day's march, at a distance of a few miles from Albany.|$|R
5|$|There are {{different}} {{opinions on the}} significance of these principles. Some note that the osteopathic medical philosophy is akin to the tenets of holistic medicine, suggestive of a kind of social movement within the field of medicine, one that promotes a more patient-centered, holistic approach to medicine, and emphasizes the role of the primary care physician within the health care system. Others point out that {{there is nothing in the}} principles that would distinguish D.O. from M.D. training in any fundamental way. One study, published in The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association found a majority of M.D. medical school administrators and faculty <b>saw</b> <b>nothing</b> objectionable in the core principles listed above, and some endorse them generally as broad medical principles.|$|E
5|$|Frustrated in {{his efforts}} to {{intercept}} the convoy at anchor, Willaumez determined to meet it at sea, sailing to the Bahama Banks. There he waited for the convoy, seizing any ships that came within sight of his squadron, including neutral vessels, in case they revealed his position. For several weeks Willaumez's lookouts <b>saw</b> <b>nothing,</b> the British holding the convoy back until they obtained some information about the location of the French squadron. During the night of 31 July, bored with waiting for the convoy, Captain Jérôme Bonaparte sailed northwards away from the squadron, acting without orders or even notifying his admiral. When dawn broke on 1 August, Willaumez was panicked by the disappearance of Vétéran and, assuming that the ship had somehow been accidentally separated, began to search for the missing vessel and its important commander.|$|E
5|$|Joan Young, who was {{the only}} {{first-hand}} witness, is challenged in both articles. She came forward in 2004, claiming {{that she had seen}} someone push something over the side of a boat on Coniston Water. This testimony is challenged, because so much time has passed and the fact that her husband <b>saw</b> <b>nothing.</b> However, he claims to have been reading his paper at the time. Also, {{it has been said that}} Young was too far away to identify the person in the boat, and that it couldn't have been Carol Park's body that was being dumped, as the Youngs were positioned so that the location Carol's body was found would have been visibly blocked by an island. The article even points out that Young described a boat that appeared to be a cruiser yacht. Despite the fact that Gordon did own a large yacht in 1997, in 1976 he owned only a 505 racing dinghy, which he sold later that year.|$|E

"However, he <b>saw</b> that <b>nothing</b> {{could be}} done on the instant, and adjourned the meeting for three weeks, {{at the end of which}} time the prelates, nobles, and {{community}} of Scotland were invited to bring forward whatever they could in opposition to his claim to supremacy.|$|R
60|$|After {{that there}} was hardly a letter that did not mention Kendall in some {{innocent}} fashion among the other boys and girls {{who took part in}} the sleigh-rides, parties, and sociables. But the morbidly acute Bert, if he <b>saw,</b> said <b>nothing,</b> and Anson did not see.|$|R
5|$|Cape {{sold the}} US {{rights to the}} {{recently}} formed publishing house of Pascal Covici and Donald Friede. Friede had heard gossip about The Well at a party at Theodore Dreiser's house and immediately decided to acquire it. He had previously sold a copy of Dreiser's An American Tragedy to a Boston police officer to create a censorship test case, which he had lost; he was awaiting an appeal, which he would also lose. He took out a $10,000 bank loan to outbid another publisher which had offered a $7,500 advance, and enlisted Morris Ernst, co-founder of the American Civil Liberties Union, to defend the book against legal challenges. Friede invited John Saxton Sumner of the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice to buy a copy directly from him, to ensure that he, not a bookseller, {{would be the one}} prosecuted. He also travelled to Boston to give a copy to the Watch and Ward Society, hoping both to further challenge censorship of literature and to generate more publicity; he was disappointed when they told him they <b>saw</b> <b>nothing</b> wrong with the book.|$|E

60|$|Poor Pax now <b>saw</b> that <b>nothing</b> {{more could}} be done. He {{therefore}} made a virtue of necessity, and revealed {{as much of}} the object of his mission as he deemed prudent. The man believed him, and, on his promising to keep perfectly still, released him from his deadly grip.|$|R

Not a face she ever saw, or at all like a face she ever <b>saw.</b> Doing <b>nothing</b> in the dream but looking at her fixedly, out of darkness.' ...|$|R
25|$|Daisy Coffey, the landlord/owner, would {{testify at}} Frechette's trial that she spent most evenings during the Hellmans' stay {{furnishing}} apartment 310, which {{enabled her to}} observe {{what was happening in}} apartment 303 directly across the courtyard. On March 30, Coffey went to the FBI's St. Paul field office to file a report, including information about the couple's new Hudson sedan parked in the garage behind the apartments. The building was placed under surveillance by two agents, Rufus Coulter and Rusty Nalls, that night, but they <b>saw</b> <b>nothing</b> unusual, mainly due to the blinds being drawn.|$|E
25|$|The term Orientalism {{has come}} to acquire {{negative}} connotations in some quarters and is interpreted {{to refer to the}} study of the East by Westerners shaped by the attitudes of the era of European imperialism in the 18th and 19th centuries. When used in this sense, it often implies prejudiced, outsider-caricatured interpretations of Eastern cultures and peoples. This viewpoint was most famously articulated and propagated by Edward Said in Orientalism (1978), a critical history of this scholarly tradition. In contrast, the term has also been used by some modern scholars to refer to writers of the Imperialist era who had pro-Eastern attitudes, as opposed to those who <b>saw</b> <b>nothing</b> of value in non-Western cultures.|$|E
25|$|His father, brother, and a {{neighbour}} {{came out}} to look and Joseph immediately said he too could see the apparition although the adults <b>saw</b> <b>nothing.</b> The mother, Victoire, came out but she too could see nothing. The boys’ parents could not see what their children were seeing that night and called for Sister Vitaline, the local school teacher. She, like the boys’ parents, could also not see the apparition, and called for two girls, Françoise Richer and Jeanne-Marie Lebosse, aged nine and eleven. Sister Vitaline suggested that perhaps Our Lady was visible only to the children. Without any knowledge of the apparition, these two girls looked {{into the night sky}} and began describing Our Lady in the same exact detail as the Barbedette boys had described.|$|E
60|$|General Moore {{was indeed}} in a {{position}} of imminent danger; but the lying reports as to the strength of the Spanish army induced him for a moment to make preparations for such a movement. When, however, he learned the utter overthrow and dispersal of the whole of the Spanish armies, he <b>saw</b> that <b>nothing</b> remained but to fall back, if possible, upon Portugal.|$|R
60|$|It {{might have}} been {{observed}} that Thorward's face expressed some unusual symptoms of feeling, as he looked up the river, and <b>saw</b> there <b>nothing</b> but a turbulent mass of heaving surges dashing themselves wildly against sharp forbidding rocks, which at one moment were grinning like black teeth amidst the white foam, and the next were overwhelmed by the swelling billows.|$|R

25|$|Over {{the next}} eight centuries, Irish, Scottish, and English missionaries reintroduced Christianity into the German territories. During {{the period of the}} Frankish Empire, the two most {{important}} of these missionaries were Columbanus, who was active in the Frankish Empire from 590, and St. Boniface, who was active from 716. The missionaries, particularly the Scottish Benedictines, founded monasteries (Schottenklöster, Scottish monasteries) in Germany, which were later combined into a single congregation governed by the Abbot of the Scots monastery at Regensburg. The conversion of the Germanic peoples began with the conversion of the Germanic nobility, who were expected to impose their new faith on the general population. This expectation was consistent with the sacral position of the king in Germanic paganism: the king is charged with interacting with the divine on behalf of his people. Hence the general population <b>saw</b> <b>nothing</b> wrong with their kings choosing their preferred mode of worship. The favoured method of showing the supremacy of the Christian belief was the destruction of the holy trees of the Germans. These were trees, usually old oaks or elm trees, dedicated to the gods. Because the missionary was able to fell the tree without being slain by the god, his Christian god had to be stronger.|$|E

500|$|The entire {{experience}} {{of working on}} Flower Drum Song was rewarding in many ways, {{not the least of}} which was that it convinced me that I had overcome all traces of my depression.

2500|$|A {{reviewer}} {{from the}} American Art News stated {{at the time}} that [...] "Dada philosophy is the sickest, most paralyzing and most destructive thing that has ever originated from the brain of man."

60|$|After {{that they}} went down two staircases, and came out at last in the gallery leading to the great doors {{at the head of}} that {{magnificent}} flight of steps known as the Giant's Staircase. But these doors--the main entrance of the palace--were locked, and, at a glance, Casanova <b>saw</b> that <b>nothing</b> short of a hatchet would serve to open them. There was no more to be done.|$|R
