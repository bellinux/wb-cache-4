5|$|Following Jones' rejection, Garrard vetoed a {{bill that}} would have allowed the {{legislature}} to select the state's presidential and vice-presidential electors; despite the fact that the law ran contrary to the state constitution, Garrard's veto further strained his relations with the <b>Senate.</b> After the <b>Senate</b> rejected nominee William Trigg, the state's newspapers openly talked of an executive-legislative feud and claimed the <b>Senate</b> had its own favorite candidate for the position and would not accept anyone else. When the <b>Senate</b> rejected Willis Green in January 1804, Garrard declared that he would make no more nominations for the position. Accusations of bad faith were exchanged between the governor and the <b>Senate,</b> after which Garrard nominated John Adair, the popular Speaker of the House. The <b>Senate</b> finally confirmed this choice.|$|E

5|$|Many {{rules and}} {{procedures}} in the Maryland <b>Senate</b> are set by the state constitution. Beyond the constitutional mandates, rules in the <b>Senate</b> are developed by the Rules Committee. The <b>Senate</b> and House of Delegates both meet for ninety days following the second Wednesday in January, although these sessions may be extended for up to thirty days by majority votes in both houses, and special sessions may be called by the Governor.

Seating in the <b>Senate</b> is by party, {{with the leaders of}} each party choosing the exact seating assignments. Each Senator has offices in Annapolis, in the Miller <b>Senate</b> Office Building.|$|E
5|$|<b>Senate</b> {{committees}} can {{be affected}} by the party composition of the <b>Senate.</b> The Clerk of the <b>Senate,</b> Harry Evans, argued that a government majority of seats in the <b>Senate</b> resulted in limitations on what the committees inquired into, and how readily governments responded to their queries and requests for information. Statistics published by centrist political party the Australian Democrats have been used to support the contention that committee operations have been inhibited by government control of the <b>Senate,</b> particularly in respect of selection of topics for committee inquiry. However Senator Minchin, the leader of the government in the <b>Senate</b> in the mid-2000s, pointed out that their political rivals had previously cut off debate on more bills in the <b>Senate</b> than had his government.|$|E

5|$|A typical {{session of}} the <b>Senate</b> begins with a call to order by the President of the <b>Senate.</b> After the call to order, the {{previous}} day's journal is approved, petitions are heard, and orders involving committee and leadership appointments or changes to the rules are presented.

5|$|As {{a result}} of the 1824 elections, the Relief faction gained a 22–16 {{majority}} in the state <b>Senate</b> and a 61–39 majority in the House. The pro-Relief majority in the state <b>Senate</b> subsequently elected Rowan to the U.S. <b>Senate,</b> which had the inadvertent effect of weakening the faction's cause in the House by removing its leader there. Rowan served in the <b>Senate</b> from March 4, 1825 to March 3, 1831. During the Twenty-first Congress, he was chairman of the Judiciary Committee.|$|E

In addition, the <b>Senate</b> operated while under various religious restrictions. For example, before any meeting could begin, a sacrifice to the gods was made, and a search for divine omens (the auspices) was taken. The auspices were taken in order to determine whether that particular <b>Senate</b> meeting held favor with the gods. The <b>Senate</b> was only allowed to meet in a building of religious significance, such as the Curia Hostilia.|$|E

5|$|Back at Rome, Tiberius instituted the Sodales Augustales, a priesthood of {{the cult}} of Augustus which Germanicus became a member of. When news arrived of his raid, Tiberius commemorated his {{services}} in the <b>Senate</b> with elaborate, but insincere praise: the proceedings gave him joy that the mutiny had been suppressed, but anxiety at the glory and popularity afforded to Germanicus. The <b>Senate,</b> in absence of Germanicus, voted {{that he should be}} given a triumph. Ovid's Fasti dates the <b>Senate</b> vote of Germanicus' triumph to 1 January AD 15.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the ticket}} {{reselling}} {{that occurred during the}} week after the Super Bowl, and in order to limit that kind of profiteering, Hawaii <b>Senate</b> President Donna Mercado Kim introduced <b>Senate</b> Resolution 12, also known as the Bruno Mars Act. It limits all ticket purchases within 48 hours of the on-sale date to the physical box office. This ensures that anyone who comes to the box office to buy tickets for a show should almost certainly be guaranteed a ticket and discourages ticket scalping. The State <b>Senate</b> in Hawaii passed the law.|$|E
