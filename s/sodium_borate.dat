40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} potential reproductive effects of <b>sodium</b> <b>borates</b> on occupationally exposed male employees at a large mining and production facility in the Mojave Desert of California. METHODS [...] The standardised birth ratio (SBR) was used to assess fertility of the male employees. Live births were the measured end point, and the rate of female to male offspring was also assessed. Data were collected through a questionnaire after a series of on site introductory and explanatory meetings with the employees. Initial non-responders were followed up by telephone. Medical insurance records were assessed for those who declined to participate. RESULTS [...] The questionnaire was a good method of ascertainment for live births. There was no evidence of selection bias in the results. There was a highly significant excess of offspring fathered by the male employees. There was no evidence of a relation between exposure and this excess of offspring, nor were there any temporal differences during the period of observation (> 30 years). Also, there was an excess of the percentage of female offspring fathered by these male employees. This excess of female offspring was not significant. There was no evidence of an exposure relation to <b>sodium</b> <b>borates</b> with this excess of female offspring nor were there any temporal differences. CONCLUSION [...] Under the conditions studied, there were no adverse reproductive effects of high borate doses as reported from oral ingestion studies in animals...|$|R

30|$|Although {{a higher}} {{generation}} efficiency was achieved (> 99  %) when 30  wt% of NaBH 4 was applied {{using the same}} conditions of the first case study, an appearance of precipitated materials (crystals of <b>sodium</b> <b>borates)</b> in the collector (1 st GLS) was observed.

The main objective was to meet the DOE 2015 onboard hydrogen storage target (5.5  wt%). Exceptional results showed that onboard mixing of fuel and acidic streams in the proposed system of two gas–liquid separators proved useful for higher conversion efficiency and system performance. 98  % conversion efficiency without any <b>sodium</b> <b>borates</b> precipitation was achievable upon optimizing NaBH 4 fuel solution flow rate. Hence, a hydrogen generation rate of 863  ml/min was obtained from applying 30  wt% NaBH 4 at 1.03  ml/min and 3  M HCl at 0.97  ml/min, achieving 4.44  kWh of power.
