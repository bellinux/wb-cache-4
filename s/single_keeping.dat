40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} the way the Astro-WISE information system (or simply Astro-WISE) supports the data {{from a wide range}} of in-struments and combines multiple surveys and their catalogues. Astro-WISE allows ingesting of data from any optical instrument, survey or catalogue, pro-cessing of this data to create new catalogues and bringing in data from different surveys into a <b>single</b> catalogue, <b>keeping</b> all dependencies back to the original data. Full data lineage is kept on each step of compiling a new catalogue with an ability to add a new data source recursively. With these features, Astro-WISE allows not only combining and retrieving data from multiple surveys, but performing scientific data reduction and data mining down to the rawest data in the data processing chain within a single environment...|$|R
40|$|Spectrum {{management}} in DSL protects lines of potential customers from spectrum pollution. A spectrum management decision {{is equivalent to}} estimating a price for the future revenue from these potential customers. Making explicit this pricing decision would allow mixing economic and technical knowledge into a <b>single</b> estimator. <b>Keeping</b> them separate may be leading to double conservatism where the engineers produce a conservative estimate and the economists start from there to add their own pessimism to arrive at an investment decision. We propose a model where varying economic parameters would {{be included in the}} estimator used to compute the data rate offered to each customer. This would allow to maximise expected revenue and implement a version of a financial "hedge", where the risk is minimised by mixing optimistic and pessimistic assumptions...|$|R
50|$|Modern {{cryptographic}} systems include symmetric-key algorithms (such as DES and AES) and public-key algorithms (such as RSA).

The public key is made available to anyone (often {{by means of a}} digital certificate). A sender encrypts data with the public key; only the holder of the private key can decrypt this data.|$|R

40|$|There is {{important}} goal of every starting businessman to choose such {{a form of}} bookkeeping, {{which will be the}} most optimal and will fit the best his core business. If a businessman wants to make a business based on Trade certificate only, he can have <b>single</b> entry book <b>keeping.</b> Tax evidence is very similar to <b>single</b> entry book <b>keeping,</b> but it is less administratively dificult. In fact, this book keeping is much more simple in a methodical way and we neednt have so big demands, for example computer equipment or wage costs for accountants. In a very similar way to a book keeping, it limits asset components which are subject to accounting. It also establishes the methods of rating of the asset and debits, but there isnt any form of the tax evidence specified. It is prescribed only to save the tax evidence for all periods of taxation for which the term for assessment of a tax, that is established by the law of income tax or by a special regulation, hasnt finished. But there is question, if this type of book keeping is sufficient for control of financial or another authority. If a businessman wants to establish a partner company, his cost of book keeping will be higher. The bases of good book keeping process make not only qualified human sources, but also the professional book keeping program. The program makes every output data for owners and investors, banks and other institutions. It stands to reason that book keeping is conclusive and truly displays economic reality of the company. It informs the managers about financial situation and gives them quality and quick information, which are important for financial and internal management of the company. It was obvious from tax calculation that <b>single</b> entry book <b>keeping</b> doesnt insist on time period of receipts and expenditures, but on the time when the businessman receipts receives and expenditures pays. It is obvious from final calculation that taxation of an individual compared to taxation of a corporation isnt profitable. If we consider the whole amount, which the individual has to pay, then we come to conclusion that amount paid by the individual is by about 30, 5...|$|R
