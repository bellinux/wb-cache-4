Total lipids were extracted from mussels using a modified Folch procedure followed by isolation of free sterols using column chromatography. Sterols were identified using GC/MS and quantified using (GC/MS-SIM) and GC/FID. The most abundant free sterols in commercially cultivated mussels were cholesterol, desmosterol, and brassicasterol. Mussels were fed on algae or fish waste for six months. The concentrations of sterols in fish waste-fed mussels {{were compared with}} those in algae-fed mussels. However, fish waste-fed mussels had significantly higher cholesterol concentrations compared to algae-fed mussels. Mussels fed algae had significantly higher campesterol compared to fish waste-fed mussels. Free sterols are neutral molecules {{that are difficult to}} ionize by MALDI or ESI. Therefore, in order to increase their ionization efficiency, sterols were converted into their corresponding picolinyl esters, N-methylpyridyl ethers and sulphated esters. Using MALDI-MS, sterol picolinyl esters were identified as [M+Na]⁺, the signal being significantly enhanced after the addition of sodium acetate. Sterol N-methylpyridyl ethers were detected as [M]⁺ while sulphated sterols were detected as [M-H]⁻. The ester bonds of picolinyl and sulphated esters cleaved during MALDI-CID MS/MS resulting in diagnostic fragments at m/z 146 and 97, respectively. Picolinyl esters of sterols were also analyzed using ESI/APCI-QIT MSn. The Picolinyl esters were detected as [M+H]⁺ in ESI and APCI sources.

The most significant contribution is made by DGA 1, which encodes a novel acyl-CoA;diacylglycerol acyltransferase. Two of the genes, ARE 1 and ARE 2, are also involved in <b>steryl</b> ester synthesis. A yeast strain that lacks all four genes is viable and has no apparent growth defects under standard conditions. The strain is devoid of both TAG and <b>steryl</b> esters, and fluorescence microscopy revealed that it also lacks lipid bodies. We conclude that neither storage lipids nor lipid bodies are essential for growth in yeast...|$|E
40|$|<b>Steryl</b> esters {{are stored}} in {{intracellular}} lipid droplets from which they are mobilized upon demand and hydrolyzed to yield free sterols and fatty acids. The mechanisms that control <b>steryl</b> ester mobilization are not well understood. We have previously identified {{a family of three}} lipases of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that are required for efficient <b>steryl</b> ester hydrolysis, Yeh 1, Yeh 2, and Tgl 1 (R. Köffel, R. Tiwari, L. Falquet, and R. Schneiter, Mol. Cell. Biol. 25 : 1655 - 1668, 2005). Both Yeh 1 and Tgl 1 localize to lipid droplets, whereas Yeh 2 is localized to the plasma membrane. To characterize the precise function of these three partially redundant lipases, we examined <b>steryl</b> ester mobilization under heme-deficient conditions. S. cerevisiae is a facultative anaerobic organism that becomes auxotrophic for sterols and unsaturated fatty acids in the absence of molecular oxygen. Anaerobic conditions can be mimicked in cells that are deficient for heme synthesis. We here report that Yeh 1 is the sole active <b>steryl</b> ester hydrolase under such heme-deficient conditions, indicating that Yeh 1 is activated whereas Yeh 2 and Tgl 1 are inactivated by the lack of heme. The heme-dependent activation of Yeh 1 is mediated at least in part by an increase in steady-state levels of Yeh 1 at the expense of Yeh 2 and Tgl 1 in exponentially growing cells. This increase in steady-state levels of Yeh 1 requires Rox 3, a component of the mediator complex that regulates transcription by RNA polymerase II. These data thus provide the first link between fat degradation and the transcriptional control of lipase activity in yeast...|$|E
40|$|Antioxidant {{activity}} of phytosterols, oryzanol, ferulic acid ester of sterols, corn fiber oil, and rice bran oil was investigated. Commercial soybean oil and distilled soybean oil FAME {{were used as}} substrates for both oxidative stability determination and viscosity analysis after the oil was oxidized. At low concentration, these materials did not improve the oxidative stability of the oil substrates, although the viscosity tended to be reduced slightly. The antipolymerization {{activity of}} <b>steryl</b> ferulate was higher at higher concentration than at lower concentration, and <b>steryl</b> ferulate was more effective than oryzanol. Rice bran oil showed very good antioxidant and antipolymerization activities...|$|E
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{deals with}} the separation of complex <b>steryl</b> acetate mixtures by an improved procedure for column chromatography on a silver nitrate-impregnated silicic acid. Separations were effected {{on the basis of}} the number and position of double bonds. Also, some relationship could be observed between the chemical structure of <b>steryl</b> acetates and the mobility. The application of this technique for the sterol mixture isolated from a short-necked clam, Tapes philippinarum, gave the complete separation of several components; brassicasterol, 22 -dehydrocholesterol, 22 -trans- 24 -norcholesta- 5, 22 -dien- 3 β-ol, 28 -isofucosterol, desmosterol, 24 -methylenecholesterol, and an unknown sterol...|$|E
40|$|Higher <b>steryl</b> ester biosynthetic {{activities}} were obtained with Triton X- 100 -phosphatidylcholine-cholesterol mixed micelles than with Tween 80 -phosphatidylcholine-cholesterol mixed micelles when incubated with spinach leaf (Spinacia oleracea L.) acetone powder preparations. The best incorporation of [4 - 14 C]cholesterol into [4 - 14 C]cholesteryl ester was obtained with a Triton X- 100 -phosphatidylcholine-cholesterol (10 : 1 : 1, w/w) mixed micelle system. This mixed micelle system, however, required 1, 2 -dipalmitin and fatty acid-free bovine albumin for optimal activity. The reaction exhibited a diglyceride specificity since the dipalmitin requirement could {{be replaced with}} neither 1 -monopalmitin nor tripalmitin. Significant amounts of <b>steryl</b> ester biosynthetic activity were detected in the chloroplast (1, 000 g pellet), mitochondrial (3, 000 g pellet), and microsomal (20, 000 g and 88, 000 g pellet) fractions. Little activity was detected in the water-soluble (88, 000 g supernatant) fraction. The highest specific activity occurred in the 88, 000 g pellet. The 88, 000 g supernatant contained a heatstable, water-soluble substance that was required for optimal <b>steryl</b> ester biosynthesis {{in all of the}} pellet fractions. This factor was not lost during extensive dialysis but was destroyed by ashing, indicating that it was large and organic. Silver nitrate thin layer chromatography indicated that 60 % of the biosynthesized <b>steryl</b> esters contained saturated fatty acids in the absence of 1, 2 -dipalmitin and that 83 % contained saturated fatty acids in the presence of 1, 2 -dipalmitin...|$|E
