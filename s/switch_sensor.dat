40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an approach to}} tracking persons using Gaus-sian Processes (GP) and Particle Filtering (PF). We used a binary <b>switch</b> <b>sensor</b> floor, which provides a natural and transparent way to build an indoor positioning and tracking system. However, it poses many challenges by producing nonlinear non-Gaussian mea-surements of true location. To solve these issues we present a novel algorithm. It uses PF for Bayesian tracking and data association combined with learned GP regression to correct estimates. Fur-thermore, the proposed algorithm, called Gaussian Process Joint Particle Filtering (GPJPF), handles multiple targets, where each particle models the targets ’ states jointly. To handle the data as-sociation problem and interaction between targets in close prox-imity, a Markov Random Fields (MRF) -based motion model was applied. Along with the GP model, {{it can be used}} directly as an additional factor when calculating the importance weights of par-ticles. In comparison, the proposed method outperforms conven-tional Gaussian process and particle filtering methods. 1...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAutomatic switch is an {{automatic}} electrical device that uses sensor technology to detect movement, or body temperature that was {{detected in the}} switch. The sensor uses passive infra-red receiver (PIR) by using lithium tantalite (LiTaO 3) that will capture a moment as a response in temperature changes. In this research, we synthesized a thin film of lithium tantalite (LiTaO 3) on a substrate silicon p-type. The film was produced by chemical solution deposition (CSD) and engineering spin coatings with temperature annealing on 550 °C, 600 °C, 650 °C, 700 °C, 750 °C and 800 °C with 3000 rpm in speed for around 30 seconds. The value of high absorbent showed that the LiTaO 3 film has {{a large number of}} photon energy. This research obtained the energy band-gap film LiTaO 3 in the range 3. 41 - 4. 56 eV. This result concludes that annealed temperatures affects the optical properties of the LiTaO 3 film in the substrate of Si (100) p-type semiconductor. The sensitivity of this high intensity absorbent for energy and high value of band-gap is great and is therefore potential to be used prospectively for the automatic <b>switch</b> <b>sensor</b> on the satellite platform...|$|E
