25|$|Tracht {{found a home}} at WAPE in Jacksonville, Florida, in August 1975 {{and became}} the {{dominant}} radio personality not just in northeast Florida, but in the Southeastern United States While in Jacksonville, his true identity was kept confidential because the public was disappointed that the booming, macho voice belonged to a young guy who was <b>skinny</b> <b>and</b> shy. The station turned Tracht's request for privacy into a marketing ploy. Curtains were hung {{in the window of}} the broadcast booth, a TV interview showed only his lips, and Tracht wore a gorilla costume at personal appearances. Tracht was named as the top radio personality in the United States for 1977 and 1980. In 1979, he signed a five-year contract worth $1 million.|$|E

500|$|Berry overcame several {{physical}} ailments {{during his}} football career, a fact he became famous for, {{but one that}} according to Berry was often exaggerated by the media. He was <b>skinny</b> <b>and</b> injury prone, such that when his college teammates saw {{him for the first}} time they sarcastically dubbed him, [...] "Jack Armstrong, the All-American Boy". Reportedly, because one leg was shorter than the other, Berry had to wear padding inside his shoe in order to walk properly. However, according to Berry, this was not entirely true. In actuality, bruised nerves near the sacroiliac joint occasionally caused misalignment in his back, which in turn affected his legs and caused one to become slightly shorter; it was not a permanent condition. To alleviate this, he wore a back brace for 13 years in the NFL. That he required specialized shoes was a myth, which Berry says was perpetuated by an overzealous information director with the Colts when Berry tried to compensate for his condition by putting something in his shoe during training camp.|$|E

500|$|In 1946, {{he became}} an {{apprentice}} photographer for Look and later a full-time staff photographer. G. Warren Schloat, Jr., another new photographer for the magazine at the time, recalled that he thought Kubrick lacked the personality {{to make it as}} a director in Hollywood, remarking, [...] "Stanley was a quiet fellow. He didn't say much. He was thin, <b>skinny,</b> <b>and</b> kind of poor—like we all were". Kubrick quickly became known, however, for his story-telling in photographs. His first, published on April 16, 1946, was entitled [...] "A Short Story from a Movie Balcony" [...] and staged a fracas {{between a man and a}} woman, during which the man is slapped in the face, caught genuinely by surprise. In another assignment, 18 pictures were taken of various people waiting in a dental office. It has been said retrospectively that this project demonstrated an early interest of Kubrick in capturing individuals and their feelings in mundane environments. In 1948, he was sent to Portugal to document a travel piece, and covered [...] the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus in Sarasota, Florida. Kubrick, a boxing enthusiast, eventually began photographing boxing matches for the magazine. His earliest, [...] "Prizefighter", was published on January 18, 1949, and captured a boxing match and the events leading up to it, featuring Walter Cartier. [...] On April 2, 1949, he published a photo essay, named [...] "Chicago-City of Extremes" [...] in Look, which displayed his talent early on for creating atmosphere with imagery, including a photograph taken above a congested Chicago street at night. The following year, on July 18, 1950, the magazine published his photo essay, [...] "Working Debutante - Betsy von Furstenberg", which featured a Pablo Picasso portrait of Angel F. de Soto in the background. Kubrick was also assigned to photograph numerous jazz musicians, from Frank Sinatra and Erroll Garner to George Lewis, Eddie Condon, Phil Napoleon, Papa Celestin, Alphonse Picou, Muggsy Spanier, Sharkey Bonano, and others.|$|E

2500|$|Simon Walters, {{political}} {{editor of the}} Mail on Sunday, complained that Rowling's attack on weight standards was hypocritical because so many evil characters in her books, such as Dudley and Vernon Dursley, are fat, while Harry Potter himself is so skinny. Rowling responded to her critics {{by saying that the}} people in the Harry Potter books who are [...] "on the plumper side" [...] include [...] "several of my most important, admirable and loveable characters". She included a link to a fan website – www.mugglenet.com – that lists seven characters who are [...] "fat and good", three who are [...] "fat and bad" [...] and claims there are none who are [...] "fat and evil".

Rose didn't want Tiana to resemble [...] "a cookie-cutter princess who had been coloured in brown. When I saw {{her for the first time}} and realized how much she looked like me I was really blown away." [...] Rose also served as a form of visual, live-action reference for supervising animator Mark Henn as he worked on Tiana, videotaping her as she recorded her lines and incorporating some of her distinct characteristics, such as her dimples and left-handedness, into Tiana's design.|$|E

2500|$|Joe Clark's {{rapid rise}} from a {{relatively}} unknown Alberta MP to the Leader of the Opposition took much of Canada by surprise. The Toronto Star announced Clark's victory with a headline that read [...] "Joe Who?", giving Clark a nickname that stuck for years. Much joking {{was made of}} Clark's clumsiness and awkward mannerisms. <b>Skinny</b> <b>and</b> tall, he became a frequent target for editorial cartoonists, who delighted in portraying him {{as a sort of}} walking candy apple, with an enormous head and floppy dog-like ears; cartoonist Andy Donato typically drew Clark with mittens on strings hanging from his suit sleeves. Initially, it seemed unlikely that a man who was the source of so much mockery could ever hope to compete against the confident and intellectual Pierre Trudeau. It also did not help that the Progressive Conservatives lost a string of by-elections on May 24, 1977.|$|E
