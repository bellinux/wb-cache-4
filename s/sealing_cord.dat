500|$|Hans Bielenstein {{writes that}} {{as far back as}} the Han dynasty (202 BCE–220 CE), the Han Chinese {{government}} [...] "maintained the fiction" [...] that the foreign officials administering the various [...] "Dependent States" [...] and oasis city-states of the Western Regions (composed of the Tarim Basin and oasis of Turpan) were true Han representatives due to the Han government's conferral of Chinese <b>seals</b> and <b>seal</b> <b>cords</b> to them.|$|R

50|$|A Hunnu envoy {{of noble}} origin {{arrived in the}} Chinese Court, fell ill, and died. The Court {{appointed}} Lu Chun-go as an envoy to the Huns to return the deceased envoy and provide for a rich burial. Lu Chun-go was given a <b>seal</b> with <b>cords,</b> 2,000 salary bags, and a few thousand lans (approx. 80-110 kg) of silver to finance the burial. But Chanyu did not believe him and said: “The Chinese Court exterminated our noble envoy. And the ambassador is a Chinese noble.” So he detained Lu Chun-go.|$|R
50|$|There is both {{literary}} and archaeological evidence of extensive trade between Ancient Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley civilization (probably correctly {{identified with the}} land called Meluhha in Akkadian). Impressions of clay seals from the Indus Valley city of Harappa were evidently used to seal bundles of merchandise, as clay <b>seal</b> impressions with <b>cord</b> or sack marks on the reverse side testify. A number of these Indus Valley seals have turned up at Ur and other Mesopotamian sites.|$|R
50|$|There is both {{literary}} and archaeological evidence of extensive trade between Ancient Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley civilization. Impressions of clay seals from the Indus Valley city of Lothal and Harappa were evidently used to seal bundles of merchandise, as clay <b>seal</b> impressions with <b>cord</b> or sack {{marks on the}} reverse side testify. Numerous Indus Valley seals have turned up at Ur and other Mesopotamian sites, far outnumbering even local seals which shows their preference for the Indian economic currencies and seals.|$|R
2500|$|Three months later, Tamar {{was accused}} of {{prostitution}} on account of her pregnancy. Upon hearing this news, Judah ordered that she be burned to death. Tamar sent the staff, <b>seal,</b> and <b>cord</b> to Judah with a message declaring that the owner of these items {{was the man who}} had made her pregnant. Upon recognizing these items as his security, Judah released Tamar from her sentence. Tamar, having thus secured her place in the family as well as Judah's posterity, gave birth to twins, Perez and Zerah. Their birth is reminiscent of the birth of Rebekah's twin sons. The midwife marks Zerah's hand with a scarlet cord when he emerges first from the womb, though Perez is born first. Perez is identified in the Book of Ruth as the ancestor of King David. (...) The Genesis narrative also makes a note that Judah did not have further sexual relations with Tamar. (...) ...|$|R
50|$|In 1903 Lord Howard de Walden {{published}} Charles' {{drawings and}} a facsimile of his transcript, and also {{two sets of}} photographic images of the seals from Exemplar A; firstly of all the surviving individual <b>cords</b> of <b>seals</b> in colour (showing one face only of each seal), and secondly black and white images of each constituent <b>seal</b> on the <b>cord,</b> obverse and reverse (where existing). The number of surviving seals (series unspecified) is given as 95 by the National Archives catalogue entry, and as 72 (7 earls and 65 barons) by Brian Timms. Photographic images were published by Brian Timms on his heraldry website.|$|R
2500|$|After Shelah {{had grown}} up, Judah became a widower. After Judah mourned {{the death of}} his wife, he planned on going to Timnah to shear his sheep. Upon hearing this news, Tamar {{disguised}} herself as a prostitute and immediately went to Enaim which was en route to Judah's destination. Upon arriving at Enaim, Judah saw the woman but did not recognize her as Tamar because of the veil she wore over her face. Thinking she was a prostitute, he requested her services. Tamar's plan was to become pregnant by this ruse so that she might bear a child in Judah's line, since Judah had not given her to his son Shelah. So she played the part of a prostitute and struck a bargain with Judah for a goat, secured by his staff, <b>seal,</b> and <b>cord.</b> When Judah was able to have a goat sent to Enaim, in order to collect his staff and seal, the woman {{was nowhere to be found}} and no one knew of any prostitute in Enaim.

5000|$|In 1373, {{the pope}} sent two papal delegates to serve Bernabò and Galeazzo their excommunication papers (consisting of a {{parchment}} bearing a leaden seal rolled in a silken cord). Bernabò, infuriated, placed the two papal delegates under arrest and refused their release {{until they had}} eaten the parchment, <b>seal,</b> and silken <b>cord</b> which they had served him. [...] He managed to resist, despite also the outbreak of a plague in Milan, whose consequences he suppressed with frantic energy. In 1378 he allied with the Republic of Venice in its War of Chioggia against Genoa. His troops were however defeated in September 1379 in the Val Bisagno.|$|R
6000|$|... "Returning {{from his}} bloody act, Ramiro {{ordered me to}} bed. I went, and as I passed Lampugnani's room I saw the door {{standing}} wide. It was thus that I learnt what had befallen. I remembered his words concerning the hat and I remembered old suspicions of my own aroused {{by the thought of}} the potent wine which Ramiro had ordered me to see given to the couriers. I sped back to the gallery that overlooks the hall. Ramiro was absent, and I surmised at once that he was gone to the kitchen. Then was it that I thought of you and of what service you might render if things were indeed as I now more than suspected. Like an inspiration it came to me how I might prepare your way. I ran down to the hall, sweating in my terror that he should return ere I had performed the task I went on. From the buffet I drew a flagon of that same stout wine that Ramiro used upon his messengers. I ripped away the <b>seal</b> and crimson <b>cord</b> by which it is distinguished, and placing it on the table I removed the flagon I had set for him before I had first departed.|$|R
5000|$|There is {{sufficient}} archaeological {{evidence for the}} trade between Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley. Impressions of clay seals from the Indus Valley city of Harappa were evidently used to seal bundles of merchandise, as clay <b>seal</b> impressions with <b>cord</b> or sack marks on the reverse side testify. A number of these Indus Valley seals have been found at Ur and other Mesopotamian sites. The Persian-Gulf style of circular stamped rather than rolled seals, also known from Dilmun, that appear at Lothal in Gujarat, India, and Failaka Island (Kuwait), {{as well as in}} Mesopotamia, are convincing corroboration of the long-distance sea trade network, which G.L. Possehl has called a [...] "Middle Asian Interaction Sphere". What the commerce consisted of is less sure: timber and precious woods, ivory, lapis lazuli, gold, and luxury goods such as carnelian and glazed stone beads, pearls from the Persian Gulf, and shell and bone inlays, were among the goods sent to Mesopotamia in exchange for silver, tin, woolen textiles, perhaps oil and grains and other foods. Copper ingots, certainly, bitumen, which occurred naturally in Mesopotamia, may have been exchanged for cotton textiles and chickens, major products of the Indus region that are not native to Mesopotamia—all these have been instanced.|$|R
40|$|I am a weaver {{and textile}} artist who {{has moved into}} working in the book form. As a teacher at an art college I {{have been looking for}} ways to explain this {{movement}} by myself and several other textiles artists, like the late Shereen Laplantz who wrote a book on book arts techniques after many decades of making plaited baskets. I have the pleasure of doing that today with three esteemed colleagues: Laura Strand, of Southern Illinois University in Edwardsville, Susan Warner Keene, Toronto, Bronfman award winner, formerly at Sheridan College, and Pam Scheinman, artist and historian Montclair State University, NJ. I presented my first research paper on the topic, Silk Velvet and Embroidered Bindings of Medieval England and France at the Smith College TSA meeting in 2002. Afterwards, Mary Dusenbury invited me to present up to date view at a subsequent meeting. I’ll start by reviewing eight medieval bindings and quickly catch up to the present. Prior to the invention of the printing press, European books were hand written, religious and legal documents owned buy the church and royalty. They were luxury objects and craftsmen and their patrons confirmed that status by using precious metals, gemstones and, for a short period, precious fabrics. The first examples illustrate both uses. The left image is from a painting and shows a loose chemise style cover that is decorative, but also functional. These chemises provided a kind of symbolic protection to bibles and prayer books, protecting their sacred nature from contact with human touch. The second is another chemise that holds the Indentures between Henry the Eighth and the Abbott of Islip in 1498. The metal <b>seals</b> and coloured <b>cords</b> represent the regions covered in the document. Books were stored flat in this era. The flaps on the chemises became impractical when we started storing books up right on shelves...|$|R
