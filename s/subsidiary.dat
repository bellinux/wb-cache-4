40|$|In this paper, {{we discuss}} the {{problems}} involved with the internal capital market of Japanese multinational manufacturer, especially the financing roles of the finance <b>subsidiaries.</b> By pooling cash flows from other <b>subsidiaries,</b> finance <b>subsidiaries</b> might relax financing constraints of the group. And since the transactions payments among <b>subsidiaries</b> are centralized by the finance <b>subsidiaries,</b> the finance <b>subsidiaries</b> are able to catch all of the transactions information of the group. This could prevent the managers of <b>subsidiaries</b> from overestimating the profitability of their own projects, {{make it possible for}} headquarters to choose the higher quality projects from many <b>subsidiaries</b> by taking risk and profitability into account, and closely monitor the project to make sure whether it is properly conducted. However, if funds of the group fall short, the finance <b>subsidiaries</b> have to raise funds from external capital market for all of the <b>subsidiaries.</b> For outside investors, {{it is hard to know}} where the money has gone and how the investment decisions have been made as well as the prospects of the subsidiaries' profitability. That is to say, if headquarters does not function well as a financial intermediary to ensure transparent and safe operation of the business, then the outside investors will reluctantly supply the capital to their enterprise, hence tightening the financing constraints...|$|R

40|$|The {{theme of}} {{corporate}} social responsibility (CSR) has not been widely examined {{in the context of}} multinationals. This dearth is even greater with respect to <b>subsidiaries,</b> particularly the subject of reverse transfer of practices, that is, the transfer of practices developed in <b>subsidiaries</b> back to the parent company. Because of this theoretical gap, the present article investigates the factors involved on reverse transfer of CSR practices. The research hypotheses test the importance of developing nonlocation-bound capabilities, of integration between <b>subsidiaries</b> and parent and of institutional distance. The data were obtained by a survey of the main foreign <b>subsidiaries</b> in Brazil. All told, we analyzed 150 Brazilian <b>subsidiaries</b> of multinationals, by applying multiple linear regression. The results indicate that the reverse transfer of CSR depends on the development of nonlocation-bound capabilities of the <b>subsidiaries</b> and integration between the parent company and its foreign <b>subsidiaries...</b>|$|R
