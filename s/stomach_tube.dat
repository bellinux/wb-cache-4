Pulsed gastric lavage (PGL) removed a significantly greater proportion of stomach content mass (95. 6 %) from blue catfish than did <b>stomach</b> <b>tubes</b> (14. 6 %). Percent mass of flathead catfish contents removed with PGL (96. 0 %) was not sig-nificantly different from that removed with <b>stomach</b> <b>tubes</b> (86. 9 %). Based on the greater effectiveness of PGL for blue catfish, combined with a shorter mean time required per sample (69 versus 118 s) and the better preservation of extracted diet material, we recommend using PGL as a nonlethal technique to collect diet sam-ples from large catfishes...|$|R

2500|$|Choking horses {{should be}} {{deprived}} of food and drink pending veterinary attention, {{so as not to}} increase the obstructive load within the esophagus. [...] The veterinarian will often sedate the horse and administer spasmolytics, such as butylscopolamine, to help the esophagus to relax. Once the muscles of the esophagus no longer force the food down the throat (active peristalsis), it may slip down on its own accord. If spasmolytics do not solve the problem, the veterinarian will usually pass a <b>stomach</b> <b>tube</b> through one of the nostrils and direct it into the esophagus until the material is reached, at which point gentle pressure is applied to manually push the material down. Gentle warm water lavage (water sent through the <b>stomach</b> <b>tube,</b> to soften the food material) may be required to help the obstructing matter pass more easily, but caution should be exercised to prevent further aspiration of fluid into the trachea.|$|E

With this technique, it was possible to collect relatively clean urine samples from Nile crocodiles of different sizes using canine urinary catheters or small diameter <b>stomach</b> <b>tubes.</b> Based on the gross anatomical features of the cloaca of the Nile crocodile, it was confirmed that urine accumulates in a chamber consisting of the urodeum and coprodeum.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Postoperative {{complications}} after open transthoracic esophagectomy {{could possibly}} be reduced if the abdominal phase is performed laparoscopically. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the feasibility of laparoscopic mobilization of the <b>stomach</b> and gastric <b>tube</b> formation in patients undergoing an open transthoracic esophagectomy for cancer. METHODS: Thirteen patients underwent an open transthoracic esophagectomy with extended en bloc lymphadenectomy combined with laparoscopic gastric tube formation. Clinicopathological data were derived from a prospective database and patient files. RESULTS: The median operation time was 484 min (range 347 - 573) and the median intraoperative blood loss was 1, 500 ml (range 250 - 3, 700). In 2 patients the laparoscopic procedure was converted to a laparotomy because of technical difficulties. Median postoperative stay in the ICU was 3 days (range 1 - 8) and median hospital stay was 29 days (range 12 - 104). One patient died in the hospital. Postoperatively 3 patients suffered from anastomotic leakage, 5 from pneumonia and 3 from vocal cord palsy. CONCLUSIONS: The complication rate was high in this series of patients undergoing an open extended transthoracic esophagectomy with laparoscopic mobilization of the <b>stomach</b> and gastric <b>tube</b> formation. Laparoscopic mobilization of the <b>stomach</b> and gastric <b>tube</b> formation are feasible, but need carefully guided testing before this technique can be applied routinel...|$|R

50|$|In September 1909, the Home Office became {{unwilling to}} release hunger-striking suffragettes before their {{sentence}} was served. Suffragettes became a liability {{because if they}} were to die in custody, the prison would be responsible for their death. Prisons began the practice of force-feeding the hunger strikers through a tube, most commonly via a nostril or <b>stomach</b> <b>tube</b> or a stomach pump. Force-feeding had previously been practised in Britain but its use had been exclusively for patients in hospitals who were too unwell to eat or swallow food. Despite the practice being deemed safe by medical practitioners for sick patients, it posed health issues for the healthy suffragettes.The process of tube-feeding was strenuous without the consent of the hunger strikers, who were typically strapped down and force-fed via stomach or nostril tube, often with a considerable amount of force. The process was painful and after the practice was observed and studied by several physicians, it was deemed to cause both short-term damage to the circulatory system, digestive system and nervous system and long-term damage to the physical and mental health of the suffragettes. Some suffragettes who were force-fed developed pleurisy or pneumonia {{as a result of a}} misplaced tube.|$|E

Soil samples were collected into sterile universal containers. All samples were obtained from abattoirs situated at three locations in Benin City, Nigeria.

Cellulase production was assayed by Carboxymethyl cellulose submerged broth culture while residual sugar yield and other cellulolytic activities were determined by 3, 5 â€“ Dinitrosalicylic acid, Filter Paper, Microcrystalline and Viscometric methods. Cellullolytic bacterial organisms isolated from both soil and rumen fluids were Bacillus subtilis, Clostridium cellobioparum and Clostridium thermocellum. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from both soil and cowdung samples while Erwinia spp was obtained from both rumen fluid and cowdung samples. Bacillus circulans and Serratia spp were obtained from soil samples only. Clostridium thermocellum and Erwinia spp produced the highest and lowest cellulase yields respectively. All isolates at 40 o C and pH 6, recorded optimal sugar yields in culture broth of which Clostridium thermocellum recorded the highest.

He also sued Wegeforth personally, and when the matter went to court in February 1924 Buck accused Wegeforth of interfering with [...] "practically everything" [...] related to his job, and of conspiring with the board to [...] "belittle and disparage" [...] his efforts as director. Wegeforth accused Buck of incompetence and testified that [...] "the whole character of the man was insubordination." [...] Buck also claimed that Wegeforth had killed a sick tiger by dosing the animal with calomel, and that the doctor's experiments in force-feeding snakes with a sausage stuffer had resulted in the deaths of 150 of the reptiles. Wegeforth had in fact administered calomel tablets to a tiger suffering an intestinal ailment in August 1923, and in his memoirs described experimenting with methods of force-feeding Diablo the python before coming up with the idea to tube-feed the snake using a sausage stuffer. Board member Thomas Faulconer and other witnesses, however, suggested that the sick tiger had died after a suspicious blow to the head, and flatly denied the snake-killing accusation. Wegeforth claimed that Buck himself had mistreated the reptiles, saying that he had [...] "stuffed down, by the most inhuman way of feeding, snake meat down the throat of a boa constrictor instead of using a more modern method of <b>stomach</b> <b>tube</b> or feeding the meat through a tube."

Many commercially available <b>stomach</b> and duodenal <b>tubes</b> have several standard depth markings, for example 18" [...] (46 cm), 22" [...] (56 cm), 26" [...] (66 cm) and 30" [...] (76 cm) from distal end; infant feeding tubes often come with 1 cm depth markings.

The tube should be directed straight towards the back of the patient as it moves through the nasal cavity and down into the throat. When the tube enters the oropharynx and glides down the posterior pharyngeal wall, the patient may gag; in this situation the patient, if awake and alert, is asked to mimic swallowing or is given some water to sip through a straw, and the tube continues to be inserted as the patient swallows.
