The government were hopeful that the changes would {{have an effect on}} preventing the increase in crime levels, as figures reported a substantial percentage of young people leaving school were turning to a life of crime, with many being unable to find <b>suitable</b> <b>work</b> due to lack of skills and qualifications.|$|E
5|$|<b>Suitable</b> <b>work</b> for {{the class}} began to decline after {{completion}} of the Kent Coast route electrification in 1959. The reduction of work precipitated a phased reduction of the class {{that began with the}} withdrawal of No.31409 in November 1962. The withdrawal programme intensified after boundary changes on the Southern Region placed the lines west of Salisbury under Western Region control in 1963. Class members based at Exmouth Junction shed were withdrawn in 1964, whilst the Southern Region's allocation was gradually replaced by Bulleid's Light Pacifics. The last operational members of the class were Nos.31405 and31408; both were withdrawn in June 1966.|$|E
5|$|<b>Suitable</b> <b>work</b> for {{the class}} began to decline under British Railways {{ownership}} after the widening of bridges and tunnels on the Hastings line, which enabled Bulleid's powerful Q1class 0-6-0 to be used on freight trains between Hastings and Tonbridge. Following {{the completion of the}} Kent Coast electrification in 1959, the class was congregated at Tonbridge shed alongside members of the U1class to haul local services throughout the Central section. The reduction of work over the Brighton main line and the prevalence of the N class precipitated another move to Stewarts Lane shed in London. However, with remaining work being allocated to Bulleid's Light Pacifics, the class was withdrawn from service in November 1962.|$|E

5|$|Washington {{refused to}} allow his slaves to be sold without their permission. This policy was {{economically}} inefficient, resulting in an unnecessarily large work force. In his will, he provided that his slaves should be freed {{after the death of}} his wife. However, Martha chose to free them at the end of 1800, fearing that her life was not safe in their hands because her death would make them free. Most of the former slaves were unable to find <b>suitable</b> <b>work</b> after being freed and lived in poverty. Part of this was due to Virginia passing laws against educating blacks and restricting the rights of free blacks.|$|E

Some were allocated to just one shed for their entire working life (Nos. 6700–9 at Cardiff East Dock and Nos. 6725–32 at Newport, Pill). A number of 6700s were also allocated to Swindon, with 6733–41 spending a long time there.|$|E
500|$|Outside work, {{mostly on}} public infrastructure, {{continued}} beyond the convict era, but gradually declined due to discipline concerns, {{the rise of}} trade unions that saw such work as [...] "a threat to free labour", and an increasing emphasis on work as rehabilitation rather than punishment. By 1911 outside work had all but ceased, but could not adequately be replaced by employment within the prison walls; a lack of <b>suitable</b> <b>work</b> plagued the prison throughout its lifetime. Work in the 19th century consisted of cooking, washing clothes, cleaning the prison, tailoring, bootmaking, and printing. However, demand exceeded the availability of such work – increasingly so in the later years of the 19th century – so prisoners were also given activities with no practical value other than keeping them occupied. These included breaking stones, operating a water pump, and oakum picking. Even with these extra activities, by 1899, 60 to 70 men were employed at the pump, each doing {{only a few minutes}} work per hour, and occupied {{the rest of the time}} with recreation such as draughts.|$|E
2500|$|Anger {{management}} is a psycho-therapeutic program for anger prevention and control. It {{has been described}} as deploying anger successfully. Anger is frequently a result of frustration, or of feeling blocked or thwarted from something we feel to be important.

500|$|The Maunsell King Arthur class also faced a {{decrease}} in <b>suitable</b> <b>work</b> on the Central and Eastern sections following the introduction of BR Standard class 5 and BR Standard class 4 4-6-0s in 1955. The gradual withdrawal of the [...] "Urie N15s", H15s and SR N15x classes presented an opportunity to replace the ageing Drummond [...] "watercart" [...] tenders fitted to Nos.448457 with Urie [...] bogie tenders. This coincided with a 1958 programme to similarly change the [...] Ashford tenders fitted to eight of the second batch [...] "Eastleigh Arthurs". The class remained intact until {{the completion of the}} Eastern section electrification when 17 were made redundant in 1959. More withdrawals took place in 1960 when an increase in Bulleid Pacifics allocated to the Western section reduced available work. The ranks thinned to 12 in 1961, and further withdrawals reduced the class to one, No.30770 Sir Prianius. The class outlasted the newer – but less numerous – Lord Nelson class by one month when No.30770 was withdrawn from Basingstoke Shed in November 1962.|$|E

60|$|This {{visit to}} Eskdale was really Telford's last {{farewell}} {{to his old}} home, before setting out on a journey which was to form the turning-point in his own history, and {{in the history of}} British engineering as well. In Scotch phrase, he was going south. And after taking leave of his mother (not quite for the last time) he went south in good earnest, doing this journey on horseback; for his cousin the steward had lent him a horse to make his way southward like a gentleman. Telford turned where all enterprising young Scotchmen of his time always turned: towards the unknown world of London--that world teeming with so many possibilities of brilliant success or of miserable squalid failure. It was the year 1782, and the young man was just twenty-five. No sooner had he reached the great city than he began looking about him for <b>suitable</b> <b>work.</b> He had a letter of introduction to the architect of Somerset House, whose ornamental fronts were just then being erected, facing the Strand and the river; and Telford was able to get a place at once on the job as a hewer of the finer architectural details, for which both his taste and experience well fitted him. He spent some two years in London at this humble post as a stone-cutter; but already he began to aspire to something better. He earned first-class mason's wages now, and saved whatever he did not need for daily expenses. In this respect, the improvidence of his English fellow-workmen struck the cautious young Scotchman very greatly. They lived, he said, from week to week entirely; any time beyond a week seemed unfortunately to lie altogether outside the range of their limited comprehension.|$|E

40|$|The {{following}} {{served as}} conduits for {{the understanding of}} “Japanese culture” as a theme: perception of types of motif and scene, and detection of aesthetic properties from the characterization (expression) of types of motif and scene. Expository images trace motifs and scenes, but this {{is thought to have}} delayed the workings of inherent sensitization in appreciation of the works. Yet {{at the same time it}} determines the aura of Japanese culture that ought to be sensed as the theme of the painting. As a result, this is a format that still holds fundamental challenges as a means of selecting <b>works.</b> <b>Works</b> <b>suitable</b> for art appreciation classes at second-year junior high level are not those for which “culture” should be understood as the theme.
