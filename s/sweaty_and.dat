Like in the other games in the series, fights in Dead or Alive 5 are based on an interruption triangle system in which strikes (normal attacks) beat throws, throws beat holds (strike interception attacks), and holds beat strikes, all of such counterattacks causing extra damage. Tag team battles from the previous DOA games have been retained. The fights take place in interactive and now more highly-destructive arenas. The game's characters are rendered in much more realistic visual style {{than in the previous}} titles in the series, including new details such as the fighters getting <b>sweaty</b> <b>and</b> their clothes getting dirty during the fights, costume-specific breast physics and semi-transparent clothing.|$|E

"Rumors" [...] {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from music critics, however {{it has become}} one of Lohan's most recognized songs and has now been labeled as [...] "cult pop treasure". Charles Merwin of Stylus Magazine thought that [...] "Rumors" [...] was not a good choice for a single, stating, [...] "in fact, for a girl, that has been tagged as America’s next sweetheart by some media outlets, it might be the worst choice of subject matter for the opening statement from a girl that automatically has more to prove to audiences because of her stature as an actress. Unfortunately, 'Rumors' is about as good as it gets." [...] Erik Missio of ChartAttack thought that the song [...] "presented potential for a semi-palatable debut effort", but further added that it is a [...] "crap of a spectularly unspectacular level." [...] Entertainment Weekly contributor Nicholas Fonseca, however, considered [...] "Rumors" [...] a guilty pleasure, while Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic selected the song a Track Pick in the review of Speak.

500|$|Mars {{had been}} filming the music video for [...] "Gorilla" [...] as he {{announced}} on his Twitter account, on October 2, 2013.

It was directed by Mars' himself and regular collaborator Cameron Duddy. On October 10, 2013 it was announced on Bruno Mars' official website, {{leading up to the}} release of the video, the unveil of teasers every day via Mars' Instagram account. The teasers included a car parked in front of a strip club, a reptile, and an angry boss played by Luis Guzmán. Duddy along with Mars sought to create [...] "more than a standard strip-club video" [...] by researching and going into strip clubs to appreciate the architecture of the local. Nevertheless, the search for the ideal strip club was fruitless, so Mars and Duddy decided to build one: [...] "a joint that seemed like it was lifted straight out of Havana, dark and <b>sweaty</b> <b>and</b> seemingly untouched by time. They painted the walls themselves, and went back and forth on just what color neon they should use". When the time came to cast someone to play a stripper, the only name was Freida Pinto's one. However, Duddy had some doubts her choice, since he considered her [...] "safe". To this, Mars replied [...] "it's important to use someone who hasn't been seen in this light before". All in all, Duddy confessed that he trusted Mars instincts regarding Pinto's choice for the role. Duddy explained that some scenes recorded for the video were dangerous. Pinto could have harmed herself in the scene where [...] "she sheds her clothes among a sea of sparks", as well as Mars' guitar player [...] "He got dangerously close to having his head burned". Muriel Villera starts as one of the jealous strippers. The official music video was set to premiere on October 14, 2013. Nevertheless, its release was delayed one day by Mars himself stating [...] "I want it to be the best it can be. With that being said, I need one more day". The video, finally arrived on October 15, 2013 exclusively via Facebook.|$|E

2500|$|... "No Sanctuary" [...] {{can be seen}} as a {{transitioning}} {{stage for}} Rick Grimes, who has accepted his brutality whilst retaining his humanity, after attempting to live a peaceful life in the fourth season. Andrew Lincoln, who portrays Rick, said: [...] "there's something about getting dirty, <b>sweaty</b> <b>and</b> bloody that feels right." [...] The episode also featured several reunions in the group - siblings Sasha & Tyreese and baby Judith with Rick & Carl - that were organized by Carol Peletier, who enabled the events that helped the group escape Terminus. Gimple noted that Rick would not respond positively to Carol's return had she not be responsible for assisting in their escape and reuniting him with his daughter. He also believed that the reunions reinforced Rick's motivations in his actions: [...] "for the survival of his children and the sake of love." [...] "No Sanctuary" [...] also displays Tyreese's aversion to violence, and his reluctance to step up, despite being [...] "almost the most powerful" [...] among the primary characters. Kirkman believed that his ability to become violent to survive, such as killing all the walkers outside the cabin with his bare hands, terrifies him, which could be seen as his weakness; Kirkman stated that this will be explored throughout the fifth season.|$|E
