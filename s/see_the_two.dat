25|$|The Common Pursuit, another {{collection}} of his essays from Scrutiny, {{was published in}} 1952. Outside of his work on English poetry and the novel, this is Leavis’s best-known and most influential work. A decade later Leavis was to earn much notoriety when he delivered his Richmond lecture, Two Cultures? The Significance of C. P. Snow at Downing College. Leavis vigorously attacked Snow's suggestion, from a 1959 lecture and book by C. P. Snow (<b>see</b> <b>The</b> <b>Two</b> Cultures), that practitioners of the scientific and humanistic disciplines should have some significant understanding of each other, and {{that a lack of}} knowledge of twentieth-century physics was comparable to an ignorance of Shakespeare. Leavis's ad hominem attacks on Snow's intelligence and abilities were widely decried in the British press by public figures such as Lord Boothby and Lionel Trilling.|$|E

The first shows the baptism of Jesus by John the Baptist and the second Jesus baptizing the faithful as recounted in John 3, Verse 26. Finally Jesus is shown holding discussions with the elders in the temple.|$|E
25|$|As the English {{moved to}} the Spanish {{positions}} a battery of four heavy guns covered the approaches, and Carleill could <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> Spanish galleys moving into position. At least 300 Spanish militia and 200 Indian allies lined the defences. The galleys began to open fire, joined by the defenders of the earthwork. Seeing the Spanish galleys firing too high, Carleill gave the order to charge, yelling 'God and St George!' and after some fighting in which the English pikemen pushed forward, they stormed the seaward end of the defences. Some of the English columns attacked the earthworks from the flank, rolling up the defences as they went. Any defenders were cut down where they stood, and the Spanish now routed fled into the city. Carleill and his men soon clambered over the city walls again pushing aside the defenders and they were now inside the city. They pursued the Spanish through the darkened streets and then were in the central plaza itself. Here the English reformed and then spread out into the city, pockets of resistance left were dealt with after they used the captured Spanish guns on their former users. The rest fled over the San Francisco bridge along with De Bustos but the battle was still not yet won.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{departure}} of Simon Hilton-Jones (John Wraight) from Shortland Street clinic, Chief Executive Officer Michael McKenna (Paul Gittins) decided to poach Grace from his rival Sir. Bruce Warner's (Ken Blackburn) clinic. Bruce was devastated to hear Grace was leaving and made a hugely public announcement of his love {{for her in the}} Kennedy's bar, to which she rejected him. Grace began work at Shortland Street though her naturally flirtatious manner led many to believe she {{was having an affair with}} both Bruce and Michael - even Michael's wife Alex (Liddy Holloway). Grace dated Darryl Neilson (Mark Ferguson) but soon came to realize he was stealing her eggs and selling them off, leading to a break up. She subsequently had a brief relationship with Zac Smith (Mike Edward) but ended up deciding to flee Ferndale after reconciling with Darryl. However Darryl's dead body was found in the Auckland harbor. The following year Grace fell in love with Lionel Skeggins (John Leigh) but instead took up with Minnie's (Katrina Devine) father, Ryan Birch (Robert Harte). However she soon came to realize Ryan had in fact raped her best friend Ellen (Robyn Malcolm) several years beforehand and they broke up. Grace finally got together with Lionel but the romance was short lived and she moved onto Frank Malone (Christopher Hobbs). In 1997 whilst cooking, Grace accidentally severed her finger however luckily managed to reattach it. Shortly after, Grace got a job in Australia and departed Ferndale. The following year, Ellen visited Grace and returned with the news that she had become a mother to two twin boys. Grace returned to Ferndale in October 2013 to audit the hospital following the CEO, Chris Warner's (Michael Galvin) health concerns. It soon transpired that Grace had been through a devastating break up and was in desperate need to be a mother. She made an agreement with Chris that would <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> have sex without complications so as to have a child. Grace then realise that she has feelings for Chris and then tried to stop his wedding to Rachel McKenna. She then leave Ferndale after Chris couldn't return her feelings and she leaves after she lied that she had a miscarriage.|$|E
500|$|Vern Perry of the Orange County Register {{called the}} film fascinating, writing that it skilfully {{combined}} humor and earnestness. He wrote {{that it was}} moving to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> actors talk about their personal lives with such vulnerability—particularly when Nimoy discusses his experiences with alcoholism. Greg Stacy of OC Weekly reported being [...] "thoroughly charmed" [...] by the film, and called [...] "the affection between [...] obvious and touching." ...|$|E
500|$|Negotiations {{over the}} {{marriage}} contract took several months, with Charlotte insisting that she {{not be required}} to leave Britain. The diplomats had no desire to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> thrones united, and so the agreement stated that Britain would go to the couple's oldest son, while the second son would inherit the Netherlands; if there was only one son, the Netherlands would pass to the German branch of the House of Orange. On 10 June 1814, Charlotte signed the marriage contract. [...] Charlotte had become besotted with a Prussian prince whose identity is uncertain; according to Charles Greville, it was Prince Augustus, although historian Arthur Aspinall disagreed, thinking that her love interest was the younger Prince Frederick. At a party at the Pulteney Hotel in London, Charlotte met a Lieutenant-General in the Russian cavalry, Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. The Princess invited Leopold to call on her, an invitation he took up, remaining for three quarters of an hour, and writing a letter to the Prince Regent apologising for any indiscretion. This letter impressed George very much, although he did not consider the impoverished Leopold as a possible suitor for his daughter's hand.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Me Against the Music" [...] was filmed over {{three days in}} October 2003, at Silvercup Studios in Long Island City, New York. It was {{directed}} by Paul Hunter, who revealed that the concept was setting Spears and Madonna apart, hence Spears wore a black outfit whereas Madonna sported a white suit. Spears stated, [...] "The video is more sensual than I'm used to [...] It was my first time doing a collaboration and I got Madonna. It's really interesting to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> different styles together." [...] Kevin Tancharoen was the choreographer of the video. The vehicle used in the video, a Mazda RX-8, was autographed by Spears on the hood and auctioned off to benefit the Britney Spears Foundation. In 2009, Hunter talked to MTV News about the video, saying, [...] "Madonna is an icon of an earlier generation, and then Britney of the newer generation. She was at her peak at that point [...] So {{it was a challenge}} to kind of bring both of the worlds together. I wanted it to {{be a bit of a}} cat-and-mouse sort of game and a little bit of a foreplay between Britney and Madonna and just sort of tease the audience." ...|$|E
500|$|Reese and Wernick were on set every day, which Reynolds {{personally}} {{paid for}} after Fox was unwilling to. The writers had scripted the action very specifically, [...] "every kill and almost down to every punch, kick, or shot", but Tim Miller and the stunt coordinators {{were free to}} change this. Robert Alonzo and Philip J. Silvera were the stunt coordinators for the film; Silvera had provided motion capture reference for the test footage. The stunt team had a month before filming began to prepare the actors, with Skrein working [...] "nonstop" [...] to prepare. Silvera said Reynolds [...] "has a photographic memory; he'd do something {{three or four times}} and remember it very well." [...] A lot of the jokes in the film were improvised on set, particularly by Reynolds. He said that the actors often came up with around 15 alternate jokes for each one written in the script, and were generally only limited to those because of time constraints. Reese said, for example, Wernick had written some jokes for the scene where Deadpool visits Colossus and Negasonic, but on set Reynolds improvised the line [...] "You know it’s funny how I only <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> of you here. It’s like the studio couldn’t afford any more X-Men." [...] This was based in truth, and became then Fox chairman Jim Gianopulos’ favorite line.|$|E
500|$|Michael Tedder of New York {{felt that}} the main story was weak and that the [...] "plot line might have made more sense last year, with Andy trying to take his mind off {{troubles}} with Erin or Robert California by trying to regress to his college days without it working, but these days Andy is the boss and has the girl." [...] He did, however, compliment the appearance of Colbert, writing that [...] "it was still nice to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> Daily Show alums sparring again." [...] He was also complimentary towards the [...] "little tidbits", such as Dwight's subplot. Bonnie Stiergnberg of Paste {{felt that the}} episode was too rushed and that the storylines {{did not have a}} chance to naturally play out. She wrote that, [...] "Each thread provided some interesting character development or set up future storylines, but, crammed together in the same 21 minutes, they made for a slightly disjointed-feeling episode." [...] WhatCulture! reviewer Joseph Kratzer gave the episode two-and-a-half stars out of five and called it the [...] "first dud of the ninth season". He criticized the story, saying that [...] "the plot's failure [...] the goal of the story was not met by the means the writers chose to employ; there was no sense of grand scope or deep-rooted history, just Andy being petty and refusing {{to let go of the}} past as he's challenged by his old friend." [...] Kratzer called Dwight and Nellie's subplot the [...] "most successful story" [...] in the episode.|$|E

500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} positive reviews from television critics. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, said that it [...] "contains some superb touching character scenes between Homer and Lisa, a fascinating glimpse of Marge's insecurities, and some nice touches that take it above the show's very high average." [...] Dave Foster of DVD Times said that [...] "Bart on the Road" [...] is an episode which is built upon a [...] "frankly ludicrous" [...] idea which if the writers were to [...] "stumble upon" [...] now, [...] "we'd simply see Bart happen upon a license and skip town without anyone noticing, but here they do give the setup {{a great deal of}} consideration {{both on and off the}} screen." [...] He thought the story was [...] "partly believable, though the opportunity when Bart hits the road is largely wasted with only a few well constructed jokes to speak of." [...] Foster thinks, [...] "what saves the episode is the opportunity to see Lisa and Homer connect, once again displaying what a strong season this is for Lisa as we <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> share some wonderfully tender moments, alongside some genuinely laugh-out-loud moments." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson enjoyed the episode and said that he [...] "loves" [...] the children's experiences at their parents' jobs, adding, [...] "and when they head out of town, the fun continues. Any episode that sends the kids to the site of the World's Fair is OK by me." [...] Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict considered the best part of the episode to be when Patty and Selma explain their job at the DMV: [...] "Somedays we don't let the line move at all. We call those weekdays." [...] Malkowski concluded her review by giving the episode a grade of B+. John Thorpe of Central Michigan Life named it the eighth best episode of the series. Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode a score of 9.5 out of 10, calling it [...] "outstanding" [...] and summarizing his review with: [...] ""Bart on the Road" [...] is a fun trip and very funny, but it's the way everything comes together that really makes it memorable." ...|$|E

2500|$|In special relativity, {{however, the}} {{distance}} between two points {{is no longer the}} same if it measured by two different observers when one of the observers is moving, because of the Lorentz contraction. [...] The situation is ever more complicated if the two points are separated in time as well as in space. For example, if one observer sees two events occur at the same place, but at different times, a person moving with respect to the first observer will <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> events occurring at different places, because (from their point of view) they are stationary, and the position of the event is receding or approaching.
