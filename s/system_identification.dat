2500|$|The {{process of}} {{determining}} the equations that govern the model's dynamics is called <b>system</b> <b>identification.</b> This can be done off-line: for example, executing a series of measures from which to calculate an approximated mathematical model, typically its transfer function or matrix. Such identification from the output, however, cannot take account of unobservable dynamics. Sometimes the model is built directly starting from known physical equations, for example, {{in the case of}} a [...] system we know that [...] Even assuming that a [...] "complete" [...] model is used in designing the controller, all the parameters included in these equations (called [...] "nominal parameters") are never known with absolute precision; the control system will have to behave correctly even when connected to a physical system with true parameter values away from nominal.|$|E
2500|$|The upper {{arguments}} were valid {{up to the}} late 1990s. However, recent advances in numerical computing have shown a come back of the force method, {{especially in the case}} of nonlinear systems. New frameworks have been developed that allow [...] "exact" [...] formulations irrespectively of the type or nature of the system nonlinearities. The main advantages of the flexibility method is that the result error is independent of the discretization of the model and that it is indeed a very fast method. For instance, the elastic-plastic solution of a continuous beam using the force method requires only 4 beam elements whereas a commercial [...] "stiffness based" [...] FEM code requires 500 elements in order to give results with the same accuracy. To conclude, one can say that in the case where the solution of the problem requires recursive evaluations of the force field like in the case of structural optimization or <b>system</b> <b>identification,</b> the efficiency of the flexibility method is indisputable.|$|E
2500|$|In Shadowrun, {{corporations}} are effectively [...] "ranked" [...] {{by the amount}} of assets under their control, including material, personnel, and property, as well as profit. These ranks are A, AA, and AAA; AAA {{corporations are}} top tier. Most corporations in the AA and AAA level are immune to domestic law, responsible only to themselves, and regulated only by the Corporate Court, an assembly of the ten AAA-rated corporations. All AAA-rated and most AA-rated corporations exhibit a privilege known as [...] "extraterritoriality", meaning that any land owned by the corp is sovereign territory only to the corp and immune to any laws of the country within. Corporate territory is not foreign soil but corporate soil, just like its employees are corporate citizens, though dual citizenship in a corporation and a nation is common. The AAA corps, as well as numerous minor corporations, fight each other not only in the boardroom or during high-level business negotiations but also with physical destruction, clandestine operations, hostile extraction or elimination of vital personnel, and other means of sabotage. Because no corporation wants to be held liable for damages, {{it has to be done}} by deniable assets, or shadowrunners, invisible to the system where every citizen is tagged with a <b>System</b> <b>Identification</b> Number (SIN).|$|E
40|$|In recent years, applied {{researchers}} {{have become increasingly}} interested in Adaptive Search (AS), techniques such as the Genetic Algorithm (GA) [1], and Genetic Programming GP [2], for engineering design [3]. This paper illustrates {{the effectiveness of the}} genetic programming paradigm for simple fluid <b>systems</b> <b>identification</b> problems. The objective of the paper is to establish methods for <b>systems</b> <b>identification</b> using GP and sets of empirical data. The manipulation and optimisation of these approximate functions that describe the physical process is achieved using the GP approach and by the development of complementary AS techniques. Two new GP operators are introduced, the first searches through possible values of terminals for a particular functional tree structure, and the second uses functional induction [4] to improve the performance of the technique.

40|$|Abstrac:. - In this work, an {{approach}} based on Genetic Programming is {{proposed for the}} input-output <b>systems</b> <b>identification</b> problem. Laguerre's functions and the ARX method have been commonly used to solve the <b>systems</b> <b>identification</b> problem. Recently, approaches based on Artificial Neural Networks {{have been used to}} solve this problem. Genetic Programming is an Evolutionary Computation technique based on the evolution of mathematical symbols (constant, functions, variables, operators, etc.). To achieve the identification, a set of analysis trees is used to describe the different models (individuals) that our approach proposes during its execution. At the end of the evolutionary process, an input-output model of the system is propo ed by our approach (it is the best individual) ...|$|R

We conducted experiments with two different approaches, the classical GMM-based speaker <b>identification</b> <b>system</b> and the Phonetic speaker <b>identification</b> <b>system.</b> Our experimental results showed that current standard voice transformation techniques are able to fool the GMM-based system but not the Phonetic speaker <b>identification</b> <b>system.</b> These findings imply that future speaker <b>identification</b> <b>systems</b> should include idiosyncratic knowledge in order to successfully distinguish transformed speech from natural speech and thus be armed against imposter attacks...|$|R
