40|$|It is well {{accepted}} that, {{for ages}} 30 and above, human mortality rates increase with age, yet no established graduation method makes direct {{use of this}} knowledge. Such a method is offered in this paper. Under the constant-force-of-mortality assumption, Bayes estimates (graduated values) are de-veloped for the force of mortality. Smoothness of the graduated values is obtained by imposing one of two possible restrictions on the model [...] either that the force of mortality is increasing or that it is increasing and convex. This is accomplished by defining a prior distribution that assigns all of its probability to the set of parameters that satisfies the restriction. The resulting graduated values will automatically satisfy whichever smoothness restriction was assumed in the model. Readers interested in obtaining a computer program to do these gradua-tions should <b>send</b> <b>a</b> <b>self-addressed,</b> stamped mailer and a 5. 25 -inch double-sided double-density diskette to the author at his Yearbook address.

40|$|The {{three basic}} forms of prize gaming are gambling, sweepstakes, and contests. Most {{states have a}} common {{approach}} to determining the legality of prize gaming. In general, states analyze if an activity includes three factors associated with gambling: (1) opportunity to win a prize, (2) winning based on chance, and (3) consideration paid to take that chance. If you take away {{any one of the}} three elements of gambling—consideration, prize, or chance—you have an activity that is lawful in most states. A contest, for example, differs from gambling because the winner is determined by skill. Determination of whether a (pay-for-play) skill game (with prizes) is a permitted game as opposed to a prohibited game (of chance) is based on the relative degrees of skill and chance present in the game. In most states, if skill is the predominant factor in determining a winner, the game is lawful. “[S]weepstakes always contain the elements of chance and prize, so the element of consideration must be eliminated to avoid violating” gambling or lottery prohibitions. Ascertaining what is consideration can prove, however, to be difficult. This Article addresses how the element of consideration is analyzed in the context of whether a particular activity is illegal gambling or a legal sweepstakes. For example, the ABA survey activity certainly has both prizes and a chance drawing that determines winners, but does the requirement that you must complete a survey for entry constitute consideration? What about the retail promotions through which you receive a game piece for buying products? What about an unlicensed slot machine that you can play by either inserting <b>a</b> coin or <b>sending</b> <b>a</b> <b>self-addressed,</b> stamped envelope to receive a code that permits you to play one game for free?

40|$|While mail surveys {{offer an}} {{efficient}} and cost {{effective means of}} gathering large amounts of student-related data {{in a relatively short}} time, surveys characterized by low response rates may have a biasing effect on information. To examine this bias, a study was undertaken of the characteristics associated with samples from three graduate follow-up surveys conducted at CCP between i 989 and 1991. Demographic characteristics, entering academic abilities, academic eAgagement, and persistence were examined for survey respondents, voluntary nonrespondents who received the survey and chose not to participate, and involuntary nonrespondents who did not receive the questionnaire due to an incorrect address. The most consistent group differences were associated with academic performance and persistence. Respondents earned higher grade point averages (GPA's) and persisted for a longer time than nonrespondents. Voluntary nonrespondents were less academically successful and persisted for longer periods than involuntary nonrespondents. Results indicate that survey results may be skewed since the more positive a student's a 3 demic experience, the more likely she/he is to respond. The following strategies are suggested {{to reduce the number of}} nonresponses: (1) <b>send</b> <b>a</b> short, professional introductory letter and a simple, logical questionnaire; (2) include <b>a</b> <b>self-addressed</b> stamped envelope; (3) personalize the letter; (4) <b>send</b> <b>a</b> second survey to nonrespondents; and (5) remind students of the importance of making address changes.
