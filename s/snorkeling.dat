5|$|Biscayne National Park {{operates}} year-round. Camping is {{most practical}} in winter months, when mosquitoes are less troublesome on the keys. Private concessioners provide full day tours {{in the park}} that include <b>snorkeling,</b> hiking, paddling and sailing from the park headquarters. Boat excursions to Boca Chita and Adams Key are also available.|$|E
5|$|Local economies near major {{coral reefs}} {{benefit from an}} {{abundance}} of fish and other marine creatures as a food source. Reefs also provide recreational scuba diving and <b>snorkeling</b> tourism. These activities can damage coral but international projects such as Green Fins that encourage dive and snorkel centres to follow a Code of Conduct have been proven to mitigate these risks.|$|E

5|$|Access to {{the park}} from the {{mainland}} {{is limited to the}} immediate vicinity of the Dante Fascell Visitor Center at Convoy Point. All other portions of the park are reachable only by private or concessioner boats. Activities include boating, fishing, kayaking, windsurfing, <b>snorkeling</b> and scuba diving. Miami-Dade County operates four marina parks near the park. Homestead Bayfront Park is directly adjacent {{to the park}} headquarters at Convoy Point. Farther south Black Point Park provides access to Adams and Elliott Keys. Matheson Hammock Park is near {{the north end of the}} park, and Crandon Park is on Key Biscayne.|$|E
5|$|Fishing is {{the primary}} source of income, {{although}} coconut palm, buxa coloring, cashew nuts and fruits are produced for trade. Because of its reef and extensive beaches, the <b>snorkeling</b> industry is gaining in popularity in Msambweni, and holiday cottages and hotels have sprung up in the area, such as the Msambweni Beach House. The town is noted for its leprosarium and contains the Msambweni District Hospital. The Koromojo Dam is immediately north of the town.|$|E
5|$|The encyclopedist Song Yingxing (1587–1666) {{documented}} a {{wide array}} of technologies, metallurgic and industrial processes in his Tiangong Kaiwu encyclopedia of 1637. This includes mechanical and hydraulic powered devices for agriculture and irrigation, nautical technology such as vessel types and <b>snorkeling</b> gear for pearl divers, the annual processes of sericulture and weaving with the loom, metallurgic processes such as the crucible technique and quenching, manufacturing processes such as for roasting iron pyrite in converting sulphide to oxide in sulfur used in gunpowder compositions – illustrating how ore was piled up with coal briquettes in an earthen furnace with a still-head that sent over sulfur as vapor that would solidify and crystallize – and the use of gunpowder weapons such as a naval mine ignited by use of a rip-cord and steel flint wheel.|$|E

5|$|Most {{of these}} {{hypotheses}} have been discredited or rejected. For example, {{there is no}} hole {{at the end of}} the crest for a <b>snorkeling</b> function. There are no muscle scars for a proboscis and it is dubious that an animal with a beak would need one. As a proposed airlock, it would not have kept out water. The proposed air reservoir would have been insufficient for an animal the size of Parasaurolophus. Other hadrosaurids had large heads without needing large hollow crests to serve as attachment points for supporting ligaments. Also, none of the proposals explain why the crest has such a shape, why other lambeosaurines should have crests that look much different but perform a similar function, how crestless or solid-crested hadrosaurids got along without such capabilities, or why some hadrosaurids had solid crests. These considerations particularly impact hypotheses based on increasing the capabilities of systems already present in the animal, such as the salt gland and olfaction hypotheses, and indicate that these were not primary functions of the crest. Additionally, work on the nasal cavity of lambeosaurines shows that olfactory nerves and corresponding sensory tissue were largely outside the portion of the nasal passages in the crest, so the expansion of the crest had little to do with the sense of smell.|$|E

5000|$|Aqua Lung Impulse 2 <b>Snorkel</b> - This <b>snorkel</b> {{contains}} a one-way valve that prevents water {{from entering the}} diver's mouth.|$|R
50|$|Although it may {{be easier}} to breathe through a <b>snorkel</b> while {{swimming}} or floating at the surface, clearing valves may fail, or the <b>snorkel</b> may be lost. If the snorkeler is competent at swimming without a <b>snorkel,</b> the risk of drowning in these circumstances is reduced.|$|R
50|$|The first U-boats {{fitted with}} <b>snorkels</b> (German: Schnorchel) went into service in August 1943. The <b>snorkel</b> was {{basically}} an extendable pipe that allowed U-boats {{to take in}} air without surfacing, allowing the U-boat's diesel engines to run submerged for longer periods. However, the <b>snorkel</b> suffered from technical problems and did not see wide use until mid-1944. Allied radar also became precise enough to pick up even the small target of the <b>snorkel.</b>|$|R
25|$|The islets and {{islands of}} Guyam, Daku, Naked or Pansukian, La Janosa, Pig-ot, Dinagat, Bucas Grande, Britania and the General island in Cantilan feature white-sand beaches which are ringed by coral reefs {{suitable}} for swimming and <b>snorkeling.</b>|$|E

25|$|Free-diving was {{the primary}} source of income for many Gulf {{nationals}} such as Qataris, Emiratis, and Bahrainis and Kuwaitis. As a result, Qatari, Emirati and Bahraini heritage promoters have popularized recreational and serious events associated with freediving, underwater equipment and related activities such as <b>snorkeling.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Dead space can be {{increased}} (and better envisioned) by breathing through a long tube, such as a <b>snorkel.</b> Even though {{one end of the}} <b>snorkel</b> is open to the air, when the wearer breathes in, they inhale a significant quantity of air that remained in the <b>snorkel</b> from the previous exhalation.

25|$|The Topography of the site. Coral reefs, drop offs (underwater cliffs), rock reefs, gullies and caves can be spectacular. Deep dive sites mean divers must {{reduce the}} time they spend because more gas is breathed at depth and {{decompression}} sickness risks increase. Shallow regions can be investigated by <b>snorkeling.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Snorkeling</b> in Jellyfish Lake is {{a popular}} {{activity}} for tourists to Palau. Several tour operators in Koror offer trips to the lake. Eil Malk island is approximately a 45-minute boat ride from Koror. The lake is accessed by a short trail from the beach on Eil Malk to the lake.|$|E
50|$|A vehicle <b>snorkel</b> is the {{land-based}} {{equivalent of}} the submarine <b>snorkel</b> which allows submarines to use diesel engines while submerged. <b>Snorkels,</b> when used by vehicles with air-breathing internal combustion engines, sometimes allow limited deep fording capability for river crossing or amphibious landing operations, {{particularly in the case}} of tanks and other armored vehicles. In such cases, the <b>snorkel</b> supplies air for both the engine and the sealed crew compartment, allowing total submersion. Often, the <b>snorkel</b> pipe is of large diameter and fits over the crew hatch, to provide an escape route for the crew in case the vehicle becomes stuck or disabled while underwater.|$|R
