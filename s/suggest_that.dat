5|$|Activity {{gradually}} declined {{over the}} next two years but stabilized at a higher level than before 1975. The increased level of fumarolic activity has continued at Mount Baker since 1975, but no other changes <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> magma movement is involved.|$|E
5|$|Additional varve counts {{from the}} Lake Missoula Basin, Sanpoil River, and Latah Creek <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> {{the time between}} floods was 30-40 years on average.|$|E

5|$|Although it is {{generally}} agreed that the aye-aye is the most basal member of the lemur clade, {{the relationship between the}} other four families is less clear since they diverged during a narrow 10 to 12million-year window between the Late Eocene (42mya) and into the Oligocene (30mya). Although all studies place Cheirogaleidae and Lepilemuridae as a sister clade to Indriidae and Lemuridae, some <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> Cheirogaleidae and Lepilemuridae diverged first, while others <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> Indriidae and Lemuridae were the first to branch off.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{excavations}} <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> Native Americans have {{inhabited the}} Seattle area {{for at least}} 4,000 years. By the time the first European settlers arrived, the people (subsequently called the Duwamish tribe) occupied at least seventeen villages in the areas around Elliott Bay.|$|E
5|$|Astrometric {{observations}} {{made with}} the Hubble Space Telescope <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> the outer planet 55 Cancri d is inclined at 53° {{with respect to the}} plane of the sky. The inner planets b and e are inclined at 85°. The inclination of f is unknown.|$|E
5000|$|The current Basque name is Amendüze-Unaso. Jean-Baptiste Orpustan <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> Oneix {{means the}} 'place of {{abundant}} hills'. Brigitte Jobbé-Duval however <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> Oneix {{came from the}} Basque Unanu which means the Asphodelus (plant) and signifies a [...] "place where the asphodelus is abundant. She also <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the origin of Amendeuix was Aquitane-Roman to designate a noble domain.|$|R

40|$|Research on {{confidence}} judgements <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> {{people are}} often overconfident. However, some {{studies have found that}} depressed mood reduces this positive bias. To date this has been explained as a mood phenomenon. In this study we explore an alternative theory which <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> confidence is related to internal judgements of social rank and status. This theory <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> the lower one perceives oneself to be in status and rank the less one can afford to be overconfident. Data from a student population <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> confidence judgements are associated with internal judgements of status...|$|R

5|$|Comparisons {{between the}} scleral rings and {{estimated}} orbit size of Plateosaurus and modern birds and reptiles <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> {{it may have}} been cathemeral, active throughout the day and night, possibly avoiding the midday heat.|$|E
50|$|Altenmüller <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> Khentkaus {{was none}} other than the lady Redjedjet {{mentioned}} in the Westcar Papyrus. He <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> Khentkaus was the mother of Userkaf, Sahure and Neferirkare Kakai.|$|R

50|$|The {{historian}} Zosimus in his Historia Nova <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> {{during the}} sack of Rome in 410 by Alaric I, Innocent I {{was willing to}} permit private pagan practices as a temporary measure. However, Zosimus also <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> this attempt by pagans to restore public worship failed {{due to lack of}} public interest, <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> Rome had been successfully Christianized in the last century.|$|R

5|$|Differences in {{architectural}} style between elite residential complexes {{and in the}} activities carried out at them <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> the aristocracy of Motul de San José was divided into several distinct classes, including the royal family resident in Group C, royal courtiers and low to middle rank nobles.|$|E
5|$|Estimates for {{the total}} number of {{casualties}} in the war vary, because many deaths went unrecorded. Most <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> some 60 million people died in the war, including about 20 million military personnel and 40 million civilians.|$|E

50|$|Male Bokermannohyla vulcaniae have {{anatomical}} features <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> {{they are}} able to vocalize, however, the vocal activity of the species is unknown, <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> the calling period of males is short.|$|R
5|$|Further {{observations}} will {{be needed}} in order to determine S/2015 (136472) 1's orbit. If it is circular, it would <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> S/2015 (136472) 1 was formed by an ancient impact event, but if it is elliptical, it suggests that it may have been captured.|$|E
5|$|Herennianus and Timolaus: the {{two were}} {{mentioned}} in the Augustan History and are not attested in any other source; Herennianus might be a conflation of Hairan and Herodianus while Timolaus is most probably a fabrication, although Dietmar Kienast <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> he might be Vaballathus.|$|E
5|$|Historians have {{remarked that}} here Darwin {{anticipated}} the modern {{concept of an}} ecological niche. He did not <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> every favourable variation must be selected, nor that the favoured animals were better or higher, but merely more adapted to their surroundings.|$|E

50|$|Studies {{under an}} {{electron}} microscope have <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> pterobranchs {{belong to the}} same clade as the extinct graptolites, and phylogenetic analysis <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> the pterobranchs are living members of the graptolite clade.|$|R
25|$|The Ctenophora and the sponges {{are unique}} among {{the animals in}} lacking true hox genes. The {{presence}} of a Hox/Parahox gene in the Placozoa <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> either the Porifera or the Ctenophora are the most basal animal clades. Another DNA based study <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> the Ctenophora are the earliest branching animals. Another study also <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> this group are a sister group to other animals.|$|R
5|$|However, {{studies by}} Graham Sinden (2009) <b>suggest</b> <b>that,</b> in practice, the {{variations}} in thousands of wind turbines, spread out over several different sites and wind regimes, are smoothed. As the distance between sites increases, the correlation between wind speeds measured at those sites, decreases.|$|E
5|$|Its {{measured}} brightness is , translating into {{a diameter}} of about 22% of its primary, or {{in the range of}} , assuming similar albedo. To put this in perspective, this would make it larger than all but four of the asteroids, after 1 Ceres, 2 Pallas, 4 Vesta, and 10 Hygiea. In spite of its relatively large size, however, lightcurve studies <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> Hi'iaka is not a gravitationally collapsed spheroid; they further <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> Hi'iaka is not tidally locked and has a rotation period of about 9.8 hours.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many other}} {{strictly}} mycorrhizal fungi, B.edulis has to date eluded cultivation attempts.

The author <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> if there are shortcomings to cognitive theory the sameshortcomings may apply to cognitive therapy.
