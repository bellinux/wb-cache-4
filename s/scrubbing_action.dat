50|$|Squirm {{occurs when}} the scrub radius is at zero. When the pivot point is in the exact center of the tire footprint, this causes <b>scrubbing</b> <b>action</b> in {{opposite}} directions when the wheels are turned. Tire wear and some instability in corners is the result.|$|E
50|$|The {{combination}} of these three natural principles along with an internal mercury switch that tells the microchip that the unit has gone from a horizontal to vertical position as it climbs a wall allows it to change direction from ascending to descending the wall at pre-programmed intervals based on the average height of a pool walls. Some machines have delayed timers that cause the robot to remain at the water line, where more dirt accumulates, for momentarily resulting in a <b>scrubbing</b> <b>action,</b> much like the wheels of a powerful automobile spinning or peeling out.|$|E
50|$|The most {{effective}} method for producing intense turbulence {{is by the}} impingement of one flame on another. This action is secured {{through the use of}} burners located {{in each of the four}} corners of the furnace, close to the floor or the water-screen. The burner nozzles are so directed that the streams of coal and air are projected along a line tangent to a small circle, lying in a horizontal plane, at the center of the furnace. Intensive mixing occurs where these streams meet. A <b>scrubbing</b> <b>action</b> is present which assures contact between the combustible and oxygen, thus promoting rapid combustion and reducing carbon loss. A rotative motion, similar to that of a cyclone, is imparted to the flame body, which spreads out and fills the furnace area. The ignition at each burner is aided by the flame from the preceding one.|$|E

Scrubbing {{behavior}} of a traditional streaming video player, the Swift interface [16], and our new Swifter interface, which shows multiple frames around the active timeline location and allows for direct selection of each frame. Online streaming video systems have become extremely popular, yet navigating to target scenes of interest can be a challenge. While recent techniques have been introduced to enable real-time seeking, they break down for large videos, where scrubbing the timeline causes video frames to skip and flash too quickly to be comprehendible. We present Swifter, a new video scrubbing technique that displays a grid of pre-cached thumbnails during <b>scrubbing</b> <b>actions.</b> In a series of studies, we first investigate possible design variations of the Swifter technique, {{and the impact of}} those variations on its performance. Guided by these results we compare an implementation of Swifter to the previously published Swift technique, in addition to the approaches utilized by YouTube and Netfilx. Our results show that Swifter significantly outperforms each of these techniques in a scene locating task, by a factor of up to 48 %...|$|R

50|$|WSP is {{generally}} {{fitted as standard}} to new fleets of multiple units. The primary function of the WSP {{is to improve the}} ability of a train to stop in poor adhesion conditions. However, within the rail industry it is also recognised to be valuable in protecting the wheels from damage during sliding when braking or spinning in traction. This improvement is achieved by regulation of the wheelset velocity in a controlled manner so that it maintains a relatively consistent level of slip. The controlled slip has the effect of conditioning the contamination layer on the rail (<b>scrubbing</b> <b>action)</b> thereby improving the level of friction and enhancing the ability of the train to stop. Controlled wheel slip can also have a limited cleaning action on the rail head along the length of a train. This tends to result in the vehicles at the rear having more grip than those at the front.|$|E
40|$|The testing {{technique}} {{consisted of}} towing the skids with a ground test vehicle over asphalt and concrete surfaces at ground {{speeds up to}} 80 km/hr (50 mph) and bearing pressures up to 689 kPa (100 psi) over sliding distances up to 1585 m (5200 ft). Results indicate that the friction coefficient developed by wire brush skids is essentially independent of ground speed, is slightly increased with increasing bearing pressure, is noticeably affected by surface texture, and is not degraded by surface wetness. Skid wear is shown to increase with increasing bearing pressure and with increasing ground speed and {{is dependent on the}} nature of the surface. Runway surface damage caused by the skids was in the form of an abrasive <b>scrubbing</b> <b>action</b> rather than physical damage...|$|E
40|$|Deposition of silica {{scale on}} heat {{transfer}} surfaces is a problem which must be solved before economic power generation from many high temperature geothermal brines will be possible. As {{a part of the}} liquid fluidized bed heat exchanger development project, a preliminary silica deposition study was conducted using a laboratory bench scale unit. The {{purpose of this study was}} to establish an experimental technique for a series of more extensive silica deposition rate tests and to determine the feasibility of using a liquid fluidized bed heat exchanger for power generation in geothermal brines which contain high concentrations of dissolved silica. After 22 days of circulating a synthetic silica-calcite brine through the heat exchanger apparatus, no significant changes were observed in the outside heat transfer coefficient and no scale had deposited on the cooling coil or the glass heat exchanger tank where they were exposed to the <b>scrubbing</b> <b>action</b> of the fluidized bed. However, amorphous silica and calcite deposited on the non-fluidized portions of the apparatus...|$|E

40|$|A {{method and}} {{apparatus}} for cleaning rubber deposits from surfaces such as airport runways and roadways is disclosed. The apparatus includes a large vehicle {{that has the}} capacity to be loaded so as to effectively add weight to the rubber cleaning tires of the vehicle. In addition, the vehicle has a water tank and sprinkler system so that the surface may be wetted {{down in front of the}} tires as the vehicle proceeds across the surface. The cleaning tires of the apparatus are aligned so that they are at a yaw angle to the direction of travel, and the cleaning tire assembly is attached to the underside of the trailer of the vehicle and positioned between a forward and rear water tank. In addition, this tire assembly is equipped with a means of loading the tires onto the contaminated surface. The method comprises driving such a vehicle at low speeds down the surface as the road is being wet in front of the cleaning tires. The effect of the angled tires is to create a <b>scrubbing</b> <b>action</b> that not only heats the rubber deposits by friction but also causes it to be removed from the surface. The rubber that does not stick to the cleaning tires is then removed from the surface by sweeping...|$|E
40|$|Automatic {{floor cleaner}} {{is a system}} that enables {{cleaning}} of the floor by the help of highly stabilized and rapidly functionalized electronic and mechanical control system. Current project work targets to use automatic floor cleaner for large floor in house-hold purposes and office floors. The cleaning purpose is specifically carried out by continuous relative motion between a scrubber and the floor surface. During the cleaning and moving operation of vehicle a propulsion mechanism such as driven wheels and guide wheels for the dry tracking on the floor surface to be cleaned, suction of water is carried out by vacuum pump, <b>scrubbing</b> <b>action</b> is done by the scrubber directing water towards rear end. Preferably, a sweeper mechanism is mounted on the body forwarded by propulsion mechanism and operated with such control system for advance sweeping of a debris-laden floor surface. A PID controller is used to govern the motion of system which takes the input from sensor circuit and feeds it back to microcontroller which gives rise to the simulation of wheel in a synchronized manner. The new automatic floor cleaner will save huge cost of labor in future. The basic advantage of this product is that it will be cost effective and no human control is needed. Once put in on mode it will clean the whole room without any omission of surfac...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Based on the oxidation-free fluxless bonding tech-nology, we have {{developed}} a bonding process to manufacture In–Au joints on copper substrates. 4 mm 4 mm Si blank dice and 6 mm 6 mm copper substrates are used. The dice are de-posited with indium-rich Au/In/Cr multilayer structure in a single high vacuum cycle to prevent oxidation. Right after deposition, the outer Au layer interacts with the In layer to form AuIn 2 inter-metallic compound. This compound is quite stable and thus can protect the In layer against oxygen penetration when it is exposed to ambient. On the other hand, it can easily be dissolved by the molten In during the bonding process. The substrate is deposited with Cr and Au. The dice are bonded to the substrates at 180 C in inert environment. Nearly void-free joints have been obtained as examined by a 75 MHz Scanning Acoustic Microscope (SAM). Cross sections of several samples are studied using SEM and EDX to identify the microstructure and composition of the joints. Shear test has been performed according to MIL-STD- 883 C. All the well-bonded devices meet the shear test force requirement. Despite the large mismatch on the thermal expansion coefficient between silicon and copper, no die cracking is observed on the 30 samples produced. To assess further endurance, two samples underwent thermal cycling test between 50 and 120 C for 20 cycles. SAM examination indicates that the joints incur little degradation after the test. This bonding method requires neither flux nor <b>scrubbing</b> <b>action.</b> It is thus particularly attractive for bonding devices that cannot be exposed to flux.

40|$|Introduction: Adding {{antibacterial}} {{agents to}} a dentin conditioner {{used for a}} glass ionomer cement (GIC) {{has been shown to}} be antibacterial; however, it is not known whether this antimicrobial conditioning agent affects the bond strength to dentin in situ. This study applied GIC to antibacterial conditioned dentin without rinsing and determined whether there is an affect on the material's bond strength. Materials and Methods: Chlorhexidine acetate (CX), benzalkonium chloride (BC) and cetrimide (CT) were added to Dentin Conditioner (DC) (GC Corp, Japan) at 1 % and 5 % concentrations. Molars were sectioned coronally to expose dentin, onto which 50 μl of the test conditioners was applied for 20 seconds with a gentle <b>scrubbing</b> <b>action</b> and the residual liquid was blotted dry, as would occur under "field" conditions when performing atraumatic restorative therapy. To serve as the control, the DC was left in situ and compared to the DC that was washed off. Proportioned Fuji IX GIC (GC Corp, Japan) was built-up on the prepared dentin surface and varnish was applied and stored for 24 hours. An annular saw was used to create sticks of GIC bonded to dentin, with a bonding area 1 mm 2. After 24 hours, the specimens were tested to failure in a Universal testing machine at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/minute. Results: Five percent CX-DC was not tested, as it formed a precipitate. Results in MPa: DC-not washed, 9. 3 ± 2. 4; DC-washed, 9. 3 ± 2. 5; 1 %BC-DC, 8. 8 ± 2. 5; 1 %CX-DC, 8. 7 ± 2. 7; 1 %CT-DC, 8. 2 ± 1. 7; 5 %CT-DC, 8. 1 ± 2. 7; 5 %BC-DC, 5. 4 ± 1. 0. One-way ANOVA showed that there was a significant difference between the test groups (p< 0. 05), and Tukey's studentized range test showed that only 5 % BC-dentin conditioner left in situ was significantly different from the other groups. Conclusion: Under the conditions tested, only the 5 % BC-DC left in situ affected the bond strength of Fuji IX to dentin. ©Operative Dentistry, 2005. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
