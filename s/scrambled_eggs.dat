500|$|On 1 April 1958 Fleming {{wrote to}} The Manchester Guardian in defence of his work, {{referring}} to that paper's review of Dr. No. While referring to Bond's {{food and wine}} consumption as [...] "gimmickery", Fleming bemoaned that [...] "it has become an unfortunate trade-mark. I myself abhor Wine-and-Foodmanship. My own favourite food is scrambled eggs." [...] Fleming was so keen on <b>scrambled</b> <b>eggs</b> that he used his short story, [...] "007 in New York", to provide his favourite recipe for the dish: in the story, this came from the housekeeper of Fleming's friend Ivar Bryce, May, who gave her name to Bond's own housekeeper. Academic Edward Biddulph observed that Fleming fully described seventy meals within the book series and that while {{a number of these}} had items in common—such as <b>scrambled</b> <b>eggs</b> and steaks—each meal was different from the others.|$|E
