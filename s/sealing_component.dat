40|$|This {{invention}} {{relates to}} a self-expanding intraluminal composite prosthesis comprised of a rigid reinforcing component and <b>sealing</b> <b>component.</b> The prosthesis may be fabricated {{as either a}} straight or bifurcated tubular structure and is applicable {{to the treatment of}} any bodily passage including, but not limited to, vascular applications, e. g., aneurysms, arteriovenous fistulas, as well as stenotic regions of the peripheral circulation which have been percutaneously dilated but are at high risk for restenosis. The major attributes of this prosthesis can include the use of a unique multilayered biaxial braid which thereby creates a homogeneously blended composite with isotropic deformation and expansion characteristics and an associated high contraction ratio.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to assess the {{availability}} of technologies to seal underground openings. The technologies are needed to seal the potential high-level radioactive waste repository at Yucca Mountain. Technologies are evaluated for three basic categories of seal components: backfill (general fill and graded fill), bulkheads, and grout curtains. Not only is placement of <b>seal</b> <b>components</b> assessed, but also preconditioning of the placement area and <b>seal</b> <b>component</b> durability. The approach taken was: First, review selected sealing case histories (literature searches and site visits) from the mining, civil, and defense industries; second, determine whether reasonably available technologies to seal the potential repository exist; and finally, identify deficiencies in existing technologies. It is concluded that reasonably available technologies do exist to place backfill, bulkheads, and grout curtains. Technologies also exist to precondition areas where <b>seal</b> <b>components</b> are to be placed. However, if final performance requirements are stringent for these engineered structures, some existing technologies {{may need to be}} developed. Deficiencies currently do exist in technologies that demonstrate the long-term durability and performance of <b>seal</b> <b>components.</b> Case histories do not currently exist that demonstrate the placement of <b>seal</b> <b>components</b> in greatly elevated thermal and high-radiation environments and in areas where ground support (rock bolts and concrete liners) has been removed.

40|$|The {{potential}} repository {{system is}} intended to isolate high-level radioactive waste at Yucca Mountain. One subsystem that may contribute to achieving this objective is the sealing subsystem. This subsystem is comprised of sealing components in the shafts, ramps, underground network of drifts, and the exploratory boreholes. Sealing components can be rigid, {{as in the case}} of a shaft seal, or can be more compressible, {{as in the case of}} drift fill comprised of mined rockfill. This paper presents the preliminary seismic response of discrete sealing components in welded and nonwelded tuff. Special consideration is given to evaluating the stress in the seal, and the behavior of the interface between the seal and the rock. The seismic responses are computed using both static and dynamic analyses. Also presented is an evaluation of the maximum seismic response encountered by a drift seal with respect to the angle of incidence of the seismic wave.

In the paper, corrosion testing was carried out to AFLAS rubber using HTHP autoclave in the harsh environment with the pressure 60 MPa, temperature 175 °C, test period 7 days and the compositions of the gas phase are 20 vol% H 2 S, 5 vol% CO 2, 75 vol% CH 4. Comparing and analyzing the changes of properties in gas and liquid phase before and after testing, such as quality, volume, tensile properties, hardness, permanent deformation, etc. The experimental results show that AFLAS rubber in gas and liquid phase has no dissolution phenomenon; moreover, tensile properties were weakened, hardness decreased and permanent deformation increased. While bubbling of AFLAS rubber in gas phase was more serious than in liquid phase, the swelling was on the contrary. Although AFLAS rubber is a good kind of anti-acid medium rubber, its mechanical properties is weakened in harsh environment. Therefore, {{in order to improve}} the effective seal life of packers in corroded environment, the corrosion influence on packer rubber should be considered when it is designed and used in high sour gas fields...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} {{we present a}} new concept {{developed}} to improve the abandonment procedure of wellbores in depleted hydrocarbon fields, amongst others in Enhanced Gas Recovery (EGR) operations. The sealing concept is designed for the long-term containment of CO 2 and considers the creep ability of deep Permian Zechstein salt formations in about 3, 000  m depth. It is designed to amend the current standard abandonment procedure and consists of (a) an expansive gel filling in the reservoir formation, (b) a sealing element with cement extending to the impermeable caprock and (c) a salt plug as the major long-term <b>sealing</b> <b>component,</b> compatible in its composition and property to the surrounding caprock (halite). The focus of the project work described here is to develop and to model the last-mentioned long-term salt sealing element.

A field test is conducted in the North German Altmark Rotliegend gas field (Sachsen Anhalt) in order to study the technical feasibility for recovering the initial caprock integrity, to verify numerical models and to proof the sealing capability and therefore the sealing concept...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present a {{numerical}} method to predict the work performance of hydraulic seals used in downhole equipments. The impact of key factors, namely, compression rate and the number of seals, on the wearing behavior of <b>seal</b> <b>components</b> is studied. To simulate the wear process of sealing contact surface, a methodology is built with the iterative wear prediction procedure in which the geometry of the contact interfaceprogressively changes according to the wear model. In this method, the structural and the thermal coupled mechanism is investigated and the performance of seal structure containing different number of seals is discussed. By taking a gear pump used in the downhole robots as a case study, both numerical analysis with proposed method and practical experiment are presented. The simulation results of the worn volume of the seals are consistent with the experiment data.

40|$|Aseptic-Ultra-High-Temperature (UHT) {{products}} are manufactured {{to be free}} of microorganisms capable of growing in the food at normal non-refrigerated conditions at which the food is likely to be held during manufacture, distribution and storage. Two important phases within the process are widely recognised as critical in controlling microbial contamination: the sterilisation steps and the following aseptic steps. Of the microbial hazards, the pathogen spore formers Clostridium botulinum and Bacillus cereus are deemed the most pertinent to be controlled. In addition, due to a relatively high thermal resistance, Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores are considered a concern for spoilage of low acid aseptic-UHT products. A probabilistic exposure assessment model has been developed in order to assess the aseptic-UHT product failure rate associated with these three bacteria. It was a Modular Process Risk Model, based on nine modules. They described: i) the microbial contamination introduced by the raw materials, either from the product (i. e. milk, cocoa and dextrose powders and water) or the packaging (i. e. bottle and <b>sealing</b> <b>component),</b> ii) the sterilisation processes, of either the product or the packaging material, iii) the possible recontamination during subsequent processing of both product and packaging. The Sterility Failure Rate (SFR) was defined as the sum of bottles contaminated for each batch, divided {{by the total number of}} bottles produced per process line run (10 (6) batches simulated per process line). The SFR associated with the three bacteria was estimated at the last step of the process (i. e. after Module 9) but also after each module, allowing for the identification of modules, and responsible contamination pathways, with higher or lower intermediate SFR. The model contained 42 controlled settings associated with factory environment, process line or product formulation, and more than 55 probabilistic inputs corresponding to inputs with variability conditional to a mean uncertainty. It was developed in @Risk and run through Monte Carlo simulations. Overall, the highest SFR was associated with G. stearothermophilus (380000 bottles contaminated in 10 (11) bottles produced) and the lowest to C. botulinum (3 bottles contaminated in 10 (11) bottles produced). Unsurprisingly, SFR due to G. stearothermophilus was due to its ability to survive the UHT treatment. More interestingly, it was identified that SFR due to B. cereus (17000 bottles contaminated in 10 (11) bottles produced) was due to an airborne recontamination of the aseptic tank (49 %) and a post-sterilisation packaging contamination (33 %). A deeper analysis (sensitivity and scenario analyses) was done to investigate how the SFR due to B. cereus could be reduced by changing the process settings related to potential air recontamination source...|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} study, a quantitative microbial exposure assessment (QMEA) model applied to an aseptic-UHT food process was developed [Pujol, L., Albert, I., Magras, C., Johnson, N. B., Membré, J. M. Probabilistic exposure assessment model to estimate aseptic UHT product failure rate. 2015 International Journal of Food Microbiology. 192, 124 – 141]. It quantified Sterility Failure Rate (SFR) associated with Bacillus cereus and Geobacillus stearothermophilus per process module (nine modules in total from raw material reception to end-product storage). Previously, the probabilistic model inputs were set by experts (using knowledge and in-house data). However, only the variability dimension {{was taken into}} account. The model was then improved using expert elicitation knowledge in two ways. First, the model was refined by adding the uncertainty dimension to the probabilistic inputs, enabling to set a second order Monte Carlo analysis. The eight following inputs, {{and their impact on}} SFR, are presented in detail in this present study: D-value for each bacteria of interest (B. cereus and G. stearothermophilus) associated with the inactivation model for the UHT treatment step, i. e., two inputs; log reduction (decimal reduction) number associated with the inactivation model for the packaging sterilization step for each bacterium and each part of the packaging (product container and <b>sealing</b> <b>component),</b> i. e., four inputs; and bacterial spore air load of the aseptic tank and the filler cabinet rooms, i. e., two inputs. Second, the model was improved by leveraging expert knowledge to develop further the existing model. The proportion of bacteria in the product which settled on surface of pipes (between the UHT treatment and the aseptic tank on one hand, and between the aseptic tank and the filler cabinet on the other hand) leading to a possible biofilm formation for each bacterium, was better characterized. It was modeled {{as a function of the}} hygienic design level of the aseptic-UHT line: the experts provided the model structure and most of the model parameters values. Mean of SFR was estimated to 10 × 10 − 8 (95 % Confidence Interval = [0 × 10 − 8; 350 × 10 − 8]) and 570 × 10 − 8 (95 % CI = [380 × 10 − 8; 820 × 10 − 8]) for B. cereus and G. stearothermophilus, respectively. These estimations were more accurate (since the confidence interval was provided) than those given by the model with only variability (for which the estimates were 15 × 10 − 8 and 580 × 10 − 8 for B. cereus and G. stearothermophilus, respectively). The updated model outputs were also compared with those obtained when inputs were described by a generic distribution, without specific information related to the case-study. Results showed that using a generic distribution can lead to unrealistic estimations (e. g., 3, 181, 000 product units contaminated by G. stearothermophilus among 108 product units produced) and emphasized the added value of eliciting information from experts from the relevant specialist field knowledge...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Backup bearing {{is a key}} safety {{component}} of the rotating machinery with the active magnetic bearings (AMBs). Owing to many unexpected reasons, the AMB rotor running at the full speed may drop onto the backup bearings. Sometimes, the full clearance whirling motion is induced, which is harmful to the machine. Therefore, it is quite important to know the tran-sient behaviour of the AMB rotor and the backup bearing. Till date, a lot of works have been per-formed on the AMB rotor drop and various mathematical models were established. However, most of them took into account only {{the interaction between the}} rotor journal and the backup bearing but neglected the interaction between the shaft and the stator component. As we know, for a real AMB machinery, there should be <b>seal</b> <b>components,</b> and the clearance of the <b>seal</b> <b>component</b> is very small to avoid the leakage. If an AMB failure occurs, the interaction between the shaft and the <b>seal</b> <b>component</b> is likely to happen. Thus, it is more reasonable to include this factor into the AMB rotor drop model. The problem is addressed in this work. The previous model is extended to include the shaft–stator contact. The numerical analysis based on two sets of AMB rotor data shows that the dynamic behaviour of the AMB changes greatly, if the shaft–stator contact is considered. There is no longer an optimum support damp-ing to prevent the harmful full clearance whirling motion, and at this time, a well-balanced AMB rotor is preferred...|$|R

Design/methodology/approach: Analytical approach {{has been applied to}} get an understanding of a heat exchange process. The mathematical model has been formulated and validated based on the available measurements. Numerical simulation has been carried out to illustrate a heat exchange process performance. Findings: It is possible to control a seal temperature and mechanical friction related to the rod movement into the seal at the specified velocity. The model accuracy is sufficient to perform sensitivity analysis and optimize the design. Research limitations/implications: The components of a fatigue tester have to withstand the significant temperature differences in the range  30; + 140 ˚C, e. g. hydraulic hoses, fittings, and pumps. Practical implications: We combine the analytical and experimental approach to provide customized and reliable engineering solution in the area of damper <b>component</b> <b>seal</b> development. A typical seal has a lip-like design protecting the moving parts against the leakage. It can be tested in a shock absorber or externally with use of a customized test rigs. Seal tests inside a shock absorber have numerous disadvantages. A shock absorber temperature rises during longer tests and cooling phase is required. This dramatically increases tests duration performed with the use of an expensive general-purpose hydraulic testing machinery. A compressed air or water jacket is used to accelerate the cooling process. Nevertheless, there are limitations related to the physics behind the cooling process. A <b>seal</b> <b>component</b> fatigue tester allows to perform the <b>seal</b> <b>component</b> tests out of the shock absorber.

40|$|Reconsolidation {{of crushed}} rock salt is a {{phenomenon}} {{of great interest to}} programs studying isolation of hazardous materials in natural salt geologic settings. Of particular interest is the potential for disaggregated salt to be restored to nearly an impermeable state. For example, reconsolidated crushed salt is proposed as a major shaft <b>seal</b> <b>component</b> for the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) Project. The concept for a permanent shaft <b>seal</b> <b>component</b> of the WIPP repository is to densely compact crushed salt in the four shafts; an effective seal will then be developed as the surrounding salt creeps into the shafts, further consolidating the crushed salt. Fundamental information on placement density and permeability is required to ensure attainment of the design function. The work reported here is the first large-scale compaction demonstration to provide information on initial salt properties applicable to design, construction, and performance expectations. The shaft seals must function for 10, 000 years. Over this period a crushed salt mass will become less permeable as it is compressed by creep closure of salt surrounding the shaft. These facts preclude the possibility of conducting a full-scale, real-time field test. Because permanent seals taking advantage of salt reconsolidation have never been constructed, performance measurements have not been made on an appropriately large scale. An understanding of potential construction methods, achievable initial density and permeability, and performance of reconsolidated salt over time is required for seal design and performance assessment.

40|$|The Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project, {{managed by}} the Civilian Radioactive Waste Management System (CRWMS) Management and Operating Contractor (M and O) is {{conducting}} investigations to support the Viability Assessment and the License Application for a high-level nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. The sealing subsystem {{is part of the}} Yucca Mountain Waste Isolation System. The Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project is currently evaluating the role of the sealing subsystem (shaft, ramp and exploratory borehole seals) in achieving the overall performance objectives for the Waste Isolation System. This report documents the results of those evaluations. The objective of the study is to provide water or air flow performance based requirements for shafts, ramps, and exploratory boreholes located near the repository. Recommendations, as appropriate, are provided for developing plans, <b>seals</b> <b>component</b> testing, and other studies relating to sealing...|$|R
