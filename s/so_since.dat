In addition, Joyce moved south of west for a time at a location where it is rare for tropical cyclones to do so.|$|E
5|$|Tyrone had contested {{the final}} in 1986 and 1995 but lost on both occasions, against Kerry and Dublin respectively. Armagh were the {{defending}} champions, having won their first title the year previously. They {{had lost the}} final in 1953 and 1977.

5|$|Vince {{developed}} from an extratropical system on 8 October, becoming a subtropical storm {{southeast of the}} Azores. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) did not officially name the storm until the next day, shortly before Vince became a hurricane. The storm weakened at sea and made landfall on the Iberian Peninsula as a tropical depression on 11 October. Vince was the first tropical system to do <b>so</b> <b>since</b> the 1842 Spanish hurricane. It dissipated over Spain, bringing much needed rain to the region, and its remnants passed into the Mediterranean Sea.|$|E

5|$|Alloxylon flammeum and {{the other}} three tree waratah species lie in the {{subtribe}} Embothriinae, along with the true waratahs (Telopea), South American Oreocallis, and Chilean firetree (Embothrium coccineum) from South America. Almost all these species have red terminal flowers, and hence the subtribe's origin and floral appearance most likely predate the splitting of Gondwana into Australia, Antarctica, and South America over 60 million years ago. The position, colour and tubular shape of the flowers suggest they are bird-pollinated, and have been <b>so</b> <b>since</b> the Eocene radiation of nectar-feeding birds such as honeyeaters. Cladistic analysis of morphological features within the Embothriinae showed A.flammeum and A.brachycarpum to be sister species, with A.wickhamii as their next closest relative. A.flammeum has yellow pollen grains, like A.brachycarpum and A.wickhamii but unlike all other members of the Embothriinae.|$|E
5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the season, the Alabama defense led the nation in every major statistical category, and was the first to do <b>so</b> <b>since</b> the 1986 season. Additionally, several players were recognized for the individual accomplishments on the field. Barrett Jones won both the Wuerffel Trophy and the Outland Trophy; and Trent Richardson won the Doak Walker Award, was a finalist for the Heisman Trophy and was named the SEC Offensive Player of the Year. Also, seven players were named to various All-America Teams with Dont'a Hightower being a consensus selection and Mark Barron, Jones and Richardson each being unanimous selections. In April 2012, eight members of the 2011 squad were selected in the NFL Draft, with an additional six signed as undrafted free agents to various teams.|$|E
5|$|Before World WarII, all {{homes were}} {{required}} to display Hinomaru on national holidays. Since the war, the display of the flag of Japan is mostly limited to buildings attached to national and local governments such as city halls; it is rarely seen at private homes or commercial buildings, but some people and companies have advocated displaying the flag on holidays. Although the government of Japan encourages citizens and residents to fly the Hinomaru during national holidays, they are not legally required to do <b>so.</b> <b>Since</b> the Emperor's 80th Birthday on December 23, 2002, the Kyushu Railway Company has displayed the Hinomaru at 330 stations.|$|E

5|$|Besides the budget, another {{measure that}} failed to pass in the 2002 session was a bill to {{eliminate}} {{the death penalty for}} juveniles. The precedent for the juvenile death penalty had been set in the 1989 Supreme Court case of Stanford v. Kentucky, wherein the court ruled that Kevin Stanford could be executed for the 1981 rape, sodomy, and murder of a gas station attendant in Jefferson County, Kentucky, even though Stanford was only 17 {{at the time of the}} crime. In 2003, Patton announced he would commute Stanford's sentence. Patton did oversee the execution of two adult prisoners in 1997 and 1999, making him the first Kentucky governor to do <b>so</b> <b>since</b> 1962.|$|E
5|$|Clark's {{successor}} as MP, Stewart Jackson, was re-elected in 2010 with {{an increased}} majority, which then fell in 2015.

Furthermore, Peterborough became one of five constituencies, the others being Croydon Central, Enfield Southgate, Leeds North West and Reading East, which elected Labour MPs in 2017 having not done <b>so</b> <b>since</b> 2001.|$|E
5|$|Dix was {{a highly}} {{successful}} amateur athlete, setting a state record in the 100m and trying out for the US Olympic Team {{at the age of}} eighteen. He joined Florida State University and in his first year he broke the 100m American junior record and won at the NCAA Outdoor Championships. After a fourth-place finish at the 2005 US Championships, Dix continued with his collegiate success, setting an NCAA record of 19.69 seconds in the 200m and coming within one hundredth of the 100m record. He completed a 100m, 200m, and 4×100 meter relay sweep at the 2007 NCAA Outdoor Championships, the first to do <b>so</b> <b>since</b> John Carlos in 1969. He closed his amateur career in 2008: another NCAA 200m title made him the third most decorated track athlete in NCAA history, and he won gold and silver at the 2008 US Olympic Trials.|$|E

5|$|Dredd earned $27.6 {{million from}} markets outside of North America and $13.4 million from North America, {{for a total}} of $41 million. In the UK, Dredd grossed £1.05 million ($1.7 million) from 415 cinemas during its opening weekend. This made it the weekend's number-one film, the first film {{restricted}} to audiences over 18 years of age to do <b>so</b> <b>since</b> Saw 3D in 2010. In its second weekend, the film placed number five, earning £769,381. Dredd was primarily shown in 3D in the UK, and 2D screenings were notoriously limited as the distributor denied cinemas' requests for 2D prints; the decision was considered to have limited the film's audience where 2D was their preferred format. Dredd earned a total of $6.9 million in the UK.|$|E
5|$|For the game's localization, {{the main}} focus {{was to keep the}} {{dialogue}} natural and accessible to Western players, while also staying true to the Japanese version. The Japanese version had several instances of puns or cultural jokes, which would not have worked if they had been translated literally. There were also places in the script where the development team would have liked to insert jokes in the localization, but thought that it may be inappropriate to do <b>so</b> <b>since</b> the joke was not in the Japanese version. The team found difficulties in getting the Western version's tone right, as they wanted to keep the localized text interesting, {{and at the same time}} avoid inconsistencies with the original version's tone.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, P. Mausfeld and D. Vrcibradic {{published}} {{a note on}} the nomenclature of the Noronha skink informed by a re-examination of Gray's original type specimens; despite extensive attempts to correctly name the species, they were apparently the first to do <b>so</b> <b>since</b> Boulenger in 1887. Based on differences in the number of scales, subdigital lamellae (lamellae on the lower sides of the digits), and keels (longitudinal ridges) on the dorsal scales (located on the upperparts), as well as the separation of the parietal scales (on the head behind the eyes) in maculata, they concluded that the two were not, after all, identical, and that Schmidt's name Mabuya atlantica should therefore be used. Mausfeld and Vrcibradic considered Mabouya punctatissima to represent a different species on the basis of morphological differences, but were unable to resolve the status of Trachylepis (Xystrolepis) punctata.|$|E

5|$|Istanbul's {{strategic}} {{position on the}} historic Silk Road, rail networks to Europe and the Middle East, and the only sea route between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean have produced a cosmopolitan populace, although less <b>so</b> <b>since</b> {{the establishment of the}} Turkish Republic in 1923. Overlooked for the new capital Ankara during the interwar period, the city has since regained much of its prominence. The population of the city has increased tenfold since the 1950s, as migrants from across Anatolia have moved in and city limits have expanded to accommodate them. Arts, music, film, and cultural festivals were established {{at the end of the}} 20th century and continue to be hosted by the city today. Infrastructure improvements have produced a complex transportation network.|$|E
5|$|Kemp {{wound up}} hitting 39 {{home runs in}} 2011 with 126 RBIs, leading the league in both categories, the first Dodger to do <b>so</b> <b>since</b> Dolph Camilli in the 1941 season.

He {{finished}} second in slugging percentage (.586), OPS (.986), extra base hits (76), and stolen bases (40, tied), and third in batting average (.324) and outfield assists (11). Kemp also extended his games played streak to 364 games, as he played in every game of the season.
