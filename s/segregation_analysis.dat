One is the "separate-multinomials" formulation, which treats each family size as representing a separate multinomial distribution; the other is the "grand-multinomial" formulation, which treats the entire data set as representing one distribution. It is shown that these two formulations are equivalent, if and only if the population distribution of family sizes is completely unknown. However, if anything is known about the family-size distribution, the grand-multinomial formulation, although more cumbersome, makes more complete use of the data; moreover, it enables the use of one-child families in a <b>segregation</b> <b>analysis.</b> The relationship of this work to Ewens' equivalence theorem concerning "unconditional" and "conditional" likelihoods is discussed.

40|$|Commingling {{analysis}} {{is commonly used}} to provide preliminary evidence for a single genetic locus with a major effect on the quantitative trait of interest. In this paper, the effectiveness of commingling analysis as a screening technique to identify samples for <b>segregation</b> <b>analysis</b> is assessed by applying both commingling and segregation analyses to samples of simulated pedigree data in which a major locus is segregating {{in the presence of}} polygenes and an individual-specific environmental effect. Under the circumstances simulated here, there is evidence for a single locus from <b>segregation</b> <b>analysis</b> but not from commingling analysis in at least 20 % of the samples. No more than 2 % of the samples provided evidence for commingling but not for segregation of a single locus. Comparisons of the samples that give evidence for both commingling and segregation, evidence for one but not the other, and no evidence for either show that evidence for commingling depends on the distributional characteristics of the trait in the sample, while support for the single locus from <b>segregation</b> <b>analysis</b> depends on both the distributional characteristics as well as the transmission of the rarer allele from parents to offspring. Since lack of commingling does not rule out the existence of a single locus in the realistic situations considered here, commingling analysis has limited usefulness as a screening technique for the presence for a single locus. In contrast, evidence for commingling does suggest the possibility that a single locus has a major effect on the trait and commingling analysis can provide guidance in the choice of initial parameter estimates for <b>segregation</b> <b>analysis...</b>|$|E

This trait is influenced by quantitative trait loci (QTL) sought out in different pig populations.

The detection was performed in an experimental F 2 Duroc × Large White population first by <b>segregation</b> <b>analysis,</b> then by QTL mapping using additional molecular information. Results <b>Segregation</b> <b>analysis</b> provided evidence for a major gene, with a recessive Duroc allele increasing IMF by 1. 8 % in Duroc homozygous pigs. However, results depended on whether data were normalised or not. After Box-Cox transformation, likelihood ratio was indeed 12 times lower and no longer significant. The QTL detection results were partly consistent with the <b>segregation</b> <b>analysis.</b> Three QTL significant at the chromosome wide level were evidenced. Two QTL, located on chromosomes 13 and 15, showed a high IMF Duroc recessive allele with an overall effect slightly lower than that expected from <b>segregation</b> <b>analysis</b> (+ 0. 4 g/ 100 g muscle). The third QTL was located on chromosome 1, with a dominant Large White allele inducing high IMF content (+ 0. 5 g/ 100 g muscle). Additional QTL were detected for muscular fatty acid composition. Conclusion The study presented results from two complementary approaches, a <b>segregation</b> <b>analysis</b> and a QTL detection, to seek out genes involved in the higher IMF content observed in the Duroc population. Discrepancies between both methods might be partially explained by the existence of at least two QTL with similar characteristics located on two different chromosomes for which different boars were heterozygous.

Obviously, in both populations, the favourable alleles inducing high IMF content were not fixed and improving IMF by fixing favourable alleles using markers can then be applied both in Duroc and LW populations.

40|$|Abstract Background Repeated {{blocks of}} genome {{sequence}} {{have been shown}} to be associated with genetic diversity and disease risk in humans, and with phenotypic diversity in model organisms and domestic animals. Reliable tests are desirable to determine whether individuals are carriers of copy number variants associated with disease risk in humans and livestock, or associated with economically important traits in livestock. In some cases, copy number variants affect the phenotype through a dosage effect but in other cases, allele combinations have non-additive effects. In the latter cases, it has been difficult to develop tests because assays typically return an estimate of the sum of the copy number counts on the maternally and paternally inherited chromosome segments, and this sum does not uniquely determine the allele configuration. In this study, we show that there is an old solution to this new problem: <b>segregation</b> <b>analysis,</b> which has been used for many years to infer alleles in pedigreed populations. Methods <b>Segregation</b> <b>analysis</b> was used to estimate copy number alleles from assay data on simulated half-sib sheep populations. Copy number variation at the Agouti locus, known to be responsible for the recessive self-colour black phenotype, was used as a model for the simulation and an appropriate penetrance function was derived. The precision with which carriers and non-carriers of the undesirable single copy allele could be identified, was used to evaluate the method for various family sizes, assay strategies and assay accuracies. Results Using relationship data and <b>segregation</b> <b>analysis,</b> the probabilities of carrying the copy number alleles responsible for black or white fleece were estimated with much greater precision than by analyzing assay results for animals individually. The proportion of lambs correctly identified as non-carriers of the undesirable allele increased from 7 % when the lambs were analysed alone to 80 % when the lambs were analysed in half-sib families. Conclusions When a quantitative assay is used to estimate copy number alleles, <b>segregation</b> <b>analysis</b> of related individuals can greatly improve the precision of the estimates. Existing software for <b>segregation</b> <b>analysis</b> would require little if any change to accommodate the penetrance function for copy number assay data. </p...|$|E

We {{present the results}} of a <b>segregation</b> <b>analysis</b> performed with the algorithm Pointer on familial data on 978 Scandinavian patients with {{testicular cancer}}. The <b>segregation</b> <b>analysis</b> favoured the involvement of major gene effects over models incorporating solely polygenic effects in testicular cancer aetiology. Overall, a recessive model best fits the family observations with an estimated gene frequency of 3. 8 % and a lifetime risk for homozygous men of developing the disease of 43 %. This implies that 7. 6 % of men in the general population will be carriers of the mutant allele and that 0. 1 % would be homozygote and are, therefore, at high risk of developing the cancer. The testicular cancer incidence has changed greatly during the last generation. Also, the lethality of the disease has changed because of the introduction of new therapy.
