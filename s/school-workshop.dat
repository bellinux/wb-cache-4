25|$|One {{best known}} Lake Patzcuaro artisan {{community}} is Santa Clara del Cobre, where 82% {{of the population}} is employed in the making of hand hammered copper items. There are 250 registered workshops in and around the town, which process about 450 tons of copper each year, generating an income of about fifty million pesos. Many of the copper items made are of a utilitarian nature – cooking utensils, various types of containers, pots, pans, plates, shot glasses, clocks, jewelry, vases, beds, tables, chairs, light switches, counters, sinks, even bathtubs, and much, much more, all in copper. However, since the 1970s copper jewelry, and many other non-essential items has also been made here. The workshops here are family-owned with children learning the trade from their parents. There is also a cooperative <b>school-workshop</b> to teach copper smithing, named Vasco de Quiroga.|$|E

The most traditional is kitchenware such as pots and plates, which are decorated in small painted dots in a style known here as puntillaje, often to form flowers. This technique dates back to the clay pots from the pre Hispanic era. Since the 1980s, it has also been known for the making of ceramic images of La Catrina, a figure initially created by graphic artist Jose Guadalupe Posada. This began in the workshop of Juan Torres, who took the skeletal figure and made his own variations on the theme. Since then, most artisans in the town have turned to the making of these figures, some in more modern dress and even male versions called Catrinos. Capula attracts some tourists who come to see the demonstrations of how the wares are made. This small town is {{the only one in the}} state that boasts government certifications of origin for three of its products, punteada pottery, the Catrinas and a simpler pottery called loza tradicional.|$|E

We present and interpret the experimental data on the gigantic dielectric response in the vicinity of TCO, concentrating on the frequency dependence of the inverse 1 /ϵ of the complex permittivity ϵ=ϵ^'+iϵ^". Surprisingly for a ferroelectric, we could closely approach the 2 nd order phase transition and to deeply reach the critical dynamics of the polarization. We could analyse the critical slowing-down when approaching Tc from both sides and to extract the anomalous power law for the frequency dependence of the order parameter viscosity. Moreover, below Tc we could extract a sharp absorption feature coming from a motion of domain walls which shows up at a frequency well below the relaxation rate...|$|E

Njegovo postojanje potvrđuju i najnovija otkrića figuralnih podnih mozaika u Starom Gradu na Hvaru, u južnoj bazilici ranokršćanskog episkopalnog kompleksa, na današnjem lokalitetu Sv. Ivana. Cantharos {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{frequent}} motifs that appear on Early Christian mosaics made in Salonitan workshops. Several very fine representations of cantharos have been preserved in the mosaic floor of the southern main congregational church in the Episcopal complex in Stari Grad on the Island of Hvar. A medallion with doves drinking water from a cantharos and a mosaic with peacocks near another cantharos were discovered. To the north and south of the peacocks a smaller mosaic carpets were found. Each has the same cantharos from which ivy tendrils spring. So far three figural compositions are known on the Croatian coast. First is a famous,but unfortunately missing representation of a deer from the consignatorium of the Episcopal centre in Salona. Then, deers on a mosaic in the Zadar Cathedral, and only a fragment of a destroyed composition from Salona with the head of a deer licking dew from the treeof life. Frist type has a funnel-like neck and characteristic fluted belly with three or more flutes topped by a wide funnel-like neck with a large mouth. From the mouth start S shaped handles and rest on the ribs of the vase. The knob connects the belly with a triangular or more rarely rectangular foot. To this type belong two cantharoi from the consignatorium of the episcopal centre in Salona and that found in the complex of the Zadar Cathedral. The cantharos with peacocks from Stari Grad and that from the basilica at Kapljuč in Salona, are creative variations of this same type. The cantharos with doves from the mosaic medalion and those to the north and southof the peacock motif, from Stari Grad, belong to the second type. This type has a narrow neck, disproportionately narrower than the mouth and handles which spring from the belly to be perfectly fused with the mouth. There are often variants of this type as well. All mentioned cantharoi, regardless of the type were produced by craftsmen from thesame <b>school-workshop</b> whose centre was in Salona. Its impact spread wherever Salona 2 ̆ 7 s influence as the main Early Christian centre was felt...|$|E
