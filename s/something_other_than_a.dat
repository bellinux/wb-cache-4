5|$|Developmental stages began for {{the film}} midway through the series' first season {{production}} in January 1998. Co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone signed a deal with Comedy Central in April 1998 that contracted the duo to producing South Park episodes until 1999, gave them {{a slice of the}} lucrative spinoff merchandising the show generated within its first year, as well as an unspecified seven-figure cash bonus to bring the show to the big screen, in theaters. A large part of Parker and Stone's conditions attached to any potential movie project was that it must at least be R-rated, {{to keep in touch with}} the series' humor and its roots, the short The Spirit of Christmas. Parker stated that their desire was to approach the film from a much more creative perspective and do <b>something</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> simple movie-length version of a regular episode. Despite alleged pressure from Paramount Pictures officials to keep the movie toned down, the two won the battle for a more mature rating.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, Universal chief Carl Laemmle, Jr. offered Whale {{his choice}} of any {{property}} the studio owned. He chose Frankenstein, mostly because none of Universal's other properties particularly interested him {{and he wanted to}} make <b>something</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> war picture. While the novel itself was in the public domain, Universal owned the filming rights to a stage adaptation by Peggy Webling. Whale cast Colin Clive as Henry Frankenstein and Mae Clarke as his fiancée Elizabeth. For the Monster, he turned to an unknown actor named Boris Karloff. Shooting began on 24 August 1931 and wrapped on 3 October. Previews were held 29 October, with wide release on 21 November. Frankenstein was an instant hit with critics and the public. The film received glowing reviews and shattered box office records across the United States, earning Universal $12 million on first release.|$|E
25|$|If a {{rotation}} around a point or axis {{is followed by}} a second rotation around the same point/axis, a third rotation results. The reverse (inverse) of {{a rotation}} is also a rotation. Thus, the rotations around a point/axis form a group. However, a rotation around a point or axis and a rotation around a different point/axis may result in <b>something</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> rotation, e.g. a translation.|$|E

25|$|One way is {{by using}} <b>something</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> {{rectangular}} (cubic, etc.) grid. For example, if a plane is tiled with regular hexagons, those hexagons {{could be used}} as cells. In many cases the resulting cellular automata are equivalent to those with rectangular grids with specially designed neighborhoods and rules. Another variation would be to make the grid itself irregular, such as with Penrose tiles.|$|E
25|$|Hanging from Orion's belt is his sword, {{consisting}} of the multiple stars θ1 and θ2 Orionis, called the Trapezium and the Orion Nebula (M42). This is a spectacular object that can be clearly identified {{with the naked eye}} as <b>something</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> star. Using binoculars, its clouds of nascent stars, luminous gas, and dust can be observed. The Trapezium cluster has many newborn stars, including several brown dwarfs, all of which are at an approximate distance of 1,500 light-years. Named for the four bright stars that form a trapezoid, it is largely illuminated by the brightest stars, which are only a few hundred thousand years old. Observations by the Chandra X-ray Observatory show both the extreme temperatures of the main stars—up to 60,000 kelvins—and the star forming regions still extant in the surrounding nebula.|$|E
25|$|Racing {{versions}} of the first-generation RX-7 were entered at the prestigious 24 hours of Le Mans endurance race. The first outing for the car, equipped with a 13B engine, failed by less than one second to qualify in 1979. The next year, a 12A-equipped RX-7 not only qualified, it placed 21st overall. That same car did not finish in 1981, along with two more 13B cars. Those two cars were back for 1982, with one 14th-place finish and another DNF. The RX-7 Le Mans effort {{was replaced by the}} 717C prototype for 1983. In 1991, Mazda made racing history becoming the first Japanese automobile manufacturer to win the 24 hours of Le Mans. The car was a 4-rotor prototype, the 787B. To this day, Mazda is the only Japanese manufacturer to have won the prestigious 24-hour Le Mans race outright. Mazda is also the only manufacturer to win the 24 hours of Le Mans race using <b>something</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> reciprocating piston engine.|$|E

500|$|NASA has {{announced}} that it will use the new guidelines established by the IAU. Alan Stern, the director of NASA's mission to Pluto, rejects the current IAU definition of planet, both in terms of defining dwarf planets as <b>something</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> type of planet, and in using orbital characteristics (rather than intrinsic characteristics) of objects to define them as dwarf planets. Thus, in 2011, he still referred to Pluto as a planet, and accepted other dwarf planets such as Ceres and Eris, as well as the larger moons, as additional planets. Several years before the IAU definition, he used orbital characteristics to separate [...] "überplanets" [...] (the dominant eight) from [...] "unterplanets" [...] (the dwarf planets), considering both types [...] "planets".|$|E
500|$|In his {{discussion}} of the film's relation to modernism, Thomas Schatz finds the film an unresolved [...] "examination of the process of human interaction and interpersonal communication" [...] and [...] "immediately establishes [...] self-referential stance" [...] that invites the spectator [...] "to read the narrative as <b>something</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> sequential development toward some transcendent truth". For him, Alvy [...] "is the victim of a tendency toward overdetermination of meaning -- or in modernist terms 'the tyranny of the signified' -- and his involvement with Annie can be viewed as an attempt to establish a spontaneous, intellectually unencumbered relationship, an attempt which is doomed to failure." [...] Marcus Geduld cites the flashback to Alvy as a child (in a therapist's office with his mother) as an example of basic problems (poverty, discordant parents) being masked by a supposed existential crisis.|$|E
500|$|As of the 2011 census, Northern England had a {{population}} of 14,933,000 – a growth of 5.1% since 2001 – in 6,364,000 households, meaning that Northerners comprise 28% of the English population and 24% of the UK population. Taken overall, 8% {{of the population of}} Northern England were born overseas (3% from the European Union including Ireland and 5% from elsewhere), substantially less than the England and Wales average of 13%, and 5% define their nationality as <b>something</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> UK or Irish identity. [...] 90.5% of the population described themselves as white, compared to an England and Wales average of 85.9%; other ethnicities represented include Pakistani (2.9%), Indian (1.3%), Black (1.3%), Chinese (0.6%) and Bangladeshi (0.5%). The broad averages hide significant variation within the region: Allerdale and Redcar and Cleveland had a greater percentage of the population identifying as White British (97.6% each) than any other district in England and Wales, while Manchester (66.5%), Bradford (67.4%) and Blackburn with Darwen (69.1%) had among the lowest proportions of White British outside London.|$|E
30|$|The {{transition}} metal liquid model recognizes additional repulsive forces {{that change the}} reference model to <b>something</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> ideal gas. The particles have longer-ranged repulsive interactions that are essentially electrostatic. These act to increase wavespeeds relative to other models at a given Z (Equations (7), (9), and (10)). Hence this model leads to higher liquid mean atomic weights to counterbalance the additional force contributions and to match the wavespeeds in the core.|$|R
5000|$|In America, the New-York Times {{wrote that}} One Arabian Night (the title under which Sumurun was released) gave added {{evidence}} that Ernst Lubitsch [...] "is the superior of most directors anywhere, and that Pola Negri, a Polish-German actress, {{is one of}} the few real players of the screen who can make a character live and be <b>something</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> actress playing a part."

5000|$|Critic Sean Latham has defended Sayers, {{arguing that}} Wilson [...] "chooses arrogant condescension over serious {{critical}} consideration", and suggesting that {{both he and}} Leavis, rather than seriously assessing Sayers's writing, simply objected to a detective story writer having pretensions beyond {{what they saw as}} her role of popular culture [...] "hack". [...] Latham claims that, in their eyes, [...] "Sayers's primary crime lay in her attempt to transform the detective novel into <b>something</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> ephemeral bit of popular culture".|$|R
500|$|In 1993, Vandernoot {{wanted to}} leave the show because {{shooting}} Highlander was too demanding and required her to spend several months each year in Canada. Vandernoot also wanted {{to spend more time}} with her family. According to Abramowitz, a further, artistic, reason was that [...] "...a small part of [...] being a really strong actress wanted to play a more aggressive part in the show and sadly, the nature of the beast was that it couldn't happen and she made a decision." [...] Panzer said that creating interesting female characters in the Highlander franchise was often a challenge because the producers found it difficult to [...] "...have the women be <b>something</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> victim, a hostage, other things when [...] dealing with an immortal hero." [...] Consequently, the creative staff needed to write Tessa out of the show but [...] were restricted because of the character's strong relationship with MacLeod. Associate Creative Consultant Gillian Horvath said that, [...] "There was no way... to have a scene where she said, 'Okay, I'm going to go to Paris without you. Nice knowing you, MacLeod.'" [...] The writers decided that the only solution was for Tessa to die, despite Abramowitz's feeling that her death was [...] "...sad" [...] and [...] "...heartbreaking".|$|E
500|$|An Unforgettable Summer was {{the first}} major {{production}} to star Scott Thomas, and the last film to star George Constantin (who died soon after). It also featured the critically acclaimed presence of comedian Ioan Gyuri Pascu. Tronaru praises both Bleonţ and Scott Thomas for their performance, while Berardinelli objects to their seeming aloofness, arguing that a connection between the audience and the actors in the main roles could prove [...] "tenuous". In contrast with the latter commentator, Variety notes: [...] "The actress gives a properly flighty dimension to the loving wife and mom whose flair for putting a joyous spin on things is forever impaired by the looming atrocity she feels powerless to halt." [...] Caryn James writes: [...] "An Unforgettable Summer would have been more trenchant if Petre's character had been more fully developed. But Marie-Therese is, deliberately, the apolitical soul of the film, shifting the focus from politics to the humanity that transcends border disputes and ethnic loyalties. Ms. Scott-Thomas makes the film work because she shows Marie-Therese to be <b>something</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> shallow woman playing Lady Bountiful. She is sincere, rather helpless and, finally, shaken with disillusionment. Neither pure heroine nor villain, by the end she is unable to escape the murderous impact of politics." [...] Variety also commends Răzvan Vasilescu for his performance in the role of Colonel Turtureanu, [...] "an opportunistic soldier who has no compunctions about anything the military life may require", and comments favorably on the soundtrack composed by Anton Şuteu and on Paul Bortnovschi's production design.|$|E

40|$|Faces of lesion {{nematodes}} Pratylenchus teres (populations RTB and JK) and P. zeae or the bacterivore Distolabrellus veechi {{were observed}} on frozen specimens with low-temperature {{scanning electron microscopy}} and as chemically fixed, critical-point dried specimens with conventional scanning electron microscopy. Amphidial secretions were preserved in chemically fixed but not cryofixed lesion nematodes. Overhanging liplets of chemically fixed D. veechi may be artifactual because they appeared as variably filled, mostly empty membranes when cryofixed. The diagnostically useful lips of the frozen lesion nematodes exhibited six sectors of variable prominence that were absent in chemically fixed specimens. This variability {{may be due to}} different degrees of muscle contraction captured during cryofixation, which occurs in milliseconds.

50|$|Agon: A {{conventional}} agon is {{a debate}} that decides or reflects {{the outcome of the}} play, comprising a 'symmetrical scene' with a pair of songs and a pair of declaimed or spoken passages, typically in long lines of anapests. There is no such agon in this play nor is there an antagonist to represent a pro-war viewpoint, apart from War, a monstrosity incapable of eloquence. However, Old Comedy is rich in symmetrical scenes and sometimes these can resemble an agon. There is a symmetrical scene in lines 346-425 (song-dialogue-song-dialogue) in which Trygaeus argues with Hermes and eventually wins his support. The dialogue however is in iambic trimeter, conventionally the rhythm of ordinary speech. Moreover, the song's metrical form is repeated much later in a second antistrophe (583-97), indicating that Aristophanes was aiming at <b>something</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> agon.|$|R

The promise of France brings the two together in love and excitement again, and Frank seemingly ends his relationship with Maureen. While April sees the emigration as an opportunity to escape their dull environment, Frank's plans are more driven by vanity of his own intelligence, which April panders to. When the dull and prim neighbor Mrs. Givings begins bringing her [...] "insane" [...] son John around to the Wheelers' house for regular lunches, John's honest and erratic condemnation of his mother's suburban lifestyle strikes a chord with the Wheelers, particularly Frank.|$|R
