Belon provided instructions on the removal of viscera and the use of salt {{to preserve}} bird specimens in his 1555 book on birds. These were further improved in the 17th century and a range of preservatives included ash (potassium carbonate), salt, sulphur, alum, alcohol and various plant extracts were used. In the early days of bird collections, most specimens were mounted in unrealistic positions often with their wings raised as if they were about to take flight. These were kept in the open and the colours were prone to fading and the specimens themselves prone to damage by beetles. In Berlin, J. L. Frisch started using tightly enclosed glass jars for every mount to prevent pest damage. During this time, Comte de Reaumur at the Paris Museum had managed to find techniques to preserve specimens dry and without loss of colour. This technique was however a secret and similar results were later achieved by pickling using <b>salt,</b> <b>ground</b> pepper and alum and drying for a month with threads holding the bird in a natural position. The use of arsenic to preserve specimens was first introduced by Jean-Baptiste Bécoeur (1718-1777) but this method was publicly revealed only in 1800 by Louis Dufresne in Daudin's Traité Élémentaire et Complet d’Ornithologie (1800). In modern collections, salvaged or collected birds may be preserved in a number of ways. The most traditional preparation is a study skin, in which almost all of the body inside the skin is removed and replaced with cotton so that the final result resembles a bird lying on its back with its wings folded. Borax is used as the preferred preservative as it is low in toxicity. This stereotypic posture was developed to enable many skins to be kept together in cabinets to protect them from insect and light damage. If a complete skeleton is desired, a flat skin may be prepared: all bones, muscle, digestive and other soft tissue is carefully removed and the feathers and skin are stretched flat and dried.|$|E

Mung bean sprouts, called sukju namul, are often served as a side dish, blanched and sautéed with sesame oil, garlic, and <b>salt.</b> <b>Ground</b> mung beans are {{used to make a}} porridge called nokdujuk, which is eaten as a nutritional supplement and digestive aid, especially for ill patients. A popular snack, bindaetteok (mung bean pancake) is made with ground mung beans and fresh mung bean sprouts. Starch extracted from ground mung beans is used to make transparent cellophane noodles (dangmyeon). The noodles are the main ingredients for japchae (a salad-like dish), and sundae (a blood sausage) or a subsidiary ingredient for soups and stews. The starch can be also used to make jelly-like foods, such as nokdumuk and hwangpomuk. The muk have a bland flavor, so are served seasoned with soy sauce, sesame oil and crumbled seaweeds or other seasonings such as tangpyeongchae.|$|E

50|$|Early Polynesian {{settlers}} {{brought along}} with them clothing, plants and livestock and established settlements along the coasts and larger valleys. Upon their arrival, the settlers grew kalo (taro), maia (banana), niu (coconut), and ulu (breadfruit). Meats were eaten less often than fruits, vegetables, and seafood. Some did import and raise pua'a (pork), moa (chicken), and ʻīlio (poi dog). Popular condiments included pa'akai (<b>salt),</b> <b>ground</b> kukui nut, limu (seaweed), and ko (sugarcane) which was used as both a sweet and a medicine. The non-native species may have caused various birds, plants and land snails to go extinct. Estuaries were adapted to fishing ponds (aquaculture). Irrigation work was also used to farm taro.|$|E

50|$|This {{version of}} ventricina {{is made from}} pork meat with added pork fat, the latter amounting to {{approximately}} 50-60% by weight of the finished product. The meat and fat are finely ground together and various spices are then added to the mixture. Most often these include garlic, <b>salt,</b> <b>ground</b> black and white pepper, hot and bell peppers, orange peel, rosemary, bell pepper paste, and fennel seeds. Other spices are sometimes added according to {{the taste of the}} producer. Traditionally, this mixture would be encased in the bladder, stomach, or intestines of the pig. More recently, synthetic casings have been employed or the mixture is simply stored in glass containers. Ventricina is often hung to cure in a cool dark place for several months before it is eaten. Ventricina teramana (that from the area around Teramo in Abruzzo) is most often eaten when it is young and has been allowed to age only a few months. Many people spread this delicacy on an open slice of bread. If desired the bread slices can be placed on the grill or in the oven for a period of time, thereby making a kind of bruschetta.|$|E
5000|$|Legumes {{have been}} {{significant}} crops in Korean history and cuisine according to earliest preserved legumes found in archaeological sites in Korea. The excavation at Okbang site, Jinju, South Gyeongsang province indicates soybeans were cultivated {{as a food}} crop circa 1000-900 BCE. They are made into tofu (dubu), while soybean sprouts are sauteed as a vegetable (kongnamul) and whole soybeans are seasoned {{and served as a}} side dish. They are also made into soy milk, which is used as the base for the noodle dish called kongguksu. A byproduct of soy milk production is okara (kongbiji), which is used to thicken stews and porridges. Soybeans may also be one of the beans in kongbap, which boil together with several types of beans and other grains, and they are also the primary ingredient in the production of fermented condiments collectively referred to as jang, such as soybean pastes, doenjang and cheonggukjang, a soy sauce called ganjang, chili pepper paste or gochujang and others.Mung beans are commonly used in Korean cuisine, where they are called nokdu (녹두, literally [...] "green bean").

In the early days of bird collections, most specimens were mounted in unrealistic positions often with their wings raised as if they were about to take flight. These were kept in the open and the colours were prone to fading and the specimens themselves prone to damage by beetles. In Berlin, J. L. Frisch started using tightly enclosed glass jars for every mount to prevent pest damage.

This technique was however a secret and similar results were later achieved by pickling using <b>salt,</b> <b>ground</b> pepper and alum and drying for a month with threads holding the bird in a natural position. In modern collections, salvaged or collected birds may be preserved in a number of ways. The most traditional preparation is a study skin, in which almost all of the body inside the skin is removed and replaced with cotton so that the final result resembles a bird lying on its back with its wings folded. This stereotypic posture was developed to enable many skins to be kept together in cabinets to protect them from insect and light damage. If a complete skeleton is desired, a flat skin may be prepared: all bones, muscle, digestive and other soft tissue is carefully removed and the feathers and skin are stretched flat and dried.A more recent preparation method pioneered by the Royal Ontario Museum removes all bones for a complete skeleton while also producing a round skin without bill or legs (called a ROM, though if one set of wing and leg bones remain with the skin the preparation is called a shmoo in North America). Alternatively, the entire bird (or any soft parts associated with preparations described above) may be preserved in alcohol. For any of these methods, several supplemental preparations may be made. For example, a wing may be removed and preserved separately as a spread wing for better study of flight feathers; a tissue sample may be removed and frozen for molecular analyses; or a recording of the bird's song before collection may be archived. Neither molecular samples nor sound recordings require a bird to be collected (killed). Finally, if the bird is too rotten for the skin and feathers to be preserved, {{as is the case with}} some salvaged specimens, the skeleton alone may be preserved. Dried tissue is removed from skeletons by using dermestid beetle larvae (genus Dermestes). Whereas in the past arsenic was routinely added to skins to protect them from destruction by insects, specimens prepared today are generally protected by an initial freezing period to kill insects and their eggs followed by keeping them in high-quality museum cases in a climate-controlled room. Each specimen has data associated with it, and the amount of data available is usually directly correlated with the specimen’s scientific value. Most specimens are of little value for research without accompanying information, such as the time and place the bird was found or collected. This and other important information, such as mass, sex, fat deposition, and degree of skull ossification, is written on a label along with a unique field and museum number. Modern computerized museum databases include all of this information for each specimen, as well as the types of methods used to prepare the bird. Modern collections seek to maximize the utility of each preserved individual, and this includes recording detailed information about it. Most modern specimens also include a tissue sample preserved for genetic study. Online access to collections’ data is becoming increasingly available, and a cross-institutional database covering millions of computerized bird records is in development.|$|E
40|$|International audienceSalt {{has always}} been {{consumed}} by human being and {{is essential for the}} health of our cells. Nowadays, salt is consumed more than is advised (between 5 to 10 times more than the recommended 2 g/day), its overconsumption, can contribute to the deterioration of health. This is the reason why, in March 2001, a workgroup associating scientists, administrations, agencies, economic actors, and association of consumers was set up to decrease by 20 % the population consumption of salt. During the last years, measures have been taken by salt producers to diversify their commercial offer with standing products as well as guaranteed know-how products. For example, European producers intend to obtain Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) or Traditional Speciality Guaranteed (TSG) status in order to protect and value coarse <b>salt,</b> <b>ground</b> (fine) salt and flower of salt, based on the quality policy for the product of EU agriculture. Thus, our research team, by investigating the carotenoid-derived aroma compounds (so called norisoprenoids) on salt pan environment or in sea salt products, tries to amend PGI or TSG. The aim of this study is indeed to discuss the possibility to use such aroma compounds, formed by the degradation of carotenoids biosynthesized by microalgae, as markers for sea salt. The present work describes more specifically the results of the headspace GC/MS analysis of sea water and salt flower collected in Saint-Armel (France) ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceCommon salt, i. e. table salt, {{commonly}} {{employed in}} cooking, is cheaper than specialty marine salt ob-tained by evaporation of seawater in solar salterns. For a decade some European producers intended to access Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) or Traditional Specialty Guaranteed (TSG) status {{in order to}} protect and value coarse <b>salt,</b> <b>ground</b> (fine) salt and salt flower, based on the quality policy for the products of European Union (EU) agriculture. The PGI associates a product with a region, to confirm its authentic origin whereas TSG highlights the traditional character, either in the composition or means of production. The first success in this field was obtained by marine salt producers of Guérande, France that received a PGI label on March 20, 2012. In Europe, consumers are, for example, attracted by high price salt products {{that could be used in}} gourmet cooking. Moreover, empirical observation highlighted a con-cept of revenue linked with territorial qualities, that is to say, combining intrinsic quality of the product and its anchoring in a specific place with its history and its knowledge-to make. This observation is world-wide known for all kind of food and the hand-collected products are usually linked, by producers, to an area of production, like olive oil or wine. Academic literature is very scarce about the characteristics of salt products used in food, even if some papers dealing with volatile compounds present in marine salts were published these last years. Using headspace - solid phase micro extraction (HS-SPME) combined with gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (GC-MS) Donadio, Bialecki, Valla, and Dufossé (2011) summarized 58 volatile compounds in brines and "fleurs de sel" collected in solar salterns from Saint-Armel (Brittany, France). Another technique could be used to associate a salt product with its region of production, i. e. the 16 S rDNA fingerprinting of bacterial communities by Polymerase Chain Reaction-Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (Dufossé, Donadio, Valla, Meile and Montet, 2013). By using PCR-DGGE it is possible to estimate the microorganisms' diversity and to reveal the cultivable and non cultivable germs in a given ecosystem. Such a technique was successfully applied for traceability and origin determination of food products such as fish or fruits. The main objective of this work is to try linking volatile compounds or the PCR products with the geographical origin of the salts, with future application to salts produced around the Indian Ocean (Réunion island, Mauritius, Madagascar [...] .).
