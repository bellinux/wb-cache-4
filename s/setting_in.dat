5|$|The Forgotten Realms, {{the high}} fantasy {{campaign}} <b>setting</b> <b>in</b> which Baldur's Gate II is set, is a fictional world {{similar to a}} medieval Earth, but with its own peoples, geography, and history. In the Realms, as its inhabitants call it, fantastic creatures and magic are common.|$|E
5|$|Among other factors, {{the growth}} of {{low-cost}} airline flights to Bratislava, led by Ryanair, has led to conspicuous stag parties, primarily from the UK. While these are a boom to the city's tourism industry, cultural differences and vandalism have led to concern by local officials. Reflecting the popularity of rowdy parties in Bratislava {{in the early to}} mid-2000s, the city was a <b>setting</b> <b>in</b> the 2004 comedy film Eurotrip, which was actually filmed in the city and suburbs of Prague, the Czech Republic.|$|E
5|$|An {{epilogue}} flashback scene soon {{reveals that}} Kelso {{had known about}} the stolen morphine and Sheldon's involvement, after they and their other fellow Marines found the surplus supply on their ship home. However, Kelso refused {{to be involved in}} Sheldon's scheme to sell the drugs along with the other Marines, telling them all that they will lose his respect for them as Marines if they go through with the drug profiting, <b>setting</b> <b>in</b> motion the events of the game.|$|E
50|$|The trains were {{originally}} formed as eight-cars sets, {{with the first}} set introduced on 26 February 1986.

5|$|An {{important}} aspect of race preparation is grooming the course to provide a surface for skate-skiing and setting tracks for classic events. This takes into account snow physics, methods for packing snow and surface shaping, and the equipment used for these functions. Also key is the layout of grooming and track <b>setting</b> <b>in</b> the stadium with various formats for starts, finishes and intermediate functions for relays and pursuits.|$|E
5|$|Communities {{have formed}} around the creation, play and {{discussion}} of LARP. These communities have developed a subculture that crosses over with role-playing, fan, reenactment, and drama subcultures. Early LARP subculture focused on Tolkien-like fantasy, but it later broadened to include appreciation of other genres, especially the horror genre with the rapid uptake of the World of Darkness <b>setting</b> <b>in</b> the 1990s. Like many subcultures, LARP groups often have a common context of shared experience, language, humour, and clothing that can be regarded {{by some as a}} lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|D {{departs from}} {{traditional}} wargaming and assigns each player a specific character to play {{instead of a}} military formation. These characters embark upon imaginary adventures within a fantasy setting. A Dungeon Master serves as the game's referee and storyteller while maintaining the <b>setting</b> <b>in</b> which the adventures occur, and {{playing the role of}} the inhabitants. The characters form a party that interacts with the setting's inhabitants, and each other. Together they solve dilemmas, engage in battles, and gather treasure and knowledge. In the process the characters earn experience points in order to rise in levels, and become increasingly powerful over a series of sessions.|$|E

50|$|For any graph G, {{its line}} graph L(G) is claw-free, and hence a minimum maximal {{independent}} <b>set</b> <b>in</b> L(G) {{is also a}} minimum dominating <b>set</b> <b>in</b> L(G). An independent <b>set</b> <b>in</b> L(G) corresponds to a matching in G, and a dominating <b>set</b> <b>in</b> L(G) corresponds to an edge dominating <b>set</b> <b>in</b> G. Therefore a minimum maximal matching has {{the same size as}} a minimum edge dominating set.|$|R
50|$|The Turing degrees are {{partially}} {{ordered by}} Turing reducibility. The notation a &le;T b indicates {{there is a}} <b>set</b> <b>in</b> degree b that computes a <b>set</b> <b>in</b> degree a. Equivalently, a &le;T b holds {{if and only if}} every <b>set</b> <b>in</b> b computes every <b>set</b> <b>in</b> a.|$|R
5|$|Eastwood {{composed}} Changelings jazz-influenced score. Featuring lilting {{guitars and}} strings, it remains largely low-key throughout. The introduction of brass instruments evokes film noir, {{playing to the}} film's <b>setting</b> <b>in</b> a city controlled by corrupt police. The theme shifts from piano to a full orchestra, and as the story develops, the strings become more imposing, with {{an increasing number of}} sustains and rises. Eastwood introduces voices reminiscent of those in a horror film score during the child murder flashbacks. The score was orchestrated and conducted by Lennie Niehaus. It was released on CD in North America on , 2008, through record label Varèse Sarabande.|$|E
5|$|Ed Brubaker's uncle, John Paxton, was a noted Hollywood screenwriter in the 1930s and 1940s {{known for}} Murder, My Sweet, Crossfire, The Wild One and On the Beach. His wife, Sarah Jane Paxton, worked public {{relations}} for 20th Century Fox at the same time. They told Brubaker stories about their experiences, and he developed a lifelong fascination with the time and <b>setting.</b> <b>In</b> particular, {{he was drawn to}} the false personas he felt everyone had to put forward to succeed.|$|E
5|$|Ender's Game: Battle Room was {{a planned}} {{digitally}} distributed video game for all viable downloadable platforms. It was under development by Chair Entertainment, which also developed the Xbox Live Arcade games Undertow and Shadow Complex. Chair had sold the licensing of Empire to Card, {{which became a}} best-selling novel. Little was revealed about the game, save its <b>setting</b> <b>in</b> the Ender universe {{and that it would}} have focused on the Battle Room.|$|E

The Grand Duke of Geoff has hired the characters to discover {{the origin of the}} creatures, and stop their incursions.|$|E
5|$|Gravitational {{redshift}} {{was first}} measured {{in a laboratory}} <b>setting</b> <b>in</b> 1959 by Pound and Rebka. It is also seen in astrophysical measurements, notably for light escaping the white dwarf Sirius B. The related gravitational time dilation effect has been measured by transporting atomic clocks to altitudes of between tens {{and tens of thousands}} of kilometers (first by Hafele and Keating in 1971; most accurately to date by Gravity Probe A launched in 1976).|$|E
5|$|Herbals {{contributed to}} botany by <b>setting</b> <b>in</b> train {{the science of}} plant description, classification, and botanical illustration. Up to the 17th century botany and {{medicine}} were {{one and the same}} but those books emphasising medicinal aspects eventually omitted the plant lore to become modern pharmacopoeias; those that omitted the medicine became more botanical and evolved into the modern compilations of plant descriptions we call Floras. These were often backed by specimens deposited in a herbarium which was a collection of dried plants that verified the plant descriptions given in the Floras. The transition from herbal to Flora marked the final separation of botany from medicine.|$|E

5|$|Horror LARPs are {{inspired}} by horror fiction. Popular subgenres include zombie apocalypse and Cthulhu Mythos, sometimes using the published Cthulhu Live rules. The World of Darkness, published by White Wolf Publishing, is a widely used gothpunk horror <b>setting</b> <b>in</b> which players usually portray secretive supernatural creatures such as vampires and werewolves. This setting can be played using Mind's Eye Theatre, which {{is a set of}} LARP rules also published by White Wolf. World of Darkness LARPs are usually played in a chronicle, a series of short events held at regular intervals, and are also popular at conventions. An international chronicle is run by White Wolf's official fan club, the Camarilla.|$|E

Modern fiction has also used Glastonbury as a setting including The Age of Misrule series of books by Mark Chadbourn in which the Watchmen appear, a group selected from Anglican priests in and around Glastonbury to safeguard knowledge of a gate to the Otherworld on top of Glastonbury Tor. John Cowper Powys's novel A Glastonbury Romance is set in Glastonbury and is concerned with the Grail.|$|E

5|$|Many astronomical {{alignments}} {{have been}} claimed for Stonehenge, {{a complex of}} megaliths and earthworks in the Salisbury Plain of England.

However, this interpretation has been challenged by some archaeologists who argue that the midwinter alignment, where the viewer is outside Stonehenge and sees the sun <b>setting</b> <b>in</b> the henge, is the more significant alignment, and the midsummer alignment may be a coincidence due to local topography.|$|E
