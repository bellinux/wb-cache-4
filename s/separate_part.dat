5|$|The love dart {{is not a}} penial stylet (in {{other words}} {{this is not an}} {{accessory}} organ for sperm transfer). The exchange of sperm between both of the two land snails is a completely <b>separate</b> <b>part</b> of the mating progression. Nevertheless, recent research shows that use of the dart can strongly favor the reproductive outcome for the snail that is able to lodge a dart in its partner. This is because mucus on the dart introduces a hormone-like substance that allows far more of its sperm to survive.|$|E
5|$|Following from draft {{plans in}} August 2016, a new {{planning}} application was submitted by Interesting Developments on 16 January 2017 {{to convert the}} pub back into a house as it appeared around 1900, demolishing the 20th century extensions and modifications and restoring historic features such as the interior fireplaces and the oculus window, A <b>separate</b> <b>part</b> to the planning application included three two-storey two-bedroom terraced houses to be constructed on the pub garden, along with a redesigned and landscaped car park to include a charging station. An additional house {{to the rear of}} the pub was considered but not proposed; campaigners criticised the absence of plans to preserve some historic features, the partial demolition of the building and the proximity of the new buildings. Despite objections, planning permission was granted by Medway Council on 13 June 2017.|$|E
5|$|The MP 40 submachine {{guns are}} open-bolt, blowback-operated {{automatic}} arms. The only mode of fire was fully automatic, but {{the relatively low}} rate of fire enabled single shots with controlled trigger pulls. The bolt features a telescoping return spring guide {{which serves as a}} pneumatic recoil buffer. The cocking handle was permanently attached to the bolt on early MP 38s, but on late production MP 38s and MP 40s, the bolt handle was made as a <b>separate</b> <b>part.</b> It also served as a safety by pushing the head of handle into one of two separate notches above the main opening; this action locked the bolt either in the cocked (rear) or uncocked (forward) position. The absence of this feature on early MP 38s resulted in field expedients such as leather harnesses with a small loop, used to hold the bolt in forward position.|$|E

25|$|In antiquity, penance {{had been}} a public ritual. Penitents were divided into a <b>separate</b> <b>part</b> of the church during liturgical worship, and they came to mass wearing {{sackcloth}} and ashes in {{a process known as}} exomologesis that often involved some form of general confession. There is evidence that this public penance was preceded by a private confession to a bishop or priest (sacerdos), and it seems that, for some sins, private penance was allowed instead. Nonetheless, penance and reconciliation was prevailingly a public rite (sometimes unrepeatable), which included absolution at its conclusion.|$|E
25|$|The {{composer}} Alvin Lucier {{has written}} many pieces that feature interference beats as their main focus. Italian composer Giacinto Scelsi, whose style is grounded on microtonal oscillations of unisons, extensively explored the textural effects of interference beats, particularly {{in his late}} works such as the violin solos Xnoybis (1964) and L'âme ailée / L'âme ouverte (1973), which feature them prominently (note that Scelsi treated and notated each string of the instrument as a <b>separate</b> <b>part,</b> so that his violin solos are effectively quartets of one-strings, where different strings of the violin may be simultaneously playing the same note with microtonal shifts, so that the interference patterns are generated). Composer Phill Niblock's music is entirely based on beating caused by microtonal differences.|$|E

Their younger brother Ariqboke {{took advantage of the}} absence of Hulagu and Kublai, and used his position at the capital to win the title of great khan for himself, with representatives of all the family branches proclaiming him as the leader at the kurultai in Karakorum. When Kublai learned of this, he summoned his own kurultai at Kaiping, and nearly all the senior princes and great noyans in North China and Manchuria supported his own candidacy over that of Ariqboke.|$|E

25|$|The {{pollution}} that {{is associated}} with death has to be handled carefully. A <b>separate</b> <b>part</b> of the home is designated to house the corpse for funeral proceedings before being taken away. The priest comes to say prayers that are for the cleansing of sins and to affirm the faith of the deceased. Fire is brought to the room and prayers are begun. The body is washed and inserted clean within a sudre and kusti. The ceremony then begins, and a circle is drawn around the body into which only the bearers may enter. As they proceed to the cemetery they walk in pairs and are connected by white fabric. A dog is essential in the funeral process because it is able to see death. The body is taken to the tower of death where the vultures take care of it. Once the bones are bleached by the sun the bones are pushed into the circular opening in the center. The mourning process is four days long, and rather than creating graves for the dead, charities are established in honor of the person.|$|E

25|$|The crew {{travel to}} Ti'atha Forest where they {{encounter}} {{the spirit of}} Kisala's father, King Albioth (Fred Tatasciore). Albioth had faced Mother, but lost and {{had turned into a}} beast. He tells them the only way she can be defeated is by neutralizing the power of her Rune, using Drigellum energy; which can only be found in the hearts of good people. Each of the party's hearts generates Drigellum, which is forged into a sword. The party enter Mother's lair and fight her. Jaster again releases the power of the Star King. He reveals Mother as being a sorceress named Ilzarbella (Wendee Lee) who served the Star King until she was seduced by the power of Rune. Using the Drigellum sword, the Star King/Jaster kills her. However, as soon as the battle ends, the Emperor arrives with the intention of collecting the Rune energy to create beasts so as to continue the war. However, Rune takes over the ship, killing Valkog and Norma, and integrating them into an organic vessel which it uses to attack Jaster and his group. The group split up, with each member attacking a <b>separate</b> <b>part</b> of the ship, eventually defeating it.|$|E
25|$|Champe Ransom, whom Stevenson {{hired as}} an {{assistant}} in the 1970s, wrote an unpublished report about Stevenson's work, which Edwards cites in his Immortality (1992) and Reincarnation (1996). According to Ransom, Edwards wrote, Stevenson asked the children leading questions, filled in gaps in the narrative, did not spend enough time interviewing them, and left too long a period between the claimed recall and the interview; it was often {{years after the first}} mention of a recall that Stevenson learned about it. In only eleven of the 1,111 cases Ransom looked at had there been no contact between the families of the deceased and of the child before the interview; in addition, according to Ransom, seven of those eleven cases were seriously flawed. He also wrote that there were problems with the way Stevenson presented the cases, in that he would report his witnesses' conclusions, rather than the data upon which the conclusions rested. Weaknesses in cases would be reported in a <b>separate</b> <b>part</b> of his books, rather than during the discussion of the cases themselves. Ransom concluded that it all amounted to anecdotal evidence of the weakest kind.|$|E
500|$|The C5 was {{produced}} in great secrecy in a <b>separate</b> <b>part</b> of the Hoover factory with its own duplicate facilities.

A mechanical arm simulated the weight of a person weighing [...] and the vehicle's brakes were tested under load. At the end of the process the C5s which had passed testing were rolled into cardboard boxes and loaded straight onto distribution lorries in stacks. Around £100,000 was spent to set up the factory.|$|E

After StarGate played it to her, they called Blanco from London {{and told him that}} she liked the song: [...] "She's flippin' out. She played it like seven times in a row. It's her favorite song." [...] Phil Tan and the assistant Daniela Rivera, mixed and mastered [...] "Diamonds". Recalling it, in an interview with The Huffington Post, Blanco commented, [...] "we needed to have it recorded, the beat finished, mixed and mastered in 24 hours. She was recording in a <b>separate</b> <b>part</b> of the world, sending back the files, we're finishing the music and then we're mixing and mastering it, and then it was out in a few days.

500|$|In {{conventional}} graph {{representation of}} circuits, {{there is no}} means of explicitly representing mutual inductive couplings, such as occurs in a transformer, and such components {{may result in a}} disconnected graph with more than one <b>separate</b> <b>part.</b> [...] For convenience of analysis, a graph with multiple parts can be combined into a single graph by unifying one node in each part into a single node. [...] This makes no difference to the theoretical behaviour of the circuit so analysis carried out on it is still valid. [...] It would, however, make a practical difference if a circuit were to be implemented this way in that it would destroy the isolation between the parts. [...] An example would be a transformer earthed on both the primary and secondary side. [...] The transformer still functions as a transformer with the same voltage ratio but can now no longer be used as an isolation transformer.|$|E
500|$|Beliefs about {{slow lorises}} {{and their use}} in {{traditional}} practices are deep-rooted and go back at least 300years, if not earlier based on oral traditions. [...] In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, {{it was reported that}} the people from the interior of Borneo believed that slow lorises were the gatekeepers for the heavens and that each person had a personal slow loris waiting for them in the afterlife. [...] More often, however, slow lorises are used in traditional medicine or to ward off evil. The following passage from an early textbook about primates is indicative of the superstitions associated with slow lorises: Many strange powers are attributed to this animal by the natives of the countries it inhabits; there is hardly an event in life to man, woman or child, or even domestic animals, that may not be influenced for better or worse by the Slow Loris, alive or dead, or by any <b>separate</b> <b>part</b> of it, and apparently one cannot usually tell at the time, that one is under supernatural power. Thus a Malay may commit a crime he did not premeditate, and then find that an enemy had buried a particular part of a Loris under his threshold, which had, unknown to him, compelled him to act to his own disadvantage. ... life is not a happy one, for it is continually seeing ghosts; that is why it hides its face in its hands.|$|E
