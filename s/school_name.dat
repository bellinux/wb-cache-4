25|$|From {{at least}} {{the time of the}} Shang dynasty, the Han Chinese {{observed}} a number of naming taboos regulating {{who may or may not}} use a person's given name (without being disrespectful). In general, using the given name connoted the speaker's authority and superior position to the addressee. Peers and younger relatives were barred from speaking it. Owing to this, many historical Chinese figures—particularly emperors—used a half-dozen or more different names in different contexts and for different speakers. Those possessing names (sometimes even mere homophones) identical to the emperor's were frequently forced to change them. The normalization of personal names after the May Fourth Movement has generally eradicated aliases such as the <b>school</b> <b>name</b> and courtesy name but traces of the old taboos remain, particularly within families.|$|E
25|$|The <b>school</b> <b>name</b> {{was changed}} to İstanbul Sultanisi (Istanbul High School) in 1913. Following {{the closing of the}} foreign schools in İstanbul due to the {{beginning}} of the First World War, İstanbul Sultanisi was moved to the buildings of the Saint Benoit High School, and some parts of the buildings were changed to dormitories. The faculty was supported with the addition of prominent teachers, and the student populace exceeded 1600. Subsequent to the increased collaboration between the German and Ottoman Empires, 22 German teachers were sent by the German Ministry to the school, and the curriculum {{was changed to}} German. The curriculum was similar to Galatasaray High School, only the foreign language was German instead of French. The students would take 14 hours of weekly lessons in German, and the same lectures again in Turkish, except history and literature, which were taught only in Turkish.|$|E

500|$|The <b>school</b> <b>name</b> {{was changed}} to Barnard Castle School in 1924, and it was by this time {{one of the largest}} public schools in the North of England. When Harold Birkbeck was {{appointed}} headmaster in 1935 there were 193 pupils. In 1942 the school was elected to the Headmaster's Conference, making it an [...] "official" [...] public school. Following the introduction of the Education Act 1944, from 1945 the school became a direct grant grammar school and the number of pupils enrolled at the school increased substantially. In April 1961 a £65,000 (£1.1 million in 2010) appeal was launched for funding to build new science blocks and a library building. By this time there were 470 boys at the school, more than half of whom progressed to universities or higher education. Birkbeck introduced squash to the school, and made it one of the best-known schools for the sport in the country in the 1960s and 1970s. The novelist Will Cohu described the school in 1974 as [...] "a rugged Victorian establishment in a brooding Jacobean-style building overlooking the Tees ... The school was popular with parents who were in the armed forces. It was cheap, did not have any reputation for abuse, and was strong on games". The direct-grant revenue stream was abolished in 1975, making the school reliant upon independent funding. An appeal was launched that year to ensure the school's survival, with £109,000 (£750,000 in 2011) raised within nine months. The school's first computer was installed in January 1978.|$|E

2500|$|By the 1930s, Lane had {{a student}} {{population}} of over 7,000 boys. Since the school's building was not originally planned {{for such a}} huge student population, a new site for the school was chosen, and the building was designed by Board of Education architect John C. Christensen. [...] On its dedication day, September 17, 1934, the student body—over 9,000 boys—and faculty gathered at Wrigley Field and from there walked en masse several miles west to the new campus. (In 1983 and 2008, to celebrate the 75th and 100th anniversaries of the school, a march was held from the school to Wrigley Field.) Lane's huge student body necessitated that classes be held in three shifts. That year (1934), the <b>school</b> <b>name</b> was changed to the Albert Grannis Lane Technical High School to reflect the school's expanding curriculum, but was known to all simply as [...] "Lane Tech."

2500|$|After {{his wife}} died, and having had no children, {{he decided to}} set up a school using his {{available}} resources to create a legacy- saying in the royal charter that for all time there would be a school in Camberwell named after him. At the time, the establishment of a grammar school in England required the assent of the crown. This was obtained after the first school buildings were constructed. The original Charter bearing this assent has since been lost, although in 1929 the governors of the school obtained a certified extract from the Patent Rolls. This requirement for the agreement of the Crown explains the legend [...] "Founded in 1615 by Royal Charter" [...] that appears in various places beneath the <b>school</b> <b>name.</b> The Charter was granted by King James I, who had succeeded his cousin Elizabeth by this time.|$|E
