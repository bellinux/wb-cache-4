In April 1943, the League captured the governments of Bengal and, a month later, that of the North West Frontier Province. In none of these provinces had the League previously had a majority – only the arrest of Congress members made it possible. With all the Muslim dominated provinces except the Punjab under Jinnah's control, the artificial concept of a separate Muslim State was turning into a reality. However, by 1944, Jinnah's power and prestige were on the wane. A general sympathy towards the jailed Congress leaders was developing among Muslims, {{and much of the}} blame for the disastrous Bengal famine of 1943–44 during which two million died, had been laid on the shoulders of the province's Muslim League government. The numbers at Jinnah's meetings, once counted in thousands soon numbered only a few hundreds. In despair, Jinnah left the political scene for a stay in Kashmir. His prestige was restored unwittingly by Gandhi, who had been released from prison on medical grounds in May 1944 and had met Jinnah in Bombay in September. There he offered the Muslim leader a plebiscite in the Muslim areas after the war to see whether they wanted to separate from the rest of India. Essentially, it was an acceptance of the principle of Pakistan – but not in <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>words.</b> Jinnah demanded that the exact words be said; Gandhi refused and the talks broke down. Jinnah, however, had greatly strengthened his own position and that of the League. The most influential member of Congress had been seen to negotiate with him on equal terms. Other Muslim League leaders, opposed both to Jinnah and to the partition of India, lost strength.|$|E
500|$|An {{important}} {{deviation of}} the film's plot from history {{is that there}} is scant evidence in real life Austen and Lefroy's relationship went beyond acquaintance. Rather, all that is known of them together is that they danced at three Christmas balls before Tom returned to school and that Jane was [...] "too proud" [...] to ask his aunt about him two years later. In the latter years of Tom Lefroy's life, he was questioned about his relationship with Jane Austen by his nephew, and admitted to having loved Jane Austen, but stated that it was a [...] "boyish love". As is written in a letter sent from T.E.P. Lefroy to James Edward Austen Leigh in 1870,My late venerable uncle ... said in <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>words</b> that {{he was in love with}} her, although he qualified his confession by saying it was a boyish love. As this occurred in a friendly & private conversation, I feel some doubt whether I ought to make it public.Lori Smith, author of The Jane Austen Guide to Life, opined that:No doubt this relationship and her [...] repartee with Tom fueled her writing. Whether it was [...] "her greatest inspiration" [...] as the trailers for Becoming Jane claim, well, that's debatable. But I'm sure it provided as spark.However, contrary to the film's story line, Jane had attempted her first full-length novel before she met Tom and had already read The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling before meeting him. In a cut scene from the movie, it is clear that she is reading the novel for the second time, but in the theatrical release without that scene, it appears he introduces her to it.|$|E

2500|$|Justice White's {{point of}} {{departure}} {{was the fact that}} [...] "the Amendment does not refer to proportionality in <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>words,</b> but it does forbid 'excessive' fines, a restraint that suggests that a determination of excessiveness should be based at least in part on whether the fine imposed is disproportionate to the crime committed." [...] Accordingly, the Eighth Amendment imposed a strong proportionality requirement not simply on fines, but on all criminal punishments, including prison terms.|$|E
2500|$|Mary Gaudron, who herself {{would become}} a justice of the High Court, stated at Lionel Murphy's Memorial Service at Sydney Town Hall: [...] "There are <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>words</b> — reformist, radical, humanitarian, civil libertarian, egalitarian, democrat — they are all abstractions. My words are no better; but, for me, and perhaps {{for those of us}} who believe in justice based on {{practical}} equality, Lionel Murphy was — Lionel Murphy is — the electric light of the Law. He would take an ordinary old abstraction — like equal justice — he would expose it, he would illuminate the abstraction, he would make its form stark, and so he could then say as he did in McInnis' case, these words: [...] "Where the kind of trial a person receives depends on the amount of money he or she has, there is no equal justice".|$|E
2500|$|A third trailer was {{released}} in October 2012, entitled [...] "Beast of America". It initially shares similarities {{with the opening of}} BioShock, with Booker being taken to a lighthouse with instruction. From there, the trailer's first half shows in-game scenes of settings around Columbia representative of American Exceptionalism such as an amusement park, a public beach, and an ice-cream parlor, prior to demonstration many of the gameplay elements including the Skyhook and the Heavy Hitters. The trailer is set to Nico Vega's [...] "Beast", which, as stated by Times Matt Peckham notes, [...] "excoriates American apathy, in <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>words,</b> ' seeds for the Beast of America'". A fourth trailer, [...] "City in the Sky", {{was released}}, showcasing many of the game's elements, including Columbia, Booker, Elizabeth, Songbird, and Comstock. The fifth trailer [...] "The Lamb of Columbia", focuses more on Elizabeth, showing her importance to the war aboard Columbia, her potency of her powers, and how Booker comes to fear her.|$|E

'The health of Mrs Grummond was such that Lieutenant Wands and other friends urged him, for his family's sake, to be prudent, and avoid all rash movements and any pursuit that would draw them over Lodge Trail Ridge, and to report to Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel Fetterman the orders he had received.

2500|$|The Chu Ci {{never became}} a {{canonical}} work, {{not in the}} sense as did the Shi Jing. As David Hawkes puts it, [...] "he Chu Ci poems, however popular, belonged to no canon, dealt in matters that were outlandish and unorthodox, and originated outside of the area of sanctified Western Zhou tradition." [...] However, part of the Chu Ci tradition includes a Confucian outlook, glorifying the loyal minister who prefers death over compromising his integrity. Following its Han Dynasty publication, the Chu Ci was subject to various editorial treatment, including various commentaries and editions. The order in which the sections of the Chu Ci are currently generally arranged was established through editorial re-arrangement during or following the tenth or eleventh century. This is not true, however, of the Li Sao; which, in the Wang Yi edition, is titled [...] "Li sao jing", saying, in <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>words,</b> that this was [...] "classic": the other works (juan) of the Chu Ci anthology generally fall in the category of zhuan, or exegesis or amplification upon the original [...] "classic" [...] text.|$|E
2500|$|Singing {{consists}} {{mostly of}} vocables, though recordings and {{reports from the}} early 1900s and prior indicate there were {{a great deal more}} lyrics or vocal texts. Blackfoot people see the profusion of words in European American music and African American music as lessening the importance and meaning of both words and music; and the same for the manner of listening to such music, that is, for entertainment or enjoyment, often while doing other things: if someone needed to say <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>words,</b> why didn't they just talk (p.69). Blackfoot music is not based on instruments or texts, and singing is not supposed to sound like talking (or imitate any other sound). Typically, songs which contain texts are short and not repetitive, such as: [...] "It's a bad thing to be an old man", (Nettl, 1989, p.73, 1951 recording of a Crazy Dog Society song) or the relatively lengthy, [...] "Yonder woman, you must take me. I am powerful. Yonder woman, you must take me, you must hear me. Where I sit is powerful." [...] (Nettl, 1989, p.73, Wissler and Duvall 1909:85 sung by a rock to a woman in the buffalo-rock myth). Often when the text takes up most of the melody with fewer vocables the melodies are short. The vocables used, as in Plains Indian singing, are the consonants h, y, w, and vowels. They avoid n, c (ts) and other consonants. i and e tend slightly to be higher in pitch, a, o, and u lower (p.71). (Nettl, 1989) ...|$|E
