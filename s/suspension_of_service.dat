5|$|Entering the 21st century, {{progress}} continued despite several disasters. The September 11 attacks {{resulted in}} service disruptions on lines running through Lower Manhattan, particularly the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line, which ran directly underneath the World Trade Center. Sections of the tunnel, {{as well as}} the Cortlandt Street station, which was directly underneath the Twin Towers, were severely damaged. Rebuilding required the <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> on that line south of Chambers Street. Ten other nearby stations were closed for cleanup. By March 2002, seven of those stations had reopened. The rest (except for Cortlandt Street on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line) reopened on September 15, 2002, along with service south of Chambers Street. In October 2012, Hurricane Sandy wreaked havoc, flooding several underwater tunnels and other facilities near New York Harbor, as well as trackage over Jamaica Bay. The immediate damage was fixed within six months but long-term resiliency and rehabilitation projects continue.|$|E

Its large wind field caused tropical storm force winds to the islands, with the highest wind report being 48 mph (71 km/h) in Key West. Rainfall from the hurricane's outer bands was intermittent, and storm tides of 5 ft (1.5 m) were reported. Further north, Captiva and Sanibel islands were completely inundated with water.

2500|$|Chávez {{said after}} his {{reinstatement}} as president, [...] "This coup d’etat {{would not have}} been possible without the help of the news media, especially television," [...] and began a campaign to establish a [...] "media hegemony" [...] to prevent similar media conduct from happening in the future. [...] To do so, Chávez used a [...] "two-pronged strategy" [...] in which his government strengthened its own media and [...] "closed, browbeaten or infiltrated almost every independent outlet." [...] In 2004, the Law on Social Responsibility in Radio and Television was passed, allowing the government to censor media in order to [...] "promote social justice and further the development of the citizenry, democracy, peace, human rights, education, culture, public health, and the nation’s social and economic development." [...] The law, which was extended to the Internet and social media in 2010, requires media companies to [...] "establish mechanisms to restrict, without delay, the dissemination of messages." [...] Violators can be fined up to 3,000 USD or 10 percent of the annual year’s income, or face <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> <b>service,</b> while journalists can be arrested with vague charges, including [...] "conspiracy against the state" [...] for criticizing the government. In 2007, Chávez revoked the license of leading anti-government broadcaster RCTV, and other stations began toning down dissent to avoid a similar fate. [...] In 2009, 34 radio stations were closed for [...] "technical and administrative reasons." [...] By the time of Chávez's death in 2013, he left a transformed media atmosphere in Venezuela with the media organizations that opposed him being silenced and an expanding state media as a result. Media workers face legal barriers, defamation lawsuits from Venezuelan officials or are targets of violence.|$|E
