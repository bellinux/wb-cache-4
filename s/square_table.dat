60|$|Tom understood, and {{ran into}} a nearby room, to bring out a <b>square</b> <b>table.</b> The {{stairway}} to the garret ran from a right angle of the wall, so that the table could be stood up against the door, with {{the bottom of the}} four legs against the wall opposite. Some books chanced to be handy, and the lads were able to place these against the wall under the feet of the table legs, thus wedging the door fast.|$|E

A big <b>square</b> <b>table</b> was littered with music, much being in manuscript--thus proving Dan'l's assertion {{that he was a}} composer. Benches were as numerous as chairs, and all were well-cushioned with tanned skins as coverings. A few good prints were on the walls and the aspect of the place was entirely agreeable to the old man's guests.|$|E

60|$|It was a dingy apartment, with {{a single}} large horse-hair chair {{and half a dozen}} small wooden dittoes, placed with {{mathematical}} precision along the walls. A <b>square</b> <b>table</b> in the centre and a shabby mirror over the mantelpiece completed the furniture. With the instinct of an old campaigner the major immediately dropped into the arm-chair, and, leaning luxuriously back, took a cigar from his case and proceeded to light it. Ezra Girdlestone seated himself near the table and twisted his dark moustache, as was his habit when collecting himself.|$|E

Outside the wind was rising, making a mournful sound as it swept through the cedars and the other trees in that vicinity. But inside the fire crackled merrily and the heat of the fitful flames as they roared up the chimney filled the lads with satisfaction.|$|E

In fact, new frocks for the pair were generally made necessary by Kate's tattered state, when Sylvia's garments were still available for little Lily, or for some school child.|$|E

This paper proposes a measure which can distinguish two kinds of marginal inhomogeneity for <b>square</b> <b>tables</b> with ordered categories. The measure is constructed using the arc-cosine function of symmetric cumulative probabilities.

60|$|When {{the girls}} {{got back to}} Echo Lodge they found that Miss Lavendar and Paul had carried the little <b>square</b> <b>table</b> {{out of the kitchen}} to the garden and had {{everything}} ready for tea. Nothing ever tasted so delicious as those strawberries and cream, eaten under a great blue sky all curdled over with fluffy little white clouds, and in the long shadows of the wood with its lispings and its murmurings. After tea Anne helped Charlotta wash the dishes in the kitchen, while Miss Lavendar sat on the stone bench with Paul and heard all about his rock people. She was a good listener, this sweet Miss Lavendar, but just at the last it struck Paul that she had suddenly lost interest in the Twin Sailors.|$|E
60|$|That the {{invitation}} to attend the <b>Square</b> <b>Table</b> Club over-shadowed the importance and significance of Bradley's entrance into public life, was an excellent commentary upon his real character. The State House, however, appealed to his imagination very strongly as he walked up its unfinished lawn, amid the heaps of huge limestone blocks, his eyes upon the looming façade of the west front. He walked the echoing rotunda with a timid air; and the beautiful soaring vault was so majestic in his eyes, he wondered if Washington could be finer. There were a few other greenhorns, like himself, looking the building over with the same minute scrutiny. He entered all of the rooms into which {{it was possible to}} penetrate, and at last into the library, a cheerful, rectangular room, into which the sun streamed plenteously.|$|E

In about twenty minutes the dinner was ready. The table itself was as neat and nice as possible, and the dishes which had been ordered were {{prepared}} in the most perfect manner. I need not add, I suppose, that Mr. George and Rollo--it being now so late--were provided with excellent appetites. So they had a very good time eating their dinner. While they were eating it they could watch the changes in the scenery of the banks, as they glided swiftly along, and observe the steamers, tow boats, and other river craft, that passed them from time to time.|$|E

The ads would consist of the men bringing up a certain topic or situation, from simple beer-related topics, such as whether anything other than beer be stored in the garage fridge, or if crushing a beer can on your head is permissible, etc. Other topics would be slightly more serious, such as how long one can wait before asking out his best friend's ex-girlfriend, or if it's okay to leave a game early to beat the traffic. After a short discussion on the topic, the men will come to a consensus on a new Man Law, {{at which point the}} men raise their beer bottles (or sometimes cans) and proclaim, [...] "Man Law!", at which point the <b>Square</b> <b>Table's</b> elderly scribe would write the new Man Law down.|$|R

The two chairs opposite them are empty. On their right come, first, a vacant chair, and then one very fully occupied by B. B., who basks blissfully in the moonbeams. On their left, Schutzmacher and Walpole. The entrance to the hotel is on their right, behind B. B. The five men are silently enjoying their coffee and cigarets, full of food, and not altogether void of wine.|$|E

He had the same subtle air of the court which I had observed both in Monmouth and in Sir Gervas, which, with his high bold features and large piercing eyes, marked him {{as a leader of}} men. His private scrivener sat beside him, taking notes of his directions, while the others stood behind in a half circle, or took snuff together in the deep recess of the window.|$|E
