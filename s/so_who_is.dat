In the summer of 1997, Superman Lives entered pre-production, with an art department employed under production designer Rick Heinrichs. Burton hired Wesley Strick to rewrite Smith's script. Smith was disappointed, stating, [...] "The studio was happy with what I was doing. Then Tim Burton got involved, and when he signed his pay-or-play deal, {{he turned around and}} said he wanted to do his version of Superman. <b>So</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> Warner Bros. going back to? The guy who made Clerks, or the guy who made them half a billion dollars on Batman?" [...] When Strick read Smith's script, he was annoyed with the fact that [...] "Superman was accompanied/shadowed by someone/something called the Eradicator." [...] He also felt that [...] "Brainiac's evil plot of launching a disk in space to block out the sun and make Superman powerless was reminiscent of an episode of The Simpsons, with Mr. Burns doing the Brainiac role." [...] However, after reading The Death and Return of Superman, Strick was able to understand some of the elements of Smith's script. Strick's rewrite featured Superman as an existentialist, thinking of himself to be an outsider on Earth. Superman is threatened by Brainiac and Lex Luthor, who later amalgamate into [...] "Lexiac," [...] described by Strick as [...] "a schizo/scary mega-villain." [...] Superman is later resurrected by the power of 'K,' a natural force representing the spirit of Krypton, as he defeats Lexiac.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2013, {{described}} by the Daily Post as a [...] "popular young leader" [...] on the Opposition benches, he strongly criticised {{what he saw as}} the Kilman government's lack of [...] "fiscal responsibility", with a lack of funding for decentralisation or for students' scholarships, while ministers and MPs still had their foreign travels funded. During a speech in Parliament criticising budget priorities, he mentioned Kilman's [...] "directive to the Public Service not to buy any new cars, and then they went and bought 25 million vatu worth of new vehicles. <b>So</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> the boss of the Public Service? Are you - the Prime Minister - not the boss?" [...] Highlighting the country's trade deficit, he added: â€œWe see less exports and more imports. Since we joined the WTO, less exports and more imports. Local businesses are breaking down. We spend hundreds of millions of vatu in trade, but {{what do we do with}} it? We talk about more development needed in the productive sector, but kill it off". He nonetheless noted the budget safeguards on spending on education and health, and voted in favour of the budget so as not to block necessary spending on public services.|$|E

6000|$|As a rule, {{that kind}} of a person sees only one side of the case. He sees that his {{invention}} or his painting or his book is--apparently--a trifle better than you yourself can do, therefore why shouldn't you be willing to put your hall-mark on it? You will be giving the purchaser his full money's worth; <b>so</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> hurt, and where is the harm? Besides, are you not helping a struggling fellow-craftsman, and is it not your duty to do that? ...|$|E

[...] "She is not another man's wife, {{and it appears that}} she has married me {{according}} to the custom of this awful place, <b>so</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> the worse? Any way, madam," [...] he went on, [...] "whatever she has done I have done too, so if she is to be punished let me be punished also; and I tell thee," [...] he went on, working himself up into a fury, [...] "that if thou biddest one of those dead and dumb villains to touch her again I will tear him to pieces!" [...] And he looked as though he meant it.|$|E

60|$|The secessionists of Maryland and of Virginia may {{consent to}} live in obscurity; but if this be <b>so,</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> to rule in those States? From whence are to come the {{senators}} {{and the members of}} Congress; the governors and attorney-generals? From whence is to come the national spirit of the two States, and the salt that shall preserve their political life? I have never believed that these States would succeed in secession. I have always felt that they would be held within the Union, whatever might be their own wishes. But I think that they will be so held in a manner and after a fashion that will render any political vitality almost impossible till a new generation shall have sprung up. In the mean time life goes on pleasantly enough in Baltimore, and ladies meet together, knitting stockings and sewing shirts for the Southern soldiers, while the gentlemen talk Southern politics and drink the health of the (Southern) president in ambiguous terms, as our Cavaliers used to drink the health of the king.|$|E
60|$|Talk {{not of the}} {{perishable}} {{nature of}} enthusiasm; and rise above a craving for perpetual manifestations of things. He is to be pitied whose eye can only be pierced {{by the light of}} a meridian sun, whose frame can only be warmed by the heat of midsummer. Let us hear no more of the little dependence to be had in war upon voluntary service. The things, with which we are primarily and mainly concerned, are inward passions; and not outward arrangements. These latter may be given at any time; when the parts, to be put together, are in readiness. Hatred and love, and each in its intensity, and pride (passions which, existing in the heart of a Nation, are inseparable from hope)--these elements being in constant preparation--enthusiasm will break out from them, or coalesce with them, upon the summons of a moment. And these passions are scarcely less than inextinguishable. The truth of this is recorded in the manners and hearts of North and South Britons, of Englishmen and Welshmen, on either border of the Tweed and of the Esk, {{on both sides of the}} Severn and the Dee; an inscription legible, and in strong characters, which the tread of many and great blessings, continued through hundreds of years, has been unable to efface. The Sicilian Vespers are to this day a familiar game among the boys of the villages on the sides of Mount Etna, and through every corner of the Island; and 'Exterminate the French!' is the action in their arms, and the word of triumph upon their tongues. He then is a sorry Statist, who desponds or despairs (nor is he less <b>so</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> too much elevated) from any considerations connected with the quality of enthusiasm. Nothing is so easy as to sustain it by partial and gradual changes of its object; and by placing it in the way of receiving new interpositions according to the need. The difficulty lies--not in kindling, feeding, or fanning the flame; but in continuing so to regulate the relations of things--that the fanning breeze and the feeding fuel shall come from no unworthy quarter, and shall neither of them be wanting in appropriate consecration. The Spaniards have as great helps towards ensuring this, as ever were vouchsafed to a People.|$|E
