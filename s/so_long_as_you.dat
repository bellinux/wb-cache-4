500|$|In December 1997, Southall went to Alvin Martin's Southend United of the Second Division on loan. He made 9 {{appearances}} {{in a brief}} stay at Roots Hall. He joined Chris Kamara's First Division Stoke City in February 1998. Kamara resigned two months later, and caretaker-manager Alan Durban pulled Southall aside {{on his first day}} in charge to say [...] "I'll let you manage the reserves, <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> keep your head down, do whatever I tell you, and I won't tell everybody you're a bad influence". Southall was shocked by Durban's words and could not explain his attitude. Both Southend and Stoke would end the season bottom of their respective divisions and Everton only avoided relegation {{on the last day of}} the season. He left the Britannia Stadium in the summer, and later said [...] "one of the worst episodes of my life had drawn to a close".|$|E
500|$|In 2003, in {{an attempt}} to {{maintain}} secrecy over the impending release of the fifth Harry Potter book, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Rowling and her publishers sought and received a groundbreaking injunction against [...] "the person or persons who has or have physical possession of a copy of the said book or any part thereof without the consent of the Claimants". The ruling obtained, {{for the first time in}} British law, an injunction against unnamed or unknown individuals; before then, injunctions could only be obtained against named individuals. Lawyers Winterbothams noted that, [...] "The new Harry Potter style injunction could be used if you expected a demonstration or trespass to take place, but which had not yet begun, <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> could find a description for the people expected which the Court was satisfied identified 'those who are included and those who are not'". The [...] "Potter injunction" [...] was later used against a camp of Roma travellers. In 2006, pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline employed the injunction against anonymous animal rights campaigners who had sent threatening letters to their investors.|$|E
500|$|Jon Hamm {{was cast}} as Don Draper, the central {{character}} of the series. Hamm, who was relatively unknown at the time, competed with 80 other actors in the auditioning process. Weiner proclaimed that Hamm accurately portrayed the character, {{saying that he was}} [...] "the only person who really had this great mix of empathy and masculinity and intelligence. Both Don and Jon have an inner life. <b>So</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> have that kind of depth in a human being, people will root for him [...] Jon {{walked out of the room}} and I said, 'That guy has lived.'" [...] Hamm admitted that he felt that he had a considerable disadvantage compared to his peers and initially believed Thomas Jane would acquire the role. [...] "I started, literally, on the very, very bottom," [...] he iterated. [...] "I couldn't have had less heat on me. Nobody knew who I was. The casting directors didn't know who I was. I wasn't on anybody's lists. The funny thing was, I think they went to Thomas Jane for it, and they were told that Thomas Jane does not do television." [...] Hamm went through seven auditions; his last one took place at the Hotel Gansevoort in the Meatpacking District of New York City. [...] "When we were riding down on the elevator, the woman in charge of whatever the decision-making process was told me, 'You got the job.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Patton {{views on}} race were {{complicated}} and often negative. This {{may have been}} cultivated from his privileged upbringing and family roots in the southern United States. Privately he wrote of black soldiers: [...] "Individually they were good soldiers, but I expressed my belief at the time, and have never found the necessity of changing it, that a colored soldier cannot think fast enough to fight in armor." [...] He also stated that performance {{was more important than}} race or religious affiliation: [...] "I don't give a damn who the man is. He can be a nigger or a Jew, but if he has the stuff and does his duty, he can have anything I've got. By God! I love him." [...] Addressing 761st Tank Battalion Patton also said, [...] "Men, you are the first Negro tankers ever to fight in the American Army. I would never have asked for you if you weren't good. I have nothing but the best in my army. I don't care what color you are, <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> go up there and kill those Kraut sonsabitches! Everyone has their eyes on you and is expecting great things from you. Most of all, your race is looking forward to you. Don't let them down and, damn you, don't let me down!" [...] Likewise, Patton called heavily on the black troops under his command. Historian Hugh Cole notes that Patton was the first to integrate black and white soldiers into rifle companies.|$|E
500|$|Man on the Moon: The End of Day {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 71, based on 15 reviews. The Boston Globe praised the experimental {{quality of the}} album: [...] "It's spacey, adventurous, and ridiculously intriguing if only because it's so different". Complimenting Cudi's [...] "introspective persona, ear for melody, and eclectic taste in beats," [...] Entertainment Weekly music reviewer Simon Vozick-Levinson called him [...] "a hyped upstart who really does represent a promising new phase in the genre's evolution." [...] David Jeffries of AllMusic called it [...] "a soul searcher [...] may require more patience than your everyday debut", but [...] "perfects the futuristic bleak-beat hip-hop Kanye purposed a year earlier, and rewards the listener with every tripped-out return." [...] Greg Kot, writing in the Chicago Tribune, believed that the album {{had the potential to}} turn heads as well as [...] "bum-rush the charts." [...] Slant Magazines Paul Schrodt wrote that the album attempts to be [...] "both a bigger pop platform and indie credibility", and felt that Cudi's verses [...] "are too good to ignore" [...] <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> do not take them too seriously. Ann Power of the Los Angeles Times called Man on the Moon a [...] "standout release" [...] in spite of [...] "Cudi's voice". Billboard magazine's Michael Menachem said that the album is [...] "anything but a traditional hip-hop recording" [...] and that Cudi's [...] "delivery is confident in a poetic and artful way". David Bevan of The A.V. Club said that, despite its filler, Cudi's [...] "thick layer of open, intense self-loathing is a clever way of unifying Man On The Moon as pure mood piece, a stream-of-consciousness pop voyage that’s more Phil Collins than rap." ...|$|E
500|$|David Denby of The New Yorker {{asserted}} that the austere, but captivating installment presented a [...] "glancing, chilled view" [...] of a world where succinct moments of loyalty coexisted with constant trials of betrayal. To USA Today columnist Claudia Puig, Fincher captures the [...] "menace and grim despair in the frosty Scandinavian landscape" [...] by carefully approaching its most gruesome features. Puig noted a surfeit of [...] "stylistic flourishes" [...] and [...] "intriguing" [...] changes in the narrative, compared to the original film. In his three-and-a-half star review, Chris Knight of the National Post argued that it epitomized a so-called [...] "paradoxical position" [...] that was both [...] "immensely enjoyable and completely unnecessary". Rene Rodriguez of The Miami Herald said that the [...] "fabulously sinister entertainment" [...] surpassed the original film [...] "in every way". The film took two-and-a-half stars from Rolling Stone commentator Peter Travers, who concluded: [...] "Fincher's Girl is gloriously rendered but too impersonal to leave a mark." [...] A. O. Scott, writing for The New York Times, admired the moments of [...] "brilliantly orchestrated" [...] anxiety and confusion, but felt that The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was vulnerable to the [...] "lumbering proceduralism" [...] that he saw in its literary counterpart, as evident with the [...] "long stretches of drab, hackneyed exposition that flatten the atmosphere". The Wall Street Journal Joe Morgenstern praised Cronenweth's cinematography, which he thought provided for glossy alterations in the film's darkness; [...] "Stockholm glitters in nighttime exteriors, and its subway shines in a spectacular spasm of action involving a backpack." [...] Rex Reed of The New York Observer professed that despite its occasional incomprehensibility, the movie was [...] "technically superb" [...] and [...] "superbly acted". In contrast, Kyle Smith of New York Post censured the film, calling it [...] "rubbish" [...] and further commenting that it [...] "demonstrates merely that masses will thrill to an unaffecting, badly written, psychologically shallow and deeply unlikely pulp story <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> allow them to feel sanctified by the occasional meaningless reference to feminism or Nazis." ...|$|E

2500|$|At this point, Cleon and Demosthenes {{declined}} {{to push the}} attack further, preferring to take as many Spartans as they could prisoner. [...] An Athenian herald offered the Spartans a chance to surrender, and the Spartans, throwing down their shields, agreed at least to negotiate. [...] Cleon and Demosthenes met with the Spartan commander Styphon (Styphon had initially been the third in command, but Epitadas had been killed and his first successor was severely wounded and had been left for dead). [...] Styphon requested to send a herald to the mainland to seek advice; the Athenians refused to allow any of the trapped men to leave, but permitted as many heralds from the mainland as were desired to pass back and forth. [...] Several messengers did so, the last of whom left Styphon with the message [...] "The Spartans order you to make your decision yourselves, <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> do nothing dishonorable."

2500|$|During {{his early}} years at Harvard, Lake {{continued}} to be active with The Churchmen's Union, an Anglican society {{for the advancement of}} liberal religious thought. [...] He and Foakes-Jackson lent their support to H. D. A. Major in organizing a conference of Modern Churchmen (which continues till this day). [...] The first was held at Ripon, Yorkshire, 3–6 July 1914. [...] Foakes-Jackson and Lake delivered an attack on Liberal Protestantism. [...] Lake said that the task of the liberal Christian is [...] "not to go back upon the inherited Catholic doctrines of the Church, but to apply and to expand them, because we see that in the end they are true <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> do not limit them." [...] The most famous of the conferences was the one held at Girton College, Cambridge, 8–15 August 1921. [...] Its subject was [...] "Christ and the Creeds" [...] and it was planned as a response to Lake's publication of the first volume of The Beginnings of Christianity. [...] Lake did not attend, so it was left to Foakes-Jackson to defend their positions. [...] He explained that he and Lake believed that the Jesus whom the early Church preached was not [...] "a character of singular charm and beauty during his life on earth, but a Risen Saviour who was expected to come speedily to judge the quick and the dead." [...] Liberal Protestants, he argued, were preaching a Christ who had no historical foundation. [...] From 1915 to 1931 Lake served as one of vice presidents of the union; however, after 1927 he began to part company with English Modernism and in 1932 he wrote to have his name removed from the list of vice presidents.|$|E
