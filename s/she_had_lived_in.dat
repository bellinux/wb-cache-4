5|$|One more legend narrated {{is about}} the goddess painted on a thangka in the monastery which is of Palden Lhamo. This female deity is {{compared}} to the Hindu Goddess Kali.

A moon disc adorns her hair, {{similar to the one}} seen on Shiva. She is also associated with Goddess Saraswati and Ma Tara. Legend also states that in the past <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> Sri Lanka as the consort of a demon king who practiced human sacrifice. As she was not supportive of this practice she fled from the kingdom. As she was running away, the king shot her shot with an arrow, which struck the backside of the mule that she was riding. When she drew out the arrow, it left a gaping hole in the mule's back, and through this gap Palden Lhamo could watch the teachings of Lord Buddha.|$|E

In the case of victims Mary Fleszar and Joan Schell, investigators were able to establish he had been a neighbor of both women, and {{that at the time of}} Fleszar's disappearance, Collins had actually worked in an office at the Eastern Michigan University located directly opposite the hallway from the office where Fleszar had herself worked. Through interviewing a recent girlfriend of Collins, investigators also learned that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> an apartment complex directly across the road from the home of victim Dawn Basom, and that, throughout their courtship, Collins had been a regular visitor to her apartment. As such, he may have become acquainted with Basom throughout the time he frequented his girlfriend.|$|E

In 1897, the magazine reported that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> retirement in Brighton for the past thirty-five years.

500|$|Lord Chief Justice William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield, {{considered}} wife {{sales to}} be {{a conspiracy to}} commit adultery, but few of those reported in the newspapers led to prosecutions in court. The Times reported one such case in 1818, in which a man was indicted for selling his wife at Leominster market, for 2s. 6d. [...] In 1825 a man named Johnson was charged with [...] "having sung a song in the streets describing the merits of his wife, {{for the purpose of}} selling her to the highest bidder at Smithfield." [...] Such songs were not unique; in about 1842 John Ashton wrote [...] "Sale of a Wife". The arresting officer claimed that the man had gathered a [...] "crowd of all sorts of vagabonds together, who appeared to listen to his ditty, but were in fact, collected to pick pockets." [...] The defendant, however, replied that he had [...] "not the most distant idea of selling his wife, who was, poor creature, at home with her hungry children, while he was endeavouring to earn a bit of bread for them by the strength of his lungs." [...] He had also printed copies of the song, and the story of a wife sale, to earn money. Before releasing him, the Lord Mayor, judging the case, cautioned Johnson that the practice could not be allowed, and must not be repeated. In 1833 the sale of a woman was reported at Epping. She was sold for 2s.6d., with a duty of 6d. Once sober, and placed before the Justices of the Peace, the husband claimed that he had been forced into marriage by the parish authorities, and had [...] "never since lived with her, and that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> open adultery with the man Bradley, by whom she had been purchased".

2500|$|Following Jurvetson's identification, {{both her}} family and cold case detectives named two {{individuals}} of significant interest in the case.
