[...] Certain composers are doing the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> over again, which I feel is sort of uninteresting. [...] I don't find that you grow very much in that way. [...] I like to keep changing, trying to do new things. [...] Basically, I'm saying the same thing with a little different twist on it.

I drew a good picture, and we both made out fine." [...] Bakshi also stated that Crumb threatened to disassociate himself from any cartoonist that worked with Bakshi, which would have hurt their chances at getting work published.|$|E
2500|$|Oral residue rarely disappears {{quickly and}} never vanishes completely. [...] Speech is {{inherently}} an oral event, based on human relationships, unlike texts. [...] Oral societies can mount strong resistance to literate technologies, as vividly {{shown in the}} arguments of Socrates against writing in Plato’s Phaedrus. [...] Writing, Socrates argues, is inhuman. [...] It attempts to turn living thoughts dwelling in the human mind into mere objects in the physical world. [...] By causing people to rely on what is written rather than what {{they are able to}} think, it weakens the powers of the mind and of memory. [...] True knowledge can only emerge from a relationship between active human minds. [...] And unlike a person, a text can’t respond to a question; it will just keep saying the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> over again, no matter how often it is refuted.|$|E

Sunny and Bobby were replaced by Justin Hagberg, who had previously played with Pipes in Allfather, a black metal band, and Shane Clark. Roadrunner put out an advertising blitz, and the track [...] "Deadly Sinners" [...] from the band's second release Advance and Vanquish appeared on numerous sampler CDs, compilations, and even three video games (Tony Hawk's Underground 2, Saints Row 2, and Brütal Legend), creating a huge press hype for the band that caused their popularity to skyrocket, with a slot on 2005's Road Rage tour in August (with bands like Machine Head and Chimaira) gaining them many new fans.|$|E

2500|$|While {{continuing}} to choose her subjects from her immediate urban environment, Fish changed her approach roughly {{at the turn}} of the century. Closely observed objects such as sections of floor tile and asphalt siding gave way to abstractly rendered thresholds, stairs and stair landings, a light fixture, and floor plans of rooms in her home. Like her earlier work, these paintings, she said, were impressed on the surface of the canvas in a way that approximated the experience of seeing the <b>same</b> <b>things</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over,</b> day after day. She came to see transitions as the subject of her work, the sense of walking across a threshold, moving from room to room; or the sense of light moving through a room during the day and into it from a wall fixture at night. She understood such transitions to be both actual and metaphorical. The visual elements she put on her canvases were meant to convey physical objects but also her own motion through the spaces they represented and the light that came from fixtures in the rooms and through the windows. The result could be seen, as one reviewer said, [...] "as a thoughtful meditation on the nature of occupancy within a domestic environment, exactingly rendered in multiple paint layers." ...|$|R

40|$|The "keyword " {{technique}} is particularly useful {{in helping to}} improve learning and memory skills of special education students. How often have we heard the complaint, "What is the use? I just taught Johnny those history facts yesterday, and he has forgotten them all today. I feel like I waste my time every day teaching him the <b>same</b> <b>things</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again. " This not un-common statement is heard from many special and remedial education teachers. In fact, memory skills {{are among the most}} commonly reported weaknesses of students in special and remedial class placements. Part of this problem lies in the areas of attention or motivation. Several instructional procedures, such as rapid paced instruction and reinforcement procedures, have been used to try to ameliorate these weak areas. A prob-lem equally great, however, is that of encoding and retrieving factual information. Recently, astonishing increases in factual recall have been achieved via a new instructional technique, the "keyword" method. This mnemonic (memory-enhancing) strategy relies on more effective encoding of factual information which, in turn, facilitates the retrieval process. For example, to remember that the Spanish vocabulary word "pato " means "duck " in English, the learner is first taught the keyword for "pato, " which is an acoustically similar, but easily pictured word. In this case...|$|R
40|$|Mini-dissertation (M. A. (Communication Studies)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007. This {{research}} paper investigates {{the functions of}} community newspapers {{in the battle against}} HIV/Aids. The research is conducted through studying literature, analysing four selected community newspapers and interviewing the editors of the newspapers. According to the literature, a community newspaper stands closer to the reader than any other newspaper, which means it could have a larger impact than for example a national paper. A community paper can provide information or start a debate in the community. The media can focus the attention of the reader on HIV/Aids through agenda setting. By giving the subject prominence in a publication, for instance, the media show how important they consider the subject. The functions of the press can be divided in different categories: the informative function, the press as a booster of the public debate, the service function, the educative function and the entertainment function. This study finds that not all the researched newspapers consider it their responsibility to cover HIV/Aids. The importance that the editors give to the subject and the number of articles that reaches the publication also does not match. The functions the newspapers mainly fulfil, are the information and education function. The reasons for a moderate coverage of HIV/Aids include a lack of statistics, a lack of information from organisations, staff shortages and fear that the reader will receive the opinion that the newspaper writes about the <b>same</b> <b>things</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again.
