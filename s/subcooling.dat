As 345°C is the boiling point of water at 155 bar, the liquid water is {{at the edge of a}} phase change. Thermal transients in the reactor coolant system result in large swings in pressurizer liquid/steam volume, and total pressurizer volume is designed around absorbing these transients without uncovering the heaters or emptying the pressurizer.

The gas is used to chill a chamber that normally has a series of pipes for the liquid running through it. The superheated gas then proceeds on to the compressor. The <b>subcooling</b> term refers to cooling the liquid below its boiling point. [...] of <b>subcooling</b> means it is 10 °F colder than boiling at a given pressure.

40|$|Vapor {{compression}} {{refrigeration system}} is usually designed such that refrigerant exits a condenser at <b>subcooled</b> liquid state {{in order not}} to cause possible damage to expansion devices. Even in small refrigeration systems incorporating capillary tube as an expansion device, the refrigerant is supposed to be <b>subcooled</b> before entering the expansion device. In this study, experimental apparatus equipped with several thermocouples, pressure transducers and visualization device was constructed in order to observe the behavior of refrigerant flow at condenser outlet of a vapor compression refrigeration system. Visual observation as well as temperature and pressure readings indicate the presence of two-phase flow at highly <b>subcooled</b> temperature. An alternative equation was suggested to calculate the enthalpy of the two-phase refrigerant in <b>subcooled</b> region and verification test was conducted...|$|R
30|$|In field practice, {{the liquid}} level cannot be {{directly}} measured from surface. Instead, temperature gauges are installed {{along the length}} of the producer well to measure the temperature difference between the fluid exiting the upper injector and entering the lower producer. This temperature difference is referred to as <b>subcool</b> and serves as a surrogate variable for liquid level height (Wilson 2015). The smaller the interwell <b>subcool</b> difference, the closer the produced liquids are to the steam temperature, and thus the smaller the height of the liquid pool (Gotawala and Gates 2012). However, <b>subcool</b> is not constant {{along the length of}} the production lateral; there is localized variability in <b>subcool.</b> Moreover, flow capacity of the wellbore is large compared to that of the reservoir in the same direction, making compensating steam movement in the reservoir difficult (Vander Valk and Yang 2007). Furthermore, local liquid levels cannot effectively drain parallel to the well due to the very low drainage angles (Edmunds 2013). Too low an average <b>subcool</b> and steam breakthrough will occur at points along the producing lateral, negatively impacting cumulative steam to oil ratio (cSOR), thermal efficiency, and the economics of the project. Too large an average <b>subcool</b> and liquid occupies a significant fraction of the steam chamber, preventing the free movement of steam to the chamber boundaries and potentially flooding the injector well itself (Banerjee et al. 2013 b; Carpenter 2015; Gotawala and Gates 2012). Flow control devices (FCDs) are used to overcome the problems with uneven steam trap height, allowing for more aggressive production rates and less manipulation of <b>subcool.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>subcooling</b> {{principle}} {{behind all}} these applications {{is the fact}} that, in terms of heat transfer, all the <b>subcooling</b> is directly added to the cooling capacity of the refrigerant (as superheating would be directly deducted). As compressors that are <b>subcooling</b> work on this easier conditions, higher pressure makes their refrigerant cycles more efficient, and the heat withdrawn by this means, cheaper than the one withdrawn by the main system, in terms of energy.|$|E
50|$|Finally, another {{widespread}} {{application of}} <b>subcooling</b> is boosting and economising. Inversely to superheating, <b>subcooling,</b> or {{the amount of}} heat withdrawn from the liquid refrigerant on the <b>subcooling</b> process, manifests itself as an increase on the refrigeration capacity of the system. This means that any extra heat removal after the condensation (<b>subcooling)</b> allows a higher ratio of heat absorption on further stages of the cycle. It is to be noted that superheating has exactly the inverse effect, and that an internal heat exchanger alone, {{is not able to}} increase the capacity of the system because the boosting effect of <b>subcooling</b> is dimmed by the superheating, making the net capacity gain equal to zero. Nevertheless, some systems are able to move refrigerant and/or to remove heat using up less energy because they do so on high pressure fluids that later cool or subcool lower pressure (which are more difficult to cool) fluids.|$|E
5000|$|The term <b>subcooling</b> {{refers to}} a liquid {{existing}} at a temperature below its normal boiling point. For example, water boils at 373 K; at room temperature (300 K) the water is termed [...] "subcooled". A subcooled liquid is the convenient state in which, say, refrigerants may undergo the remaining stages of a refrigeration cycle. Normally, a refrigeration system has a <b>subcooling</b> stage, allowing technicians {{to be certain that}} the quality, in which the refrigerant reaches the next step on the cycle, is the desired one. <b>Subcooling</b> may take place in heat exchangers and outside them.

40|$|AbstractSubcooled liquid {{solubility}} is {{the water}} solubility for a hypothetical state of liquid.

50|$|Another {{important}} and very common application of <b>subcooling</b> is its indirect {{use on the}} superheating process. Superheating is analogous to <b>subcooling</b> in an operative way, and both processes can be coupled using an internal heat exchanger. <b>Subcooling</b> here serves itself from the superheating and vice versa, allowing heat to flow from the refrigerant at a higher pressure (liquid), to the one with lower pressure (gas). This creates an energetic equivalence between the <b>subcooling</b> and the superheating phenomena {{when there is no}} energy loss. Normally, the fluid that is being subcooled is hotter than the refrigerant that is being superheated, allowing an energy flux in the needed direction. Superheating is critical for the operation of compressors because a system lacking it may provide the compressor with a liquid gas mixture, situation that generally leads to the destruction of the gas compressor because liquid is uncompressible. This makes <b>subcooling</b> an easy and widespread source of heat for the superheating process.|$|E

This thesis focuses on experimental and theoretical investigations on adiabatic bubbly flow and <b>subcooled</b> boiling flow in a BWR-scaled annular flow channel.

Databases of flow parameters and boundary parameters, such as active nucleation site density, bubble lift-off diameter, and bubble lift-off frequency, are also obtained for <b>subcooled</b> convective boiling in the annular test section. The one-dimensional, one-group interfacial area transport equation is evaluated based on the experimental data in the adiabatic bubbly flow. The correlation of distribution parameter, drift velocity, and Sauter mean diameter are evaluated from data in both adiabatic bubbly flow and <b>subcooled</b> boiling flow. A bubble-layer thickness model is proposed to avoid various covariances in the cross-sectional area averaged interfacial area transport equation in the <b>subcooled</b> boiling flow. The newly-developed model can predict the bubble-layer thickness as well as the void fraction profile by assuming a square void peak in the bubble-layer region. In addition, the constitutive equation for the distribution parameter in the drift-flux model for boiling flow of an internally heated annulus is also developed based from the measured data. A constitutive relation for the bubble lift-off size is developed based on a force balance and turbulence analysis. The comparisons between the constitutive relation and the experimental data show good agreements. In addition, a preliminary constitutive relation of the bubble lift-off frequency is also obtained.
