25|$|Reactive {{arthritis}} (previously Reiter's disease) – asymmetrically involves heel, <b>sacroiliac</b> {{joints and}} large joints of the leg. It is {{usually associated with}} urethritis, conjunctivitis, iritis, painless buccal ulcers, and keratoderma blennorrhagica.|$|E
25|$|The pelvis is {{the largest}} bony part of the {{skeleton}} and contains three joints: the pubic symphysis, and two <b>sacroiliac</b> joints. A highly durable network of ligaments surrounds these joints giving them tremendous strength.|$|E
25|$|It {{presents}} with monoarthritis {{affecting the}} large joints {{such as the}} knees and <b>sacroiliac</b> spine causing pain and swelling. An asymmetrical inflammatory arthritis of interphalangeal joints may be present but with relative sparing of small joints such as the wrist and hand.|$|E
25|$|The {{ankles and}} the <b>sacroiliac</b> joint were quite loosely fixed, while the pelvis had a {{flexible}} joint {{with only one}} coccygeal vertebra. The anteorbital muscle fenestrae in their crania suggest they probably had a long and mobile snout, {{similar to that of}} elephant shrews.|$|E
25|$|In {{later stages}} of {{pregnancy}} the fetus's head aligns inside the pelvis. Also joints of bones soften {{due to the}} effect of pregnancy hormones. These factors may cause pelvic joint pain (symphysis pubis dysfunction or SPD). As the end of pregnancy approaches, the ligaments of the <b>sacroiliac</b> joint loosen, letting the pelvis outlet widen somewhat; this is easily noticeable in the cow.|$|E
25|$|Kirby {{started his}} career when he left school {{at the age of}} 16, {{initially}} on a YTS scheme at Leicestershire County Cricket Club having been discovered in his native Lancashire. While at Leicestershire he had to overcome <b>sacroiliac</b> instability, a chronic bad back, remodelling his action to learn to bowl fast again, but the county released him after five seasons without making an appearance.|$|E
25|$|On March 11, Mauer was {{diagnosed}} with inflammation in the <b>sacroiliac</b> joint by team doctors following a magnetic resonance arthrogram. He was unable {{to take part in}} team workouts during spring training due to the pain in his lower back, which he first began experiencing late in the 2008 season. Mauer missed the start of the 2009 regular season and returned on May 1. He went 2 for 3 with an RBI and three runs scored in his first game back, hitting a home run on his first swing of the season.|$|E
25|$|The {{mesentery}} of {{the small}} intestine arises from {{the root of the}} mesentery (or mesenteric root) and is the part connected with the structures in front of the vertebral column. The root is narrow, about 15cm long, 20cm in width, and is directed obliquely from the duodenojejunal flexure at {{the left side of the}} second lumbar vertebra to the right <b>sacroiliac</b> articulation. The root of the mesentery extends from the duodenojejunal flexure to the ileocaecal junction. This section {{of the small}} intestine is located centrally in the abdominal cavity and lies behind the transverse colon and the greater omentum.|$|E
500|$|Psoriatic {{arthritis}} {{is a form}} {{of chronic}} inflammatory arthritis that has a highly variable clinical presentation and frequently occurs in association with skin and nail psoriasis. It typically involves painful inflammation of the joints and surrounding connective tissue and can occur in any joint, but most commonly affects the joints of the fingers and toes. [...] This can result in a sausage-shaped swelling of the fingers and toes known as dactylitis. Psoriatic arthritis can also affect the hips, knees, spine (spondylitis), and <b>sacroiliac</b> joint (sacroiliitis). About 30% of individuals with psoriasis will develop psoriatic arthritis. Skin manifestations of psoriasis tend to occur before arthritic manifestations in about 75% of cases.|$|E
500|$|Berry overcame several {{physical}} ailments {{during his}} football career, a fact he became famous for, {{but one that}} according to Berry was often exaggerated by the media. He was skinny and injury prone, such that when his college teammates saw {{him for the first}} time they sarcastically dubbed him, [...] "Jack Armstrong, the All-American Boy". Reportedly, because one leg was shorter than the other, Berry had to wear padding inside his shoe in order to walk properly. However, according to Berry, this was not entirely true. In actuality, bruised nerves near the <b>sacroiliac</b> joint occasionally caused misalignment in his back, which in turn affected his legs and caused one to become slightly shorter; it was not a permanent condition. To alleviate this, he wore a back brace for 13 years in the NFL. That he required specialized shoes was a myth, which Berry says was perpetuated by an overzealous information director with the Colts when Berry tried to compensate for his condition by putting something in his shoe during training camp.|$|E

2500|$|Both <b>sacroiliac</b> joints, formed {{between the}} {{auricular}} {{surfaces of the}} sacrum and the two hip bones. are amphiarthroses, almost immobile joints enclosed by very taut joint capsules. [...] This capsule is strengthened by the ventral, interosseous, and dorsal <b>sacroiliac</b> ligaments.|$|E
2500|$|The {{shape of}} the pelvis, most notably the {{orientation}} of the iliac crests and shape and depth of the acetabula, reflects the style of locomotion and body mass of an animal. [...] In bipedal mammals, the iliac crests are parallel to the vertically oriented <b>sacroiliac</b> joints, where in quadrupedal mammals they are parallel to the horizontally oriented <b>sacroiliac</b> joints. [...] In heavy mammals, especially in quadrupeds, the pelvis tend to be more vertically oriented because this allows the pelvis to support greater weight without dislocating the <b>sacroiliac</b> joints or adding torsion to the vertebral column.|$|E
2500|$|Spinal {{manipulation}} is {{an intervention}} performed on spinal articulations which are synovial joints, which is asserted to be therapeutic. These articulations in the spine that {{are amenable to}} spinal manipulative therapy include the z-joints, the [...] atlanto-occipital, atlanto-axial, lumbosacral, <b>sacroiliac,</b> costotransverse and costovertebral joints.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{important}} accessory ligaments of the <b>sacroiliac</b> joint are the sacrospinous and sacrotuberous ligaments which stabilize the hip bone on the sacrum {{and prevent the}} promonotory from tilting forward. [...] Additionally, these two ligaments transform the greater and lesser sciatic notches into the greater and lesser foramina, a pair of important pelvic openings.|$|E
2500|$|The {{clinical}} {{pattern of}} reactive arthritis commonly {{consists of an}} inflammation of fewer than five joints which often includes the knee or <b>sacroiliac</b> joint. The arthritis may be [...] "additive" [...] (more joints become inflamed {{in addition to the}} primarily affected one) or [...] "migratory" [...] (new joints become inflamed after the initially inflamed site has already improved).|$|E
2500|$|The {{pelvic girdle}} {{consists}} of the two hip bones. The hip bones are connected to each other anteriorly at the pubic symphysis, and posteriorly to the sacrum at the <b>sacroiliac</b> joints to form the pelvic ring. [...] The ring is very stable and allows very little mobility, a prerequisite for transmitting loads from the trunk to the lower limbs.|$|E
2500|$|The pubic {{symphysis}} has a [...] fibrocartilage joint {{which may}} contain a fluid filled cavity and is avascular; it {{is supported by}} the superior and arcuate ligaments. The <b>sacroiliac</b> joints are synovial, but their movement is restricted throughout life and they are progressively obliterated by adhesions. The nature of the bony pelvic ring with its three joints determines that no one joint can move independently of the other two.|$|E
2500|$|Ali {{defended his}} title against former heavyweight {{champion}} Floyd Patterson on November 22, 1965. Before the match, Ali mocked Patterson, who was widely known {{to call him}} by his former name Cassius Clay, as an [...] "Uncle Tom", calling him [...] "The Rabbit". Although Ali clearly had the better of Patterson, who appeared injured during the fight, the match lasted 12 rounds before being called on a technical knockout. Patterson later said he had strained his <b>sacroiliac.</b> Ali was criticized in the sports media for appearing to have toyed with Patterson during the fight.|$|E
2500|$|As a {{mechanical}} structure the pelvis may {{be thought of}} as four roughly triangular and twisted rings. Each superior ring is formed by the iliac bone; the anterior side stretches from the acetabulum up to the anterior superior iliac spine; the posterior side reaches {{from the top of the}} acetabulum to the <b>sacroiliac</b> joint; and the third side is formed by the palpable iliac crest. [...] The lower ring, formed by the rami of the pubic and ischial bones, supports the acetabulum and is twisted 80-90 degrees in relation to the superior ring.|$|E
2500|$|The iliolumbar {{ligament}} is {{a strong}} ligament which connects {{the tip of the}} transverse process of the fifth lumbar vertebra to the posterior part of the inner lip of the iliac crest. [...] It {{can be thought of as}} the lower border of the thoracolumbar fascia and is occasionally accompanied by a smaller ligamentous band passing between the fourth lumbar vertebra and the iliac crest. [...] The lateral lumbosacral ligament is partly continuous with the iliolumbar ligament. [...] It passes between the transverse process of the fifth vertebra to the ala of the sacrum where it intermingle with the anterior <b>sacroiliac</b> ligament.|$|E
2500|$|Peter Lever had a {{shoulder}} strain, John Snow {{was suffering from}} an inflamed <b>sacroiliac</b> joint [...] {{and they did not}} feel that they could bowl through another innings. The 40-year-old Illingworth was tired himself, took the advice of his bowlers and chose not to enforce the follow on, instead batting Australia out of the game. This caused great surprise to the pundits and old Test cricketers at the ground who felt that he had let Australia off the hook, This was a situation made for Geoff Boycott and ignoring the furore caused by his first innings he made 119 not out, making another century opening stand with John Edrich (40). Thomson (3–79) took three quick wickets to help reduce 103/0 to 151/4, but Ray Illingworth (48 not out) added 82 with Boycott before declaring on 233/4.|$|E
2500|$|Seemingly free {{of injury}} {{for the first}} time in years, Graf began the year by winning the Australian Open, where she {{defeated}} Arantxa Sánchez Vicario in the final with the loss of only two games. Graf later stated it was the best tennis she had ever played in a Grand Slam final. She then won her next four tournaments in Tokyo, Indian Wells, Delray Beach and Miami respectively. In the Miami final, she lost her first set of the year—to Natasha Zvereva—after winning 54 consecutive sets. In the Hamburg final, she lost {{for the first time}} in 1994 after 36 consecutive match victories, losing to Sánchez Vicario in three sets. She then won her eighth German Open, but there were signs that her form was worsening as she almost lost to Julie Halard in a quarterfinal. As the defending champion Graf lost in straight sets to Mary Pierce in the French Open semifinal. This was followed by a first-round straight-sets loss at Wimbledon to Lori McNeil, her only loss at Wimbledon between 1991 and 1997 and her first loss in a first round Grand Slam tournament in ten years. Graf still managed to win San Diego the following month but aggravated a long-time back injury in beating Sánchez Vicario in the final. Graf developed a bone spur at the base of her spine due to a congenital condition of the <b>sacroiliac</b> joint. She began to wear a back brace and was unsure about playing the US Open but elected to play while receiving treatment and stretching for two hours before each match. She made it to the final and took the first set against Sánchez Vicario but lost the next two sets [...] — Sanchez Vicario's last victory over Graf. In the middle of the second set, Graf suffered back spasms while reaching for a ball in the ad court. She took the following nine weeks off, returning only for the Virginia Slims Championships where she lost in straight sets to Pierce in the quarterfinal.|$|E
2500|$|In 1966 Gary Sobers' {{powerful}} West Indian team toured England and Snow was recalled {{after his}} 7/29 and 4/18 destroyed them before 10,000 people at Hove when Sussex beat the tourists by 9 wickets. He took 4/84 and 0/117 in the Third Test at Trent Bridge and 3/143 in the Fourth at Headingley but the West Indies won {{them both to}} go 3–0 up in the series and the formidable Brian Close was made captain for the final Test. Snow was initially dropped for [...] The Oval, but was recalled due to the injury to the recalled John Price, then considered the fastest bowler in England. It was the turning point of his career as England collapsed to 166 for 7, before Tom Graveney 165 and John Murray 112 consolidated, but it still left England a little short of a commanding score until Snow hit eight boundaries in his 59 not out and added 128 with fellow bowler Ken Higgs, who made 63. This was two runs short of the then Test record for the tenth wicket, and is still a Test record for the last wicket between England and the West Indies. It remains as the all-time Test match record partnership between batsmen 10 and 11. They retired to the pavilion for a beer afterwards, but had their pints hurriedly replaced by teacups for their newspaper picture by officials concerned {{with the image of}} the game. Snow's 59 not out was the first test 50 by an England number 11 batsman and remained a record until Jimmy Anderson made 81 against India in 2014. Snow (2/66 & 3/40) removed the West Indian openers Conrad Hunte and Easton McMorris for 12 runs in the second innings, Brian Close caught Sobers off him for a first ball duck and England won a stunning victory by an innings and 34 runs. Sobers explained that [...] "the ball from Snow bounced a bit but I suppose I was beaten by the speed more than anything. I didn't get hold of it properly, edged it into my body. It flew out to Brian and that was that". John Snow became a national hero and until 1973 was England's premier fast bowler and a regular player in the England Test team. This Test was the first of a run of 40 with only one defeat in 1966–71, of which Snow played 32. There was no tour in 1966–67 and in the summer of 1967 he took 13 wickets (30.00) against India and Pakistan, but missed the last two tests because of an inflammation of his <b>sacroiliac</b> joint.|$|E
2500|$|Fully {{aware that}} they needed to win the last Test to retain the Ashes the Australian {{selectors}} axed Bill Lawry, the first Australian captain ever to be dropped mid-series. Don Bradman, Sam Loxton and Neil Harvey delayed the announcement while they tried to locate Lawry {{at the end of the}} Sixth Test, but he had already left for his home in Melbourne and they were unable to find him. He first heard the news on the radio and the selectors were much maligned in the press as a result. Lawry never played for Australia again despite being only 33 and averaging 47.15, but began his 40-year career as a commentator in the Seventh Test, saying [...] "Well, I suppose we all have to get around to it some day". Although the appointment of the more aggressive Ian Chappell as captain (with Ian Redpath as his vice-captain) made sense, Lawry was still a redoubtable opening batsman who averaged 40.50 in the series and many thought that his services should have been retained. Instead the veteran Victorian opener Ken Eastwood was called up for his only Test after having made 177 against New South Wales. John Gleeson, Ashley Mallett and Ross Duncan were all dropped and replaced by debutant Tony Dell, a left-arm fast medium bowler, and the leg-spinners Kerry O'Keeffe and Terry Jenner. The selectors made another mistake in not recalling Garth McKenzie to partner his Western Australia team-mate Dennis Lillee after he had broken Geoff Boycott's arm on the same ground in a one-day match. McKenzie could have been a real handful for the England batsmen, and was only two wickets short of Richie Benaud's Australian Test record of 248 wickets (Benaud wrote 'Bring back McKenzie' in his newspaper column). This meant Australia's four man bowling attack had only 6 Test wickets to their name, the least since [...] in 1945–46 when seven players made their debut after the war. Boycott was, of course, unfit to play and Brian Luckhurst returned to open the innings, having missed the Sixth Test because of his bruised hands. John Snow had been suffering from an inflamed <b>sacroiliac</b> joint, which required traction and complete rest, but he was declared fit in time for the Test. This was Australian umpire Lou Rowan's last Test as he retired at the end of the season and the Australian selectors Don Bradman retired after 35 years, out of which Australian had held the Ashes for all but 6 years.|$|E
2500|$|Snow {{started his}} First Class Cricket and Test Match {{career as a}} fast-medium seam bowler, {{but when he was}} not chosen for the 1965–66 Ashes tour of Australia he played club cricket in South Africa and re-modelled his bowling action. He had bowled {{slightly}} chest-on, which restricted his pace and ability to move the ball. His work resulted in a more classical sideways-on action. This new style pleased the purists who referred to his [...] "graceful, yet deadly, action", and [...] "beautifully easy and controlled bowling method, slanting the ball into the batsman but also cutting it sharply off the pitch". However, Snow usually bowled only fast-medium in run-of-the-mill county and tour games and saved his fast bowling for Test Matches and when the mood took him on the pacey wickets at Hove. The best example is the Australian Tour of 1970–71 when he took 31 wickets (22.83) in the six tests, but only 7 wickets (71.57) in the six other first-class matches on the tour. Even in Tests [...] "he varied his pace cleverly, rarely bowling flat-out for a whole over, but unleashing the odd very quick delivery. Just like Charlie Griffith in the West Indies side of the 1960s, Snow had the ability to drop the ball slightly short and get it to lift painfully into the batsmen's body". As a result, he struck several batsmen on the head, Greg Chappell at Hove in 1968 when he was playing for Somerset and the tailenders Garth McKenzie and Terry Jenner in the Sydney Tests of 1970–71. Ian Chappell said that he always found something new in his bowling repertoire whenever he began a new series against him. Unlike Trueman and Statham, Snow had no regular new-ball partner, teaming up with David Brown, Jeff Jones, Alan Ward, Chris Old, Ken Shuttleworth, Peter Lever, Bob Willis, Geoff Arnold and others. Though his career overlapped that of Willis in 1971–76, injuries and selection problems prevented them from forming the impressive duo that they might have been. In 1967 he jarred his back while bowling against India at [...] X-rays found that he had a <b>sacroiliac</b> joint abnormality which had become inflamed and that the only cure was traction and complete rest. As a result, Snow became very insistent that he not be overbowled and was frequently accused of [...] "not trying" [...] when he was too ill to field properly. Once Ted Dexter made him bowl throughout a session for Sussex and he took a week to recover. When not bowling Snow often lounged around the outfield – ignoring the game if he felt it wasn't going anywhere – but had a fine throwing arm when he wanted to use it.|$|E

With sacroiliitis, the individual may experience pain in the low back, buttock or thigh, depending {{on the amount of}} inflammation. Common problems of the <b>sacroiliac</b> joint are often called <b>sacroiliac</b> joint dysfunction (also termed SI joint dysfunction; SIJD). <b>Sacroiliac</b> joint dysfunction generally refers to pain in the <b>sacroiliac</b> joint region that is caused by abnormal motion in the <b>sacroiliac</b> joint, either too much motion or too little motion.

50|$|<b>Sacroiliac</b> joint {{dysfunction}} {{is tested}} using provocative and nonprovocative maneuvers. Nonprovocative <b>sacroiliac</b> joint examination maneuvers would include Gillet Test, prone knee flexion test, supine long sitting test, standing flexion test, and seated flexion test. There {{is a lack}} of evidence that these <b>sacroiliac</b> joint mobility maneuvers detect motion abnormalities.|$|E
50|$|Perhaps {{the biggest}} reason for {{misdiagnosis}} or lack of diagnosis of <b>sacroiliac</b> joint dysfunction {{is based on the}} inability of common radiological imaging to discern the disorder. Diagnostic testing, such as X-ray, CT scan, or MRI, do not usually reveal abnormalities; therefore, they cannot reliably be used for diagnosis of <b>sacroiliac</b> joint dysfunction. There is a new definitive imaging test SPECT/CT which can sometimes detect <b>sacroiliac</b> joint dysfunction. There is also a lack of evidence that <b>sacroiliac</b> joint mobility maneuvers (Gillet, Standing flexion test, and Seated Flexion test) detect motion abnormalities. Given the inherent technical limitations of the visible and palpable signs from these <b>sacroiliac</b> joint mobility maneuvers another broad category of clinical signs have been described called provocative maneuvers.

50|$|The {{posterior}} <b>sacroiliac</b> (SI) ligaments can {{be further}} divided into short (intrinsic) and long (extrinsic). The dorsal interosseous ligaments are very strong ligaments. They are often stronger than bone, such that the pelvis may actually fracture before the ligament tears. The dorsal <b>sacroiliac</b> ligaments include both long and short ligaments. The long dorsal <b>sacroiliac</b> joint ligaments run in an oblique vertical direction while the short (interosseous) runs perpendicular from just behind the articular surfaces of the sacrum to the ilium and functions to keep the <b>sacroiliac</b> joint from distracting or opening. The sacrotuberous and sacrospinous ligaments (also known as the extrinsic <b>sacroiliac</b> joint ligaments) limit the amount the sacrum flexes.|$|E
50|$|Given the {{inherent}} technical {{limitations of the}} visible and palpable signs from these <b>sacroiliac</b> joint mobility maneuvers another broad category of clinical signs have been described called provocative maneuvers.

50|$|As we age the {{characteristics}} of the <b>sacroiliac</b> joint change. The joint's surfaces are flat or planar in early life but as we start walking, the <b>sacroiliac</b> joint surfaces develop distinct angular orientations and lose their planar or flat topography. They also develop an elevated ridge along the ilial surface and a depression along the sacral surface. The ridge and corresponding depression, along with the very strong ligaments, increase the <b>sacroiliac</b> joints' stability and makes dislocations very rare. The fossae lumbales laterales ("dimples of Venus") correspond to the superficial topography of the <b>sacroiliac</b> joints.|$|E
