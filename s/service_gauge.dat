A <b>service</b> user <b>gauges</b> <b>service</b> availability in terms of initial access time and subsequent service delivery time.

The paper utilises this quality of service framework to suggest the functional characteristics of a new transport layer software specification that would facilitate the increased availability of networked software services...|$|R
