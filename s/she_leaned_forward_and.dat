60|$|Laverick hesitating, <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> {{looked into}} his face.|$|E
60|$|She {{was silent}} for a moment. Then <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> touched the window.|$|E
60|$|Slowly <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> traced {{on the rug}} {{the figure}} of the Egg itself.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> {{suddenly}} <b>forward,</b> <b>and</b> {{struck him}} across the cheek.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> {{a little}} <b>and</b> {{buried her face}} in her hands.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> again, <b>and</b> {{begged for}} more flattery from {{him with her}} happy eyes. [...] "Why, what does make me so {{different}} from all the rest? I should really like to know." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> {{looked at}} him. Unwillingly {{he turned his}} head to meet her gaze.|$|E
60|$|Louise, for a moment, was startled. Then <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> {{kissed the}} eager, upturned face.|$|E
60|$|The Princess {{was only}} obeying a faint sign from Forrest. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> {{addressed}} her host.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Sabin was silent. Perhaps he was {{measuring}} {{his strength}} in some imagined encounter with this man. Something {{in his face}} alarmed Helene. <b>She</b> suddenly <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> looked at him more closely.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> {{a little}} <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> looked {{steadily}} into his eyes.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forwards</b> <b>and</b> upwards {{to pierce}} the darkness; he, also {{straining}} to look, felt her breath on his cheek, and turning, saw the pallor {{of her face}} close to his, and felt the dark glow of her eyes. He caught her in his arms, and held her mouth in a kiss. Then, when he released her, he turned away, saying something incoherent about going to fetch the lantern to look. She remained with her back towards me, and pretended to be feeling among the mistletoe for the berries. Soon I saw the swing of the hurricane lamp below.|$|R
60|$|Then {{what was}} surely a miracle happened. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> took his hand. Her eyes were soft with sympathy.|$|E
60|$|He {{tossed his}} arms to heaven, and stood a limp and shaken thing. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward,</b> <b>and</b> {{regarded}} him stricken in surprise.|$|E
60|$|They were nearing London. Far away {{on either}} side was an amphitheatre of lights. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> gazed thoughtfully out of the window.|$|E
60|$|Rochester, so apt of speech, seemed curiously tongue-tied. His fingers pressed hers. He made no answer. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> {{a little}} <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> {{looked into his}} face.|$|R
5000|$|The {{next day}} Ole {{is back at}} Anna's and tells her that her ex-husband is coming right now to {{retrieve}} Anders. Anna lets Ole in and shortly hears knocking on the door. Panicked that it is her ex-husband, Anna grabs a pair of scissors, which she stabbed Ole with, killing him just outside her door. Helge, who has just arrived, pounds on the door trying to get Anna to open it. Helge runs into the apartment, to see Anna sitting on the windowsill with Anders' arms wrapped around her. Just as he reaches Anna, <b>she</b> <b>leans</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> falls off the windowsill. Helge rushes down the building, sees Anna on the ground, but no Anders. When Helge asks Anna where Anders is, she isn't able to answer. Later Helge is told that Anna's husband killed Anders years ago, and {{that her husband had}} killed himself as well.|$|R
6000|$|It overcomes {{the poor}} woman; <b>she</b> <b>leans</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> breaks into sobbing,-- a tempest of sorrow, long suppressed, that shakes her weak frame as {{she thinks that}} her husband is out of work, desperate, discouraged, and tempted of the devil, that the rent is falling due, and only the poor pay of her needle to meet it with. In one of those quick flashes which {{concentrate}} through the imagination the sorrows of years, she seems to see her little home broken up, {{her husband in the}} gutter, her children turned into the street. At this moment there goes up from her heart a despairing cry, such as a poor, hunted, tired-out creature gives when brought to the last gasp of endurance. It was like the shriek of the hare when the hounds are upon it. She clasps her hands and cries out, [...] "O my God, help me." ...|$|R
60|$|Joan's slender long banner {{streaming}} backward had an accidentthe fringe {{caught fire}} from a torch. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> crushed the flame in her hand.|$|E
60|$|She took {{my face in}} {{her hands}} and looked into my eyes, saying no word. Then <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward,</b> <b>and</b> very gently touched my {{forehead}} with her lips.|$|E
60|$|I did {{not answer}} her. I could not. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> looked into my face, and {{instantly}} her tone changed. Her soft fingers clutched mine for a moment.|$|E
60|$|Ann and her {{officers}} {{were reluctant to}} undertake such a risky adventure, but Betsy at once grasped {{the value of the}} suggestion and began jumping up and down until she found herself bounding almost as high as Polychrome had done. Then <b>she</b> suddenly <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> the next bound took her easily across the brook, where she alighted {{by the side of the}} Rainbow's Daughter.|$|R
60|$|Aynesworth {{looked up}} and {{recognized}} Lady Ruth. She was fanning herself languidly, {{but her eyes were}} fixed upon the two men. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> a little <b>forward,</b> <b>and</b> her gesture was unmistakable.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am {{sure it is}} for us,' she repeated. A gladness {{came into}} her eyes. Still the cloud {{followed}} the train. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> to Siegmund <b>and</b> pointed out the cloud to him. She was very eager {{to give him a}} little of her faith.|$|R
6000|$|He {{remained}} so patiently quiet and still pointing that <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward,</b> <b>and,</b> following {{with her eyes}} {{the direction of his}} hand, saw that he was pointing to the sky! ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward,</b> <b>and</b> lightly {{caught it}} away from him, and made a feint of tearing it. He seized her hands. [...] "Mr. Hubbard!" [...] she cried, in undertone. [...] "Let me go, please." ...|$|E
60|$|She was {{watching}} {{him all the time}} with her dark, dilated, inchoate eyes. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> swung round her arm, catching him a light blow on the face {{with the back of her}} hand.|$|E
60|$|Adèle {{was seated}} so that I {{could see only}} her profile. I noticed, however, that {{she seemed to be}} eating little, and to be taking but a very small part in the conversation. Once or twice <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> back in her chair, and looked round the saloon as though in search of some one. On the last of these {{occasions}} our eyes met, and she smiled slightly. Mrs. Van Reinberg, who was sitting opposite to her, <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> asked some question. I judged that it concerned me, for immediately afterwards that lady herself raised her gold eyeglass, and favored me with a somewhat deliberate stare. Then <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> again <b>and</b> made some remark to Adèle, the purport of which I could not guess.|$|R
60|$|Elma let {{him take}} her hand, all trembling, in his. She let him call her by her name. <b>She</b> let him <b>lean</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> gaze at her, lover-like. Her heart throbbed high. She couldn't refuse him. She knew she loved him. But to marry him--oh no. That was quite another thing. There duty interposed. It would be cruel, unworthy, disgraceful, wicked.|$|R
60|$|Benicia {{was quite}} {{aware that he}} was not {{thinking}} chiefly of the danger of arrest, and again a little thrill that was no longer altogether one of dismay ran through her. He was, it seemed, afraid of sinking wholly under her influence. Again <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> a little <b>forward,</b> <b>and</b> laid her hand upon his arm.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] {{answered}} the girl softly, [...] "then {{you are not}} very angry with me." [...] <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> met his gaze. [...] "I think we were both very nearly making a terrible mistake." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was then}} that the tears came to Mrs. Merrill's eyes for {{there is a limit}} to all human endurance. The sight of these caused a {{remarkable}} change in Miss Lucretia, and <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> seized Mrs. Merrill's arm.|$|E
6000|$|... "Are {{you sure}} of that?" [...] asked Queen Cor, {{and by that}} time she was close beside Inga. Suddenly <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> threw both of her long arms around Inga's body, holding him in a grasp that was like a vise.|$|E
6000|$|... "I had {{scarcely}} noticed," [...] sighed Mrs. Pasmer; and Mrs. Brinkley {{knew that}} this was not true. [...] "Alice takes up all my thoughts," [...] she added; and this might be true enough. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> a little <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> asked, in a low, entreating voice over her fan, [...] "Mrs. Brinkley, have you seen Mr. Mavering lately?" ...|$|R
60|$|Grace {{felt that}} this was likely. She {{realized}} the purpose which animated him, and there suddenly came upon her a desire that he should tell it to her. She knew that he would do so when he felt the time was ripe; but she wished to hear it now, or, at least, to see how far his reticence would carry him. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> a little <b>and</b> looked him steadily in the eyes.|$|R
60|$|Mannering turned {{towards the}} house. His nerves were all {{tingling}} with excitement, but the thread had suddenly been snapped. He {{was no longer}} in danger of yielding to that flood of delicious sensations. His voice had been almost steady as he had begged Berenice to excuse him. Berenice stood quite still. Her hand was pressed to her side, her dark eyes were lit with passion. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> towards Borrowdean, <b>and</b> seemed about to strike him.|$|R
