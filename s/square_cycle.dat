A radio labelling for G is a function f that assigns to each vertex a non-negative integer (label) such that the in-equality jf(u) f(v) j d dG(u; v) + 1 holds for any two vertices u and v. The span of f is the dierence of the maximum and the minimum labels assigned. The radio number of G is the minimum span over all radio labellings of G. The radio numbers for paths and cycles were studied by Chartrand et. al. and Zhang, and were completely determined by Liu and Zhu.

40|$|Abstract: Metric {{dimension}} or location {{number is}} a generalization of affine dimension to arbitrary metric spaces (provided a resolving set exists). Let F {{be a family}} of connected graphs Gn: F = (Gn) n≥ 1 depending on n as follows: the order |V(G) | = ϕ(n) and lim n→ ∞ ϕ(n) =∞. If there exists a constant C> 0 such that dim(Gn) ≤ C for every n≥ 1 then we shall say that F has bounded metric dimension, otherwise F has unbounded metric dimension. If all graphs in F have the same metric dimension (which {{does not depend on}} n), F is called a family with constant metric dimension. In this paper, we study the metric dimension of quasi flower snarks, generalized antiprism and cartesian product of <b>square</b> <b>cycle</b> and path. We prove that these classes of graphs have constant or bounded metric dimension. It is natural to ask for characterization of graphs classes with respect to the nature of their metric dimension.

40|$|In this thesis, {{improved}} and faster CFD based aero-thermo-mechanical methods {{that can be}} used to optimize engine configurations early in the design process are described. Axisymmetric models of 3 D non-axisymmetric features such as protrusions, holes and honeycomb liners are developed for use in this context, and 3 D unsteady CFD is used to investigate the flow physics. Initially, the research focussed on modelling of a rotor-stator disc cavity. Steady CFD validations for a plane disc and for a disc with protrusion were carried out and a simplified body force model was developed for including the 3 D effects of rotating and stationary bolts into the axisymmetric CFD models. The simplified rotor bolt model was verified and validated by comparing the results with Sussex Windage rig test data and 3 D CFD data. The simplified stator bolt model was verified using 3 D CFD results. The simplified rotor bolt model was found to predict the drag and windage heat transfer with reasonable accuracy compared to 3 D sector CFD results. However, 3 D sector CFD under-predicts the high core flow swirl and the adiabatic disc surface temperature inboard of the bolt, compared to experimental data. In the second part of the study, unsteady Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) calculations of the rotating bolts cases were performed in order to better understand the flow physics. Although the rotor-stator cavity with bolts is geometrically steady in the rotating frame of reference, it was found that the rotor bolts generate unsteadiness which creates time-dependent rotating flow features within the cavity. A systematic parametric study is presented giving insight into the influence of the bolt number and the cavity geometric parameters on the time dependent flow within the cavity. The URANS calculations were extended to a high pressure turbine (HPT) rear cavity to show possible unsteady effects due to rotating bolts in an engine case. Following this, the body force model was adapted to model the rotating hole velocity changes and flow through honeycomb liners. The honeycomb and hole models were verified by comparing the results with available experimental data and 3 D CFD calculations. In the final part of the study, coupled FE-CFD calculations for a preliminary design whole engine thermo-mechanical (WETM) model for a transient <b>square</b> <b>cycle</b> was performed including the effects of non-axisymmetric features. Six cavities around the HPT disc were modelled using CFD. The coupled approach provides more realistic physical convective heat transfer boundary conditions than the traditional approach. The unvalidated baseline thermo-mechanical model results were verified using the high fidelity coupled FE-CFD solution. It was demonstrated that the FE-CFD coupled calculations with axisymmetric modelling of 3 D features can be achieved in a few days time scale suitable for preliminary engine design. The simplified CFD based methods described in this thesis could reduce the computational time of transient coupled FE-CFD calculations several orders of magnitude and may provide results as accurate as 2 DFE- 3 DCFD coupled calculations...|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} {{the problem of}} reliably broadcasting messages in a multi-hop network where nodes can fail in some unforeseen manner. We {{consider the}} most general failure model: the Byzantine model, where failing nodes may exhibit arbitrary behavior, and actively try to harm the network. Previous approaches dealing with permanent Byzantine failures limit either the number of Byzantine nodes or their density. In dense network, the density criterium is the allowed fraction of Byzantine neighbors per correct node. In sparse networks, density {{has been defined as}} the distance between Byzantine nodes. In this context, we first propose a new algorithm for networks whose communication graph can be decomposed into cycles: e. g., a torus can be decomposed into <b>square</b> <b>cycles,</b> a planar graph into polygonal cycles, etc. Our algorithm ensures reliable broadcast when the distance between permanent Byzantine failures is greater than twice the diameter of the largest cycle of the decomposition. Then, we refine the first protocol to make it Byzantine fault tolerant for transient faults (in addition to permanent Byzantine faults). This additional property is guaranteed by means of self-stabilization, which permits to recover from any arbitrary initial state. This arbitrary initial state {{can be seen as the}} result of every node being Byzantine faulty for a short period of time (hence the transient qualification). This second protocol thus tolerates permanent (constrained by density) and transient (unconstrained) Byzantine failures. When the maximum degree and cycle diameter are both bounded, both solutions perform in a time that remains proportional to the network diameter...|$|R
