50|$|It was not {{surprising}} that numerous nationalized enterprises experienced severe operating and financial difficulties. State operations faced considerable uncertainty as to the goals of public enterprises, with negative implications for decision making, often at odds with market criteria. In many instances, managers of public firms were less able than their private-sector counterparts to resist strong wage demands from militant unions. Further, public firm managers were required for <b>political</b> <b>expediency</b> <b>to</b> maintain a redundant labor force and freeze prices or utility rates for long periods {{in the face of}} rising costs. Overstaffing was particularly flagrant at Petrogal, the national petroleum monopoly, and Estaleiros Navais de Setúbal (Setenave), the wholly state-owned shipbuilding and repairing enterprise. The failure of the public transportation firms to raise fares during a time of accelerating inflation resulted in substantial operating losses and obsolescence of the sector's capital stock.|$|R

Parnell was a close friend and political associate of fellow land reform activist Thomas Nulty, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Meath, until Parnell's divorce crisis in 1889. Charles Parnell was linked both with the landed aristocracy class and the Irish Republican Brotherhood, with speculation in the 1890s that he may have even joined the latter organisation. The historian Andrew Roberts argues that he was sworn into the IRB in the Old Library at Trinity College Dublin in May 1882 and that this was concealed for 40 years. In Barry O'Brien's Parnell, X, Fenian Parliamentarian John O'Connor Power, relates, 'And, in fact, I was, about this time , deputed to ask Parnell to join us. I did ask him. He said [...] "No" [...] without a moment's hesitation.' He was conservative by nature, leading some historians to suggest that personally he would have been closer to the Conservative rather than to the Liberal Party, but for political needs. Andrew Kettle, Parnell's right-hand man, who shared a lot of his opinions, wrote of his own views, [...] "I confess that I felt , and still feel, a greater leaning towards the British Tory party than I ever could have towards the so-called Liberals." [...] In later years, the double effect of the Phoenix Park trauma and the O'Shea affair reinforced the conservative side of his nature.|$|R

40|$|Jewish Americans {{have been}} {{incredibly}} adept in public relations, and this study traces {{the ways in}} which Jewish narratives were used in the twentieth century to perform cultural work for the community. We Are Chosen begins with the premise that established Jews in Galveston, Montreal, New York, and Buenos Aires defined Jewishness in attractive terms in the early 1900 s for <b>political</b> <b>expediency,</b> <b>to</b> challenge negative perceptions by non-Jews and promote esteem among Jews, and that these terms continue to inform conceptions of Jewish identity. Geographically, the project looks beyond (as well as in) New York, focuses on three dominant tropes (giving, mobility, and assimilation), and examines how and why these themes effectively translate religious election ("chosenness") in the secular sphere. Jewish narratives and their ennobling rhetorics are often taken as a matter of course, even in the field of Jewish American Studies, but should be understood as products of a particular historical moment. As vehicles for positive public relations, Jewish narratives mask voices deemed unattractive or potentially threatening. Drawing from essays, organizational reports, periodical and historical writings, and works of Jewish American literature, individual chapters put dominant and protesting voices in conversation with one another and explore why some images are deemed "good for the Jews" and others are considered self-hating. Examining the history of Jews in other places does not detract from the importance of New York to Jewish American history or memory, but insists that there are more complex and dynamic stories that include, but are not limited to, New York and its mythic Lower East Side.

40|$|This paper {{highlights}} how {{the contrasting}} founding principles {{of local government}} in Germany and England has affected the capacity of municipalities in both countries since 1800. Drawing on detailed interviews with practitioners in the ‘twin towns’ of Newcastle and Gelsenkirchen, as well as academic literature discussing the history of local governance in the two countries, it takes a historical institutionalist perspective (March and Olsen 1989; Pierson 2000) {{to show how the}} reasons why modern local authorities were created have shaped their future activities and capacity. For example, the British Government established municipalities in England for reasons of <b>political</b> <b>expediency</b> (primarily <b>to</b> deal with the public health crisis caused by the Industrial Revolution), whereas their German counterparts were set up to provide a means of civic representation and foster local pride. The result is that English local authorities have generally acted as functional agents that deliver services on behalf of central government, whilst German councils are more readily viewed as the democratic embodiment of local communities. This perception, combined with the legal and resource parameters within which they operate, has meant that English local authorities have significantly less institutional capacity than their German counterparts – and therefore they usually require external support to address a particular public policy issue effectively. In contrast, German municipalities are much more able to exert hierarchical authority and shape their communities directly...|$|R

Polls showed a majority of Americans disapproved of the pardon, and Ford's public-approval ratings tumbled afterward. Other controversial uses of the pardon power include Andrew Johnson's sweeping pardons of thousands of former Confederate officials and military personnel after the American Civil War, Jimmy Carter's grant of amnesty to Vietnam-era draft dodgers, George H.

40|$|Global {{initiatives}} {{to reduce emissions}} can be categorised as either regulatory measures or measures that seek to place a price on carbon. Most jurisdictions employ {{a combination of the}} two with pricing measures generally preferred by economists. Where carbon is priced this is typically achieved by imposing a carbon tax and/or an emissions trading scheme ("ETS"). Australia introduced a nationwide ETS from 1 July 2012 with California (and Quebec) following suit from 1 January 2103. The Australian ETS was set to link with that of the European Union from 1 July 2014 and linage with New Zealand was also being explored. Meanwhile California and Quebec linked 6 months earlier. The first tentative steps towards a truly global ETS seemed to be underway. However <b>political</b> <b>expediency</b> was <b>to</b> see the Australian Opposition rally against the ETS and with its subsequent election to government repeal the regime. The prime mechanism to achieve Australia's emissions reductions commitment is now an emissions reduction fund ("ERF"). Under this scheme the government holds "reverse auctions" whereby the cheapest emissions reduction proposals put to it by industry are funded. Under a "safeguard" measure large emitters are to remain subject to emissions caps with default (possibly) leading to fines where credits cannot be sourced elsewhere. Thus carbon pricing and (limited) trading will still feature under the revised Australian regime. The circumstances leading to the implementation and then demise of the Australian ETS and its replacement with the ERS are explored in this paper. Both the former ETS and ERS will be compared and contrasted with the Californian ETS. It will be observed that a myopic focus on domestic emissions plagues the effectiveness of both the Californian and Australian regimes. Whilst <b>political</b> <b>expediency</b> and, possibly, environmental integrity concerns might motivate this dislike of foreign credits one effect is that emissions reductions are likely to come at a much higher cost and continue to impede the operation of the clean development mechanism, the Kyoto mechanism aimed at reducing the ever expanding developing world emissions. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to describe variations in the different models of out of hours general medical services and identify explanations for variation and the possible influence on patient satisfaction and service costs. A cross-sectional survey of all models of out of hours care was undertaken, including co-operatives, deputizing services, practice rotas and rural general practitioners doing their own cover. Fifteen sites were chosen representing 10 models of care, for more detailed case study; 65 semistructured interviews with key informants were conducted within the case study sites. A postal patient satisfaction questionnaire and an economic analysis were also carried out. Out of hours organizations have developed in response to a complex mix of the population served, geography, resources available and <b>political</b> <b>expediency,</b> leading <b>to</b> considerable structural heterogeneity, even within co-operatives. There was little evidence of formal integration with other services. Only the largest co-operatives showed any evidence of utilizing guidelines/protocols or of providing formal staff training. There were clear differences in the structure of out of hours care in urban and rural areas. Increasing the use of centralized call handling and triage will not address the needs of rural GPs, who would still be required to be available for work. Neither patient satisfaction nor costs varied by model of service provision. The English out of hours review has outlined an integrated model of service provision with consistent standards within an accountability framework. It would appear that only the largest organizations will be in a position to address these standards and that they are likely to be inappropriate to the needs of GPs in rural areas...|$|R

The term has been controversial given its symbolic power, related to the Portuguese language as the vernacular of the colonizer.
