40|$|The major {{difficulty}} in using clusters of galaxies to determine cosmological parame-ters is the conversionbetween their observed and theoretical physical properties. Thus, {{an understanding of}} the physics of clusters of galaxies and modeling them out to dis-tances as far as the intra-cluster gas extends is of crucial importance. This task can not be done using observations today since we can not observe the intra-cluster gas out to the virial shock around clusters. Therefore we have been using a <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> <b>clusters</b> of galaxies drawn from high resolution cosmological N-body-hydro simulations to derive large scale models for the intra-cluster gas. We are planning to compare our models to observations of the intra-cluster gas out to large radii using AMiBA observations. We present our preliminary intra-cluster gas models and briefly discuss their impact on determining cosmological parameters using the SZX-ray method and an XXL type <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> <b>clusters</b> of galaxies. 1.

We use four metrics to identify cool-core clusters: (1) the concentration parameter, which is {{the ratio of the}} integrated emissivity profile within 0. 15 r (500) to that within r (500), (2) the ratio of the integrated emissivity profile within 40 kpc to that within 400 kpc, (3) the cuspiness of the gas density profile, which is the negative of the logarithmic derivative of the gas density with respect to the radius, measured at 0. 04 r (500), and (4) the central gas density, measured at 0. 01 r (500).

40|$|The {{temperature}} of X-ray emitting gas TX {{is often used}} to infer the total mass of galaxy clusters (under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium). Unfortunately, XMM-Newton and Chandra observatories measure inconsistent temperatures for the same gas, due to uncertain instrumental calibration. We translate the relative bias in temperature measurements of Schellenberger et al. (2014) into a bias on inferred mass for a <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> <b>clusters</b> with homogeneous weak lensing (WL) masses, in order to simultaneously examine the hydrostatic bias and instrument calibration. Israel et al. (2014) found consistent WL and Chandra hydrostatic X-ray masses for a <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> <b>clusters</b> at z∼ 0. 5 and masses of a few 1014 M. Re-evaluating the latter, we find their XMM-Newton masses to be lower by bxcal = 15 – 20 % than their Chandra masses. At the massive end (& 5 · 1014 M), the XMM-Newton masses are ∼ 35 % lower than the WL masses. Assuming that the true hydrostatic bias is 20 %, as indicated by simula-tions, our results for the massive end indicate that Chandra’s calibration of the energy dependence of the effective area is more accurate than XMM-Newton’s.

40|$|Using PSPC Rosat data, {{we measure}} x-ray surface {{brightness}} profiles, size and luminosity of the Butcher-Oemler (BO) <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> <b>clusters</b> of galaxies. The cluster x-ray size, {{as measured by}} the Petrosian r_η= 2 radius, does not change with redshift and is independent from x-ray luminosity. On the other hand, the x-ray luminosity increases with redshift. Considering that fair samples show no-evolution, or negative luminosity evolution, we conclude that the BO sample is not formed from the same class of objects observed at different look-back times. This is in conflict with the usual interpretation of the Butcher-Oemler as an evolutionary (or redshift-dependent) effect, {{based on the assumption that}} we are comparing the same class of objects at different redshifts. Other trends present in the BO sample reflect selection criteria rather than differences in look-back time, as independently confirmed by the fact that trends loose strength when we enlarge the sample with x-ray selected <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> <b>clusters.</b> The variety of optical sizes and shapes of the clusters in the Butcher-Oemler sample, and the Malmquist-like bias, are the reasons for these selection effects that mimic the trends usually interpreted as changes due to evolution.

40|$|We {{present results}} of age {{determination}} {{based on the}} standard procedure of isochrone fitting for about 600 star clusters younger than about 1. 2 Gyr from the central parts of the LMC. Comparison of age distributions of star clusters from the LMC and the SMC shows that cluster formation histories are different in these galaxies. The age distribution of the LMC clusters reveals bursty nature of cluster formation in this galaxy, with contrast to the relatively uniform distribution of cluster ages in the SMC. We detected three extended peaks {{in the distribution of}} ages of LMC clusters, located at about 7 Myr, 125 Myr and 0. 8 Gyr. All detected peaks have complex structure. While the structure of the youngest and the oldest peaks may be spurious due to accuracy of age determination, in the middle peak two evident sub-peaks at 100 Myr and 160 Myr are clearly seen. Similar peaks are seen in the distribution of ages of clusters from the SMC, which indicates that increased cluster formation ratio during these periods might be caused by the last encounter between the Magellanic Clouds.
