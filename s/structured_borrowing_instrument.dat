40|$|The {{overall goal}} of this project {{is to make the}} {{management}} {{of a large number of}} instruments easy at the Halmstad University workshop. An increase in the number of items borrowed needs to be managed. A lab instruments management system is developed and applied to manage the tools and instruments. The focus of the software is on managing information on <b>borrowed</b> <b>instruments.</b> The methods used come from the field of Java web application and include the methods object oriented programming, MySQL database, three-tier architecture and model-view-controller design pattern. The development of the management system is based on four features. Two features are maintenance of basic information of borrowers and instruments. The results showed that administrators can add, modify, delete, and query information of borrowers and instruments through web pages. The third feature is to <b>borrow</b> <b>instruments,</b> return instruments and to extend borrowing time. The last feature is to show statistics. The management system of instruments provides a multi-user platform for allowing the administrators to maintain user information and instrument information and helps the borrower to borrow, return and extend borrowing time. Simple statistical functions are implemented...|$|R

50|$|Initially {{the members}} of the group played on <b>borrowed</b> <b>instruments.</b> One of the major {{problems}} of these instruments was trying to keep them in tune as many had wooden tuning pegs which were not reliable and were difficult to finely tune the instrument. Initially they performed part of their concerts without bandura accompaniment, sometimes accompanied by the piano. The only member of the Capella who had prior experience with the bandura was Danylo Pika who had taken some bandura lessons from Opanas Slastion.|$|R

In this paper we explore how institutional rigidities such as credit constraint impinge on demand for health insurance and how insurance could potentially prevent poor households from fallinginto poverty trap.

40|$|Complex {{mortgages}} {{became a}} popular <b>borrowing</b> <b>instrument</b> during the bullish housing market {{of the early}} 2000 s but vanished rapidly during the subsequent downturn. These non-traditional loans (interest only, negative amortization, and teaser mortgages) enable households to postpone loan repayment compared to traditional mortgages and hence relax borrowing constraints. At the same time, they increase household leverage and heighten dependence on mortgage refinancing to escape changes in contract terms. We document that complex mortgages were chosen by prime borrowers with high income levels seeking to purchase expensive houses relative to their incomes. Borrowers with complex mortgages experience substantially higher ex post default rates than borrowers with traditional mortgages with similar characteristics. Mortgages; Mortgage loans...|$|R

50|$|Born in Washington D.C. to an American {{father and}} a {{holocaust}} survivor mother who arrived in the US from Galicia in 1929, Farber’s first seven years of school at the Hebrew Academy of Washington (now called the Melvin J. Berman Hebrew Academy) were extremely difficult, as undiagnosed dyslexia prevented him from dealing with the two alphabets simultaneously. A self-taught clarinet player, Farber was asked to play the contrabass upon entering {{the public school system}} at 14. A single lesson from the orchestra’s conductor sufficed for Farber to continue on his own and play the bass in his high school big-band, and bass clarinet and contrabass in its orchestra. Having <b>borrowed</b> <b>instruments</b> from the school’s band, Farber taught himself saxophone, baritone horn, and other instruments. At 14 he also wrote his first compositions—more than a dozen songs in the style of folk songs (text and music now lost).|$|R

It complements the 2001 paper by Haliassos et al. The findings are of interest to policy makers, as they show the extent of household participation in various loans and the indebtedness of various demographic groups. We document the considerable popularity of credit cards as <b>borrowing</b> <b>instruments</b> and a continuing parallel presence of antiquated forms of borrowing. There is surprisingly limited use by the young of mortgages, despite very high home ownership rates, and of car loans, despite high car ownership rates. We find evidence of a strong reliance on family transfers for the financing of higher education, home acquisitions and car purchases by the young. Finally, we note a tendency for Cypriot entrepreneurs to take out large loans from their business for personal use. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{computer}} graphics, global illumination algorithms such as photon mapping require {{to gather}} {{large volumes of}} data which can be heavily redundant. We propose both a new characterization of useful data and a new optimization method for the photon mapping algorithm using <b>structures</b> <b>borrowed</b> from Artificial Intelligence such as autonomous agents. Our autonomous lighting agents efficiently gather large amounts of useful data and are used to make decisions during rendering. It induces less photons being cast and shorter rendering times in both photon casting and rendering phase of the photon mapping algorithm which leads to an important decrease of memory occupation and slightly shorter rendering times for equal image quality. ...|$|R

Sub-carrier sensing, i. e., sensing every OFDM subcarrier to see if it is occupied or not, is proposed to replace the conventional carrier sensing multiple access (CSMA) for multi-user contention of a channel. This <b>structure,</b> <b>borrowed</b> from cognitive radio, allows multiple users to opportunistically share the same channel on different subcarriers and therefore increases the channel capacity. Two subcarrier sensing methods are proposed: one is based on information theory and the other is based on successive energy comparison. Simulations are provided to verify the methods. I...|$|R
