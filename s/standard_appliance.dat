5000|$|In recent years, {{a variety}} of types of {{practice}} pads {{have been designed to}} assist percussionists. These implements may commonly include the use of both an actual disk of mylar or similar element (equivalent to material used in the construction of true drumheads). This typically is stretched over an underlying buffer, affixed by way of a rim of metal or plastic to an underlying rigid surface to approximate the stretch and reflection similar to that a true drumhead when struck, such as REMO's RT series drum practice pad (featured). Many more modern devices utilize a thin layer of elastomer, such as natural gum rubber or synthetic rubber equivalent consisting of various densities as a playing surface. This type of rubber surface, (having become a significantly <b>standard</b> <b>appliance</b> when fabricating most modern practice drum pads), is either placed directly over the top of an existing drumhead in some form, or adhered onto the top of a dense and flat substrate (usually wood) allowing for the material to reflect a drumstick or mallet after being struck, which generally bears a response and “feel” to the players that {{is similar to that of}} a true drumhead.|$|E
40|$|The {{edgewise}} appliance, born in {{the mind}} of Dr. Edward Angle and first introduced on June 2, 1925, has withstood the test of almost a century of time and usage. The 022 <b>standard</b> <b>appliance</b> that Angle described in a series of four articles in Dental Cosmos is being used by many orthodontic clinicians in fundamentally the same form as it was presented in 1928 and 1929 in Dental Cosmos. Yes, it has been modified in innumerable ways. However, to use one of the modifications, the clinician must understand and respect the fundamentals of its use. This treatise describes the appliance′s evolution from Angle to its use today. The force system of today is simpler and more refined than what Angle envisioned but the appliance is "intact. " It is as modern as tomorrow {{and will continue to be}} used as long as the specialty exists. It was Angle′s greatest contribution...|$|E
40|$|Ever {{since the}} {{introduction}} of fixed appliance, a constant search is in progress to develop an appliance which can effectively control the anterior teeth during orthodontic treatment. As {{it is difficult to}} meet the requisites of all cases with a <b>standard</b> <b>appliance,</b> several biomechanical principles are being thought of, to overcome the difficulties. Controlling the torque is one of the toughest challenges a clinician faces during lingual sliding mechanics. The challenge posed may be attributed to the moment generated in the maxillary anterior teeth during lingual retraction, considering the biomechanical correlation between the center of resistance of maxillary anterior teeth and the resultant retraction force vector in lingual orthodontics. There are several ways to counteract the torque loss {{and at the same time}} effectively retract the maxillary anterior teeth. This can be achieved either by customizing the lingual bracket base or biomechanically by optimizing the retraction force vector. This article is an effort to emphasize the role of lever arms in optimizing retraction mechanics and torque control in lingual sliding mechanics...|$|E

40|$|Network {{communication}} {{is a fact}} of life for computer users today; working off-line has become almost inconceivable. The Internet pervades our daily life both at home and at work. Of course, the ubiquity of network communication has brought with it correspondingly prevalent threats in the form of viruses, spam, intruders and phishing: the list goes on and on. Whereas it was previously considered sufficient to install a viruschecker on your desktop to consider yourself secure, many businesses today require a multi-layered approach. By providing security checks at both the network gateway and on individual workstations, the risk of a successful attack is much lower. This has led to a huge market for security appliances; a study by IDC research predicted that, by 2007, 80 % of all network security solutions will be delivered via a dedicated appliance. 1 To be effective such devices now have to protect against more and more types of threats. The <b>standard</b> <b>appliance</b> in 2000 delivered primarily firewall and virtual private network (VPN) functions; classifying traffic according to its 5 -tuple was considered sufficient for most purposes at the time.

We review literature {{on a broad}} range of existing non-transportation energy efficiency policies covering <b>appliance</b> <b>standards,</b> financial incentives, information and voluntary programs, and government energy use (building and professional codes are not included). Estimates indicate these programs are likely to have collectively saved up to 4 quads of energy annually, with <b>appliance</b> <b>standards</b> and utility demand-side management likely making up at least half these savings. Energy Star, Climate Challenge, and 1605 b voluntary emissions reductions may also contribute significantly to aggregate energy savings, but how much of these savings would have occurred absent these programs is less clear.
