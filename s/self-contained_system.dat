40|$|In {{the article}} was carried out an attempt of {{applying}} the cybernetic theory of <b>self-contained</b> and self-controllable <b>systems</b> {{to an analysis of}} methods of administration of the socialistic enterprises. The enterprises administered in an unparametrical way with high intensity of incidental directives are compared with self-controllable systems. On the other hand the enterprises administered in the parametrical way using additionally the unparametrical administration, but not directive, were compared with <b>self-contained</b> <b>systems.</b> At the basis of reaction of such systems to the signals received from the surroundings, there was represented and analysed the way of taking up the decision by the enterprises in the conditions of centralization and decentralization. As the practical examples there were brought the methods of administration of the managements of the state railways and the enterprise of inland navigation. In consequence of consideration there was acknowledged the superiority of the <b>self-contained</b> <b>systems</b> above the self-controllable ones, depending mainly on the possibility of much quicker reaction to the changing conditions of economy, thanks to the ability of carrying through verification of the decisions taken by an enterprise. The analysis resulted consequently in a number of postulates addressed to the directions of farther perfection of the system of administration: 1. the enlarging of independence of the enterprise in the time of forming the plan by means of enlarging the existing horizontal connections; 2. the application to a greater extend the parametrical system instead of the directives; 3. carrying of the estimation of enterprises at the basis of one synthetic standard, coupled at the same time with the system of activation and supplying; 4. application of the only incentives that are not contradictory in action; 5. enlarging the scope of self-financing of the socialistic enterprisesDigitalizacja i deponowanie archiwalnych zeszytów RPEiS sfinansowane przez MNiSW w ramach realizacji umowy nr 541 /P-DUN/ 201...|$|R
