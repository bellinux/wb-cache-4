40|$|Reservoir {{and lake}} {{sedimentation}} {{is a vital}} problem in Ethiopia. Constructing small and medium size dams at the outlets of sub-catchments within larger catchment helps to reduce the transport of sediment downstream to reservoirs or lakes. This study assessed the sediment trapping efficacy (STE) of <b>sediment</b> <b>storage</b> <b>dams</b> (SSDs) built at the outlets of eight small sub-catchments in northwest Ethiopia, as an off-site sediment trapping measure. Satellite imagery and topographic maps {{were used to assess}} land use/land cover and delineate the boundaries of sub-catchments. In the field, trapped sediment by SSDs was measured directly, as well as in- and outflow of suspended sediment with which the STE of each SSD was estimated. Sediment yield of each sub-catchment was calculated from the measured trapped sediment and estimated suspended sediment loss. Results show that SSDs trapped an average of 1584 t yr- 1 of the inflow sediment and catchment specific sediment yield ranged from 8. 6 - 55 t ha- 1 yr- 1. Two representative SSDs constructed from gabion and stone were evaluated with regard to their STE. Results showed that their efficacy was 74 % and 67 % for the gabion and stone SSD, respectively. In general, although SSDs might be costly for small scale farmers and have a relatively short life span depending on their size, they are promising off-site structural measures to trap significant amounts of sediment at the outlets of sub-catchments and subsequently reducing sediment movement to downstream water bodies. <br/...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: To date, {{little work}} has {{attempted}} to link dam sedimentation with the growing problem of coastal erosion, {{particularly with respect to}} small dams on comparatively small rivers. This paper reviews past work linking coastal erosion to river sediment regimes and evaluates potential linkages between small reservoir sedimentation and coastal erosion processes in Connecticut through a case study analysis of five dams. Though Connecticut’s coastline is not eroding as rapidly as in some others regions, coastal erosion problems in the state have been identified. By developing a methodology to estimate <b>sediment</b> <b>storage</b> behind small <b>dams,</b> we provide a mechanism by which to quantitatively evaluate the potential contribution of river sediment entrapment to coastal erosion in Connecticut. Results indicate that the ~ 4, 000 dams in Connecticut are storing a substantial amount of sediment and potentially significantly contributing to coastal erosion...|$|R
40|$|Sediment flux from hillslopes to {{channels}} commonly increases following wildfires, with {{implications for}} the carbon cycle, river habitats, and debris-flow hazards. Although much of this material is transported via dry ravel, existing ravel models are not applicable to hillslopes with gradients greater than the angle of repose, which can constitute the majority of mountainous terrain. To fill this knowledge gap, we develop a continuity model for <b>sediment</b> <b>storage</b> by vegetation <b>dams</b> on steep hillslopes to predict sediment yields following wildfire. The maximum volume of sediment stored prior to wildfire is set to {{be a function of}} vegetation density, the capacity of plants to impound sediment, and the contributing hillslope area. Time is required after fire to establish vegetation and replenish hillslope <b>sediment</b> <b>storage,</b> which introduces vegetation regrowth rate, soil production rate, and fire recurrence interval as important variables that affect ravel yield. Model results for the San Gabriel Mountains, California, predict that sediment yield can increase by several orders of magnitude following fire. These results are consistent with field data of ravel yield (~ 30 mm per contributing area of hillslope in 5 months) we collected following the 2009 Station Fire, as well as postfire sediment flux recorded by 93 debris basins. In contrast to previous work, our model shows that heightened postfire sediment yields can be explained by a change in hillslope <b>sediment</b> <b>storage</b> independent of major changes in the soil production rate and landscape form over geomorphic timescales...|$|R

40|$|Since the 1990 th Sasol, a local Non-Governmental-Organization (NGO), builds sand <b>storage</b> <b>dams,</b> to {{mitigate}} the consequences of droughts in the semi-arid county of Kitui, Kenya. Sand <b>storage</b> <b>dams</b> are dams constructed in ephemeral rivers which increase the storage capacity of the riverbeds. The water stored by sand <b>storage</b> <b>dams</b> enables local people to generate income through irrigated agriculture and brick making. By exploiting the stored water people also influence the groundwater flows and tables through water extraction and evapotranspiration, runoff and infiltration through the cultivation of land. This two way feedback between society and water system is further influenced by local circumstances like water quality, slopes and local initiatives. In this study the long term effects of sand <b>storage</b> <b>dams</b> on hydrology and water use were assessed in the Kiindu catchment near Kitui town. It combines observed human agency and simulated effects of sand <b>storage</b> <b>dams</b> on groundwater levels to depicture what is called in socio-hydrology the coevolution of society and water system after the construction of sans <b>storage</b> <b>dams.</b> During a fieldtrip the study area, the local circumstances and the exploitation of water sources were assessed by means of trans-sectional walks and semi-structured interviews. The results show the interaction of local circumstances, society and water system led to different local developments even in a small catchment like the Kiindu catchment. How water is extracted and used depends on catchment properties. If the riverbanks are broad and lots {{of water from the}} riverbed can be extracted like in the downstream of the study area, people do irrigated agriculture on the riverbanks. But in such areas it is hard to find locations where sand dams can be founded on rock. Therefore sand dams are endangered by erosion of the riverbanks. In areas with steeper slopes and narrow and thin riverbeds, irrigated agriculture cannot be applied in the vicinity. Here people need to invest in equipment to utilize the water stored by the sand dams. But in these areas there are more locations where sand dams can be founded on rocks. Therefore the sand dams are more robust. Other factors that influence the utilization of water from the catchment are water quality and the availability of alternative water sources. To investigate how the effects of the sand <b>storage</b> <b>dams</b> on the groundwater tables may influence the availability of water and therefore the water use, a groundwater model was developed. With the ‘pmwin’ groundwater model, which is based on the finite-difference groundwater model MODFLOW, the influence of local catchment properties on the performance of the sand dams were assessed and changes in flow directions around sand dams analysed. The simulations show that the slopes of the stream and the thickness of the riverbed {{have a major impact on}} the amount of water stored by the sand dams. Because the sand dams which store the largest amount of water lie in the area where most of the irrigated fields are located, the modelling results give a possible explanation for the observed development. The study shows that the sand dams in general lead to larger amounts of water available in the catchment. Therefore they improve living conditions of the local communities. However the effects of the sand dams differ between the areas. In some areas they only help the communities to satisfy their domestic water demand, while in other areas people have sufficient water to generate income through irrigated agriculture. But sand <b>storage</b> <b>dams</b> may also fail and their effect abate afterwards. Thus the study shows that there is not ‘The Effect’ of the sand <b>storage</b> <b>dams</b> on the development of a catchment. To understand why sand <b>storage</b> <b>dams</b> have a certain effect it is important to take the local circumstances into account by assessing their effects. One should also be cautious and choose a flexible implementation and operation approach that takes the local circumstances into account if the experience with sand <b>storage</b> <b>dams</b> is transferred from one area to another. Finally, if there is not ‘The Effect’ of sand <b>storage</b> <b>dams,</b> how do developments of catchments look like after the construction of sand <b>storage</b> <b>dams?</b> Based on the information obtained in the field, hypothetical socio-hydrological narratives for small sub areas in catchment, which need to be proved in further research, are formulated to show how these sub-catchments may have developed.

40|$|<b>Sediment</b> <b>storage</b> is an often-neglected term in {{sediment}} budgets, {{despite being}} the crucial link between rates of erosion and sediment yield. Mountain belts in particular host large valley fills that modulate fluxes {{of water and}} sediment, buffer the geomorphic coupling between hillslopes and river channels, reduce local valley relief, and protect bedrock from fluvial incision. Here we propose a region-growing algorithm based on a slope-gradient criterion to automatically extract areas of postglacial fluvial and lacustrine valley fills from digital topography at the mountain-belt scale. Applying this method to the European Alps, {{we find that the}} size-frequency relationship of 17, 766 individual <b>sediment</b> <b>storage</b> units, expressed by either area or volume, follows a power law over four and five orders of magnitude with scaling exponents – 1. 77 and – 1. 71, respectively. We show that 90 % of the area covered by <b>sediment</b> <b>storage</b> is in the lower quartile of the mountain belt's elevation and below the median local relief. On average, low-gradient valley fill occupies 6 % of the studied drainage basins. This fraction increases with basin size, likely reflecting the larger accommodation space of trunk valleys generated by multiple glacial-interglacial cycles.

To understand sediment budgets in the Tana River,we investigated <b>sediment</b> <b>storage</b> along a 380 kmfloodplain reach (Garissa-Garsen) {{in the lower}} Tana River (Kenya), {{using a combination of}} approaches: (i) measurements of sediment deposition after an important flood event and, (ii) quantification of <b>sediment</b> <b>storage</b> using fallout radionuclide activities (137 Cs and 210 Pbex). Event-based sediment deposition ranged between 2 - 15 mm vertical accretion, corresponding to an average of 0. 58 ± 0. 42 g cm- 2 (dry weight). Average annual <b>sediment</b> <b>storage</b> based on fallout radionuclide activities were at a 50 yr mean of 1. 15 - 1. 21 g cm- 2 yr- 1 and a 100 yr mean of 1. 01 g cm- 2 yr- 1 (using 137 Cs and 210 Pbex, respectively). Sediment deposition rates were mainly dependent on distance relative to the main river, flood height and microtopography. The deposited sediments originated from various sources including deeply mobilized, radionuclide-poor sediments. Shallow overbank deposits (b 2 m depth), dominated by silty-clay sediment fractions were observed in most depositional areas. Floodplain sediment stocks are controlled by annual overbank flooding, with a 73 yr flooding frequency of 1. 05 flood yr- 1. On average ca. 1 - 2 Mt (15 - 30 %) of the river sediment load is deposited in the Garissa-Garsen floodplain reach.

40|$|<b>Sediment</b> <b>storage</b> in {{floodplains}} {{is one of}} the {{key components}} of a catchments sediment budget. We calculated the total mass of Holocene alluvial <b>sediment</b> <b>storage</b> for three medium-sized Belgian river catchments (360 - 1080 km 2) that are characterized by contrasting environmental conditions. Topography is most pronounced in the Amblève catchment and least in the Dijle catchment. The Dijle and Geul catchment have a comparable and rather intense land use history, with intensive agriculture starting in Roman times. On the other hand, land use within the Amblève catchment is less intensive and developed more recently. In total 1070 hand augerings, spread over 96 cross sections, were made to quantify the fluvial deposition. Average sediment deposition masses per unit floodplain area were calculated for each cross section. These data were extrapolated to estimate the average floodplain deposition of the different catchments at different spatial scales. The results show a large variation in alluvial <b>sediment</b> <b>storage</b> between the catchments. <b>Sediment</b> <b>storage</b> within the floodplains is much higher for the Dijle catchment (4. 6 Mg ha− 1 catchment area) compared to the Geul (1. 3 Mg ha− 1) and Amblève catchment (0. 2 Mg ha− 1). Comparison with data from other West-European catchments shows that the alluvial <b>sediment</b> <b>storage</b> within the Dijle catchment is rather high, while it is very low for the Amblève. These differences between catchments can mainly be attributed to the differences in land use history. Land use plays a role in both soil erosion and sediment transport processes and thus has a major influence on the amount of sediment entering the fluvial system. Radiocarbon dating from the Dijle floodplains show that major changes in land use are responsible for changes in floodplain sedimentation rate. On the other hand, internal catchment variability in alluvial <b>sediment</b> <b>storage</b> for the Dijle catchment (2. 4 - 4. 8 Mg ha− 1 for various river reaches) can be explained by differences in catchment morphology. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Currently, the {{anthropogenic}} perturbation of the biogeochemical cycles remains unquantified due to {{the poor}} representation of lateral fluxes of carbon and nutrients in Earth system models (ESMs). This lateral transport of carbon and nutrients between terrestrial ecosystems is strongly affected by accelerated soil erosion rates. However, the quantification of global soil erosion by rainfall and runoff, and the resulting redistribution is missing. This study aims at developing new tools and methods to estimate global soil erosion and redistribution by presenting and evaluating a new large-scale coarse-resolution sediment budget model that is compatible with ESMs. This model can simulate spatial patterns and long-term trends of soil redistribution in floodplains and on hillslopes, resulting from external forces such as climate and land use change. We applied the model to the Rhine catchment using climate and land cover data from the Max Planck Institute Earth System Model (MPI-ESM) for the last millennium (here AD  850 – 2005). Validation is done using observed Holocene <b>sediment</b> <b>storage</b> data and observed scaling between <b>sediment</b> <b>storage</b> and catchment area. We find that the model reproduces the spatial distribution of floodplain <b>sediment</b> <b>storage</b> and the scaling behavior for floodplains and hillslopes as found in observations. After analyzing the dependence of the scaling behavior on the main parameters of the model, we argue that the scaling is an emergent feature of the model and mainly dependent on the underlying topography. Furthermore, we find that land use change is the main contributor to the change in <b>sediment</b> <b>storage</b> in the Rhine catchment during the last millennium. Land use change also explains most of the temporal variability in <b>sediment</b> <b>storage</b> in floodplains and on hillslopes...|$|R
