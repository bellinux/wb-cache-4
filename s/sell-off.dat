5|$|The Kinect, a motion-sensing {{input device}} made by Microsoft and {{designed}} as a video game controller, was first introduced in November 2010, and was upgraded for the 2013 release of the eighth-generation Xbox One video game console. Kinect's capabilities were revealed in May 2013. The new Kinect uses an ultra-wide 1080p camera, which can function in the dark due to an infrared sensor. It employs higher-end processing power and new software, can distinguish between fine movements (such as a thumb movements), and can determine a user's heart rate by looking at his/her face. Microsoft filed a patent application in 2011 that suggests that the corporation may use the Kinect camera system to monitor the behavior of television viewers {{as part of a}} plan to make the viewing experience more interactive. On July 19, 2013, Microsoft stocks suffered its biggest one-day percentage <b>sell-off</b> since the year 2000 after its fourth-quarter report raised concerns among the investors on the poor showings of both Windows 8 and the Surface tablet; with more than 11 percentage points declining Microsoft suffered a loss of more than US$32 billion. For the 2010 fiscal year, Microsoft had five product divisions: Windows Division, Server and Tools, Online Services Division, Microsoft Business Division and Entertainment and Devices Division.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} the stock market performance implications of joint venture (JV) partner <b>sell-offs</b> using a resource-based view and an event study methodology. More specifically, it proposes hypotheses putting into evidence the stock market valuation of different reasons for JV <b>sell-offs</b> (refocusing of a business, debt reduction, and JV failure). Abnormal returns (ARs) from JV <b>sell-offs</b> are estimated for a sample of 151 European selling partners. First, {{the results show that}} stock market reactions observed around the date of announcement are significant and positive. This finding is consistent with that of finance research literature on stock market reactions to ordinary asset sales. This leads us to discount the idea that stock markets place a specific valuation on JV <b>sell-offs.</b> Second, the results indicate that the reasons for JV <b>sell-offs</b> are a determinant of ARs of selling partners.

40|$|In {{this article}} we compare the profit and loss arising from the delta-neutral dynamic hedging of options, using two {{possible}} values for the delta of the option. The first is the Black-Scholes implied delta, while {{the second is the}} localdelta, namely the delta of the option in a generalized Black-Scholes model with a local volatility, recalibrated to the market smile every day. We explain why, in negatively skewed markets, the local delta should provide a better hedge than the implied delta during slow rallies or fast <b>sell-offs,</b> and a worse hedge, although to a smaller extent, during fast rallies or slow <b>sell-offs.</b> Since slow rallies and fast <b>sell-offs</b> are more likely to occur than fast rallies or slow <b>sell-offs</b> in negatively skewed markets (provided we have physical as well as implied negative skewness), we conclude that, on average, the local delta provides a better hedge than the implied delta in negatively skewed markets. We obtain the same conclusion in the case of positively skewed markets. We illustrate these results using both simulated and real time-series of equity-index data, which have had a large negative implied skew since the stock market crash of October 1987. Moreover, we check numerically that the conclusions we draw are true when transaction costs are taken into account. In the last section we discuss the case of barrier options. ...|$|R

25|$|Peru was reintegrated {{into the}} global {{economic}} system, and began to attract foreign investment. The <b>sell-off</b> of state-owned enterprises led to improvements in some service industries, notably local telephony, mobile telephony and Internet. For example, before privatization, a consumer or business had to wait up to 10 years to get a local telephone line installed by the state-run telephone company, {{at a cost of}} $607 for a residential line. A couple of years after privatization, the wait was reduced to just a few days. Peru's Physical land based telephone network had a dramatic increase in telephone penetration from 2.9% in 1993 to 5.9% in 1996 and 6.2% in 2000, and a dramatic decrease in the wait for a telephone line. Average wait went from 70 months in 1993 (before privatization) to two months in 1996 (after privatization). Privatization also generated foreign investment in export-oriented activities such as mining and energy extraction, notably the Camisea gas project and the copper and zinc extraction projects at Antamina.|$|E

Six Flags CEO Mark Shapiro said he expected the parks to continue operation after the sale, a lesson the company learned after its public relations debacle with the closure of AstroWorld.

In addition, Six Flags announced the sale of Wyandot Lake in Powell, Ohio to the neighboring Columbus Zoo and Aquarium.

40|$|Large foreign {{acquisitions}} of U. S. {{real estate}} {{always seem to}} generate considerable public concern. Most recently the reaction has been to Japanese purchases, but similar reactions occurred to Arab petro-dollar purchases in the early 1970 s. This study examines {{the impact of the}} buyer's nationality on the change in the wealth of the selling firm's shareholders for voluntary <b>sell-offs</b> of U. S. real estate. In general, this study indicates that voluntary <b>sell-offs</b> of real estate assets result in {{a significant increase in the}} wealth of the selling firm's shareholders. However, the change in the wealth of the selling firm's shareholders for U. S. buyers was not significantly different from that for non-U. S. buyers. Since no advance is indicated for foreign buyers over domestic buyers, laws or regulations hindering the foreign acquisition of U. S. real estate cannot be supported. The assumption of a "non-level playing field" for U. S. real estate investors who bid against foreign firms for U. S. real estate assets is not confirmed.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{determinants}} of the choice between two forms of corporate divestitures⎯spin-offs versus <b>sell-offs.</b> We hypothesize that the choice {{is driven by the}} characteristics of divesting firms (their pre-divestiture market valuation relative to intrinsic value and marginal tax rates), the characteristics of assets being divested (their performance under parent firm’s management relative to their full potential), and by the prevailing market conditions at the time of divestiture (such as the degree of investor optimism or pessimism). Our hypotheses generate testable predictions regarding the announcement effects of divestitures and the post-divestiture operating and stock return performance of divesting firms. Our empirical findings using a sample of 322 spin-offs and 3, 280 <b>sell-offs</b> from 1980 to 2006 are as follows. First, firms with lower market valuations relative to their intrinsic value and higher marginal tax rates are more likely to spin off their assets. Second, assets which underperform relative to their full potential {{are more likely to be}} sold off. Third, spin-offs are more likely during periods of investor optimism.
