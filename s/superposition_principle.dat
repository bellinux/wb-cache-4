The properties of the {{electrostatic force}} were that it varied as an inverse square law directed in the radial direction, was both attractive and repulsive (there was intrinsic polarity), was independent {{of the mass of}} the charged objects, and followed the <b>superposition</b> <b>principle.</b> Coulomb's law unifies all these observations into one succinct statement.|$|E

This superposition springs from the linearization of second-order ordinary difference equations by means of non-point transformations which act simultaneously on equations and meshes.

Fortunately, an arbitrary wave shape can be decomposed into an infinite set of sinusoidal waves {{by the use of}} Fourier analysis. As a result, the simple case of a single sinusoidal wave can be applied to more general cases. In particular, many media are linear, or nearly so, so the calculation of arbitrary wave behavior can be found by adding up responses to individual sinusoidal waves using the <b>superposition</b> <b>principle</b> to find the solution for a general waveform.

[...] Nonlinear systems are often analyzed using numerical methods on computers, for example by simulating their operation using a simulation language. [...] If only solutions near a stable point are of interest, nonlinear systems can often be linearized by approximating them by a linear system using perturbation theory, and linear techniques can be used.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the absence}} of {{nonlinear}} effects, the <b>superposition</b> <b>principle</b> {{can be used to}} predict the shape of interacting waveforms through the simple addition of the disturbances. This interaction of waves to produce a resulting pattern is generally termed [...] "interference" [...] and can result in a variety of outcomes. If two waves of the same wavelength and frequency are in phase, both the wave crests and wave troughs align. This results in constructive interference and an increase in the amplitude of the wave, which for light is associated with a brightening of the waveform in that location. Alternatively, if the two waves of the same wavelength and frequency are out of phase, then the wave crests will align with wave troughs and vice versa. This results in destructive interference and a decrease in the amplitude of the wave, which for light is associated with a dimming of the waveform at that location. See below for an illustration of this effect.|$|E

It is shown that the associated Riemann theta function may be d composed into a sum containing two terms, each term being the product of three one-dimensional theta functions.

The solution, while similar to Volkersen’s treatment of tension loaded lap joints, is inherently two-dimensional, {{and in general}} predicts a multi-component adhesive shear stress state.
