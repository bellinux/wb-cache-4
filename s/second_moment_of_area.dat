The first metatarsal, as a cornerstone structure of the foot, presum-ably expresses diaphyseal morphology that reflects loading history of the foot during stance phase of gait. Human feet differ substantially from those of other apes in terms of loading histories when comparing {{the path of the}} center of pressure during stance phase, which re-flects different weight transfer mechanisms. Here we use a novel approach for quantifying continuous thickness and cross-sectional geometric properties of long bones in order to test explicit hypotheses about loading histories and diaphyseal structure of adult chimpanzee, gorilla, and human first metatarsals. For each hallucal metatarsal, 17 cross sections were extracted at regularly-spaced intervals (2. 5 % length) between 25 % and 65 % length.

40|$|Abstract- In {{this work}} the {{internal}} stress equations for pinned portal frames under {{different kinds of}} loading was formulated using the equilibrium method. Unlike similar equations in structural engineering textbooks these equations considered the effect of deformation due to shearing forces. This effect was captured in a dimensionless constant α, when α is set to zero, the effect of shear deformation is removed and the equations become the same as what can be obtained in any structural engineering textbook. An investigation into the effect of shear deformation on the internal stresses and its variation with the ratios <b>of</b> <b>second</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> the horizontal and vertical members of the frame () and the ratio of height to length of the portal frame () showed {{that the effect of}} shear deformation is generally small and can be conveniently neglected in manual calculations except for pinned portal frames under concentrated horizontal forces where the effect was considerable...|$|R

50|$|Megadontia {{works by}} {{increasing}} the ratio of minimum to maximum <b>second</b> <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> <b>area</b> or the efficiency of a shape to resist bending or malformation. This resistance is tied to whichever specific axis about which the bending is being applied. Also called mandible robusticity, this characteristic allows for much stronger mastication of food. However, calculations made using biomechanical models does not necessarily perfectly predict the efficiency of different mandibular compositions in resistance to bending forces. Shearing {{is also an important}} factor in mastication effectiveness, and resistance to shear is proportional to the cross sectional <b>area</b> <b>of</b> the teeth. In postcanine Megadontia specimens, the cross sectional area is on average much larger than modern hominids which implies greater shear stress resistance.|$|R
40|$|Abstract An {{alternative}} {{formula is}} presented to compute shear stresses in non-principal coordinates of arbitrary cross-sections for linear elastic, prismatic beams. In contrast to the formula traditionally used in textbooks for non-principal coordinates, the new formula avoids lengthy computations with the first and <b>second</b> <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> <b>area.</b> The trade-off is that the normal stresses must be computed before the shear stresses; however, since in practical situations both normal stresses and shear stresses need to be known, this is not considered a general disadvantage of the proposed formula. Whereas the traditional formula takes different formats for principal and non-principal coordinates, the new formula is valid in any coordinate system. Thus, simplicity is gained.

Similarly, a critical bending <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> the tapered column subjected to a pure bending could be determined by using a correction factor � m. A large number of simulations carried out within a wide range of the ratios <b>of</b> <b>second</b> <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> <b>area</b> allowed to determine the proper values of theses two factors.

The surface passing through these axes determined in each section, from the lateral to the medial third of the neck, {{is one of the}} two anatomical surfaces of symmetry of the neck. The geometric structure defined by this surface is a helicoid. No plane, in the ordinary sense of the word, has to be defined in the femoral neck. At the trochanteric junction, the major axis is inclined about 17 °on the ante-version plane, twists anteriorly and becomes more horizontal to finish with a mean inclination of 60 °at the cephalic junction. Surprisingly, this twist and then the neck torsion are in opposite directions to that suggested by the bony markers, often taken as a reference and reported in the anatomical descriptions.

40|$|A {{repetitive}} pin-jointed, pre-twisted {{structure is}} analysed using a state variable transfer matrix technique. Within a global coordinate system the transfer matrix is periodic, but {{introduction of a}} local coordinate system rotating with nodal cross-sections results in an autonomous transfer matrix for this Floquet system. Eigenanalysis reveals four real unity eigenvalues, indicating tension–torsion coupling, and equivalent continuum properties such as Poisson’s ratio, cross-sectional area, torsion constant and the tension–torsion coupling coefficient are determined. A variety of real and complex near diagonal Jordan decompositions are possible for the multiple (eight) complex unity eigenvalues and these are discussed in some detail. Analysis of the associated principal vectors shows that a bending moment produces curvature in the plane <b>of</b> the <b>moment,</b> together with shear deformation in the perpendicular plane, but no bending–bending coupling; {{the choice of a}} structure having an equilateral triangular cross-section is thought responsible for this unexpected behaviour, as the equivalent continuum <b>second</b> <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> <b>area</b> are equal about all cross-sectional axes.

40|$|We {{present a}} simple and {{efficient}} method {{for the analysis of}} shear flexible isotropic and orthotropic composite shells. Classical thin shell constitutive equations used in the explicit finite element code EPSA to model homogenous isotropic shells using "through-the-thickness-integration" and layered orthotropic composite shells [1 – 3, 5] are modified to account for transverse shear deformation. This effect is important in the analysis of thick plates and shells as well as composite laminates, where interlaminar effects matter. Transverse shear stresses are calculated using a linear normal strain distribution, where first the shear forces are calculated and then the stresses are calculated by means of the generalized section properties, i. e., first and <b>second</b> <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> <b>area.</b> The formulation is a generalization of the analytical method of analyzing composite beams. It is simple and computationally inexpensive, and it yields accurate results without employing higher order displacement interpolations. In the case of isotropic shells, the transverse shear stresses are distributed parabolically, based on the assumption of linear normal strain distribution through the thickness and on application of the quadratic shape function to transverse shear strains. The transverse shear stresses are included in the elastic-perfectly plastic yield function of the Huber-Mises-Hencky type...|$|R
