40|$|As known, {{the meeting}} between the capital demand and offer takes place in an {{organized}} framework, on the capital market. There, we shall meet the title issuers and also the investors, which, as capital owners, intend to use their available capitals in a very efficient manner. If we refer at shares, these appear in form of negotiable instruments which mediate, in a very specific manner, the {{meeting between the}} reminded capital demand and offer. Therefore, through share issues, the capital users have the possibility to mobilize <b>supplementary</b> <b>capitals,</b> necessary to develop the respective business, which brings profit. In order for this thing to happen, the respective shares must sell. On the other side, for the respective shares to sell, somebody must need them; these are the investors who want to buy such titles for their available capital. When an investor takes into account such a variant of placing capital in shares, something which motivates him must exist. In this case, obviously the main motivation is the gain obtained after the respective capital placement. In such a context, one of the forms of the fain obtained after a capital placement in shares made by investors in such titles is dividend. The more the dividends afferent to its shares is, the higher the degree of attractiveness for the shares. As regards this fact, we must mention that sometimes, in certain years, such as the years of economic crisis, for example the profits earned by the issuing company may be smaller or even inexistent; consequently, obviously, the dividends will be smaller or even inexistent. Such a state of things would have negative effects on the capital market, the prices of the respective shares decreasing, which would also lead {{to the degree of}} the degree of attractiveness for the respective shares. Continuing this idea, it is easy to understand that, if the user of capitals, as share issuer, proceeded to a new share issue in order to mobilize some <b>supplementary</b> <b>capitals,</b> {{it would be difficult to}} evaluate his success. More exactly, it would be difficult to evaluate how fast the respective shares would sell, subsequent to which the issuer could mobilize new capitals, which could be found in the equity capital of the issuing company. This is a very good reason for the issuer of such titles is preoccupied by the fact that the products issued by him, such as the respective shares, to have such a degree of attractiveness which, finally, would lead to reaching the proposed purpose, meaning that the issued shares would sell, subsequent to this sale, the desired capitals would be mobilized. On this plan, one of the possibilities that the issuer has in order to reach his purpose mentioned above is to start to valorize such shares, using an adequate dividend policy. dividend, share policy, capital, demand, offer. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: The procyclical {{nature of}} capital models under the Basel II Accord {{has been widely}} criticised for {{exacerbating}} lending in economic expansions and restricting lending during economic contractions. These criticisms have led regulators to employ countercyclical measures in subsequent Basel accords. One of these measures, the countercyclical capital buffer (CCB), has been proposed as an effective countercyclical measure in expansionary periods {{as a deterrent to}} excessive lending through increased bank capital requirements. Aim: The effectiveness of the CCB during contractions is not obvious. Contingent convertible (CoCo) bonds – which are bond-like until triggered by a deterioration of a prescribed capital metric, at which point they convert into a form of equity – are explored as a <b>supplementary</b> countercyclical <b>capital</b> measure for such periods to establish whether or not they function effectively. Setting: The analysis is undertaken using global bank CoCo data, and then applied to South African banks. Methods: The Hodrick Prescott filter was applied to empirical historical data. Results: The CCB functions as a good countercyclical capital measure in times of economic expansion by absorbing losses and stabilising the capital base through equity issuance. Conclusion: The issuance of CoCo bonds – if their trigger mechanisms are designed correctly – may prove helpful to banks and the broader financial sector in times of economic contraction through the countercyclical capital properties that manifest through CoCo bonds under these economic conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{study is}} an {{evaluation}} of capital adequacy ratios as indicators of bank performance with major focus on determining effectiveness of these capital adequacy ratios in indicating performance of banks. Twelve commercial banks formed the research population with secondary dataset obtained from end of year financial statements and annual reports for the period 2009 to 2012 based on judgemental technique. An explanatory research design was {{used in conjunction with}} an econometric panel regression model to establish the relationships between capital adequacy ratios and bank performance as well as to empirically investigate whether non-risk based capital ratios outperform their risk-weighted counterparts in indicating performance. Panel data obtained was presented in form of tables and was analyzed using regression analysis with the aid of an econometric statistical package. The GLS method used revealed that leverage ratio is more related to commercial bank performance than the risk-weighted ratio and gross revenue ratio is statistically insignificant in indicating bank performance. This relationship brought a revelation that simple measures of capital adequacy have better indicative power and provide useful financial information that regulators can use as a starting point in assessing financial condition of banks. For the period under investigation, non-risk based CARs; particularly leverage ratio outperformed the risk-weighted ratio in indicating bank performance in Zimbabwe. Bank regulators and commercial banks themselves can therefore derive substantial benefits from the use of simple capital ratios as a <b>supplementary</b> requirement. Overall, <b>capital</b> adequacy ratios alone were to a lesser extent effective in indicating bank performance pointing to the need to consider other variables that explain performance of banks. Therefore, policymakers should exercise great care not to too heavily rely on a single tool, but balance the benefits and costs of any indicator to leverage other policies at regulatory disposal...|$|R

40|$|In {{the end of}} 2006, China {{realized}} the opening of financial market, thus Chinese commercial banks {{have to face the}} global competitors. The business performance of banks is the overall reflection of competence; however, the performance of Chinese banking industry is still weaker. According to some theoretical basis of capital structure, capital structure affects overall business performance by influencing the corporate governance of corporations. The capital structure of commercial banks also plays a vital role in achieving the financial goals and moderate operation. Thus this study aims to research how commercial banks’ capital structure affects business performance in China, and gives the recommendation to optimize the banks’ capital structure and improve business performance. This study employs penal data set in a sample of 14 Chinese listed commercial banks from 2005 to 2009. There are two indictors to measure the business performance: return on equity (ROE) and non-performing loan ratio (NPR). Considering the specificity of the banking industry, the study mainly focuses the effects of ownership structure (which includes ownership concentration, nature of owner and circulation stock proportion), <b>supplementary</b> <b>capital</b> and capital adequacy level on business performance. The results for return on equity indicate that proportion of top five shareholders (CR 5) which is fairly significantly correlates with ROE positively. But the holding proportion of largest shareholder (CR 1) is negative but no significantly affects ROE. Capital adequacy level negatively affects ROE. The results for non-performing loan show that CR 1 and CR 5 do not significantly affect NPR. The characteristic of the largest shareholder correlates with neither ROE nor NPR, the proportion of circulating stock affects business performance significantly.

40|$|Abstract—With the {{drafting}} of new banking regulation via the Basel II capital accord, bank regulatory capital and its adequacy has become {{the subject of much}} debate. In our contribution, we strive to construct a stochastic dynamic model to describe the evolution of bank capital that incorporates capital gains and losses. In our paper, such gains and losses are represented by loan loss reserves and the unexpected loan losses, respectively. In this regard, we recognize that bank capital consists of Tier 1 capital (mainly equity which is modeled via an exponential Lévy process), Tier 2 and Tier 3 capital (collectively known as <b>supplementary</b> <b>capital).</b> The latter two types of capital mainly consist of (short- and long-term) subordinate debt held by debtholders and loan losses reserves. Furthermore, we setup an optimal capital management problem which maximizes the expectation of bank capital under a risk constraint on the Capital-at-Risk (CaR), where CaR is defined in terms of Valueat-Risk (VaR). In particular, we seek an optimal bank capital management strategy in a mean-CaR paradigm. Historical evidence from Organization for Economic Corporation and Development (OCED) countries assists us in establishing the relationship between output gap (as the proxy of business cycle) and capital adequacy ratios (CARs). Finally, we provide a brief analysis of some of the optimal capital management issues and suggestions for topics of possible future direction...|$|E

40|$|Provisioning {{means the}} {{evaluation}} of future costs and losses, the estimation of future liabilities towards one’s surroundings, an increase in equity, {{as well as the}} real value of assets. During asset valuation, the reserve balance may cause a reduction of the company’s value - net assets. This could be a change of a few percentage points. Non-balance provisions cause a decrease in the value of assets, from which liabilities and reserves will be deducted. The value of the enterprise – through asset evaluation – will be lower by a few percentage points. However, it is <b>supplementary</b> <b>capital</b> (capital protection) which has the greatest importance in the methods a company uses in the valuation of assets. As research indicates, retained earnings and additional capital make up 30 – 59 % of owners equity. When using the multiplier method, reserves have a small indirect effect on the amount of dividends, net income decrease, etc. – due to the reducing of the financial result and taxes. The mixed method takes up an important position in the valuation of a company’s goodwill. Therefore, the relevance of provisions in this valuation, will be lower than the during the valuation of assets. When valuating income reserves do not play a significant role. They are taken into consideration during the adjustment of the financial result, directing it towards cash flow, and for determining the financial outflows in the form of income tax. Provisions may also have a slight influence on the cost of the capital of the enterprise, i. e. a factor discounting cash flow. Provisions are not cash outflows and therefore, in the most popular income methods, they do not play a significant role. Reserves that are tax-deductible costs may affect the amount of tax burdens and thus indirectly affect the cash flow. The biggest and most direct effect of provisions on the valuation of a company can be observed in the asset methods {{as well as in the}} mixed methods. However, in the reserve multiplier methods affect the value of the multiplier element of a listed company and the value of the company measured the base element. Jolanta Żukowsk...|$|E
40|$|The Japanese steel {{industry}} accounts for 10 % of Japan's energy consumption, {{and therefore the}} success or failure of that industry's energy conservation measures is of the greatest importance in any discussion of energy and environmental issues, including global climate change issues. This paper makes an objective, quantitative assessment, based on public statistics, of the state of progress of energy conservation measures under the Voluntary Action Plan on the Environment in the Japanese {{steel industry}}, and estimates their cost-effect. This assessment confirms, from objective source materials, that as a result of the steel industry's energy conservation measures under the Voluntary Action Plan on the Environment, it has since fiscal year 1998 achieved a sharp improvement in total energy consumption per ton of crude steel, in fiscal 2005 achieving an improvement of approximately 7 % relative to fiscal 1990, and approximately 13 % relative to fiscal 1998. Regarding the costs incurred as a result of implementing these measures, the paper estimates, based on the reduction in the steel industry's capital investment and other <b>supplementary</b> <b>capital</b> expenditure and in energy operating costs, that they totaled at least � 175. 3 billion, and taking the amounts of the steep rises in energy prices in recent years into consideration, that they totaled approximately � 68. 4 billion. Based on the above, the paper estimates the cost-effect of the Japanese steel industry's energy conservation measures under the Voluntary Action Plan on the Environment to be approximately � 124, 000 /t-CO 2 (US$ 1, 100 /t-CO 2), or approximately � 64, 000 /t-CO 2 (US$ 600 /t-CO 2) after taking into consideration the steep rises in energy prices in recent years. Setting aside the significance of precluding measures such as a government taxation system or "emission cap and trade" systems, the paper assesses the measures as having been comparatively expensive and having imposed a severe burden; the cost-effect being remarkably low relative to estimates of marginal abatement cost based on simulation models and to other benchmarks such as the current price of EU emission trading (EU-ETS). These results show that there are no grounds for arguments such as that the Voluntary Action Plan on the Environment is ineffective relative to such schemes as a taxation system or "emission cap and trade" system, and that it is laudable that the Japanese steel industry has been accepting this severe burden and achieving steady results under the plan. However, it also shows that in terms of cost-effectiveness there is room for reconsideration of the desirable form of further energy conservation measures. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper reviews {{findings}} of the Detailed Assessment of Italy’s Compliance with the Basel Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision. The Italian banking system seems to exhibit {{a high degree of}} resilience to possible macroeconomic shocks, as supported by the evolution of some financial soundness indicators and by the results of various model simulations. Despite significant improvements over the last few years, the quality of banks’ loan portfolios remains moderate. Cost-cutting and restructuring remain key challenges for Italian banks, with several conjunctural factors putting pressures on costs and income.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} key {{findings of}} the Detailed Assessment of the Observance of Standards and Codes in the Financial Sector of Bermuda. The small number of licensed deposit-taking institutions in Bermuda {{are part of the}} broader financial intermediation sector. Typically, some 50 percent to 60 percent of the banks’ income is fee based. The value of client assets and the volume of their activities are the main generators of this income. Efforts to reduce employee and occupancy costs that reflect the high cost of doing business on the island are continuing.
