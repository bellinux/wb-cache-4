5|$|When Mulder and Scully {{survey the}} crash site, {{they realize that}} there is a nine-minute {{disparity}} between the crash and the time on the victims' wristwatches, indicating missing time. Mulder believes that Max was abducted from the plane and that his body will not be found. Meanwhile, Scott Garrett, a Man in Black posing as an NTSB investigator, steals the zip gun from the assassin's body and erases his face and fingerprints with acid. Larold Rehbun, a passenger who <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> to Max, is found alive. His injuries indicate exposure to radiation.|$|E
5|$|Davis {{had offered}} to {{nominate}} Eichelberger for {{a place at the}} Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth. Eichelberger joined 247 other officers there in July 1924. Since the students were seated alphabetically, he <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> to the officer who topped the class, Major Dwight D. Eisenhower. Other students in the class included Joseph Stilwell, Leonard Gerow and Joseph T. McNarney. Eichelberger graduated as a Distinguished Graduate, one of the top quarter of the class, and stayed on at the Command and General Staff College as its Adjutant General. In 1929, he became a student at the Army War College. On graduation, he was posted back to the Adjutant General's Office in Washington, D.C.|$|E

The three surviving Reagan children, Michael, Patti, and Ron, gave final eulogies at the interment ceremony.|$|E
5|$|The {{trials that}} the Donner Party {{had so far}} endured {{resulted}} in splintered groups, each looking out for themselves and distrustful of the others. Grass was becoming scarce, and the animals were steadily weakening. To relieve the load of the animals, everyone was expected to walk. Keseberg ejected Hardkoop from his wagon, telling the elderly man {{that he had to}} walk or die. A few days later, Hardkoop <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> to a stream, his feet so swollen that they split open, and he was not seen again. William Eddy pleaded with the others to find Hardkoop, but they all refused, swearing that they would waste no more resources on a man who was almost 70 years old.|$|E
25|$|In February 1948, Gibson {{introduced}} Financial Secretary to the Treasury Glenvil Hall to Stanley, {{believing that}} Marcus Wulkan {{might be in}} a position to arrange an American loan of £250 million to the UK government.

25|$|In {{the evening}} after the meeting, both leaders had {{dinner at the}} hotel. They were served crayfish, fried {{asparagus}} and spicy noodles and split the bill upon finishing the meal.

25|$|The OS {{map shows}} that Hessilhead Cottage <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> to a well {{maintained}} walled garden, however by 1897 the garden {{had fallen into}} ruin. A gamekeepers cottage with a nearby pheasantry is marked from 1912, when a curling pond makes its first appearance, to the north-west of the castle ruins.

El Mahroug said she <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> to Berlusconi, who later took her upstairs and gave her an envelope containing €7,000. She said he also gave her jewellery.|$|E

In 1995, former Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher invited him to her 70th birthday dinner, where he <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> to the Queen. He appeared only occasionally in public, particularly in his last years when he used a wheelchair. His last appearance was at the memorial service for Sir Edward Heath on 8 November 2005.|$|E
25|$|After fatally {{shooting}} Bernall, Harris {{turned toward}} the next table, where Bree Pasquale <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> to the table rather than under it. Harris asked Pasquale {{if she wanted to}} die, and she responded with a plea for her life. Witnesses later reported that Harris seemed disoriented—possibly from the heavily bleeding wound to his nose. As Harris taunted Pasquale, Klebold noted Ireland trying to provide aid to Hall, who had suffered a wound to his knee. As Ireland tried to help Hall, his head rose above the table; Klebold shot him a second time, hitting him twice in the head and once in the foot. Ireland was knocked unconscious, but survived.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of his murder, Normand left Taylor's {{bungalow}} at 7:45pm in a happy mood, carrying a book he had lent her. They blew kisses {{to each other as}} her limousine drove away. Normand was the last person known to have seen Taylor alive, and the Los Angeles Police Department subjected her to a grueling interrogation but ruled her out as a suspect. Most subsequent writers have done the same. However, Normand's career had already slowed, and her reputation was tarnished by revelations of her addiction, which was seen as a moral failing. According to George Hopkins, who <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> to her at Taylor's funeral, Normand wept inconsolably throughout the ceremony.|$|E
50|$|At the 2008 Wimbledon Championships, Hrbatý lost to {{his good}} friend and former doubles partner Federer in the first round, 6-3, 6-2, 6-2. Hrbatý <b>sat</b> {{immediately}} <b>next</b> to Federer and had an amicable conversation with him during the last changeover of the match, telling Federer {{that this may be}} Hrbatý's last Wimbledon and that, as a joke, this has been the first victory for Federer in a match against him and leads him 2-1 in head to head.|$|R

25|$|In the Northern Ireland Assembly, he {{was seen}} as a Unionist {{sympathetic}} to the short term demands of Sinn Féin. He abstained against attempts by the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) to exclude Sinn Féin from office in July 2000 and October 2001. In April 2001, he provoked a direct political attack from the DUP over him being the only Unionist to vote against a motion condemning the display of lilies commemorating the 1916 Easter Uprising at Parliament Buildings. He also expressed support for the right of Sinn Féin members to make speeches in Irish (Gaelic) {{on the floor of the}} Assembly. Later, political commentators noted how he <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> to Sinn Féin's Martin McGuinness at the funeral of Northern Ireland football legend George Best in December 2005 as a sign of how Northern Ireland had moved on.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, {{a series of}} {{articles}} appeared in the school's student newspaper The Tower, detailing significant safety and space issues within what was then known as the IA (Industrial Arts) Building. Much debate over the conditions (and need for expansion) in the 1930s-era wing ensued between the cost-conscious GPPS Board and concerned parents and teachers. The School Board ultimately agreed that major improvements were necessary. An area with tennis courts was selected for the expansion, which were later replaced on top of the industrial technology shops. The top floor of math rooms was unchanged. A modern photography classroom and lab <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> to a new drafting room, while two modernized art rooms provided general and commercial art classes with fine homes. The first floor featured a fine drawing and painting studio, a superlative ceramics, sculpture, and metals laboratory, and an art appreciation lecture classroom. The industrial technology department started in earnest in the remodeled basement. The sprawling underground addition started with the parking and outdoor service area of the four-bay automotive shop backed up by a sophisticated wood and metal shop and a TV studio.|$|E
25|$|The {{song was}} {{recorded}} at Aobadai Studio in Meguro, Tokyo, {{in a single}} take, as a method to retain an emotional feel to the song. The band experimented with the song in demo sessions recorded by their regular recording engineer Masashi Uramoto, while Yamaguchi ad-libbed material. One take of the song was recorded by the project's assistant engineer, Ayaka Toki. The band liked the dynamic nature of her mix, feeling it had a strong indie rock sound, feeling it was similar to a rough recording by an independent band with little sound processing and equalization, and asked Toki to become the leading engineer for the song. The band asked Toki to retain the rough sound of the song for the final mix, believing it was beneficial to expressing the song's dynamic range. The band did not use any of the recording booths at Aobadai Studio, instead recorded {{in the control room}} while Toki <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> to the band. As Sakanaction member Ami Kusakari was ill during the recording, the take did not include bass guitar. The other band members felt that this created a strange vibe in the recording studio, as they were used to Kusakari's bassline being the basis for their songs. After her condition improved, Kusakari overdubbed her bass guitar parts into the song.|$|E

25|$|In February 1900, Grand Duke Andrei {{was invited}} by his brothers, Grand Dukes Kirill and Boris, {{to a dinner}} party {{at the house of}} Mathilde Kschessinska. Kschessinska, the Prima Ballerina Assoluta of the Mariinsky Theatre, was the eldest among the three most {{prominent}} dancers of her generation at the Imperial Russian Ballet, along with Anna Pavlova and Tamara Karsavina. Grand Duke Andrei <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> to his hostess during the dinner, but accidentally spilt a glass of red wine on her. Mathilde, attracted to the young grand duke, seven years her junior, took the incident as good omen. Age 28, Mathilde had been the mistress of Tsar Nicholas II when he was heir to the throne. Their two-year relationship ended with Nicholas' engagement to his future wife, Alexandra. Mathilde was ambitious and eager to maintain her close relationship with the Romanovs. She subsequently began a long time affair with Grand Duke Sergei Mikhailovich of Russia, Nicholas and Andrei's first cousin once removed. As she was not in love with Sergei, but enjoyed his company and protection, Mathilde pursued a relationship with Grand Duke Andrei, the third Romanov to become involved with her. By July 1900, they became lovers, traveling together that summer to Biarritz and Paris. In the autumn 1901, they visited several Italian cities, including Venice, Padua, Florence and Rome. Grand Duke Sergei tolerated their affair, remaining a close and loyal friend to the famous ballerina, but {{the relationship between the two}} grand dukes grew tense. They tried to avoid each other and maintain civility while sharing the same woman for almost two decades.|$|E
500|$|Once the {{legislature}} convened in 1922, the inexperience of the Premier and his caucus was further laid bare. [...] Greenfield, {{devastated by the}} sudden death of his wife, turned in a poor performance. Faced with an aggressive attack by new Liberal leader John R. Boyle, Greenfield relied heavily on Attorney General John Brownlee, who <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> to him in the Legislature, to provide the defense. [...] The session got off to an inauspicious start: Greenfield nominated the government's preferred candidate for speaker, Oran McPherson, only to have one of his backbenchers, Alex Moore, nominate Independent Conservative John Smith Stewart; Stewart spared the government embarrassment by declining the nomination.|$|E

Home and his followers claimed {{that some of the}} séances took place in [...] "light" [...] but this {{was nothing more than a}} few candles, or some glow from a fireplace or open window. Home would adjust the lighting to his needs with no objections from his séance sitters. For example, there is this report from a witness: [...] "The room was very dark... Home's hands were visible only as a faint white heap". Home selected the séance sitters who <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> to him, his hands and feet were not controlled and according to Frank Podmore [...] "no precautions were taken against trickery." ...|$|E
