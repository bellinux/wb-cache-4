I went to breakfast at Chiefswood, and after that affair was happily transacted, I wended me merrily to the Black Cock Stripe, and there caused Tom Purdie and John Swanston cut out a quantity of firs. Got home about two o'clock, and set to correct a set of proofs. James Ballantyne presages well of this work, but is afraid of inaccuracies--so am I--but things must be as they may.

I wonder if a pill of holy trefoil would dispel this fascination.|$|R

I'll be like, 'Oh, Maya! I feel like in my own life, I do everything I cant to avoid drama. And so then to play this character who literally walks around starting fires every where she goes is really counterintuitive." [...] Mosley who initially questioned if Maya's transgender status should affect her portrayal revealed to the Daily News that [...] "it has really given me more layers and has really deepened my understanding of who she is."
