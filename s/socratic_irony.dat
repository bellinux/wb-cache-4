Most notable is Bloom's discussion of <b>Socratic</b> <b>irony.</b> In fact, irony {{is the key to}} Bloom’s take on the Republic (see his discussion of Books II–VI of the Republic.) Allan Bloom says a philosopher is immune to irony because he can see the tragic as comic and comic as tragic. Bloom refers to Socrates, the philosopher par excellence, in his Interpretative Essay stating, [...] "Socrates can go naked where others go clothed; he is not afraid of ridicule. He can also contemplate sexual intercourse where others are stricken with terror; he is not afraid of moral indignation. In other words he treats the comic seriously and the tragic lightly". Thus irony in the Republic refers to the [...] "Just City in Speech", which Bloom looks at not as a model for future society, nor as a template for the human soul; rather, it is a city presented ironically, an example of the distance between philosophy and every potential philosopher. Bloom follows Strauss in suggesting that the [...] "Just City in Speech" [...] is not natural; it is man-made.|$|E

Rhetoricians make a similar distinction which they call Schemes (Alliteration, Assonance, Rhyme, Slant Rhyme, Eye Rhyme, Scansion, etc.), and Tropes (Metaphor, Metonymy, Synecdoche, Irony, etc.). This article makes the claim that for humor scholars, Irony is the most significant of the four Master Tropes. It makes this argument first by comparing and contrasting Irony not only with Metaphor, Metonymy and Synecdoche, but also with Satire, Paradox, and Contradiction. Second, the article compares and contrasts the different types of Irony (Stable vs. Observable Irony, Linguistic vs. Situational Irony, and Accidental, Dramatic, <b>Socratic,</b> and Tragic <b>Irony).</b> And finally, the article explains the historical significance of Irony, and its ubiquity in contemporary societ...|$|R
50|$|According to the Encyclopædia Britannica,The term irony has {{its roots}} in the Greek comic {{character}} Eiron, a clever underdog who by his wit repeatedly triumphs over the boastful character Alazon.

40|$|After a {{discussion}} of the fundamental tropes of Rorty’s philosophy, in and beyond Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature, and after describing an imaginary conversation between Rorty, Heidegger, Derrida, and Dewey, the paper- a sort of monography in a nutshell- aims to shed new light on the strategic figure of the ironist as developed by Rorty in Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity. Who really is the Rortyan ironist? A comparison between the ironist and the Platonic character of Callicles clearly shows that Rorty’s irony does not correspond to <b>Socratic</b> or Platonic <b>irony.</b> From a close reading of relevant texts three ideas emerge: first, one can take an ironic stance despite its ability to support divergent metaphysical premises –Callicles is ironic in tone but foundationalist in metaphysics- while Rorty’s pragmatist appears ironic in tone and anti-foundationalist in metaphysics. Second, Callicles is a sort of public ironist; he feels pathos for the demos and the Athenian popular assembly, while the Rorty’s ironist appears as a private ironist looking for a hypothetical and detached conversation. And third, from the theatrical and literary point of view, Rorty’s ironist lacks the Greek character, the Greek mask, and Greek comicality...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Socratic</b> <b>irony</b> is [...] "the dissimulation {{of ignorance}} practised by Socrates {{as a means}} of confuting an adversary".

It was only with <b>Socratic</b> <b>irony</b> that the name craftsman could become representative of a religious deity.

40|$|This article pursues an antihermeneutic {{conception}} of <b>Socratic</b> <b>irony</b> that troubles the borders between pedagogical authority and humility.

Via divergent readings of Plato’s Gorgias and Aristophanes’ Clouds, as well as Bruno Latour’s interpretation of the former, I question how this approach to <b>Socratic</b> <b>irony</b> might re- and unwork rhetoricians’ positions of mastery with regard to both students and systematized bodies of knowledge...|$|E

His accusation of Socrates as ultimately responsible for the untimely death of Greek tragedy acquires both comic aspects and tragic proportions, surrounded as it is by his speculative and mytho-poetic account of the genesis of Greek tragedy and the additional prophesy of its destined rebirth in romantic Germany. Although he acknowledges the <b>Socratic</b> <b>irony</b> and Socrates' sense of humour, Nietzsche feels that he can identify Socrates' dialectic tricks in order to discern and disclose the dangerous essence of Socratism and its corrupting effect on noble Plato.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to analyze the {{function}} of irony in women writers' novels. The initial question is if irony plays a subversive role in women writers' novels in favor of female identity and writing as woman. In this context, Sevgi Soysal's Tante Rosa (1968) and Leyla Erbil's Cüce (2001) are examined. Different types of irony and their varying applications within the novels are presented, and it is ascertained that Romantic/unstable and <b>Socratic</b> <b>irony</b> are used alternatively in these novels. As a result of the analysis on the use of irony specifically in these two novels, it is argued that Tante Rosa emerges as a parody of bildungsroman that undermines the idea of self-development, and Cüce points to a rather fortified authorial voice that is beyond the fragmented representation of the selves in the novel...|$|E

To situate the philosophical context of rhetoric, I conduct a brief survey of rhetoric in the Gorgias and show how the idea of rhetoric informs Plato???s depiction in the Phaedrus. After going through the Gorgias and Phaedrus, a common important theme of the soul arises. I show how the soul is a complicated Platonic object because it must be the subject and object of collection and division. Lastly, I appeal to <b>Socratic</b> <b>irony</b> to explain the seemingly positive portrayal of what I call ???mindless??? practices. In fact, by acknowledging the irony in the dialogue, I show the praise to be false, while arguing that the true object of praise is philosophy...|$|E

The (historical) story of these three manifestations is told in the light of these patterns of thinking. And this too is not yet all there is: Kierkegaard had little time for Hegel, and none for Hegelianism, which had become an obstacle in his path. It is at this point that the polemicist in him was aroused. Just as Socrates, as a sophist, attacked the Sophists, so Kierkegaard, as a Hegelian, attacked Hegel and the Hegelians. ...|$|E

Sarcasm is an everyday phenomenon, yet many people cannot understand it and its purpose wholly. However, there is more and more research on it examining the subjects’ reaction to such utterances.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} Laurence Sterne's Tristram Shandy {{in light}} of Friedrich Schlegel's concept of irony. Departing from previous criticism, which focuses on Sterne's playful narrative techniques, the discussion here elucidates other ways in which Tristram Shandy exemplifies the kind of irony Schlegel theorizes. These ways include: Sterne's "Mischgedicht" method, which amalgamates in a single work many types of style, or diverse permutations of form and content; the depiction of Parson Yorick, who epitomizes <b>Socratic</b> <b>irony</b> as Schlegel defines it in the 108 th Lyceum fragment; Sterne's gentle satirizing of systematic thinkers, including his own narrator, Tristram; and Sterne's attitude toward words, knowledge, and reading. At the end of chapter 5, Sterne's irony is unraveled and reconstructed. This disentangling leads to a proposed refutation of recent interpretation of both Sterne and Schlegel. These studies see Sterne and Schlegel's irony as implying lack or flux of meaning. It is the strong contention of the following thesis that an essential aspect of Sterne and Schlegel's shared ironic world view is the continual, optimistic attempt to understand life, which necessarily presupposes a sincere and profound belief in both meaning and the reliable conveyance of it.

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{relations}} between irony and the unhappy consciousness. Both are forms of subjectivity that move {{in the context of}} the uneasy incommensurability between individuality and actuality. But whereas irony as such seems to rescue itself, the unhappy consciousness doesn’t. My question is thus whether irony could be a model of relief for despair, and more particularly for the unhappy consciousness. I intend to show however that irony itself can be dialectically understood both as strength and as sickness. Consequently, it depends on the very appearance of irony whether it either removes or rather intensifies despair. <b>Socratic</b> <b>irony</b> will appear as the most authentic form of irony for it seems able to bear the disruption between itself and actuality and hence keeps despair at a subtle distance. Romantic irony, by contrast, is nothing but a way of exorcising evil by evil itself. Finally I will argue that Kierkegaard’s own resolution of controlled irony, as the absolute condition for a genuine and human life, will appear to fall victim to what it fights, in being precisely an unsteady and endless remembrance of despair and hence only a covering disguise of the unhappy consciousness. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Sophocles’ Oedipus the King {{has often}} {{inspired}} concurrent interpretations examining the tragic {{irony of the}} play and the traumatic neurosis of its protagonist. The Theban king epitomizes {{a man who knows}} everything but himself, and Sophocles’ use of irony allows Oedipus to discover the truth in a manner that Freud viewed in The Interpretation of Dreams as “comparable to the work of a psychoanalysis. ” Psychoanalytical readings of Oedipus at times depend greatly on his role as a doubled figure, but this article specifically investigates his doubled voice in order to demonstrate the interrelated, chiasmic relationship between Oedipus’ trauma and the trope of irony. It argues, in fact, that irony serves as the language, so to speak, of the traumatic experiences haunting the king and his city, but it also posits that this doubled voice compounds the irony of the play and its hero. In other words, in addition to the Sophoclean irony that dominates the work, the doubling of the king’s voice reveals a modified form of <b>Socratic</b> <b>irony</b> that contributes to the tragedy’s power. Consequently, even after the king’s recognition of the truth ultimately resolves the work’s tragic irony, Oedipus remains divided by a state of simultaneous knowledge and ignorance...|$|E
40|$|Practice {{is defined}} as the {{exercise}} of a method or profession, and a treatise. Practise {{is defined as}} to practise tricks or artifices upon; to act upon by artifice so as to induce to do or believe something: to impose upon, delude: to make trial of, practically. The practise that my practice reconstitutes was characterised by its executor, Duchamp, not as irony, ironie, but ironisme, the deployment of irony in debate. <b>Socratic</b> <b>irony</b> is defined as feigning ignorance in order to confute an enemy in debate. Irony is saying the opposite of what you mean. Duchamp's practice of the practise of ironisme did not then manifest itself in an art questioning its own conditions, by dissemblance, as is popularly believed, although it appeared to. The 'ironic' art which has been taken as the product of Duchamp's practice was then merely an allegorical appearance, since allegory, saying one thing and meaning something else, is cousin-germane to irony. Duchamp criticism has been informed by such misconceptions to the extent that, as late as 1989, David Hopkins, in his review of Kuenzli and Naumann's Marcel Duchamp: Artist of the Century could still point to the need for "a full length study of Duchamp which convincingly contextualises his de-essentializing project, rather than blithely using it as a pretext for exercising contemporary critical strategies.

40|$|The {{following}} thesis outlines Hegel’s {{interpretation of}} Socrates {{in order to}} prove that as a negative dialectician, Socrates constitutes both a world historic personality who met a fate (Schicksal) which was tragic and practiced a philosophy which was tragically ironic. In this undertaking, Hegel’s Theory of Tragedy takes central importance which defines tragedy as two equally justified opposing forces which clash and destroy one another. This Theory of Tragedy is extended to show that through Socrates’ absolutely free will he brought himself to a tragic clash with the Athenian Ethical Life (Sittlichkeit), the Sophists’ arbitrary will, and the phenomenological will of uneducated Athenians. This clash is described in terms of a Hegelian Tragedy within which both Socrates and Athens were right and just in their actions against one another, but in the end were destroyed through those actions. His Method and Dialectic is then argued represent a negative dialectic which through the negation of negativity becomes positive as a midwifery of the consciousness. Next, because his Method and Dialectic begin in negativity and end in positivity, Socratic Elenchus is argued to not be representative of what has been termed “the Socratic Irony,” but instead only the negative moment of the Socratic Method. Finally, the <b>Socratic</b> <b>Irony</b> which Hegel argues is representative of both Socratic Philosophy and world history is defined as a Tragic Irony which sublates the finite consciousness of the phenomenological will, and the Ethical Life (Sittlichkeit), and the infinite arbitrary will of the Sophists in order to become a trans-subjective absolutely free will which becomes infinite itself like the Sophists’ will through reflection on the Ethical Life (Sittlichkeit) ...|$|E
40|$|Ever-Renewing Delight: Humour, Ritual and Performance of Ecstasy {{investigates the}} seductive power of ritual {{to evoke the}} {{heightened}} emotion of ecstasy. This project draws on my personal experience of ecstasy, a primal emotion that has the sensation of losing awareness of the physical body creating a joyous feeling of being one with the universe. The research contextualized in this exegesis served to develop my personal experience of ecstasy into a contemporary video installation. Towards this aim the themes explored are the sacred and ecstasy, ritual in performance art and humour of the ecstatic experience. My studio practice of performance-based video was enhanced by extensive research. The writings of George Bataille informed my perspective on the sacred and ecstasy within a capitalist society. My knowledge of ritual {{was derived from the}} research of Axel Michaels, from my investigation of shamanic techniques of ecstasy and from field research I conducted in Hindu temples of southern India. The use of ritual was further examined in the performance art of Joseph Beuys, Ana Mendieta, Almagul Menlibayeva and Stuart Ringholt. As my experience of ecstasy is a voyage of joyous playfulness I wanted to develop an appropriate strategy to express the humour of ecstasy. To achieve this I explored the <b>Socratic</b> <b>irony</b> of the spiritual teachings of crazy wisdom and the writings of Gilles Deleuze and Mikhail Bakhtin on humour and the carnival, respectively. These theoretical aspects informed the analysis of irony and humour in the shamanic performance of Marcus Coates and the carnivalesque style of Spartacus Chetwynd's performance art. This exegesis was written in conjunction with the creation of one major video installation, Ever-Renewing Delight (2014) that encompasses my ideas of ecstasy. The outcome of this research is a multi-projection video installation that uses the seductive power of ritual and humour to create an intimate ritual space with the intention of evoking joy and delight...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} an {{investigation}} of the ironical attribute inherent in poems which appear in Tristia by N P van Wyk Louw. The thesis can be divided into two sections: the first is an attempt at describing and defining philosophical irony; while the second serves as an introduction to the method (principally Literary Semantic) applied in the in-depth analysis in Chapter 4. The first chapter is {{a brief description of the}} history of irony starting,with <b>Socratic</b> <b>irony.</b> Chapter 2. 1 gives an eclectic view of the metaphysical irony of Nietzsche and his view of art. Chapter 2. 2 describes Soren Kierkegaard's concept of irony and his distinction between aesthetic and ethic irony. It should become apparent that the religious irony of Kierkegaard flows mainly from the counterdistinction of the human to the godlike. In Chapter 2. 3 existential irony is defined with reference to Kierkegaard as father of existential irony. N P van Wyk Louw's statements on art and his philosophy is viewed in chapter 2. 4 with reference to the theories of the above mentioned philosophers. Chapter 3 refers to the poem as a vehicle for various implication phenomena, and views irony as a specific implication phenomenon. This section uses as an analytical foundation J L Austin's Speech Act Semantics and F de Saussure's distinction of synchronic and diachronic linguistics. Some definitions of irony are evaluated. No alternative definition is provided but some assumptions are put forward on the function of irony as a form of implication. Chapter 4 comprises in-depth text analyses of selected poems in Tristia. The function of irony in these poems is investigated. Chapter 5 provides a general explanation for the use of irony in Tristia. Two vital poems in Tristia are looked at and it is concluded that poetry is the medium through which this poet identifies his ironical relationship to the universe...|$|E

The ironic perspective in Morgan's theory of metaphor [...] 4. Characters of the ironic mode in Kunda's engineering culture [...] 5. The temper of the times : irony and decadance {{in the work of}} Peter Fleming [...] 6. Beyond Švejkism : <b>socratic</b> <b>irony</b> as {{a strategy}} for living [...] 7. Conclusion : Beyond a smirk or a sneer. As Linda Hutcheon observes, irony always has an “edge”, a wry smile, smirk or sneer that suggests ridicule or foolishness. Yet this edge is but an edge, a cutting blade at the tip of a rich array of insights and prejudices that inform and afflict the term irony. Any commentary on irony is inevitably infused with the contradictions and ambiguities that these insights and prejudices contain. As perhaps might be expected, academic treatments of irony have tended to package these elements into manageable, but one-dimensional, polarities, alternating between the tone and perspective of ironic cynicism, which celebrates or condemns irony as a form of disengagement and distancing, an escape attempt from commitment in a disappointing world, and a romance of irony, in which irony is naïvely celebrated as a self-critical and reflectively engaged intellectual and moral stance. This is not the case with this work. What is being presented is a “third way irony”. Third way irony does not simply occupy the space between enthusiastic zeal and detached cynicism, but recognises and accepts the core tensions of an ironic stance or sensibility, a stance that is both utopian and dystopian in character, comic and tragic, with the potential for one who takes irony seriously to relapse into either unreflective self-assured arrogance or an absolute infinite negativity. The thesis also introduces and supports a “complex view” of irony, treating irony as a multi-faceted and multi-levelled outlook (perspective), rhetoric (performance) or character (personality). In each case, no simple contrast is assumed between “surface” and “deep” meanings (e. g. “what is intended” and “what is achieved”, “what is said” and “what is meant”, or “who one appears to be” and “who one is”) but a more subtle, nuanced, multiple and contradictory perspective, performance or personality. It is further argued that a comprehensive exploration of this complex third-way irony requires an understanding, familiarity and central focus on irony {{as a strategy}} for living, as the temper or stance of the “ironist”. The thesis argues, and seeks to illustrate, that organisational studies often neglects this dimension in favour of a focus on irony as a perspective or performance, or a one-dimensional, narrow and restricted view of the “ironist”. In order to build on organisational studies of irony, and move beyond such restrictions or neglect, the thesis {{takes the form of a}} series of theoretical interventions in the style commonly adopted by advocates of irony. These different interventions do, however, cluster around a central theme, which is that while organisational theorists have contributed towards an understanding of irony as a perspective, performance or personality, it is necessary and desirable to extend their work in two ways: firstly by introducing broader and deeper analyses of irony from writers on irony from outside organisational studies; and secondly by extending the discussion and understanding of irony as a strategy for living, and the manner in which this requires an integration of discussions of irony as a perspective or performance with considerations of the ironist as a character or temper. Given the complex, shifting and controversial nature of irony, the aim of the thesis is not to close off discussion by providing “the” model of irony but, rather, to be more open ended, encouraging discussion and debate, revealing how leading exponents of irony in organisational studies have addressed the topic, and develop suggestions on how their understanding might be extended or elaborated using the literature on irony from outside organisational studies. In these interventions, key organisational studies scholars considered include Gareth Morgan and Cliff Oswick in discussions of metaphor and the ironic perspective, and Gideon Kunda, Graham Sewell and Peter Fleming in discussions of the ironist.
