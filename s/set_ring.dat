Winston sold the diamond to a New York jewellery firm in 1942. In 1944, Commander William Bateman Leeds, Jr., millionaire son of the inventor of a tin plating process and friend of George Mauboussin, purchased the diamond for his wife, Reflexion Olive Leeds (born Olive Hamilton), {{and gave it to}} her in a <b>set</b> <b>ring</b> as a sixth anniversary present.|$|E

One day a good idea came into his head. He came to the King and said he had something to say to him.|$|E

50|$|Some rings, while {{advertised as}} {{and having the}} {{appearance}} of tension rings, in fact have a bridge holding the ring together underneath the jewel. These are not true examples of a tension <b>set</b> <b>ring,</b> {{but they are a}} good option {{if you are looking for}} an affordable alternative to true tension settings. Although the wearer knows that it is not a true setting, it will appear to be a tension setting to the casual observer. This is also a good option if you don't have the funds to purchase a handmade ring and are going for a ring that is produced on a mass scale.|$|E
50|$|This high {{velocity}} steam is directed {{on to the}} first <b>set</b> (<b>ring)</b> of moving blades. As the steam flows over the blades, due {{the shape of the}} blades, it imparts some of its momentum to the blades and loses some velocity. Only a part of the high kinetic energy is absorbed by these blades. The remainder is exhausted on to the next ring of fixed blade. The function of the fixed blades is to redirect the steam leaving from the first ring of moving blades to the second ring of moving blades. There is no change in the velocity of the steam as it passes through the fixed blades. The steam then enters the next ring of moving blades; this process is repeated until practically all the energy of the steam has been absorbed.|$|E
50|$|Red {{persuaded him}} to <b>set</b> <b>Ring</b> to find the gold cloak, chess-board, and piece that the king had lost a year ago. The king added that if he found them before Christmas, he could marry the king's daughter. Snati-Snati {{told him to get}} all the salt he could, and then carried it as they set out. The dog helped him up a cliff, and they came to a hut. Four trolls slept, and the {{porridge}} pot was on the fire. Snati-Snati told Ring to pour all the salt into the pot. When the trolls woke, the old hag ate first and complained that she had stolen milk from seven kingdoms and now it was salt. After they ate, the old one became thirsty and sent her daughter to fetch water, but the daughter would not unless the old hag gave her the gold piece. The daughter took it and went, but when she bent to drink, the prince and dog pushed her in. The hag grew thirstier, and sent her son, though he demanded the golden cloak; he met the same fate as his sister. Finally, she sent her husband, though he demanded the golden chessboard; he met the same fate as his children, but when the prince and dog went back to the cottage, his ghost followed them. They had to wrestle with it and defeat it a second time. At the cottage, Snati-Snati said they had to go inside, once the hag got out they could not defeat her, but he would attack with a red-hot iron from the fire and the prince must pour boiling porridge over her, and by those means, they defeated her. They returned to the king late Christmas night. The king was well pleased, but the dog asked Prince Ring to trade places for the night: he would sleep in the prince's bed, and the prince where he usually slept. Ring agreed, but after a time, the dog sent him to his own bed, with instructions not to meddle with anything about it.|$|E

40|$|A novel thiophene-containing compound, 2 -acetyl- 3 -amino- 5 -[(2 -oxopropyl) sulfanyl]- 4 -cyanothiophene (4) was {{synthesized}} by {{reaction of}} malononitrile with CS 2 {{in the presence}} of K 2 CO 3 under reflux in DMF and the subsequent reaction with chloroacetone followed by cyclization. This compound has been characterized by means of FT-IR, 1 H-NMR, 13 C-NMR, and mass spectrometry as well as elemental analysis. In addition, the molecular structures of compound 4 was determined by X-ray crystallography. The geometry of the molecule is stabilized by an intramolecular interaction between N 1 –H 1 ···O 1 to form S 6 graf <b>set</b> <b>ring</b> motif. In the crystal, molecules are linked via N 1 –H 2 ···O 1 and C 7 –H 7 A···N 2 interactions to form a three-dimensional network. Molecular structure and other spectroscopic properties of compound 4 were calculated using DFT B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 G (d,p) method. Results revealed a good agreement between the optimized geometric parameters and the observed X-ray structure. Furthermore, and by employing the natural bond orbital (NBO) method, the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) interactions along with natural atomic charges at different sites, were calculated; results indicated strong n→π* ICT from LP(1) N 5 →BD*(2) C 15 -C 16 (63. 23 kcal/mol). In addition, the stabilization energy E(2) of the LP(2) O 3 → BD*(1) N 5 -H 6 ICT (6. 63 kcal/mol) indicated the presence of intramolecular N-H···OH bonding. Similarly, calculations of the electronic spectra of compound 4 using, TD-DFT revealed a good agreement with the experimental data. Finally, compound 4 was evaluated for its in vitro cytotoxic effect against PC- 3 and HeLa cell lines, as an anticancer agent, and found to be nontoxic...|$|E
50|$|The {{cryptanalyst}} {{now knew}} the plugboard, the rotor order, and the absolute {{setting of the}} rotors for the doubled key, {{but he did not}} know the <b>ring</b> <b>setting.</b> He also knew what the message key setting should be, but that setting was useless without knowing the <b>ring</b> <b>setting.</b> The <b>ring</b> <b>setting</b> could be anything, and that meant the Poles did know how to position the rotors for the message body.

50|$|Category theory formalizes {{mathematical}} {{structure and}} its concepts {{in terms of}} a collection of objects and of arrows (also called morphisms). A category has two basic properties: the ability to compose the arrows associatively and the existence of an identity arrow for each object.

5000|$|A single <b>set</b> of <b>ring</b> {{stations}} {{would result}} in a very intermittent flow.

This would also smooth out the power requirements of the system over time.|$|R

25|$|The ground setting (GKX in {{the above}} example) should have been chosen at random, but Herivel {{reasoned}} that if operators were lazy, in a hurry or otherwise under pressure, they might simply use whatever rotor setting was currently showing on the machine.

50|$|The fuse {{is set for}} a {{predetermined}} time by rotation of a time ring in {{the lower part of}} the fuze. On firing, set-back causes the time-train firing pin to function.

Thus the fuze will function on impact if impact occurs before expiration of the set time. The time-setting can be eliminated altogether by turning the <b>setting</b> <b>ring</b> off the scale. It should be noted that the fuze is not interchangeable with fuzes used in other 8 cm mortar ammunition.|$|R
