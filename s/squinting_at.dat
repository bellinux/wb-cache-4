2500|$|On [...] "Something in the Way of Things (In Town)", Amiri Baraka {{performs}} {{a poem about}} how the spirit of death and decay permeates African-American urban experiences. Set to a fusion of several African-American music influences, his poem observes [...] "something {{in the way of}} our selves" [...] and uses unusual imagery such as death [...] "riding on top of the car peering through the windshield" [...] and a [...] "Negro <b>squinting</b> <b>at</b> us through the cage" [...] with a smile [...] "that ain't a smile but teeth flying against our necks".|$|E
2500|$|The Time Magazine {{reviewer}} {{wrote of}} the 2001 Broadway revival: [...] "Even in its more modest incarnation, Follies has, no question, the best score on Broadway." [...] He noted, though, that [...] "I'm sorry the cast was reduced from 52 to 38, the orchestra from 26 players to 14...To appreciate the revival, you must buy into James Goldman's book, which is peddling a panoramically bleak take on marriage." [...] Finally, he wrote:"But Follies never makes fun of the honorable musical tradition to which it belongs. The show and the score have a double vision: simultaneously <b>squinting</b> <b>at</b> the messes people make {{of their lives and}} wide-eyed at the lingering grace and lift of the music they want to hear. Sondheim's songs aren't parodies or deconstructions; they are evocations that recognize the power of a love song. In 1971 or 2001, Follies validates the legend that a Broadway show can be an event worth dressing up for." ...|$|E

5000|$|NPR's Ann Powers called Kristofferson's {{cover of}} [...] "Turpentine" [...] "A full-daylight <b>squint</b> <b>at</b> heartbreak".|$|R
60|$|Sam <b>squinted</b> <b>at</b> {{himself in}} the glass and added a touch of black to his nose.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, {{almost without}} warnin'; but not {{altogether}} without it. You heer'd the captain say he'd go an' take a <b>squint</b> <b>at</b> the glass?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Twelve {{hours had}} intervened since Bradley's lying down, {{when he got}} up. 'Not that I swaller it,' said Riderhood, <b>squinting</b> <b>at</b> his Lock, when he saw Bradley {{coming out of the}} house, 'as you've been a {{sleeping}} all the time, old boy!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'm {{glad you}}'re wet,' said Quilp, {{snatching}} it, and <b>squinting</b> <b>at</b> her. 'I'm glad you're cold. I'm glad {{you lost your}} way. I'm glad your eyes are red with crying. It does my heart good to see your little nose so pinched and frosty.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You wouldn't believe it, {{that you}} wouldn't,' replied his mother, 'but don't {{say a word}} to him, for I really don't believe he's human. Hush! Don't turn round as if I was talking of him, but he's a <b>squinting</b> <b>at</b> me now in the full blaze of the coach-lamp, quite awful!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "First-rate," [...] replied Tim, [...] "an' {{much the}} same as your own. I had a good <b>squint</b> <b>at</b> you before you awoke. Isn't the place splendacious?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{you take}} a <b>squint</b> <b>at</b> it every now and then," [...] I said. [...] "Just as soon as Emmeline leaves Prissy alone I'll hoist the signal." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "More than a breeze," [...] muttered the captain, while a look {{of grave}} anxiety overspread his countenance; [...] "I'll go below and take a <b>squint</b> <b>at</b> the glass." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Here {{comes the}} breeze," [...] exclaimed Manton, {{with a look}} of satisfaction. [...] "Now, look alive, lads; we shall be close on the nigger village in five minutes--it's just round the point of this small island close ahead. Come, Mr Scraggs, we've other {{business}} on hand just now than <b>squinting</b> <b>at</b> the scrimmages of these fellows." ...|$|E
6000|$|Edy Boardman was noticing it too {{because she}} was <b>squinting</b> <b>at</b> Gerty, half smiling, with her specs like an old maid, pretending to nurse the baby. Irritable little gnat she was and always would be {{and that was why}} no-one could get on with her poking her nose into what was no concern of hers. And she said to Gerty: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are going}} to spend a strange wittebroodsweek [white-bread-week, or, in other words, honeymoon], baas," [...] said Hans, <b>squinting</b> <b>at</b> me with his little eyes, as he brayed away at a {{buckskin}} which was to serve as a saddle-cloth. [...] "Now, if I was to be married to-morrow, I should stop with my pretty for a few days, and only ride off somewhere else when I was tired of her, especially if that somewhere else chanced to be Zululand, where they are so fond of killing people." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I'm {{pretty sure}} I haven't lost my bearings," [...] {{answered}} the old lumberman. [...] "However, to make sure, maybe I had {{better have a}} <b>squint</b> <b>at</b> my compass." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sure, an' thim haythins {{is up to}} {{all sorts}} av dodges," [...] cried Dan Casey. [...] "It's meself as would like to git a <b>squint</b> <b>at</b> th' feller that threw that." ...|$|R

6000|$|Well, {{stationed}} aft {{where their}} lordships [...] keep,-- Seldom going forward excepting to sleep,-- I, boozing now on by-gone years, My betters recall {{along with my}} peers. Recall them? Wife, but I see them plain: Alive, alert, every man stirs again. Ay, and again on the lee-side pacing, My spy-glass carrying, a truncheon in show, Turning at the taffrail, my footsteps retracing, Proud in my duty, again methinks I go. And Dave, Dainty Dave, I mark where he [...] stands, Our trim sailing-master, to time the high-noon, That thingumbob sextant perplexing eyes and [...] hands, <b>Squinting</b> <b>at</b> the sun, or twigging o' the moon; Then, touching his cap to Old Chock-a-Block Commanding the quarter-deck,--"Sir, twelve [...] o'clock." ...|$|E
6000|$|Hunting {{was equally}} a devotion, full of metaphysical {{concepts}} veiled from Carol. All winter he read sporting-catalogues, {{and thought about}} remarkable past shots: [...] "'Member that time when I got two ducks on a long chance, just at sunset?" [...] At {{least once a month}} he drew his favorite repeating shotgun, his [...] "pump gun," [...] from its wrapper of greased canton flannel; he oiled the trigger, and spent silent ecstatic moments aiming at the ceiling. Sunday mornings Carol heard him trudging up to the attic and there, an hour later, she found him turning over boots, wooden duck-decoys, lunch-boxes, or reflectively <b>squinting</b> <b>at</b> old shells, rubbing their brass caps with his sleeve and shaking his head as he thought about their uselessness.|$|E
60|$|Demi, finding {{business}} dull, solaced his leisure by photographing everybody {{he could}} induce to sit or stand to him, producing some excellent pictures among many failures; {{for he had}} a pretty taste in grouping, and endless patience. He might be said to view {{the world through the}} lens of his camera, and seemed to enjoy himself very much <b>squinting</b> <b>at</b> his fellow beings from under a bit of black cambric. Dan was a treasure to him; for he took well, and willingly posed in his Mexican costume, with horse and hound, and all wanted copies of these effective photographs. Bess, also, was a favourite sitter; and Demi received a prize at the Amateur Photographic Exhibition for one of his cousin with all her hair about her face, which rose from the cloud of white lace draping the shoulders. These were freely handed round by the proud artist; and one copy had a tender little history yet to be told.|$|E
60|$|Hardly had he spoken, when Silas Foster {{thrust his}} head, {{done up in}} a cotton handkerchief, out of another window, and took what he called as it {{literally}} was--a <b>squint</b> <b>at</b> us.|$|R
6000|$|... "Jest take a <b>squint</b> <b>at</b> these hoss tracks," [...] said Nels, and he drew Stillwell a {{few paces}} aside and pointed to large hoofprints in the dust. [...] "I reckon you know the hoss thet made them?" ...|$|R
60|$|None of 'em {{seemed to}} be in a hurry. Bill Jones took it up and bit it, and rang it on the table and <b>squinted</b> <b>at</b> it, and then he bit it agin, and turned round and asked Joe Barlcomb wot was wrong with it.|$|R
60|$|There {{were several}} people, young and old, {{standing}} about the door, {{some of whom}} cried with Mrs Lupin; while others tried to keep up a stout heart, as Tom did; and others were absorbed in admiration of Mr Pecksniff--a man who could build a church, as one may say, by <b>squinting</b> <b>at</b> a sheet of paper; and others were divided between that feeling and sympathy with Tom. Mr Pecksniff had appeared {{on the top of}} the steps, simultaneously with his old pupil, and while Tom was talking with Mrs Lupin kept his hand stretched out, as though he said 'Go forth!' When Tom went forth, and had turned the corner Mr Pecksniff shook his head, shut his eyes, and heaving a deep sigh, shut the door. On which, the best of Tom's supporters said he must have done some dreadful deed, or such a man as Mr Pecksniff never could have felt like that. If it had been a common quarrel (they observed), he would have said something, but when he didn't, Mr Pinch must have shocked him dreadfully.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! Baas," [...] {{said the}} Hottentot {{a little while}} later, <b>squinting</b> <b>at</b> me with his bead-like eyes, [...] "after all you did well to listen to my prayer and bring me with you. Old Hans is a drunkard, yes, {{or at least he}} used to be, and old Hans gambles, yes, and perhaps old Hans will go to hell. But {{meanwhile}} old Hans can think, as he thought one day before the attack on Maraisfontein, as he thought one day on the Hill of Slaughter by Dingaan's kraal, and as he thought this morning up there among the bushes. Oh! he knew how it must end. He saw that those dogs of Arabs were cutting down a tree to make a bridge across that deep stream and get round to the high ground at the back of you, whence they would have shot you all in five minutes. And now, Baas, my stomach feels very queer. There was no breakfast on the hillside and the sun was very hot. I think that just one tot of brandy--oh! I know, I promised not to drink, but if you give it me the sin is yours, not mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Near 'the big song,'" [...] Felix answered. [...] "There'll {{never be}} {{anything}} more English than Shakespeare, when all's said and done." [...] And {{he took a}} steady, sidelong squint at his companion. 'This is another of the types I've been looking for,' he reflected. The peculiar 'don't-quite-touch-me' accent of the aristocrat--and {{of those who would}} be--had almost left this particular one, as though he secretly aspired to rise superior and only employed it in the nervousness of his first greetings. 'Yes,' thought Felix, 'he's just about the very best we can do among those who sit upon 'the Land.' I would wager there's not a better landlord nor a better fellow in all his class, than this one. He's chalks away superior to Malloring, if I know anything of faces--would never have turned poor Tryst out. If this exception were the rule! And yet--! Does he, can he, go quite far enough to meet the case? If not--what hope of regeneration from above? Would he give up his shooting? Could he give up feeling he's a leader? Would he give up his town house and collecting whatever it is he collects? Could he let himself sink down and merge till he was just unseen leaven of good-fellowship and good-will, working in the common bread?' And <b>squinting</b> <b>at</b> that sincere, clean, charming, almost fine face, he answered himself unwillingly: 'He could not!' And suddenly {{he knew that he was}} face to face with the tremendous question which soon or late confronts all thinkers. Sitting beside him--was the highest product of the present system! With its charm, humanity, courage, chivalry up to a point, its culture, and its cleanliness, this decidedly rare flower at the end of a tall stalk, with dark and tortuous roots and rank foliage, was in a sense the sole justification of power wielded from above. And was it good enough? Was it quite good enough? Like so many other thinkers, Felix hesitated to reply. If only merit and the goods of this world could be finally divorced! If the reward of virtue were just men's love and an unconscious self-respect! If only 'to have nothing' were the highest honour! And yet, to do away with this beside him and put in its place--What? No kiss-me-quick change had a chance of producing anything better. To scrap the long growth of man and start afresh was but to say: 'Since in the past the best that man has done has not been good enough, I have a perfect faith in him for the future!' No! That was a creed for archangels and other extremists. Safer to work on what we had! And he began: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} taking a <b>squint</b> <b>at</b> the prison where I'm told your comrade is held, and am {{come to believe that}} unless these 'ere Britishers are much like weasels, it won't be such a hard thing {{to get him out of}} that scrape." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, and I {{might get}} a <b>squint</b> <b>at</b> my patient," [...] laughed the doctor, [...] "for he prefers to lie on an ottoman {{right at the end}} of the {{conservatory}} amid all those blood-red poinsettias; it would give me the creeps. But what are you doing?" ...|$|R
60|$|It was {{a pretty}} group in a pretty setting, and I thrilled with {{professional}} pride as I stepped back for a final, knowing <b>squint</b> <b>at</b> it all. Then I went to my camera, slipped in the plate, gave them due warning and took off the cap.|$|R
5000|$|From a New York Times article:Louisville (Kentucky), Tuesday, May 27, 1862:Col. C.L. DUNHAM, of the Fiftieth Indiana, at Bowling Green, is {{suspected}} and criticised by Unionists of Warren, {{members of his}} regiment, and the Bedford (Ind.) Press. He is charged with disloyal sympathies, <b>squinting</b> <b>at</b> treason, neglecting his duty, giving up to [...] "pleasurable indulgences," [...] abusing and insulting his men. If he can exculpate himself, well. If not, hell be cashiered.|$|E
50|$|A {{drawback}} of pixelization is {{that any}} differences between the large pixels can be exploited in moving images to reconstruct the original, unpixelized image; <b>squinting</b> <b>at</b> a pixelized, moving image can sometimes achieve a similar result. In both cases, integration of the large pixels over time allows smaller, more accurate pixels to be constructed in a still image result. Completely obscuring the censored area with pixels of a constant color or pixels of random colors escapes this drawback but can be more aesthetically jarring.|$|E

6000|$|... "Next {{thing to}} it," [...] {{returned}} Wemmick, [...] "I {{am going to}} Newgate. We are in a banker's-parcel case just at present, and I have been down the road taking a <b>squint</b> <b>at</b> the scene of action, and thereupon must have {{a word or two}} with our client." ...|$|R
