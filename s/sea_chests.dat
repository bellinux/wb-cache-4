5|$|Caprellamutica {{were first}} {{detected}} in New Zealand {{in the port}} of Timaru, South Island in 2002. This was the first incident of C.mutica being reported in the southern hemisphere. Since then, more well-established populations of C.mutica {{have been found in}} Port Lyttelton in 2006, and in the Marlborough Sounds and Wellington Harbour in 2007. Additional specimens were also recovered from the hulls of vessels in other ports, though they did not seem to have established colonies in the ports themselves. Genetic studies of the New Zealand populations suggests a possibility that these were secondarily introduced from non-native populations of C.mutica in the Atlantic through ballast water in the <b>sea</b> <b>chests</b> of international shipping.|$|E
60|$|The {{name of the}} bark, {{as found}} painted {{on some of the}} water barrels and <b>sea</b> <b>chests,</b> was the Bristol Merchant, and she no doubt hailed from England.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never saw}} a crew leave a ship so quietly. They sneaked over the rail one after another, {{taking care not to}} bang their <b>sea</b> <b>chests</b> too heavily. They looked our way, but not one had the stomach to come up and offer to shake hands with the mate as is usual.|$|E

6000|$|So, by {{the light}} of the wildly {{swinging}} slush-lamp, to the tumult on deck and to cries of [...] "She's sinking!" [...] I proceeded to ransack my sea-chest for suitable garments. Also, since they would never use them again, I ransacked the <b>sea</b> <b>chests</b> of my shipmates. Working quickly but collectedly, I took nothing but the warmest and stoutest of clothes. I put on the four best woollen shirts the forecastle boasted, three pairs of pants, and three pairs of thick woollen socks. So large were my feet thus incased that I could not put on my own good boots. Instead, I thrust on Nicholas Wilton's new boots, which were larger and even stouter than mine. Also, I put on Jeremy Nalor's pea jacket over my own, and, outside of both, put on Seth Richard's thick canvas coat which I remembered he had fresh-oiled only a short while previous.|$|E
50|$|The {{sea chest}} {{provides}} an intake reservoir from which piping systems draw raw water. Most <b>sea</b> <b>chests</b> {{are protected by}} removable gratings, and contain baffle plates to dampen the effects of vessel speed or sea state. The intake size of <b>sea</b> <b>chests</b> varies from less than 10 cm² to several square metres.|$|E
50|$|In 1966 Thalatta {{was entirely}} {{restored}} and re-rigged {{to take on}} a role as a schoolship under the flag of the East Coast Sail Trust. The barge's former cargo space was converted into communal living quarters where young people sleep in hammocks and keep their belongings in big wooden <b>sea</b> <b>chests.</b>|$|E

50|$|At the bow, all of {{the planks}} taper to butt the stem. The stem is carved from a single curved oak log to form the {{cutwater}} and has one land for each plank. The inside of the stem is hollowed into a v shape so {{the inside of the}} rivets can be reached during construction or repair. Each of the crossbeams has a ledge cut about 25 mm wide and deep to take a removable section of decking. <b>Sea</b> <b>chests</b> were placed on top of the decking to use when rowing. Most likely on longer voyages <b>sea</b> <b>chests</b> were secured below decks to act as ballast when sailing. The centre section of the keel has little rocker and together with flat midships transverse section the hull shape is suited to medium to flat water sailing. When sailing downwind in strong winds and waves, directional control would be poor, so it is likely that some reefing system was used to reduce sail area. In such conditions the ship would take water aboard at an alarming rate if sailed at high speed.|$|E
50|$|Longships {{were not}} fitted with benches. When rowing, the crew sat on <b>sea</b> <b>chests</b> (chests {{containing}} their personal possessions) {{that would otherwise}} take up space. The chests were made {{the same size and}} were the perfect height for a Viking to sit on and row. Longships had hooks for oars to fit into, but smaller oars were also used, with crooks or bends to be used as oarlocks. If there were no holes then a loop of rope kept the oars in place.|$|E
50|$|When {{the ship}} is in freshwater, the hard steel {{surfaces}} of the sea chest, protective grates and baffles, combined with low water velocities created in this immediate area, provide a suitable environment for zebra mussel attachment. Zebra mussel infestations {{have been found to}} clog the individual intakes and gates of the various water piping systems, decreasing the availability of water for onboard operations, which could result in damage to engines and other components that require water for cooling. <b>Sea</b> <b>chests</b> are, therefore, considered to be the most susceptible component to serious infestation.|$|E

5000|$|The museum {{created the}} central {{core of a}} ship {{depicting}} a mast, saloon, galley and cabins. The ships figureheads are on display along with the boats; the prominent figurehead displayed, a male figure, once decorated the ship, the [...] "California". In addition, nautical trappings, a number of ships in bottles and <b>sea</b> <b>chests</b> are also on display. Paintings of ships (docked either in Hull, Antwerp, Hong Kong or elsewhere), done by local artists who were specially commissioned by the captain of every ship, are exhibited in the museum. Models of ships of different time periods are displayed on a uniform scale so {{that the difference between}} a Baltic schooner and an ocean-going windjammer could be easily discerned.|$|E
5000|$|Sado Shima-dansu: These chests were prized {{as among}} the finest {{examples}} of tansu craftsmanship. With funa-dansu (<b>sea</b> <b>chests)</b> as an experience base, tansuyas {{in the town of}} Ogi on Sado Island applied their skill to creating both merchant and clothing chests from the later Edo Period. Other than using thick iron hardware incorporating a four diamonds motif cut into the drawer handle back plates, ogi-dansu often evidence ships' cabinet joinery, atypical of other tansu not crafted on the Japan Sea coast. Though late as a production center, tansu makers in the town of Yahata on Sado crafted Kiri chests primarily for the trousseau clothing of merchant families, with unique hardware from the early 20th century.|$|E
5000|$|An old sailor, {{calling himself}} [...] "the captain"—real name [...] "Billy" [...] Bones—comes to lodge at the Admiral Benbow Inn {{on the west}} English coast during the mid-1700s, paying Bob the innkeeper's son, Jim Hawkins, a few pennies to keep a lookout for a one-legged [...] "seafaring man". A seaman with intact legs shows up, {{frightening}} Billy—who drinks far too much rum—into a stroke, and Billy tells Jim that his former shipmates covet {{the contents of his}} <b>sea</b> <b>chest.</b> After a visit from yet another man, Billy has another stroke and dies; Jim and his mother (his father has also died just a few days before) unlock the <b>sea</b> <b>chest,</b> finding some money, a journal, and a map. The local physician, Dr. Livesey, deduces that the map is of an island where a deceased pirate—Captain Flint—buried a vast treasure. The district squire, Trelawney, proposes buying a ship and going after the treasure, taking Livesey as ship's doctor and Jim as cabin boy.|$|R
50|$|In the 19th and {{beginning}} 20th century, building dioramas of sailing ships {{had been a}} popular handcraft of mariners. Building a diorama instead of a normal model had the advantage that in the diorama, the model was protected inside the framework and could easily be stowed below the bunk or behind the <b>sea</b> <b>chest.</b> Nowadays, such antique sailing ship dioramas are valuable collectors' items.|$|R
50|$|Notable {{features}} of the museum include artefacts from Blake's life including his <b>sea</b> <b>chest.</b> The museum also illustrates Bridgwater's mercantile and marine past and includes important local historical {{events such as the}} Battle of Sedgmoor. As well as a diorama of the Battle of Sedgemoor, the new Battle gallery covers conflicts from the time of King Alfred, the English Civil War as well as the 20th century.|$|R
50|$|Control {{strategies}} include coating all surfaces with an antifoulant such as copper-based {{epoxy paint}} or hot-dip galvanizing. Periodic inspection and replacement of grates and screens also reduces the risk. Increasing {{the size of}} the <b>sea</b> <b>chests</b> by 20 to 30 percent may delay the onset of serious problems that could force an engine shutdown. Thermal treatment is a highly effective strategy for the control of zebra mussels (McMahon et al. 1995). Thermal treatment may include retrofitting a closed loop system to recirculate the heated water to the sea chest or the addition of a second sea chest system, allowing engine cooling water to be discharged through the idle sea chest. Recirculation of engine cooling water as a thermal control strategy has proved extremely effective in controlling zebra mussels (Palermo 1992, U.S. Coast Guard 1994).|$|E
50|$|If M. citrina {{arrived in}} the Pacific {{with the help of}} man there are several possibilities. It is {{unlikely}} to survive in ballast water but may have been transported in the sea chest of a vessel, a recess on the hull covered with a grill and used for the intake of sea water for ballast, firefighting, engine cooling and other purposes. <b>Sea</b> <b>chests</b> house a community of organisms that would be unlikely to survive as fouling animals on the vessel's hull. M. citrina may have {{arrived in the}} Pacific in one of these, perhaps via the Northwest Passage. Being a cold water species, it is unlikely this species would have arrived via the Caribbean Sea and Panama Canal where the water temperature would be outside the tunicate's survival range.|$|E
50|$|Not all {{ships are}} built to an ice class. Building a ship to an ice class {{means that the}} hull must be thicker, and more {{scantlings}} (aggregate of girders, beams, and bulkheads resulting in stronger structural integrity) must be in place. <b>Sea</b> <b>chests</b> (openings in the hull for seawater intake) {{may need to be}} arranged differently depending on the class. Sea bays may also be required to ensure that the sea chest does not become blocked with ice. Most of the stronger classes require several forms of rudder and propeller protection. Two rudder pintles are usually required, and strengthened propeller tips are often required in the stronger ice classes. More watertight bulkheads, in addition to those required by a ship's normal class, are usually required. In addition, heating arrangements for fuel tanks, ballast tanks, and other tanks vital to the ship's operation may also be required depending on the class.|$|E
50|$|A young Gordon Griffith {{dropped a}} {{significant}} number of silver items of cutlery down the well in the late 1950s, so that he could hear the 'plop' sound as they hit the water. The well was covered with a large sandstone slab in those days, with a small hole at the front leading edge.Commander Whalley's old <b>sea</b> <b>chest</b> is entailed with the house as a memorial to the Whalley family.|$|R
50|$|At {{approximately}} 21:30 UTC+2, while off the Wild Coast of the Transkei, {{a muffled}} explosion was heard and the Oceanos lost her power following a leak {{in the engine}} room's <b>sea</b> <b>chest.</b> The chief engineer reported to Captain Avranas that water was entering the hull and flooding the generator room. The generators were shut down because the rising water would have short circuited them. The ship was left adrift.|$|R
50|$|On {{the night}} of May 29, 1873, Gayles sailed out into New York Harbor with Bum Mahoney and Billy Woods with the {{intention}} of raiding the brig Margaret while waiting to be loaded with cargo. While successfully sneaking on board, the captain and two crew members were awakened while the three river pirates were attempting to open a <b>sea</b> <b>chest.</b> After fighting with the crew, the three men were forced to flee and managed to sail away disappearing in the fog.|$|R
50|$|After a {{difficult}} passage around Cape Horn, the Essex {{arrived in the}} Pacific Ocean in January 1820. On 20 November 1820, in a remote area of the ocean, some 1500 nmi km west of the Galapagos Islands, the Essex was struck twice by a huge sperm whale, estimated to be 85 ft in length. With only three shipkeepers and the crew of Chase's whaleboat on board to repair their damaged vessel, the Essex began taking on water following the second collision with the whale. The crew abandoned the sinking vessel, taking the navigational equipment and Pollard's and Chase's <b>sea</b> <b>chests</b> with them. Meanwhile, Pollard and Joy were hunting smaller whales near the ship, and on their return found the Essex had capsized. The crew chopped off the masts (a necessary move that would enable the ship to stay upright for a longer time) and outfitted the whaleboats with sails and masts using the Essex's spars and sails. They also hastened to retrieve what provisions they could and divided them equally so that each whaleboat had 200 pounds of hardtack, 65 gallons of freshwater, and two Galapagos tortoises. The crew was divided into three whaleboats commanded by Pollard, Chase, and Joy and set sail with provisions estimated to last them 60 days. Pollard, Chase, and Joy set up a council to decide which direction to sail in. The closest islands were the Marquesas Islands, about 1200 mi west of their position but in those days the inhabitants there were believed to practice cannibalism. Pollard suggested sailing to the Society Islands, which were further away but presumed to be safer. However, {{on the grounds that}} very little was actually known about these islands, Chase and Joy disagreed, proposing instead to sail south far enough to pick up a band of variable breezes that would take them to South America. Once again, Captain Pollard reluctantly yielded to their arguments.|$|E

60|$|When Doctor Walker had departed, the Admiral packed all his {{possessions}} {{back into his}} <b>sea</b> <b>chest</b> {{with the exception of}} one little brass-bound desk. This he unlocked, and took from it a dozen or so blue sheets of paper all mottled over with stamps and seals, with very large V. R.'s printed upon the heads of them. He tied these carefully into a small bundle, and placing them in the inner pocket of his coat, he seized his stick and hat.|$|R
25|$|The {{most likely}} {{reason for the}} {{overheating}} of the port engine was the plate heat exchanger getting clogged by small pieces of coal that had washed overboard from the cargo hold and entered the cooling system via the port side <b>sea</b> <b>chest.</b> The starboard engine was not affected because it used a separate sea water intake {{in the bottom of}} the vessel. Another possible cause was the development of hairline cracks in the cylinder liner or head due to large variations in engine load, allowing hot exhaust gases to mix with the cooling water.|$|R
