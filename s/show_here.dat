25|$|Theatre PANIK staged {{the play}} at Tarragon Theatre in Toronto, opening May 29, 2008 with Bethany Jillard {{performing}} the role. All four local daily papers gave {{the play and}} the actress enthusiastic reviews, but the theatre critic Lynn Slotkin in CBC Toronto radio <b>show</b> <b>Here</b> and Now was highly critical of {{every aspect of the}} play.|$|E
25|$|Consider a {{truck on}} frictionless, {{straight}} rails. Initially, {{the truck is}} stationary at position 0, but it is buffeted {{this way and that}} by random uncontrolled forces. We measure the position of the truck every Δt seconds, but these measurements are imprecise; we want to maintain a model of where the truck is and what its velocity is. We <b>show</b> <b>here</b> how we derive the model from which we create our Kalman filter.|$|E

[...] "I do plan on {{spending a lot of}} time in this community," [...] he told local reporters months before his historic walk. [...] "This isn't a one-off event where I'll show up and do an event and be gone. I would like to make this my second home and bring a full-time <b>show</b> <b>here</b> that I would be performing throughout the season along with all my family members as well." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1991, as {{a result}} of lawsuits, {{electronic}} chimes, using a descending three-note arpeggio (either G-E-C ], , or between one or two semitones lower (F♯-D♯-B [...] or F-D-B♭ [...] )) and a flashing pair of orange lights above the doorway, added for the hearing impaired, were tested and gradually introduced system-wide during the 1990s. [...] The Toronto Rocket trains use the same door chimes and flashing orange lights as the older trains do, and also plays the additional voice announcement, [...] "Please stand clear of the doors". Those chimes have become synonymous with the TTC and Toronto {{to the point that the}} CBC Radio One local afternoon <b>show,</b> <b>Here</b> and Now, includes them in its theme music.|$|E

"I {{might as}} well be a {{grasshopper}} if I'm to skip round like this," [...] she said, forgetting to feel tired out there in the pleasant garden, with the robins picking berries close by, and a cool wind lifting the leaves to <b>show</b> <b>here</b> the reddest and ripest ones hid.|$|E

There are no large trees, but a bright green jungle of small ones and bushes, many of which are very rare and curious. Luculia Pinceana makes a gorgeous <b>show</b> <b>here</b> in October.|$|E

They had {{two faces}} apiece; {{not to show}} that they were of a double heart, for 'their {{appearances}} and themselves' were the same, and 'they went every one straight forward' (Eze 10:22). These two faces, then, were to <b>show</b> <b>here</b> the quickness of their apprehension, and their terribleness to execute the mind of God. The face of a man signifies them masters of reason; the face of a lion, the terribleness of their presence (1 Cor 13:12; Judg 13:6).|$|E

60|$|These {{presents}} {{remind us}} that while Europe in the ninth century was still a weltering disorder of war and pillage, there flourished a great Arab Empire in Egypt and Mesopotamia, far more civilized than anything Europe could <b>show.</b> <b>Here</b> literature and science still lived; the arts flourished, and the mind of man could move without fear or superstition. And even in Spain and North Africa where the Saracenic dominions were falling into political confusion there was a vigorous intellectual life. Aristotle was read and discussed by these Jews and Arabs during these centuries of European darkness. They guarded the neglected seeds of science and philosophy.|$|E
