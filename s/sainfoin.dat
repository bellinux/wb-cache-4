25|$|Post-war, <b>Sainfoin</b> {{assisted}} in mopping up {{operations in the}} Dutch East Indies. On one occasion, a pregnant woman went into labour whilst men from <b>Sainfoin</b> were assisting in one such operation. She {{was transferred to the}} ship for medical attention. A healthy baby boy was born on board. He was given the name <b>Sainfoin.</b> <b>Sainfoin</b> was at Singapore when the news came through that she was to be paid off. She sailed the following day, her destination was Greenock. A number of her crew volunteered for service on the voyage to return the ship to the United States, but their request was denied.|$|E
25|$|On 16 October 1945, during Sainfoins voyage {{back to the}} United Kingdom, <b>Sainfoin</b> {{received}} a distress call from the hospital ship , which was carrying 820 repatriated prisoners of war from Hong Kong to Madras, India. It took <b>Sainfoin</b> four hours to reach Takliwa, which had run aground at Indira Point, Great Nicobar, and caught fire. Using her LCAs, <b>Sainfoin</b> rescued all 1,083 people on board Takliwa, {{as well as the}} ship's cat. During the rescue, three of Sainfoins LCAs were lost. Sainfoins mascot, a baboon named Mortimer, took a liking to the cat. On arrival at Bombay, the cat promptly went ashore. Mortimer's intended fate was to be given to a zoo in the United Kingdom, but he grew too big and dangerous so he was euthanased before <b>Sainfoin</b> reached the United Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|HMS <b>Sainfoin</b> was a Landing Ship, Infantry of the Royal Navy {{that was}} built in 1943 by Consolidated Steel Corporation, Wilmington, California, United States as the {{merchant}} vessel Cape Washington. She {{was transferred to the}} Ministry of War Transport in 1944 and renamed Empire Crossbow. Later that year, she was requisitioned by the Royal Navy and commissioned as HMS <b>Sainfoin,</b> with the pennant number F183. In 1946, she was returned to merchant service as Empire Crossbow. She was transferred to the United States in 1947 and renamed Cape Washington. The ship was then laid up until scrapped in 1964.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sainfoins</b> {{are mostly}} {{subtropical}} plants, but their range extends throughout Europe {{as far north}} as southern Sweden. These plants grow on grassland, agricultural land and wasteland. The leaves are pinnate, alternate, with 6 to 14 pairs of oblong to linear leaflets. <b>Sainfoins</b> have pale pink flowers, typically blooming between June and September and pollinated by honey bees and solitary bees. The rounded single-seeded pods bear prominent spikes or similar protrusions in many species, enabling them to cling to the fur of large mammals and be thus distributed.|$|R
50|$|Main host {{plants are}} various legumes (Fabaceae), {{especially}} common broom (Sarothamnus scoparius) and dyer’s greenweed (Genista tinctoria), but also alfalfa (Medicago sativa), vetches (Vicia species), sweet-clover (Melilotus species), crownvetches (Coronilla species) <b>sainfoins</b> (Onobrychis species), lupin (Lupinus species) and others.|$|R
50|$|These highly nutritious {{plants were}} an {{important}} forage for heavy working horses in agriculture, {{and are still}} {{an excellent source of}} nectar for honey production as well as pollen for bee food. Because <b>sainfoins</b> are rich in tannins which protect proteins from hydrolysis in the rumen, the proteins are instead absorbed in the abomasum. Onobrychis typically have a deep taproot and so are very drought resistant, but do not recover well from overgrazing. Adapted to slow but steady growth in the arid steppe belt of Eurasia, <b>sainfoins</b> are difficult to establish as pasture, are not persistent in grassland, and only yield one crop of hay or seeds per year. Thus they are seldom grown in any significant extent, though O. viciifolia is met with somewhat more regularly.|$|R
25|$|HMS <b>Sainfoin</b> was {{returned}} to merchant service, with the name reverting to Empire Crossbow in September 1946. She {{was returned}} to the United States in September 1946 and re-entered merchant service under her original name, Cape Washington, the following year. She was laid up in the James River until 1964, when she was sold on 1 December for $47,206 to Peck Iron & Metal Co for dismantling. Cape Washington was scrapped at Portsmouth, Virginia.|$|E

5000|$|Biologist Murat Nurushev {{suggested}} that the cause might be acute ruminal tympany, whose symptoms (bloating, mouth foaming and diarrhea) had been observed in dead saiga antelopes. According to Nurushev, this disease occurred {{as a result of}} foraging on a large amount of easily fermenting plants (alfalfa, clover, <b>sainfoins</b> and mixed wet green grass). [...] In May 2015, the United Nations agency which is involved in saiga conservation efforts issued a statement that the mass die-off had ended. As of June 2015, no definitive cause for the epizootic has been found.|$|R
40|$|Steppe-like {{habitats}} in Europe {{are seriously}} threatened {{as a result}} of fragmentation and anthropogenic degradation, at least in western and central parts. Considering the dramatic loss of steppe-like habitats, the evaluation of genetic variation in populations of steppe species is of immediate importance if appropriate conservation measures are to be undertaken. In this paper, we examine the genetic diversity of the highly endangered populations of the leaf-beetle Cheilotoma musciformis, which inhabits only a limited area in south-central Poland, which is geographically isolated from the continuous range of this species. Both mitochondrial and nuclear markers show that the Polish populations are distinct from Slovakian and Ukrainian ones. These regional populations should be considered independent conservation units. On the other hand, very little (mtDNA) or no (nuclear DNA) diversity has been found among the Polish subpopulations. This leads to the conclusion that this species has gone through a strong bottleneck leading to a drastic reduction in its genetic diversity prior to the establishment of present-day populations. Host plants have been identified for this species using barcodes, and the only hosts for the Polish and Ukrainian samples are <b>sainfoins</b> Onobrychis spp. while for the Slovakian sample it is either Dorycnium pentaphyllum or Lotus spp. (all Fabaceae). All of these data can be very valuable for the conservation of C. musciformis populations (e. g. for reintroductions) ...|$|R

60|$|The {{shepherd}} related {{a curious}} instance in a mole. He once noticed mole-heaps of a peculiar kind {{in a field}} of <b>sainfoin,</b> and it looked to him as if this mole worked in a way of his own, quite unlike the others. The hills he threw up were a good distance apart, and so large that you could fill a bushel measure with the mould from any one of them. He noticed that this mole went on burrowing every day in the same manner; every morning there were new chains or ranges of the huge mounds. The runs were very deep, as he found when setting a mole-trap--over two feet beneath the surface. He set his trap, filling the deep hole he had made with sods, and on opening it next day he found his mole and was astonished at its great size. He took no measurements, but it was bigger, he affirmed, than he could have believed it possible for a mole to be. And it was grey instead of black, the grey hairs being so abundant on the head as to make it almost white, {{as in the case of}} old Watch. He supposed that it was a very old mole, that it was a more powerful digger than most of its kind, and had perhaps escaped death so long on account of its strength and of its habit of feeding deeper in the earth than the others.|$|E
60|$|Trifolium pratense.--One hundred flower-heads {{on plants}} {{protected}} by a net did not produce a single seed, whilst 100 heads on plants growing outside, which were visited by bees, yielded 68 grains weight of seeds; and as eighty seeds weighed two grains, the 100 heads must have yielded 2720 seeds. I have often watched this plant, and have never seen hive-bees sucking the flowers, except from the outside through holes bitten by humble-bees, or deep down between the flowers, as if in search of some secretion from the calyx, almost {{in the same manner}} as described by Mr. Farrer, in the case of Coronilla ('Nature' 1874 July 2 page 169). I must, however, except one occasion, when an adjoining field of <b>sainfoin</b> (Hedysarum onobrychis) had just been cut down, and when the bees seemed driven to desperation. On this occasion most of the flowers of the clover were somewhat withered, and contained an extraordinary quantity of nectar, which the bees were able to suck. An experienced apiarian, Mr. Miner, says that in the United States hive-bees never suck the red clover; and Mr. R. Colgate informs me that he has observed the same fact in New Zealand after the introduction of the hive-bee into that island. On the other hand, H. Muller ('Befruchtung' page 224) has often seen hive-bees visiting this plant in Germany, for the sake both of pollen and nectar, which latter they obtained by breaking apart the petals. It is at least certain that humble-bees are the chief fertilisers of the common red clover.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{found my}} {{existence}} so charming, and led a life so [...] agreeable to my humour, that I resolved here to end my days. [...] My {{only source of}} disquiet was whether I should be allowed [...] to carry my project out. In {{the midst of the}} presentiments [...] that disturbed me, I would fain have had them make a [...] perpetual prison of my refuge, to confine me in it for all [...] the rest of my life. I longed for them to cut off all chance [...] and all hope of leaving it; to forbid me holding any [...] communication with the mainland, so that, knowing nothing [...] {{of what was going on}} in the world, I might have forgotten [...] the world's existence, and people might have forgotten mine [...] too. They only suffered me to pass two months in the island, [...] but I could have passed two years, two centuries, and all [...] eternity, without a moment's weariness, though I had not, [...] with my companion, any other society than that of the [...] steward, his wife, and their servants. They were in truth [...] honest souls and nothing more, but that was just what I [...] wanted.... Carried thither in a violent hurry, alone and [...] without a thing, I afterwards sent for my housekeeper, my [...] books, and my scanty possessions, of which I had the delight [...] of unpacking nothing, leaving my boxes and chests just as [...] they had come, and dwelling in the house where I counted on [...] ending my days, exactly as if it were an inn whence I must [...] needs set forth on the morrow. All things went so well, just [...] as they were, that to think of ordering them better were to [...] spoil them. One of my greatest joys was to leave my books [...] safely fastened up in their boxes, and to be without even a [...] case for writing. When any luckless letter forced me to take [...] up a pen for an answer, I grumblingly borrowed the steward's [...] inkstand, and hurried to give it back to him with all the [...] haste I could, in the vain hope that I should never have [...] need of the loan any more. Instead of meddling with those [...] weary quires and reams and piles of old books, I filled my [...] chamber with flowers and grasses, for I was then in my first [...] fervour for botany. Having given up employment that would be [...] a task to me, I needed one that would be an amusement, nor [...] cause me more pains than a sluggard might choose to take. I [...] undertook to make the Flora petrinsularis, and to describe [...] every single plant on the island, in detail enough to occupy [...] me for the rest of my days. In consequence of this fine [...] scheme, every morning after breakfast, which we all took in [...] company, I used to go with a magnifying glass in my hand and [...] my Systema Naturæ under my arm, to visit some district of [...] the island. I had divided it for that purpose into small [...] squares, meaning to go through them one after another in [...] each season of the year. At the end of two or three hours I [...] used to return laden with an ample harvest, a provision for [...] amusing myself after dinner indoors, in case of rain. I [...] spent the rest of the morning in going with the steward, his [...] wife, and Theresa, to see the labourers and the harvesting, [...] and I generally set to work along with them; many a time [...] when people from Berne came to see me, they found me perched [...] on a high tree, with a bag fastened round my waist; I kept [...] filling it with fruit and then let it down to the ground [...] with a rope. The exercise I had taken in the morning and the [...] good humour that always comes from exercise, made the repose [...] of dinner vastly pleasant to me. But if dinner was kept up [...] too long, and fine weather invited me forth, I could not [...] wait, but was speedily off to throw myself all alone into a [...] boat, which, when the water was smooth enough, I used to [...] pull out to the middle of the lake. There, stretched at full [...] length in the boat's bottom, with my eyes turned up to the [...] sky, I let myself float slowly hither and thither as the [...] water listed, sometimes for hours together, plunged in a [...] thousand confused delicious musings, which, though they had [...] no fixed nor constant object, were not the less on that [...] account a hundred times dearer to me than all that I had [...] found sweetest in what they call the pleasures of life. [...] Often warned by the going down of the sun that it was time [...] to return, I found myself so far from the island that I was [...] forced to row with all my might to get in before it was [...] pitch dark. At other times, instead of losing myself in the [...] midst of the waters, I had a fancy to coast along the green [...] shores of the island, where the clear waters and cool [...] shadows tempted me to bathe. But one of my most frequent [...] expeditions was from the larger island to the less; there I [...] disembarked and spent my afternoon, sometimes in mimic [...] rambles among wild elders, persicaries, willows, and shrubs [...] of every species, sometimes settling myself on the top of a [...] sandy knoll, covered with turf, wild thyme, flowers, even [...] <b>sainfoin</b> and trefoil that had most likely been sown there in [...] old days, making excellent quarters for rabbits. They might [...] multiply in peace without either fearing anything or harming [...] anything. I spoke of this to the steward. He at once had [...] male and female rabbits brought from Neuchâtel, and we went [...] in high state, his wife, one of his sisters, Theresa, and I, [...] to settle them in the little islet. The foundation of our [...] colony was a feast-day. The pilot of the Argonauts was not [...] prouder than I, as I bore my company and the rabbits in [...] triumph from our island to the smaller one....|$|E

50|$|An animal diet {{containing}} common <b>sainfoin</b> is able {{to reduce}} nematode (e.g. Haemonchus contortus) parasitism in ruminant’s guts.

Especially in goat and sheep production systems feeding of O. viciifolia is a promising alternative or complement to synthetic drugs.Besides these anthelmintic properties diets containing common <b>sainfoin</b> can lead to increasing daily weight gains of small ruminants.
