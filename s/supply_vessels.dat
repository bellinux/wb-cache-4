5|$|Japanese {{strategic}} {{plans for a}} decisive battle with the U.S. fleet were already established by September 1944. Anticipating the various options open to American landing forces, the Japanese operational order, code named Sho ("victory"), provided four scenarios to counter an invasion anywhere between the Philippines and the Kuriles. The plan was problematic for morale, however, because it broke with IJN tradition by assigning overriding importance to sinking U.S. <b>supply</b> <b>vessels</b> rather than U.S. warships. As a result, the Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet Admiral Soemu Toyoda flew out to the front in early October to rally the troops behind Sho.|$|E
5|$|When an {{aircraft}} carrier deploys, it takes a Strike Group, made up of several other warships and <b>supply</b> <b>vessels</b> which allow the operation to be carried out. The armament of the Nimitz class is made up only of short range defensive weapons, used as a {{last line of defense}} against enemy missiles and aircraft. An aircraft carrier, as with all surface ships, is particularly vulnerable to attack from below, specifically from submarines. An aircraft carrier is a very expensive, hard to replace and strategically valuable asset and therefore logically has a huge target value.|$|E

25|$|After Foote had flatly {{rejected}} Pope's {{request that}} gunboats run past Island No. 10, someone on Pope's staff suggested that perhaps a canal {{could be cut}} to enable Union vessels to bypass the batteries. The canal was completed in two weeks, {{but it was not}} deep enough to provide passage for the gunboats. It proved useful, nevertheless, in that transports and <b>supply</b> <b>vessels</b> could use it, so that Pope did not have to depend on land communications.|$|E
25|$|The Rosia Water Tanks {{consisted}} of six parallel underground chambers built by contractor Giovanni Maria Boschetti {{adjacent to the}} Victualling Yard of bricks brought from Britain and sand-lime mortar, then waterproofed. The roofs of the Victualling Yard served as a catchment directing rain to a settlement tank, which was then purified by flowing it successively from one tank to the next. The lowest tank was sufficiently high to gravity feed vessels berthed at Rosia Mole. Hoses were used to <b>supply</b> <b>vessels</b> within Rosia Bay, a lighter barge those anchored off it in Gibraltar Harbour.|$|E

25|$|With their {{flagship}} taken, the French fleet {{headed back}} to Calais. Encouraged, the English attacked, using ramming, grappling, and rigging-cutting to disable the enemy vessels. The nine surviving troopships got away, {{but most of the}} smaller vessels fell prey to the English mariners. As few as 15 ships escaped from the rampaging English. The French troopships owed their deliverance to their train of <b>supply</b> <b>vessels</b> because the English turned aside to plunder the smaller craft. The French sailors were slaughtered or thrown into the Channel, except for two or three men on each captured vessel who were spared.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of November 4, Undine and the Confederate {{batteries}} were attacked by three Union gunboats from Johnsonville and the six Paducah gunboats. Undine was abandoned and set on fire, which caused her ammunition magazine to explode, ending Forrest's brief career as a naval commander. Despite this loss, the Confederate land artillery was completely effective in neutralizing {{the threat of the}} Federal fleets. Forrest's guns bombarded the Union supply depot and the 28 steamboats and barges positioned at the wharf. All three of the Union gunboats were disabled or destroyed. The Union garrison commander ordered that the <b>supply</b> <b>vessels</b> be burned to prevent their capture by the Confederates.|$|E

25|$|The first {{double acting}} icebreaking vessel, Azipod-equipped river {{icebreaker}} Röthelstein, was delivered in 1995. The vessel {{was designed to}} break apart ice ridges deeper than the vessel's draft when moving astern. It was followed by icebreaking platform <b>supply</b> <b>vessels</b> Arcticaborg and Antarcticaborg, delivered in 1998, that were the first vessels to fully utilize the double acting ship concept by having the bow designed for operation in open water and light ice conditions. The vessels were designed {{to be capable of}} breaking level ice up to one meter in thickness when running astern and, with the help of two Azipod units, penetrate ice ridges that in the Caspian Sea sometimes reach to the seabed.|$|E
25|$|Only {{six days}} after the {{agreement}} {{for the formation of}} the company was signed between STX Finland Cruise Oy and United Shipbuilding Corporation on 10 December 2010, the newly founded Arctech Helsinki Shipyard received an order for two multipurpose icebreaking <b>supply</b> <b>vessels</b> from the Russian state-owned shipping company Sovcomflot. The value of the shipbuilding contract was US$200 million and the construction of the vessels would provide work for 1,000 man-years. Initially, both ships were set to be delivered to the customer in April 2013, after which they will be used for standby, supply and ice management of an offshore platform operated by Exxon Neftegas Limited in the Arkutun-Dagi offshore oil field, located in the Sea of Okhotsk.|$|E
25|$|The {{supply convoy}} sailed into Gibraltar on January 19, driving the smaller blockading fleet {{to retreat to}} the safety of Algeciras. Rodney arrived several days later, and the British {{garrison}} was heartened by the arrival of the supplies and the presence of Prince William Henry. Upon the return of the ships from Menorca, Rodney put to sea again on February 13, for the West Indies, the detachment from the Channel fleet accompanied him three days' sail on his way, and then parted for Britain with the prizes. On this return voyage it fell in with fifteen French <b>supply</b> <b>vessels,</b> convoyed by two sixty-fours, bound for the Ile de France, in the Indian Ocean, one of the ships of war, the Protée, and three of the storeships were taken.|$|E

25|$|The {{state-owned}} {{shipping company}} Arctia Shipping Oy and its predecessors have been heavily criticized {{over the years}} for the financial losses from the offshore business. Due to design compromises the Finnish multipurpose icebreakers are unable to compete with purpose-built platform <b>supply</b> <b>vessels</b> — the open-water performance of the spoon-shaped bow is very poor due to slamming. As a result, the ships have been left without contracts and have spent {{long periods of time}} in foreign ports even during the Finnish winter navigation season, forcing the Finnish Government to hire icebreakers from the commercial market to keep the ports open. However, according to an internal memorandum of the Finnish Maritime Administration, the offshore business, while not profitable, has covered {{at least some of the}} expenses from icebreaking during the winter seasons in the late 1990s, resulting in lower overall operating costs for the multipurpose icebreakers than for traditional icebreakers.|$|E
25|$|Most of the whalers were Norwegian, with an {{increasing}} proportion of Britons. During the whaling era, the population usually varied from over 1000 {{in the summer}} (over 2000 in some years) to some 200 in the winter. At {{the height of the}} whaling industry about 6000 men, mostly Norwegians and Swedes, worked at the stations and, with the men working on the whale-catchers, factory ships and <b>supply</b> <b>vessels,</b> there could be three times the population when the whaling fleets were at anchor in the harbours. The first census conducted by the British Stipendiary Magistrate James Wilson on 31 December 1909 recorded a total population of 720, including 3 females and 1 child. Of them, 579 were Norwegian, 58 Swedes, 32 Britons, 16 Danes, 15 Finns, 9 Germans, 7 Russians, 2 Dutchmen, 1 Frenchman and 1 Austrian. In subsequent available censuses the population was 1337(24th April 1921), and 709(26th April 1931, includes the South Shetland Islands).|$|E
25|$|Seaborne piracy against {{transport}} vessels {{remains a}} significant issue (with estimated worldwide losses of US$16billion per year), {{particularly in the}} waters between the Red Sea and Indian Ocean, off the Somali coast, {{and also in the}} Strait of Malacca and Singapore, which are used by over 50,000 commercial ships a year. In the Gulf of Guinea, maritime piracy has also led to pressure on offshore oil and gas production, providing security for offshore installations and <b>supply</b> <b>vessels</b> is often paid for by oil companies rather than the respective governments. In the late 2000s, the emergence of piracy off the coast of Somalia spurred a multi-national effort led by the United States to patrol the waters near the Horn of Africa. In 2011, Brazil also created an anti-piracy unit on the Amazon River. Sir Peter Blake, a New Zealand world champion yachtsman, had been killed by pirates on the Amazon river in 2001.|$|E

40|$|The {{difference}} between the different extremal snap-loads for the different load locations on the <b>supply</b> <b>vessel</b> deck are found to increase with an increasing pitch motion amplitude. Hence will the maximum lifting potential occur for the most common conditions at Haltenbanken. The difference for the floating platform between a midship location and a location in the stern end of the <b>supply</b> <b>vessel</b> deck is 26 % for a significant wave height of 3 meters. The effect of the wave heading is analysed for the floating platform. The lowest snap-loads are found for a 45 degrees wave heading {{in the range from}} 0 to 90 degrees. However, the deviations are only significant for the higher range of the significant wave heights. Based on the findings in the analyses, an offshore crane load-chart calculation procedure is proposed. It it suggested that the vertical motions of the <b>supply</b> <b>vessel</b> is estimated by several cameras, and that the corresponding extremal snap-loads to be expected for different load locations establishes the load-chart. This will be much more feasible and accurate than basing the load-charts on the motions of a worst-case <b>supply</b> <b>vessel</b> design. </p...|$|R
