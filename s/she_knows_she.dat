They didn't tell me {{they were going to do}} this, but they told Jon to hold my hand and not let it go. Then he did, and I lost it. Every single one of those tears were absolutely real.

He asserted that he never cut her off and never would, because it would be [...] "wrong in the eyes of God."

500|$|Ryan B. Patrick of Exclaim! {{noted that}} {{songs in the}} vein of [...] "Partition" [...] {{effectively}} display genre diversity, Beyoncé's vocal range and [...] "a penchant of musical experimentation". Matthew Perpetua of BuzzFeed praised the French spoken section on [...] "Partition", comparing it to the Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie sample on [...] "Flawless" [...] as she added: [...] "It's good that these ideas aren't directly expressed by Beyoncé herself– in context, these bits are like reblogged quotes that frame her artistic intentions– because <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>she</b> doesn’t need to be so didactic when she's actually singing about sex, {{and to do so}} would defeat her point about owning her pleasures." [...] Caitlin White of The 405 wrote extensively of [...] "Partition" [...] as a song that effectively shows that Beyoncé [...] "catapults herself out of her very femininity into personhood by positioning female sexuality as a powerful, amorphous construct--one that transcends the female body even while uplifting it." [...] White concluded that the singer does not exalt herself to become [...] "the highest sex object or an egotistical pop princess" [...] but anoints herself [...] "as sexual goddess, she is at once desiring and desired, fulfilled and fulfilling". Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times wrote that [...] "the spooky, almost perversely stripped-down 'Partition' reflect [...] determination, rare among superstars, to keep pushing creatively".|$|E
500|$|While {{writing the}} scene with Meredith and Shepherd fighting, Rater {{explained}} that she was intending to show how they matured, adding: [...] "This is a real grown-up argument. Meredith isn't running away, getting all dark and going to Cristina for help getting out of her marriage. She's staying and fighting." [...] While writing the episode, writers intended {{the theme of the}} episode to be [...] "exposure", but after the episode was filmed, realized it was [...] "ambition". Rater commented on this: [...] "Derek wants to be Chief; Meredith wants to do a procedure that <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>she</b> isn’t ready for; Cristina wants Teddy to stay." [...] In the episode, Oh's character asked her fellow residents if they would choose love or surgery, if need be, with Stevens choosing love and Yang and Meredith choosing surgery. The Grey Anatomy staff offered the insight: [...] "When we were first discussing this story we had a knock down drag out fight in the writers' room – if you had to choose your love or your art, which would you choose? And some of us came down on the Cristina side, and some of us came down on the Izzie side – that in the end love is all that matters." [...] At the conclusion of the episode, Karev ended his marriage to Stevens. Rater expressed that the writers decided to have the fictional couple break-up, because Stevens wasn't sick anymore, and Karev would not have left her when she was.|$|E

Ben offers Locke the opportunity to join the Others, but only if he kills Cooper; Ben knows he won't kill in cold blood, and so makes the offer as a way to humiliate Locke. Locke returns a few days later with Cooper's corpse, having used Sawyer to do the deed for him, so Ben takes him to meet Jacob. When Ben discovers Locke can hear Jacob, he shoots Locke and leaves him for dead.
