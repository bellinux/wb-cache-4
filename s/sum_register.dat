30|$|In {{the input}} Bayer pattern, {{the number of}} G pixels is twice those of the R or B pixels. As the WB process {{requires}} {{the average of the}} entire image, it is possible to use the data of only half of the G pixels without incurring a significant error; therefore, when the GWA was applied, only half of the G pixels were used so that the GWA equaled the calculation amounts of R and B. Since the sum of the entire pixel amount is too large to fit into an integer register, a proper significant figure addition was used to limit the bit number of the sum. If the size of the integer registers that are used for the calculations is too small, the effective numbers become too small while the errors become larger; contrarily, if the integer register size is too large, the processor limitation makes parallelization difficult. For this reason, the <b>sum</b> <b>register</b> size was limited to 32 -bit and the temporary variables can be stored in the 64 -bit registers. Since the SRP does not support division, shift operations are used for the WB result. A division by 3 in Eqs. (14) to (16) is simplified by 3 / 8, which is performed as a multiplication by 3 followed by a shift right by three bits.|$|E

It is well-known in the world of signal processing, where it is formulated and proved in terms of the Z-transform (a discrete version of the Laplace transform) and transfer functions (see for instance [Lah 98, p. 694]).

In particular, t-norms and t-conorms based on quantum gates allows the modeling and interpretation of union, intersection, difference and implication among fuzzy sets, also including an expression for the class of fuzzy S-implications.

Thus, the multi-year variability and probability distribution of precipitation form the basis information for water management and damage risk assessment (caused by drought and heavy rains). The main goal {{of this paper is to}} analyse the precipitation patterns and to determine the non-exceedance probability (p, %) of extreme monthly precipitation in the region influenced by lignite mining and dominated by traditional agricultural production. Monthly precipitation totals recorded in 1961 – 2010 at four weather stations close to the analysed region were examined, including comparative analysis of precipitation patterns between the stations. Different non-exceedance probability (p, %) was determined with focus on extreme precipitation. Annual and monthly precipitation was characterised by a large variation of values. Temporal variability was larger than the spatial variability. The highest average <b>sums</b> were <b>registered</b> in July and the lowest in February. Minimum monthly precipitation (< 10 mm) were recorded between January and April, and in October at all four weather stations. Maximum totals, amounting to more than 200 mm, were noted in July. The largest share of absolute minimum and maximum monthly precipitation was recorded at the turn of 20 th and 21 st centuries. Temporal and spatial distribution of precipitation for very dry, abnormally dry and extremely dry months (p ≤ 20 %) were characterised by lower dispersion of values compared with wet months (p ≥ 80 %). The precipitation probability distribution at p ≤ 20 % may be useful to determine agricultural drought risk assessment in the region.

40|$|International audienceRespiratory {{motion is}} {{a major source of}} reduced quality in {{positron}} emission tomography (PET). In order to minimize its effects, the use of respiratory synchronized acquisitions, leading to gated frames, has been suggested. Such frames, however, are of low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as they contain reduced statistics. Super-resolution (SR) techniques make use of the motion in a sequence of images in order to improve their quality. They aim at enhancing a low-resolution image belonging to a sequence of images representing different views of the same scene. In this work, a maximum a posteriori (MAP) super-resolution algorithm has been implemented and applied to respiratory gated PET images for motion compensation. An edge preserving Huber regularization term was used to ensure convergence. Motion fields were recovered using a B-spline based elastic registration algorithm. The performance of the SR algorithm was evaluated through the use of both simulated and clinical datasets by assessing image SNR, as well as the contrast, position and extent of the different lesions. Results were compared to <b>summing</b> the <b>registered</b> synchronized frames on both simulated and clinical datasets. The super-resolution image had higher SNR (by a factor of over 4 on average) and lesion contrast (by a factor of 2) than the single respiratory synchronized frame using the same reconstruction matrix size. In comparison to the motion corrected or the motion free images a similar SNR was obtained, while improvements of up to 20 % in the recovered lesion size and contrast were measured. Finally, the recovered lesion locations on the SR images were systematically closer to the true simulated lesion positions. These observations concerning the SNR, lesion contrast and size were confirmed on two clinical datasets included in the study. In conclusion, the use of SR techniques applied to respiratory motion synchronized images lead to motion compensation combined with improved image SNR and contrast, without any increase in the overall acquisition times...|$|R

This study was performed to determine the seasonal variation of tuberculosis and forecast its incidence until the year 2015 {{in one of the}} northern provinces of Iran. Materials and Methods: A longitudinal time series study was conducted. The study interval was from March 2001 to March 2011. The <b>sum</b> of daily <b>registered</b> cases in each month created 132 time points. The Box-Jenkins methods were used for determining the model. The best model was selected by analyzing the residuals and calculating the AIC and BIC. Results: A total of 3, 313 patients were diagnosed and recorded during this time. The highest number of cases was registered in May and the difference in monthly incidence of tuberculosis was significant (P= 0. 007). The incidence of tuberculosis was higher in spring and summer than winter (P= 0. 04). According to the best model which was SARIMA (0, 1, 1) (0, 1, 1) 12, the average incidence of tuberculosis in 2015 is estimated to be 12 in 100, 000 persons per year.

40|$|Presented at the GLOBELICS 6 th International Conference 2008 22 - 24 September, Mexico City, Mexico. It is {{difficult}} to find a field of macroeconomics in which experts can disregard Argentina. Researchers that focus on economic growth have compared Argentina with Japan or Australia, concluding that the former had experienced many “lost opportunities”. Researchers that focus on inflation dynamics try to explain how an economy can go from hyperinflation to deflation in just a few years. Researchers exploring international finance and emerging economies wonder whether Argentina played a Ponzi game with its external debt during the late 1990 s. Researchers studying business cycles have tried to understand the determinants of excess aggregate volatility and the occurrence of crises episodes. And on it goes. As we can see, the set of “macroeconomic facts” for Argentina has few positive elements. Albrieu and Fanelli (2008) and Chisari et al. (2008) elaborated growth diagnostics for Argentina in line with Hausmann et al. (2005) methodology, and they detected that the main binding constraint on economic growth is the low appropriability of the returns on economic activity. The idea is simple. Imagine an economy that is subject to external (and policy-induced) shocks and an especially low ability to process them without generating important economic costs and, in some cases, dramatic regime switching. Given this context, investment decisions in physical capital and innovative activities are rather defensive. So, the investment rate is low, especially in those areas where profits are more uncertain, such as Research and Development (R&D). As a result, the average productivity level of the economy is lower than that reported in the developed world. From a macroeconomic perspective, the stylized fact that arises is a divergence in long run growth (cf. Pritchett, 1997). Nevertheless, since the mid- 1990 s one sector of the economy has gone in the opposite direction. We refer to the Soybean Production Chain (SPC). Between 1996 and 2007, the primary production of oilseeds grew from 12 million tons to 48 million, whereas SPC exports increased from 11 million tons to 46 million. Hence, Argentina was transformed into the leading exporter of oilseeds and soybean flour, together with being the main worldwide pool of oilseed production in the environs of Rosario, Santa Fe. In <b>sum,</b> SPC <b>registers</b> high rates of growth, is fully integrated with international markets, displays a differentiated pattern of innovative activities, and has developed a complex structure of contracts that {{it is very difficult to}} see in the rest of the economy. In this paper we take neither a purely macroeconomic nor a purely microeconomic approach, but a mix of the two. More precisely, we consider that a decentralized decision of the economic unit regarding investment and technological change (that is, the microeconomics) is determined simultaneously with the characteristics and the performance of the aggregate economy (the macroeconomics). To this end we need to detect whether causation runs in both directions: (a) from macroeconomics to microeconomics, we will take into account that macroeconomic shocks are decisive to defining the (micro) economic structure; (b) from microeconomics to macroeconomics, we will analyze how the economic structure and the institutional arrangements implemented (such as, contingent contracts) affect the ability of the economy to process shocks, taking advantage of the positive ones and filtering out the negative ones. The present study on the interactions between the microeconomy and the macroeconomy recognizes – and is inspired by – several studies on economic development in Argentina. In particular, the studies of Fanelli and Frenkel (1994 and 2000), Katz (1996) and Kosacoff (2008) have conducted exercises that are similar in spirit to ours. By contrast, the most important difference between these papers and ours is the sector of the economy chosen to represent “the microeconomy”: while we study a branch of the agricultural sector, they analyze the dynamics of the industrial sector. The difference is important because of the diverging paths these two sectors take. In the above papers the authors explained how the uncertain macroeconomic environment makes profitable a specific kind of adaptative behavior that generates a premium on the more flexible or reversible options. Simultaneously, this (directly unobservable) defensive behavior has its observable counterpart in a pattern of low investment in physical capital and R&D, with the corresponding negative effects on economic growth. As we wrote above, this is not the case for the SPC. Therefore, we have to determine new linkages between microeconomics and macroeconomics. The work is organized as follows. Section II studies the changes in the environment (or the “macroeconomics) of the individual agent that is part of the SPC and makes decisions regarding investment and innovation. We will see the role played by world markets as well as economic policies. That is, we will study how the aggregative conditions influence the individual decision and in so doing, influence the configuration of the economic structure. Section III describes the microeconomic decisions taken by these agents. We will explain SPC’s strategies for investment in innovation as the (best) response to the perceived changes in the environment detected in Section II. Section IV studies how the resulting economic structure of those microeconomic, decentralized decisions affects the macroeconomic performance. Finally, Section V concludes...|$|R
40|$|Over the years, it {{has been}} {{recognized}} that using pre-treatment imaging as a “snapshot” of the tumors and/or normal tissues is an oversimplification of reality, as location, morphology and physiology can change during treatment. Indeed, the tumor ecosystem is not static; continuous changes occur in the tumor, particularly in response to radiotherapy (RT), e. g. well-known radiobiological phenomena of re-oxygenation, repopulation, re-assortment of cells within the cell cycle and repair of sub-lethal damage. The dynamic character of the tumor ecosystem and consequential changes in its biological properties cast doubt upon uniform treatment. Performing anatomic and functional imaging prior and during the RT course followed by treatment plan adaption may also tailor temporal and spatial changes in the tumor and become a step forward in treatment individualization. In head and neck (HN) tumors, {{it has been}} shown that the tumor volume can dramatically decrease during a 7 -week treatment. Similarly, substantial variation in normal-tissue volume has also been reported during RT of other site. Adaptive RT, where patients are re-imaged and re-planned several times during treatment, is a possible strategy to improve treatment delivery by taking into account anatomic modifications over time. First, we make a review of the literature on adaptive RT by reviewing the techniques of adaptive RT and discussing their potential for the maximization of the therapeutic index. Modifications of patient’s anatomy may be evaluated by performing several imaging during treatment. When the shapes or relative positions of target volumes (TV) and organs at risk (OAR) change, simple rigid-body correction techniques may not be sufficient for accurate registration. The solution is the use of deformable registration algorithms (DRA) for the alignment of data sets that are mismatched in a nonlinear or non-uniform way. Applications of DRAs in adaptive RT include 1) automatic time propagation of regions of interest from one image to another also called “Automatic Recontouring” and 2) deformation of the re-planned dose maps to integrate the accumulated dose given to the patient. We describe a strict and objective methodology to compare different algorithms and strategies for deformable registration to be used on images from HN cancer patients. Thereafter, we describe an automatic recontouring method by using the DRA previously validated. Using such a precise and reproductible method, we quantified the volumetric and positional changes in HN gross tumor volumes (GTV), clinical target volumes (CTV) and OARs. By applying the planned treatment on images acquired during the treatment, per-treatment dose maps are obtain. In order to be able to accumulate the dose received by each patient’s volume elements, the data sets need to be non-rigidly registered. In the case of inter-fraction accumulation, the effects of fractionated irradiation on cells killing are not linear and it is generally accepted that it follows the linear-quadratic model. This means that in terms of cell survival within each patient’s volume element, fractionated doses cannot theoretically be accumulated by a simple addition. In other words, even if we have an exact knowledge of the dose given to each voxel at every fraction and if the dose is accumulated simply by <b>summing</b> all fractions <b>registered</b> to the same reference, the corresponding total dose map could not be representative of the radiobiological effect of the dose as it will lose the information of dose per fraction variation. We evaluate the error made by performing simple summation of dose vs. a method that accumulate the dose while taking biological effects in consideration. At least, we develop an adaptive methodology to try to adapt the dose distribution to the changing anatomy. The objectives of this study were: 1) to assess the consequences of anatomic modification in dose distribution for both TVs and OARs; 2) to assess the potential benefit of adaptive strategies using a DRA applied to both volume and dose variations. As our group has already demonstrated the value of fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) for GTV delineation of the primary HN tumors and its potential consequences on dose distribution, we also include a comparison between adaptive RT based on anatomic (computed tomography - CT) and functional (FDG PET) imaging.
