5|$|A <b>scene</b> in {{the episode}} shows Grampa and Bart driving to Branson with Marge's car, {{listening}} to the radio. Because the <b>scene</b> consists entirely of auditive gags, the Simpsons staff had difficulty figuring out what to show visually during the <b>scene.</b> In the DVD audio commentary for the episode, Jean explained that these scenes “get a really big laugh at the table,” but are subsequently hard for the animators. The <b>scene</b> makes use of a repeated background, an animation technique made famous by Hanna-Barbera in order to cut budget.|$|E
5|$|For the <b>scene</b> {{in which}} Ash is {{revealed}} to be an android, a puppet was created of the character's torso and upper body which was operated from underneath. During a preview screening of the film, this <b>scene</b> caused an usher to faint. In the following <b>scene,</b> Ash's head is placed on a table and re-activated; for portions of this <b>scene,</b> an animatronic head was made using a face cast of the actor, Ian Holm. However, the latex of the head shrank while curing {{and the result was}} not entirely convincing. For the bulk of the <b>scene,</b> Holm knelt under the table with his head coming up through a hole. Milk, caviar, pasta, fiber optics, and glass marbles were combined to form the android's innards.|$|E
5|$|In February 2000, Berry was {{involved}} in a traffic collision and left the <b>scene.</b> She pleaded no contest to misdemeanor leaving the <b>scene</b> of an accident.|$|E
50|$|Taylor also issued, with {{engravings}} from designs {{mostly by}} himself (a few were {{by his son}} Isaac), a series of topographies: <b>Scenes</b> in Europe and <b>Scenes</b> in England (1819), extended to <b>Scenes</b> in Asia, <b>Scenes</b> in Africa, <b>Scenes</b> in America, <b>Scenes</b> in Foreign Lands, <b>Scenes</b> of British Wealth, and (posthumously in 1830) <b>Scenes</b> of Commerce by Land and Sea.|$|R

50|$|Sebastiaen Vrancx is now mainly {{known for}} his battle <b>scenes,</b> a genre he likely pioneered in Northern European art. His subject matter was, however, much wider than solely battle <b>scenes.</b> He painted landscapes with mythological and {{religious}} <b>scenes,</b> allegories of the seasons and months, city views, banquet <b>scenes,</b> village <b>scenes,</b> genre <b>scenes,</b> Brueghelian <b>scenes</b> and even architectural paintings.|$|R
5|$|In a mid-credits <b>scene,</b> the Other confers {{with his}} master about the failed attack on Earth. In a post-credits <b>scene,</b> the Avengers eat in silence at a shawarma restaurant.|$|E
5|$|In a <b>scene</b> in the episode, Homer and Bart {{exit the}} Magic Palace's gift shop, only {{to end up}} in another gift shop. The <b>scene</b> was based on an {{experience}} of the episode's show runner Mike Scully, who, in order to exit the Lance Burton Theatre after a magic show, had to pass through a gift shop. The ending <b>scene</b> of the episode went through several changes and was as a result completed late in the episode's production. The writers had conceived the courtroom <b>scene,</b> but they were stuck {{trying to come up with}} an ending after Skinner had been shot. They eventually decided that the trial was a scam staged by the townspeople, and Simpsons writer George Meyer pitched the surfing <b>scene</b> that closed the episode.|$|E
5|$|The {{background}} music {{used for the}} fight <b>scene</b> is a knockoff of the music used in the fight <b>scene</b> in The Quiet Man.|$|E
30|$|To {{explore the}} {{influence}} of the available information on the system generalization performance, we train the improved SE model with different numbers of noise <b>scenes</b> (two <b>scenes,</b> three <b>scenes,</b> four <b>scenes,</b> six <b>scenes,</b> and eight <b>scenes)</b> and different numbers of speakers (two speakers, three speakers, four speakers, and six speakers) at four conditions of SNR. The test data consist of unseen speakers applied by TIMIT database and unseen noisy <b>scenes</b> applied by NoiseX- 92.|$|R

30|$|Comparison {{and study}} of {{generalization}} performance: We explore {{the influence of}} the available information on the system generalization performance. In this paper, the available information consists of the number of noisy <b>scenes</b> and the number of speakers’ clean speech. Firstly, the influence of the number of different training noisy <b>scenes</b> on the system generalization performance is studied. Training data set consists of six speakers’ pure voice with different number of noisy <b>scenes</b> (two <b>scenes,</b> three <b>scenes,</b> four <b>scenes,</b> six <b>scenes,</b> and eight <b>scenes)</b> at four different SNR conditions. Test data is applied with a pure male speech in TIMIT database with factor floor noise in NoiseX- 92.|$|R
5|$|The {{idea behind}} the shock therapy <b>scene</b> was based on Laurel and Hardy {{throwing}} pies at each other. The <b>scene</b> was rearranged in the editing room; it played out differently when first produced. The edits to this <b>scene</b> were preliminary, but well-received, and remained unchanged in the finished product.|$|E
5|$|The <b>scene</b> where Donna and the Doctor {{investigate}} Adipose {{was difficult}} to film. The <b>scene</b> took thirty shots to complete, and Tennant and Tate experienced problems avoiding each other on-screen. The <b>scene</b> was filmed in Picture Finance's call centre {{on the outskirts of}} Newport on an early Sunday morning, with the company's telephonists serving as extras.|$|E
5|$|The <b>scene</b> where Saul Tigh has {{the vision}} of {{shooting}} William Adama was not filmed in one shot, but was edited {{in such a way}} that the cut would only become noticeable if one looks at the <b>scene</b> closely. Moore considered cutting the <b>scene</b> despite loving it, but eventually decided to keep it.|$|E
50|$|There {{are seven}} <b>scenes</b> from the Sigurd legend carved {{on the two}} door panels, with three <b>scenes</b> on the first panel and four <b>scenes</b> on the second panel. The {{description}} below notes the <b>scenes</b> and the corresponding section from the legend, with {{the order of the}} fifth and sixth <b>scenes</b> reversed to follow the normal sequence of the legend.|$|R
50|$|There is also {{a version}} without the Jump In! <b>scenes.</b> So, the dance <b>scenes</b> are extended. Because the High School Musical! <b>scenes</b> are cut from this version, some dance <b>scenes</b> have to be moved up from their regular {{position}} in the version with the Jump In! <b>scenes.</b> Thus some dances are repeated and new ones are added.|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the film}} is {{animated}} (the dream <b>scenes),</b> but the beginning and ending <b>scenes</b> (the awake <b>scenes)</b> are in live action.|$|R

5|$|A {{practical}} {{method was}} {{considered for the}} <b>scene</b> in which Violet Beauregarde turns blue and swells up into a giant 10-foot blueberry. A suit with an air hose was considered at one point for {{the beginnings of the}} swelling <b>scene,</b> before {{the decision was made to}} do the entire transformation in CGI. The visual effects house Cinesite was recruited for this assignment. In some shots of AnnaSophia Robb's head, a facial prosthetic was worn to give the impression that her cheeks had swelled up as well. Because this decision was made late in the film's production, any traces of Violet's blueberry <b>scene</b> were omitted from trailers or promotional material.|$|E
5|$|A {{recreation}} of the Body Worlds exhibit {{provided a}} setting for one <b>scene</b> in the film. Among the Body Worlds plastinates featured in that <b>scene</b> were the Poker Playing Trio (which {{plays a key}} role in one <b>scene)</b> and Rearing Horse and Rider. The exhibition's developer and promoter, German anatomist Gunther von Hagens, also has a cameo appearance in the film, although only his trademark hat is actually visible on screen.|$|E
5000|$|Passages {{of writing}} may be {{classified}} into four groups: (1) <b>scenes,</b> (2) sequels, (3) passages that are neither <b>scenes</b> nor sequels, and (4) passages that include {{elements of both}} <b>scenes</b> and sequels. Examples of passages that are neither <b>scenes</b> nor sequels include fragments [...] of <b>scenes</b> or sequels and passages of narration, description, or exposition. An example of a passage that includes elements of both <b>scenes</b> and sequels is the problem-solving passage, common in mystery and detective stories.|$|R

5|$|A <b>scene</b> between Skinner and The Smoking Man {{was removed}} from the final cut due to time considerations, {{reducing}} his role in the episode to a very short dialogue-less appearance. Another <b>scene</b> where Mulder questions Skinner's allegiance was also removed when it was viewed as too combative. The episode title means the incarnation of a deity in Sanskrit.|$|E
5|$|A <b>scene</b> {{featuring}} multiple clones of {{the character}} Kurt Crawford was achieved with motion control photography, allowing actor David Lovgren to portray all of the clones—multiple takes were recorded with the actor in different positions within the <b>scene,</b> and by using a camera controlled by a computer to follow exactly the same motions for each take, these could be seamlessly composited together. Producer Paul Rabwin has noted that achieving these shots was difficult due to the mixture of green and blue light sources in the <b>scene.</b>|$|E
5|$|According to Dallas, {{it rained}} on days that were {{supposed}} to be sunny, while other days of production lacked rain when {{they were supposed to be}} rainy. Goodwin added that the <b>scene</b> of Snow and Charming releasing the birds was freezing because of the heavy rain. Their <b>scene</b> in the cabin took place on the first day of the episode's production. Her near-death <b>scene</b> involved a real cliff, though the height was exaggerated later using CGI and a green screen; a stunt double stood in for some of the shots.|$|E
50|$|Per IAFD, Angelina {{has over}} 575 movies (including compilations) {{credited}} under her name. Her most productive years were 2005 and 2006, when 95 films were released in both. Her most frequented sexual partners on-screen are James Deen (13 movies), Marco Banderas (13 <b>scenes),</b> Mark Ashley (13 <b>scenes),</b> Mick Blue (13 <b>scenes),</b> Ben English (12 movies), Tommy Gunn (12 <b>scenes),</b> and Sascha (12 <b>scenes).</b>|$|R
50|$|Another {{version of}} the music video juxtaposes <b>scenes</b> from Grey's Anatomy to <b>scenes</b> of the {{original}} music video. However, all the <b>scenes</b> of the presumed car crash victims are excluded and only <b>scenes</b> of The Fray playing in a warehouse are shown.|$|R

5|$|According to Schumacher, {{during the}} <b>scene</b> {{in which the}} costumes of the Riddler and Two-Face are seen, he {{originally}} planned to put Poison Ivy and Mr. Freeze escaping from Arkham Asylum while many other villains saw them from their cells. The <b>scene,</b> however, didn't {{make it in the}} final film.|$|E
5|$|After {{the train}} is {{dispatched}} and enters Wonder Mountain, riders {{find themselves in a}} graveyard where zombies are roaming. At the end of the <b>scene,</b> riders who began facing forward see a survivor directing them to the next <b>scene.</b> Riders who were seated backwards do not see this transition. The next <b>scene</b> takes place in a house overrun by the zombies and large spiders. At the end of the <b>scene</b> a truck crashes into the house. Riders then leave the house and pass the survivor; this transition is again absent for backward-seated riders. The train continues to a road with zombies, where three cars with zombies on them join the riders. Two of the cars crash {{at the end of the}} <b>scene.</b> The train then passes through a tunnel with abandoned cars; this <b>scene</b> is absent for riders facing backward. Riders then battle the zombies for the final time before entering the drop track sequence. The names of the highest-scoring riders are displayed on a leader-board for this version of the attraction.|$|E
5|$|Andrew Prine, {{who played}} Norman Ramsey, wrote the last {{fifth of the}} film because it had no ending. Both Ben Johnson and he were hung over while filming the train <b>scene</b> after partying the night before. During the rain <b>scene</b> with Ramsey, a snake made its way on the set. Crew members were yelling at Andrew {{that it was a}} moccasin, but Prine wanted to finish his <b>scene</b> without reshooting, so the crew killed the snake afterwards. The last shot of the film where the killer is seen {{standing}} in line at the movie theater was Pierce's wife's idea.|$|E
