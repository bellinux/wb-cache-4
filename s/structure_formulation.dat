40|$|ABSTRACT: Micromechanics {{of rapid}} {{granular}} flows is studied in a two-dimensional planar granular Couette flow apparatus. The device {{is capable of}} generating particulate flows at different shearing rates and solid fractions. Mono size plastic disks are sheared across an annular test-section for several shear rates. Motion of particles is recorded through high speed digital camera and analyzed by image processing techniques. The average and fluctuation velocity profiles are obtained and granular temperature relations with shear rate are investigated. Average streaming velocity across the shear cell decays slightly faster than exponential, and is rather Gaussian when not {{too close to the}} wall. Fluctuation velocities and granular temperature across the shear cell are related to effective shear rate. Interparticle collisions are estimated from the particle trajectories and probability distribution of collision angles obtained from particle collision data.

The kth-order Pascal polynomial is used to pass through the given (k+ 1) data points in achieving the kth-order Pascal filter. The Pascal noninteger-delay filter is a real-time filter that consists of two sections, which can be realized into the front-section and the back-section. The front-section contains multiplication-free digital filters, and the number of multiplications in the back-section just linearly increases as order becomes high. Since the new Pascal filter has low complexity and structure can adjust non-integer delay online, it is more suited for fast delay tuning. Consequently, the polynomial-interpolation-type delay filter can be achieved by using the Pascal approach with high efficiency and low-complexity structure...|$|E

They have been developed {{in the framework of}} the limit analysis kinematical approach by using very simple trial velocity fields. The present Note provides, through numerical upper and lower bounds, a rigorous assessment of the approximate criteria derived in these theoretical works. To this end, existing static 3 D codes for a von Mises matrix have been easily extended to the orthotropic case. Conversely, instead of the non-obvious extension of the existing kinematic codes, a new original mixed approach has been elaborated {{on the basis of the}} plane strain <b>structure</b> <b>formulation</b> earlier developed by F.

Primary and secondary flow field visualizations are presented and performance predictions are tabulated. A parametric study on ejector geometry is obtained following a validation of the flow fields and performance values. The primary flow is calculated using a quasi- 2 D, irrotational Method of Characteristics and the secondary flow is found using isentropic relations. Primary calculations begin at the throat and extend through the nozzle {{to the location of}} the first Mach Disk. Combustion properties are tabulated before analysis to allow for propellant property selection. Secondary flow calculations employ the previously calculated plume boundary and ejector geometry to form an isentropic solution. Primary and secondary flow computations are iterated along the new pressure distributions established by the 1 D analysis until a convergence tolerance is met. Thrust augmentation and Specific Impulse values are predicted using a control volume approach. For the validation test cases, the nozzle characteristic net is very similar to that of previous research.
