The album had a worldwide release in June 1982 but, despite the strong promotion, it reached only No.27 in the UK Album Chart.

50|$|David N. Green, musician, {{writer and}} composer, wrote in 1987 an essay about musicians using <b>screams</b> as a singing {{technique}} in music. He makes {{the distinction between}} harmonic <b>scream</b> that relates to the harmony {{of the music and}} has components of tonality, the true <b>scream</b> that is atonal, the lyrical <b>scream</b> that is related with the song’s lyrics and the pure <b>scream</b> that is not. The harmonic <b>scream</b> is the <b>scream</b> that is still very clear and has a defined pitch and that I actually relate to a fake <b>scream,</b> as it has no great disturbance, the lyrical <b>scream</b> that is related to words, most of the time swearing and the pure <b>scream</b> or the true <b>scream,</b> that in this case can also be called as the real <b>scream</b> or the primal <b>scream.</b>|$|R

5|$|Sweet Oblivion, {{released}} in 1992, brought the band {{to a new}} level of commercial success, and the <b>Screaming</b> Trees found itself amidst the sudden popularity of the Seattle music scene. In 1996, the band released its seventh studio album, Dust; while successful, the album could not emulate the precedent set by Sweet Oblivion. <b>Screaming</b> Trees disbanded in 2000 due to conflicts among the members regarding the band's creative direction.|$|E

[...] However, the film saw its US takings perform lower than the original's while its foreign takings increased. <b>Scream</b> 2 is currently the 520th highest-grossing film worldwide, behind <b>Scream</b> but ahead of <b>Scream</b> 3 and is the second highest-grossing film in the slasher genre, again behind <b>Scream</b> but ahead of <b>Scream</b> 3. <b>Scream</b> 2 was the 21st highest-grossing film of 1997 despite competition from blockbuster films such as Titanic and Men in Black.|$|R

40|$|When {{experiencing}} aggression {{from group}} members, chimpanzees commonly produce <b>screams.</b> These agonistic <b>screams</b> are graded signals and vary acoustically {{as a function}} of the severity of aggression the caller is facing. We conducted a series of field playback experiments with a community of wild chimpanzees in the Budongo Forest, Uganda, to determine whether individuals could meaningfully distinguish between <b>screams</b> given in different agonistic contexts. We compared six subjects’ responses to <b>screams</b> given in response to severe and mild aggression. Subjects consistently discriminated between the two <b>scream</b> types. To address the possibility that the response differences were driven directly by the screams’ peripheral acoustic features, rather than any attached social meaning, we also tested the subjects’ responses to tantrum <b>screams.</b> These <b>screams</b> are given by individuals that experienced social frustration, but no physical threat, yet acoustically they are very similar to <b>screams</b> of victims of severe aggression. We found chimpanzees looked longer at severe victim <b>screams</b> than either mild victim <b>screams</b> or tantrum <b>screams.</b> Our results indicate that chimpanzees attend to the informational content of <b>screams</b> and are able to distinguish between different <b>scream</b> variants, which form part of a graded continuum...|$|R
