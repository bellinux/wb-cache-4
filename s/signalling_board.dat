Court proceedings before Amtsgericht Meißen confirmed that the scheduled train No. 3011, hauled by engine 99 1789, had left Friedewald Bad without permission despite the other train on the line. In addition, the train crew had failed to stop at a <b>signalling</b> <b>board</b> (an [...] "Ne 1" [...] trapezoid board) and used the wrong track in Friedewald Bad.

50|$|An {{advantage}} of this design over the standard distant signal of the Reichsbahn was that it displayed a clearly visible signal aspect in each position. As a result, it did not need a distant <b>signal</b> <b>board</b> (Vorsignaltafel). This was hesitantly retrofitted by the Reichsbahn from 1936. After the Second World War, however, distant <b>signals</b> without <b>signal</b> <b>boards</b> could still be found in Bavaria.|$|R

40|$|The three boxes being {{reviewed}} all {{operate at}} a pressure {{of less than}} 15 psig. Since they are relieved at 13 psig, they fall outside the scopes of the ASME Pressure Vessel Code, Fermilab Engineering Standard SD- 37 B, and Chapter 5031 of the Fermilab Safety Manual, therefore a Pressure Vessel Engineering Note showing compliance with SD- 37 B is not required. In calculating the design stresses, only {{the largest of the}} three boxes, the <b>signal</b> <b>board</b> feed-thru box, was analyzed. This box had the largest spans and areas and would experience the largest pressure-related forces. The thinnest walls of each box were found to be in the top plates and they were also the side of the box which exposed the largest amount of area to internal pressure. The <b>signal</b> <b>board</b> feed-thru box top plate had at least twice the pressure area than either the instrumentation or hi-voltage boxes' top plates. This large disparity overshadows the slight difference in top plate thicknesses between the three boxes (0. 56 -inch vs. 0. 25 -inch and 0. 3125 -inch, respectively). Therefore, we felt the analysis of the larger <b>signal</b> <b>board</b> feedthru box would justify the design of the smaller instrumentation and hi-voltage boxes. Appended to the end of this engineering note are the weld procedure, assembly report and the pressure test procedure & results for the signal feed-thru box. Also, included as a reference is a list of the drawing numbers for the parts and assembly of the <b>signal</b> <b>board</b> feed-thru, instrumentation and hi-voltage boxes...|$|R

40|$|There are {{two main}} issues, high cost and {{interrupt}} response delay for current PACs (programmable automation controllers) which are using high frequency single-chip microprocessors and commercial RTOS (real-time operating system) working by switching the tasks and interrupts. To solve these problems, a new low-cost multi-core heterogeneous PAC structure was proposed. Based on the traditional front-end of interrupt service without interrupt switching delay and the division & deployment of multi real-time tasks. We implemented a new programming language Engineer C including its syntax, compiler and an integrated development environment, which can dynamically divide the multi tasks and deploy the division to single low-cost microcontroller, then built the hardware prototype, which consists of a digital <b>signal</b> <b>board,</b> an analog <b>signal</b> <b>board</b> and a motion control board, every board has its microcontroller and communicates each other by an enhanced SPI bus.

40|$|The superconducting Tevatron {{was added}} to Fermilab's 400 Gev Proton Accelerator, the main ring, in 1983. An {{antiproton}} source was added in 1985, and the system became a p-pbar, 1 Tev/I Tev, collider in 1987. A CoIIider Detector surrounding {{one of the points}} of the accelerator p-pbar beam crossings can measure virtually all the energy of the colliding interaction (Fig. I.) The measurement of all the energy is called hermetic calorimetry. Although there are other liquid argon calorimeters and other hermetic coIIider detectors, the D-Zero (named for the accelerator beam crossing location) liquid argon collider calorimeters will be the first of their kind (Fig. 2). The cryogenic aspects of the liquid argon calorimeter portion of the D-Zero detector are described here. The liquid argon serves as the particle detector ionizing media in a repetitive cell structure (Fig. 3) of argon, <b>signal</b> <b>board,</b> argon, and Uranium or copper absorber plate, with a superimposed electric field. Local <b>signal</b> <b>board</b> pads indicate location and the electric charge collected is proportional to the ionization and the ratio of the argon to plate absorption lengths.

40|$|Typically, {{real-time}} speech recognition- if {{achieved at}} all- is accomplished either by greatly simplifying the process-ing to be done, {{or by the}} use of special-purpose hardware.

Starting in 1990 [1] [2] we have taken a different approach based on modifying the algorithms to provide increased speed without loss in accuracy.
