25|$|For the 1990 model year, changes {{included}} larger protective laminate {{in front}} of rear wheels, lower redline (owing to the heavier crank with cylinders 2 & 5 counterbalanced), redesigned steering wheel with cruise control relocated to a stalk on the right side. In addition to an airbag and airbag indicator light on dash, {{there was also a}} redesign of the left side <b>switch</b> <b>panel,</b> which replaced one of the coin slots with the dimmer. Lower dash panel became a two piece design, which was also much heavier than the previous one piece panel owing to a change in material. Finally the memory lever on the steering column was removed.|$|E
500|$|The {{gameplay}} was {{the second}} element created for the game, following the graphics created by Jensen. The gameplay was created and refined using rudimentary graphic elements to establish the types of puzzles they wanted to have, but aware of how these elements would {{be presented to the}} player in the released version. Limbo was designed to avoid the pitfalls of major titles, where the same gameplay mechanic is used repeatedly. Carlsen, initially brought aboard as a programmer for the custom game engine, became the lead designer after Playdead found him to be capable at creating puzzles. Carlsen stated that the puzzles within Limbo were designed to [...] " [...] you guessing all the way through". Jensen also wanted to make the puzzles feel like a natural part of the environment, and to avoid the feeling that the player was simply moving from puzzle to puzzle through the course of the game. Carlsen identified examples of puzzles from other games that he wanted to avoid. He wanted to avoid simple puzzles that gave the player little satisfaction in its solution, such as a puzzle in [...] that involved simply moving a sun-lit mirror to specific points in a room. In contrast, Carlsen wanted to avoid making the puzzle so complex with many separate parts that the player would resort to trial-and-error and eventually come out with the solution without thinking about why the solution worked; Carlsen used an example of a puzzle from the 2008 Prince of Persia game that had seven different mechanics that he never bothered to figure out himself. Carlsen designed Limbo puzzles to fall between these limits, demonstrating one puzzle that only has three elements: a <b>switch</b> <b>panel,</b> an electrified floor, and a chain; the goal—to use the chain to cross the electrified floor—is immediately obvious to the player, and then tasks the player to determine the right combination of moves and timing to complete it safely. They often had to strip away elements to make the puzzles more enjoyable and easier to figure out. The decision to provide little information to the player was an initial challenge in creating the game. From their initial pool of about 150 playtesters, several would have no idea of how to solve certain puzzles. To improve this, they created scenarios before troublesome spots that highlighted the appropriate actions; for example, when they found players did not think about pulling a boat onto shore to use as a platform to reach a higher ledge, they presented the player with a box-pulling puzzle earlier to demonstrate the pulling mechanics.|$|E

40|$|The {{information}} contained in a large panel data set is used to date historical turning points of the Austrian business cycle and to forecast future ones. We estimate groups of series with similar time series dynamics and link the groups with a dynamic structure. The dynamic structure identifies a group of leading {{and a group of}} coincident series. Robust results across data vintages are obtained when series specific information is incorporated {{in the design of the}} prior group probability distribution. The results are consistent with common expectations, in particular the group of leading series includes Austrian confidence indicators and survey data, German survey indicators, some trade data, and, interestingly, the Austrian and the German stock market indices.

50|$|For {{outgoing}} calls, the Line Link Frame {{acted like}} the line finder of the <b>panel</b> <b>switch,</b> autonomously connecting {{the line to}} a junctor, which corresponded to the cord circuit of the old cord telephone switchboard. As in the <b>panel</b> <b>switch,</b> the sender then found the chosen junctor and supplied dial tone. Like the <b>panel</b> <b>switch,</b> the 1XB common control {{was based on a}} complex, versatile sender circuit. The sender decoded dial pulses and was retrofitted for dual-tone multi-frequency signaling (DTMF) in the 1960s. A large number of senders used a common translator circuit to detect a call going to a nearby area code to be stored in abbreviated form. It called in an auxiliary sender when necessary to implement Direct Distance Dialing (DDD). Like the <b>panel</b> <b>switch,</b> two or more offices with separate incoming sections could share an outgoing section for more efficient trunking. Unlike the <b>panel</b> <b>switch,</b> it was rare to combine more than two this way.|$|R

50|$|In the {{development}} of the Saf-T-Liner C2, many advancements were made in {{the development}} of the interior of the school bus.

For the design of the C2, Thomas and Freightliner designed the vehicle to retain the dashboard of the Freightliner M2 106 in its entirety. Only a few changes were made, with the ignition moved to the center of the dashboard, as a driver <b>switch</b> <b>panel</b> was located to the left of the driver (full-size school buses do not have a traditional driver-side entry door).|$|E
