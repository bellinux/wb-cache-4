5|$|First-millennium Indian scholars, such as Sureshvara (Suresvaracharya, c. 750 CE), {{have viewed}} this male-female {{dialogue}} as profound on both sides; Maitreyi refuses wealth, wishing {{to share her}} husband's spiritual knowledge, and in the four known versions of the Upanishadic <b>story</b> <b>she</b> challenges Yajnavalkya's theory of Atman.

After seven years, she returned to the northwestern part of the country in Montserrado County, where she began her schooling.

5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Tenar does not become a wizard (like Ged) or a king (like Arren, the primary {{character}} of The Farthest Shore), Cummins argues that her growth is more revolutionary than either of theirs. In contrast to the male bildungsroman in which characters grow into the characteristics society believes they should have, Tenar's coming of age is a female bildungsroman, in which she must struggle against the patriarchal Kargish empire. She learns to value herself for herself and not simply {{for her role as}} a priestess. She is helped through this process by Ged, who sees her as a powerful person, and helps her find choices that she did not see. Over the course of the <b>story</b> <b>she</b> realized that her true power is not her authority as the reincarnated high priestess, but the ability to make the choice to leave the labyrinth and the Tombs. Le Guin suggests that true power is not only about authority and mastery, but trust and collaboration.|$|E

5|$|The novel has {{pervasive}} lesbian themes, {{concentrating on}} eroticism and self-discovery. Waters {{was working on}} a PhD dissertation in English literature when she decided to write a <b>story</b> <b>she</b> would like to read. Employing her love for the variety of people and districts in London, she consciously chose an urban setting. As opposed to previous lesbian-themed fiction she had read where the characters escape an oppressive society to live apart from it, Waters chose characters who interact with their surroundings. She has acknowledged that the book imagines a lesbian presence and history in Victorian London where none was recorded. The main character's experiences in the theatrical profession and her perpetual motion through the city allow her to make observations on social conditions while exploring the issues of gender, sexism, and class difference.|$|E

Monica tells Rachel {{that she wants to}} humiliate Chandler for calling her fat, so Rachel suggests tricking him into taking off his clothes. Monica tries to seduce Chandler by rubbing various objects, including a knife, against her skin. She drops the knife and severs his toe. He is rushed to hospital to have it reattached but, in the commotion, Monica mixes up the digit with a carrot. In the present, Chandler becomes upset after learning that he had lost his toe because he called Monica fat, and angrily leaves.

A tag scene shows another of Phoebe's past life memories as she serves in a World War I field hospital and again lost an arm.|$|E
5|$|Charles Onyett of IGN {{found the}} {{gameplay}} enjoyable and {{enough to be}} appreciated by any genre fan. Yet he stated that if players were not Dragon Ball fans, then they will not {{want to play the}} game. Robert Thompson of Nintendojo felt that the game would satisfy fans of both the series and the genre, but he would complain about the ki and Sparking Combo attacks being repetitive, and the story shifting control of the characters, stating it could make unfamiliar gamers disoriented. Ryan Olsen of Kombo.com praised the battle system, calling it more engaging than the ones found in the average RPG. Still he would call the game a cut and dry RPG, calling the Active Guard system the only exotic aspect of the game. Neal Ronaghan of Nintendo World Report called the game vanilla with an interesting twists, stating that the fans should be the ones playing the game. He also drew comparisons of the Active Guard system to the Timed Hit system from Super Mario RPG, and Rage Gage to the Limit Break from Final Fantasy. Brittany Vincent of RPGFan would call side quests like Krillin's return home an added treat to the long <b>story.</b> <b>She</b> pointed out the game's difficulty being frustrating, stating that the game will cause players to revert to the start screen many times, yet is still beatable.|$|E
