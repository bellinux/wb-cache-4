40|$|Etological and {{physiological}} tests were realized on 48 horses. There were observed following activities: spontaneous kinetic activity, voice display; the elimination behavior (excretion and urination) and motionless standing. The horses {{were observed in}} 40 minute periods during the morning hours. The horses were classed into the following groups: EHB+ - crossing more than 220 sq. per 40 min. (high <b>sensitiveness</b> <b>to</b> stress), EHB+/- - crossing 131 - 220 sq. per 40 min. (mean <b>sensitiveness</b> <b>to</b> stress), EHB- - crossing 130 and less sq. per 40 min. (low <b>sensitiveness</b> <b>to</b> stress). After the evaluating of mineral, energetic, lipid, nitrogen, and enzymatic profile of sport horses there were not observed significant differences from the reference values...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} these {{experiments}} was to study the relationship of tuberculin skin <b>sensitiveness</b> 1 <b>to</b> antibody formation {{and their relationship to}} the tuberculous infection. The plan of the experiments was to infect rabbits with bovine tubercle bacilli, test their <b>sensitiveness</b> <b>to</b> intracutaneous injections of tuberculin, and determine the antibody contents of their blood at weekly intervals throughout the course of the disease...|$|R
40|$|The {{resistance}} <b>to</b> <b>ignition</b> of fire retardant-treated wood, cotton, and cellulose insulation was studied. The proprietary composition used {{to treat}} wood was found to increase resistance <b>to</b> <b>ignition</b> and <b>to</b> reduce smoke toxicity. Cotton treated with boric acid (added by padding on or by vapor phase process) {{was found to have}} increased resistance <b>to</b> <b>ignition</b> and decreased smoke toxicity. Boric acid increased the resistance of cellulose insulation <b>to</b> <b>ignition</b> but also slightly increased the smoke toxicity...|$|R

60|$|That early {{world was}} a world of strong tides and currents. An incessant {{destruction}} of individuals must {{have been going on}} through their being swept up the beaches and dried, or by their being swept out to sea and sinking down out of reach of air and sun. Early conditions favoured the development of every tendency to root and hold on, every tendency to form an outer skin and casing to protect the stranded individual from immediate desiccation. From the very earliest any tendency <b>to</b> <b>sensitiveness</b> <b>to</b> taste would turn the individual in the direction of food, and any <b>sensitiveness</b> <b>to</b> light would assist it to struggle back out of the darkness of the sea deeps and caverns or to wriggle back out of the excessive glare of the dangerous shallows.|$|R

Paul Emanuel owned {{an acute}} <b>sensitiveness</b> <b>to</b> the {{annoyance}} of interruption, from whatsoever cause occurring, during his lessons: {{to pass through}} the classe under such circumstances was considered by the teachers and pupils of the school, individually and collectively, to be as much as a woman's or girl's life was worth.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe ASSET project (ASsessing <b>SEnsitiveness</b> <b>to</b> Transport) has {{developed}} a GIS–based Web–tool using a map database to depict spatial indicators of transport and related pressures and maps on <b>sensitiveness</b> <b>to</b> transport activities. Among the indicators of sensitiveness used in the project there are Human health indicators: impacts due to noise, air pollution and higher concentration levels in cities and valleys. Ecosystem sensitivity indicators: Analysis of habitat sensitivity, landscape fragmentation and configuration of ecosystems. Indication of sensitive areas indicators in terms of scenic landscapes and impacts from tourism. The mapping of transport sensitive areas in Europe can allow for the identification and prioritization of critical sustainability issues geared {{to the development of}} the TEN–T network. Furthermore, volumes generated by transport models like TRANSTOOLS for actual situation and scenarios can be confronted with the sensitivity of the areas they cross...|$|R

50|$|Diesel engines {{make use}} of glow plugs to heat the {{combustion}} chamber prior <b>to</b> <b>ignition,</b> improving the conditions inside the engine, while certain manufacturers (such as Mazda with the RX-7 model) have incorporated a block heater, which heats the engine block prior <b>to</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>to</b> reduce the problem of cold starting.|$|R
40|$|To {{study the}} effect of {{variable}} heat transfer coefficient of fireworks and crackers on thermal explosion critical ambient temperature and time <b>to</b> <b>ignition,</b> considering the heat transfer coefficient as the power function of temperature, mathematical thermal explosion steady state and unsteady-state model of finite cylindrical fireworks and crackers with complex shell structures are established based on two-dimensional steady state thermal explosion theory. The influence of variable heat transfer coefficient on thermal explosion critical ambient temperature and time <b>to</b> <b>ignition</b> are analyzed. When heat transfer coefficient is changing with temperature and in the condition of natural convection heat transfer, critical ambient temperature lessen, thermal explosion time <b>to</b> <b>ignition</b> shorten. If ambient temperature is close to critical ambient temperature, the influence of variable heat transfer coefficient on time <b>to</b> <b>ignition</b> become large. For firework with inner barrel in example analysis, the critical ambient temperature of propellant is 463. 88 K and the time <b>to</b> <b>ignition</b> is 4054. 9 s at 466 K, 0. 26 K and 450. 8 s less than without considering the change of heat transfer coefficient respectively. The calculation {{results show that the}} influence of variable heat transfer coefficient on thermal explosion time <b>to</b> <b>ignition</b> is greater in this example. Therefore, {{the effect of}} variable heat transfer coefficient should be considered into thermal safety evaluation of fireworks to reduce potential safety hazard...|$|R

Eventually this feeling caused him to give up song-writing completely.|$|R
