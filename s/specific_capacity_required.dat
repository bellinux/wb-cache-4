50|$|Since the volume-specific {{corollary}} of the Dulong-Petit <b>specific</b> heat <b>capacity</b> relationship <b>requires</b> that {{atoms of}} all elements take up (on average) the same volume in solids, {{there are many}} departures from it, with most of these due to variations in atomic size. For instance, arsenic, which is only 14.5% less dense than antimony, has nearly 59% more <b>specific</b> heat <b>capacity</b> on a mass basis. In other words; even though an ingot of arsenic is only about 17% larger than an antimony one of the same mass, it absorbs about 59% more heat for a given temperature rise. The heat capacity ratios of the two substances closely follows the ratios of their molar volumes (the ratios of numbers of atoms in the same volume of each substance); the departure from the correlation to simple volumes {{in this case is}} due to lighter arsenic atoms being significantly more closely packed than antimony atoms, instead of similar size. In other words, similar-sized atoms would cause a mole of arsenic to be 63% larger than a mole of antimony, with a correspondingly lower density, allowing its volume to more closely mirror its heat capacity behavior.|$|R

The Rietveld refinement results indicated {{the presence of}} monoclinic (Li[Li 1 / 3 Mn 2 / 3]O- 2) (52 %), spinel (LiNi 0. 5 Mn 1. 5 O 4) (39 %) and rhombohedral LiNiO 2 (9 %). The electrochemical performance of this Li-rich integrated cathode material was tested at 30 degrees C and {{compared to that of}} high voltage LiNi 0. 5 Mn 1. 5 O 4 spinel cathodes. Interestingly, the layered-spinel integrated cathode material exhibits a high <b>specific</b> <b>capacity</b> of about 200 mA h g(- 1) at C/ 10 rate as compared to 180 mA h g(- 1) for LiNi 0. 5 Mn 1. 5 O 4 in the potential range of 2. 4 - 4. 9 V vs. Li anodes in half cells. The layered-spinel integrated cathodes exhibited 92 % capacity retention as compared to 82 % for LiNi 0. 5 Mn 1. 5 O 4 spinel after 80 cycles at 30 degrees C. Also, the integrated cathode material can exhibit 105 mA h g(- 1) at 2 C rate as compared to 78 mA h g(- 1) for LiNi 0. 5 Mn 1. 5 O 4.

This paper measured the <b>specific</b> <b>capacities</b> and thermal conductivities of binary systems formed by NPG, TRIS and PE in the temperature range from 30 ℃ to 70 ℃ and analyzed the experimental results {{from the point of}} view of crystal vibration. Hydrogen bonds exert great influence on the thermophysical properties of the binary systems. Although the components are only simply blended, substitutional impurity defects are incurred. As a result hydrogen bond will be affected in a complex way. There is no uniform trend between the value of x and <b>specific</b> <b>capacity.</b> Because of the influence of structure defect, <b>specific</b> <b>capacity</b> and phonon speed which all change with the strength of hydrogen bond, the relationship between thermal conductivity and the value of x is non-linear too. Because 40 ℃ is near the phase transition temperature of NPGxTRIS 1 -x (x= 0. 618), its <b>specific</b> <b>capacity</b> at 40 ℃ decreases and thermal conductivity increases.

40|$|It is {{becoming}} increasingly clear that many diseases {{are the result of}} infection from multiple genetically distinct strains of a pathogen. Such multi-strain infections have the capacity to alter both disease and pathogen dynamics. Infection with multiple strains of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is common and has been linked to enhanced disease. Suggestions that disease enhancement in multi-strain infected patients is due to complementation have been supported by trans-complementation studies in mice during co-infection of wild type and gene knockout strains of murine CMV (MCMV). Complementation between naturally circulating strains of CMV has, however, not been assessed. In addition, many models of multi-strain infection predict that co-infecting strains will compete with each other and that this competition may contribute to selective transmission of more virulent pathogen strains. To assess the outcome of multi-strain infection, C 57 BL/ 6 mice were infected with up to four naturally circulating strains of MCMV. In this study, profound within-host competition was observed between co-infecting strains of MCMV. This competition was MCMV strain specific and resulted in the complete exclusion of certain strains of MCMV from the salivary glands of multi-strain infected mice. Competition was dependent on Ly 49 H(+) natural killer (NK) cells as well as the expression of the ligand for Ly 49 H, the MCMV encoded product, m 157. Strains of MCMV which expressed an m 157 gene product capable of ligating Ly 49 H were outcompeted by strains of MCMV expressing variant m 157 genes. Importantly, within-host competition prevented the shedding of the less virulent strains of MCMV, those recognized by Ly 49 H, into the saliva of multi-strain infected mice. These data demonstrate that NK cells have the strain <b>specific</b> recognition <b>capacity</b> <b>required</b> to meditate within-host competition between strains of MCMV.

By means of total X-ray fluorescence (TXRF) technique it was shown that <b>specific</b> <b>capacity</b> losses associated {{with the amount of}} dissolved transition metals are negligible, implying a still intact NCM 111 active material after 53 cycles. It was demonstrated that the <b>specific</b> <b>capacity</b> fade during cycling at constant specific currents can be mainly attributed to the increase of the delithiation (charge) hindrance, whereas lithiation (discharge) hindrance is only present after a specific current increase, leading to apparent <b>specific</b> <b>capacity</b> losses and to decreased Coulombic efficiencies. This could be proven by the determination of the NCM lithiation degree in the discharged state with inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP–OES).
