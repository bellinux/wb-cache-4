50|$|This {{decision}} was widely {{perceived as a}} deliberate attempt by the mine owners to cover up any evidence of their culpability {{in the cause of}} the explosion. As there were no other reports concerning the deeper parts of the section, the inquiry considered the explanation presented by the legal representatives of the pit's management. They countered the miners' theories by suggesting that firedamp had actually accumulated further up the Dennis main road just beyond the Clutch. This gas was ignited at the Clutch when a telephone was used to warn miners of the influx of firedamp. Shawcross also suggested that the explosion might have been caused by the <b>spontaneous</b> <b>heating</b> of a pillar of coal. The assessor chosen by the mine owners, John Brass, also argued that the explosion, judging by the positions in which the bodies of the haulage men were found, had taken place at the Clutch, and that the gas had come from a new drift being driven from there to 29's for ventilation.|$|E

In order to minimize both handling and storage losses {{it is necessary to}} know more precisely what conditions cause <b>spontaneous</b> <b>heating</b> and what conditions will prevent it. To better understand the causes of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>heating</b> it is essential to be able to determine separately the effects of significant variables on the <b>spontaneous</b> <b>heating</b> rate. These variables include moisture content, density, temperature, and air supply. The hay samples studied should be small enough {{so that they can be}} made homogeneous. Each sample should be maintained under constant conditions during <b>spontaneous</b> <b>heating</b> so that the change of heating rate with time can be independently determined. These requirements indicate a need for a laboratory study. Therefore, a laboratory method for determining the <b>spontaneous</b> <b>heating</b> rates of hay samples under various steady state conditions will be useful in two respects.

But around 80 % coal fires {{occurring}} in Indian coal mines are due to <b>spontaneous</b> <b>heating</b> of coal. Due to coal fire many precious lives are lost, and economical loss also occur to the organization and to the nation. With rapid growth of India, the requirements for energy are increasing rapidly for industrial sectors and domestic use. To cater the increased demand for energy, we are relying on thermal power plants. So more stress is now given on high production of coal. With increase in coal production the <b>spontaneous</b> <b>heating</b> incidents are also bound to increase. That’s why special attention needs to be given for more study on <b>spontaneous</b> <b>heating</b> susceptibility of coal. So that early precautionary measures could be taken to prevent the coal to catch fire. In this study, 26 coal samples were collected from different coal fields of India viz. MCL, SECL, SCCL, ECL, CCL, BCCL, NECL, NCL. All the samples of coal were studied using Differential thermal analysis and proximate analysis was also done {{in order to get}} the intrinsic properties of the coal.

The after effect of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>heating</b> {{is a major}} setback in the {{production}} of coal. The <b>spontaneous</b> <b>heating</b> depends on many intrinsic factors such as, Ash content, moisture content, volatile matter content and fixed carbon. Apart from all the above mentioned parameters, wet oxidation potential difference method can also be correlated so as to predict its spontaneity for heat. The <b>spontaneous</b> <b>heating</b> susceptibility varies over a large span, thus the experiments become an important tool in predicting the vulnerability to <b>spontaneous</b> <b>heating</b> of a coal sample. In this project, the wet oxidation potential difference experiment was conducted for 20 different coal samples from different mines across India. The coal samples were collected by channel sampling and then they were prepared according to the Indian Standards. The calorific value of all the samples was measured using the Bomb Calorimeter and proximate analysis was also conducted so as to obtain the different parameters about the coal samples such as calorific value, ash, moisture, volatile matter, fixed carbon content. Correlation study was carried out to assess the <b>spontaneous</b> <b>heating</b> susceptibility of coal. In India, generally crossing point method is used for assessment of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>heating</b> susceptibility of coal. However, this method has certain draw backs. The results are dependent upon packing density, rate of heating and oxygen flow rate etc, and sometimes the results are not reproducible. Moreover it takes more than three hours to complete the experiment. Compared to CPT, the wet oxidation experiments only takes about 40 minutes for completion and the results are reproducible.

40|$|The Indian coal {{industry}} is currently facing {{a number of}} constraints (i. e. socio-economic, geotechnical and environmental issues) due to high demand of coal for industrial growth. In addition to the many potential geotechnical issues, the existence of extensive uncontrolled and concealed fires present a significant problem to the {{coal industry}}, the national economic growth and environment. The cause {{of many of these}} fires is the <b>spontaneous</b> <b>heating</b> of the coal seams (Zutshi et al., 2001) that create a significant problem to the productivity, safety and environmental impact of mining operations. The thesis presents the results of a systematic experimental study to determine the susceptibility of a number of Indian coal seams to <b>spontaneous</b> <b>heating.</b> A literature review revealed that the existing crossing point temperature method (CPT) assessment method is not reliable enough to be used to solely predict <b>spontaneous</b> <b>heating.</b> Therefore, {{there is a need to}} identify an additional robust and reliable technique to determine the susceptibility of coals to <b>spontaneous</b> <b>heating,</b> to assist in the classification of the coal seams with respect to their proneness to <b>spontaneous</b> <b>heating.</b> A comprehensive experimental study was conducted to analyse eleven coal samples collected from a variety of fiery and non-fiery coal seams within the Jharia coalfield (JCF) India. In the first part of the investigation, the basic coal characteristics, including a proximate, elemental, petrographic and mineral matter analysis were determined. The <b>spontaneous</b> <b>heating</b> susceptibility of all of the coal samples was studied using a number of methods, including: a morphology study of oxidised coal under microscopy, the use of the crossing point temperature method (Indian method), the use of the sponcomb rig at the University of Nottingham and the use of thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) of the coal samples. An analysis of the thermogravimetric results obtained for these coal samples at different heating rates resulted in the development of a <b>spontaneous</b> <b>heating</b> susceptibility index (SHSI). In addition, the activation energies were calculated from a kinetic study of the coal samples by employing the three different techniques attributed to Coats & Redfern (1963), Friedman (1964), and Chang (1994). Subsequently, a statistical correlation analysis was carried out to identify any links between the intrinsic properties of coal and the indices determined from the application of the different <b>spontaneous</b> <b>heating</b> susceptibility methods. It was observed that the proximate, elemental and petrographic analysis results correlated well with the <b>spontaneous</b> <b>heating</b> susceptibility results obtained from the sponcomb rig and TGA experiments. It was further concluded that the results of the mineral matter analyses do not exhibit a good correlation with any of the <b>spontaneous</b> <b>heating</b> susceptibility indices. The hierarchical clustering method was used to examine any links between the intrinsic coal properties and the result obtained from the application of each of the four susceptibility indices investigated. Each susceptibility index was subdivided into three levels, namely highly susceptible, moderately susceptible and poorly susceptible. A critical review of the literature reporting the classification of coal seams based on field observations, <b>spontaneous</b> <b>heating</b> susceptibility studies and hierarchical clustering theory concluded that any coal seam may be assigned to one of these three sub level classes by knowledge of the results obtained from the sponcomb rig and TGA experiments.

The correlation of intrinsic properties and susceptibility indices is done using both Simple linear regression and multiple linear regression. The results for intrinsic properties and the susceptibility indices are presented in table 1. The simple linear regression analysis showed that the moisture, ash and aliphaticity as compared to other intrinsic properties are a better indicator of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>heating</b> as they have better correlation with CPT and WOPD. Therefore, aliphaticity is suggested as a good indicator of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>heating</b> susceptibility. On multiple linear regression analysis strong correlation was found between moisture, ash, aliphaticity and both the susceptibility indices...|$|E
40|$|Coal absorbs oxygen even {{at lower}} {{temperatures}} than the ambient temperature {{and they start}} heating up. This heating without any external source of supply of heat generally leads to due to auto-oxidation, also called <b>spontaneous</b> <b>heating</b> of coal. Due to auto-oxidation, {{we are faced with}} many dangerous problems. Therefore the assessment of this problem has become necessary and hence we are trying to calculate and predict how susceptible or prone any coal might be towards <b>spontaneous</b> <b>heating</b> before its use in any industry. As a Mining Engineer some steps towards the prevention were noted from the observations of earlier investigators and some suggestions are made from our findings which may reduce the possibilities of tendencies towards auto-oxidation and also to find some suitable way to minimize the threat caused due to this <b>spontaneous</b> <b>heating...</b>|$|E
40|$|Differential Scanning Calorimetric (DSC) {{applications}} in coal sciences have expanded rapidly. Various researchers observed {{that some of}} the methods to determine <b>spontaneous</b> <b>heating</b> are time consuming, tedious and do not give reproducible results. DSC instruments are usually employed under identical experimental conditions to track the reaction type (i. e., endothermic or exothermic), to calculate kinetics and heat flow rates. Application of DSC for determination of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>heating</b> of coal and suitability in this area is described...|$|E
40|$|Based on the dressed-atom approach, {{we discuss}} a {{two-dimensional}} (2 D) radio-frequency trap for neutral atoms, {{in which the}} trap potential derives from the magnetic-dipole transition among the hyperfine Zeeman sublevels. By adjusting the detuning of the radiation from resonance, the trapping states will be changed predominantly from the bare states Of m(FgF) > 0 to other states of m(FgF) 0. In comparison to the optical field, the radio-frequency trap eliminates the <b>spontaneous</b> emission <b>heating</b> of the atoms. Unlike other oscillating traps reported in the e literature, {{the configuration of the}} radio-frequency trap is suitable for realization of a miniature magnetic guide...|$|R

In 1748 Needham, in support of his theory of <b>spontaneous</b> generation, <b>heated</b> putrefiable substances in well-corked flasks, Within a few days his flaskswere peopled with micro-organisms. This, to Needham, wae proof that his theory of spontaneous generation was tenable. Spallanzai, however, in 1765, boiled meat extract for one hour and a half in hermetically sealed flasks and observed that no decomposition of the extract occurred there after. In 1782 Scheele advised the application of this principle to the preservation of vinegar. [ [...] . ...|$|R

The finite-lattice {{method of}} series {{expansions}} has been {{combined with a}} new extrapolation procedure to extend the low-temperature series for the specific <b>heat,</b> <b>spontaneous</b> magnetization, and susceptibility of the spin- 1 Ising model on the square lattice. The extended series were derived by directly calculating the series to order 99 (in the variable u D exp[−J=kBT] / and using the new extrapolation procedure to calculate an additional 13 – 14 terms. 1...|$|R
