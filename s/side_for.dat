5|$|Caragiale had by then {{proceeded}} to research the matter on his own, {{and came to the}} independent conclusion that the accusations were entirely concocted. Late in 1901, he opened a legal case against both Caion and Stoenescu, taken up by the Ilfov County court. On the first day, Caion excused himself as sick, while Stoenescu recused himself, taking the prosecution's <b>side.</b> <b>For</b> these reasons, the trial was held without a jury.|$|E
5|$|Despite a low-scoring {{start to}} the 2003 English cricket season, in which he passed 40 only once in his first seven innings of the season, he kept {{his place in the}} Test <b>side</b> <b>for</b> the visit of the touring Zimbabweans. Batting at number five in both Tests, Key failed to make much of an impact, scoring 18 runs in the first match and four in the second. He had reason to feel aggrieved at his first Test dismissalumpire Steve Bucknor gave him out caught behind, despite Key not hitting the ball.|$|E
5|$|Dumouriez {{would bear}} a harsh change of fortune: after one more {{influential}} success in November 1792 at Jemappes, {{he was by}} the following year a broken man.

5|$|On {{a similar}} note, both {{countries}} {{would continue to}} conceal any war crimes committed by the other <b>side</b> <b>for</b> {{the remainder of the}} war. The Holocaust was systematically concealed by the leadership in Tokyo, just as Japanese war crimes, e.g. the situation in China, were kept secret from the German public. An example would be the atrocities committed by the Japanese Army in Nanking in 1937, which were denounced by German industrialist John Rabe. Subsequently, the German leadership ordered Rabe back to Berlin, confiscating all his reports and prohibiting any further discussion of the topic.|$|E

5|$|Ripken's power, {{which led}} to records such as most home runs by a shortstop and 13th place in career doubles, had consequences. His {{propensity}} to drive the ball often led to his grounders getting to fielders quickly for tailor-made double-play balls. In 1999, Ripken passed Hank Aaron as the player who had grounded into the most double plays in his career. Ripken is third on the fielding <b>side</b> <b>for</b> double plays by a shortstop (1565, behind Omar Vizquel's 1734 and Ozzie Smith's 1590).|$|E
