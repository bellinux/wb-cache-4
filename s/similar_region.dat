5|$|The first {{system of}} the season proper {{originated}} out of an area of convection in early September in the northeast portion of the basin. On September3, the MFR initiated advisories on Tropical Disturbance A1 about 1435km (890mi) east of Diego Garcia. The system tracked westward, and the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) on September4. Failing to intensify beyond winds of 45km/h (30mph), the disturbance dissipated on September6. Later in the month, Tropical Disturbance A2 formed in a <b>similar</b> <b>region</b> within the monsoon trough, with the MFR initiating advisories on September29. Also on that day, the JTWC began issuing advisories on Tropical Cyclone 02S. That day, the JTWC upgraded the system to tropical storm status, although strong wind shear prevented intensification. The MFR quickly discontinued advisories, but the JTWC continued tracking it, again upgrading the system to tropical storm status on October1. After the shear again increased, the storm weakened, dissipating on October2.|$|E
5|$|When Sedna was discovered, its extreme orbit raised {{questions}} about its origin. Its perihelion is so distant (approximately 75 AU) that no currently observed mechanism can explain Sedna's eccentric distant orbit. It is {{too far from the}} planets to have been affected by the gravity of Neptune or the other giant planets and too bound to the Sun to be affected by outside forces such as the galactic tides. Hypotheses to explain its orbit include that it was affected by a passing star, that it was captured from another planetary system, or that it was tugged into its current position by a trans-Neptunian planet. The most obvious solution to determining Sedna's peculiar orbit would be to locate a number of objects in a <b>similar</b> <b>region,</b> whose various orbital configurations would provide an indication as to their history. If Sedna had been pulled into its orbit by a trans-Neptunian planet, any other objects found in its region would have a similar perihelion to Sedna (around 80 AU).|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the storms which attained at least tropical storm strength in 1940, five additional tropical depressions were analyzed by the HURDAT reanalysis project to have developed during the season. Due to their weak intensity, however, they were not added to HURDAT. On September 2, a closed low-pressure area was detected in the open Atlantic Ocean southeast of Bermuda and was analyzed as a tropical depression. At the time, the disturbance had a minimum pressure of at least 1015 mbar (hPa; 29.98 inHg). The depression initially moved to the southeast, but later recurved towards the northwest {{over the next two}} days. On September 4, the S.S. West Kebar en route for Boston, Massachusetts reported winds of 40 mph (65 km/h), which would be considered as tropical storm-force winds. The depression later moved to the northeast before it was absorbed by a stationary front on September 7. Since there was only one report that the disturbance may have reached tropical storm intensity, it was not included in HURDAT. Later on September 10, a trough was detected in a <b>similar</b> <b>region</b> in the Atlantic where the first depression formed. The trough later became sufficiently organized to be classified as a tropical depression. The cyclone moved slowly to the east and did not further intensify before dissipating on September 13.|$|E

40|$|Though DNA {{sequencing}} {{has improved}} {{dramatically over the}} past decade, variant calling, which {{is the process of}} reconstructing a patient’s genome from the reads that the sequencers produce, remains a difficult problem, largely due to the genome’s redundant structure. In this thesis, we describe SiRen, our algorithm for characterizing the genome’s structure {{in a way that makes}} sense from the perspective of the reads themselves. We use the term <b>similar</b> <b>regions</b> to refer to the areas of redundancy that we have identified. We then confirm that the <b>similar</b> <b>regions</b> are characterized by low variant calling accuracy. We show that the structure of the <b>similar</b> <b>regions</b> provides a platform for repairing alignment errors, thus leading to significantly improved variant calling accuracy...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} a multiple alignment program named MAP 2 {{based on a}} generalized pairwise global align-ment algorithm for handling long, different intergenic and intragenic regions in genomic sequences. The MAP 2 program produces an ordered list of local mul-tiple alignments of <b>similar</b> <b>regions</b> among sequences, where different regions between local alignments are indicated by reporting only <b>similar</b> <b>regions.</b> We propose two similarity measures {{for the evaluation of}} the performance of MAP 2 and existing multiple alignment programs. Experimental results produced by MAP 2 on four real sets of orthologous genomic sequences show that MAP 2 rarely missed a block of transitively <b>similar</b> <b>regions</b> and that MAP 2 never produced a block of regions that are not transitively similar. Experimental results by MAP 2 on six simulated data sets show that MAP 2 found the boundaries between <b>similar</b> and different <b>regions</b> precisely.

25|$|Predictions of the QSER1 protein {{structure}} {{indicate that the}} protein contains many alpha helices. NCBI cBLAST predicted structural similarity between the QSER1 protein and the Schizosaccharomyces pombe (fission yeast) RNA Polymerase II A chain. The two regions of similarity occur between amino acids 56-194 and 322-546. This first region (56-194) is a regulatory region in both the human and yeast RNA Polymerase II containing multiple repeats of the sequence YSPTSPSYS. Phosphorylation of serine residues in this region regulates progression through the steps of gene transcription. A 3D structure was provided for this region.

500|$|Observations {{from the}} SMARTS {{telescope}} {{show that in}} visible light Sedna {{is one of the}} reddest objects in the Solar System, nearly as red as Mars. Chad Trujillo and his colleagues suggest that Sedna's dark red colour is caused by a surface coating of hydrocarbon sludge, or tholin, formed from simpler organic compounds after long exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Its surface is homogeneous in colour and spectrum; this may be because Sedna, unlike objects nearer the Sun, is rarely impacted by other bodies, which would expose bright patches of fresh icy material like that on 8405 Asbolus. Sedna and two other very distant objects – [...] and [...] – share their color with outer classical Kuiper belt objects and the centaur 5145 Pholus, suggesting a <b>similar</b> <b>region</b> of origin.|$|E
