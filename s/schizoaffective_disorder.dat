5|$|If {{signs of}} {{disturbance}} are present {{for more than}} a month but less than six months, the diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder is applied. Psychotic symptoms lasting less than a month may be diagnosed as brief psychotic disorder, and various conditions may be classed as psychotic disorder not otherwise specified, while <b>schizoaffective</b> <b>disorder</b> is diagnosed if symptoms of mood disorder are substantially present alongside psychotic symptoms. If the psychotic symptoms are the direct physiological result of a general medical condition or a substance, then the diagnosis is one of a psychosis secondary to that condition. Schizophrenia is not diagnosed if symptoms of pervasive developmental disorder are present unless prominent delusions or hallucinations are also present.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{prevalence}} of type II diabetes among individuals suffering from schizophrenia or <b>schizoaffective</b> <b>disorders</b> {{is more than}} double that of the general population. By 2005, North American professional medical associations of Psychiatry, Diabetes, and Endocrinology responded by recommending continuous metabolic monitoring for this population to control complications from obesity and diabetes. However, these recommendations do not identify the types of effective treatment for people with schizophrenia who have type II diabetes. To fill this gap, this systematic evidence review identifies effective lifestyle interventions that enhance quality care in individuals who are suffering from type II diabetes and schizophrenia or other <b>schizoaffective</b> <b>disorders.</b> Methods A systematic search from Medline, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and ISI Web of Science was conducted. Of the 1810 unique papers that were retrieved, four met the inclusion/exclusion criteria and were analyzed. Results The results indicate that diabetes education is effective when it incorporates diet and exercise components, while using a design that addresses challenges such as cognition, motivation, and weight gain that may result from antipsychotics. Conclusions This paper begins to point to effective interventions that will improve type II diabetes management for people with schizophrenia or other <b>schizoaffective</b> <b>disorders.</b> </p...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} examine the {{descriptive}} validity of ICD- 10 schizophrenia, 1, 476 consecutively admitted in-patients {{were included in the}} present study.

They were younger than patients with persistent delusional <b>disorders</b> and <b>schizoaffective</b> <b>disorders</b> but older than patients with acute and transient psychotic disorders.

However, little is known how clinical factors (e. g. age of illness onset, length of hospital stay, type of antipsychotic medications, and duration of illness) are associated with cognitive functioning in patients with schizophrenia. This study aimed to examine the influence of socio-demographic and clinical factors on cognitive domains measured using Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) among patients with schizophrenia or <b>schizoaffective</b> <b>disorders</b> residing in a psychiatric institute in Singapore. A single-phase interview was conducted at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia or <b>schizoaffective</b> <b>disorders</b> (n= 110). MMSE was administered to all participants. Data on socio-demographic characteristics, smoking, alcohol consumption, and medical history were collected.

After adjusting for all socio-demographic correlates, longer length of hospital stay remained significant in predicting lower MMSE scores.

The incidence of complications was not related significantly with age and sex of patients but there was significant relationship between the duration of medication and dosage of drug (pv< 0. 05).

40|$|Biological {{studies of}} the {{relationships}} between the <b>schizoaffective</b> <b>disorders,</b> the affective disorders, and schizo-phrenia suggest that no simple reduc-tionist model is supported by currently available data. Thus, both affective and schizoaffective patients but not schizophrenics, manifest abnormalities such as decreased platelet serotonin (5 -HT) uptake, blunted clonldine-induced increase in serum growth hormone, shortened latency of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and increased REM density. However, there are some types of studies which show greater similarity between schizoaffective and schizophrenic patients than between schizoaffectives and affecHves—e. g., increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) norepi-nephrine levels, increased platelet 5 -HT content, and decreased prostaglandin E,-stimulated adenylate cydase activity. Other types of studies show abnormalities common to all three groups of psychoses— e. g., eye tracking dysfunction, elevated CSF concentration of y-aminobutyric add, and neuro-muscular abnormalities. There are also abnormalities that have been reported to be present in only one type of the psychoses. Although none of these findings have been so unequivocally demonstrated that they can be considered to be firmly estab-lished, they do suggest that it is premature to condude that the <b>schizoaffective</b> <b>disorders</b> are subtypes of the affective disorders. The possi-bility of a continuum model of the psychiatric psychoses of unknown etiology merits further consideration. Further biological studies of a broad range of psychiatric psychoses with indusion of the schizoaffective categories appear indicated. Surprisingly few biological studies have been devoted to a comparison of <b>schizoaffective</b> <b>disorders</b> with the other major psychotic syndromes. This is partly due to the relatively small percentage of schizoaffective patients in most clinical populations when narrow criteria for schizo-affective illness, such as the Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC) (Spitzer, Endicott, and Robins 1978), are used.

40|$|Background and Objectives: Heart rate {{variability}} (HRV) is {{a simple}} and noninvasive measure to estimate autonomic nervous system function, mainly the parasympathetic contribution. Previous studies of HRV in schizophrenia suggest a reduced cardiac vagal activity that might, to some extent, account for the increased risk of cardiovascular mortality in schizophrenic patients. In catatonic schizophrenia, autonomic dysfunction can bring about the rare but life-threatening syndrome of malignant catatonia. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate whether cardiac vagal activity as assessed by HRV is reduced in patients with catatonic schizophrenia compared to patients with other subtypes of schizophrenia, schizophreniform or <b>schizoaffective</b> <b>disorders.</b> Methods: HRV was evaluated in 70 patients, 21 patients with catatonic schizophrenia (ICD- 10 F 20. 2), 29 patients with non-catatonic schizophrenia (ICD- 10 F 20. 0 /F 20. 1) and 20 patients with schizophreniform or <b>schizoaffective</b> <b>disorders</b> (ICD- 10 F 23 /F 25) during a five-minute period of metronome-guided breathing. Frequency domain analyses were carried out and high frequency power (HF) was calculated in normalized units (HFnorm) as an indirect measure of cardiac vagal modulation. Results: No significant difference in HFnorm could be found between patients with catatonic and non-catatonic schizophrenia. Patients with catatonic and non-catatonic schizophrenia demonstrated a non-significant trend towards lower HFnorm values in comparison to patients with schizophreniform or <b>schizoaffective</b> <b>disorders</b> (p ≤ 0. 1). Taking into account the significant reduction of HFnorm found in patients who received lorazepam as adjuvant therapy to antipsychotics or other psychotropic drugs, the aforementioned tendency was not seen anymore. Conclusions: Impairment of cardiac parasympathetic function seems to be related to the chronic course of schizophrenia rather than to the catatonic subtype. A possible vagolytic effect of lorazepam would be clinically relevant particularly with regard to a combination with other psychotropic drugs affecting HRV such as antipsychotics. A potentiation of vagolytic effects might further increase cardiovascular risk factors in schizophrenic patients who are already at a high risk for cardiovascular mortality...|$|R
