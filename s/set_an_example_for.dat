This is accepted in the Jain tradition as what started the tradition of alms giving in its various forms, and one that has continued since ancient times in India.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Mikhail Gorbachev became Secretary-General of the Soviet Communist Party. A reformer, he {{implemented}} {{measures to}} increase {{freedom of the}} press (glasnost) and economic decentralization (perestroika) in an attempt to strengthen socialism. Like many orthodox Marxist critics, Castro feared that the reforms would weaken the socialist state and allow capitalist elements to regain control. Gorbachev conceded to U.S. demands to reduce support for Cuba, with Soviet-Cuban relations deteriorating. When Gorbachev visited Cuba in April 1989, he informed Castro that perestroika meant an end to subsidies for Cuba. Ignoring calls for liberalization in accordance with the Soviet example, Castro continued to clamp down on internal dissidents and in particular kept tabs on the military, the primary threat to the government. A number of senior military officers, including Ochoa and Tony de la Guardia, were investigated for corruption and complicity in cocaine smuggling, tried, and executed in 1989, despite calls for leniency. On medical advice given him in October 1985, Castro gave up regularly smoking Cuban cigars, helping to <b>set</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>for</b> the rest of the populace. Castro became passionate in his denunciation of the Third World debt problem, arguing that the Third World would never escape the debt that First World banks and governments imposed upon it. In 1985, Havana hosted five international conferences on the world debt problem.|$|E

25|$|In the 2nd and 1st millennia BC, {{a series}} of large and {{powerful}} states developed on the southern periphery of Central Asia (the Ancient Near East).

25|$|Gurūpasattiḥ (Sanskrit: गुरूपसत्तिः). Paraśurāma is {{welcomed by}} Śiva at Kailāsa. Śiva {{promises}} to offer all his knowledge to his disciple. Śiva tells Paraśurāma {{that he knows}} {{him to be the}} Avatāra of Rāma, who knows everything beforehand but is studying from a Guru only to <b>set</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>for</b> others. The education of Paraśurāma begins. Paraśurāma masters all Vedic Mantras on just hearing them once from his Guru. Śiva teaches him all the eighteen Vidyās. Paraśurāma serves Śiva like the ideal disciple, waking up early morning, getting water and victuals for his Guru, pleasing Śiva and his consort Pārvatī in every way. The Samāvartana Saṃskāra (end of student life) of Paraśurāma is performed by Śiva, who blesses his disciple by saying that may the eighteen Vidyās be ever with him, and may his weapons be ever virtuous. Śiva orders him to assume a furious form when Rāma breaks Pināka, the bow of Śiva, in Mithilā. Śiva further ordains Paraśurāma to surrender his bow and arrows to Rāma, and to merge his Avatāra into the Rāma Avatāra. For the rest of his life, Paraśurāma is asked to perform penance on the Mahendra mountain. Finally Śiva says that Paraśurāma will be among the seven seers (Saptarṣi) in the eighth Manvantara of Sāvarṇi Manu, just like his father Jamadagni is one in the seventh Manvantara of Vaivasvata Manu. Paraśurāma bows to Śiva and asks permission to leave.|$|E

25|$|Convinced {{that the}} Chinese soldier was {{the equal of}} any given proper care and leadership, Stilwell {{established}} a training center (in Ramgarh, India, 200 miles west of Calcutta) for two divisions of Chinese troops from forces that had retreated to Assam from Burma. His effort in this regard met passive, sometimes active, resistance from the British, who feared that armed, disciplined Chinese would <b>set</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>for</b> Indian insurgents, and from Chiang Kai-shek who did not welcome a strong military unit outside of his control. From the outset, Stilwell's primary goals were {{the opening of a}} land route to China from northern Burma and India by means of a ground offensive in northern Burma, so that more supplies could be transported to China, and to organize, equip, and train a reorganized, reequipped, modernized, and competent Chinese army that would fight the Japanese in the China-Burma-India theater (CBI). Stilwell argued that the CBI was the only area at that time where the possibility existed for the Allies of engaging large numbers of troops against their common enemy, Japan. Unfortunately, the huge airborne logistical train of support from the USA to British India was still being organized, while supplies being flown over the Hump were barely sufficient to maintain Chennault's air operations and replace some Chinese war losses, let alone equip and supply an entire army. Additionally, critical supplies intended for the CBI were being diverted due to various crises in other combat theaters. Of the supplies that made it over the Hump a certain percentage were diverted by Chinese (and American) personnel into the black market for their personal enrichment. As a result, most Allied commanders in India, with the exception of General Orde Wingate and his Chindit operations, were focused on defensive measures.|$|E
