40|$|International audienceEver {{since its}} {{development}} by the British psychiatrist John Bowlby in 1973, {{the theory of}} parent-child attachment has elicited {{a great deal of}} research. According to this theory, a child is born with a behavioral system which enables the child, when in a <b>situation</b> <b>of</b> <b>distress,</b> to seek protection with an attachment figure, typically the mother. For nearly forty years, Bowlby's theory has attempted to define the role and the characteristics of both the child and the attachment figure, while also showing that children who are secure in their relationship with a parent spend more time exploring their environment and demonstrate better social adjustment that children considered insecure. Research has also shown that, in addition to the mother, other people, especially within the family, can serve as attachment figures for children. Parallel to this, the family system theory has developed. This theory introduces the idea that the family, with all its different members, functions as a system comprised of multiple subsystems (intergenerational, marital, coparental, parent-child and sibling) which are both autonomous and interdependent. In our study, we chose to associate these two theories so as to reveal, for each member of the family (father, mother, oldest and youngest children), the perception of the different types of parent-child attachment existing within the family (mother-oldest child attachment, mother-youngest child attachment and father-oldest child attachment, father-youngest child attachment). This is a novel approach in that it makes it possible to demonstrate that perceptions vary from person to person and that certain variables carry more weight than others in family dynamics. This approach also helps to explain why a brother and sister from the same sibling group may each have a different type of attachment to the same caregiver and why a child may have a different type of attachment to each parent...|$|E
40|$|The {{literature}} on fiscal adjustment {{focuses on the}} determinants of "successful" adjustment episodes that generate desirable outcomes (such as lower debt levels), but it generally ignores whether an adjustment is needed or not. This paper introduces the notion of adjustment need, which is a period <b>of</b> severe fiscal <b>distress</b> that signals a clear need for consolidation. This new concept allows the author to empirically investigate the role of political and institutional factors in determining why countries get into fiscal distress, why some are able to fiscally consolidate when required, and why others are unable to adjust despite an evident need to do so. For developing economies, strong scores for broad measures of institutional quality (e. g. rule of law indices) are found to help avoid <b>situations</b> <b>of</b> fiscal <b>distress,</b> but weaker scores characterize those countries that actually manage to make large adjustments. For advanced countries, the results highlight the importance of budgetary institutions: fiscal rules contribute to avoiding <b>situations</b> <b>of</b> fiscal <b>distress,</b> and fiscal performance management systems improve the odds of implementing adjustments.

40|$|Background: The aim of {{the study}} was to examine the proneness, the {{functions}} and triggering <b>situations</b> <b>of</b> weeping in anorexic and bulimic women. Methods: Participants were 36 anorexic and 31 bulimic female patients and 56 age-matched female controls. All women completed the Questionnaire on Adult Crying. We limited our study to results on 'crying proneness', 'functions of crying' and 'determining factors of crying'. Results: Bulimic patients reported to have cried significantly more often in the last 4 weeks, to be more likely to cry in <b>situations</b> <b>of</b> <b>distress</b> and to have used weeping significantly more often as a manipulative behavior than control women. Anorexic patients rated their tendency to cry significantly lower and experienced weeping as significantly more negative than controls. Conclusions: Compared to control women, anorexic patients associated weeping with negative feelings as opposed to bulimic patients who appeared to use weeping on an intentional basis. These deviations from control women seem to mirror the introvert character of anorexic patients and the extrovert impulsive personality of patients with bulimia nervosa, respectively. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{walks the}} reader through the {{research}} and design process of ‘Break’, a product for adolescent cancer patients. The design empowers adolescent children {{to deal with a}} situation of powerlessness, thereby fostering a positive self-image. This graduation project is part of the “Meedoen=Groeien” project of TU Delft and the Prinses Maxima centrum (PMC) for childhood oncology. The PMC employs a developmental care approach, meaning they focus {{on the development of the}} child, also in the context of family wellbeing. The approach can therefore be described as inclusive: It takes the physical, psychological and social needs of the entire family into consideration. In order to achieve this, this project extends the support framework to the home environment of the adolescent individual. ¬ Phase 1 : analysis This first phase focussed on the understanding of the context in which adolescents aged between 15 – 20 years suffering from cancer operate. Literature research was conducted investigating a child’s development during older adolescence as well as the impact of cancer on this development. The main challenge for the adolescent while growing up is to understand and accept the person they are. This informed the following design question: How can adolescent cancer patients be empowered to develop and maintain a positive self-image? The key insight gained indicates that being accepting of one’s own situation results in a more positive self-image. Six cancer patients were interviewed using the context mapping method in order to understand their needs and wants. The ‘Momentos’ concept, which was developed as part of this graduation project, was used to further narrow down the scope of the project. One specific moment in an adolescent’s life was chosen to design for: Walking through the school corridors and being suspiciously stared at. Moments like these makes an adolescent feel powerless, resulting in insecurity or sadness. Phase 2 : Conceptualisation The second phase involved several ideation activities. The resulting concepts were co-evaluated with cancer survivors, which informed several milestone insights. One insight was that all adolescents have the need to feel normal. This can be achieved by involving peers into the interaction facilitated by the design. That way, adolescents can accept and perceive the proposed design concept as something within the social normal instead of something unusual. Another insight was that participants valued ideas with a physical nature. They provided them with a tangible reminder of their significant relations with peers, while also providing a personal aid in dealing with stressful situations. Two main concept directions fitting the design requirements were iteratively explored, of which one matured into the final concept. Phase 3 : Detailing This conceptual product, called ‘Break’, is a wearable device that can be attached to wire of existing earbuds. Adolescent cancer patients can distribute ‘Break’ to their loved ones and friends, thereby building an empowering social framework. Within this social network, users can listen to and share a song of personal meaning with others. The device is based on the interaction of bending (‘breaking’) the device. When bending, a song out of the selection will be played. That way, the adolescent cancer patient can actively influence his emotions in a <b>situation</b> <b>of</b> <b>distress.</b> Aspects of this concept were further elaborated through fast iterations during this detailing phase. Interactions and technical questions were addressed, amongst others. An interactive prototyping approach was chosen in order to achieve this. Phase 4 : Evaluation & conclusion A final evaluation was conducted during this phase, involving one cancer survivor with a friend. Several prototypes detailing different aspects of the final concept were provided to the participants for evaluation. While both participants were very positive about the concept, the cancer patient expressed particular enthusiasm about the social aspects of the concept, whereas his friend related to the tangible nature of the interaction most. This shows that the design concept accommodates the needs of the two main stakeholders. As a recommendation for further research, other stakeholders, such as family members and hospital staff should be included in the testing procedures. Furthermore, detailing work on certain aspects of the concept remains to be done. Finally, the product should be long-term tested and evaluated with hospital professionals.

25|$|In infants, {{behavior}} {{associated with}} attachment {{is primarily a}} process of proximity seeking to an identified attachment figure in <b>situations</b> <b>of</b> perceived <b>distress</b> or alarm, {{for the purpose of}} survival.

During the later part of this period, children begin to use attachment figures (familiar people) as a secure base to explore from and return to. Parental responses lead to the development of patterns of attachment which in turn lead to 'internal working models' which will guide the individual's feelings, thoughts, and expectations in later relationships. Separation anxiety or grief following serious loss are normal and natural responses in an attached infant.|$|R
40|$|I devoted my diploma thesis to the {{research}} on children’s perception of death and bereavement, and {{on the importance of}} children’s literature as one of the possible approaches for children to learn about death and grief. I have also tried to show that children’s literature can be of great help when loss actually occurs in the family. The definition of grief, the general characteristics of bereavement, and the changes it brings are defined in the theoretical section. The process of children’s bereavement is explained in greater detail – from how they acknowledge death to the differences between the mourning of children and adults. I have also emphasized the importance of honesty when talking to children about death, and the importance of providing help when death occurs in the family, especially if there are difficulties in the mourning process. In the end, I also define a fairytale and its importance for children. Fairytales can be a great method for parents, or any professional who works with children, to use when trying to help a child to understand death, dying and grief. The empirical section includes {{the research}} about existing children’s literature on death and bereavement, published in Slovenia after 1990, and consists of 5 hypotheses, which I have tried to prove.

40|$|This {{clinical}} project aims {{to explore}} how art psychotherapy offers a transitional space in which traumatic feelings can be identified and worked through in a symbolic way. Research has shown that art psychotherapy is an effective intervention for clients who have experienced trauma. It helps them visualise and symbolically communicate these traumatic thoughts and feelings. Trauma reveals aspects of the infantile self; it therefore exposes one’s early experiences. When working with trauma in therapy, {{it is important to}} value the complexity of one’s psyche and historical factors that shaped his/her experience. Core psychodynamic theories illustrate the importance of the early caregiver-child relationships in terms of the individual’s holistic development, later interpersonal relationship, and response to <b>situations</b> <b>of</b> <b>distress.</b> Adopting a mother- child dyadic approach to art psychotherapy, this single case study illustrates how a mother was able to safely explore her identity and perceptions of traumatic events in her adult lifetime, in reference to her childhood nurturing experiences with her parents. These were examined through her interaction with her child, the art therapist and art-products that she made. Two questions informed this case study inquiry. Firstly, to what extent the combination of a short term mother-child joint therapeutic intervention plus art psychotherapy could illuminate and give meaning to one’s past traumatic experiences. Secondly, does a single case study meet the challenge of integrating individual human experience with the broader field of qualitative art psychotherapy research? Hermeneutic phenomenology was chosen as the most suitable approach to observe the particular mother-child-therapist interactions and art products, within the broader context of relevant literature and already existing research.

Within a local community, ECO 2 model-based intervention seeks the articulation of a resources network, create an operational network (communitarian subjective social networks of the operators that intervene) and increase the effective complexity of people’s social networks, especially those in <b>situations</b> <b>of</b> severe social exclusion...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} project analysed the different methods of consumer protection vis-à-vis consumer credit agreements. Nowadays {{the emphasis is}} on the information paradigm, according to which the well informed and circumspect consumer can make free and rational decisions if and to the extent he is given full, correct and understandable information. The first part of the project gives an overview of (i) the foundations of respectively EU and Belgian Contract and Consumer law and (ii) critically examines the information paradigm in the field of consumer credit regulation, as it is currently the EU's and most national legislators' preferred consumer protection method. Part two and three look into the legal grounds, risks and advantages of a right to alter credit agreements unilaterally or by mutual agreement, the right of early repayment, etc. These risks and advantages are weighed in normal situations as well as in a <b>situation</b> <b>of</b> financial <b>distress</b> <b>of</b> one of the contracting parties due to unforeseeable changed circumstances. To the extent such rights and/or legal grounds do not establish an appropriate level of consumer protection after signing the consumer credit agreement, the possibilities of and the respective grounds for a better substantive protection of the 'financial' consumer were studied upon and some changesde lege ferenda were proposed. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Bankruptcy {{law is a}} {{necessary}} feature of a modern economy, and the principles for a bankruptcy apply whether the debtor {{happens to be a}} sovereign or not. The essential point is that markets cannot handle <b>situations</b> <b>of</b> extreme financial <b>distress</b> or debtor-creditor workouts in an efficient manner without a sound legal framework. Indeed, Adam Smith himself was a champion of applying bankruptcy processes to insolvent sovereign debtors, arguing that when the situation warranted it, bankruptcy was a sensible alternative to the chaotic ways that sovereign insolvency was otherwise handled. Thus, the fact that the private financial community continues to oppose a sovereign bankruptcy law is quite unconvincing, especially since an enormous number of countries has had a sovereign workout at some point in history...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{know the}} {{strategies}} of resistance adopted by nursing staff, facing <b>situations</b> <b>of</b> moral <b>distress,</b> from an ethical perspective. METHOD: The authors conducted qualitative research through semi-structured interviews, with fifteen nursing staff members of a university hospital in the extreme south of Brazil, using textual discourse analysis and the theoretical reference of Foucault. RESULTS: Two categories were constructed: denial of oneself and the other - in which one perceives that the nursing staff can perform actions that are governed predominantly by immobility and conformism, avoiding confrontations with whoever represents power in situations that provoke moral distress in them; possibility to care for oneself and for the other - in which nursing workers in situations that provoke moral distress for them exercise power and endurance. CONCLUSION: it was perceived that some professionals seem to use ethical coping strategies, {{in order to ensure}} and preserve their professional values. However, often the choice of some nursing professionals may be to relapse into immobility and the absence of building strategies <b>of</b> endurance. This <b>situation</b> may represent their reduced exercise of power and insufficient resistance in the face of ethical problems, contributing to the intensification of their invisibility in the area of health...|$|R
