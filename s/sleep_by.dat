5|$|In 144 BC, Viriathus {{formed a}} league against Rome with several Celtiberian tribes and persuaded them to rise against Rome too, in the Second Numantine War. Viriathus' new {{coalition}} bested Roman armies at the Second Battle of Mount Venus in 144 BC {{and again at}} the failed Siege of Erisone. In 139 BC, Viriathus was finally killed in his <b>sleep</b> <b>by</b> three of his companions who had been promised gifts by Rome.

5|$|The aye-aye {{is almost}} universally viewed unfavorably across Madagascar, though the tales vary from village to village and region to region. If people see an aye-aye, they may kill it and hang the corpse on a pole near a road {{outside of town}} (so others can carry the bad {{fortunes}} away) or burn their village and move. The superstitions behind aye-aye fady include beliefs that they kill and eat chickens or people, that they kill people in their <b>sleep</b> <b>by</b> cutting their aortic vein, that they embody ancestral spirits, or that they warn of illness, death, or bad luck in the family. As of 1970, {{the people of the}} Marolambo District in the Toamasina Province feared the aye-aye because they believed it had supernatural powers. Because of this, no one was allowed to mock, kill, or eat one.|$|E

25|$|In general, {{muscle relaxants}} are not {{approved}} by FDA for long-term use.

25|$|Opioid {{medications}} such as hydrocodone, oxycodone, and morphine {{are used}} for insomnia {{that is associated with}} pain due to their analgesic properties and hypnotic effects.

The function of REM sleep is uncertain but a lack of it impairs the ability to learn complex tasks. Functional paralysis from muscular atonia in REM may be necessary to protect organisms from self-damage through physically acting out scenes from the often-vivid dreams that occur during this stage.|$|E

Fluffy is based on Cerberus, the three-headed dog from Greek mythology that guards the gates to the underworld. As with Fluffy, Cerberus was lulled to sleep with music by Orpheus.|$|E
25|$|In Manila in {{the early}} hours of January 30, 1911, people were awakened out of their <b>sleep</b> <b>by</b> what they at first took for loud thunder. The {{illusion}} was heightened when great streaks of lightning were seen to illumine the southern sky. Those who investigated further, however, soon learned the truth. A huge, fan-shaped cloud of what looked like black smoke rose to a great height. It was crossed and crisscrossed with a brilliant electrical display, which the people of Manila at first took for lightning. This cloud finally shot up in the air, spread, then dissipated, and this marked the culmination of the eruption, at about 2:30 a. m.|$|E

25|$|Working {{extended}} {{hours or}} overnight shifts also poses the added difficulty of requiring performance from an individual at a time with the body is driven to <b>sleep</b> <b>by</b> the circadian system. Sleep, alertness, and cognitive functioning {{are determined by the}} interaction of two processes: the endogenous circadian pacemaker and the homeostatic drive for sleep. The endogenous circadian pacemaker generates the 24-hour circadian rhythm that regulates subjective alertness and sleep propensity as well as core body temperature, cognitive functions, and melatonin secretion, as described above. It is also highly sensitive to light, which is its primary synchronization. Misalignment of the circadian rhythm results in disturbed sleep, impaired performance alertness, waking-hour melatonin secretion, and reduced levels of nocturnal secretion of growth hormone. The outcome, therefore, can range from performance error to long-term health decrements.|$|E
25|$|The reticular {{activating}} system {{consists of}} three groups of neurons in the brain stem: pedunculopontine nucleus, locus caeruleus and raphe nucleus. When awake, it receives all kinds of non-specific sensory information and relays them to the cortex. It also modulates fight or flight responses and is hence linked to the motor system. During sleep onset, it acts via two pathways. The first is the cholinergic pathway that clears the way for thalamocortical transmission; {{the second is the}} monoaminergic pathway (which starts in the upper brain and projects to the hypothalamus and cerebral cortex) that can cause wakefulness if inactive. It is also predicted {{to play a role in}} REM <b>sleep</b> <b>by</b> modulating muscle tone, causing the muscle atonia characteristic of REM sleep. During NREM sleep this system is blocked by the preoptic nucleus neurons.|$|E
25|$|The {{trial of}} those {{responsible}} {{was held in}} the city of Viterbo, starting in the summer of 1950. During the trial, Scelba was again accused of involvement in the plot to carry out the massacre, but the accusations were often contradictionary or vague. In the end, the judge concluded that no higher authority had ordered the massacre, and that the Giuliano band had acted autonomously. At the trial Pisciotta said: “Again and again Scelba has gone back on his word: Mattarella and Cusumano returned to Rome to plead for total amnesty for us, but Scelba denied all his promises.” Pisciotta also claimed that he had killed Salvatore Giuliano in his <b>sleep</b> <b>by</b> arrangement with Scelba. However, {{there was no evidence that}} Scelba had had any relationship with Pisciotta.|$|E
