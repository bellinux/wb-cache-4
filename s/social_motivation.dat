25|$|Support for {{the social}} and genetic {{function}} of aggregations, especially those formed by fish, {{can be seen in}} several aspects of their behaviour. For instance, experiments have shown that individual fish removed from a school will have a higher respiratory rate than those found in the school. This effect has been attributed to stress, and the effect of being with conspecifics therefore appears to be a calming one and a powerful <b>social</b> <b>motivation</b> for remaining in an aggregation. Herring, for instance, will become very agitated if they are isolated from conspecifics. Because of their adaptation to schooling behaviour they are rarely displayed in aquaria. Even with the best facilities aquaria can offer they become fragile and sluggish compared to their quivering energy in wild schools.|$|E
25|$|<b>Social</b> <b>motivation</b> {{is tied to}} one's {{activity}} in a group. It cannot form from a single mind alone. For example, bowling alone is naught but the dull act of throwing a ball into pins, and so people are {{much less likely to}} smile during the activity alone, even upon getting a strike because their satisfaction or dissatisfaction {{does not need to be}} communicated, and so it is internalized. However, when with a group, people are more inclined to smile regardless of their results because it acts as a positive communication that is beneficial for pleasurable interaction and teamwork. Thus the act of bowling becomes a social activity as opposed to a dull action because it becomes an exercise in interaction, competition, team building, and sportsmanship. It is because of this phenomenon that studies have shown that people are more intrigued in performing mundane activities so long as there is company because it provides the opportunity to interact in one way or another, be it for bonding, amusement, collaboration, or alternative perspectives. Examples of activities that may one may not be motivated to do alone but could be done with others for social benefit are things such as throwing and catching a baseball with a friend, making funny faces with children, building a treehouse, and performing a debate.|$|E

2500|$|Sociocultural theory (see Cultural-historical psychology) (also {{known as}} <b>Social</b> <b>Motivation)</b> {{emphasizes}} impact of activity and actions mediated through social interaction, and within social contexts. Sociocultural theory represents {{a shift from}} traditional theories of motivation, which view the individual’s innate drives or mechanistic operand learning as primary determinants of motivation. [...] Critical elements to socio-cultural theory applied to motivation include, {{but are not limited}} to, the role of social interactions and the contributions from culturally-based knowledge and practice. [...] Sociocultural theory extends the social aspects of Cognitive Evaluation Theory, which espouses the important role of positive feedback from others during action, but requires the individual as the internal locus of causality. [...] Sociocultural theory predicts that motivation has an external locus of causality, and is socially distributed among the social group.|$|E

The {{purpose of this study is}} to understand how <b>social</b> <b>motivations</b> (that is, network externalities and social norms) affect members committed to OCs. This study tests the hypotheses on data collected from 396 undergraduate students. Data analyses show that network externalities and social norms directly influence social interaction ties, which subsequently results in commitment toward a community. Social norms also directly influence relationship commitments to a community. The results provide insights into how <b>social</b> <b>motivations</b> lead to commitment to an OC, reminding OC administrators to encourage member commitment to the OC from the perspective of <b>social</b> <b>motivations.</b> (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The study also examines the effects of materialism on teenagers' <b>social</b> consumption <b>motivations</b> and attitudes toward luxury brands. The total sample consisted of 558 teenagers between the ages of 12 and 19 (grades 7 through 12). Hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling. This study demonstrates that materialistic orientation is a powerful force in developing positive attitudes toward luxury brands.

50|$|In {{the third}} chapter, Shirky {{explains}} that the means are platforms, tools, or systems we use {{that allow us to}} connect, learn, and share. The combination of time, place, and people which enable us to share and take action, is the opportunity. Shirky discusses the types of motivations that a person who shares would consider. Intrinsic motivations, which Shirky summarizes as a need for 1) increased competence, 2) autonomy over what we do, 3) membership of a group who share our values and beliefs, 4) the sharing of things with that group. Then, extrinsic motivations, like reward and recognition or punishment for certain behaviors. These motivations could also be classified into personal and <b>social</b> <b>motivations.</b> <b>Social</b> <b>motivations</b> include membership and sharing, while personal motivations include competence and autonomy. With the evidence from Benkler and Nissenbaum, it is concluded that <b>social</b> <b>motivations</b> reinforce personal ones. With the tools of today, we see many new groups; most of them large, public, and amateur groups. The goal for these groups is more about scope rather than size. The use of this public access media is to reach audiences that are like the group. Sharers have always had the same interests-or motivations- it is the opportunity that has changed them, and the ability to connect, share, and learn easily.|$|R

50|$|Extrinsic motivations {{are broken}} down into three categories: {{immediate}} payoffs, delayed payoffs, and <b>social</b> <b>motivations.</b> Immediate payoffs, through monetary payment, are the immediately received compensations given to those who complete tasks. Delayed payoffs are benefits {{that can be used}} to generate future advantages, such as training skills and being noticed by potential employers. <b>Social</b> <b>motivations</b> are the rewards of behaving pro-socially, such as the altruistic motivations of online volunteers. Chandler and Kapelner found that US users of the Amazon Mechanical Turk were more likely to complete a task when told they were going to “help researchers identify tumor cells,” than when they were not told the purpose of their task. However, of those who completed the task, quality of output did not depend on the framing of the task.|$|R

40|$|A {{combination}} of calculated, normative, and <b>social</b> <b>motivations</b> {{as well as}} awareness of rules and capacity to comply are thought to foster compliance with regulations. Hypotheses about these factors were tested with data concerning Danish farmers' compliance with agro-environmental regulations. Three key findings emerge: that farmers' awareness of rules plays a critical role; that normative and <b>social</b> <b>motivations</b> are as influential as calculated motivations in enhancing compliance; and that inspectors' enforcement style affects compliance differently from that posited {{in much of the}} literature. It was also found that formalism in inspection can be helpful to a point, while coercion by inspectors can backfire. Taken together, these findings counter arguments concerning the harm of legalism and the benefits of flexible enforcement. This study contributes to the understanding of factors that shape compliance with social and environmental regulations. © 2001 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management. ...|$|R

50|$|Another form of <b>social</b> <b>motivation</b> is {{prestige}} or status. The International Children's Digital Library recruits {{volunteers to}} translate and review books. Because all translators receive public acknowledgment for their contributions, Kaufman and Schulz cite {{this as a}} reputation-based strategy to motivate individuals {{who want to be}} associated with institutions that have prestige. The Mechanical Turk uses reputation as a motivator in a different sense, as a form of quality control. Crowdworkers who frequently complete tasks in ways judged to be inadequate can be denied access to future tasks, providing motivation to produce high-quality work.|$|E

50|$|With these {{demonstrated}} {{connections between}} social communication skills and prospective memory, several hypotheses have arisen concerning what {{specific aspects of}} diminished social skills are influencing prospective memory impairment. Prospective memory relies heavily upon social motivation—like {{the desire to be}} socially included, insight and perception into other people’s emotions, and the ability to read social cues. Individuals with ASD are largely tuned out to these types of <b>social</b> <b>motivation,</b> which then affects their prospective memory. Difficulty reflecting upon one’s own mental state and the mental state of others, self-awareness and self-monitoring deficiencies likely also play a role in impaired prospective memory.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of habitual social approach and avoidance motivation on the classification of facial expressions of different visual clarity. Participants (N = 78) categorized partially masked emotional faces expressing either anger or happiness as positive or negative. Participants generally tended to interpret the facial expressions in a positive way. This positivity effect was reduced when persons were highly avoidance motivated. <b>Social</b> avoidance <b>motivation</b> predicted fewer positive and more negative interpretations in the least visible condition that provided extremely little information on the facial expression. Thus, people high in <b>social</b> avoidance <b>motivation</b> {{are likely to have}} anticipated angry faces as the facial stimuli offered only minimal information. The results for <b>social</b> approach <b>motivation</b> did not reach statistical significance. To conclude, it seems that persons who are most afraid of having negative social interactions (i. e., those high in <b>social</b> avoidance <b>motivation),</b> anticipate and interpret social information in the most negative way, which could lead to the reinforcement of the avoidance motivation...|$|R
