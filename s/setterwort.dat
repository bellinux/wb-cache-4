5000|$|Hellebores {{are widely}} grown in USDA Zone 5a to 8b gardens for {{decorative}} purposes. They are particularly valued by gardeners for their winter and early spring flowering period; {{the plants are}} surprisingly frost-resistant and many are evergreen. [...] Also of value is their shade tolerance. Many species of hellebore have green or greenish-purple flowers and are of limited garden value, although Corsican hellebore (H. argutifolius), a robust plant with pale green, cup-shaped flowers and attractive leathery foliage, is widely grown. So is the 'stinking hellebore' or <b>setterwort</b> (H. foetidus), which has drooping clusters of small, pale green, bell-shaped flowers, often edged with maroon, which contrasts with its dark evergreen foliage. H. foetidus 'Wester Flisk', with red-flushed flowers and flower stalks, is becoming popular, as are more recent selections with golden-yellow foliage.|$|E
