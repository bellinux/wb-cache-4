40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) In this thesis, a novel optical {{design for}} an afocal <b>scan</b> <b>engine</b> {{based on two}} 90 ° {{off-axis}} parabolic optical elements acting as reflective relay optics between two deflecting mirrors is proposed. The characteristics of this <b>scan</b> <b>engine</b> such as linearity of scan lines, spot sizes, spot intensity profiles, field curvature, and temporal distortion across the scan field have been investigated. The new <b>scan</b> <b>engine</b> was also evaluated as an afocal relay, with scan optics and for optical zoom performance. The engine was modelled and investigated using OSLO, commercial optical software. Its performance was evaluated and compared to known scan engines with results showing superior linearity of scan lines and intensity distribution across the scan field. The advantage of using it with a fast resonant scan mirror is highlighted. The new <b>scan</b> <b>engine</b> prototype and known scan engines were assembled in the laboratory and their performance was evaluated and compared in order to verify the OSLO prediction. The experimentally measured results {{were found to be}} in agreement with the OSLO predicted results. A physical explanation for the difference in results has been provided. Using OSLO optical software, a study of temporal distortion across the scan field was then conducted. The calculated results predict that the use of the new <b>scan</b> <b>engine</b> in two-photon microscopy may result in improved contrast in two-photon images across the scan field. The new two-photon excitation correction factor for reflective scan engines was introduced and its evaluation confirmed that the new engine is the best choice for fast scanning two-photon microscopy (TPM) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{scanning}} laser {{display technology}} {{is one of}} the most promising technologies for highly integrated projection display applications (e. g. in PDAs, mobile phones or head mounted displays) due to its advantages regarding image quality, miniaturization level and low cost potential. As a couple of research teams found during their investigations on laser scanning projections systems, the image quality of such systems is - beside from laser source and video signal processing - crucially determined by the <b>scan</b> <b>engine,</b> including MEMS scanner, driving electronics, scanning regime and synchronization. Even though a number of technical parameters can be measured with high accuracy, the test procedure is challenging because the influence of these parameters on image quality is often insufficiently understood. Thus, in many cases it is not clear how to define limiting values for characteristic parameters. In this paper the relationship between parameters characterizing the <b>scan</b> <b>engine</b> and their influence on image quality will be discussed. Those include scanner topography, geometry of the path of light as well as trajectory parameters. Understanding this enables a new methodology for testing and characterization of the <b>scan</b> <b>engine,</b> based on evaluation of one or a series of projected test images. Due to the fact that the evaluation process can be easily automated by digital image processing this methodology has the potential to become integrated into the production process of laser displays...|$|E

The new architecture consists of a parallel finite-input memory machine (PFIMM) and general purpose MPUs. It uses two-stage matching. That is, in the first stage, the parallel hard-ware filter quickly scans the text to find partial matches, and in the second stage, the MPU scan the text to find the total match. To reduce the memory size, compressed match vec-tors are used. The system is implemented on the Stratix III FPGA, where 65, 536 ClamAV virus patterns are stored. As for the area-performance ratio, our system is 1. 2 - 26. 3 times more efficient than existing ones. ...|$|R
