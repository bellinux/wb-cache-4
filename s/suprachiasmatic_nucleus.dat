5|$|The {{hypothalamus}} in the diencephalon, {{is involved}} in regulating many functions of the body. Functions include neuroendocrine regulation, regulation of the circadian rhythm, control of the autonomic nervous system, and the regulation of fluid, and food intake. The circadian rhythm is controlled by two main cell groups in the hypothalamus. The anterior hypothalamus includes the <b>suprachiasmatic</b> <b>nucleus</b> and the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus which through gene expression cycles, generates a roughly 24 hour circadian clock. In the circadian day an ultradian rhythm takes control of the sleeping pattern. Sleep is an essential requirement for the body and brain and allows the closing down and resting of the body's systems. There are also findings that suggest that the daily build-up of toxins in the brain are removed during sleep. Whilst awake the brain consumes {{a fifth of the}} body’s total energy needs. Sleep necessarily reduces this use and gives time for the restoration of energy-giving ATP. The effects of sleep deprivation show the absolute need for sleep.|$|E

Within the <b>suprachiasmatic</b> <b>nuclei,</b> prominent 24 h rhythms under 12 : 12 light-dark cycles were found for vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) and for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Peaks of both VIP and TH fell in the light phase of the cycle. Rhythmic expression of TH persisted under constant temperature and darkness, demonstrating the existence of circadian rhythms of TH in the <b>suprachiasmatic</b> <b>nuclei.</b> No rhythmic expression of neurotransmitters and related compounds {{was found in the}} periventricular nuclei, the supraoptic nuclei, {{and the rest of the}} hypothalamus. Our data are the first demonstration of rhythmic expression of neurotransmitters and related compounds in the <b>suprachiasmatic</b> <b>nuclei</b> of a non-mammalian vertebrate.

25|$|Sleep timing depends greatly on {{hormonal}} {{signals from}} the circadian clock, or Process C, a complex neurochemical system which uses signals from an organism's environment to recreate an internal day–night rhythm. Process C counteracts the homeostatic drive for sleep during the day (in diurnal animals) and augments it at night. The <b>suprachiasmatic</b> <b>nucleus</b> (SCN), a brain area directly above the optic chiasm, is presently considered the most important nexus for this process; however, secondary clock systems have been found throughout the body.|$|E
25|$|Chronoception {{refers to}} how {{the passage of time}} is {{perceived}} and experienced. Although the sense of time is not associated with a specific sensory system, the work of psychologists and neuroscientists indicates that human brains do have a system governing the perception of time, composed of a highly distributed system involving the cerebral cortex, cerebellum and basal ganglia. One particular component, the <b>suprachiasmatic</b> <b>nucleus,</b> is responsible for the circadian (or daily) rhythm, while other cell clusters appear to be capable of shorter-range (ultradian) timekeeping.|$|E
25|$|In humans {{there are}} two subtypes of {{melatonin}} receptors targeted by melatonin agonists, MT1 and MT2. They are G protein-coupled receptors and are expressed in various tissues of the body, together or singly. MT1 receptors are expressed in many regions of {{the central nervous system}} (CNS): <b>suprachiasmatic</b> <b>nucleus</b> (SCN) of the hypothalamus, hippocampus, substantia nigra, cerebellum, central dopaminergic pathways, ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens. MT1 is also expressed in the retina, ovary, testis, mammary gland, coronary circulation and aorta, gallbladder, liver, kidney, skin and the immune system. MT2 receptors are expressed mainly in the CNS, also in the lung, cardiac, coronary and aortic tissue, myometrium and granulosa cells, immune cells, duodenum and adipocytes.|$|E
40|$|In the Syrian hamster a serotonergic (5 -HTergic) {{stimulation}} during daytime acts on the circadian {{timing system}} by inducing behavioral phase advances and by decreasing Per 1 and Per 2 (Period) mRNA {{levels in the}} <b>suprachiasmatic</b> <b>nuclei,</b> containing the main circadian clock in mammals.

Both light exposure and systemic administration of melatonin prior to the injection of a 5 -HT(1 A/ 7) receptor agonist, 8 -OH-DPAT, {{in the middle of the}} day blocked behavioral phase advances. In contrast, neither light nor melatonin treatment during daytime prevented serotonergic-induced down-regulation of Per 1 and/or Per 2 mRNA levels in the <b>suprachiasmatic</b> <b>nuclei.</b> Taken together, the results show that interactions between afferent cues to the <b>suprachiasmatic</b> <b>nuclei</b> differentially modulate phase adjustment and clock gene expression during daytime...|$|R

25|$|Sleep is {{regulated}} by two parallel mechanisms, homeostatic regulation and circadian regulation, {{controlled by the}} hypothalamus and the <b>suprachiasmatic</b> <b>nucleus</b> (SCN), respectively. Although {{the exact nature of}} sleep drive is unknown, homeostatic pressure builds up during wakefulness and this continues until the person goes to sleep. Adenosine is thought to {{play a critical role in}} this and many people have proposed that the pressure build-up is partially due to adenosine accumulation. However, some researchers have shown that accumulation alone does not explain this phenomenon completely. The circadian rhythm is a 24-hour cycle in the body, which has been shown to continue even in the absence of environmental cues. This is caused by projections from the SCN to the brain stem.|$|E
25|$|Nocturnal {{animals have}} higher body temperatures, greater activity, rising serotonin, and {{diminishing}} cortisol during the night—the inverse of diurnal animals. Nocturnal and diurnal animals both have increased electrical {{activity in the}} <b>suprachiasmatic</b> <b>nucleus,</b> and corresponding secretion of melatonin from the pineal gland, at night. Nocturnal mammals, which tend to stay awake at night, have higher melatonin at night just like diurnal mammals do. And, although removing the pineal gland in many animals abolishes melatonin rhythms, it does not stop circadian rhythms altogether—though it may alter them and weaken their responsiveness to light cues. Cortisol levels in diurnal animals typically rise throughout the night, peak in the awakening hours, and diminish during the day. In diurnal animals, sleepiness increases during the night.|$|E
500|$|A key {{component}} of the arousal system is the <b>suprachiasmatic</b> <b>nucleus</b> (SCN), a tiny part of the hypothalamus located directly above {{the point at which}} the optic nerves from the two eyes cross. The SCN contains the body's central biological clock. Neurons there show activity levels that rise and fall with a period of about 24 hours, circadian rhythms: these activity fluctuations are driven by rhythmic changes in expression of a set of [...] "clock genes". The SCN continues to keep time even if it is excised from the brain and placed in a dish of warm nutrient solution, but it ordinarily receives input from the optic nerves, through the retinohypothalamic tract (RHT), that allows daily light-dark cycles to calibrate the clock.|$|E

2500|$|Swaab first {{reported}} {{on the relationship between}} sexual orientation in males and the hypothalamus's [...] "clock", the [...] <b>suprachiasmatic</b> <b>nucleus</b> (SCN). In 1990, Swaab and Hofman reported that the <b>suprachiasmatic</b> <b>nucleus</b> in homosexual men was significantly larger than in heterosexual men. Then in 1995, Swaab et al. linked brain development to sexual orientation by treating male rats both pre- and postnatally with ATD, an aromatase blocker in the brain. This produced an enlarged SCN and bisexual behavior in the adult male rats. In 1991, LeVay showed that part of the sexually dimorphic nucleus (SDN) known as the 3rd interstitial nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus (INAH 3), is nearly twice as large (in terms of volume) in heterosexual men than in homosexual men and heterosexual women.|$|E
2500|$|There is {{evidence}} of a correlation between sexual orientation and traits that are determined in utero. [...] A study by McFadden in 1998 found that auditory systems in the brain, another physical trait influenced by prenatal hormones is different in those of differing orientations; likewise the <b>suprachiasmatic</b> <b>nucleus</b> was found by Swaab and Hofman to be larger in homosexual men than in heterosexual men. The <b>suprachiasmatic</b> <b>nucleus</b> is also known to be larger in men than in women. An analysis of the hypothalamus by Swaab and Hofmann (1990;2007) found that {{the volume of the}} <b>suprachiasmatic</b> <b>nucleus</b> (SCN) in homosexual men was 1.7 times larger than a reference group of male subjects, and contained 2.1 times as many cells. During development, the volume of the SCN and the cell counts reach peak value at approximately 13 to 16 months after birth; at this age, the SCN contains the same number of cells as was found in adult male homosexuals, yet in a reference group of heterosexual males the cell numbers begin to decline to the adult value of 35% of the peak value. [...] These results have yet to be replicated, however; there also has yet to be a meaningful interpretation of these results provided in the context of human sexual orientation. Gay men have also been shown to have higher levels of circulating androgens and larger penises, on average, than heterosexual men.|$|E

5000|$|The retinohypothalamic tract (RHT) is a photic neural input pathway {{involved}} in the circadian rhythms of mammals.

The axons of the ipRGCs belonging to the retinohypothalamic tract project directly, monosynaptically, to the <b>suprachiasmatic</b> <b>nuclei</b> (SCN) via the optic nerve and the optic chiasm.

For these studies, we monitored firing rate rhythms of individual <b>suprachiasmatic</b> <b>nuclei</b> neurons on fixed multielectrode plates and exploited the altered circadian periods expressed by heterozygous and homozygous tau mutant hamsters. The results show that circadian period in the whole animal is determined by averaging widely dispersed periods of individual clock cells.

2500|$|The primary {{function}} of the pineal gland is to produce melatonin. [...] Melatonin has various functions in the central nervous system, {{the most important of}} which is to help modulate sleep patterns. Melatonin production is stimulated by darkness and inhibited by light. Light sensitive nerve cells in the retina detect light and send this signal to the <b>suprachiasmatic</b> <b>nucleus</b> (SCN), synchronizing the SCN to the day-night cycle. Nerve fibers then relay the daylight information from the SCN to the paraventricular nuclei (PVN), then to the spinal cord and via the sympathetic system to superior cervical ganglia (SCG), and from there into the pineal gland.|$|E
2500|$|The Casein kinase 1 epsilon {{protein is}} part of the {{mammalian}} oscillator, a group of proteins that keep cells on a roughly 24-hour schedule. This oscillator, or [...] "circadian clock," [...] is made up of a transcription-translation negative feedback loop (TTNFL) in which several proteins work in tandem, each regulating the others' expression to generate a roughly 24-hour cycle of both mRNA and protein levels. The TTFNL also generates roughly 24-hour rhythms of outputs such as levels of cellular hormone release. Daily oscillations in protein and mRNA transcription have been observed in many cells, including the mammalian master clock known as the <b>suprachiasmatic</b> <b>nucleus</b> (SCN). However, unlike most circadian rhythm proteins, casein kinase 1 epsilon is constitutively active.|$|E
2500|$|These {{findings}} {{only partially}} corroborate LeVay's hypothesis that homosexual males have a [...] "female-like hypothalamus" [...] — {{given that the}} INAH3 was smaller in homosexual men, intermediate in size between that of heterosexual males and heterosexual females.

These areas of the hypothalamus have not yet been explored in homosexual females nor bisexual males nor females. In sum, some contemporaries cast serious doubt over LeVay's hypothesis that homosexual males have a [...] "female hypothalamus" [...] and that the key mechanism of differentiating the [...] "male brain from originally female brain" [...] is the epigenetic influence of testosterone during prenatal development.|$|E
