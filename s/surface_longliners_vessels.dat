40|$|Fisheries {{by-catch}} {{is considered}} to be a major threat to loggerhead turtles in the Mediterranean Sea. Technical differences in both gear configurations (e. g. hook and bait type) and fisheries operations carried out by the Spanish Mediterranean surface longline fleet could have an effect on by-catch rates and size selectivity. The aim of the present study was to test the differences in by-catch per unit effort and body size of loggerhead sea turtles caught using different gear types in the Mediterranean surface longline fishery. Our results suggest that differences in the gear type used have an effect on catch rates and size selec- tivity. Thus, <b>surface</b> <b>longliners</b> targeting albacore (LLALB) using smaller hooks tend to capture smaller loggerheads but have the highest by-catch per unit of effort (BPUE), whereas other longlines, such as <b>surface</b> <b>longliners</b> targeting bluefin tuna (LLJAP) and traditional <b>surface</b> <b>longliners</b> targeting swordfish (LLHB), using larger hooks tend to select the larger animals; moreover, LLHB had the lowest BPUE. Disproportionate rates of fisheries-induced mortality on certain size/age- classes can differentially affect sea turtle populations, as each sea turtle age-class contributes differently to current and future reproduction. Thus, fisheries management should not only be focusing on preserving the large juvenile and mature turtles, but also on reducing the total by-catch. Thus, we recommend encouraging the use of LLHB versus other surface gears. We suggest that it is very important to take into account the gear type (and its particular catch rates) when making inferences about the impact of longline fisheries on sea turtle populations.

The aim {{of this study is to}} analyze the parameters affecting to the bycatch of {{pelagic stingray}} by the Spanish surface drifting longline fleet that operates in the Mediterranean Sea. Since the year 2000 until the year 2013, 3007 longline fishing operations were monitored. In these 14 years, we recorded 57, 574 pelagic stingrays by-catches by Spanish longline. Two gear types concentrate 96. 05 % of pelagic stingray by-catch observed: traditional <b>surface</b> <b>longliners</b> targeting swordfish (LLHB) and <b>surface</b> drifting <b>longliners</b> targeting albacore (LLALB). We obtained two statistically significant explicative models for the gears LLHB and LLALB. In both cases, fisheries over continental shelf and summer variables are important parameters. Furthermore, for the LLHB explicative model included the variables: number of hooks, latitude where the setting started, Distance between both extremes of the longline and spring.

40|$|During a {{total of}} 20 sets carried out on board a <b>surface</b> <b>longliner,</b> the {{different}} degrees of effectiveness obtained in the capture of swordfish were evaluated using 5 different bait types (natural, artificial and mixed). The results point to substantial and {{significant differences in the}} CPUEs obtained among the different bait types tested to catch swordfish. However, the results show few mean differences that were not statistically significant between the CPUEs obtained using natural bait (control) or mixed bait consisting of artificial bait on the outside-which in itself was of null effectiveness- into which was inserted a piece of natural bait, concealed from view. Both types of bait (control and mixed) were effective in the capture of swordfish despite the differences in constitution and properties. On the basis of these results, it is possible to make an indirect assessment of the importance of visual and odor stimuli in the swordfish to detect and carry out the final attack on its prey. Odor was found to be the key element in this process.

40|$|This project {{provided}} an exceptional opportunity to describe diving behaviour, movements and to characterise critical habitats of blue sharks in the North-eastern Atlantic using satellite and archival telemetry.   Tracked blue sharks displayed southward movements {{away from the}} tagging areas, exhibiting pronounced site fidelity to localised high-productivity frontal regions.   Blue sharks also displayed {{a high degree of}} variability in vertical movements. Shifts in diving behaviour were detected both within and between individuals, whereas behavioural phases were linked to the thermal structure of the water column in coastal areas, and to changes in prey distribution or type in offshore regions.   High resolution data showed that blue sharks shift between Brownian (in productive habitats) and Lévy (less productive waters) behaviours.   Vertical movements ranged from the surface to 1160 m, and water temperatures varied between 7. 2 - 27. 2 °C.   Behavioural data was also crucial in determining the degree of spatial and temporal overlap, and thus vulnerability, between blue sharks and high-seas longliners.   Confirmed fishing mortality was ~ 11 % with four tagged sharks caught by <b>surface</b> <b>longliners.</b>   Simulations showed that boats/sharks overlap was higher in winter and early spring, with the majority of simulated sharks (~ 88 %) at risk at least one day year- 1.   Our results indicate that, depending on which geographical regions are occupied at specific times, different segments of the blue shark population face differential risk from longlines.   Sequencing of mitochondrial DNA suggested an absence of spatial genetic differentiation throughout the North Atlantic, providing strong evidence that blue sharks comprise a single population in this region.

40|$|Personal {{floatation}} devices (PFDs) {{save lives}} in the fishing industry. Most work-related fatalities in the fishing industry are caused by drowning after a vessel disaster or a fall overboard. Although the risk of drowning is high, most deckhands do not wear PFDs while working on the deck. There are currently no mandates by regulatory agencies for these workers to wear PFDs. Past research conducted by NIOSH examined the predictors of PFD use in the fishing industry in Alaska. Workers who believed that PFDs are an entanglement hazard had low PFD use, as did workers who believed that PFDs interfere with work. Workers may wear PFDs more often if they are familiar with newer models that have features which alleviate their concerns regarding comfort. The NIOSH Alaska Pacific Office conducted a study to determine which type of commercially available PFD resulted in the highest satisfaction in actual fishing industry working conditions. Different vessels have unique on-deck work processes, thus four vessel types were targeted: crabbers (vessels dropping baited pots to catch crab {{on the ocean floor}}), <b>longliners</b> (<b>vessels</b> anchoring strings of baited hooks on the ocean floor to catch a variety of bottom fish), gillnetters (vessels towing gillnets to catch primarily salmon), and trawlers (vessels towing large trawl nets to catch groundfish and pelagic fish). Six PFD models were selected to provide a variety of features to test for comfort and functionality. The study revealed that workers on different types of fishing vessels had varying preferences for PFDs. Because no regulations mandating the use of PFDs exist, manufacturers may have more success in supplying PFDs if they engage workers in the design and promotion of newer, more comfortable PFDs. Impact Based on the results of the NIOSH PFD study, a national PFD manufacturer realized there was a need for innovative PFD designs to improve comfort for workers in the fishing industry. They extended the NIOSH study and took a variety of commercially available PFDs to test on several boats where crewmembers gave feedback on the mobility of each PFD. Based on their market research, the company developed a prototype designed to be worn under bibs and raingear with 12 lbs. of flotation, the optimal amount to maintain a low profile while still maintaining buoyancy. This new vest could be worn continuously, even when going ashore, but would still allow buoyancy in case of a fall overboard. This prototype was field-tested for continuous wear and a number of adjustments were made based on fishermen's feedback, including shortening the overall height of the vest and adding indentations on the sides for flexibility when sitting and stepping up, increasing the diameter of the armholes to increase range of motion, lowering the neck to aid in looking downward, and adding reflective loops where gear could be secured to replace pockets that would catch on equipment. Their final product is now commercially available. Has logo for the Research to Practice at NIOSH initiative (r 2 p). NIOSHTIC No. 2004537...|$|R
40|$|To {{improve the}} {{effectiveness}} of tori-lines {{it is necessary to}} evaluate the ability of tori-lines to mitigate seabird bycatch and determine what kind of seabird species gather during line settings, attack the bait and are incidentally caught. We conducted two experiments in the western North Pacific and examined the effectiveness for seabird mitigation of light streamer tori-lines which have no long streamers but many light (short) streamers and are mainly used in the North Pacific area. Firstly, {{the effectiveness of}} two different types of tori-line (light streamer (1 m) and long streamer (up to 7 m) tori-line) and of two different colors (yellow and red) of light streamers for seabird bycatch avoidance was evaluated using 567 sets based on data from 20 offshore <b>surface</b> commercial <b>longliners.</b> No significant difference in the bycatch number between the different tori-line types and streamer colors was found. Secondly, we investigated the characteristics of the seabird bycatch in the North Pacific and the effectiveness of three different types of streamers (light, hybrid and modified light types) by detailed observations of seabird attacks using a chartered longline vessel. Although the appearance rate of albatrosses and shearwaters were 40. 9 % and 27. 7 %, Laysan albatross was the main seabird species that followed the vessel but shearwater...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the level and {{distribution}} of fishing mortality in a multigear fishery, {{and its effect on}} biological and economic parameters. The Greenland halibut stock in ICES Sub-areas I and Il is at a historically low level. Due to a lack of recruitment observed for this stock, and in order to have an increase in the spawning stock, a cessation of fishing has been advised. Since 1992 trawlers, and gillnet <b>vessels</b> and <b>longliners</b> larger than 90 feet have not been allowed to fish Greenland halibut as target species, but only as bycatch when fishing for other species. Gillnet <b>vessels</b> and <b>longliners</b> smaller than 90 feet have been allowed to participate in a directed fishery for Greenland halibut within a limited quota, a limited area and a limited period each year. This paper {{focuses on the}} economic yield one can expect from the Greenland halibut stock in ICES Sub-areas I and Il when gear specific selective properties are taken into consideration. The biological data were collected during a 1992 - 1994 research programme using trawlers, <b>longliners</b> and gillnet <b>vessels</b> in a limited commercial fishery in the same geographical area, i. e., the historical most important fishing area. Quantitative effects of the three gears' different selectivity have been judged out from yield and spawning biomass per recruit (age 3). The profitability analysis of the different gears is based on prices and value of the catch and cost analysis of the fishery the last year of no catch-regulation (1991). Finally, the biological and economic analysis have been combined and evaluated together. The results may be used as guidelines for the management of the stock...|$|R
