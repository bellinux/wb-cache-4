40|$|Rationale: The {{diffusing}} capacity (DL) of {{the lung}} {{can be divided}} into two components: the diffusing capacity of the alveolar membrane (Dm) and the pulmonary capillary volume (Vc). DL is traditionally measured using a <b>single-breath</b> <b>method,</b> involving inhalation of carbon monoxide, and a breath hold of 8 – 10 seconds (DL,CO). This method does not easily allow calculation of Dm and Vc. An alternative <b>single-breath</b> <b>method</b> (DL,CO,NO), involving simultaneous inhalation of carbon monoxide and nitric oxide, and traditionally a shorter breath hold, allows calculation of Dm and Vc and the DL,NO/DL,CO ratio in a single respiratory maneuver. The clinical utility of Dm, Vc, and DL,NO/DL,CO in the pediatric age range is currently unknown but also restricted by lack of reference values.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Henoch–Schönlein purpura (HSP) is a {{widespread}} necrotizing vasculitis affecting small vessels characterized by nonthrombocytopenic purpura. Pulmonary involvement is a rare fatal complication with diffuse alveolar haemorrhage. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate possible early lung function abnormalities and to establish any relationship with the clinical activity of the disease. Fifteen children with HSP and without clinical or radiological evidence of lung involvement underwent pulmonary function study at the onset of the disease. A sample of 28 subjects matched by age, height, and weight was chosen as a control group. After a mean of 21 months (range 12 – 43) lung function tests were repeated in 10 of the previously studied children. During the acute phase of the disease the transfer factor for carbon monoxide, measured by steady-state (TL,COss) and <b>single-breath</b> (TL,COsb) <b>methods,</b> was found to be significantly lower in children with HSP than control subjects.

40|$|Total {{respiratory}} resistance (Rrs) {{was measured}} in six anesthetized dogs with two different methods: the <b>single-breath</b> (SB) <b>method,</b> which provides the time constant of the system during a relaxed expiration and the forced oscillation (FO) method, which uses a pseudorandom noise signal applied at the airway opening. The comparison was made in three conditions: before muscle paralysis (A), after muscle paralysis (B), and after tracheal banding (C). In conditions A and B the two computed resistances correlated very well with each other (r = 0. 98). No systematic difference between Rrs values obtained with the two methods was found. In condition C the respiratory resistance was clearly nonlinear from the flow-volume curves during SB and could be described with Rohrer's equation: Rrs = K 1 X V + K 2 X V 2, where K 1 and K 2 are Kohrer's constant and V is flow. Rrs measured with FO was not frequency dependent during tracheal banding (C) and was virtually equivalent to K 1. Since the FO method uses low flows as the input of the respiratory system and K 1 could be ascribed to laminar flow, the numerical matching appears reasonable and tends to reinforce the validity of both methods of measurement. We conclude that, for the normal respiratory system, FO and SB methods are approximately equivalent. In {{the presence of a}} markedly alinear central airway resistance with normal lungs, the SB method appears to provide a more adequate description of the flow-resistive properties of the system. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackgroundAmong {{patients}} with chronic unexplained cough, there is a recognized subgroup with respiratory symptoms induced by environmental irritants like chemicals and odours. The diagnosis of sensory hyperreactivity (SHR) has been suggested for this group of patients and can be made using a tidal breathing capsaicin inhalation test. The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the ability of a single-breath, dose-response capsaicin threshold test to discriminate such patients from control subjects. MethodsA total of 46 {{patients with}} chronic cough and SHR who had previously shown a positive reaction in accordance with limits set for a tidal breathing capsaicin test were tested once with a single-breath, dose-response capsaicin cough threshold test, assessing capsaicin concentrations to evoke 2 (C 2), 5 (C 5) or 10 (C 10) coughs. Twenty-nine subjectively healthy control subjects were also included and tested with the threshold method. ResultsPatients had significantly lower C 2, C 5 and C 10 in comparison to controls. From the results among patients and controls, sensitivity and specificity were calculated, and a receiver operating characteristic curve was constructed, showing excellent ability for C 5 and C 10 to discriminate patients from control subjects. ConclusionsFor patients with SHR and chronic cough, capsaicin cough sensitivity was once again confirmed to be increased, in this case, using the <b>single-breath</b> dose-response <b>method.</b> Limits set for cough reactions regarded as more sensitive than normal can be useful in diagnostics and further research.

40|$|JP- 8 {{jet fuel}} (similar to commercial/international jet A- 1 fuel) is the {{standard}} military fuel {{for all types of}} vehicles, including the U. S. Air Force aircraft inventory. As such, JP- 8 presents the most common chemical exposure in the Air Force, particularly for flight and ground crew personnel during preflight operations and for maintenance personnel performing routine tasks. Personal exposure at an Air Force base occurs through occupational exposure for personnel involved with fuel and aircraft handling and/or through incidental exposure, primarily through inhalation of ambient fuel vapors. Because JP- 8 is less volatile than its predecessor fuel (JP- 4), contact with liquid fuel on skin and clothing may result in prolonged exposure. The slowly evaporating JP- 8 fuel tends to linger on exposed personnel during their interaction with their previously unexposed colleagues. To begin to assess the relative exposures, we made ambient air measurements and used recently developed methods for collecting exhaled breath in special containers. We then analyzed for certain volatile marker compounds for JP- 8, as well as for some aromatic hydrocarbons (especially benzene) that are related to long-term health risks. Ambient samples were collected by using compact, battery-operated, personal whole-air samplers that have recently been developed as commercial products; breath samples were collected using our <b>single-breath</b> canister <b>method</b> that uses 1 -L canisters fitted with valves and small disposable breathing tubes.

40|$|AbstractThe <b>single-breath</b> (SB) <b>method</b> for {{determining}} the transfer factor for carbon monoxide (TlCO) is of limited value {{for the detection of}} diffusion disorders on the alveolar level, because the results are influenced by unequal distribution of ventilation and diffusion. The rebreathing method (RB) is thought not to be influenced by these inequalities. To the authors' knowledge, no study has measured both TlCORB and TlCOSB systematically and compared them with regard to the influence of unequal ventilation and diffusion. Therefore, the present study measured total lung capacity (TLC) as well as TlCO, both with the RB vital capacity method and the SB method, using the same apparatus in 10 healthy subjects and in 35 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). These patients are known to have increased unequal ventilation and diffusion in comparison with healthy subjects. In the healthy subjects, a small difference was found between TLC measured with the RB method (TLCRB) divided by the predicted value (TLCRB/pred) and TLCSB/pred (mean difference 0 · 07; se= 0 · 02); no significant difference was found between TlCORB divided by the predicted value of TlCOSB (TlCORB/pred) and TlCOSB/pred. In the COPD patients, however, TLCRB/pred was larger than TLCSB/pred (mean difference 0 · 17; se= 0 · 02) and TlCORB/pred was larger than TlCOSB/pred (mean difference 0 · 23; se= 0 · 05). Multiple regression analysis revealed that in the COPD patients, 54 % of the variance of the difference between TLCRB/pred and TLCSB/pred, and 76 % of the variance of the difference between TlCORB/pred and TlCOSB/pred, were explained by parameters related to unequal ventilation and diffusion. In 25 of the 35 COPD patients, TlCOSB/pred was less than 0 · 8, whereas in of these 25 patients, TlCORB/pred was more than 0 · 8. This difference was significant (P= 0 · 0005). In these 11 patients, the SB measurement resulted in the incorrect diagnosis of a diffusion disorder on the alveolar level. The RB method, however, never resulted in the diagnosis of a diffusion disorder when TlCOSB/pred was larger than 0 · 8. It is concluded that in a significant number of COPD patients, TlCOSB is below the normal range, whereas TlCORB is not below the normal range. This difference between TlCORB and TlCOSB is related to the combined effect of unequal ventilation and diffusion, and is of clinical importance for the detection of a diffusion disorder on the alveolar level...|$|R

The study population was recruited from an epidemiological study with subjects of the same age, 60 years. Only smokers who considered themselves healthy (n= 58) and a random sample of never-smokers (n= 34) were investigated. All subjects underwent lung function tests—spirometry, carbon monoxide transfer (DL co) and the <b>single-breath</b> N 2 <b>method</b> (N 2 test) —together with high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT). A flexible bronchoscopy with a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed in 30 smokers and 18 never-smokers. Bronchial biopsies were also taken. Smokers who reported non-specific respiratory problems, chronic bronchitis and wheezing in a symptom questionnaire had a lower forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV 1), FEV% and specific airway conductance (sGaw), lung function tests supposed to reflect the more central airways, than smokers without respiratory symptoms. A limited number of smokers with occasional non-specific respiratory problems also had more cytotoxic T cells (CD 8) in bronchial biopsies. No differences were found in DL co and the N 2 test, lung function tests supposed to reflect the more peripheral airways including the alveoli, HRCT-diagnosed emphysema or inflammatory markers in blood and BAL between smokers with and without respiratory symptoms. It is concluded that even when smokers consider themselves ‘healthy’ they have mild symptoms that are related more to physiological changes and inflammatory markers that may reflect events in the central airways than to changes that may reflect events in the peripheral airways...|$|R
40|$|It is {{increasingly}} recognised that asthma and cystic fibrosis (CF) frequently involves the peripheral airways. Characteristic features of abnormal peripheral airway function are uneven ventilation distribution and increased gas trapping. The overall {{purpose of the}} work presented in this thesis was to set up methods based on washout of inert gases, {{and use them to}} assess peripheral airway engagement in infants, children and adults with asthma or CF. An SF 6 multiple-breath washout (MBW) technique and a modified SF 6 and He <b>single-breath</b> washout (SBW) <b>method</b> were used to study peripheral airway involvement in asthma and CF. The feasibility of measuring trapped gas using the MBW technique in conjunction with passive lung inflations in infants was investigated. The volume of trapped gas in infants with CF and controls was assessed by comparing functional residual capacity as measured by MBW and by plethysmography. Subjects with CF and controls underwent MBW and the SF 6 /He SBW test, and new analytical approaches to analysis were used to determine contributions to ventilation inhomogeneity from the conductive and the intra-acinar airways. Adults with a history of asthma and hyperreactive asthmatic children were studied using SF 6 /He SBW tests at rest, after challenge and again after bronchodilator therapy to investigate involvement of airways in the acinar region. Both gas trapping and uneven ventilation distribution could be measured with good precision in infants using the MBW in combination with plethysmography or with the MBW technique only. Infants with CF had significant gas trapping when compared to control infants, who, contrary to previous findings, did not have significant amounts of trapped gas. Asthmatic children and adults who reacted with marked airway obstruction to airway challenge showed increased overall ventilation inhomogeneity, and findings suggested that airways as far peripherally as close to the acinar entrance participated in this overall airway response. In addition, there was evidence that structural or functional peripheral airway abnormalities at rest are important determinants of the severity of the response to challenge. Patients with CF had marked inhomogeneity of overall ventilation distribution as measured by the MBW and SBW tests. Abnormal ventilation distribution was found in both the conductive and the intra-acinar airways, and there was evidence that abnormalities extended at least into the proximal portion of the acinus. Summary and conclusion: Peripheral airway involvement can be assessed in a patient-friendly manner in infants, children and adults with airway disease using the MBW. New analytical approaches to analysis of the MBW and the SBW in subjects with CF and asthma demonstrate that both conditions commonly involve the peripheral airways, {{at least as far as}} the proximal portion of the acinus. Peripheral airway involvement is generally more pronounced in children with CF than in those with asthma and appears to be related to clinical disease severity. The methods described may prove valuable when evaluating treatments targeted at the peripheral airways...|$|R

40|$|Lung {{diffusing}} capacity {{has been}} reported variably in high-altitude newcomers and may be in relation to different pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). Twenty-two healthy volunteers were investigated at sea level and at 5, 050 m before and after random double-blind intake of the endothelin A receptor blocker sitaxsentan (100 mg/day) vs. a placebo during 1 wk. PVR was estimated by Doppler echocardiography, and exercise capacity by maximal oxygen uptake (Vo(2 max)). The diffusing capacities for nitric oxide (DL(NO)) and carbon monoxide (DL(CO)) were measured using a <b>single-breath</b> <b>method</b> before and 30 min after maximal exercise. The membrane component of DL(CO) (Dm) and capillary volume (Vc) was calculated with corrections for hemoglobin, alveolar volume, and barometric pressure. Altitude exposure was associated with unchanged DL(CO), DL(NO), and Dm but a slight decrease in Vc. Exercise at altitude decreased DL(NO) and Dm. Sitaxsentan intake improved Vo(2 max) together {{with an increase in}} resting and postexercise DL(NO) and Dm. Sitaxsentan-induced decrease in PVR was inversely correlated to DL(NO). Both DL(CO) and DL(NO) were correlated to Vo(2 max) at sea level (r = 0. 41 - 0. 42, P < 0. 1) and more so at altitude (r = 0. 56 - 0. 59, P < 0. 05). Pharmacological pulmonary vasodilation improves the membrane component of lung diffusion in high-altitude newcomers, which may contribute to exercise capacity. Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{set out a}} {{severity}} classification for idiopathic {{pulmonary fibrosis}} (IPF) based on the interaction of pulmonary function parameters with high resolution computed tomography (CT) findings. INTRODUCTION: Despite the contribution of functional and radiological methods {{in the study of}} IPF, there are few classification proposals for the disease based on these examinations. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out, in which 41 non-smoking patients with IPF were evaluated. The following high resolution CT findings were quantified using a semi-quantitative scoring system: reticular abnormality, honeycombing and ground-glass opacity. The functional variables were measured by spirometry, forced oscillation technique, helium dilution method, as well as the <b>single-breath</b> <b>method</b> of diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide. With the interaction between functional indexes and high resolution CT scores through fuzzy logic, a classification for IPF has been built. RESULTS: Out of 41 patients studied, 26 were male and 15 female, {{with a mean age of}} 70. 8 years. Volume measurements were the variables which showed the best interaction with the disease extension on high resolution CT, while the forced vital capacity showed the lowest estimative errors in comparison to total lung capacity. A classification for IPF was suggested based on the 95 % confidence interval of the forced vital capacity %: mild group (> 92. 7); moderately mild (76. 9 - 92. 6); moderate (64. 3 - 76. 8 %); moderately severe (47. 1 - 64. 2); severe (24. 3 - 47. 0); and very severe (< 24. 3).

40|$|Background. In type 11 {{diabetes}} mellitus {{there are few}} data concerning pulmonary function abnormalities. In normal subjects and in patients with primary Raynaud phenomenon, cold pressor test induces a decrease in carbon monoxide single-breath diffusing capacity (DL,co) but not in secondary Raynaud phenomenon. Our objective was to assess evaluation of lung diffusion capacity postural changes in {{diabetes mellitus}} and in secondary Raynaud phenomenon, two diseases with different pulmonary capillaries functional disorders. Methods. Twenty-five patients with type 11 diabetes mellitus (mean age 52. 24 years), 17 patients with secondary Raynaud phenomenon (mean age 47. 06 years), non-smokers without pulmonary or heart disease, and 26 healthy matched subjects (mean age 47. 50 years) underwent lung diffusion capacity measurements by <b>single-breath</b> <b>method</b> also corrected by alveolar volume (DL,co) in sitting and supine positions. Results. Patients with diabetes mellitus exhibited lower values of DL,co and DL,co/VA measurements in comparison with subjects with Raynaud phenomenon and control group (p < 0. 01). Additionally, they had {{a significant decrease in}} DL,co in supine compared to sitting position (83. 88 +/- 16. 53 vs. 89. 68 +/- 18. 03, p = 0. 023). To the contrary, supine position in secondary Raynaud phenomenon and in control group after cold pressor test showed a significant increase in DL,co/VA (120. 93 vs. 109. 78 in Raynaud and 114. 36 vs. 99. 47 in control group, p < 0. 001).

40|$|Objectives: To {{assess the}} nature of {{pulmonary}} dysfunction in type 1 diabetes {{and the relationship of}} pulmonary function tests to diabetic factors and complication. Subjects and Methods: Sixteen type 1 diabetic patients and 26 control subjects matched for age and sex were studied. We performed spirometry measurements and measured pulmonary diffusing capacity (DLCO) in sitting and supine position by the <b>single-breath</b> <b>method</b> corrected by alveolar volume (VA). Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA(lc)), retinopathy and microalbuminuria were included as parameters of metabolic control and diabetic complications. Results: Diabetic patients showed a significant reduction of the following pulmonary function tests (% predicted value) as compared with control subjects: total lung capacity (TLC, 92. 6 +/- 14. 5 vs. 113. 9 +/- 17. 5, p < 0. 001), lung diffusing capacity in sitting position (DLCO, 90. 4 +/- 21. 1 vs. 107. 7 +/- 15. 6, p = 0. 004), lung diffusing capacity in supine position (DLCO, 88. 3 +/- 19. 3 vs. 111. 9 +/- 19. 9, p = 0. 001). The differences in diffusing capacity corrected by alveolar volume in sitting and supine position (DLCO/VA) were not significant. By changing the posture from sitting to supine position both diabetic patients and control subjects significantly increased DLCO/VA (103. 4 +/- 17. 7 vs. 112. 7 +/- 22. 3, p = 0. 046 and 99. 5 +/- 13. 4 vs. 114. 4 +/- 13, p < 0. 001, respectively). There was no correlation between pulmonary function tests and diabetic complications. Conclusion: These data indicate that type 1 diabetic patients showed reduced TLC and DLCO, features of pulmonary restrictive dysfunction. There was no correlation between abnormal pulmonary function and the presence of other diabetic complications. Copyright (C) 2003 S. Karger AG, Basel...|$|E
40|$|Background: Lung {{function}} in diabetes {{has been reported}} in several studies with contradictory results. Diabetes mellitus increases expression of adhesion molecules through hyperglycemia. These molecules {{play an important role in}} the pathophysiological dysfunction of the vasculature. Objective: To explore the possible relationship between lung function and circulating levels of adhesion molecules in diabetes. Methods: Sixteen type 1 diabetic patients, 33 type 2 diabetic patients and 22 healthy subjects matched for age and sex were studied. Spirometry measurements were performed and pulmonary diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLco) was measured in sitting and supine positions by the <b>single-breath</b> <b>method</b> corrected by alveolar volume (VA). Glycosylated hemoglobin, retinopathy and nephropathy were included as parameters of metabolic control and diabetic complications. Circulating levels of soluble E-selectin and vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1 (VCAM- 1) were determined in all subjects. Results: Diabetic subjects showed lower variation in DLco and DLco/VA by changing posture from sitting to supine position (P= 0. 043 and P< 0. 001, respectively), and showed reduced total lung capacity (P< 0. 001) and forced expiratory volume in 1 s/forced vital capacity (P= 0. 009) compared with healthy control subjects. Serum concentrations of E-selectin were elevated in diabetic patients (P< 0. 001). There was no difference in serum VCAM- 1 concentrations between diabetic and control subjects. On stepwise regression analysis, E-selectin concentrations were the most important contributing factor to the variation in DLco/VA. Conclusions: Diabetic patients show lower pulmonary volumes and variation in DLco by changing posture from sitting to supine position, and they also show increased levels of E-selectin. A possible explanation is impaired pulmonary microvasculature, because adhesion molecules seem to be sensitive markers of endothelial activation and damage seen in diabetes...|$|E
40|$|Background Cardiopulmonary {{exercise}} testing (CPET) with {{blood gas analysis}} may be helpful {{when there is a}} discrepancy between clinical findings and physiologic tests at rest. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the added value of CPET compared to the measurement of the diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) in detecting impaired pulmonary gas exchange in sarcoidosis patients. Methods The clinical records of 160 (age = 41. 3 ± 10. 0 years; number of females = 63) sarcoidosis patients referred to the former MUMC ild care center were retrospectively reviewed. Patients performed a symptom-limited incremental exercise test with blood gas analysis on a bicycle ergometer. DLCO was measured by the <b>single-breath</b> <b>method.</b> Results DLCO (mean = 83. 2 ± 18. 0 %) below 80 % of predicted was demonstrated by 38 % of the sarcoidosis patients in our sample. Of the patients with normal DLCO (n = 99, 61. 9 %), the P(A-a) O 2 at maximal exercise [P(A-a) O 2 max] was moderately increased (> 2. 5 kPa) in 69. 7 % and excessively increased (> 4. 7 kPa) in 18. 2 %. Pulmonary gas exchange impairment (PGEI) was more obvious in patients with lower DLCO values. A DLCO value below 60 % of predicted indicated substantial gas exchange impairment. PaO 2 at rest, DLCO, and FVC as a percentage of predicted and radiographic staging predicted 40 % of the PGEI at maximal exercise. Conclusion A substantial number of the symptomatic sarcoidosis patients with normal DLCO appeared to have PGEI at maximal exercise, suggesting that normal DLCO at rest is an inappropriate predictor of abnormal pulmonary gas exchange during exercise. CPET appeared to offer added value in detecting impaired gas exchange during exercise in sarcoidosis patients with unexplained disabling symptoms.

The external respiratory function (ERF) examination is widely {{used to assess the}} functional capacity of the lungs. Objective. To evaluate ERF in patients with RA. Material and methods. The study included 155 patients with RA. A MasterScreen Body plethysmograph (Erich Jaeger) was used to determine the ERF parameters (diffusing lung capacity, DLC; forced inspiratory vital capacity, FIVC; forced expiratory volume in 1 second, FEV 1; total lung capacity, TLC; the FEV 1 /FIVC ratio, and the modified Tiffeneau index). DLC was measured by the <b>single-breath</b> <b>method.</b> ERF parameters were represented {{as a percentage of the}} appropriate value for a given gender, age, and height of the patient. Results. Of the 155 examined patients with RA, a decrease in the DLC parameter was detected in 107 (69 %), while in 87 (81 %) patients, the decrease was less than 10 % of the proper values. An analysis of the state of the ERF parameters revealed a decrease in FEV 1 in 48 (31 %) patients, FIVC in 41 (27 %) patients, and TLC in 36 (23 %) patients. The restrictive type of lung ventilation was determined in 27 % of patients, bronchial obstruction in 31 % of patients, an iso- lated decrease in DLC in 12 % of patients with RA. In 31 % of cases, no deviations of the ERF parameters from normal values were found. A statistically significant negative correlation between the clinical activity of RA and the DLC level (r = - 0. 59; p< 0. 05) was found. Conclusion. The study revealed a high frequency of variation in the ERF parameters in patients with RA. In most cases, the variation was demonstrated by DLC. The obstructive changes were prevalent among RA patients. The high percentage of smokers among RA patients with the obstructive type of ventilation may indicate the influence of smok- ing on the development of bronchial obstruction. Our work revealed the significant relationship between the degree of RA activity and the DLC value. </div...|$|E
40|$|Nitric oxide in {{exhaled air}} {{is thought to}} reflect airway inflammation. No data have been {{reported}} so far on circadian changes in NO in subjects with nocturnal asthma. To determine whether exhaled NO shows a circadian rhythm inverse to the circadian rhythm in airway obstruction in subjects with nocturnal asthma, we conducted a study involving six healthy controls, eight individuals without nocturnal asthma (4 -h to 16 -h variation in peak expiratory flow [PEF] {{less than or equal}} to 15 %), and six individuals with nocturnal asthma (4 -h to 16 -h PEF variation > 15 %). Smoking, use of corticosteroids, and recent respiratory infections were excluded. NO concentrations were measured at 12, 16, 20, and 24 h, and at 4, 8, and 12 h of the next day, using the <b>single-breath</b> <b>method.</b> At the same times, FEV 1 and PEF were also measured. Mean NO concentrations were significantly higher in subjects with nocturnal asthma than in subjects without nocturnal asthma, and higher in both groups than in healthy controls at all time points. Mean exhaled NO levels over 24 h correlated with the 4 -h to 16 -h variation in PEF (r = 0. 61, p < 0. 01). Exhaled NO did not show a significant circadian variation in any of the three groups as assessed with cosinor analysis, in contrast to the FEV 1 in both asthma groups (p < 0. 05). At 4 h, mean +/- SD NO levels were higher than at 16 h in subjects with nocturnal asthma; at 50 +/- 20 ppb versus 42 +/- 15 ppb (p < 0. 05); other measurements at all time points were similar. Differences in NO and FEV 1 from 4 h to 16 h did not correlate with one another. We conclude that subjects with nocturnal asthma exhale NO at higher levels both at night and during the day, which may reflect more severe diurnal airway-wall inflammation. A circadian rhythm in exhaled NO was not observed. NO levels did not correspond to the circadian rhythm in airway obstruction. The small increase in NO at 4 h may indicate an aspect of inflammation, but it is not associated with increased nocturnal airway obstruction...|$|E
40|$|Background: Asthma is a {{heterogeneous}} disease. Diagnosis relies on symptom evaluation and lung function tests using spirometry. Symptoms can be vague. Spirometry is effort-dependent {{and does not}} reliably evaluate small airways. Allergic asthma in preschool children is not easily separated from episodic wheeze. Exhaled NO (FeNO) is a marker of allergic Th 2 -cytokine-driven airway inflammation. However, FeNO is not feasible in preschoolers with current devices and algorithms. Alveolar NO is an estimate of small airway involvement. Forced oscillometry (FOT) is an effort-independent lung function test assessing {{both large and small}} airways. Aims: To study clinical and methodological aspects of FeNO, alveolar NO and lung function indices by FOT. Methods: Asthmatic children and young adults and healthy controls, were included in the studies. FeNO at 50 mL/s was performed in all studies (in study III with an adapted <b>single-breath</b> <b>method</b> with age-adjusted exhalation times). FeNO at multiple exhalation flow rates were performed in studies I, II and IV to calculate alveolar NO, as was spirometry. FOT indices were assessed in study IV. Results: The exhalation time needed to reach steady-state NO was < 4 s in subjects aged 3 - 4 years, and was related to subject height. FeNO was higher in ICS-naïve asthmatic children than in controls. ICS-naïve asthmatic preschool children had FeNO < 20 ppb. The oral contribution to FeNO was similar in asthmatic and healthy youths. Multiple flow rates and modelling of alveolar NO were feasible in children aged 10 - 18 years. Alveolar NO correlated to asthma characteristics, though not when axial diffusion correction was applied. FOT resistance measures were associated with asthma diagnosis, and small airway FOT measures were associated with asthma control, in adolescents. Conclusion: An adapted FeNO method is feasible from 4 years, and exhalation time is related to child height. Our findings emphasise the need to refine clinical cut-offs for FeNO in younger children. FOT variables discriminate between asthmatics and controls, much like spirometry. The information provided by FOT is additive to that from spirometry. Further studies of exhaled NO dynamics and FOT indices of small airways are warranted to evaluate new treatment options and possibly improve asthma control...|$|E
40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVES: The {{interpretation}} of nonspecific bronchial provocation dose-response curves in COPD {{is still a}} matter of debate. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) in patients with COPD could {{be influenced by the}} destruction of the parenchyma and the augmented mechanical behavior of the lung. Therefore, we studied the interrelationships between indexes of BHR, on the one hand, and markers of lung parenchymal destruction, on the other. PATIENTS AND METHODS: COPD patients were selected by clinical symptoms, evidence of chronic, nonreversible airways obstruction, and BHR, which was defined as a provocative dose of a substance (histamine) causing a 20 % fall in FEV(1) (PC(20)) of </= 8 mg/mL. BHR was subsequently studied by methacholine dose-response curves to which a sigmoid model was fitted for the estimation of plateau values and reactivity. Model fits of quasi-static lung pressure-volume (PV) curves yielded static lung compliance (Cstat), the exponential factor (KE) and elastic recoil at 90 % of total lung capacity (P 90 TLC). Carbon monoxide (CO) transfer was measured with the standard <b>single-breath</b> <b>method.</b> RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were included in the study, and reliable PV data could be obtained from 19. The following mean values (+/- SD) were taken: FEV(1), 65 +/- 12 % of predicted; reversibility, 5. 6 +/- 3. 1 % of predicted; the PC(20) for methacholine, 4. 3 +/- 5. 2 mg/mL; reactivity, 11. 0 +/- 5. 6 % FEV(1) /doubling dose; plateau, 48. 8 +/- 17. 4 % FEV(1); transfer factor, 76. 7 +/- 17. 9 % of predicted; transfer coefficient for carbon monoxide (KCO), 85. 9 +/- 22. 6 % of predicted; Cstat, 4. 28 +/- 2. 8 kPa; shape factor (KE), 1. 9 +/- 1. 5 kPa; and P 90 TLC, 1. 1 +/- 0. 8 kPa. We confirmed earlier reported relationships between Cstat, on the one hand, and KE (p < 0. 0001), P 90 TLC (p = 0. 0012), and KCO percent predicted (p = 0. 006), on the other hand. The indexes of the methacholine provocation test were not related to any parameter of lung elasticity and CO transfer. CONCLUSION: BHR in COPD patients who smoke most probably is determined by airways pathology rather than by the augmented mechanical behavior caused by lung parenchymal destruction...|$|E
40|$|Nitric oxide (NO) is {{produced}} at various locations within the respiratory tract and {{is present in}} exhaled breath. It is firmly established that the levels of NO in exhaled air are increased in inflammatory disorders such as asthma and breath testing is now being introduced as a new diagnostic tool in clinical practice. Serious inflammatory conditions, both pulmonary and systemic, are common in critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation {{in the intensive care}} unit and NO measurements might be of value also in this setting. However, data on exhaled NO in this context have been scarce, likely because of methodological difficulties. In this project we have developed methods for studying exhaled NO in anesthetized mechanically ventilated patients with endotracheal intubation. We first used these methods to further characterize the anatomical origin of exhaled NO and then to study the possible release of NO in exhaled air upon administration of vasoactive agents known to interfere with endogenous NO generation. For comparison, measurements of exhaled NO were also performed in conscious subjects using a highly standardized and established <b>single-breath</b> <b>method.</b> By studying exhaled NO in patients with endotracheal intubation under general anesthesia as well as conscious subjects with or without a permanent tracheostomy we could confirm that the upper airways contribute substantially to both exhaled and inhaled NO. With a negative pressure aspiration system we could fractionate exhaled NO into alveolar and airway sources in patients with intubated trachea. This method enables more sophisticated analysis of exhaled NO in the anesthetized patient, which in turn increases the likelihood of finding useful clinical applications for NO measurements in this setting. A pig model was used to study if endogenous NO release evoked by vasoactive agents could be detected in exhaled air. We found that a variety of endothelium-dependent (e. g. acetylcholine, bradykinin, and endothelin- 1) and endothelium-independent (e. g. nitroglycerin) vasoactive substances induced reproducible and agent-specific increases in exhaled NO. This NO likely originates from the pulmonary vascular endothelium in the alveolar region. In the last part of the thesis we went on to study responses in exhaled NO upon administration of acetylcholine and nitroglycerin in humans. Patients undergoing open-heart surgery were studied before and after cardiopulmonary bypass, a condition associated with transient pulmonary endothelial dysfunction. Acetylcholine elicited a dose-dependent increase in exhaled NO which was unaffected after cardiopulmonary bypass, while basal exhaled NO levels and the response to nitroglycerin were decreased. In conclusion: We have developed methods to measure exhaled NO in mechanically ventilated patients, and investigated the contribution of NO from different parts of the respiratory tract. These methods can be used to evaluate exhaled NO as a disease marker in critically ill patients and also to study online the effects of pharmaceutical agents on endogenous NO release...|$|E
