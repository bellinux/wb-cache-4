40|$|This report {{details the}} design and {{manufacture}} of modifications to a low cost vacuum chamber intended for railgun operations. These modifications intend to increase the functionality of the chamber and enable the modeling of high velocity impacts in a space. The original vacuum chamber was constructed primarily from polyvinyl chloride to meet the low cost design constraints, which limits pressures obtainable to the low vacuum region (760 Torr to 2 Torr). Modifications include construction of a space-saving storage rack, replacement of external door supports, installation of an internal guide rail, and installation of electrical feedthroughs.

2500|$|A {{variant of}} the TK-1 for the CH-34/UH-34 helicopter, the TK-2 (Temporary Kit-2) was {{developed}} by the USMC for their UH-1E helicopter. The system provides the same four M60C 7.62×51mm machine guns as the TK-1, but adds two independent <b>support</b> <b>rack</b> and pylon assemblies to the system, for mounting an acceptable aircraft style armament. Typically these mounts were used for 7-Tube 2.75" [...] rocket launchers of varying types, but were also seen tested with XM18/M18 Minigun pods (USAF SUU-11/A).|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the preliminary electrical and mechanical {{design of the}} Atlas machine`s 1. 8 megajoule, 600 kV Marx modules. The modules are implemented with plastic cased capacitors similar to those developed for the Defense Nuclear Agency (DNA) ACE II and ACE IV machines. The double ended electrode capacitor style has been dubbed ``FASTCAP. `` Electrodes are provided for mounting rail-gaps {{on one side and}} flat plate transmission line damping resistors on the other. This provides for an extremely low circuit inductance. A series array of ten capacitors, each rated at 60 kV, 33. 5 uF, and 60 kJ, with their five triggered rail-gaps, form a Marx submodule. Three Marx submodules are nested into a large G- 10 fiberglass rack to form a complete Marx module. The module <b>support</b> <b>rack</b> has individual capacitor shelves that ease assembly and replacement. The Marx`s design also facilitates construction, testing and verification of a modules performance prior to installation. Modules will be repaired or maintained in a separate test bay without affecting machine operation schedules.

50|$|Lightweight stands are not {{designed}} to support heavy books of music such as full-size fake books; while the fake book may stay open on the stand, the music stand may fall over. Folding stands consist of a rack for the music and a telescoping cylindrical column for <b>supporting</b> the <b>rack,</b> with screws or other fastening devices to secure the extended columns at the desired height. Folding stands typically have a foldable tripod that supports the column and the music shelf. The rack area for holding the music is either pre-set at a slight incline away from the performer (as compared with being straight up), so that a song book or étude book will lie open naturally, or the degree of incline can be adjusted by the performer (on more expensive stands).|$|R
