5|$|Although {{many people}} believe this owl has {{exceptional}} night vision, its retina is no more <b>sensitive</b> <b>than</b> a human's and its asymmetrically placed ears are key to its hunting by giving it excellent directional hearing.

5|$|The 24-inch Burrell Schmidt Telescope was {{originally}} built in 1939 by Warner & Swasey Company of Cleveland, Ohio and was housed at the Taylor Road facility. It is currently housed at Kitt Peak National Observatory near Tucson, Arizona. The telescope recently had its optics upgraded {{with a very}} wide field of view CCD array, {{which is much more}} <b>sensitive</b> <b>than</b> the photographic plates. It is the instrument used today by the Case astronomers.|$|E
5|$|The {{antimicrobial}} {{action of}} iodine is quick and works at low concentrations, {{and thus it}} is used in operating theatres. Its specific mode of action is unknown. It penetrates into microorganisms and attacks particular amino acids (such as cysteine and methionine), nucleotides, and fatty acids, ultimately resulting in cell death. It also has an antiviral action, but nonlipid viruses and parvoviruses are less <b>sensitive</b> <b>than</b> lipid enveloped viruses. Iodine probably attacks surface proteins of enveloped viruses, and it may also destabilise membrane fatty acids by reacting with unsaturated carbon bonds.|$|E
5|$|The mission {{added two}} new {{instruments}} to Hubble. The first instrument, the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph, {{is now the}} most sensitive ultraviolet spectrograph installed on the telescope. Its far-UV channel is 30 times more <b>sensitive</b> <b>than</b> previous instruments and the near-UV is twice as sensitive. The second instrument, the Wide Field Camera 3, is a panchromatic wide-field camera that can record {{a wide range of}} wavelengths, including infrared, visible, and ultraviolet light. Atlantis also carried the Soft-Capture Mechanism, which was installed onto the telescope.|$|E

5|$|The {{modality}} {{of choice}} is computed tomography (CT scan) without contrast, of the brain. This has a high sensitivity and will correctly identify over 95 percent of cases—especially {{on the first day}} after the onset of bleeding. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be more <b>sensitive</b> <b>than</b> CT after several days. Within six hours of the onset of symptoms CT picks up 98.7% of cases.|$|E
5|$|Ultrasound is {{commonly}} used {{in the evaluation of}} people who have sustained physical trauma, for example with the FAST protocol. Ultrasound may be more <b>sensitive</b> <b>than</b> chest X-rays in the identification of pneumothorax after blunt trauma to the chest. Ultrasound may also provide a rapid diagnosis in other emergency situations, and allow the quantification {{of the size of the}} pneumothorax. Several particular features on ultrasonography of the chest can be used to confirm or exclude the diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Bigfin reef squids and {{the common}} octopus (Octopus vulgaris) were studied to resolve a century-long debate over whether {{cephalopods}} can hear. Unlike fishes, cephalopods do not possess air-filled swim bladders, which might amplify sound waves travelling in water. The results were published in 2009. It showed that bigfin reef squids and octopuses utilise their statocysts for detecting vibrations, an organ primarily used for maintaining spatial orientation. The common octopus can hear sounds between 400Hz and 1000Hz. Bigfin reef squids have a slightly better hearing range of 400Hz to 1500Hz. Both hear best at a frequency of 600Hz. Relatively, their hearing is comparable to prawns and some other invertebrates but is less <b>sensitive</b> <b>than</b> that of most fishes.|$|E

5|$|The Mantoux {{tuberculin}} {{skin test}} {{is often used}} to screen people at high risk for TB. Those who have been previously immunized may have a false-positive test result. The test may be falsely negative in those with sarcoidosis, Hodgkin's lymphoma, malnutrition, and most notably, active tuberculosis. Interferon gamma release assays, on a blood sample, are recommended in those who are positive to the Mantoux test. These are not affected by immunization or most environmental mycobacteria, so they generate fewer false-positive results. However, they are affected by M. szulgai, M. marinum, and M. kansasii. IGRAs may increase sensitivity when used in addition to the skin test, but may be less <b>sensitive</b> <b>than</b> the skin test when used alone.|$|E
5|$|The World Health Organization {{has defined}} {{pneumonia}} in children clinically based on either a cough or difficulty breathing and a rapid respiratory rate, chest indrawing, or a decreased level of consciousness. A rapid respiratory rate {{is defined as}} greater than 60 breaths per minute in children under 2 months old, greater than 50 breaths per minute in children 2 months to 1 year old, or greater than 40 breaths per minute in children 1 to 5 years old. In children, low oxygen levels and lower chest indrawing are more <b>sensitive</b> <b>than</b> hearing chest crackles with a stethoscope or increased respiratory rate. Grunting and nasal flaring may be other useful signs in children {{less than five years}} old.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} {{manifestations of}} Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome are controlled in different ways. The fibrofolliculomas {{can be removed}} surgically, through curettage, shave excision, skin resurfacing, or laser ablation; however, {{this is not a}} permanent solution as the tumors often recur. The renal and pulmonary symptoms are managed preventatively: CT scans, ultrasounds, or MRIs of the kidneys are recommended regularly, and family members are advised not to smoke. MRIs are the preferred method for surveillance of the kidneys in people with BHD because they do not carry the same risk of radiation complications as CT scans and are more <b>sensitive</b> <b>than</b> ultrasounds. Smokers with Birt–Hogg–Dubé have more severe pulmonary symptoms than non-smokers. Though nephrectomy is sometimes indicated, kidney tumors in cases of Birt–Hogg–Dubé are often removed without taking the whole kidney, in a procedure called partial nephrectomy. Knockout mouse studies have shown that administration of rapamycin may mitigate the effects of FLCN mutations on kidneys and improve renal cancer prognoses because of folliculin's interaction with the mTOR pathway.|$|E
