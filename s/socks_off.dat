500|$|On 9 November 2013, Chamakh {{was given}} a {{standing}} ovation by the home fans at Selhurst Park whilst being substituted, despite not scoring, impressing with his work rate and attitude against Everton. On 3 December 2013, Chamakh scored in a 1–0 win against West Ham from a cross by Barry Bannan, his first goal in 11 matches. He continued his good form with a well-hit low volley in a 2–0 home win over Cardiff City. On 14 December 2013, he scored his third goal in three matches against Chelsea in a 2–1 away loss; he received a standing ovation for [...] "working his <b>socks</b> <b>off</b> literally" [...] when replaced on the 88th minute.|$|E
500|$|The new {{script was}} then pitched to the BBC. The pitch tape they made {{was based on}} the same pitch used by The Muppet Show. This was done as a tribute to it, with Miller arguing that when The Muppet Show did it, [...] "it just must have just knocked the <b>socks</b> <b>off</b> the people who saw it, because it's like nothing you've ever seen before, and we thought: 'Why fix what ain't broke, so we did our own very British version of that." [...] The {{producers}} liked it but did not fully understand what the show was about. Miller, Brown and a third writer, Daniel Peak began to write scripts over a period of four years. A pilot was eventually filmed and the BBC commissioned a full series, targeted at adults. Despite the adult nature, Miller did not want to make the show too crude. Eight episodes were filmed so as to spread the cost of making the series over each episode.|$|E

5000|$|She began {{recovering}} {{well before}} septicaemia left her {{unable to walk}} for five weeks. Webley-Smith said of the time, [...] "My ankle {{was the size of}} a football. I remember the doctor trying to take my <b>sock</b> <b>off</b> and I was screaming. I was taking what they call an 'elephant dose' of antibiotics and the strongest painkillers they could give me". She returned full-time to the circuit in August 2006.|$|R
2500|$|Molting occurs {{periodically}} {{throughout the}} snake's life. Before a molt, the snake stops eating and often hides or {{moves to a}} safe place. Just before shedding, the skin becomes dull and dry looking and the eyes become cloudy or blue-colored. The inner surface of the old skin liquefies. This causes the old skin to separate from the new skin beneath it. After a few days, the eyes clear and the snake [...] "crawls" [...] out of its old skin. The old skin breaks near the mouth and the snake wriggles out, aided by rubbing against rough surfaces. In many cases, the cast skin peels backward over the body from head to tail in one piece, like pulling a <b>sock</b> <b>off</b> inside-out. A new, larger, brighter layer of skin has formed underneath.|$|R
500|$|Critics {{variously}} {{described his}} writing as [...] "forthright," [...] "chatty", and [...] "charming". In a review in The Globe and Mail Brian Brett admires [...] "Suzuki's disarming candour" [...] and labels it [...] "a strange, fascinating book". While Brett's review is positive, {{he calls it}} [...] "clunkily written" [...] and sometimes repetitive. The Edmonton Journal review notes that Suzuki could [...] "charm the <b>socks</b> <b>off</b> the most hardened soul", but {{that many of his}} stories fall flat. The review in the Quill & Quire notes Suzuki [...] "has not written an indulgent autobiography" [...] and that he [...] "is too polite to dish on his enemies". Writing for The Vancouver Sun, Robert Wiersema states that while [...] "his life is an open book... ou get the sense of meeting the real Suzuki for the first time." [...] Wiersema calls him [...] "a natural storyteller". The New Zealand Listener review states, [...] "as a writer, he has the charm of a high-school geek desperately trying to get a date... but ultimately it's what allows his story to convince". Several critics find Suzuki's writing on death to be particularly well-done.|$|E
500|$|Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode an 'A', saying [...] "Community is going {{away for a}} while, but it's going away with an episode that reminds me why I love the show so much. This is a very {{personal}} thing—since humor's subjective like that—but for me, this was the funniest episode since the clip show... I laughed myself silly at this one, {{to the point where}} I was devolving into hiccups at certain scenes, and I'm glad we get to go out on an episode like this, one that plays around with form and makes me laugh." [...] Alan Sepinwall of HitFix also praised the Glee-spoofing, saying [...] "'Regional Holiday Music' was the logical, clever, funny endpoint to it." [...] Sean Gandert of Paste said, [...] "As with its best theme-episodes, the show bridged the gap between high-concept parody and character-based comedy." [...] TV Fanatic's Leigh Raines gave the episode a 4/5 rating, saying while the show [...] "definitely went out with a bang, it didn't totally blow my <b>socks</b> <b>off...</b> While there were a few moments that upped the ick factor, overall this episode fell on the positive side." [...] She praised Troy and Abed's rap performance, but called the scene where Annie seduces Jeff [...] "creepy". Robert Canning of IGN said it was a [...] "great" [...] episode, but [...] "faltered just a bit" [...] at the end: [...] "Abed's realization that his attempts to brighten the holiday only made things darker, as Jeff had previously suggested, fit the character well enough, but the study group's follow-up felt a bit forced and holiday hokey. Of course, that could well have been the point." ...|$|E

5000|$|Until the 1940s, Charlie had {{measured}} clients' feet without socks on them, but the Texas legislature intervened. As Charlie {{recounted in}} the late 1970s, [...] "Now you can't take your <b>sock</b> <b>off</b> in my presence. The podiatrists got nervous about the bootmakers taking their business away, so about 30 years ago they passed a law in the Texas legislature that said you got to keep your socks on in here. They were just afraid of the boot-making profession. I called their hand on that one. I let 'em know that if I had no more faith in my trade than they had in theirs, I'd go out and dig ditches. I recommended they do the same." [...] Ever the one to point out nonsense, Charlie persevered to overcome this obstacle.|$|R

2500|$|He was as solicitous of {{the welfare}} of men as of animals. [...] On a number of {{occasions}} he gave away woolen socks to those who were in need, sometimes giving away a new knitted pair, sometimes taking the <b>socks</b> <b>off</b> his own feet. [...] Once on a cold day riding the trail, he met a stranger with no coat and gave away his own. [...] He even once gave away his horse to replace an animal that had died pulling a heavily loaded covered wagon.

2500|$|The {{fourth day}} of the {{competition}} had started earlier with another withdrawal, as fifth seed and 2007 Masters Cup semifinalist Andy Roddick announced he was {{pulling out of the}} event, after injuring his ankle during a practice session on the previous day. [...] "Yesterday in the warm-up during practice I just went over on it. [...] We tried the best we could to get it better but I can't really stop and start on it very quickly." [...] commented Roddick. The American's withdrawal allowed 26th-ranked Radek Štěpánek, who accepted the invitation to Shanghai as first alternate, after sixteen players ranked above him, and below last qualifier Gilles Simon, refused to come to the Masters Cup. Roddick said he had called Štěpánek, before deciding not to play, to tell him he might enter the competition : [...] "I called Štěpánek earlier today to let him know where my head was at, and then just told him when I came off the practice court. So he knew as early as anybody else." [...] Štěpánek's unexpected appearance (Murray had commented [...] "Štěpánek's turned up without his own racquets, he borrowed some <b>socks</b> <b>off</b> me earlier and he hasn't got his contact lenses either") marked the Czech's first career participation to the year-end championships.|$|E

[...] "I started recording four days ago with the band members from Booker T and the MGs. And in the four days, we cut 15 tracks. It's been such a great experience to watch these guys work. [...] I would show them which song I wanted to record. After listening to any changes I had, we would all go into the live room. Everyone would hop to their instruments I'd hop in the vocal booth. We would just hit record button without a rehearsal and everyone would nail it nearly every time." [...] Cropper later spoke on AllMemphisMusic about working with Sebastian. [...] "Needless to say I've done {{a lot of things in}} my career, had a lot of fun, but we had more fun working with this young guy who just sings the rings around everything. [...] this kid came into Memphis, and just blew everybody's <b>socks</b> <b>off.</b> He had the grit and the grime and the soul of Otis Redding, and he had the sweet soul of Al Green, he had the wonderful sweet church sound of Sam Cooke, and he just took us by storm." ...|$|E

What with Darren’s cheeky escapades and Nancy’s no-messing attitude, they’ll make the perfect parents". She added that if Nancy is [...] "as organised at being a mum as she is at being a journalist, then they will cope brilliantly! We’re hoping the writers will leave them to be a happy for once and let Nancy have a stress-free pregnancy, but we don’t fancy their chances". Crick's colleague Laura Morgan commented on Nancy going into premature labour saying [...] "Our hearts were breaking for the couple as they faced the reality of their situation [...] we’re keeping our fingers crossed there will be a happy ending to their nightmare". Morgan added that [...] "Despite the sad nature of the storyline, it’s been amazing (as always) to watch Jess Fox (aka Nancy) and Ashley Taylor Dawson (Darren) acting their <b>socks</b> <b>off,</b> and proving to us once again they’re two of the best actors in soap right now".|$|E
2500|$|Uncertainty {{was cast}} on the plans by the 2008 death of Anne d'Harnoncourt, but new {{director}} Timothy Rub, who had initiated a 350-million dollar expansion at the Cleveland Museum of Art, will be {{carrying out the}} plans as scheduled. [...] In 2010, Gehry attended the groundbreaking for {{the second phase of}} the expansion, due to be completed in 2012. [...] In that phase, a new art handling facility was created on the south side of the building, enabling the museum to reclaim a street level entrance, closed since the mid-1970s, which leads to a 640-foot-long vaulted walkway that extends across the museum and is original to the 1928 building. This north entrance will be reopened to the public as a part of the [...] "core project", which is scheduled for completion in 2020. The core project also focuses on the interior of the current building and will add 90,000 square feet of public space, including 11,500 square feet of new gallery space for American art and contemporary art. [...] In addition, a new space called the forum will be created, along with dining and retail spaces. Said Gehry: [...] "When it's done, people coming to this museum will have an experience that's as big as Bilbao. It won't be apparent from the outside, but it will knock their <b>socks</b> <b>off</b> inside." ...|$|E
2500|$|In early 2007 it {{had been}} {{announced}} Sebastian would be recording a tribute album of soul classics in Memphis, Tennessee with Stax musicians who played on and wrote some of the original songs. The album was recorded at Ardent Studios, Memphis in August 2007, with Steve Cropper, Donald 'Duck' Dunn, and Steve Potts (a.k.a. The MGs), with Lester Snell on keyboards. Cropper also co-produced the album with Sebastian, which was recorded on analogue tape live in the studio. Sebastian wrote about his time in Memphis {{in a series of}} blogs for Australian newspapers, [...] "I started recording four days ago with the band members from Booker T and the MGs. And in the four days, we cut 15 tracks. It's been such a great experience to watch these guys work. I mean, they are mostly in their late 60s and have such a wealth of experience." [...] Cropper later spoke on AllMemphisMusic, an online Memphis radio station, [...] "This kid came into Memphis, and just blew everybody's <b>socks</b> <b>off.</b> [...] he just took us by storm." [...] Shortly after Sebastian's return to Australia it was announced that The MGs would tour Australia with him in early 2008. The Memphis Album debuted at number three in November 2007, and was the seventh highest selling Australian artist album of the year. The critically acclaimed album reached double platinum certification in 2008. The Memphis Flyer, a weekly alternative newspaper serving the Memphis area wrote a series of articles about Sebastian recording with The MGs. AllMemphisMusic, which specialises in playing music originating from Memphis, began playing The Memphis Album songs in late December 2007. They also had two special programs featuring songs from the album and interviews with some of the people involved in recording it.|$|E
5000|$|The Temple in the Underworld has {{received}} positive reviews. MetalReviews.com {{gave it a}} 87 out of 100, stating: [...] "Its riffs are simply amazing, prog-tinged creations of epic melody that will have you gasping with pleasurable shock even as you headbang. Seriously, the hordes of thrashers out there will have their <b>socks</b> blown <b>off</b> by even {{a few seconds of}} first track proper 'Casilda's Song', which starts out with epic heavy metal and builds until Big Boss begins to sing and snarl in his usual inimitable way. The riffing speeds up, taking a catchy beatdown that most modern thrash bands would kill to have thought of and the tension builds until the music reaches an almost transcendental point, announcing the band's presence in style".|$|R
2500|$|The {{following}} month, Foley {{began an}} angle with Vince McMahon, with Mankind {{trying to be}} a friend to the hated Mr. McMahon. On the October 5 episode of Raw, while McMahon was in a hospital nursing wounds suffered at the hands of The Undertaker and Kane, Mankind arrived to cheer him up. Having succeeded only in irritating McMahon, Mankind then took a <b>sock</b> <b>off</b> his foot to create a sock puppet named [...] "Mr. Socko". Intended to be a one-time joke, Socko became an overnight sensation. Mankind began putting the sock on his hand before applying his finisher, the mandible claw, stuffing a smelly sock in the mouths of opposing wrestlers. The sweatsock became massively popular with the fans, mainly because it was marketed (mostly by Jerry [...] "The King" [...] Lawler during the events) as being a dirty, smelly, sweaty, repulsive, and vile sock. McMahon manipulated Mankind, who saw the WWF owner as a father figure, into doing his bidding. McMahon created the Hardcore Championship and awarded it to Mankind, making him the first-ever champion of the hardcore division. Mankind was then pushed as the favorite to win the WWF Championship at Survivor Series, as McMahon appeared to be manipulating the tournament so that Mankind would win. He and The Rock both reached the finals, where McMahon turned on Mankind. As The Rock placed Mankind in the Sharpshooter, McMahon ordered the timekeeper to ring the bell even though Mankind did not submit, a reference to the Montreal Screwjob from the year before. As a result of Survivor Series, Mankind officially transitioned into a fan favorite, while The Rock became a villain and the crown jewel in McMahon's new Corporation faction.|$|R

He went out and played with it, and when they took the <b>sock</b> and shoe <b>off,</b> the skin just came right off of his foot.|$|R

The 'unnamed muse' is an artist, and was responsible for nearly all artwork used for Shoes and <b>Socks</b> <b>Off</b> releases. After deciding to end the project, one last record was written, an EP called As We Get Closer, The Room Gets Smaller.|$|E

5000|$|... "Knock Me Down" [...] {{became one}} of the most radical shifts in style for the band. The introspective lyrics, which analyze the death of Hillel Slovak and the devastating effect drugs can have on life, were a new {{approach}} for Kiedis, who primarily wrote of sexual intercourse and a hedonistic lifestyle. The vocalist did not, however, want the track to be associated with [...] "anti-drug" [...] sentiments, claiming, [...] "song is about letting your friends know that you need help and then being willing to accept the help of others when you need it, whether it's from drugs or a number of other personal problems." [...] According to music journalist Jeff Apter, the song [...] "Knock Me Down" [...] was [...] "clearly the most important track the band had ever laid down; it proved that these Peppers were more than knuckleheads with <b>socks</b> hanging <b>off</b> their cocks." [...] Musically, the track integrates the Chili Peppers' typical punk influences, but asserts heavier emphasis on melody and harmonics that lead into more alternative territory. [...] "Knock Me Down" [...] was originally recorded to be a duet between Kiedis and Frusciante, but the song was remixed before being released as a single; the new mix accidentally highlighted the guitarist's voice instead of Kiedis'.|$|R
30|$|The aim was {{to check}} for any problem with daily {{dressing}} that required {{a certain degree of}} flexion in the hip. In the original questionnaire, the word “discomfort” was used. We found that the corresponding most proper Swedish word was not a well-defined condition for our study population. Some children had problem with the combination of asking for “Pain, discomfort or difficulty” in the same question. They stated that pain or difficulty were hard to properly distinguish since pain itself causes difficulty. On the other hand, this did not cause them any problem to choose the best alternative for their answer but it gave them some minor initial confusion when answering the question. Therefore, we adjusted the question into “Do you have problem when putting on or taking <b>off</b> <b>socks</b> or shoes”.|$|R
