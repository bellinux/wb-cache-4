There was room for more animals, so the beasts ridden by our friends were easily accommodated.|$|E

60|$|Meanwhile the sweep, {{sweep of}} Madeline's dress {{as she passed}} down the stairs was drawing nearer, and in another instant {{she was in the}} room. She was beautifully dressed in silver-grey silk, plentifully trimmed with black lace, and cut <b>square</b> <b>back</b> and front so as to show her rounded shoulders. She wore no ornaments, being one of the few women who are able to {{dispense}} with them, unless indeed a red camellia pinned in the front of her dress can be called an ornament. Bottles, shivering with shame and doubt behind his curtain, marked that red camellia, and wondered of what it reminded him.|$|E
60|$|When {{she struck}} the first {{whirling}} mountain, she fell upon it quite softly, {{but before she}} had time to think, she flew {{through the air and}} lit with a jar {{on the side of the}} next mountain. Again she flew and alighted, and again and still again, until after five successive bumps she fell sprawling upon a green meadow and was so dazed and bewildered by her bumpy journey across the Merry-Go-Round Mountains that she lay quite still for a time to collect her thoughts. Toto had escaped from her arms just as she fell, and he now sat beside her panting with excitement. Then Dorothy realized that someone was helping her to her feet, and here was Button-Bright on one side of her and Scraps on the other, both seeming to be unhurt. The next object her eyes fell upon was the Woozy, squatting upon his <b>square</b> <b>back</b> end and looking at her reflectively, while Toto barked joyously to find his mistress unhurt after her whirlwind trip.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to evaluate the performance of rounded and backed books against books left <b>square</b> <b>backed.</b> The variables which are introduced into the study will enable the results to provide needed information on the performance of the many different binding constructions librarians and library binders are confronted with. Rounding and backing is an optional operation when binding a book, an operation which is sometimes by-passed on smaller books. A book that is not rounded and <b>backed</b> is <b>square</b> <b>backed.</b> It is suspected that rounding and backing a book will indeed enhance its performance and durability, therefore guaranteeing more circulations and a longer life. The books were tested in the Dudley A. Weiss Book Testing Laboratory at Rochester Institute of Technology. The testing procedures used, the Tumble Tester and the Universal Book Tester, were designed to accelerate simulated book usage. During the destructive testing, visual observations were made at progressive time intervals {{to determine the effects of}} rounding and <b>backing</b> versus <b>square</b> <b>backed,</b> thus answering all the questions stated in the objectives section in Chapter 2. Upon the completion of all testing, the observations were summarized to determine what effect rounding and backing had on the performance of the books. Many very interesting observations were made. When rounding and backing a book, the ridge that is formed when bending the pages or signatures over one-another, does indeed provide added support to the joint strength and the binding. However; to assure the best possible performance of a rounded and backed book, it is important that a uniform layer of joint adhesive is applied. A book lacking good joint adhesion will destruct much faster than a book guaranteed to have optimum joint adhesion, whether rounded and <b>backed</b> or <b>square</b> <b>backed...</b>|$|R
