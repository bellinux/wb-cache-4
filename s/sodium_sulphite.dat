40|$|A {{procedure}} is described for the automatic determination of serum globulin con-centration, which is {{estimated by the}} turbidity produced by precipitation in a <b>sodium</b> sulphate-sodium <b>sulphite</b> solution. UTOMATIC ESTIMATION of serum globulins in human serum is normally measured as {{the difference between the}} total protein and the albumin as estimated by the dye binding capacity of the albumin, usually using 2 -(4 ’hydroxyazobenzene) (HABA). However, {{it has been shown that}} a variety of drugs will upset dye uptake by the albumin (1). In addi-tion, the absorbance of the native serum is so high, and the wavelength of maximum absorption of the bound HABA dye so close to that of serum, that it is necessary to run blanks on all samples estimated. Glenn (2) showed that serum globulins could be estimated auto-matically by the precipitation of the globulins of the serum proteins by a 27. 4 % (w/v) sodium sulphate solution and that the resultant turbidity bore a direct relationship to the globulin present in the serum. This method was modified by Jones (3) so that it was suitable for use with a 15 mm flowcefl. In our experience, however, we have found that the sodium sulphate solution must be kept warm in order to prevent crystallization during the estimations, and further, that the globulin precipitate tends to form in large unequal particles and hence causes an irregular response by the recorder. In addition, the base line tends to rise continually throughout a series of estimations due to precipita-tion of the globulins on the walls of the flowcell.

40|$|This work {{presented}} {{an investigation of}} some of the fundamental factors that affect the physical and chemical absorption of pure oxygen and air into water, <b>sodium</b> sulphate and <b>sulphite</b> solutions. A stainless-steel, 18 cm-diameter baffled-tank reactor, fitted with a 6 -blade turbine-impeller was used. For the physical absorption of oxygen and of air, the rates have been measured and the volumetric mass transfer coefficients were successfully correlated with both gas-velocity and stirring-speed. For the chemical absorption of oxygen and of air in sodium-sulphite solutions, cobalt-sulphate was used as the catalyst. Chemical absorption rates were measured using the conventional iodometric method. Enhancement factor, “Φ”, was calculated at the different conditions in order to find the proper regime for this reaction. Accordingly, van Krevelen and Hoftijzer models were used. It should be noted that, in calculating “Φ”, use was made of the values of the volumetric mass transfer coefficients calculated previously for the physical absorption in the sulphate solutions, at the same total ionic strength as sulphite solutions and at otherwise constant conditions. The results pointed out that the reaction of oxygen with sodium-sulphite, was believed to be pseudo-first-order with respect to oxygen and zero-order with respect to sulphite, under the prevailing conditions. 4 th international conference & exhibition.

40|$|The {{influence}} of sulphonic and carboxylic acid groups {{in combination with}} the effect of counter ion form, on the swelling capacity of mechanical pulp fibres was studied by means of water retention value (WRV) measured in the temperature range from 25 to 95 oC. Mechanical pulp fibres (TMP) were treated with hydrogen peroxide and/or <b>sodium</b> <b>sulphite</b> during conditions resembling those used in chemimechanical and bleaching processes commonly used in the industry. In conventional chemimechanical processes sulphite treatment is used before refining while peroxide treatment can be utilized both before and after refining. In this study we did however also use sulphite after peroxide treatment. When subjecting <b>sodium</b> <b>sulphite</b> treated pulps to a subsequent hydrogen peroxide step, all pulps show a decrease in sulphonic acid groups, which could be owed to dissolution of highly charged lignin. Pulps treated with a high hydrogen peroxide charge (4 %), showed a loss in carboxylic acid groups during subsequent treatment with <b>sodium</b> <b>sulphite.</b> This loss is probably due to dissolution of highly charged fibre material such as demethylated pectins. Both increased degree of sulphonation and carboxylation of the lignin reduces the softening temperature by means of reducing the degree of cross-linking in the lignin matrix. This softening probably improves the compressibility of the fibre pads in the sample holders of the WRV centrifuge, which would counteract an otherwise expected increasing WRV-value due to increased swelling potential. This makes it difficult to see clear trends in WRV as a function of increase in degree of sulphonation and carboxylation.

But during the pyrometallurgical treatment of sulphide polymetallic ores significant amount of selenium along with radiogenic osmium and rhenium is concentrated in the solid-phase products of acid wash extraction and cannot be extracted, as gets lost with discharged chromium-containing solutions of osmium stage. The paper presents results of research into selenium reduction in the chromium-containing sulfuric acid medium by sulfurous gas and <b>sodium</b> <b>sulphite.</b> The use of the above reducers in optimum conditions leads to almost complete recovery of selenium (VI) while selenium (IV) extraction rate is not exceeding 60  %. The chrome (III) present in solutions has {{no impact on the}} selenium extraction rate. Chrome (VI) is almost completely reduced to a trivalent state, thus its negative impact on subsequent rhenium sorption from solutions purified from selenium is excluded. In view of a high rate of selenium extraction from chromium-containing sulfuric acid solutions formed in the process of radiogenic osmium production using sulfurous gas and <b>sodium</b> <b>sulphite,</b> choice of a method for selenium reduction is to a great extent dependent on the company’s profile...|$|E
40|$|The {{employment}} of colloid quantum dots {{in a number}} of applications is limited by their instability under light irradiation. Additional methods of photostability enhancement of UV+ visible-irradiated TGA-stabilized CdTe quantum dots are investigated. Photostability enhancement was observed via either addition of <b>sodium</b> <b>sulphite</b> in the role of chemical oxygen absorber or addition of 1 % of gelatin, or, finally, by additional stabilization by bovine serum albumine (BSA). The latter method is the most promising since it not only enhances [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The article {{represents}} {{the results of}} researches that allow to establish the appropriateness of usage of aspenwood modified by sodium monosulphite as a raw material for thermomechanical pulp (TMP) in newsprint production. Replacement of 30 % of sprucewood by aspen using 1 % consumption of <b>sodium</b> <b>sulphite</b> permits to achieve strength of samples of unbleached TMP 4510 m, which ensures the highest demands to newsprint. In this case the process of wood grinding accelerates and the reactivity of hemicelluloses and lignin increases...|$|E
3000|$|... α-Cellulose (powdered cellulose) was {{obtained}} from the corn cob using inorganic substances following a procedure based on that reported elsewhere (Azubuike et al. 2011). Briefly, the method involved the delignification of the cellulosic material with 3.5 % nitric acid and 0.01 % <b>sodium</b> <b>sulphite</b> at 90 °C for 2 h followed by treatment with 2 % sodium hydroxide extraction and 2 % <b>sodium</b> <b>sulphite</b> at 50 °C for 1 h and 17.5 % sodium hydroxide at 80 °C for 0.5 h. Bleaching was carried out with 3.2 % sodium hypochlorite at 40 °C for 1.5 h. The α-cellulose powder obtained from the corn cob was hydrolyzed at room temperature with 2 N hydrochloric acid under reflux for 15 min (Paralikar and Bhatawdekar 1988); the solid-liquor ratio was 1 : 10. The hydrolyzed cellulose was thoroughly washed with cold distilled water until neutral to litmus paper and then air dried. The microcrystalline cellulose obtained via this process was labelled MCMSa. This procedure was repeated for the α-cellulose for reflux times of 30 and 45 min, respectively; the microcrystalline cellulose powders obtained via this process were labelled MCMSb and MCMSc, respectively. The physicochemical, spectroscopic and thermal properties of the microcrystalline cellulose powders obtained from the corn cobs were compared with that of Avicel® PH 101 (MCCA).|$|E
