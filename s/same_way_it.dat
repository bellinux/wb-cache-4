5|$|After {{a quarrel}} with Barkis, and realizing {{he was only}} after her {{supposed}} wealth, Victoria follows the procession of dead to the church. Emily notices Victoria and realizes that she is denying Victoria her chance at happiness the <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> was stolen from her. She stops Victor from drinking the poison and reunites him with Victoria. Barkis interrupts them, and Emily recognizes him as her former fiance, who is revealed {{to be the one}} who murdered her for her dowry. Barkis tries to kidnap Victoria at sword point, but Victor stops him and the two men duel; the dead townspeople are unable to interfere with the affairs of the living. Emily intercedes to save Victor, and Barkis mockingly proposes a toast to Emily, unknowingly drinking the cup of poison. The dead, able to intercede upon Barkis's death, eagerly take retribution against him by dragging him to the underworld where he will atone for his crimes. Victoria, now a widow, is once again able to marry Victor.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens with}} Inna {{answering}} {{to a call}} she gets from Stan on her Lenovo smartphone, of which the ringtone is the saxophone riff featured in the song. Subsequently, both are presented standing {{close to each other}} in front of a red backdrop and a cactus. The next scene portrays Stan and some backup dancers hanging out in the dressing room of a club, with her eventually going downstairs to the full party hall and later meeting Inna there. Next, Yankee makes a cameo appearance in the clip, followed by both singers performing a synchronized choreography. The video ends in the <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> opens. Cut scenes portray Yankee, Stan and Inna singing and dancing to the song in front of yellow, green and blue backdrops, Inna performing to the club's crowd or Stan dancing on a runaway.|$|E

Though mezcal is not as popular as tequila (made specifically from the blue agave in select regions of the country), Mexico does export the product, mostly to Japan and the United States, and exports are growing.|$|E
25|$|The word dhoti {{is derived}} from dhauti (Sanskrit: धौती), meaning to cleanse or wash. In the context of clothing, it simply refers to the {{cleansed}} garment which was worn during shrauta sacrifices or religious sessions in general. The dhoti evolved from the ancient antriya which was passed through the legs, tucked at the back and covered the legs loosely, then flowed into long pleats at front of the legs, the <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> is worn today.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the ANFC {{changed its name}} to the National Football League, but {{continued}} to operate in substantially the <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> had previously. The body worked to introduce a night representative series in 1976 and remodel representative football and interstate carnivals. In 1977, the VFL established a rival competition to the NFL's night series, called the Australian Football Championships (AFC), and by 1980 this competition had replaced the NFL's competition. Through the 1980s, administration of the game increasingly shifted towards Victoria.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason why}} SCNT {{is used for}} cloning is because somatic cells can be easily {{acquired}} and cultured in the lab. This process can either add or delete specific genomes of farm animals. A key point {{to remember is that}} cloning is achieved when the oocyte maintains its normal functions and instead of using sperm and egg genomes to replicate, the oocyte is inserted into the donor’s somatic cell nucleus. The oocyte will react on the somatic cell nucleus, the <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> would on sperm cells.|$|E

Despite its drastic diminution - Serious Materials had called back 75 of the plant's 250 employees, with only 38 employed by the closing's announcement - workers successfully negotiated an agreement with management by that night. Assistance and publicity coincided with the Occupy movement in Chicago, members of which came to the plant. The union agreed to 90 days of employment before the plants closing.|$|E
25|$|Some bank {{accounts}} are afforded an extra degree of privacy. Information concerning such accounts, known as numbered accounts, {{is restricted to}} senior bank officers, rather than being accessible to all the employees of a bank. However, the information required to open such an account {{is no different from}} that of an ordinary account; completely anonymous accounts are not allowed by law. Should a criminal investigation take place, law enforcement has access to information related to a numbered account in the <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> has access to information about any other account.|$|E
25|$|Piaget studied {{areas of}} {{intelligence}} like perception and memory {{that are not}} entirely logical. Logical concepts are described as being completely reversible because they can always {{get back to the}} starting point. The perceptual concepts Piaget studied could not be manipulated. To describe the figurative process, Piaget uses pictures as examples. Pictures can’t be separated because contours cannot be separated from the forms they outline. Memory is the <b>same</b> <b>way.</b> <b>It</b> is never completely reversible. During this last period of work, Piaget and his colleague Inhelder also published books on perception, memory, and other figurative processes such as learning.|$|E

25|$|Pottery {{has a long}} {{tradition}} that extends into the pre-Hispanic period. Oaxaca shares many pottery types with other parts of Mexico along with two of its own: barro negro and the green glazed pottery of Atzompa. The first is centered in the town of San Bartolo Coyotepec near the capital city. This pottery gets its color from the local clay used to make it and its shine from a technique developed by Doña Rosa Nieto in the mid-20th century. The Atompa green-glazed ware is made much the <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> was in colonial times, although there have been some recent innovations with color and decorative techniques. This pottery is found in Santa María Atzompa, near Oaxaca city.|$|E
25|$|Alligators, {{much like}} birds, {{have been shown}} to exhibit {{unidirectional}} movement of air through their lungs. Most other amniotes are believed to exhibit bidirectional, or tidal breathing. For a tidal breathing animal, such as a mammal, air flows {{into and out of the}} lungs through branching bronchi which terminate in small dead-end chambers called alveoli. As the alveoli represent dead-ends to flow, the inspired air must move back out the <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> came in. In contrast, air in alligator lungs makes a circuit, moving in only one direction through the parabronchi. The air first enters the outer branch, moves through the parabronchi, and exits the lung through the inner branch. Oxygen exchange takes place in extensive vasculature around the parabronchi.|$|E
25|$|The {{role of the}} Crown is both {{legal and}} practical; it {{functions}} in British Columbia in the <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> does in all of Canada's other provinces, being the centre of a constitutional construct in which the institutions of government acting under the sovereign's authority share {{the power of the}} whole. It is thus the foundation of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of the province's government. The Canadian monarch—since 6 February 1952, Queen Elizabeth II—is represented and her duties carried out by the Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia, whose direct participation in governance is limited by the conventional stipulations of constitutional monarchy, with most related powers entrusted for exercise by the elected parliamentarians, the ministers of the Crown generally drawn from amongst them, and the judges and justices of the peace. The Crown today primarily functions as a guarantor of continuous and stable governance and a nonpartisan safeguard against the abuse of power. This arrangement began with an 1871 Order in Council by Queen Victoria and continued an unbroken line of monarchical government extending back to the late 18th century. However, though British Columbia has a separate government headed by the Queen, as a province, British Columbia is not itself a kingdom.|$|E

25|$|The Curia Urbis or the Vicariate of the City of Rome {{was divided}} into four {{departments}} (officia), of which the second is again divided into four sections. The first department (officium) has under its care all the church services and the Apostolic visitation of the diocese. The second department watches over the behaviour of the clergy and the Christian people. Judicial matters are settled in the third department, and the fourth department {{is devoted to the}} economic administration of the entire vicariate. The head of all these bureaus is the cardinal who is the vicar-general of the pope in Rome. His office and the extent of his power are always the same and are permanent, so that they do not cease even when the Papal See is vacant. This fact distinguishes the cardinal vicar as he is called, for the designation is not an official title, from all other vicars-general in the world, and gives him his peculiar legal position. In the <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> is a noticeable exception that the four departments can carry on their customary business, even when the vicar is not able to supervise what is done on account of the conclave or of some other impediment. Even should the vicar die the work of the departments goes quietly on. Formerly {{this was not the case}} to so large a degree, as is shown by the deputation of 17 December 1876, on the death of Cardinal Vicar Patrizi.|$|E

500|$|... "The Duel" [...] {{marked the}} directorial debut of Dean Holland, a {{longtime}} film editor with The Office. The original {{cut of the}} episode was 38 minutes long and Holland, who edited it himself, had to trim it down to 22 minutes. During a cold open scene, the Dunder Mifflin employees run past a radar speed sign {{in the street and}} compete for the best speed. This was inspired by Aaron Shure, a television producer and The Office screenwriter, who worked on the staff of another television show that held races in front of a radar speed sign in exactly the <b>same</b> <b>way.</b> <b>It</b> was about 96 degrees when the scene was filmed, which made running particularly difficult for the actors. Despite the extremely hot temperatures, fake snow was placed in the exterior shots because the writers were trying to simulate the winter season weather of Scranton, Pennsylvania, where The Office is set, rather than the Van Nuys district in Los Angeles, California, where the show is filmed.|$|E
