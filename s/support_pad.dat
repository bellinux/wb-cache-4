The suspension system is adjustable allowing the user to position the field pack where it is most comfortable. The field pack has lower back padding {{as well as an}} extended lumbar <b>support</b> <b>pad</b> and the shoulder pads are made of bi-laminate foam. A softer, open cell foam is against the body for comfort followed by a stiffer closed cell foam for stability and good recovery after compression.|$|E
50|$|A {{bottle jack}} or whiskey jack is a jack which resembles a bottle in shape, having a {{cylindrical}} {{body and a}} neck. Within is a vertical lifting ram with a <b>support</b> <b>pad</b> of some kind fixed to the top. The jack may be hydraulic or work by screw action. In the hydraulic version the hydraulic ram emerges from the body vertically by hydraulic pressure provided by a pump either on the baseplate or at a remote location via a pressure hose. With a single action piston the lift range is somewhat limited, so its use for lifting vehicles is limited to those with a relatively high clearance. For lifting structures such as houses the hydraulic interconnection of multiple vertical jacks through valves enables the even distribution of forces while enabling close control of the lift. The screw version of the bottle jack works by turning a large nut running on the threaded vertical ram at {{the neck of the}} body. The nut has gear teeth and is turned by a bevel gear spigotted to the body, the bevel gear being turned manually by a jack handle fitting into a square socket. The ram may have a second screwed ram within it, which doubles the lifting range telescopically.|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} {{resource}} saving technique {{is used for}} shape optimization of 3 D mechanical objects. According to statistical data, appearance of cracks {{in the areas of}} barrel <b>support</b> <b>pads</b> of tank wagons often causes damages to the barrels. The shape optimization of barrel <b>support</b> <b>pads</b> of a tank wagon is implemented and, as result, the concentration of stresses is significantly reduced in the barrel support areas. The optimization technique is based on CAD/CAE, design of experiment, approximation and optimization software packages. The shape of the <b>support</b> <b>pads</b> is defined by NURBS polygon points that serve as design parameters. For reduction of computational resources, FE models of tank wagon are replaced with high-quality metamodels which are based on locally weighted polynomials.

40|$|Self-piloting tools {{feature the}} unique use of two <b>support</b> <b>pads</b> and the {{surrounding}} hole as a guide bushing to steer itself along the hole being machined. The piloting hole, {{in conjunction with the}} two <b>support</b> <b>pads,</b> provides for the tool balance in the hole transverse cross-section. However, in the axial section plane, the tool alignment with the piloting hole depends on the boring bar to which the tool appears as a solid extension. This study shows that the alterations in the output quality and the support pads' wear pattern can be explained by in-process encountered boring bar bending. This is because even minor inclinations near the tool tip appear significant when considered in the small front-end area of the <b>support</b> <b>pads</b> where burnishing occurs. The study is to explain the inherent feature of the conventional self-piloting tool design to deflect the boring bar in 3 D enough to make a difference between the effective area involved in burnishing and the area as designed...|$|R

Besides the obvious differences between mono, stereo and three-way inputs, which support mono (single-zone), stereo (dual-zone) or three-zone pads accordingly, there are additional differences in the capabilities of stereo inputs. While some stereo inputs only <b>support</b> <b>pads</b> with a piezo and a switch (piezo/switch inputs), others also <b>support</b> <b>pads</b> with two piezos (piezo/piezo inputs). Also, some stereo inputs are only intended to be split into two mono inputs by using an insert cable (mono/mono inputs). Certain pairs of stereo inputs can be configured to form one three-way input.|$|R

40|$|The Netherlands {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{countries}} in the world to establish a legal framework for physician assisted dying (PAD). In this article, we provide an overview of the public, political, legal, and medical debates on physician-assisted dying in the Netherlands, focusing on the role of psychiatry and mental illness. The number of individuals with chronic mental illness requesting PAD has been relatively small (although the number can be expected to increase because of the activities of various civic organizations advocating the right to die) and Dutch psychiatrists have been extremely reluctant to respond to such requests. Nevertheless, mental conditions have been central to the public debate on PAD by helping to define the nature and limits of current legislation and professional practice. Although a few Dutch psychiatrists have campaigned to increase the involvement of psychiatrists and many <b>support</b> <b>PAD</b> in principle, the majority has been hesitant to engage in PAD despite increasing public pressure...|$|E
40|$|A high-flow (10 L/min) {{nanoparticle}} respiratory deposition (NRD) sampler {{was designed}} and evaluated to facilitate lower limits of quantification (LOQ) for metal nanoparticles than a low-flow (2. 5 L/min) version. The high-flow NRD consists of an inlet, impactor stage, diffusion stage, and a final filter. For the impactor stage, three nozzle sections each containing 12 nozzles were designed from theory to achieve a cut-off diameter (d 50) of 300 nm. Various depths of 37 -mm-diameter foam cylinders were tested for the diffusion stage to obtain a collection efficiency curve similar to the deposition of nanoparticles in the human respiratory tract, the nanoparticulate matter (NPM) criterion. The objective for the final filter was a collection efficiency of near 100 % with minimal pressure drop. The collection efficiencies by size and pressure drop were measured for all components. The impactor stage {{with one of the}} nozzle plates had a d 50 of 305 nm. The collection efficiency for the foam with a depth of 7 cm adjusted for presence of the impactor was the closest match to the NPM curve with a R 2 value of 0. 96. Chemical analysis of the metal content for foam media affirmed that the high-flow NRD would require less sampling time to meet LOQs than the 2. 5 L/min NRD. The final filter with a modified <b>support</b> <b>pad</b> had a collection efficiency near 100 %. The overall pressure drop of the sampler 4. 4 kPa (17. 5 in.

40|$|The Crawler Transporter (CT), {{designed}} and built for the Apollo Program in the 1960 's and surpassing its initial operational life, has {{become an integral part}} of the Space Shuttle Program (SSP). The CT transports the Space Shuttle Vehicle (SSV) stack, atop the Mobile Launch Platform (MLP), from the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) to the launch pad. This support structure provides hydraulic jacking, leveling and load equalization for the 12 million pound stack on its 3. 5 - 5. 0 mile rollout to the launch pad. Major elements of the SSV, consisting of the orbiter, solid rocket boosters (SRB) and external tank (ET) have required fatigue analyses as part of the mission life certification. Compared to rollout vibration, the SSV sees relatively high vibration loads during launch, ascent, descent and landing phases of the mission. Although preliminary measured SRB vibration levels during rollout were of low amplitude and frequency, the duration of the rollout phase is typically high, from 5 - 6 hours. As part of an expanded mission life assessment, additional certification effort was initiated to define fatigue load spectra for rollout. This study addresses the CT vibration analyses in support of the rollout fatigue study. Structural models developed for modal and vibration analyses were used to identify unique CT, CT/MLP and CT/MLP/SRB vibration characteristics for comparison to instrumented rollout tests. Whereas the main structural and vibration characteristics of the SSV are well defined, minimum analytical and vibration test data on the Crawler Transporter were available. Unique vibration characteristics of the CT are attributable to the drive mechanism, hydraulic jacking system, structural framing and the CT-to-MLP <b>support</b> <b>pad</b> restraints. Initial tests performed on the CT/MLP/SRB configuration showed reasonable correlation with predicted mode shapes and frequencies...|$|E
