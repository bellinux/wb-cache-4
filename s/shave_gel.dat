50|$|Post-foaming <b>shaving</b> <b>gels</b> {{have been}} found to have {{benefits}} over regular pressurized shaving cream in the prevention of pseudofolliculitis barbae. This is due to their better hair softening qualities; post-foaming <b>shaving</b> <b>gels</b> allow more water to enter the hair shaft, which leads to the hair becoming softer and easier to cut.|$|R

50|$|In the 1970s, <b>shaving</b> <b>gel</b> was {{developed}} that is dispensed from a pressurized can. In 1993, The Procter & Gamble Company patented a post-foaming gel composition, which turns the gel into a foam after {{application to the}} skin, combining properties of both foams and gels.|$|R
50|$|Ways {{to prevent}} razor burn include keeping the skin moist, using a shaving brush and lather, using a {{moisturizing}} <b>shaving</b> <b>gel,</b> <b>shaving</b> {{in the direction}} of the hair growth, resisting the urge to shave too closely, applying minimal pressure, avoiding scratching or irritation after shaving, avoiding irritating products on the shaved area (colognes, perfumes, etc.) and using an aftershave cream with aloe vera or other emollients. Putting a warm, wet cloth on one's skin helps as well, by softening hairs. This can also be done by using pre-shave oil before the application of shaving cream.|$|R

50|$|Modern {{commercial}} creams {{are often}} sold in spray cans, {{but can also}} be purchased in tubs or tubes. Shaving creams in a can are commonly dispensed as a foam and sometimes as a gel that starts turning into foam as it is rubbed into the skin, also known as post-foaming <b>shaving</b> <b>gel.</b> Creams that are in tubes or tubs are commonly used with a shaving brush to produce a rich lather (most often used in wet shaving).|$|R
50|$|Parabens are a {{class of}} widely used {{preservatives}} in cosmetic and pharmaceutical products. Chemically, they {{are a series of}} parahydroxybenzoates or esters of parahydroxybenzoic acid (also known as 4-hydroxybenzoic acid). Parabens are effective preservatives in many types of formulas. These compounds, and their salts, are used primarily for their bactericidal and fungicidal properties. They are found in shampoos, commercial moisturizers, <b>shaving</b> <b>gels,</b> personal lubricants, topical/parenteral pharmaceuticals, spray tanning solution, makeup, and toothpaste. They are also used as food additives.|$|R
5000|$|The {{idea of a}} 10K women's {{race was}} the joint vision of elite runners Nina Kuscsik and Kathrine Switzer, and New York City Marathon co-director Fred Lebow - in the early 1970s, there was a dearth of women's road racing competitions. The race's inaugural sponsor Johnson Wax (who were {{promoting}} a women's <b>shaving</b> <b>gel</b> called Crazylegs) suggested a full marathon event (26 miles and 385 yards), but {{it was decided that}} a more manageable [...] "mini marathon" [...] race over 6 miles would be held. A total of 78 runners took part in the race, which was the world's first women-only road racing competition.|$|R

50|$|Aqueous Cream BP is a light, hydrocarbon-based emulsion, {{which is}} officially {{registered}} in the British Pharmacopoeia and categorised by the British National Formulary as a non-proprietary emollient preparation. It {{is used as a}} topical, external medicine, emollient moisturiser and general-purpose substitute for toiletries such as soap, shower <b>gel,</b> <b>shaving</b> cream and lip salve.|$|R
50|$|Shaving soap {{typically}} {{refers to}} a hard soap that is whipped into a lather using a shaving brush. The lather it produces is used to coat the face during shaving, providing protection and lubrication for the razor. Among cartridge razor users, shaving soap has largely been displaced by canned <b>shaving</b> foam or <b>gel,</b> but hard <b>shaving</b> soaps are still utilized by users of double-edge safety razors and straight razors.|$|R
5000|$|The {{simplest}} {{and most}} effective way to prevent ingrown hairs is to abstain from shaving and allow facial and body hair to grow out as normal. When shaving, there are a few precautions that can be taken to prevent ingrown hairs including proper shaving techniques and preparation of the skin before shaving. When shaving, applying the proper amount of lubrication (in the form of <b>shaving</b> cream, <b>gel,</b> or soap) is important to prevent the hair from being forced underneath the surface of the skin. Also the application of too much force with a razor can contribute to hair that is cut shorter than the surrounding dermis. [...] Using a beard trimmer at the lowest setting (1 mm or 0.5 mm) instead of shaving is an effective alternative.|$|R
50|$|Before wet shaving, {{the area}} to be shaved is usually doused in warm to hot water by {{showering}} or bathing or covered for several minutes with a hot wet towel to soften the skin and hair. A lathering or lubricating agent such as cream, <b>shaving</b> soap, <b>gel,</b> foam or oil is normally applied after this. Lubricating and moisturizing the skin to be shaved helps prevent a painful razor burn. Many razor cartridges include a lubricating strip, made of polyethylene glycol, to function instead of or in supplement to extrinsic agents. It also lifts and softens the hairs, causing them to swell. This enhances the cutting action and sometimes permits cutting the hairs slightly {{below the surface of}} the skin. Additionally, during shaving, the lather indicates areas that have not been addressed. When soap is used, it is generally applied with a shaving brush, which has long, soft bristles. It is worked up into a usable lather by the brush, either against the face, in a shaving mug, bowl, scuttle, or palm of the hand.|$|R
