40|$|The {{diversity}} of the proletariat during the final two decades of the 20 th century {{reached a point where}} traditional socialist and communist parties could not represent all sections of the working class. Moreover, the development of social movements other than the working class after the 1960 s further sidelined traditional parties. The anti-capitalist movements in the 1970 s and 1980 s were looking for new political formations. This work is an effort to study the synthesis of the traditional <b>vanguard</b> <b>socialist</b> <b>party</b> and spontaneous working class movements with other social groups. The multi-tendency socialist organisation that formed in many countries after 1980 {{has its roots in the}} Marxist theories of earlier epochs. It is a mass organisation based on the direct initiatives of activists of all social movements springing from below. Its internal relations are not hierarchical but based on the horizontal relations between organs. This is an organisation belonging to both civil society and political society. 	 This study does not suggest that the era for a <b>vanguard</b> Leninist <b>party</b> is completely over. In some dictatorial societies a centralised party is the most appropriate political method of organising workers and the poor, and fighting oppression and censorship. After the success of a political revolution such a party would face the question of coalition and cooperation with other progressive forces. Therefore in the transitional epoch of the early 21 st century both traditional types of <b>vanguard</b> <b>parties</b> and multi-tendency organisations coexist. The most successful socialist multi-tendency organisation is the one in which the communists and radical socialists are able to maintain the continuity of the organisation and influence a considerable section of the working class and poor. Though the formations of multi-tendency organisations have experienced setbacks in some countries those setbacks do not undermine their achievements in Latin America. The multi-tendency socialist organisation is the only viable alternative to the present capitalist system...|$|R

50|$|A <b>vanguard</b> <b>party</b> is a {{political}} party at the fore of a mass-action political movement and of a revolution. In the praxis of political science, {{the concept of the}} <b>vanguard</b> <b>party,</b> composed of professional revolutionaries, was first effected by the Bolshevik Party in the Russian Revolution of 1917. Lenin (Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov), the first leader of the Bolsheviks, coined the term <b>vanguard</b> <b>party,</b> and argued that such a party was necessary in order to provide the practical and political leadership that would impel the proletariat to achieve a communist revolution. Hence, as {{a political}}-science concept and term, <b>vanguard</b> <b>party</b> most often is associated with Leninism; however, similar concepts (under different names) also are present in other revolutionary ideologies.|$|R

50|$|In Marxist philosophy, Leninism is {{the body}} of {{political}} theory for the democratic organization of a revolutionary <b>vanguard</b> <b>party</b> and the achievement of a dictatorship of the proletariat as a political prelude {{to the establishment of}} the socialist mode of production developed by Lenin.

Lenin's main contribution to Marxist thought is the concept of the <b>vanguard</b> <b>party</b> of the working class. He conceived the <b>vanguard</b> <b>party</b> as a highly knit, centralized organization which was led by intellectuals rather than by the working class itself. The CPSU was open only to a small quantity of workers because the workers in Russia still had not developed class consciousness and needed to be educated to reach such a state. Lenin believed that the <b>vanguard</b> <b>party</b> could initiate policies {{in the name of the}} working class even if the working class did not support them.
