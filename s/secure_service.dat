But many cases of smartcard application failure can corrupt data in smartcard persistent memory. In this paper, we propose a recoverable persistent memory to maintain data consistency in a smartcard. Then, we adapt and compare two recovery algorithms used in Database Management Systems (shadow paging and before-image logging) to the smartcard memory features.
