5|$|Occurring {{close to}} shore from the <b>surf</b> <b>zone</b> {{to a depth}} of , the milk shark favors turbid water off sandy beaches and {{occasionally}} enters estuaries. In Shark Bay, Western Australia, juvenile milk sharks inhabit seagrass meadows composed of Amphibolis antarctica and Posidonia australis. Although some sources state this species avoids low salinities, it has been reported several times from fresh water in Cambodia, as far upstream as the Tonlé Sap. Milk sharks may be found anywhere in the water column from the surface to the bottom. Off KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, its numbers fluctuate annually with a peak in summer, suggesting some form of seasonal movement.|$|E
5|$|Adult and {{juvenile}} finetooth sharks form large schools. This energetic, fast-moving predator feeds mainly on small bony fishes, often entering the <b>surf</b> <b>zone</b> {{during the day}} to hunt. The most important prey of this species in the northwestern Atlantic is the Atlantic menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus), with sharks of all ages off northwestern Florida eat almost nothing else. The menhaden are swallowed whole after the head has been removed. Other known prey species include spot croaker (Leiostomus xanthurus), Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus maculatus), mullet (Mugil spp.), shrimp, and in one case a juvenile Atlantic sharpnose shark (Rhizoprionodon terraenovae), {{which may have been}} scavenged from the bycatch discard of a shrimp trawler. The finetooth shark may be preyed upon by larger sharks. Parasites documented from this species include the tapeworm Triloculatum geeceearelensis, and unidentified species in the genera Anthobothrium, Paraorygmatobothrium, and Phoreiobothrium.|$|E

The published article is copyrighted by Elsevier {{and can be found}} at: [URL] role of each habitat fish use is of great importance to the dynamics of populations. During their early marine residence, Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), an anadromous fish species, mostly inhabit estuaries but also use sandy beach <b>surf</b> <b>zones</b> and the coastal ocean. However, the role of <b>surf</b> <b>zones</b> in the early life history of Chinook salmon is unclear. We hypothesized that <b>surf</b> <b>zones</b> serve as an alternative nursery habitat, defined as a habitat that consistently provides a proportion of a population with foraging and growth rates similar to those experienced in the primary nursery. First, we confirmed that juvenile Chinook salmon cohorts are simultaneously using both habitats by combining field collections with otolith chemical and structural analysis to directly compare size and migration patterns of juveniles collected in two Oregon (USA) estuaries and <b>surf</b> <b>zones</b> during three years. We then compared juvenile catch, diet and growth in estuaries and <b>surf</b> <b>zones.</b> Juveniles were consistently caught in both habitats throughout summer.

40|$|The <b>surf</b> <b>zones</b> {{of ocean}} beaches are prime fishing sites and provide habitat for a {{diversity}} of fish species. The spatial composition of seascapes shapes fish abundance and diversity in most coastal ecosystems, but it remains untested whether seascape effects operate on ocean beaches. This study used the <b>surf</b> <b>zones</b> of sandy beaches in eastern Australia as a model system to contrast fish assemblages between the 2 main surf habitats (nearshore troughs and offshore bars), and test how habitat partitioning changes with beach exposure, wave conditions, seascape connectivity (i. e. proximity to estuaries and rocky headlands) and tide. Fish were sampled with baited remote underwater video stations from the <b>surf</b> <b>zones</b> of 18 sandy beaches in southern Queensland and northern New South Wales. Habitat type and beach exposure combined to shape fish abundance and diversity in the surf. Fish assemblages always differed between nearshore trough and offshore bar habitats; beach exposure was also important to surf fishes but did not alter the priority effects of habitat partitioning. Beach exposure is an important predictor of faunal assemblages on ocean beaches and is often used as a surrogate in conservation planning. Our results show, however, that <b>surf</b> <b>zones</b> are not single uniform spatial units but are composed of topographically and hydrodynamically distinct habitats that support correspondingly distinct fish assemblages. Because fishing effort also differs between surf habitats, fisheries management and spatial conservation planning need to reflect these spatial nuances in the <b>surf</b> <b>zones</b> of ocean beaches.

40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to assess the}} relative nursery value of tropical intertidal habitats. A new definition of a nursery habitat is proposed, based on persistence, growth and survival. Based on this definition, this thesis examines the relative nursery value of two intertidal habitats based on analyses of temporal and spatial abundance patterns, feeding success and growth rates. The relative value of these parameters for determining nursery area value is also evaluated. Fishes were sampled bimonthly with seine nets (5 mm mesh) in three selected sandy shore <b>surf</b> <b>zones</b> and three estuary mouths from the summer of 1992 to the winter of 1994. The presence of the juvenile stage of 126 species in intertidal collections from both habitats indicated that these areas are potentially important habitats for young fishes. Nested ANOVAs for species richness, total abundance and total fish biomass revealed {{no significant differences between}} sandy shore <b>surf</b> <b>zones</b> and estuary mouths. However, marked seasonal differences between summer and winter assemblages were apparent, with higher total abundance and species richness in early summer which were likely to be related to recruitment episodes. Cluster analysis suggested there were relatively strong similarities between sandy shore <b>surf</b> <b>zones</b> and estuary mouths, with little similarity between seasons. Four selected species which occur at both habitats were selected for detailed analyses of abundance, biomass, feeding success and growth rate determination: Stolephorus nelsoni, Sillago analis, Leiognathus splendens and Valamugil seheli. Analysis of variance detected no significant differences in numbers of individuals or biomass of each species between sandy shore <b>surf</b> <b>zones</b> and estuary mouths. The stomach contents of S. nelsoni, S. analis and L. splendens were examined. For all species, estuary mouth fishes had a relatively high proportion of stomachs which contained food, and a greater gut fullness than fishes taken from sandy shore <b>surf</b> <b>zones.</b> It is suggested {{that there may be a}} potential for food limitation or sub-optimal feeding conditions in sandy shore <b>surf</b> <b>zones.</b> Age-length relationships for S. nelsoni, S. analis, L. splendens and V. seheli were determined by using otolith increment counts. Daily deposition was validated in S. analis, L. splendens and V. seheli and assumed for S. nelsoni. A similar age at length relationship in both estuary mouths and sandy shore <b>surf</b> <b>zones</b> was evident in all selected species. This suggests that habitat differences may not account for growth rate in these selected species. In conclusion, for the study species examined, estuary mouths have a relatively higher nursery value than sandy shore <b>surf</b> <b>zones.</b> The relative value of nursery habitats in the tropics is likely to be species and age specific. Food accessibility may influence the value of nursery areas, but alone it is a poor predictor of nursery function...|$|R

40|$|Aim: Disturbance and {{connectivity}} {{shape the}} structure and spatial distribution of animal populations in all ecosystems, but the combined effects of these factors are rarely measured in coastal seascapes. We used <b>surf</b> <b>zones</b> of exposed sandy beaches in eastern Australia as a model seascape to test for combined effects of coastal urbanization and seascape connectivity (i. e. spatial links between <b>surf</b> <b>zones,</b> estuaries and rocky headlands) on fish assemblages. Location: Four hundred kilometres of exposed surf beaches along the eastern coastline of Australia. Methods: Fish assemblages were surveyed from <b>surf</b> <b>zones</b> of 14 ocean-exposed sandy beaches using purpose-built surf baited remote underwater video stations. Results: The degree of coastal urbanization and connectivity were strongly correlated with the spatial distribution of fish species richness and abundance and were of greater importance to surf fishes than local surf conditions. Urbanization was associated with reductions in the abundance of harvested piscivores and fish species richness. Piscivore abundance and species richness were lowest on highly urbanized coastlines, and adjacent to beaches in wilderness areas where recreational fishing is intense. By contrast, seascape connectivity was correlated with the spatial distribution of omnivore and planktivore abundance. Spatial linkages between <b>surf</b> <b>zones</b> and estuaries were also important to two globally threatened guitarfish that are of international conservation significance. Main conclusions: We show {{for the first time}} how vulnerable and iconic fish species in <b>surf</b> <b>zones</b> are affected by the presence of coastal cities and the attributes of seascapes in which these cities are embedded. It is possible that greater connectivity may lessen ‘urbanization’ impacts for species with broad diets and strong ecological links to other ecosystems – this offers new perspectives in coastal conservation, for fishes and beyond...|$|R

25|$|Wave {{breaking}} intensity {{measures the}} force of the wave as it breaks, spills, or plunges (a plunging wave is termed by surfers as a “barrel wave”).

40|$|The <b>surf</b> <b>zones</b> {{of ocean}} beaches provide habitat for a {{diversity}} of fishes and are prime sites for recreational angling and commercial net fisheries. Here, we review the global literature (152 studies) on surf fish ecology to better inform fisheries management and coastal conservation planning. These studies suggest that <b>surf</b> <b>zones</b> support diverse fish assemblages, which are characterized by high numerical dominance (10 species typically comprise 95 % of catches), but also show that few families are especially common. The composition of assemblages is highly variable, changing with fluctuations in water temperature, wave climate and the biomass of drifting algae or seagrass. Fish use <b>surf</b> <b>zones</b> as feeding habitats and transit routes, but these areas might not be widely used as spawning sites or juvenile nurseries. These systems are under escalating human pressures, most notably from coastal urbanization and recreational angling. Despite the recognized ecological and economic importance of surf-zone fishes, few studies have tested for impacts of urbanization or fishing. The benefits of marine reserves for fish in <b>surf</b> <b>zones</b> are also rarely measured. We suggest that progress {{will be made by}} moving from largely descriptive studies to hypothesis-driven research, which is guided by contemporary ecological theory and adapts modern techniques from research in other ecosystems.

25|$|One {{disadvantage}} of land-based facilities {{arises from the}} turbulent wave action in the <b>surf</b> <b>zone.</b> OTEC discharge pipes should be placed in protective trenches to prevent subjecting them to extreme stress during storms and prolonged periods of heavy seas.

25|$|Beach {{nourishment}} (also {{referred to}} as beach renourishment, beach replenishment, or sand replenishment) describes a process by which sediment, usually sand, lost through longshore drift or erosion is replaced from other sources. A wider beach can reduce storm damage to coastal structures by dissipating energy across the <b>surf</b> <b>zone,</b> protecting upland structures and infrastructure from storm surges, tsunamis and unusually high tides. Beach nourishment is typically {{part of a larger}} coastal defense scheme. Nourishment is typically a repetitive process since it does not remove the physical forces that cause erosion but simply mitigates their effects.|$|E
25|$|One {{way that}} OTEC systems can avoid {{some of the}} {{problems}} and expenses of operating in a <b>surf</b> <b>zone</b> is by building them just offshore in waters ranging from 10 to 30 meters deep (Ocean Thermal Corporation 1984). This type of plant would use shorter (and therefore less costly) intake and discharge pipes, which would avoid the dangers of turbulent surf. The plant itself, however, would require protection from the marine environment, such as breakwaters and erosion-resistant foundations, and the plant output would need to be transmitted to shore.|$|E

25|$|Different onshore and {{off shore}} wind {{patterns}} in the <b>surf</b> <b>zone</b> create different types of waves. Onshore winds cause random wave breaking patterns and {{are more suitable for}} experienced surfers. Light offshore winds create smoother waves, while strong direct offshore winds cause plunging or large barrel waves. Barrel waves are large because the water depth is small when the wave breaks. Thus, the breaker intensity (or force) increases, and the wave speed and height increase. Off shore winds produce non-surfable conditions by flattening a weak swell. Weak swell is made from surface gravity forces and has long wavelengths.|$|E
25|$|The plan {{to salvage}} Pasha Bulker used anchors laid out at sea, which {{the ship was}} to use to then winch itself seawards, and three tug boats towing it {{with the aim of}} {{dragging}} the bow over a rock reef.

25|$|The first {{classification}} {{is a type}} 1 jetty. This type of jetty {{is significantly}} longer than the <b>surf</b> <b>zone</b> width and the waves break at the shore end of the jetty. The effect of a Type 1 jetty is sediment accumulation in a wedge formation on the jetty. These waves are large and increase in size as they pass over the sediment wedge formation. An example of a Type 1 jetty is Mission Beach, San Diego, California. This 1000-meter jetty was installed in 1950 {{at the mouth of}} Mission Bay. The surf waves happen north of the jetty, are longer waves, and are powerful. The bathymetry of the sea bottom in Mission Bay has a wedge shape formation that causes the waves to refract as they become closer to the jetty. The waves converge constructively after they refract and increase the sizes of the waves.|$|E
40|$|New {{insights}} about nearshore dynamics came from studying {{the effects of}} regular storms in South Australia on drifting marine macrophytes, consequent wrack accumulation and associated fauna in beach <b>surf</b> <b>zones</b> across three different regions. This study examined whether the influence of storms may be more pronounced in sheltered coastal waters compared to more exposed coastlines where biota could have adaptations to persist in larger swell conditions. There were obvious regional differences for wrack species richness, abundances and assemblages that matched the attached floral subtidal landscape in each region. Consequently, invertebrates also differed amongst regions, which highlight the close affinity that some invertebrates have with drifting macrophytes. Fish were not so closely aligned to the regional patterns identified for wrack or invertebrates suggesting that many fish are using wrack accumulations as habitat but, being highly mobile, they may actively and constantly move into, out of and within these habitat features. Well-known beach-type models focused upon beach morphology may be more pertinent to {{the ecology of the}} <b>surf</b> <b>zones</b> offshore than previously thought, being the most consistent indicator of wrack accumulations and their fauna. This new evidence on the ecology of nearshore waters during storm versus calm weather in multiple regions and the subsequent influence on wrack-fauna associations in sandy-beach <b>surf</b> <b>zones</b> are important for future beach management, particularly when and where large wrack accumulations occur...|$|R
25|$|A sea kayak's {{primary safety}} device is its paddler. Although some kayakers {{consider}} a well-practised self-righting move {{such as an}} Eskimo roll to be essential in order to safe open-water kayaking, it is the technique of bracing that every well-trained, experienced kayaker practises {{in order to maintain}} an upright position in their kayak. Practice in bracing is often neglected by inexperienced kayakers once they have learned the Eskimo roll. However, the reality is that having to roll really means having to recover from a failed brace. Being in the capsized position in some environments due to missing a brace can put the paddler in danger of colliding with obstacles under the water. Staying upright in <b>surf</b> <b>zones,</b> rocky <b>surf</b> <b>zones</b> (informally known as rock gardens), and rivers is most important and is only accomplished through well-practised and successful bracing.|$|R

25|$|The {{driving force}} in {{littoral}} cave development is wave action. Erosion is ongoing anywhere that waves batter rocky coasts, but where sea cliffs contain zones of weakness, rock is removed at a greater rate along these zones. As the sea reaches into the fissures thus formed, they begin to widen and deepen due to the tremendous force exerted within a confined space, not only by direct action of the surf and any rock particles that it bears, but also by compression of air within. Blowholes (partially submerged caves that eject large sprays of sea water as waves retreat and allow rapid re-expansion of air compressed within) attest to this process. Adding to the hydraulic power of the waves is the abrasive force of suspended sand and rock. Most sea-cave walls are irregular and chunky, reflecting an erosional process where the rock is fractured piece by piece. However, some caves have portions where the walls are rounded and smoothed, typically floored with cobbles, and result from the swirling motion of these cobbles in the <b>surf</b> <b>zone.</b>|$|E
25|$|A notable {{exception}} to this trend are the inshore diamond diving operations {{on the west coast}} of South Africa, where hookah is still the standard equipment for diamondiferous gravel extraction in the hostile conditions of the <b>surf</b> <b>zone,</b> where the water temperature is usually around 8 to 10°C, visibility is usually low, and surge is often strong. Divers work shifts of about two hours with a crowbar and a suction hose, are heavily weighted to stay in place while working, and the standard method of ascent is to ditch the weighted harness and regulator and make a free swimming ascent. The next diver will free dive down the airline, fit the regulator and wriggle into the harness before continuing with the job. Until the South African abalone fishery was closed, hookah was the only mode of diving permitted for harvesting wild abalone, and several aspects of this practice were in direct contravention of the diving regulations at the time. Abalone divers were not allowed to have a standby diver on the boat.|$|E
