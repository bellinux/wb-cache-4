5|$|With Haku unconscious, <b>Sen</b> {{resolves}} {{to return}} the seal and apologize for Haku. Before she leaves the bathhouse, <b>Sen</b> confronts No-Face, who is now massive, and feeds him {{the rest of the}} dumpling. No-Face chases <b>Sen</b> out of the bathhouse, steadily vomiting out those he has eaten. <b>Sen,</b> No-Face and Boh travel to see Zeniba. Yubaba orders that Sen's parents be slaughtered, but Haku negotiates freedom for <b>Sen</b> and her parents after revealing that Boh is missing and offering to retrieve him. But if <b>Sen</b> fails Yubaba's final test, the deal will be broken.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sen</b> discovers paper shikigami {{attacking a}} dragon and recognizes the dragon as Haku transformed. When a grievously-injured Haku crashes into Yubaba's penthouse, <b>Sen</b> follows him upstairs. When she reaches Haku, a shikigami that stowed away {{on her back}} {{transforms}} into Zeniba, Yubaba's twin sister. She transforms Yubaba's baby son Boh into a mouse, creates a decoy baby and turns Yubaba's bird creature into a tiny bird. Zeniba tells <b>Sen</b> that Haku has stolen a magic golden seal from her, and warns <b>Sen</b> that it carries a deadly curse. After Haku dives to the boiler room with <b>Sen</b> and Boh on his back, she feeds him part of the dumpling, causing him to vomit both the seal and a black slug, which <b>Sen</b> crushes with her foot.|$|E
5|$|Born on 24 January 1981 in Kolkata, West Bengal, Riya is the {{daughter}} of Moon Moon <b>Sen,</b> a former actress, and granddaughter of Suchitra <b>Sen,</b> a legend in Bengali cinema. Before leaving for Mumbai, she lived in Kolkata with her parents and sister Raima <b>Sen,</b> also an actress. Her father Bharat Dev Varma {{is a member of the}} royal family of Tripura. Her paternal grandmother, Ila Devi, was the princess of Cooch Behar, whose younger sister Gayatri Devi was the Maharani of Jaipur. Her paternal great-grandmother Indira was the only daughter of Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III of Baroda. Riya's maternal great-grandfather Adinath <b>Sen</b> was a prominent Kolkata businessman, whose father Dinanath <b>Sen</b> – a relative of former Union Law Minister Ashoke Kumar Sen- was the Diwan or a Minister of the Maharaja of Tripura. The sisters are credited on-screen under their mother's maiden name, although their official papers carry the surname Dev Varma.|$|E

5|$|From January 1996 onwards, Ranariddh's {{relations}} with Hun <b>Sen</b> {{began to show}} signs of tension. Hun <b>Sen</b> submitted a government circular to reinstate 7 January as a national holiday, the anniversary of Phnom Penh's liberation from the Khmer Rouge by Vietnamese forces. Ranariddh added his signature to the circular, which incurred the ire of Sihanouk and several FUNCINPEC leaders. A few days later, apparently to tone down dissatisfaction from party members, Ranariddh publicly accused the Army of Vietnam of encroaching into the territories of four Cambodian provinces bordering it. As Widyono saw it, Ranariddh intended to test Hun Sen's response to his accusations, of which the latter chose to remain quiet. During a closed-door FUNCINPEC meeting in the later part of January 1996, party members criticised Hun <b>Sen</b> and the CPP for monopolizing government power, and also chided Ranariddh for being too subservient to Hun <b>Sen.</b>|$|E
5|$|However, recent {{documentary}} evidence, a Kabulatipatra dated April 1794 {{bearing the}} sign of Ramprasad <b>Sen</b> as a witness, clearly proves the fact that Ramprasad <b>Sen</b> was alive in 1794.

5|$|In October 1995, Sirivudh {{talked about}} his desire to assassinate Hun <b>Sen</b> during an {{interview}} with So Naro, who was the secretary-general of the Khmer Journalists Association. A few days later Ung Phan, a FUNCINPEC minister who had close ties with Hun <b>Sen,</b> called Sirivudh and accused him of getting involved in receiving kickbacks for printing Cambodian passports. Sirivudh angrily denied the accusations and threatened to kill Hun <b>Sen</b> over the phone. The phone conversation was recorded, and Ung Phan passed the recorded phone conversation to CPP co-minister of the interior Sar Kheng. Hun <b>Sen</b> learnt of the conversation and became enraged at Sirivudh's comments, and pressured Ranariddh and other FUNCINPEC ministers to strip his parliamentary immunity {{so that he could}} be arrested. Sirivudh was arrested and briefly placed in detention, but subsequently exiled to France when Sihanouk intervened in the case.|$|E

5|$|Relations {{between the}} two co-prime ministers, Ranariddh and Hun <b>Sen,</b> {{deteriorated}} from March 1996, when the former accused the CPP of repeatedly delaying the allocation process of low-level government posts to FUNCINPECs. Ranariddh threatened {{to pull out of}} the coalition government and hold national elections in the same year if his demands were not met, stoking unease among Hun <b>Sen</b> and other CPP officials. The following month, Sihanouk presided over a meeting between several royal family members and senior FUNCINPEC officials in Paris. Sihanouk attempted to reduce tensions between FUNCINPEC and the CPP by assuring that FUNCINPEC would not leave the coalition government and that there were no reactionary elements planning to bring down Hun <b>Sen</b> or the CPP. In March 1997 Sihanouk expressed his willingness to abdicate the throne, claiming that rising anti-royalist sentiment among the populace was threatening the monarchy's existence. In response, Hun <b>Sen</b> tersely warned Sihanouk that he would introduce constitutional amendments to prohibit members of the royal family from participating in politics if he followed through on his suggestion. As Widyono saw it, Sihanouk remained popular with the Cambodian electorate, and Hun <b>Sen</b> feared that, should he abdicate and enter politics, he would win in any future elections, thereby undercutting CPP's political clout.|$|E

50|$|Until the French Revolution, the Archbishop of <b>Sens</b> {{was also}} Viscount of <b>Sens.</b> In 1622, Paris had been {{elevated}} to a metropolitan see and the Sees of Chartres, Orléans and Meaux were {{separated from the}} Archdiocese of <b>Sens.</b> In return, the abbey of Mont Saint-Martin in the Diocese of Cambrai was united to the archiepiscopate. It was suppressed by the Napoleonic Concordat of 1802, which annexed to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Troyes the Dioceses of <b>Sens</b> and Auxerre. The somewhat complex agreement gave the title of Bishop of Auxerre to the bishops of Troyes, and the purely honorary title of Archbishop of <b>Sens</b> to the Archbishop of Paris (otherwise deprived of all jurisdiction over <b>Sens).</b> The Concordat of 1817 reestablished the Archdiocese of <b>Sens</b> and the Diocese of Auxerre, but this arrangement did not last. The law of July 1821, the pontifical brief of 4 September 1821 and the royal ordinance of 19 October 1821 suppressed the Diocese of Auxerre and gave to the Archdiocese of <b>Sens</b> the Department of the Yonne and the Dioceses of Troyes, Nevers and Moulins. A papal brief of 3 June 1823 gave to the Archbishop of <b>Sens</b> the title of Bishop of Auxerre. The Archbishop of <b>Sens</b> continued to reside at <b>Sens</b> until the 1920s, but is now resident at Auxerre.
