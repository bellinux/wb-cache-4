5|$|Ulrika Eleonora (the elder) was sickly, and {{the many}} child births {{eventually}} broke her. When she became seriously ill, in 1693, Charles finally dedicated his time and care to her. Her death in July that year <b>shook</b> <b>him</b> deeply and he never fully recovered. Her infant son Ulric (1684–1685) had been given Ulriksdal Palace, which was renamed for him (Ulric's Dale).|$|E
25|$|His {{indifference}} to Jewish issues changed {{when he met}} Peter Bergson, who was drumming up American assistance for the Zionist group Irgun. Hecht wrote in his book, Perfidy, {{that he used to}} be a scriptwriter until his meeting with Bergson, when he accidentally bumped into history - i.e. the burning need to do anything possible to save the doomed Jews of Europe (paraphrase from Perfidy). As Hecht relates it in Child of the Century, he didn't feel particularly Jewish in his daily life until Bergson <b>shook</b> <b>him</b> out of his assimilated complacency: Bergson invited Hecht to ask three close friends whether, in their opinion, Hecht was an American or a Jew. All three replied that he was a Jew, Hecht says.|$|E
500|$|Kennedy {{learned of}} the deaths on the {{following}} morning when National Security Council staffer Michael Forrestal rushed into the cabinet room with a telegram reporting the Ngô brothers' alleged suicides. According to General Maxwell Taylor, [...] "Kennedy leaped {{to his feet and}} rushed from the room with a look of shock and dismay on his face which I had never seen before." [...] Kennedy had planned that Ngô Đình Diệm would be safely exiled and Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. recalled that the US President was [...] "somber and shaken". Kennedy later penned a memo, lamenting that the assassination was [...] "particularly abhorrent" [...] and blaming himself for approving Cable 243, which had authorised Lodge to explore coup options in the wake of Nhu's attacks on the Buddhist pagodas. Forrestal said that [...] "It <b>shook</b> <b>him</b> personally ... bothered him as a moral and religious matter. It shook his confidence, I think, in the kind of advice he was getting about South Vietnam." [...] When Kennedy was consoled by a friend who told him he need not feel sorry for the Ngô brothers on the grounds of despotism, Kennedy replied [...] "No. They were in a difficult position. They did the best they could for their country." ...|$|E

500|$|When Philomena Goins Doctor {{found out}} what her son had done, she became enraged and {{threatened}} to disown him, <b>shook</b> <b>him,</b> then slapped him. A year later, Moore took the story to CBS' 60 Minutes, and was the background reporter on a piece produced by Joel Bernstein and narrated by African-American journalist Ed Bradley. Philomena Doctor called her family members and declared Moore's story and Bradley's television exposé were full of lies. A psychologist at the University of Florida later testified in state hearings that the survivors of Rosewood showed signs of posttraumatic stress disorder, made worse by the secrecy. Many years after the incident, they exhibited fear, denial, and hypervigilance about socializing with whites—which they expressed specifically regarding their children, interspersed with bouts of apathy. Despite such characteristics, survivors counted religious faith as integral to their lives following the attack in Rosewood, {{to keep them from}} becoming bitter. [...] Michael D'Orso, who wrote a book about Rosewood, said, [...] "veryone told me in their own way, in their own words, that if they allowed themselves to be bitter, to hate, it would have eaten them up." [...] Robie Mortin described her past this way: [...] "I knew that something went very wrong in my life because it took a lot away from me. But I wasn't angry or anything." ...|$|E
500|$|A month later, on 1 January 1907, Cardiff played hosts to the South Africans {{and beat}} the {{visitors}} 17–0 in front of 30,000 spectators. Heavy rain turned the ground into a [...] "quagmire", and a strong wind blew {{from one end to}} the other. Cardiff won the toss and opted to play with the wind. Williams' first touch of the ball was erratic, failing to hold on to a catch in the initial stages, when he had a clear run to the tryline. After Cardiff had scored two tries in the first half with no response from the Springboks, Williams had another chance to score, but again fumbled the ball. At half time, Cardiff was leading by 11 points, already the largest score against the South Africans in any of the tour matches. Well into the second half, Williams received a pass from Rhys Gabe. Between him and the tryline was Marsberg, the opposition fullback, and [...] "one of the most magnificent tacklers" [...] to have played in Wales. Williams approached Marsberg and, with a swerving run, [...] "diddled" [...] him, and scored a try in the corner. Marsberg then ran up to him and <b>shook</b> <b>him</b> by the hand in recognition of the move. The contemporary rugby journalist E. H. D. Sewell commented that the try he scored [...] "against the South Africans for Cardiff will never be forgotten by those that witnessed it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Later, however, upon {{meeting with}} the artist at a gallery, Stein's {{attitude}} had apparently changed: [...] "..ah I said catching him by the lapels of his coat and shaking him.[...].'it is all right you are doing this {{to get rid of}} everything that has been too much for you all right all right go on doing it but don't go on trying to make me tell you it is poetry' and I <b>shook</b> <b>him</b> again." ...|$|E

2500|$|Writing of his father, John Nyren says he [...] "never saw a finer {{specimen}} of the thoroughbred old English yeoman than Richard Nyren", who was [...] "a good face-to-face, unflinching, uncompromising, independent man". Nyren's response to Powlett and Dehaney in 1775 {{is consistent with}} this description. He would stand his ground even when disagreement arose with such luminaries as the major patrons John Frederick Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset, and Sir Horatio Mann. On one occasion, when Nyren had been proved right, Mann [...] "crossed the ground and (<b>shook)</b> <b>him</b> heartily by the hand". Although, as Underdown points out, the Duke perhaps did not.|$|E
2500|$|Junoon {{formed in}} 1990 when Salman Ahmad, founder, {{songwriter}} and lead guitarist, {{had a dream}} where one of his teachers <b>shook</b> <b>him</b> and said [...] "Tumhey mousiqui ka Junoon hai!" [...] (You have an obsession for music!). Junoon were not an overnight success; the band members struggled {{for the first few}} years. Their self-titled debut album, Junoon, recorded at the EMI Studios in Karachi barely made a dent in the Pakistani music industry when released in September 1991. After the release of their debut album, Nusrat Hussain parted ways with the band to pursue his own career as a solo singer and went on to release his debut solo album Amrit in 1992.|$|E

O’Connell left the Advance about 6 o'clock in company with the mate, and returned about half past 12 on Sunday afternoon alone. He went forward {{and saw that the}} scuttle leading to the forecastle, and which was closed when he left, was open the other hatches were still closed; he looked into the forecastle and saw the deceased sitting on a seat with his body bent forward and his head resting on the opposite seat there was a smell of charcoal coming up out of the scuttle, he thought deceased was drunk, he spoke to him, but got not reply he <b>shook</b> <b>him,</b> but could not awake him, and found that he was dead.|$|E

2500|$|During the 1987 general election, Tebbit and Saatchi & Saatchi {{spearheaded the}} Conservative campaign, {{focusing}} {{on the economy and}} defence. However, when on 'Wobbly Thursday' it was rumoured a Marplan opinion poll showed a 2% Conservative lead, the 'exiles' camp of David Young, Tim Bell and the Young and Rubicam firm advocated a more aggressively anti-Labour message. This was when, according to Young's memoirs, Young got Tebbit by the lapels and <b>shook</b> <b>him,</b> shouting: [...] "Norman, listen to me, we're about to lose this fucking election". In his memoirs Tebbit defends the Conservative campaign: [...] "We finished exactly as planned on the ground where Labour was weak and we were strong—defence, taxation, and the economy". During the election campaign however Tebbit and Thatcher argued. Tebbit had already informed Thatcher {{at the beginning of the}} campaign that he would leave the government after the election to care for his wife.|$|E
2500|$|The message (and its {{trailing}} padding) became famous, {{and created}} some ill feeling, since {{it appeared to}} be a harsh criticism by Nimitz of Halsey's decision to pursue the decoy carriers and leave the landings uncovered. [...] "I was stunned as if I had been struck in the face", Halsey later recalled. [...] "The paper rattled in my hands, I snatched off my cap, threw it on the deck, and shouted something I am ashamed to remember", letting out an anguished sob. RADM Robert Carney, Halsey's chief of staff (who had argued strongly in favor of pursuing the carriers), witnessed Halsey's emotional outburst and reportedly grabbed him by the shoulders and <b>shook</b> <b>him,</b> shouting, [...] "Stop it! What the hell's the matter with you? Pull yourself together!" [...] Recognizing his failure, Halsey sulked in inactivity for a full hour while Taffy 3 was fighting for its lifefalsely claiming to be refueling his shipsbefore eventually turning around with his two fastest battleships, three light cruisers and eight destroyers and heading back to Samar, too late to have any impact on the battle.|$|E
2500|$|Second Army's XXX Corps (now {{commanded}} by Lieutenant General Brian Horrocks) {{took part in}} Operation Market Garden, the failed attempt to secure an early crossing of the River Rhine in September 1944, which Dempsey believed could not succeed and openly questioned to Montgomery. Airborne troops secured a succession of canal and river crossings to enable XXX Corps to reach the Lower Rhine at Arnhem and wheel right into Germany. Intelligence had not detected the presence of unexpected German formations {{in the area and}} resistance proved greater than expected frustrating XXX Corps attempts to reach its final objective. During the operation, Dempsey, forward near the front with his Tac HQ, witnessed the crossing of the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division's 504th Parachute Regiment cross the Nijmegen bridge. Impressed, he later wrote that the 82nd was [...] "easily the best division on the Western front". Dempsey met with the 82nd's commander, Brigadier General James M. Gavin, <b>shook</b> <b>him</b> by the hand and said [...] "I am proud to meet the commander of the greatest division in the world today." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bruno {{took the}} fight to Lewis, but Lewis won the first round. Bruno then went on the {{offensive}} and took the second round, with Lewis trying to use his left jab to win points. Bruno hit Lewis {{on the right of}} his head in the third round, which <b>shook</b> <b>him.</b> Lewis later said that [...] "It didn't hurt me", but the punch concentrated Lewis' efforts on the job in hand. At the end of the sixth round, both Castellano and Roth had the fight level at 57–57, with Morgan scoring the fight 59–55 in favour of Bruno. At the start of the seventh round Bruno hit Lewis with a left jab and continued with a series of short punches. Lewis said [...] "He thought he had me... but actually I just lost my footing. I saw every punch coming". Lewis then hit Bruno with a looping left hook which staggered him, and continued with a series of head punches. Lewis said [...] "I saw him drop his right hand and just came out with my left hook". In a momentary break during the onslaught, Lewis was warned by Vann for stiff-arming with his left hand. Upon resuming Lewis finished off Bruno, who was by then staggering on unsteady legs and completely unable to defend himself. Vann stopped the fight one minute and twelve seconds into the seventh round.|$|E
