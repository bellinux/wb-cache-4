25|$|When {{the body}} is {{expending}} more energy than it is consuming (e.g. when exercising), the body's cells rely on internally <b>stored</b> <b>energy</b> <b>sources,</b> such as complex carbohydrates and fats, for energy. The first source to which the body turns is glycogen (by glycogenolysis). Glycogen is a complex carbohydrate, 65% of which is stored in skeletal muscles and the remainder in the liver (totaling about 2,000 kcal in the whole body). It is created from the excess of ingested macronutrients, mainly carbohydrates. When glycogen is nearly depleted, the body begins lipolysis, the mobilization and catabolism of fat stores for energy. In this process, fats, obtained from adipose tissue, or fat cells, are broken down into glycerol and fatty acids, {{which can be used}} to generate energy. The primary by-products of metabolism are carbon dioxide and water; carbon dioxide is expelled through the respiratory system.|$|E
5000|$|The South Col {{was first}} reached by Edouard Wyss-Dunant's 1952 Swiss Mount Everest Expedition {{that failed to}} reach the summit. The {{following}} year, when Mount Everest was first climbed, Wilfrid Noyce and the Sherpa Annullu were the first climbers on the expedition to reach the col. According to John Hunt, the expedition leader: It was 2.40 p.m. Wilfrid Noyce and his companion Annullu stood at that moment above the South Col of Everest, at about [...] They were gazing down on {{the scene of the}} Swiss drama, and they were also looking upwards to the final pyramid of Everest itself. It was a great moment for them both, and it was shared by all of us who watched it. Their presence there was symbolic of our success in overcoming the most crucial problem of the whole climb; they had reached an objective which we had been striving to attain for twelve anxious days. Once on the South Col, climbers have entered the death zone [...] - [...] Altitude sickness is a significant threat at this elevation and can easily prove fatal. It is also difficult to sleep, and most climbers' digestive systems have significantly slowed or completely stopped. This is because it is more efficient at this altitude for the body to use <b>stored</b> <b>energy</b> <b>sources</b> than to digest new food. Most climbers will begin using supplemental oxygen here and have a maximum of only two or three days for making summit bids. Clear weather and low winds are critical factors in deciding whether to make a summit attempt. If weather does not cooperate within these short few days, climbers are forced to descend, many all the way back down to Base Camp. Climbers rarely get a second chance to return to the South Col in a specific expedition.|$|E
40|$|With {{the arrival}} of smart grid era {{and the advent of}} {{advanced}} communication and information infrastructures, bidirectional communication, advanced metering infrastructure, energy storage systems and home area networks would revolutionize the patterns of electricity usage and energy conservation at the consumption premises. Coupled with the emergence of vehicle-to-grid technologies and massive distributed renewable energy, there is a profound transition for the energy management pattern from the conventional centralized infrastructure towards the autonomous responsive demand and cyber-physical energy systems with renewable and <b>stored</b> <b>energy</b> <b>sources.</b> Under the sustainable smart grid paradigm, the smart house with its home energy management system (HEMS) plays an important role to improve the efficiency, economics, reliability, and energy conservation for distribution systems. In this paper, a brief overview on the architecture and functional modules of smart HEMS is presented. Then, the advanced HEMS infrastructures and home appliances in smart houses are thoroughly analyzed and reviewed. Furthermore, the utilization of various building renewable energy resources in HEMS, including solar, wind, biomass and geothermal energies, is surveyed.

50|$|The Antarctic {{toothfish}} has a lightweight, partially cartilaginous skeleton, lacks a swim bladder, and has fatty deposits which {{act as a}} <b>stored</b> <b>energy</b> <b>source,</b> {{particularly during}} spawning. This fat also makes large toothfish neutrally buoyant. Many toothfish caught over the seamounts are very depleted of fat, and this is thought perhaps {{to be related to}} spawning and spawning migration, which are energy-demanding activities. It is not known what happens to these fat-depleted fish, including whether they reach, or how long it takes them to reach, breeding condition again; this ostensibly occurs upon returning to continental slope waters. Antarctic toothfish have vision and lateral line systems well adapted to find prey in low light levels. Since ice covers the surface of the ocean where Antarctic toothfish occur even in summer, these sensory specializations likely evolved to enable survival in the reduced light levels found under ice and in the Antarctic winter, as well as at deep depths. Antarctic toothfish also have a very well developed sense of smell, which is why they are easily caught by baited hooks and also scavenge the remains of penguins killed by other predators.|$|R

40|$|In January 1994, DOE {{terminated}} the Integral Fast Reactor (IFR) Program. Argonne National Laboratory-West (ANL-W) {{prepared a}} detailed plan to put Experimental Breeder Reactor-II (EBR-II) {{in a safe}} condition, including removal of irradiated fueled subassemblies from the plant, transfer of subassemblies, and removal and stabilization of primary and secondary sodium liquid heat transfer metal. The goal of deactivation is to stabilize the EBR-II complex until decontamination and decommissioning (D&D) is implemented, thereby minimizing maintenance and surveillance. Deactivation of a sodium cooled reactor presents unique concerns. Residual sodium in the primary and secondary systems must be either reacted or inerted to preclude concerns with explosive sodium-air reactions. Also, residual sodium on components will effectively solder these items in place, making removal unfeasible. Several special cases reside in the primary system, including primary cold traps, a cesium trap, a cover gas condenser, and systems containing sodium-potassium alloy. The sodium or sodium-potassium alloy in these components must be reacted in place or the components removed. The Sodium Components Maintenance Shop at ANL-W provides the capability for washing primary components, removing residual quantities of sodium while providing some decontamination capacity.

40|$|Food {{production}} and energy are undoubtedly interlinked. However, at present food production depends {{almost exclusively on}} direct use of <b>stored</b> <b>energy</b> <b>sources,</b> may they be nuclear-, petroleum- or bio-based. Furthermore, non-storage based “renewable” energy systems, like wind and solar, need development before bering able to contribute at a significant level. This presentation will point towards surplus heat {{as a way to}} bridge the gap between today’s food systems and truly sustainable ones, suitable to be performed in urban and peri-urban areas. Considering that arable land and fresh water resources are the base for our present food systems, but are limited, in combination with continued urbanisation, such solutions are urgently needed. By combining the use of surplus energy with harvest of society’s organic side flows, like e. g. food waste and aquatic based cash crops, truly sustainable and urban close food systems are possible at a level of significance also for global food security. In order to bring this work forward a site and scale specific optimisation model is needed and will be discussed at the presentation. ESS with its expertise in physics and system analysis and located in the middle of Scandinavia's most expansive urbanisation and its most productive bread basket area is a most interesting place to also host a centre of expertise in the interconnection between surplus energy and nutrient recycling. A centre with the ultimate aim to produce knowledge allowing implementation of healthy and environmentally friendly food systems not dependent on large areas of arable land and huge quantities of fresh water, suitable also for urban and peri-urban locations. ESS will require approximately 250 GWh of power per year to operate, power that ultimately is converted to heat. With innovative cooling solutions, a third of the captured heat will be high-temperature and can be sold as district heating, supplying a significant portion of the heating needs in the City of Lund. Further innovation is required for the remaining two thirds of the heat produced. This heat could be augmented with heat pumps, but at the price of a significantly increased use of electricity. This presentation will bring forward an alternative food production cooling chain, involving fermentation, aquaculture and greenhouse horticulture including both use of low grade surplus heat and recycle societies organic waste as animal feed and manure based fertilizers. The development of such system will demand trans-disciplinary collaboration between physics and biology. The presentation will show the biological processes involved...|$|E
