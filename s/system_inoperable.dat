500|$|The film {{presents}} a legal system where the PreCrime office gathers the {{images from the}} minds of the precogs then organizes them into a coherent order for display in front of a set of judges. The judges appear via video feeds, analyze the images, and according to Cooper, they view the images, listen to Anderton rattle off [...] "a string of legalistic verbiage", then give it a [...] "pro forma ratification." [...] Thus the accused is never present, is not allowed a defense, and is convicted before he is aware he is on trial. The program is marketed in a similar basic fashion, as in its tag line: [...] "It works." [...] Cooper says that in a typical American courtroom drama, the audience is treated {{as if it were the}} jury, but in this system, instead of desiring the hero be proven innocent, the audience seeks instead to have the guilt transferred from Anderton to Burgess. But to do so, Anderton has to disprove the system, which he does by proving the existence of the minority report. This renders the PreCrime justice <b>system</b> <b>inoperable,</b> as if there is doubt related not merely to the gathering of the images, or their ability to be interpreted, but their ability to be correct even in perfect circumstances, then the system of infallible guilt can not exist.|$|E

50|$|This fourth American {{attempt at}} lunar impact {{was the closest}} success.

The Block III spacecraft carried a 173-kilogram TV unit (replacing the impact capsule carried on the Block II Ranger spacecraft). The six cameras included two full-scan and four partial-scan cameras. Ranger 6 flew to the Moon successfully and impacted precisely on schedule at 09:24:32 UT on 2 February. Unfortunately, the power supply for the TV camera package had short-circuited three days previously during Atlas booster separation and left the <b>system</b> <b>inoperable.</b> The cameras were to have transmitted high-resolution photos of the lunar approach from 1,448 kilometers to 6.4 kilometers range in support of Project Apollo.

50|$|Yet {{another way}} to {{navigate}} a cruise missile is by using a satellite positioning system, such as GPS or GLONASS. Satellite navigation systems are precise and cheap. Unfortunately, they rely on satellites. If the satellites are interfered with (e.g. destroyed) or if the satellite signal is interfered with (e.g. jammed), the satellite navigation <b>system</b> becomes <b>inoperable.</b> Therefore, the GPS-based (or GLONASS-based) navigation is useful in a conflict with a technologically unsophisticated adversary.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{sensitivity}} of real-time systems running applications under operating systems that are subject to soft-errors. A procedure for characterizing the soft error susceptibility of nodes in a logic circuit, and a heuristic procedure for selecting the set of nodes for partial duplication are described. Third, the correctness of embedded systems is currently jeopardized by soft errors that may render control <b>systems</b> <b>inoperable.</b> In general, soft errors are increasingly a problem due to smaller fabrication sizes and deployment in harsh environments. A full set of experimental results demonstrate the cost-effective tradeoffs that can be achieved. First, architects must understand the impact of soft errors on their designs. Second, they must select judiciously from among available techniques to reduce this impact {{in order to meet}} their reliability targets with minimum overhead Two reduction heuristics, cluster sharing reduction and dominant value reduction, are used to reduce the soft error failure rate significantly with a fraction of the overhead required for conventional TMR. However, FPGA’s vulnerability to hard and soft errors is a major weakness to robust configurable system design. To eliminate the soft memory errors that are induced by cosmic rays, memory manufacturers must either produce designs that can resist cosmic ray effects or else invent mechanisms to detect and correct the errors.

40|$|This paper {{highlights}} two {{shortcomings in}} the current design process of embedded systems of avionics. First, the current software design process does not adequately verify and validate worst-case timing scenarios {{that have to be}} guaranteed in order to meet deadlines. Consider the RTCA DO- 178 B standard requiring coverage testing. An additional requirement, namely predictable timing behavior, is essential real-time embedded systems. Airbus requires their suppliers to provide verifiable bounds on worst-case execution time of software for planes under development, Boeing is considering it (e. g., for Airbus 380, Boeing 787 and military aircraft). The automotive industry, among others, is evaluating similar requirements. We provide an analysis of this problem that outlines directions for future research and tool development in this area. Second, the correctness of embedded systems is currently jeopardized by soft errors that may render control <b>systems</b> <b>inoperable.</b> In general, transient faults are increasingly a problem due to (a) smaller fabrication sizes and (b) deployment in harsh environments. In commercial aviation, the next-generation planes (Airbus 380 and Boeing 787) will deploy off-the-shelf embedded processors without hardware protection against soft errors. Since these planes are designed to fly over the North Pole with an order of magnitude higher radiation (due to a thinner atmosphere), system developers have been asked to consider the effect of single-event upsets (SEUs), i. e., infrequent single bit-flips, in their software design. Current developers {{do not know how to}} address this problem. We outline much needed research in this area...|$|R
50|$|Deviations {{from that}} {{original}} plan {{should be made}} known to the AHJ {{to make sure that}} the change is still in compliance with the law to prevent any unsafe conditions that may violate the law and put people at risk. For example, if the firestop systems in a structure were inoperable, a significant part of the fire safety plan might be compromised in the event of a fire because the walls and floors that contain the firestops are intended to have a fire-resistance rating. Likewise, if the sprinkler system or fire alarm <b>system</b> is <b>inoperable</b> for lack of proper maintenance, the likelihood of damage or personal injury is increased.|$|R

40|$|Control {{reconfiguration}} {{changes the}} control structure {{in response to}} a fault detected in the plant. This becomes necessary, because a major fault like loss of an actuator breaks the corresponding control loop and therefore renders the whole <b>system</b> <b>inoperable.</b> An important aim of control reconfiguration is to change the control structure as little as possible, since every change bears the potential of practical problems. The proposed solution is to keep the original controller in the loop and to add an extension called virtual actuator that implements the necessary changes of the control structure. The virtual actuator translates between the signals of the nominal controller and the signal of the faulty plants. This paper is concerned with the analysis of reconfigured loop with a virtual actuator for the system with the faulty actuator. The proposed analysis is illustrated on numerical example...|$|E
