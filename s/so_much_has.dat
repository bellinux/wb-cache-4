However much wildlife does remain in the rice fields and steps may be taken to preserve these as urban and industrial development on the plains is ongoing and the Industrial Estate Authority of Thailand has very little control or planning over this. Particular threats come from the conversion of rice paddies to large-scale production of prawns by pumping in seawater, {{and the use of}} pesticides to eliminate the introduced snail,Pomacea canaliculata, which damages rice plants.|$|E
500|$|Spiegelman, {{like many}} of his critics, worries that [...] "eality is too much for comics... <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>has</b> to be left out or distorted", admitting that his {{presentation}} of the story may not be accurate. [...] He takes a postmodern approach; Maus [...] "feeds on itself", telling the story of how the story was made. It examines the choices Spiegelman made in the retelling of his father's memories, and the artistic choices he had to make—for example, when his French wife converts to Judaism, Spiegelman's character frets over whether to depict her as a frog, a mouse, or another animal.|$|E

2500|$|Philip Stewart Robinson was a {{traveling}} journalist for the Telegraph of London. [...] In his [...] "Sinners and Saints", he notes [...] "I {{had expected to}} see men with long whips, sitting on fences, swearing at their gangs of wives {{at work in the}} fields. I expected every now and then to hear of druniken saints beating seven or eight wives all at once," [...] but found no such thing. [...] While continuing to disagree with the practice of polygamy, he found that Utah-born girls, the offspring of plural wives, have figures that would make Paris envious; and they carry themselves with almost oriental dignity. There is nothing, so far as I have seen, in the manners of Salt Lake City to make me suspect the existence of that licentiousness of which <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>has</b> been written. He believed that the negative representations of Mormons came universally [...] "rom anti-Mormons only".|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, the United States-based Kabbalah Center and the Palestinian Abu Assukar Center for Peace and Dialogue {{organized}} a children's camp for 115 Israeli children and 115 Palestinian children aged 8 to 12 {{to take place}} near Tel Aviv at the Ramat Gan Safari Park. The camp, which lasted for four days, involved children from Bethlehem, Ramallah, East Jerusalem, Tulkarem, Jericho, and Jenin. The Israeli children involved were mostly those who came from severe poverty and violent backgrounds. Joint-organizer Osnat Youdkevitch remarked that, [...] "Our message is that of dignity for all human beings. It's harder for adults to fully understand, since <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>has</b> already been built up around us, but kids {{have the chance to}} grow up thinking in a healthier way. If you play, eat and sweat for four days with a group of other kids who are supposed to be the 'enemy', it will stay in your heart forever." ...|$|E

[...] He added that, [...] "I remember that {{in the first half of}} that Test match at Christchurch, Roger Gould had a kick charged down and I went to pick it up one-handed...and knocked on. In a Test match! Then, in the second half, we got the ball and ran it from our own line. Gould gave me the ball and there was no one in front of me except Allan Hewson, the All Black full-back. I tried to change hands and dropped the ball. Maybe I have always been a bit that way; unpredictable to the end." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{report states}} that some left-wing activists and Muslim extremists are using {{criticism}} of Israel as a [...] "pretext" [...] for antisemitism, {{and that the}} [...] "most worrying discovery" [...] is that antisemitism appears to be entering the mainstream. It argues that anti-Zionism may become antisemitic when it adopts a view of Zionism as a [...] "global force of unlimited power and malevolence throughout history," [...] a definition that [...] "bears {{no relation to the}} understanding that most Jews have of the concept: that is, a movement of Jewish national liberation ..." [...] Having re-defined Zionism, the report states, traditional antisemitic motifs of Jewish [...] "conspiratorial power, manipulation and subversion" [...] are often transferred from Jews onto Zionism. The report notes that this is [...] "at the core of the 'New Antisemitism', on which <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>has</b> been written," [...] adding that many of those who gave evidence called anti-Zionism [...] "the lingua franca of antisemitic movements." ...|$|E
2500|$|Treasury {{officials}} {{complained that}} the building cost too much to maintain; some suggested that it be razed and a new house constructed on the site or elsewhere. In 1782, the Board of Works, reporting on [...] "the dangerous state of the old part of the House", stated that [...] "no time be lost in taking down said building". In 1783, the Duke of Portland moved out because it was once again in need of repair. A committee found that the money spent so far was insufficient. This time the Board of Works declared that [...] "the Repairs, Alterations & Additions at the Chancellor of the Exchequer's House will amount to the sum of £5,580, exclusive of the sum for which they already have His Majesty's Warrant. And praying a Warrant for the said sum of £5,580—and also praying an Imprest of that sum {{to enable them to}} pay the Workmen". This proved to be a gross underestimate; the final bill was over £11,000. The Morning Herald fumed about the expense: [...] "£500pounds p.a. preceding the Great Repair, and £11,000 the Great Repair itself! <b>So</b> <b>much</b> <b>has</b> this extraordinary edifice cost the country – For one moiety [...] of the sum a much better dwelling might have been purchased!"

60|$|When Emmanuel {{had taken}} him and bound him in chains, he led him into the marketplace, and there, before Mansoul, {{stripped}} him of his armour in which he boasted <b>so</b> <b>much</b> before.
