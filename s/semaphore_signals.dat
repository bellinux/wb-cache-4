5|$|While {{the power}} station was being built, the District {{electrified}} the Ealing to Harrow line {{that was not}} yet open. It was equipped with automatic signalling using track circuits and pneumatic <b>semaphore</b> <b>signals,</b> and trials were run with two seven car trains. In August 1903, an order was placed for 420 cars and a new maintenance depot was built west of Mill Hill Park (now Acton Town).|$|E
5|$|Below the locks, a five-arched red {{sandstone}} viaduct, {{constructed in}} 1837, crosses the valley. It {{was built by}} Joseph Locke, and carried the Grand Junction Railway. Hunt's locks also consist of a pair, the smaller one from the 1860s and the larger one, with three sets of gates, from the 1890s. Steel <b>semaphore</b> <b>signals</b> control access to the locks, and again {{the movement of the}} gates employs a Pelton turbine. The weir to the east of the locks has a walkway supported by rusticated piers and five cast iron arches, which also support the floodgates. The structure is Baroque in style.|$|E
5|$|Also {{on display}} is a burden basket created by basketmaker Sophie George {{in the design}} of the baskets used by the Kalapuya, the Native American tribe that {{formerly}} inhabited the Tualatin Valley. As few members of the Kalapuya remain and none had the knowledge of how to make the basket, George visited the British Museum to find an example of a basket in order to design the replica. A bronze cast was created and is displayed at Hillsboro Central. The station also includes a weather vane, one of a series of eight on the Westside MAX. Designed by Keith Jellum and located on the roof of the station building, the vane resembles old train signals. Constructed of bronze, the <b>semaphore</b> <b>signals</b> stop and approach.|$|E

5|$|<b>Semaphore</b> <b>signals</b> {{were used}} on the very first railway lines, but only a bare minimum were {{provided}} as the time interval system being relied upon instead. The first interlocking of signals to protect trains was provided in 1874, as before this time conflicting moves could be made. The design of the signals also progressed, with the disc type siding signals first introduced in 1885, and the lower quadrant somersault type main line signals adopted in 1887, {{both of which are}} still in use today. Green was not adopted as the All Right colour until 1898, with white being used before this time. Red was the usual colour of all signal arms, until yellow was chosen as the colour for distant signals in 1926, with full adoption made in 1930. Colour light signals first appeared in 1918, and by 1924 they were the standard for new installations.|$|E

25|$|The {{line was}} {{controlled}} by traditional <b>semaphore</b> <b>signals</b> until at least 1990, later than the adjacent main line.

25|$|During the 1870s, {{almost all}} the British railway {{companies}} standardised {{on the use of}} <b>semaphore</b> <b>signals,</b> which were then invariably of the lower quadrant type. From the 1920s onwards, upper quadrant semaphores almost totally supplanted lower quadrant signals in Great Britain, except on former GWR lines.|$|E
25|$|PRR {{was one of}} {{the first}} railroads to replace <b>semaphore</b> <b>signals</b> with position-light signals. Such signals, which {{featured}} a large round target with up to eight amber-colored lights in a circle and one in the center, could be lit in various patterns to convey different meanings, were more visible in fog, and remained effective even when one light in a row was inoperative.|$|E

25|$|The resignalling {{scheme of}} 1938 {{introduced}} three aspect colour signals {{to replace the}} original <b>semaphore</b> <b>signals.</b> A new signal box was constructed and opened on 15 May 1938. It {{is one of many}} built in the Odeon style by the Southern Railway during the 1930s. The original frame was an A2 type Westinghouse with 44 levers. The box controls the line from Box Hill & Westhumble to Warnham.|$|E
25|$|The Northâ€“South Railway line uses a {{semi-automatic}} block system, {{which allows}} individual signals to work either as automatic signals or manual signals. These replace the token method used in earlier years. According {{to a joint}} Japanese-Vietnamese evaluation team, the recent installation of additional auto-signal systems at key crossings along the line has contributed {{to a decline in}} railway accidents. <b>Semaphore</b> <b>signals</b> were once used throughout the Vietnamese rail network, but these are gradually being replaced with colour light signals; most of the railway lines in northern Vietnam have been converted.|$|E
25|$|Telegraphy {{requires}} that the method used for encoding the message be known to both sender and receiver. Many methods are designed according {{to the limits of}} the signalling medium used. The use of smoke signals, beacons, reflected light signals, and flag <b>semaphore</b> <b>signals</b> are early examples. In the 19th century, the harnessing of electricity led to the invention of electrical telegraphy. The advent of radio in the early 20th century brought about radiotelegraphy and other forms of wireless telegraphy. In the Internet age, telegraphic means developed greatly in sophistication and ease of use, with natural language interfaces that hide the underlying code, allowing such technologies as electronic mail and instant messaging.|$|E

5000|$|Immediately {{south of}} the station is Bingley Tunnel ( [...] long) against which a <b>semaphore</b> <b>signal</b> was placed for {{movements}} towards Shipley. When the line was electrified in 1995, the <b>semaphore</b> <b>signalling</b> was replaced with colour lights at the same time. The tunnel mouth at Bingley had a painted white patch on it directly behind the sempahore's arm, thereby allowing greater recognition for drivers of the signal's position. , the patch {{is still on the}} tunnel's outer wall.|$|R
25|$|In 1955, {{with the}} opening of the Rimutaka Tunnel and deviation, a Centralised Traffic Control system was {{installed}} at Upper Hutt station to control main line points and signals between Trentham and Featherston inclusive. However, only one crossover (18) and four signals (8, 23, 23A and 29) at Trentham could be controlled from Upper Hutt; the remainder, which were typically only used on race days at the adjacent Trentham Racecourse, were controlled by a panel at Trentham itself. The <b>semaphore</b> <b>signals</b> were replaced with three-colour searchlight signals. On 6 February 2007, the Upper Hutt signal box was decommissioned and control of the line from Trentham to Featherston was moved to Train Control in central Wellington.|$|E
25|$|During the First World War Richardson, in his {{position}} as Chief Constable, issued instructions about introducing, the Keep Left Rule, Traffic Signals and the Police Identity Parade. All motor and horse drawn traffic must drive on the Left hand side of the road. This was mandatory and not optional. Coloured lights at busy road junctions were introduced into Halifax, {{being one of the}} first Boroughs to do so. There were two lights for each road, one red for Danger (red as it was considered to be the best colour to penetrate fog and haze) and green for Go. These two colours were used by the railways and instantly recognizable by the population. They were attached to tram poles and hand operated by a Constable. This is thought to be possibly one of the first uses of traffic lights in the country. London had used <b>semaphore</b> <b>signals,</b> the first sited at Charing Cross, but they were never considered to be effective.|$|E
500|$|More {{conventional}} <b>semaphore</b> <b>signals</b> {{replaced the}} discs and crossbars over time. The GWR persisted {{with the lower}} quadrant form, where a [...] "proceed" [...] aspect is indicated by lowering the signal arm, despite other British railways changing to an upper quadrant form. Electric light signals of the [...] "searchlight" [...] pattern were later introduced at busy stations; these could show the same red/green or yellow/green aspects that <b>semaphore</b> <b>signals</b> showed at night. An [...] "automatic train control" [...] system was introduced from 1906 which was a safety system that applied a train's brakes if it passed a danger signal.|$|E
