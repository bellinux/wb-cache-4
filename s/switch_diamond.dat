50|$|Although not {{strictly}} speaking a turnout, a <b>switch</b> <b>diamond</b> {{is an active}} trackwork assembly used where the crossing angle between two tracks is too shallow for totally passive trackwork: the unguided sections of each rail would overlap. These vaguely resemble two standard points assembled very closely toe-to-toe. These would also often utilise swingnose crossings at the outer ends to ensure complete wheel support {{in the same way}} as provided on shallow angle turnouts. In North America these are known as Movable-Point Diamonds. In the UK, where the angle of divergence is shallower than 1 in 8 (center-line measure) a switched diamond will be found rather than a passive or fixed diamond.|$|E

40|$|A highly {{available}} {{infrastructure is}} a premise for a capable railway operation of high quality. Therefore maintenance is necessary. Especially switches are critical because they connect different tracks and allow {{a train to}} change its moving direction without stopping.

The Institute of Transportation Systems, in cooperation with the German Railways (DB AG) is exploring ways to monitor the condition of switches and their degradation process to reduce failures and thus maintenance costs.

But such sensors are expensive. Hence huge investments would have to be made if the current 71 000 <b>switches</b> and <b>diamond</b> crossings of German Railways would be equipped.

The results show that with an increase of internal pressure, the deformation mode <b>switches</b> from <b>diamond</b> mode with sharp corners to that with round corners, and eventually to ring mode. in diamond mode, the mean force of the tubes increases linearly with internal pressure.

This concept shines a light {{on the possibility of}} achieving adaptive energy absorption. To investigate the effect of the internal pressure on the response of the structures under impact loadings, the present paper reports our study on the axial crushing behavior of pressurized thin-walled circular tubes. Three groups of thin-walled circular tubes with the radius/thickness ratio between 120 and 200 were employed in the experiments and two working modes were studied: mode-I (with constant internal pressure) and mode-II (closed tubes with finite leakage). In the tests of mode-I, the influences of internal pressure on the deformation mode and energy absorption of the tubes were investigated. The results show that with the increase of internal pressure, the deformation mode <b>switches</b> from <b>diamond</b> mode with sharp corners to that with round corners, and eventually to ring mode. In diamond mode, the mean force of the tubes increases linearly with the internal pressure. The enhancement comes from two mechanisms: direct effect of the pressure and indirect effect due to the interaction between the pressure and the tube wall. After the deformation switches to ring mode, the enhancement resulted from the second mechanism becomes weaker. Based on the results of mode-I, the mode-II was experimentally investigated both quasi-statically and dynamically. The results are compared with the predictions obtained from a semi-empirical formula, showing good agreements. Copyright © 2008 by ASME...|$|R

40|$|The {{aspect to}} be {{investigated}} during this contract was an electron-beam triggered <b>diamond</b> <b>switch</b> {{to be used in}} high power modulators. Today's high power modulators require higher voltage switches than those developed to date. Specifically, the proposed 1 TeV linear collider, the NLC/ILC at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC), consists of two linacs with 6600 X-Band klystrons powered by 3300 high power modulators. These modulators require switches capable of handling 80 kV, switching 8 kA with pulse durations ranging from 2 ps (linac) to 6 {micro}s (pre-linac) with switching times < 50 ns at pulse repetition frequencies up to 180 Hz. In addition the large number of switches and other components dictate a pulse to pulse jitter of < 10 ns and a mean time between failures of at least 50, 000 hours. The present approach is to use hydrogen filled thyratrons. While these switches meet the voltage and conduction current requirements they lack the required reliability (pulse to pulse jitter) and lifetime. Research to improve these aspects is in progress. A solid state switch inherently offers the required reliability and lifetime. However, Si-based switches developed to date are limited to about 5 kV and several must be stacked in series to deliver the required voltage. This further increases the already large parts count and compromises reliability and lifetime. A monolithic, solid state switch capable of meeting all the requirements for X-Band modulators would be ideal. DOE selected this proposal for a Phase 1 SBIR award and this final report describes the progress made during the contract...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this talk, I {{will focus}} on the {{specificities}} of diamond power devices, from the simulation of Field Effect high voltage Transistors (FET) to the characterization and implementation of diamond devices in power converters. Indeed, diamond has unique electrical and thermal properties and dedicated simulation and characterization tools are required [1]. Moreover, to demonstrate the full potential of diamond in power electronics, high temperature operation above 200 °C is required to reduce conduction losses and reach higher figure of merits [2 - 4]. However, typical electronics associated with diamond power devices will have eventually to work at such high temperatures, with high constraints on reliability. Possible solutions to guarantee low conduction losses and high <b>switching</b> speed with <b>diamond</b> power devices will be presented. In this context, I will first present the recent research on simulation of diamond power devices, with a special focus on FET and drift region optimization (contribution of contact, access, channel and drift region resistance to the total ON state resistance). The transient dV/dt immunity of different FET architectures has been studied and will be presented, with design constraints above 200 kV/µs to guarantee low switching losses. Model accuracy (avalanche breakdown, conduction mechanisms, impurity modelling) and convergence issues (2 D and 3 D structures, transient analysis, temperature dependence) will be discussed. Finally, characterization and implementation of diamond power devices in a 100 W power commutation cell will be described. A particular focus will be done on self-heating during measurements (DC, pulsed DC, large signal switching), dedicated high temperature - high speed gate drivers and optimized power commutation cell. New prospects such as monolithic integration for diamond power electronics will be briefly introduced. Although a lot of work is still remaining on the material side, it is indeed the right time to push forward the diamond power electronics.
