25|$|Streets of Fire {{began in}} the {{euphoria}} of knowing that Paramount really liked 48 {{and wanted to be}} in business with us if they could. What happened was that after we screened that cut for Paramount, Larry looked at Walter and said, “Paramount is pregnant; let’s get something and set it up right away.” Walter knew what he meant—that we were in a great position here—so he said, “We can do this two ways: present an idea now and get a deal done, or write a script on spec and get a lot more money.” Walter proudly considers himself a capitalist, so he <b>suggested</b> <b>we</b> do the latter.|$|E
500|$|Cagney's {{portrayal}} of Cody Jarrett in the 1949 film White Heat {{is one of}} his most memorable. Cinema had changed in the 10 years since Walsh last directed Cagney (in The Strawberry Blonde), and the actor's {{portrayal of}} gangsters had also changed. Unlike Tom Powers in The Public Enemy, Jarrett was portrayed as a raging lunatic with few if any sympathetic qualities. In the 18 intervening years, Cagney's hair had begun to gray, and he developed a paunch for the first time. He was no longer a romantic commodity, and this was reflected in his performance. Cagney himself had the idea of playing Jarrett as psychotic; he later stated, [...] "it was essentially a cheapie one-two-three-four kind of thing, so I <b>suggested</b> <b>we</b> make him nuts. It was agreed so we put in all those fits and headaches." ...|$|E
500|$|Playdead {{chose to}} ignore outside advice from investors and critics during development, such as to add {{multiplayer}} play and adjustable difficulty levels, and to extend the game's length. According to Patti, Playdead felt these changes would break the integrity of Jensen's original vision. Patti also felt that the investors [...] "tried to control the company with no usable knowledge or respect", citing that after Microsoft raised concerns {{about the death of}} the boy, [...] "one of the investors <b>suggested</b> <b>we</b> make him appear older by giving him a moustache." [...] Numerous iterations of the game took place during a two-and-a-half year development cycle, including changes Jensen had demanded to polish the title, some elements being added two months prior to the game's release. Patti stated that they [...] "trashed 70%" [...] of the content they had developed, due to it not fitting in well with the context of the game. The core development team size was about 8 developers, expanding to 16 at various stages with freelancers. Playdead developed the design tools for Limbo in Visual Studio; Patti commented they would likely seek third-party applications for their next project given the challenges in creating their own technology. Patti later revealed they had opted to use the Unity engine for their next project, citing the development of their custom engine for Limbo as a [...] "double product, doing both engine and game", and that their Limbo engine is limited to monochromatic visuals.|$|E

2500|$|Perrow {{concluded}} that the failure at Three Mile Island was {{a consequence of the}} system's immense complexity. Such modern high-risk systems, he realized, were prone to failures however well they were managed. It was inevitable that they would eventually suffer what he termed a 'normal accident'.

We were going to leave Chris to mix it on his own, with Alan Parsons engineering. And of course on the first day I found out that Roger sneaked in there. So the second day I sneaked in there.

[...] However, Salon.com reported a statement from Cheney press aide Cathie Martin regarding advice she says she offered when the Bush administration had to respond to charges that it manipulated pre-Iraq War intelligence: [...] "I <b>suggested</b> <b>we</b> put the vice president on Meet the Press, which was a tactic we often used.

[...] And that year break becomes two years, then becomes three years, {{and before you know}} it five or six years go by pretty quickly. [...] I can't do what I do in the Wallflowers without them. [...] I miss it." [...] In an interview with the St. Joseph News-Press, Dylan stated that the Wallflowers would be getting into the studio in January and the lineup would include Greg Richling on bass, Rami Jaffee on keys, Stuart Mathis on guitar and Fred Eltringham on drums. [...] However, weeks before the Wallflowers began recording, Eltringham left the band to pursue other projects. [...] The band quickly got former Red Hot Chili Peppers and Pearl Jam drummer Jack Irons to join the band. [...] Irons was previously involved in a side project with Wallflowers bassist Richling.|$|E
2500|$|In 1967, the Common Council of the City of London {{placed the}} bridge {{on the market}} and began to look for {{potential}} buyers. Council member Ivan Luckin had put forward the idea of selling the bridge, and recalled: [...] "They all thought I was completely crazy when I <b>suggested</b> <b>we</b> should sell London Bridge when it needed replacing." [...] On 18 April 1968, Rennie's bridge was sold to an American. It was purchased by the Missourian entrepreneur Robert P. McCulloch of McCulloch Oil for US$2,460,000. The claim that McCulloch believed mistakenly that he was buying the more impressive Tower Bridge was denied by Luckin in a newspaper interview. As the bridge was taken apart, each piece was meticulously numbered. The blocks were then shipped overseas through the Panama Canal to California and trucked from Long Beach to Arizona. The bridge was reconstructed by Sundt Construction at Lake Havasu City, Arizona, and re-dedicated on 10 October 1971. The reconstruction of Rennie's London Bridge spans the Bridgewater Channel canal that leads from the Uptown area of Lake Havasu City and follows McCulloch Boulevard onto an island {{that has yet to be}} named.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2010, Guillermo del Toro {{signed on}} as {{executive}} producer. Discussing del Toro, Miller stated: [...] "We worked out a system {{for him to come}} in once every few months or whenever we had something new to show him. If we needed someone to bounce ideas off of, he was always there, and if we had a problem we were tackling, we'd get Guillermo on the red phone – our emergency phone – and ask him advice on what we should do with a certain character or scene. It was like having our own film school." [...] Miller stated that del Toro was particularly involved in Humpty's character design. [...] "Guillermo loved the dreamy quality of Humpty Dumpty. He <b>suggested</b> <b>we</b> push that further, make him more like da Vinci." [...] It was del Toro's idea to make Humpty [...] "an ingenious freak of nature" [...] who builds contraptions such as a flying machine. Del Toro rewrote the ending to redeem the character and deepen his relationship with Puss – an unconventional conclusion for a children's film. He helped design the fantasy elements of the giant's castle, as well as the architecture of the town, which he conceived as [...] "an amalgam of Spain and Mexico".|$|E
