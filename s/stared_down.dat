5|$|In January 2009, Goldust {{participated in}} the annual Royal Rumble match and <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> Cody who {{ultimately}} eliminated him. Goldust married WWE Diva Aksana on 2 November 2010 on NXT, with Dusty and Cody in attendance. In 2013, Goldust was a surprise entrant for the Royal Rumble match on January 26 and was once again eliminated by his half-brother. Although he hinted at a possible feud with Cody, he later confirmed {{in an interview that}} his return was a one night only deal.|$|E
500|$|Walpole {{was sent}} to England, where {{according}} to his biographer Rupert Hart-Davis {{the next ten years}} were the unhappiest time of Walpole's life. He first attended a preparatory school in Truro. Though he missed his family and felt lonely he was reasonably happy, but he moved to Sir William Borlase's Grammar School in Marlow in 1895, where he was bullied, frightened and miserable. He later said, [...] "The food was inadequate, the morality was 'twisted', and Terror – sheer, stark unblinking Terror – <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> every one of its passages... The excessive desire to be loved that has always played so enormous a part in my life was bred largely, I think, from the neglect I suffered there".|$|E
2500|$|On 12 August, Berthold {{once again}} checked {{himself out of}} a hospital. He arrived at the Jasta 15 officers' mess coincidentally with the newly {{appointed}} wing commander. Berthold <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> Rittmeister Heinz Freiherr von Brederlow, who was senior to him, and announced, [...] "Here I am the boss." [...] Once Brederlow departed, Berthold took to bed, stating he would run the fighter wing from there. The following day, he was feverish and writhing in pain. The doctor who was called ordered Berthold back into hospitalization. On the 14th, Kaiser Wilhelm II personally ordered the ace to hospital, and appointed Berthold's deputy commander, Leutnant Josef Veltjens, to take command of the wing. On 16 August, Veltjens saw Berthold off to the rear on a train.|$|E

2500|$|At the Royal Rumble, The Undertaker {{competed in}} the Royal Rumble match, but Roman Reigns entered the match at number thirty and {{eliminated}} Undertaker. In the ensuing stare down, Reigns exclaimed: [...] "This is my yard now!", a claim Undertaker had made for many years. On the March 6 episode of Raw, Braun Strowman, who had lost to Reigns at Fastlane, called out Reigns, but instead, The Undertaker appeared and <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> Strowman until Strowman left the ring. Reigns then came out and reiterated that WWE was his yard now. After a stare down, The Undertaker attacked Reigns with a chokeslam. A match between the two at WrestleMania 33 was confirmed the following week. Later on Raw, The Undertaker's gong sounded during Reigns' match against Jinder Mahal; Reigns was distracted, but nevertheless defeated Mahal. When Reigns called out The Undertaker after the match, Shawn Michaels came out instead to give Reigns advice about The Undertaker. Reigns said that he appreciated the advice, but {{said that he would}} retire The Undertaker just as Undertaker had retired Michaels at WrestleMania XXVI. The following week, during Reigns' rematch with Strowman, The Undertaker attacked Strowman with a chokeslam, but was surprised by Reigns with a spear. When Reigns had left, Undertaker sat up and taunted Reigns with his throat slash gesture. On the final Raw before WrestleMania, The Undertaker stated that the graveyard would be Reigns' yard after WrestleMania.|$|E
2500|$|In September, Opposition and Commonwealth Liberal Party leader Joseph Cook {{addressed}} {{parliament in}} support of conscription: [...] "There are some that {{do not believe in}} the compulsion of men, who say that Australia has done enough ... I hope there are few men in the parliament who believe that ... We are proud of what the Empire has done, and our contribution must be adequate, and in every way worthy of that effort ... To [...] now would be a national sin, a national calamity. As opposition leader, Cook had opposed almost no government measures throughout 1916, and Hughes and his faction were becoming increasingly distant from the bulk of the ALP and aligning much more with the conservative opposition. When the second reading of the Military Service Referendum bill was moved, it carried 46 to 10 in the House and 19 to 9 in the Senate. In neither house did any member of the opposition vote against the bill [...] the against vote came entirely from Labor detractors. [...] Upon the second moving of the Referendum Bill, Frank Tudor resigned from Hughes' cabinet. A group of 15 representatives and 12 senators, led by Frank Brennan and Myles Ferricks, opposed the bill at every stage {{on the grounds that it}} was a question of conscience on which no majority, no matter how large, had a right to impose its will on the minority. Hughes <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> his enemies within the party and committed himself fully to the campaign: [...] "For myself, I say that I am going into this referendum campaign as if it were the only thing for which I lived." ...|$|E

50|$|Braun Strowman {{called out}} Roman Reigns, stating that Reigns got lucky. Instead of Reigns, The Undertaker came out. After a <b>stare</b> <b>down,</b> Strowman left the ring. As Undertaker {{was about to}} leave, Reigns came out. Reigns confronted Undertaker, and said that Strowman had called him out, not the deadman, before declaring the ring as his yard now. After a <b>stare</b> <b>down,</b> both looked at the WrestleMania sign and Undertaker chokeslammed Reigns. A match between Undertaker and Reigns at WrestleMania was made {{official}} the following week. Reigns and Strowman had their Fastlane rematch on the March 20 episode, but were interrupted by The Undertaker, who chokeslammed Strowman, and Reigns hit a spear on Undertaker. Strowman was then confirmed for the 2017 André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal.|$|R
