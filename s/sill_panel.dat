50|$|An overbored Lawrencetune 1650 cc {{version was}} made {{available}} in 1967 (32 built) to ameliorate the power shortage, for the Marcos 1650 GT. The 1650 also had bigger disc brakes {{and a standard}} Webasto sunroof, but proved somewhat less than reliable. It and the 1500 were both replaced by Ford's new Crossflow four not much later, in late 1967. The 1600 {{proved to be the}} most popular model yet, with 192 cars built until early 1969. Weight was 740 kg and disc brakes up front were standard, although power assist was an optional extra. Production ended in October 1969 as the new steel chassis was not well suited for the crossflow engine. A new model, the 2 litre, appeared at the January 1969 London Show with the engine changed to the Ford Essex V4 engine (3006E) from the Ford Corsair - while a V6 engine had already appeared {{at the top of the}} lineup in 1968. Also in 1969 (June), the plywood chassis was gradually replaced by a square section steel one, which shortened production time and saved on cost. These steel framed cars required a lower <b>sill</b> <b>panel</b> and have reshaped rear bumpers, as well as some subtle interior differences. The wooden chassis had also begun to meet a certain amount of resistance from buyers. There seem to have been no V4-engined wooden cars made, although there is a few months overlap between the introduction dates.|$|E

50|$|Similar to {{a ladder}} frame, but the middle {{sections}} of the frame rails sit outboard of {{the front and rear}} rails just behind the rocker / <b>sill</b> <b>panels.</b> This was done to allow for a lower floor pan, especially at the passenger footwells, to lower the passengers' seating height and therefore reduce the overall vehicle height in passenger cars. This became the prevalent design for body-on-frame cars in the United States, but not {{in the rest of the}} world, until the uni-body gained popularity. It allowed for annual model changes introduced in the 1950s to increase sales, but without costly structural changes. As of 2014, there are no perimeter frame automobiles sold in the United States after the Ford Motor Company phased out the Panther platform in 2011, which ended the perimeter frame passenger car in the United States (the Chevrolet Corvette has used a variation of the perimeter frame since 1963, but its fourth generation variant to its current generation as of 2016 has elements of the perimeter frame integrated with an internal endoskeleton which serves as a clamshell).|$|R

5000|$|As {{with all}} GM {{full-size}} lines, the Series 75 was redesigned for 1971. The new GM full-size bodies, at 64.3 inches front shoulder room (62.1 inches on Cadillac) and 63.4 inches rear shoulder room (64.0 inches on Cadillac) {{set a record}} for interior width {{that would not be}} matched by any car until the full-size GM rear-wheel-drive models of the early to mid-1990s. Pairs of individually housed squarish headlamps were set wider apart. The V-shaped grille had an eggcrate style insert and was protected by massive vertical guards framing a rectangular license plate indentation. A wide hood with full-length windsplints, a prominent center crease and hidden windshield wipers was seen. A Cadillac crest decorated the nose and new indicator lamps appeared atop each front fender. A horizontal beltline molding ran from behind the front wheel housing, almost to the rear stopping where an elliptical bulge in the body came to a point and where thin rectangular side markers were placed above and below the chrome strip. The rear wheel openings were again housed in fender skirts. Taillamps were of the same type as before but were no longer divided by a chrome bar. Long horizontal back-up lamps were set in the bumper, on either side of a deeply recessed license plate housing. Standard equipment included automatic level control; automatic climate control; rear window defogger; four rear ashtrays and manual right-hand outside rearview mirror. The rear roof could be custom finished in several different ways including triangular [...] "coach" [...] windows or vinyl covered [...] "blind quarter" [...] looks. Ornamentation included the traditional Fleetwood laurel wreath crests and lettering. No rocker <b>sill</b> strips, <b>panels</b> or extension moldings were used. And, of course, the limousine had doors cut into the roof, special upholstery appointment and a driver's partition with adjustable division window.|$|R
