50|$|If the CP/M BIOS is modified, it is {{possible}} to read any soft sector 40-track MFM format. Single density (FM) formats are not supported because the density <b>selector</b> <b>pin</b> on the MFM controller chip in the drive is disabled (wired to ground).|$|E
5000|$|... "Selectorized" [...] {{dumbbells}} are adjustable dumbbells whose {{number of}} plates (i.e. weight) {{can be easily}} changed when resting in the dumbbell stand. This is achieved by adjusting the number of plates that follow the handle when lifted, e.g. by turning a dial or moving a <b>selector</b> <b>pin</b> — rather than manually adding or removing plates. This makes it very easy to change {{the weight of the}} dumbbell between exercises, and the stand typically doubles as storage for the additional weights not being used for a particular exercise.|$|E
50|$|For example, 9 to 16 inputs {{would require}} {{no fewer than}} 4 <b>selector</b> <b>pins</b> and 17 to 32 inputs would require no fewer than 5 <b>selector</b> <b>pins.</b> The binary value {{expressed}} on these <b>selector</b> <b>pins</b> determines the selected input pin.|$|R
5000|$|Larger {{multiplexers}} {{are also}} common and, as stated above, require [...] <b>selector</b> <b>pins</b> for [...] inputs. Other common sizes are 4-to-1, 8-to-1, and 16-to-1. Since digital logic uses binary values, powers of 2 are used (4, 8, 16) to maximally control {{a number of}} inputs for the given number of selector inputs.|$|R
5000|$|In {{digital circuit}} design, the {{selector}} wires are of digital value. In {{the case of}} a 2-to-1 multiplexer, a logic value of 0 would connect [...] to the output while a logic value of 1 would connect [...] to the output.In larger multiplexers, the number of <b>selector</b> <b>pins</b> is equal to [...] where [...] is the number of inputs.|$|R
50|$|Larger Multiplexers can be {{constructed}} by using smaller multiplexers by chaining them together. For example, an 8-to-1 multiplexer {{can be made with}} two 4-to-1 and one 2-to-1 multiplexers. The two 4-to-1 multiplexer outputs are fed into the 2-to-1 with the <b>selector</b> <b>pins</b> on the 4-to-1's put in parallel giving a total number of selector inputs to 3, which is equivalent to an 8-to-1.|$|R
50|$|Counter/Selector (separate-cathode) dekatrons {{have each}} cathode wired {{to its own}} pin; {{therefore}} their bases have at least 13 <b>pins.</b> <b>Selectors</b> allow for monitoring the status of each cathode or to divide-by-n with the proper reset circuitry. This kind of versatility made such dekatrons useful for numerical division in early calculators.|$|R
5000|$|The M6 was a superposed ("over-under") {{combination}} gun, {{with a rifle}} barrel located {{above the}} shotgun barrel. The rifle barrel fired a [...]22 Hornet bullet and the shotgun barrel was chambered for a [...]410 bore shell. For compact storage, the M6 folded in half and a compartment in the stock held 9 rounds of [...]22 Hornet ammunition with 4 shotgun shells. A firing <b>pin</b> <b>selector</b> allowed the shooter to choose which barrel would be fired.|$|R
5000|$|After {{discharging}} {{the last}} cartridge from the magazine, the bolt carrier and bolt are held {{back on a}} bolt catch that is released by pulling the cocking handle to the rear. The rifle has a hammer-type striking mechanism and a manual lever safety <b>selector.</b> The firing <b>pin</b> is a [...] "free-floating" [...] type and, as a result, some soft-primered ammunition had the reputation of causing a [...] "slam fire" [...] event. Thus, military-grade ammunition with primers confirmed to be properly seated is recommended for the Dragunov and its variants. This appears to have solved the [...] "slam fire" [...] issue. The rifle's receiver is machined to provide additional accuracy and torsional strength. The Dragunov's receiver bears a number of similarities to the AK action, such as the large dust cover, iron sights and lever safety selector, but these similarities are primarily cosmetic in nature. These cosmetic similarities can lead to mis-categorization of the Dragunov as an AK variant.|$|R
50|$|The Stoner 63/63A LMG is an {{automatic}} weapon that fires {{from the open}} bolt and the trigger mechanism permits only fully automatic firing though burst size can be controlled by the shooter. The entire trigger unit has four trigger pins that give the unit its modularity. The front pin holds a flapper-type magazine catch/release (used in the Rifle/Carbine variants and the left-hand feed LMG with a 150-round drum-type belt container), a full dust cover (used with the top-feeding Automatic Rifle or vertically mounted ammo box on any belt-fed system) or a half size dust cover (used with the right-hand-feed bottom box carrier). The next two pins retain the timer and hammer, {{both of which are}} absent in the open bolt configurations. The final pin acts as the trigger’s axis shaft; the spring-loaded sear pivots on the <b>selector</b> lever’s axis <b>pin.</b> The <b>selector</b> is disconnected when firing from the open bolt and a sliding manual safety installed near the trigger guard disables the trigger when pushed to the rear. The rear portion of the trigger housing serves as a receiver end cap and is used to attach the shoulder stock. The black polycarbonate pistol grip is also attached to the trigger housing. The checkered grip is flared at the bottom to prevent the shooter’s hand from sliding off and has an internal storage compartment sealed by a hinged cover with a spring-loaded hatch.|$|R
