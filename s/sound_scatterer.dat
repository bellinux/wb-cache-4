40|$|Simultaneous 'real-time' B-mode and doppler {{ultrasound}} {{techniques were}} used to study movements of the detached vitreous gel which occurred during duction movements of the eye. The velocity of <b>sound</b> <b>scatterers</b> within the vitreous gel were measured and {{it was possible to}} differentiate quantitatively gels which were 'stiff' from those which were 'sloppy'. Information obtained using this technique may throw light on the pathogenesis of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and assist in the quantitative assessment of retinal mobility in eyes with vitreoretinopathies. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|It is {{demonstrated}} that sonic crystals (periodic structures of <b>sound</b> <b>scatterers)</b> {{can be used}} to design acoustic barriers that attenuate efficiently broadband noise. Traffic noise is chosen here as an example in which our design procedure is applied. The structures consist of cylindrical units containing rubber crumb, a sound absorbing material. An optimization algorithm is developed to obtain the material distribution and the dimensions of the sonic crystal giving the best attenuation properties for this noise. The good agreement found between predictions and measurements for a barrier (3 m height) characterized in a transmission room gives strong support to our proposal...|$|R
40|$|The {{possibility}} of estimating {{the distribution and}} abundance of 0 -group fish {{by a combination of}} echo surveying and fishing experiments with pelagic trawl and purse seine is discussed. The existence of scattering layers, their origin, and the identification of <b>sound</b> <b>scatterers</b> are discussed with special reference to observations made in recent years off northern Norway and in the Barents Sea. The scattering layers observed in late summer and autumn in this area consist mainly of 0 -group fish of which herring, cod and haddock are most important. The transport of the larvae from the spawning places in relation to the current systems is described. The observations indicate that during August to October fish fry are abundant in the surface layers of the north and east going currents, {{and by the end of}} autumn the fry are aggregated along the frontiers between the cold and warm water masses covering the area from Spitsbergen to Bear Island and further to the east and south over the central and south-eastern parts of the Barents Sea. The relation between echo signals received from scattering agents distributed at a constant depth and the amount of scatterers is discussed, as well as the effect of variations in depth distribution. Special attention is paid to the signal strength received from targets uniformly distributed in a layer or school of wide horizontal distribution. The needs for theoretical as well as empirical studies of the relationship between the amount of echo signals received and the abundance of <b>sound</b> <b>scatterers</b> are stressed. The first results of charting the echo-abundance distribution are presented. For this purpose an electronic echo-integrator was developed to measure exactly the signal voltages received. Some preliminary data on the relationship between echo-abundance and the catch of fish fry with purse seine are also given...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} third sound and quartz crystal {{microbalance}} measurements on thin superfluid 4 He films (4 – 16 atomic layers) exploring {{the effect of}} surface roughness, disorder and localization are reported. The effect of surface roughness on 4 He adsorption and third sound speed is studied in detail for several well parameterized CaF 2 surfaces. The third sound velocity and the 4 He adsorption on CaF 2 both show a hysteretic behavior with the adding and removing of 4 He. Adsorption to the CaF 2 can {{be as much as}} ten times larger than on similar smooth surfaces and the third sound travelling on this thicker 4 He film propagates up to three times slower. ^ Substrates are fabricated that contain two-dimensional random and ordered collections of disk shaped CaF 2 regions on an otherwise smooth background. The difference in the third sound speed and 4 He adsorption on the two regions causes the CaF 2 regions to act as third <b>sound</b> <b>scatterers.</b> The frequency dependence of the third sound propagation through the arrays is reported: pass bands and band gaps are observed on the ordered array and classical wave localization effects are observed on the disordered array. ...|$|R
40|$|Zooplankton {{distributions}} during coastal upwelling {{in western}} Lake Superior were mapped with a high-frequency (192 ~kHz) sonar system {{that consists of}} an echosounder and a navigation receiver connected to a microcomputer. An acoustic transect after a September storm revealed a sloping sound-scattering layer, traceable more than 5 km offshore, in the thermocline between an upwelling water mass and a returning front of surface water. Interfacial shear produced short internal waves on the scattering layer, and regularly spaced plumes of high backscattering in the surface layer were attributed to stream lines of eddies that were transporting <b>sound</b> <b>scatterers</b> from aggregations in the thermocline to the lake surface. The sloping sound-scattering layer was due to high concentrations (up to lo 5 ind. m- 3) of copepods, chiefly Leptodiuptomus sicilis. Backscattered sound (volume-scattering strength) was highly correlated with concentrations of microcrustacea in samples collected with nets, consistent with Rayleigh scattering theory for ideal elastic spheres the size of adult L. sicilis (target strength =- 123 dB). Acoustic sampling revealed a skewed frequency distribution; low animal concentrations ( 105 m- 3) with concentrations several orders of magnitude larger than the median, Infrequent patches of very high densities are probably a general feature of zooplankton populations, because the patchiness inferred from soun...|$|R
40|$|Atlantic {{mackerel}} (Scomber scombrus) {{are weak}} <b>sound</b> <b>scatterers</b> compared with fish that have swimbladders. Accurate acoustic esti-mates of mackerel abundance require estimates of target strength. Different parts of mackerel may dominate the backscattering spectra. Mackerel schools are acoustically recognized mainly by backscatter four times stronger at 200 kHz than at 38 kHz. Simulations have established that backscatter from only {{the flesh and}} the backbone could explain this frequency response, although there are uncertainties in the model parameters and simplifications. In this paper, experiments conducted in a laboratory tank to investigate the complexity of mackerel backscatter are discussed. Acoustic backscatter was measured over the frequency range 65 – 470 kHz from individual dead mackerel, and their backbones, heads, and skulls. Backscatter from the backbones was measured at several angles of incidence. Grating lobes (Bragg scattering) appeared at different angles, depending on the acoustic frequency and the spacing of the vertebrae. These lobes were evident in backbone backscatter after propagating through the flesh and can be used, in principle, to determine mackerel size acoustically. The frequency response of individual, ex situ Atlantic mackerel estimated from these measurements did not match that from the measurements of in situ mackerel schools. Further investigation is warranted...|$|R
40|$|To acoustically {{assess the}} biomass of {{multiple}} species or taxa within a survey region, the volume backscatter data should be apportioned to the constituent <b>sound</b> <b>scatterers.</b> Typically, measured backscatter is attributed to certain species using predictions at different frequencies, mostly based on the difference in scattering at the frequencies of 38 and 120 kHz ('dual frequency method'). We used the full version of the stochastic distorted wave Born approximation model (SDWBA) to predict backscatter spectra for Meganyctiphanes norvegica and to explore the sensitivities of ΔMVBS to the model parameters, e. g. acoustic frequency and incidence angle, and animal density and sound speed contrast, length, and shape. The orientation is almost the unique parameter responsible for variation, with fatness affecting longer lengths. We present a summary of ΔMVBS that can {{serve as the basis}} for identification algorithms. Next, we simulate the scenario encountered in the Balearic Sea (western Mediterranean) where Northern krill are mixed with mesopelagic fish species (bristlemouths and lanternfishes), which are modeled with a prolate spheroid model. Simulated numerical data are employed to emulate the discrimination process with the most common identification techniques and typical survey frequencies. The importance of using density-independent techniques for acoustic classification is highlighted. Finally, an unsupervised neural network, the Self-Organizing Map (SOM), is used to cluster these theoretical data and identify the frequencies that provide, in this case, the most classification potential. The simulation results confirm that pairs of frequencies spanning the Rayleigh and geometric scattering regimes of the targets are the most useful for clustering; a minimum of four frequencies are necessary to separate the three species, while three frequencies are able to differentiate krill from mesopelagic fish species.

40|$|Dual {{frequency}} (38 and 120 kHz) acoustic {{surveys of}} shelf-break {{regions in the}} vicinity of the Willis Islands, South Georgia, and Coronation Island, South Orkneys, both in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean, were carried out from RRS 'James Clark Ross' during January 1994. The difference in echo signal strength between the 2 frequencies [deltaMVBS (mean volume backscattering strength) = MVBS 120 kHz - MVBS 38 kHz] was used to partition acoustic targets into 3 biological categories: Antarctic krill Euphausia superba, nekton (larger than krill) and zooplankton (smaller than krill). Krill density estimates were derived for both survey areas, and the relative contribution of each class of target to overall regional pelagic biomass determined. Krill distribution in both regions was extremely patchy, resulting in a highly skewed frequency distribution of density; for example one echo-integration interval contained 104 times the mean krill density. An approximate 6 -fold difference in mean krill abundance was detected between the 2 areas but, in comparison with previously published density estimates, krill densities in both regions were extremely low (1. 7 and 10. 7 gm- 2 for Willis and Coronation Islands respectively). Gross regional differences in pelagic faunal composition were apparent from inspection of echo charts, and were quantified by detailed analysis of acoustic signals. The water column {{in the vicinity of}} the Willis Islands was characterised by a series of diffuse but continuous scattering layers visible only at 120 kHz, and 73 % by mass of acoustic targets in this region were classified as zooplankton. In marked contrast, the Coronation Island region was dominated by dense, discrete acoustic target patches which were classified as larger, nektonic, <b>sound</b> <b>scatterers</b> (fish or squid), and only 12 % of targets there were classified as zooplankton. Elsewhere, data from predator diet analyses carried out at Bird Island, South Georgia, during the same season that our acoustic measurements were made, confirm the profoundly low levels of krill availability there and support the acoustic observation that the Willis Islands region contained large numbers of small zooplankton such as the amphipod Themisto gaudichaudii. Similarly, available data on analyses of stomach contents of Chinstrap penguins nesting in a neighbouring region within an oceanographic setting similar to that of Coronation Island reveal the presence of more fish in the diet than usual. Conclusions drawn from acoustic observations as to the relative regional composition of pelagic biomass are therefore clearly supported by independent evidence gathered from predators, and the value of integrating predator/prey and acoustic studies to characterise the content of localised marine ecosystems is demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{periodic}} structure that behaves as a fluid-fluid composite for sound waves, where {{the building blocks}} are clusters of rigid scatterers. Such building-blocks are penetrable for acoustic waves, and their properties can be tuned by selecting the filling fraction. The equivalence with a fluid-fluid system of such a doubly periodic composite is tested analytical and experimentally. Because of the fluid-like character of the <b>scatterers,</b> <b>sound</b> structure interaction is negligible, and the propagation can be described by scalar models, analogous to those used in electromagnetics. As an example, the case of focusing of evanescent waves and the guided propagation of acoustic waves along an array of penetrable elements is discussed in detail. The proposed structure may be a real alternative to design a low contrast and acoustically penetrable medium where new properties as those shown in this work could be experimentally realized.
