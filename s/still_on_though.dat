5000|$|The Galway shawl was woven {{on a hand}} {{jacquard}} loom in Paisley, Scotland, but used neither the design nor construction of the shawl {{commonly known as the}} Paisley shawl. The Galway shawl was woven on a cotton warp with a weft of botany wool. These reversible shawls were a solid color in the center with a decorative, multicolor, wide border; and they were fringed. The Galway shawl contained neither velvet nor fur, but it was referred to by weavers as a velvet or fur shawl because it was heavily milled in the finishing and a soft, velvet-like nap was raised on the surface. In 1892 one company in Paisley employed 40 weavers producing this type of shawl. The last firm weaving fur or velvet shawls closed in 1943, and one of their looms was donated to the Paisley Museum where it is <b>still</b> <b>on</b> display <b>though</b> it is no longer in working condition.

50|$|However, {{the vast}} {{majority}} of illustrators received little recognition, compared to the fine art painters. This was basically due to their artwork being viewed as more commercially, than creatively inspired. Nonetheless, illustrators once played a powerful role in communicating the people's aspirations, concerns, customs, humor, labor, morals and social interests. One of them was Paul Martin, whose work appeared on the covers of Collier's, Everybody's, Farm & Fireside, The Farmer's Wife, Liberty, Parents and People's Home Journal from 1923-31. These seven magazines once ranked among the most widely circulated. They all went out of business a long time ago, except for Parents. Their eventual downfall was caused by the changing times (or taste), emergence of radio and television (more attractive medium for advertisers), and economics (increased cost/decreased revenue). The more specialized ones that targeted specific audiences, tended to fare better. Another point is that major advancements in photographic equipment and technology took place during the 1930s. This brought about the gradual changeover (twenty-five+ year process) from illustrated to photographic covers. The former <b>still</b> lingered <b>on</b> <b>though,</b> for its uniqueness in imagery and creativity, until succumbing to digital media (especially Photoshop).|$|R
5000|$|After the {{transition}} period of the 1970s, the neoliberal era is commonly said to have begun at about 1980. Also referred to by economic historians as the Washington Consensus era, its emergence was marked by the rise to power of Margaret Thatcher in Great Britain, and Ronald Reagan in the United States. While there was no attempt to revive the previous system of fixed exchange rates on a global scale, Neoliberalism upheld a similar commitment to free trade as had the previous era. Similar to the era of classical economic liberalism, neoliberalism involved the [...] "dis-embedding" [...] of markets - at a policy level {{some of the main}} changes involved pressure for governments to abolish their capital controls, and to refrain from economic interventions. Many of the institutions established in the previous era remained in place however, and free market ideology never became as influential as it had been during the peak years of classical liberalism. In a 1997 paper, Ruggie himself discussed how some of the protection gained for workers with the embedded liberal compromise <b>still</b> lived <b>on,</b> <b>though</b> he warned it was being eroded by the advance of market forces.|$|R
