He announced in letters during the Ten Year Crusade that it would be followed by other plans {{under the direction of the}} Universal House of Justice, which was elected in 1963 at the culmination of the Crusade. The House of Justice then {{launched a}} nine-year plan in 1964, and a series of subsequent multi-year plans of varying length and goals followed, guiding the direction of the international Bahá'í community.|$|E

5000|$|The {{main targets}} of the Third <b>Seven-Year</b> <b>Plan</b> of 1987-93 were to achieve the [...] "Ten Long-Range Major Goals of the 1980s for the Construction of the Socialist Economy". These goals, {{conceived}} in 1980, were to be fulfilled {{by the end of}} the decade. The fact that these targets were rolled over to the end of the Third <b>Seven-Year</b> <b>Plan</b> is another indication of the disappointing economic performance during the Second <b>Seven-Year</b> <b>Plan.</b> The three policy goals of self-reliance, modernization, and scientification were repeated. Economic growth was set at 7.9% annually, lower than the previous plan. Although achieving the ten major goals of the 1980s was the main thrust of the Third <b>Seven-Year</b> <b>Plan,</b> some substantial changes have been made in specific quantitative targets. For example, the target for the annual output of steel was reduced by a third: from 15 million tons to 10 million tons. The output targets of cement and non-ferrous metals — two major export items — have been increased significantly. The June 1989 introduction of the Three-Year Plan for Light Industry as part of the Third <b>Seven-Year</b> <b>Plan</b> is intended to boost the standard of living by addressing consumer needs.|$|E

5000|$|Based on {{a system}} of state ownership, the Soviet economy was managed through Gosplan (the State Planning Commission), Gosbank (the State Bank) and the Gossnab (State Commission for Materials and Equipment Supply). Beginning in 1928, the economy was {{directed}} {{by a series of}} five-year plans, with a brief attempt at <b>seven-year</b> <b>planning.</b> For every enterprise, planning ministries (also known as the [...] "fund holders" [...] or fondoderzhateli) defined the mix of economic inputs (e.g., labor and raw materials), a schedule for completion, all wholesale prices and almost all retail prices. The planning process was based around material balances—balancing economic inputs with planned output targets for the planning period. From 1930 until the late 1950s, the range of mathematics used to assist economic decision-making was, for ideological reasons, extremely restricted.|$|R

50|$|As was {{the case}} with the growth in {{national}} output, the pace of growth has slowed markedly since the 1960s. The rate declined from 41.7% and 36.6% a year during the Three-Year Plan and Five-Year Plan, respectively, to 12.8%, 16.3%, and 12.2%, respectively, during the First Seven Year Plan, Six-Year Plan, and Second <b>Seven-Year</b> <b>Plan.</b> As a result of faster growth in industry, that sector's share in total national output increased from 16.8% in 1946 to 57.3% in 1970. Since the 1970s, industry's share in national output has remained relatively stable. From all indications, the pace of industrialization during the Third <b>Seven-Year</b> <b>Plan</b> up to 1991 is far below the planned rate of 9.6%.

5000|$|The 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union {{took place}} in Moscow, USSR 27 January - 5 February 1959. It was a mid-term or [...] "Extraordinary" [...] Congress, timed so that Khrushchev could try to {{consolidate}} his power over rivals after the attempted coup of the Anti-Party Group in 1957.

50|$|The Six-Year Plan of 1971-76 {{followed}} {{immediately in}} 1971. In {{the aftermath of}} the poor performance of the preceding plan, growth targets of the Six-Year Plan were scaled down substantially. Because some of the proposed targets in the First <b>Seven-Year</b> <b>Plan</b> had not been attained even by 1970, the Six-Year Plan did not deviate much from its predecessor in basic goals. The Six-Year Plan placed more emphasis on technological advance, self-sufficiency (Juche) in industrial raw materials, improving product quality, correcting imbalances among different sectors, and developing the power and extractive industries; the last of these had been deemed largely responsible for slowdowns during the First <b>Seven-Year</b> <b>Plan.</b> The plan called for attaining a self- sufficiency rate of 60-70% in all industrial sectors by substituting domestic raw materials wherever possible and by organizing and renovating technical processes to make the substitution feasible. Improving transport capacity was seen as one of the urgent tasks in accelerating economic development—it was one of the major bottlenecks of the Six-Year Plan.|$|E

50|$|Although he {{intended}} these economic councils {{to be more}} responsive to local needs, the decentralization of industry led to disruption and inefficiency. Connected with this decentralization was Khrushchev's decision in 1962 to recast party organizations along economic, rather than administrative, lines. The resulting bifurcation of the party apparatus into industrial and agricultural sectors at the oblast (province) level and below contributed to the disarray and alienated many party officials at all levels. Symptomatic of the country's economic difficulties was the abandonment in 1963 of Khrushchev's special <b>seven-year</b> economic <b>plan</b> (1959-65) two years short of its completion.|$|R

50|$|Clinton said Republican {{amendments}} would {{strip the}} U.S. Treasury {{of its ability}} to dip into federal trust funds to avoid a borrowing crisis.

A GOP amendment opposed by Clinton would not only have increased Medicare Part B premiums, but it would also cancel a scheduled reduction. The Republicans held out for an increase in Medicare part B premiums in January 1996 to $53.50 a month. Clinton favored the then current law, which was to let the premium that seniors pay drop to $42.50.|$|R

As school property tax rates rise to meet the increasing costs of education, so do lawmaker's concerns that this stagnant tax base may need {{to be replaced by a}} more dynamic tax alternative. Prior to the Seventy-Fifth Legislature, a staff work group was formed by the Governor and other state elected officials to examine possible alternatives to the school property tax. The group suggested three alternatives. This thesis investigates the individual impacts that a business activity tax, a business gross receipts tax, and the abolition of agricultural sales tax exemptions would have on the economic viability of Texas farms. A whole farm computer simulation model (FLIPSIM) was used to simulate seven representative farms producing five of the state's chief agricultural commodities (beef cattle, cotton, feed grains, rice, and dairy) in different regions of the state. The farms were simulated under four different scenarios (a baseline, and the three tax alternatives from the staff work group report) for I 00 iterations over a <b>seven-year</b> <b>planning</b> horizon. FLIPSIM results generated an empirical probability density function for the net present value of each farm to be used by STODOM, a stochastic dominance computer program, to determine which tax strategy a risk-averse decision maker would prefer for each representative farm. The results indicated that the baseline tax scenario was preferred by five of the seven representative farms, while the two fanns with the lowest net cash farm income preferred the business activity tax. If the baseline tax scenario were not an option, all of the farrns would prefer the business activity tax. The sales tax strategy was the most economically adverse tax strategy for all of the seven farms, doublin...|$|R
