It has been unfortunate that one device which our narrative uses to express the coherence and purposiveness of the creator's work, namely, {{the distribution of the}} various creative acts to six days, has been seized on and interpreted over-literalistically… The six day schema is but one of several means employed in this chapter to stress the system and order that has been built into creation. Other devices include the use of repeating formulae, the tendency to group words and phrases into tens and sevens, literary techniques such as chiasm and inclusio, the arrangement of creative acts into matching groups, and so on. If these hints were not sufficient to indicate the schematization of the six-day creation story, the very content of the narrative points in the same direction. Gordon Wenham ...|$|E

MacEwan-transform-based analyses have uniformly shown higher incidence ofunlike adjacent layers than would be expected from random distribution. The continuous Fourier transforms for pairs of 2 : 1 layer silicate structures evaluated normal to the layers, provide a family of similar curves that are differently stretched out in reciprocal space for different assumed intervals between the two members of a pair. For each exactly alternating example the relative amplitudes of the ordered reciprocal nodes dis-tinguish the instances for which fixed interlayer populations are Na § from those {{for which they are}} K § For sequences not exactly alternating scattering maxima are displaced from exact incremental positions in conformity with the Hendricks and Teller mixing functions, but relative intensities of adjacent observations still distinguish t e alkali dentities.

40|$|As the {{endorsement}} of Enterprise Architecture (EA) modelling continues to grow in diversity and complexity, management of its schema, artefacts, semantics and relationships has become an important business concern. To maintain agility and flexibility within competitive markets, organizations have also been compelled to explore ways of adjusting proactively to innovations, changes and complex events also by use of EA concepts to model business processes and strategies. Thus the need to ensure appropriate validation of EA taxonomies has been considered severally as an essential requirement for these processes in order to exert business motivation; relate information systems to technological infrastructure. However, since many taxonomies deployed today use widespread and disparate modelling methodologies, the possibility to adopt a generic validation approach remains a challenge. The proliferation of EA methodologies and perspectives has also led to intricacies in the formalization and validation of EA constructs as models often times have variant <b>schematic</b> <b>interpretations.</b> Thus, disparate implementations and inconsistent simulation of alignment between business architectures and heterogeneous application systems is common within the EA domain (Jonkers et al., 2003). In this research, the Model Driven Validation Approach (MDVA) is introduced. MDVA allows modelling of EA with validation attributes, formalization of the validation concepts and transformation of model artefacts to ontologies. The transformation simplifies querying based on motivation and constraints. As the extended methodology is grounded on the semiotics of existing tools, validation is executed using ubiquitous query language. The major contributions of this work are the extension of a metamodel of Business Layer of an EAF with Validation Element {{and the development of}} EAF model to ontology transformation Approach. With this innovation, domain-driven design and object-oriented analysis concepts are applied to achieve EAF model’s validation using ontology querying methodology. Additionally, the MDVA facilitates the traceability of EA artefacts using ontology graph patterns...|$|R
40|$|Although young {{children}} typically have trouble reasoning relationally, they are {{aided by the}} presence of “relational” words (e. g., Gentner and Rattermann, 1991). They also reason well about commonly experienced event structures (e. g., Fivush, 1984). To explore what makes a word “relational” and therefore helpful in relational reasoning, we hypothesized that these words activate well-understood event structures. Furthermore, the activated schema must be open enough (without too much specificity) that it can be applied analogically to novel problems. Four experiments examine this hypothesis by exploring: how training with a label influence the <b>schematic</b> <b>interpretation</b> of a scene, what kinds of scenes are conducive to <b>schematic</b> <b>interpretation,</b> and whether children must figure out the interpretation themselves to benefit from the act of interpreting a scene as an event. Experiment 1 shows the superiority of schema-evoking words over words that do not connect to schematized experiences. Experiments 2 and 3 further reveal that these words must be applied to perceptual instances that require cognitive effort to connect to a label rather than unrelated or concretely related instances in order to draw attention to relational structure. Experiment 4 provides evidence that even when children do not work out an interpretation for themselves, just the act of interpreting an ambiguous scene is potent for relational generalization. The present results suggest that relational words (and in particular their meanings) are created from the act of interpreting a perceptual situation {{in the context of a}} word...|$|E

40|$|The {{impetus for}} this study {{is derived from the}} researcher's {{experience}} as a teacher and parent educator. In such contexts, parents frequently lament about the difficulties they experience in developing and sustaining "best practices" in raising their children, and the intransigent nature of existing habits. Much schematic cognition about issues such as relationships involved in parenting resides beneath conscious awareness, and is activated through automatic or habitual interpretations and behaviors. This study examines the nature of a group of mothers' (N= 14) schemas about parenting and the effects of these schemas on parenting practice. Four research questions guide this work : (1) what are the multiple parenting schemas that guide parenting practice? How are they expressed (articulated and enacted) ? (2) How does the expression of parenting schemas vary across development in interactions with children at 6 years of age, as compared with 10 year-olds? (3) How do parents balance and reconcile multiple parenting schemas in everyday parenting, and how is the balance of these schemas related to consistency in parenting practice? (4) To what degree is it possible to use this study's methodology to define and understand multiple schemas? To answer these questions, the subjects participated in recording their responses to interactions with their children in solicited daily diaries and engaged in two interviews. Interview transcripts were coded for examples of schematic cognitions that included attributional style, efficacy cognitions, cultural models and conceptual metaphors. The data revealed detailed examples of schematic cognitions related to parenting. A key finding was a differing influence of schematic cognitions on emotion activation and cognitive distortions about parenting practice and child outcomes. Findings from this study inform parent education contexts, as well as development opportunities for teachers or other adults working with children and provide insight into how <b>schematic</b> <b>interpretations</b> are expressed both in language and parenting practic...|$|R

Since these rules are <b>schematic,</b> the <b>interpretation</b> of the introduction rule is: if from [...] "A true" [...] we can derive for every proposition p that [...] "p true", then A must be false, i.e., [...] "not A true". For the elimination, if both A and not A are shown to be true, then there is a contradiction, in which case every proposition C is true. Because the rules for implication and negation are so similar, it should be fairly easy to see that not A and A ⊃ ⊥ are equivalent, i.e., each is derivable from the other.|$|R

40|$|Two {{classical}} novae V 1493 Aql and V 2362 Cyg {{were known}} to exhibit unprecedented large-amplitude rebrightening during the late stage of their evolution. We analyzed common properties in these two light curves. We show that these unusual light curves are very well expressed {{by a combination of}} power-law decline, omnipresent in fast novae, and exponential brightening. We propose a <b>schematic</b> <b>interpretation</b> of the properties common to these rebrightenings can be a consequence of a shock resulting from a secondary ejection and its breakout in the optically thick nova winds. This interpretation has an advantage in explaining the rapid fading following the rebrightening and the subsequent evolution of the light curve. The exponential rise might reflect emerging light from the shock front, analogous to a radiative precursor in a supernova shock breakout. The consequence of such a shock in the nova wind potentially explains many kinds of unusual phenomena in novae including early-stage variations and potentially dust formation. ...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, human {{cognition}} {{and knowledge}} structure have been extensively investigated {{in terms of}} schemata (e. g., Anderson, 1984 a; Rumelhart, 1980). Schemata are {{claimed to be the}} basic units of human knowledge. A schema is defined as “an organized body of knowledge, conceived theoretically as a set of interconnected propositions centering around a general concept, and linked peripherally with other concepts (Gagne, 1986, p. 12) ”. It has been demonstrated by schema research (e. g., Pichert & Anderson, 1977) that the schemata existing in a person's knowledge structure influence the way newly-coming information is interpreted and acquired. Schema theory explains interrial conditions of learning, which can be applied in instructional design in various ways. In this paper, <b>schematic</b> <b>interpretation</b> of human cognition is first related to human capabilities, for which instruction is designed.

40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{the question of}} how to interpret phonological fillers, i. e., phonological elements with no or uncertain semantic content, in children¿s early language development. The goal is to explore the possibilities of establishing criteria for identifying each filler as an approximation to a grammatical word, as a protogrammatical morpheme or placeholder, and/or only as a phonological filler related to salient prosodic patterns of the language. The data are taken from a study of the phonological development of two Norwegian children, one of which used a lot of fillers in the form of inserting a vowel before and/or between her interpretable words. In the light of this child¿s development, a set of criteria for establishing the filler¿s grammatical status at different levels of specificity are proposed, based on how closely the filler matches a possible adult target distributionally and phonologically. When no grammatical interpretation can be given according to these criteria, the filler can only be interpreted phonologically, as an attempt to fit the salient prosodic patterns of the language. Such a prosodic interpretation is seen as the most basic or <b>schematic</b> <b>interpretation,</b> since the prosodic pattern is there the whole time as a baseline, also for those elements that may in addition be interpreted grammatically. Finally, the possible interaction during the process of acquisition between prosody on the one hand and morphology and syntax on the other is discussed in the light of the Norwegian data...|$|E

Understanding and knowledge of how two year old children’s cognition develops continues to remains an under researched area. A key achievement of this thesis is its contribution to the understanding of how two-year-old children use schemas to construct knowledge from their lived experiences This thesis contributes new knowledge through the detailed written and photographic illustrations, which portray how through day-to-day experiences four two-year-old children’s schemas are constructed and co-ordinated. This thesis also identifies what kinds of environments and pedagogy can support two-year old children’s schematic explorations and development. The thesis first reviews the literature highlighting the “preciousness” (Atherton, 2013 : 6) of experiences children gain in their first few years of childhood. Followed by a critical examination of how recent research findings have intertwined to influence the evolving early years landscape. Methodological and ethical issues are identified and discussed. The thesis presents four case studies written as narrative stories of the children’s day-to-day experiences at nursery and home. Drawing mainly from Atherton, (2013); Nutbrown (2011); Athey (2007) and the various work of Piaget (1953, 1959) the stories are analysed to suggest a viable <b>schematic</b> <b>interpretation</b> of the possible developing cognitive patterns.

40|$|International audienceMechanisms of formation, stabilization, liberation, {{transport}} and deposition of nanoparticles {{and their relationship}} to contaminant transport remain scarcely investigated in natural porous media. This study investigated nanoparticles mobilized in the pore space of a French vineyard soil by observing mobile soilderived organic matter (SOM) and minerals in pore fluids over an 8 -month monitoring period. Samples were collected in situ and investigated by transmission electron microscopy coupled to electron-dispersive spectroscopy. The main types of nanoparticles transported within the soil were clay, bacteria, SOM and nanoaggregates. Nanometric clay particles were enriched in various metals (Fe, Zn, As and Pb) and organicallyderived constituents. Analyses of bacteria showed enrichments in Pb. SOM consisted of small carbon-based particles (< 200 nm) with slight enrichments in various metals. The fourth dominant particle type consisted of the association of particles forming organo-mineral nanoaggregates. Based on the study of more than 22 500 individual particles, we propose a <b>schematic</b> <b>interpretation</b> of the evolution of the distribution of particles with depth in a soil profile. The increase of nanoaggregates with depth in the soil seemed to be largely controlled by the ionic strength of soil water and soil hydrodynamics. Seasonal variations in temperature also appear to affect nanoaggregation. Based on the architecture of the nanoaggregates, we propose an improvement of pre-existing models of microaggregation by focusing on early aggregation stages suggesting the importance of bacteria and electrostatic interactions. The process of nanoaggregation can enhance the net reactivity of soil with respect to transported suspended matter, including heavy metals, and can initiate the process of C sequestratio...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this inquiry was to explore how Central American {{immigrant}} women experienced and gave meaning to the phenomenon of adult learning in the Midwestern United States. Data collection followed Seidman 2 ̆ 7 s (1998) model for in-depth phenomenological interviewing, which combined interviews informed by the methodologies of life story and phenomenology. Three in-depth {{interviews were conducted with}} five Central American immigrant women living in a Midwestern metropolitan area. These interviews were tape-recorded and transcribed verbatim. The transcripts were crafted into first-person narratives that captured the participants 2 ̆ 7 life stories of learning. The transcripts were also inductively analyzed through a process that included naming topics, developing categories, and identifying themes. This analysis led to identifying common themes and major domains. Findings were represented in two ways: (1) five life stories of learning in Spanish with full English translations, and (2) eleven themes supported by quotations in Spanish with corresponding English translations.;The life stories reconstructed the women 2 ̆ 7 s learning experiences from childhood to adulthood and illustrated a shift between country of origin and receiving country. Key concepts in Elder 2 ̆ 7 s (1995) life course paradigm proved useful for interpreting similarities and differences among the participants 2 ̆ 7 life stories. Six patterns revealed interacting factors that contributed to shaping the participants 2 ̆ 7 self-concepts as learners and perceptions of learning: (1) historical change and timing; (2) socioeconomic status, rural or urban setting, and family composition; (3) gender socialization; (4) linked lives; (5) context of reception; and (6) human agency.;The themes uncovered three domains in the participants 2 ̆ 7 experiences and perceptions of adult learning in the receiving country: Concept, Process, and Outcome. Especially revealing was that the participants 2 ̆ 7 learning processes were continuous, informal and incidental, experiential, and relational. These findings underscored the influence of both internal and external factors on adult learning processes.;The inquiry offers a <b>schematic</b> <b>interpretation</b> of the findings that suggests that the phenomenon of adult learning was intimately bound to the participants 2 ̆ 7 immigration experiences and shaped by the interplay of four elements: (1) Learner Identity, (2) U.

40|$|Superlatives {{come with}} presuppositions. The {{sentence}} in (1), for instance, presupposes that John is a linguist Peter knows. (1) John is the tallest linguist Peter knows. Standard theories analyse the superlative morphology-est in (1) as expressing a ternary relation between John, tall {{and a set}} of alternatives: the set of linguists Peter knows. The sentence is true if John is taller than the everyone in the set of alternatives (minus John himself). It moreover presupposes that John is among these particular linguists. This is based on the following <b>schematic</b> <b>interpretation</b> (cf. Heim 1999). (2) -est (x) (P) (X) is true if and only if x is P-er than any other y in X (3) -est(x) (P) (X) presupposes that x has property X 2 Modals in the set of alternatives Now consider: (4) The fastest you are allowed to drive is 100 km/h. (5) The fastest you should drive is 100 km/h. There are two puzzling things about these examples: (i) they mean the same, {{despite the fact that the}} modals they include have different modal force (existential for allow and (weakly) universal for should) and (ii) they have the same presupposition: both (4) and (5) presuppose that 100 km/h is an permitted speed. Crucially, (5) does not presuppose that 100 km/h is a speed you should drive at. It is not unlikely that the explanation for the fact that (4) and (5) are synonymous should be sought in the fact that should is a neg-raising verb. Note first that (2) is equivalent to (6). (6) -est (x) (P) (X) is true if and only if any y that is P-er than x is such that it is not the case that y is in X If we now assume that the relative clause provides the set of alternatives, as in Howard 2013, then this yields the following sketch for an analysis of (4) and (5), where the scope of negation in (8) is lower than what is compositionally provided, in line with the neg-raising property of should. (7) 100 km/h is such that any faster speed is a speed you are not allowed to drive (8) 100 km/h is such that any faster speed is a speed you should not drive at This sketch of course lacks an explanation of how the implicit negation in-est can come to be involved in neg-raising, but an account along these lines correctly predicts that other neg-raising verbs yield similar readings, which seem accurate (see below) ...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{concerns}} {{the treatment of}} actuality in film and television, particularly the narrativization of actuality images, and {{the context of their}} placement within audio/visual texts. Several instances of the convergence of media form and genre are analyzed, and the conventions of classificatory systems and boundaries that pertain to film and television representations are reconsidered in light of changes in the conventions of genre. The distinction between, and convergence of fictional and non-fictional conventions of narrative are therefore central to the thesis, as are the related issues of viewer response, the nature of subjectivity in the viewer, the connectivity of text and culture, and the relations of actuality to the text. The thesis traces the narrativization of actuality through textual, formal and genre boundaries, adopting a ‘line of flight or deterritorialization’ that enables the thesis to ‘change in nature and connect with other multiplicities. ’This line of flight passes through the conventional separation of genre groupings and texts, and, similarly, has been applied in the thesis as a rationale for the diminution of theoretical boundaries. A multiperpectival approach is applied to the permeability of, or transcendent relations of the analysis to the boundaries between genres, between texts and culture, and between actuality and virtual representation. In the thesis there is also a theoretical deterritorialization that consents to a pluralism of theory, which is an approach demonstrated by Deleuze and Guattari in A Thousand Plateaus. The model of multi-perspectivalism adopted in the thesis engages in establishing connections and similarities between theories, rather than emphasizing contradictory and exclusive practices. The Foucauldian notion of the rules of formation in discourse, Nichols’ theories of documentary representation of reality, Bordwell’s <b>schematic</b> <b>interpretation,</b> and several other positions are critiqued, as the line of flight embarked upon in the thesis intersects with, and passes through both textual and theoretical boundaries. The thesis consists of two parts: firstly, a location of theoretical perspective, in which the issues of theory pertaining to actuality and narrative are explicated, and the methodological approach of the thesis is defined. The second part commences with an analysis of the most familiar instances of actuality in film and television, with particular attention to documentary forms. It then engages in the analysis of films that represent actuality but which, in the process of narrativization, display a convergence of genre conventions. The films selected for analysis include Steven Speilberg 2 ̆ 7 s Schindler 2 ̆ 7 s List, (1993) Oliver Stone 2 ̆ 7 s JFK, (1991) and Robert Zemeckis 2 ̆ 7 Forrest Gump, (1994) and Contact, (1996). Hence the thesis is concerned with the application of a pluralist theoretical approach, with, however, an emphasis on the Deleuzo-Guattarian notions of rhizome and assemblage. Within this theoretical frame, the connections between actuality and the audio/visual text are explicated, and the formation of text as ‘a rhizome with the world’, is analyzed across a range of examples...|$|E
