40|$|Real life {{problems}} such as scheduling meeting between people at different locations can be modelled as distributed Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs). Suitable and satisfactory solutions can then be found using constraint satisfaction algorithms which can be exhaustive (backtracking) or otherwise (local search). However, most {{research in this area}} tested their algorithms by simulation on a single PC with a <b>single</b> program <b>entry</b> <b>point.</b> The main contribution of our work is the design and implementation of a truly distributed constraint solver based on a local search algorithm using Java Agent DEvelopment framework (JADE) to enable communication between agents on different machines. Particularly, we discuss design and implementation issues related to truly distributed constraint solver which might not be critical when simulated on a single machine. Evaluation results indicate that our truly distributed constraint solver works well within the observed limitations when tested with various distributed CSPs. Our application can also incorporate any constraint solving algorithm with little modifications. Comment: 7 page...|$|R

40|$|Sphingolipids {{constitute}} {{a class of}} lipids defined by their eighteen carbon amino-alcohol backbones which are synthesized in the ER from nonsphingolipid precursors. Modification of this basic structure is what {{gives rise to the}} vast family of sphingolipids that play significant roles in membrane biology and provide many bioactive metabolites that regulate cell function. Despite the diversity of structure and function of sphingolipids, their creation and destruction are governed by common synthetic and catabolic pathways. In this regard, sphingolipid metabolism can be imagined as an array of interconnected networks that diverge from a <b>single</b> common <b>entry</b> <b>point</b> and converge into a single common breakdown pathway. In their simplest forms, sphingosine, phytosphingosine and dihydrosphingosine serve as the backbones upon which further complexity is achieved. For example, phosphorylation of the C 1 hydroxyl group yields the final breakdown products and/or the important signaling molecules sphingosine- 1 -phosphate, phytosphingosine- 1 -phosphate and dihydrosphingosine- 1 -phosphate, respectively. On the other hand, acylation of sphingosine, phytosphingosine, or dihydrosphingosine with one of several possible acyl CoA molecules through the action of distinct ceramide synthases produces the molecules defined a...|$|R

40|$|This study {{provides}} {{an examination of}} governance issues arising in residential golf communities. A residential golf community {{can be referred to}} as a multi titled golf development (MTGD) where separately titled houses and a golf course coexist within an identifiable estate that typically has a <b>single</b> road <b>entry</b> <b>point.</b> The study's objectives are to outline typical governance arrangements concerning the assignment of rights between accommodation owners and golf course entities in Queensland MTGDs, and to explore the nature of governance challenges arising in connection with the assignment of rights between these two parties. Drawing on qualitative data collected from thirteen interviews with Queensland-based developer representatives and body corporate managers experienced in MTGDs, it has been found that there is a legislative trend towards accommodation owners experiencing diminished levels of influence on golf course management and operations. All interviewees felt this to be the most appropriate model for future MTGDs. It is nevertheless noted that this development signifies a degree of neighbourhood disenfranchisement for residential owners and that a poorly managed golf course can negatively influence residential property values and political harmony in an MTGD.

40|$|Utilities in the U. S. operate over 75, 000 km (47, 000 miles) of old {{cast-iron}} pipes for gas distribution. Bell-and-spigot joints {{that connect}} pipe sections together tend to leak as these pipes age. Current repair practices are costly and highly disruptive. The {{objective of this}} program is to design, test and commercialize a robotic system capable of sealing multiple castiron bell and spigot joints from a <b>single</b> pipe <b>entry</b> <b>point.</b> The proposed system will perform repairs with the pipe in service by traveling through the pipe, cleaning each joint surface, and installing a stainless-steel sleeve lined with an epoxy-impregnated felt across the joint. This approach will save considerable time and labor, minimize excavation, avoid traffic disruption, and eliminate any requirement to interrupt service to customers (which would result in enormous expense to utilities). Technical challenges include: (1) repair sleeves must compensate for diametric variation and eccentricity of old cast-iron pipes; (2) the assembly must travel long distances through pipes containing debris; (3) the pipe wall must be effectively cleaned in the immediate area of the joint to assure good bonding of the sleeve; and (4) an innovative bolt-on entry fitting is required to conduct safe repair operations on live mains...|$|R
50|$|The long-planned {{fortification}} of {{the town}} was finally {{set in motion by}} Louis XVI of France. In 1776, he set up a commission to choose between Cherbourg, Ambleteuse or Boulogne as France's main strategic port for defence of the English Channel - this was headed by Suffren and also including Dumouriez (later governor of Cherbourg) and La Bretonnière. La Bretonnière's report considered that only Cherbourg had a harbour large enough for 80 warships at once. Exceeding Vauban's designs, he planned the construction of a 4 km long harbour wall between île Pelée and pointe de Querqueville. Dumouriez and Decaux, head of the engineers, advised that Louis build a shorter harbour in a straight line between île Pelée and pointe du Hommet, as foreseen by Vauban, with a <b>single</b> central <b>entry</b> <b>point,</b> with the emphasis on military defences. In the end La Bretonnière's plan won, but during the construction phase Decaux argued for the merits of concrete masonry caissons whereas La Bretonnière preferred sinking old warships and building up rock around them. However, the engineer Louis-Alexandre de Cessart's plans were chosen, which involved constructing a mole from 90 tree trunks 20m by 20m, filled in with stones and linked by iron chains.|$|R
