5|$|Having {{successfully}} {{dealt with}} the major challenges and issues involved in forming a new state government, Shelby left the state safe and financially sound. Kentucky's constitution prevented a governor from serving consecutive terms, so Shelby retired to Traveler's Rest, his Lincoln County estate, {{at the conclusion of}} his term in 1796. For the next 15 years he tended to affairs on his farm. He was selected as a presidential elector in <b>six</b> <b>consecutive</b> elections, but these were his only appearances in public life during this period.|$|E

The divide between McCreary and Beckham was short-lived, however, and Beckham supported McCreary's election to a second term as governor in 1911.|$|E
