50|$|The Sepung {{bridge is}} a curved {{one with a}} radius of 2000m. In {{order to reduce the}} {{deformation}} of the pylons {{toward the center of the}} circle, two cables are established from the top to the bottom of the pylon. It is also effective for increasing the torsional rigidity. This bridge is designed to accommodate dual four-lane traffic; its design incorporates a curved stiffening girder and additional transverse cables to stabilize each tower. The striffening girder is designed as a PC box using reinforced concrete of grade 40MPa; It is 3.3m deep and almost 24m wide, and incorporates steel struts and FRP pipe struts filled with concrete in the internal and external box respectively, to resist the local tensile stress. These internal and external struts are placed at typical centers of 6m and 3m respectively and give the stiffening girder and increased torsional rigidity and make the decks 20% lighter than a traditional concrete box girder. In this bridge, a single plane multiple cable system with harp arrangement was chosen in order to reduce the longitudinal and transverse deformation of the towers. As the <b>shear</b> <b>center</b> deviates from the center of the stiffening girder due to the application of the asymmetric cable forces and self-weight, twisting and transverse deformation may occur.|$|E
40|$|Presented are {{the results}} of an {{investigation}} of the twisting/warping deformation occurring in open-section composite beams. A series of C and L channels were manufactured using both hand layup and the innovative 'hot-drape forming' techniques. A transverse tip load was applied at the free end of the cantilevered open-section beams. The test setup allowed the tip load to be applied at various locations along the plane of and at the beam's <b>shear</b> <b>center.</b> Charts are included in this report depicting various angles of ply layups, loads applied, and load application points. A major verification resulting from this study is that the <b>shear</b> <b>center</b> of an open section composite beam can be altered, if not completely controlled, through laminate layup. Also, it was observed that the choice of the material system does not {{have an effect on the}} amount of deformation, as expected, and the material affects the location of an unsymmetric open section composite beam's true <b>shear</b> <b>center.</b> The results from this study have provided a foundation for further investigation into the apparent shifting of the <b>shear</b> <b>center</b> location in open-section composite beams...|$|E

40|$|In this work, {{we present}} a finite element {{formulation}} for the Saint-Venant torsion and bending problems for prismatic beams. The torsion problem formulation {{is based on the}} warping function, and can handle multiply-connected regions (including thin-walled structures), compound and anisotropic bars. Similarly, the bending formulation, which is based on linearized elasticity theory, can handle multiply-connected domains including thin-walled sections. The torsional rigidity and <b>shear</b> <b>centers</b> can be found as special cases of these formulations. Numerical results are presented to show the good coarse-mesh accuracy of both the formulations for both the displacement and stress fields. The stiffness matrices and load vectors (which are similar to those for a variable body force in a conventional structural mechanics problem) in both formulations involve only domain integrals, which makes them simple to implement and computationally efficient.

40|$|It is {{the purpose}} of this study to examine {{theoretically}} the effect of flange and web taper on the lateral stability of a cantilever I-beam loaded with a point load at its end in the plane of maximum flexural rigidity.

The governing differential equations are derived and the method of finite differences is used to solve the problems. Three cases are studied: load at the top flange, at the <b>shear</b> <b>center,</b> and at the bottom flange.

40|$|The Wagner Hypothesis {{states that}} when a {{thin-walled}} open-profile member is subjected to an axial loading leading to global instability, the longitudinal stresses developing within the fibers composing the cross-section become inclined to the normal plane; thus taking on a helical shape {{with respect to the}} longitudinal axis of the member. It is assumed that the longitudinal fiber stresses act as "follower-forces" and thus assume the same inclination as the cross-sectional fibers and thus produce a torsional moment about the longitudinal axis of the member. Classical second-order theories for calculating critical buckling loads based on the line of <b>shear</b> <b>centers</b> for thin-walled open-profile members have been developed by Timoshenko and Vlasov, which include the use of the Wagner effect. However, a competing theory has been developed by Ojalvo that utilizes the line of cross-sectional centroids (rather than cross-sectional <b>shear</b> <b>centers)</b> as a reference axis {{while at the same time}} rejecting the use of the Wagner Hypothesis. Ojalvo proposes that the Wagner Hypothesis violates common statical principles as well as is deficient for not identifying the free body with which torsional equilibrium is expressed. The current study explored the validity of the second-order theories using nonlinear finite element techniques to produce critical buckling loads for various thin-walled open-profile members. Critical buckling loads obtained from this analysis were compared with numerical results provided by each theory as well as experimental results. Not only did the present research evaluate the behavior of various torsional members at their critical buckling loads, but it also explored the notion that the principal stresses take on a helical shape once torsion has occurred (i. e. the stresses do indeed behave as "follower-forces") using graphical representations of the members created within the finite element software. Conclusions were made based on the comparison of finite element results compared with theoretical results and experimental tests. The current study found that the Wagner Hypothesis is valid due to positive agreement between finite element results, numerical solutions, and experimental tests. Recommendations were made concerning the possibility of further research regarding this topic...|$|R

40|$|Advanced {{scenarios}} in tokamaks seek {{to maximize}} the confinement and stability of thermonuclear plasmas. Key to obtaining these conditions is operation at different current density profiles. Experiments at ASDEX Upgrade are reported with approximately zero magnetic <b>shear</b> in the <b>center</b> or reversed magnetic <b>shear</b> in the <b>center.</b> With zero magnetic shear and q(0) near 1, stationary conditions are obtained in discharges without saw-teeth at 800 kA and I MA and q(95) = 3. 3 to 4. 5, {{using a combination of}} central neutral beam injection (NBI) heating and off-axis NBI heating. In this regime, the temperature profiles are stiff. Central heating with ion cyclotron resonance heating and electron cyclotron resonance heating can be used to prevent excessive density peaking {{to maximize the}} stability against neoclassical tearing modes and to prevent impurity accumulation. At a lower plasma current of 400 kA with 10 MW of NBI heating, the boot-strap current fraction in this regime is above 50 % giving, with the NBI current drive, nearly fully noninductively driven conditions. Operation tit average electron densities of 80 to 90 % of the Greenwald density limit is obtained at a triangularity of delta = 0. 43 achieving beta(N) = 3. 5 in stationary conditions. Moreover, in these plasmas, type II edge-localized modes are observed in configurations close to double null. In plasmas with a reversed magnetic <b>shear</b> in the <b>center,</b> the formation of ion transport barriers with NBI heating was optimized to obtain more reproducible transport barriers with an H-mode edge for maximum stability, achieving, transiently, beta(N) values of 4.

Due to the proximity of a large upper-level low-pressure area in the southern Gulf of Mexico, the surrounding environment did not favor intensification.
