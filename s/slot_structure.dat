40|$|Ground plane slot {{structures}} {{have been}} shown to reduce coupling between cosited antennas. Although some such structures have already been reported, no analytical model exists to describe their behavior and there are no design guidelines. In this work, the behavior of reported ground plane structures is used as a clue to obtain generalizable information about such structures' behavior. The structures' scalability and excitation behavior is investigated. Next a circuit model is derived that describes the interaction of microstrip patch antennas with a ground plane <b>slot</b> <b>structure</b> based on mutual admittances between the ground plane slots and the effective slots at the antennas' radiating edges. The circuit model leads to design guidelines for the ground plane <b>slot</b> <b>structure</b> and an approximate relationship between mutual admittances which must be satisfied in order to isolate the antennas. Finally, we present a novel ground plane <b>slot</b> <b>structure</b> that mitigates some of the disadvantages of earlier designs...|$|E

In this work, a slotted harmonic model is implemented for a benchmark IM topology and a method to calculate the induced rotor bar current is investigated. The calculation results are validated by comparison to Finite Element simulations. It is shown that a good agreement is obtained for unsaturated operating conditions...|$|R

40|$|Several {{well known}} {{analytical}} techniques {{exist for the}} force profile analysis of permanent magnet linear synchronous motors (PMLSM). These techniques, however, make significant simplifications {{in order to obtain}} the magnetic field distribution in the air gap. From the field distribution the force profile can be found. These widely used techniques provide a reasonable approximation for force profile analysis, but fail to give really accurate results {{in the sense of the}} exact shape of the force profile caused by effects that due to simplification are not fully included. To obtain the exact shape for the force profile in these cases, computational expensive finite element method (FEM) is often applied. In this paper an elegant semi-analytical approach is presented to acquire the force profile. First, the magnetic field distribution in the air gap is determined by means of Schwarz-Christoffel (SC) mapping. The SC mapping allows a <b>slotted</b> <b>structure</b> of the machine to be mapped to a geometrically simpler domain for which analytic solutions are available. Subsequently, the field solution in the <b>slotted</b> <b>structure</b> can be determined by applying the mapping function to the field distribution in the simplified domain.
