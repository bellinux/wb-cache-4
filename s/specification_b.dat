30|$|In the {{remaining}} panels of the table, I decompose {{the population of}} native workers by job contract. <b>Specifications</b> <b>B</b> 1 to B 4 focus on the population of native workers under indefinite-term contracts, while specifications C 1 to C 4 study the population of native workers under fixed-term contracts. 17 For panels B and C, I first implement a basic regression {{that is similar to}} specification A 1. As explained in Borjas (2003) and Bratsberg et al. (2014), the evolution of the immigrant share over time may be driven by changes in the native labor supply (as the number of natives in the workforce is at the denominator of the immigrant share). <b>Specifications</b> <b>B</b> 2 and C 2 thus control for this possibility and include the log of the number of natives in the workforce as additional regressor. In <b>specifications</b> <b>B</b> 3 and C 3, I restrict the analysis to experience groups between 10 and 35  years to show, in particular, that our results are not driven by the fact that native workers under fixed-term contracts tend to be disproportionately young. The last <b>specification</b> of panels <b>B</b> and C test the robustness of the results to an alternative definition of immigrant penetration within a skill group. Instead of using the share of immigrants in the labor force, <b>specifications</b> <b>B</b> 4 and C 4 use the log ratio between the number of immigrants and the number of natives in the workforce. As a result, the estimated coefficients in <b>specifications</b> <b>B</b> 4 and C 4 have to be interpreted as elasticities.|$|R

30|$|Despite {{their higher}} {{probability}} of being employed, Ukrainian migrants are strongly penalized {{in terms of}} hourly wage (see Table  12) 12. In the case of comparison with Italians, being Ukrainian carries a significantly larger negative impact than being Moldovan or Romanian in the whole population (specification (a) of Table  12). In the case of women (<b>specification</b> (<b>b)</b> of Table  12) the negative impact is even larger, and significantly different from being Moldovan, Romanian or Polish.|$|E
30|$|The estimations {{provided}} in panel B {{are consistent with}} those {{provided in}} panel A. First, the share of immigrants has no impact on native wages. This indicates that the population of native workers under indefinite-term contracts is protected from wage losses. Second, the IV-estimated coefficients displayed in column (2) show that immigration does affect the fraction of time worked by the natives who remain in their jobs. Third, the inverse and significant relationship between immigration and employment remains: an immigrant-induced increase {{in the size of the}} workforce in a skill group decreases the employment rate of natives in that group. A 10  % rise in the immigrant labor supply in a skill group decreases the native employment rate to labor force in that group by 9.2  % (according to <b>specification</b> <b>B</b> 1) and 12.0  % (according to <b>specification</b> <b>B</b> 4). As explained in Section  2.2, firms may replace the natives under indefinite-term contracts who leave their jobs by immigrants. This substitution mechanism could be profitable for firms, especially because immigrants tend to accept lower wages and exert more effort in production than equally skilled natives (Malchow‐Møller et al. 2012; Edo 2015).|$|E

Our notion stems from a natural dichotomy found in programming practice between ordinary pointers forming spanning trees and auxiliary pointers cutting across.

The combination of StAC and B provides a rich formal notation which allows for succinct and precise specification of business transactions. BPEL is an industry standard language for specifying business transactions and includes compensation constructs.

The results from the case are evaluated using SEQUAL, a semiotic quality framework for the evaluation of models, modeling languages and modeling environments.
