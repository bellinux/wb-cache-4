50|$|Alcoholic {{hepatitis}} {{is distinct}} from cirrhosis caused by long-term alcohol consumption. Alcoholic hepatitis can occur in patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease and alcoholic cirrhosis. Alcoholic hepatitis by itself {{does not lead to}} cirrhosis, but cirrhosis is more common in patients with long term alcohol consumption. Some alcoholics develop acute hepatitis as an inflammatory reaction to the cells affected by fatty change. This is not directly related to the dose of alcohol. Some people seem more prone to this reaction than others. This is called alcoholic <b>steatonecrosis</b> and the inflammation probably predisposes to liver fibrosis.|$|E
40|$|Acute {{pancreatitis}} was induced in 139 Wistar rats by {{injection of}} trypsin {{in the common}} bilio-pancreatic duct. Peritoneal dialysis was performed in 93 rats. In some of these rats, aprotinin (250, 000 UI/L) {{was added to the}} lavage fluid. Macroscopically, we noted the amount of <b>steatonecrosis,</b> pulmonary congestion and pleural effusion produced. The pancreatic and pulmonary lesions were studied microscopically. The effect of peritoneal dialysis with and without aprotinin on the survival rate was evaluated. Survival curves were established for the different groups of rats i. e. the non-treated group and the two groups of dialysed rats (with and without aprotinin). Peritoneal dialysis reduces the amount of <b>steatonecrosis</b> and the incidence of pulmonary complications of trypsin-induced pancreatitis in rats, but does not influence the pancreatic lesions. Peritoneal dialysis significantly improves the early survival rate. Addition of aprotinin to the dialysis fluid reduces the total mortality rate...|$|E

40|$|A liver-specific, {{water-soluble}} autoantigen (F-antigen) {{was detected}} by double diffu-ion using specifically prepared antiserum in thirty of 285 adult serum samples tested. F-antigen was found most frequently in disorders associated with hepatocellular destruction such as metastatic cancers (four of eleven patients) and viral hepatitis (eight of twenty-five). It was also found in serum from patients with cirrhosis (three of twenty-eight), <b>steatonecrosis</b> (two of thirteen) and hepatocellular carcinoma (two of eleven). These preliminary results suggest that further study of F-antigen in human disease states is warranted...|$|E
40|$|In CCl 4 induced hepatotoxicity, besides <b>steatonecrosis,</b> {{fibrosis}} also develops which evolves to cirrhosis. Such fibrosis may {{be linked}} to oxidative stress. In fact, lipid peroxidation induced in vitro in hepatic stellate cells (HSC, the major source of matrix proteins) or the treatment of the latter with 4 -hydroxynonenal or malonaldehyde stimulates expression of procollagen gene and synthesis of TGFbeta 1. F 2 -isoprostanes (F 2 -Iso) are considered the most reliable markers of oxidative stress and are also mediators of important biological effects. Since aldehydic lipid peroxidation products seem to induce collagen expression, we have investigated whether analogue effects are induced by F 2 -Iso, which present receptors able to elicit definite signal transduction pathways. In a rat model of chronic CCl 4 intoxication leading to fibrosis, plasma F 2 -Iso were elevated for the entire experimental period. HSC from normal liver were cultured up to activation and then treated for 48 h with F 2 -Iso in the range of the concentrations found in the in vivo studies (10 - 8 to 10 - 9 M). F 2 -Iso induced marked increase in cell proliferation as well as increase in collagen synthesis. Total collagen content was similarly increased. Therefore, F 2 -Iso generated by lipid peroxidation in hepatocytes may mediate the HSC proliferation and collagen hyperproduction seen in hepatic fibrosis...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Introduction Mesenteric panniculitis of the {{sigmoid colon}} {{is a rare}} {{occurrence}} in surgical practice. The aim {{of this article is}} to present a case of mesenteric panniculitis of the sigmoid colon and a short review of the literature. Case presentation We reviewed the hospital record of a 63 -year-old man who presented with a palpable mass in the left abdomen and clinical signs of a partial bowel obstruction. The pre-operative impression was a possible cancer of the sigmoid colon. A laparotomy was performed through a midline incision. The mesentery was found to be markedly thickened, constricted and puckered. The normal architecture of the adipose tissue had been lost and replaced with an irregular nodular mass. The microscopic pathologic sections demonstrated a chronic reactive inflammatory process with an exuberant proliferation of fibroblasts and fibrocytes. The adipose tissue contained scattered areas of <b>steatonecrosis</b> with foci of lipid-laden macrophages, lymphocytes and plasma cells. The sigmoid colon and its mesocolon were resected. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged in good condition, and followed up for the next two years. Conclusion Mesenteric panniculitis of sigmoid is an extremely rare entity of unknown origin in which the normal architecture of the mesentery is replaced by fibrosis, necrosis and calcification. On gross examination the alterations may be mistaken for a neoplastic process. A frozen section may be necessary for confirmation of the diagnosis. When the advanced inflammatory changes became irreversible and bowel obstruction occurs, resection may be indicated. </p...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{develop an}} {{experimental}} model of severe acute pancreatitis in rabbits through a pancreatic ductal injection of sodium taurocholate. METHODS: Twenty-four albino rabbits of the New Zealand lineage were distributed into four groups of six animals (A, B, C and S). The rabbits of three experimental groups (A, B and C) were {{submitted to a}} laparatomy and received a pancreatic ductal injection of 1 ml/kg sodium taurocholate 5 %. Also, they were submitted to further laparatomies after 4 h, 8 h and 12 h, respectively. The control group (S) was subdivided into two groups of three animals: in subgroup S 1 only the pancreatic duct catheterization was performed whereas in subgroup S 2 the pancreatic duct catheterization {{as well as an}} injection of 1 ml/kg physiologic solution 0. 9 % were carried out. After 12 hours, the rabbits were evaluated. In the re-intervention, blood was collected to determine the amylasemia and a pancreatectomy was carried out to investigate interstitial infiltration, <b>steatonecrosis</b> and necrosis of the organ, using an optical microscope. RESULTS: There was an elevation of amylase in all groups thus proving the existence of acute pancreatitis. The size of the interlobular septum increased progressively with a greater variation between group S 1 (0. 13) and group C (0. 53) (p= 0. 035). While all the animals in group A exhibited focal cellular necrosis, it was more intense in the rabbits of group B and culminated with a high proportion of severe pancreatic necrosis in group C animals. The difference in the intensity of cellular necrosis showed statistic significance (p= 0. 001). CONCLUSION: The proposed experimental model demonstrated its reproducibility and effectiveness in producing severe acute pancreatitis in rabbits...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackground: Intestinal barrier {{disruption}} {{followed by}} bacterial translocation seems {{to play a}} role in secondary pancreatic infection in acute pancreatitis. The use of probiotics as a possible adjuvant strategy in the treatment of acute pancreatitis needs to be investigated. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the effects of dietary supplementation with a prophylactically administered multispecies probiotic mixture on the markers of acute pancreatitis and on the occurrence of bacterial translocation. Methods: Thirty adult male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups of 10 rats each: (1) the PS group, in which the rats were given probiotic supplementation prior to induction of acute pancreatitis; (2) the WP group, in which the rats underwent surgery to induce acute pancreatitis without prior probiotic supplementation; and (3) the control group, in which the rats underwent sham surgery. For 14 days before surgery, animals in the PS group received a single daily dose containing ~ 1. 2 × 109 colony-forming units of a probiotic mixture administered intragastrically as a bolus. On day 15, the animals underwent surgery to induce acute pancreatitis (PS and WP groups) or simulated surgery (control group). Blood samples were collected to determine leukocyte count, amylase and lipase activities, and glucose and calcium concentrations immediately before and 6 and 12 hours after the beginning of the procedure. Samples of pancreas, spleen, liver, and mesenteric lymph nodes were harvested for microbiologic and histopathologic analysis after the last blood sample collection. The pathologist examining the histopathology was blinded to treatment assignment. Results: The mean leukocyte count was significantly increased in the PS group compared with the WP group (P = 0. 018), whereas the serum amylase and lipase activities and the serum glucose and calcium concentrations were not significantly different between the 2 groups. Comparing the risk for tissue colonization in the PS group with that of the WP group, the odds ratio (OR) for pancreas was 2. 91 (95 % CI, 0. 13 – 67. 10); liver, 66. 55 (95 % CI, 1. 89 – 2282. 66); spleen, 88. 58 (95 % CI, 3. 04 – 2583. 08); and mesenteric lymph nodes, 1. 23 (95 % CI, 0. 06 – 25. 48). When the risks for histopathologic changes were compared between the 2 groups, the OR for acinar necrosis was 1. 73 (95 % CI, 0. 21 – 12. 17); <b>steatonecrosis,</b> 12. 08 (95 % CI, 1. 26 – 115. 54); hemorrhage, 1. 38 (95 % CI, 0. 21 – 9. 53); and leukocyte infiltration, 5. 91 (95 % CI, 0. 64 – 54. 89). Conclusion: Probiotic supplementation before the induction of acute pancreatitis was associated with a greater degree of bacterial translocation and pancreatic tissue damage in this animal model...|$|E

OBJETIVO: Desenvolver modelo experimental de pancreatite aguda grave em coelhos por meio da injeção de taurocolato de sódio no ducto pancreático. MÉTODOS: Vinte e quatro coelhos albinos da linhagem Nova Zelândia foram distribuídos em quatro grupos de seis animais (A, B, C e S). Os coelhos dos três grupos experimentais (A, B e C) foram submetidos a laparotomia e injetou-se taurocolato de sódio a 5 %, 1 ml/Kg no ducto pancreático. Realizou-se nova laparotomia, respectivamente, após 4 h, 8 h e 12 h. No grupo controle (S), subdividido em dois grupos de três animais, foi realizada no subgrupo S 1 apenas cateterização do ducto pancreático e no subgrupo S 2 cateterização do ducto pancreático e injeção de solução fisiológica 0, 9 %, 1 ml/Kg. Estes animais foram reavaliados após 12 horas. Na reintervenção coletou-se sangue para determinação da amilasemia e realizou-se pancreatectomia para análise histológica do infiltrado intersticial, da esteatonecrose e da necrose do órgão. RESULTADOS: Houve elevação da amilase em todos os grupos, demonstrando a presença da pancreatite aguda. O tamanho do septo interlobular aumentou progressivamente, observando-se maior diferença entre os grupos S 1 (0, 13) e C (0, 53) (p= 0, 035). Todos os animais do grupo A apresentaram necrose celular focal que se tornou mais intensa nos coelhos do grupo B, culminando com o predomínio de necrose pancreática acentuada nos animais do grupo C. A diferença na intensidade da necrose celular apresentou significância estatística (p= 0, 001). CONCLUSÃO: O modelo experimental proposto se mostrou reprodutível e efetivo em provocar pancreatite aguda grave em coelhos.
