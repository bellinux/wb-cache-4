5|$|While most marine {{bioluminescence}} {{is green}} to blue, <b>some</b> <b>deep</b> sea barbeled dragonfishes in the genera Aristostomias, Pachystomias and Malacosteus emit a red glow.

5|$|Many corals in {{the order}} Scleractinia are hermatypic, meaning that they are {{involved}} in building reefs. Most such corals obtain some of their energy from zooxanthellae in the genus Symbiodinium. These are symbiotic photosynthetic dinoflagellates which require sunlight; reef-forming corals are therefore found mainly in shallow water. They secrete calcium carbonate to form hard skeletons that become the framework of the reef. However, not all reef-building corals in shallow water contain zooxanthellae, and <b>some</b> <b>deep</b> water species, living at depths to which light cannot penetrate, form reefs but do not harbour the symbionts.|$|E
5|$|By October 10, 2004, {{an area of}} {{disturbed}} {{weather was}} situated well to the southwest of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. Later that day, a surface low pressure system developed, and convection began to organize into slightly curved bands. The disturbance continued to in this manner, and at 1800 UTC on October 11, the low level circulation had become sufficiently organized to be designated as a tropical depression. At the time, the depression consisted of a well-defined circulation, with <b>some</b> <b>deep</b> thunderstorm activity. Despite weak steering currents, the system started what was initially {{thought to be a}} westward drift, though just a few hours later was found to be towards the northwest. A small cyclone, a burst of deep convection formed at around the same time, and was said could have produced tropical storm-force winds.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} few days of September 2002, an upper-level trough emerged in the Gulf of Mexico and stalled. Thunderstorms {{developed}} along the trough and concentrated around a weak low pressure system. Gradually, the trough and associated low pressure drifted south into the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico. A low pressure area in the northwest Gulf of Mexico became the dominant circulation and slowly developed persistent convection near the center. On September 5, a reconnaissance aircraft investigated the system. During the flight, a low-level center became evident and <b>some</b> <b>deep</b> convection persisted; as a result, it was classified as a tropical depression. Wind shear within the Gulf of Mexico was weak and remained favorable to tropical cyclone formation. A reconnaissance flight later that day discovered an ill-defined circulation which led to low confidence of the location of the center of circulation. However, enough convection persisted for the depression to be upgraded into Tropical Storm Fay that evening.|$|E

25|$|Groundwater: The water {{emerging}} from <b>some</b> <b>deep</b> ground water may have fallen as rain many tens, hundreds, {{or thousands of}} years ago. Soil and rock layers naturally filter the ground water to {{a high degree of}} clarity and often, it does not require additional treatment besides adding chlorine or chloramines as secondary disinfectants. Such water may emerge as springs, artesian springs, or may be extracted from boreholes or wells. Deep ground water is generally of very high bacteriological quality (i.e., pathogenic bacteria or the pathogenic protozoa are typically absent), but the water may be rich in dissolved solids, especially carbonates and sulfates of calcium and magnesium. Depending on the strata through which the water has flowed, other ions may also be present including chloride, and bicarbonate. There may be a requirement to reduce the iron or manganese content of this water to make it acceptable for drinking, cooking, and laundry use. Primary disinfection may also be required. Where groundwater recharge is practiced (a process in which river water is injected into an aquifer to store the water in times of plenty so that it is available in times of drought), the groundwater may require additional treatment depending on applicable state and federal regulations.|$|E

The deepest parts of the ocean mix very slowly with the surface waters, and the mixing is uneven. The main mechanism that brings deep water to the surface is upwelling, which is more common in regions closer to the equator. Upwelling is also influenced by factors such as the topography of the local ocean bottom and coastlines, the climate, and wind patterns. Overall, the mixing of deep and surface waters takes far longer than the mixing of atmospheric [...] with the surface waters, and as a result water from <b>some</b> <b>deep</b> ocean areas has an apparent radiocarbon age of several thousand years. Upwelling mixes this [...] "old" [...] water with the surface water, giving the surface water an apparent age of about several hundred years (after correcting for fractionation).

The effect also applies to marine organisms such as shells, and marine mammals such as whales and seals, which have radiocarbon ages that appear to be hundreds of years old.|$|E
