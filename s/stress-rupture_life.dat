50|$|At {{the time}} that design {{stresses}} were set for the MSRE, the data that was available indicated that the strength and creep rate of Hastelloy-N were hardly affected by irradiation. After the construction was well along, the <b>stress-rupture</b> <b>life</b> and fracture strain {{were found to be}} drastically reduced by thermal neutron irradiation. The MSRE stresses were reanalyzed, and it was concluded that the reactor would have adequate life to reach its goals. At the same time a program was launched to improve the resistance of Hastelloy-N to the embrittlement.|$|E

The engine test consisted of the repetition of a 20 -minute cycle, 15 minutes at rated speed and approximately 5 minutes at idle. The {{results of the investigation}} indicated a direct correlation between <b>stress-rupture</b> <b>life</b> and blade life for the relatively low-strength alloys. The <b>stress-rupture</b> <b>life</b> and blade life for the relatively high-strength alloys did not correlate because {{of the effects of the}} vibratory stresses and the corrosive-gas atmosphere...|$|E

All heating methods were studied using the nickel-based alloy Udimet 700 while all but burner heating were evaluated with the cobalt-based alloy Mar-M 509. Limited test results of eight other superalloys were also included in this study. Resistance heated specimens had about 20 to 30 percent of the <b>stress-rupture</b> <b>life</b> of radiant heated specimens.

40|$|An {{experimental}} oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) alloy {{based on}} the B- 1900 composition was produced by the mechanical alloying process. Without optimization of the processing for the alloy or the alloy for the processing, recrystallization of the extruded product to large elongated grains was achieved. Materials having grain length-width ratios of 3 and 5. 5 were tested in tension and stress-rupture. The ODS B- 1900 exhibited tensile strength {{similar to that of}} cast B- 1900. Its <b>stress-rupture</b> <b>life</b> was lower than that of cast B- 1900 at 760 C. At 1095 C the ODS B- 1900 with the higher grain length-width ratio (5. 5) had <b>stress-rupture</b> <b>life</b> superior to that of cast B- 1900. It was concluded that, with optimization, oxide dispersion strengthening of B- 1900 and other complex cast nickel-base alloys has potential for improving high temperature properties over those of the cast alloy counterparts...|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{behavior of}} particle-strengthened alloys is reviewed. On {{the basis of}} this knowledge, it is concluded that second-phase particles, coherent or incoherent, can enhance the flow strength, creep resistance, and <b>stress-rupture</b> <b>life</b> of alloys. Unfortunately, particles are usually not beneficial alloy-design elements if enhanced uniaxial ductility, plane-strain ductility, stress-rupture ductility, and toughness are called for. Such properties as fatigue-crack propagation resistance appear to require, for example, both high strength and high ductility, a situation which can come to pass only when the perennial conflict between strength and ductility is resolved in particle-strengthened systems in particular and in any other material system in general. Wherever possible, the role of coherent and incoherent particles in alloy design is distinguished...|$|E

40|$|Friction {{welded butt}} joints {{were made in}} both Udimet 700 and TD-Nickel bar. Also, {{dissimilar}} metal friction welds were made between these materials. Friction welding of Udimet 700 shows great promise because the welds {{were found to be}} as strong as the parent metal in stress rupture and tensile tests at 760 and 980 C. The weld line was not detectable metallographically in the heat treated condition. Friction welding for TD-Nickel, however, holds little if any promise.

Effect of the ratios of salt mixtures of Na 2 SO 4 /NaCl and the coating amounts of salt mixtures on the microstructure and the high temperature stress-rupture properties of a corrosion resistant directionally solidified superalloy at 850 ℃/ 500 MPa were investigated. The results demonstrated that the <b>stress-rupture</b> <b>life</b> decreased with the coated salt mixture ratio of Na 2 SO 4 /NaCl changing from 3 : 1 to 9 : 1.

40|$|Abstract. The gamma prime {{precipitation}} strengthening behavior and oxide dispersion strengthening behavior of mechanically alloyed oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) Ni-base superalloys have been investigated. The most important microstructural feature affecting the elevated temperature strength of ODS alloys {{was found to}} be the grain aspect ratio. Grain aspect ratio after zone annealing was sensitively related to the primary grain size in as-extruded Ni-base superalloy. There was a suitable range of primary grain size to obtain a coarse elongated grain structure after zone annealing. The large grain aspect ratio above a critical value of about 20 resulted in an increase in <b>stress-rupture</b> <b>life</b> more than two orders of magnitude at 950 –C. The size and distribution of the gamma prime precipitates were dependent on the solution heat treatment conditions.

40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} Ru on the {{microstructure}} and stress-rupture property were investigated in two experimental Ni-based single crystal superalloys {{with and without}} Ru addition (5. 1 %, mass fraction). The {{results indicate that the}} morphology of γ′ precipitates in the dendrite core and interdendritic region are intermediate and nearly spherical, respectively, in the Ru-free alloy after being aged at 1 100 °C for 8 h. The Re partitioning ratio increases due to Ru addition and Ru partitioned preferentially to the γ phase in both dendrite core and interdendritic region of the Ru-containing alloy, which results in more negative lattice misfit and more cuboidal γ′ precipitates. Meanwhile, the γ′ volume fraction increases while the precipitate size and γ channel width decreases due to Ru addition in both dendrite core and interdendritic region. Ru addition improves the <b>stress-rupture</b> <b>life</b> at 1 100 °C/ 140 MPa significantly due to higher γ′ volume fraction, more negative lattice misfit and a well rafting structure as well as less γ channel width...|$|E
40|$|A {{program was}} {{performed}} to address the mechanical and environmental needs of Stirling engine heater head and regenerator housing components, while reducing the dependence on strategic materials. An alloy was developed which contained no strategic elemental additions per se. The base is iron with additions of manganese, molybdenum, carbon, silicon, niobium, and ferro-chromium. Such an alloy should be producible {{on a large scale}} at very low cost. The resulting alloy, designated as NASAUT 4 G-Al, contained 15 Mn, 15 Cr, 2 Mo, 1. 5 C, 1. 0 Si, 1. 0 Nb (in weight percent) with a balance of Fe. This alloy was optimized for chemistry, based upon tensile strength, creep-rupture strength, fracture behavior, and fatigue resistance up to 800 C. Alloys were also tested for environmental compatibility. The microstructure and mechanic properties (including hardness) were assessed in the as-cast condition and following several heat treatments, including one designed to simulate a required braze cycle. The alloy was fabricated and characterized in the form of both equiaxed and columnar-grained castings. The columnar grains were produced by directional solidification, and the properties were characterized in both the longitudinal and transverse orientations. The NASAUT 4 G-Al alloy was found to be good in cyclic-oxidation resistance and excellent in both hydrogen and hot-corrosion resistance, especially in comparison to the baseline XF- 818 alloy. The mechanical properties of yield strength, <b>stress-rupture</b> <b>life,</b> high-cycle-fatigue resistance, and low-cycle-fatigue resistance were good to excellent in comparison to the current alloy for this application, HS- 31 (X- 40), with precise results depending in a complex manner on grain orientation and temperature.
