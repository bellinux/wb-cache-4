5000|$|Shoe Skis - Shoe skis may be {{used for}} training. Shoe skis are small 'skis' put on the foot that are only a few inches longer and wider than the skier's foot.

As an intermediate step to barefooting, flat soled <b>street</b> <b>shoes</b> may also be worn. This provides more lift than bare feet, but a more similar experience to barefooting than actual wooden 'shoe skis'.|$|R

Bobby soxers were usually teenage girls and young adult women from about 12 to 25. Fashionable adolescent girls wore poodle skirts and rolled down their socks to the ankle. In {{high schools and}} colleges, the gymnasium was often used as a dance floor; however, since <b>street</b> <b>shoes</b> and <b>street</b> detritus might damage the polished wood floors, the students were required to remove their shoes and flop dance in their bobby socks, hence the terms [...] "bobby soxer" [...] and [...] "sock hop".|$|R

5000|$|The first [...] "modern-style" [...] {{department}} store in Japan was Mitsukoshi, founded in 1904, {{which has its}} root as a kimono store called Echigoya from 1673. When the roots are considered, however, Matsuzakaya has an even longer history, dated from 1611. The kimono store changed to a {{department store}} in 1910. In 1924, Matsuzakaya store in Ginza allowed <b>street</b> <b>shoes</b> to be worn indoors, something innovative at the time. These former kimono shop department stores dominated the market in its earlier history. They sold, or rather displayed, luxurious products, which contributed to their sophisticated atmospheres. Another origin of the Japanese department store is from railway companies. There have been many private railway operators in the nation and, from the 1920s, they started to build department stores directly linked to their lines' termini. Seibu and Hankyu are the typical examples of this type.|$|R
5000|$|In year 1999 Xavier Berneda, {{marketing}} {{manager of the}} company, and his brother David, financial manager, both of them grandsons of the company founder, convinced the father and uncle to diversify the company and enter the field of <b>street</b> <b>shoes</b> and fashion.

60|$|He {{came to a}} {{stop and}} waited. She had taken the lace and muslin from the basket, {{possibly}} to settle her nerves and wits, and was sewing upon it. As she was not looking at him, he devoured her with his eyes. He noted the firm, efficient hands--hands that could control a horse like Bob, that could run a typewriter almost as fast as a man could talk, that could sew on dainty garments, and that, doubtlessly, could play on the piano over there in the corner. Another ultra-feminine detail he noticed--her slippers. They were small and bronze. He had never imagined she had such a small foot. <b>Street</b> <b>shoes</b> and riding boots were all that he had ever seen on her feet, and they had given no advertisement of this. The bronze slippers fascinated him, and to them his eyes repeatedly turned.|$|R

At follow-up, the arthrodesis was fused in 48 toes; three toes showed an asymptomatic radiographic nonunion, {{and in one of}} them the screw was broken. In seven toes, the cannulated screw was removed because of persistent pain {{at the tip of the}} toe where the head of the screw was located. In one case only, there was a late infection, with toe malalignment. All the patients were able to use <b>street</b> <b>shoes</b> 2 weeks after surgery. The average AOFAS score at follow-up was 86. 54 points.

5000|$|Rose's Bathing Beach and Swimming School {{located on}} the west shore of Reeds Lake {{on the north side}} of the boat launch, was {{established}} in 1901 by James Rose. German-born Rose had his own unique style of teaching people to swim. Hundreds learned under his tutelage. In addition to the bathing school and beach, there was a bathhouse and 'hamburger joint'. In the winter, when the lake was frozen, Rose's had a toboggan run, skating rink and ice hockey league. In the winters the bathhouse was crowded with skaters changing in and out of <b>street</b> <b>shoes</b> and indulging in Rose's famous caramel corn. After the bathing beach closed in the late 1960s, most of the facility was demolished. One small building was left standing.

40|$|In Europe, bespoke {{orthopaedic}} {{shoes are}} usually sent {{for a trial}} fitting in order to check the fit and indicate any modifications required before final finishing. The use of shell shoes at the fit assessment stage, rather than the traditional alternative of partially or fully finished shoes, can offer service advantages, and is widely used for example in the Netherlands. However the comparability of shell fit assessment with the traditional method of trial shoe fit assessment has not been evaluated, either to assess its sensitivity or to elucidate any difference in assessment technique required of the orthotist. In this work, the results of fit assessments by both methods are compared. The trial involved a group of normal subjects wearing high <b>street</b> <b>shoes</b> of styles {{similar to those used}} for orthopaedic footwear. The results indicate that the shell fit assessments were in the main comparable to those for trial shoe fit. The only consistent area of deviation noted, in the heel at the topline, is attributable to a construction factor in shoe making. Apart from this area, the orthotist need not adjust his technique {{to make use of the}} shell method...|$|R
