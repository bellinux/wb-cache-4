5|$|Cats {{have either}} a mutualistic or {{commensal}} relationship with humans. Two main theories are given about how cats were domesticated. In one, people deliberately tamed cats {{in a process}} of artificial selection as they were useful predators of vermin. This has been criticized as implausible, because the reward for <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> may have been too little; cats generally do not carry out commands and although they do eat rodents, other species such as ferrets or terriers may be better at controlling these pests. The alternative idea is that cats were simply tolerated by people and gradually diverged from their wild relatives through natural selection, as they adapted to hunting the vermin found around humans in towns and villages.|$|E

25|$|The FirstEnergy Dam {{was built}} by the Northern Ohio Traction and Light Co. in 1912 to serve the dual {{functions}} of generating hydropower for its local streetcar system and providing cooling-water storage for a coal-burning power plant; however, the hydropower operation was discontinued in 1958, and the coal-burning plant was decommissioned in 1991. Some environmental groups and recreational groups want the dam removed. Others contend <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> would be expensive and complicated, {{for at least two}} reasons: first, the formerly hollow dam was filled in with concrete in the early 1990s, and second, because of the industrial history of Cuyahoga Falls, the sediment upstream of the dam is expected to contain hazardous chemicals, possibly including heavy metals and PCBs. The Ohio EPA estimated removal of the dam would cost $5–10 million, and removal of the contaminated sediments $60 million. The dam is licensed through 2041.|$|E
25|$|If the Southern Maya Area {{is a part}} of Mesoamerica {{delineated}} {{from the}} rest of Mesoamerica spatially, temporally and, in one specific sense – by the still unresolved question of its possibly crucial role in the origins of Maya civilization - one needs to understand that posing this large research question risks falling into ultimately meaningless, infinitely regressing arguments about how “origins” might be considered or defined – essentially arguments about qualitative or inevitably subjectively rendered entities or topics, giving way to questions such as, What is “Maya civilization”? What is “Maya”? What is “civilization”? What allows us to call this or that civilization “great”? One way to conceptualize the quandary of seeking first cause/s is to understand that <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> leads to infinite regression unless a metaconcept is accepted which, in the case of Maya civilization, is whatever it is primordially that made “Maya” “Maya.” Another way is to focus on ahistorical processes - environmental circumscription, peer polity interaction, and other theories.|$|E

2500|$|As of 2007, the {{prospects}} for learning the sequelae of this disaster {{do not appear to}} be bright. What is sorely needed is an independent body to coordinate the health care, research, rehabilitation of gas victims, and care for potential effects in their offspring. Instead of the non-directive symptomatic medical treatment that currently exists, clear guidelines and criteria need to be formulated for specific medical conditions such as damage to bronchial tubes, sleep apnea, neuron destruction, etc. <b>Such</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> could be implemented through India's existing health care pyramid.

2500|$|Reflecting on {{his first}} six novels and his rapid writing {{turnover}} later in his career, DeLillo remarked, [...] "I wasn't learning {{to slow down and}} examine what I was doing more closely. I don't have regrets about that work, but I do think that if I had been a bit less hasty in starting each new book, I might have produced somewhat better work in the 1970s. My first novel took so long and was <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> that once I was free of it I almost became carefree in a sense and moved right through the decade, stopping, in a way, only at Ratner's Star (1976), which was an enormous challenge for me, and probably a bigger challenge for the reader. But I slowed down in the 1980s and '90s." [...] DeLillo has also acknowledged some of the weaknesses of his 1970s works, reflecting in 2007: [...] "I knew I wasn’t doing utterly serious work, let me put it that way." ...|$|E

2500|$|In his memoirs, {{published}} {{fifty years}} later in 1938, Dew {{made a number of}} claims about being personally involved in the Ripper investigation. [...] Dew claimed to know Mary Jane Kelly by sight. [...] "Often I saw her parading along Commercial Street, between Flower and Dean Street and Aldgate, or along Whitechapel Road", he wrote. [...] "She was usually in the company of two or three of her kind, fairly neatly dressed and invariably wearing a clean white apron, but no hat." [...] Dew also claimed to {{have been one of the}} first police officers on the murder scene, though none of the records mentioning those people who were present list his involvement. Dew wrote that he saw Kelly's mutilated body in her room in Miller's Court and that he regarded it as [...] "the most gruesome memory of the whole of my Police career." [...] Dew wrote that Kelly's open eyes were photographed in an attempt to capture an image of her killer, but police doctors involved in the case had already determined that <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> would be futile. Dew stated that Emma Smith was the first Ripper victim, a view that has often been contested by Ripperologists, [...] and opined that [...] "Someone, somewhere, shared Jack the Ripper's guilty secret." ...|$|E
2500|$|The part of Liz Shaw {{was given}} to Caroline John who was {{recommended}} to the outgoing production team by James Cellan Jones. Although John had been working regularly on the stage (including at the National Theatre under Laurence Olivier), she was frustrated {{that she had not}} won any TV roles. According to several DVD releases in the Doctor Who series and interviews with the actress herself, taking dramatic steps, John had herself photographed in a bikini and sent the picture around to BBC producers. The photo ended up on Peter Bryant's desk and he offered her the part once they had met, without any formal audition or screen test. After appearing in the 25 episodes that made up the four stories of the seventh season, John left the programme because she was pregnant with her first child, and producer Barry Letts had already decided against renewing her contract. Letts and Terrance Dicks viewed the character as unsuccessful, feeling that she did not fill the companion's role of asking the Doctor for exposition and acting as an audience surrogate. In 1978, John expressed mixed feelings about her role as Liz, saying, [...] "I was excited at first to be a brainy girl, but all the directors wanted really was a sexy piece. It was <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> looking glamorous on cold clay-pits and rubbish dumps. I enjoyed the series but found it restricting after a while." [...] John continued to appear at fan conventions from the 1990s onwards.|$|E
2500|$|Frances Burney was a novelist, diarist and playwright. In all, {{she wrote}} four novels, eight plays, one {{biography}} and twenty-five volumes of journals and letters. She has gained critical respect {{in her own}} right, but she also foreshadowed such novelists of manners with a satirical bent as Jane Austen and Thackeray. She published her first novel, Evelina, anonymously in 1778. During this period, novel reading was frowned upon as something that young women of a certain social status should not do. Novel writing then, {{was out of the}} question. Burney feared that her father, Dr Burney, would discover what she called her [...] "scribbling". Because of this, when Burney published Evelina anonymously, she only told her siblings and two trusted aunts. Shortly after the book's publication, it seemed that everyone was reading and discussing it. Eventually, her father read the novel and guessed that Burney was the author. Hence news spread. When the book's authorship came to light, it brought Burney almost immediate fame with its unique narrative and comic strengths. She followed it with Cecilia in 1782, Camilla in 1796 and The Wanderer in 1814. All Burney's novels explore the lives of English aristocrats, and satirise their social pretensions and personal foibles, with an eye to larger questions such as the politics of female identity. With one exception, Burney never succeeded in having her plays performed, largely due to objections from her father, who thought that publicity from <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> would be damaging to her reputation. The exception was Edwy and Elgiva, which unfortunately was not well received by the public and closed after the first night's performance.|$|E

2500|$|Her {{philosophical}} {{work was}} influenced by Simone Weil (from whom she borrows the concept of 'attention'), and by Plato, under whose banner she claimed to fight. In re-animating Plato, she gives force {{to the reality of}} the Good, and to a sense of the moral life as a pilgrimage from illusion to reality. [...] From this perspective, Murdoch's work offers perceptive criticism of Kant, Sartre and Wittgenstein ('early' and 'late'). [...] Her most central parable, which appears in The Sovereignty of Good, asks us (in Nussbaum's succinct account), [...] "to imagine a mother-in-law, M, who has contempt for D, her daughter-in-law. M sees D as common, cheap, low. Since M is a self-controlled Englishwoman, she behaves (so Murdoch stipulates) with perfect graciousness all the while, and no hint of her real view surfaces in her acts. But she realizes, too, that her feelings and thoughts are unworthy, and likely to be generated by jealousy and an excessively keen desire to hang on to her son. So she sets herself a moral task: she will change her view of D, making it more accurate, less marred by selfishness. She gives herself exercises in vision: where she is inclined to say 'coarse,' she will say, and see, 'spontaneous.' Where she is inclined to say 'common,' she will say, and see, 'fresh and naive.' As time goes on, the new images supplant the old. Eventually M does not have to make <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> to control her actions: they flow naturally from the way she has come to see D." [...] This is how M cultivates a pattern of behavior that leads her to view D [...] "justly or lovingly". [...] The parable is partly meant to show (against Oxford contemporaries including R. M. Hare and Stuart Hampshire) the importance of the 'inner' life to moral action. [...] Seeing another aright can depend on overcoming jealousy, and discoveries about the world involve inner work.|$|E
