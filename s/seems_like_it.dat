Casey Brienza of Anime News Network heavily criticized the story, grading it as an [...] "F" [...] and calling it [...] "a pastiche {{of a large number of}} manga and anime clichés, not because it <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> was intended to be a pastiche, but because the manga artist [...] flatly is unable to sustain a coherent, unified storyline that is his own, original creation." [...] However, Brienza did praise the artwork, grading it as an [...] "A" [...] and calling it rich and [...] "beautifully drawn".

The team was named after an unarmed New York native who was shot 50 times by three police officers on November 25, 2006. The Sean Bell All-Stars won the Trayvon Martin Invitational in August 2013, with a team that featured Clinkscales and Tobias Harris, in Harlem, New York. The event raised over $5,000 for the Trayvon Martin Foundation and was attended by NBA players Kyrie Irving, Tyreke Evans, and future NBA commissioner Adam Silver. At the invitational, Clinkscales spoke out against police brutality, saying, [...] "Kids everywhere are getting shot and murdered, whether it's in Jamaica, the Bronx, Chicago. It <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> never goes right {{when it comes to the}} law, but the message to the kids is that if you go hard on the court you have to go hard in the classroom." [...] In 2015, he competed for the All-Stars at The Basketball Tournament, in a team that featured Delroy James and Zamal Nixon and was managed by Raheem Wiggins.

[...] For Paul Tassi and Erik Kain of Forbes, {{watching}} the series made them question the MCU, with Kain feeling that the [...] "morally complex, violent, dark world of Jessica Jones {{has no place in}} the MCU ... right now, the MCU is holding back shows like Jessica Jones and Daredevil, while those shows are contributing absolutely nothing to the MCU." [...] Tassi {{went so far as to}} wonder what [...] "the point of the Marvel Cinematic Universe" [...] is, lamenting the lack of major crossovers in the franchise since the Winter Soldier reveal on Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., and saying that Jessica Jones is [...] "so far removed from the world of The Avengers, it might as well not be in the same universe at all ... really don't understand the point of [...] if they're going to keep everything within it separated off in these little boxes". Conversely, Eric Francisco of Inverse called Jessica Joness lack of overt connections to the MCU [...] "the show's chief advantage. Besides demonstrating how physically wide open the MCU's scope really is, Jessica Jones also proves the MCU's thematic durability." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{game had}} {{received}} mainly positive reviews. Final Fantasy [...] Dimensions received an aggregated score of 78 on Metacritic based on 10 reviews and 74.43% on GameRankings based on seven reviews.

The story is huge, the characters enjoyable and fun to play, and other than the iffy controls, the game works fantastically well on the touchscreen. The menus in particular are elegantly designed. The music and graphics are even great in creating a world that reminds us that {{the old and new}} can coexist, and do so with aplomb". Justin Davis of IGN criticized the episodic structure of the game however [...] "Players can't fully explore the game world until they're almost at the end – over 30 hours in!", however also praises the gameplay stating, [...] "What Dimensions lacks in scenario & story flexibility it makes up for with sheer depth and flexibility in its job system. Players can assign any party member to any available job on-the-fly, with more opening up as the story progresses." [...] Joe Juba of Game Informer praised the gameplay but criticized the lack of fanfare stating, [...] "Despite the fun job system and classic vibe to the combat, Dimensions <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> was set up to fail. It released to little fanfare at a prohibitive price point for mobile games." [...] Tof Eklund of TouchArcade praised the games features stating, [...] "There's an epic, high fantasy plot with lots of twists, a large cast of characters whose appearance and abilities vary wildly, tons of random combat, lots of leveling-up and abilities to unlock, a gradual opening up of the world, secret items, bonus dungeons, and a lot of looking inside pots and barrels in order to pilfer the worldly goods of the townspeople you run across."

But from that session, there are six or eight songs that are recorded — some with vocals, some with leads, but all with keeper guitar, drums and bass. So when those songs get finished lyrically, if the lyrics don't change the songs, they'll be ready to be on the next record. So we already have more than half a record complete, if those songs make it." [...] He also gave conceivable consideration that it could be released next year, [...] "I'm certainly not gonna promise it, because every time I do, I make a liar of myself! [...] " [...] When asked about any plans or the timeline the band would like to release the album, King said, [...] "It depends on touring — getting time to rehearse, getting time to make up new stuff. We haven't even done Australia on this run yet at all. We're hitting Japan finally later this year. But if things go well, I'd like to record next year. But timelines change all the time." [...] In an October 2017 interview, Holt once again expressed his desire to contribute to the songwriting for the next Slayer album, saying, [...] "When that time comes and we are ready for the next album, if Kerry wants me to contribute, I've got riffs. I've got stuff right now that I've written that I am not using for Exodus, because it was kind of maybe just unintentional subconscious thing, like, 'It sounds a little too Slayer.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|The music video's {{representation}} of the song, and its exclusion of Rocky were also well received. Morgan Peterson of Harper's Bazaar said the visual saw Gomez [...] "syncing up to her sultry new sound", while MTV UK wrote that it [...] "keeps true to the intense theme of the song". Lockett said it reinstated the song's [...] "titillating striptease" [...] theme, and that Rocky's exclusion was the clip's biggest statement, [...] "so that all eyes and ears are on Selena. 'Make you never wanna leave, indeed.'" [...] Lockett's commendation of Rocky's exclusion was echoed by Jason Lipshutz of Billboard and Marjua Esteves of Vibe, who both said his absence assisted the premise conceptually. In a less enthusiastic review, Yasmeen Gharnit of Nylon wrote, [...] "While there's no exact formula for how Disney stars transition into full-fledged adults, it <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> always involves a water and sexual innuendo-filled video".
