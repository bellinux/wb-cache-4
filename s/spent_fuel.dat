5|$|Great Britain has 19 {{operating}} reactors, producing about 20% of its electricity. It processes {{much of its}} <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> at Sellafield on {{the northwest}} coast across from Ireland, where nuclear waste is vitrified and sealed in stainless steel canisters for dry storage above ground for at least 50 years before eventual deep geologic disposal.

5|$|In nature, sixteen {{repositories}} {{were discovered}} at the Oklo mine in Gabon where natural nuclear fission reactions took place 1.7 billion years ago. The fission products in these natural formations {{were found to}} have moved less than 10ft (3 m) over this period, though the lack of movement may be due more to retention in the uraninite structure than to insolubility and sorption from moving ground water; uraninite crystals are better preserved here than those in <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> rods because of a less complete nuclear reaction, so that reaction products would be less accessible to groundwater attack.|$|E

5|$|In the Peoples Republic of China, ten {{reactors}} provide about 2% {{of electricity}} and five more are under construction.

Geological disposal has been studied since 1985, and a permanent deep geological repository was required by law in 2003. Sites in Gansu Province near the Gobi desert in northwestern China are under investigation, with a final site expected to be selected by 2020, and actual disposal by about 2050.|$|E
5|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that {{spent nuclear fuel}} and high-level reprocessing and plutonium wastes require well-designed storage for periods ranging from tens of thousands to a million years, to minimize releases of the contained radioactivity into the environment. Safeguards are also required to ensure that neither plutonium nor highly enriched uranium is diverted to weapon use. There is general agreement that placing spent nuclear fuel in repositories hundreds of meters below the surface would be safer than indefinite storage of <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> on the surface.|$|E
5|$|Nuclear waste {{policy in}} Germany is in flux. German {{planning}} for a permanent geologic repository began in 1974, focused on salt dome Gorleben, a salt mine near Gorleben about 100 kilometers northeast of Braunschweig. The site was announced in 1977 with plans for a reprocessing plant, <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> management, and permanent disposal facilities at a single site. Plans for the reprocessing plant were dropped in 1979. In 2000, {{the federal government and}} utilities agreed to suspend underground investigations for three to ten years, and the government committed to ending its use of nuclear power, closing one reactor in 2003.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWith {{conversion}} of nuclear development strategy from “proper development” to “positive development” in China, the future nuclear power {{scale and the}} amount of the <b>spent</b> nuclear <b>fuels</b> will be enormous, the construction of <b>spent</b> nuclear <b>fuel</b> reprocessing plant will be necessary to meet the sustainable development requirement. Because of the huge investment and high environmental sensitivity, the site selection of <b>spent</b> nuclear <b>fuel</b> reprocessing plant has always been the focus of controversy.

5|$|Sixteen nuclear {{reactors}} produce about 3% of India’s electricity, and seven more are under construction. <b>Spent</b> <b>fuel</b> is processed at facilities in Trombay near Mumbai, at Tarapur {{on the west}} coast north of Mumbai, and at Kalpakkam on the southeast coast of India. Plutonium will be used in a fast breeder reactor (under construction) to produce more fuel, and other waste vitrified at Tarapur and Trombay. Interim storage for 30 years is expected, with eventual disposal in a deep geological repository in crystalline rock near Kalpakkam.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, the {{government}} decided {{to select a}} site for permanent repository by 2010. With four nuclear reactors providing 29% of its electricity, Finland in 1987 enacted a Nuclear Energy Act making the producers of radioactive waste responsible for its disposal, subject to requirements of its Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority and an absolute veto given to local governments in which a proposed repository would be located. Producers of nuclear waste organized the company Posiva, with responsibility for site selection, construction and operation of a permanent repository. A 1994 amendment to the Act required final disposal of <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> in Finland, prohibiting the import or export of radioactive waste.|$|E
5|$|Spent {{nuclear fuel}} is the {{radioactive}} by-product of electricity generation at commercial nuclear power plants, and {{high-level radioactive waste}} is the by-product from reprocessing <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons. In 1982, the United States Congress established a national policy {{to solve the problem}} of nuclear waste disposal. This policy is a federal law called the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, which made the DOE responsible for finding a site, building, and operating an underground disposal facility called a geologic repository. The recommendation to use a geologic repository dates back to 1957 when the National Academy of Sciences recommended that the best means of protecting the environment and public health and safety would be to dispose of the waste in rock deep underground.|$|E
50|$|After one year, typical <b>spent</b> nuclear <b>fuel</b> generates about 10 kW {{of decay}} heat per tonne, {{decreasing}} to about 1 kW/t after ten years. Hence effective active or passive cooling for <b>spent</b> nuclear <b>fuel</b> {{is required for}} a number of years.|$|R

5|$|The Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Company. (Svensk Kärnbränslehantering AB, {{known as}} SKB) {{was created in}} 1980 and is {{responsible}} for final disposal of nuclear waste there. This includes operation of a monitored retrievable storage facility, the Central Interim Storage Facility for Spent Nuclear Fuel at Oskarshamn, about 150 miles south of Stockholm on the Baltic coast; transportation of spent fuel; and construction of a permanent repository. Swedish utilities store <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> at the reactor site for one year before transporting it to the facility at Oskarshamn, {{where it will be}} stored in excavated caverns filled with water for about 30 years before removal to a permanent repository.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} {{selecting}} appropriate permanent repositories for high level waste and <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> {{is now under}} way in several countries with the first expected to be commissioned some time after 2017. The basic concept is to locate a large, stable geologic formation and use mining technology to excavate a tunnel, or large-bore tunnel boring machines (similar to those used to drill the Chunnel from England to France) to drill a shaft 500–1,000 meters below the surface where rooms or vaults can be excavated for disposal of high-level radioactive waste. The goal is to permanently isolate nuclear waste from the human environment. However, many people remain uncomfortable with the immediate stewardship cessation of this disposal system, suggesting perpetual management and monitoring would be more prudent.|$|E
5|$|Belgium {{has seven}} nuclear {{reactors}} that provide about 52% of its electricity. Belgian {{spent nuclear fuel}} was initially sent for reprocessing in France. In 1993, reprocessing was suspended following {{a resolution of the}} Belgian parliament; <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> is since being stored on the sites of the nuclear power plants. The deep disposal of high-level radioactive waste (HLW) has been studied in Belgium for more than 30 years. Boom Clay is studied as a reference host formation for HLW disposal. The Hades underground research laboratory (URL) is located at −223 m in the Boom Formation at the Mol site. The Belgian URL is operated by the Euridice Economic Interest Group, a joint organisation between SCK•CEN, the Belgian Nuclear Research Centre which initiated the research on waste disposal in Belgium in the 1970s and 1980s and ONDRAF/NIRAS, the Belgian agency for radioactive waste management. In Belgium, the regulatory body in charge of guidance and licensing approval is the Federal Agency of Nuclear Control, created in 2001.|$|E

40|$|Part of the Department of Energy (DOE) <b>spent</b> nuclear <b>fuel</b> (SNF) {{inventory}} {{may require}} {{some type of}} treatment to meet acceptance criteria at various disposition sites.

The evaluation of need includes considerations of cost, technical feasibility, process material disposition, and schedule to treat a proposed fuel. A siting evaluation methodology has been developed to account for these variables. A work breakdown structure is proposed to gather life-cycle cost information to allow evaluation of alternative siting strategies on a similar basis.
