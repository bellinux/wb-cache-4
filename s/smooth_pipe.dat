40|$|A {{number of}} {{correlations}} for friction factor determinations in <b>smooth</b> <b>pipes</b> {{have been proposed}} in the past decades. The accuracy and applicability of these friction factor formulas should be examined. Based on this notion the paper {{is designed to provide}} a comparative study of friction factor correlations in <b>smooth</b> <b>pipes</b> for all flow regimes of Bingham fluids. Nine models were chosen. The comparisons of the selected equations with the existing experimental results, which are available in the literature, were expressed through MARE, MRE+, MRE-, RMSE, Ѳ, and S. The statistical comparisons were also carried out using MSC and AIC. The analyses show that the Wilson-Thomas (1985) and Morrison (2013) models are best fit models to the experimental data for the Reynolds number up to 40000. Within this range, both models can be used alternately. But beyond this Re value the discrepancy of the Wilson-Thomas model is higher than the Morrison model. In {{view of the fact that}} the Morrison model requires fewer calculations and parameters as well as a single equation is used to compute the friction factor for all flow regimes, it is the authors’ advice to use this model for friction factor estimation for the flow of Bingham fluids in <b>smooth</b> <b>pipes</b> as an alternative to the Moody chart and other implicit formulae...|$|R
50|$|The Blasius {{correlation}} is {{the simplest}} equation for computing the Darcy frictionfactor. Because the Blasius correlation has no term for pipe roughness, itis valid only to <b>smooth</b> <b>pipes.</b> However, the Blasius correlation is sometimesused in rough pipes {{because of its}} simplicity.

40|$|Mutual {{consistency}} of regularities {{demonstrated by the}} flow and hydraulic resistance is analyzed in this article. It is proven that the values of friction factors of pipes, identified through the employment of traditional methods, {{differ from those of}} channels by 4 times. It is also proven that the average velocity deficit inside pipes and channels, identified by integrating velocity profiles that depend on the Karman parameter, differ by only 1. 5 times. The relation between the Karman parameter and the average velocity deficit provides this parameter with a clear physical sense. The original method of reconciliation of the experimental regularity of <b>smooth</b> <b>pipes</b> against the resistance ratio formula, obtained by integrating the logarithmic velocity profile, adjusts the value of the Karman parameter and the second constant of the velocity profile, as both are slightly different from the experimental values identified by I. Nikuradze. The average velocity deficit identified for the flow in rough pipes by integrating the velocity profile coincides with the same in <b>smooth</b> <b>pipes,</b> and they both have the same dependence on the Karman parameter. The adjusted Karman parameter value is almost the same for rough and <b>smooth</b> <b>pipes.</b> The adjusted value of the second turbulence constant for rough pipes is a little higher than the experimental value identified by I. Nikuradze. Adjusted first and second constant values of turbulence for rough and <b>smooth</b> <b>pipes</b> assure more consistency between the regularities of resistance and distribution of velocities inside <b>smooth</b> and rough <b>pipes.</b> Показано, что дефицит средней скорости для труб и каналов, найденный интегрированием профиля скорости, зависит от параметра Кармана и различается в 1, 5 раза. Полученная связь параметра Кармана с дефицитом средней скорости придает этому параметру однозначное физическое определение. Реализуя оригинальный прием сопоставления опытной закономерности сопротивления для гладких труб с выражением для коэффициента сопротивления, полученным интегрированием логарифмического профиля скорости, удается несколько уточнить значение параметра Кармана и второй константы профиля скорости, которые несколько отличаются от опытных значений, найденных И. Никурадзе. Установленные уточненные значения первой и второй констант турбулентности для течений в гладких и шероховатых трубах обеспечивают строгое соответствие между закономерностями сопротивления и распределением скоростей в гладких и шероховатых трубах...|$|R

The behavior of the compression shock in a <b>smooth</b> cylindrical <b>pipe</b> was also investigated.

The shape of the flow velocity profile is given by the following equation, [...] ---- (1) The value of n determines {{the shape of the}} flow velocity profile. The eq.(1) can be used to determine the flow profile's shape within the pipe by fitting a curve to experimentally measured velocity data. In 1993, the transverse flow velocities were being measured within the high pressure natural gas environment using hot wire technology to accomplish the data fit. A fully developed flow profile was used as the reference state for meter calibration and determination of Coefficient of Discharge (Cd). For Reynolds Number [...] to [...] n is approximately 7.5; for Re of , n is approximately 10.0 where a fully developed profile in a <b>smooth</b> <b>pipe</b> was assumed.

The following straight pipe equivalent length in eq.(3) was utilized to ensure a fully developed flow profile exists. [...] ---- (3) In eq.(3) the pipe lengths required is significant, hence we need some devices that can able to condition the flow over a shorter pipe length allowing metering packages to be cost competitive and accurate. Here the velocity flow profile is generally three-dimensional. Normally the description requires no axial orientation indication if the profile is asymmetric and if it does exists, then axial orientation with respect to some suitable plane of reference is required. Asymmetry exists downstream of installation effects such as elbows or tees. Usually, the velocity flow profile is described on two planes 90° apart. Using the latest software technology a full pipe cross sectional description of the velocity profile is possible provided sufficient data points are given.|$|E
40|$|Corrugated pipes combine {{small-scale}} rigidity {{and large-scale}} flexibility, {{which makes them}} very useful in industrial applications. The flow through such a pipe can induce strong undesirable whistling noises and even drive dangerous structural vibrations. Placing a short corrugated segment along a <b>smooth</b> <b>pipe</b> reduces the whistling, while this composite pipe still retains some global flexibility. The whistling is reduced by thermo-viscous damping in the <b>smooth</b> <b>pipe</b> segment. A linear semi-empirical model is proposed that allows to predict the critical Mach numbers {{at the onset of}} whistling for a composite pipe at moderately high Reynolds numbers. Experimental results for corrugated pipes of three different corrugations geometries are presented revealing fair agreement with the theory. In addition, the model indicates that even for a corrugated pipe segment with an anechoic termination, corresponding to a very long <b>smooth</b> <b>pipe</b> segment, there exists a finite critical Mach number above which the whistling occurs.
