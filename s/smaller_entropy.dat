40|$|Abstract. Using a Physically Unclonable Function or PUF {{to extract}} a secret key from the unique {{submicron}} {{structure of a}} device, instead of storing it in non-volatile memory, provides interesting advantages like physical unclonability and tamper evidence. However, an additional Helper Data Algorithm (HDA) is required {{to deal with the}} fuzziness of the PUF’s responses. To provide a viable alternative to costly protected non-volatile memory, the PUF+HDA construction should have a very low overhead. In this work, we propose the first HDA design using soft-decision information providing an implementation that occupies 44. 8 % less resources than previous proposals. Moreover, the required size of the used PUF can be reduced upto 58. 4 % due to the <b>smaller</b> <b>entropy</b> loss...|$|E

We show how the connectivity of an arbitrary triangulation can be encoded efficiently by a coloring technique, and recovered incrementally during the progressive reconstruction of the original mesh.

40|$|A novel {{approach}} for suppression of grain noise in ultrasonic signals, based on noncoherent detector statistics and signal entropy, is presented. The {{performance of the}} technique is demonstrated using ultrasonic B-scans from samples with coarse material structure. 1 Introduction The main goal of ultrasonic grain noise suppression in material flaw detection {{is to improve the}} perceptual possibilities of the operator to observe defect echoes. The suppression is defined as perceptually ideal when a received signal (or image) which contains echoes buried in noise is filtered to yield nonzero values only at the positions of the defect echoes. In statistical terms, a perceptual improvement is therefore obtained if the amplitude distribution in the filtered signal (image) is more concentrated around zero than in the raw data (contrast enhancement). A more concentrated amplitude distribution generally means <b>smaller</b> <b>entropy.</b> Thus, from an operator perception point of view, interesting results [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{experiments}} {{have shown that}} the mass of a thermodynamic system partially composed of living matter can go increasing with the increasing of the numerical order of material changes happening in physical space. This peculiarity means that space plays an active role into life; it is difficult to explain in the usual conception of thermodynamics, because it occurs even when the system taken under consideration is isolated. By contrast, it seems to be more easily understandable through an extended conception which consists in connecting the classical laws of thermodynamics with the Einstein mass-energy relation. This extended thermodynamic conception can be utilized to provide a coherent interpretation both of the evolution of inert matter and of the evolution of living organisms. The evolution of inert matter towards higher entropy and the evolution of living organisms towards <b>smaller</b> <b>entropy</b> can be seen as parts of a one universal process...|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{solve the}} coupled Wong Yang–Mills {{equations}} for both U(1) and SU(2) gauge groups and anisotropic particle momentum distributions numerically on a lattice. For weak fields with initial energy density {{much smaller than}} that of the particles we confirm the existence of plasma instabilities and of exponential growth of the fields which has been discussed previously. Also, the SU(2) case is qualitatively similar to U(1), and we do find significant “abelianization” of the non-Abelian fields during the period of exponential growth. However, the effect nearly disappears when the fields are strong. This is because of the very rapid isotropization of the particle momenta by deflection in a strong field on time scales comparable to that for the development of Yang–Mills instabilities. This mechanism for isotropization may lead to <b>smaller</b> <b>entropy</b> increase than collisions and multiplication of hard gluons, which is interesting for the phenomenology of high-energy heavy-ion collisions...|$|E
