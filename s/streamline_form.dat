50|$|<b>Streamline</b> <b>form</b> is a {{swimming}} technique {{that is used}} underwater in every stroke. At {{the start of a}} race or on a turn, <b>streamline</b> <b>form</b> is used, usually along with a dolphin kick or flutter kick, to create the least amount of resistance to help the swimmer propel as far as they can. Many factors contribute to the perfect <b>streamline</b> <b>form</b> and mastering this method increases a swimmer’s speed. Streamline {{is one of the key}} fundamentals to mastering any stroke.|$|E
50|$|Streamline {{position}} is mostly {{used at the}} start of the race once a swimmer dives into the water off of the blocks. It is most common for the swimmer to dive into the water head first with their arms above their head and assume the <b>streamline</b> <b>form</b> at entry. The other common occurrence of streamline in a competitive race is after a swimmer completes a flip turn and pushes off of the wall. Once they have completely turned over to the opposing direction, the swimmer will then get into streamline position and push off of the wall to maximize the distance and speed out of the turn. Streamline {{position is}} the basis of the spinal axis strokes, backstroke and freestyle, as well. A swimmer will try to maintain a straight back and legs to minimize drag during the stroke. The Fédération Internationale de Natation (F.I.N.A.), otherwise known as the International Swimming Federation, has strict rules on how and when streamline may be performed in competition. According to FINA, no swimmer may travel more than 15 meters (16.4 yards) off of a start or turn in the backstroke, butterfly and freestyle underwater. Breaststroke is only allowed one complete arm stroke followed by a butterfly kick and breaststroke kick. After fifteen meters, the swimmer must break the surface of the water. Streamline is to only be used in the first 15 meters due to the swimmers inability to remain underwater without disqualification. This rule applies to all races done in compliance with FINA rules whether it is short course or long course. Swimmers in a race will usually maintain the <b>streamline</b> <b>form</b> and perform a butterfly kick for the full fifteen meters due to the fact that there is less resistance than there is on top of the water due to the lack of drag created by waves. There is no specified limit in this stroke, but, since the number of underwater strokes and kicks are regulated, this becomes a moot point to competitive swimming. It is not hydrodynamic to maintain this position past a certain distance, which is invariably less than the length of a short-course pool.|$|E
40|$|Main {{principles}} about UUVs {{design and}} missions {{are described in}} the paper. The hull shape of UUV should be solved firstly in UUV overall projecting and directly impacts to energy consumption, mobility, deep range, hydraulic resistance and navigation. The layout of three main shapes of UUVs is given in this paper and introduced total layouts figures. The main form of UUV is torpedo hull type, due to high pressure endurance and low drag coefficient. New flat <b>streamline</b> <b>form</b> provides better vertical plane and anti-jamming ability. Other anomalous shapes are designed for performing a specific task and the hydraulic resistance performance is not sufficient. UUV are implemented in many common missions. These missions can be divided in three groups, such as research, commercial and military. The common missions of UUVs are given in the paper. Considering the analysis of design, shape and missions of UUV and the tendency around the world, the Authors according to the prior direction of states science development – Innovative materials and technologies, start the research on UUV best design and shape, adapting it at first for ship underwater hull inspections...|$|E

40|$|<b>Streamlined</b> erosional <b>forms</b> in the Channeled Scabland are {{compared}} with streamline features {{recognized in the}} region of the Kasei Vallis on Mars shown in Viking imagery. The morphometric analysis considers three physical parameters, length, measured parallel to the suggested flow direction; width, taken as the maximum width of the <b>streamlined</b> <b>form</b> perpendicular to the flow direction; and area, measured with a grid placed over the surface. These parameters are used to calculate a dimensionless parameter k, defined as the square of the length multiplied by pi over four times the area. For the 137 Scabland forms studied k values range from 1. 0 to 8. 3 with an average of 3. 2. The k values for 47 Martian <b>streamlined</b> <b>forms</b> range from 1. 5 to 12. 0 with an average of 3. 8. The rough similarity of these results suggests that the terrestrial and Martian features were formed by similar processes. The forms appear to have developed an ideal shape, sufficiently elongated to reduce pressure drag in the fluid creating them, but not so long as to create excessive skin resistance...|$|R
