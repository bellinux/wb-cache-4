500|$|Some {{responded to}} the {{backlash}} {{in a show of}} solidarity with Davuluri. Students at Duke University, and with Yale University's Asian American Cultural Center and the South Asian Society, created videos and ran photo campaigns denouncing the social media attacks, while Miss Kansas Theresa Vail blogged and gave interviews to discredit the comments about both herself and Davuluri. Actor and civil-rights activist George Takei (the original Hikaru Sulu in [...] ) posted a comment on Facebook stating that while he normally doesn't [...] "care about Miss America … the uproar over an Indian-American winning (whom many decried for being 'Arab') has me <b>shaking</b> <b>my</b> head. Please tell me I'm not alone in wondering whether we've learned anything at all." [...] University of Michigan student Munmun Khan also stated that while she doesn't like beauty pageants, she hates [...] "racism and bigotry even more [...] Not only was [...] the first Indian Miss New York, but she is now also the first Indian Miss America. All cause for celebration." [...] Finally, Immediate Past President, Young Democrats of America, Atima Omara, argued that [...] "a sexist, racist, xenophobic attack against one prominent woman of color is an attack against us all, and it shouldn't be tolerated just because we disdain that woman's choices. As an African-American woman with an ethnic name, I know the constant sting that comes from hearing how you are not American enough {{no matter how much you}} accomplish in the name of America." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 1902, the Giants sent catcher Frank Bowerman {{to persuade}} Taylor {{to return to}} the Giants. [...] Bowerman sat in the stands while Taylor was {{pitching}} and negotiated the terms of Taylor's return to the Giants by signing. Taylor recalled: Frank sat in the grandstand and every time I walked out to the pitching mound he kept talking to me with his fingers. I kept <b>shaking</b> <b>my</b> head [...] "No", and Frank kept boosting the money. Soon, I nodded my head [...] "Yes", and that night I was on my way back to New York with Frank.|$|E
2500|$|As Tommy {{walked back}} to his corner after shaking Louis' hand, I {{followed}} him and seized his glove. [...] "Tommy, a wonderful perform—" [...] I began... Then I dropped his hand like a red-hot coal! He had started to raise his arm. He thought I {{had given him the}} fight and the world championship! I literally ran away, <b>shaking</b> <b>my</b> head and shouting. [...] "No! No! No!" [...] realising how I had raised his hopes for a few seconds only to dash them to the ground... That's the last time my emotions will get the better of me in a prize fight! There was much booing at the announced result, but, as I say it, it was all emotional. I gave Tommy two rounds and one even—and both his winning rounds were close.|$|E

2500|$|Initially, Miller {{worried that}} lawyers for The Simpsons {{would try to}} stop him from {{performing}} the play. At the 2000 Edinburgh Festival Fringe, the cast members of the television series were performing a special reading of dialog that featured their characters. When the producers found out that Miller was also at the festival, they invited him to a cast party. There he met The Simpsons creator Matt Groening, who had previously seen a video of MacHomer. According to Miller, [...] "next thing I knew, Matt Groening was <b>shaking</b> <b>my</b> hand, was giving me his blessing and was telling me he'd do all he could to help me continue my show. It's the best situation I could have dreamed of. No one is suing me, or asking for royalties, either." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following Adams' speech, {{attendees}} {{created the}} first pile of small bicycles. One participant, {{who was one of}} the first women of Zoobomb, said about the creation of the first new pile: [...] "I pushed through the crowd and handed it forth, bowing in honor of the golden b(eye)cycle winking in the sun. As I retreated to the crowd, my whole body was <b>shaking.</b> <b>My</b> hands were in disbelief. I paced in a circle and half-sigh/half-laughed and this darn smile was holding me so tight, I felt like the kiln was burning it into my clay, smile-shaped cheeks forever." [...] A long chain was wrapped through each of the nearly twenty bicycles, which were locked to the sculpture by Adams. Event attendees then posed for a group picture, then sang a song called [...] "16" [...] Rims", a parody of Janis Joplin's [...] "Mercedez Benz". The commemoration ended with [...] "dancing in the streets" [...] and music by The Sprockettes.|$|E
2500|$|Certain Germans helped {{prisoners in}} their escape attempts. During his second try, Robert d'Harcourt hid in a warehouse, where a German found him. The latter did not {{denounce}} him, instead helping him {{leave the city}} that night: “ then he guided me across a maze of back-alleys and yards, through which I would never have found my way alone, until {{the entrance to a}} street where he left me, not without first vigorously <b>shaking</b> <b>my</b> hand and wishing me good luck." [...] The sympathy of women is equally remarked upon by Riou and d'Harcourt. Once the escape was successful, the prisoner was sent to his regimental barracks to undergo an interrogation. In effect, the home authorities had to make sure the escape was authentic and not a spy trick. If the operation failed, the escapee was taken back to the camp to be punished. The frustration generated by failure very often led the recaptured prisoner to develop plans for the next attempt; this was the case for Charles de Gaulle and Robert d’Harcourt. Of 313,400 escapes counted for the war’s duration, 67,565 succeeded.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding his {{opposition}} to the present-day Chabad movement, someone mentioned to Shach that, [...] "After 120 years, when you go to Heaven, you will merit a warm handshake from the Vilna Gaon."
