40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to propose a {{contribution}} to obtain an improvement in the redeposition of solid impurities on cotton fabric during washing with ecological surfactants and also the enhancement of their smoothness. For that purpose, sodium bentonite {{was added to the}} detergent formulations to produce a smoothing effect while washing, to obtain what is known as “softergent”. Thus, smoothing with this product, the necessity of adding softener in the last rinse during washing is eliminated, with the savings of softeners and time and more ecological waste water. This was possible given the excellent compatibility of the bentonite with all the components of the detergent. As a water-soluble inorganic salt, bentonite is environmentally friendly. The surfactants used in the detergent formulations were the anionic sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (SDBS) and the two non-ionic surfactants, APG and AE with 7 m. EO, which were used separately and in mixtures of different proportions of anionic and non-ionic surfactants. The sodium bentonite (composed mainly of silicates and aluminates) was used with two types of particle size, without surface treatment and with and without ammoniumsilicone softener treatment to show the effect on their behaviour. The redeposition behaviour on the cotton fabric and the smoothness produced after washing with bentonite microparticles in the detergent formulation, depending on use of the surfactants alone or in the different proportions of anionic:non-ionic surfactants were measured. The <b>smoothness</b> <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> fabrics produced by the bentonite microparticles after washing was evaluated by hand. A relationship between handle and inorganic ash contents was established. Also, the electrical double layer of the bentonites was measured {{in the presence of the}} surfacants testedPostprint (published version...|$|E
40|$|Quantitative {{measures}} <b>of</b> <b>smoothness</b> play {{an important}} role in the assessment of sensorimotor impairment and motor learning. Traditionally, movement smoothness has been computed mainly for discrete movements, in particular arm, reaching and circle drawing, using kinematic data. There are currently very few studies investigating <b>smoothness</b> <b>of</b> rhythmic movements, and there is no systematic way <b>of</b> analysing the <b>smoothness</b> <b>of</b> such movements. There is also very little work on the <b>smoothness</b> <b>of</b> other movement related variables such as force, impedance etc. In this context, this paper presents the first step towards a unified framework for the analysis <b>of</b> <b>smoothness</b> <b>of</b> arbitrary movements and using various data. It starts with a systematic definition <b>of</b> movement <b>smoothness</b> and the different factors that influence smoothness, followed by a review of existing methods for quantifying the <b>smoothness</b> <b>of</b> discrete movements. A method is then introduced to analyse the <b>smoothness</b> <b>of</b> rhythmic movements by generalising the techniques developed for discrete movements. We finally propose recommendations for analysing <b>smoothness</b> <b>of</b> any general sensorimotor behaviour...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} <b>smoothness</b> <b>of</b> the {{stationary}} measure {{with respect to}} smooth perturbations of the iterated function scheme and the weight functions that define it. Our main theorems relate the <b>smoothness</b> <b>of</b> the perturbation of: the iterated function scheme and the weight functions; to the <b>smoothness</b> <b>of</b> the perturbation of the stationary measure. The results depend on the smoothness of: the iterated function scheme and the weights functions; and the space on which the stationary measure acts as a linear operator. As a consequence we also obtain the <b>smoothness</b> <b>of</b> the Hausdorff dimension of the limit set and of the Hausdorff dimension of the stationary measure...|$|R

However, the <b>smoothness</b> <b>of</b> solutions of nonlinear differential equations remains poorly studied compared with the efforts devoted to the study of linear differential equations.

40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} {{following}} modification of a linear subdivision scheme S: Let M be a surface embedded in Euclidean space, and P a smooth projection mapping onto M. Then the P-projection analogue of S {{is defined as}} T: = P ◦ S.
