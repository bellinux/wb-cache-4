5|$|In ecology, {{sustainability}} (from sustain and ability) is {{the property}} of biological systems to remain diverse and productive indefinitely. Long-lived and healthy wetlands and forests are examples of sustainable biological systems. In more general terms, sustainability is the endurance of systems and processes. The organizing principle for sustainability is sustainable development, which includes the four interconnected domains: ecology, economics, politics and culture. <b>Sustainability</b> <b>science</b> {{is the study of}} sustainable development and environmental science.|$|E

2500|$|Landscape ecology {{has been}} {{incorporated}} {{into a variety of}} ecological subdisciplines. For example, a recent development has been the more explicit consideration of spatial concepts and principles applied to the study of lakes, streams, and wetlands in the field of landscape limnology. In addition, landscape ecology has important links to application-oriented disciplines such as agriculture and forestry. [...] In agriculture, landscape ecology has introduced new options for the management of environmental threats brought about by the intensification of agricultural practices. [...] Agriculture has always been a strong human impact on ecosystems. [...] In forestry, from structuring stands for fuelwood and timber to ordering stands across landscapes to enhance aesthetics, consumer needs have affected conservation and use of forested landscapes. [...] Landscape forestry provides methods, concepts, and analytic procedures for landscape forestry. Landscape ecology has been cited as a contributor to the development of fisheries biology as a distinct biological science discipline, and is frequently incorporated in study design for wetland delineation in hydrology. It has helped shape integrated landscape management. [...] Lastly, landscape ecology has been very influential for progressing <b>sustainability</b> <b>science</b> and sustainable development planning. [...] In example, a recent study assessed sustainable urbanization across Europe using evaluation indices, country-landscapes, and landscape ecology tools and methods.|$|E

40|$|Undergraduate courses provide {{valuable}} opportunities {{to train and}} empower students with the knowledge, skills, and motivation to advance society in more sustainable directions. This article emphasizes the value of bridging primary scientific research with undergraduate education through the presentation of an integrated experiential learning and primary research model called Farm-based Authentic Research Modules in <b>Sustainability</b> <b>Sciences</b> (FARMS). FARMS are collaboratively designed with agricultural stakeholders through a community needs assessment on pressing food system issues and opportunities with the objective for faculty and students to jointly identify evidence-based management solutions. We illustrate the implementation of FARMS in an undergraduate course in Ecological Agriculture at Dartmouth College, NH where students assessed various agroecological solutions for managing plant vitality, weeds, soil quality, pests, pollinators, and biodiversity at the Dartmouth Organic Farm. Student reflections indicate that the FARMS course component was beneficial for understanding agroecological theories and concepts while also motivating involvement in <b>sustainability</b> <b>sciences</b> despite the challenges of primary research. Educator reflections noted that the FARMS pedagogical approach facilitated achieving course objectives to develop students’ ability for systems thinking, critical thinking, and interdisciplinarity while fostering students’ collaboration skills and overall motivation for creating change. Adopting the FARMS model should enable faculty in the <b>sustainability</b> <b>sciences</b> to serve as bridges between the learning, practicing, and scientific communities while supporting educational programming at student and community farms. Ultimately, {{it is expected that}} the implementation of FARMS will increase student capacity and prepare the next generation of leaders to address complex challenges of the food system using an evidence-based approach...|$|R

40|$|Discussed herein is the {{interdisciplinary}} {{nature of the}} <b>sustainability</b> <b>sciences</b> field. Through a critical historical account of so-called rationalisation of life and science, it is recognised that the economic growth model that prevailed {{over the last few}} centuries led to a disjunctive dissociation of our social systems from the natural systems, which now figures as a root cause of unsustainability. The same rationalisation arguably provoked the fragmentation of knowledge into more and more specialised disciplines, as part of a scientific framework that cannot now be readily applied to deal with current pressing socioenvironmental problems. It is argued that interdisciplinarity is the only academic response capable of achieving the reintegration of knowledge required to address the sustainability paradigm, as compromises are sought between what is essential, desired and possible, both within and without academia...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — With {{the recent}} {{ecological}} and volatile climate issues, numerous concerns have arisen which {{have led to}} the rapid growth of <b>sustainability</b> <b>sciences.</b> In <b>sustainability</b> studies and related areas such as crisis data management, multiple communities need to interact and contribute data, and then have this data modeled for them in an effective manner. The National Science Foundation Advisory Committee for Environment Research and Education states that, “Because of the complex relationships among people, ecosystems, and the biosphere, human health and well-being are closely linked to the integrity of local, regional and global ecosystems. ” In our work, we look towards developing a mobile application platform that allows data integration for multiple information sources that allows the user flexibility to learn about and actively participate in understanding and helping their environment. In this paper, we address our current work with the scientific aspects of this data...|$|R
40|$|Recurrent food {{crises and}} climate change, along with habitat loss and {{micronutrient}} deficiencies, are global issues {{of critical importance}} that have pushed food security and environmental sustainability {{to the top of}} the political agenda. Analyses of the dynamic linkages between food consumption patterns and environmental concerns have recently received considerable attention from the international and scientific community. Using the lens of a broad sustainability approach, this conceptual article aims at developing a multidimensional framework to evaluate the sustainability of food systems and diets, applicable to countries of the Mediterranean region. Derived from natural disaster and <b>sustainability</b> <b>sciences,</b> a vulnerability approach, enhanced by inputs from the resilience literature, has been adapted to analyze the main issues related to food and nutrition security. Through causal factor analysis, the resulting conceptual framework improves the design of information systems or metrics assessing the interrelated environmental, economic, social, and health dynamics of food systems.

40|$|In {{order to}} curb {{environmental}} impact, absolute resource use reductions are urgently needed. To reach this goal, multi-scalar synergies and trade-offs in global resource use must be effectively addressed. We propose that better understanding {{the role of}} extractive economies—economies that extract raw material for export—in global resource use patterns is a prerequisite to identifying such synergies and trade-offs. By combining a system-wide environmental accounting perspective with insights from political ecology and political economy research, we demonstrate that (1) the extractivist expansion may be the corollary of reduced immediate environmental impact in the industrialized countries; and (2) the material flow patterns on which this result is based do not suffice to identify the mechanisms underlying extractivist development {{and its role in}} global resource use. Our work on extractive economies illustrates that, in order to supply transformative knowledge for sustainability transformation, biophysical and socio-political conceptualizations of society-nature relations must be more strongly integrated within the interdisciplinary <b>sustainability</b> <b>sciences</b> in general and social ecology in particular...|$|R
