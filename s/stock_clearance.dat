50|$|When {{customers}} {{are told that}} the reason for a price reduction is a <b>stock</b> <b>clearance,</b> they find this less attractive than other explanations such as a volume discount. This is because they suspect that the <b>stock</b> <b>clearance</b> indiactes that the products are of poor quality.|$|E
50|$|<b>Stock</b> <b>clearance</b> is an {{activity}} {{by a company}} where ownership of products and materials {{move on to another}} legal entity. These products and materials in <b>stock</b> <b>clearance</b> will not form the basis of a company's key activities. As such they are often end of line stock, surplus stock, returned stock or bankrupt stock.|$|E
50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{companies}} that specialize in <b>stock</b> <b>clearance.</b> Clients can dispose of their surplus stock discreetly through companies such as stock buyers who will then re sell this stock to exporters, wholesalers, and smaller retailers. There are many benefits of using a <b>stock</b> <b>clearance</b> company to dispose of stock in this way. They generally have the cash available and the warehousing in place to offer a quick and efficient solution to stock disposal problems.|$|E

5000|$|The H1 {{models are}} {{inherently}} stable {{due to their}} wide track. They can ford 30 inches (76 cm) of water and climb a 22-inch (56 cm) step. Their <b>stock</b> ground <b>clearance</b> of 16 inches (41 cm) is made possible by tucking driveline components inside a channel in the central space between {{the left and right}} seats. They have high approach/departure angles of 72/37.5 degrees. Most H1s are equipped with a Central Tire Inflation System (CTIS), which enables the driver to increase or decrease the tire air pressure at the push of a button, since lower tire pressures are more suited for off road, and higher tire pressures are desirable on-road.|$|R

25|$|Poundland offer a {{range of}} {{approximately}} 3500 products, of which 1000 are branded products with the majority being food and drink. Stock typically is categorised as either ongoing core lines (products bought direct from the manufacturer), seasonal ranges or <b>clearance</b> <b>stock,</b> with 10,000 new products featured each year. Initially, unbranded products stocked by Poundland (accounting for roughly 70% of total stock) would carry the Poundland branding and logo; the retailer determined that they could increase sales by removing the Poundland branding and creating around 50 sub-brands, such as Beauty Nation, Kitchen Corner and Toolbox for its value line of DIY products. Some of the products sold under the in-house brand are supplied by manufacturers who are worried about their brand being sold in discount stores and would rather allow their products to sell without their own branding attached.|$|R
50|$|Not {{wishing to}} risk further damage to their fragile brand, Pye first used {{transistors}} in a product {{sold as a}} subsidiary brand: the Pam 710 radio, with the transistors themselves labelled Newmarket Transistors (another subsidiary). When this proved acceptable the company launched the Pye 123 radio (still with the Newmarket label on the novel internal components). Products such as these reversed the decline but the arrival of Japanese competition reduced demand to a level that threatened {{the viability of the}} manufacturing plants. The company, like most of its domestic competitors, attempted to restore demand with price competition and, where viable production exceeded demand, sold excess <b>stock</b> at loss-making <b>clearance</b> prices. This tactic has no strategic value and by 1966 Pye was in such difficulties that they started to reduce their manufacturing capacity with closure of the EKCO factory in Southend-on-Sea.|$|R

5000|$|Barry {{served as}} a clerk to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. In the 1960s, he was {{associated}} with the left-wing Students for Democratic Society. In 1970, Barry and his father founded the Applied Housing Company. In 1971, Hoboken designated Applied Housing as their exclusive developer of Section 8 housing tasked with rehabilitating deteriorated buildings into affordable housing. Applied focused on renovating the existing housing <b>stock</b> rather than <b>clearance</b> and rebuild; they also believed in careful maintenance and management thereafter to preserve the stock. During the 1970s, Applied built and renovated thousands of units of affordable housing throughout New Jersey with a concentration in Hoboken, North Bergen, and Bayonne. The firm was given a great deal of credit for Hoboken's rebirth. In 1979, his father retired and Joseph Barry became president. He re-focused the company on constructing market-rate and luxury housing with a particular concentration on the Hoboken and Jersey City waterfronts including the $150 million, 1,160-unit Shipyard Development Project on Hoboken's waterfront; the 1,650 unit waterfront condominium community Port Liberté in Jersey City; and the 42-story luxury Palisades rental residence in Fort Lee, New Jersey. In 2001, Barry pleaded guilty to making five cash payments totaling $114,900 to former County Executive Robert Janiszewski to secure state and federal funding for the Shipyard project. Barry resigned from Applied Housing and handed the management of the now $108 million in sales company over to his two sons. Admitting guilt, Barry stated: [...] "I made a terrible mistake. I take responsibility for it, and will get on with my life." [...] Barry was sentenced to 25 months in federal prison, ordered to make $1 million in restitution payments, and fined $20,000. By 2004, Applied was the largest developer in Hoboken.|$|R

40|$|Very {{little is}} known about the {{promotion}} objectives of small firms. In particular, do differences in promotional campaigns warrant a different set of promotion objectives, and how effective were these objectives? Are there differences in the use of promotion objectives amongst retailers with different national background, but within the same retail category? To address these questions, we questioned 287 clothing and shoe retailers in New Zealand, 161 in Portugal and 328 in Hungary. Retailers were asked questions about the following: (a) what was their most recent promotion campaign; (b) what were the objectives of their recent promotion campaign; (c) how successful was their recent promotion campaign; (d) how has their particular market share changed in the past 12 months; and (e) what fraction of their stock was markdown and what was the average percentage markdown. We then extended the analysis by contrasting the promotion objectives, market share and stock markdown of successful with unsuccessful campaigns. Again the results indicated some significant variations. These results have ramifications for the small firms' advertising strategies across countries, with an emphasis on the objectives of <b>stock</b> <b>clearance</b> and attracting new customers. A major finding was the cross-cultural differences across the three countries studied, mainly reflecting the different stages of economic development. No Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|Specific {{links between}} food waste and cities in a zero waste and {{circular}} economy perspective are analyzed by: i) reviewing high potential socio-technological innovations in food waste prevention and valorization ii) extracting research questions contributing to accompanying cities’ breakthrough strategies towards sustainable food systems. Based on the initiatives {{collected in the}} literature, 20 experts have extracted key measures expected to be particularly efficient in food waste reduction or valorization. These key measures are the following: 1) Education of public and professionals, 2) More flexible supply chain specifications, 3) Collaborative use of data, flow monitoring and smart sensors, 4) Regulation, taxation and financial tools, 5) Gradual withdrawal of food from market, <b>stock</b> <b>clearance,</b> on-site processing and donations, 6) Breakthrough manufacturing and packaging technologies, 7) Urban practices and urban planning, 8) Biomass valorization and biorefinery, 9) Fair distribution of responsibility between stakeholders. These key measures are analyzed according to a multi-criteria approach {{on the base of}} their expected high impact potential and transferability in many different settings. Numerous research questions addressing the food science community are also discussed; among them the question of downscaling is particularly relevant. This for logistic, where unconventional and short supply chains but also low scale reversed logistics (adapted both for collection of unsold food and of food waste) have to be developed. Dow scaling has also to be considered for processing, as small-scale transformations are required to face i) the new urban food practices such as note à note cooking, connected cooking, street food, etc., ii) the increase of new practices such as swap, urban gleaning, leftover cooking, collaborative and social solidarity food preparation actions, etc.) and iii) the development of flexible bio-refineries to transform locally produced bio-waste. Safety issues, which are particularly difficult to address in this new context of unconventional new food systems are highlighted...|$|E
40|$|Cities {{currently}} manage {{food waste}} in a quite inefficient manner: Food waste and food industry co and by products, despite their high nutriment value, are {{only to a}} small ex-tent recycled and returned to farm soil and therefore, does not contribute to closing nu-trient cycles and to supporting sustainable food production. Food waste related resource use and environmental pollution {{can no longer be}} justified in the context of global warming and increasing pressure on the planet’s limited boundaries. Cities today are acting as laboratories for socio-technological innovations in food waste prevention and valorization, yet coherent concepts and strategies involving the different actors are miss-ing. This work aims to: i) review high potential socio-technological innovations in food waste prevention and valorization ii) extract research questions contributing to fostering and accompanying cities’ breakthrough strategies towards zero waste sustainable food sys-tems, specific to different urban settings worldwide (covering both industrialized and unindustrialized areas). Twenty experts related to disciplines of industrial ecology, urban metabolism, urban farming, aquaculture systems, waste recovery, food science, law, eth-ics, system innovation and foresight studies were organized as a working group follow-ing a foresight study approach. Expert panel and literature review have shown that in-novative approaches in urban food waste prevention and management are abundantly experimented in a lot of cities worldwide (for example in Canada, the USA, UK, France and other European countries). They use manifold tools (regulation, technology, social innovation etc.) both in food waste prevention and valorization. Food system actors involved are as different as business and catering companies, civil society, NGOs and municipalities. Experts have identified 9 main categories for socio-technological innova-tions: 1) Education of public and training of professionals 2) Simplification of supply chain specifications, 3) Collaborative use of data, flow monitoring and smart sensors, 4) Regulation, taxation and financial tools, 5) Gradual withdrawal of food from market, selling off, <b>stock</b> <b>clearance,</b> on-site processing and donations, 6) Breakthrough manufac-turing and packaging technologies, 7) Urban practices such as shared gardens, swapping and food give-and-take, 8) Biomass valorization and biorefinery, 9) Good Samaritan law and distribution of responsibility between stakeholders. 	 These nine innovative approaches are discussed on the base of their expected high im-pact potential and transferability. Most of them are new, tested small-scale and have not yet been subject of in-depth analysis of performances, forces and drawbacks. Techno-logical and cultural challenges remain to be overcome, for example the analysis of “big data” to support alignment of supply and demand, the mutual share of information and joint planning of food supply, and societal acceptance of new technologies. Overall, data on food waste flows in cities are challenging to obtain. In a next step we are going to run fieldwork in four cities (Dakar, Chicago, Antananarivo and Montpellier) to con-tribute to closing this data gap and to progressing on the urban metabolism approach applied to food systems...|$|E
