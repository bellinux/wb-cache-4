40|$|Few data {{exist on}} the {{aetiology}} of anaemia and Fe deficiency (ID) during early infancy in South Asia. The present study aimed to determine the contribution of ID, infections and feeding practices to anaemia in Bangladeshi infants aged 6 - 11 months. Baseline data from 1600 infants recruited into a cluster-randomised trial testing the effectiveness of micronutrient powder sales by frontline health workers on the prevalence of anaemia were used. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for anaemia and ID, and population attributable fractions (PAF) were computed to estimate the proportion of anaemia that might be prevented by the elimination of individual risk factors. It was found that 68 % of the infants were anaemic, 56 % were Fe deficient, and one-third had evidence of <b>subclinical</b> <b>infections.</b> The prevalence of anaemia and ID increased rapidly, until 8 - 9 months of age, while that of <b>subclinical</b> <b>infections</b> was constant. ID (adjusted OR (AOR) 2 · 6 - 5 · 0; P< 0 · 001) and <b>subclinical</b> <b>infections</b> (AOR 1 · 4 - 1 · 5; P< 0 · 01) were major risk factors for anaemia, in addition to age and male sex. Similarly, <b>subclinical</b> <b>infections,</b> age and male sex were significant risk factors for ID. Previous-day consumption of Fe-rich foods was very low and not associated with anaemia or ID. The PAF of anaemia attributable to ID was 67 % (95 % CI 62, 71) and that of <b>subclinical</b> <b>infections</b> was 16 % (95 % CI 11, 20).

Methods: Three villages in Western Cambodia were selected for the study based on high reported Plasmodium falciparum incidence. A census was conducted {{at the beginning of}} the study, including demographic information and travel history. The total population was 1766. Cross-sectional surveys were conducted every three months from June 2013 to June 2014. Plasmodium infections were detected using an ultra-sensitive, high-volume, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (uPCR) technique. Clinical episodes were recorded by village health workers. The geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) were collected for all houses and all participants were linked to their respective houses using a demographic surveillance system. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Results: Most clinical episodes and <b>subclinical</b> <b>infections</b> occurred within a single study village. Clinical Plasmodium vivax episodes clustered spatially in each village but only lasted for a month. In one study village <b>subclinical</b> <b>infections</b> clustered in geographic proximity to clusters of clinical episodes.

50|$|A study {{performed}} on {{patients who had}} diffuse symptoms, such as persistent or intermittent headaches, concluded that although PCR is a highly sensitive method for detection, it {{may not always be}} sensitive enough for identification of viral DNA in CSF, {{due to the fact that}} viral shedding from latent infection may be very low. The concentration of viruses in CSF during <b>subclinical</b> <b>infection</b> might be very low.|$|E
5000|$|A natural {{reservoir}} or nidus (the latter from the Latin word for [...] "nest") is the long-term {{host of a}} pathogen of an infectious disease. Hosts often do not get the disease carried by the pathogen, or it is carried as a <b>subclinical</b> <b>infection</b> and so is asymptomatic and non-lethal.

50|$|However, Koch {{abandoned}} the universalist {{requirement of the}} first postulate altogether when he discovered asymptomatic carriers of cholera and, later, of typhoid fever. Asymptomatic or <b>subclinical</b> <b>infection</b> carriers are now {{known to be a}} common feature of many infectious diseases, especially viruses such as polio, herpes simplex, HIV, and hepatitis C.

50|$|<b>Subclinical</b> <b>infections</b> are {{important}} since they allow infections to spread from a reserve of carriers.

50|$|<b>Sub{{clinical}}</b> <b>infections</b> are common, {{with clinical}} signs occurring sporadically in a herd.

50|$|Infection and {{inflammation}} likely {{explains why}} membranes break earlier {{than they are}} supposed to.

Often, testing of the amniotic fluid is normal, but a <b>subclinical</b> <b>infection</b> (too small to detect) or infection of maternal tissues next to the amniotic fluid, may still be contributing. In response to infection, the body creates inflammation by making chemicals (ex: cytokines) that weaken the fetal membranes and put them at risk for rupture. Premature rupture of membranes is also a risk factor in the development of neonatal infection.|$|E
50|$|In 2010, a paper {{published}} in the journal Environmental Toxicology & Chemistry showed that low doses of methylmercury, a potent neurotoxic pollutant, improved the hatching rate of mallard eggs. The author of the study, Gary Heinz, who led the study for the U.S. Geological Survey at the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center in Beltsville, Md., stated that other explanations are possible. For instance, {{it is possible that the}} flock he studied might have harbored some low, <b>subclinical</b> <b>infection</b> and that mercury, well known to be antimicrobial, might have killed the infection that otherwise hurt reproduction in the untreated birds.|$|E
50|$|The {{suppression}} of CD4 T cells by HIV (or by immunosuppressive drugs) causes {{a decrease in}} the body's normal response to certain infections. Not only does this {{make it more difficult to}} fight the infection, it may mean that a level of infection that would normally produce symptoms is instead undetected (<b>subclinical</b> <b>infection).</b> If the CD4 count rapidly increases (due to effective treatment of HIV, or removal of other causes of immunosuppression), a sudden increase in the inflammatory response produces nonspecific symptoms such as fever, and in some cases a worsening of damage to the infected tissue.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{mean age}} of dengue has been {{increasing}} in some but not all countries. We sought to determine the incidence of dengue virus (DENV) infection in adults and children in a prospective cohort study in the Philippines where dengue is hyperendemic. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A prospective cohort of subjects 3 ̆e /= 6 months old in Cebu City, Philippines, underwent active community-based surveillance for acute febrile illnesses by weekly contact. Fever history within the prior seven days was evaluated with an acute illness visit followed by 2, 5, and 8 -day, and 3 -week convalescent visits. Blood was collected at the acute and 3 -week visits. Scheduled visits took place at enrolment and 12 months that included blood collections. Acute samples were tested by DENV PCR and acute/convalescent samples by DENV IgM/IgG ELISA to identify symptomatic infections. Enrolment and 12 -month samples were tested by DENV hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay to identify <b>subclinical</b> <b>infections.</b> Of 1, 008 enrolled subjects, 854 completed all study activities at 12 months per-protocol undergoing 868 person-years of surveillance. The incidence of symptomatic and <b>subclinical</b> <b>infections</b> was 1. 62 and 7. 03 per 100 person-years, respectively. However, in subjects 3 ̆e 15 years old, only one symptomatic infection occurred whereas 27 <b>subclinical</b> <b>infections</b> were identified.

50|$|An {{individual}} may only develop {{signs of an}} infection {{after a period of}} <b>subclinical</b> <b>infection,</b> a duration that is called the incubation period. This is the case, for example, for subclinical sexually transmitted diseases such as AIDS and genital warts. Individuals with such subclinical infections, and those that never develop overt illness, creates a reserve of individuals that can transmit an infectious agent to infect other individuals. Because such cases of infections do not come to clinical attention, health statistics can often fail to measure the true prevalence of an infection in a population, and this prevents the accurate modeling of its infectious transmission.|$|E
50|$|A <b>subclinical</b> <b>{{infection}}</b> (sometimes {{called a}} preinfection) is an infection that, being , is nearly or completely asymptomatic (no signs or symptoms). A subclinically infected person is thus an asymptomatic carrier of a microbe, intestinal parasite, or virus that usually is a pathogen causing illness, {{at least in}} some individuals. Many pathogens spread by being silently carried in this way by some of their host population. Such infections occur both in humans and nonhuman animals. An example of an asymptomatic infection is a mild common cold that is not noticed by the infected individual. Since subclinical infections often occur without eventual overt sign, their existence is only identified by microbiological culture or DNA techniques such as polymerase chain reaction.|$|E
