5|$|After {{shedding}} {{the burden}} of less profitable and unwieldy land with its angry residents, Burnside was on its own. The new Burnside District Council held its first meeting at the Greengate Inn, Tusmore on 19 August 1856. Due to {{the time it took}} to elect new councillors, it was not until 29 December that the council met again. Dr Christopher Penfold, chairman, met the rest of the representatives there: Daniel Ferguson of Glenunga, Alexander Ferguson of Monreith, John Townsend of Magill and James Grylls of Belle Vue. It was during this time that Kent Town decided against becoming a part of Burnside and instead applied to enter the Corporate Town of Kensington and Norwood. The council was to meet at the Inn or at Ferguson's home right up until December 1869, when the first council chambers were built. However, it was still able to operate and fulfill its obligations under the Local Government Act 1852. These included the management of minor roads, the administration of abattoir licences and public houses, and the prevention of the spread of the noxious <b>Scotch</b> <b>thistle.</b> The council was also obliged, under a different act of 1851, to encourage education. Much road and bridgework activity happened after the council had been formed—early residents were amazed at the influx of development and construction that occurred. At the same time, the council was almost overwhelmed by the amount of work requested, and was forced to ask individual ratepayers for monetary assistance when building bridges in their area.|$|E
25|$|The Australian {{painted lady}} {{typically}} uses the native Australian everlastings and other daisies as a host and food plant. However, it also feeds on several introduced species, including capeweed (Arctotheca calendula), <b>Scotch</b> <b>thistle</b> (Onopordum acanthium), and lavender (Lavandula angustifolia). The adults {{feed on the}} nectar of flowers.|$|E
25|$|Eggs have being {{recorded}} on Arctotis, Chrysanthemum (Asteraceae family) and <b>Scotch</b> <b>thistle</b> (Cirsium vulgare), but the resulting larvae do not survive {{past the first}} instar on these plants. Successful larvae have been observed on capeweed (Cryptostemma) and cudweed (Gnaphalium). The results are limited, usually causing malformations on everlasting daisies (Helichrysum bracteatum) and (Helichrysum bellidioides). If leaves are not sufficient, then they eat flowers. Individuals reared on capeweed produce foul-smelling imagos. Other food plants have been recorded in Australia, but {{do not appear to}} be used in New Zealand.|$|E

50|$|Other {{restoration}} {{work has}} been the removal of invasive plant species including star <b>thistle,</b> <b>scotch</b> broom and Himalayan blackberry. Non-native plants can displace the native species, which may decrease biodiversity and cause a loss of habitat that provide nest sites and food sources. The riparian or streamside plant areas along Butte Creek are the most vulnerable to invasive non-native plants.|$|R
60|$|A {{year or two}} ago Mr. Gladstone, when at Dalmeny, {{pointed out}} that he had the {{advantage}} over Blackie in being of both Highland and Lowland extraction. The professor, however, is as <b>Scotch</b> as the <b>thistle</b> or his native hills, and Mr. Gladstone, quite justifiably, considers him the most outstanding of living Scotsmen. Blackie is not quite sure himself. Not long ago I heard him read a preface to a life of Mr. Gladstone that was being printed at Smyrna in modern Greek. He told his readers to remember that Mr. Gladstone was a great scholar and an upright statesman. They would find it easy to do this if they first remembered that he was Scottish.|$|R

50|$|This plant {{grows in}} the dry cold desert of the western Snake River Plain. The habitat is shrubsteppe or desert shrub communities, where it grows {{alongside}} Purshia tridentata and Stipa comata. Some populations appear better able to withstand disturbance than others. Some have been extirpated by overgrazing, while others tolerate the presence of cattle. Other threats include fire, off-road vehicle use, and the invasion of Onopordum acanthium, <b>Scotch</b> <b>thistle.</b>|$|E
50|$|Silybum marianum {{has other}} common names include cardus marianus, milk thistle, blessed milkthistle, Marian thistle, Mary thistle, Saint Mary's thistle, Mediterranean milk thistle, {{variegated}} thistle and <b>Scotch</b> <b>thistle.</b> This species is an annual or biennial plant of the Asteraceae family.

5000|$|Another {{traditional}} source {{appears in}} the form of a Scots proverb; [...] "Ye maunna tramp on the <b>Scotch</b> <b>thistle,</b> laddie", this being immortalised in marble by Glasgow monumental sculptors James Gibson & Co. for the Kelvingrove International Exhibition of 1888. The phrase [...] "Wha daur meddle wi' me?" [...] also appears in a traditional border ballad entitled [...] "Little Jock Elliot", which recalls the exploits of a 16th-century Border Reiver ("John Elliot of the Park"), with particular reference to an infamous encounter in the summer of 1566 with James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell, the third husband of Mary, Queen of Scots.|$|E

In the motto [...] "No-one harasses me with impunity" [...] (Latin: [...] "Nemo me impune lacessit"), [...] "me" [...] was therefore originally the thistle itself, but by extension now refers to the Scottish regiments which have adopted it.|$|E
50|$|In early 1883, the {{businesses}} of James Burns of Normanton and Sydney were amalgamated {{with that of}} Robert Philp of Townsville. Burns Philp & Company Limited was incorporated under New South Wales law with its registered office in Sydney. The nominal capital of the firm was £250,000, with 90% of the capital coming from Australian sources. The amalgamated company had assets in Sydney, Townsville, Normanton, Thursday Island, Cairns and Charters Towers, which included 22 vessels of all kinds, from ships to lighters, which were used to ferry goods and passengers from larger ships to the wharves. The company adopted a flag of red, white and blue, with a <b>Scotch</b> <b>Thistle</b> in the centre.|$|E
5000|$|Orange chats inhabit Australia. The orange chat is {{strongly}} nomadic in arid and semi-arid zones of Australia. They are found mainly within the interior with some sightings {{in the northern}} tropics and very occasionally reaching coasts in South and Western Australia. [...] The orange chat mostly occurs in dry, low lying, saline environments that are rarely flooded such as sparsely vegetated gibber plains, salt pans, salt lakes or claypans. Mainly inhabiting low, treeless chenopod shrublands dominated by saltbush, bluebush or samphire, with either open or continuous shrub cover. Sometimes recorded in other open or shrubby habitats, often near wetlands: low mulga, low buloke woodland; open acacia scrubland; dongas vegetated with tall shrubs or small trees including mulga, dead finish, belah or sugarwood; grassland; or sedgeland. The orange chat has occasionally been recorded in mallee woodlands and on farmlands, including areas over-run by <b>scotch</b> <b>thistle.</b>|$|E
50|$|The HIBG and KCIC were gifted to Acadia University by the Irving {{family on}} September 14, 2002. The Harriet Irving Botanical Gardens are named after Kenneth Colin Irving 's wife, Harriet Irving. The gardens were {{designed}} by architect Alex Novell and construction began {{in the fall of}} 1999. It was the intention of the Irving family to create a space that would be conducive to the interaction of ideas from students, faculty, and the community. The emblem of the gardens features a mayflower; the official flower of Nova Scotia, as well as Harriet Irving's favorite flower, a honey bee representing hard work, and the <b>scotch</b> <b>thistle</b> symbolizing Scotland from where the Irving family originated, as well as the country Nova Scotia is named after.
