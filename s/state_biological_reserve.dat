50|$|The {{first part}} of {{restoring}} the pink-legged graveteiro back to sustainable numbers, is the conservation of the Atlantic Forest. There are many conservation efforts already in place that are meant to serve the Atlantic Forest, which is home to {{five percent of the}} world’s vertebrate species and eight percent of the world’s plants. Only about eight percent of unbroken original habitat is left to support this hotspot. The government of Brazil is working to protect this vital piece of habitat by setting aside land for 108 national state parks, 85 federal and <b>state</b> <b>biological</b> <b>reserves,</b> and 31 federal and state ecological reserves, totaling 225 different areas set aside for conservation. Another successful program put in place is the private reserve system, which covers almost 1,000 kilometers of the Atlantic Forest. One main strategy that is in place to encourage biodiversity is establishing corridors because the habitats that are remaining are severely fragmented. There are many corridors being established to connect the wildlife, but the main one in the Atlantic Forest is located in the south part of Bahia and Espirito Santo.|$|R
50|$|Cuatro Ciénegas is an {{official}} Mexican <b>biological</b> <b>reserve.</b> The <b>biological</b> <b>reserves</b> are small ecosystems with unique fauna and flora {{that are highly}} protected by government authorities. Recently, NASA <b>stated</b> that the <b>biological</b> <b>reserve</b> of Cuatrociénegas could have strong links to discovering life on Mars, since the adaptability of bioforms in the region was unique in the world. There are some 150 different plants and animals endemic to the valley and its surrounding mountains (e.g., Fouquieria shrevei and Terrapene coahuila), including some 30 aquatic species in the Reserve, eight of which are fish (e.g., Herichthys minckleyi).|$|R

40|$|Knowledge of climatic {{variability}} at small spatial extents (< 50 km) {{is needed to}} assess vul-nerabilities of <b>biological</b> <b>reserves</b> to climate change. We used empirical and modeled weather station data to test if climate change has increased the synchrony of surface air temperatures among 50 sites within the Greater Yellowstone Area (GYA) of the interior western United <b>States.</b> This important <b>biological</b> <b>reserve</b> is the largest protected area in the Lower 48 states and provides critical habitat {{for some of the}} world’s most iconic wildlife. We focused our analyses on temporal shifts and shape changes in the annual distributions of seasonal minimum and maximum air temperatures among valley-bottom and higher eleva-tion sites from 1948 – 2012. We documented consistent patterns of warming since 1948 at all 50 sites, with the most pronounced changes occurring during the Winter and Summer when minimum and maximum temperature distributions increased. These shifts indicate more hot temperatures and less cold temperatures would be expected across the GYA. Though the shifting statistical distributions indicate warming, little change {{in the shape of the}} temperature distributions across sites since 1948 suggest the GYA has maintained...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of the application of high-resolution satellite images (Quickbird and SPOT- 5) in the mapping of land use/land cover of a protected area in the Atlantic forest of southern Brazil (Serra Geral <b>State</b> <b>Biological</b> <b>Reserve).</b> We used geographic information systems and remote sensing techniques to define environmental zones within the reserve and to identify potential ecological corridors around it. The use of QuickBird and SPOT- 5 satellite images allowed a detailed mapping of the area, including definition of vegetation zones and a clear differentiation of araucaria vs. broadleaved rain forests and of early/medium successional vs. old-growth forests stages. We conclude that high-resolution satellite images are fully adequate for environmental characterization of natural protected areas. The products generated by this study may also be used to monitor future vegetational/land use changes within the reserve. Pages: 4163 - 417...|$|E
