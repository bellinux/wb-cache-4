5|$|On {{the morning}} of 6 March, another convoy arrived at Hyane Harbour: five LSTs, each towing an LCM, with the 12th Cavalry and other units and {{equipment}} including five Landing Vehicles Tracked (LVTs) of the 592ndEBSR, three M3 light tanks of the 603rd Tank Company, and twelve 105mm howitzers of the 271st Field Artillery Battalion. The 12thCavalry was ordered to follow the 2ndSquadron, 7thCavalry in its advance to the north, and to capture the <b>Salami</b> Plantation. The road to <b>Salami</b> {{was little more than}} a muddy track in which vehicles soon became bogged. The Japanese also obstructed the route with ditches, felled trees, snipers, and booby traps. WO2 R.J. Booker of ANGAU used his local knowledge to guide the 12th Cavalry and the three tanks to <b>Salami.</b> Here the Japanese put up a fierce fight that lasted over an hour. The tanks fired canister shot shells into buildings and high-explosive shells into the slits of Japanese bunkers.|$|E
5|$|According to Vrba's memoir, a Polish kapo by {{the name}} of Yup told him on 15 January 1944 that he was {{part of a group of}} prisoners who were {{building}} a new railway line that would lead straight into the crematoria. Yup said an SS officer had told a million Hungarian Jews would soon be arriving at Auschwitz. Vrba said he also overheard SS guards discuss how they would soon have Hungarian <b>salami.</b> When Jews from the Netherlands arrived, he wrote, they brought cheese, French Jews brought sardines and Greek Jews brought halva and olives. Now it was Hungarian <b>salami.</b> He had to escape not only for himself, he wrote, but also to raise the alarm.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the coral}} reef, {{conventional}} landing craft {{could not be}} used for the landing at Papitalai Mission. The five LVTs, one a combat type and the other four cargo-carrying, set out from Hyane Harbour to <b>Salami</b> Plantation but the road was so bad that only the combat and one cargo LVT were available in time. The attack went ahead anyway, preceded by an airstrike and artillery bombardment by the 271st Field Artillery Battalion. The combat LVT fired 24M8 4.5-inch rockets. Return fire was received from Japanese mortars and machine guns, and a 75mm howitzer. The first wave had to hold alone in the face of fire from Japanese bunkers for 45minutes until the LVTs returned with the next wave. Later, they fought off a counterattack by about 30Japanese. Joined by a third LVT which had eventually managed to make it to <b>Salami,</b> the LVTs made 16trips across the harbour before nightfall curtailed operations, transporting part of the 2ndSquadron, 12thCavalry, along with rations, water and ammunition, and evacuating the dead and wounded.|$|E
5|$|Vrba {{is clear}} that warning the Hungarian {{community}} {{was one of the}} motives for his escape. He wrote that in January 1944 a Polish kapo told him that a million Hungarian Jews would soon arrive at Auschwitz, and that a new railway line was being built to accommodate them. He also overheard SS guards discuss how they would soon be eating Hungarian <b>salami.</b>|$|E

5|$|There is {{no mention}} of Hungarian Jews in the Vrba–Wetzler report. Vrba first said he escaped to warn Hungarian Jews on 27 February 1961, in the first {{installment}} of a five-article series for the Daily Herald in England, written up by Alan Bestic. In the second installment the next day he described having overheard the SS say they were looking forward to Hungarian <b>salami.</b> Vrba's failure to mention Hungarian Jews until 1961 has led several historians, including Miroslav Kárný and Randolph L. Braham, to dispute Vrba's later recollections, although they do not doubt the Vrba–Wetzler report itself.|$|E
5|$|General Krueger was gravely {{concerned}} about {{the seriousness of the}} situation on Los Negros. In response to urgent request from General Chase, Krueger arranged with Admiral Barbey for the movement {{of the rest of the}} 1st Cavalry Division to be expedited. At Krueger's request, the 2ndSquadron, 7th Cavalry would travel in the three APDs. Other units would arrive on 6 and 9March instead of 9 and 16March. Krueger realised that Hyane harbour was too small to support the entire division, but there were good beaches around <b>Salami</b> Plantation on the western shore of Los Negros. In order to use them, and to permit a shore-to-shore operation against Manus from Los Negros, Seeadler Harbour would have to be opened up.|$|E
5|$|When {{the second}} {{version of the}} story was {{translated}} into English by Michael Turner and Leslie Lonsdale-Cooper, they made a number of alterations to the text. For instance, Monsieur Tom Hawake, whose name was a pun on tomahawk, was renamed Mr. Maurice Oyle, and the Slift factory was renamed Grynd Corp. Other changes were made to render the story more culturally understandable to an Anglophone readership; whereas the factory originally sold its mix of dogs, cats, and rats as hare pâté—a food uncommon in Britain—the English translation rendered the mix as <b>salami.</b> In another instance, garlic, pepper, and salt were added to the mixture in the French version, but this was changed to mustard, pepper, and salt for the English version, again reflecting British culinary tastes.|$|E

5|$|Additional {{force in}} Polish politics, the {{long-established}} Polish Socialist Party (Polska Partia Socjalistyczna, PPS), suffered a fatal split at this time, as the ruling Stalinists applied the <b>salami</b> tactics to dismember the opposition. Communist politicians {{cooperated with the}} left-wing PPS faction led by Józef Cyrankiewicz, prime minister under new president Bierut from February 1947. The socialists' originally tactical decision to collaborate with the communists resulted in their institutional demise. Cyrankiewicz visited Stalin in Moscow in March 1948 to discuss {{the idea of a}} party merger. The Kremlin, increasingly uncomfortable with Gomułka's communist party leadership, concurred, and Cyrankiewicz secured his own political place for the future (until 1972). In December 1948, after the removal of Gomułka and imposition of Bierut as the communist Polish Workers' Party chief, the PPR and Cyrankiewicz's rump PPS joined ranks to form the Polish United Workers' Party (Polska Zjednoczona Partia Robotnicza; PZPR), in power for the next four decades. Poland became a de facto one-party state and a satellite state of the Soviet Union. Only two other parties were allowed to exist legally: United People's Party, a small farmers' party, and the Democratic Party, a token intelligentsia party (see also: political organization in Poland 1945–1989).|$|E
5|$|From the Japanese perspective, {{the battle}} was not going too well either. The Japanese had {{expected}} a landing on Seeadler Harbour, this being the logical American objective, and had concentrated their forces around the Lorengau airfield. The defence of the Momote airstrip and Hyane harbour was the responsibility of Baba Force, built around Captain Baba's 1stBattalion, 229th Infantry Regiment. Colonel Ezaki ordered Baba to attack the beachhead but a suspicion the Hyane Harbour landing was a diversion, coupled with false reports of enemy activity at <b>Salami</b> had him retain the 2nd (Iwakami) Battalion of the 1st Independent Infantry Regiment there instead of sending it to assist Baba Force. By 2March, Ezaki had resolved to attack the Hyane beachhead with his whole force. The difficulties imposed by the terrain, and disruption by American artillery and Allied naval gunfire, forced a postponement of the attack to the night of 3March.|$|E
25|$|Another worth-mentioning specialty, {{also common}} to most villages in {{southern}} area of Chieti's province, is the ventricina, a usually round-shaped <b>salami</b> made of fresh pork finely chopped and mingled {{with bits of}} lard, ground dried red medium-spicy peppers, fennel seeds, and coarse salt, usually prepared during the colder winter days of January (after the first snow falls it is tradition to slaughter a pig), then hanged on the ceiling in a dry room and seasoned for usually 1+ months until ready to be sliced and served with freshly baked bread as an appetizer. At the same time, fresh pork sausages and pig liver sausages and several varieties of <b>salami</b> are prepared as well.|$|E
