40|$|INTRODUCTION: It was {{the goal}} of this study to compare {{different}} NaOCl activation schemes regarding a desired and an untoward outcome. Ultrasonic tips and a currently marketed sonic system were used in conjunction with a 2. 5 % sodium hypochlorite solution. Necrotic pulp tissue dissolution in simulated accessory canals and transportation of the main canal were assessed. METHODS: Epoxy resin models (10 per group) with a curved simulated main root canal and two simulated accessory canals filled with necrotic bovine pulp tissue were irrigated passively with one of three ultrasonic setups (straight stainless <b>steel</b> <b>files,</b> prebent stainless <b>steel</b> <b>files,</b> or nickel-titanium tips) or a sonic device in conjunction with a plastic tip. Activation was performed four times for 30 seconds with replenishment of the NaOCl solution in between. All the files/tips had a 2 % taper and a 0. 15 -mm tip diameter according to the manufacturer. Data from superimposing and analyzing digital photos before and after treatment were statistically analyzed using one-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's correction for multiple comparisons (alpha < 0. 05). RESULTS: Passive ultrasonic irrigation (PUI) in all the groups dissolved significantly more tissue than sonic activation (p < 0. 05). No detectable canal transportation with sonic activation was observed. The difference in this outcome was not significant compared with ultrasonically activated nickel-titanium tips, whereas the straight stainless <b>steel</b> <b>files</b> caused significantly more ledging compared with these setups (p < 0. 05). CONCLUSION: Under the current conditions, PUI with a nickel-titanium tip promoted superior tissue-dissolving effects over sonic irrigant activation while maintaining simulated canal anatomy...|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} the residual dentin thickness in upper anterior teeth at 4 mm {{short of the}} apex and provide theoretical basis for the width of post space end preparation. Methods 60 upper anterior teeth with straight root canals {{were randomly assigned to}} 3 groups (n= 20) and prepared,Group A:stainless <b>steel</b> <b>file</b> conventional root canal preparation technique; Group B:Gate-Glidden drill coronal preflaring + stainless <b>steel</b> <b>file</b> conventional root canal preparation technique; Group C:ProTaper for hand crown-down technique. The roots were cut horizontally at cement-enamel junction and 4 mm short of the apex. The minimum width of residual root was measured on mesial and distal wall by a vernier caliper gauge. Results The minimum width means of residual root among 3 groups were larger than 1 mm after root canal preparation. Linear correlation analysis showed that there were no correlation between the residual dentin thickness at cement-enamel junction and 4 mm short of the apex besides B group distal wall. Conclusion 3 # peeso reamer was recommended to prepare post space end in upper anterior teeth after root canal preparation in most cases. 目的探討上頜前牙根管預備后距根尖 4 mm處根管壁的最小厚度,為臨床預備樁腔末端的寬度提供理論依據。方法離體直單根管上前牙 60 個,隨機分為 3 組(n= 20) 進行根管預備,A組:不銹鋼根管銼常規法;B組:G型鉆根管冠部預處理+不銹鋼根管銼常規法;C組:手用ProTaper鎳鈦根管銼冠向下法。所有牙齒用金剛砂片分別在距根尖 4 mm處和釉牙骨質界處截斷牙根,截斷面垂直于根管。用游標卡尺測量斷面根管近中壁、遠中壁最薄處厚度。結果三種方法根管預備后距根尖 4 mm處和釉牙骨質界處剩余根管壁厚度均數都大于 1 mm。釉牙骨質界處與距根尖 4 mm處剩余根管壁厚度之間行直線相關分析,只有B組釉牙骨質界處與距根尖 4 mm處遠中壁剩余根管壁厚度之間存在線性相關,其它組之間均不存在線性相關。結論對于大多數病例,經三種方法根管預備后,推薦使用 3 #P型鉆預備上頜前牙樁腔末端...|$|E

Foram utilizados 90 dentes bovinos, as coroas cortadas com disco diamantado, obtendo-se ra?zes com 17 mm de comprimento. As ra?zes foram tratadas endodonticamente pela t?cnica coroa-?pice at? o instrumento de mem?ria n? 80, a uma profundidade de 16 mm e divididas aleatoriamente em 6 grupos de acordo com o protocolo de ativa??o/subst?ncia qu?mica final: PPIN: PPI + NaOCl 5, 25 %; PUIN: PUI + NaOCl 5, 25 %; CUIN: CUI + NaOCl 5, 25 %; PPIC: PPI + CHX 2 %; PUIC: PUI + CHX 2 %; e CUIC: CUI + CHX 2 %. A irriga??o final de todos os grupos foi realizada com 2 ml de subst?ncia qu?mica + 1 ml de EDTA 17 % + 1 ml de subst?ncia qu?mica. Nos grupos PPIN e PPIC foram utilizadas pontas endod?nticas Navitip? para a irriga??o. Nos grupos PUIN e PUIC, foram utilizadas as mesmas pontas endod?nticas Navitip? e ativadas passivamente com inserto E 1 IRRISONIC? acoplado ao Ultrassom EMS? (10 s), frequ?ncia de 32. 000 Hz, sem renova??o da subst?ncia qu?mica. Nos grupos CUIN e CUIC a subst?ncia qu?mica foi continuamente ativada e renovada com inserto E 1 IRRISONIC? acoplado ao Ultrassom EMS? (10 s). Todas as ra?zes foram lavadas com ?gua destilada para remo??o dos res?duos e secas com cones de papel absorvente. As ra?zes tiveram os ?pices selados com gutta percha. Ap?s o preparo dos condutos, foi feita a cimenta??o do pino de fibra de vidro Whitepost? DC n. 2 com cimento resinoso dual RelyX ARC? e sistema adesivo Single Bond Universal?. As ra?zes foram seccionadas transversalmente em 9 fatias, de aproximadamente 1 mm de espessura, divididas entre os ter?os cervical, m?dio e apical. Ap?s 7 dias, as fatias foram submetidas ao teste de extrus?o push-out em m?quina de ensaio universal EMIC (0, 5 mm/min, 150 N). Os valores de resist?ncia adesiva (RA) foram submetidos a ANOVA a 2 crit?rios e teste de Tukey para compara??o das m?dias (p? 0, 05). Resultados: Os valores m?dios em MPa (?dp) foram: PPIN 4, 46 (1, 43); PUIN 6, 13 (2, 35); CUIN 7, 41 (1, 83); PPIC 3, 59 (1, 70); PUIC 5, 49 (1, 41); CUIC 6, 0 (1, 63). Comparando-se as solu??es irrigadoras, os resultados foram semelhantes com cada tipo de t?cnica. CUI foi a t?cnica que apresentou os melhores valores de ades?o e PPI apresentou o menor valor, sendo semelhante ? PUI. Analisando os ter?os radiculares, o grupo CUIN demonstrou diferen?a estatisticamente significante na regi?o apical e m?dio respectivamente: 5, 48 (2, 47) e 5, 92 (2, 46). Conclus?o: CUI foi a melhor t?cnica de irriga??o em rela??o ? ades?o dos pinos de fibra de vidro, independentemente da solu??o irrigadora utilizada, influenciando positivamente na ades?o da regi?o apical. The aim of {{this study}} was to evaluate the influence of tree final irrigation systems: PPI (Positive Pressure Irrigation), PUI (Passive Ultrasonic Irrigation) and CUI (Continuous Ultrasonic Irrigation) on the push-out resistence of glass fiber posts, using 5. 25 % NaOCl (sodium hypochlorite) or 2 % CHX (chrorexidine) as irrigation solution. Ninety 17 mm length bovine roots were endodontically treated up to K File # 80, to a working length of 16 mm, using crown-down technique. During the instrumentation all roots received 1 ml of irrigation solution (5. 25 % NaOCl or 2 % CHX) between each instrument using a Navitip? needle. The samples were randomly divided into six groups, according to final irrigation and activation system: PPIN (Control 1) : PPI + 5. 25 % NaOCl; PUIN: PUI + 5. 25 % NaOCl; CUIN: CUI + 5. 25 % NaOCl; PPIC (Control 2) : PPI + 2 % CHX; PUIC: PUI + 2 % CHX and CUIC: CUI + 2 % CHX. For PPIN/PPIC a Navitip? needle was used to deliver the irrigation solution. For PUIN/PUIC the same Navitip? needle was used and the irrigant solution was activated by a stainless <b>steel</b> <b>file</b> E 1 Irrisonic? mounted on a EMS? Ultrassonic unit, for 10 -seconds. For CUIN/CUIC the irrigation and activation were performed by continuous agitation and irrigant solution delivery, for 10 -seconds, using the same stainless <b>steel</b> <b>file</b> E 1 Irrisonic? mounted on EMS? Ultrassonic unit. The final irrigation of all groups was performed using 2 ml irrigation solution + 1 ml 17 % EDTA + 2 ml irrigation solution. After canal preparation, the fiber posts Whitepost? DC n. 2 were cemented with dual cure resin cement RelyX ARC? and adhesive system Single Bond Universal?. The roots were sectioned into 1 mm-thick slices, on cervical, medial and apical thirds. After 7 days, the slices were submitted to push-out test on universal testing machine EMIC (0, 5 mm/min, 150 N). Mean values of bond strength (BS) were compared using two-way ANOVA and Tukey?s test (p? 0. 05). BS values (?dp) were: PPIN 4. 46 (1. 43); PUIN 6. 13 (2. 35); CUIN 7. 41 (1. 83); PPIC 3. 59 (1. 70); PUIC 5. 49 (1. 41); CUIC 6. 0 (1. 63). Comparing irrigation solutions, the results were similar with each irrigation systems. CUI showed the best bond strenght values and PPI the worst one, similar to PUI. Analyzing the root thirds, CUIN showed significant diferences at apical third and CUIC showed diferences at middle third. Conclusion: CUI was the best activation system, regardless of the irrigation solution choice, providing better results at fiber post bond strenght, mainly at apical third...|$|E

40|$|Aim: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the periapical healing of molar root canal {{treatment}} using two instrumentation techniques. Methods: A total of 225 maxillary and mandibular first and second permanent molars endodontically treated by undergraduate or postgraduate students were randomly selected from a computerized hospital database of which 110 molars had been prepared using a hybrid rotary technique with nickel-titanium instruments (group NR) and 115 with hand stainless <b>steel</b> <b>files</b> (group HF). Patients were recalled and the teeth were examined both clinically and radiographically for signs of periapical inflammation. Results: Some 19 % and 39 % of teeth in the NR and HF group, respectively, were judged to have some form of procedural errors. A higher rate of periapical healing was noted for NR (77 %) than the HF group (60 %) (p < 0. 05). Factors contributing favorably to treatment outcome included the use of rotary technique, maxillary molar, experienced operator, and absence of preoperative radiolucent lesion.
