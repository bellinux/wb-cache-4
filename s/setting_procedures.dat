40|$|The {{population}} {{consisting of}} young people with Behavioral/Emotional/Learning challenges typically experiences poorer outcomes related to employment, {{in part due to}} lower performance levels. Effective strategies, which {{have a positive impact on}} work performance for this population, are needed. Goal setting has been used to bring about behavior change, or increase 2 ̆ 7 motivation 2 ̆ 7, in many fields of study. Goal setting can be conceptualized as an establishing operation (EO), which increases the reinforcing value of goal achievement, and thereby increases the probability of the occurrence of behaviors related to reaching the goal, i. e., task completion. This study empirically examined the impact of a goal <b>setting</b> <b>procedure</b> on work-related behaviors through the use of a singlecase experimental design, to detect the individual results of the goal setting intervention, which included the manipulation of environmental events to explain behavior change, or 2 ̆ 7 motivation 2 ̆ 7. It was hypothesized that the goal <b>setting</b> <b>procedure</b> would have a positive impact on work performance for these young people with challenges in a work-type setting. Results showed that the goal <b>setting</b> <b>procedure</b> did have a positive impact on the work performance of both participants, especially when additional prompts were included in the goal <b>setting</b> <b>procedure.</b> Although goal <b>setting</b> may serve as an EO, the goal <b>setting</b> <b>procedure,</b> which included additional elements such as prompts and feedback, seemed to be more effective...|$|R

The {{purpose of the present}} paper is to review the Bookmark procedure and then evaluate it in terms of Berk’s (1986) criteria for evaluating standard-setting methods. Finally, {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the Bookmark procedure are critically examined and discussed. In conclusion, the strengths of the Bookmark method are that it (a) accommodates constructedresponse as well as selected-response test items; (b) efficiently accommodates multiple cutscores and multiple test forms; and (c) reduces cognitive complexity for panelists.

50|$|Following the {{assassination}} of Mahatma Gandhi in 1948, the RSS was banned, {{and many of its}} senior functionaries faced arrest. Ranade went underground during this time to lead organizational efforts, earning the moniker of the Underground Sarsanghchalak. At the same time a Satyagraha was launched by the RSS under the direction of its leader M. S. Golwalkar to lift the ban. With Golwalkar arrested on 15 November, Ranade led the satyagraha and participated in secret negotiations with Home Minister Sardar Patel. As a condition for rescinding the RSS ban, Patel insisted that the RSS should be organised with a written constitution. A constitution was drawn up by Ranade in association with P. B. Dani and Balasaeb Deoras but it fell short of expectations of the Government and as a result it was redrafted to include clauses such as allegiance to the Indian Constitution and National Flag, shunning violence, enrolling under aged to the movement only with the permission of their parents, <b>setting</b> <b>procedures</b> for election of sarsanghchalak and so forth.

50|$|Entrance-Exit Interlocking (NX) was the {{original}} brand name {{of the first generation}} relay-based centralized traffic control (CTC) interlocking system introduced in 1936 by GRS (represented in Europe by Metropolitan-Vickers). The advent of all electric interlocking technology allowed for more automated route <b>setting</b> <b>procedures</b> as opposed to having an operator line each part of the route manually. The NX system allowed an operator looking at the diagram of a complicated junction to simply push a button on the known entrance track and another button on the desired exit track, and the logic circuitry handled all the necessary actions of commanding the underlying relay interlocking to set signals and throw switches in the proper sequence as required to provide valid route through the interlocking plant. The first NX installation was in 1937 at Brunswick on the Cheshire Lines, UK. The first US installation was on the New York Central Railroad (NYCRR) at Girard Junction, Ohio in 1937. Another NYCRR installation was on the main line between Utica, New York and Rochester, New York, and this was quickly followed up by three installations on the New York City Subway's IND Fulton Street Line in 1948.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} the paper {{is to provide a}} {{methodology}} aimed at improving the setting up of air-jet looms by clarifying the function which links different important variables involved in the <b>setting</b> <b>procedure</b> and by proposing a method to measure the quality of fabrics depending on the factor values. Design/methodology/approach – The proposed procedure is based on the use of a load sensor: the tension profile received from it is used to analyse the weft behaviour and, sometimes, to predict any quality problems. Because of the high number of variables influencing the set up, the factorial experiments have been used to develop the <b>setting</b> <b>procedure.</b> Numerical results have been analyzed by means of a regression analysis and an ANOVA analysis. Findings – Relationships among different variables and their influence {{on the quality of the}} fabric have been derived thanks to the use of a load sensor. Research limitations/implications – So far, the proposed procedure has been developed for air-jet looms and for a limited set of fabrics, but it could be adapted in other situations as well. Practical implications – Use of the proposed procedure allows practitioners to reduce cost and time of the setting up of air jet looms. High productivity of air jet looms could be thus better exploited also for producing small batches of products. Originality/value – The combination of the load sensor and the statistical analysis allowed the development of a systematic <b>setting</b> <b>procedure</b> for air-jet looms...|$|R
