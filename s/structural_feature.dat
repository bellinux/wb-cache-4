5|$|Sphingolipids are a {{complicated}} family of compounds that {{share a common}} <b>structural</b> <b>feature,</b> a sphingoid base backbone that is synthesized de novo from the amino acid serine and a long-chain fatty acyl CoA, then converted into ceramides, phosphosphingolipids, glycosphingolipids and other compounds. The major sphingoid base of mammals is {{commonly referred to as}} sphingosine. Ceramides (N-acyl-sphingoid bases) are a major subclass of sphingoid base derivatives with an amide-linked fatty acid. The fatty acids are typically saturated or mono-unsaturated with chain lengths from 16 to 26 carbon atoms.|$|E

40|$|So far, many network-structure-based link {{prediction}} {{methods have}} been proposed. However, these methods only highlight one or two <b>structural</b> <b>features</b> of networks, and then use the methods to predict missing links in different networks. The performances of these existing methods are not always satisfied in all cases since each network has its unique underlying <b>structural</b> <b>features.</b> In this paper, by analyzing different real networks, {{we find that the}} <b>structural</b> <b>features</b> of different networks are remarkably different. In particular, even in the same network, their inner <b>structural</b> <b>features</b> are utterly different. Therefore, more <b>structural</b> <b>features</b> should be considered. However, owing to the remarkably different <b>structural</b> <b>features,</b> the contributions of different features are hard to be given in advance. Inspired by these facts, an adaptive fusion model regarding link prediction is proposed to incorporate multiple <b>structural</b> <b>features.</b> In the model, a logistic function combing multiple <b>structural</b> <b>features</b> is defined, then the weight of each feature in the logistic function is adaptively determined by exploiting the known structure information. Last, we use the "learnt" logistic function to predict the connection probabilities of missing links.

Thence she would be a poliad goddess related to politics, power and war.

40|$|Graph {{databases}} supporting retrieval {{based on}} structural similarity utilize structure indexes. A structure index is a data structure that indexes different <b>structural</b> <b>features</b> of member graphs. These features are typically extracted at insertion time. However, as {{the extraction of}} <b>structural</b> <b>features</b> may suffer from combinatorial explosion, the structure index takes long insertion time and large disk space. The member graphs cannot be modified, since even a simple structural modification may require re-extraction of <b>structural</b> <b>features.</b> The depth to which <b>structural</b> <b>features</b> were extracted during insertion, forms a hard limit on query precision, which cannot be changed at query time.

500|$|An {{important}} <b>structural</b> <b>feature</b> of RNA {{that distinguishes}} it from DNA {{is the presence}} of a hydroxyl group at the 2' position of the ribose sugar. The presence of this functional group causes the helix to mostly adopt the A-form geometry, although in single strand dinucleotide contexts, RNA can rarely also adopt the B-form most commonly observed in DNA. [...] The A-form geometry results in a very deep and narrow major groove and a shallow and wide minor groove. A second consequence of the presence of the 2'-hydroxyl group is that in conformationally flexible regions of an RNA molecule (that is, not involved in formation of a double helix), it can chemically attack the adjacent phosphodiester bond to cleave the backbone.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Nucleosome {{distribution}} along chromatin dictates genomic DNA accessibility {{and thus}} profoundly influences gene expression. However, the underlying mechanism of nucleosome formation remains elusive. Here, taking a structural perspective, we systematically explored nucleosome formation potential of genomic sequences {{and the effect}} on chromatin organization and gene expression in S. cerevisiae. Results We analyzed twelve <b>structural</b> <b>features</b> related to flexibility, curvature and energy of DNA sequences. The results showed that some <b>structural</b> <b>features</b> such as DNA denaturation, DNA-bending stiffness, Stacking energy, Z-DNA, Propeller twist and free energy, were highly correlated with in vitro and in vivo nucleosome occupancy. Specifically, they can be classified into two classes, one positively and the other negatively correlated with nucleosome occupancy. These two kinds of <b>structural</b> <b>features</b> facilitated nucleosome binding in centromere regions and repressed nucleosome formation in the promoter regions of protein-coding genes to mediate transcriptional regulation. Based on these analyses, we integrated all twelve <b>structural</b> <b>features</b> in a model to predict more accurately nucleosome occupancy in vivo than the existing methods that mainly depend on sequence compositional features. Furthermore, we developed a novel approach, named DLaNe, that located nucleosomes by detecting peaks of structural profiles, and built a meta predictor to integrate information from different <b>structural</b> <b>features.</b> As a comparison, we also constructed a hidden Markov model (HMM) to locate nucleosomes based on the profiles of these <b>structural</b> <b>features.</b> The result showed that the meta DLaNe and HMM-based method performed better than the existing methods, demonstrating the power of these <b>structural</b> <b>features</b> in predicting nucleosome positions. Conclusions Our analysis revealed that DNA structures significantly contribute to nucleosome organization and influence chromatin structure and gene expression regulation. The results indicated that our proposed methods are effective in predicting nucleosome occupancy and positions and that these <b>structural</b> <b>features</b> are highly predictive of nucleosome organization. The implementation of our DLaNe method based on <b>structural</b> <b>features</b> is available online. </p...|$|R

The sea acts as an arbiter {{of good and evil}} and the barrier of fate, as in the mercantilist fifteenth-century poem The Libelle of Englyshe Polycye. Mediaeval romances frequently ascribe a prominent role to the sea. The originally Mediterranean family of Apollonius of Tyre romances use the Odyssean format of the extended sea voyage. The story may have influenced Guillaume Roi d'Angleterre and Chaucer’s The Man of Law's Tale. Other romances, such as the Romance of Horn, the Conte del Graal of Chrétien de Troyes, Partonopeu de Blois or the Tristan legend employ the sea as a <b>structural</b> <b>feature</b> and source of motifs: setting adrift, mythical islands, and self-propelled ships. Some of these maritime motifs appear in the lais of Marie de France. Many religious works written in the Middle Ages reflect on the sea. The ascetic sea desert (heremum in oceano) appears in [...] Adomnán’s Life of Columba or The Voyage of Saint Brendan, an entirely seaborne tale cognate with the Irish immram or maritime pilgrimage tale. The Old English poem The Seafarer has a similar background. Sermons sometimes speak of the sea {{of the world and the}} ship of the Church, and moralistic interpretations of shipwreck and floods. These motifs in chronicles such as the Chronica majora of Matthew Paris, and Adam of Bremen’s History of the Archbishops of Hamburg-Bremen. Similar motives are treated in Biblical paraphrases, e.g. the anonymous Middle English poem Patience, and pilgrimage narratives and poems such as The Book of Margery Kempe, Saewulf's Voyage, The Pilgrims' Sea Voyage. Marian devotion created prayers to Mary as the Star of the Sea (stella maris), both as lyrics and as features in larger works like John Gower's Vox Clamantis.|$|E

Traditional promoter analysis is mainly based on sequence compositional features. Recently, {{many kinds of}} <b>structural</b> <b>features</b> have been employed in promoter prediction. However, considering the high-dimensionality and overfitting problems, it is unfeasible to utilize all available features for promoter prediction. Thus {{it is necessary to}} choose some appropriate features for the prediction task. Results This paper conducts an extensive comparison study on feature selection of DNA structural properties for promoter prediction. Firstly, to examine whether promoters possess some special structures, we carry out a systematical comparison among the profiles of thirteen <b>structural</b> <b>features</b> on promoter and non-promoter sequences. Secondly, we investigate the correlations between these <b>structural</b> <b>features</b> and promoter sequences. Thirdly, both filter and wrapper methods are utilized to select appropriate feature subsets from thirteen different kinds of <b>structural</b> <b>features</b> for promoter prediction, and the predictive power of the selected feature subsets is evaluated. Finally, we compare the prediction performance of the feature subsets selected in this paper with nine existing promoter prediction approaches. Conclusions Experimental results show that the <b>structural</b> <b>features</b> are differentially correlated to promoters. Specifically, DNA-bending stiffness, DNA denaturation and energy-related features are highly correlated with promoters. The predictive power for promoter sequences differentiates greatly among different <b>structural</b> <b>features.</b> Selecting the relevant features can significantly improve the accuracy of promoter prediction. </p...|$|R
