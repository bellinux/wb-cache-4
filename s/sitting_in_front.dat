5|$|Scenes of {{the music}} video include Carey sitting beside a river in the forest covered in gold glitter, <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of waterfalls and {{tropical}} wildlife, and imitating a mermaid by swimming underwater while wearing an evening gown. The remix video with Songz premiered two days later on Valentine's Day on BET's 106 & Park. Songz appears in both versions of the video, whereby he is seen modelling shirtless at a photoshoot, but only performs his verses in the remix video. Carey praised Songz for bringing something artistically different to the videos.|$|E
5|$|The UK edition {{contained}} Bob Cato's colour {{photo of}} Harrison <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of an antique car, with art {{direction for the}} package being credited to Cream designs. The international CD release of the album uses the latter cover. The inner sleeve of the original LP in Britain contained a picture by Michael Putland, showing Harrison on a wintry beach in Cannes, where he was attending the Midem music-industry trade fair in January 1976. A third front-cover option came with MFP's budget reissue during the 1980s, which reproduced Harrison's 1968 White Album portrait.|$|E
5|$|After {{a period}} within the sangha, Koṇḍañña retired to the Himalayas {{for the last}} twelve years of his life. This is {{attributed}} to two reasons in Buddhist literature. The first reason was that Koṇḍañña considered his presence {{to be a source}} of inconvenience for Sariputra and Moggallana, the two chief disciples of The Buddha. As the seniormost member of the sangha, Koṇḍañña lead the monks on the alms-round, but during dharma talks, the two chief disciples sat on either side of the Buddha and Koṇḍañña behind them. The two chief disciples were uncomfortable <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of Koṇḍañña, so he decided to solve the problem by absenting himself. The other reason to which Koṇḍañña's leave is attributed was to spend more quiet time in religious practice, which was rendered difficult due to the attention that the sangha gained from the public.|$|E

5|$|Cyan playtested {{the game}} with two people <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the game, finding that they would {{converse}} {{with each other and}} vocalize their likes and dislikes compared to one person silently playing. Rand and Robyn sat behind the testers taking notes, and could make on-the-fly changes and fixes. Cyan wanted the interface of the game to be invisible, and to craft a game that all kinds of people would enjoy. Early on they had decided {{that there would be no}} inventory, enemies, or ways to die; eventually they included a save system as a concession to the fact that it would take most players months to complete the game. Among the problems testers discovered with the story was that Myst initially had no inciting incident. In response, Cyan added a note from Atrus to Catherine that clued players into the existence of a chamber by the dock that played a message from Atrus and explained the game's objectives.|$|E
5|$|Gibson {{eventually}} {{discovers the}} game's location and sends a SWAT team, who are sealed {{in another room}} and killed by toxic gas. Simultaneously, he and two officers infiltrate Hoffman's command center in the junkyard, where they find Dan's corpse <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of several monitors connected to the police headquarter's security cameras. He sees Hoffman brought into the morgue in a body bag and tries to warn Palmer, but an automatic turret gun rises up and kills him along with his men. Hoffman kills Dr. Heffner, Palmer, and everyone else in his path to Jill, who briefly escapes before she is caught and knocked unconscious. He straps her to a chair and locks a reverse bear trap to her head; she awakens as the timer starts and is killed when the trap activates, tearing her face apart and bleeding profusely.|$|E
5|$|On May 3, Helen Reed {{is seen by}} the Phantom {{leaving a}} grocery store. At home that night, Helen asks her husband Floyd, who is <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of a window in his armchair, if he hears {{somebody}} walking outside. After he replies that he does not, the Phantom shoots him through their window. Helen inspects and sees Floyd dying. As she uses the telephone to call police, the Phantom breaks {{through the screen door}} and shoots her twice in the face. Despite her wounds, she drags herself {{out of the house and}} into a cornfield while the Phantom inspects Floyd's body. The Phantom stalks her with a pickaxe, but leaves when she gets help at a nearby house. News of this attack causes the town to panic, and people begin boarding up their windows.|$|E

Bodson told Msiri {{he had come to}} take him to Stairs, and Msiri did not reply but became angry, rose and put his hand on his sword (a gift brought by Stairs). Bodson drew his {{revolver}} and shot Msiri three times, and one of Msiri's men — his son Masuka — fired his musket hitting Bodson in the abdomen and spinal column. The Dahomeyan askari shot and killed Masuka, and in the general firing Hamadi was hit in the ankle.|$|E

In attempting to make the family forget the past, he forces out the spirit. He seems successful at first; he even brings housebound Denver {{out of the house}} {{for the first time in}} years. But on the way back, they encounter a young woman <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the house, calling herself Beloved. Paul D is suspicious and warns Sethe, but she is charmed by the young woman and ignores him. Gradually, Paul D is forced out of Sethe's home by a supernatural presence.|$|E

25|$|In 1938 the Rosenwald Fund {{provided}} {{money for}} Alston {{to travel to}} the South, which was his first return there since leaving as a child. His travel with Giles Hubert, an inspector for the Farm Security Administration, gave him access to certain situations and he photographed many aspects of rural life. These photographs serves as the basis for a series of genre portraits depicting southern black life. In 1940 he completed Tobacco Farmer, the portrait of a young black farmer in white overalls and a blue shirt with a youthful yet serious look upon his face, <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the landscape and buildings he works on and in. That same year he received a second round of funding from the Rosenwald Fund to travel South, and he spent extended time at Atlanta University.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} morning, up to 100 protesters {{took to the}} street in Saar village, west of Manama. The protest was {{peaceful}} and protesters were chanting anti-government slogans and waving Bahraini flags, witnesses said. Shortly {{before the arrival of}} security forces, the protest dispersed peacefully. In another village south of Manama, the MoI reported that an Asian worker trying to open a blocked road was injured after getting attacked with molotov cocktails and that a main road in Muharraq was blocked with burning tires. It described both incidents as [...] "terrorism". Protests were also held in Malkiya, Juffair and Sitra where protesters held peaceful sit-ins and formed human chains. Some protesters were <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of their houses, still they were attacked by security forces, witnesses reported. A video posted on YouTube showed police arresting and beating two men who were <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of a house.|$|E

Cody stated: There's the scene where Jennifer's sitting alone smearing makeup on her face. I always thought {{that was such a}} sad image. She's so vulnerable. I don't know any woman who hasn't had a moment <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the mirror and thinking, 'Help me, I want to be somebody else.' What makes it extra affecting is that [...] is stunning.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} of the song was {{directed}} by Cameron Duddy and Mars, and was released February 5, 2013. The video portrays the taping of a TV special, in which Mars is playing a lonely balladeer on the ivories while <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of a piano with sunglasses donned and a half-full glass of whiskey atop his instrument, wearing a suit with a carnation boutonnière, while he keeps reminding himself of what {{he could have done}} to keep his lover. The video is based on 70's vibe and retro effects. The set and the idea of the video is similar to one used for [...] "Love in the Key of C", a 1997 Belinda Carlisle minor hit.|$|E
500|$|Central and {{parallel}} to the SDSU student protest movement was an 8 foot high wooden construction fence that encircled the a new campus building. Students quickly put up protest messages, paintings, and cartoons urging students to rally, vote, and challenge the school president. Citing a need to [...] "clean up" [...] the campus during graduation of 1991, President Day attempted to paint over the now symbolic construction fence wall. The night before the attempted wall paint over by President Day, a large police force arrested eight students peacefully <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the wall. The next morning, word quickly gathered on campus about the arrests and dozens of student rushed to {{sit in front of}} the wall ultimately stopping the painters.|$|E

Before Mr. Burns shuts off the power to the town in response to the strike, he says, [...] "From Hell's heart I stab at thee" [...] which is a reference to Captain Ahab's curse, from the novel Moby-Dick. The workers' resistance to the power outage, and Mr. Burns's response, is a parody of How the Grinch Stole Christmas.|$|E
500|$|Gaga {{performed}} the song at the 88th Academy Awards after an introduction by Joe Biden, {{the vice president}} of the United States. She sang it while <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of a white piano, and near its conclusion survivors of sexual assaults joined her onstage, with words like [...] "survivor" [...] and [...] "not your fault" [...] written on their bodies. Mike Ayers from The Wall Street Journal called it a [...] "poignant performance" [...] of the night. Katie Atkinson from Billboard listed the performance as one of the best moments of the awards show, saying that Gaga [...] "made a huge impact on the Oscars stage. Her performance alone would have been powerful enough, but when the curtains opened behind her to reveal a sea of sexual assault survivors standing in solidarity, the emotional bar was raised to the next level." [...] Kesha performed a cover of the song, accompanied with Warren on piano, at the Humane Society Gala in Los Angeles on May 7, 2016.|$|E
500|$|A {{reflector}} sight or {{reflex sight}} is an optical device {{that allows the}} user to look through a partially reflecting glass element and see an illuminated projection of an aiming point or some other image superimposed {{on the field of}} view. These sights work on the simple optical principle that anything at the focus of a lens or curved mirror (such as an illuminated reticle) will look like it is <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the viewer at infinity. Reflector sights employ some sort of [...] "reflector" [...] to allow the viewer to see the infinity image and the field of view at the same time, either by bouncing the image created by lens off a slanted glass plate, or by using a mostly clear curved glass reflector that images the reticle while the viewer looks through the reflector. Since the reticle is at infinity it stays in alignment with the device the sight is attached to regardless of the viewer's eye position, removing most of the parallax and other sighting errors found in simple sighting devices.|$|E
