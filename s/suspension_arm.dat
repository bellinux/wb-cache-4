2500|$|The FIRST Corvette to {{actually}} use an Upper Rear <b>Suspension</b> <b>Arm,</b> {{instead of the}} Drive Shafts performing double duty as the Upper locator arm ...|$|E
50|$|To {{accommodate}} {{the weight of}} the 17-pounder and ammunition an extra wheel station and <b>suspension</b> <b>arm</b> was needed, lengthening the hull. This change in length, without a corresponding change in width across the tracks, reduced mobility compared to the Cromwell, although speed remained high at 25 mph.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{the first}} two {{examples}} of Lotus 12 had De Dion rear suspension, it also introduced a new suspension configuration with {{what came to be}} called [...] "Chapman struts" [...] in the rear, essentially a MacPherson strut with a fixed length halfshaft with universal joints on the ends utilised as a <b>suspension</b> <b>arm.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 2002, the T-Maxx 2.5 was introduced. Revisions {{included}} lengthened <b>suspension</b> <b>arms</b> and Traxxas' new, more powerful, TRX 2.5 nitro engine.|$|R
50|$|The tie-rod end, front top {{and bottom}} {{wishbone}} outside joints and the rear lower wishbone inside joint were Heim joints. The rest of the suspension joints were rubber joint, with joint-mounting pipes welded onto the ends of <b>suspension</b> <b>arms.</b> While most of the <b>suspension</b> <b>arms</b> were in common with Lotus 22, {{the angle of the}} rear radius arms on the plan view was different from the narrower-frame Lotus 22, so they were not interchangeable with the 22.|$|R
50|$|The {{suspension}} at each {{wheel station}} consists of coil springs and hydropneumatic shock-absorbers {{acting on the}} <b>suspension</b> <b>arms</b> of the wheel mechanism. The tyres have puncture-proof Hutchinson inner tubes.|$|R
50|$|The front {{suspension}} initially had outboard {{springs and}} shock absorbers, but with later versions, this was moved inboard with a rocker arm upper <b>suspension</b> <b>arm.</b> There were {{two types of}} rear suspension offered: one with a live axle, located by trailing arms, leading arms and a panhard rod. The other had independent rear suspension.|$|E
50|$|The {{running gear}} {{consists}} of six dual rubber lined road wheels, with three return rollers {{on each side}} and connector type tracks. The suspension consists of a torsion bar, bumper and a hydraulic shock absorber on each <b>suspension</b> <b>arm.</b> Disc brakes {{on each of the}} final drives controlled by a transmission retarder provide the braking.|$|E
50|$|Lap 31 saw {{contact between}} Jason Bargwanna and Lee Holdsworth, sending Holdsworth into the tyre barrier. Holdsworth restarted. Not long after Lowndes {{fighting}} for second with Tander brushed a wall, bending a front <b>suspension</b> <b>arm,</b> damaging the cars steering. Lowndes immediately fell away from Tander and back towards Courtney. It took about five laps, but Courtney finally took Lowndes for third.|$|E
50|$|The Ariete's {{independent}} suspension system consists of 14 torsion bars with <b>suspension</b> <b>arms,</b> 10 hydraulic shock absorbers (installed on roadwheels numbers 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7) and 14 friction dampers.|$|R
5000|$|Ultima Pro XL (Similar to the Ultima Pro {{but with}} a single plate chassis. Longer front and rear <b>suspension</b> <b>arms.</b> Adjustable rear toe in and 48 pitch spur and pinion gears.) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Reverse {{modeling}} of vehicle <b>suspension</b> control <b>arm</b> is studied. Firstly, {{the data of}} vehicle <b>suspension</b> control <b>arm</b> is acquired. Secondly, the scanning point cloud data is processed. Then 3 D model of vehicle <b>suspension</b> control <b>arm</b> is reconstructed. Finally, model’s deviation is analyzed {{to find out the}} deficiencies and to improve the accuracy of the model. Reverse modeling based on CATIA can make up the shortage of traditional modeling method and solve the problem of gaining the data of complex curved surface parts. It also can shorten the innovation and improvement cycle of the vehicle <b>suspension</b> control <b>arm</b> and reduce the production cost and enhance enterprise competitiveness...|$|R
5000|$|Suspension {{is made to}} {{accommodate}} fast changing surfaces. The older trucks have coil springs while newer trucks have air springs that are easier to adjust according to each track. A new type of suspension is also being tested {{by at least one}} contestant. It’s similar to your typical motorcycle, where the shock absorber and the <b>suspension</b> <b>arm</b> is built into a single unit.|$|E
5000|$|The German World War II Panther tank (and some Tigers) had double torsion bars. [...] Needing bars {{longer than}} {{the width of the}} tank to get the {{required}} spring rate and maximum elastic bend angle from available steel alloys, designer Ernst Lehr created a suspension that effectively folded the bars in half. For each wheel, one rod was attached to the <b>suspension</b> <b>arm,</b> while another was mounted to a nearby point on the frame. On {{the opposite side of the}} tank, the two rods were attached to each other and fitted into a pivot. Deflection of the <b>suspension</b> <b>arm</b> caused both halves of the double torsion bar to twist. A disadvantage of the torsion bar suspension used in Tiger and Panther tanks was the inability to incorporate an escape hatch through the bottom of the hull, a common feature of WWII-era tanks, as the torsion bar arrangement would have blocked crew access to such a hatch.|$|E
50|$|The most {{advanced}} {{aspect of the}} Challenger 1 design was its Chobham armour, which gave protection far superior to any monolithic Rolled Homogeneous Armour (RHA), then standard of western tank armour material. This armour was later adopted by other designs, including the American M1 Abrams. Additionally, the hydropneumatic suspension provided outstanding cross-country performance through the long <b>suspension</b> <b>arm</b> travel and controlled bump and rebound behaviour offered.|$|E
50|$|The 1/18-scale LaTrax Teton monster {{truck was}} {{released}} in early 2014. Though {{very similar to the}} previously released Rally, featuring a similar drivetrain, waterproof electronics, and radio system, the Teton does have longer <b>suspension</b> <b>arms</b> and shocks.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Zero keel {{design as}} {{employed}} on the BMW Sauber F1.07. Note the lower <b>suspension</b> <b>arms</b> mounted {{directly onto the}} lower edge of the nosecone, and the angle between the arms and road surface necessary for this arrangement.|$|R
50|$|The Honda CB440S was {{a special}} version offered by a Honda {{dealership}} in São Paulo, Brazil in 1983. This was simply a CB400 with a 447 cc engine with some imported parts as lightweight crankcase, larger pistons and new <b>suspension</b> <b>arms.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In the {{original}} Seven, the front lower A-arm (or [...] "wishbone") {{of the double}} wishbone suspension is traditional, but {{for the purpose of}} reducing weight, the upper suspension integrated an anti-roll (anti-sway) bar into a horizontal <b>suspension</b> <b>arm.</b> This approach formed a pseudo-wishbone which was semi-independent in nature. This approach worked well with early crossply tyres, but with later radials, the configuration seriously affected its adjustability.|$|E
50|$|The AC Cobra is {{an example}} of a transverse, multi-leaf steel spring {{suspension}} that uses the leaf spring as the upper <b>suspension</b> <b>arm.</b> Alternatively, the 1963 Corvette's rear suspension {{is an example}} where the transverse leaf spring is used only as a ride spring. In both examples the leaf spring is centrally mounted, preventing displacement of the wheel on one side from affecting the wheel on the other side.|$|E
50|$|Outdoors, a hood is {{positioned}} either manually or via tractor {{with a special}} pre-stressed 4 point <b>suspension</b> <b>arm.</b> Steaming time amounts to 30 min for a penetration down to 25 cm depth. Hereby a temperature of 90 °C can be reached. In large stable glasshouses, the hoods are attached to tracks. They are lifted and moved by pneumatic cylinders. Small and medium-sized hoods up to 12 m² are lifted manually using a tipping lever or moved electrically with special winches.|$|E
50|$|The {{body was}} aerodynamically shaped, with , while still seating four people. The bonnet, rear <b>suspension</b> <b>arms</b> and wheel rims {{were made from}} SMC (Sheet Moulding Compound), the roof was made from resin between steel sheets and the windows were made from {{polycarbonate}} resin.|$|R
50|$|Suspension was {{the major}} cause of concern in this car. The soft rear suspension, while giving a good ride, had a problem of {{bottoming}} out on sharp bumps. The multi-link set up was highly prone for misalignment and changing the <b>suspension</b> <b>arms</b> is still a headache for mechanics.|$|R
50|$|The Telluride 4X4 was {{released}} in mid-2013 as an adventure/trail rig. It {{was based on the}} Stampede 4X4 platform. However, the Telluride features shorter <b>suspension</b> <b>arms,</b> short course-style wheels and tires, and a new Jeep-like body. It uses the Titan 12-turn brushed motor and XL-5 electronic speed control.|$|R
50|$|As {{components}} of an automobile chassis, struts can be passive braces {{to reinforce the}} chassis and/or body, or active {{components of}} the suspension. An automotive suspension strut combines the primary function of a shock absorber (as a damper), {{with the ability to}} support sideways loads not along its axis of compression, somewhat similar to a sliding pillar suspension, thus eliminating the need for an upper <b>suspension</b> <b>arm.</b> This means that a strut must have a more rugged design, with mounting points near its middle for attachment of such loads.|$|E
50|$|At {{the start}} of the race Michael Schumacher started brilliantly and overtook Mika Häkkinen, whilst his brother Ralf Schumacher stalled. It took two {{attempts}} to get the race started as Alexander Wurz precipitated a collision, which somersaulted his Benetton above the gravel trap, into the first turn and involving Jean Alesi and Jarno Trulli as well. This carnage brought out the red flag. The race was stopped and Alesi, Wurz and Trulli all took the restart in their spare cars. Herbert was lucky that his mechanics were able to repair his Sauber, as Alesi took the spare. The only damage to the car proved to be a bent <b>suspension</b> <b>arm.</b>|$|E
50|$|However, {{the front}} {{anti-dive}} geometry which was introduded on the Lotus 31, and the rear anti-squat geometry with unparallel radius arms (that counters the rear camber and toe-in reductions under braking) which was introduced with the 41C, were fully developed on the 41X (which had multiple <b>suspension</b> <b>arm</b> attachment points), and the setup {{found to be}} the best is incorporated into the 59 frame. While the 59 used Triumph Herald front uprights, the 59B used the Formula Two version Lotus 41X uprights and brakes shared with Lotus 47A. Hubs and wheels were knock-off type with spin-on central lock nut, except for the Formula Ford version, which had the Ford production 4 lugnut configuration as per the formula.|$|E
5000|$|Torque steer, {{common in}} a front-wheel drive layout, is mitigated by greater front-wheel toe-out and specially-made lower front <b>suspension</b> <b>arms</b> that provide 1.5 degrees of {{negative}} camber. The 6" [...] x 13" [...] aluminium alloy wheels {{are intended for}} either Goodyear or Dunlop 165:13:60 section, HR-rated low-profile tyres.|$|R
50|$|The Chapman strut {{used the}} driveshafts as <b>suspension</b> <b>arms,</b> thus {{requiring}} only {{the weight of}} one component rather than two. Jaguar's patented independent rear suspension (IRS) similarly reduced unsprung mass by replacing the upper wishbone <b>arms</b> of the <b>suspension</b> with the drive shafts, as well as mounting the brakes inboard in some versions.|$|R
50|$|The Ford D3 {{platform}} differs {{slightly from}} the original configuration of the Volvo P2 architecture, primarily in its adoption of a common 112.9 inch wheelbase (a three-inch wheelbase stretch) for all variants. To reduce production costs, Ford Motor Company adopted steel <b>suspension</b> <b>arms</b> (in place of aluminum) and similar material cost-saving measures.|$|R
50|$|A {{torsion bar}} {{suspension}}, {{also known as}} a torsion spring suspension (not to be confused with a torsion beam rear suspension), is a general term for any vehicle suspension that uses a torsion bar as its main weight-bearing spring. One end of a long metal bar is attached firmly to the vehicle chassis; the opposite end terminates in a lever, the torsion key, mounted perpendicular to the bar, that is attached to a <b>suspension</b> <b>arm,</b> a spindle, or the axle. Vertical motion of the wheel causes the bar to twist around its axis and is resisted by the bar's torsion resistance. The effective spring rate of the bar is determined by its length, cross section, shape, material, and manufacturing process.|$|E
50|$|It {{was based}} on the same {{platform}} chassis as the Citroën 2CV, sharing its advanced independent front to rear interconnected suspension. This comprised a central springing unit, running fore-and-aft in a tube on each side; each <b>suspension</b> <b>arm</b> on that side was linked to the spring, by a tie-rod and a 'knife-edge' pivot-pin. Early cars did not have conventional shock absorbers. See Citroën 2CV for detailed information. The squeak heard from most 2CVs and Dyanes as they go over bumps is due to lack of lubrication either inside the spring tubes or to the 'knife-edges'. The front hubs kingpins need to be greased every 600 miles. Since this is often overlooked, the king-pins can be prone to wear, although some movement is acceptable.|$|E
50|$|In the book, {{the group}} are flown into Germany on board an RAF Avro Lancaster, {{whereas in the}} film they are transported in a Luftwaffe Junkers Ju 52. While in the film, Kramer, Rosemeyer and Von Hapen are {{shot to death by}} Schaffer and Smith, in the novel they are just given high doses of nembutal. In the book Thomas, Carraciola and Christiansen attempt to escape in the cable car with Smith on the roof. Carraciola is crushed by the steel <b>suspension</b> <b>arm</b> of the cable car while {{struggling}} with Smith on the roof; Thomas and Christiansen fall to their deaths after Smith blows the cable car up with plastic explosive. In the film, only Thomas and Christiansen are killed by Smith, as one of the three had been previously killed by Germans.|$|E
5000|$|The Exeo also {{features}} the same multi link fully independent {{front and rear}} suspension as used on the Audi A4, again with light weight cast aluminium alloy front <b>suspension</b> <b>arms</b> and virtual steering axis uprights. [...] All models are equipped with ZF-supplied power steering, with some models having speed-sensitive 'servotronic' variable assistance.|$|R
5000|$|The single-axle bogies on the Turbotrain {{were very}} {{mechanically}} complex and the <b>suspension</b> <b>arms</b> were [...] "telescopic arms {{which were in}} essence ball-bearing screw actuators; the suspension of the inside-bearing powered bogies was [...] "especially complex" [...] and attached to the turbines via [...] "an intricate web of mechanical couplings and shafts".|$|R
50|$|Good {{preparation}} {{is key to}} winning as opposed to accessibility to prototype arts as Associated learned in 1993; when they felt their standard issue, aluminium chassis RC10 was best suited to the circuit, mechanics proceeded to modify Brian Kinwald’s chassis by rounding it’s square edges. It’s <b>suspension</b> <b>arms</b> was molded from a more rigid graphite.|$|R
