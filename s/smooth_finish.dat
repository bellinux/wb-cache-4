5|$|The Maya {{had a long}} {{tradition}} of mural painting; rich polychrome murals have been excavated at San Bartolo, dating to between 300 and 200 BC. Walls were coated with plaster, and polychrome designs were painted onto the <b>smooth</b> <b>finish.</b> The majority of such murals have not survived, but Early Classic tombs painted in cream, red, and black have been excavated at Caracol, RÃ­o Azul, and Tikal. Among the best preserved murals are a full-size series of Late Classic paintings at Bonampak.|$|E
5|$|However, the peels will degrade {{over time}} if they contain any iron sulfide (pyrite or marcasite). Shya Chitaley {{addressed}} {{this problem by}} revising the liquid-peel technique to separate the organic material preserved by the coal ball from the inorganic minerals, including iron sulfide. This allows the peel to retain its quality for a longer time. Chitaley's revisions begin after grinding {{the surface of the}} coal ball to a <b>smooth</b> <b>finish.</b> Her process essentially entails heating and then making multiple applications of solutions of paraffin in xylene to the coal ball. Each subsequent application has a greater concentration of paraffin in xylene to allow the wax to completely pervade the coal ball. Nitric acid, and then acetone, are applied to the coal ball. Following that, the process merges back into the liquid peel technique.|$|E

40|$|Vibratory Finishing is a {{commonly}} used process for deburring and polishing. The process effectiveness {{is difficult to}} quantify due to a nexus of variables relating to workpiece, media, compound and machine. In this paper, effect of orientation of rectangular Al 6061 workpieces is considered {{with respect to the}} motion of ceramic media using water as lubricant. It is found that parallel orientation of workpiece to media motion and higher lubrication level lead to higher degree of sliding, thereby leading to <b>smoother</b> <b>finish.</b> Experiments with different ceramic media showed <b>smoother</b> <b>finish</b> with the geometry more susceptible to rounding. The aforesaid findings can be employed in applications requiring superpolished surfaces...|$|R

25|$|Mirrors are {{manufactured}} by applying a reflective coating to a suitable substrate. The most common substrate is glass, {{due to its}} transparency, ease of fabrication, rigidity, hardness, and ability to take a <b>smooth</b> <b>finish.</b> The reflective coating is typically applied to the back surface of the glass, so that the reflecting side of the coating is protected from corrosion and accidental damage by the glass {{on one side and}} the coating itself and optional paint for further protection on the other.|$|E

Testing was discontinued after four engine changes were required {{during the course of}} the tests, culminating in two single-engine landings. These aircraft were extensively studied, aiding development of early US, British and Soviet jet fighters. The F-86, designed by engineer Edgar Schmued, used a slat design based on the Me 262's.|$|E

25|$|Pottery {{produced}} by the Caddoan Mississippian culture {{is some of the}} finest known in North America. It is usually found in the areas of Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas and Oklahoma. About 1200 CE as the Caddoan culture emerged from local woodland cultures such as Fourche Maline, a distinctive pottery tradition emerged, unmistakable because of its designs, materials and fine execution. These early pots were often grog tempered, although sometimes finely ground bone was used. Two main forms emerged that would become Caddoan pottery standards for the next 1000 years, a long slender necked bottle and a carinated form of bottles and bowls. Caddo pottery is considered to be some of the finest Mississippian pottery because of its thinness, symmetry, and very <b>smooth</b> <b>finish,</b> with some of its best examples being bottle forms with extensive geometric engravings. Pieces are often dark brown and black with a glossy finish achieved by the application of a fine slip made from a mixture of sifted fine clay or paint and buffed to a high finish. The first Europeans to encounter Caddoan pottery were members of the Hernando de Soto Expedition in 1541, who described it as matching even the finest potters of their European homeland.|$|E
500|$|On July 19, Roberts sent {{a similar}} pair of coins to Secretary of the Treasury George Cortelyou, noting that Saint-Gaudens's {{use of a}} <b>smooth</b> <b>finish</b> to the design, rather than the sharp die work {{characteristic}} of the Liberty gold pieces, might encourage counterfeiting. [...] Roberts communicated these concerns to Saint-Gaudens, who requested casts of the dies used to strike the new pieces, which were sent to his house in Cornish, New Hampshire on July 28. [...] Saint-Gaudens died there of cancer on August 3, 1907, and Roosevelt wrote to his widow Augusta, [...] "I count {{it as one of}} the privileges of my administration to have had him make two of our coins".|$|E
500|$|The {{thin section}} {{technique}} was superseded by the now-common liquid-peel technique in 1928. In this technique, peels are obtained by cutting {{the surface of}} a coal ball with a diamond saw, grinding the cut surface on a glass plate with silicon carbide to a <b>smooth</b> <b>finish,</b> and etching the cut and the surface with hydrochloric acid. The acid dissolves the mineral matter from the coal ball, leaving a projecting layer of plant cells. After applying acetone, a piece of cellulose acetate is placed on the coal ball. This embeds the cells preserved in the coal ball into the cellulose acetate. Upon drying, the cellulose acetate can be removed from the coal ball with a razor and the obtained peel can be stained with a low-acidity stain and observed under a microscope. Up to 50peels can be extracted from [...] of coal ball with this method.|$|E

500|$|Emeco's {{chairs are}} {{manufactured}} by hand in Hanover, Pennsylvania through a two-week, 77-step process. Eames Demetrios, {{the grandson of}} designer Charles Eames, published a documentary film on the manufacturing process called [...] "77 Steps." [...] Many believe the chair is cast from a single form, but it is actually welded together from 12 pieces. Sheets of aluminum are rolled into tubes, cut to length, and bent into shapes on large hydraulic machines. Various notches and punchouts are made so pieces can fit together before welding. Workers grind down the welding joints {{to give it a}} <b>smooth</b> <b>finish,</b> creating the appearance of being cast from a single piece. The chair goes through a repeated heating and cooling cycle that increases the strength of the aluminum. The chairs are also anodized. Originally swivel chair bases and other parts were purchased from a supplier, but in the 1950s, Emeco began purchasing manufacturing equipment to manufacture them in-house.|$|E
500|$|The last scene filmed was the film's first, Picard's Borg nightmare. One {{camera shot}} begins inside the iris of Picard's eyeball and pulls {{back to reveal}} the captain aboard a massive Borg ship. The shot {{continues}} to pull back and reveal the exterior of a Borg ship. The scene {{was inspired by a}} New York City production of Sweeney Todd, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street in which the stage surrounded the audience, giving a sense of realism. The shot was filmed as three separate elements merged with digital effects. The crew used a 50-mm lens {{to make it easier for}} the effects team to dissolve the closeup shots with the other elements. Starting from Stewart's eye, the camera pulled back , requiring the key light to increase in intensity up to 1000footcandles so that there was enough depth to keep the eye sharp. The surface of the stage proved too uneven to accomplish the smooth dolly pullback required by the effects team, who needed a steady shot to blend a computer-generated version of Picard's eye with the pullback. The [...] dolly track was raised off the stage floor and layered with pieces of double-thick birch plywood, chosen for its <b>smooth</b> <b>finish.</b> The entire set for the scene was [...] wide and [...] high; gaps left by the dolly reveal were filled in later digitally. Principal photography finished on July 2, 1996, two days over schedule but still under budget.|$|E

2500|$|Rendered stucco faÃ§ades [...] "are a {{defining}} characteristic of Brighton and Hove's historic core". Stucco gave the appearance of stone, left a <b>smooth</b> <b>finish</b> and could be worked into intricate patterns on mouldings, capitals, architraves and other embellishments. [...] It was used prominently on long, continuous terraces of houses, {{such as in the}} Brunswick and Kemp Town estates. [...] Rustication was sometimes used, especially at ground-floor level. Typical decorative mouldings include standard features of Classical architecture such as columns of various orders, pilasters, parapets, cornices and capitals. Stucco faÃ§ades were not always well-regarded: writing in 1940, Louis Francis Salzman considered that stucco [...] "hides what architectural features [...] may possess and produces dull uniformity, entirely lacking in character".|$|E
2500|$|Other {{materials}} used for masks include wax, fired clay, leather, cloth, wire mesh, sheet metal, rubber tires, cardboard and paper mache. Masks of wax {{are made in}} the Mexico City area, which perfectly fit the wearers face for a very realistic appearance. Other areas to use wax in this way include Villa de Zaachila, San Bartolo Coyotepec and Zapotec communities near the city of Oaxaca [...] These masks are made by molding the wax to the wearerâs own face. Tools used by wood mask makers include machetes, knives and blades, often fashioned by the craftsman himself. Other tools can include chisels, pliers and more with sandpaper or pumice stone for smoothing. Sometimes the masks are covered in plaster to achieve a <b>smooth</b> <b>finish.</b> Lacquer is used on masks in locations in MichoacÃ¡n and Guerrero, where the technique is applied to a number of other items as well.|$|E
2500|$|The {{common walnut}} {{and the black}} walnut and its allies, are {{important}} for their attractive timber, which is hard, dense, tight-grained and polishes to a very <b>smooth</b> <b>finish.</b> The colour ranges from creamy white in the sapwood to a dark chocolate colour in the heartwood. When kiln-dried, walnut wood tends toward a dull brown colour, but when air-dried can become a rich purplish-brown. Because of its colour, hardness and grain, it is a prized furniture and carving wood. Walnut burls (or [...] "burrs" [...] in Europe) are commonly used to create bowls and other turned pieces. Veneer sliced from walnut burl {{is one of the}} most valuable and highly prized by cabinet makers and prestige car manufacturers. Walnut wood has been the timber of choice for gun makers for centuries, including the Gewehr 98 and LeeâEnfield rifles of the First World War. It remains one of the most popular choices for rifle and shotgun stocks, and is generally considered to be the premium â as well as the most traditional â wood for gun stocks, due to its resilience to compression along the grain. Walnut is also used in lutherie and for the body of pipe organs. The wood of the butternut and related Asian species is of much lower value, softer, coarser, less strong and heavy, and paler in colour.|$|E
