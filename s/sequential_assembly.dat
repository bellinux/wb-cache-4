40|$|Nearly {{monodisperse}} colloidal superstructures of cadmium chalcogenide {{quantum dots}} (QDs) are reported. The superstructures, which we named as supra quantum dot (SQD), are typically composed {{of hundreds of}} a-few-nanometer-sized QDs three-dimensionally (3 D) assembled by oriented attachment. The synthesis route for SQD is quite universal and can be extended to CdS, CdSe, CdTe, and CdSeTe alloy. The size of SQD can be tuned from tens of nanometers to over a hundred nanometers. In the case of CdSe SQD, zinc-blende seeds (primary QDs) act as the building block {{for the formation of}} the 3 D assembled structures, SQDs, with discrete intermediates nanostructures. Primary seeds, 4 nm tetrahedral shaped QDs, assembled into a large tetrahedron of 20 nm. The 20 nm tetrahedrons, in turn, self-assembled into a larger tetrahedron of 40 nm. The discrete-in-size and <b>sequential</b> <b>assemblies</b> were followed by conventional growth from the remaining precursors and ripening within the particles to result in spheroidal SQDs. SQDs allow surface ligand exchange without losing the structural integrity. Size selective precipitation of SQDs can provide monodisperse SQDs that can assemble into ordered superlattices. The size and composition tunability of SQDs and their capability to form superlattices can provide a new solution-processable building block for superstructure with programmable physical and chemical properties...|$|R

40|$|Nucleotide {{excision}} repair (NER) requires the concerted action {{of many different}} proteins that assemble at sites of damaged DNA in a sequential fashion. We have constructed a mathematical model delineating hallmarks and general characteristics for NER. We measured the assembly kinetics of the putative damage-recognition factor XPC-HR 23 B at sites of DNA damage in the nuclei of living cells. These and other in vivo kinetic data allowed us to scrutinize the dynamic behavior of the nucleotide {{excision repair}} process in detail. A <b>sequential</b> <b>assembly</b> mechanism appears remarkably advantageous in terms of repair efficiency.

40|$|Introduction The broad aim of {{this chapter}} {{is to create an}} {{awareness}} that self assembling, "artificial embryological" type systems need to be studied, so that future molecular scale technologies (Drexler, 1992) will be able to build machines which have too many components for <b>sequential</b> mechanical <b>assembly.</b> With this broader aim in mind, a more concrete aim is to introduce the concept of embryological differentiation into Genetic Algorithms. Traditionally, GAs have contained such ideas as reproductive fitness, crossover, mutation, etc, but nothing equivalent to the way genes switch on and off in natural embryogenesis. The ideas of differentiation are used in this chapter to pursue a third aim, namely to try to grow nonconvex artificial shapes of colonies of cells in reproductive cellular automata. Earlier publications aimed at creating an "Artificial Embryology" resulted in the growth of successful convex shapes but nonconvex shapes failed to evolve (e. g. de Garis, 1992 b). Th...|$|R

Using microbial communities comprising bacterivorous ciliated protists assembled in laboratory microcosms, we experimentally investigated these questions by independently manipulating the intensity of disturbance (in the form of density-independent mortality) and community assembly history (including a control treatment with simultaneous species introduction and five <b>sequential</b> <b>assembly</b> treatments). Species diversity patterns consistent with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis emerged in the controls, as several species showed responses indicative of a trade-off between competitive ability and ability to recover from disturbance. Species diversity in communities with <b>sequential</b> <b>assembly,</b> however, generally declined with disturbance, owing to the increased extinction risk of later colonizers at the intermediate level of disturbance. Similarities among communities subjected to different assembly histories increased with disturbance, a result due possibly to increasing disturbance reducing the importance of competition and hence priority effects. This finding is most consistent with the idea that increasing disturbance tends to reduce the likelihood of alternative stable states. Collectively, these results indicate the strong interactive effects of disturbance and assembly history on the structure of ecological communities...|$|E

40|$|Slowly varying {{activity}} in the striatum, the main Basal Ganglia input structure, {{is important for the}} learning and execution of movement sequences. Striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) form cell assemblies whose population firing rates vary coherently on slow behaviourally relevant timescales. It has been shown that such activity emerges in a model of a local MSN network but only at realistic connectivities of 10 * 20 % and only when MSN generated inhibitory post-synaptic potentials (IPSPs) are realistically sized. Here we suggest a reason for this. We investigate how MSN network generated population {{activity in}}teracts with temporally varying cortical driving activity, as would occur in a behavioural task. We find that at unrealistically high connectivity a stable winners-take-all type regime is found where network activity separates into fixed stimulus dependent regularly firing and quiescent components. In this regime {{only a small number of}} population firing rate components interact with cortical stimulus variations. Around 15 % connectivity a transition to a more dynamically active regime occurs where all cells constantly switch between activity and quiescence. In this low connectivity regime, MSN population components wander randomly and here too are independent of variations in cortical driving. Only in the transition regime do weak changes in cortical driving interact with many population components so that <b>sequential</b> cell <b>assemblies</b> are reproducibly activated for many hundreds of milliseconds after stimulus onset and peri-stimulus time histograms display strong stimulus and temporal specificity.
