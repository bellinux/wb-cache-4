The two FBGs are fixed on each sensor rod at distances of 50 cm and 100 cm {{from the top of the}} rod (an upper FBG and a lower FBG). In the experiment presented in this paper, the sensors are installed on a slope on which an artificial landslide is generated through both machine-based and manual excavation. The fiber sensing system consists of the four custom FBG-based sensors, optical fiber, a static fiber grating demodulation instrument (SM 125), and a PC with the necessary <b>software.</b> <b>Experimental</b> <b>data</b> was collected in the presence of an artificial landslide, and the results show that the lower FBGs are more sensitive than the upper FBGs for all four of the custom sensors.

The stronger rods used in the hard sensors make them more adaptable to the harsh environments of large landslides. Thus, hard sensors should be fixed near the landslide, while soft sensors should be placed farther away from the landslide.

40|$|Graduation date: 2008 Sulfur {{content in}} fuels is an {{increasingly}} critical environmental issue. Hydrodesulfurization removes sulfur from hydrocarbons; however, further desulfurization {{is necessary in}} fuels. New methods are required. In this study, micro-scaled single phase oxidative desulfurization is explored. An ultraviolet light-assisted micro-reactor is introduced for desulfurization of dibenzothiophene. Dibenzothiophene is mixed with decane and oxidant, tert-butyl hydro peroxide. The mixture forms a thin layer inside the micro-reactor which has a rectangular window to facilitate ultraviolet light irradiation. Thin spacers, 100 μm and 50 μm, establish fluid thickness within the micro-channel. Ultraviolet light reacts with oxidant to create hydroxyl radicals and convert dibenzothiophene to sulfoxides and sulfones. These products are easily extracted. The overall desulfurization process is a pseudo first-order reaction. Experiments using the 100 micron spacer are conducted at steady state conditions and three temperatures; 22 oC, 40 oC, and 60 oC. For the 50 micron spacer, temperature conditions were 22 oC and 40 oC. Micro-reactor residence times range from 2 to 30 seconds. The desulfurization study includes a comparison between theoretical model and experimental results, significance of spacer thickness, significance of temperature, and comparison between outcomes of this study to those obtained from other researchers. A mathematical model of the micro-reaction system is developed to predict dibenzothiophene conversion. The model includes convection, diffusion, and pseudo first order reaction kinetics {{in the presence of}} ultraviolet light. The model is solved numerically using COMSOL <b>software.</b> <b>Experimental</b> <b>data</b> is fitted to the model equations to determine the pseudo first order reaction rate constant. The dibenzothiophene reaction rate constants are 7. 76 * 10 - 4 s- 1 and 1. 47 * 10 - 3 s- 1 at temperatures of 22 oC and 40 oC, respectively. The mathematical model fit the experimental data well and therefore, may be used to predict concentrations within the micro-reactor for various operating conditions. Overall, desulfurization of dibenzothiophene using tert-butyl hydro peroxide and ultraviolet light-assisted micro-reactor was more efficient compared to other processes.

40|$|Most of the {{non-point source}} {{nitrogen}} (N) load {{in rural areas}} is attributed to onsite wastewater treatment systems (OWTS). Nitrogen compounds cause eutrophication, depleting the oxygen in marine ecosystems. OWTS rely on physical, chemical and biological soil processes to treat wastewater and these processes may be affected by climate change. We simulated the fate and transport of N in different types of OWTS drainfields, or soil treatment areas (STA) under current and changing climate scenarios, using 2 D/ 3 D HYDRUS <b>software.</b> <b>Experimental</b> <b>data</b> from a mesocosm-scale study, including soil moisture content, and total N, ammonium (NH 4 +) and nitrate (NO 3 -) concentrations, were used to calibrate the model. A water content-dependent function was used to compute the nitrification and denitrification rates. Three types of drainfields were simulated: (1) a pipe-and-stone (P&S), (2) advanced soil drainfields, pressurized shallow narrow drainfield (PSND) and (3) Geomat (GEO), a variation of SND. The model was calibrated with acceptable goodness-of-fit between the observed and measured values. Average {{root mean square error}} (RSME) ranged from 0. 18 and 2. 88 mg L- 1 for NH 4 + and 4. 45 mg L- 1 to 9. 65 mg L- 1 for NO 3 - in all drainfield types. The calibrated model was used to estimate N fluxes for both conventional and advanced STAs under current and changing climate conditions, i. e. increased soil temperature and higher water table. The model computed N losses from nitrification and denitrification differed little from measured losses in all STAs. The modeled N losses occurred mostly as NO 3 - in water outputs, accounting for more than 82 % of N inputs in all drainfields. Losses as N 2 were estimated to be 10. 4 % and 9. 7 % of total N input concentration for SND and Geo, respectively. The highest N 2 losses, 17. 6 %, were estimated for P&S. Losses as N 2 increased to 22 %, 37 % and 21 % under changing climate conditions for Geo, PSND and P&S, respectively. These findings can provide practitioners with guidelines to estimate N removal efficiencies for traditional and advanced OWTS, and predict N loads and spatial distribution for identifying non-point sources. Our results show that N losses on OWTS can be modeled successfully using HYDRUS. Furthermore, the results suggest that climate change may increase the removal of N as N 2 in the drainfield, with the magnitude of the effect depending on a drainfield type...|$|E

Classical approaches deter-mine the deflection of sandwich structures by a superposition method where the local compres-sion of the core for a panel on a rigid foundation is added to global sandwich bending without core compression. In this article, a sandwich plate is analyzed using a higher-order sandwich panel theory (HOSPT) where the faces are modelled by classical laminate theory and the core by a three-dimensional elasticity solution. The results are obtained from 14 partial differential equa-tions for displacements of the faces and core. HOSPT determines core compression with a second-order distribution of displacement through the core thickness. The force versus core compression relations in the fully backed and clamped states are compared and it is shown that the core compression assumed in the classical approach differs from the core compression in a clamped state.

Two primary contributions are made in this work. i) Identification of key characteristics of an onboard system allows for a high level validation of the hardware of an onboard system along with a design template for a reconfigurable, platform independent, processing system for UVs. ii) Detailed design and implementation of an adaptable onboard processing system that is both computationally powerful and easily adapted. This system is validated by showing satisfiability of the design characteristics necessary for an adaptable onboard system along with fully operational field test and their corresponding results...|$|R
40|$|Simulations {{are often}} used to model polymer flow during {{injection}} molding to design molds and select processing parameters. It {{is difficult to determine}} the accuracy of these simulations {{due to a lack of}} experimentally measured in‐mold velocimetry and melt‐front progression data. This article compares the results from commercial mold‐filling simulation <b>software</b> to <b>experimental</b> <b>data</b> obtained via particle image velocimetry (PIV) in a special optical‐access mold with a rectangular cavity. Moldflow was used to simulate the mold filling by a polystyrene melt in the experimental configuration, and these simulated results are compared to the appropriately averaged time‐varying velocity field measurements. Simulated results for melt‐front progression are also compared with experimentally observed flow fronts. The ratio of the experimentally measured average velocity magnitudes to the simulation magnitudes was found on average to be 0. 99 with a standard deviation of 0. 25, and the difference in velocity orientations was found to be 0. 9 ° with a standard deviation of 3. 2 °. The corner area opposite the gate was most problematic for the simulation. The region behind the front also had a relatively high simulation error, though not as severe as that in the corner. POLYM.
