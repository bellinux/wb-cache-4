A North-South {{model of}} international trade is introduced in which the number of countries in each region can be varied. As the number of countries in one region is increased, each government there competes more aggressively with the others in its region, by lowering its tariff, to attract imports from the other region. In doing so, all countries in a region exert a negative terms-of-trade externality on each other, collectively undermining their own terms of trade and welfare. This externality can increase efficiency if the numbers of countries in both regions are increased simultaneously.

The {{determination of the}} parameters in such regimes is challenging for national regulatory authorities (NRA), since there is normally a single TSO operating in each jurisdiction. The solution for European regulators {{has been found in}} international regulatory benchmarking, organized in collaboration with the Council of European Energy Regulators (CEER) in 2008 and 2012 for 22 and 23 TSOs, respectively.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{seeks to}} uncover {{and examine the}} complex set of {{governance}} challenges associated with transforming energy distribution networks, which play a key enabling role in a low carbon energy transition. We argue that, although the importance of such infrastructure networks to sustainability and low carbon transitions in the energy, water and mobility sectors is clear, there is relatively little understanding {{of the social and}} institutional dimension of these systems and appropriate governance strategies for their transformation. This may be because the prevalent model of infrastructure governance in the energy and other sectors has prioritised short term time horizons and <b>static</b> <b>efficiencies.</b> In this paper we draw on the social shaping of technology literature to develop a broader understanding of infrastructure change as a dynamic socio-technical process. The empirical focus of the paper is on the development of more flexible and sustainable energy distribution systems as key enablers for the UK's low carbon transition. Focusing on electricity and heat networks we identify a range of governance challenges along different phases of the ‘infrastructure lifecycle’, and we draw lessons for the development of governance frameworks for the transformation of energy infrastructure more generally...|$|R

Under service-based competition (SBC), the entrant can reduce its setup costs by leasing network facilities from the incumbent, which makes the entrant viable, pushes the market price down and promotes <b>static</b> <b>efficiency.</b> This paper attempts to measure <b>static</b> <b>efficiency</b> by comparing the profits of the incumbent and entrant in terms of consumer surplus and social welfare under each competition type by extending the Stackelberg model. The results, assuming a linear demand function and variation in regulatory level, show that FBC results in higher social welfare than SBC on the whole. However, SBC accompanied by strong regulation is also shown to have the potential to be superior over FBC. It is also revealed that FBC exhibits a higher producer surplus (particularly, the incumbent’s producer surplus) and is, therefore, more desirable in terms of dynamic efficiency. When the entrant’s cost is high in FBC, social welfare is shown to be lowered, implying that cost competitiveness is a necessary condition for social welfare...|$|E

40|$|The {{operating}} principle of condensing boilers {{is based on}} exploiting heat from flue gases to pre-heat cold water at the inlet of the boiler: by condensing into liquid form, flue gases recover their latent heat of vaporization, leading to 10 – 12 % increased efficiency with respect to traditional boilers. However, monitoring the energy efficiency of condensing boilers is complex due to their nonlinear dynamics: currently, (<b>static)</b> nonlinear <b>efficiency</b> curves of condensing boilers are calculated at quasi-stationary regime and ‘a posteriori’, i. e. from data collected during chamber tests: therefore, with this static approach, {{it is possible to}} monitor the energy efficiency only at steady-state regime. In this work we propose a novel model-based monitoring approach for condensing boilers that extends the operating regime for which monitoring is possible: the approach is based on a hybrid dynamic model of the condensing boiler, where state-dependent switching accounts for dynamically changing condensing/non condensing proportions. Monitoring the energy efficiency over the boiler's complete dynamic regime is possible via switching estimators designed for the different condensing/non condensing modes. By using real-world boiler efficiency data we show that the proposed approach results in a (dynamic) nonlinear efficiency curve which gives a more complete description of the condensing boilers operation than <b>static</b> nonlinear <b>efficiency</b> curves: in addition, the dynamic curve can be derived ‘a priori’, i. e. from first principles, or from data collected during normal boiler operation (without requiring special chamber tests) ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} how deregulation affects product market competition and thereby productivity.

It obliges firms to renounce high rents and cut costs, which increases <b>static</b> <b>efficiency.</b> However, <b>static</b> <b>efficiency</b> boosts productivity only temporarily. Long-term gains are derived from dynamic efficiency, which competition promotes in two ways. First, it increases incentives to innovate, and secondly, it accelerates creative destruction. Since regulations impede the free entry of rivals, they ensure firms a quiet life. Deregulation has therefore great potential to boost productivity growth. This study describes the process of regulatory reform in Finland. In addition to a country-level analysis, deregulation and its consequences are examined in service station and restaurant industries, which have experienced extensive reforms. The purpose was to see whether deregulation has induced external restructuring in these sectors.

MethodsWe used detailed data on the Hungarian prescription drug market, which had been made publicly available by the authorities. We evaluated the effect of the Pharma Economic Act on both dynamic and <b>static</b> <b>efficiencies</b> and also on equity, which has been historically a controversial issue in Hungary. We analyzed the overall prescription drug market and statin and atorvastatin markets; as a proxy for determining dynamic efficiency, {{we examined}} the oncology drug market for some specific products (e. g., bortezomib) and the long-acting atypical antipsychotic drugs market. ResultsThere is no denying that the authorities managed to control the overall prescription drug costs; however, they were still paying excessive rents for off-patent drugs. Examples of oncology and long-acting atypical antipsychotic drugs showed that the diffusion of innovation was on per-capita basis at least comparable to G- 5 countries. While the share of out-of-pocket co-payments markedly increased and the reimbursement was lowered, the concurrent price decreases often meant that the co-payment per milligram of a given dispensed drug was actually lower than that before the Act, thereby benefiting the patient. ConclusionsIt appears that strong mechanisms to control volume rather than price on the supply side (marketing authorization holders) contained the drug expenditure, while offering enough room to strive for innovation. Making data on prescription drug expenditures and associated co-payments publicly available is an item that should be definitely followed by the surrounding jurisdictions...|$|R
