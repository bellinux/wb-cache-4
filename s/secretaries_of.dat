5|$|Truman {{surrounded}} {{himself with}} his old friends, and appointed several to high positions that seemed well beyond their competence, including his two <b>secretaries</b> <b>of</b> the treasury, Fred Vinson and John Snyder. His closest friend in the White House was his military aide Harry H. Vaughan, who seemed to others like a huge joke.|$|E
5|$|Khrushchev {{assisted}} in the purge of many friends and colleagues in Moscow oblast. Of 38top Party officials in Moscow city and province, 35 were killed—the three survivors were transferred {{to other parts of}} the USSR. Of the 146Party <b>secretaries</b> <b>of</b> cities and districts outside Moscow city in the province, only 10 survived the purges. In his memoirs, Khrushchev noted that almost everyone who worked with him was arrested. By Party protocol, Khrushchev was required to approve these arrests, and did little or nothing to save his friends and colleagues.|$|E
5|$|All Assay Commission medals are {{extremely}} rare. Except for the 1977 medal, none {{is believed to}} have been issued in a quantity of greater than 200, and in most years fewer than 50 were struck. Additional copies of several 19th-century issues are known to have been illicitly struck; the Mint ended such practices in the early 20th century. The obverse of the 1909 issue, depicting Treasury Secretary George Cortelyou, was reused as Cortelyou's entry in the Mint's series of medals honoring <b>Secretaries</b> <b>of</b> the Treasury. The later pieces were struck with a blank reverse, but in the early 1960s, the reverse design from the Assay Commission issue was used with the Cortelyou obverse, and an unknown number sold to the public. The restrikes are said to be less distinctly struck than the originals.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} British law {{relating}} to marriage {{was based on}} the legal doctrine of coverture, in which a woman's legal rights and obligations were subsumed by those of her husband upon their matrimony. By law a woman had no separate legal existence, and all her property became her husband's; divorce initiated by a woman was difficult and complicated. In April 1868 Josephine and fellow suffragist Elizabeth Wolstenholme set up and became joint <b>secretaries</b> <b>of</b> the Married Women's Property Committee to pressure parliament into changing the law. Josephine remained on the committee until the campaign was successful, with the passing into law of the Married Women's Property Act 1882.|$|E
5|$|Implementing the {{provisions}} and mandates of the Nunn-Cohen Act, however, was neither rapid nor smooth. One {{of the first}} issues to surface was appointing an ASD (SO/LIC), whose principal duties included monitorship of special operations activities and low-intensity conflict activities of the Department of Defense. The Congress even {{increased the number of}} assistant <b>secretaries</b> <b>of</b> defense from 11 to 12, but the Department of Defense still did not fill this new billet. In December 1987, the Congress directed Secretary of the Army John O. Marsh to carry out the ASD (SO/LIC) duties until a suitable replacement was approved by the Senate. Not until 18 months after the legislation passed did Ambassador Charles Whitehouse assume the duties of ASD (SO/LIC).|$|E
5|$|Khánh {{selected}} a cabinet of thirteen ministers and two <b>Secretaries</b> <b>of</b> State at ministerial level, and chose new provincial and district chiefs. He originally tried to include {{members of a}} variety of political and religious groups including representatives of the Cao Đài and Hòa Hảo sects, who still had remnants of their private armies intact after their defeat by Diệm in 1955. Although Khánh insisted that he had no party affiliation, the orientation of his government was toward the Đại Việt, who held many of the key posts in the government. This provoked bitterness from other anti-communist nationalists and groups that were banned under Diệm and were seeking a greater role in public life, as well as from a younger generation who felt that the established nationalist parties were responsible for dividing the people.|$|E
50|$|In 1947, {{with the}} passing of the National Security Act <b>of</b> 1947, the <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> War was {{replaced}} by the <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> the Army and the <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> the Air Force, which, along with the <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> the Navy, have since 1949 been non-Cabinet subordinates under the <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> Defense. The <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> the Army's office is generally considered the direct successor to the <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> War's office although the <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> Defense took the <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> War's position in the Cabinet, and the line of succession to the presidency.|$|R

5|$|The Department of Treasury has had {{the most}} {{foreign-born}} Secretaries, with five. Department of Labor and Interior follow with three, and the departments of Housing and Urban Development and State have each had two. Former <b>Secretaries</b> <b>of</b> State Henry Kissinger and Madeleine Albright were the highest-ranking foreign-born Cabinet members ever in accordance to the United States presidential line of succession. The majority of foreign-born Cabinet members were born in Europe. Most European-born Cabinet members originated from the United Kingdom and Germany with five and four respectively, {{and the others were}} born in Ireland, Czechoslovakia, Switzerland and Italy. Four Cabinet members were born in the Americas, and one was born in Asia. The departments of Defense, Justice, Health and Human Services, Energy, Education, Veterans Affairs and Homeland Security have not had foreign-born Secretaries.|$|E

Under {{the government of the}} Byelorussian SSR, the de facto leader of the Soviet Republic was the first <b>secretaries</b> <b>of</b> the Communist Party of Byelorussia, the only legal party in Soviet Belarus. From independence until passage of the Constitution in 1994, the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet was the head of state and the Prime Minister as the head of government. When {{the office of the presidency}} was created, the role of the prime minister was reduced to assisting the president and resulted in the dissolution of the Supreme Soviet, along with its Chairman, in 1996.|$|E
5|$|Croatia and Hungary {{have agreed}} to the Cultural Cooperation Programme, which defines {{cooperation}} and cultural exchange {{in the fields of}} music, theatre and dance, and with respect to the arts, museums, galleries, literature, publishing, libraries, archives, film and cultural-heritage protection.

5|$|These {{and several}} other accusations brought public and {{political}} pressure to the investigating agencies. This led to internal revisions of evidence and procedures from the first investigations both at the local and federal level, though all organizations still adamantly denied any cover-up. These second investigations led to reassignments, demotions and resignations among top officials within the PR Justice Department, including three different P.R. <b>Secretaries</b> <b>of</b> Justice (equivalent to State Attorney General) accepting and resigning their posts in a span of six months. On November 29, 1983, three prosecutors were relieved of their duties after {{a report by the}} state Senate Investigations Committee found they had failed to properly investigate the Cerro Maravilla shootings, citing 101 specific deficiencies in two investigations. This was the third state Attorney General to oversee the investigations since the shootings occurred in 1978.|$|E
5|$|To {{generate}} {{support for}} the scheme, the provisional committee initiated a public campaign led by Joseph Lawrence, {{who had worked for}} the Hull and Barnsley Railway.

The first meeting was held on 4 October in Manchester's Oxford Ward, followed by another on 17October in the St. James Ward. Within a few weeks meetings had been held throughout Manchester and Salford, culminating in a conference on 3 November attended by the provisional committee and members of the various Ward Committees.
