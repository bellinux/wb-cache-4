25|$|In the 1920s {{anthropologist}} Vilhjalmur Stefansson {{lived with}} and studied {{a group of}} Inuit. The study focused {{on the fact that}} the Inuit's low-carbohydrate diet had no adverse effects on their health, nor indeed, Stefansson's own health. Stefansson (1946) also observed that the Inuit were able to get the necessary vitamins they needed from their traditional winter diet, which did not contain any plant matter. In particular, he found that adequate vitamin C could be obtained from items in their traditional diet of raw meat such as ringed seal liver and whale skin (muktuk). While there was considerable skepticism when he reported these findings, they have been borne out in recent <b>studies</b> <b>and</b> <b>analyses.</b>|$|E
25|$|Subrahmanyam {{was born}} on 19 January 1929 {{and grew up in}} Tiruchirapalli and Madras. Enrolling at Presidency College, he {{received}} an MSc in Chemistry from the University of Madras in 1950 and after standing first in India in the Civil Services Examination that year, was appointed to the Indian Administrative Service in 1951. After service in the Tamil Nadu cadre and in the Defence Ministry, he was appointed a Rockefeller Fellow in Strategic Studies at the London School of Economics in 1966. On returning to India, he was appointed Director of the newly created Institute for Defence <b>Studies</b> <b>and</b> <b>Analyses</b> (IDSA) in New Delhi, a position he held until 1975. He then went on to a number of senior positions in the Government of Tamil Nadu and the Government of India including Chairman of India's Joint Intelligence Committee in New Delhi; Fourth Member, Board of Revenue, Government of Tamil Nadu; Home Secretary, Government of Tamil Nadu; Additional Secretary, Cabinet Secretariat, New Delhi and Union Secretary for Defence Production in the Ministry of Defence – before returning as Director of IDSA in 1980. He returned to England as a Visiting Professor and Nehru Fellow at St John's College, Cambridge in 1987. Between 1974 and 1986 Subrahmanyam also served on a number of United Nations and other multilateral study groups, on issues such as Indian Ocean affairs, disarmament and nuclear deterrence; and also at various Pugwash conferences as a senior member.|$|E

25|$|Initially, R relied {{primarily}} on trained intelligence {{officers who were}} recruited directly. These belonged to the external wing of the Intelligence Bureau. In times of great expansion, many candidates {{were taken from the}} military, police and the Indian Revenue Service. Later, R began directly recruiting graduates from universities. However owing to allegations of nepotism in appointments, in 1983 R created its own service cadre, the Research and Analysis Service (RAS) to absorb talent from other Group A Civil Services, under the Central Staffing Scheme. Direct recruitment at Class I executive level is from Civil services officers undergoing Foundation course at Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration. At the end of the course, R conducts a campus interview. Based on a selection of psychological tests and the interview, candidates are inducted into R for a lien period of one year. During this period, they have an option of rejoining their parent service (if they wish to) after which they can be permanently absorbed into the Research and Analysis Service. Delhi-based security think tank Institute for Defence <b>Studies</b> <b>and</b> <b>Analyses</b> noted in one of its reports that R suffered from the 'tail-end syndrome' where the 'bottom of the entrance lists' of those qualifying the UPSC examinations were offered jobs. Additionally, recruitment is also by lateral deputation from the Officer corps of Armed Forces or Group A Civil Service Officers. The Civil and Defence Service Officers permanently resign their cadre and join the RAS. However, according to recent reports, officers can return to their parent cadre after serving a specific period in the agency if they wish to. Most of the secretaries have been officers from the IPS and other posts are held by IRS and IFS officers. R also employs a number of linguists and other experts in various fields. The service conditions of R officers are governed by the Research and Analysis Wing (Recruitment, Cadre and Service) Rules, 1975.|$|E
2500|$|Subrahmanyam was a {{key figure}} in framing and {{influencing}} Indian security and nuclear policy.

He was the second director of the New Delhi-based Institute for Defence <b>Studies</b> <b>and</b> <b>Analyses.</b> He is also noted for having steered several [...] Indian government committees and commissions of inquiry, including one on a war fought between India and Pakistan. Subrahmanyam was a major advocate of the 2007 Indo-US civilian nuclear agreement, adding some heft to the Manmohan Singh government's championing of the deal in the face of much opposition.|$|E

The Institute for Defence <b>Studies</b> <b>and</b> <b>Analyses</b> stated {{that the development of}} the Nasr indicates that Pakistan views Cold Start with concern and that the missile was meant to deter India's implementation of the doctrine. It added that the net result would be [...] "further nuclear impact(s) on India's territory".|$|E
