40|$|In this article, I clarify {{and further}} discuss 4 {{issues raised by}} Zacher in {{critically}} analyzing my perspective on <b>successful</b> aging <b>at</b> work and the active role of employees. First, I argue that the sustainability concept is a valuable and useful concept to better understand <b>successful</b> aging <b>at</b> work, and I aimed to integrate sustainability by taking a resource perspective, focusing {{on the importance of}} continuous person–environment fit in <b>successful</b> aging <b>at</b> work. Second, I argue that the maintenance in health, motivation, and work ability is an important criterion for <b>successful</b> aging <b>at</b> work. Third, I argue that since an active role of employees is increasingly important in contemporary workplaces, research on proactive behaviors relevant for <b>successful</b> aging <b>at</b> work and their antecedents is sorely needed. Fourth, I argue that although the (pro) active role of employees is increasingly important with age, differential preservation is not a necessary requirement for <b>successful</b> aging <b>at</b> work. By further clarifying and discussing the issues raised by Zacher, I hope to stimulate the debate on <b>successful</b> aging <b>at</b> work and the active role of aging employees themselves...|$|R
40|$|It {{is crucial}} to advance {{understanding}} {{of the concept of}} <b>successful</b> aging <b>at</b> work to guide rigorous future research and effective practice. Drawing on the gerontology and life-span developmental literatures, I recently proposed a definition and theoretical framework of <b>successful</b> aging <b>at</b> work that revolve around employees increasingly deviating from average developmental trajectories across the working life span. Based on sustainability, person–job fit, and proactivity theories, Kooij suggested an alternative perspective that emphasizes the active role of employees for <b>successful</b> aging <b>at</b> work. In this article, I compare the 2 approaches and attempt a partial integration. I highlight the importance of a precise definition, comprehensive model, and critical discussion of <b>successful</b> aging <b>at</b> work. Furthermore, I suggest that person–environment fit variables other than person–job fit (e. g., person–organization fit) and adapting to person–environment misfit may also contribute to <b>successful</b> aging <b>at</b> work. Finally, I argue that proactive behaviors must have age-differential effects on work outcomes to be considered personal resources for <b>successful</b> aging <b>at</b> wor...|$|R

5|$|A {{study in}} 1971–72 found that {{although}} Cleveland's crime rate {{was significantly lower}} than other large urban areas, most Cleveland residents feared crime. In the 1980s, gang activity was on the rise, associated with crack cocaine. A task force was formed and was partially <b>successful</b> <b>at</b> reducing gang activity {{by a combination of}} removing gang-related graffiti and educating news sources to not name gangs in news reporting.|$|E

5|$|After {{the success}} of Spielberg's Jurassic Park, Joe Johnston {{expressed}} interest in directing a sequel. Spielberg instead gave Johnston permission to direct a third film in the series, if {{there were to be}} one. Production of Jurassic Park III began on August 30, 2000. Despite mixed reviews from critics, the film was <b>successful</b> <b>at</b> the box office, grossing $368 million worldwide. A sequel, Jurassic World, was released on June 12, 2015.|$|E

5|$|Barris {{remained}} {{heavily involved}} in production {{in an attempt to}} portray the film from his point of view. To accommodate the $30 million budget, Clooney convinced Drew Barrymore and Julia Roberts to lower their salaries. The film was released to respectful reviews from critics and was modestly <b>successful</b> <b>at</b> the box office. Rockwell, in particular, was praised for his acting and won the Silver Bear for Best Actor at the 2003 Berlin International Film Festival.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, Newton's law of universal gravitation had been accepted for more than two hundred years as a valid description of the gravitational force between masses. In Newton's model, gravity is the result of an attractive force between massive objects. Although even Newton was troubled by the unknown nature of that force, the basic framework was extremely <b>successful</b> <b>at</b> describing motion.|$|E

The transports also had to run the gauntlet of radar-equipped Bristol Beaufighters but these rarely were <b>successful</b> <b>at</b> intercepting them.|$|E
