5000|$|One of Katz's seminal findings, in <b>studies</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> Paul Fatt in 1951, {{was that}} {{spontaneous}} {{changes in the}} potential of muscle-cell membrane occur even without the stimulation of the presynaptic motor neuron. These spikes in potential are similar to action potentials except that they are much smaller, typically less than 1 mV; they were thus called miniature end plate potentials (MEPPs). In 1954, {{the introduction of the}} first electron microscopic images of postsynaptic terminals revealed that these MEPPs were created by synaptic vesicles carrying neurotransmitters. The sporadic nature of the release of quantal amounts of neurotransmitter led to the [...] "vesicle hypothesis" [...] of Katz and del Castillo, which attributes quantization of transmitter release to its association with synaptic vesicles. This also indicated to Katz that action potential generation can be triggered by the summation of these individual units, each equivalent to an MEPP.|$|E
50|$|Female condoms {{are made}} of two {{flexible}} polyurethane rings and a loose-fitting polyurethane sheath. According to laboratory testing, female condoms are effective in preventing the leakage of body fluids and therefore the transmission of STIs and HIV. Several studies show that between 50% and 73% {{of women who have}} used this type of condoms during intercourse find them as or more comfortable than male condoms. On the other hand, acceptability of these condoms among the male population is somewhat less, at approximately 40%. Because the cost of female condoms is higher than male condoms, there have been <b>studies</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> the aim of detecting whether they can be reused. Research has shown that structural integrity of polyurethane female condoms is not damaged during up to five uses if it is disinfected with water and household bleach. However, regardless of this study, specialists still recommend that female condoms be used only once and then discarded.|$|E

Results of comparative chemotherapeutic <b>studies</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> econazole and tolnaftate demonstrated superior efficacy of terbinafine {{in the treatment of}} both trichophytosis and microsporosis.
