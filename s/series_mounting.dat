50|$|In 1995, Shimano {{rolled out}} its Nexus line of seven- and four-speed {{internal}} hubs. These {{had a new}} rotary actuator that did away with externally protruding gear shifting elements in the rear wheel. Also, the gear units were able to be shifted under moderate pedaling loads. Shimano had manufactured three speed hubs prior to that, and these hubs were at that point re-branded Nexus. In the early 2000s the 8-speed Nexus hub gear was introduced, having two stepped planetary <b>series</b> <b>mounted</b> downstream of each other. The hub was operated with a twist shifter. By November 2006, The Nexus range came in several ranges (Inter 3, Inter 7 and Inter 8) providing 3, 7 and 8 speed models respectively.|$|R

5000|$|Starting in the Universal era and {{continuing}} until after Mattel purchased the brand, {{a growing awareness}} of the adult collector led to multiple series being produced specifically for that market. The idea was not new; in the 1960s, Lesney had first realized the potential for adult buyers of its products and had marketed gold and silver-plated versions of its Yesteryear <b>series</b> <b>mounted</b> on pen stands, ashtrays, and similar items. Also (as mentioned above, cf. [...] "History"), in the 1970s and particularly the 1980s, contact by the company to collectors and sponsors led {{to the release of}} a small number of highly collectible models designed for a limited, but more profitable market base. Most often, these models were Yesteryears, though the 1-75 series was also used for this purpose.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} experiment of <b>series</b> <b>mounted</b> diode rectifier and single stage voltage doubler rectifier at 2. 45 GHz for applications involving microwave power transmission. Input matching circuit and harmonics filtering at both the input and output have been optimized for high efficiency operation. The series topology is dedicated to low input power conversion. Measurement results show that 40 % and 27 % RF-DC conversion efficiency are achieved for 0 dBm and - 5 dBm input power respectively at 2. 45 GHz. A maximum efficiency of 54 % is obtained for an input power of 12 dBm and a 3 V output DC voltage is measured at a 1 KΩ DC load when the rectifier is matched to 50 Ω. The voltage doubler structure is aimed for high input power conversion and exhibits more than 4 V at 2. 4 GHz for input power above 15 dBm...|$|R
