However,the mechanism of FGF 2 membrane translocation into the extracellular space has remained elusive. Here we show that PI(4, 5) P 2 dependent membrane recruitment causes FGF 2 to oligomerize which, in turn, triggers the formation of a lipidic membrane pore with a putative toroidal structure. This process is strongly upregulated by tyrosine phosphorylation of FGF 2.

Experiments and direct numerical simulations (DNS) in pipe and channel flows demonstrate the emergence of EIT at Reynolds numbers {{much lower than the}} critical Reynolds number for transition to turbulence in Newtonian flows. EIT causes the friction factor to deviate from the laminar solution and subsequently transition to the maximum drag reduction asymptote around Re= 1800. EIT is a <b>self-sustained</b> <b>mechanism</b> that arises from the interactions between fluctuations of extensional viscosity, velocity and pressure. The polymer solution elasticity controls the growth of flow instability, resulting in transitional-like flows at high Reynolds numbers.

The model has been extended to include the effect of control. The reduced order dynamical system shows a divergence in time integration. A method of calibration based on theminimization of a linear functional of error, to the sensitivity of the modes, is proposed. The calibrated low order model is used to design a feedback control of cavity flows based on an observer design.

The 24 -h periodicity {{has been well documented}} for several important determinants of urine formation, including renal blood flow, glomerular filtration, tubular reabsorption, and tubular secretion. Disturbance of the renal circadian rhythms is increasingly recognized as a risk factor for hypertension, polyuria, and other diseases and may contribute to renal fibrosis. The origin of these rhythms has been attributed to the reactive response of the kidney to circadian changes in volume and/or in the composition of extracellular fluids that are entrained by rest/activity and feeding/fasting cycles. However, numerous studies have shown that most of the renal excretory rhythms persist for long periods of time, {{even in the absence of}} periodic environmental cues. These observations led to the hypothesis of the existence of a <b>self-sustained</b> <b>mechanism,</b> enabling the kidney to anticipate various predictable circadian challenges to homeostasis.

The challenge of the approach is to implement a technique able to directly implement the stress jumps and to implement a procedure able to deform the mesh to the flow variations.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{peculiar}} aspects of turbulence in wall bounded-flows {{is the ability of}} the turbulent fluctuations to regenerate themselves through self-sustained processes. The dynamics of these <b>self-sustaining</b> <b>mechanisms</b> has been extensively investigated in the past via two complementary approaches. From one side, the possibility to identify very robust kinematic features within the flow feeds the hope of the scientific community to obtain a complete and consistent dynamical description of the physics of the turbulent regeneration cycles in terms of the so-called coherent structures. From the other side, the multi-scale and inhomogeneous features of the <b>self-sustaining</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of turbulence have been addressed by means of global statistical quantities based on two-point averages such as second-order structure functions. The present work attempts to link these two approaches, by identifying how turbulent cycle mechanisms and turbulent structures reflect on the global statistical properties of second-order structure function. To this aim we use Direct Numerical Simulation data of thermally driven turbulence in the Rayleigh-Bénard convection and we analyse {{for the first time the}} behaviour of the second-order structure function of temperature in the complete four-dimensional space of spatio-temporal scales and wall-distances.

40|$|We {{develop a}} {{nonlinear}} wave growth theory of magnetospheric chorus emissions, {{taking into account}} the spatial inhomogeneity of the static magnetic field and the plasma density variation along the magnetic field line. We derive theoretical expressions for the nonlinear growth rate and the amplitude threshold for the generation of self-sustaining chorus emissions. We assume that nonlinear growth of a whistler mode wave is initiated at the magnetic equator where the linear growth rate maximizes. Self-sustaining emissions become possible when the wave propagates away from the equator during which process the increasing gradients of the static magnetic field and electron density provide the conditions for nonlinear growth. The amplitude threshold is tested against both observational data and self-consistent particle simulations of the chorus emissions. The <b>self-sustaining</b> <b>mechanism</b> can result in a rising tone emission covering the frequency range of 0. 1 – 0. 7 Ω e 0, where Ω e 0 is the equatorial electron gyrofrequency. During propagation, higher frequencies are subject to stronger dispersion effects that can destroy the <b>self-sustaining</b> <b>mechanism.</b> We obtain a pair of coupled differential equations for the wave amplitude and frequency. Solving the equations numerically, we reproduce a rising tone of VLF whistler mode emissions that is continuous in frequency. Chorus emissions, however, characteristically occur in two distinct frequency ranges, a lower band and an upper band, separated at half the electron gyrofrequency. We explain the gap by means of the nonlinear damping of the longitudinal component of a slightly oblique whistler mode wave packet propagating along the inhomogeneous static magnetic field...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{work has}} {{established}} {{the usefulness of}} the resolvent operator that maps the terms nonlinear in the turbulent fluctuations to the fluctuations themselves. Further work has described the self-similarity of the resolvent arising from that of the mean velocity profile. The orthogonal modes provided by the resolvent analysis describe the wall-normal coherence of the motions and inherit that self-similarity. In this contribution, we present the implications of this similarity for the nonlinear interaction between modes with different scales and wall-normal locations. By considering the nonlinear interactions between modes, it is shown that much of the turbulence scaling behaviour in the logarithmic region can be determined from a single arbitrarily chosen reference plane. Thus, the geometric scaling of the modes is impressed upon the nonlinear interaction between modes. Implications of these observations on the <b>self-sustaining</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of wall turbulence, modelling and simulation are outlined.

40|$|It {{is shown}} that the ideas of {{selective}} amplification and direct resonance, based on linear theory, can not provide {{an explanation for the}} well-defined streak spacing of about 100 wall units (referred to as 100 (+) hereafter) in wall-bounded turbulent shear flows. In addition, for the direct resonance theory, the streaks are created by the non-linear self-interaction of the vertical velocity rather than of the directly forced vertical vorticity. In view of the failure of these approaches, it is then proposed that the selection mechanism must be inherently non-linear and correspond to a <b>self-sustaining</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The 100 (+) value should thus be considered as a critical Reynolds number for that mechanism. Indeed, in the case of Poiseuille flow, this 100 (+) criterion for transition to turbulence corresponds to the usually quoted value of 1000 based on the half-width and the centerline velocity. In Couette flow, it corresponds to a critical Reynolds number of about 400 based on the half width and half velocity difference...|$|R

The calculations are performed using periodic boundary conditions without any external dynamical forcing. As the initial condition, a spatially uniform unstable gas under thermal equilibrium is considered. At the initial stage, the unstable gas quickly segregates into two phases, or cold neutral medium (CNM) and warm neutral medium (WNM). Then, self-sustained turbulence with velocity dispersion of 0. 1 - 0. 2 km s^- 1 is observed in which the CNM moves around in the WNM. We find that the interfacial medium (IFM) between the CNM and WNM {{plays an important role}} in sustaining the turbulence. The <b>self-sustaining</b> <b>mechanism</b> can be divided into two steps.

40|$|Vortex {{organization}} in the outer layer of a turbulent boundary layer overlying sparse, hemispherical roughness elements is explored with two-component particle-image velocimetry (PIV) in multiple streamwise-wall-normal measurement planes downstream and between elements. The presence of sparse roughness elements causes a shortening of the streamwise length scale in the near-wall region. These measurements confirm that vortex packets exist in the outer layer of flow over rough walls, but that their organization is altered, and this is interpreted as the underlying cause of the length-scale reduction. In particular, the elements shed vortices which appear to align in the near-wall region, but are distinct from the packets. Further, {{it is observed that}} ejection events triggered in the element wakes are more intense compared to the ejection events in smooth wall.

Numerical experiments with unsteady RANS highlight the role of waves travelling on pressure side in the buffet mechanism. Estimates of the propagation velocities of coherent disturbances and of acoustic waves are obtained, to check the validity of popular mechanisms based on acoustic feedback from the trailing edge. -Findings- Unsteady RANS numerical experiments demonstrate that the pressure side of the airfoil plays a marginal role in the buffet mechanism.

40|$|It {{has often}} been {{proposed}} that the formation of large-scale motion (or bulges) {{is a consequence of}} successive mergers and/or growth of near-wall hairpin vortices. In the present study, we report our direct observation that large-scale motion is generated by an instability of an `amplified' streaky motion in the outer region (i. e. very-large-scale motion). We design a numerical experiment in turbulent channel flow up to Re_τ≃ 2000 where a streamwise-uniform streaky motion is artificially driven by body forcing in the outer region computed from the previous linear theory (Hwang & Cossu, J. Fluid Mech., vol. 664, 2015, pp. 51 [...] 73). As the forcing amplitude is increased, it is found that an energetic streamwise vortical structure emerges at a streamwise wavelength of λ_x/h≃ 1 - 5 (h is the half-height of the channel). The application of dynamic mode decomposition and the examination of turbulence statistics reveal that this structure is a consequence of the sinuous-mode instability of the streak, a sub-process of the <b>self-sustaining</b> <b>mechanism</b> of the large-scale outer structures. It is also found that the statistical features of the vortical structure are remarkably {{similar to those of the}} large-scale motion in the outer region.

40|$|A supermassive {{rotating}} toroidal {{black hole}} (TBH) is proposed as the fundamental structure of quasars and other jet-producing active galactic nuclei. Rotating protogalaxies gather matter {{from the central}} gaseous region leading {{to the birth of}} massive toroidal stars whose internal nuclear reactions proceed very rapidly. Once the nuclear fuel is spent, gravitational collapse produces a slender ring-shaped TBH remnant. These events are typically the first supernovae of the host galaxies. Given time the TBH mass increases through continued accretion by several orders of magnitude, the event horizon swells whilst the central aperture shrinks. The difference in angular velocities between the accreting matter and the TBH induces a magnetic field that is strongest in the region of the central aperture and innermost ergoregion. Due to the presence of negative energy states when such a gravitational vortex is immersed in an electromagnetic field, circumstances are near ideal for energy extraction via non-thermal radiation including the Penrose process and superradiant scattering. This establishes a <b>self-sustaining</b> <b>mechanism</b> whereby the transport of angular momentum away from the quasar by relativistic bi-directional jets reinforces both the modulating magnetic field and the TBH/accretion disk angular velocity differential. Quasar behaviour is extinguished once the BH topology becomes spheroidal. Similar mechanisms may be operating in microquasars, SNe and GRBs when neutron density or BH tori arise. In certain circumstances, long-term TBH stability can be maintained by a negative cosmological constant, otherwise the classical topology theorems must somehow be circumvented. Preliminary evidence is presented that Planck-scale quantum effects may be responsible. Comment: 26 pages, 14 figs, various corrections and enhancements, final versio...|$|R
