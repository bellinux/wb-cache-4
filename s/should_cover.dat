25|$|Both the A330-800neo and A330-900neo {{will retain}} the {{fuselage}} lengths of the A330-200 and A330-300, respectively. Cabin optimisation allows 10 additional {{seats on the}} A330-900neo (310 passengers) and six additional seats for the A330-800neo (252 travelers) with 18-inch-wide economy seats. The -800 <b>should</b> <b>cover</b> a 7500nm (13,900km) with 257 passengers (406 max) while the -900 should travel 6550nm (12,130km) with 287 passengers (440 max).|$|E
25|$|Tablature {{notation}} for the tin whistle is a {{graphical representation}} of which tone holes the player <b>should</b> <b>cover.</b> The most common format is a vertical column of six circles, with holes {{to be covered}} for a given note shown filled with black, and a plus sign (+) at the top for notes in the second octave.

25|$|The {{elements}} are interconnected {{only at the}} exterior nodes, and altogether they <b>should</b> <b>cover</b> the entire domain as accurately as possible. Nodes will have nodal (vector) displacements or degrees of freedom which may include translations, rotations, and for special applications, higher order derivatives of displacements. When the nodes displace, they will drag the elements along in a certain manner dictated by the element formulation. In other words, displacements of any points in the element will be interpolated from the nodal displacements, {{and this is the}} main reason for the approximate nature of the solution.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{after one}} sees the first flash of intense heat and {{light of the}} {{developing}} nuclear fireball, one should stop, get under some cover and Drop/Duck to the ground. There, one should assume a prone-like position, lying face-down, and to afford protection against the continuing heat of the explosion further cover exposed skin {{and the back of}} one's head with one's clothes; or, if no excess cover or cloth is available, one <b>should</b> <b>cover</b> the back of their head and neck with their hands.|$|E
25|$|On June 24, 1829, {{at the age}} of 81, Elias Hicks went on {{his final}} {{traveling}} ministry to western and central New York State, arriving home in Jericho on November 11, 1829. There, in January 1830, he suffered a stroke that left him partially paralyzed and on February 14, 1830, he suffered an incapacitating secondary stroke. He died some two weeks later on February 27, 1830, his dying concern being that no cotton blanket, a product of slavery, <b>should</b> <b>cover</b> him on his deathbed. Elias Hicks was interred in the Jericho Friends' Burial Ground as was earlier his wife, Jemima, who predeceased him on March 17, 1829.|$|E

500|$|In December 2006, George W. Bush showed dissatisfaction when he {{was asked}} if he was in denial about the {{situation}} in Iraq (the most Bush had said about the situation was that the increase in attacks was [...] "unsettling"). Bush replied [...] "It's bad in Iraq. Does that help?". He had another run-in with Bush at a press conference at Camp David, when Bush asked him [...] "you still hanging around?". He then suggested to Robinson, with reference {{to the fact that it}} was a hot day, that [...] "next time you <b>should</b> <b>cover</b> your bald head". As Bush walked away, Robinson replied [...] "I didn't know you cared", to which Bush responded [...] "I don't". Robinson described his quip as a [...] "fatal error" [...] on his blog. In a final encounter in 2008, Bush joked with Robinson about still not wearing his hat.|$|E
500|$|Sir Henry Savile, the Warden of Merton College, Oxford, and Provost of Eton College, {{was deeply}} saddened {{by what the}} 20th-century {{mathematician}} Ida Busbridge has described as [...] "the wretched state of mathematical studies in England", and so founded professorships in geometry and astronomy at the University of Oxford in 1619; both chairs were named after him. He also donated his books to the university's Bodleian Library. He required the professors to be men of good character, at least 26 years old, and to have [...] "imbibed the purer philosophy from the springs of Aristotle and Plato" [...] before acquiring a thorough knowledge of science. The professors could come from any Christian country, but he specified that a professor from England should have a Master of Arts degree as a minimum. He wanted students to be educated {{in the works of}} the leading scientists of the ancient world; in addition, the astronomy professor <b>should</b> <b>cover</b> Copernicus and the work of Arab astronomers. Tuition in trigonometry was to be shared by the two professors. [...] As many students would have had little mathematical knowledge, the professors were also permitted to provide instruction in basic mathematics in English (as opposed to Latin, the language used in education at Oxford at the time). He also required the astronomy professor [...] "to take astronomical observations as well by night as by day (making choice of proper instruments prepared for the purpose, and at fitting times and seasons)", and to place in the library records of his discoveries. [...] Savile prohibited the professors from practicing astrology or preparing horoscopes, and stated that accepting any position as a priest or as an officer of the university or of a college would cause forfeiture of the professorship. Each professor was required to lecture in public for 45minutes twice weekly during the university terms and would be fined 10shillings for every day missed (except in cases of [...] "grievous bodily ailment", although this excuse was only permitted for three weeks before the professor was required to provide a substitute lecturer). Students who were required to attend, but who failed to do without good cause, were to be fined sixpence. Savile provided that the rents from specified properties in Kent and Essex were to be divided equally between the professors, giving each Â£160 annually.|$|E
