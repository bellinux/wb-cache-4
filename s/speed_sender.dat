40|$|The {{duty cycle}} of {{wireless}} nodes {{is a key}} factor that determines the life time of wireless sensor networks. In general, sensor medium access control (MAC) protocols reduce duty cycle to achieve longer life time. However, we can find that their performances substantially decrease under extremely low duty cycle (< 0. 1 %). Our proposed U-MAC (Ultra low duty cycle MAC) protocol targets achieving low energy consumption under extremely low duty cycle as well as low duty cycle (0. 1 ~ 1 %). U-MAC estimates the relative clock <b>speed</b> between <b>sender</b> and receiver, and uses it to minimize the wakeup time of transmission node. It saves energy consumption significantly well compared with the existing schemes in order of ten times and also achieves reliable communication. The performance gap increases with lowering the duty cycle...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} a new {{congestion}} control scheme for high-speed networks. The basic idea of our proposed scheme is {{to adopt a}} game theory called, “Minority Game ” (MG), to realize a selective reduction of the transmission <b>speed</b> of <b>senders.</b> More concretely, upon detecting any congestion, the scheme starts a game among all senders who are participating in the communication. The losers of the game reduce the transmission speed by a multiplicative factor. MG is a game that has recently attracted considerable attention, and it {{is known to have}} a remarkable property so that the number of winners converges to a half the number of players in spite of the selfish behavior of the players to increase its own profit. By using this property of MG, we can realize a fair reduction of the transmission speed, which is more efficient than the previous schemes in which all senders uniformly reduce their transmission speed. The effect of the proposed scheme is evaluated by simulation. The result of simulations indicates that the proposed scheme certainly realizes a selective reduction of the transmission speed. It is sufficiently fair compared to other simple randomized schemes and is sufficiently efficient compared to other conventional schemes...|$|R
40|$|A {{fundamental}} problem in wireless communication is the time-frequency shift (TFS) problem: Find the time-frequency shift of a signal in a noisy environment. The shift {{is the result}} of time asynchronization of a sender with a receiver, and of non-zero <b>speed</b> of a <b>sender</b> with respect to a receiver. A classical solution of a discrete analog of the TFS problem is called the matched filter algorithm. It uses a pseudo-random waveform S(t) of the length p, and its arithmetic complexity is O(p^ 2 · log (p)), using fast Fourier transform. In these notes we introduce a novel approach of designing new waveforms that allow faster matched filter algorithm. We use techniques from group representation theory to design waveforms S(t), which enable us to introduce two fast matched filter (FMF) algorithms, called the flag algorithm, and the cross algorithm. These methods solve the TFS problem in O(p· log (p)) operations. We discuss applications of the algorithms to mobile communication, GPS, and radar. Comment: 6 page...|$|R
40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} in network communication {{is critical for}} wirelessly connected small computing devices, which run on limited battery capacity. Under realistic movement scenarios (e. g., a person traveling at airplane, automobile, or biking <b>speed),</b> a mobile <b>sender</b> can track its own movement and postpone communication (subject to application deadline constraints) until it moves close to the communication target. This will save significant energy of sending, which grows superlinearly with the communication distance in, say, the single hop wireless context. However, movement tracking requires the mobile device to be turned on and hence consumes energy. Instead of continuous tracking, the mobile device should sample its movement and be allowed to sleep between the sampling instants (provided that the application also does not {{have work to do}} during the sleep). In this paper, we present an adaptive scheduler for determining an effective sampling schedule given changing operating conditions. Our experimental results show that the scheduler can achieve substantial energy savings over a device that is always on. Moreover, the scheduler’s adaptivity allows it to outperform fixed sleep periods between tracking, since the “right ” sleep period depends on dynamic system conditions and cannot be determined a priori. 1...|$|R
30|$|In VANETs, {{communication}} information {{consist of}} {{two types of}} messages, which are beacon and safety messages. Beacon messages are periodic information which shows presence of vehicle in network. It contains position of vehicle, identity of <b>sender,</b> <b>speed</b> and time. Safety messages are broadcasted {{in the case of}} safety event occurrence showing location of event [23]. VANET applications consist of vehicle cooperation for traffic management, notify drivers about danger on road and provide other comfort messages for passengers. VANET applications improve passenger safety, avoid collission, detection of movable and fixed obstacles and broadcast weather information [24]. Road safety applications consist of emergency electronic brake light (EEBL), slow/stop vehicle advisor (SVA), cooperative collision warning (CCW), road hazard notification (RHN) and post-crash notifications (PCN) [25, 26]. The driver assistance applications warn driver in specific situations like overtaking vehicles and traffic congestion. This application category contains toll booth collection [27], parking notification and congested road notification(CRN) [24, 28]. The third kind of application facilitates drivers and passengers while travelling. It provides mobile Internet services, discussions between vehicles [24] and entertainment [29]. MANETs and VANETs have some similar properties like self-management and low bandwidth. Frequently disconnected network, vehicle density and pattern of traffic flow are well-known challenges in VANETs. These issues directly effect security protocols and safety on wheels.|$|R
