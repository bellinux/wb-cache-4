40|$|Flow <b>softening</b> {{behavior}} during hot compression deformation process of near β titanium alloys was reviewed, including the influencing factors, the flow <b>softening</b> mechanism and its analysis methods, {{the development of}} the constitutive model based on <b>softening</b> mechanism. The influence of deformation parameters and initial microstructure on flow <b>softening</b> behavior was primarily analyzed. Besides, the contribution of <b>softening</b> mechanisms such as dynamic recovery, dynamic recrystallization and deformation heating to flow <b>softening</b> was discussed.

40|$|In N-body {{simulations}} {{the force}} calculated between particles representing a given mass distribution is usually <b>softened,</b> {{to diminish the}} effect of graininess. In this paper we study the effect of such a smoothing, {{with the aim of}} finding an optimal value of the <b>softening</b> parameter. As already shown by Merritt (1996), for too small a <b>softening</b> the estimates of the forces will be too noisy, while for too large a <b>softening</b> the force estimates are systematically misrepresented. In between there is an optimal <b>softening,</b> for which the forces in the configuration approach best the true forces. The value of this optimal <b>softening</b> depends both on the mass distribution and on the number of particles used to represent it. For higher number of particles the optimal <b>softening</b> is smaller. More concentrated mass distributions necessitate smaller <b>softening,</b> but the <b>softened</b> forces are never as good an approximation of the true forces as for not centrally concentrated configurations. We give good estimates of the optimal <b>softening</b> for homogeneous spheres, Plummer spheres, and Dehnen spheres. We also give a rough estimate of this quantity for other mass distributions, based on the harmonic mean distance to the $k$th neighbour ($k$ = 1, [...] , 12), the mean being taken over all particles in the configuration. Comparing homogeneous Ferrers ellipsoids of different shapes we show that the axial ratios do not influence the value of the optimal <b>softening.</b> Finally we compare two different types of <b>softening,</b> a spline <b>softening</b> (Hernquist & Katz 1989) and a generalisation of the standard Plummer <b>softening</b> to higher values of the exponent. We find that the spline <b>softening</b> fares roughly as well as the higher powers of the power-law <b>softening</b> and both give a better representation of the forces than the standard Plummer <b>softening.</b> Comment: 16 pages Latex, 19 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS, corrected typos, minor changes mainly in sec. ...|$|R
40|$|Pairwise forces between {{particles}} in cosmological N-body simulations are generally <b>softened</b> to avoid hard collisions. Physically, this <b>softening</b> corresponds to treating the particles as diffuse clouds rather than point masses. For particles of unequal mass (and hence unequal <b>softening</b> length), computing the <b>softened</b> force involves a nontrivial double integral over the {{volumes of the}} two particles. We show that Plummer force <b>softening</b> is consistent with this interpretation of force <b>softening</b> while spline <b>softening</b> is not. We provide closed-form expressions and numerical implementation for pairwise gravitational potential and force laws for pairs of particles of general <b>softening</b> scales ε 1 and ε 2 assuming the commonly used cloud profiles: NGP, CIC, TSC, and PQS and relate them to gaussian, Plummer and spline force <b>softening.</b> Our expressions allow possible inclusions of pointlike objects such as stars or supermassive black holes.

40|$|Abstract [...] The {{dynamic and}} static <b>softening</b> {{behaviors}} during multistage hot deformation of aluminum alloys {{have been studied}} by double-hit compression testing in the temperature range of 300 - 400 ºC. The interrupted deformations were conducted with delay times varying between 30 and 120 seconds after achieving a strain of approximately 0. 4 in the first stage. It was indicated that the considerable dynamic <b>softening</b> and exceptional <b>softening</b> associated with a structure <b>softening</b> exist in alloy deformation at 400 ºC, leading to an initial flow stress value at the second deformation lower than that at the first deformation. For all alloys studied, the static <b>softening</b> increases with increasing deformation temperature and holding temperature and delay times.

40|$|Abstract. Experiments {{were carried}} out in which the {{dependence}} of the fractional <b>softening</b> on temperature, time and strain rate was determined in a 304 H stainless steel. Three prestrain ranges were identified pertaining to three different post-deformation <b>softening</b> behaviors: 1) prestraining to below the DRX critical strain: strongly strain dependent <b>softening</b> by SRX alone with <b>softening</b> kinetics controlled by growth rate of the nuclei; 2) prestraining to above the DRX critical strain: SRX + MDRX <b>softening</b> with weaker strain dependence of the kinetics but still controlled by grain growth; 3) at a prestrain of ε* and beyond: nucleation-controlled MDRX <b>softening</b> with the full inhibition of SRX. The transition prestrain ε * can exceed the peak strain if the DRX grain refinement ratio g = D 0 /DDRX> 4. The transition to MDRX-dominated <b>softening</b> {{can be attributed to}} a constant value of the normalized strain hardening rate independent of the preloading temperature and strain rate. The <b>softening</b> data from the compression tests show that at ε*, the time for half <b>softening</b> t 50 exhibits a minimum. These data differ somewhat from observations obtained in the torsion testing of solid bars, in which no strain dependence of t 50 was detected at ε * and beyond. Whether or not the strain dependence of t 50 vanishes in the MDRX range is sensitive to the test method employed to study the post-deformation <b>softening...</b>|$|R
