For reference purposes, a first configuration based on a classical shear coaxial injector head with 13 elements has been investigated. The second configuration consists of a planar porous faceplate made from <b>sinter</b> <b>bronze</b> and 68 implemented single LOX tubes. Hydrogen was injected through the porous faceplate whereas liquid oxygen enters the combustion chamber in a classical parallel showerhead configuration at moderate injection velocities.

In addition, the LOX tubes have been modified from a parallel to a far downstream impinging arrangement in order to enhance the combustor wall compatibility. Liquid oxygen was injected at 120 K whereas the hydrogen injection temperature was about 50 K with the porous configurations and about 90 K with the coaxial injector head. c*-efficiency data have been gathered as well as some basic information on the axial heat flux distribution during steady state operation.

50|$|For a {{single-ended}} HF antenna, a good {{electrical earth}} connection is essential. It {{is also necessary}} from the points of view of safety and EMC considerations on any radio transmitter installation on a boat or ship. As mentioned above, metal-hulled vessels have a natural advantage in that, especially at HF and lower frequencies, the hull can {{be considered to be}} in contact with the water, as the insulating properties of the paint layer against the water is a capacitance that presents very little electrical impedance to the RF currents. For fibreglass and wooden hulls and HF transmission, the usual solution is to attach a <b>sintered</b> <b>bronze</b> plate to the outside of the hull for RF earthing. The construction of a <b>sintered</b> <b>bronze</b> plate is porous to water so that although the plate may be only a square foot or two and an inch thick, the actual surface area of metal in electrical contact with the water is very many times that.|$|E
40|$|In porous resistances, Darcy's law {{provides}} a good approximation of mass flow rate when the differences between upstream and downstream pressures are sufficiently small. In this range, the mass flow rates are proportional to the porous resistance's permeability. For gas bearings, the pressure difference is normally higher, and it is known experimentally that the mass flow rates are lower than would result from Darcy's law. Forchheimer's law adds an inertial term to Darcy's law and, when an appropriate coefficient is selected for this term, {{provides a}} good approximation of flow rates for the same applications even with the highest pressure differences. This paper presents an experimental and theoretical investigation of porous resistances used in gas bearing and thrust pad supply systems. The porous resistances considered in the investigation were made by <b>sintering</b> <b>bronze</b> powders with different grain sizes to produce cylindrical inserts that can be installed in bearing supply devices. The paper describes the test set-up and experimental results obtained for: a) Mass flow rate through single porous resistances at different upstream and downstream pressures; and b) Mass flow rate and pressure distribution on a pneumatic pad featuring the same porous resistances. The theoretical permeability of the chosen porous resistances was calculated, and the results from set-up a) were then used to obtain experimental permeability and to determine the inertial coefficients.

40|$|International audienceElectrowetting is used {{to force}} {{imbibition}} in model porous plates. These porous plates are <b>sintered</b> disordered <b>bronze</b> bead packings that are homogeneously coated with a constant-thickness layer of parylene. Cycles of increasing and decreasing voltage trigger the imbibition of a ionized water sessile drop by changing its contact angle with the porous material from non-wetting to wetting shapes. During a cycle, a drop experiences partial imbibition and a strong hysteresis of its contact angle with the porous plate. Since the imbibition process quickly stabilizes, we adopt an equilibrium description of the wetting properties of the drop on the porous plate. Our model, based on the Cassie-Baxter approach, shows that three different wetting states are experienced by the drop, one of which being made possible only by the modification of the contact angle inside the pores.

The linings typically consist of molybdenum, iron, bronze or carbon.The synchronizing rings are produced either by massive forming (common forging) or sheet metal shaping. The latter involves the stamping of the blank out of a sheet metal strip and the subsequent machining with follow-on composite tools or transfer tools. A friction lining usually consists of thermally splashed molybdenum. Alternatively, iron or <b>bronze</b> <b>sinter</b> friction layers can be used. Carbon-coated synchronizer rings are particularly wear resistant and offer very good friction behavior. Due to their higher price, these are reserved for high-performance transmissions.|$|R

These synchronizers have three friction surfaces, which increase {{their ability to}} transfer the flow of torque more smoothly from one gear to another. Synchronizers act as clutches to speed up or slow down the gearsets that are being shifted to, and greater friction area results in easier shifting for the driver. The 3rd, 4th, and reverse synchronizers are double-cone, while the 5th and 6th gear synchronizers are single-cone.

On metal hulled boats the earthing plate can be dispensed with, and the whole hull used as a ground. In this case, the thickness of any paint layer is entirely negligible at RF.

Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and contact-gage surface profiler were used to analyze the evolution of the substrate morphology after laser treatments, whilst their mechanical properties were evaluated by micro-hardness and scratch tests. The experimental findings showed a decrease in the surface roughness of the porous substrates after laser treatments of ∼ 70 %.
