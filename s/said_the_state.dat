25|$|On March 8, 2004, six {{same-sex}} couples represented by Lambda Legal {{filed suit in}} state court challenging the constitutionality of Washington's Defense of Marriage Act. The four constitutional claims were based on due process, privacy, equal protection, and gender equality. On August 4, King County Superior Court Judge William L. Downing issued an opinion in Andersen v. Sims that <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> had no rational basis for excluding {{same-sex couples}} from the rights and benefits of marriage. The decision concluded that the state law limiting marriage to different-sex couples violated sections of the constitution that required due process and {{equal protection of the}} laws. The court did not require the state to allow same-sex couples to marry, but mandated the creation of a civil union status that would provide all the rights and benefits of marriage to same-sex couples. Downing stayed enforcement of his order pending appeal to the Washington Supreme Court.|$|E

25|$|The International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF) {{and other}} fire safety experts, {{including}} Roger L. Yow, {{president of the}} Charleston Firefighters Association and a former captain with 25 years of service in the department, {{have been critical of}} {{the manner in which the}} fire was handled. Union officials and other fire safety experts claim the City of Charleston Fire Department did not follow procedures consistent with the National Incident Management System. South Carolina governor Mark Sanford directed all state and local emergency response agencies to adopt the system in 2005. Acting state fire marshal John Reich <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> does not inspect the operating procedures of fire departments, but they assume that departments are following guidelines prescribed in the National Incident Management System. Some fire safety experts have also questioned why so many firefighters were in a burning building with a steel truss roof, which is known to be a serious safety hazard for firefighters. A routine fire preplan of the structure in June 2006 made no mention of its roof construction, and it has been suggested that CFD firefighters did not pull the ceiling to check for extension into the roof structure.|$|E
