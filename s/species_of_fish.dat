Upstream of the Lofty Reservoir, {{there are two}} <b>species</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> inhabiting the stream: brook trout, eastern blacknose dace. The 1990 survey observed these two species as well as white suckers and pumpkinseeds. Three <b>species</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> inhabit the stream between the Lofty Reservoir and the Blue Head Reservoir. These species are brook trout, brown trout, and blacknose dace. Six <b>species</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> inhabit the stream below the Blue Head Reservoir: brook trout, blacknose dace, tessellated darters, brown trout, white suckers, and sculpins. However, only the first three species were observed during the 1990 survey of the stream.|$|E
