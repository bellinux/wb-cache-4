5000|$|Physical {{examination}} of the <b>shoulder</b> to <b>feel</b> for injury and discover the limits of movement, location of pain, and extent of joint instability. However, a systematic review of relevant research found that {{the accuracy of the}} physical examination is low.|$|R
50|$|Tracy {{stands in}} the Quartermaine foyer alone, lamenting that she is alone again in life. Alan touches {{his hand on her}} <b>shoulder.</b> She <b>feels</b> it and turns around, but Alan is already gone. A.J. returns home from the crypt and {{promises}} Monica he will never leave her again. Alan watches on and smiles.|$|R
60|$|Lucilla had no {{conviction}} {{that he was}} right; but {{she was willing to}} believe for the time, and was glad to lay her head on his <b>shoulder</b> and <b>feel,</b> while she could, that she had something entirely her own. Too soon it would be over. Lengthen the evening as they would, morning must come at last.|$|R
60|$|Master Talbot {{had done}} considerately in {{arranging}} that Cicely {{should at least}} begin her journey on a pillion behind himself, for her anguish of suppressed weeping unfitted her to guide a horse, and would have {{attracted the attention of}} any serving-man behind whom he could have placed her, whereas she could lay her head against his <b>shoulder,</b> and <b>feel</b> a kind of dreary repose there.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's here," [...] said Neale, {{putting his}} hand to his breast, high up toward the <b>shoulder.</b> [...] "I <b>feel</b> it--a dull, steady, weighty pain.... But that's nothing. I hope I always have it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wanted to}} please you," [...] dropped Mrs. Travers, negligently. A faint, hoarse, and {{impatient}} call {{of a bird}} was heard from the woods as if calling to the oncoming night. Lingard's face grew hot in the deepening dusk. The delicate lemon yellow and ethereal green tints had vanished from {{the sky and the}} red glow darkened menacingly. The sun had set behind the black pall of the forest, no longer edged with a line of gold. [...] "Yes, I was absurdly self-conscious," [...] continued Mrs. Travers in a conversational tone. [...] "And it was the effect of these clothes that you made me put on over some of my European--I almost said disguise; because you know in the present more perfect costume I feel curiously at home; and yet I can't say that these things really fit me. The sleeves of this silk under-jacket are rather tight. My <b>shoulders</b> <b>feel</b> bound, too, and as to the sarong it is scandalously short. According to rule it should have been long enough to fall over my feet. But I like freedom of movement. I have had very little of what I liked in life." ...|$|R
60|$|She put {{her hands}} over him, on his hair, on his <b>shoulders,</b> to <b>feel</b> if the raindrops fell on him. She loved him dearly. He, as he lay with his face on the dead pine-leaves, felt {{extraordinarily}} quiet. He did not mind if the raindrops came on him: he would have lain and got wet through: {{he felt as if}} nothing mattered, as if his living were smeared away into the beyond, near and quite lovable. This strange, gentle reaching-out to death was new to him.|$|R
5|$|Another {{factor that}} brought Cardus to England in 1948 was the {{prospect}} of succeeding Newman, whose retirement as chief music critic of The Sunday Times {{was assumed to be}} imminent. However, Newman had no intention of retiring, and {{made it clear that he}} would resent any successor-designate looking over his <b>shoulder.</b> <b>Feeling</b> slighted, Cardus resigned from the paper and accepted an offer from the London Evening Standard to be its music critic. This new appointment was short-lived; Cardus's lengthy and discursive concert reviews were incompatible with this paper's style, and were ruthlessly cut by subeditors. At the end of 1948 he was back in Australia, proclaiming his intention to settle there permanently. This determination, too, was brief; the lure of London life proved irresistible. Because of the commercial success of his Autobiography, published in 1947, and the immediate commissioning of a second autobiographical work, Cardus was not under immediate financial pressure. He left Australia again in the spring of 1949, and although he spent the English winter of 1950–51 in Australia, writing about the 1950–51 England v. Australia Test series for the Sydney Morning Herald, London was thereafter his permanent home. Here he worked as a freelance writer, in which role he resumed his association with The Manchester Guardian. In December 1951 he was appointed the paper's London music critic, on a permanent salaried basis.|$|R
5000|$|Critical in the {{planning}} {{was the idea of}} plausible deniability, that it should be impossible to prove a direct connection between the assassinations and Israel. In addition, the operations were more generally intended to terrorize Palestinian militants. According to David Kimche, former deputy head of Mossad, [...] "The aim was not so much revenge but mainly to make them Palestinian terrorists frightened. We wanted to make them look over their <b>shoulders</b> and <b>feel</b> that we are upon them. And therefore we tried not to do things by just shooting a guy in the street - that's easy...fairly." ...|$|R
5000|$|Wood {{claimed his}} maiden {{championship}} in August 2012 {{when he took}} the Thailand Open on the OneAsia Tour. He followed this by winning the Commercial Bank Qatar Masters in January 2013, his first European Tour victory, making an eagle on the last hole to win by one stroke. [...] "It's a dream come true," [...] he said after his three-under-par 69 took him to 18 under. [...] "There's an enormous weight lifted off my <b>shoulders.</b> I <b>feel</b> like I can go on and win more. I {{knew it was going to}} be hard no matter how I played - winning on the European Tour is not easy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, {{you don't}} {{put it down}} until {{everything}} is in and well mixed. Then you put it down, half a pint at a time, four times a day. It's a sure cure, and inside of a week after taking seventeen quarts and rubbing the empty bottles on your left <b>shoulder</b> blade you'll <b>feel</b> like dancing a jig of joy; really, you will." ...|$|R
5000|$|Shoulder Angel/DevilMatt Meese plays a life-sized {{shoulder}} angel. Humor {{results from}} the fact that <b>Shoulder</b> Angel <b>feels</b> the need to physically and awkwardly climb to a perch upon the right shoulder of the body of each character for which he attempts to act as a conscience. His catchphrase is [...] "Poof!" [...] which he says upon entering the scene. A variant on this skit is Shoulder Devil, also played by Meese, a life-sized, obese devil who also climbs the body of each character he attempts to tempt. In several sketches, Divine Comedy cast member McKay Lindsey also appears as a shoulder angel, appearing alongside Matt Meese. Debuted Season 1, Episode 2. Shoulder Angel and Shoulder Devil have appeared in seven sketches.|$|R
6000|$|... "Jump up, young un," [...] Bill said; [...] "and you, Jack, get {{off your}} sea-boots. You stand just behind me and hold on, I feel much steadier now that I have got Joe on my <b>shoulders.</b> If you <b>feel</b> that you are going, leave go of me, you will only pull me {{backward}} holding on; {{and as you can}} swim you are all right. You have only got to keep yourself afloat, the tide will drift you up to the island in no time." ...|$|R
500|$|Finn's {{remaining}} prayers {{also come}} true. Rachel comes to Finn's house one evening, {{and in his}} bedroom she admits that she would prefer to raise her children in the Jewish faith; {{she would not be}} able to have a future with him if he puts his faith in Jesus. Finn agrees that their children would be raised as she chooses, so to confirm her trust and appreciation of him, she allows him to touch the side of her breast as they make out. Later, Finn is also reinstated as quarterback, but it occurs because his replacement Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet) is injured during a game, dislocating his <b>shoulder.</b> Finn <b>feels</b> responsible and confesses his guilt to Emma, who tells him it is unlikely God is communicating specifically with him through a grilled cheese sandwich. A despondent Finn doubts his new-found faith, singing R.E.M.'s [...] "Losing My Religion".|$|R
5000|$|Lucy (Collins) {{is working}} as a dancer in a sleazy strip joint. Her stage act {{includes}} a routine with a dwarf named Hercules (George Claydon). One night after the show, she invites Hercules into her dressing-room for a drink. He declines the drink but starts to rub Lucy's neck and <b>shoulders.</b> Lucy <b>feels</b> uncomfortable but tries to pretend nothing is happening, until Hercules makes a sudden lunge for her breasts, causing her to scream out in shock. This alerts the stage manager Tommy (John Steiner), who rushes into the dressing-room and sends Hercules unceremoniously on his way, then proceeds {{to make love to}} Lucy. Later as Lucy leaves the club she is confronted by the spurned and humiliated Hercules, who curses her with the words [...] "You will have a baby...a monster! An evil monster conceived inside your womb! As big as I am small and possessed by the devil himself!" ...|$|R

The woman on the right wears a cross-printed, woven blanket wrapped around her body with a sash tied around her waist. Her long, dark hair falls over her right <b>shoulder</b> as she <b>feels</b> her lightly-colored {{necklace}} between her fingers. The girl on the left wears a dark shawl with lightly-colored stripes over her large skirt as her long hair shades her face. A short, thin tree stands behind them with a plot of small bushes beneath it...|$|R
25|$|Physical {{examination}} of the <b>shoulder</b> to <b>feel</b> for injury and discover the limits of movement, location of pain, and extent of joint instability. The steps to elicit this information are inspection (looking), palpation (feeling), testing range of motion, and performing special maneuvers. Information collected on inspection are asymmetry, atrophy, ecchymosis, scars, swelling, and venous distention. Palpation can help find pain and deformities, and should specifically include the anterior glenohumeral joint, acromioclavicular joint, biceps tendon, cervical spine, coracoid process, scapula, and sternoclavicular joint. Range of motion tests external and internal rotation, abduction and adduction, passive and active weakness, and true weakness versus weakness due to pain. The Apley scratch test is the most useful: touch opposite scapular by reaching behind the head for adduction and external rotation and behind the back for abduction and internal rotation. Finally, there are more specific maneuvers that can hone in on a diagnosis, however their accuracy is limited.|$|R
6000|$|The trifling {{responsibility}} {{of finding a}} name for our talented Magdalen to perform under has been cast on my <b>shoulders.</b> She <b>feels</b> no interest whatever {{in this part of}} the subject. [...] "Give me any name you like," [...] she said; [...] "I have as much right to one as to another. Make it yourself." [...] I have readily consented to gratify her wishes. The resources of my commercial library include a list of useful names to assume; and we can choose one at five minutes' notice, when the admirable man of business who now oppresses us is ready to issue his advertisements. On this point my mind is easy enough: all my anxieties center in the fair performer. I have not the least doubt she will do wonders if she is only left to herself on the first night. But if the day's post is mischievous enough to upset her by a letter from her sister, I tremble for the consequences.|$|R
2500|$|A further stage {{breakthrough}} came in 1994, in an Yvonne Arnaud Theatre production {{bound for}} the West End, when Bill Bryden cast her as Natalya Petrovna in Ivan Turgenev's A Month in the Country. Her co-stars were John Hurt as her aimless lover Rakitin and Joseph Fiennes in only his second professional stage appearance as the cocksure young tutor Belyaev. [...] "Instead of a bored Natalya fretting the summer away in dull frocks, Mirren, dazzlingly gowned, is a woman almost wilfully allowing her heart's desire for her son's young tutor to rule her head and wreak domestic havoc....Creamy <b>shoulders</b> bared, she <b>feels</b> free to launch into a gloriously enchanted, dreamily comic self-confession of love." [...] (John Thaxter, Richmond & Twickenham Times, 4 March 1994) ...|$|R
5000|$|Handle paddles {{increase}} the resistance the hand experiences {{as it tries}} to move through the water during the effective part of the arm stroke - the part of the stroke described as the [...] "pull". [...] This gives the swimmer considerably more forward propulsion from the arm stroke than does a naked hand, and affords an enhanced kinesthetic [...] "feel" [...] of the pull. It also enhances the swimmer's feel of the [...] "catch", the phase prior to the pull, where the hand turns from a streamlined position to grasp the water and begin the pull. If the hand catches or pulls at an incorrect angle, the increased resistance afforded by the hand paddle will exacerbate the result twisting moment, making the defect clearer to the swimmer. The considerably increased load imposed by the hand paddle on the arm and shoulder can, however, lead to pain and an increased risk of injury, so coaches advise only limited use of paddles and that use be discontinued if the swimmer <b>feels</b> <b>shoulder</b> pain.|$|R
2500|$|During {{the making}} of King of Kings, The Honeymoon Machine, and How The West Was Won, as Bazlen was still only 17 years of age at the time, she had to attend {{educational}} classes between takes in order {{to comply with the}} Los Angeles Board of Education's requirement that she carry out three hours of study per day Monday to Friday. Moreover, when answering a question during this time about whether young people were misunderstood by the older generation, she said [...] "Yes, but I'm sure that's been the case down the ages. It's too much to expect people of the older generation completely to understand people of my age. Some {{of the ways in which}} we behave were unheard of in my mother's young days, but each generation finds different symbols to express its discontent." [...] Also, when asked at the same time about how she felt about her rapid rise to stardom at such a young age, Bazlen said [...] "I realise what a lucky person I am and I'm anxious to repay the trust a lot of important people have placed in me. Reaching so high so young has put a lot of responsibility on my <b>shoulders,</b> but I <b>feel</b> that responsibility is part of the pattern of living and it is not to be taken lightly." ...|$|R
50|$|The Duchess appears next to Alice {{and the two}} begin talking. The Duchess {{appears to}} be in a better temper now that she isn't in the kitchen and reveals an {{obsession}} with finding nonsensical morals in everything. Alice tries to back away as she is aware that the Duchess keeps digging her chin into her <b>shoulder,</b> making her <b>feel</b> uncomfortable. The Queen of Hearts appears and tells the Duchess to disappear or be beheaded. The Duchess leaves. Walking Alice along, the Queen asks her if she has ever seen a Mock Turtle before. Alice is bewildered. The Queen decides to take Alice to meet the Mock Turtle and in a second they are at the seashore, greeting a Gryphon. The Queen leaves the Gryphon with Alice and both encounter the Mock Turtle, a sad, lonely turtle who constantly cries and reminisces over his past schooldays in the sea. After a session about school lessons and holidays under the sea, which is just as nonsensical as anything else Alice has encountered in Wonderland, the Gryphon, Mock Turtle and Alice dance the Lobster Quadrille and sing a curious song about a whiting who is reluctant to dance. Alice thanks the two for sharing their knowledge with her, and as the Mock Turtle begins to half cry, half sing Turtle Soup. the White Rabbit appears out of nowhere, announcing that the trial is beginning. Alice tries to get more information about this from the Gryphon but he just pulls her away. The Mock Turtle doesn't notice they have gone, and still sings his song.|$|R

I just tried to get it to the net and it went in every time." [...] Despite missing 10 games to injury, Horton was tied with teammate Olli Jokinen for the team lead in goals with 16 after 38 games. Against Washington on January 9, Horton and Joe Nieuwendyk scored a goal in the shootout to help the Panthers win 43. Two days after his shootout goal, Horton was promoted to the Panthers' first line. Despite his promotion to the first line, Horton's name was mentioned in a potential trade with the Vancouver Canucks; however, nothing materialized. [...] In a 62 win over the Ottawa Senators, Horton scored 2 goals including one on a rebound, after which he said, [...] "It just popped right out to me. It was a long time coming for goals for me. I got lucky tonight and hopefully they keep going in." [...] In March, Horton began playing in penalty kill situations for the first time in his career. Also against the Lightning, Horton scored the Panthers' only goal with his 27th goal of the season. Horton completed the season playing 71 games, scoring 28 goals and adding 19 assists.|$|R
