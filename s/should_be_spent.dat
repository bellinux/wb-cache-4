5|$|During the Reformation, Martin Luther {{rejected}} {{many of the}} Catholic Church's seven sacraments, but retained baptism and the Lord's Supper. He {{saw many}} practices of the medieval church as abuses of power intended to require work in order to merit forgiveness for sin after baptism rather than faith alone. Luther attached the promise of salvation to baptism, and taught that life after baptism <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>spent</b> in recollection {{of it and the}} dying to sin it signified.|$|E
5|$|Lacking that guidance, discussions {{began on}} how the bequest money <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>spent.</b> The City Lands Committee {{suggested}} in a report that the bequest <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>spent</b> on educating {{a larger number of}} boys and this approach was adopted in 1826. A number of people including Richard Taylor, a printer and an assistant to the founding of University College London, urged the Corporation of London to spend the bequest on creating a day school for the largest possible number of boys. In 1830, they proposed that the City of London Corporation School be founded with Taylor as a governor, and that the school to be established {{on the site of the}} disused London Workhouse. In the mean time, a small number of boys, who became known as Carpenter's scholars, were sent to Tonbridge School. In 1829, an Act of Parliament was passed to transform the workhouse into a school and governors were appointed. Conditions at the workhouse site had deteriorated and much money was needed for its maintenance. The only funds available, though, were the same £300 (about £22,000 in 2008) a year budget the workhouse had received.|$|E
5|$|Many {{commentators}} {{suggested that}} the 2012 rise in tuition fees in England would put poorer students off applying to university. However, the {{gap between rich and}} poor students has slightly narrowed (from 30.5% in 2010 to 29.8% in 2013) since the introduction of the higher fees. This may be because universities have used tuition fees to invest in bursaries and outreach schemes. In 2016, The Guardian noted that the number of disadvantaged students applying to university had increased by 72% from 2006 to 2015, a bigger rise than in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. It wrote that most of the gap between richer and poorer students tends to open up between Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 4 (i.e. at secondary school), rather than when applying for university, and so the money raised from tuition fees <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>spent</b> there instead.|$|E

5|$|The Treaty of Bruges (1375) ensured {{peace for}} two years, but after it expired, {{fighting}} resumed between England and France. In 1377 Edward III was succeeded by Richard II. During the war, England and France struggled {{for control of}} the English Channel, with raids on both coasts. With the renewed hostilities, Parliament voted that money <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>spent</b> on defending and fortifying England's south coast, and defences were erected in Kent in anticipation of a French invasion. There was internal unrest as well as external threats, and Dalyngrigge was involved in suppressing the Peasants' Revolt of 1381. The manor of Bodiam was granted a charter in 1383 permitting a weekly market and an annual fair to be held. In 1385, a fleet of 1,200 ships– variously cogs, barges, and galleys– gathered across the English Channel at Sluys, Flanders; the population of southern England {{was in a state of}} panic. Later in the year, Edward Dalyngrigge was granted a licence to fortify his manor house.|$|E

The Committee received submissions from interested parties prior to 1 July 2016, and heard testimony {{from a range of}} witnesses.

25|$|On 27 May 1787, he derailed {{yet another}} Polish policy which seemed {{threatening}} to Russia. With few major {{wars in the}} past decades, {{the economy of the}} Commonwealth was improving, and its budget had a notable surplus. Many voices said that the money <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>spent</b> on increasing the size, and providing new equipment for, the Polish army. However, as a large Polish army could be a threat to the Russian garrisons controlling Poland, von Stackelberg ordered his proxies in the Permanent Council to spend the money on a different goal: for the huge sum of 1 million zlotys (representing most of the surplus), the Council bought the von Brühl's Palace – and promptly donated it to 'Poland's ally', Russia, to serve as Russia's new embassy.|$|E
25|$|In July 1917, after {{consulting}} with architectural and artistic experts in London, Ware invited Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker, architects; Charles Aitken, {{director of the}} Tate Gallery; and author Sir James Barrie to tour British battlefield cemeteries near the front {{in an attempt to}} formulate broad ideas for the post-war design of these burying grounds. The trip began on 9 July. The group met formally on 14 July after the trip ended. Ware, Lutyens, and Baker agreed that every cemetery ought to obey a general theme (although the theme was not yet established), that there should only be four variations on the theme (monumental, garden or woodland, village, and town cemeteries), that grave markers should be uniform headstones (not crosses), and that cemetery walls should be horizontal. Aitken insisted on cemeteries of simple design and low cost, feeling public money <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>spent</b> on practical items like schools and hospitals. Baker wanted a cross at each cemetery, but Lutyens wanted a more abstract symbol. Aitken supported Baker in thinking that a cross was more appropriate in the French countryside. At one point, Baker suggested a cross with a pentagonal shaft (one side for each self-governing dominion), and for Indian cemeteries a column topped by appropriate symbol (such as the dharmacakra or Star of India).|$|E
500|$|Donovan taught Lennon {{a guitar}} finger-picking {{technique}} that he {{passed on to}} Harrison. The technique was subsequently implemented by Lennon on the Beatles songs [...] "Julia" [...] and [...] "Dear Prudence". The latter was composed by Lennon to lure Prudence Farrow out of her intense meditation. Lennon later said: [...] "She'd been locked in for three weeks {{and was trying to}} reach God quicker than anyone else". Another inspiration was hearing for the first time Bob Dylan's newly released album, John Wesley Harding. The stay at the ashram {{turned out to be one}} of the group's most creative periods. According to Lennon he wrote some of the [...] "most miserable" [...] and some of his [...] "best songs" [...] while he was in Rishikesh. Both Lennon and McCartney often spent time composing rather than meditating, and even Starr wrote a song, [...] "Don't Pass Me By", which was his first solo composition. Plans were made for a concert in Delhi to feature the Beatles, the Beach Boys, Donovan, and Paul Horn. Harrison complained that more time <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>spent</b> on meditating, saying, [...] "We're not here to talk about music. We're here to meditate." [...] Lennon commented on Harrison's commitment to meditation by saying: [...] "The way George [...] is going, he'll be flying a magic carpet by the time he's forty." ...|$|E
