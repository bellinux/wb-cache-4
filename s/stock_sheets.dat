40|$|This paper {{presents}} an approach for solving a new real problem in cutting and packing. At its core is an innovative mixed integer programme model that places irregular pieces and defines guillotine cuts. The two-dimensional irregular shape bin packing problem with guillotine constraints arises {{in the glass}} cutting industry, for example, the cutting of glass for conservatories. Almost all cutting and packing problems that include guillotine cuts deal with rectangles only, where all cuts are orthogonal {{to the edges of}} the <b>stock</b> <b>sheet</b> and a maximum of two angles of rotation are permitted. The literature tackling packing problems with irregular shapes largely focuses on strip packing i. e. minimizing the length of a single fixed width <b>stock</b> <b>sheet,</b> and does not consider guillotine cuts. Hence, this problem combines the challenges of tackling the complexity of packing irregular pieces with free rotation, guaranteeing guillotine cuts that are not always orthogonal to the edges of the <b>stock</b> <b>sheet,</b> and allocating pieces to bins. To our knowledge only one other recent paper tackles this problem. We present a hybrid algorithm that is a constructive heuristic that determines the relative position of pieces in the bin and guillotine constraints via a mixed integer programme model. We investigate two approaches for allocating guillotine cuts {{at the same time as}} determining the placement of the piece, and a two phase approach that delays the allocation of cuts to provide flexibility in space usage. Finally we describe an improvement procedure that is applied to each bin before it is closed. This approach improves on the results of the only other publication on this problem, and gives competitive results for the classic rectangle bin packing problem with guillotine constraint...|$|R

According to the definition of guillotine cutting, it seems that the waste in this form of problem is {{greater than or equal to}} that in the non-guillotine form, as the guillotine cut imposes a limitation and, as we know, as the limitations increase, if the solution space does not shrink, at best, it will be constant and not grow.|$|R
40|$|In various industries, {{manufacturers}} must cut rectangular {{items from}} <b>stock</b> <b>sheets.</b> In the actual setting, <b>stock</b> <b>sheets</b> inevitably contain some defects, and manufacturers have to avoid cutting the products which contain the defects (i. e., TFT–LCD industry, e-paper); therefore, the two-dimensional bin packing problems with defect (2 DBPPWD) emerges. However, no effective method for solving 2 DBPPWD {{in the current}} literature has been developed. To address the research gaps and industrial requirements, this study proposes an effective approach that integrates ant colony optimization with the flawless corner space placement algorithm to solve 2 DBPPWD. Finally, we compare the proposed approach with the traditional approach (genetic algorithm integrated with bottom–left placement) to solve C 21 (Hopper &Turton, 2001) and N 13 (Burke et al., 2004) problems. Computational results demonstrate that our proposed approach can solve 2 DBPPWD effectively and significantly outperform those of current approaches.

These problems, with all their extensions and variants, are well known to be NP-hard [1]. This means that all algorithms currently known for finding optimal solutions require a number of computational steps that may grow exponentially with the problem size rather than according to a polynomial function.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{proposed}} a local search heuristic and a genetic algorithm to solve the two-dimensional irregular multiple bin-size bin packing problem. The problem consists of placing a set of pieces represented as 2 D polygons in rectangular bins with different dimensions such that the total area of bins used is minimized. Most packing algorithms available in the literature for 2 D irregular bin packing consider single size bins only. However, for many industries the material can be supplied {{in a number of}} standard size sheets, for example, metal, foam, plastic and timber sheets. For this problem, the cut plans must decide the set of standard size <b>stock</b> <b>sheets</b> as well as which pieces to cut from each bin and how to arrange them in order to minimise waste material. Moreover, the literature constrains the orientation of pieces to a single or finite set of angles. This is often an artificial constraint that makes the solution space easier to navigate. In this paper we do not restrict the orientation of the pieces. We show that the local search heuristic and the genetic algorithm can address all of these decisions and obtain good solutions, with the local search performing better. We also discuss the effect of different groups of stock sheet sizes...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} a new {{variant of the}} two-dimensional bin packing problem where each rectangle is assigned a due date and each bin has a fixed processing time. Hence the objective {{is not only to}} minimize the number of bins, but also to minimize the maximum lateness of the rectangles. This problem is motivated by the cutting of <b>stock</b> <b>sheets</b> and the potential increased efficiency that might be gained by drawing on a larger pool of demand pieces by mixing orders, while also aiming to ensure a certain level of customer service. We propose a genetic algorithm for searching the solution space, which uses a new placement heuristic for decoding the gene based on the best fit heuristic designed for the strip packing problems. The genetic algorithm employs an innovative crossover operator that considers several different children from each pair of parents. Further, the dual objective is optimized hierarchically with the primary objective periodically alternating between maximum lateness and number of bins. As a result, the approach produces several non-dominated solutions with different trade-offs. Two further approaches are implemented. One is based on a previous Unified Tabu Search, suitably modified to tackle this revised problem. The other is a randomized descent and serves as a benchmark for comparing the results. Comprehensive computational results are presented, which show that the Unified Tabu Search still works well in minimizing the bins, but the genetic algorithm performs slightly better.

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} {{two-dimensional}} irregular packing problem with multiple homogeneous bins (2 DIBPP). The literature on irregular shaped packing problems {{is dominated by}} the single stock sheet strip packing problem. However, in reality manufacturers are cutting orders over multi-stock sheets. Despite its greater relevance, {{there are only a few}} papers that tackle this problem in the literature. A multi-stock sheet problem has two decision components; the allocation of pieces to <b>stock</b> <b>sheets</b> and the layout design for each stock sheet. In this paper, we propose a heuristic method that addresses both the allocation and placement problems together based on the Jostle algorithm. Jostle was first applied to strip packing. In order to apply Jostle to the bin packing problem we modify the placement heuristic. In addition we improve the search capability by introducing a diversification mechanism into the approach. Furthermore, the paper presents alternative strategies for handling rotation of pieces, which includes a restricted set of angles and unrestricted rotation. Very few authors permit unrestricted rotation of pieces, despite this being a feature of many problems where the material is homogeneous. Finally, we investigate alternative placement criteria and show that the most commonly applied bottom left criteria does not perform as well as other options. The paper evaluates performance of each algorithm using different sets of instances considering convex and non-convex shapes. Findings of this study reveal that the proposed algorithms can be applied to different variants of the problem and generate significantly better results...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} number of {{variants}} of a constructive algorithm able to solve {{a wide variety of}} variants of the Two-Dimensional Irregular Bin Packing Problem (2 DIBPP). The aim of the 2 DIBPP is to pack a set of irregular pieces, which may have concavities, into <b>stock</b> <b>sheets</b> (bins) with fixed dimensions {{in such a way that}} the utilization is maximized. This problem is inspired by a real application from a ceramic company in Spain. In addition, this problem arises in other industries such as the garment industry or ship building. The constructive procedure presented in this paper allows both free orientation for the pieces, as in the case of the ceramic industry, or a finite set of orientations as in the case of the garment industry. We explicitly model the assignment of pieces to bins and compare with the more common strategy of packing bins sequentially. There are very few papers in the literature that address the bin packing problem with irregular pieces and to our knowledge this is the first to additionally consider free rotation of pieces with bin packing. We propose several Integer Programing models to determine the association between pieces and bins and then we use a Mixed Integer Programing model for placing the pieces into the bins. The computational results show that the algorithm obtains high quality results in sets of instances with different properties.

40|$|The trim-loss, {{or cutting}} stock, problem arises {{whenever}} material manufactured continuously or in large pieces {{has to be}} cut into pieces of sizes ordered by customers. The problem is so to organize the cutting as to minimize {{the amount of waste}} (trim-loss) resulting from it. Brown (1971) remarks that no practical solution method has been found for the generalized 2 -dimensional trim-loss problem. This thesis discusses the applicability of heuristic search methods as solution techniques for this and other problems. Chapter 2 describes three types of combinatorial search method, state-space search, problem reduction, and branch-and-bound. There is a discussion {{of the ways in which}} heuristic information can be incorporated into these methods, and descriptions of the versions of the methods used in the work described in succeeding chapters. In the 1 -dimensional trim-loss problem order lengths of some material such as steel bars must be cut from stock lengths held by the supplier. Gilmore and Gomory (1961, 1963) have formulated a mathematical programming solution of this problem, which also arises with the slitting of steel rolls, cutting of metal pipe and slitting of cellophane rolls. Their approach has been developed by Haessler (1971, 1975) who is particularly concerned with problems arising in the paper industry. In the 1 ½-dimensional case the material is manufactured as a continuous sheet of constant width and it is required to minimize the length produced to satisfy orders for rectangular pieces. In the 2 -dimensional case the orders are again for rectangular pieces, but here the stock is held as large rectangular sheets. In both cases there may be restrictions as to the way in which the material may be cut; the generalized problem in each case occurs when no such restrictions exist. The 1 ½-dimensional problem appears to be easier of solution than the 2 -dimensional case since in the latter it is necessary not only to determine the relative positions of the required pieces in a cutting pattern, but also to partition the pieces into sets to be cut from separate <b>stock</b> <b>sheets.</b> A solution method for the easier problem might provide some insight into possible methods of solution of the more difficult. In chapter 3, a state-space search method for the solution of generalized 1 ½-dimensional problems where the number of pieces in the order list is fairly small and the dimensions are small integers is described. This method can be developed to solve 2 -dimensional problems in which the order list is fairly small and the size of <b>stock</b> <b>sheets</b> variable but affecting the cost of the material. This development is described in chapter 4. A similarly structured state-space search can be used for finding solutions to optimal network problems. Such searches do not prove the solutions they find to be optimal, so it is of interest also to develop a method for finding solutions to the problems that proves them to be optimal. In chapter 5 the state-space search method is compared with one using branch-and-bound. problems change when large numbers of identical pieces are ordered, so a solution method with a different structure is required. Chapter 6 describes a problem reduction method for generalized 2 -dimensional problems in which the order lists are large and the dimensions are small integers. Even when there are restrictions on the way in which the material may be cut, the presence of other constraints may make a mathematical formulation of the 2 -dimensional trim-loss problem intractable, so again a heuristic solution method may be desirable. In a problem where there are sequencing constraints on the design of successive cutting patterns, problem reduction is again found to provide a useful solution method. This is described in chapter 7. Some conclusions about the efficacy and potential of the methods used are drawn in chapter 8. The remainder of the present chapter is concerned with setting the work described in this thesis in the context of other work on the same and related problems...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this thesis belongs to the subject area of operations research. The study investigates and utilises the solution methodologies known as heuristics and local search for three practical problems related to cutting and packing using irregular shapes and multiple bins. From an application point of view, the problems domains remain in manufacturing, specifically where minimising the resources is required to meet a particular outcome. Many manufacturing processes begin with cutting desired items from a stock sheet of material, hence this study focuses on generating efficient cutting patterns, which is applicable {{in the manufacture of}} furniture, shoes, tools, ships, and garments. First, we consider designing an efficient solution procedure for solving two-dimensional irregular shape single bin size bin packing problem and two-dimensional irregular shape multiple bin size bin packing problem. Our intention is to consider alternative strategies such as placement policies, hole-filling and handling rotation of pieces; particularly with unrestricted rotations. Despite the fact that both problems are widely applicable in sheet cutting, their consideration in the literature is limited. To our knowledge, only a few authors have attempted to incorporate the first problem with the unrestricted rotation of pieces while the second problem with unrestricted rotation has not been considered at all. Being applicable in the real world, both the problems require powerful algorithms to determine the arrangement of irregular pieces on <b>stock</b> <b>sheets</b> in order to minimise the material waste. In this thesis, our focus is on developing algorithms to solve each problem efficiently. These algorithms draw on concepts in computational geometry, computer science as well as operations research. We investigate a set of newly proposed single-pass constructive algorithms that builds a feasible solution by adding pieces sequentially to a packing area defined by a set of bins which can either be homogeneous or heterogeneous. Each problem has a large solution space due to the different combinations of bins and arrangements of irregular pieces. We adopt the optimisation power of local search methods and metaheuristics to find good solutions. As one of the useful heuristic procedures, we use the Jostle heuristic (JS) to solve irregular shape single bin size bin packing problem and irregular shape multiple bin size bin packing problem due to its promising performances in handling both allocation and placement decisions of the pieces together. The Jostle was used in earlier studies for solving irregular strip packing problems and in this study we adopt it first time to solve irregular bin packing problems. Also, our implementation of Jostle handles identifying promising orientation angles of the pieces using the newly proposed angled tuning mechanism when placing pieces. Experimental results reveal that the proposed algorithms can manage different variants of the problem and find solutions with good utilisation of material. For the third problem of this study, we consider multi-period irregular bin packing problem with use of residuals. This allows using leftovers of a certain period which are usable as input stock material for the next periods. Here, we expand the previous work on irregular bin packing algorithms for heterogeneous <b>stock</b> <b>sheets</b> to consider the inventory and production process of sheet cutting. We propose two models to test the impact of a variety of operational policies around the retention and reuse of residual materials in the sheet cutting process. It also examines the cost sensitivity of using residuals with respect to nine practical scenarios within those operational policies. The computational results demonstrate that the proposed multi-period approach with residuals derives better results than solving each order individually for a selected set of operational scenarios and disclose which policy would be more advantageous to operate in each scenario. The results facilitate developing a tool to guide the manufacturers to take effective decisions based on the scenarios applicable to their sheet cutting process...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Computer Science)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. In this study, the {{two-dimensional}} cutting stock problem (2 DCSP) is considered. This is {{a problem}} that occurs in the cutting of a number of smaller rectangular pieces or items from a set of large stock rectangles. It is assumed that the set of large objects is sufficient to accommodate all the small items. A heuristic procedure is developed to solve the two-dimensional single stock-size cutting stock problem (2 DSSSCSP). This is the special case where the large rectangles are all of the same size. The major objective is to minimize waste and the number of <b>stock</b> <b>sheets</b> utilized. The heuristic procedures developed to solve the 2 DSSSCSP are based on the generation of cutting pattern. The Wang algorithm and a specific commercial software package are made use of to generate these patterns. The commercial software was chosen from a set of commercial software packages available in the market. A combinatoric process is applied to generate sets of cutting patterns using the Wang algorithm and the commercial software. The generated cutting patterns are used to formulate an integer linear programming model which is solved using an optimization solver. Empirical experimentation is carried out to test the heuristic procedures using data obtained from both small and real world application problem instances. The results obtained shows that the heuristic procedures developed produce good quality results for both small and real life problem instances. It is quite clear that the heuristic procedure developed to solve the 2 DSSSCSP produces cutting patterns which are acceptable in terms of waste generated and may offer useful alternatives to approaches currently available. Broadly stated, this study involves investigating available software (commercial) in order to assess, formulate and investigate methods to attempt to benchmark software systems and algorithms and to employ ways to enhance solutions obtained by using these software systems.

40|$|A {{technique}} for the fabrication of piezoelectric actuators that generate acceptably large forces and deflections at relatively low applied voltages involves the stacking and diffusion bonding of multiple thin piezoelectric layers coated with film electrodes. The present technique stands {{in contrast to}} an older technique in which the layers are bonded chemically, by use of urethane or epoxy agents. The older chemical-bonding technique entails several disadvantages, including the following: It is difficult to apply the bonding agents to the piezoelectric layers. It is difficult to position the layers accurately and without making mistakes. There {{is a problem of}} disposal of hazardous urethane and epoxy wastes. The urethane and epoxy agents are nonpiezoelectric materials. As such, they contribute to the thickness of a piezoelectric laminate without contributing to its performance; conversely, for a given total thickness, the performance of the laminate is below that of a unitary piezoelectric plate of the same thickness. The figure depicts some aspects of the fabrication of a laminated piezoelectric actuator by the present diffusion- bonding technique. First, <b>stock</b> <b>sheets</b> of the piezoelectric material are inspected and tested. Next, the hole pattern shown in the figure is punched into the sheets. Alternatively, if the piezoelectric material is not a polymer, then the holes are punched in thermoplastic films. Then both faces of each punched piezoelectric sheet or thermoplastic film are coated with a silver-ink electrode material by use of a silkscreen printer. The electrode and hole patterns are designed for minimal complexity and minimal waste of material. After a final electrical test, all the coated piezoelectric layers (or piezoelectric layers and coated thermoplastic films) are stacked in an alignment jig, which, in turn, is placed in a curved press for the diffusion-bonding process. In this process, the stack is pressed and heated at a specified curing temperature and pressure for a specified curing time. The pressure, temperature, and time depend on the piezoelectric material selected. At the end of the diffusion-bonding process, the resulting laminated piezoelectric actuator is tested to verify the adequacy of the mechanical output as a function of an applied DC voltage...|$|E
