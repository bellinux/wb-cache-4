At the same time, the portion of modern NY305 north of Portville in Cattaraugus and Allegany counties was assigned NY94, while the current NY94 in Orange County was designated NY45. The NY305 and NY94 designations were <b>swapped</b> in the early 1940s, placing NY305 on its current alignment and NY94 on what is now NY45. NY94 was then <b>swapped</b> again, this time for NY45, on January 1, 1949, placing both routes on their modern routings.|$|E

5|$|Most of NY37B west of Massena {{ran through}} a low-lying area along the St. Lawrence River. In 1958, {{this area was}} {{permanently}} indundated {{as part of the}} St. Lawrence Seaway's construction. As a result, NY37B was rerouted to follow a new roadway along the fringe of Lake St. Lawrence to meet NY37 in Louisville Corner. A connector between NY37 and NY37B in Louisville was designated as NY131 by 1960. The alignments of NY37B and NY131 west of Massena were <b>swapped</b> , placing NY37B on its modern alignment.|$|E

The alignments of both routes between the two locations were <b>swapped</b> , placing NY12D on its current alignment from Boonville to Potters Corners (in the Town of West Turin) and on NY26 between Potters Corners and Lowville. The overlap between NY12D and NY26 remained in place until the 1970s when NY12D was realigned onto its current routing between Potters Corners and Lyons Falls, replacing then-New York State Route337.|$|E

At the same time, an alternate route of NY52 between Stormville and Towners was assigned the NY216 designation. The alignments of NY52 and NY216 between the two locations were largely <b>swapped</b> in 1937. In 1970, Route216 was truncated to its current eastern terminus in Poughquag.|$|E
50|$|A <b>swap</b> bank is {{a generic}} term to {{describe}} a financial institution that facilitates <b>swaps</b> between counterparties. A <b>swap</b> bank can be an international commercial bank, an investment bank, a merchant bank, or an independent operator. The <b>swap</b> bank serves as either a <b>swap</b> broker or <b>swap</b> dealer. As a broker, the <b>swap</b> bank matches counterparties but does not assume any risk of the <b>swap.</b> The <b>swap</b> broker receives a commission for this service. Today, most <b>swap</b> banks serve as dealers or market makers. As a market marker, the <b>swap</b> bank stands willing to accept {{either side of a}} currency <b>swap,</b> and then later lay it off, or match it with a counterparty. In this capacity, the <b>swap</b> bank assumes a position in the <b>swap</b> and therefore assumes certain risks. The dealer capacity is obviously more risky, and the <b>swap</b> bank would receive a portion of the cash flows passed through it to compensate it for bearing this risk.|$|R
