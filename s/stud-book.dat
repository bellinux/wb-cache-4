During the Great Depression, interest in the breed declined, but made a comeback in the 1950s. The population continued to grow: in 1957, when annual studbooks began to be published, 2881 ponies had been registered; by 2009, the number was more than 34,000.

The room was big and bare. There were a few fine heads of {{antelope}} upon the walls, and beneath them an armory of English-made shotguns and rifles, while a row of silver-mounted riding crops, and some handled with ivory, stood in a corner. All these represented amusement, while two or three treatises on veterinary surgery and agriculture, lying amidst English <b>stud-books</b> and racing records, presumably stood for industry. The comparison was significant, and Graham, the Winnipeg wheat-broker, noticed it as he listened patiently to the views of Colonel Barrington, who nevertheless worked hard enough in his own fashion.

50|$|The Nivernais is an {{endangered}} breed of heavy draught horse from the Nièvre area of central France. It is always black. It stands about 165-175 centimetres at the withers, occasionally up to 180 cm, and weighs 800-1000 kg. The breed {{was created in}} the Nièvre in 1872 by the Comte de Bouillé by crossing black Percheron stallions with local Cheval du Morvan mares. A stud book was opened in 1880, and from that time the breed largely supplanted the Cheval du Morvan.

In 1922, thirty-three horses were sent to Czechoslovakia to establish a herd there which would become the Gurgul line. World War II caused a severe {{decline in the number}} of Hucul horses in Czechoslovakia. After the end of the war, only 300 Hucul horses remained there. Even though a <b>stud-book</b> was established in 1924 in the Huzelei after Michal Holländer encouraged it, it was not until the early 1970s that breeders established an organization, Hucul Club, to prevent the extinction there caused by the declining number.

50|$|The Silesian horse, Polish: Koń śląski, Silesian: Ślůnski kůń, is a {{breed of}} warmblood horse {{from the area}} of {{historic}} Silesia, which lies mostly within modern Poland. It is the heaviest of the Polish warmblood breeds, and has been influenced mainly by the Thoroughbred and Oldenburg, and partly by the East Friesian and German halfbred. The Oldenburg influence was particularly pronounced after World War II, when imported stallions were used to keep the breed from becoming extinct. Two types are recognised in the breed standard, an old and a new. At 3 years old, stallions of the old type stand 160 - 170 cm at the withers, mares about 2 cm less; the girth is 190 - 210 cm, and the cannon-bone circumference about 23-24 cm. The new or racing type is taller and lighter, stallions standing 164 - 170 cm at the withers and mares about 2 cm less; the girth measures 185-200 cm and the cannon-bone 21.5-23 cm. Stallions average 650 kg, mares 600 kg. The current <b>stud-book</b> dates from 1961; registers {{for this type of}} horse have been kept since the late 19th century.

40|$|The mean {{gestation}} {{periods of}} mares belonging to different horse and pony breeds common in The Netherlands have been calculated {{using data from}} the birth registers of five <b>stud-book</b> societies.

The variation in the mean gestation period is greater in horses than in cows, sheep or pigs. Colts are carried a little longer than fillies. Differences between years are not significant, but differences between the various breeds have been determined. Shetland foals born before 1 June are carried longer than those born after 1 June. The gestation period for mares of this breed mated at 2 years, is significantly longer than for those mated at more than 2 years. The length of the gestation period in horses is possibly affected by physiological factors other than those influencing the gestation period in some other farm animals...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{accuracy}} of judging age from teeth, with standard aging guides, of mares from 2 to 20 years old registered in the Belgian draft horse <b>stud-book.</b> The replacement of the deciduous incisors by permanent teeth occurred when expected as the disappearance of the infundibulum on the permanent lower intermediate incisors. The disappearance of the infundibulum was however observed until 16 months earlier than expected on the central incisors and until 18 months later on the corner incisors with 64 % and 50 % of the concerned mares respectively. The modifications of the shape of the occlusal tables from oval to round occurred from 1 to 4 years earlier than expected. The risk to attribute an older age than the true age during the so called round period is lower when taking into account the disappearance of the cup cement leaving only an enamel spot on the occlusal table surface. The modifications of the shape of the incisor tables from round to triangular and to biangular was also observed earlier than expected but only with the central and intermediate incisors, not with the corner incisors. The measurement on photographs of the profile angle of the corner incisors confirmed that this angle decreases with age from about 134 degrees at about 5 years to about 72 degrees at 20 years. Statistical analyses of the differences between real ages and those estimated on pictures by a college of three experts, show that ageing horses from their dentition is more accurate for animals of 8 years old or less, than for older ones. For those animals, the overestimation was about 10 % of the real age. Peer reviewe...|$|E
