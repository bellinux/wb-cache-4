5|$|When the Southern Pawnees {{arrived in}} Nebraska, the Skidis were not pleased to <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> lands that they {{regarded}} as their own. Nevertheless, {{they were willing}} to accept them as neighbors, so long as they kept to {{the south side of the}} Platte. However, the Chaui leaders demanded that they be recognized as the heads of the entire Pawnee people, above the Skidi chiefs. They defied the Skidis by sending a large hunting party to Prairie Creek, on the north side of the Platte within sight of the Skidi villages on the Loup. The Skidis responded by attacking the Chaui hunters and driving them back across the Platte. The Chauis and Pitahawiratas resolved on war, and summoned the Kitkehahki fighters to join them against the Skidis; the Kitkehahkis, unwilling to leave their people unprotected against Skidi raids, left the Republican and moved to the Platte near the other bands.|$|E
5|$|As the {{bombardment}} {{of the city}} proved to be unsuccessful, Montgomery then began to plan for an assault. Montgomery was to assault the Lower Town district, {{the part of the}} city near the river shore, while Arnold was to attack and take the Cape Diamond Bastion, a strong part of the city walls on the highest point of the rocky promontory. Montgomery believed that they should attack during a stormy night, therefore the British {{would not be able to}} <b>see</b> <b>them.</b> <b>On</b> December 27, the weather became stormy, and Montgomery ordered that the men prepare to attack. However, the storm soon subsided and Montgomery called off the attack. As Montgomery waited for a storm, he was forced to revise his plans, because a deserter communicated the original plan to the defenders. In the new plan, Montgomery would attack the Lower Town from the south and Arnold would attack the Lower Town from the north. After breaking through the walls, Montgomery and Arnold would meet up in the city and then attack and take the Upper Town, causing resistance to collapse. To increase their chance of surprise, Montgomery planned two feints. One detachment of troops (the 1st Canadian Regiment under James Livingston) would set fire to one of the gates while another (under the command of Jacob Brown) would engage the guard at Cape Diamond Bastion and fire rockets to signal the start of the attack. While the feints were conducted, artillery would fire into the city. Although Montgomery was reluctant to attack, enlistments for Arnold's men were expiring on January 1, and he was concerned about losing their services.|$|E

500|$|When Vaughan first pitched [...] "Pride & Joy" [...] to Marvel, they {{immediately}} accepted it and set Runaways in the Marvel Universe, the main string of story lines that ties Marvel's canonical series. However, unlike most series (which are often set in New York City), Runaways {{is set in}} Los Angeles, an unexplored area of the Marvel Universe. This, in turn, marked a significance for the story arc at the time; being a new series, [...] "Pride & Joy" [...] had been expected {{to take place in}} New York City. Matt Fraction, a prominent writer for various Marvel Comics series quotes, [...] "It was sort of great to see in Runaways that California was such a blank slate. It was refreshing to watch Brian create this sort of whole cloth." [...] Vaughan's decision prompted Fraction to create a new series to take place in Los Angeles as well. Several notable landmarks in this story arc include Malibu, the Griffith Observatory, the James Dean memorial and Bronson Canyon in Griffith Park. In an interview with Comic Book Resources, Brian K. Vaughan quoted, [...] "I imagine that Angelinos in the Marvel Universe think of super heroes and villains the way that New Yorkers think of Hollywood celebrities.

500|$|Coke {{also brought}} {{up the issue of}} hunting game. During the late 18th century a series of laws were passed {{protecting}} a landowner's right to hunt, and giving severe penalties to poachers. On 27 February Coke, an enthusiastic hunter, suggested in Parliament that these laws be relaxed; [...] "Combinations had been formed in the Country against the execution of these laws and some lives had been lost". Before any motion could be brought (it was not until 1827 that the laws were revised), the situation in America came up again. On 22 February, Henry Seymour Conway brought a motion asking the King to [...] "listen to the humble prayer and advice of his faithful Commons, that the war on the continent of North America may no longer be pursued for the impractical purpose of reducing the inhabitants of that country to obedience by force". While the motion failed, it was again brought on 27 February, and passed. With this, Conway moved that [...] "An humble address be presented to His Majesty"; George III replied that he would <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> 3 March at St James's Palace. It was then that [...] "the most important and symbolic act of Coke's political career" [...] occurred. As a Knight of the Shire, Coke had the right to appear in court dressed [...] "in his boots" [...] as opposed to in formal court dress; this he did, appearing in front of George III dressed in leather breeches, boots and spurs.|$|E
500|$|On 5 October 1936 a {{selected}} group of 200 {{set out from}} Jarrow Town Hall on the 282-mile march, aiming to reach London by 30 October {{for the start of}} the new session of parliament. Wilkinson did not march all the way, but joined whenever her various commitments allowed. At that year's Labour Party conference, held in Edinburgh, she hoped to rouse enthusiasm but instead heard herself condemned for [...] "sending hungry and ill-clad men across the country". This negative attitude was mirrored by some of the local parties on the route of the march; in such areas, Wilkinson recorded with irony, the Conservatives and Liberals saw to the marchers' needs. On 31 October the marchers reached London, but Baldwin refused to <b>see</b> <b>them.</b> <b>On</b> 4 November, Wilkinson presented the town's petition to the House of Commons. Signed by 11,000 citizens of Jarrow, it concluded: [...] "The town cannot be left derelict, and therefore your Petitioners humbly pray that His Majesty's Government and this honourable House should realise the urgent need that work should be provided for the town without further delay." [...] In the brief discussion that followed, Runciman opined that [...] "the unemployment position at Jarrow, while still far from satisfactory, has improved during recent months". [...] In reply a Labour backbencher commented that [...] "the Government's complacency is regarded throughout the country as an affront to the national conscience".|$|E
500|$|Girls' Generation's {{image has}} often been {{regarded}} as [...] "innocent", and their performances onstage are described as [...] "youthful" [...] and [...] "colorful;" [...] Ceejay Lee from Fem commented that Girls' Generation's outfits often reveal legs rather than [...] "cleavages or derrieres." [...] Eun-Young Jung in the book The Korean Wave opined that the group's concepts fall into two main categories—"innocent, cutesy, happy" [...] (early singles [...] "Gee", [...] "Genie", [...] "Oh!") and [...] "more mature, yet not overly sexy, feminine" [...] (later singles [...] "Run Devil Run" [...] and [...] "Hoot"). A writer for the Korean Culture and Information Service deemed the group's image as [...] "sexy" [...] and [...] "girly" [...] "goddesses {{that are hard to}} approach." [...] John Seabrook from The New Yorker described Girls' Generation as [...] "a group of preppy-looking young women in skinny trousers. When they wear hot pants, it's to display the gams, not the glutes." [...] New York Magazine stated: [...] "according to label executives and fans, [...] appeal is not their music, which is catchy but derivative. Instead, the [...] a humility that gives their fans the illusion that 'when you <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> stage it's like they've come to see you.'

500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1834, Chopin {{attended}} the Lower Rhenish Music Festival in Aix-la-Chapelle with Hiller, {{and it was there}} that Chopin met Felix Mendelssohn. After the festival, the three visited Düsseldorf, where Mendelssohn had been appointed musical director. They spent what Mendelssohn described as [...] "a very agreeable day", playing and discussing music at his piano, and met Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow, director of the Academy of Art, and some of his eminent pupils such as Lessing, Bendemann, Hildebrandt and Sohn. In 1835 Chopin went to Carlsbad, where he spent time with his parents; {{it was the last time}} he would <b>see</b> <b>them.</b> <b>On</b> his way back to Paris, he met old friends from Warsaw, the Wodzińskis. He had made the acquaintance of their daughter Maria in Poland five years earlier, when she was eleven. This meeting prompted him to stay for two weeks in Dresden, when he had previously intended to return to Paris via Leipzig. The sixteen-year-old girl's portrait of the composer is considered, along with Delacroix's, as among Chopin's best likenesses. In October he finally reached Leipzig, where he met Schumann, Clara Wieck and Mendelssohn, who organised for him a performance of his own oratorio St. Paul, and who considered him [...] "a perfect musician". In July 1836 Chopin travelled to Marienbad and Dresden to be with the Wodziński family, and in September he proposed to Maria, whose mother Countess Wodzińska approved in principle. Chopin went on to Leipzig, where he presented Schumann with his G minor Ballade. At the end of 1836 he sent Maria an album in which his sister Ludwika had inscribed seven of his songs, and his 1835 Nocturne in C-sharp minor, Op. 27, No. 1. The anodyne thanks he received from Maria proved to be the last letter he was to have from her.|$|E

2500|$|On 23 December, losing patience, {{the leaders}} of the {{division}} went to the Reichskanzlei (Chancellery). By that point, the government, the six-man [...] "Council of People's Deputies" [...] that had been in office since 10 November, {{was on the verge of}} breaking apart with increasing differences emerging between its USPD and SPD members. The Volksmarinedivision encountered support from the former but mostly hostility from the latter. The soldiers were ordered to hand over the keys to the Schloss and left. In the afternoon the soldiers' leaders returned, with the keys but also with a group of armed troops that took position in front of the building. According to historian Sebastian Haffner what happened then was as follows: The soldiers' leaders under one Lieutenant Heinrich Dorrenbach gave the keys to Emil Barth, a People's Deputy of the USPD. Barth called Wels and told him that he had received the keys and asked him to hand over the outstanding pay. Wels refused, arguing that he only took orders from Friedrich Ebert who was joint chairman of the [...] "Council of People's Deputies" [...] and had also been handed the authority of government by the last Imperial Chancellor, Maximilian of Baden. When Barth sent the soldiers to Ebert, Ebert refused to <b>see</b> <b>them.</b> <b>On</b> Dorrenbach's orders the troops now closed all access to the Reichskanzlei, occupied the room with the telephone switchboard and cut the lines. The Volksbeauftragten were thus under house arrest.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, few zoos had primate {{exhibits}} {{so there was}} popular demand to <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> film. At {{the turn of the}} 20th century, the Lumière Brothers sent film documentarians to places westerners had never seen, and Georges Méliès utilized trick photography in film fantasies that prefigured that in King Kong. Jungle films were launched in the United States in 1913 with Beasts in the Jungle, a film that mixed live actors with lions, a tiger, and other animals. The film's popularity spawned similar pictures, including a few about [...] "ape men" [...] and gorillas. In 1918, Elmo Lincoln starred in Tarzan of the Apes, and, in 1925, The Lost World made movie history with special effects by Willis O'Brien and a crew that later would work on King Kong. William S. Campbell specialized in monkey-themed films with Monkey Stuff and Jazz Monkey in 1919, with Prohibition Monkey following in 1920. King Kong producer Ernest B. Schoedsack had earlier monkey experience directing [...] in 1927 (also with Merian C. Cooper) and Rango in 1931, both of which prominently featured monkeys in authentic jungle settings. Capitalizing on this trend, Congo Pictures released the hoax documentary Ingagi in 1930, advertising the film as [...] "an authentic incontestable celluloid document showing the sacrifice of a living woman to mammoth gorillas." [...] Ingagi was an unabashed black exploitation film, immediately running afoul of the Hollywood code of ethics, as it implicitly depicted black women having sex with gorillas, and baby offspring that looked more ape than human. The film was an immediate hit, and by some estimates {{it was one of the}} highest-grossing movies of the 1930s at over $4 million. Although Cooper never listed Ingagi among his influences for King Kong, it has long been held that RKO green-lit Kong because of the bottom-line example of Ingagi and the formula that [...] "gorillas plus sexy women in peril equals enormous profits".|$|E
