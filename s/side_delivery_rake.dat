50|$|Later, a {{mechanically}} {{more complicated}} rake was developed, {{known as the}} <b>side</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>rake.</b> This usually had a gear-driven or chain-driven reel mounted roughly at a 45-degree angle to the windrow, so the hay was gathered and pushed {{to one side of}} the rake as it moved across the field. A <b>side</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>rake</b> could be pulled longitudinally along the windrow by horses or a tractor, eliminating the laborious and inefficient process of raising, lowering, and back-and-forth raking required by a dump rake. This allowed for the continuous spiraling windrows of a classic mid-20th-century farm hayfield. Later versions of the <b>side</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>rake</b> used a more severe transverse angle and a higher frame system, but the basic principles of operation were the same.|$|E

40|$|Dry bulk {{shipping}} is unique {{due to its}} near “perfect-competition” market characteristics. To complicate matters further, {{there is a significant}} supply <b>side</b> <b>delivery</b> delay in case of unexpected demand changes. Both of these factors contribute to the high volatility inherent in the sector. This paper aims to test whether dry {{bulk shipping}} exhibits irrationality in the pricing of second-hand vessels using data from 1977 - 2014. Two distinct valuation models are employed for identifying the intrinsic value of bulkers and compare these to the market price of the vessels. The purpose of the paper is to test for the presence of irrational investment behavior during the last three decades in the dry bulk space. Equally important is testing whether intrinsic value measures introduced are able to predict investment returns. Findings reject the presence of irrational investment behavior in the overall sector. Nevertheless, the intrinsic value models are able to rank subsequent investor returns depending on the level of under- / overvaluation. Through applying fundamental valuation in the dry bulk sector, this research provides worthy tools for decision-makers to achieve superior returns on investment. nhhma...|$|R

40|$|Little {{information}} is known {{on the effect}} of different types of balers on forage quality. A trial was conducted during the summer of 1999 to evaluate the forage quality of alfalfa hay baled with five different balers [a one-ton baler, two mid-sized balers, and two 3 -tie balers (a <b>side</b> <b>delivery</b> baler and a center delivery baler) ]. The alfalfa was baled under two moisture regimes: favorable moisture conditions and dry conditions. With the conditions and methods used in this study {{there was no difference in}} forage quality of alfalfa baled with the different balers. A second trial was conducted to document the variability in forage quality that occurs in 1 -ton bales to help develop a sampling protocol. Results indicated more variation in forage quality within individual bales than between bales. There was no significant difference whether the front-end, middle, or butt-end was sampled so sampling the bale ends should be sufficient. The interaction between the position on the bale (i. e. the center vs. the edges) and the moisture under which the hay was baled was found to be important. These preliminary. results suggest that it may be preferable to sample a few different positions on the end of several bales than to sample just the center ofa high number of bales. Because of degree of variability observed in single cores, we recommend a minimum of 20 cores be used until more results are available...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The use of endoluminal self-expanding {{metallic}} stents is {{an effective}} alternative to surgery in neoplastic gastrointestinal tract obstructions. It {{is often difficult to}} mark the proximal segment of the stricture under fluoroscopic guidance (due to patient movements or change of markers' position). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We placed Ultraflex precision colonic stent (Microvasive, Boston Scientific) in ten patients with neoplastic stricture of the rectosigmoid colon. Before placement of the delivery catheter, a radiopaque proximal marker was identified on the delivery catheter under fluoroscopic guidance. The external <b>side</b> of the <b>delivery</b> catheter was coloured (in correspondence with the radiopaque marker) with non toxic colour. After the introduction of the delivery catheter, we placed the proximal coloured marker just above the distal tumour margin under endoscopic guidance. RESULTS: The procedure was successful in relieving the obstruction in all patients, without mortality or complications. In all patients the coloured marker was identified and the stent correctly placed. CONCLUSION: The location of a coloured marker in the external <b>side</b> of the <b>delivery</b> catheter permits an accurate and correct placement of the stent, without unnecessary exposure to X-rays...|$|R

40|$|Two {{important}} instabilities {{associated with}} carrier layer formation on the inclined plane of slide-fed coating processes are explored, with a two liquid layer prototype configuration employed {{to mimic the}} slide-bead process as used by industry. The work relates to both slide-bead and curtain coating methods. Experiments first reveal how broad diffuse bands, that destroy {{the quality of the}} final coating, are formed as the carrier layer flow rate is reduced. The bands are found to be exacerbated by either decreasing the viscosity or flow rate of the carrier layer or by increasing the viscosity of the upper layer. As the flow rate of the carrier layer is reduced further, the upper layer begins to invade the carrier layer delivery slot. Flow visualisations reveal that a parallel <b>sided</b> <b>delivery</b> slot is superior to a chamfered one in terms of robustness against invasion of the interface and that reducing the slot width increases robustness further. Experiments and complementary numerical simulations confirm the existence of a recirculating eddy {{near the top of the}} downstream wall as the carrier layer flow rate is reduced and this insight is used to propose an instability mechanism for the onset of the bands. Further experiments expose the mechanism for the formation of cross bars. These can develop downstream of the carrier layer delivery slot and arise because the merging of the layers there becomes increasingly influenced by the flow, demonstrating that the sensitivity of cross bars to pump induced disturbances grows rapidly as the critical carrier layer flow rate for instability is approached and then collapses as the flow rate is reduced to a value where the layer is no longer effective in lubricating the flow of adjacent layers...|$|R

This national ICT and radio consultation workshop brought together 28 participants representing government MDAs, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), UN agencies, academic and research institutions, farmer based organizations, and telecom operators to brainstorm best options to streamline delivering tailored climate information to end users. The two-day workshop was held in Dar es Salaam on 27 - 28, April 2015. The workshop began with {{a brief overview of}} the objectives, methodology, and key recommendations from each study. This was followed by a summary of important findings, and then a question-and-answer session in which participants agreed with the key recommendations and overall findings. Participants were introduced to a draft information flow model that includes three important components: production, delivery and feedback. The plenary session gave participants room to share feedback from discussion groups. Final consensus was built on the role of each stakeholder and type of intervention needed {{on the ground in the}} short- and longer terms to enhance the delivery of climate information services for farmers and pastoralists in Tanzania.

40|$|The {{public sector}} is the {{dominant}} financier {{of health care in}} most OECD countries.

The paper starts with a brief overview of the current position. It then examines the case and evidence on the finance side, and then the case and evidence on the <b>delivery</b> <b>side.</b> The evidence used is drawn primarily from the experience of OECD countries other than the USA, both because the American experience is better known and because the USA is an outlier in terms of the level of private finance and delivery within this group of countries.
