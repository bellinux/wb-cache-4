40|$|Many {{cellular}} stress-responsive signaling systems exhibit highly dynamic {{behavior with}} oscillatory features mediated by delayed negative feedback loops. What remains unclear is whether oscillatory behavior {{is the basis}} for a <b>signaling</b> <b>code</b> based on frequency modulation (FM) or whether the negative feedback control modules have evolved to fulfill other functional requirements. Here, we use experimentally calibrated computational models to interrogate the negative feedback loops that regulate the dynamic activity of the transcription factor NF-kB. Linear stability analysis of the model shows that oscillatory frequency is a hard-wired feature of the primary negative feedback loop and not a function of the stimulus, thus arguing against an FM <b>signaling</b> <b>code.</b> Instead, our modeling studies suggest that the two feedback loops may be tuned to provide for rapid activation and inactivation capabilities for transient input signals {{of a wide range of}} durations; by minimizing late phase oscillations response durations may be fine-tuned in a graded rather than quantized manner.

Using the NFκB signaling module as a test bed, we identified perturbations that selectively affect the response to cytokines or pathogen components. Together, our results demonstrate that the dynamics of signaling may serve as a pharmacological target, and we reveal principles that delineate the opportunities and constraints of developing stimulus-specific therapeutic agents aimed at pleiotropic signaling hubs...|$|E

40|$|SummaryPrevious studies {{suggested}} that postsynaptic neuroligins form a trans-synaptic complex with presynaptic β-neurexins, {{but not with}} presynaptic α-neurexins. Unexpectedly, we now find that neuroligins also bind α-neurexins and that α- and β-neurexin binding by neuroligin 1 is regulated by alternative splicing of neuroligin 1 (at splice site B) and of neurexins (at splice site 4). In neuroligin 1, splice site B is a master switch that determines α-neurexin binding but leaves β-neurexin binding largely unaffected, whereas alternative splicing of neurexins modulates neuroligin binding. Moreover, neuroligin 1 splice variants with distinct neurexin binding properties differentially regulate synaptogenesis: neuroligin 1 that binds only β-neurexins potently stimulates synapse formation, whereas neuroligin 1 that binds to both α- and β-neurexins more effectively promotes synapse expansion. These findings suggest that neuroligin binding to α- and β-neurexins mediates trans-synaptic cell adhesion but has distinct effects on synapse formation, indicating that expression of different neuroligin and neurexin isoforms specifies a trans-synaptic <b>signaling</b> <b>code...</b>|$|E
40|$|SummaryNeurexins and neuroligins play an {{essential}} role in synapse function, and their alterations are linked to autistic spectrum disorder. Interactions between neurexins and neuroligins regulate inhibitory and excitatory synaptogenesis in vitro through a “splice-insert <b>signaling</b> <b>code.</b> ” In particular, neurexin 1 β carrying an alternative splice insert at site SS# 4 interacts with neuroligin 2 (found predominantly at inhibitory synapses) but much less so with other neuroligins (those carrying an insert at site B and prevalent at excitatory synapses). The structure of neurexin 1 β+SS# 4 reveals dramatic rearrangements to the “hypervariable surface,” the binding site for neuroligins. The splice insert protrudes as a long helix into space, triggers conversion of loop β 10 -β 11 into a helix rearranging the binding site for neuroligins, and rearranges the Ca 2 +-binding site required for ligand binding, increasing its affinity. Our structures reveal the mechanism by which neurexin 1 β isoforms acquire neuroligin splice isoform selectivity...|$|E
40|$|A {{prominent}} {{feature of}} signaling in cortical neurons {{is that of}} randomness in the action potential. The output of a typical pyramidal cell can be well fit with a Poisson model, and variations in the Poisson rate repeatedly {{have been shown to}} be correlated with stimuli. However while the rate provides a very useful characterization of neural spike data, it may not be the most fundamental description of the <b>signaling</b> <b>code.</b> Recent data showing g frequency range multi-cell action potential correlations, together with spike timing dependent plasticity, are spurring a re-examination of the classical model, since precise timing codes imply that the generation of spikes is essentially deterministic. Could the observed Poisson randomness and timing determinism reflect two separate modes of communication, or do they somehow derive from a single process? We investigate in a timing-based model whether the apparent incompatibility between these probabilistic and deterministic observations may be resolved by examining how spikes could be used in the underlying neural circuits. The crucial component of this model draws on dual roles for spike signaling. In learning receptive fields from ensembles of inputs, spikes need to behave probabilistically, whereas for fast signaling of individual stimuli, the spikes need to behave deterministically.

40|$|Commutation {{signaling}} is an anti-multipath {{modulation technique}} that employs bandwidth spreading to overcome multipath induced intersymbol interference. In this work, a wireless communication system using differential binary phase shift keyed commutation signaling {{has been considered}} for a two-wave Rayleigh fading channel. Commutation <b>signaling</b> <b>code</b> parameters that characterize the system performance (average and worst case) are revealed and codebooks have been constructed based on these parameters. For binary codebooks constructed based on average performance, the maximum probability of error may be very large at certain inter-wave delays. On the other hand, binary and four phase codebooks constructed based on the worst case performance not only ensure an acceptable maximum probability of error, but also give very good average performance. Normally, systems using codebooks that require more bandwidth expansion have better anti-multipath capability. It is also found that with the same bandwidth expansion, the anti-multipath capability is increased by using four phase codebooks instead of binary codebooks. For a performance degradation of about 3 dB with respect to ideal two-fold diversity, four phase codebooks of length 4 {{can be used for}} inter-wave delays of up to nearly three times the symbol duration, while codebooks of length 8 can cope with delays as large as nearly sixteen times the symbol duration...|$|E

This report is produced in partial fulfillment of the requirements of a Master’s of Science in Fire Protection Engineering from the Fire Protection Engineering Program at California Polytechnic State University’s San Luis Obispo Campus. This analysis approaches life safety in the fitness center from two angles. First, a prescriptive approach is {{used to evaluate the}} building’s compliance with current codes and standards that govern construction and maintenance of federal facilities. Four major areas are evaluated prescriptively. Each area is represented by a core code or standard against which the building is measured. Structural fire protection systems are evaluated first. Standards for structural fire protection are codified in the International Building Code and other various standards. Next, life safety is evaluated using NFPA 101 – Life Safety Code as the standard.

The prescriptive analysis of the building {{will focus on the}} structural fire protection, egress, fire suppression, fire alarm and detection systems to determine if the meet current codes and standards. The performance based analysis will discuss certain methods and design fire scenarios that can be present within the building and the buildings ability to protect occupants until they can exit safely. The purpose of this report is to determine if the selected building is compliant with current and up to date codes and standards by analyzing the fire protection systems used. The fire protection systems analyzed for this report are the structural fire protection, egress, fire suppression, fire alarm and detection systems. Each system was analyzed using the applicable codes below: International Building Code (IBC) 2015, NFPA 101 Life Safety Code (LSC) 2015, NFPA 13 Standard for Installation of Sprinkler Systems 2013, NFPA 72 National Fire Alarm and <b>Signaling</b> <b>Code</b> 2013, NFPA 25 Standard for the Inspection, Testing, and Maintenance of Water based Fire Protection Systems, and SFPE Handbook of Fire Protection Engineering 4 th 2 ̆ 6 5 th Edition. It was determine that Warren J Baker Center for Science and Mathematics structural fire protection, egress, fire suppression system, and fire alarm and detection systems complied with all applicable codes and standards. The performance based analysis. This analysis covers typical fire scenarios present in this building and analysis of the atrium. Each section is a summary of the results and assumptions used to evaluate the building. This includes the recommendations and conclusions determined by this analysis. The performance based sections are listed below. Fire Scenario Selections in Atrium: The primary objective is to meet specific tenability criteria to limit exposures to occupants. (NFPA 101 LSC 2015 Chapter 5) There are methods used to evaluate and limit untenable conditions that occupants may be exposed too. The method used to evaluate was method 1 where the design team can set detailed performance criteria to ensure that occupants are not incapacitated by fire effects. This design fire 1 is based on scenario 6 from the LSC 2015. The fire is located on the second floor in a seating area within the atrium. The area is fully sprinkled and is the largest fuel area that would affect the most floors if there was a fire. The fire will become sprinkler controlled {{at some point during the}} fire and there will be activation of the smoke management system. This design fire is based on scenario 8 from the LSC 2015. The fire is located on the second floor in the atrium opening. This fire will not be sprinkler controlled but activation of the smoke management system will occur. The fire detection system will activate but there will be no suppression of the fire. The results from both scenarios indicated that all tenable conditions were maintain for the time limit of 600 seconds except for visibility. The visibility requirement of 10 meters was lost about 170 seconds within both fire scenarios and were well below the RSET value discussed later in this report. A recommendation was made to replace the passive naturally ventilated smoke management system with a mechanical smoke management system to help with exhausting smoke within the atrium and maintaining the visibility for a longer period. The other recommendation was to implement a phased evacuation plan for the building. The phased evacuation would use the horizontal exits within the building to compartmentalize the wings and atrium from one another. Then using the voice communication system in the building to coordinate and direct occupants on whether they should stay in place and who should evacuate. These performance based sections using current codes and standards listed below: International Building Code (IBC) 2015, NFPA 101 Life Safety Code Handbook (LSC) 2015, NFPA 72 National Fire Alarm and <b>Signaling</b> <b>Code</b> 2013, and SFPE Handbook of Fire Protection Engineering, 5 th edition...|$|E

More than 300 congregations throughout Georgia and the Carolinas will use the Assembly Hall for their semi-annual assemblies and conventions, with an estimated annual attendance of 190, 000 per year. Prescriptive analyses were conducted based primarily upon the provisions of the 2009 International Building Code (IBC), International Fire Code (IFC), and the 2009 edition of the National Fire Protection Association standard, NFPA 101, Life Safety Code. Where required by the referenced building and fire codes, other NFPA codes and standards such as the 2010 editions of NFPA 13, Automatic Sprinkler Systems Handbook and NFPA 72, National Fire Alarm and <b>Signaling</b> <b>Code</b> were also referenced. Fire protection system analysis included reviewing and establishing a safe means of egress system, fire detection, alarm and notification system, water-based fire suppression system, smoke management system and structural fire protection. Results are provided with respect to each. The performance-based analyses focused primarily upon the ability of occupants to safely escape the building after the onset of various fire events by creating a tenable environment in concert with a smoke management system. The computer fire model, “Fire Dynamics Simulator” (FDS) version 6 produced by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), was used to estimate the available safe egress time (ASET) of occupants under applicable fire scenarios. The required time needed for safe egress (RSET) was determined based upon calculation methods set forth in the Society of Fire Protection Engineering (SFPE), Handbook of Fire Protection Engineering (HBFPE) in conjunction with a computer egress model, “Pathfinder” version 2011 produced by Thunderhead Engineering.

40|$|As {{part of the}} {{requirements}} for the Degree of Masters of Science in Fire Protection Engineering from California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, a prescriptive and performance based design analysis was conducted for the Bonderson Engineering Projects Center building (Cal Poly campus). The purpose of this analysis was to review the Bonderson Engineering Projects Center’s compliance with applicable and recognized fire and building codes with regards to its fire protection systems and features. The fire protection systems and features analyzed in this report include: 1) Egress Systems, 2) Structural Fire Protection, 3) Fire Detection and Alarm Systems, 4) Fire Suppression Systems. Prescriptive analysis of the Bonderson Engineering Projects Center was performed {{in order to determine}} if the building adhered to standards set forth within applicable standards and codes. Analysis was based primarily upon both the International Building Code 2009 Edition and NFPA 101 : Life Safety Code 2012 Edition. Where required, other NFPA codes and standards were utilized, including the 2010 Editions of NFPA 13 : Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems and NFPA 72 : National Fire Alarm and <b>Signaling</b> <b>Code.</b> The egress systems in the building largely met prescriptive code requirements except for a few issues related to room 104 and its change in occupancy use (door swing direction, locks without panic hardware, etc). The structural system is a Type II-B classification and was found to meet prescriptive code requirements. Some shortcomings with the detection and alarm systems were discovered during the analysis, mainly with respect to spacing gaps. Several visible notification devices on the second floor did not meet prescriptive code due to gaps in required coverage. Additionally, it was determined that detailed measurements of the average ambient sound level should be taken in order to better analyze the audible notification systems. Lastly, the sprinkler system was found to meet prescriptive code requirements, both for water demand and bracing. Performance based design analysis was performed in order to gain understanding on the ability of the building to safely egress occupants during various fire scenarios when built to the prescriptive approaches set forth in the codes and standards. This performance based design analysis was based upon standards set forth in Chapter 5 of the Life Safety Code. Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) and Pathfinder computer simulators were utilized to carry out the performance based design.
