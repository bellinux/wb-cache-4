25|$|In Singapore, {{the sources}} of {{constitutional}} law may be grouped into two categories: those that are legally binding {{and those that are}} not. Legally binding sources include the text of the Constitution, judicial interpretations of the Constitution, and other statutes. Non-binding sources are influences on constitutional law such as <b>soft</b> <b>law,</b> constitutional conventions, and public international law.|$|E

Forms of <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> include non-binding instruments containing recommendations, government white papers, declarations, and informal rules like circulars or self-regulating codes of conduct.

This article intends to point out that such a development is inevitable as international treaties and <b>soft</b> <b>laws</b> mandate a shift to a contextual approach.

2500|$|Corporate social {{responsibility}} (CSR, also called corporate conscience, corporate citizenship or responsible business) {{is a form}} of corporate self-regulation integrated into a business model. CSR policy functions as a self-regulatory mechanism whereby a business monitors and ensures its active compliance with the spirit of the law, ethical standards and national or international norms. With some models, a firm's implementation of CSR goes beyond compliance and statutory requirements, which engages in [...] "actions that appear to further some social good, beyond the interests of the firm and that which is required by law". The binary choice between 'complying' with the law and 'going beyond' the law must be qualified with some nuance. In many areas such as environmental or labor regulations, employers can choose to comply with the law, to go beyond the law, but they can also choose to not comply with the law, such as when they deliberately ignore gender equality or the mandate to hire disabled workers. There must be a recognition that many so-called 'hard' laws are also 'weak' laws, weak {{in the sense that they}} are poorly enforced, with no or little control or no or few sanctions in case of non-compliance. 'Weak' law must not be confused with <b>soft</b> <b>law.</b> The aim is to increase long-term profits and shareholder trust through positive public relations and high ethical standards to reduce business and legal risk by taking responsibility for corporate actions. CSR strategies encourage the company to make a positive impact on the environment and stakeholders including consumers, employees, investors, communities, and others.|$|E

Another key point is that negotiating parties are not blind to the potential lying in stealth in <b>soft</b> <b>law.</b> If a negotiating party feels that <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> has a potential to turn into something binding down the track, this will negatively influence the negotiation process, and <b>soft</b> <b>law</b> instruments will be watered down and hemmed in by so many restrictions {{that there is little}} point in creating them.|$|E

The liquidation of distressed companies entails social costs, which lenders and managers {{do not fully}} inter-nalize. To mitigate this problem, bankruptcy laws in France and the US (in contrast with the UK or Germany) favor reorganization. The corresponding expropriation risk faced by creditors worsens credit rationing, espe-cially if bankruptcy judges are corrupt. Consequently tough bankruptcy laws, involving strict enforcement of debt contracts, can be socially optimal. <b>Soft</b> <b>laws</b> are likely to emerge, however, when the majority of citizens are so poor they would be credit rationed even under a tough bankruptcy law.

As applied to intellectual property, particularly in the international context, governance literature is emerging but still episodic. This article examines the World Intellectual Property Organization’s Development Agenda, currently being implemented through its Committee on Development and Intellectual Property.

They have produced so little concrete change due to the voluntary nature of the agreements, the difficulty in monitoring and the lack of follow up regarding compliance. [...] However, they have produced important and authoritative ‘soft laws’, the halfway stage on the road to legally binding frameworks. There is the strong expectation of nations adhering to <b>soft</b> <b>laws</b> and that they will become ‘harder’ in the short or long term, more precise and more legally binding. For example, many principles agreed upon at the Stockholm conference now form the basis of national, regional and EU laws.

40|$|In the {{international}} context, {{human rights are}} rarely secured by the black letter of law, but rather by the <b>soft</b> <b>laws,</b> political policies and moral prescriptions of protection norms. Two key international protection norms are the well-established Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflict (PoC) and - recently added {{in the last decade}} - the Responsibility to Protect (RtoP). Yet there is substantial confusion about the specific nature of these two norms, their relationship to one another, and their relationship to the human rights that are held to ground and shape each of them. These questions are complex not merely because there are several distinct PoC norms, nor because all these norms differ one from another. The complexity arises because the relevant differences apply to separate dimensions of each norm. In this way it is possible for a norm to be in one sense narrower than another, yet in another sense to be deeper, and in distinct further senses to be both broader and weaker. With such intricacies in mind, this paper develops a five-dimensional rights-based analysis of norms and uses it to differentiate RtoP from three separate PoC norms, and to illustrate the distinct ways each protection norm provides multi-layered rights protection.

40|$|Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: Prior {{studies have}} failed to {{unequivocally}} establish {{a positive relationship between}} corporate-governance ratings and company performance, although theoretically, we would expect to find one. In this paper, we try to establish whether a positive relationship exists through modeling the relationship more carefully. Research Findings/Insights: After controlling for selection bias and endogeneity simultaneously, we find a significant positive relationship between corporate-governance ratings and performance. However, the strength of this relationship seems to depend {{on the quality of the}} institutional environment. Finally, we find that improvements in corporate-governance ratings over time result in decreasing marginal benefits in terms of performance. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our paper contributes to the literature by showing that improved corporate-governance ratings lead to better performance, but that econometric problems might obscure this relationship. We also show that for a sample of developed countries the institutional environment affects the relationship between governance ratings and performance. Finally, this paper contributes to the literature on the impact, regarding compliance and effectiveness, of codes of good governance. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our results are relevant for both companies and policy makers. They indicate that companies can improve performance by adhering to good corporate-governance practices. For policy makers, the findings suggest that <b>soft</b> <b>laws</b> and the invisible hand of the market lead to companies improving their corporate governance...|$|R
40|$|As {{a result}} of the key roles {{financial}} institutions play in the world today, they are pivotal in addressing arguably the biggest challenge the world faces today – sustainable development. Several pioneering financial institutions, some with the collaboration of non-governmental organisations, have developed key initiatives to act as roadmap towards ensuring intra and intergenerational equity. These initiatives are referred to as codes of conduct, and take on the name voluntary, because organizations are not mandated to adopt them. Nonetheless, these self-regulatory codes inadvertently act as <b>soft</b> <b>laws</b> to which adopters must abide by. This research describes the more prevalent codes in the financial sector – the Equator Principles, Global Alliance on Banking Values, United Nations Environmental Programme Finance Incentive, United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment – with the latter three used as a case study to determine if significant differences exist between signatories and non-signatories. Via quantitative techniques, results indicate that there is indeed a noteworthy difference between both groups of banks, suggesting that signatories address sustainability concerns in their reports more often than their non-signatory counterparts. The research concludes by noting that even though more reporting does not necessarily translate to enhanced performance, it {{is a step in the}} right direction, and exudes the qualities of the codes that may have been responsible for this development...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to show that}} the greatest impediment to a reduction in the transaction cost consists of two factors. First, the problem of the choice of laws makes contracting a hazardous enterprise for those who have an information disadvantage. Second, the reluctance of the legal profession to embrace and familiarise themselves with uniform international laws does not enhance a client’s expectation to be able to access the ‘best’ law. It is argued that the inclusion of international uniform laws such as the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG, 1980) will reduce the transactions costs either at trial or when a problem rises as both parties operate in essence under the same law and, hence, a negotiated settlement is more likely. The paper specifically addresses the problem which can emerge when a contract is silent as to which law will govern the legal relationship. Close attention is given to a possibility of overcoming choice of laws problems by applying the CISG, instead of explicitly excluding the CISG. This paper also investigates the inclusions of <b>soft</b> <b>laws</b> into contracts and the ability of such an inclusion to reduce transaction costs. The conclusion is that the inclusion of uniform laws reduces uncertainty and is, furthermore, merely recognition of a development which is gathering speed...|$|R
