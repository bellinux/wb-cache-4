500|$|On March3, 1880, {{four men}} robbed the station's safe. They {{broke into the}} depot {{late at night and}} dragged the safe {{to the center of the}} station. They then {{attempted}} to drill holes into the safe and explode it with gunpowder, but failing that, cut off one of its sides. The contents of the safe were 300 cigars and a few bills and papers. After the suspects were arrested in Poughkeepsie, the local sheriff was reluctant to transfer the suspects to New Paltz. The Poughkeepsie police were insistent that they be paid immediately for their services. The day after their arrest, the men were allowed to go to a barber <b>shop</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> shave; some witnesses were unable to identify the suspects because of this, and the officers were publicly chided for incompetence. Cigars in the suspects' pockets were identical to the cigars in the safe, and along with tools recovered from the site, they were used to identify the men. The suspects were brought to a jail in Kingston pending the ruling of a grand jury that April. A large crowd gathered at the New Paltz depot to watch them depart. The men were described as [...] "cracksmen of the first water", possibly [...] "stylish", and so proficient at safe-cracking that, [...] "if they [...] any chance at all, or [...] hold of any weapon, they [...] pick their way thro' the jail as easily as boring through a lime heap". The men were subsequently convicted. As a result of the burglary, station agent Dwight Marsh was given a revolver, and it became policy not to keep valuables in the safe overnight. On December8, 1880, another thief broke a window at the depot and stole a box of cigars.|$|E
