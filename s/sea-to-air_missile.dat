The ship can travel at speeds up to [...] and is propelled by twin fusion reactors. The seaQuest is coated in a genetically engineered bio-skin that remains inert against most marine bacteria and organisms, and the ship has a crush depth of more than 9 km of water. The ship {{is equipped with a}} complement of standard torpedoes, as well as nuclear tipped SLBMs, intercepts, <b>sea-to-air</b> <b>missiles,</b> and state-of-the art laser banks, as well as a specialized [...] "grapnel torpedo" [...] to allow the seaQuest to tow or retract a target. The ship is also equipped with a series of WSKRS (pronounced [...] "whiskers"; Wireless Sea Knowledge Retrieval Satellites): small sensor probes that are remotely controlled by the ship's sensor chief.|$|R
