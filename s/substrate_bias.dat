Experimental conditions including <b>substrate</b> <b>biasing,</b> <b>substrate</b> pretreatment, gas flow rate, catalyst coating, {{and the type of}} carbon source, play important roles in controlling the nucleation and growth of carbon-based materials. In this Ph. D. work, the effects of various processing factors on nucleation and growth of carbon based materials were systematically investigated.

Optimization of experiment conditions based on this understanding is beneficial for the controlled synthesis of carbon-based materials with desired properties. In addition, the controlled synthesis of tungsten-based nanostructures using a hot filament reactor was studied. The main results presented in this thesis are: (1) Synthesis of well-aligned carbon nanotube or carbon nanocone films with a glow discharge under a negative <b>substrate</b> <b>biasing.</b> The electric field in the plasma sheath above the substrate has been found to play an important role in controlling the alignment and orientation of nanotubes or nanocones.
