She carried the drugs in her large skirt pockets and dropped them into her clients' pockets on the dance floor.

This is supplemented by Cartman's flashbacks to the creation of the joke, which become more overblown and ridiculous as the episode goes on, showing him to truly believe that he deserves credit.|$|E

These important sources are fiercely iconodule and are hostile to the Emperor Constantine V (741-775). As Constantine's father, Leo also became a target.
