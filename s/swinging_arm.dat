25|$|The {{suspension}} of the 2CV was very soft; a person could easily rock the car side to side dramatically. The <b>swinging</b> <b>arm,</b> fore-aft linked suspension system with inboard front brakes had a much smaller unsprung mass than existing coil spring or leaf spring designs. The design was modified by Marcel Chinon.|$|E

25|$|After a sixth-minute penalty to the Dragons {{helped them}} up into good field position, Jamie Soward from the ten-metre line kicked {{the ball over}} into the Roosters' in-goal and Mark Gasnier, racing through from the right side, leapt to catch it on the full and put it down just inside the dead ball line. The video referee Bill Harrigan awarded the try and Soward's {{conversion}} was successful, so St. George Illawarra were leading 6-0 after eight minutes. However, video replays showed that in the lead up to the try, Dragons winger Brett Morris had passed the ball with a foot outside the touch-line so play {{should not have been}} allowed to continue. Later, in the sixteenth minute, the Roosters had made their way up into better field position when Todd Carney, twenty metres from the opposition try-line's right side, kicked high to the left corner. His winger Joseph Leilua caught the ball, crashed over the try-line, and while attempting to put it down had it knocked from his outstretched hand by Jamie Soward's knee, but Roosters captain Braith Anasta was there to ground it. The video referee was again called upon to award the try, and with Carney's kick going wide the score was 6-4 in favour of the Red & Whites. Less than two minutes after the restart of play St. George Illawarra knocked on in their own half and the Tricolours, after getting within fifteen metres of the try-line, moved the ball through the hands from {{the left side of the}} field to the right where Mitchell Aubusson crashed over near the corner. Carney again missed the conversion but his side was now in the lead 8-6 with a quarter of the match gone. In the twenty-sixth minute the Dragons were awarded a penalty in a goal-kicking position but Soward missed. At the thirty-minute mark St. George Illawarra prop Michael Weyman was helped off the field after getting a <b>swinging</b> <b>arm</b> to the head from Daniel Conn which was placed on report. The third quarter of the match was played in both ends of the ground with neither side able to turn their opportunities into points, so the teams left the field with the Sydney Roosters leading 6-8.|$|E
2500|$|The system {{comprises}} two {{suspension cylinders}} mounted horizontally {{on each side}} of the platform chassis. Inside the cylinders are two springs, one for each wheel, mounted at each end of the cylinder. The springs are connected to the front leading <b>swinging</b> <b>arm</b> and rear trailing <b>swinging</b> <b>arm,</b> that act like bellcranks by pull rods (tie rods). These are connected to spring seating cups in the middle of the cylinder, each spring being compressed independently, against the ends of the cylinder. Each cylinder is mounted using an additional set of springs, originally made from steel, called [...] "volute" [...] springs, on later models made from rubber. These allow the front and rear suspension to interconnect. When the front wheel is deflected up over a bump, the front pull rod compresses the front spring inside the cylinder, against the front of the cylinder. This also compresses the front [...] "volute" [...] spring pulling the whole cylinder forwards. That action pulls the rear wheel down on the same side via the rear spring assembly and pull rod. When the rear wheel meets that bump a moment later, it does the same in reverse, keeping the car level front to rear. When both springs are compressed on one side when travelling around a bend, or front and rear wheels hit bumps simultaneously, the equal and opposite forces applied to the front and rear spring assemblies reduce the interconnection. It reduces pitching, which is a particular problem of soft car suspension.|$|E
2500|$|In 1950 {{the company}} went into {{liquidation}} and was acquired by Scott enthusiast Matt Holder's Aerco Jig and Tool Company in Birmingham. From his premises in St Mary's Row, Holder, who was an expert silversmith initially continued to build the same model from Shipley-made spare parts. These [...] "Birmingham Scotts" [...] remained available into the 1960s. In 1956 Holder began development of a 596cc model with a duplex frame and telescopic fork front. When Matt's son David Holder moved the remaining stock to the former Triumph Motorcycles 'Number 2' factory at Meriden he found {{that his father had}} accumulated a huge collection of original Scott parts, including Miller headlights and Burgess silencers. In 1958 the Birmingham Scott was updated by adding a <b>swinging</b> <b>arm</b> frame and the dynamo was replaced by an alternator. [...] A new 493cc motorcycle called the Scott Swift was announced but never went into production, although Holder continued to develop and produce one-off Scott motorcycles until 1978.|$|E

50|$|Large-scale {{changes were}} made in 2001, with a {{complete}} restyling of the bodywork by designer Gareth Davies, a newly designed engine raising the horsepower to 149 with internal performance upgrades included Forged steel crankshaft, forged steel connecting rods, and forged aluminium pistons. Focussed on reducing weight and better handling, the 2001 955i used a more common double-sided <b>swing</b> <b>arm</b> (DSSA) {{as opposed to the}} single-sided <b>swing</b> <b>arm</b> (SSSA) of the previous Daytonas. The DSSA version weighs 7.5 lb less than the SSSA due to the lighter weight <b>swing</b> <b>arm,</b> and it is argued that the DSSA version handles better than the SSSA as it has less flex in the <b>swing</b> <b>arm.</b> The 2001+ 955i version had a more compact and advanced Sagem MC1000 electronic engine management system (2-plug) instead of the original Sagem MC2000 controller (1-plug).|$|R

I can even remember sitting behind D... and saying some rude thing or other over his shoulder. I don't remember why I gave it up but I did quite suddenly; and I think the push may have come from a young workman who was educating himself between Morris and Karl Marx. He had planned a history of the navy and when I had spoken of the battleship of Nelson's day, had said: 'Oh, that was the decadence of the battleship,' but if his naval interests were mediaeval, his ideas about religion were pure Karl Marx, and we were soon in perpetual argument. Then gradually the attitude towards religion of almost everybody but Morris, who avoided the subject altogether, got upon my nerves, for I broke out after some lecture or other with all the arrogance of raging youth. They attacked religion, I said, or some such words, and yet there must be a change of heart and only religion could make it. What was the use of talking about some near revolution putting all things right, when the change must come, if come it did, with astronomical slowness, like the cooling of the sun or, it may have been, like the drying of the moon? Morris rang his chairman's bell, but I was too angry to listen, and he had to ring it a second time before I sat down. He said that night at supper: 'Of course I know there must be a change of heart, but it will not come as slowly as all that. I rang my bell because you were not being understood.' He did not show any vexation, but I never returned after that night; and yet I did not always believe what I had said and only gradually gave up thinking of and planning for some near sudden change for the better.|$|E

50|$|<b>Arm</b> <b>swing</b> {{in human}} bipedal walking {{is a natural}} motion that each <b>arm</b> <b>swings</b> with {{the motion of the}} {{opposing}} leg. <b>Swinging</b> <b>arms</b> in an opposing direction with respect to the lower limb reduces the angular momentum of the body, balancing the rotational motion produced during walking. Although such pendulum-like motion of arms is not essential for walking, recent studies point that <b>arm</b> <b>swing</b> improves the stability and energy efficiency in human locomotion. Those positive effects of <b>arm</b> <b>swing</b> have been utilized in sports, especially in racewalking and sprinting.|$|R
40|$|Humans walk bipedally, and thus, it {{is unclear}} why they <b>swing</b> their <b>arms.</b> In this paper, we will review the {{mechanisms}} and functions of <b>arm</b> <b>swinging</b> in human gait. First, we discuss the potential advantages of having <b>swinging</b> <b>arms.</b> Second, {{we go into the}} detail on the debate whether <b>arm</b> <b>swing</b> is arising actively or passively, where we will conclude that while a large part of <b>arm</b> <b>swinging</b> is mechanically passive, there is an active contribution of muscles (i. e. an activity that is not merely caused by stretch reflexes). Third, we describe the possible function of the active muscular contribution to <b>arm</b> <b>swinging</b> in normal gait, and discuss the possibility that a Central Pattern Generator (CPG) generates this activity. Fourth, we discuss examples from pathological cases, in which <b>arm</b> <b>swinging</b> is affected. Moreover, using the ideas presented, we suggest ways in which <b>arm</b> <b>swing</b> may be used as a therapeutic aid. We conclude that (1) <b>arm</b> <b>swing</b> should be seen {{as an integral part of}} human bipedal gait, arising mostly from passive movements, which are stabilized by active muscle control, which mostly originates from locomotor circuits in the central nervous system (2) <b>arm</b> <b>swinging</b> during normal bipedal gait most likely serves to reduce energy expenditure and (3) <b>arm</b> <b>swinging</b> may be of therapeutic value...|$|R
