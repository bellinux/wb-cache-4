40|$|We {{present an}} {{efficient}} full-volume automatic dense-picking method for flattening seismic data. First local dips (<b>step-outs)</b> are calculated {{over the entire}} seismic volume. The dips are then resolved into time shifts (or depth shifts) using a nonlinear Gauss-Newton iterative approach that exploits fast Fourier transforms to minimize computation time. To handle faults (discontinuous reflections), we apply a weighted inversion scheme. The weight identifies locations of faults, allowing dips to be summed around the faults to reduce the influence of erroneous dip estimates near the fault. If a fault model is not provided, we can estimate a suitable weight (essentially a fault indicator) within our inversion using an iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) method. The method is tested successfully on both synthetic and field data sets of varying degrees of complexity, including salt piercements, angular unconformities, and laterally limited faults...|$|R

You don’t have him back defensively balancing the floor, you’re wasting him. But you let him {{do a lot of}} what the point guard stuff entails. But then also defensively you don’t bother guarding him on the little guy. Put him on maybe the three man or even sometimes the four man if he’s a <b>step-out</b> player. And now you have a guy like Larry Bird who anticipates. He gets a lot of deflections and steals. He’s long, he blocks shots.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{need for}} more energy {{in the world is}} making the oil companies search for hydrocarbons in deeper water and with longer distances between the well and platform(step-out) never experienced before. Current systems are designed to operate in deepwater with relatively short <b>step-outs.</b> Since the search now is starting to exceed this, the operational conditions are changed and the electro-hydraulic system is closing in on its operational limits. Hence, the increasing need for a system that supports the long <b>step-outs</b> and the deeper water. Aker Kvaerner has started looking into the development for an All Electric Subsea Production system. In co-operation with Aker Kvaerner Subsea, a functional design specification for an electric subsea gate valve actuator has been developed and included in this thesis. This functional design specification will include all the requirements that a subsea electric actuator must conform to. This includes the operational requirements, size limitations, failsafe needs etc. Based on this specification, a design for a electric actuator and including motor driver control system layout on the all electric x-mas tree is proposed {{as a part of the}} All Electric Subsea Production system. The actuator will be used to operate the gate valves on a x-mas tree which controls the flow of hydrocarbons through the valves into the pipelines. Most of the existing subsea gate valve actuators are currently using hydraulic oil to operate the valves linearly. Here a concept is being suggested in replacement of the hydraulic fluid, while still complying with the necessary design specification. A number of electrical machines for potential use in this application are presented and evaluated. A Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine is being investigated further. These machines can be custom made, and can also be made with built in redundancy. Calculation of size for the Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine has been done, to determine suitability within the space limitation of the apparatus. Two layouts for controlling the actuators on the all electric x-mas tree are proposed. These two are also evaluated against the standards made for subsea production systems and the no 'single point failure' requirement made by the industry. The chosen solution proposed for controlling the electrical actuators is an integrated design, where all actuators have their own motor driver inside. This thesis conclude that an electrical actuator will be technically and mechanically possible to build(from an electrical perspective), using the design and control layout proposed. </p...|$|R
40|$|Public–Private Partnerships (PPPs) {{constitute}} a crucial vehicle in delivering infrastructure. In {{the transport sector}} the primary project sponsors are construction companies, which {{over the last few}} decades have transformed to strong international actors. In order to study growth strategies stemming from the PPP agreement, a conceptual game theoretic model built on four institutional rationalities (legal, political and scientific in addition to economic) driving economic behaviour is presented. The model indicates that the prevailing strategies are training, acquisitions and <b>step-outs.</b> The former strategy is less efficient than the other two with respect to the single project. The latter two suggest the likelihood of “unproductive investments” influencing infrastructure quality and social benefits. All three strategies lead to market concentration, which has been evidenced in the market. The model only considers construction firm strategies and does not weight the relative importance of the operation phase with respect to the construction one. This would be an extension to the model, which would then also consider operator strategies. In its present form, the model indicates the conditions leading to “unproductive investments” and market concentration and provides the grounds to formulate policy guidelines to limit adverse effects...|$|R
40|$|Volumetric attening is {{a method}} for {{automatically}} attening entire 3 D seismic cubes without manual picking. This is an efcient algorithm that intrinsically performs automatic dense picking on entire 3 D cubes at once. The method involves rst calculating local dips (<b>step-outs)</b> everywhere in the data using a dip estimation technique. These dips are resolved into time shifts (or depth shifts) via a non-linear least-squares problem. The data are subsequently vertically shifted according to the summed time shifts to output a attened volume. A most attractive feature of the previously described attening technique is that it requires no manual picking. This would be ne if all data sets had reasonably accurate estimated dips, but {{in the real world}} automatic attening can produce results that are not perfect. Noise, both coherent and otherwise, can overwhelm the dip estimation causing reectors in those areas to not be at. Multiples, for example, are signicant source of coherent noise that can contaminate the dip eld. Although certain faults with tip-lines (terminations) encased within the data cube can be attened if a fault model is provided, faults that cut across the entire data cube cannot. Consequently, {{it would be useful to}} have the ability to add some geological constraints to restrict the attening result in areas of poor data quality while allowing it to efciently tackle other areas where estimated dips are mor...|$|R

40|$|The {{demand for}} oil & gas {{resources}} is forecasted to continue increasing in the next decades. And, {{since most of the}} potential onshore areas for exploration are already under production, most of the new discoveries to be done are offshore, in deeper water depths and longer <b>step-outs</b> from land. Subsea located equipment for control and monitoring of the oil & gas production require supply of electrical power for remote operation of control valves, monitoring of fluid pressure, temperature and flow. Power is typically supplied from an offshore platform or from a land based facility through a subsea umbilical. One alternative configuration is the installation of the power generation equipment close to the consumers, avoiding the use of long and expensive umbilicals and reducing the area needed for power generation equipment in the platforms, among other advantages that can save capital and operation costs. By reviewing the available power generation technologies for powering subsea production equipmant, ranking them according to a set of parameters, selecting the most feasible concepts and evaluating the cost of these concepts in different subsea cases; this thesis identifies the power generation technologies most suitable for the subsea application. Energy storage technologies are also briefly screened for the subsea application and recommendation is done on the use of a specific one. The Levelised Cost of Electricity (LCOE) is used to define the most cost effective technology for four different subsea cases (operation of a SSIV, operation of a single subsea well, operation of 8 subsea wells and operation of a subsea boosting station). It is observed that there is technology available, with high readiness level, that can power subsea equipment, as an alternative to powering from the topside facilities of the platform or from onshore facilities, with considerable cost saving, also solving some other technical challenges faced in long tie-backs and in platform space management...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} part of an ongoing effort to improve {{retention}} of engineering students at the J. B. Speed School of Engineering at the University of Louisville. The {{purpose of this study was}} twofold: (1) to gain a better understanding of the relationship among interest in engineering, performance and first-year retention in engineering, and whether this relationship is different for males and females, and (2) to better understand the relationship among self-control, academic ability and first semester GPA for engineering students. To address the first research question investigating retention, survey responses and data from student records were analyzed using logistic regression. Results of these analyses showed students who indicated they had very high interest in engineering were 43 times more likely to be retained than students who indicated very low interest, and 6 times more likely than a student who indicated they had low to medium interest, given the same GPA. There was not a significant difference in the probability of being retained for students who indicated they had high or very high interest, given the same GPA. Results also showed that a one point increase in GPA increased the likelihood of a student being retained by 4. 6 times, given the same level of interest. Based on these results, the <b>Step-outs</b> to Stars engineering retention framework was created. Students were separated into four quadrants based on their level of interest and first semester GPA. The framework can be used as a mechanism to allocate resources targeted to improve engineering retention and to frame future research on engineering retention. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze survey and student data to answer the second research question related to first semester performance of engineering students. In the study academic ability was measured by algebra readiness test scores and ACT math, science, English and reading scores. Self-control was measured by self-reported scores on the Brief Self-Control Scale (Tangney, Baumeister, 2 ̆ 6 Boone, 2004). Results confirmed prior research, which found a significant positive relationship between self-control and academic performance, and a lack of significance between self-control and standardized test scores. These results can be used to strengthen the argument for programs to help improve self-control in K- 12 and post-secondary students. The results can also be used to help prospective and current engineering students understand that higher levels of self-control might improve their academic performance in engineering...|$|R
