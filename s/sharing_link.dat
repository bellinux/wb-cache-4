Our method {{is shown to}} substantially improve previous upper bounds fir GPS scheduling of MMFP sessions, especially {{as the number of}} sessions increases. Application of analytical results to admission control indicate that by sharing bandwidth using GPS among traffic classes there are significant gains over systems that statlcally segregate the link bandwidth. This effect is quantified in several experiments where various combinations of source types are used. The gains are pronounced when bursty sources with stricter QoS requirements are used...|$|E

Here stream traffic refers to traffic with a certain bandwidth guarantee, whereas elastic traffic flows can adapt their rates to the link bandwidth left over by the stream flows. First, models are developed that describe different strategies for <b>sharing</b> <b>link</b> capacities between the stream and elastic flows. Then we give mathematical methods for obtaining performance measures, in particular call blocking probabilities and file transfer delays. Finally, these methods are used for assessing and comparing the efficiency gains achieved by the integration strategies...|$|E

We describe how the MMNA was experimentally implemented and evaluated in a testbed setup. We first validated the capabilities of the solution in terms of different multihoming features, namely load <b>sharing,</b> <b>link</b> failure recovery, and preference setting. We then examined the effectiveness and feasibility of the MMNA solution considering a use case example of a search and rescue scenario. The results highlight the practicality and advantages of deploying the MMNA solution into realistic scenarios...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} the Neighbor-state Based Queuing (NBQ) for {{improving}} the performance of flows <b>sharing</b> <b>link</b> bandwidth under various transfer protocols. Each router with NBQ informs the next upstream router of its link status. According to the received status, NBQ dynamically sets the packet discard ratio of the non-adaptive flows. NBQ reduces the wasted nonadaptive flows and provides available bandwidth for the adaptive flows. We have demonstrated dramatic improvements of adaptive flow's throughput using our scheme through simulations. 1 Introduction In the last few years, the Internet has become an applicable infrastructure to support various types of services, containing text based service, on-demand multimedia retrieval service, and real-time interactive service such as video conferences and telephony.

40|$|In our {{quest to}} give users uniform access to {{resources}} unimpeded by administrative boundaries, we discovered that we needed transitive sharing among users, {{with the possibility of}} restricted access along each <b>sharing</b> <b>link.</b> To achieve that goal, we extend Lampson et al. 's calculus for access control to support restricted delegations. We discuss the advantages of our extension, including the simplification of constructs like ACLs and statement expiration. We also apply our extension to model the Simple Public Key Infrastructure and make suggestions about its future development. Our extended calculus exposes some surprising consequences in such systems that use restricted delegation. 1 Introduction Users should be able to access resources uniformly, seamlessly crossing administrative boundaries when they are not relevant to the task the user is trying to accomplish. One of the most di#cult aspects of achieving that goal is finding an architecture for security that spans administrative d [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Over {{the last}} three years, we have been {{incrementally}} designing incentive mechanisms to encourage user participation in online communities. Our target community was a relatively small-scale, centralized, peer-to-peer community for sharing links to class-related resources. The users were students in undergraduate computer science classes, typically between 30 - 35 users. We found {{that most of the}} users responded to the incentive mechanism as we intended, but some users attempted to game the system. The excessive contributions resulted in “information overload ” and user withdrawal. To make the participation level in the community sustainable, we modified the incentive mechanism to discourage excessive contributions and elicit contributions with higher quality. This required adding a separate incentive mechanism to encourage users to rate each others ’ contributions and modifying the existing incentive mechanism so that it adapts to the users preferences and to the current needs of the community. The results showed that the timeliness, quality and type of contributions can be effectively influenced by the mechanism. Comtella: an online community for <b>sharing</b> <b>link...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Most of the QoS-based routing schemes {{proposed}} so far {{focus on}} improving {{the performance of}} individual service classes. In a multi-class network where high priority QoS traffic coexists with best-effort traffic, routing decision for QoS sessions will {{have an effect on}} lower one. A mechanism that allows dynamic <b>sharing</b> <b>link</b> among multiple classes of traffic is needed. In this paper we propose a multi-class routing algorithm based on inter-class sharing resources among multiple class of traffic. Our algorithm is based on the concept of “the virtual residual bandwidth”, which is derived from the real residual bandwidth. The virtual residual bandwidth is greater than the residual bandwidth when the load of lower priority traffic is light, and smaller when the load of lower priority traffic is heavy. The idea of our approach is simple since the routing algorithm for individual traffic doesn’t change, but the only change is the definition of the link cost. We demonstrate through some extensive simulation the effectiveness of our approach when the best effort distribution is uneven and when its load is heavy. Also better performance is noticed when using topology with large number of alternatives path. Key words: QoS, Routing, multi-class, link cost. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to propose and test a {{theoretical}} framework to explain resilience in supply chain networks for sustainability using unstructured Big Data, based upon 36, 422 items gathered in the form of tweets, news, Facebook, WordPress, Instagram, Google+, and YouTube, and structured data, via responses from 205 managers involved in disaster relief activities in the aftermath of Nepal earthquake in 2015. The paper uses Big Data analysis, followed by a survey which was analyzed using content analysis and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The results of the analysis suggest that swift trust, information sharing and public-private partnership are critical enablers of resilience in supply chain networks. The current study used crosssectional data. However the hypotheses of the study can be tested using longitudinal data to attempt to establish causality. The article advances the literature on resilience in disaster supply chain networks for sustainability in that (i) it suggests the use of Big Data analysis to propose and test particular frameworks in the context of resilient supply chains that enable sustainability; (ii) it argues that swift trust, public private partnerships, and quality information <b>sharing</b> <b>link</b> to resilience in supply chain networks; and (iii) it uses the context of Nepal, at the moment of the disaster relief activities to provide contemporaneous perceptions of the phenomenon as it takes place.
