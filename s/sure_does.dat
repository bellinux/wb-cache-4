500|$|In {{a review}} of the video, Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly said, [...] "For a song with such a title, it <b>sure</b> <b>does</b> take a minute for its video to build up to wow-worthy moments. After some clean dance sequences, the magic begins. Usher grooves with shadows, puffs out O’s with cigar smoke, and then links back up with his ladies on a primary colored dance floor to show off his steps." [...] Chris Ryan of MTV News {{compared}} the video's flashing lights to the music video for [...] "Yeah!", and called the song an answer track to Trey Songz's [...] "LOL". At the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards, the clip was nominated for Best Dance Video, Best Choreography, and Best Male Video.|$|E

That’s racing I suppose but it <b>sure</b> <b>does</b> hurt sometimes.” After finishing in 26th, Webber said it had been an tough event for his team and revealed that they were confident that they could have battled for the victory had his car not sustained two punctured tyres: [...] "It just goes to show how hard endurance racing can be. We’re all right on the limit and as we’ve seen here that’s causing quite a high rate of attrition. Third time lucky at Le Mans is the plan." [...] Mücke stated that he felt okay after his heavy crash and thanked his team for constructing a safe vehicle. The {{chief executive officer of the}} World Endurance Championship Gerard Neveu {{described the}} event as [...] "a great day for motorsport" [...] but felt that it was slightly strange. He revealed that after the race, he had organised a meeting with several people and raised the question of why [...] "there was so much aggression and action in Spa. It's quite simple: the cars are all so close together, the competition is so hard as never before. It can happen at any time - that is exciting...".|$|E

2500|$|... "Battle Scars" [...] {{received}} {{positive response}} from overseas, including mentions in reviews for Fiasco's album. Hip hop indie/pop site Hillydilly called it [...] "epic", writing, [...] "Evidently this guy can sing because he <b>sure</b> <b>does</b> {{let it be}} known on 'Battle Scars'. There is also a perfect amount of Lupe on this track—he is not tucked away on some last verse ****, rather he is found throughout the song." [...] David Fredrick from music discovery site Gigity wrote, [...] "it is an instant classic that will surely grab your attention." [...] HipHop DX said it [...] "oozed mass appeal without deteriorating into sloshy mainstream". [...] Colin McQuire from Pop Matters wrote that the [...] "piano-laden groove adds the texture it needs to be a bona fide Top 40 hit, and Fiasco’s crisp broken-hearted rhymes illustrate the exact type of accessibility the track needs to gain commercial notoriety." [...] A reviewer for entertainment site Pop Culture Podcast said, [...] "This one has chart topping single written all over it but due to its genuine lyrics and universal subject matter it doesn't feel like one that you have to 'sell out' to make." ...|$|E
2500|$|Glenn Gamboa of Newsday {{reviewed}} the song saying, [...] "'California Gurls' is a fizzy-pop concoction of empty calories, but it <b>sure</b> <b>does</b> stick with you." [...] He {{went on to}} note that the craftsmanship of the song was of a high standard. Steve Leftridge of PopMatters called [...] "California Gurls" [...] the radio jam of the summer of 2010 and [...] "the gargantuan singalong fantasy that delivered on the promise built by the disco thump of hits like 'I Kissed a Girl' and 'Hot n Cold'." [...] Leftridge also praised the song's musical composition, lyrical content and its chorus which he said [...] "you know by heart halfway through your first listen." [...] The track was deemed as a highlight on Teenage Dream by Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic. Michael Cragg of musicOMH praised the song, [...] "First single California Gurls is brilliant, brattish fun, Perry sounding sweet and coy on the verses before that huge chorus erupts". Edna Gundersen of USA Today said that the track is [...] "an effervescent toast to summer fun." [...] Greg Kot of Chicago Tribune, however, dismissed the song as [...] "relentlessly mechanical". He went on to describe Perry's vocal performance on the song as [...] "a series of syllables digitally stitched together." [...] The single received a Grammy nomination for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals. On May 25, 2012, Billboard ranked the song number one on a special The 30 Summer Songs of All Time listing.|$|E
2500|$|Critical {{response}} to Daughtry was mixed; while many critics {{felt that the}} album was generally pleasing and the first real [...] "rock" [...] album from American Idol alumni, others felt it was unoriginal and too commercial. [...] While Ken Barnes of USA Today conceded that Chris Daughtry has [...] "strong pipes and palpable angst", overall he found the band [...] "generic", calling them [...] "FuelNickelStaindback". People magazine found the album [...] "a solid if not spectacular effort that {{at the very least}} proves that Chris Daughtry is not just another Idol also-ran." [...] Christian Hoard (with Rolling Stone) said that [...] " [...] Daughtry gets points for not courting soccer moms, but just because he can howl like a motherfucker doesn't mean he's not a cheeseball." [...] In a truly mixed review, Billboard said the album [...] "is music tailor-made for ill-conceived radio formatting, music for consumers whose taste has already been well-established if not preprogrammed," [...] then added, [...] "But [...] Daughtry <b>sure</b> <b>does</b> sing his butt off." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic awarded the album three and a half stars out of five, calling the album [...] "a debut that's not only a lot more credible than any American Idol-affiliated rock album should be, but it's a lot easier to digest than most of its ilk." [...] In a humorous review, comedian Stephen Colbert found Chris Daughtry's success further proof of the impending [...] "cultural Armageddon." [...] He remarked, [...] "It's bad enough this guy sounds like Creed...but Daughtry's success sets a dangerous precedent of rewarding losers...America elected Taylor Hicks as its Idol, and we owe him our loyalty." ...|$|E
