25|$|A {{parabolic}} microphone uses a {{parabolic reflector}} {{to collect and}} <b>focus</b> <b>sound</b> waves onto a microphone receiver, {{in much the same}} way that a parabolic antenna (e.g. satellite dish) does with radio waves. Typical uses of this microphone, which has unusually <b>focused</b> <b>front</b> sensitivity and can pick up sounds from many meters away, include nature recording, outdoor sporting events, eavesdropping, law enforcement, and even espionage. Parabolic microphones are not typically used for standard recording applications, because they tend to have poor low-frequency response as a side effect of their design.|$|R

They hence assign to it-clefts a representation modeled on that of wh-interrogatives and of <b>focus</b> <b>fronting.</b> The paper first outlines one precise cartographic implementation of this analysis and then it is shown that such an analysis presents a number of problems of implementation which proponents of the matrix analysis would have to address. The problems concern both the external and the internal syntax of it-clefts. Distributionally, it-clefts are shown to pattern differently from sentences with <b>focus</b> <b>fronting.</b> Moreover the monoclausal analysis raises problems of implementation, in particular given that the cleft focus can itself undergo <b>focus</b> <b>fronting</b> and wh-movement...|$|R

40|$|To {{become a}} {{proficient}} reader, {{children have to}} learn mappings between print, sound and meaning. There is debate over whether reading instruction {{should focus on the}} relations between print and sound, as in phonics, or on the relationship between print and meaning, as in sight word reading. In a study where participants learned a novel artificial orthography, Taylor, Davis and Rastle (submitted) compared print to <b>sound</b> <b>focused</b> or print to meaning focused reading training, demonstrating that sound training was superior for learning to read. However, a benefit from <b>sound</b> <b>focused</b> training is likely dependent on prior acquisition of effective sound to meaning relations of words. To explore this issue, we developed a connectionist model of reading. We exposed the model to a sound or a meaning focused training, but varied the model’s pre-acquired oral language skills. The simulation results showed that proficiency in oral language is a determinant of the advantage of print to <b>sound</b> <b>focused</b> reading training, indicating that reading training should address both oral language skills and print to sound mappings...|$|R

40|$|At {{ultimate}} L 2 attainment, Sorace's (2006) Interface Hypothesis {{predicts that}} narrow syntactic properties can be fully acquired whereas properties at the external interfaces will inevitably result in non-native optionality. The present study tests the Interface Hypothesis {{as it pertains}} to the acquisition of <b>Focus</b> <b>Fronting</b> (FF) and P-movement (type 1 and 2) with their ensuing pragmatic consequences by English natives learning Spanish (n= 90 advanced, intermediate and low intermediate plus n= 47 native controls). The syntactic analysis used was Lopez (2009). Group results indicate that these properties can be successfully acquired, although not all to the same extent. While Rheme and P-movement type 1 posed no problems for the learners, <b>Focus</b> <b>Fronting</b> was more problematic. The native data on P-movement type 2 indicate the need for further testing, as it did not confirm the linguistic predictions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{this work}} I explore the {{different}} discourse–syntax interface properties of <b>focus</b> <b>fronting</b> in Standard Spanish (SS) and Southern Peninsular Spanish (SPS) including Andalusian and Extremaduran varieties. In SS it is {{taken for granted}} that in <b>focus</b> <b>fronting</b> the verb is obligatorily adjacent to the preposed constituent. I show {{that this is not}} the case in SPS, where this condition is optional. I carry out an analysis of three types of foci which involve movement to the left periphery (contrastive focus, mirative <b>focus</b> and quantifier <b>fronting)</b> and one type of topic (resumptive preposing). Discourse, syntactic, and semantic properties are taken into account to illustrate this typology. Crucially, only contrastive and mirative focus contexts allow for preverbal subjects in SPS, which are proposed to be Given Topics in this variety. On the other hand, resumptive preposing is shown to entail a case of topic fronting. I use different experiments with empirical data and judgements by native speakers to test my proposal that focus-verb (or topic-verb) adjacency is subject to microparametric variation in Spanish...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{uses the}} generative framework {{to study the}} syntax and pragmatics of word order variation in the Andean Spanish of Bolivia and Ecuador. While Standard Spanish has basic order SVO, in Andean Spanish the object frequently appears in preverbal position, resulting in alternative orders (e. g. OVS). Previous studies have attributed this phenomenon to an influence of Quechua, where the object typically precedes the verb, {{but they do not}} discuss which linguistic properties have been transferred. The alternative orders are also possible in Standard Spanish, but in Standard Spanish fronted elements encode topic/focus. Since <b>focus</b> <b>fronting</b> could explain the high frequency of preverbal objects in Andean Spanish, this dissertation examines whether <b>focus</b> <b>fronting</b> in Andean Spanish has the same properties as in Standard Spanish. The main syntactic properties of <b>focus</b> <b>fronting</b> in Standard Spanish are its sensitivity to weak crossover effects and long distance movement. Elicitation studies were designed to test for these properties in Spanish and Quechua. In addition, naturalistic data were collected and an elicitation study on wh-questions and answers was created to study the pragmatics of focus in Spanish and Quechua. The subjects for the study were Quechua-Spanish bilinguals from Bolivia and Ecuador, and adult Spanish monolinguals. The results reveal that the transfer from Quechua into Andean Spanish is restricted to the domain of pragmatics, and does not affect the syntax. In other words, syntactically Andean Spanish is identical to Standard Spanish. The study has implications for syntactic theory, and studies in language contact and second language acquisition. Specifically, it contributes {{to our understanding of the}} nature of cross-linguistic influence and linguistic vulnerability in second language acquisition and language contact. It also contributes to syntactic theory by providing a better understanding of word order and focus in Spanish and Quechua...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This article {{discusses}} the syntax and LF {{properties of the}} phenomenon of sluicing as ellipsis of the sentential complement to an interrogative complementizer hosting a wh-phrase in Persian. The main {{purpose of this paper}} is to explore sluicing in Persian as a real wh-in-situe language that displays optional wh-movement, with a special focus on multiple sluicing. Built on focus movement analysis rather than wh-movement, we examined the movement-plus-deletion approach and the role of <b>focus</b> <b>fronting</b> in moving the remnant out of the deleted constituent in Persian sluicing to a position where it can be stranded. Finally, we also looked into possibility of non-interrogative sluicing and non-d-linked wh words and briefly put forward our proposition about wh the hell phrases in Persian.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the discourse functions of <b>fronted</b> <b>foci</b> in Italian and Spanish.

By means of corpus data, I also intend to show that <b>fronted</b> <b>foci</b> are frequently quantified expressions, expressions of predicative qualification, demonstrative pronouns, and expressions associated with focus sensitive particles.
