Damage has been quantified in terms of crack opening and shear displacements, and the results have been compared with corresponding damage occurring due to quasi- static loading of the same materials.

Any nondestructive testing system consists of five major functions as shown in Fig. 1. The test object to be examined is energized by an excitation transducer. The response of the energy-specimen interaction is picked up by a receiving transducer. The received signal is then processed and analyzed for defect characterization or Inversion. The ultimate goal of an NDT system is the inverse problem of determining the defect profiles in the test object, given the measurements from the receiving transducer. The defect characterization scheme is generally based on the solution of the partial differential equations governing the energy-test <b>specimen</b> <b>interaction.</b> As seen in Fig. 1 one of the primary steps involved in the inverse problem solution is that of signal conditioning.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the development of}} novel magnetic sensor combined with Atomic Force Microscope probe (AFM) using conventional semiconductor processing techniques and Electron Beam Lithography (EBL). The fabrication of these magnetic sensors was performed on a common micromachined silicon substrate using a generic batch fabrication technique. Sub-micron Hall bar for Scanning Hall probe Microscopy (SHPM) and electromagnetic force coil magnet for Scanning Electromagnetic Force Microscopy (eMFM) were designed and constructed {{at the apex of}} Silicon attractive mode cantilever probes. The process demonstrates good control over sensor parameters. Results indicated controllability of Hall bar junction sizes (spatial resolution) to below 100 nm and Coil diameter sizes to below 500 nm with minimum sizes down to 50 nm and 270 nm respectively. The process has shown its flexibility to accommodate different material systems. The same technology was used to fabricate multiple devices such as double Hall bars on a tip as well as a small electro-magnet coil probe co-defined with the Hall probe to form a magnetic imaging / modification probe. A conventional Non-Contact mode AFM employing heterodyne interferometry and in-house built electronics was modified for SHPM and eMFM. These probes had been scanned over a commercial computer hard disk. These microscopes showed the capability of resolving magnetic bits and topographic information independently and simultaneously. All scanning experiments were carried out under ambient conditions. The experiments required no extra preparation to be done to the specimen before imaging and measurements were carried out under ambient conditions. These probes offer the prospect of direct magnetic field measurement, non- invasiveness, very close proximity, possible local manipulation, better control over the tip- <b>specimen</b> <b>interaction</b> distance and topographic imaging. It is hoped that these magnetic microscope probes will be of great interest and general utility for academic and industrial magneticians.

40|$|Large servo-hydraulic {{shaking table}} systems are {{essential}} tools in experimental earthquake engineering. They provide {{effective ways to}} subject structural components, substructures, or entire structural systems to dynamic excitations similar to those induced by real earthquakes. A typical shake table system includes mechanical, hydraulic, and electronic components. The main objective {{of this study is}} to develop a comprehensive mechanics- based virtual model for the large NEES-UCSD shake table under bare and loaded table conditions. The shake table model developed in this study includes a virtual replica of the actual controller, four servovalve models, two single-ended actuators, two effective accumulators, a two- dimensional mechanical subsystem model, and linear/ nonlinear specimens modelled using the finite element analysis framework OpenSees. OpenSees is integrated to the rest of the simulation model in Matlab-Simulink® using a client-server technique developed within this work. Test- simulation correlation studies show that the virtual system model developed is capable of reproducing the nonlinear dynamic response behaviour of the NEES-UCSD shake table. An extensive set of shake table tests using harmonic and earthquake acceleration records as reference/ commanded signals were performed on the NEES-UCSD table to assess its signal reproduction fidelity after tuning the table controller and using an iterative time-history matching technique. These tests were designed to quantify the effects of the amplitude of the signal used for tuning the table on the signal reproduction fidelity. It was found that the level of fidelity in signal reproduction achieved for a specific amplitude of the commanded signal under the corresponding optimum tuning of the table cannot be maintained when reproducing the same signal at different amplitudes. This is a clear indication that shake tables are highly nonlinear systems and the current state-of-the-art controller and tuning techniques fall short of compensating accurately for these inherent system nonlinearities. The mechanics-based virtual system model developed is extremely useful for: (i) understanding the underlying coupled nonlinear dynamics of a large shake table system; (ii) investigating the most significant sources of signal distortion; (iii) offline tuning of the actual table either by using only the virtual replica of the existing controller or by combining it with simulation -based iterative time history matching techniques; (iv) investigating shake table - linear/nonlinear <b>specimen</b> <b>interaction</b> problem; and (v) future more advanced control algorithm development...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{demonstrate}} and establish a possible application of the cavitation phenomenon as an efficient method to modify surface properties. Three FCC (Face Centered C ubic) materials were subjected to high s peed submerged cavitating jets under certain working conditions, for time periods between 15 and 1, 800 s. The force generated by cavitation is employed to modify the surface roughness in nano and micro scales. The target surface was investigated with digit al optical microscopy, atomic force and electrostatic force microscopy (AFM and EFM) and also with a white light interferomet er. These different observation techniques indicate that at short exposure times, the observed characteristic features in the micro structure – hills, holes and wavy configurat ion – can be related to the start of the plastic deformation of the specimen surface. Longer exposure times inevitably result in a greater number of jet <b>specimen</b> <b>interactions</b> leading to <b>specimen</b> erosion and fract ure. The results demonstrate the possibility to use cavitation bubbles as a micro - nanofabrication method for the surface preparation /modification or shoot - less surface peening. EFM results present a possibility of using cavitation as tool to enhance the e lectrostatic properties of a metal surface by modifying its roughness. The degree of enhancement depends o n the material properties...|$|R

The comparable absolute values and temperature dependence of the two sample’s morphologies indicate the minor role of the grain boundaries on the heat transport. Theoretical modelling demonstrates {{the importance of the}} resonant scattering in both <b>specimens.</b> The <b>interaction</b> between phonon waves and rotational degrees of freedom of CH 3 NH 3 + sub-lattice emerges as the dominant mechanism for attenuation of heat transport and for ultralow thermal conductivity of 0. 5 W/(Km) at room temperature...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this book}} is to outline the physics of image formation, electron­ <b>specimen</b> <b>interactions</b> and image {{interpretation}} in transmission electron mic­ roscopy. The book evolved from lectures delivered at the University of Munster and is a revised version of {{the first part of}} my earlier book Elek­ tronenmikroskopische Untersuchungs- und Priiparationsmethoden, omitting the part which describes specimen-preparation methods. In the introductory chapter, the different types of electron microscope are compared, the various electron-specimen interactions and their applications are summarized and the most important aspects of high-resolution, analytical and high-voltage electron microscopy are discussed. The optics of electron lenses is discussed in Chapter 2 in order to bring out electron-lens properties that are important for an understanding of the function of an electron microscope. In Chapter 3, the wave optics of elec­ trons and the phase shifts by electrostatic and magnetic fields are introduced; Fresnel electron diffraction is treated using Huygens' principle. The recogni­ tion that the Fraunhofer-diffraction pattern is the Fourier transform of the wave amplitude behind a specimen is important because the influence of the imaging process on the contrast transfer of spatial frequencies can be described by introducing phase shifts and envelopes in the Fourier plane. In Chapter 4, the elements of an electron-optical column are described: the electron gun, the condenser and the imaging system. A thorough understanding of electron-specimen interactions is essential to explain image contrast...|$|R

One {{part of the}} tested samples displayed a hot band structure of ferrite, tempered martensite and carbides whereas the other exhibited a ferrite - pearlite microstructure. For both groups of <b>specimens,</b> no <b>interaction</b> could be observed between the recrystallization and the phase transformation, but a strong influence of the carbide precipitation on the recovery and recrystallization was detected. The early nucleation textures in both steels are characterized by a dominant ND fibre (// ND), which is the more intense in the steel with the hot band martensite structure...|$|R

40|$|Size {{requirements}} for a pin loaded double edge notch + crack tension specimen proposed for fracture toughness screening heavy section alloys were studied. Ranking of eight selected alloys {{based on the}} specimen's net strength was compared with that based on the valid plane strain fracture toughness separately determined. Performance of the specimen was judged {{on the basis of}} that comparison. The specimen's net strength was influenced by three critical specimen dimensions: distance between the crack plane and the loading hole, specimen width, and <b>specimen</b> thickness. <b>Interaction</b> between the stress fields of the crack and the loading holes reduced the net strength, but this effect disappeared as the separation reached a dimension equal to the specimen width. The effects of specimen width and thickness are interrelated and affect the net strength through their influence {{on the development of the}} crack tip plastic zone...|$|R
40|$|An {{application}} of laser ultrasonics to investigate circumferential waves and their interaction with defects on cylindrical structures is presented. Due {{to the high}} effectiveness of the laser line-source generation regime and the broadband nature of the system, circumferential waves could be generated and detected with a wide bandwidth and an excellent signal-to-noise ratio. A clear recognition of multimode wave forms is achieved by two-dimensional Fourier transform signal processing. Measurements were also made on a cylindrical shell with a crack-like defect which was simulated by an artificial groove {{on the surface of}} the <b>specimen.</b> The <b>interaction</b> of the circumferential waves with a defect in the inner or outer surface of the thin cylindrical shell has been studied. The results may lead to an application for defect identification at the inner or outer surface of thin cylindrical shells. (C) 2002 American Institute of Physics. status: publishe...|$|R

Such species require special collecting, sorting and handling techniques and different storage requirements to those routinely used for larger specimens. Similarly, the preparation of shells, opercula, radulae and animals poses some challenges for scanning electron microscopy (SEM). An overview of experiences with various techniques is presented, both positive and negative.

40|$|Interaction {{of crack}} growth in hybrid bodies {{subjected}} to cyclic loading is investigated using the coupled compact tension specimens model. Coupled CT specimens of 0. 45 % C steel, JIS S 45 C and aluminium alloy, A 2017 -T 4, individually precracked to their initial lengths are loaded by common pins {{in the grip}} of a fatigue machine. The crack propagation behaviour of coupled specimens fatigued under a stress ratio of 0. 05 is compared with that of a single specimen. It is found experimentally that crack growth rate of one of the coupled specimens is accelerated by the plasticity induced crack closure of another specimen. This behaviour is affected by the difference in residual plastic stretch on the crack wall in each <b>specimen.</b> An <b>interaction</b> curve for coupled hybrid specimens is theoretically predicted, and the interaction law is discussed. It is concluded that multiple ended fatigue cracks may propagate with a mechanism such that the increment of total energy release rate in a hybrid body is distributed to each crack with the ratio of the strain constraint factor...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} an investigation on interaction equation between the required flexural strength, M, and the required shear strength, V, of cold-formed C-channels with web holes and bearing stiffeners. The primarily shear condition test {{was employed to}} study total 8 back to back lipped C channel sections of 95 and 100 mm depth when bearing stiffeners and circular holes were placed at center and both ends of <b>specimens.</b> The <b>interaction</b> equation were evaluated via Direct Strength Method, DSM, {{in accordance with the}} American Iron and Steel Institute for the design of cold-formed steel structural members, AISI 2007. A nonlinear finite element model was developed and verified against the test results in terms of failure buckling modes. It was concluded that the M-V <b>interaction</b> equation for <b>specimens</b> with web stiffeners was conservative where these specimens experienced plastic failure mode rather than local (Msl) or distortional (Msd) buckling mode. Moreover, the results indicated that proposed M-V interaction equation calculated by local buckling strength (Msl) adequately predicted the behavior of specimens with circular web holes...|$|R
