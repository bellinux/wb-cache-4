50|$|A mallet {{is a kind}} of hammer, {{often made}} of rubber or {{sometimes}} wood, that is smaller than a maul or beetle, and usually has a relatively large head. The term is descriptive of the overall size and proportions of the tool, and not the materials it may be made of, though most mallets have <b>striking</b> <b>faces</b> that are softer than steel.|$|E
5000|$|Each {{head has}} one face which {{contacts}} the ball during the stroke. Putters may have two <b>striking</b> <b>faces,</b> {{as long as}} they are identical and symmetrical. Some chippers (a club similar in appearance to a double-sided putter but having a loft of 35-45 degrees) have two faces, but are not legal. Page 135 of the 2009 USGA rules of golf states: ...|$|E
50|$|Some dead blow hammers have {{replaceable}} <b>striking</b> <b>faces,</b> attached by screwing or pressing {{them into}} {{place on the}} main body of the hammer. These replaceable inserts allow selection of the appropriate hardness for the striking face to reduce damage to an object being hammered, while optimizing the energy transfer of impact. Also, worn or damaged inserts can be replaced without discarding the entire handtool.|$|E

50|$|The {{club head}} must {{have only one}} <b>striking</b> <b>face,</b> except that a putter may have two such faces if their {{characteristics}} are the same, and they are opposite each other.|$|R

5000|$|Most {{chippers}} have a loft {{greater than}} 10 degrees, {{which is the}} maximum loft permitted by the Rules of Golf for a club to be classed as a putter, so these clubs are actually classed as irons. To be legal for sanctioned play, a chipper cannot have any feature that is defined in the rules as allowable only on putters, e.g. two <b>striking</b> <b>faces</b> or a flat-topped [...] "putter grip". This disqualifies many chipper designs, {{but there are some}} USGA-conforming chippers, and non-conforming designs can still be used in non-sanctioned [...] "informal" [...] play.|$|E
5000|$|... While deploring the [...] "serious {{human rights}} violations" [...] under his government, Prime Minister Mark Rutte stated: [...] "Fidel Castro wrote world history. He spans in person a period from the Cuban missile crisis to the {{historic}} handshake between his brother and president Obama". He referred to him as [...] "one of the <b>striking</b> <b>faces</b> of the 20th century". Foreign Affairs Minister Bert Koenders described Castro as [...] "a leader of historic proportions", but regretted the [...] "dark side" [...] of his government {{in terms of human}} rights.|$|E
50|$|Putters are {{a special}} class of clubs with a loft not {{exceeding}} ten degrees, designed primarily {{to roll the}} ball along the grass, generally from a point on the putting green toward the hole. Contrary to popular belief, putters do have a loft (often 5° from truly perpendicular at impact) that helps to lift the ball from any indentation it has made. Newer putters also include grooves on the face to promote roll rather than a skid off the impact. This increases rolling distance and reduces bouncing over the turf. Putters are the only class of club allowed to have certain features, such as two <b>striking</b> <b>faces,</b> non-circular grip cross-sections, bent shafts or hosels, and appendages designed primarily to aid players' aim.|$|E
60|$|He was {{the most}} stalwart son of Texas I had seen in many a day, but neither his great stature nor his <b>striking</b> <b>face</b> {{accounted}} for something I felt--a something spiritual, vital, compelling, that drew me.|$|R
6000|$|At {{the first}} glance I {{recognized}} Jeffrey Aspern, and I {{was well aware}} that I flushed with the act. As she was watching me however I had the consistency to exclaim, [...] "What a <b>striking</b> <b>face!</b> Do tell me who it is." ...|$|R
6000|$|The girl {{flushed with}} pleasure. It was a <b>striking</b> <b>face,</b> with {{intelligent}} {{eyes and a}} mobile, sensitive mouth. [...] "Oh, yes," [...] she said, [...] "I could act all right. I feel it. But you don't {{get out of the}} chorus. Except at a price." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{moonlight}} {{was falling}} full upon his dark, <b>striking</b> <b>face.</b> Paul, with bent brows, scanned every feature of it intently. Father Adrian bore the scrutiny without flinching and without discomposure. Only once the colour mounted a little into his cheeks as {{the eyes of}} the two men met.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{felt that}} was Miss Lloyd {{as soon as}} I saw her, {{although}} I {{had never seen her}} before," [...] said Sylvia dreamily. [...] "I have been wishing to see her--for a certain reason. She has a very <b>striking</b> <b>face.</b> I should like to meet her--to know her." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{turns to}} a little counter, to get it. As his <b>striking</b> <b>face</b> is pale, and his action is evidently that of an enfeebled man, I remark that I fear he has been ill. It is not much, he courteously and gravely answers, though bad while it lasts: the fever.|$|R

50|$|The hosel is {{the portion}} of the club head to which the shaft attaches. Though largely ignored by players, hosel design is {{integral}} to the balance, feel and power of a club. Modern hosels are designed to place as little mass as possible {{over the top of the}} <b>striking</b> <b>face</b> of the club, which lowers the center of gravity of the club for better distance.|$|R
50|$|A putter is a club used in {{the sport}} of golf to make {{relatively}} short and low-speed strokes {{with the intention of}} rolling the ball into the hole from a short distance away. It is differentiated from the other clubs (typically irons and woods) by a clubhead with a very flat, low-profile, low-loft <b>striking</b> <b>face,</b> and by other features which are only allowed on putters, such as bent shafts, non-circular grips, and positional guides.|$|R
50|$|Related {{soft-faced}} hammers have heads {{faced with}} {{materials such as}} brass, lead, tightly wound rawhide, or plastic, although these faces are usually flat, not in a ball or wedge peen shape. These hammers usually have replaceable heads or faces, because they will deform, wear out, or break over time. They are used to prevent damage to a struck surface, and are graded {{by the weight of}} the head and by hardness of the <b>striking</b> <b>face.</b>|$|R
6000|$|There was {{something}} vaguely familiar {{to her in}} the voice of this Miss Bygrave, and, at the same time, in unaccountable contradiction, something strange to her as well. The face and figure of the young lady were entirely new to her. It was a <b>striking</b> <b>face,</b> and a <b>striking</b> figure; and if she had seen either at any former period, she would certainly have remembered it. Miss Bygrave was unquestionably a stranger; and yet-- ...|$|R
50|$|Like many {{students}} at the time, Guo Jian {{took part in the}} student protests and hunger <b>strikes.</b> <b>Facing</b> the soldiers together with the other students, he saw himself {{on both sides of the}} divide, both as a student and as the soldier. Guo Jian survived and graduated from university in July 1989, but his participation in the protest movement meant he was banned from being given employment through the formal job placement system for graduates at that time.|$|R
5000|$|Donald Laing - an old enemy for Strike's, who had {{actually}} boxed against Strike {{in the military}} and had bitten <b>Strike's</b> <b>face</b> after realizing that he was losing, leading to military discipline. Despite this, Laing was charming and able to convince others of his good character. Strike found that Laing had been physically abusing his wife and child and ended up having Laing arrested and convicted. This led Strike to suspect him of sending the severed leg wanting revenge.|$|R
60|$|Clavering {{very gently}} shook off her grasp, and Miss Schuyler almost admired {{him as he}} stood looking down upon her {{companion}} with the flickering firelight on his face. It was a <b>striking</b> <b>face,</b> and the smile in the dark eyes became it. Clavering had shaken off his furs, and the close-fitting jacket of dressed deerskin displayed his lean symmetry, for he had swung round in {{the entrance to the}} shanty and the shadows were black behind him.|$|R
60|$|It was {{a strange}} marriage. Behind Mel and Daren stood the red-faced, {{grinning}} driver, his coarse long coat covered with snow, and the simpering housemaid, respectful, yet glorifying in her share in this midnight romance. The old minister with his <b>striking</b> <b>face</b> and white hair, gravely turned the leaves of his book. No bridegroom ever wore such a stern, haggard countenance. The bride's face {{might have been a}} happier one, but it {{could not have been more}} beautiful.|$|R
50|$|A {{version of}} a leg drop, which is {{performed}} on an opponent who is standing, bent over, usually {{in the middle of}} the ring. This sees a wrestler bounces off the ropes, jumps, driving his leg(s) into the back of the head and the neck of the opponent, similar to a pair of scissors. Also known as a jumping axe kick or a butterfly kick. A corkscrew variation exists where the attacker twists during the <b>strike,</b> <b>facing</b> the floor while performing the scissor kick.|$|R
50|$|EN1621-1 assesses armor {{designed}} to protect the shoulder, elbow and forearm, hip, tail-bone, knee and lower leg regions. The test apparatus consists of a mass of 5 kg with a 40 mm x 30 mm <b>striking</b> <b>face,</b> dropped onto the sample mounted on top of a 50 mm radius hemispherical dome. The anvil is further mounted onto a load cell, allowing a measurement to be made of the force transmitted through the protector. The kinetic energy of the falling mass at impact must not exceed 50 J.|$|R
5000|$|Cornelius {{was accused}} in 1938 {{of being a}} [...] "communist {{accomplice}} of Sachs and for spending all her time organising black people." [...] However, {{she was able to}} successfully fight off attempts by Afrikaner nationalists who wanted {{to take control of the}} union. She became a founder of the National Union of Cigarette and Tobacco Workers in 1938, later leading a two-week strike in Rustenberg in September 1940. The strike in Rustenberg was [...] "heated" [...] and women in the <b>strike</b> <b>faced</b> tear gas and police attacks.|$|R
25|$|After {{retiring}} from the Assembly, Barbour appeared and gave speeches to support political friends. One observer declared: “Gov. Barbour presented an imposing appearance, with <b>striking</b> <b>face,</b> long, shaggy eyebrows, and head covered with silvery flowing locks; with a majestic and sonorous voice, he filled one’s conception of a Roman Senator {{in the last days}} of the Republic.” However, Barbour’s health began to decline, and he spent his final months at Barboursville. He died on June 7, 1842. Senator James Barbour was buried in the family cemetery on the estate.|$|R
50|$|Donald Laing - a Scot {{formerly}} in {{the military}} where he became an old enemy for Strike. Laing had actually boxed against Strike {{in the military}} and had bitten <b>Strike's</b> <b>face</b> after realizing that he was losing, leading to military discipline. Despite this, Laing was charming and able to convince others of his good character. However, investigating on his own, Strike found that Laing had been physically abusing his wife and child and ended up having Laing arrested and convicted, for which he served 10 years of a 16-year sentence.|$|R
40|$|This paper descries an {{experimental}} evaluation of lithium-zinc-silicate glass ceramics when {{used as the}} <b>strike</b> <b>face</b> of an armour system. It is shown that against soft cored 7. 62 mm rounds (lead or mild steel cores) glass ceramics offer protection at an areal density which is equal to or better than alumina faced systems. The lithium zinc silicate system has a relatively low hardness (Hv 600) when compared to conventional ceramics such as alumina (typically Hv 1300 - 1500). Consequently {{the performance of the}} glass ceramic system against hard cored projectiles is poor...|$|R

5000|$|Sember {{attended}} the University of Tulsa and {{was selected by}} the Cubs {{in the second round}} (31st overall) of the 1974 Major League Baseball draft. He struggled as a batsman, never exceeding a [...]251 batting average during his minor league career. Recalled from the Triple-A Wichita Aeros in August 1977, Sember debuted as a pinch hitter on August 18 and was called out on <b>strikes</b> <b>facing</b> Jerry Reuss of the Pittsburgh Pirates. Four days later, on August 22, Sember registered his first MLB hit, a single to center field off Charlie Williams of the San Francisco Giants.|$|R
