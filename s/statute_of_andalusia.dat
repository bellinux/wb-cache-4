5000|$|The amended {{version of}} the Catalan Statute prompts the State to allot {{investments}} in Catalonia according to Catalonia's own percentage contribution to the total Spanish GDP. The Autonomy <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>Andalusia,</b> a region that contributes less to Spain's GDP than the region of Catalonia contributes, requires it in turn to allocate state investments in proportion to its population (it is the largest Spanish Autonomous Community in terms of population). These requirements are legally binding, as they are enacted as part of Autonomy Statutes, which rank only below the Constitution itself. It is self-evident that, should all autonomous communities be allowed to establish their particular financing models upon the State, the total may add {{up to more than}} 100% and that would be inviable. Despite these changes having been proposed and approved by fellow members of the PSOE, former Finance Minister Pedro Solbes disagreed with this new trend of assigning state investment quotas to territories based on any given autonomous community custom requirement and has subsequently compared the task of planning the Spanish national budget to a sudoku.|$|E
40|$|The {{intention}} of this document is to highlight that {{the necessity of}} the public powers dispositions, not just national, European and international, should search for the balance between the maintenance of their patrimony, the respect {{to the past and}} the generational evolutional necessity, through integrational robustness of each other, with the finality of the economic development of their citizens. These parameters are obtained from the study of an Italian village - Sant'Angelo in Vado (PU) -, but they might be transposed to other territories, changing the legislation of that place. In the Spanish case, and more concretely andalusian, this study might be done equally applying the following legislation: 1978 Spanish Constitution, articles 49 and 149. 1. 28; Treaty of Spanish Annexation to European Community, 12 June 1985; Law 16 / 1985, 25 June, of Spanish Historical Patrimony; Organic Law 6 / 1981, 30 December of <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>Andalusia</b> Autonomy, article 12. 3; Law 14 / 2007, 26 November of Andalusian Historical Patrimony; Law 13 / 2011, 23 December of Tourism of Andalusia; Law 21 / 1992, 16 June, of Industry; Organic Law 6 / 2001, 21 December, of Universities...|$|E

40|$|This article draws a {{comparison}} between the different provisions that dealwith the allocation of powers system definition <b>of</b> the amended <b>statutes</b> ofAutonomy. From {{the analysis of the}} different regulations we appreciate thatthe <b>statutes</b> <b>of</b> Catalonia, <b>Andalusia</b> and Aragon contain norms regardingthe functional definition of competences. Nevertheless, in the case <b>of</b> theCatalan <b>Statute,</b> this provisions defining the allocation of powers system mustbe modulated according to the restricted adjudication of the decision 31 / 2010,ruled by the Constitutional Court, from June 28 th. This decision would eventuallyhave an impact on the adjudication <b>of</b> the <b>statutes</b> <b>of</b> Autonomy’sprovisions <b>of</b> <b>Andalusia</b> and Aragon. Other amended statutes (such as thepassed in Valencia, Balearic Islands, Castilia-Leon, Extremadura and Navarra) do not change the previous competence framework through a general definition,be it because of the logic of the previous system was kept or, ashappened in the case of Navarra, because the statute’s rules were not amendedin this point. The study also analyzes a specific field in the powers allocatedbetween the State and the Autonomous Community (such as the regulationson professional associations). This allows to conclude that the moreambitious amendment <b>of</b> the <b>statutes</b> <b>of</b> Autonomy concerning the principlesof the competences framework do not have almost any remarkable effectin the state’s legislative powers and the scope of decisions adopted by theAutonomous Community powers...|$|R

50|$|The first {{regional}} Governing Council, {{formed in}} July 1982, began {{to negotiate the}} transfer of functions and services for cultural matters in order to enable the powers conferred by the Spanish Constitution and the <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> Autonomy <b>of</b> <b>Andalusia,</b> {{while at the same}} time preparing a legislative package on heritage institutions with the collaboration of professional Archivists, Librarians and Museum Curators. In June 1983, with the Alhambra and the Generalife on the negotiating table, Bartolomé Ruiz was put in charge of the General Direction of Cultural Heritage following the resignation of the director up until that point, Juan Antonio Lacomba Avellán. He thus participated in the design and creation of the new historical heritage administration <b>of</b> <b>Andalusia.</b> He assisted in the processing and publication, by the Parliament <b>of</b> <b>Andalusia,</b> <b>of</b> Law 8/1983 of November 3 on Libraries (in effect until 2003), Law 2/1984 of January 9 on Museums (in effect until 2007) and Law 3/1984 of January 9 on Archives (in effect until 2011).

50|$|The {{honor is}} granted by {{agreement}} of the Governing Council of the Andalusian Autonomous Government, based on names proposed by the President of the Government, passed on by the president's office, the Consejería de la Presidencia. The title is strictly honorific, and does not entail any award of money. The names of those given the title are written in a registry known as the Libro de Oro de Andalucía ("Golden Book of Andalusia"). A medal is awarded with the inscription Hijo Predilecto de Andalucía, along with a silver plaque stating the reason for granting the award in this particular case. Normally at most ten medals are awarded each year, although the Governing Council may make exceptions to that. (In practice, as of 2009 that number has never been reached.) That count does not include awards given as a courtesy or in reciprocity, nor does it include posthumous awards. The honor is awarded in a public and solemn ceremony presided over by the President of the Government, {{in the presence of}} the Governing Council, and if possible coinciding with the regional holiday, the Día de Andalucía, February 28.

That article was set out for regions like Andalusia that had been prevented by the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War from adopting a <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> autonomy during the period of the Second Spanish Republic. Following this procedure, Andalusia was constituted as an autonomous community February 28, 1980. The regional holiday Día de Andalucía commemorates that date.

50|$|Within {{the various}} {{autonomous}} communities of Spain, comarcas {{are comparable to}} shires (or, in some countries, counties) in the English-speaking world.

5000|$|La bandera blanca y verde ( [...] , [...] "The Green and White Flag") is the {{official}} anthem <b>of</b> <b>Andalusia,</b> Spain, adopted under the first Andalusian <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> Autonomy. The lyrics were written by Blas Infante. The music for the anthem <b>of</b> <b>Andalusia</b> was composed by {{the former director of}} the municipal band of Sevilla José del Castillo Díaz. The origins of the music are vaguely inspired on the Santo Dios, a religious cantic widely spread in rural Andalusia, usually sung by peasants while reaping their crops. It is believed that Blas Infante suggested the music to José del Castillo. The melody of the anthem is Castillo's original though. After the Spanish Civil War, the original music scores were destroyed, and only a manuscript for piano is conserved. The composer Manuel Castillo improved José del Castillo's version.|$|R
