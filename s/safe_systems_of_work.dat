40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} an empirically based {{study of the}} manner in which Victorian Magistrates Courts {{constructed}} occupational health and safety (OHS) issues when hearing prosecutions for offences under the Industrial Safety, Health and Welfare Act 1981 (the ISHWA) and the Occupational Health and Safety Act 1985 (OHSA) from 1983 to 1991. These statutes established OHS standards for employers and other relevant parties. The State government enforced these standards through an OHS inspectorate which had a range of enforcement powers, including prosecution. After outlining the historical development of Victoria’s OHS legislation, the magistracy’s historical role in its enforcement, and the development of an enforcement culture in which inspectors viewed prosecution as a last resort, the study shows how the key provisions of the ISHWA and OHSA required occupiers of workplaces and employers to provide and maintain <b>safe</b> <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> <b>work,</b> including the guarding of dangerous machinery. Using a wide range of empirical research methods and legal materials, it shows how the enforcement policies, procedures and practices of the inspectorate heavily slanted inspectors workplace investigations and hence prosecutions towards a restricted and often superficial, analysis of incidents (or “events”) most of which involved injuries on machinery. There was evidence, however, that after the establishment of the Central Investigation Unit in 1989 cases were more thoroughly investigated and prosecuted. From 1990 the majority of prosecutions were taken under the employer’s general duty provisions, and by 1991 there was evidence that prosecutions were focusing on matters other than machinery guarding...|$|E
30|$|Risk {{identification}} {{is the first}} step in the management process and aims to capture and record all potential causes of hazards. Risk evaluation entails assessing the magnitude of each risk based on its probability of occurrence and impact. This can be achieved using qualitative or quantities methods. The aim of the risk evaluation phase is to prioritize the risks separating the acceptable ones from those that will require treatment (HSE 2015 a). The results from the risk evaluation are then used to develop adequate measures at the risk response planning. In setting up responses to the evaluated risks, the response strategy usually employs a sequential hierarchy of measures that starts with eliminating the risk as a first priority, with the subsequent steps being to reduce, isolate, control, and implement <b>safe</b> <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> or as a last resort employ the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) (Butler 2014). The risk monitoring and controlling phase implements either proactive routine inspections or reactive examination after an incident has occurred. It aims to ensure the effectiveness of the implemented risk management measures. In combination, the phases of risk management provide a proven approach for risk prevention and reduction. Therefore, managing safety risks in the engineering industry requires knowledge and skills in the implementation of all the phases of the risk management process. It is expected that VE research studies for safety education and training address the needs of this process by covering all its core three phases (risk identification, risk evaluation, risk response planning). This paper also verifies this hypothesis by mapping the identified studies against the key phases of the risk management process.|$|E

Normally the express passenger train would have passed Kirtlebridge well before the goods train required to shunt. On this occasion the delay to it earlier in its journey meant that the unsafe working led to tragedy.|$|R
3000|$|During our {{research}} process we encountered various instances of workers not knowing, or not having learned {{information that they}} identified as being crucial to safe working, but that could be simply embedded in a video. However there was an added element to this, which again brings to the fore the specific nature of digital video and the impact on learning that the constitution of a digital material environment might enable. While some of the CodeSafe videos are accessible only through the specific platform {{that is used by}} the company that has commissioned their work, others are freely available online. Examples of some of the methods that CodeSafe has video recorded in collaboration with the Master Builders Association in Australia, can be viewed on the Association’s web site, here [URL] (accessed 23 rd November 2015). As it states there, ‘The procedures demonstrated in these guidelines were developed by undertaking an appraisal of <b>safe</b> <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> for each topic, consulting with workers who regularly undertake these tasks and refining these processes for demonstration’. However it is not only such associations who are involved in sharing videos, but rather, as one participant described, such systems also enable workers to share videos amongst themselves, by sending an sms link to a colleague who has asked how to perform a task. Significantly however, worker sharing begins to constitute more than their empowerment through knowledge sharing in the video making process. Rather the possibility to share videos in a context where sharing written regulatory documents is not feasible, enables workers to possess and adhere to authoritative accounts of how to undertake a task safely in contexts where they might have been asked by a manager to work in a less safe way as discussed in Video Ethnography Clip F.

40|$|The {{established}} {{approach to}} safety management {{has failed to}} handle socio-technical systems that have become more complex. The main argument is this approach is based on assumptions that systems are protected against accidents by barriers (well-trained people, redundant mechanisms and safety devices, and procedures and <b>safe</b> <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> <b>work).</b> Complex systems, such as maintenance, are actually labour intensive; maintenance staff often works under pressure to finish tasks as rapidly as possible. They continuously adapt and make adjustments using available resources, time, knowledge, and competence to achieve success. Thus, they are accidents prone. Human factors inherent to maintenance accidents are most times difficult to identify. Research in this area in {{the oil and gas}} industry in maintenance management is limited in comparison to the aviation and nuclear sectors. Therefore, it has been suggested to overcome this lack by exploring the maintenance system and identifying appropriate methods and tools that lead a system to safety excellence. Resilience engineering (RE) approach has been found the suitable solution. Moreover, four system abilities (cornerstones of RE: ability to respond, to monitor, to anticipate, and to learn) have been identified to characterise the resilience of a system; if these abilities are known and increased, it will make the system As High Resilient As Possible (AHRAP). However, there is a need to bridge between RE theory and practice. Particularly, a tool that measures these abilities lacks in {{the oil and gas industry}}, specifically within the maintenance system. In doing so, a framework based on a Gap Analysis (GA) was outlined. A tool, the MAintenance System Resilience Assessment Tool- MASRAT, was developed to assess current system resilience and identify strategies for improvement to achieve safety excellence. The maintenance system of SONATRACH was explored by the analysis of the system documentation and processes, interviews with maintenance staff, questionnaires, field observations, storytelling, and functional analysis. MASRAT has been validated by means of congruency and principal components analysis, PCA (content validity), and Cronbach’s alpha (reliability). An expert panel testing was carried out to test its usability. The exploration of the system came up with a snapshot of daily activities as well as a better understanding of the maintenance system. The study identified the most significant human factors (resources, time pressure, and supervision/coordination) and their probable impact on plant safety. The elements of the system were found tightly coupled, hence the system complex. Stories describing the continuous adaptations of people to achieve assigned objectives were collected. On the other hand, MASRAT was validated. All items were rated above 0. 75 in congruency test. The results of PCA for the three selected factors confirmed the items may be clustered after extraction into four components which interpretation represents the four cornerstones of RE. The analysis showed MASRAT is reproducible. Cronbach’s alpha results were found higher than what is required (0. 7). MASRAT was found usable by maintenance expert panel. It was used to measure the maintenance department resilience. Strategies that may lead the system from current maturity level to excellence were identified. Eventually, recommendations were made to management to be implemented both at corporate and department levels. For the first time, the maintenance department resilience of petroleum assets was measured to fill in the gap between RE theory and practice. Besides, this can be of benefit to the petroleum industry by a better knowledge of the maintenance working environment and human factors impact on safety and by profiles determination and improvement strategies identification.

2500|$|UK labour law's primary concern, {{particularly}} {{under the}} Employment Rights Act 1996, {{is to ensure}} that every working person has a minimum charter of rights in their workplace. Traditionally it draws a divide between self-employed people, who are free to contract for any terms they wish, and employees, whose employers are responsible for complying with labour laws. UK courts and statutes, however, use a number of different terms for different rights, including [...] "worker", [...] "employee", [...] "jobholder", [...] "apprentice" [...] or someone with an [...] "employment relation". A [...] "worker", for example, is entitled to a minimum wage of £7.50 per hour, 28 statutory minimum days of holiday, enrolment in a pension plan, a <b>safe</b> <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>work,</b> not to mention the right to equal treatment and anti-discrimination that also apply to consumers and public services. An [...] "employee" [...] has all those rights, and also the right to a written contract of employment, time off for pregnancy or child care, reasonable notice before a fair dismissal and a redundancy payment, and the duty to contribute to the National Insurance fund and pay income tax. The scope of the terms [...] "worker", [...] "employee", and others, are more or less left to the courts to construe according to the context of its use in a statute, but someone is essentially entitled to more rights if they are in a weaker position and thus lack bargaining power. English courts view an employment contract as involving a relation of mutual trust and confidence, which allows them to develop and enlarge the remedies available for workers and employers alike when one side acts out of bad faith.|$|R

Reflecting more recent priorities, the House of Lords held employers have a duty to inform their employees of their workplace pension rights, although a lower court stopped short of requiring employers to give advice on qualifying for workplace disability benefits. The key implied term is the duty of good faith, or [...] "mutual trust and confidence". This is a flexible concept that is applied in a broad variety of circumstances leading to remedies in damages or an injunction. Examples include requiring that employers do not act in an authoritarian manner, do not call employees names behind their back, do not treat workers unequally when upgrading pay, do not run the company as a front for international crime, or do not exercise discretion to award a bonus capriciously. There has been disagreement among judges {{about the extent to which}} the core implied term of mutual trust and confidence can be 'contracted out of', with the House of Lords having held that the parties may when they are [...] "free" [...] to do so, while others approach the question as a matter of construction of the agreement which is within exclusive judicial competence to define.|$|R
