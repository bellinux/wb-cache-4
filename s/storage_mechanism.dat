25|$|In eyeblink {{conditioning}} in rabbits, nonsynaptic changes occurred {{throughout the}} dorsal hippocampus. This indicates that although excitability changes alone {{are not enough}} to explain memory storage processes, nonsynaptic plasticity might be a <b>storage</b> <b>mechanism</b> for phases of memory limited by time. Nonsynaptic changes influence other types of plasticity involved with memory. For example, a nonsynaptic change such as depolarization of the resting membrane potential resulting from conditional learning could cause synaptic plasticity in future learning.|$|E
25|$|Changes in excitability from {{learning}} {{that act as}} part of the memory trace do so as primers to initiate further changes in the neurons or by a short-term <b>storage</b> <b>mechanism</b> for short-term memory. Nonsynaptic plasticity can emerge during learning as a result of cellular processes, although the timing, persistence, and the relationship between nonsynaptic plasticity and synaptic output are all poorly understood. Studies have shown that nonsynaptic plasticity plays an indirect but important role in the formation of memories. Learning-induced nonsynaptic plasticity is associated with soma depolarization.|$|E

2500|$|Evercookies, {{created by}} Samy Kamkar, are JavaScript-based {{applications}} which produce cookies {{in a web}} browser that actively [...] "resist" [...] deletion by redundantly copying themselves in different forms on the user's machine (e.g., Flash Local Shared Objects, various HTML5 <b>storage</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> window.name caching, etc.), and resurrecting copies that are missing or expired. Evercookie accomplishes this by storing the cookie data in several types of <b>storage</b> <b>mechanisms</b> that {{are available on the}} local browser. It has the ability to store cookies in over ten types of <b>storage</b> <b>mechanisms</b> so that once they are on one's computer they will never be gone. Additionally, if evercookie has found the user has removed any of the types of cookies in question, it recreates them using each mechanism available. Evercookies are one type of zombie cookie.

25|$|Btrieve {{is not a}} {{relational}} database management system (RDBMS). Early descriptions of Btrieve {{referred to it as}} a record manager (though Pervasive initially used the term navigational database but later changed this to transactional database) because it only deals with the underlying record creation, data retrieval, record updating and data deletion primitives. It uses ISAM as its underlying indexing and <b>storage</b> <b>mechanism.</b> A key part of Pervasive's architecture is the use of a MicroKernel Database Engine, which allows different database backends to be modularised and integrated easily into their DBMS package, Pervasive.SQL. This has enabled them to support both their Btrieve navigational database engine and an SQL-based engine, Scalable SQL.|$|E
2500|$|Entropy is conserved for a {{reversible}} process. A {{reversible process}} {{is one that}} does not deviate from thermodynamic equilibrium, while producing the maximum work. Any process which happens quickly enough to deviate from thermal equilibrium cannot be reversible. [...] In these cases energy is lost to heat, total entropy increases, and the potential for maximum work {{to be done in the}} transition is also lost. [...] More specifically, total entropy is conserved in a reversible process and not conserved in an irreversible process. For example, in the Carnot cycle, while the heat flow from the hot reservoir to the cold reservoir represents an increase in entropy, the work output, if reversibly and perfectly stored in some energy <b>storage</b> <b>mechanism,</b> represents a decrease in entropy that could be used to operate the heat engine in reverse and return to the previous state, thus the total entropy change is still zero at all times if the entire process is reversible. [...] An irreversible process increases entropy.|$|E

Depending on which button was being held down on the input console at that time, the switch connected the trackball to one of 96 pairs of servomotors connected to potentiometers that were used a <b>storage</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The output of the potentiometers was sent back to the input consoles, creating a [...] "blip" [...] on the screen that matched the underlying radar data but did not move, allowing the operators to choose which blips required updating. [...] In the prototype versions, there were only three input stations allowing a total of 24 targets to be tracked, but they could also read up to eight more inputs from external sources, nominally data from other ships. A production version would have more input stations to fully expand the capabilities of the CDE.|$|E

2500|$|If {{blood glucose}} levels are high, the body needs {{a way to}} store the excess glucose. [...] After being {{converted}} to G6P, the molecule {{can be turned into}} glucose-1-phosphate by phosphoglucomutase. [...] Glucose-1-phosphate can then be combined with uridine triphosphate (UTP) to form UDP-glucose, driven by the hydrolysis [...] of UTP, releasing phosphate. [...] Now, the activated UDP-glucose can add to a growing glycogen molecule with the help of glycogen synthase. [...] This is a very efficient <b>storage</b> <b>mechanism</b> for glucose since it costs the body only 1 ATP to store the 1 glucose molecule and virtually no energy to remove it from storage. [...] It {{is important to note that}} glucose-6-phosphate is an allosteric activator of glycogen synthase, which makes sense because when the level of glucose is high the body should store the excess glucose as glycogen. [...] On the other hand, glycogen synthase is inhibited when it is phosphorylated by protein kinase during times of high stress or low levels of blood glucose, via hormone induction by glucagon or adrenaline.|$|E
2500|$|Since the {{specific}} energy of uncompressed hydrogen gas is very low, denser storage methods {{are of interest}} for energy storage. [...] MOFs attract attention as materials for adsorptive hydrogen storage because of their high specific surface areas and chemically tunable structures. Hydrogen is taken up by MOFs by adsorption. Compared to an empty gas cylinder, a MOF-filled gas cylinder can store more gas because of adsorption that takes place {{on the surface of}} MOFs. (Note that molecular hydrogen adsorbs to the surface; atomic hydrogen does not.) Furthermore, MOFs are free of dead-volume, so there is almost no loss of storage capacity as a result of space-blocking by non-accessible volume. Also, MOFs have a fully reversible uptake-and-release behavior: since the <b>storage</b> <b>mechanism</b> is based primarily on physisorption. No large activation barriers are required when liberating the adsorbed hydrogen. The storage capacity of a MOF is limited by the liquid-phase density of hydrogen because the benefits provided by MOFs can be realized only if the hydrogen is in its gaseous state.|$|E

40|$|Supercapacitors {{are being}} {{developed}} {{for a variety of}} applications ranging from electric vehicles to portable electronic devices due to their high power densities and long cycle lifes. While the markets for supercapacitors are growing fast, they are small. To achieve greater market penetration, the energy densities for these devices will have to be increased. Efforts to achieve this require new materials that possess high capacitances and wide voltage windows. Early transition metal carbides and nitrides including VN and Mo 2 N are very attractive candidates given their high electronic conductivities and specific capacitances, and ability to be synthesized in high surface area form. Research described in this dissertation aimed to characterize the charge <b>storage</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for these materials as part of a strategy to fully exploit their properties. We isolated the active ions involved in the charge <b>storage</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> defined the active sites for charge storage, quantified the extent of pseudocapacitance and active ion insertion, and proposed overall charge <b>storage</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for these materials. Additionally, we demonstrated methods to remove the passivation layer, which impedes access of the electrolyte ions to the surface. Finally, we were able to increase the energy density by nearly a factor of four by using ionic liquid based electrolytes instead of aqueous electrolytes. The results presented in this dissertation {{contribute to the development of}} novel chemistries and provide a scientific basis for the design of high-energy density supercapacitors based on early transition-metal carbides and nitrides...|$|R
