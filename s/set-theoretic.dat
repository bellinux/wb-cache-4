25|$|Beginning in 1935, a {{group of}} {{prominent}} mathematicians collaborated under the pseudonym Nicolas Bourbaki to publish a series of encyclopedic mathematics texts. These texts, written in an austere and axiomatic style, emphasized rigorous presentation and <b>set-theoretic</b> foundations. Terminology coined by these texts, such as the words bijection, injection, and surjection, and the <b>set-theoretic</b> foundations the texts employed, were widely adopted throughout mathematics.|$|E

25|$|<b>Set-theoretic</b> {{topology}} studies {{questions of}} general topology that are <b>set-theoretic</b> in nature or that require advanced methods of set theory for their solution. Many of these theorems {{are independent of}} ZFC, requiring stronger axioms for their proof. A famous problem is the normal Moore space question, a question in general topology that {{was the subject of}} intense research. The answer to the normal Moore space question was eventually proved to be independent of ZFC.|$|E
25|$|Several <b>set-theoretic</b> {{principles}} about determinacy {{stronger than}} Borel determinacy are studied in descriptive set theory. They {{are closely related}} to large cardinal axioms.|$|E
25|$|Several set theorists {{followed}} this approach and actively searched for axioms {{that may be}} considered as true for heuristic reasons and that would decide the continuum hypothesis. Many large cardinal axioms were studied, but the hypothesis always remained independent from them. Other types of axioms were considered, {{but none of them}} has reached consensus on the continuum hypothesis yet. Recent work by Hamkins proposes a more flexible alternative: a <b>set-theoretic</b> multiverse allowing free passage between <b>set-theoretic</b> universes that satisfy the continuum hypothesis and other universes that do not.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} categorification {{is an attempt}} to replace <b>set-theoretic</b> notions by category-theoretic ones. In particular, {{according}} to this idea, sets are replaced by categories, while functions between sets are replaced by functors.|$|E
25|$|The {{study of}} Œ≤N, and in {{particular}} N*, is a major area of modern <b>set-theoretic</b> topology. The major results motivating this are Parovicenko's theorems, essentially characterising its behaviour under the assumption of the continuum hypothesis.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} where C is VectF, the {{category}} of vector spaces over a field F, this definition is equivalent to a linear representation. Likewise, a <b>set-theoretic</b> representation is just a representation of G {{in the category of}} sets.|$|E
25|$|General {{topology}} is {{the branch}} of topology dealing with the basic <b>set-theoretic</b> definitions and constructions used in topology.

25|$|Modal logics include {{additional}} modal operators, such as {{an operator}} which states that a particular formula is not only true, but necessarily true. Although modal logic is not often used to axiomatize mathematics, {{it has been used}} to study the properties of first-order provability (Solovay 1976) and <b>set-theoretic</b> forcing (Hamkins and L√∂we 2007).|$|E
25|$|With {{a bit of}} <b>set-theoretic</b> care ùêçùê® can be {{equipped}} with a topology where the open sets are unions of open intervals (indexed by proper sets) and continuous functions can be defined. An equivalent of Cauchy sequences {{can be defined as}} well although they have to be indexed by the class of ordinals; these will always converge, but the limit may be either a number or a gap.|$|E
25|$|The {{details of}} this {{characterization}} depend on the choice of <b>set-theoretic</b> axiomatization used to formalize mathematics. In particular, in models of set theory for which Martin's axiom is true and the continuum hypothesis is false, the class of bipartite graphs in this characterization can {{be replaced by a}} single forbidden minor. However, for models in which the continuum hypothesis is true, this class contains graphs which are incomparable with each other in the minor ordering.|$|E
25|$|The hyperreals can be {{developed}} either axiomatically or by more constructively oriented methods. The essence of the axiomatic approach is to assert (1) the existence {{of at least one}} infinitesimal number, and (2) the validity of the transfer principle. In the following subsection we give a detailed outline of a more constructive approach. This method allows one to construct the hyperreals if given a <b>set-theoretic</b> object called an ultrafilter, but the ultrafilter itself cannot be explicitly constructed.|$|E
25|$|Fibred {{category}} admitting no splitting: A group G can {{be considered}} as a category with one object and the elements of G as the morphisms, composition of morphisms being given by the group law. A group homomorphism f: G ‚Üí H can then be considered as a functor, which makes G into a H-category. It can be checked that in this set-up all morphisms in G are cartesian; hence G is fibred over H precisely when f is surjective. A splitting in this setup is a (<b>set-theoretic)</b> section of f which commutes strictly with composition, or in other words a section of f which is also a homomorphism. But as is well known in group theory, this is not always possible (one can take the projection in a non-split group extension).|$|E
25|$|Husserl never {{claimed that}} {{mathematics}} could {{or should be}} grounded in part-whole rather than set theory. Lesniewski consciously derived his mereology {{as an alternative to}} set theory as a foundation of mathematics, but did not work out the details. Goodman and Quine (1947) tried to develop the natural and real numbers using the calculus of individuals, but were mostly unsuccessful; Quine did not reprint that article in his Selected Logic Papers. In a series of chapters in the books he published in the last decade of his life, Richard Milton Martin set out to do what Goodman and Quine had abandoned 30 years prior. A recurring problem with attempts to ground mathematics in mereology is how to build up the theory of relations while abstaining from <b>set-theoretic</b> definitions of the ordered pair. Martin argued that Eberle's (1970) theory of relational individuals solved this problem.|$|E
25|$|Commutative algebra (in {{the form}} of {{polynomial}} rings and their quotients, used {{in the definition of}} algebraic varieties) has always been a part of algebraic geometry. However, in the late 1950s, algebraic varieties were subsumed into Alexander Grothendieck's concept of a scheme. Their local objects are affine schemes or prime spectra, which are locally ringed spaces, which form a category that is antiequivalent (dual) to the category of commutative unital rings, extending the duality between the category of affine algebraic varieties over a field k, and the category of finitely generated reduced k-algebras. The gluing is along the Zariski topology; one can glue within the category of locally ringed spaces, but also, using the Yoneda embedding, within the more abstract category of presheaves of sets over the category of affine schemes. The Zariski topology in the <b>set-theoretic</b> sense is then replaced by a Zariski topology in the sense of Grothendieck topology. Grothendieck introduced Grothendieck topologies having in mind more exotic but geometrically finer and more sensitive examples than the crude Zariski topology, namely the √©tale topology, and the two flat Grothendieck topologies: fppf and fpqc. Nowadays some other examples have become prominent, including the Nisnevich topology. Sheaves can be furthermore generalized to stacks in the sense of Grothendieck, usually with some additional representability conditions, leading to Artin stacks and, even finer, Deligne-Mumford stacks, both often called algebraic stacks.|$|E
25|$|The {{study of}} space {{originates}} with geometry‚Äì in particular, Euclidean geometry, which combines space and numbers, and encompasses the well-known Pythagorean theorem. Trigonometry is {{the branch of}} mathematics that deals with relationships between the sides and the angles of triangles and with the trigonometric functions. The modern study of space generalizes these ideas to include higher-dimensional geometry, non-Euclidean geometries (which {{play a central role}} in general relativity) and topology. Quantity and space both play a role in analytic geometry, differential geometry, and algebraic geometry. Convex and discrete geometry were developed to solve problems in number theory and functional analysis but now are pursued with an eye on applications in optimization and computer science. Within differential geometry are the concepts of fiber bundles and calculus on manifolds, in particular, vector and tensor calculus. Within algebraic geometry is the description of geometric objects as solution sets of polynomial equations, combining the concepts of quantity and space, and also the study of topological groups, which combine structure and space. Lie groups are used to study space, structure, and change. Topology in all its many ramifications may have been the greatest growth area in 20th-century mathematics; it includes point-set topology, <b>set-theoretic</b> topology, algebraic topology and differential topology. In particular, instances of modern-day topology are metrizability theory, axiomatic set theory, homotopy theory, and Morse theory. Topology also includes the now solved Poincar√© conjecture, and the still unsolved areas of the Hodge conjecture. Other results in geometry and topology, including the four color theorem and Kepler conjecture, have been proved only with the help of computers.|$|E

500|$|An Euler diagram is a {{diagrammatic}} {{means of}} representing sets and their relationships. Euler diagrams consist of simple closed curves (usually circles) {{in the plane}} that depict sets. [...] Each Euler curve divides the plane into two regions or [...] "zones": the interior, which symbolically represents {{the elements of the}} set, and the exterior, which represents all elements that are not members of the set. [...] The sizes or shapes of the curves are not important; the significance of the diagram is in how they overlap. The spatial relationships between the regions bounded by each curve (overlap, containment or neither) corresponds to <b>set-theoretic</b> relationships (intersection, subset and disjointness). [...] Curves whose interior zones do not intersect represent disjoint sets. [...] Two curves whose interior zones intersect represent sets that have common elements; the zone inside both curves represents the set of elements common to both sets (the intersection of the sets). [...] A curve that is contained completely within the interior zone of another represents a subset of it. Euler diagrams were incorporated as part of instruction in set theory as part of the new math movement in the 1960s. Since then, they have also been adopted by other curriculum fields such as reading.|$|E
