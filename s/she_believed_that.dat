5|$|Like {{all members}} of the House of Habsburg, Maria Theresa was a Roman Catholic, and a devout one. <b>She</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> {{religious}} unity was necessary for a peaceful public life and explicitly rejected the idea of religious toleration. However, she never allowed the Church to interfere with what she considered to be prerogatives of a monarch and kept Rome at arm's length. She controlled the selection of archbishops, bishops and abbots.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of Selena's {{full-length}} Spanish albums Selena (1989) and Ven Conmigo (1990), which included Tejano and other Mexican pop styles, she decided that her next recording would feature an English-language song. <b>She</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> such a song would convince EMI Records' chairman Charles Koppelman that {{she was ready to}} release a crossover album. EMI had wanted her to acquire a larger fan base before launching her crossover career. In spite of this, Selena included the song on Entre a Mi Mundo.|$|E

5|$|From 1951 to 1963, Stevens {{served as}} {{vice-president}} of the Lucy Stone League, though she struggled with maintaining militancy. Stevens was not anti-male, rather pro-female. She {{did not follow}} a belief that for women to succeed, men had to be omitted; rather, <b>she</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> collaboration with men was essential. In her last years, Stevens supported the establishment of feminist studies as a legitimate field of academic inquiry in American universities and tried to establish a Lucy Stone Chair of Feminism at Radcliffe College.|$|E
5|$|Further {{inspiration}} for the album came from Madonna's exploration of other cultures and art, literature, and music, referencing them in the songs. <b>She</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> the tracks should stand on their own, so that one could sing them accompanied with just a guitar. Madonna {{enlisted the help of}} her daughter Lourdes and son Rocco, calling them her A advisers. They visited night clubs and were able to provide her with news about up-and-coming music and artists, helping to create the sounds she gravitated towards for the album.|$|E
50|$|Livia Arizmendi (Villain) Cesar's {{second wife}} and a retired actress.

5|$|Gaga further {{clarified}} {{the ideas}} behind The Fame, and her inspirations and visions for the album. <b>She</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> {{the most important}} thing missing from contemporary pop music was the combination of the visual imagery of the artist with the music. Gaga incorporated theatrics in her live performances of the songs from the album. Hence she hoped that people would take notice of the performance art, which she was trying to bring back with the album and its music; according to her, the music put the lifestyle in front of it.|$|E
5|$|In January 1985, Collins renewed her {{push for}} {{additional}} education funding and changes by appointing herself {{secretary of the}} state Education and Humanities Cabinet. Following the announcement, Collins and several key legislators {{held a series of}} meetings in every county, advocating for her proposed changes and seeking information about what types of changes the state's citizens desired. At the meetings, Collins was careful to separate the issues of her proposed education plan and potential tax increases. <b>She</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> opposition to increased taxes had prevented her previous package from being enacted.|$|E
5|$|Lawrie and Vinson {{approved}} the models. On January 8, Ross telephoned the commission, informing them of this. With Sinnock ill (he died in 1947) and the March of Dimes campaign under way, Ross did {{not wait for}} a full meeting of the commission, but authorized the start of production.

5|$|Outside her {{political}} duties Bessie, a keen fan of boxing, accepted the honorary {{presidency of the}} Professional Boxers' Association, and was a passionate defender of the sport. Her enthusiasm arose in part from her experiences as a juvenile court magistrate; <b>she</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> the sport fostered character and mutual respect. She was frequently at odds with her parliamentary colleague Edith Summerskill, a physician who wrote the anti-boxing tract The Ignoble Art, and campaigned for the sport's abolition.|$|E
5|$|Barrucand {{dispatched}} Eberhardt {{to report}} on the aftereffects of the 2September 1903 Battle of El-Moungar. She stayed with French Foreign Legion soldiers and met Hubert Lyautey, the French officer in charge of Oran, at their headquarters. Eberhardt and Lyautey became friends and, due to her knowledge of Islam and Arabic, she became a liaison between him and the local Arab people. While Eberhardt never ceased protesting against any repressive actions undertaken by the French administration, <b>she</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> Lyautey's approach, which focused on diplomacy rather than military force, would bring peace to the region. Although details are unclear, it is generally accepted that Eberhardt also engaged in espionage for Lyautey. Concerned about a powerful marabout in the Atlas Mountains, Lyautey sent her to meet with him in 1904.|$|E

Dalton advocated exercise for girls, including swimming and shooting. <b>She</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> women {{had the right to}} suffrage, education, property, control over their earned money, and custody of their children. She was a strong believer in moral temperance and argued that parental hypocrisy caused many children to imitate their parents' actions. She said that it was a woman's religious duty to educate herself. She urged women to take advantage of public resources like libraries and museums, or if time did not permit, to enlarge their minds at Relief Society meetings.|$|E

At the time, <b>she</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> her fanbase was predominately between the ages of 11 and 18.|$|E
5|$|Germanicus {{had died}} in AD 19, in {{somewhat}} suspicious circumstances in Syria. Following his death, his wife Agrippina the Elder returned to Rome with their six children and became increasingly involved {{with a group of}} senators who opposed the growing power of Sejanus. Her relations with Tiberius became increasingly fraught, as she made it clear that <b>she</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> he was {{responsible for the death of}} Germanicus. The climate was further poisoned by the hatred that Tiberius' mother Livia Drusilla (the widow of Augustus) felt for her, since Agrippina's ambition, to be the mother of emperors and thus Rome's first woman, was an open secret. To Sejanus, Agrippina's sons Nero Caesar, Drusus Caesar and Caligula were a threat to his power.|$|E
5|$|In 1950 Hicks {{and other}} women based on the East coast of the United States began meeting in an organization, the goal of which was to advance female {{engineers}} and increase female participation in engineering.

5|$|Naomi Canning is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the Australian soap opera Neighbours, played by Morgana O'Reilly. Naomi was introduced as {{the daughter of}} established character Sheila Canning (Colette Mann), after producers decided they wanted to explore her background further. O'Reilly filmed her first audition in her garden in Sydney, before flying to Melbourne to audition in the studio. She competed with five other actresses for the part, but <b>she</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> she was meant to get the role as Naomi is her middle name. A week after the second audition, O'Reilly's agent informed her that she had won the role. O'Reilly then relocated to Melbourne and began filming her first scenes in November 2013. She made her first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 25 March 2014. The character departed on 2 October 2015, following O'Reilly's decision to pursue new acting roles.|$|E
5|$|The {{historian}} Ronald Hutton {{stated that}} the Mari Lwyd tradition appeared to have become defunct in the early 20th century. In {{the middle of that}} century it was revived in Llangynwyd. In 1967, Lois Blake published a letter in the journal English Dance and Song in which she noted that the Mari Lwyd appeared each Christmas Eve at the Barley Mow Inn at Graig Penllyn, near Cowbridge, where a man named John Williams had kept the custom alive for the past sixty years. Blake also explained that <b>she</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> the custom was still performed at several villages in the Maesteg area of Glamorgan. During the 1970s, Hole commented that the tradition was still found in Glamorganshire and Carmathenshire.|$|E
5|$|Hindley was not arrested with Brady, but {{she demanded}} {{to go with}} him to the police station, {{accompanied}} by her dog, Puppet, to which the police agreed. Hindley was questioned about the events surrounding Evans's death, but she refused to make any statement beyond claiming that it had been an accident. As the police had no evidence that Hindley was involved in Evans's murder, she was allowed to go home, on the condition that she return the next day for further questioning. Hindley was at liberty for four days following Brady's arrest, during which time she went to her employer's premises and asked to be dismissed, so that she would be eligible for unemployment benefits. While in the office where Brady worked, she found some papers belonging to him in an envelope that she claimed she did not open, which she burned in an ashtray. <b>She</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> they were plans for bank robberies, {{nothing to do with the}} murders. On 11 October, Hindley was charged as an accessory to the murder of Edward Evans and was remanded at Risley.|$|E
