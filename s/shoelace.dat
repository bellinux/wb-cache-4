5|$|Truce {{terms are}} {{recorded}} {{as having been}} used in the following circumstances; being out of breath, having a stitch, a <b>shoelace</b> being undone, fear of clothes being damaged, needing to go to the lavatory, checking the time, wanting to discuss or clarify rules during a fight or game, or one combatant wanting to remove their spectacles or jacket before continuing. It does not mean to surrender, although it may sometimes be used in preparation to surrendering. Truce terms are only used within a specific age group, have little currency outside that group and are by and large abandoned by the age of 10 or 11 years. However, research into early recorded use of these terms found examples of some of these terms being used as a sign of surrender in battle or adult fights or quarrels as late as the 18th century.|$|E
5|$|Accompanied by Brady, Hindley {{approached}} 12-year-old John Kilbride in {{the early}} evening of 23 November 1963, at a market in Ashton-under-Lyne and offered him a lift home on the pretext that his parents would be worried about him being out so late. With the added inducement of a bottle of sherry, Kilbride readily agreed to get into the Ford Anglia car that Hindley had hired. Brady told Kilbride that the sherry was at their home, and they would have to make a detour to collect it. On the way he suggested that they take another detour, to search for a glove he said that Hindley had lost on the moor. When they reached the moor Brady took the child with him while Hindley waited in the car. Brady sexually assaulted Kilbride and attempted to slit his throat with a six-inch serrated blade before fatally strangling him with a piece of string, possibly a <b>shoelace.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the Olympic 100 m final, Bolt broke new ground, {{winning in}} 9.69 s (unofficially 9.683 s) with a {{reaction}} time of 0.165 s. This was an improvement upon {{his own world}} record, and he was well ahead of second-place finisher Richard Thompson, who finished in 9.89 s. Not only was the record set without a favourable wind (+0.0m/s), but he also visibly slowed down to celebrate before he finished and his <b>shoelace</b> was untied. Bolt's coach reported that, based upon the speed of Bolt's opening 60 m, he could have finished {{with a time of}} 9.52 s. After scientific analysis of Bolt's run by the Institute of Theoretical Astrophysics at the University of Oslo, Hans Eriksen and his colleagues also predicted a sub 9.60 s time. Considering factors such as Bolt's position, acceleration and velocity in comparison with second-place-finisher Thompson, the team estimated that Bolt could have finished in 9.55±0.04 s had he not slowed to celebrate before the finishing line.|$|E

50|$|Shoe {{companies}} often {{produce their}} own <b>shoelaces,</b> for which they manufacture aglets. Many companies prefer to add metal sheaths over plastic aglets {{for the sake of}} durability. Some may add logos or pictures to show that the <b>shoelaces</b> are their own products.|$|R
25|$|Traditional <b>shoelaces</b> {{were made}} of leather, cotton, jute, hemp, or other {{materials}} used {{in the manufacture of}} rope. Modern <b>shoelaces</b> often incorporate various synthetic fibers, which are generally more slippery and thus more prone to coming undone than those made from traditional fibers. On the other hand, smooth synthetic <b>shoelaces</b> generally have a less rough appearance, suffer less wear from friction, and are less susceptible to rotting from moisture. Specialized fibers like flame resistant nomex are applied in safety boots for firefighters.|$|R

25|$|The proper {{length of}} a <b>shoelace,</b> fitting it to a shoe, varies {{according}} {{to the type of}} lacing used, as well as the type of lace. However, at a rough reference the following guide can be used.|$|E
25|$|The stiff {{section at}} each end of the <b>shoelace,</b> which both keeps the twine from {{unraveling}} and also makes it easier to hold the lace and feed it through the eyelets, is called an aglet, also spelled aiglet.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally, {{the only}} neck wear {{appropriate}} {{is the black}} bow tie that is a self-tie and should always match the lapel facing of the dinner jacket and braiding of the trouser seams. The bow tie is tied using a common <b>shoelace</b> knot, which is also called the bow knot for that reason.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} lacing method, termed {{criss-cross}} lacing, {{is also one}} of the strongest and most efficient, but is not so well suited to certain dress shoes, such as Oxfords, because the central <b>shoelace</b> crossovers prevent the sides of the shoe from coming together in the middle. For such shoes, methods such as straight lacing are better suited.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Shoelaces</b> {{with a flat}} {{cross-section}} {{are generally}} easier to hold and stay tied more securely than those with a round cross-section due to the increased surface area for friction.

25|$|Shoelaces are {{typically}} tied {{off at the}} top of the shoe using a simple bow knot. Besides securing the shoe, this also takes up the length of <b>shoelace</b> exposed after tightening. The common bow consists of two half-knots tied one on top of the other, with the second half-knot looped in order to allow quick untying. When required, the knot can be readily loosened by pulling one or both of the loose ends.|$|E
25|$|Shoelaces, {{also called}} shoestrings (US English) or bootlaces (UK English), are a system {{commonly}} used to secure shoes, boots and other footwear.They typically consist {{of a pair of}} strings or cords, one for each shoe, finished off at both ends with stiff sections, known as aglets. Each <b>shoelace</b> typically passes through a series of holes, eyelets, loops or hooks {{on either side of the}} shoe. Loosening the lacing allows the shoe to open wide enough for the foot to be inserted or removed. Tightening the lacing and tying off the ends secures the foot within the shoe.|$|E
25|$|Burials {{reflecting}} this Final Phase exhibit {{an increasing}} polarity of grave wealth. While most Final Phase burials contain grave goods, {{there are fewer}} artefacts interned with the graves than {{was seen in the}} Early Anglo-Saxon period. The artefacts included as grave goods also differ from those typically found in earlier centuries. Brooches and long strings of beads become less common in female graves, while weapons become less common in male graves. Men's graves often include small buckles, knives, and sometimes <b>shoelace</b> tags. Women's graves typically consist of pins, chatelaines with such accessories as purse-mounts and workboxes, and necklaces containing small, monochrome beads, gold pendants, and slip-rings made of silver or bronze.|$|E

500|$|After the game, Brandon Graham, {{who played}} with Robinson at Michigan in 2009 and also played with Michael Vick on the Philadelphia Eagles told reporters that Robinson is even quicker than Vick: [...] "Both of them are pretty fast, I just think Vick's older; he's not really that fast like how <b>Shoelace</b> is. I think <b>Shoelace</b> is more quick than Vick, but Vick, he gets away. He's pretty fast still. I think <b>Shoelace</b> might have got him by a couple steps." ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{are many}} <b>shoelace</b> accessories. There are hooks to help lace {{shoelaces}} tightly. They are especially useful for skates where tight lacing is important. <b>Shoelace</b> covers protect the laces, especially in wrestling. <b>Shoelace</b> charms are decorative, as are colored shoelaces. Some laces are colored using expensive dyes, other, more [...] "personal" [...] colors, are drawn-on with permanent markers. Some dress codes (especially high schools) will specifically exclude color laces and charms. Lace-locks hold laces together, {{eliminating the need}} for tying. There are <b>shoelace</b> tags, sometimes called deubré, with two holes or slots through which the <b>shoelace</b> is passed. These are worn on the section of <b>shoelace</b> closest to the toes, in other words the last lace, so that the image or writing on the tag is visible (as can be seen at right).|$|E
2500|$|There {{are several}} more secure {{alternatives}} to the common <b>shoelace</b> bow, with names such as Turquoise Turtle <b>Shoelace</b> Knot, or Shoemaker's Knot, Better Bow <b>Shoelace</b> Knot, Surgeon's <b>Shoelace</b> Knot, and Ian's Secure <b>Shoelace</b> Knot, or double slip knot. One such knot has been patented in 1999 under the title [...] "Shoelace tying system". These are all variations of the same concept of looping the top part of the knot twice instead of once, which results in a finished bow of almost identical appearance but with the laces wrapped twice around the middle. This double-wrap holds the shoelaces more securely tied while still allowing them to be untied with a (slightly firmer) pull on the loose end(s).|$|E

25|$|When {{tying the}} half-knots, a right-over-left half-knot {{followed}} by a left-over-right half-knot (or vice versa) forms a square or reef knot, a fairly effective knot {{for the purpose of}} tying <b>shoelaces.</b> However, tying two consecutive right-over-left half-knots (or two consecutive left-over-right half-knots) forms the infamous granny knot, which is much less secure. Most people who use it will find themselves regularly retying their <b>shoelaces.</b>|$|R

2500|$|A triangle: [...] (where B is any side, and h is the {{distance}} from the line on which B lies to the other vertex of the triangle). This formula can be used if the height h is known. If the lengths of the three sides are known then Heron's formula can be used: [...] where a, b, c are the sides of the triangle, and [...] is half of its perimeter. If an angle and its two included sides are given, the area is [...] where [...] is the given angle and [...] and [...] are its included sides. If the triangle is graphed on a coordinate plane, a matrix can be used and is simplified to the absolute value of [...] This formula is also known as the <b>shoelace</b> formula and is an easy way to solve for the area of a coordinate triangle by substituting the 3 points (x1,y1), (x2,y2), and (x3,y3).

50|$|Instead {{of wearing}} a {{conventional}} belt, skateboarders often wear <b>shoelaces</b> in belt loops {{to hold their}} trousers up. This is done mostly for fashion, {{but it is also}} useful because belt buckles often dig into a skater's stomach when skating. Since <b>shoelaces</b> do not require belt buckles, this digging is avoided. Another reason this is done is to avoid the excessive pain belts can cause if a skateboarder should fall.|$|R
