5|$|Kelowna International Airport, an {{international}} airport operated in nearby city of Kelowna, {{has had a}} <b>small</b> <b>impact</b> on this airport, since they both share the same catchment area. About 13percent of the local residents in 2007 choose the Kelowna International Airport over the Kamloops Airport to fly to regional destinations, specifically due to its significant growth. Despite this, some Kelowna residents choose the Kamloops Airport over their local airport.|$|E
5|$|Mayflies are {{involved}} in both primary production and bioturbation. A study in laboratory simulated streams revealed that the Centroptilum genus of the mayfly increased the export of periphyton, thus indirectly affecting primary production positively, which is an essential process for ecosystems. The mayfly can also reallocate and alter the nutrient availability in aquatic habitats {{through the process of}} bioturbation. By burrowing in the bottom of lakes and redistributing nutrients, mayflies indirectly regulate phytoplankton and epibenthic primary production. Once burrowing {{to the bottom of the}} lake, mayfly nymphs begin to billow their respiratory gills. This motion creates current that carries food particles through the burrow and allows the nymph to filter feed. Other mayfly nymphs possess elaborate filter feeding mechanisms like that of the genus Isonychia. The nymph have forelegs that contain long bristle-like structures that have two rows of hairs. Interlocking hairs form the filter by which the insect traps food particles. The action of filter feeding has a <b>small</b> <b>impact</b> on water purification but an even larger impact on the convergence of small particulate matter into matter of a more complex form that goes on to benefit consumers later in the food chain.|$|E
5|$|The {{surface of}} Callisto {{is the oldest}} and most heavily cratered in the Solar System. Its surface is {{completely}} covered with impact craters. It does not show any signatures of subsurface processes such as plate tectonics or volcanism, with no signs that geological activity in general has ever occurred, and is thought to have evolved predominantly under the influence of impacts. Prominent surface features include multi-ring structures, variously shaped impact craters, and chains of craters (catenae) and associated scarps, ridges and deposits. At a small scale, the surface is varied and made up of small, sparkly frost deposits at the tips of high spots, surrounded by a low-lying, smooth blanket of dark material. This is thought to result from the sublimation-driven degradation of small landforms, which is supported by the general deficit of <b>small</b> <b>impact</b> craters and the presence of numerous small knobs, considered to be their remnants. The absolute ages of the landforms are not known.|$|E

5|$|Two {{regions of}} smooth plains were {{observed}} by Voyager 2. They generally have low relief and have far fewer craters {{than in the}} cratered terrains, indicating a relatively young surface age. In one of the smooth plain regions, Sarandib Planitia, no impact craters were visible down to the limit of resolution. Another region of smooth plains to the southwest of Sarandib is criss-crossed by several troughs and scarps. Cassini has since viewed these smooth plains regions, like Sarandib Planitia and Diyar Planitia at much higher resolution. Cassini images show these regions filled with low-relief ridges and fractures, probably caused by shear deformation. The high-resolution images of Sarandib Planitia revealed a number of <b>small</b> <b>impact</b> craters, which allow for {{an estimate of the}} surface age, either 170 million years or 3.7 billion years, depending on assumed impactor population.|$|E
5|$|Johor Bahru {{is one of}} the {{fastest-growing}} cities in Malaysia after Kuala Lumpur. It is the main commercial centre for Johor and is located in the Indonesia–Malaysia–Singapore Growth Triangle. Tertiary-based industry dominates the economy with thousands of Singaporeans and Indonesians and other international tourists visiting the city. It is the centre of financial services, commerce and retail, arts and culture, hospitality, urban tourism, plastic manufacturing, electrical and electronics and food processing. The city has a very close economic relationship with Singapore as many Singaporeans frequently visit for shopping, entertainment, and dining which increase the city income with the stronger Singapore dollar; some Singaporeans have also chosen to live in the city. Due to this, Johor Bahru's retail scene was continuously developed {{to meet the needs of}} its consumers. The main shopping districts are located within the city, with a number of large shopping malls located in the suburbs. A large numbers of the city's residents work in Singapore, where the salaries are higher than in Malaysia. The presence of Singaporean and Chinese-owned companies were also significant, with China being the fifth largest investor in Iskandar Malaysia after Singapore, the United States, Spain and Japan as of September 2014. In 2014, the sudden change of weekend rest days to Friday and Saturday from Saturday and Sunday by the Sultan of Johor had a relatively <b>small</b> <b>impact</b> to the city economy, with business especially affected. However, it boosted the tourism industry as the holidays would be able to start earlier on Sunday, attracting more tourists from Singapore. Johor Bahru is the location of numerous conferences, congress and trade fairs, such as the Eastern Regional Organisation for Planning and Housing and the World Islamic Economic Forum. The city is the first in Malaysia to practise a low-carbon economy.|$|E

25|$|The inner zone (diameter {{of about}} 360km) {{is an example}} of a palimpsest: a high albedo {{circular}} feature of impact origin. The surface in the central zone is relatively smooth and has a mottled appearance. Many impact craters inside it have dark halos. At the high resolution achieved in some Galileo images the central part of Valhalla looks like a knobby terrain, where bright knobs are surrounded by dark smooth plains; there is noticeable deficit of <b>small</b> <b>impact</b> craters.|$|E

40|$|It is now {{admitted}} that very large impacts {{may have played}} an important role in the accretion of the terrestrial planets. The size-frequency distribution of these impacts fits the formal definition of a catastrophic process: the mass and momentum added by a rare large impact is larger than that added by all the more frequent <b>small</b> <b>impacts</b> combined. The effects of such large impacts on the thermal states of growing planets is discussed. At a later stage of planetary evolution, the <b>smaller</b> <b>impacts</b> during late heavy bombardment may have {{played an important role}} in stripping the original gaseous atmospheres of the planets and in segregating condensible substances from volatile ones...|$|R

25|$|An {{impact crater}} is an {{approximately}} circular {{depression in the}} surface of a planet, moon, or other solid body in the Solar System or elsewhere, formed by the hypervelocity impact of a smaller body. In contrast to volcanic craters, which result from explosion or internal collapse, impact craters typically have raised rims and floors that are lower in elevation than the surrounding terrain. Although Meteor Crater is perhaps the best-known example of a <b>small</b> <b>impact</b> crater on Earth, impact craters range from small, simple, bowl-shaped depressions to large, complex, multi-ringed impact basins.|$|E
25|$|Raditladi Basin {{is a large}} peak ring {{impact crater}} on Mercury with a {{diameter}} of 263km. Inside its peak ring there is a system of concentric extensional troughs (graben), which are rare surface features on Mercury. The floor of Raditladi is partially covered by relatively light smooth plains, which {{are thought to be}} a product of the effusive volcanism. The troughs may also have resulted from volcanic processes under the floor of Raditladi. The basin is relatively young—probably younger than one billion years, with only a few <b>small</b> <b>impact</b> craters on its floor and with well-preserved basin walls and peak-ring structure.|$|E
25|$|Typical fission events release {{about two}} hundred million eV (200MeV) of energy for each fission event. The exact isotope which is fissioned, {{and whether or not}} it is {{fissionable}} or fissile, has only a <b>small</b> <b>impact</b> on the amount of energy released. This can be easily seen by examining the curve of binding energy (image below), and noting that the average binding energy of the actinide nuclides beginning with uranium is around 7.6 MeV per nucleon. Looking further left on the curve of binding energy, where the fission products cluster, it is easily observed that the binding energy of the fission products tends to center around 8.5 MeV per nucleon. Thus, in any fission event of an isotope in the actinide's range of mass, roughly 0.9 MeV is released per nucleon of the starting element. The fission of U235 by a slow neutron yields nearly identical energy to the fission of U238 by a fast neutron. This energy release profile holds true for thorium and the various minor actinides as well.|$|E

Attached to the outer south-southwest rim is the slightly smaller but equally worn Chandler P. Multiple small craters lie along the rim and inner wall of Chandler, but {{the northern part of}} the rim has been nearly obliterated by a cluster of <b>small</b> <b>impacts.</b> There is also seemingly a chain of impacts that run across the crater midpoint, with a double impact in the western half and a chain of three impacts in the eastern half. The remainder of the floor is somewhat irregular, with multiple tiny craters and a pair of <b>small</b> <b>impacts</b> near the southern rim.|$|R
25|$|The {{impact of}} Indian laws on female {{foeticide}} and its enforcement is unclear. United Nations Population Fund and India's National Human Rights Commission, in 2009, asked the Government of India {{to assess the}} impact of the law. The Public Health Foundation of India, an premier research organization in its 2010 report, claimed a lack of awareness about the Act in parts of India, inactive role of the Appropriate Authorities, ambiguity among some clinics that offer prenatal care services, and the role of a few medical practitioners in disregarding the law. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of India has targeted education and media advertisements to reach clinics and medical professionals to increase awareness. The Indian Medical Association has undertaken efforts to prevent prenatal sex selection by giving its members Beti Bachao (save the daughter) badges during its meetings and conferences. However, a recent study by Nandi and Deolalikar (2013) argues that the 1994 PNDT Act may have had a <b>small</b> <b>impact</b> by preventing 106,000 female foeticides over one decade.|$|E
500|$|The giant impact {{believed}} to have formed Caloris may have had global consequences for the planet. [...] At the exact antipode of the basin is a large area of hilly, grooved terrain, with few <b>small</b> <b>impact</b> craters that are known as chaotic terrain (also [...] "weird terrain"). It is thought by some to have been created as seismic waves from the impact converged {{on the opposite side}} of the planet. Alternatively, it has been suggested that this terrain formed as a result of the convergence of ejecta at this basin’s antipode. This hypothetical impact is also {{believed to}} have triggered volcanic activity on Mercury, resulting in the formation of smooth plains. Surrounding Caloris is a series of geologic formations thought to have been produced by the basin's ejecta, collectively called the Caloris Group.|$|E
500|$|On a sub-kilometer {{scale the}} surface of Callisto is more {{degraded}} than the surfaces of other icy Galilean moons. Typically there is a deficit of <b>small</b> <b>impact</b> craters with diameters less than 1km as compared with, for instance, the dark plains on Ganymede. Instead of small craters, the almost ubiquitous surface features are small knobs and pits. The knobs are thought to represent remnants of crater rims degraded by an as-yet uncertain process. The most likely candidate process is the slow sublimation of ice, which is enabled by a temperature of up to 165K, reached at a subsolar point. Such sublimation of water or other volatiles from the dirty ice that is the bedrock causes its decomposition. The non-ice remnants form debris avalanches descending from {{the slopes of the}} crater walls. Such avalanches are often observed near and inside impact craters and termed [...] "debris aprons". Sometimes crater walls are cut by sinuous valley-like incisions called [...] "gullies", which resemble certain Martian surface features. In the ice sublimation hypothesis, the low-lying dark material is interpreted as a blanket of primarily non-ice debris, which originated from the degraded rims of craters and has covered a predominantly icy bedrock.|$|E

2500|$|Levitt's 1994 {{paper on}} {{campaign}} spending employs a unique identification strategy {{to control for}} the quality of each candidate (which in previous work had led to an overstatement of the true effect). It concludes that campaign spending has a very <b>small</b> <b>impact</b> on election outcomes, regardless of who does the spending. On the subject of federal spending and elections, previous empirical studies were not able to establish that members of Congress are rewarded by the electorate for bringing federal dollars to their district because of omitted variables bias. [...] Levitt and Snyder (1997) employ an instrument which circumvents this problem and finds evidence that federal spending benefits congressional incumbents; they find that an additional $100 per capita spending is worth as much as 2 percent of the popular vote.|$|E
2500|$|An {{emphasis}} on educating women about lifestyle changes {{that may have}} a <b>small</b> <b>impact</b> on preventing breast cancer often makes women feel guilty if they do develop breast cancer. Some women decide that their own cancer resulted from poor diet, lack of exercise, or other modifiable lifestyle factor, even though most cases of breast cancer are due to non-controllable factors, like genetics or naturally occurring background radiation. Adopting such a belief may increase their sense of being {{in control of their}} fate. Increased awareness inadvertently increases victim blaming. [...] Women who resist screening mammography or breast self-exams are subjected to social pressure, scare tactics, guilt, and threats from some physicians to terminate the relationship with the patient. Similarly, the {{emphasis on}} early detection results in many women wrongly blaming themselves if their cancer is not detected at an early stage.|$|E
2500|$|There are six notable {{meteorite}} or comet impact craters in Saskatchewan. [...] Carswell, Deep Bay, and Gow Lake {{have affected}} the Canadian Shield area of the north.
