40|$|Background: In this paper, {{the novel}} concept of {{artificial}} microscopic <b>swarm</b> <b>control</b> systems is proposed as a promising approach towards realization of intelligent medical treatment at nanoscale. In this new paradigm, treatment is done autonomously at nanoscale within the patient’s body by the proposed <b>swarm</b> <b>control</b> systems. Methods: From control engineering perspective, medical treatment {{can be considered}} as a control problem, in which the ultimate goal is to find the best feasible way to change the state of diseased tissue from unhealthy to healthy in presence of uncertainty. Although a living tissue is a huge swarm of microscopic cells, nearly all of the common treatment methods are based on macroscopic centralized control paradigm. Inspired by natural microscopic <b>swarm</b> <b>control</b> systems such as nervous, endocrine and immune systems that work based on <b>swarm</b> <b>control</b> paradigm, medical treatment needs a paradigm shift from macroscopic centralized control to microscopic <b>swarm</b> <b>control.</b> An artificial microscopic <b>swarm</b> <b>control</b> system consists of a huge number of very simple autonomous microscopic agents that exploit swarm intelligence to realize sense, control (computing) and actuation at nanoscale in local, distributed and decentralized manner. This control system can be designed based on mathematical analysis and computer simulation. Results: The proposed approach is used for treatment of atherosclerosis and cancer based on mathematical analysis and in-silico study. Conclusion: The notion of artificial microscopic <b>swarm</b> <b>control</b> systems opens new doors towards realization of autonomous and intelligent medical treatment at nanoscale within the patient’s body...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: <b>Swarm</b> <b>controlled</b> {{emergence}} {{is proposed}} as {{an approach to}} control emergent effects in (artificial) swarms. The method involves the introduction of specific control agents into the <b>swarm</b> systems. <b>Control</b> agents behave similar to the normal agents and do not directly influence {{the behavior of the}} normal agents. The specific design of the control agents depends on the particular swarm system considered. The aim {{of this paper is to}} apply the method to ant clustering. Ant clustering, as an emergent effect, can be observed in nature and has inspired the design of several technical systems, e. g. moving robots, and clustering algorithms. Design/methodology/approach: Different types of control agents for that ant clustering model are designed by introducing slight changes to the behavioural rules of the normal agents. The clustering behaviour of the resulting swarms is investigated by extensive simulation studies. Findings: It is shown that complex behavior can emerge in systems with two types of agents (normal agents and control agents). For a particular behavior of the control agents, an interesting swarm size dependent effect was found. The behaviour prevents clustering when the number of control agents is large, but leads to stronger clustering when the number of control agents is relatively small. Research limitations/implications: Although <b>swarm</b> <b>controlled</b> emergence is a general approach, in the experiments of this paper the authors concentrate mainly on ant clustering. It remains for future research to investigate the application of the method in other <b>swarm</b> systems. <b>Swarm</b> <b>controlled</b> emergence might be applied to control emergent effects in computing systems that consist of many autonomous components which make decentralized decisions based on local information. Practical implications: The particular finding, that certain behaviours of control agents can lead to stronger clustering, can help to design improved clustering algorithms by using heterogeneous swarms of agents. Originality/value: In general, the control of (unwanted) emergent effects in artificial systems is an important problem. However, to date not much research has been done on this topic. This paper proposes a new approach and opens a different research direction towards future control principles for self-organized systems that consist of a large number of autonomous components...|$|R

Recent advancements in computation, communication, and mechatronics have allowed the development of large groups of vehicles, often referred to as swarms, in order to accomplish complex missions over large areas with redundant fault tolerant capabilities. Existing <b>swarm</b> <b>control</b> work has addressed swarm aggregation, foraging swarms, swarm formation, and swarms that track and enclose targets. Energetic <b>swarm</b> <b>control</b> is another significant recent contribution to the <b>swarm</b> <b>control</b> literature.

40|$|Our future {{military}} force will be complex: a highly integrated mix of manned and unmanned units. These unmanned units could function individually or within a swarm. The readiness of future warfighters to work alongside and utilize these new forces {{depends on the}} creation of usable interfaces and training simulators. The difficulty is that current UAV control interfaces require too much operator attention and common <b>swarm</b> <b>control</b> methods require expensive computational power. This paper begins with a discussion on how to improve upon current user interfaces and then reviews a <b>swarm</b> <b>control</b> method, the digital pheromone field. This method uses digital pheromones to bias the movements of individual units within a swarm toward areas that are attractive and away from areas that are dangerous or unattractive. Next, a more efficient method for performing pheromone field calculations is introduced, one that harnesses the power of the GPU (graphics processing unit) in today's graphics cards by reshaping the ADAPTIV <b>swarm</b> <b>control</b> algorithm into a form acceptable to the GPU's pipeline (Parunak et al, 2002). The GPU ADAPTIV implementation is tested in scenarios that involve up to 50, 000 virtual UAVs. When compared to its counterpart CPU implementation, the GPU version performed over 30 times faster than the CPU version. This gain translates directly into lower costs for training the future warfighter today and fielding the swarms of tomorrow. Finally, this paper presents a vision of how to combine these new interface ideas and performance enhancements into an effective <b>swarm</b> <b>control</b> interface and training simulator...|$|E

40|$|The {{control of}} a large swarm of {{distributed}} agents is a well known challenge within the study of unmanned autonomous systems. However, it also presents many new opportunities. The advantages of operating a swarm through distributed means has been assessed in the literature for efficiency from both operational and economical aspects; practically {{as the number of}} agents increases, distributed control is favoured over centralised control, as it can reduce agent computational costs and increase robustness on the swarm. Distributed architectures, however, can present the drawback of requiring knowledge of the whole swarm state, therefore limiting the scalability of the swarm. In this paper a strategy is presented to address the challenges of distributed architectures, changing {{the way in which the}} <b>swarm</b> shape is <b>controlled</b> and providing a step towards verifiable swarm behaviour, achieving new configurations, while saving communication and computation resources. Instead of applying change at agent level (e. g. modify its guidance law), the sensing of the agents is addressed to a portion of agents, differentially driving their behaviour. This strategy is applied for <b>swarms</b> <b>controlled</b> by artificial potential functions which would ordinarily require global knowledge and all-to-all interactions. Limiting the agents' knowledge is proposed for the first time in this work as a methodology rather than obstacle to obtain desired swarm behaviour...|$|R

40|$|International audienceControlling several and {{possibly}} independent moving agents {{in order to}} reach global goals is a tedious task that has applications in many engineering fields such as robotics or computer animation. Together, the different agents form a whole called swarm, which may display interesting collective behaviors. When the agents are driven by their own dynamics, controlling this swarm is known as the particle <b>swarm</b> <b>control</b> problem. In that context, several strategies, based on the control of individuals using simple rules, exist. This paper defends a new and original method based on a centralized approach. More precisely, we propose a framework to control several particles with constraints either expressed on a per-particle basis, or expressed as a function of their environment. We refer to these two categories as respectively Lagrangian or Eulerian constraints. The contributions of the paper are the following: (i) we show how to use optimal control recipes to express an optimization process over a large state space including the dynamic information of the particles; and (ii) the relation between the Lagrangian state space and Eulerian values is conveniently expressed with graph operators that make it possible to conduct all the mathematical operations required by the control process.
