Although there is no exact design theory, similarity method gives a sound knowledge for designing trawl net better than experimental knitting method, which is commonly used by Vietnamese fishermen. As the designer has to be creative in each particular case, {{and the effectiveness of}} fishing gear so developed depends heavily on the knowledge acquired from fishermen and on information on bottom conditions and fish behaviour, This study could be used as an effort of trial and balance for further work in this direction.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Short-term {{effects of}} bottom {{trawling}} on a 'hard-bottom ' (pebble, cobble, and boulder) seafloor were studied {{on the outer}} continental shelf in the eastern Gulf of Alaska. Eight sites were trawled in August 1996; then, from a research submersible we videotaped each trawl path and a nearby reference transect to obtain quantitative data. Boulders were displaced, and large epifaunal invertebrates were removed or damaged by a <b>single</b> <b>trawl</b> pass. These structural components of habitat were the dominant features on the seafloor. There was {{a significant decrease in}} density, and an increase in damage, to sponges and anthozoans in trawled versus reference transects. Changes in density, or damage to most motile invertebrates were not detected. Delayed mortality, of apparently undamaged invertebrates, may have resulted in greater impact than we detected. Alternatively, over time, some invertebrates may have recovered from any damage previously suffered. A subsequent survey at these sites will address these questions.

50|$|Pair {{trawling}} {{is effective}} on all demersal species. In shallow waters, where {{the noise from}} a single vessel may scatter fish, two vessels operating a distance apart tend to herd fish {{into the path of}} the net.

Typically, two consecutive samples were obtained with the vessel towing at same direction and at similar depth all the time, as if when fishing without the multisampler. Typically, cod-end was opened for 10 - 20 minutes for each sample. During standard survey operation without the multisampler, total towing time would have been similar but only one sample could have been obtained. Multiple samples taken within a distance of just 1 - 2 nautical miles reveal substantial variation in mean length of blue whiting in the samples originating from the same haul. Within-haul, between-sample variability is not much less than between haul variation, and may even be larger. Our findings highlight that spatial heterogeneity can be combated (1) by taking more trawl samples and (2) by keeping tow duration sufficiently long.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{potential}} for a reduction in required propeller power by optimizing the transverse position of attachment points for trawl warps, simulating a system of movable trawl blocks. Full scale measurements from the 65 meter long stern trawler F/T Prestfjord is used as a basis. A surge, sway and yaw manoeuvring model based on Lagrangian mechanics is used together with control forces from trawl, rudder and propeller is put into a bounded optimization algorithm to find the transverse position of trawl blocks requiring the lowest thrust. The bounds are the original placement of the port-side and starboard blocks, i. e 5. 08 meters. The result is a small reduction in power. For the operational profile from the data-set, the mean reduction in power is 0. 64 %. During trawling, the mean reduction in power is 1. 13 % when pulling a double trawl, and 1. 11 % when a <b>single</b> <b>trawl</b> is pulled. This is smaller than earlier reports have found, and it is not certain that such a system will be beneficial in an economical perspective when investment and maintenance cost is included. Differences to earlier reports seem to be based on rudder size and efficiency. The power reduction is greatest in relation to manoeuvring, while it is more stable when trawling on a straight course with a drift angle...|$|E

40|$|Allegations {{of growth}} {{overfishing}} of the already depleted snapper (Pagrus auratus) stock in Denham Sound, Shark Bay, Western Australia, due to prawn trawling, and concerns for by-catch species generally, {{led to the}} investigation of size-related catchability and cod-end selectivity of juvenile snapper and western butterfish (Pentapodus vitta). The cod-end selectivity of prawn trawling was investigated by fitting a fine-mesh cod-end cover to commercial trawl nets to measure the size of fish passing through the cod-end. A Leslie-Delury depletion experiment involving trawling the same area over four consecutive nights {{was used to determine}} the catchability coefficients of snapper and butterfish. The size of snapper and butterfish caught on the trawlable grounds ranged from 3 to 18 and 5 to 20 cm fork length (FL), respectively. Ontogenetic changes in habitat preference meant that snapper were susceptible to commercial trawling only between approximately 9 - 17 months of age. Retention of snapper and butterfish in the trawl nets increased with increasing length, with the deeper-bodied snapper retained at smaller lengths. Catchability coefficients also increased with fish length. A <b>single</b> <b>trawl</b> pass was estimated to remove up to 57 % and 52 % of juvenile snapper and butterfish, respectively. The rate of natural mortality (M) for juvenile snapper was estimated to be high; mean M = 2. 58 (92 % year- 1). Catchability of butterfish was low prior to their sexual maturation and trawling is assessed not to be a threat to this species. To reduce the impact of prawn trawling on snapper recruitment in Denham Sound, restricting trawling from areas where juvenile snapper are in high abundance, combined with fish escape panels, would be preferable to increasing mesh size in commercial trawl gear...|$|E
40|$|For prawn {{trawling}} systems, drag {{reduction is}} a high priority as the trawling process is ener-gy intensive. Large benefits have occurred {{through the use of}} multiple-net rigs and thin twine in the netting. An additional positive effect of these successful twine-area reduction strategies is the reduced amount of otter board area required to spread the trawl systems, which leads to further drag reduction. The present work investigated the potential of redi-recting the drag-strain within a prawn trawl away from the wings and the otter boards to the centre line of the trawl, where top and bottom tongues have been installed, with an aim to minimise the loading/size of the otter boards required to spread the trawl. In the system con-taining the new ‘W ’ trawl, the drag redirected to the centre-line tongues is transferred for-ward through a connected sled and towing wires to the trawler. To establish the extent of drag redirection to the centre-line tongues and the relative drag benefits of the new trawl system, conventional and ‘W ’ trawls of 3. 65 m headline length were tested firstly over a range of spread ratios in the flume tank, and subsequently at optimum spread ratio in the field. The developed ‘W ’ trawl effectively directed 64 % of netting-drag off the wings and onto the centre tongues, which resulted in drag savings in the field of* 20 % for the associated ‘W ’ trawl/otter-board/sled system compared to the traditional trawl/otter-board arrangement in a <b>single</b> <b>trawl</b> or twin rig configuration. Furthermore, based on previously published data, the new trawl when used in a twin rig system is expected to provide approximately 12 % drag reduction compared to quad rig. The twin ‘W ’ trawl system also has benefits over quad rig in that a reduced number of cod-end/By-catch Reduction Device units need to be in-stalled and attended each tow...|$|E
40|$|Most plastic {{pollution}} originates on land. As such, freshwater bodies {{serve as}} conduits for {{the transport of}} plastic litter to the ocean. Understanding the concentrations and fluxes of plastic litter in freshwater ecosystems is critical {{to our understanding of}} the global plastic litter budget and underpins the success of future management strategies. We conducted a replicated field survey of surface plastic concentrations in four lakes in the North American Great Lakes system, the largest contiguous freshwater system on the planet. We then modeled plastic transport to resolve spatial and temporal variability of plastic distribution in one of the Great Lakes, Lake Erie. Triplicate surface samples were collected at 38 stations in mid-summer of 2014. Plastic particles > 106 μm in size were quantified. Concentrations were highest near populated urban areas and their water infrastructure. In the highest concentration trawl, nearly 2 million fragments km− 2 were found in the Detroit River—dwarfing previous reports of Great Lakes plastic abundances by over 4 -fold. Yet, the accuracy of <b>single</b> <b>trawl</b> counts was challenged: within-station plastic abundances varied 0 - to 3 -fold between replicate trawls. In the smallest size class (106 – 1, 000 μm), false positive rates of 12 – 24 % were determined analytically for plastic vs. non-plastic, while false negative rates averaged ~ 18 %. Though predicted to form in summer by the existing Lake Erie circulation model, our transport model did not predict a permanent surface “Lake Erie Garbage Patch” in its central basin—a trend supported by field survey data. Rather, general eastward transport with recirculation in the major basins was predicted. Further, modeled plastic residence times were drastically influenced by plastic buoyancy. Neutrally buoyant plastics—those with the same density as the ambient water—were flushed several times slower than plastics floating at the water's surface and exceeded the hydraulic residence time of the lake. It is likely that the ecosystem impacts of plastic litter persist in the Great Lakes longer than assumed based on lake flushing rates. This study furthers our understanding of plastic pollution in the Great Lakes, a model freshwater system to study the movement of plastic from anthropogenic sources to environmental sinks...|$|E

40|$|The harbour seal, Phoca vitulina, {{occurs in}} small groups along the entire coast of Norway. It is thought to {{interact}} with the commercial fisheries, both as predator and as final host for parasitic nematodes infecting fishes.

The studies include both analysis of harbour seal faeces and trawling for information on prey-occurrence. In the trawl-catches the species of Gadidae and Pleuronectidae were most frequently found, with norway pout and plaice, respectively, being the most important single species.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a general feasibility study on double rigged versus <b>single</b> rigged <b>trawls.</b> This study used model experimental nets {{tested in a}} circulating water tank. Three kinds of trawls were tested, i. e. the Mexican semi ballon double rigged shrimp trawl designed by Nichimo (hereafter called net A), the traditional two seam single rigged Malaysian shrimp trawl (net B) and the four seam trawl modified from the above Malaysian trawl (net C). The head rope length of net A is about half that of net B and net C. Primary objectives are to determine physical characteristics, working performance and to estimate the main engine output necessary to pull these nets. To provide a double rigged shrimp trawl in the Malaysian shrimp fisheries, results of experiments are summarised as follows: 1) At 2 knots, which is a normal towing speed of a Malaysian shrimp trawler, net mouth height of net A is 1. 2 meter, net B is 2 meter and net C is 1. 8 meter. In accordance to the behaviour of shrimp, these net mouth height are sufficient. 2) In order to ensure {{the security of the}} catch, the most efficient average mesh opening was determined to be five vertical cross-sections. The mesh opening is bigger at the square panel and becomes smaller towards the cod end. The opening is about 3 centimeter for 5. 7 centimeter mesh size. 3) The wing tip spread of net A is 11 meter, which is 80 % of its head rope length. Net B is 14 meter (55 %) and net C is 14. 4 meter (60 %). 4) The working performance of a shrimp trawl is determined by its sweeping area. The obtained experimental equations of the sweeping area of the three net are slimplified as follows: 2 net A: A's= 2. 18 Vnet B: A"s= 1. 57 Vnet C: A‴s= 1. 58 V 5) The estimation of suitable main engine output necessary to pull the net is calculated from the conversion of total gear drag force values to horse power values.
