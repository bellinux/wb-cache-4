5|$|Hershey Creamery Company, {{also known}} as Hershey's Ice Cream, is a creamery that {{produces}} Hershey's brand ice cream, sorbet, <b>sherbet,</b> and frozen yogurt, and other frozen treats such as smoothies and frozen slab style ice cream mixers. Founded by Jacob Hershey and four of his brothers in 1894 (all of whom have no relation to Milton S.

With their shared names and cities of origin, Hershey Creamery and Hershey Company have had a tumultuous relationship marked by multiple lawsuits over trademark issues. In the mid-1990s, the companies settled their most recent legal battles out of court, with the creamery agreeing to add a disclaimer to its ice cream products to note that it is not affiliated with The Hershey Company.|$|E

Nevertheless, they released occasional covers throughout the 1970s, including Leiber and Stoller's [...] "Hound Dog", The Beatles' [...] "Nowhere Man" [...] and Free's [...] "Wishing Well".

Avoiding exposure to the Loo is strongly recommended for children and the elderly, as well as pets.
