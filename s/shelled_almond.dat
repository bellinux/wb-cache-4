40|$|Introduction: Hyperlipidemia is a {{risk factor}} for {{atherosclerosis}} and cardiovascular diseases. Nuts such as almonds are high in unsaturated lipids and antioxidants. Some studies indicate that nuts have beneficial effects on cardiovascular system. Therefore, the aim of this study was evaluation of the effectiveness of shelled almonds on reduction of blood lipid and lipoprotein levels in hyperlipidemic patients. Methods: This study was a clinical trial (before and after) and was done on 30 men volunteering for the study. They consumed 60 grams shelled almonds per day for four weeks. Their blood lipid, lipoprotein, apolipoprotein and lipoprotein (a) levels were measured after and before almond consumption. Results: <b>Shelled</b> <b>almond</b> consumption caused significant decrease in serum cholesterol 36. 1 mg/dl, triglyceride 45. 94 mg/dl, LDL-cholesterol 28. 68 mg/dl and increase in HDL-cholesterol 10. 64 mg/dl(p< 0. 001). <b>Shelled</b> <b>almond</b> consumption decreased lipoprotein (a) (2. 11 mg/dl), apolipoprotein B 100 (8. 93 mg/dl) and increased apolipoprotein A (1 1. 74 mg/dl) levels, but this effect was insignificant statistically. Conclusion: Continuous consumption of shelled almonds has beneficial effect on blood lipids and may play a preventive role in Atherosclerosis and coronary heart diseases. We therefore suggest that a daily intake of 60 grams of almonds can be used for treatment of hyprelipidemic patients...|$|E

The hydrogen gas yield of 6.52  mol per gram and the ratio of 27  % in total gas were observed for wheat straw as the highest hydrogen yield among experimented feedstocks. Results indicated that wheat straw, walnut <b>shell,</b> and <b>almond</b> <b>shell</b> had the highest hydrogen yield, respectively, and wheat straw, <b>almond</b> <b>shell,</b> and walnut shell showed the highest hydrogen gasification efficiency, respectively.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{processing}} (irradiation and heat treatment) and storage on the main nutrients (carbohydrates, proteins and lipids) of almonds (Prunus amyqdalus Batsch) have been investigated. Two varieties of Iranian almonds: P. amygdalus var. hard shelled, and P. amygdalus var. fragile, and one American variety, P. amygdalus var. semi-hard {{have been used in}} the present study. Variations between the nutrient composition of the different varieties were observed, and the range was between 93 and 132 mg/g for carbohydrates; 170 and 180 mg/g for proteins and 400 and 500 mg/g for lipids. The almonds were then subjected to the following three processes: 1. A sample of <b>shelled</b> <b>almonds</b> was subjected to 2 Mrad irradiation using 60 Co. Changes followed similar trends in the three almond varieties after irradiation. There were no significant losses in total available carbohydrates, total proteins and total lipids, whereas increases were observed in free amino acids, free sugars and free fatty acids. Storage of the irradiated almonds at 22 °C for one year did not bring about any changes in total available carbohydrates, total protein and total lipids. However, there were changes in the individual free sugar fractions, while no changes were observed in free amino acids and in free fatty acids. 2. Samples of <b>shelled</b> <b>almonds</b> were pre-soaked in 17 % salt solution for 4 hours with slow agitation. After removing them from the solution, the salted nuts were transferred to a rotary drum and dried at 70 °C for one hour, until the moisture taken up during the soaking treatment was removed. The temperature was then raised to 120 °C within 30 minutes and roasted for 20 further minutes. Losses occurred in both carbohydrates and proteins, while the total lipid content remained unchanged after the above processing. Decreases were noted in free amino acids and in free sugars, but there were increases in free fatty acids. Storage at 22 °C for one year resulted in no further losses of carbohydrates and proteins. Free amino acids increased, indicating some protein hydrolysis. A further increase in free fatty acids was observed. 3. A sample of <b>shelled</b> <b>almonds</b> was first roasted as described under (2) and then irradiated as described under (1); this being referred to as combined processing (dual treatment). The same three nutrients followed very similar trends to those found in roasted samples.

Kernel quality characteristics, oil composition and sugar composition were determined initially and after 6 months of storage.

Early harvested almonds also had similar oil quality (based on ultraviolet absorption coefficient measurements) and oil composition but lower sugar content and modified sugar composition compared with late harvested <b>almonds.</b> Storage of <b>shelled</b> <b>almonds</b> resulted in kernels with higher oil content, better oil quality, similar oil composition, similar sugar content and some modifications in sugar composition compared with in-shell stored almonds.

50|$|Agriculture is an {{important}} sector in California's economy. Farming-related sales more than quadrupled {{over the past three}} decades, from $7.3 billion in 1974 to nearly $31 billion in 2004. This increase has occurred despite a 15 percent decline in acreage devoted to farming during the period, and water supply suffering from chronic instability. Factors contributing to the growth in sales-per-acre include more intensive use of active farmlands and technological improvements in crop production. In 2008, California's 81,500 farms and ranches generated $36.2 billion products revenue. In 2011, that number grew to $43.5 billion products revenue.

30|$|Gasification in {{supercritical}} water media (T >  374  °C, P >  22.1  MPa) {{is a novel}} {{method for}} conversion of lignocellulosic feed stocks into gaseous product which mainly consists of CO, CO 2, H 2 and CH 4 [19]. This method has many advantages compared with conventional gasification technologies. Energy-intensive drying step can be avoided and wet biomass can be directly used [20]. Furthermore, water in its supercritical condition has low density and dielectric constant. Consequently, it changes from polar solvent into non-polar solvent and organic compound can be easily solved in it [21]. Many researchers have investigated supercritical water gasification of real biomass and its organic compounds. Lu et al. investigated the gasification of many agricultural residues in 25  MPa and 650  °C. It was seen that wheat straw, sorghum stalk and corn cub had higher gasification efficiencies with lower amounts of lignin compared with others [22, 23]. Madenoglu et al. gasified tobacco stalk and cotton stalk in supercritical water media using stainless steel batch reactor. According to elemental and structural analysis, they reported that tobacco stalk with higher C/H ratio and lower amount of lignin was better gasified [24].

All the prepared carbons present a high CO 2 adsorption capacity at 303 K, although carbons developed from <b>almond</b> <b>shells</b> show a superior CO 2 /N 2 selectivity (lower N 2 adsorption) than those {{obtained from}} olive stones.

On the other hand, aminated samples have narrower porosities but higher volumetric capacities. Among the samples studied, aminated <b>almond</b> <b>shells</b> were selected as the most promising adsorbent, due to their high CO 2 adsorption capacity and selectivity and their good adsorption kinetics. To assess the performance of these samples in cyclic adsorption/desorption processes, basic two-step cycle configurations were evaluated by the following regeneration strategies: temperature swing adsorption (TSA), vacuum swing adsorption (VSA) and a combination of both (VTSA).

By selecting the appropriate ratios of each nut powder to Al 2 O 3, it is shown that stoichiometric aluminum nitride can be produced by carbo-thermal reduction in nitrogen atmosphere. Using x-ray diffraction analysis, Raman scattering and Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy, it is demonstrated that aluminum nitride consists of pure wurtzite phase. Transmission electron microscopy showed the formation of nanoparticles and in some cases nanotubes of AlN...|$|R
