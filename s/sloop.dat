5|$|September 5, 1797– A <b>sloop</b> {{is lost in}} Currituck Sound {{during a}} storm.|$|E
5|$|Gerry had ten children, {{of which}} seven survived into adulthood: Gerry's son, James Thompson Gerry, {{commanded}} the USS Albany, a United States Navy war <b>sloop</b> {{that went down}} with all hands in 1854.|$|E
5|$|Low, {{using his}} newly {{captured}} ship, lay in {{wait on the}} popular shipping route between Boston and New York. Within a few days, he and his crew seized a <b>sloop</b> out of Rhode Island and plundered it. His crew cut the rigging away to prevent the <b>sloop</b> returning too quickly to port to raise the alarm. He then captured a number of unarmed merchantmen near Port Rosemary.|$|E
50|$|As {{sailcloth}} {{improved in}} the second half of the 20th century, it became possible to construct sails of a higher aspect ratio. It therefore became more practical for <b>sloops</b> to be designed with the simpler masthead-rigged mast. Most production sailboats from the '60s and '70s were masthead-rigged <b>sloops.</b> Masthead-rigged <b>sloops</b> typically carry a larger spinnaker than fractional-rigged <b>sloops,</b> and therefore enjoy a speed advantage when racing downwind.|$|R
50|$|Developed {{from the}} Bridgewater-class <b>sloops,</b> with a longer hull, the Shoreham-class <b>sloops</b> were laid down between 1929 and 1931 at Chatham and Devonport Naval Dockyards.|$|R
5000|$|The British s did not {{fare well}} against the American ship-rigged <b>sloops</b> of war. [...] and [...] {{constructed}} {{before the war}} were notably powerful vessels, and the Frolic class built during the war even more so (although [...] was trapped and captured by a British frigate and a schooner). The British brig-rigged <b>sloops</b> tended to suffer fire to their rigging more frequently than the American ship-rigged <b>sloops.</b> In addition, the ship-rigged <b>sloops</b> could back their sails in action, giving them another advantage in manoeuvring.|$|R
5|$|On 25 March 1778 Lowestoffe {{captured}} the <b>sloop</b> Swan, Daniel Smith, Master. She was of 60 tons, had {{a crew of}} seven men, and was carrying a cargo of molasses.|$|E
5|$|On August 5, 1824, {{the pirate}} and a {{skeleton}} crew captured the <b>sloop</b> María {{off the coast}} of Guayama as she completed a run between Guayanilla and Ponce under the command of Juan Camino. After boarding the ship they decided not to plunder her, since a larger craft was sailing towards them. The pirates fled west, intercepting a second <b>sloop</b> (La Voladora) off Morillos. Cofresí did not plunder her either, instead requesting information from captain Rafael Mola. That month a ship commanded by the pirates stalked the port of Fajardo, taking advantage of the lack of gunboats capable of pursuing their shallow-draft vessels. Shortly afterwards, the United States ordered captain Charles Boarman of the USS Weasel to monitor the western waters of Puerto Rico as part of an international force. The schooner located a <b>sloop</b> commanded by the pirates off Culebra, but it fled to Vieques and ran inland into dense vegetation; Boarman could only recover the ship.|$|E
5|$|On February 10, 1825, Cofresí plundered the <b>sloop</b> Neptune. The {{merchant}} ship, with a {{cargo of}} fabric and provisions, was attacked while its dry goods were unloaded at dockside in Jobos Bay. Neptune {{was owned by}} Salvador Pastorisa, who was supervising the unloading. Cofresí began the charge in a <b>sloop,</b> opening musket fire on the crew, and Pastoriza fled in a rowboat. Despite a bullet wound, Pastoriza identified four of the eight to ten pirates (including Cofresí). An Italian living in Puerto Rico, Pedro Salovi, was reportedly second-in-command during the attack. The pirates pursued and shot those who fled. Cofresí sailed Neptune out of Jobos Port, a harbor in Jobos Bay (near Fajardo), and adopted the <b>sloop</b> as a pirate ship.|$|E
50|$|Like the {{preceding}} Acacia and Azalea class <b>sloops,</b> these were single-screw Fleet Sweeping Vessels (<b>Sloops)</b> with triple hulls at the bows to give extra protection against loss when working.|$|R
25|$|The {{squadron}} {{consisted of}} three vessels, Butterworth, a full-rigged ship that four or six {{times the size of}} the two <b>sloops</b> that accompanied her. The role of each of the two <b>sloops,</b> Jackal and Prince Lee Boo, was to act as a ship's tender, to scout ahead in shallower waters, or to go off on errands. A man named Priestly owned both <b>sloops.</b>|$|R
50|$|Steam frigates, {{also known}} as screw frigates, and the smaller steam corvettes and steam <b>sloops</b> were steam-powered warships. The first such ships were steam-powered {{versions}} of the traditional frigates, corvettes, and <b>sloops.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{first person}} to sail single-handed to Antarctica was the New Zealander David Henry Lewis, in 1972, in the 10-metre steel <b>sloop</b> Ice Bird.|$|E
5|$|The seventh HMS Enterprise of the Royal Navy was an {{armoured}} <b>sloop</b> {{launched in}} 1864 at Deptford Dockyard. Originally laid {{down as a}} wooden screw <b>sloop</b> of the Camelion class, she was redesigned by Edward Reed and completed as a central battery ironclad. The ship spent the bulk of her career assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet before returning to England in 1871 where she was paid off. Enterprise was sold for scrap in 1885.|$|E
5|$|Bonnet's initial cruise {{took him}} to the coast of the Colony of Virginia, near the {{entrance}} of the Chesapeake Bay, where he captured and plundered four vessels, and burned the Barbadian ship Turbet to keep news of his crimes from his home island. He then sailed north to New York City, taking two more ships, and picking up naval supplies and releasing captives at Gardiners Island. By August 1717, Bonnet had returned to the Carolinas, where he attacked two more ships, a brigantine from Boston and a Barbadian <b>sloop.</b> He stripped the brigantine, but brought the cargo-filled Barbadian <b>sloop</b> to an inlet off North Carolina to use for careening and repairing the Revenge. After the Barbadian sloop's tackle was used to careen the Revenge, the ship was dismantled for timber, and the remains were then burned. In September 1717, Bonnet set course for Nassau, which was then an infamous pirate den on the island of New Providence in the Bahamas. En route, he encountered, fought, and escaped from a Spanish man of war. The Revenge was badly damaged, Bonnet was seriously wounded, and half the crew of the <b>sloop</b> was killed or wounded in the encounter. Putting in at Nassau, Bonnet replaced his casualties and refitted the Revenge, increasing the sloop's armament to twelve guns.|$|E
50|$|Hjelmstjerna {{was forced}} to split his forces to prevent Russian coastal forces from Turku from getting into his rear and {{therefore}} he initially gave Sölfverarm only 8 gun <b>sloops</b> but later reinforced them with further four. He retained 14 gun <b>sloops</b> and 7 galleys for himself and posted 4 additional gun <b>sloops</b> to block other coastal waterways. Sölfverarm {{was aware of the}} weaknesses of his position and started blockading the waterways.|$|R
5000|$|The Royal Navy {{continued}} to build vessels rated as <b>sloops</b> during the interwar years. These <b>sloops</b> were small warships intended for colonial [...] "gunboat diplomacy" [...] deployments, surveying duties, and acting during wartime as convoy escorts. As {{they were not}} intended to deploy with the fleet, <b>sloops</b> had a maximum speed of less than 20 kn. A number of such <b>sloops,</b> for example the [...] and [...] classes, {{were built in the}} interwar years. Fleet minesweepers such as the [...] were rated as [...] "minesweeping sloops". The Royal Navy officially dropped the term [...] "sloop" [...] in 1937, although the term remained in widespread and general use.|$|R
25|$|The Thais-class fireships {{were built}} to a design by John Henslow. The Admiralty {{converted}} them to <b>sloops</b> as the design was {{quite similar to}} that of the Cormorant-class <b>sloops.</b> Between 1811 and 1812 they were re-rated as 20-gun post ships.|$|R
5|$|During the 19th century {{good quality}} {{limestone}} {{and a small}} amount of lead ore were quarried in the village. Jasper was mined at Carreg; granite was quarried at Porth y Pistyll; and there was a brickworks at Porth Neigwl. The main source of income, however, was herring fishing. A regular shipping service was operated to Liverpool, exporting pigs, poultry and eggs; the vessels returned laden with coal for the neighbourhood. Limestone was also imported and offloaded into the water at high tide, then collected from the beach when the tide went out. Lime was needed to reduce the acidity of the local soil, and lime kilns were built on the beaches at Porthor, Porth Orion, Porth Meudwy, Aberdaron and Y Rhiw to convert the limestone to quicklime. There was shipbuilding at Porth Neigwl, where the last ship, a <b>sloop</b> named the Ebenezer, was built in 1841; and at Porthor, which came to an end with the building of a schooner, the Sarah, in 1842. Aberdaron's last ship, the <b>sloop</b> Victory, had been built in 1792, and the last ship to come out of Porth Ysgo had been another <b>sloop,</b> the Grace, in 1778.|$|E
5|$|Failing {{to reach}} their initial {{destination}} of Tobago due to light winds and strong currents, Low's depleted fleet made it to Grenada, a French-owned island. Hiding most of his men belowdecks, he was permitted to send men ashore for water. The following day, a French <b>sloop</b> was sent out to investigate, but was captured when Low's men came out from hiding. Low, now commanding the captured <b>sloop</b> (renamed the Ranger), gave the schooner Squirrel to Spriggs, now his quartermaster, who renamed it the Delight before sailing away {{in the middle of}} the night with a small crew following a disagreement with Low over the disciplining of one of Spriggs' crew.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to receiving the Victoria Cross, Stuart {{was promoted to}} lieutenant commander and given his own command, HMS Tamarisk. Tamarisk was a small <b>sloop</b> built in 1916 that was capable of being disguised as a merchant vessel and used as a Q-ship, designated Q11.|$|E
50|$|The {{archipelago}} fleet also employed traditional galleys {{and several}} types of prams and <b>sloops.</b> After the war of 1788-90, it consisted mostly of smaller vessels, primarily specially designed yawls and <b>sloops</b> that carried {{only one or two}} heavy guns, usually 24-pounders.|$|R
50|$|The Thais-class fireships {{were built}} to a design by John Henslow. The Admiralty {{converted}} them to <b>sloops</b> as the design was {{quite similar to}} that of the Cormorant-class <b>sloops.</b> Between 1811 and 1812 they were re-rated as 20-gun post ships.|$|R
5000|$|On 27 February 1781 two <b>sloops,</b> [...] (Commander Francis Pender), and HMS Surprize (Captain George Day), that Admiral Lord Rodney {{had sent}} {{appeared}} at Demerara. In March, the <b>sloops</b> accepted {{the surrender of}} [...] "Colony of Demarary and the River Essequebo".|$|R
5|$|James Thompson Gerry (1797–1854), {{who left}} West Point upon his father's death and was Commander of the war-sloop USS Albany (1846); the <b>sloop</b> {{disappeared}} with all hands 28 or 29 September 1854 near the West Indies.|$|E
5|$|On 11 February 1944 the corvettes HMA Ships Ipswich and Launceston, in {{conjunction}} with the Indian <b>sloop</b> Jumna, sank the Japanese submarine Ro-110 in the Bay of Bengal after the latter had torpedoed a ship in a Calcutta-bound convoy.|$|E
5|$|On 8 February 1779, Lowestoffe {{captured}} the Vigilant, near the Bite (or Bight) of Leogan. The 70 ton <b>sloop</b> was sailing from Dominique to Philadelphia with a cargo of sugar, rum, molasses, coffee, cotton and salt. John English was her master {{and she had}} a crew of five men.|$|E
50|$|No rig type {{is perfect}} for all conditions. <b>Sloops,</b> with their paucity of spars and control lines, tend to impart less {{aerodynamic}} drag. Compared to other rigs, <b>sloops</b> tend to perform very well when sailing close hauled to windward and generally offer a sound overall compromise of abilities on all points of sail. Cutters, ketches and yawls are often preferred to <b>sloops</b> when venturing far offshore, because {{it is easier to}} reef small sails as the wind increases, while still keeping the boat balanced.|$|R
50|$|The club {{purchased}} {{a pair of}} 18-foot cub class <b>sloops,</b> the original “Jack” and “Jill” which were moored {{in the lee of}} the wharf. The two <b>sloops</b> served the membership well, but the “Jack” was lost on the beach in an early winter storm in 1942.|$|R
50|$|At {{first he}} built wooden <b>sloops,</b> {{the most common}} ship along the river in those days. In their 1908 history The <b>Sloops</b> of the Hudson, William Verplanck and Moses Collyer (whose own house, Driftwood, is nearby) credit him with the {{invention}} of a moveable centerboard that allowed <b>sloops</b> more stable maneuvering in the deeper sections of the river without having to sacrifice their ability to put ashore at shallow ports. The one Carman installed on his boat the Freedom {{is believed to have}} been the first. It became a standard feature shortly thereafter.|$|R
5|$|September 9–10, 1800 – The <b>sloop</b> John founders amid rough seas from a {{tropical}} storm or hurricane; her entire crew is rescued. Bermuda is subjected to a period of gales but suffers no damage.|$|E
5|$|With its {{powerful}} sting and familiar appearance, the wasp has given {{its name to}} many ships, aircraft and military vehicles. Nine ships and one shore establishment of the Royal Navy have been named , the first an 8-gun <b>sloop</b> launched in 1749.|$|E
5|$|At 15:05 another British ship {{appeared}} on the horizon, the <b>sloop</b> , which persuaded Montfort that {{he could no longer}} protect the battered Pomone against superior numbers. Pauline set all sail to the west, away from her opponents who were either too battered or too distant to pursue. Alceste and Active now concentrated their full broadsides on Pomone, which soon lost both masts and was forced to surrender to prevent total destruction. Pauline escaped, later reaching Ancona safely but having suffered severe damage in the engagement.|$|E
50|$|In {{the second}} half of the 19th century, {{successive}} generations of naval guns became larger and with the advent of steam-powered <b>sloops,</b> both paddle and screw, by the 1880s even the most powerful warships had fewer than a dozen large calibre guns, and were therefore technically <b>sloops.</b> Since the rating system was no longer a reliable indicator of a ship's combat power, it was abolished together with it the classifications of <b>sloops,</b> corvettes, and frigates. Instead a classification based on the intended role of the ship became common, such as cruiser and battleship.|$|R
5000|$|... 118-foot and 130-foot <b>sloops</b> {{designed}} by Sparkman & Stephens.|$|R
25|$|John Henslow {{designed}} the Thais class as 18-gun fireships, with a design {{close to that}} of the Tisiphone class of <b>sloops.</b> The Royal Navy used the class as <b>sloops</b> and re-rated them as such in March 1808. In early 1811 most of the class, including Thais, were re-rated as post ships.|$|R
