In susceptible animals, this viral infection results in a hemorrhagic gastroenteritis with very high morbidity and mortality. There is no effective treatment. Etiology Nairobi <b>sheep</b> <b>disease</b> results from infection by a tick–borne virus, Nairobi <b>sheep</b> <b>disease</b> virus (NSDV), in the genus Nairovirus (family Bunyaviridae). Ganjam virus is an Asian variant of this virus. Species Affected Among domesticated and laboratory animals, only sheep and goats can be infected readily by NSDV, and only these species appear to be important as reservoir hosts. A few fatal cases of Nairobi <b>sheep</b> <b>disease</b> have been reported among duikers (Cephalophus monticola) in zoos or in the wild.

The isolation of Nairobi <b>sheep</b> <b>disease</b> virus, Getah, Batai and Arkonam and serological {{evidence of the}} circulation of California encephalitis serogroup and Chandipura viruses have been reported {{for the first time}} in Sri Lanka. The ecology of Japanese encephalitis (JE) in areas with epidemic disease and sylvatic infection has been compared. A synchronous pattern of seroconversion in pigs and seroprevalence in cattle are more predictive of epidemic JE risk than overall porcine seroprevalence which is a good indicator of the presence of sylvatic JE rather than of human epidemic risk. Relatively modest changes in vector abundance associated with rainfall or agricultural practices have dramatic changes on the emergence of epidemic JE. Chandipura virus which is known to cause major outbreaks of encephalitis in India is endemic in Sri Lanka as are viruses belonging to the California encephalitis serogroup. Both these viruses are potential causes of human encephalitis and should be sought in patients with undiagnosed encephalitis. Nairobi <b>sheep</b> <b>disease</b> virus is endemic in animals (especially goats) and infects humans working closely with such livestock.

40|$|In {{the course}} of {{investigating}} suspected cases of viral haemorrhagic fever in South Africa patients were encountered who had been bitten by ticks, but who lacked evidence of infection with Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus or non-viral tick-borne agents. Cattle sera were tested by enzyme-linked immunoassay to determine whether tick-borne viruses other than CCHF occur in the country. The prevalence of antibody in cattle sera was 905 / 2116 (42. 8 %) for CCHF virus, 70 / 1358 (5. 2 %) for Dugbe, 21 / 1358 (1. 5 %) for louping ill, 6 / 450 (1. 3 %) for West Nile, 7 / 1358 (0. 5 %) for Nairobi <b>sheep</b> <b>disease,</b> 3 / 625 (0. 5 %) for Kadam and 2 / 450 (0. 4 %) for Chenuda.

Cross-reactivity for the nairoviruses, Hazara, Nairobi <b>sheep</b> <b>disease</b> and Dugbe, was detected in serum samples from 3 / 72 human patients with confirmed CCHF infection, and serum from 1 / 162 other patients reacted monospecifically with Dugbe antigen.

The final classification model, which included lame walking and all sound activity classes, yielded a prediction accuracy for lame locomotion of 82 %, 35 %, and 87 % for the ear, collar, and leg deployments, respectively.
