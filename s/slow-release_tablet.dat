40|$|The {{efficacy}} and tolerability {{of a new}} formulation of slow-release indomethacin tablet was compared in a double-blind cross-over manner with a conventional indomethacin capsule in 30 patients with ankylosing spondylitis. Gastrointestinal side-effects and dizziness were less frequent during the <b>slow-release</b> <b>tablet</b> period than during the capsule period. KEY WORDS: Ankylosing spondylitis, Indomethacin, Tolerability, <b>Slow-release</b> <b>tablet.</b> INDOMETHACIN {{has been used in}} the treatment of rheumatic disorders for over twenty years and is considered standard therapy for the relief of symptoms in these disorders (1). Despite its considerable anti-inflammatory properties, the occurrence of several adverse effects, usually those of the gastrointestinal and central nervous systems, limits the clinical use of indomethacin (2). The central nervous system effects are assumed to be associated with a high plasma level (3). The authors have recently reported on the pharmacokinetics, {{efficacy and}} tolerability of a new formulation of slow-release indomethacin tablet compared with a conventional capsule in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (4). Side-effects, especially dizziness and diarrhoea, occurred less frequently during the <b>slow-release</b> <b>tablet</b> period than during the capsule period and {{there was no difference in}} efficacy between the formulations. In the present study, the tolerability and efficacy of the slow-release formulation were compared with those of the conventional indomethacin capsule in 30 patients with ankylosing spondylitis...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} nifedipine plasma concentrations after a {{loading dose}} of nifedipine 10 mg capsules, 40 mg over 1 h followed by <b>slow-release</b> <b>tablets</b> (60 mg/d) versus gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) tablets (90 mg/d) for tocolysis. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective study in 14 pregnant women treated for threatened preterm labor. RESULTS: Following capsule administration {{there was a}} rapid rise in plasma concentration of drug achieving a peak of 97. 5 microg/l (median) at 1 h, then declined to 59. 5 microg/l (median) at 5 h. The concentration measured at 7200 min (120 h) was non-significantly higher in the slow-release group (median 25. 5, range 6. 9 - 67. 2 microg/l) than in the GITS group (median 14. 6, range 6. 0 - 20. 0 microg/l). Area under the curve (AUC) increased with the applied dose in both groups in a linear regression. Headache was more frequent in the slow-release group than in the GITS group (P= 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: GITS tablets 90 mg/d are an alternative dosage regimen to previous used <b>slow-release</b> <b>tablets</b> 60 mg/d for tocolysis with similar pharmacokinetic profile and a good tolerance. However, tocolysis with GITS tablets is simpler than that with <b>slow-release</b> <b>tablets</b> and {{may be associated with}} a higher compliance.

In an open, controlled, within-patient study, the pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and tolerability of carbamazepine <b>slow-release</b> <b>tablets</b> were compared with those of carbamazepine suppositories in children with epilepsy. The pharmacokinetic part of the study comprised 22 children, and an additional nine children were included in the clinical part of the study. Treatment with <b>slow-release</b> <b>tablets</b> was replaced for 7 days with carba-mazepine suppositories in bioequivalent dosage. Clinical factors such as the rate of seizures and the local tolerability were studied, and an overall assessment of efficacy was made. In the pharmacokinetic part, 24 -hour plasma concentra-tion curves for carbamazepine and carbamazepine- 10, 11 -epoxide were recorded. The plasma concentration profiles (minimum, maximum, and mean concentrations, fluctuation index, and area under the curve) for carbamazepine and the other metabolites did not show any significant differences between oral and rectal administration when the supposi-tory dose was increased by 25 % compared to the tablets.

Ther. 204 : 240 - 246, 1978. A <b>slow-release</b> <b>tablet</b> containing 12. 5 mEq of potassium chloride was compared with a potassium chloride solution in normal human subjects under controlled conditions. Changes in plasma potassium concentration and rates of urinary potassium excretion indicate the tablet is absorbed in a slow, sustained fashion {{in contrast to the}} solution. Net potassium excretion after single and multiple doses indicates that the amount of potassium absorbed from the <b>slow-release</b> <b>tablet</b> is comparable to the solution. The slow-release potassium chloride tablets were well tolerated and were effective in correcting experimentally induced potassium depletion of moderate severity. Gastrointestinal tract irritation was not apparent and fecal 51 Cr red blood cell loss after the tablet and the solution were of the same order. Potassium replacement is often required when diuretics are used, and it appears that the chloride salt is the most effective for re-placement therapy (Schwartz et at., 1968). This has presented a problem since not all solutions ofpotassium chloride are palatable and enteric-coated tablets have been reported to cause small bowel ulceration (Boley et al., 1965 a,b; Diener et at., 1965; Wynn et at., 1965).

40|$|The lactobacilli {{which are}} present in vaginal fluids play an {{important}} role in prevention of vaginosis and there are considerable interests in formulation of these friendly bacteria into suitable pharmaceutical dosage forms. Formulating these microorganisms for vaginal application is a critical issue as the products should retain viability of lactobacilli during formulation and also storage. The aim of this study was to examine the viability and release of Lactobacillus acidophilus from <b>slow-release</b> vaginal <b>tablets</b> prepared by using six different retarding polymers and from two effervescent tablets prepared by using citric or adipic acid. The Carbomer–based formulations showed high initial viablility compared to those based on HPMC-LV, HPMC-HV, Polycarbophil and SCMC polymers which showed one log decrease in viable cells. All retarding polymers in slow release formulations presented a strong bacterial release at about 2 h except Carbomer polymers which showed to be poor bacterial releasers. Although effervescent formulations produced a quick bacterial release in comparison with polymer based <b>slow-release</b> <b>tablets,</b> they were less stable in cold storage. Due to the strong chelating characteristic of citric acid, the viability was quickly lost for aqueous medium of citric acid in comparison with adipic acid based effervescent tablets...|$|R
40|$|Superoxide {{and other}} oxygen {{radicals}} produced by activated polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) {{may be important}} causes of tissue damage {{in a number of}} inflammatory conditions. Therefore, a drug which suppresses PMN responses in vivo is potentially important. In vitro, pentoxifylline (PTOX) inhibits superoxide anion production when PMN are stimulated with an activated complement component (C 5 a Des Arg) or formyl peptides but only at concentrations not achieved in the circulation. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether PTOX has an effect on PMN responses in vivo. Superoxide anion production, monitored by lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence, was inhibited by 40. 5 % +/- 8. 0 % (n = 8, P < 0. 009) for C 5 a Des Arg and 47. 7 % +/- 9. 6 % (n = 8, P < 0. 009) for formyl-methionylleucylphenylalanine stimulation 1. 5 h after ingestion of 400 mg of PTOX in a <b>slow-release</b> <b>tablet,</b> with some inhibitory effects persisting at 5 h. There was a strong correlation between reduced PMN response to activated complement and plasma concentrations of three PTOX metabolites (P < 0. 05), but not with plasma concentrations of the parent drug. In vitro investigations with each of the four methylxanthines showed two of these metabolites to be most effective at reducing PMN respiratory burst activity, lactoferrin release, and the expression of CD 11 b and CD 18 molecules. Furthermore, this in vitro inhibitory activity was achieved at concentrations of metabolites achievable in vivo.

Unpublished observations indicate that it can also antagonize the growth of other bacteria involved in acute otitis media. Because {{of its ability to}} colonize the oral cavity and its safety profile, we have tested its efficacy in reducing the incidence of streptococcal pharyngitis and/or tonsillitis and episodes of acute otitis media. Methods: We enrolled 82 children, including 65 with and 17 without a recent diagnosis of recurrent oral streptococcal pathology. Of those with recurrent pathology, 45 were treated daily for 90 days with an oral <b>slow-release</b> <b>tablet</b> containing five billion colony-forming units of S. salivarius K 12 (Bactoblis&reg;), and the remaining 20 served as an untreated control group. The 17 children without a recent diagnosis of recurrent oral pathology were used as an additional control group. After 90 days of treatment, a 6 -month follow-up period without treatment was included to evaluate a possible persistent protective role for the previously administered product. Results: The 41 children who completed the 90 -day course of Bactoblis showed a reduction in their episodes of streptococcal pharyngeal infection (about 90 %) and/or acute otitis media (about 40 %), calculated by comparing infection rates in the previous year. The 90 -day treatment also reduced the reported incidence of pharyngeal and ear infections by about 65 % in the 6 -month follow-up period during which the product was not administered. Subjects tolerated the product well, with no side effects or dropouts reported.

S. salivarius K 12 successfully colonizes the oral cavity, and is endowed with an excellent safety profile. We tested its preventive role in reducing the incidence of both streptococcal and viral pharyngitis and/or tonsillitis in children. Materials and methods: We enrolled 61 children with a diagnosis of recurrent oral streptococcal disorders. Thirty-one of them were enrolled to be treated daily for 90 days with a <b>slow-release</b> <b>tablet</b> for oral use, containing no less than 1 billion colony-forming units/tablet of S. salivarius K 12 (Bactoblis®), and the remaining 30 served as the untreated control group. During treatment, they were all examined for streptococcal infection. Twenty children (ten per group) were also assessed in terms of viral infection. Secondary end points in both groups were {{the number of days}} under antibiotic and antipyretic therapy and the number of days off school (children) and off work (parents). Results: The 30 children who completed the 90 -day trial with Bactoblis® showed a significant reduction in their episodes of streptococcal pharyngeal infection (> 90 %), as calculated by comparing the infection rates of the previous year. No difference was observed in the control group. The treated group showed a significant decrease in the incidence (80 %) of oral viral infections. Again, {{there was no difference in}} the control group. With regard to secondary end points, the number of days under antibiotic treatment of the treated and control groups were 30 and 900 respectively, days under antipyretic treatment 16 and 228, days of absence from school 16 and 228, and days of absence from work 16 and 228. The product was well tolerated by the subjects, with no side effects, and only one individual reported bad product palatability and dropped out. Conclusion: Prophylactic administration of S. salivarius K 12 to children with a history of recurrent oral streptococcal disease resulted in a considerable reduction of episodes of both streptococcal and viral infections and reduced the number of days under antibiotic and/or antipyretic therapy and days of absence from school or work.

40|$|Abstract Background Post-transplant anaemia {{remains a}} common problem after kidney transplantation, with an {{incidence}} ranging from nearly 80 % at day 0 to about 25 % at 1 year. It {{has been associated with}} poor graft outcome, and recently has also been shown to be associated with increased mortality. Our transplant unit routinely administers oral iron supplements to renal transplant recipients but this is frequently accompanied by side effects, mainly gastrointestinal intolerance. Intravenous iron is frequently administered to dialysis patients and we sought to investigate this mode of administration in transplant recipients after noticing less anaemia in several patients who had received intravenous iron just prior to being called in for transplantation. Methods This study is a single-centre, prospective, open-label, randomised, controlled trial of oral versus intravenous iron supplements in renal transplant recipients and aims to recruit approximately 100 patients over a 12 -month period. Patients will be randomised to receive a single dose of 500 mg iron polymaltose (intravenous iron group) or 2 ferrous sulphate <b>slow-release</b> <b>tablets</b> daily (oral iron group). The primary outcome is time to normalisation of haemoglobin post-transplant. Prospective power calculations have indicated that a minimum of 48 patients in each group would have to be followed up for 3 months {{in order to have a}} 90 % probability of detecting a halving of the time to correction of haemoglobin levels to ≥ 110 g/l in iron-treated patients, assuming an α of 0. 05. All eligible adult patients undergoing renal transplantation at the Princess Alexandra Hospital will be offered participation in the trial. Exclusion criteria will include iron overload (transferrin saturation > 50 % or ferritin > 800 μg/l), or previous intolerance of either oral or intravenous iron supplements. Discussion If the trial shows a reduction in the time to correction of anaemia with intravenous iron or less side effects than oral iron, then intravenous iron may become the standard of treatment in this patient group. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{clinical}} efficacy, the bronchodilating {{effect and}} {{the side effects of}} two oral forms of terbutaline were compared in a double-blind, cross-over study involving ten patients with chronic reversible airways obstruction. The administration of plain-tablets, containing 2. 5 mg terbutaline sulphate, three times daily at 6 h intervals was compared to the administration of <b>slow-release</b> (SR) <b>tablets,</b> containing 5 mg terbutaline sulphate, every 12 h. Each course of treatment lasted for 7 days. Treatment with SR-tablets resulted in significantly higher lung function values in the morning (PEFR at home and FEV 1 at the lung function laboratory on day 7). There {{were no significant differences between}} the two forms with regard to symptom score, extra use of rimiterol aerosol, heart rate or blood pressure. The plasma terbutaline concentration in the morning of the seventh treatment day was significantly higher during SR-tablet treatment. The plasma terbutaline concentration curve showed a smaller peak/trough ratio for the SR-tablets...|$|R
40|$|Maternal {{diabetes}} {{is one of}} major causes of congenital malformations in offspring, but the underlying mechanism is still unclear. MiRNAs {{play an important role}} in transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. However, no miRNA expression profiling of hyperglycemic offspring are thus far available. Female mice were made diabetic with streptozotocin, treated with <b>slow-release</b> insulin <b>tablets,</b> and mated. MiRNA expression profiling with Next Generation Sequencing on the SOLiD 5 platform was performed on 8 control and 5 hyperglycemic embryonic day (ED) 8. 5 and 9 control and 6 hyperglycemic ED 9. 5 embryos. Differential expression was analyzed with the Wald test. On ED 8. 5, the abundance of expressed miRNAs was similar in control and hyperglycemic ED 8. 5 embryos. The spectrum of expressed miRNAs had not changed in ED 9. 5 embryos, but the abundance of most miRNAs increased ∼ 5 -fold in control embryos. However, hyperglycemic D 9. 5 embryos were unable to mount this increase in prevalence. Only 3 miRNAs were differentially expressed in control and hyperglycemic ED 9. 5 embryos, but their putative target genes were underrepresented in the Jackson database of genes causing cardiovascular or neural malformation...|$|R
40|$|We {{assessed}} {{the effect on}} blood pressure of administration of <b>slow-release</b> nifedipine <b>tablets</b> (20 mg) by continuous intraarterial blood pressure monitoring (Oxford system) in 10 patients with untreated essential hypertension. Blood pressure was recorded under control conditions and during nifedipine therapy. During each monitoring period patients were instructed to perform various types of exercise. The initial dose of nifedipine was 20 mg twice a day (8 : 00 a. m. and 8 : 00 p. m.). For patients in whom arterial pressure control was not achieved, the dose of the drug was increased at weekly intervals, first to 40 mg {{in the morning and}} 20 mg at night and then to 40 mg twice a day. The average daily dose was 52 mg. Nifedipine twice a day significantly reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressures both during the day and during the night. The rise in blood pressure due to dynamic or isometric exercise or to mental testing was blunted. Heart rate did not change. Orthostatic hypotension was not observed, and there were only minor side effects, which did not require withdrawal of the patient from the trial. Bioavailability of nifedipine from this preparation was satisfactory, as shown by plasma concentrations which remained constantly in the therapeutic range. Thus, slow-release nifedipine given twice a day represents an effective treatment in patients with essential arterial hypertension. The reduced frequency of administration required may improve patient compliance with this treatment...|$|R
40|$|Interest {{into the}} effects of {{carnosine}} on cellular metabolism is rapidly expanding. The first study to demonstrate in humans that chronic β-alanine (BA) supplementation (~ 3 - 6 g BA/day for ~ 4 weeks) can result in significantly augmented muscle carnosine concentrations (> 50 %) was only recently published. BA supplementation is potentially poised for application beyond the niche exercise and performance-enhancement field and into other more clinical populations. When examining all BA supplementation studies that directly measure muscle carnosine (n= 8), {{there is a significant}} linear correlation between total grams of BA consumed (of daily intake ranges of 1. 6 - 6. 4 g BA/day) versus both the relative and absolute increases in muscle carnosine. Supporting this, a recent dose-response study demonstrated a large linear dependency (R 2 = 0. 921) based on the total grams of BA consumed over 8 weeks. The pre-supplementation baseline carnosine or individual subjects' body weight (from 65 to 90 kg) does not appear to impact on subsequent carnosine synthesis from BA consumption. Once muscle carnosine is augmented, the washout is very slow (~ 2 %/week). Recently, a <b>slow-release</b> BA <b>tablet</b> supplement has been developed showing a smaller peak plasma BA concentration and delayed time to peak, with no difference in the area under the curve compared to pure BA in solution. Further, this slow-release profile resulted in a reduced urinary BA loss and improved retention, while at the same time, eliciting minimal paraesthesia symptoms. However, our complete understanding of optimizing in vivo delivery and dosing of BA is still in its infancy. Thus, this review will clarify our current knowledge of BA supplementation to augment muscle carnosine as well as highlight future research questions on the regulatory points of control for muscle carnosine synthesis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Injections of {{mixtures}} prepared from crushed tablets contain insoluble particles {{which can}} cause embolisms and other complications. Although many particles can be removed by filtration, many injecting drug users do not filter due to availability, cost or performance of filters, and also due to concerns {{that some of the}} dose will be lost. Methods Injection solutions were prepared from <b>slow-release</b> morphine <b>tablets</b> (MS Contin ®) replicating methods used by injecting drug users. Contaminating particles were counted by microscopy and morphine content analysed by liquid chromatography before and after filtration. Results Unfiltered tablet extracts contained tens of millions of particles with a range in sizes from 400 μm. Cigarette filters removed most of the larger particles (> 50 μm) but the smaller particles remained. Commercial syringe filters (0. 45 and 0. 22 μm) produced a dramatic reduction in particles but tended to block unless used after a cigarette filter. Morphine was retained by all filters but could be recovered by following the filtration with one or two 1 ml washes. The combined use of a cigarette filter then 0. 22 μm filter, with rinses, enabled recovery of 90 % of the extracted morphine in a solution which was essentially free of tablet-derived particles. Conclusions Apart from overdose and addiction itself, the harmful consequences of injecting morphine tablets come from the insoluble particles from the tablets and microbial contamination. These harmful components can be substantially reduced by passing the injection through a sterilizing (0. 22 μm) filter. To prevent the filter from blocking, a preliminary coarse filter (such as a cigarette filter) should be used first. The filters retain some of the dose, but this can be recovered by following filtration with one or two rinses with 1 ml water. Although filtration can reduce the non-pharmacological harmful consequences of injecting tablets, this remains an unsafe practice due to skin and environmental contamination by particles and microorganisms, and the risks of blood-borne infections from sharing injecting equipment. </p...|$|R
40|$|Species {{prescriptions}} {{are developed}} for revegetating abandoned acidic coal overburden seepage {{sites in the}} Collie region of Western Australia. The research involved selecting appropriate plant species and determining successful methods of enhancing revegetation. Candidate species were screened for tolerance to acidic overburden materials, local climate conditions and metal toxicity. Methods tested included improving spoil conditions and trialing an alternative method for seeding. Twelve species of native plants were tested for tolerance in two acid overburden materials in pot and field trials. Eucalyptus robusta is the most tolerant, Eucalyptus camaldulensis and Eucalyptus cladocalyx are highly tolerant, Eucalyptus rudis and Melaleuca hamulosa demonstrate potential, provided adequate soil moisture is available. An important growth restriction factor in acid soils {{is the presence of}} free aluminium ions. A glasshouse trial performed on seven species for tolerance to aluminium toxicity revealed E. robusta as most tolerant and E. camaldulensis and Kunzea ericifolia a highly tolerant. E. rudis and M. hamulosa are moderately tolerant, but E. cladocalyx and Eucalyptus diversicolor are very sensitive to aluminium. Various methods were trialed to increase growth of seedlings transplanted on to acidic overburden sites. Both commercial cow manure and <b>slow-release</b> fertiliser <b>tablets</b> increase growth, whereas commercial potting mix and lime do not. Inoculation of plants with the ectomycorrhiza fungus Pisolithus tinctorius increases the amount of infection in roots but does not enhance plant growth. Supplementary fertilisation is necessary to maintain growth (nitrogen) and restore chlorophyll production (phosphorus) in fast growing eucalypt seedlings planted into typical acidic spoils. Poor levels of nutrient availability in such acidic sites appear to be the primary factor in ++retarding growth. In the absence of supplementation, foliage reddening is observed in several species. An alternative method of seeding dumps is fascining. Prepared dump surfaces may be covered with capsule-laden branchwood of myrtaceous species. Material of the locally available Kunzea ericifolia is effective in producing many seedlings. Subsequent seedling growth is enhanced with fertiliser and lime addition...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{bending point}} {{criterion}} {{was developed and}} compared {{with a number of}} existing criteria for the interpretation of certain dissolution profiles; these comparison criteria were the percentage dissolved at a fixed time point, the fitted Weibull parameters, and the area tinder the dissolution curve (AUC). The statistical bending point model was applied to dissolution curves that showed linear dissolution. The bending point model is based on a general linear model, and its confidence information is obtained using the variance-covariance matrix of the parameter estimates. Practically, three time points in the linear part and two time points on the plateau level are used for a reliable bending point estimation. A comparative study with three batches and three storage conditions of <b>slow-release</b> mucoadhesive buccal <b>tablets</b> was performed. The relative standard deviation (RSD) values of the bending point were typically between 1 % and 5 %, which are considerably lower than the corresponding values of the other criteria (typically between 3 % and 15 %). The bending point criterion is considered robust and stable for the characterization of certain dissolution profiles. Moreover, the bending point has a particular physical interpretation that is helpful in the framework of the slow-release application of this buccal tablet...|$|R
40|$|Phytochemicals may protect {{cellular}} DNA {{by direct}} antioxidant effect or modulation of the DNA repair activity. We investigated the repair activity towards oxidised DNA in human mononuclear blood cells (MNBC) in two placebo-controlled antioxidant intervention studies as follows: (1) well-nourished subjects who ingested 600 g fruits and vegetables, or tablets containing the equivalent amount of vitamins and minerals, for 24 d; (2) poorly nourished male smokers who ingested 500 mg vitamin C/d as slow- or plain-release formulations together with 182 mg vitamin E/d for 4 weeks. The mean baseline levels of DNA repair incisions were 65 · 2 (95 % CI 60 · 4, 70 · 0) and 86 · 1 (95 % CI 76 · 2, 99 · 9) among the male smokers and well-nourished subjects, respectively. The male smokers also had high baseline levels of oxidised guanines in MNBC. After supplementation, only the male smokers supplemented with <b>slow-release</b> vitamin C <b>tablets</b> had increased DNA repair activity (27 (95 % CI 12, 41) % higher incision activity). These subjects also {{benefited from the}} supplementation by reduced levels of oxidised guanines in MNBC. In conclusion, nutritional status, DNA repair activity and DNA damage are linked, and beneficial effects of antioxidants might only be observed among poorly nourished subjects {{with high levels of}} oxidised DNA damage and low repair activity...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT; Test dose {{methods have}} been used to predict the {{maintenance}} dosage of lithium carbonate tablets in bipolar patients. These methods require a lithium analytical method that is accurate to the second decimal place. Successful use of these test methods has employed the atomic absorption spectrophotometric method, yet many hospitals use a flame spectrophotometric method. We evaluated a two-point method to predict lithium maintenance dosages of <b>slow-release</b> lithium carbonate <b>tablets</b> in 20 bipolar patients using both assay methodologies. No clinically {{significant differences were found between}} the two sets of predictions, suggesting that either assay methodology has requisite sensitivity and accuracy for use in test dose predictions of lithium maintenance dosages.
