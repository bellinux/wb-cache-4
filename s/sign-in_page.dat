This note was within a button that would take the user to the <b>sign-in</b> <b>page.</b> An early report sent to a mailing list within a couple hours of this change's happening also indicated that some functions in new FamilySearch, particularly that which allowed users to combine matching entries of ancestors ('duplicates'), had been turned off. This event signaled that a wider user base would begin using Family Tree.|$|E

BY ABBAS MOALLEM og-in and <b>sign-in</b> <b>pages</b> are important components of most commercial Web sites. Through log-in pages, users can enter data for an application, perform daily tasks, access content, place orders, or view their accounts or the status of their orders. A user might log in to several sites for a variety of reasons. For example, one might log in to a bank Web site to perform transactions, to a brokerage account to trade stocks, or to an e-mail account to view or send e-mails. Consequently, one might log in more than 10 times in a typical day. The information that users enter on various log-in and <b>sign-in</b> <b>pages</b> is almost identical: their usernames and pass-words. Occasionally (sometimes frequently), users forget their usernames or passwords and must either get help to remember them or ask for their information to be reset. Even though the components of log-in or <b>sign-in</b> <b>pages</b> seem to be almost identical, there are important inconsisten-cies and differences among commercial and public Web sites, making the user's task more complicated. These include the vocabulary, the physical attributes of the objects, and the configuration of the pages. Besides forgetting their different usernames and passwords, users often must select a different username or password based on the security requirements of each site (Krause 2003; Sasse, Brostoff, & Weirich 2001). To improve and standardize the log-in page, it is important to investigate current design and user preferences in this domain. In this article, I describe a study whose results I hope will aid designers in making more effective log-in and slgn-m pages. Fo ot your U:;llr 10...|$|R
