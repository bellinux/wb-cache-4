50|$|Pique fabrics are {{a type of}} dobby construction. Piques may be {{constructed}} in various patterns such as cord, waffle, honeycomb and birdseye piques. These fabrics require the addition of extra yarns, called <b>stuffer</b> <b>yarns.</b> These <b>stuffer</b> <b>yarns</b> are incorporated {{into the back of}} the fabric to give texture and added depth to the fabric design. Some piques may be made using the Jacquard attachment on the loom. Although made of 100% cotton today, cotton-silk blends and even pure silk versions were made in the past and in a variety of weaves.|$|E
40|$|The {{advent of}} three {{dimensional}} (3 D) reinforcements has been mainly {{to overcome the}} issue of delamination and improve upon the damage tolerance properties by introducing fibres in the thickness direction for advanced composite applications. 3 D preforms can be developed using various techniques. Angle-interlock weaving is one of them. This paper details about the efforts being put at CSIR-NAL for developing angle-interlock woven preforms. Four types of angle-interlock structures viz., layer-to-layer and through thickness (both with and without <b>stuffer</b> <b>yarns)</b> were developed using 6 K, 400 Tex TC- 33 grade Carbon tows on a custom designed handloom. The preforms without <b>stuffer</b> <b>yarns</b> had 4 layers of warp and were of 1. 5 ± 0. 2 mm thick. Preforms with <b>stuffer</b> <b>yarns</b> had 6 layers of warp (including 2 stuffer yarn layers) and were of 2. 3 ± 0. 1 mm thick. Thermoset composites were prepared from these preforms using EPOLAM 2063 (an epoxy based resin system) by RTM process. The fibre weight fraction for these composites ranged from 0. 53 to 0. 58 and they were subjected to mechanical tests such as tensile, flexural and interlaminar shear strength. Test results showed improved response (in the warp direction) with respect to shear properties while the tensile and flexural properties were equivalent {{to that of the}} plain woven composites...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: In this paper, {{the virtual}} {{material}} characterization of three dimen-sional (3 D) orthogonal woven composite materials is investigated by large-scale finite element analyses {{to predict the}} elastic properties. To numerically model the complex geometry of 3 D orthogonal woven composites, a unit structure including the <b>stuffer</b> <b>yarns,</b> filler yarns, weaver yarns, and the resin region is generated based on direct numerical simulation (DNS) and the unit structures with the same pattern are assembled into an orthogonal woven composite structure composed of several millions of degrees of freedom. The influence of the geometrical irregularities, such as the inconsistent tow spacing and the waviness of the filler yarn, on the mechanical properties are also discussed by separately generating the yarns and the resin. From the numerical examples, it is shown that the pattern of tow distribution affects the shear modulus, and the direct modeling of the wavy yarns can produce more accurate stiffness knockdown. It is also emphasized that large-scale numerical analyses {{can be one of}} the methodologies sufficient for the material characterization of the orthogonal woven composites and can be more applicable in the realistic structure subject to complex loading compared to the unit cell approach.
