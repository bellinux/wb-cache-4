40|$|Background: Scientific studies {{confirm that}} {{electromagnetic}} radiation (EMR) can have {{adverse effects on}} the body. Floww Health Technology (FHT) is designed to eliminate the adverse symptoms of radiation and to support and enhance the natural energy of the body by converting harmful radiation into body friendly radiation frequencies (Westerman, 2013). To date {{there is a lack}} of scientific evidence supporting these claims. Methods: The setup was an explorative pilot study executed in a clinical university environment by an expert with no relations with FHT, supervised by a second university. The participants were volunteers. Each participant was measured at four moments: a baseline, after 5 minutes with a smartphone, after a rest period of 5 minutes and after 5 minutes with a smartphone with a mobileFloww device attached. Observations of the blood circulation were accomplished using the Cytocam, a novel third-generation computer controlled imaging sensor based microscope, which incorporates IDF. (Aykut et al., 2015, Sherman et al., 1971) Microcirculatory blood circulation was imaged on the skin surface near the ear. The primary outcome was the change in mean blood flow index (MFI) that is calculated from the Cytocam data, divided into three categories for blood flow speed. Results: Seven healthy male participants were assessed. The MFI and Perfused Vessel Density (PVD) showed a significant decrease for the mobileFloww (p= 0. 03, p= 0. 03). Vessel diameter and blood volume showed a significant increase (p= 0. 04, p= 0. 04) for the lowest <b>speed</b> <b>category.</b> The <b>mean</b> number of data points across participants for the three flow <b>speed</b> <b>categories</b> was 239, 1375 and 1847 respectively. The distribution of data points across flow <b>speed</b> <b>categories</b> showed a significant shift towards lower flow speed with a mobileFloww compared to without (p= 0. 02). Conclusions: The interpretation of these results seems to suggest that there might be an effect of a larger relaxation of the vessel wall with the use of Floww technology. It is clear that these results show that interpretation of the results is feasible and that the effects of Floww technology on the blood flow properties of the ear microcirculation could be evaluated. However, a more comprehensive study is needed to support the initial impressions obtained from this pilot study. More subjects and more elaborate quantitative analysis of blood flow measurements is required...|$|R

Despite existing evidence that males ski significantly faster than females, no sex-specific factor was inserted into the ISO 11088 standard. Objective To evaluate factors potentially associated with the perception of individual skiing speed among recreational skiers. Methods Skiing speeds of 416 adult skiers (62 %males,) were measured with a radar speed gun. Ski-ers were interviewed about their age, sex, skill level, risk taking behaviour and helmet use.

40|$|It takes {{long time}} and huge {{amount of money to}} {{construct}} inter-city railway network. Careful demand forecasting and rational service planning are therefore required. However, long ranged demand forecasting is always facing to unintended change of regional population or change of the service level of competing transportation modes such as airline and inter-city express bus. Those changes sometimes resulted in severe decrease of demand for the constructed railway lines and discussion of abolishment of train service occurs. In order to avoid such tragedy, we want to build a robust network plan not vulnerable for the changes in forecasting conditions. This paper discusses the robustness of optimal inter-city railway network structure in Japan against alternative population distributions. Genetic Algorithm is applied to find best mixture of maximum operation <b>speed</b> <b>category</b> and number of daily train service for each link, which maximize the total consumer surplus of inter-city railway passengers. Consumer surplus is assessed by a gravity demand model considering service level along several routes for each OD pair. Travel time calculated by allocated link <b>speed</b> <b>category,</b> allocated train frequency, and estimated fare regressed by travel speed, will be summarized as route service level via ML route choice model parameters. In the GA, we consider a chromosome consists of two parts; <b>speed</b> <b>category</b> of 275 links and relative operation distance of trains in those links. Besides the real distribution of population in 197 Japanese local areas in the year of 1995, we set four other hypothetic population distributions; two of them concentrate in megalopolises like Tokyo, others disperse along geographically remote areas. We first obtain network structures optimized by the GA for each population setting. <b>Speed</b> <b>category</b> allocation will be compared for the five network plans. Secondly, we calculate total consumer surplus of each network plan under the different population settings and discuss the vulnerability of those plans. Thirdly, we optimize train operation plans for different population settings under the given <b>speed</b> <b>category</b> arrangements. The results shows that spatial arrangement of high speed railway service in 1995 keeps optimality for wide range of population settings, if we adjust number of trains according to alternative population distribution. ...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the {{physical}} and tactical performances of a professional football team under congested and non-congested fixture periods. Six home matches of an English professional football team were analysed during competitive season (3 matches distancing three days from the previous fixture and 3 matches distancing six or more days from the previous fixture). Players’ physical performances were measured by the total distance covered and distance covered at different <b>speed</b> <b>categories.</b> Tactical performances were measured by the percentage of time of players’ movement synchronisation of lateral and longitudinal displacements. This variable was calculated considering all the possible pairs of outfield players, for the overall match and at different <b>speed</b> <b>categories.</b> Results showed no differences in the physical performance, although players’ spent more time synchronised during the non-congested fixtures compared to congested fixtures, both for lateral (41. 26 % to 38. 51 %, ES: − 0. 3, P < 0. 001) and longitudinal displacements (77. 22 % to 74. 48 %, ES: − 0. 5, P < 0. 001). These coordination differences were particularly evident at the lower <b>speed</b> <b>categories</b> and in dyads composed by positions that tend to be further apart during the match, typically central and wing positioned players. Tactical performance seems to be affected by fixtures distribution, with players’ spending more time synchronised during the non-congested fixtures. As players’ cover the same amount of distance at similar intensities in both fixtures distribution, this reduction of synchronisation may be associated with an increased perception of fatigue and consequent adaptation strategies...|$|R
40|$|NASA's LSP, GSDO {{and other}} {{programs}} use the probability of cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning occurrence issued by the 45 th Weather Squadron (45 WS) in their daily and weekly lightning probability forecasts. These organizations use this information when planning potentially hazardous outdoor activities, such as working with fuels, or rolling a vehicle to a launch pad, or whenever personnel will work outside and would be at-risk from lightning. These organizations would benefit greatly if the 45 WS could provide more accurate timing of the first CG lightning strike of the day. The Applied Meteorology Unit (AMU) has made significant improvements in forecasting the probability of lightning for the day, but forecasting {{the time of the}} first CG lightning with confidence has remained a challenge. To address this issue, the 45 WS requested the AMU to determine if flow regimes, wind <b>speed</b> <b>categories,</b> or a combination of the two could be used to forecast the timing of the first strike of the day in the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) /Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS) lightning warning circles. The data was stratified by various sea breeze flow regimes and <b>speed</b> <b>categories</b> in the surface to 5, 000 -ft layer. The surface to 5, 000 -ft layer was selected since that is the layer the 45 WS uses to predict the behavior of sea breeze fronts, which are the dominant influence on the occurrence of first lightning in Florida during the warm season. Due to small data sample sizes after stratification, the AMU could not determine a statistical relationship between flow regimes or <b>speed</b> <b>categories</b> and {{the time of the first}} CG strike [...] As expected, although the amount and timing of lightning activity varies by time of day based on the flow regimes and <b>speed</b> <b>categories,</b> there are extended tails of low lightning activity making it difficult to specify times when the threat of the first lightning flash can be avoided. However, the AMU developed a graphical user interface with input from the 45 WS that allows forecasters to visualize the climatological frequencies of the timing of the first lightning strike. This tool should contribute directly to the 45 WS goal of improving lightning timing capability for its NASA, US Air Force and commercial customers...|$|R
