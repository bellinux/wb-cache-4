5|$|<b>Soybean</b> {{cultivation}}: The {{cultivation of}} soybeans {{began in the}} eastern half of northern China by 2000 BC, but is almost certainly much older. Liu et al. (1997) stated that <b>soybean</b> originated in China and was domesticated about 3500 BC. By the 5th century, soybeans were being cultivated in much of eastern Asia, but the crop did not move beyond this region until well into the 20th century. Written records of the cultivation and use of the <b>soybean</b> in China date back {{at least as far as}} the Western Zhou Dynasty.|$|E

40|$|Two {{in vitro}} {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine the rates of lipolysis and biohydrogenation of fat from raw or processed <b>soybeans</b> and to examine subsequent effects upon fiber digestibilities. In experiment 1, substrates containing soy oil; raw soybeans; extruded soybeans; and <b>soybeans</b> roasted at 270, 295, or 325 °F were incubated with ruminal contents for 2, 4, 6, 12, or 24 hr, and release of free fatty acids was measured. The fatty acids released from substrates containing soy oil, extruded <b>soybeans,</b> and raw or roasted <b>soybeans</b> reached maximums at 4, 6, and 12 hr incubations, respectively. Fatty acids in roasted <b>soybeans</b> were subjected to less biohydrogenation than those in raw or extruded <b>soybeans,</b> suggesting that fatty acids of roasted <b>soybeans</b> are protected partially from ruminal bacteria. At all incubation times, the substrates containing soy oil or extruded <b>soybeans</b> had lower and those containing roasted <b>soybeans</b> had higher fiber digestibilities...|$|R
40|$|<b>Soybeans</b> {{contain a}} wealth of health-promoting phytochemicals, the amounts of which are known to vary {{considerably}} across genotypes and growing conditions. The present work is dedicated to better understand these variations and to improve the methods for investigating soy phytochemicals. To address {{the first of these}} concerns, low-linolenic <b>soybeans</b> and colored seed coat <b>soybeans</b> were investigated for their health beneficial components, as well as their chemical and biological properties. A study of low-linolenic <b>soybeans</b> showed their similar antioxidant activity, total phenolics, and isoflavones to normal fatty acid <b>soybeans.</b> The potential for a different trend in tocopherols and lutein was observed between low-linolenic and regular fatty acid <b>soybeans,</b> but the limited study size prevented a definitive conclusion. This work was the basis for further studies on low-linolenic <b>soybeans</b> not included in this report. Subsequently, a study of eighteen <b>soybeans</b> of brown, green, yellow and black seed coat colors concluded that black seed coat <b>soybeans</b> had significantly higher scavenging activity against hydroxyl, peroxyl, and ABTS+ radicals.

5000|$|At this time, {{there was}} a growing {{interest}} in <b>soybeans.</b> <b>Soybeans</b> are a legume; bacteria nodules on the roots of legumes turn atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia through a process called nitrogen [...] "fixing", enriching the soil. This alone made <b>soybeans</b> useful in crop rotation, but <b>soybeans</b> {{were known to be}} high in protein and vegetable oil as well.|$|R
5|$|<b>Soybean</b> oil: Chinese records dating {{prior to}} 2000 B.C. mention {{the use of}} {{cultivated}} soybeans to produce edible soy oil. Ancient Chinese literature reveals that soybeans were extensively cultivated and highly valued as a use for the <b>soybean</b> oil production process before written records were kept.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Indiana farmer Vernon Hugh Bowman bought <b>soybean</b> crop {{seeds from}} a local grain {{elevator}} for his second crop of the season. He then saved seeds from his second crop to replant additional crops in later years. Bowman purchased these <b>soybean</b> seeds from the same elevator to which he and neighbors sold their <b>soybean</b> crops, {{many of which were}} transgenic, and the elevator sold these soybeans as commodities, not as seeds for planting. He tested the new seeds, and found that, as he had expected, some were transgenic and thus were resistant to glyphosate. He replanted seeds from the original second harvest in subsequent years for his second seasonal planting, supplementing them with more soybeans he bought at the elevator. He informed Monsanto of his activities.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Sanders and KFC used {{hydrogenated}} {{vegetable oil}} for frying, {{but in the}} 1980s the company began to switch to cheaper oils such as palm or <b>soybean.</b> In the 2000s {{it became apparent that}} these oils contain relatively high levels of trans fat, which increases the risk of heart disease. By April 2007, the chain had switched to trans fat-free <b>soybean</b> oil in all of its US outlets.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Soybeans</b> {{are also}} an {{increasingly}} important crop, with [...] additional planted between 2002 and 2007. <b>Soybeans</b> are a major crop {{in the eastern part}} of the state, and cultivation is common in the southeast part of the state. <b>Soybeans</b> were not grown at all in North Dakota in the 1940s, but the crop has become especially common since 1998. In North Dakota <b>soybeans</b> have to mature fast, because of the comparatively short growing season. <b>Soybeans</b> are grown for livestock feed.|$|R

40|$|<b>Soybeans</b> were roasted in an {{experimental}} roaster during 2 or 3 minutes either at 380 or 490 ºC air temperature and kept or not for 30 minutes under steeping. The heat treatment effects on <b>soybeans</b> were evaluated {{in a first}} trial through two different procedures: a) after 16 hours of an “in situ” ruminal incubation period, all heat treated <b>soybeans</b> showed an increased (P 0, 05). In a second trial, <b>soybeans</b> roasted at 380 ºC, during 2 minutes and kept under steeping were included in isonitrogenous and isocaloric lactating dairy cows rations and evaluated in comparison to raw <b>soybeans,</b> with two other protein sources as references. There were no differences (P> 0, 05) between the roasted and raw <b>soybeans</b> diets related either to dry matter or crude protein intakes, milk yield and composition and plasma urea nitrogen (PUN) and milk urea nitrogen (MUN) concentrations, but roasted <b>soybeans</b> yielded significantly (P< 0, 05) more milk per kg of dry matter or crude protein intake than raw <b>soybeans...</b>|$|R
5|$|After two years, Glidden {{abandoned}} {{production of}} cortisone {{to concentrate on}} Substance S. Julian developed a multistep process for conversion of pregnenolone, available in abundance from <b>soybean</b> oil sterols, to cortexolone. In 1952, Glidden, which had been producing progesterone and other steroids from <b>soybean</b> oil, shut down its own production and began importing them from Mexico through an arrangement with Diosynth (a small Mexican company founded in 1947 by Russell Marker after leaving Syntex). Glidden's cost of production of cortexolone was relatively high, so Upjohn decided to use progesterone, available in large quantity at low cost from Syntex, to produce cortisone and hydrocortisone.|$|E
5|$|Biodiesel (in its pure form) is a non-toxic, {{biodegradable}} form {{of diesel}} fuel made from vegetable oil, usually <b>soybean</b> oil or recycled restaurant grease.

40|$|Important {{compositional}} elements, including residues of herbicides, {{were investigated}} in commercial soy varieties grown {{within the same}} geographical area. These included genetically modified, conventional and organic <b>soybeans.</b> Feed made from these <b>soybeans</b> was subsequently fed to the model organism Daphnia magna, while measuring the fitness performance (survival, growth and reproduction) during the full life cycle of the animals. The conventional and organic samples contained no residues of glyphosate or its degradation product AMPA, but the GM-soy contained such residues, averaging 9. 0 mg/kg. The fitness of D. magna fed organic <b>soybeans</b> was superior to that of animals fed GM <b>soybeans,</b> while animals fed conventional <b>soybeans</b> was intermediate. There were large fitness differences for D. magna fed raw <b>soybeans,</b> but smaller with heat-treated soy.

5|$|Monsanto {{developed}} patents for {{genetically modified}} <b>soybeans</b> that were resistant to glyphosate-based herbicides. When farmers sprayed the modified <b>soybeans</b> with the glyphosate herbicide Roundup, the modified <b>soybeans</b> would survive while competing plants (weeds) would be killed. Monsanto sold these <b>soybeans</b> under a limited-use license that prohibited the farmer-buyer {{from using the}} seeds {{for more than a}} single season or from saving any seed produced from the crop for replanting.|$|R
5|$|Julian also {{extracted}} stigmasterol, {{which took}} {{its name from}} Physostigma venenosum, the west African calabar bean that he hoped could serve as raw material for synthesis of human steroidal hormones. At about this time, in 1934, Butenandt and Fernholz, in Germany, had shown that stigmasterol, isolated from <b>soybean</b> oil, could be converted to progesterone by synthetic organic chemistry.|$|E

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine the effects of extruding sorghum and <b>soybeans</b> for weanling pigs. The first experiment involved 66 piglets with an average age of 19 d and average weight of 10. 8 lb. Two diets were fed in meal form. Treatment 1 was ground sorghum mixed with extruded <b>soybeans,</b> and Treatment 2 was prepared by extruding the mixture of ground sorghum and extruded <b>soybeans.</b> Extrusion of the sorghum-soybeans mixture increased average daily gain (ADG) and improved feed/gain (F/G) for d 0 to 14 and overall (d o to 28) compared to the ground sorghum treatment. In Exp. 2, 48 piglets averaging 23 d of age and average weight 13. 0 lb were used to determine the potential for increased pig performance by double extrusion of <b>soybeans.</b> Diets were similar to those used in Exp. 1, with treatments of 1) ground sorghum- extruded <b>soybeans,</b> 2) extruded mixture of ground sorghum and extruded <b>soybeans,</b> and 3) ground sorghum with double-extruded <b>soybeans.</b> The extruded sorghum-soybeans mixture and double-extruded <b>soybeans</b> did not affect ADG from d 0 to 14, although there was a numerical improvement in F/G compared to the ground sorghum-extruded <b>soybeans</b> treatment.
