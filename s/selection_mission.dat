40|$|The Comet Rendezvous and Asteroid Flyby Mission (CRAF) will include, {{as one of}} its {{complement}} of thirteen scientific instruments, a plasma electron analyzer capable of providing 3 -dimensional measurements of the energy and angular distribution of electrons in the solar wind, asteroidal and cometary environments. After initial instrument <b>selection,</b> <b>mission</b> planners at JPL suggested that an instrument capable of performing angular scanning electronically rather than mechanically be investigated. This thesis describes the development of the redesigned CRAF plasma electron detector, consisting of an electronic scanning component, called the "elevation analyzer", and an energy analyzing component based on the Soft Particle Spectrometer (SPS). The numerical simulation of each component's operation [...] consisting of ray-tracing particles through the electrostatic field of each analyzer and collecting statistics on those particles successfully transmitted [...] is used to determine the energy and angular response functions of each component and the design dimensions that optimize these responses...|$|E

40|$|The mission {{planning}} of Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) on-orbit refuelling with uncertain object satellites is studied in this paper. Three key problems should be resolved here: Object Satellite (OSc) <b>selection,</b> <b>mission</b> sequence planning and transfer trajectory optimization. The optimization {{goal is to}} select the OSc and find the optimal servicing sequence with the best optimization objective value. Three optimization objectives, i. e. fuel cost, {{the total number of}} the OScs and the sum of the OSc priority value are taken into account. Considering this mission as a hybrid optimal control problem, a mathematical model is proposed. Multi-objective particle swarm optimization is employed to address the model. Several mission scenarios are compared and discussed. Numerical experiments indicate that 1) the method developed in this paper could address the problem efficiently; and 2) OSc distribution and varieties in optimization objective emphasis have considerable influences on the optimization results...|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} {{outlines the}} design completed {{by members of}} Lone Star Aerospace, Inc. (L. S. A.) of a lunar observatory {{on the far side}} of the Moon. Such a base would not only establish a long term human presence on the Moon, but would also allow more accurate astronomical data to be obtained. A lunar observatory is more desirable than an Earth based observatory for the following reasons: instrument weight is reduced due to the Moon's weaker gravity; near vacuum conditions exist on the Moon; the Moon has slow rotation to reveal the entire sky; and the lunar surface is stable for long baseline instruments. All the conditions listed above are favorable for astronomical data recording. The technical aspects investigated in the completion of this project included site <b>selection,</b> <b>mission</b> scenario, scientific instruments, communication and power systems, habitation and transportation, cargo spacecraft design, thermal systems, robotic systems, and trajectory analysis. The site selection group focused its efforts on finding a suitable location for the observatory. Hertzsprung, a large equatorial crater on the eastern limb, was chosen as the base site...|$|E
40|$|The Space Studies Board of the National Research Council charged its Committee on Planetary and Lunar Exploration (COMPLEX) to (1) {{examine the}} degree to which small missions, such as those fitting within the {{constraints}} of the Discovery program, can achieve priority objectives in the lunar and planetary sciences; (2) determine those characteristics, such as level of risk, flight rate, target mix, university involvement, technology development, management structure and procedures, and so on, that could allow a successful program; (3) assess issues, such as instrument <b>selection,</b> <b>mission</b> operations, data analysis, and data archiving, to ensure the greatest scientific return from a particular mission, given a rapid deployment schedule and a tightly constrained budget; and (4) review past programmatic attempts to establish small planetary science mission lines, including the Planetary Observers and Planetary Explorers, and consider the impact management practices have had on such programs. A series of small missions presents the planetary science community with the opportunity to expand the scope of its activities and to develop the potential and inventiveness of its members in ways not possible within the confines of large, traditional programs. COMPLEX also realized that a program of small planetary missions was, in and of itself, incapable of meeting all of the prime objectives contained in its report 'An Integrated Strategy for the Planetary Sciences: 1995 - 2010.

40|$|The Marsokhod 1999 field {{experiment}} in the Mojave Desert included a simulation of a rover-based sample <b>selection</b> <b>mission.</b> As part of this mission, a test was made of strategies and analytical techniques for identifying past or present life in environments expected to be present on Mars. A combination of visual clues from high-resolution images and the detection of an important biomolecule (chlorophyll) with visible/near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy led to the successful identification of a rock with evidence of cryptoendolithic organisms. The sample was identified in high-resolution images (3 times {{the resolution of the}} Imager for Mars Pathfinder camera) {{on the basis of a}} green tinge and textural information suggesting the presence of a thin, partially missing exfoliating layer revealing the organisms. The presence of chlorophyll bands in similar samples was observed in visible/NIR spectra of samples in the field and later confirmed in the laboratory using the same spectrometer. Raman spectroscopy in the laboratory, simulating a remote measurement technique, also detected evidence of carotenoids in samples from the same area. Laboratory analysis confirmed that the subsurface layer of the rock is inhabited by a community of coccoid Chroococcidioposis cyanobacteria. The identification of minerals in the field, including carbonates and serpentine, that are associated with aqueous processes was also demonstrated using the visible/NIR spectrometer. Other lessons learned that are applicable to future rover missions include the benefits of web-based programs for target selection and for daily mission planning and the need for involvement of the science team in optimizing image compression schemes based on the retention of visual signature characteristics...|$|E

40|$|Venus and Mars likely had {{liquid water}} bodies on their surface {{early in the}} Solar System his-tory. The {{surfaces}} of Venus and Mars are presently not a suitable habitat for life, but reser-voirs of liquid water remain in the atmosphere of Venus and the subsurface of Mars, and with it also the possibility of microbial life. Microbial organisms may have adapted to live in these ecological niches by the evolutionary force of directional <b>selection.</b> <b>Missions</b> to our neighboring planets should therefore be planned to explore these potentially life-containing refuges and return samples for analysis. Sample return missions should also include ice sam-ples from Mercury and the Moon, which may contain information about the biogenic mate-rial that catalyzed the early evolution of life on Earth (or elsewhere). To obtain such infor-mation, science-driven exploration is necessary through varying degrees of mission operation autonomy. A hierarchical mission design is envisioned that includes spaceborne (orbital), at-mosphere (airborne), surface (mobile such as rover and stationary such as lander or sensor), and subsurface (e. g., ground-penetrating radar, drilling, etc.) agents working in concert to al-low for sufficient mission safety and redundancy, to perform extensive and challenging re-connaissance, and {{to lead to a}} thorough search for evidence of life and habitability.
