5|$|On February 21, 2013, <b>Six</b> <b>Flags</b> Great America {{announced}} that their Batman: The Ride roller coaster would run backwards {{for a limited}} time during the 2013 season. <b>Six</b> <b>Flags</b> Magic Mountain and <b>Six</b> <b>Flags</b> Over Texas did the same during the 2014 season. <b>Six</b> <b>Flags</b> Over Georgia and <b>Six</b> <b>Flags</b> Great Adventure followed suit running theirs backwards for a limited time in 2015.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, <b>Six</b> <b>Flags</b> {{announced}} three The Dark Knight Coaster {{roller coasters}} {{would be built}} at <b>Six</b> <b>Flags</b> Great Adventure, <b>Six</b> <b>Flags</b> Great America, and <b>Six</b> <b>Flags</b> New England. Because Batman: The Dark Knight's name was so similar to the new roller coaster, it was renamed to Batman: The Ride. However, as construction on the new roller coaster progressed, the city of Agawam forced <b>Six</b> <b>Flags</b> to stop construction after it was discovered the park had not received the appropriate construction permits. In April 2008, <b>Six</b> <b>Flags</b> cancelled the project due to the delays and Batman: The Ride was renamed back to its original.|$|E

5|$|Chang {{was removed}} {{over the weekend}} of September 19, 2009 to expand Splashwater Kingdom, but the {{expansion}} was soon rejected, while <b>Six</b> <b>Flags</b> later announced plans to dispose of its Kentucky Kingdom property. The removal of Chang and the closure of <b>Six</b> <b>Flags</b> Kentucky Kingdom caused {{the owners of the}} park land (the Kentucky State Fair Board) to sue <b>Six</b> <b>Flags</b> for ownership of the rides. Kentucky Kingdom is now open under new operators as of May 24, 2014.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, <b>Six</b> <b>Flags</b> Great Adventure spent $42 {{million on}} new attractions {{including}} a prototype Floorless Coaster by Bolliger & Mabillard, Medusa (later Bizarro). The immediate {{popularity of the}} ride, led to <b>Six</b> <b>Flags</b> Fiesta Texas and three other amusement parks to announce plans to install Floorless Coasters in 2000; aside from the announcement of Superman: Krypton Coaster on November 1, 1999, <b>Six</b> <b>Flags</b> Discovery Kingdom announced Medusa, Geauga Lake announced , and SeaWorld Orlando announced Kraken.

50|$|Scientists {{believe the}} <b>six</b> American <b>flags</b> planted by astronauts have been {{bleached}} white because {{of more than}} 40 years of exposure to solar radiation.

50|$|The ride {{is one of}} many attractions {{since the}} 80’s to diversify in more than just a fairy-tale park. House {{designer}} van de Ven took Intamin’s design, as implemented in <b>Six</b> <b>Flag’s</b> Roaring Rapids (Texas, amongst others) and expanded it into a pre-Columbian thematic ride. Original planned for 1982, the extensive architecture delayed the opening to 1983. As with earlier attractions, the entire landscape and service outlets in the area were remodeled to fit the unique design.|$|R

5|$|One of {{the last}} {{installations}} of the ride was at <b>Six</b> <b>Flags</b> New Orleans in 2003, having been relocated from the Japanese park Thrill Valley where it operated as Gambit from 1995 to 2002. In 2005 the effects of Hurricane Katrina caused <b>Six</b> <b>Flags</b> to abandon its New Orleans park, and after standing unused for two years, the ride there was relocated to <b>Six</b> <b>Flags</b> Fiesta Texas, where it was refurbished and repainted. The ride reopened as Goliath on April 18, 2008.|$|E
5|$|Superman: Ultimate Flight is a steel flying {{roller coaster}} {{designed}} by Bolliger & Mabillard. Themed {{to the popular}} comic book character, Superman: Ultimate Flight has been installed at three <b>Six</b> <b>Flags</b> theme parks around the United States: <b>Six</b> <b>Flags</b> Over Georgia, <b>Six</b> <b>Flags</b> Great Adventure and <b>Six</b> <b>Flags</b> Great America. The first of these was at <b>Six</b> <b>Flags</b> Over Georgia, which interacts with the terrain {{much more than the}} other two. Superman: Ultimate Flight simulates flying by positioning its passengers parallel to the track, supported by harnesses and facing the ground through most of the ride. In the station, riders board the train sitting down. After the train is locked and checked, the trains are raised into the flying position. After the ride, the seats are lowered back into the sitting position for the next round of riders.|$|E

5|$|Walter Bolliger and Claude Mabillard {{started working}} for Giovanola, a {{manufacturing}} company who supplied rides to Intamin, in the 1970s. During their time at Giovanola, they helped design the company's first stand-up roller coaster, Shockwave at <b>Six</b> <b>Flags</b> Magic Mountain. They also worked on other projects, such as Z-Force at <b>Six</b> <b>Flags</b> Great America. Bolliger & Mabillard left Giovanola, {{but the company}} continued to use their track design, so the company's roller coasters, Goliath at <b>Six</b> <b>Flags</b> Magic Mountain and Titan at <b>Six</b> <b>Flags</b> Over Texas, use a track style very similar to B's.|$|E

50|$|In {{preparation}} for the annual Halloween Fright Night celebrations on October 31, 2011, Log Jammer was closed down and was subsequently removed following the yearly Halloween themed events.
