40|$|Global food production, supply chains, {{and food}} quality are coming under {{increasing}} scrutiny by consumers, environmentalists and governments. Particularly in developed countries, {{there is growing}} awareness among consumers about food origins and environmental practices. There are increasing concerns over animal welfare and protection and due to food scares in the late 1990 ’s, and more recently contamination issues from additives within supply chains and food borne illness outbreaks in Europe. It {{is no surprise then}} that food safety and traceability matters have become an issue of public and governmental concern. There is much debate currently about globalisation of the international trade of food commodities. There is also a growing awareness about and changing attitudes towards the provenance of consumers’ food sources. This dichotomy provides the background argument to this thesis. Europe has long been considered the home of finely crafted cheeses and this thesis aims to examine how the use of Geographical Indications (GI’s) by the European Union (EU) can influence New Zealand made <b>speciality</b> <b>cheeses.</b> The EU system of GI’s and the protection of specialised food and agricultural products has enabled companies to build strong reputations in the global marketplace and also within the internal market in order to charge premium prices for these protected products. The vast majority of the world’s GI foods are located in Europe. This thesis aims to argue that while there is not an official system for the control of labels of origin for the names of <b>speciality</b> <b>cheeses</b> in New Zealand, they are used nonetheless. These labels of location are used to denote certain qualities, production methods or guarantee and differ from standardised, commoditised cheeses. This thesis discusses the use of GI’s in the cheese industry as a way for New Zealand cheese producers to create product differentiation and as a means of communicating product quality through provenance branding. This thesis uses qualitative research methods to gauge industry opinion regarding the nature of the <b>speciality</b> <b>cheese</b> industry in New Zealand in order to better understand the reasons for naming <b>speciality</b> <b>cheese</b> products and how European cheeses have influenced them. Findings indicate that naming and influences for these products are varied and complex, but have been ultimately influenced by European cheeses. For New Zealand cheese companies GI’s are used as a means to differentiate products from competitors...|$|R

5000|$|Milbenkäse ("mite cheese"), called Mellnkase in {{the local}} dialect and often known (erroneously) as Spinnenkäse ("spider cheese"), is a German <b>speciality</b> <b>cheese.</b> It is made by {{flavouring}} balls of quark (a type of soft cheese) with caraway and salt, allowing them to dry, and then leaving them in a wooden box containing rye flour and cheese mites for about three months. An enzyme in the digestive juices excreted by the mites causes the cheese to ripen.|$|R

40|$|New Generation Cooperatives (NGCs) are farmerowned {{cooperative}} organizations generally {{characterized by}} an involvement in value-added processing activities and a linkage of producer capital contributions to product delivery rights. Although the earliest NGCs were established in the North Central United States, particularly in North Dakota and Minnesota, interest in this organizational form has spread to {{other regions of the}} country because of the perceived success of many of these cooperatives. Recently, NGCs have been involved in traditional value-added activities such as corn sweetener production, sugar beet processing, pasta production and hog operations, as well as activities related to emerging niche markets such as bison processing, tilapia production, organic milling and <b>speciality</b> <b>cheese</b> processing.

40|$|The Nordic foodscape {{has changed}} radically {{over the last}} decade. In Scandinavia there is massive focus on a Nordic gourmet food {{evolution}} in general and in Denmark specifically also a cheese revolution. Notions of terroir and place specific foodstuffs are rapidly gaining interest in the Nordic countries. In the fall of 2008 Thise Mejeri won an annual Danish gourmet dairy prize with their <b>speciality</b> <b>cheese</b> ‘Vesterhavsost’. The judges noted that: “The cheese has character, {{and it has the}} “terroir” that we search for. It means that it is characterized by the origin of the milk, as well as the area of production and maturing. It has a good story”. The Vesterhavsost (Eng. ‘The Northern Sea cheese’) was thus inscribed in an (it seems) ever-growing trend towards food related site-specificity. ...|$|R
40|$|The UK milk {{industry}} {{has been in a}} state of rapid evolution following the dissolution in 1994 of the milk marketing boards. The paper examines dairy processing companies, milk collection co-operatives and milk groups in the south west of England to assemble reasons for success and failures and compare them with north west France, with similar traditional dairying. The findings suggest the following opportunities as the best development potential for the dairy industry in south west England: mature cheddar, <b>speciality</b> <b>cheeses,</b> suitable territorial cheese varieties and other fresh cheeses; dairy desserts; and yoghurts, fromage frais and crème fraiche. A second tier of opportunities could take place through new on-farm processing; expansion of the product range of existing companies; expansion of the Davidstow Creamery as a producer of mature cheddar; and new “green field” site developments by new entrants...|$|R
40|$|Many {{rural areas}} in {{developed}} market economies are now responding to globalization {{by trying to}} encourage a relocalization of production and consumption through the establishment of niche markets based on locally embedded skills, resources and knowledges. Such strategies can be theorized as features of a territorially based culture economy. By introducing notions of vertical and horizontal networks into this broad idea, the aim in {{this paper is to}} interrogate {{the nature and extent of}} the culture economy as a force for rural development in West Wales. The discussion draws on empirical material from research into four different product sectors: speciality beef and lamb, organic fruit, vegetables and meat, <b>speciality</b> <b>cheese</b> and artisanal crafts. Overall, the intention is to demonstrate the importance of considering the specific socio-cultural and economic contexts within which networks of development are constructed and to suggest that multiple cultural economies operate within and across different localities and sectors...|$|R
50|$|After the Dissolution of the Monasteries, {{the land}} was {{purchased}} by the Mainwaring family of Over Peover and remained part of that family's estate until the 20th century. From the 17th century, farming techniques improved and farms became bigger and more prosperous. Dairy farming and particularly the Cheshire <b>speciality,</b> <b>cheese,</b> thrived, shielding the county from poor harvests and low prices. Goostrey became a centre for a comparatively well-to-do farming community. The church, St Luke's, a wooden framed building built around 1220 {{was replaced by the}} present one of brick in 1792. The first recorded school early in the 17th century was rebuilt in 1775, a replacement built on another site in 1812 and that replaced by the present 'old' school in 1856 when some 62 boys and 40 girls were pupils. Also at that time, the village had at least two pubs, a mill, a blacksmith, two tailors, a shoemaker and two or three shops.|$|R
5000|$|San Miguel Corporation {{entered a}} bidding war for National Foods with New Zealand's Fonterra in 2004. National Foods board {{unanimously}} accepted the San Miguel Corporation offer. In 2005 San Miguel acquired National Foods for $1.8 billion. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission had earlier signed off on San Miguel Corporation's various Australian acquisitions, noting [...] "there is no overlap between San Miguel's different activities in Australia and hence no change likely to the different markets in which these businesses operate." [...] National Foods had earlier sold its juice business to Berri Ltd. After their acquisition National Foods regained 100% ownership of Berri Ltd. in December 2005. The two operations began the merger process soon afterwards. Following the merger, National Foods became the largest citrus and fruit processor in Australia, packaging approximately 50% of all fruit juice beverages sold in Australia. This led to National Foods having 3500 employees and 20 processing plants around Australia and New Zealand, with seven milk plants, five juice plants, four <b>speciality</b> <b>cheese</b> plants, a cheese packaging plant, two dairy foods plants and a joint venture soy beverage plant.|$|R

5000|$|It is {{the most}} {{prolific}} British breed. Mature ewes achieve an average litter size of more than 3.00 and this advantage carries through to lambs weaned per ewe. Before the breed settled to the desired level of prolificacy, some remarkable records were achieved {{in the early stages}} of the project, with sextuplets being not uncommon and one ewe achieving a lifetime record of 44 lambs in 10 crops. Comparative trials carried out by the Scottish Agricultural College in the 1990s showed that halfbred ewes sired by the British Milksheep achieved a level of productivity 11% higher than halfbreds sired by Bluefaced Leicester and Border Leicester rams, and 26% higher than those sired by Bleu du Maine and Rouge de l’Ouest rams. Average milk yield depends on the standard of management of the flock and can vary from 250 to more than 400 litres in a 210-day lactation, with 6% fat and 6% protein. Some pure flocks continue to be used for dairying and produce milk for consumers with allergy to cows’ milk, ice-cream, and <b>speciality</b> <b>cheeses</b> in northern England and Canada. There are claims that ewes produce 650 L to 900 L of milk in a 300-day lactation with a 5.5 to 9.5% fat content [...] but those claims have not been verified. In comparative trials for milk yield in Hungary, using the local Merino population with a milk yield of 30-50 litres per lactation, British Milksheep crosses proved superior to crosses by Lacaune and Awassi rams. They yielded 90-130 litres compared with 60-80 litres from Lacaune crosses and 80-105 litres from Awassi crosses. The British Milksheep is a white-faced, clean-headed, polled sheep. Ewes produce 4 kg and rams 6.5 kg fleece with a spinning count of 50 to 54s. The staple length is 12 to 18 cm. They have good carcase characteristics. In comparative trials in Hungary for meat production, crossbred lambs sired by British Milksheep had a superior carcase grading, a higher killing-out percentage than crosses sired by Ile de France, Suffolk and Mutton Merino rams, and the meat was the most tender as measured by shear force. British Milksheep are large, robust sheep with a good conformation. At maturity, rams weigh 103 kg and ewes 79 kg on average.|$|R
500|$|Treblinka {{received}} transports {{of almost}} 20,000 foreign Jews between October 1942 and March 1943, including 8,000 from the German Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia via Theresienstadt, and over 11,000 from Bulgarian-occupied Thrace, Macedonia, and Pirot following {{an agreement with}} the Nazi-allied Bulgarian government. They had train tickets and arrived predominantly in passenger carriages with considerable luggage, travel foods and drinks, all of which were taken by the SS to the food storage barracks. The provisions included such items as smoked mutton, <b>speciality</b> breads, wine, <b>cheese,</b> fruit, tea, coffee, and sweets. Unlike Polish Jews arriving in Holocaust trains from nearby ghettos in cities like Warsaw, Radom, and those of Bezirk Bialystok, the foreign Jews received a warm welcome upon arrival from an SS man (either Otto Stadie or Willy Mätzig), after which they were killed like the others. Treblinka dealt mainly with Polish Jews, Bełżec handled the Jews from Austria and the Sudetenland, and Sobibór was the final destination for Jews from France and the Netherlands. Auschwitz-Birkenau [...] "processed" [...] Jews from almost every other country in Europe. The frequency of arriving transports slowed down in winter.|$|R
