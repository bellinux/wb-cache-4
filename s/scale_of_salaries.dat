40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) [...] Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education, 2001 The {{aim of this}} {{research}} project is three-barrelled: • to ascertain the nature of job satisfaction; • to ascertain which factors, according to literature, lead to the job satisfaction of the female head of department at a secondary school; • to ascertain which factors {{in the practice of}} education lead to the job satisfaction of the female head of department at a secondary school. To achieve these goals a literary study as well as an empirical research was undertaken. The literary study was done from primary and secondary sources. A DIALOG computer search was done with the following words: females, sex fairness, leaders, women administrators, career leaders, promotion, motivation, work satisfaction, female teachers, secondary school. Consequently the nature of job satisfaction was discussed. After having identified the management factors that have an influence on the female head of department job satisfaction, these factors were grouped and discussed under the following sub-divisions: • Factors that are situated in the head of department herself • Interpersonal relations • Factors concerning the job situation • Career development • Factors on managerial level that have an influence on job satisfaction Based on these factors a questionnaire was compiled from existing questionnaires (those of Hillebrand, 1989; Esterhuizen, 1989; Du Toit, 1994; Engelbrecht, 1996; Kirsten, 2000 and the Minnesota Importance Questionnaire, 1985). A systemized sample was used by which female heads of department of secondary schools in the North West Province were involved. The questionnaires were sent to the study population. The information thus gathered was statistically processed and interpreted. On account of these data, recommendations were made. The empirical research showed that female heads of department of secondary schools experience to a certain extent job satisfaction, but also that certain factors need attention. Based on the empirical study, recommendations were made. The most important one being the need to look incisively into adaptable <b>scales</b> <b>of</b> <b>salary</b> according to qualifications, as well as compensation that compares well with comparable jobs. It is important that the programme of rationalisation should be completed as soon as possible so that the matter of job security can be looked into seriously. The education authorities need to look into effective and fair evaluation for promotion, as well as into the physical work conditions of the female head of departmentMaster...|$|R

40|$|The docament {{offers two}} {{definitions}} of accountability, a narrow {{one in which}} the teacher's salary must be based eatirely upon a measurement of his teaching competence, and a broader one in which salary is related only partly to a measurement of competence. The major points for and against merit ratings are summarized, followed by a description of the requirements for a successful plan, inclading the prerequisite conditions of acceptance, mutual confidence, participation, and research; a validated and continuous evaluation system; and a basic <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>salaries</b> which adequately reflects the importance of teaching. The wider acceptance of merit rating plans in the United States than in Canada is considered, as well as the probable cost of such a program, which has been estimated at an additional 18 percent of payroll. The philosophical prot'em raised by merit rating is due to the conflicting views of the school system as a bureaucracy or as a profession. If the teacher is to be rated by someone else, he cannot retain his professional autonomy.

40|$|Newport (Essex) Grammar School {{was founded}} in 1588 by Mrs. Joyce Frankland, a wealthy patroness of learning, who endowed the school with tithes at Banstead and {{property}} in London and. Hoddesdon. The history of the school shows the changes in its function within the local community and in the developments {{which took place in}} the curriculum, organisation and social composition of the school as a result of policies laid down by the Trustees, Charity Commissioners, Governors, and by legislation both local and national. As an important support of civil and ecclesiastical policy the school flourished, providing a narrow, ' linguistic curriculum for local boys, the sons of clerics and of the gentry of Essex and neighbouring counties, many of whom proceeded to Cambridge. With the growth of industry and commerce during the 18 th century, new forms of secondary education came into being and private academies offered a vocational or commercial curriculum. As a result, grammar schools declined. At Newport however, in 1779 a successful boarding side was developed by James Buck, with many able boys proceeding to Cambridge. With his departure, boarding was discontinued and the trustees authorised an elementary curriculum. In 1828 the Charity commissioners encouraged a revival in boarding in order to establish a classics side and a new building was authorised. A small Latin class was developed while, with the coming of the railway and the growth of business in neighbouring towns, "merchants' accounts was introduced-into the curriculum. Three masters followed in quick succession an 4, while the Schools Inquiry CoJrtmission deliberated on its future, the school was placed under the charge of the usher with the result. that numbers declined sharply. The new scheme of 187 4 envisaged a Second Grade School at Newport and under Mr Waterhouse a new building was opened to provide a practical education for boys up to fifteen. Boarding was again successfully introduced and, with the provision of a swimming bath, gymnasium, and several acres of playing fields, sport was fostered laboratory was added in 1896 and a strong science side developed, while the increasing number of boys entering the universities and professions indicated that the school had grown beyond its second grade status. Thus when, in 1910, financial difficulties forced the Governors to apply for secondary status under the 1902 Act, this was readily granted. During his: period of office, Dr. Wyeth faced the problem of rising numbers and overcrowding and also. engaged in a struggle to lengthen school life and develop advanced work; these problems were aggravated by war. and the. subsequent economic depression. After 1916 the school experienced a rapid expansion that was so marked a feature of secondary education during and after the war. In 1937, two further laboratories and classrooms were built. Advanced work developed slowly and it was in. the 1920 's, with the reorganisation of school leaving examinations and the incentive of financial inducements by the Board, that a. small sixth form was established. Since reorganisation in 1910, the school had been supported by direct grant and also aided by the local authority. In 1922 the Board's grant regulations were changed and as the introduction of the Burnham <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>salaries</b> had increased the deficit and the Essex Education Committee's contribution now exceeded all other sources of income, the school was classified as a deficiency grant school. From then on, the school' s financial dependence on the L. E. A. increased. To accord with the L. E. A's policy in its own secondary schools, all places were made special places from September 1935, when all boys had to pass the General Admission Examination, and the school lost control over its admissions. After some 'initial friction the school governors and the L. E. A. worked closely together {{until the end of the}} arrangements in 1947...|$|E

40|$|This study {{explores the}} role <b>of</b> <b>salary</b> raises and the {{perception}} of employees <b>of</b> these <b>salary</b> raises on employees' intended retention and turnover. By using a unique survey data set from an American university, this study investigates a novel hypothesis that faculty perceptions <b>of</b> <b>salary</b> raises, relative to their perceptions of other faculty members' assessments of the raises, influences their labor supply. Using both Ordered Probit and OLS modelling frameworks, we focus on the impact <b>of</b> <b>salary</b> raises and the relative perception of these raises on intended labor supply behavior. We explore a hypothesis that a mismatch between one's ranking <b>of</b> the <b>salary</b> raise {{and the perception}} of others' rankings causes dissatisfaction. Our results provide evidence that salary raises themselves are effective monetary tools to reduce turnover; however, our results also suggest that relative deprivation as a comparison of one's own perceptions <b>of</b> a <b>salary</b> raise with others affects employee retention. We find that employees who have less favorable perceptions <b>of</b> <b>salary</b> adjustments, compared to what they believe their colleagues think, are more likely to seek another employer, holding their own perception of raises constant. Conversely, more favorable views <b>of</b> <b>salary</b> raises, compared to how faculty members think other's perceived the salary raises, does not have a statistically significant impact on retention. Our results indicate that monetary rewards in the form <b>of</b> <b>salary</b> raises do impact employee retention; however, perception of fairness <b>of</b> these <b>salary</b> raises is also as important as the actual raises. Given the high cost of job turnover, these findings suggest that employers would benefit from devoting resources toward ensuring that salary- and raise-determining procedures are generally perceived by the vast majority of employees as being fair. This is the first study that explores the employee satisfaction with salary raises relative to perceptions of other employees' satisfaction with salary raises, and intended labor supply in an American university...|$|R
