40|$|We {{propose a}} relaxed version of linearizability and a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>load</b> {{balancing}} algorithms for trading off adherence to concurrent data structure semantics and scalability. We consider data structures that store {{elements in a}} given order such as stacks and queues. Intuitively, a concurrent stack, for example, is linearizable if the effect of push and pop operations on the stack always occurs instantaneously. A linearizable stack guarantees that pop operations return the youngest stack elements first, i. e., the elements in the reverse order in which the operations that pushed them onto the stack took effect. Linearizability allows to reorder concurrent (but not sequential) operations arbitrarily. We relax linearizability to k-linearizability with k> 0 to also allow sequences of up to k− 1 sequential operations to be reordered arbitrarily and thus execute concurrently. With a k-linearizable stack, for example, a pop operation may not return the youngest but the k-th youngest element on the stack. It turns out that k-linearizability may be tolerated by concurrent applications such as process schedulers and web servers that already use it implicitly. Moreover, k-linearizability does provide positive scalability in some cases because more operations may be executed concurrently but may still be too restrictive under high contention. We therefore propose a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>load</b> balancing algorithms, which significantly improve scalability by approximating k-linearizability probabilistically. We introduce Scal, an open-source framework for implementing k-linearizable approximations of concurrent data structures, and show in multiple benchmarks that Scal provides positive scalability for concurrent data structures that typically do not scale under high contention...|$|E
