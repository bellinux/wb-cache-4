25|$|Astoria lost <b>{{steering}}</b> <b>control</b> on {{the bridge}} at about 0225, shifted control to central station, and began steering a zig-zag course south. Before she made much progress, though, the heavy cruiser lost all power. Fortunately, the Japanese chose that exact instant to withdraw. By 0300, nearly 400 men, including about 70 wounded and many dead, were assembled on the forecastle deck.|$|E
25|$|On August 12, 1996, Mayne Queen {{departed}} Swartz Bay {{terminal and}} ran aground off Piers Island after losing <b>steering</b> <b>control.</b> The grounding occurred while performing a regular weekly {{test of the}} batteries for the <b>steering</b> <b>control</b> system. A crew member overheard {{there was going to}} be a test, and in an attempt to be helpful and without direction, cut all power from the vessel's steering batteries, as he had done at night when the ship was stored, not realizing that the test in question only required the removal of a battery charger and that his assistance was neither requested nor required. No one was injured in the incident, and the vessel was assisted off the rocks at high tide, but it suffered extensive damage to its propulsion system, having two of the four steering and propulsion pods for the right-angle drives sheared off and one of the two remaining pods suffering propeller damage.|$|E
25|$|ESC {{intervenes}} {{only when}} it detects a probable loss of <b>steering</b> <b>control,</b> i.e. when the vehicle is not going where the driver is steering. This may happen, for example, when skidding during emergency evasive swerves, understeer or oversteer during poorly judged turns on slippery roads, or hydroplaning. ESC may also intervene in an unwanted way during high-performance driving, because steering input {{may not always be}} directly indicative of the intended direction of travel (i.e. controlled drifting). ESC estimates the direction of the skid, and then applies the brakes to individual wheels asymmetrically in order to create torque about the vehicle's vertical axis, opposing the skid and bringing the vehicle back in line with the driver's commanded direction. Additionally, the system may reduce engine power or operate the transmission to slow the vehicle down.|$|E
50|$|A {{universal}} <b>steering</b> wheel <b>control</b> interface {{can be used}} on {{most any}} vehicle with <b>steering</b> wheel <b>controls,</b> to be used with today's top aftermarket radio manufactures like Pioneer, Sony, Alpine, Kenwood, Eclipse, JVC, Valor, Boyo (Vision Tech), Dual, Visteon, Advent and Blaupunkt. It is used to retain the OEM <b>steering</b> wheel <b>controls.</b> It has the ability to auto-detect many vehicle makes and aftermarket radios and it will preset the <b>steering</b> wheel <b>controls</b> to the aftermarket radio automatically so no programming is required. If desired it can be manually programmed so the user can make the <b>steering</b> wheel <b>controls</b> function the way they want them to, only limited by the functions of the aftermarket radio.|$|R

25|$|The river rose in mid-April, and by April 19, 1870, judging {{that the}} river was high {{enough to make the}} run, Captain Miller ordered lines cast off. His plan was to drift down with the current, then run the engines in reverse to gain <b>steering</b> <b>control</b> in the rapids. Going over Copper Ledge Falls, just a few hundred yards downstream, the boat first spun around three times in a {{powerful}} eddy just above the drop. Then the bow went over and the whole boat tilted sharply downwards until the sternwheel was spinning around free in the air. Once the boat hit the bottom of the drop, the sternwheel started to break up, throwing the boat out of control and into some rocks which crushed part of her bow. The boat was twisting and wracking and then a boiler valve broke, filling the engine room with steam. Captain Miller put ashore after this, and the crew repaired the vessel. Fortunately the smashed portion of the bow turned out to be above the waterline, and by 9:00a.m. the next day they were ready to proceed.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{prototype}} were three Model A45T aircraft, {{the first two}} with the same engine as {{the prototype}} and the third with a Continental E-225, which {{would prove to be}} close to the production version. Production did not begin until 1953, when Beechcraft began delivering T-34As to the United States Air Force (USAF) and similar Model B45 aircraft for export. Production of the T-34B for the United States Navy (USN) began in 1955, this version featuring a number of changes reflecting the different requirements of the two services. The T-34B had only differential braking for <b>steering</b> <b>control</b> on the ground instead of nosewheel steering, additional wing dihedral and, to cater for the different heights of pilots, adjustable rudder pedals instead of the moveable seats of the T-34A. T-34A production was completed in 1956, with T-34Bs being built until October 1957 and licensed B45 versions built in Canada (125 manufactured by Canadian Car and Foundry), Japan (173 built by Fuji Heavy Industries), and Argentina (75 by FMA) until 1958. Beechcraft delivered the last Model B45s in 1959. Total production of the Continental-engined versions in the US and abroad was 1,904 aircraft.|$|E
500|$|At 23:27, as Minneapolis fired her ninth salvo and Wright {{prepared}} {{to order a}} course change for his column, two torpedoes, from either Suzukaze or Takanami, slammed into her forward half. [...] One warhead exploded the aviation fuel storage tanks forward of turret one and the other knocked out three of the ship's four firerooms. [...] The bow forward of turret one folded down at a 70-degree angle and the ship lost power and <b>steering</b> <b>control.</b> [...] Thirty-seven men were killed.|$|E

50|$|As {{a unit of}} MSTS, {{she made}} supply runs to bases in {{northern}} Greenland and the Arctic until mid-October 1958. Lindenwald then departed the East Coast of Greenland {{on one of her}} supply runs. En route, she ran into an Arctic storm. During the storm she lost her <b>steering</b> <b>controls</b> and lay helpless for several hours. A distress signal was sent out and picked up by USNS Chattahoochee (T-AOG-82) which shortly arrived on the scene and towed Lindenwald to a safe anchorage. With her <b>steering</b> <b>controls</b> repaired, but with a noticeable list she sailed for New York City for further repairs, upon completion of which she was placed in MSTS Ready Reserve.|$|R

500|$|Although the two {{men were}} only {{slightly}} injured, the plane was damaged beyond repair. Mawson decided to salvage the plane by converting it into a motorised sledge. He fitted the skis, and removed the wings and most of the sheathing to save weight. In his official account of the expedition, The Home of the Blizzard, Mawson wrote that the advantages of this [...] "air-tractor sledge" [...] were expected to be [...] "speed, <b>steering</b> <b>control,</b> and comparative safety from crevasses owing to the great length of the runners". No longer needing a pilot, and believing him to be responsible for the crash, Mawson dismissed Watkins.|$|E
500|$|On 2 April, Tritons {{gyroscopic}} repeaters, used {{to maintain}} the ship's navigational bearing, began to experience sudden, severe oscillations, possibly caused by a malfunctioning synchro amplifier. [...] The helm was shifted to direct gyro input, the synchro amplifiers were checked out, and the gyroscopic repeaters appeared to return to normal function. [...] Later, while transiting the Pearl Bank Passage, a narrow channel lined with coral reefs, a periscope observation determined that Triton was off course, indicating a potentially hazardous helm error. [...] <b>Steering</b> <b>control</b> was immediately shifted to the control room, with the helm using the master gyroscopic repeater. While the malfunction was detected in time and the ship was not in any immediate danger, the loss of navigational bearing could have been catastrophic, with Captain Beach noting that [...] "the episode had a sobering effect." ...|$|E
500|$|Unable to fire {{her main}} or {{secondary}} batteries {{at the three}} destroyers causing her so much trouble, Hiei instead concentrated on SanFrancisco, which was passing by only [...] away. Along with Kirishima, Inazuma, and Ikazuchi, the four ships made repeated hits on SanFrancisco, disabling her <b>steering</b> <b>control</b> and killing Admiral Callaghan, Captain Cassin Young, {{and most of the}} bridge staff. The first few salvos from Hiei and Kirishima consisted of the special fragmentation bombardment shells, which reduced damage to the interior of SanFrancisco and may have saved her from being sunk outright. Not expecting a ship-to-ship confrontation, it took the crews of the two enemy battleships several minutes to switch to armor-piercing ammunition, and SanFrancisco, almost helpless to defend herself, managed to momentarily sail clear of the melee. She had landed at least one shell in Hieis steering gear room during the exchange, flooding it with water, shorting out her power steering generators, and severely inhibiting Hieis steering capability. Helena followed SanFrancisco to try to protect her from further harm.|$|E

500|$|Around 4:00, Indefatigable was hit {{around the}} rear turret {{by two or}} three shells from Von der Tann. She fell out of {{formation}} to starboard and started sinking towards the stern and listing to port. Her magazines exploded at 4:03 after more hits, one on the forecastle and another on the forward turret. Smoke and flames gushed from the forward part {{of the ship and}} large pieces were thrown [...] into the air. The most likely cause of her loss was a deflagration or low-order explosion in 'X' magazine that blew out her bottom and severed the <b>steering</b> <b>control</b> shafts, followed by the explosion of her forward magazines from the second volley. Von der Tann fired only fifty-two [...] shells at Indefatigable before she exploded. Of her crew of 1,019, only three survived. While still in the water, two survivors found Indefatigable's captain, C. F. Sowerby, who was badly wounded and died before they could be rescued. Two survivors, Able Seaman Frederick Arthur Gordon Elliott and Leading Signalman Charles Farmer, were rescued by the German torpedo boat [...] A third survivor, Signalman John Bowyer, was picked up by another unknown German ship. He was incorrectly reported as a crew member from HMS Nestor in [...] "The Times" [...] on 24 June 1916.|$|E

Both of her forward guns were knocked out and the forward superstructure was set afire. Hardy was forced to beach herself lest she sink, and the German ships switched their fire to , the next ship in line. Their fire was relatively ineffective and both sides fired torpedoes without scoring any hits. Havock pulled out and dropped to the rear to fight off any pursuit by the ships of the 4th Flotilla. This placed [...] in the lead and she was quickly set on fire by the German ships. Thiele probably also hit her with a torpedo and she was rammed from behind by [...] when the latter ship lost <b>steering</b> <b>control.</b> Hotspur was able to disengage, but Hunter capsized shortly afterward. The three remaining British ships were able to escape from the Germans under the cover of a smoke screen. Georg Thiele had been badly damaged by the British ships as she'd been hit seven times that knocked her forward gun and her fire-control equipment, flooded one magazine, started fires, and killed thirteen crewmen.|$|E
500|$|Bismarck was sunk {{three days}} later, after a {{concentrated}} effort by Britain's Royal Navy. At 23:30 (local time 19:30) on 24 May an attack {{was made by}} {{a small group of}} nine Swordfish biplane torpedo bombers of 825 Naval Air Squadron under the command of Eugene Esmonde from the aircraft carrier [...] One hit was scored, which killed Oberbootsmann Kurt Kirchberg, but caused only superficial damage to the Bismarcks armoured belt. In mid-morning at 10:30 on 26 May, a RAF Coastal Command Catalina reconnaissance aircraft from 209 Squadron RAF spotted Bismarck roughly [...] west of Saint-Nazaire. The British battle group Force H, under the command of Admiral James Somerville, whose main units were the aircraft carrier , the First World War era battlecruiser [...] and the cruiser , was ordered to stop Bismarck. At 19:15 that evening, 15 Swordfish from Ark Royal launched an attack. The air raid alarm was sounded on Bismarck at 20:30. Roughly 15 minutes into the attack Bismarck was possibly hit by one torpedo, and at around 21:00 another single torpedo jammed Bismarcks rudder 12° to port. Damage-control parties laboured to regain <b>steering</b> <b>control</b> and uncoupled and centred the starboard rudder, but failed to free the port rudder. With asymmetric power applied, speed reduced to , Bismarck was on a converging course with the Royal Navy units on the chase. The alarm sounded again at 23:00 when destroyers of the 4th Destroyer Flotilla under the command of Captain Philip Vian attacked Bismarck. Throughout the night Bismarck was targeted by incessant torpedo attacks by , , , , and , denying Lindemann and the crew much-needed rest.|$|E
