60|$|<b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> {{amongst the}} {{cushions}} {{and looked at}} him thoughtfully.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back,</b> {{her eyes}} fixed dreamily upon the blue distance.|$|E
60|$|Lady Deringham had {{recovered}} herself. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> amongst the cushions.|$|E
60|$|Wearied {{at length}} with cutting out, and measuring, and drawing threads, <b>she</b> <b>leans</b> <b>back</b> in her chair, and her eye {{rests on the}} pale face of her daughter, who has been sitting for two hours intent on her stitching.|$|R
60|$|Marion {{had turned}} towards {{him with a}} half-frightened look. <b>She</b> now <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> {{in her chair and}} covered her face with both hands.|$|R
60|$|She was hungry, tired, frightened, and the {{combination}} of sensations made her turn faint. With a white face and despair in her heart <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> heavily <b>back</b> and closed her eyes.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> in her seat. She {{was looking}} at him incredulously.|$|E
60|$|Then <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> {{among the}} {{cushions}} {{and laughed at}} her companion.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> and {{the prince}} took her place, {{holding out his}} hand.|$|E
6000|$|He {{walked away}} down the pergola without even waiting for her. It was very rude, but <b>she</b> only <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> {{in her chair and}} laughed. In a way, it was a triumph! ...|$|R
40|$|Photograph {{of a young}} Havasupai Indian women {{drinking}} from a water jug, or "Esua", or "Olla", ca. 1900. She wears a large brightly patterned cloth about her shoulders and a long plaid dress. She tilts the pear-shaped jug up as <b>she</b> <b>leans</b> <b>back</b> her head to drink. At {{her feet on the}} ground lays a conical basket, or "Kathak", a grinding stone (?), and two smaller baskets. Behind her grow wild grass, brush and small trees. Part of a canyon wall is visible in the background...|$|R
50|$|The two {{compositions}} are strikingly different. The Vienna {{painting is}} a fairly traditional composition. The angel Gabriel is on the right. He has just alighted on the ground, his robe still billowing from his flight, and he kneels as if in reverence or supplication. Mary stands on the left facing Gabriel, but <b>she</b> <b>leans</b> <b>back</b> slightly as if in surprise or alarm. The Antwerp painting is a more original composition. Mary kneels on the right; her body is turned away from Gabriel but her head is turned back toward him. Gabriel is still airborne; he reaches {{with his left hand}} toward Mary and points with his right hand toward heaven.|$|R
60|$|The light {{died out}} of Mrs. Vandemeyer's eyes. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> in her chair.|$|E
60|$|She shrugged her {{shoulders}} a little pettishly as <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> in the cab.|$|E
60|$|They started off. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> in {{her seat}} and pulled her veil down.|$|E
6000|$|... "O, dear! Christmas {{is coming}} in a fortnight, and I have got to think up {{presents}} for every body!" [...] said young Ellen Stuart, as <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> languidly <b>back</b> in her chair. [...] "Dear me, it's so tedious! Every body has got every thing that can be thought of." ...|$|R
6000|$|MISS REED: [...] "Wouldn't I? You {{wait and}} SEE, Miss Spaulding! He shall take the money, and he shall sign a receipt for it. I'll draw up the receipt now, {{so as to}} have it ready, and I shall ask him to sign it the very moment he enters this door--the very instant!" [...] She takes a {{portfolio}} from the table near her, without rising, and writes: [...] "'Received from Miss Ethel Reed one hundred and twenty-five dollars, in full, for twenty-five lessons in oil-painting.' There--when Mr. Oliver Ransom has signed this little document he may begin to talk; not before!" [...] <b>She</b> <b>leans</b> <b>back</b> in her chair {{with an air of}} pitiless determination.|$|R
50|$|Shoulder Support (Right): When the follow spins to her left, {{the lead}} may grip her left {{shoulder}} {{with his right}} arm. She will stop spinning when his right arm blocks her body. This leads to a natural dip, where <b>she</b> simply <b>leans</b> <b>back</b> while he supports her by holding her shoulder. Note: Never hold her neck.|$|R
60|$|He obeyed her, {{thoroughly}} amazed. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> {{amongst the}} cushions {{and looked at}} him thoughtfully.|$|E
60|$|Anna {{gave her}} {{address to the}} driver. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> in the cab with half-closed eyes.|$|E
60|$|Aynesworth {{found her}} rug {{and wrapped it}} around her. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> and closed her eyes.|$|E
5000|$|As {{the music}} {{transitions}} into a march, she disengages from the fence with an expansive circular motion. The movement now becomes a parade step, as the soloist marches up and downstage exuberantly swinging one arm as she kicks sideways {{with the opposite}} leg. Three times, the dancer advances kicking to the side. The movement alternates twice with a lunging backward kick and release step outlining a circular pattern on the stage. The dancer returns to the fence, once more aligning her body horizontally, then sinks to the floor. Now on her knees, <b>she</b> <b>leans</b> <b>back</b> with rigid thighs and torso in a movement known as a [...] "hinge". This resolves {{into a series of}} splits, a wide embrace of the air and return to a standing position.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> had <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> with closed eyes. A wave of {{exhaustion}} had swept over her. She listened in a dull dream. She felt beaten. They were {{too strong for}} her. There were too many of them. What did it matter? Why not give in, and end it all and win peace? That was all she wanted--peace now. What did it all matter? ...|$|R
60|$|And {{then her}} eyes closed. The {{voice of the}} Man from Nome had a monotony in its very earnestness. Besides, what dull talk was this of brooms and {{sweeping}} and dust? <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> her head <b>back</b> against the wall.|$|R
60|$|When {{they were}} once more in the car, <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> very silent, {{watching}} the traffic.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> in her chair, {{laughing}} heartily, {{her eyes}} bright, her beautiful white teeth in delightful evidence.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> in her {{armchair}} {{with her}} eyes half closed, and a quiet retrospective smile upon her face.|$|E
6000|$|... "See here, Julia, {{how long}} do you really expect me to endure this kind of thing?" [...] Julia made him no answer; <b>she</b> only <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> in her chair with her eyes upon his. He met her gaze a moment; then he turned round to the fire and for another moment looked into it. After this he faced his hostess again with the exclamation: [...] "It's so foolish--it's so damnably foolish!" ...|$|R
50|$|Shoulder Support (Left): When the follow spins to her left, {{the lead}} may grip her left {{shoulder}} or upper arm, {{with his left}} hand. She will stop spinning when his arm left blocks her body. During her spin, the lead's right hand holds the follow's right hand. This leads to a natural dip, where <b>she</b> simply <b>leans</b> <b>back,</b> while he supports her with both hands: his right hand holds her right hand behind his neck and his left hand holds her left shoulder.|$|R
6000|$|... "Pray {{tell me what}} it is," [...] said Dorothea, anxiously, also {{rising and}} going to the open window, where Monk was looking in, panting and wagging his tail. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> her <b>back</b> against the window-frame, and laid her hand on the dog's head; for though, as we know, she was not fond of pets that must be held in the hands or trodden on, she was always {{attentive}} to the feelings of dogs, and very polite if she had to decline their advances.|$|R
60|$|She {{led him to}} {{the couch}} and held his fingers in hers as <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> in a corner.|$|E
60|$|She played bridge later--brilliantly as usual, {{and with}} success. Then <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> {{in her chair}} and faced them all.|$|E
60|$|Lucille made no answer. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> {{and closed}} her eyes. She did not speak again till they reached Dover.|$|E
60|$|Lady Caroom made a {{delicate}} cannon from an awkward place, and concluded her break in silence. Then <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> with her <b>back</b> against the table, chalking her cue. Her figure {{was still the}} figure of a girl she was a remarkably pretty woman. She laid her slim white fingers upon his coat-sleeve.|$|R
60|$|The cab drove off, {{skirting}} the gaily-lit crescent of Regent Street. The smile {{almost at once}} died away from her lips. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> forward and looked at herself {{in one of the}} oblong mirrors. Her face was almost colourless, the skin seemed drawn closely round her eyes, giving her almost a strained look. For the rest, her hair, smoothly brushed away from her face, was in perfect order, her prim little hat was at exactly the right angle, her little white tie alone relieved the sombreness of her black jacket. She sighed and suddenly felt a moistening of her hot eyes. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> far <b>back</b> into the corner of the cab.|$|R
5000|$|... "Bollywood Homicide" [...] (4.06) - When Shawn asks if Juliet {{believes}} in love curses, she says whenever someone {{is looking for}} their soulmate, it can feel like outsides forces are conspiring against them. Shawn moves closer to Juliet, and <b>she</b> <b>leans</b> <b>back,</b> probably thinking that Shawn is going to kiss her. She asks, [...] "Shawn, what are you doing?" [...] Shawn does not answer the question, instead pointing out a clue {{that he had been}} looking at while they were moving toward each other. When Raj and Juliet go on their pretend date, Shawn, watching from a car, is clearly jealous when Raj starts to hold Juliet's hand, as noted by Gus and Lassiter. Later, Shawn rescues Juliet from an unstable suspect threatening her with a knife. Abigail tells Shawn that she was very impressed that he would risk his life for a random co-worker. Shawn glances over at Juliet and says, [...] "She's not random." [...] So Abigail wouldn't get the wrong impression, Shawn quickly corrects himself, saying he would do that for anyone.|$|R
