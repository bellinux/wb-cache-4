40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the use of {{externally}} bonded Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) materials to <b>strengthen</b> steel plates subjected to compression. A fully slender steel section was selected in this test programme. CFRP <b>strengthened</b> steel plates and non <b>strengthened</b> plates were tested to fail under compressive load. The middle part of the strut was <b>strengthened</b> using CFRP sheet. The length of the <b>strengthened</b> zone was varied. Eight specimens were tested in this test programme. The test results showed a significant strength gain of 47 % and delaying of lateral torsional buckling failure mode of <b>strengthened</b> members.

40|$|This study {{presents}} an experimental and analytical investigation {{to compare the}} structural behaviour of externally bonded steel plates and Carbon Fiber Reinforceed Polymer (CFRP) laminates flexurally <b>strengthened</b> r. c. beams. For the experimental investigation, three r. c. beams were cast. One beam was tested in the un-strengthened condition to act as the control beam. The second beam was <b>strengthened</b> using steel plate while the third beam was <b>strengthened</b> using CFRP laminate. The <b>strengthened</b> beams were designed {{to have the same}} strength with the assumption that they would fail in a ductile manner. The test results indicated that although both beams were designed for the same strength, the CFRP laminate <b>strengthened</b> beam recorded a slightly higher failure load compared to the steel plate <b>strengthened</b> beam. The steel plate <b>strengthened</b> beam recorded a higher cracking load and less deflections, reinforcement bar strains, concrete strains and crack widths compared to the CFRP laminate <b>strengthened</b> beam. Results also showed that the CFRP laminate <b>strengthened</b> beam failed by premature concrete cover separation failure, whereas the steel plate <b>strengthened</b> beam failed by premature plate end interfacial debonding followed by concrete cover separation. The beams were also modelled using a Finite Element Method (FEM) package. The numerical results seemed to agree well with the experimental results...|$|R
5|$|On 12 April, the {{previously}} detrimental wind shear began easing, allowing the structure {{to become more}} symmetric.

At 06:00UTC on 13 April, the MFR upgraded Fantala to tropical cyclone status, with 10minute winds of 130km/h (80mph). By that time, the eye feature persisted, consisting of a warm area within the deepest convection, although the dry air in the region prevented quicker <b>strengthening.</b>|$|E

Late on August2, the system attained winds of 135mph (215km/h), making it a Category4 storm.

40|$|This study {{presents}} the results of an experimental study investigating the effect of U-shaped end anchors on flexurally <b>strengthened</b> reinforced concrete beams for the prevention of premature end peeling. A simple design guideline for the anchorage length of end anchor is proposed. A total of five beams, each 2300 mm long, 125 mm wide and 250 mm deep with a tension steel reinforcement ratio of 0. 73 %, was cast and tested. One beam was left un-strengthened and used as a control, two beams were <b>strengthened</b> with steel plates and the remaining two beams were <b>strengthened</b> with Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) laminates. One each of the steel plate and CFRP laminate <b>strengthened</b> beams were further <b>strengthened</b> with mild steel U-shape end-anchors {{at both ends of the}} beams. The beams were then tested under two-point loading. The experimental results revealed that the U-shaped end anchors of designed anchorage length eliminated premature end peeling and it had significant effects on the failure mode, ultimate load, deflections and strain characteristics of the <b>strengthened</b> beams. It is seen from the results that the end-anchored <b>strengthened</b> beams showed higher ultimate load and more ductile behaviour compared to the un-anchored <b>strengthened</b> beams...|$|R

40|$|End anchors {{have been}} shown to {{significantly}} reduce premature plate end debonding failure of plate bonded <b>strengthened</b> reinforced concrete (r. c.) beams. One of the main interest in designing end anchors is to determine the minimum or optimal length of end anchors for a given thickness and height of the end anchor. This paper presents experimental and numerical studies in determining those optimum lengths for steel plate and carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) laminate flexurally <b>strengthened</b> r. c. beams. In the experimental programme, seven r. c. beams were cast. One beam was tested in the un-strengthened condition to act as the control beam. Three beams were <b>strengthened</b> with steel plates and another three beams were <b>strengthened</b> with CFRP laminates. From each group of the <b>strengthened</b> beams, one beam was <b>strengthened</b> without any end anchor, one was end anchored using the optimum anchorage length and the last one was end anchored using an arbitrarily 200 mm anchorage length. The optimum length for the end anchor used in this study was derived from analyzing the interfacial stress diagram of the <b>strengthened</b> beams and was found to be approximately 100 mm. The beams were also modelled using FEM (LUSAS). The results indicate that the optimized 100 mm anchorage length plates were able to prevent premature plate end debonding failure of steel plate and CFRP laminate <b>strengthened</b> beams satisfactorily. It could also be seen from the results that beams with end anchors had a higher failure loads and had more ductile behaviour than the un-anchored <b>strengthened</b> beams. Results also show that the optimized end anchored <b>strengthened</b> beams had identical structural behaviour to that of the longer end anchored <b>strengthened</b> beams. The numerical results are able to predict the behaviour of the beams satisfactorily...|$|R
