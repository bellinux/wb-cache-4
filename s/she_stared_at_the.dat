60|$|<b>She</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> mud-browned chilly water, the {{floating}} gray reeds.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{paper in}} her hand. Then {{she looked away}} into the fire.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Baxters {{like one}} in a dream, and then gave a sudden cry of alarm.|$|E
5000|$|Eventually, Linda {{visits the}} site of <b>the</b> {{accident}}. <b>She</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Mile 220" [...] sign, which is where Sheriff Reilly told her the accident took place. Images of her family flash before her eyes as Linda tries {{to decide what to}} do.|$|R
60|$|But Cicely did not stir; <b>she</b> only <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> wretched {{creature}} <b>at</b> her feet.|$|R
2500|$|Utamaro {{depicts the}} courtesan Hanaōgi of the Ōgiya (...) as she composes a letter, writing brush held {{to her cheek}} as <b>she</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> paper deep in thought. [...] The Ōgiya was a large, {{long-established}} shop in Yoshiwara, and Hanaōgi built her reputation in the 1780s for her beauty and her skills in singing, playing the koto, the tea ceremony, the Chinese classics, and incense.|$|R
60|$|She {{handed over}} her bank-book with the money. Receiving the former back, <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> mysterious figures with rapt attention.|$|E
60|$|Perhaps you {{can imagine}} how startled Jane Gladys was, and how <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> clown who had just leaped out of the book.|$|E
60|$|He noticed Joan's white, tense face, and {{the wide}} eyes with which <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> wreck {{of what had been}} a man the minute before.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>stared</b> down <b>at</b> <b>the</b> picture interestedly, forgetting him, {{pinching}} {{her chin}} thoughtfully, while she murmured: [...] "They're rather nice. Rather good. Rather good." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> him, <b>the</b> joy of festival {{drained from}} her face. [...] "Do I bother {{you when we}} go on vacations? Don't I add {{anything}} to your fun?" ...|$|R
50|$|Lorraine {{takes him}} to an old mine, and shows him a dark hole {{that leads to a}} caved in lower shaft. She and Hex journey down, and it is {{revealed}} that Lorraine has murdered at least fifteen men. Grabbing a knife, Lorraine tries once more to kill Hex, who punches her and secures Red's body. Lorraine comes to just as Hex reaches the top and kicks down the rope trapping her there. Lorraine first pleads that they can be partners, then tells Hex he can't leave her. Hex says she has plenty of companions whom she knows, then departs. Lorraine trembles as <b>she</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> dead bodies, the only lamp in the shaft slowly going out, leaving her trapped in the dark.|$|R
60|$|Elsa's jaw fell. <b>She</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> traitor {{like one}} paralysed, while Adrian, seizing {{the back of}} a chair, rested upon it, and rocked his body to and fro.|$|E
60|$|He stopped. The {{effect of}} his words on the elderly lady was remarkable. Her face seemed to turn to stone and become all sharp points. <b>She</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> girl.|$|E
60|$|It was Mrs. Paston Benedek {{who opened}} it. <b>She</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> first sheet {{for a moment}} with eyes which were almost dilated. Then she looked around. Her voice sounded unnatural.|$|E
60|$|Just then a small girl about {{thirteen}} years old passed us--a {{child with a}} thin anxious face burnt by the sun to a dark brown, and deep-set, dark blue, penetrating eyes. It was a face to startle one; and as she went by <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> intently <b>at</b> <b>the</b> little freckled girl.|$|R
25|$|Pilot {{awareness}} and response. Ideally, pilots will {{be aware of}} laser and bright light hazards, and will know how to recover {{in case of an}} incident. Conversely, a pilot can make the situation worse if he or <b>she</b> overreacts, <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> light to try to locate its source, or takes immediate unnecessary evasive maneuvers.|$|R
6000|$|... "I knew {{by seeing}} her take notice, sir. <b>She</b> used to <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> candles, and clutch at {{things that were}} held before her, as other babies do." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> harsh {{bitterness}} of his voice. She {{was about to}} speak when the door opened, and Malcom ushered in Aunt Plessington and Uncle Hubert. Husband and wife hung for a moment, and then realized their talk was at an end....|$|E
6000|$|Lucy stifled a gasp of dismay. <b>She</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> wretched man. Had he forgotten? He {{thought that}} the house of his fathers was his still; and all that had parted him from it was gone from his memory. How could she tell him? ...|$|E
60|$|She {{surveyed}} the cat, but {{the cat was}} quite calm. Then she looked very, very hard at her lamp. It was a patent safety lamp, and had always behaved very well. Then <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> window, but the curtains were drawn and everything was in order.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> {{them through}} <b>the</b> {{instrument}} with an unmoved face. [...] "I thought so," [...] she answered shortly. [...] "The bacillus of pyaemia. A most virulent type. Exactly what I expected." ...|$|R
25|$|As {{the month}} {{comes to an}} end, with the sun due to rise, the vampires start to burn down the town to destroy {{evidence}} of their presence, and prevent any survivors from telling the world what happened. Realizing Stella is trapped and that he cannot beat the vampires in his current state, Eben turns himself into a vampire by injecting himself with Billy's infected blood. He confronts Marlow, and they get into a vicious fight, before Marlow is finally killed by having a hole punched through his head, causing the remaining vampires to flee. Knowing he will die soon, Eben and Stella go off to watch the sunrise together, sharing one last kiss. As the sun comes up, Eben's body burns to ash in Stella's arms, while <b>she</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sky, {{coming to grips with}} what has happened.|$|R
40|$|Photographic {{portrait}} of a young Yaqui Indian woman, Arizona, ca. 1910. She is shown from the waist up. She is wrapped (including her head) in a thin blanket or shawl. Her arms hug her torso. She is standing near a rough timber post, another of which is visible behind her. <b>She</b> <b>stares</b> intently <b>at</b> <b>the</b> viewer...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Clifford ceased speaking, {{and filled}} his pipe, while Meyer helped himself to squareface in an absent manner. As for Benita, <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> quaint old coin, {{which had a}} hole in it, {{wondering}} with what scenes of terror and of bloodshed it had been connected.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{that you}} are really clear of it, I am going for them," [...] she said {{presently}} when the wiping process was finished. [...] "I have only restrained myself for your sake," [...] and leaning {{back in her chair}} <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ceiling, lost in meditation.|$|E
6000|$|Then he drew to {{the corner}} of the room and {{consulted}} with Sarceda and the other torturers, leaving Marina face to face with Guatemoc and with me. For a while <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> prince as though in horror, then a strange light came into her beautiful eyes, and she spoke to him in a low voice, saying in the Aztec tongue: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is all so horrible," [...] said Grace, bending {{back her}} head, so that as I glanced over my {{shoulder}} I could see her firm white neck through the laces as <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> upward <b>at</b> <b>the</b> streak of blue sky so far above. Then she turned her face toward me again, {{and it seemed to}} my excited fancy that it had grown ethereal.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> him blankly. <b>The</b> colour in {{her cheek}} {{was like a}} lurid patch under the pallor of her skin. She gave a little gasp, and her hand went to her side. Then she laughed hardly, almost offensively.|$|R
500|$|She {{then walks}} past several people, dances with several {{men and women}} in white and black suits and dresses, as the second chorus begins. Beyoncé and the dancers perform a dance routine together, and soon she meets a man, who dances with her. A {{particular}} scene shows all the dancers crouch down to the floor, and follow Beyoncé as she walks, before she blows them back. [...] The bridge starts, and the video moves to Beyoncé in a red room, where she and her dancers dance in short skirts, fishnets and black sparkling dresses. The group is later dance in the red and white rooms together. Leading into the final chorus, Beyoncé dances back in the room with the dancers, while Rowland, Williams and her sister sit on a black couch. As the video ends, Beyoncé {{stands in front of the}} mirror she was <b>at</b> <b>the</b> start and fades to black as <b>she</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> viewer through it.|$|R
60|$|So {{he shrugged}} his shoulders, and they limped forward up the roofless nave {{and through the}} door. <b>She</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> plain stone altar, at the eastern window, of which part was filled with ancient {{coloured}} glass and part with cheap glazed panes; at the oak choir benches, mouldy and broken; at the few wall-slabs and decaying monuments, and at the roof still strong and massive.|$|E
60|$|The girls laughed, and Josie blushed as <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> tall man, {{conscious}} {{that she had}} leaped before she looked. They made a pretty contrast, these two young cousins--one as fair as a lily, the other a little wild rose. And Dan gave a nod of satisfaction as he surveyed them; for he had seen many bonny girls in his travels, and was glad that these old friends were blooming so beautifully.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was past}} midnight. Deep {{darkness}} and heavy silence lay upon Thebes, {{broken only by}} dogs howling at {{the stars and the}} occasional challenge of soldiers on the walls. Side by side in their golden bed the wearied Pharaoh and his queen slept heavily. Presently Ahura woke. She started up in the bed; <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> darkness about her with frightened eyes; she stretched out her hand and clasping Pharaoh by the arm, whispered in a thrilling voice, ...|$|E
60|$|A {{cold and}} awful {{quietness}} fell on Sheila's heart. <b>She</b> <b>stared</b> fixedly <b>at</b> <b>the</b> tuft of dark hair, the only visible {{sign of her}} husband, on the pillow. Then, taking up the basin of cold cornflour, she left the room. In {{a quarter of an}} hour she reappeared carrying a tray, with ham and eggs and coffee and honey invitingly displayed. She laid it down.|$|R
5000|$|The {{film was}} {{reviewed}} favourably by the eminent critic Pauline Kael in her collection Hooked. [...] "This film has wonderful uninsistent images. It's poverty-row film making, {{and often the}} shots don't match. But it's the kind of movie in which you rather enjoy the shots' not matching. It draws you into the moviemaking process; the informality is likable. After little Vicky has watched her father flying around the tank (he loves it, he's completely happy), she too, becomes obsessed, and there's a shot of her, her face as determined as his, as she rides her tricycle along the Wall, trying to climb it. She wakes up one night hearing the crackling sound of burning wood; she rushes {{out the front door}} and sees her parents and her Uncle Arthur watching a fire, and <b>she</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> spectacle without a sound, the flames lighting her awed, startled face. For an instant, with her hair streaming back from her head, she's the soul of Ireland, the way Sara Allgood was when she played in Juno and the Paycock." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{problem is}} insoluble. The body is {{harnessed}} to a brain. Beauty {{goes hand in}} hand with stupidity. There she sat staring <b>at</b> <b>the</b> fire as <b>she</b> had <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> broken mustard-pot. In spite of defending indecency, Jacob doubted whether he liked it in the raw. He had a violent reversion towards male society, cloistered rooms, and the works of the classics; and was ready to turn with wrath upon whoever it was who had fashioned life thus.|$|R
