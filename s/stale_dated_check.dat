The exploratory study aimed at determining the options of monitoring noise emission from roadways consisted of 10 days of measuring noise on a site located along the A 2 roadway (major north-south road connection in the Netherlands) at the elevation of Breukelen (nearby Utrecht). The measured data was combined with traffic-volume and -velocity data to differentiate between the various vehicle categories and to determine noise emission levels independent of traffic volume. The measurements were compared with model predictions as well. The results indicate that continuous monitoring of noise levels on sites along the roadway will offer possibilities for keeping emission data up to <b>date,</b> <b>checking</b> model predictions and evaluating the effect of policies on noise emission issuing from roadways.

Because there are many providers of smart phones, which run on different platforms, there is also an increase of the number of platforms.

40|$|Objective. To {{determine}} {{the level of}} support among pharmacists in central Scotland to serve as mentors and provide practice-based experience to students enrolled in a master of pharmacy degree program. Methods. A study was conducted during the 2011 - 2012 academic year in which first-year MPharm students in Scotland were paired with practicing pharmacists for 2 half-day visits per month. The students were integrated into the pharmacy workflow and engaged in activities ranging from <b>date</b> <b>checking</b> to counseling patients. The pharmacists and students who participated {{were asked to complete}} a survey in spring 2012 regarding their experiences and, in addition, the students were asked to maintain diary entries describing their experiences. Results. Thirty-nine students were paired successfully with 38 pharmacists. Every pharmacist stated their student was welcome to return in the 2012 - 2013 academic year and 29 agreed to accept a second student. Nine of 12 participating chain community pharmacies asked for program expansion and 11 chain community pharmacies and one other community pharmacy that did not participate in 2011 - 2012 asked to join in 2012 - 2013.

40|$|Background. Protecting {{public funds}} {{is a high}} {{priority}} for all governments. The Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) regulates and defines the responsibilities of counterparties in business and banking transactions. The code states that liability and monetary loss in a fraudulent transaction is split between the counterparties in a transaction based on each party’s due diligence and negligence. Consequently, to reduce liability {{in the event of a}} fraudulent transaction, it is important to have proper controls in place. Advances in technology have reduced the effectiveness of traditional fraud prevention techniques and have even enabled new forms of fraud. For example, in the past, many governments relied upon physical security features embedded in check stock to prevent check fraud. These included watermarks, unique colors, and graphical designs. Advanced duplication technology and remote deposit capture have reduced the effectiveness of these physical measures to prevent fraud. The banking industry has developed the following fraud prevention tools: Positive pay is a type of account reconciliation service provided by banks. In positive pay, a bank compares checks that it receives for payment against the record of the checks issued by the government. If the bank receives a check that does not match the information (<b>date,</b> <b>check</b> number, and amount) in the government’s record, it identifies it as an exception item (i. e., a non-conforming positive pay item) ...|$|R

40|$|This work {{deals with}} the dating of Mount Etna lava flows and eruptive fissure {{deposits}} to the last four millennia following field investigations and stratigraphic data (BRANCA et alii, 2011 a). We have studied 24 of these volcanic products, including 301 large samples, through high precision archeomagnetic <b>dating</b> <b>checked</b> by 226 Ra- 230 Th radiochronology, thus providing additional material to the previous paper by TANGUY et alii (2007). In most cases our results allow attributing ages to the historical period, although two flows are shown to be prehistoric. For the historic lavas, archeoma - gnetic ages can be defined within decades, except for three of them that erupted during a time span (Greco-Roman epoch) when the geomagnetic field underwent little variation. Although 60 % of these volcanics exhibit ages comprised between 700 AD and 1850, only one (1285) is mentioned by contemporary written accounts. We conclude that i) historical documents alone are insufficient to reconstruct a coherent sequence of eruptions, and ii) a multidisciplinary approach is necessary to obtain a comprehensive eruptive history of such a very active volcano, useful for both scientific and civil protection purposes, even for such a geologically recent period {{as that of the}} last 10 or 20 centuries. Thanks to these new archeomagnetic and 226 Ra- 230 Th data coupled with stratigraphic data, a comprehensive volcanic history of the still-outcropping Mount Etna volcanics is now available for the last 2, 400 years.
