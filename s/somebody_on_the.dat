500|$|The episode {{features}} {{the death of}} Jeremy Davies character Daniel Faraday. Daniel {{was introduced in the}} fourth season and was originally intended to be a minor character only. However, his quiet demeanor and seemingly good heart made him a favorite with the fans, so Lindelof and Cuse decided to expand Daniel's role, which has led to him being a key player in Losts eventual resolution. In response to Daniel's death, Cuse said, [...] "It was an incredibly painful thing to kill this beloved character, but we feel that’s what this show has to do. His death is kind of the culminating event in the entire season. It really ends one chapter and commences the start of the final chapter of the entire series." [...] Once the show runners explained that to Davies, he was saddened that his full-time status on Lost was coming to an end, but put the story [...] "above his own personal self". Damon seconded Carlton's emotions, adding that Jeremy took the news well: [...] "When Carlton and I called Jeremy to explain what was going to be happening with Daniel, we’ve never had a more awesome exit interview with <b>somebody</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> show. For us, Daniel really was the cornerstone of the fifth season – he really shined. I can’t imagine what Season 5 would have looked like without Jeremy Davies. When you think about all the crazy stuff that had to come out of that guy’s mouth, for him to be as interesting and emotional and poetic as he was is really extraordinary." [...] The cast of the show said Davies would be missed, though he may not be done with Lost — Carlton commented that Jeremy's [...] "full-time" [...] status was over, but dead characters have been known to reappear on the show. Michael Emerson, who plays Ben, said Davies was [...] "a great sensitive guy who got deep into his character, he really lived it." ...|$|E
500|$|The alien costume {{featured}} in Night of the Blood Beast {{was the same}} as the one used in another Roger Corman film, Teenage Caveman (1958). [...] This was done to save money, as the Cormans often tried to incorporate existing sets, costumes and other elements from previous films into new ones for financial savings. Varno said the Corman brothers were so conscious of their spending that [...] "'cheap' was the main word in their vocabulary". The monster costume scenes in Teenage Caveman and Night of the Blood Beast were shot within about two weeks of each other. The costume was modified slightly for Blood Beast; Varno claimed <b>somebody</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> set said [...] "the nose looks too Jewish", so it was cut down slightly to more resemble a beak. Ross Sturlin wore the costume for the scenes in both Teenage Caveman and Night of the Blood Beast. Filming was very difficult for Sturlin because it grew extremely hot inside the costume during the exterior shots. John Mathew Nickolaus, Jr. was director of photography for the film, and Jack Bohrer was the production manager. Daniel Haller, who {{went on to become a}} film director himself, worked as art director on Night of the Blood Beast. Haller did much of the manual construction work on the set himself, and brought a trailer in to the sound stage so he could sleep there and between work sessions. Among the props he built was the rocket-ship, the frame of which was made of plywood that had been cut into circles, then covered with a plastic sheet and spray-painted to look metallic. Haller also created blood cells that the characters looked at under a microscope, and the baby aliens (which resembled seahorses) they looked at under a fluoroscope. Alexander Laszlo composed the music for the film. Almost the entire crew went on to work on Attack of the Giant Leeches with the Corman brothers and Kowalski.|$|E

2500|$|The wing commander, Colonel Gabriel, {{was asked}} by Senator Stennis, {{what he thought about}} filing the false {{intelligence}} reports. Gabriel replied, [...] "My conjecture was... it goes to the world, the OPREP-4—-and I assume there was <b>somebody</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> loading list [...] that did not have a need to know, and the full report would be filed with the special report that was sent in at night." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1984, {{just after}} an ice hockey {{game in which}} Wayne Gretzky's Edmonton Oilers beat the New Jersey Devils 13–4, Gretzky {{was quoted as saying}} to a reporter, [...] "Well, it's time they got their act together, they're ruining the whole league. They had better stop running a Mickey Mouse {{organization}} and put <b>somebody</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ice". Reacting to Gretzky's comment, Devils fans wore Mickey Mouse apparel when the Oilers returned to New Jersey.|$|E
2500|$|On February 3, 2014, Justice Antonin Scalia, {{during a}} {{discussion}} with law students at the University of Hawaii at Manoa William S. Richardson School of Law, said that [...] "the Supreme Court's Korematsu decision upholding the internment of Japanese Americans was wrong, but it could happen again in war time." [...] In October 2015 at Santa Clara University Scalia told law students that Justice Jackson's dissenting opinion in Korematsu was the past court opinion he admired most, adding [...] "It was {{nice to know that}} at least <b>somebody</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> court realized that that was wrong." ...|$|E

2500|$|Environmental activists {{accused the}} council of using {{political}} pull to avoid the fines. McPherson and Farr confirmed that the Council requested that they contact regulators. Granite Construction, whose president David H. Watts {{is a member of}} the council board, gave $35,000 to McPherson. He also received $5,000 from Chapin Construction, headed by Donald Chapin. Rep. Sam Farr attended Pico Blanco Scout Reservation as a boy and his father Fred Farr contributed to the camp's development. When asked about the dam and its impact on the river, Farr stated that the dam has been there for almost 50 years. [...] "The rules had changed and nobody knew what the rules would be," [...] he said. [...] "All the Boy Scouts asked is how to operate the dam properly." [...] When asked about the influence of the $2000 campaign contribution he received from Granite Construction in 2006, he replied, [...] "That's the analogy that I suggested was insulting. It was like <b>somebody</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> PTA gave Sam Farr a contribution." ...|$|E
2500|$|At about 01:20 a weak {{female voice}} called [...] "Häire, häire, laeval on häire", Estonian for [...] "Alarm, alarm, there is alarm on the ship", over the public address system, which was {{followed}} immediately by an internal alarm for the crew, then one minute {{later by the}} general lifeboat alarm. The vessel's rapid list and the flooding prevented {{many people in the}} cabins from ascending to the boat deck. A Mayday was communicated by the ship's crew at 01:22, but did not follow international formats. Estonia directed a call to Silja Europa and only after making contact with her did the radio operator utter the word [...] "Mayday". In English, the radio operator on Silja Europa, chief mate Teijo Seppelin replied: [...] "Estonia, are you calling mayday?" [...] After that, the voice of Andres Tammes took over on Estonia and the conversation shifted to Finnish. Tammes was able to provide some details about their situation but due to loss of power, he could not give their position, which delayed rescue operations somewhat. Some minutes later power returned (or, <b>somebody</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bridge managed to lower himself to the starboard side of the bridge to check the marine GPS, which will display the ship's position even in blackout conditions), and the Estonia was able to radio their position to Silja Europa and Mariella. The ship disappeared from the radar screens of other ships at around 01:50, and sank at , about [...] on bearing 157° from Utö island, Finland, in [...] of water.|$|E
