5|$|In {{the wake}} of the storm, more than 1,000 Electricity <b>Supply</b> <b>Board</b> (ESB) {{personnel}} were deployed to restore power. In some areas, locals worked together to provide others with fresh food after electricity was lost. Fire brigades were sent on patrol to quell any looting. In Galway, ESB repair crews worked through labor and supply shortages to restore power and telephone service despite recent strikes in the company. By September 23, officials in the city appealed to the Government for funding to deal with the aftermath of the hurricane. Uncertainty over whether some of the cost could be footed by landowners themselves resulted in disagreement over how much aid to request. Due to the severity of damage to the electrical grid, there were numerous requests made to the ESB to build underground power cables, especially in Galway.|$|E
5|$|Known as the {{stamping}} privilege, companies, {{associations and}} individuals {{were permitted to}} submit their own designed and pre-printed envelopes, cards, letter sheets, etc., to the Irish Post Office for impressing with an official post-paid indicia. Window envelopes were popular for printed matter rate mail. The most prolific user was the Electricity <b>Supply</b> <b>Board</b> which used meter reading and appointment cards for over forty years. Stamped-to-order postal stationery users included Blackrock College, Córas Iompair Éireann, Esso, Great Northern Railway, and John Player & Sons, Dublin. No stamped-to-order registered envelopes are known. Apparently An Post have withdrawn the stamping privilege without any public notice, because stamped-to-order postal stationery has seldom been seen since An Post {{took control of the}} Irish Post Office in 1984, with only five users recorded by Jung. Between 1963 and 2000 a few philatelically influenced items are known produced by six users.|$|E

25|$|Fianna Fáil's {{economic}} programme {{marked a}} sharp break with their predecessors in Cumann na nGaedheal. Instead of Free Trade, which benefited mainly substantial farmers, Fianna Fáil pursued the nationalist aim of establishing Irish domestic industries, which were protected from foreign competitors by tariffs and subsidies. Fianna Fáil made it mandatory for foreign companies {{to have a}} quota of Irish members on their boards. They also set up {{a large number of}} semi-state companies such as the Electricity <b>Supply</b> <b>Board</b> and the Turf Development Board. While this state-led strategy had some positive results, emigration remained high throughout this period, with up to 75,000 leaving for Britain in the late 1930s.|$|E

From 15 to 27 October, data from the Electricity <b>Supply</b> <b>Board’s</b> (ESB) two sources were collected: 30 selected local areas 15; and the periodically reported overall numbers 16 with the associated occasional “heat maps” of the geographic distribution of outages.|$|R
25|$|The new {{government}} decided {{to concentrate on}} developing agriculture, while doing little to help the industrial sector. Agriculture responded well with stricter quality-control being introduced and the passing of a Land Act to help farmers buy their farms. Also, the Irish Sugar Company and the Agricultural Credit Corporation were established to encourage growth. However, the economic depression that hit in the 1930s soon undid the good work of Cosgrave and his ministers. Industry was seen as secondary to agriculture and little was done to improve it. The loss of the industrialised north-east of Ireland had a bad effect on {{the country as a}} whole. However, the Electricity <b>Supply</b> <b>Board,</b> with the first national grid in Europe, was established to provide employment and electricity to the new state.|$|E

Back working for the ESB in Ireland in 1956, he worked on a number of projects on the River Shannon. In 1958 Dooge became Professor of Civil engineering at University College Cork. In 1970 he became a Professor at University College Dublin. Between 1984 and 1987 Dooge worked at the Department of Engineering Hydrology at University College Galway.

Before its sale, the station was scheduled to close by 2010. Endesa propose building a 430MW combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) gas fired plant on the site. [...] The project would need a new 44.5km gas pipepline from the existing transmission network at Baunlusk, 6km south of Kilkenny City. A wind farm has now been built on the site, featuring 14 wind turbines generating electricity. It was completed in November 2002 and was the first wind farm on the east coast of Ireland. Wind farms now exist at a few other locations in the county, such as Ballywater Wind Farm, at Cahore (near Kilmuckridge), on the county's east coast, and Richfield wind farm, located in the southeast of the county.|$|E
