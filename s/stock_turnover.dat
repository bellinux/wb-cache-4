The main problem is the payment of regulatory fees by regional pharmacies, which are subsidized by region. Private pharmacies can not compete that conduct and they are facing a difficult competitive position. In the theoretical part I was dealing with explanations of accounting terms definition relating to pharmacy accounting, as well as accounting itself. I described standard accounting practices.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{examines}} {{mutual fund}} industry competition and concentration in 27 countries using {{a sample of}} almost 50, 000 mutual funds. The mutual fund industry is concentrated worldwide and some industries present large fund complexes. Our results indicate that countries with common law and higher <b>stock</b> market <b>turnover</b> are associated with low level industry concentration. There is more industry contestability in countries with better quality of institutions and where regulation is more open. Bank concentration and simultaneous restrictions to engage new activities in the financial industry tends to decrease firm entry in the mutual fund industry. The launch of new funds is positively related with openness of regulation and negatively related with industry age. Fees tend to be higher in countries with low <b>stock</b> market <b>turnover,</b> where industry size is smaller and where foreign mutual fund companies have a larger market share. Moreover, fund proliferation {{seems to be an}} important aspect of competition as it is negatively related with mutual fund fees. Overall, the results do not indicate a clear relation between competition and concentration, similar to the findings for the banking industry.

Utilizing five alternative measures of financial development, it employs a panel threshold regression approach to reexamine {{the effect of}} financial development and income on energy consumption. The analysis relies on a sample of 53 countries for the period 1999 – 2008, showing a single-threshold effect on energy consumption when private credit, domestic credit, value of traded stocks, and <b>stock</b> market <b>turnover</b> are used as financial development indicators. It implies that the sample can be split into two regimes: high income, and non-high income. Energy consumption increases with income in emerging market and developing economies, while in advanced economies energy consumption increases with income beyond {{a point at which}} the economy achieves a threshold level of income. In addition, in the non–high income regime, energy consumption increases with financial development when both private and domestic credit are used as financial development indicators.

40|$|Abstract: The authors study time-variation in the co-movements between daily {{stock and}} Treasury bond returns over 1986 to 2000. Their {{innovation}} {{is to examine}} whether variation in stock-bond return dynamics {{can be linked to}} non-return-based measures of stock market uncertainty, specifically the implied volatility (IV) from equity index options and detrended <b>stock</b> <b>turnover</b> (DTVR). The authors investigate two empirical questions suggested by recent literature on stock market uncertainty and cross-market hedging. First, from a forward-looking perspective, they find that the levels of IV and DTVR are both negatively associated with the future correlation between stock and bond returns. The probability of a negative correlation between daily stock and bond returns over the next month is several times greater following relatively high values of IV and DTVR. Second, from a contemporaneous perspective, the authors find that bond returns tend to be relatively high (low) during days when IV increases (decreases) and during days when <b>stock</b> <b>turnover</b> is unexpectedly high (low). Their findings suggest that stock market uncertainty has cross-market pricing influences that {{play an important role in}} understanding joint stock-bond price formation.

40|$|Abstract. The {{responses}} of high latitude ecosystems to global change involve complex interactions among environmental variables, vegetation distribution, carbon dynamics, {{and water and}} energy exchange. These responses may have important consequences for the earth system. In this study, we evaluated how vegetation distribution, carbon <b>stocks</b> and <b>turnover,</b> and water and energy exchange are related to environmental variation spanned by the network of the IGBP high latitude transects. While the most notable feature of the high latitude transects is that they generally span temperature gradients from southern to northern latitudes, there are substantial differences in temperature among the transects. Also, along each transect temperature co-varies with precipitation and photosynthetically active radiation, which are also variable among the transects. Both climate and disturbance interact to influence latitudinal patterns of vegetation and soil carbon storage among the transects, and vegetation distribution appears to interact with climate to determine exchanges of heat and moisture in high latitudes. Despite limitations imposed by the data we assembled, the analyses in this study have taken an important step toward clarifying the complexity of interactions among environmental variables, vegetation distribution, carbon <b>stocks</b> and <b>turnover,</b> and water and energy exchange in high latitude regions. This study reveals the need to conduct coordinated global change studies in high latitudes to further elucidate how interactions among climate, disturbance, and vegetation distribution influence carbon dynamics and water and energy exchange in high latitudes...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} risk-return {{characteristics}} of a rolling portfolio investment strategy where more than six thousand Nasdaq initial public offering (IPO) stocks are bought and held {{for up to five}} years. The average long-run portfolio return is low, but IPO stocks appear as ‘longshots’, as five-year buy-and-hold returns of 1000 % or more are somewhat more frequent than for non-issuing Nasdaq firms matched on size and book-to-market ratio. The typical IPO firm is of average Nasdaq market capitalization but has relatively low book-to-market ratio. We also show that IPO firms exhibit relatively high <b>stock</b> <b>turnover</b> and low leverage, which may lower systematic risk exposures. To examine this possibility, we launch an easily constructed ‘low minus high’ (LMH) <b>stock</b> <b>turnover</b> portfolio as a liquidity risk factor. The LMH factor produces significant betas for broad-based stock portfolios, as well as for our IPO portfolio and a comparison portfolio of seasoned equity offerings. The factor-model estimation also includes standard characteristics-based risk factors, and we explore mimicking portfolios for leverage-related macroeconomic risks. Because they track macroeconomic aggregates, these mimicking portfolios are relatively immune to market sentiment effects. Overall, we cannot reject the hypothesis that the realized return on the IPO portfolio is commensurable with the portfolio’s risk exposures, as defined here. asset pricing; capital structure; Initial Public Offering (IPO); liquidity; market efficiency; risk and return...|$|E
40|$|The retail grocery {{industry}} is serviced by truck wholesalers known as vendors, delivery persons, or route salespersons. The merchandise delivered by these individuals supplements central grocery distribution center deliveries {{and consists of}} items such as beer, soft drinks, potato chips, bread, and milk. Such transactions {{are referred to as}} direct store deliveries (DSD) with products coming directly from an independent distributor rather than from a central grocery warehouse. The retail food {{industry is}} more susceptible to delivery problems than other retail sectors because of high <b>stock</b> <b>turnover.</b> High <b>stock</b> <b>turnover</b> increases the number of direct store deliveries, and as a result, increases opportunities for vendors to steal. Opportunity to steal is one of five separate but interrelated theoretical paradigms identified by Hollinger and Clark (1985) as being used to explain workplace theft. As explained by this set of hypotheses, almost every employee can be tempted to steal from his or her employer (Astor 1972, Henry 1982). The key to understanding why employees may take company money or property lies in knowing the relative levels of opportunity available to them to steal (Hemphill 1969, Hollinger and Clark 1985). Thus, one element in reducing employee theft, according to this theory, consists of constraining opportunities to steal in the work environment.
