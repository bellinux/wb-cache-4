Lipoatrophy and mitochondrial toxicity {{have been linked to}} stavudine use, but it is unclear whether switching to a lower dose can reduce these toxicities while maintaining human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) suppression. METHODS: HIV-infected subjects receiving standard-dose stavudine with undetectable HIV type 1 RNA for < or = 6 months were randomized (ratio, 3 : 2) to receive one-half of the stavudine dose (<b>switch</b> <b>arm)</b> or to maintain the dose (continuation arm) while continuing to receive all other prescribed antiretrovirals. The following measurements were obtained at baseline and week 48 : fasting lactate, pyruvate, and lipid levels; results of whole-body dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry; and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) measurements in fat and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Change from baseline to week 48 was compared within and between groups. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients (79 % of whom were men and 79 % of whom were African American; median age, 45 years) were enrolled in the study, 15 were enrolled in the <b>switch</b> <b>arm,</b> and 9 were enrolled in the continuation arm. The median duration of stavudine treatment was 55 months (range, 21 - 126 months). The median CD 4 cell count was 558 cells/mm(3) (range, 207 - 1698 cells/mm(3)). At baseline, the study arms had similar demographic characteristics and laboratory indices, except for body mass index, total lean body mass, and triglyceride levels (all of which were higher in the <b>switch</b> <b>arm).</b> Three patients (2 in the <b>switch</b> <b>arm)</b> discontinued the study because of study-unrelated reasons. CD 4 cell counts remained unchanged. At 48 weeks, 6 patients (4 [27 %] in the <b>switch</b> <b>arm</b> and 2 [22 %] in the continuation arm) had detectable HIV RNA levels (median, 972 copies/mL; range, 60 - 49, 400 copies/mL). All patients with detectable HIV RNA levels reported significant lapses in treatment adherence; none exhibited mutations in HIV genotype. After the treatment switch, significant changes from study entry to week 48 were noted only for lactate level (median change, - 0. 27 mmol/L; range, - 1. 2 to 0. 25 mmol/L; P =. 02) and fat mtDNA (median change, 40 copies/cell; range, - 49 to 261 copies/cell; P =. 02). In the continuation arm, a significant loss of bone mineral density was seen at week 48 (median change, - 1. 7 %; range, - 6. 3 % to 0. 8 %; P =. 02). The only significant between-group difference was the change in bone mineral density from baseline (P =. 003). CONCLUSIONS: Reducing stavudine dose by one-half increased fat mtDNA and decreased lactate levels, suggesting improvement in mitochondrial indices while preserving HIV suppression in subjects who maintained adherence. A significant loss of bone mineral density was seen in patients receiving standard-dose stavudine but not in those receiving low-dose stavudine. These results suggest that switching to low-dose stavudine may improve mitochondrial indices while maintaining virological suppression...|$|E
40|$|Regulation {{of cardiac}} output is {{mediated}} by intrinsic and extrinsic factors that modulate the rhythmic transitions between contraction (systole) and relaxation (diastole). At {{the level of}} cardiac myofilaments, the troponin complex (troponin I (TnI), troponin C (TnC), and troponin T (TnT)) is the allosteric regulatory unit that controls the transition between active and inactive actomyosin cross-bridges. This is accomplished by the C-terminal <b>switch</b> <b>arm</b> of TnI toggling between actin during diastole and cTnC during systole in a calcium-dependent manner. These studies elucidate new knowledge regarding the structural, functional, and evolutionary implications of a histidine residue in the <b>switch</b> <b>arm</b> of troponin I. Molecular modeling of TnI isoforms and large scale bioinformatics analysis of chordate phylogenies were used to study {{the evolution of the}} cardiac troponin complex. At the molecular level, a single histidine to alanine substitution in the cTnI <b>switch</b> <b>arm</b> was the most effective mechanism for decreasing the binding free energy at the regulatory interface of TnI and TnC. Evidence suggests that this single amino acid substitution increases the intrinsic relaxation potential of the cTn complex enhancing diastolic performance to meet mammalian lusitropic demands. A histidine button in TnI is known to provide a therapeutic basis for pH responsive titratable inotropy in response to various cardiac stresses. As such, the physiological implications of a histidine button in mammalian cardiac TnI (cTnI A 164 H) were studied. Whole organ in vivo cardiac hemodynamic analysis shows that cTnI A 164 H Tg mice protect cardiac function from age-induced cardiomyopathy. Furthermore, cTnI A 164 H Tg hearts sustain cardiac performance during severe hypercapnic acidosis compared to complete pump failure with 100 % mortality observed in control mice. In situ and in silico site-directed protein mutagenesis, in vitro cellular biophysics, and atomic resolution molecular dynamics simulations were used to analyze the therapeutic basis for a histidine button in cTnI.

40|$|Background: Generic fixed dose {{combinations}} (FDCs) of nucleoside {{reverse transcriptase}} inhibitors (NRTIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) {{is commonly used}} in resource-limited settings to increase adherence to lifelong treatment. However, the cumulative evidence of the long-term complications, particularly mitochondrial toxicity of NRTIs, especially stavudine (or zidovudine), brings about widespread use of tenofovir (TDF). This study was aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of a FDC comprising 300 mg tenofovir (TDF), 300 mg LAM and 600 mg efavirenz (EFV). Methods: A Phase II open-label clinical trial was conducted at HIV-NAT, Thai AIDS Research Center, Thai Red Cross from April 2010 to December 2011. Patients were eligible to enroll if they were either: 1) on TDF, LAM and EFV as separate tablets, for at least 6 months with an undetectable viral load (= <b>switch</b> <b>arm)</b> or 2) treatment-na&#x 00 EF;ve. Safety profiles, including liver and renal functions, were assessed at baseline, weeks 4, 12, 24 and 48. In switch group, mid-dose TDF plasma concentrations were measured by HPLC at baseline and week 4 after a switch to single FDC tablet. Results: A total of 100 patients were enrolled (51 na&#x 00 EF;ve). Median age was 34 years and 30 % were female. The median baseline CD 4 cell count (IQR) was 512 (395 &#x 2013; 620) cells/L and 232 (164 &#x 2013; 284) cells/L for the <b>switch</b> <b>arm</b> and ARV-na&#x 00 EF;ve group, respectively. The median (IQR) log 10 HIV- 1 RNA for ARV-na&#x 00 EF;ve group was 4. 9 (4. 2 &#x 2013; 5. 3) copies/mL. By ITT analysis, the proportion of cases with HIV RNA&# 60; 50 copies/mL was 93 % and 92 % at week 24 and 48, respectively. Only 1 confirmed virological failure at week 12 with NNRTI-resistant mutations (A 98 G, K 103 N, V 118 I, E 138 Q, Y 181 C). The reported 3 SAEs (severe headache, infective endocarditis, cervical dysplasia) were found and one was possibly related to the study drug. There were 49 mild to moderate efavirenz-related central nervous system events, occurring in first few days-weeks. There were no statistically significant changes on renal function and liver enzymes. Mean plasma concentrations of all three drugs in FDC met the acceptable target levels. Conclusion: The generic FDC of TDF/ 3 TC/EFV was well tolerated and efficacious.

Here we report the durability of this finding. Methods: MARCH, an international, multicentre, randomized, 96 -week open-label switch study, enrolled HIV- 1 -infected adults with R 5 -tropic virus who were stable (> 24 weeks) and virologically suppressed [plasma viral load (pVL) < 50 HIV- 1 RNA copies/mL]. Participants were randomized to continue their current PI/r-based regimen (PI/r) or to switch to MVC plus two N(t) RTIs (MVC) (1 : 2 randomization). The primary endpoint was {{the difference in the}} proportion with pVL < 200 copies/mL at 96 weeks. The <b>switch</b> <b>arm</b> was defined as noninferior if the lower limit of the 95 % confidence interval (CI) for the difference was < − 12 % in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. Safety endpoints (the difference in the mean change from baseline or a comparison of proportions) were analysed as key secondary endpoints. Results: Eighty-two (PI/r) and 156 (MVC) participants were randomized and included in the ITT analysis; 71 (87 %) and 130 (83 %) were in follow-up and on therapy at week 96. At week 96, 89. 0 % and 90. 4 % in the PI/r and MVC arms, respectively, had pVL < 50 copies/mL (95 % CI - 6. 6, 10. 2). Moreover, in those switching away from PI/r, there were significant reductions in mean total cholesterol (differences 0. 31 mmol/L; P = 0. 02) and triglycerides (difference 0. 44 mmol/L; P < 0. 001). Changes in CD 4 T-cell count, renal function, and serious and nonserious adverse events were similar in the two arms.

Superior short-term (baseline to week 8) mean decreases in plasma HIV RNA (p, 0. 001) were achieved by both the addition and switch arms (0. 53 log 10 and 0. 54 log 10 copies/ml, respectively) compared with the continuation arm (0. 13 copies/ml) whereas no differences in long-term virologic suppression were observed (p 5 0. 30). At week 48, no differences were ob-served in the proportions of subjects who had HIV RNA levels below 500 copies/mL: 18 % of subjects in each treatment arm (3 -way p 5 1. 0). Overall, the treatments were well tolerated and only nine subjects (3 %) died or developed one or more AIDS-defining events.
