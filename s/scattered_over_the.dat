Four {{days after the}} battle, though, {{most of the men}} turned up at the headquarters on the Oder River or in Berlin, and Frederick's army recovered to a strength of 32,000 men and 50 artillery pieces.|$|E
5|$|Several {{groups of}} starfish, {{including}} Valvatida and Forcipulatida, possess pedicellariae. In Forcipulatida, such as Asterias and Pisaster, they occur in pompom-like tufts {{at the base}} of each spine, whereas in the Goniasteridae, such as Hippasteria phrygiana, the pedicellariae are <b>scattered</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> body surface. Some are thought to assist in defence, while others aid in feeding or in the removal of organisms attempting to settle on the starfish's surface. Some species like Labidiaster annulatus, Rathbunaster californicus and Novodinia antillensis use their large pedicellariae to capture small fish and crustaceans.|$|E
5|$|This design {{followed}} the older style of having reception rooms and bedrooms <b>scattered</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> two main floors. The layout used followed Roger Pratt's theory that guest and family rooms should be quite separate. As {{a consequence of}} this philosophy, the family occupied the rooms on {{the first and second}} floors of the west and east wings, with the state rooms in the centre. The great staircase, designed to be grand and imposing, rose to {{the east side of the}} house, and formed part of the guest's state route from the Hall and Saloon on the first floor to the principal dining room and bedroom on the second. This older concept is more clearly exemplified at the Elizabethan Hardwick Hall in neighbouring Derbyshire.|$|E

5|$|Tibbets {{died in his}} Columbus, Ohio, home on 1 November 2007, {{at the age of}} 92. He had {{suffered}} small strokes and heart failure during his final years and had been in hospice care. He was survived by his French-born wife, Andrea, and two sons from his first marriage, Paul III and Gene as well as his son, James, from his second marriage. Tibbets had asked for no funeral or headstone, because he feared that opponents of the bombing might use it as a place of protest or destruction. In accordance with his wishes, his body was cremated, and his ashes were <b>scattered</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> English Channel; he had flown over the Channel many times during the war.|$|E
5|$|Many {{patterns}} in nature are formed by cracks in sheets of materials. These patterns {{can be described}} by Gilbert tessellations, also known as random crack networks. The Gilbert tessellation is a mathematical model {{for the formation of}} mudcracks, needle-like crystals, and similar structures. The model, named after Edgar Gilbert, allows cracks to form starting from randomly <b>scattered</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> plane; each crack propagates in two opposite directions along a line through the initiation point, its slope chosen at random, creating a tessellation of irregular convex polygons. Basaltic lava flows often display columnar jointing as a result of contraction forces causing cracks as the lava cools. The extensive crack networks that develop often produce hexagonal columns of lava. One example of such an array of columns is the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland. Tessellated pavement, a characteristic example of which is found at Eaglehawk Neck on the Tasman Peninsula of Tasmania, is a rare sedimentary rock formation where the rock has fractured into rectangular blocks.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} {{numerous}} theatrical triumphs, Mahler's Vienna years were rarely smooth; his battles with singers {{and the house}} administration continued {{on and off for}} the whole of his tenure. While Mahler's methods improved standards, his histrionic and dictatorial conducting style was resented by orchestra members and singers alike. In December 1903 Mahler faced a revolt by stagehands, whose demands for better conditions he rejected in the belief that extremists were manipulating his staff. The anti-Semitic elements in Viennese society, long opposed to Mahler's appointment, continued to attack him relentlessly, and in 1907 instituted a press campaign designed to drive him out. By that time he was at odds with the opera house's administration over the amount of time he was spending on his own music, and was preparing to leave. In May 1907 he began discussions with Heinrich Conried, director of the New York Metropolitan Opera, and on 21 June signed a contract, on very favourable terms, for four seasons' conducting in New York. At {{the end of the summer}} he submitted his resignation to the Hofoper, and on 15 October 1907 conducted Fidelio, his 645th and final performance there. During his ten years in Vienna, Mahler had brought new life to the opera house and cleared its debts, but had won few friends—it was said that he treated his musicians in the way a lion tamer treated his animals. His departing message to the company, which he pinned to a notice board, was later torn down and <b>scattered</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> floor. After conducting the Hofoper orchestra in a farewell concert performance of his Second Symphony on 24 November, Mahler left Vienna for New York in early December.|$|E

40|$|A {{method for}} {{calibrating}} satellite sensors (such as the AVHRR visible and NIR bands) is proposed {{by which the}} sensors are calibrated using well-known physical characteristics of the atmosphere, ocean, and deserts, {{as well as the}} digital satellite imagery. The approach, independent of ground support, used the following three phenomena: molecular <b>scattering</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> ocean for absolute visible band calibration; ocean glint, to transfer the calibration from the visible band to the NIR band; and desert reflectance to monitor, independently, the stability of the visible and NIR bands. The method was applied to NOAA- 7, - 9, and - 11 sensors. The results of the ocean and the desert calibration methods were found to differ in the brightness range and the spectral response of the radiance source (molecular <b>scattering</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> ocean versus the desert reflectance) ...|$|R
