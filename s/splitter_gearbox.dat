50|$|New {{passenger}} models {{did not get}} the suffix so the 20 ft wheelbase version {{announced in}} 1968 was the PSU5.4R. The first was delivered to Córas Iompair Éireann. Differences from the PSU3A and 4A included the option of a ten-speed <b>splitter</b> <b>gearbox</b> with wide ratio five speed standard, a Worldmaster front axle and a Maudslay rear axle.|$|E
50|$|The {{engine was}} the Rolls-Royce C6SFL 12.17l six-cylinder {{supercharged}} diesel. This engine was {{more powerful than}} other tractors of this age and weight, with 190 hp at the engine and 150 drawbar hp. However the fuel consumption was also high, at 9.8 gallons per hour at full rate. The transmission was initially three-speed manual and a high-low-reverse <b>splitter</b> <b>gearbox</b> with a relatively small Borg & Beck 18 inch single plate dry clutch. This small clutch plate {{had a reputation for}} early failure if worked hard. An improvement from mid-production was the option of a Rolls-Royce hydraulic torque converter, the same converters Rolls-Royce were supplying with the same engines for the new British Rail DMU fleet.|$|E
