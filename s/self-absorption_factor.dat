40|$|The {{measurement}} of the absolute activity or the mass of radioactive substances by gamma spectrometry needs to include a correction for the radiation absorption inside the source volume, the so-called <b>self-absorption</b> <b>factor.</b> It depends on geometry and material composition of the source, the detector geometry and on the geometrical arrangement of source and gamma radiation detector; it can be calculated if full information about all that is available. This article however describes how to determine the <b>self-absorption</b> <b>factor</b> from measurements if the radiation sources are plates of uranium fuel with typical parameters of nuclear fuel for MTR reactors and without using detail information on the source geometry, thus allowing easy inspection without relying on - potentially falsified - declarations on the internal properties of the fuel objects and without calculation.

40|$|Radial {{dynamics}} and plasma focus pinch were influenced in slow compression mode by optically thick plasma due to radiation self-absorption. In this study, {{the role of}} radiation self-absorption in Mather type dense plasma focus (DPF) device was investigated. The impact of opacity in slow compression phase and the behaviour of optically thick plasma towards radiation emission were explored. The numerical modelling of self-absorption effect on radiation dynamics, focusing, cooling, collapse and influence of self-absorption on the radiation emission was performed. Lee Model was used for numerical simulation. The model was developed incorporating the various energy balances including thermodynamics, kinematics, radiation {{dynamics and}} was capable of yielding the plasma structure and trajectories. The snowplow model describes the axial rundown phase and slug model in radial phase of pinch. Numerical simulations were performed for the absorption of radiation within dense and optically thick plasma. It was found that a steady state pinch with constant radius was only possible at the Pease–Braginskii (PB) current of 1. 2 to 1. 6 MA for hydrogen and deuterium DPF. For lower and higher values of input current as compared to PB current, the pinch expands and collapses respectively. This current was reduced for heavier gases like Neon (Ne), Argon (Ar), Krypton (Kr) and Xenon (Xe) due to the emission of significant amount of line radiation. For Ne, Ar, Kr and Xe gases with different DPF configurations more severe radiative collapse was observed as compared without the <b>self-absorption</b> <b>factor.</b> It was found that for Ar with no self-absorption, the pinch boundary collapsed {{in only a few}} nanoseconds to the radius of 0. 1 mm set as cut-off in the model. The pinch does not attain the cut-off radius with self-absorption. In the case of Ne, there was no radiative collapse with <b>self-absorption</b> <b>factor</b> but radiative collapse occurs without self-absorption. A severe radiative collapse was also observed in both cases of Kr and Xe. It was inferred that the pinch radius collapses less when self-absorption was taken into account. The plasma opacity reduces the amount of radiation loss. Thus, self-absorption phenomenon was significant during the slow compression phase and needs to be considered in the design of a new DPF device...|$|E
40|$|Correction {{factors for}} the effect of {{thickness}} on the selfscattering, self-absorption, and backscattering of beta particles from indium foils were determined for irradiated foils of 0. 03 to 100 mg/cm/sup 2 /. The data were corrected for the activity produced by epithermal neutrons, self-shielding of thermal neutrons by the foil during irradiation, the backscatter from the foil support, and the contributions of gamma and x rays to the counting rate. The multiple beta spectra of indium produced a minimum in the self-absorption and self-scattering correction curve in the GM detector at approximately 1 mg/cm/ sup 2 / and a maximum at approximately 12 mg/cm/sup 2 /. The selfabsorption curve for indium in the 2 pi counter has the expected shape for a beta emitter with multiple spectra. The self-scattering and <b>self-absorption</b> correction <b>factors</b> for a 100 mg/cm/sup 2 / indium foil are approximately 1. 5 for a GM detector at 7 % geometry and approximately 3 for a 2 pi counter.

40|$|Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) is an {{attractive}} concept for radiation treatment of malignant tumours. The patients receive a 10 B-carrying compound with selective uptake in tumour cells, after which they are irradiated with epithermal neutrons. Theoretically, the tumour cells are killed by the high-LET particles produces in 10 B(n, alpha) 7 Li reactions inside or close to the cell nucleus, while healthy brain cells with no boron uptake will be spared. In practice, a successful BNCT depends on the actual boron-distribution in the tissue, and consequently a new boron-compound aimed for BNCT must undergo detailed bio-distribution studies before clinical trials. In experimental work there is accordingly a great need for methods for quantitative bio-distribution measurements in tissue samples. In this paper we present an improved technique for neutron activated autoradiography providing quantitative boron images of freeze-sectioned tissue specimens from highly malignant rat brain gliomas. Particular {{attention has been paid}} to the correlation with the morphology of the specimens and to the altered self-absorption properties due to freeze-drying.

40|$|The {{high energy}} (511 keV) {{annihilation}} photons used in {{positron emission tomography}} (PET) imaging generally require {{a substantial amount of}} lead to protect personnel and the general public from ionizing radiation. A cost-effective design of the PET facility that ensures radiation does not exceed formal dose limits requires accurate estimation of the necessary PET shielding. The American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) Task Group 108 recently published broad beam transmission factors based on Monte Carlo calculations of 511 keV photons. In this work, an extension to the AAPM model is presented, based on Monte Carlo simulations including the effects of self-absorption on the photon energy spectrum. Monte Carlo calculations were performed using MCNPX. The photon energy spectrum after self-absorption was computed by simulating a normal 18 FDG activity distribution in an anthropomorphic phantom. This spectrum was used to calculate the dose rate transmission factors for various wall thicknesses of lead, concrete, and iron. The method was validated by measurement and corresponding simulation of the transmission factors of an 18 FDG source in air and in PMMA. Furthermore, a method to generate 3 D area dose rate maps of PET facilities incorporating the calculated transmission tables is presented and applied to several shielding situations. The calculated <b>self-absorption</b> correction <b>factor</b> and the broad beam transmission factors resulting from Monte Carlo simulations of a monoenergetic point source emitting 511 keV photons were in excellent agreement with the results of the AAPM publication (0. 66 vs 0. 64 and R 2 = 0. 999, respectively). However, when all radiation physics, i. e., also the effect of self-absorption on the photon energy spectrum, is included in the Monte Carlo calculations, a substantial reduction in required shielding material was found. For example, including all radiation physics leads to 13. 3 mm of lead required to obtain a typical transmission factor of 0. 1, instead of 16. 0 mm of lead when the AAPM data including only the <b>self-absorption</b> correction <b>factor</b> are used. These findings were confirmed by the experimental measurements. The transmission factors produced in this work can be applied {{in the same manner as}} those estimated by AAPM to allow for a cost-effective design of PET and PET/CT facilities without violating radiation safety regulations. Taking into account the effect of self-absorption on the photon energy spectrum results in more accurate and cost-effective shielding requirement estimation...|$|R
40|$|To date, {{nearly all}} multi-wavelength {{modeling}} of long-duration gamma-ray bursts has ignored synchrotron {{radiation from the}} significant population of electrons expected to pass the shock without acceleration into a power-law distribution. We investigate the effect of including the contribution of thermal, non-accelerated electrons to synchrotron absorption and emission in the standard afterglow model, and show that these thermal electrons provide an additional source of opacity to synchrotron self-absorption, and yield an additional emission component at higher energies. The extra opacity results {{in an increase in}} the synchrotron <b>self-absorption</b> frequency by <b>factors</b> of 10 [...] 100 for fiducial parameters. The nature of the additional emission depends on the details of the thermal population, but is generally observed to yield a spectral peak in the optical brighter than radiation from the nonthermal population by similar factors a few seconds after the burst, remaining detectable at millimeter and radio frequencies several days later.

40|$|AbstractThe {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to study the associations among self-absorption and two dysfunctional forms of negative self-evaluation (comparative self-criticism and internalized self-criticism), adaptive perfectionism (high standards and orderliness), and maladaptive perfectionism (discrepancy). The maladaptive equivalent of self-awareness is conceptualized as self-absorption by Ingram (1990). One hundred and seventy-four university students and graduates attending a teacher certificate program completed the Self-Absorption Scale (SAS, McKenzie and Hoyle, R. H., 2008), the Levels of Self-Criticism (LOSC, Thompson and Zuroff, 2002) and the Almost Perfect Scale-Revised (APS-R; Slaney et al., 2001). Self absorption was measured by using the Turkish version of the <b>Self-Absorption</b> Scale. The <b>factor</b> structure of the Self-Absorption Scale was evaluated using exploratory factor analyses in the Turkish culture. The analyses yielded two <b>factors</b> namely, private <b>self-absorption</b> and public self-absorption. Multiple regression analyses showed that private self-absorption was positively predicted by discrepancy and internalized self-criticism. Public self-absorption was positively predicted by discrepancy, internalized self-criticism and comparative self-criticism. These findings provide evidence about the associations among self-absorption and maladaptive affect and cognition...|$|R
40|$|CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, {{operates}} {{high energy}} accelerators for particle physics research. Because of beam losses and subsequent particle interactions, radioactivity can be induced in certain accelerator components. Material and waste {{taken out of}} the accelerators facilities as a result of maintenance repair and upgrade actions as well as in case of decommissioning needs to be radiologically classied for future handling. Depending on the level of residual activity, some of these components are candidates for clearance from regulatory control in Switzerland. The Swiss radiation protection ordinance sets as criteria for clearance of material and waste from regulatory control the compliance with radionuclide specic limits for surface contamination and for specic activity as well as an ambient dose equivalent rate criterion. For objects with a mass below 1 kg a radionuclide specic clearance limit for total activity has to be respected. This work is focused on the specic activity criterion, whereby the Swiss clearance limits for specic activity correspond to the exemption limits for specic activity. The clearance from regulatory control performed at the exit of the facility is special, mainly due to the restricted infrastructural conditions and a limited time budget. In most cases the measurement has to be non-destructive, i. e. without measurements of disassembled subcomponents or sampling works for detailed mechanical, chemical or radiochemical analysis. In addition, some information of the complete activation process might not be available, e. g. the irradiation time prole, the chemical material composition or the object location when {{it has been in the}} facility. The present work tackles this challenge by dening enveloping conditions and parameter sets that allow to perform material clearance measurements, even without a detailed knowledge of object characteristics and radiological history. Representative input parameter ranges, e. g. reference material compositions or irradiation conditions, were determined and used for the calculation of the resulting radionuclide inventories. More than 28000 radionuclide inventories were calculated, analysed and visualized. A 600 -page report containing these data supplements this work. It was studied whether the detection limit of a total gamma counter, based on six large area scintillation detectors (RADOS RTM 661 / 440 lnc, produced by Mirion Technologies, Germany), is suciently low to reliably detect the radioactivity that corresponds to the clearance limits for the calculated radionuclide inventories. The gamma-ray signal per Swiss clearance limit was determined for the calculated radionuclide inventories of all selected reference materials and for all considered irradiation conditions and compared to the detection limit of the RADOS RTM 661 / 440 lnc. To include the detector response in the calculations, a photon energy dependent eciency function was determined for the total gamma counter. The dependence of the signal strength on the various parameters was analysed and the most conservative resulting radionuclide inventories, i. e. the ones with the lowest detectable gamma-ray signal per clearance limit, were identied and categorised by material as well as by irradiation condition. These enveloping radionuclide inventories allow performing clearance measurements, even without a detailed knowledge of object characteristics and radiological history. Furthermore, self-absorption eects as a function of the object geometry and material density were quantied by Monte-Carlo simulations and integrated in the clearance method by specifying <b>self-absorption</b> <b>factors.</b> The gamma-ray signal per Swiss clearance limit of the considered common materials for objects with a mass of 1 kg, the most penalising mass conguration according to the Swiss radiation protection ordinance, is above the detection limit of the RADOS RTM 661 / 440 lnc, even if the clearance limit is dominated by radionuclides that have no measurable gamma-ray emission. Consequently, by using the developed characterization method, this device can be used for the clearance of material and waste from CERN's accelerator facilities from Swiss regulatory control for the present Swiss clearance limits in force...|$|R
