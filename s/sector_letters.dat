40|$|AbstractIn the SUSY SU(5) GUT {{with the}} {{right-handed}} neutrinos, the neutrino Yukawa coupling induces the flavor-violating mass terms for the right-handed down squarks and left-handed sleptons, and they lead to imprint on the flavor physics in the hadronic and leptonic <b>sectors.</b> In this <b>Letter</b> we study CP violation in Bd 0 and Bs 0, which is {{induced by the}} tau-neutrino Yukawa coupling. In particular, we notice the correlation of the CP asymmetries in Bd 0 →φKs (SφKs) and Bs 0 →J/ψφ (SJ/ψφ) with other observables, such as Br(τ→μγ), the muon EDM (dμ), and the mixing-induced CP asymmetry in Bd 0 →Ms 0 γ (Absg), since they have a common origin of the CP and flavor violation. The measurements are expected to {{play a significant role}} for consistency check of the SUSY SU(5) GUT. The hierarchical right-handed neutrino masses make the correlation better. We find that the current bound on Br(τ→μγ) constrains the allowed region for SφKs in this model...|$|R
40|$|In {{a recent}} paper, {{we showed that}} tree level up-down {{unification}} of fermion Yukawa couplings is a natural consequence of a large class of supersymmetric models. They can lead to viable quark masses and mixings for moderately large values of tan β with interesting and testable predictions for CP violation in the hadronic <b>sector.</b> In this <b>letter,</b> we extend our discussion to the leptonic sector focusing on one particular class of these models, the supersymmetric left–right model with the seesaw mechanism for neutrino masses. We show that fitting the solar and the atmospheric neutrino data considerably restricts the Majorana–Yukawa couplings of the leptons in this model and leads to predictions for the decay τ → µ + γ, which {{is found to be}} accessible to the next generation of rare decay searches. We also show that the resulting parameter space of the model is consistent with the requirements of generating adequate baryon asymmetry through lepton–number violating decays of the right–handed neutrino...|$|R

The concept of dark energy was proposed for understanding this currently accelerating expansion of the universe, and then its existence was confirmed by several high precision observational experiments [2, 3], esp. the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) satellite experiment [2].

This conundrum may be solved by introducing a coupling between the two dark <b>sectors.</b> In this <b>Letter,</b> we study two cases of the coupled quintessence scenario.

Since the dynamics of this system is dominated by an attractor solution, the mass of dark matter particles is forced to change with time as {{to ensure that the}} ratio between the energy densities of dark matter and dark energy becomes a constant at late times, and one thus solve the cosmic coincidence problem naturally.

Our exact results agree with determinations of low even-integer Mellin moments and of the leading small-x terms in the flavour-singlet <b>sector.</b> In this <b>letter</b> we present compact and accurate parametrizations of the results and illustrate the numerical impact of the NNLO corrections. We have recently published the complete three-loop splitting functions P (2) {{for the evolution of}} unpolarized parton distributions of hadrons [1, 2]. Together with the second-order coefficient functions [3, 4, 5, 6, 7], these quantities form the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) approximation of massless perturbative QCD for the structure functions F 1, F 2 and F 3 in deep-inelastic scattering (DIS). The situation is different, however, for the longitudinal structure function FL = F 2 − 2 xF 1. Here the leading contribution to the coefficient functions is of first order in the strong coupling constant αs (instead of α 0 s as in F 1, 2, 3), and consequently the scheme dependence of the splitting functions P (2) is compensated only by the third-order coefficient functions. The latter quantities are thus required for completing the NNLO description of the structure functions in DIS...|$|R
40|$|Much {{is known}} about the charged sectors of Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). The state space {{displays}} rich superselection sectors where, in particular, the velocity of charged particles, like the electron, labels different sectors [1, 2]. The BRST charge can be used effectively to project out the gauge invariant, physical states, but the resulting state space is an infinite tensor product of these superselection sectors, i. e., the BRST charge is not capable, on its own, of distinguishing between these physically distinct <b>sectors.</b> In our <b>letter</b> [3] we introduced a new, non-local, non-covariant symmetry that projected out the static sector of QED (described by Dirac’s dressed electron). The non-static extension of Dirac’s construction are still BRST, and indeed anti-BRST, invariant, but are not invariant under our symmetry. As such our symmetry, in conjunction with BRST, can be used to extract an irreducible sector of the intricate structure of QED. Indeed, as one would expect to be able to recover the other, velocity dependent sectors in a similar fashion, we conjecture that our symmetry is but one member of a whole class of distinct, new, non-covariant symmetries of QED. In our presentation of the symmetry we took great pains to show that it really is a symmetry of QED. In the comment a simplistic argument is presented in free QED (which is, after all, a trivial theory without interaction or charges and which hence lacks the above superselectio...|$|R
5000|$|Hansen has {{commented on}} the {{relationship}} between the liberal arts and the U.S. business <b>sector</b> in <b>letters</b> to the editor, opinion editorials and articles. She has dismissed arguments brought forward by academics issuing that liberal arts colleges tend to disparage and undermine students who wish to participate in fields such as finance, business, and accounting. Author and 27th president of Dickinson College, William G. Durden charged liberal arts leaders with creating an elitist, “separatist” perspective. Hansen rejected this charge citing the [...] "intellectual and ethical virtues fostered by their undergraduate experience" [...] as a key to their success. She was quoted as saying:Rather than faulting liberal education for failing to prevent greed and corruption in corporate America, we need {{to do a better job}} of communicating what the CEOs who prefer to hire liberal arts graduates already know: Although our expertise rests in academic disciplines and our worth to society has much to do with the intrinsic human need to learn, we have many “practical” programs, and access to the broad learning achieved through a liberal education gives our graduates a realistic understanding of the complexity of the world and prepares them for lives satisfying to themselves and useful to others.Hansen has at times criticized collegiate admission practices stating that although restructuring the admissions platforms most universities use are generally agreed upon, how one is to do this is highly debatable. The shift from de-emphasizing individual performance and achievement, to general “authentically chosen” activities generating “emotional and ethical awareness and skills," [...] is, according to Hansen, [...] "doing more harm than good." [...] She refuted a report issued by the Harvard School of Education which asserted that colleges and universities will have a better pool of students should they choose to admit students based on group activities, putting less value on individual contribution. Hansen asserts that implementing admission standards that focus on these metrics [...] "invites only skepticism and confusion." [...] She notes that admission officers can't reasonably deduce whether a student has an appropriate level of gratitude from a supplementary essay. To implement these subjective metrics would mean dramatic changes to the culture and pedagogy of universities. Hansen states that low-income students can't easily find the specific jobs and work experience required of them to fill subjective and speculative metrics. She goes on to state that [...] "we know too little about how and when to identify, characterize, measure and develop the so-called noncognitive aspects of learning that this report asks colleges to evaluate. And I disagree that the gateway to college is the time or place to subject young people to the full impact of our ignorance about how to fairly assess things they should still be questioning and exploring -- like character, feelings, motives and values." ...|$|R
