25|$|When first carved, {{the surface}} of the moai was {{polished}} <b>smooth</b> by <b>rubbing</b> with pumice. Unfortunately, the easily worked tuff from which most moai were carved is also easily eroded, and, today, the best place to see the surface detail is on the few moai carved from basalt or in photographs and other archaeological records of moai surfaces protected by burial.|$|R
50|$|Whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) {{can also}} be hard to {{distinguish}} from western white pine (Pinus monticola) {{in the absence of}} cones. However, whitebark pine needles are entire (<b>smooth</b> when <b>rubbed</b> gently in either direction), whereas western white pine needles are finely serrated (feeling rough when rubbed gently from tip to base). Whitebark pine needles are also usually shorter, 4 - 7 cm long, overlapping in size with the larger 5 - 10 cm needles of the western white pine.|$|R
40|$|Diabetes is {{the leading}} cause of non-traumatic lower {{extremity}} amputations in the developed world, and approximately 14 to 24 % of patients with diabetes who develop a foot ulcer have an amputation. Research, however, has shown that the development of a foot ulcer may be preventable if you follow the simple lifestyle advice and visit your physician/podiatrist regularly. There are many things you can do to keep your feet healthy. 1. Take care of your diabetes. Keep your blood glucose in your target range. 2. Check your feet and toes every day. Look at your bare feet for red spots, cuts, swelling, and blisters. If you cannot see the bottoms of your feet, use a mirror or ask someone for help. 3. Be more active or exercise. Plan your physical activity program to keep weight down and improve circulation, walking is the best one for the feet. 4. Wash your feet every day. Using mild soap and lukewarm water, wash your feet in the mornings or before bed each evening. Dry them carefully, especially between the toes. 5. Keep your skin soft and <b>smooth.</b> <b>Rub</b> a thin coat of skin lotion over the tops an...|$|R

50|$|Apart from {{electric}} rays, {{which have}} a thick and flabby body, with soft, loose skin, chondrichthyans have tough skin covered with dermal teeth (again, Holocephali is an exception, as the teeth are lost in adults, only kept on the clasping organ seen on the caudal ventral surface of the male), also called placoid scales (or dermal denticles), making it feel like sandpaper. In most species, all dermal denticles are oriented in one direction, making the skin feel very <b>smooth</b> if <b>rubbed</b> {{in one direction and}} very rough if rubbed in the other.|$|R
50|$|In {{the absence}} of cones, limber pine can also be hard to tell from Western white pine (P. monticola) where they occur {{together}} in the northern Rockies and the Sierra Nevada east slope. The most useful clue here is that limber pine needles are entire (<b>smooth</b> when <b>rubbed</b> gently in both directions), whereas Western white pine needles are finely serrated (feeling rough when rubbed gently from tip to base). Limber pine needles are also usually shorter, 4 - 7 cm long, while western white pine needles are 5 - 10 cm, though the ranges overlap.|$|R

25|$|Latex, rubber {{suspended}} in water, {{was invented in}} 1920. Youngs Rubber Company {{was the first to}} manufacture a latex condom, an improved version of their Trojan brand. Latex condoms required less labor to produce than cement-dipped rubber condoms, which had to be <b>smoothed</b> by <b>rubbing</b> and trimming. Because it used water to suspend the rubber instead of gasoline and benzene, it eliminated the fire hazard previously associated with all condom factories. Latex condoms also performed better for the consumer: they were stronger and thinner than rubber condoms, and had a shelf life of five years (compared to three months for rubber). Europe's first latex condom was an export from Youngs Rubber Company in 1929. In 1932 the London Rubber Company, which had previously served as a wholesaler for German-manufactured condoms, became Europe's first manufacturer of latex condoms, the Durex.|$|R
50|$|For many decades, rubber condoms were {{manufactured}} by wrapping strips of raw rubber around penis-shaped molds, then dipping the wrapped molds in a chemical solution {{to cure the}} rubber. In 1912, Polish inventor Julius Fromm developed a new, improved manufacturing technique for condoms: dipping glass molds into a raw rubber solution. Called cement dipping, this method required adding gasoline or benzene to the rubber to make it liquid. Latex, rubber suspended in water, was invented in 1920. Latex condoms required less labor to produce than cement-dipped rubber condoms, {{which had to be}} <b>smoothed</b> by <b>rubbing</b> and trimming. The use of water to suspend the rubber instead of gasoline and benzene eliminated the fire hazard previously associated with all condom factories.

60|$|They had now {{arrived at}} Aunt Patsy's cabin, and Mrs Null entered, {{followed}} {{at a little}} distance by Croft. The old woman had seen them as they were walking along the road, and her little black eyes sparkled with peculiar animation behind her great spectacles. Her granddaughter happened not to be at home, but Aunt Patsy got up, and with her <b>apron</b> <b>rubbed</b> off the bottoms of two chairs, which she placed in convenient positions for her expected visitors. When they came in they found her in a very perturbed condition. She answered Mrs Null's questions with a very few words and a great many grunts, and kept her eyes fixed nearly all the time upon Mr Croft, endeavoring to find out, perhaps, if he had yet been subjected {{to any kind of}} conjuring.|$|R
50|$|Sharks are {{sometimes}} regarded as {{being among the}} ritually unclean foods according to these regulations, as {{they appear to have}} a smooth skin. However, sharks do have scales, they are just placoid scales, which are denser and appear <b>smooth</b> if <b>rubbed</b> in one direction, in contrast to leptoid scales, ganoid scales, and cosmoid scales. The sturgeon, and related fish, are also sometimes included among the ritually impure foods, as their surfaces are covered in scutes, which are bony armoured nodules; however, fish scutes are actually just hardened and enlarged scales. Scales has thus been traditionally interpreted along the lines of Nahmanides's proposal that qasqeseth (scales) must refer specifically to scales that can be detached, by hand or with a knife, without ripping the skin. In practice this excludes all but cycloid and ctenoid scales. A minor controversy arises {{from the fact that the}} appearance of the scales of sturgeon, swordfish, and catfish is heavily affected by the ageing process - their young satisfy Nahmanides' rule, but when they reach adulthood they do not.|$|R
40|$|There is a cloister of monks {{that makes}} wooden bowls from green, uncured lumber. The bowls are very {{beautiful}} but they immediately begin to crack as the wood dries out and shrinks as wood {{is prone to}} do. This is no surprise to the monks. When the cracks occur, the monks very carefully begin a process of repair. The repairs are made with a type of white plaster and, as the plaster sets, the bowls are sanded and <b>rubbed</b> <b>smooth</b> again. And again. And again. And again. The white plaster against the blood black wood makes traces and lines that look like river systems, arteries and veins. The bowls are things of absolute beauty. They do not look broken or like they have ever been fixed...|$|R
50|$|Muddy Creek and Quitchupah {{residents}} consolidated on {{this new}} townsite. Log cabins were built as soon as logs could be hauled from the nearby mountains. The logs were smoothed on one side with grooves chopped in each end. They were then placed {{on top of each}} other with the smooth side facing inward. Chinks between the logs were filled with mud or clay. Willows were used for lath, nailed to the logs and plastered with mud. This mud was then <b>rubbed</b> <b>smooth</b> and painted with a whitewash of lime. The roofs were made of rough lumber, and covered with a layer of straw or brush and then a top layer of dirt. Later the roofs were greatly improved when cedar shingles became available.|$|R
5000|$|The {{cabin was}} one of two built by {{settlers}} Charles Johnson and Joseph Lund on Muddy Creek homesteads. While earlier arrivals had lived in [...] "dugouts" [...] the Lund cabin was the first log home to be built in the area. When Lund moved back to Spring City, rancher Casper Christensen moved his family into the abandoned cabin. Christensen was named postmaster of the area in 1882, and his log home became the official post office of both Muddy Creek and Quitchupah. The logs were cut and hauled from nearby Miller’s canyon. The logs were smoothed on one-side with grooves chopped in each end. They were then placed {{on top of each other}} with the smooth side facing inward. Chinks between the logs were filled with mud or clay. Willows were used for lath, nailed to the logs, and plastered with mud. The mud was then <b>rubbed</b> <b>smooth</b> and painted with a whitewash of lime. The roof was made with cedar shingles.|$|R
50|$|The early {{forms of}} the katcina figure belonged to the Early Traditional Period. Only one piece of cottonwood root was used to carve the body, {{although}} facial features made from varying sources were occasionally glued on. The figures were no longer than 8-10 inches and only somewhat resembled human proportions. Sandpaper and wood finishing tools were generally unavailable to the Hopi in this era. In order to smooth out the rough carved surfaces, the figures were <b>rubbed</b> <b>smooth</b> with sandstone and the flaws in the cottonwood root were coated with kaolin clay. Their surfaces were not as smooth as in later periods, and the paint was made of non water-resistant mineral and vegetable pigments. The figures in this period were stiff and only meant to be {{hung on the wall}} after ceremonies. Starting around 1900, the figures began to have a more naturalistic look to them {{as a result of the}} white man’s interest and trade. The price of dolls in this period was on average about $0.25 (adjusted for today’s currency).|$|R
6000|$|It is true indeed, {{that within}} the memory of man, there have been {{governors}} of so much dexterity, as to carry points of terrible consequence to this kingdom, by their power with those who were in office, and by their arts in managing or deluding others with oaths, affability, and even with dinners. If Wood's brass had in those times been upon the anvil, it is obvious enough to conceive what methods would have been taken. Depending persons would have been told in plain terms, {{that it was a}} [...] "service expected from them, under pain of the public business being put into more complying hands." [...] Others would be allured by promises. To the country gentleman, besides good words, burgundy and closeting. It would perhaps have been hinted how [...] "kindly it would be taken to comply with a royal patent, though it were not compulsory," [...] that if any inconveniences ensued, it might be made up with other [...] "graces or favours hereafter." [...] That [...] "gentlemen ought to consider whether it were prudent or safe to disgust England:" [...] They would be desired to [...] "think of some good bills for encouraging of trade, and setting the poor to work, some further acts against Popery and for uniting Protestants." [...] There would be solemn engagements that we should [...] "never be troubled with above forty thousand pounds in his coin, and all of the best and weightiest sort, for which we should only give our manufactures in exchange, and keep our gold and silver at home." [...] Perhaps a [...] "seasonable report of some invasion would have been spread in the most proper juncture," [...] which is a great <b>smoother</b> of <b>rubs</b> in public proceedings; and we should have been told that [...] "this was no time to create differences when the kingdom was in danger." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{first stage}} of Mysore Painting was to prepare the ground; paper, wood, cloth or wall grounds were {{variously}} used. The paper board was made of paper pulp or waste paper, which was dried {{in the sun and}} then <b>rubbed</b> <b>smooth</b> with a polished quartz pebble. If the ground was cloth it was pasted on a wooden board using a paste composed of dry white lead (safeda) mixed with gum and a small quantity of gruel (ganji). The board was then dried and burnished. Wood surfaces were prepared byapplying dry white lead, yellow ochre and gum, and walls were treated with yellow ochre, chalk and gum. After preparation of the ground a rough sketch of the picture was drawn with crayon prepared from the straight twigs of the tamarind tree. The next step was to paint the furthest objects such as sky, hill and river and then gradually animal and human figures were approached in greater detail. After colouring the figures, the artists would turn to elaboration of the faces, dress and ornaments including the gesso work (gold covering), which is an important feature of Mysore painting.|$|R
