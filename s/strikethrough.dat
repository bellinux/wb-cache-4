50|$|In {{the novel}} two {{narratives}} are intertwined. In one, we read of the difficulties, fears and trepidations {{that surround the}} meeting of a young couple in modern day Iran {{at a time when}} gender separation is forcefully imposed on society. Scene by scene we become more familiar with the struggles they face in preserving their love and the creative schemes they contrive to lessen the risk of discovery and arrest. In a parallel storyline, Mandanipour enters as his own alter ego and takes us along as he composes each sentence and scene, revealing his frustrations and his methods of battling against censorship. The sentences that the writer self-censors appear as <b>strikethroughs</b> in the text. The writer’s comical efforts at surmounting censorship and advancing his story resemble the struggles of the young lovers to preserve their love.|$|R
40|$|The {{uncoated}} side of dispersion-barrier-coated paperboards {{was exposed}} to positive and negative direct current corona treatments in order to confirm the occurrence of backside treatment and clarify its effects on the usability of the paperboard. The main component of the coating dispersions was hydroxypropylated potato starch {{and the effects of}} talc and styrene-butadiene latex additions on backside treatment were evaluated. Coatings with a high talc proportion showed excellent initial grease resistance, but corona-induced <b>strikethroughs</b> caused a drastic decrease in grease penetration time. The root-mean-square roughness measurements revealed moderate surface roughening at the backside, indicating thus backside treatment. The alterations in surface free energies and rapeseed oil contact angles confirmed the occurrence of backside treatment. The high polarization potential of latex {{played a key role in}} these observations. At the same time, the inertity of talc had a stabilizing effect but it did not prevent backside treatment completely. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results verified that backside treatment occurs also when the barrier-coated side of the substrate is treated with corona, indicating that a dispersion coating layer does not prevent this undesired phenomenon. Bearing in mind that expressing customized information or including personalized elements in food packages or disposable cups and plates is under great interest, it can be assumed the exposure of packaging materials to corona will become more common in the near future, and the need for optimizing bio-based packaging materials for such purposes is obvious.

40|$|Elegant, yet {{possibly}} draft copy (müsvedde / مسوده, see inscriptions on pp. 1 and 2), of a {{brief history}} by Katip Mustafa Zühtü (Kātib Muṣṭafá Zuhdī) addressing Ottoman military campaigns against the Habsburg Empire, namely the campaigns of Köprülüzade Fazıl Ahmed Paşa (d. 1676), including the taking of the fortress of Nové Zámky (Uyvar) in 1073 (24 Dhū al-Ḥijjah 1073 / 30 July 1663). Appears to include the text of Tarih-i Uyvar (compare Istanbul University TY 2488). Origin: Lacks dated colophon; İsmail Paşa claims in Īḍāḥ al-maknūn (Keşfe'l-zunun zeyli) that Katip Mustafa completed the composition in 1070 [1659 or 60] but material addressed in the text suggests a dating after 1663 (see p. 35, etc.); paper certainly suggests 17 th century. Accompanying materials: Torn scrap with depiction of pyramid and Sphinx at Giza in gold {{on one side and}} text in Greek on the other side (paginated pp. 135 - 136). Former shelfmark: "۳۲۳" inscribed in ink in label on upper cover; " 78 T. De M. [i. e. Tammaro De Marinis]" inscribed in pencil on recto of front flyleaf. Binding: Pasteboards (quite thin, semi-limp) covered in dark red-brown leather with recycled paper and linen repair over spine (possibly to reattach upper cover, now detached from textblock with spine leather visible underneath); Type III binding (without flap); board linings (doublures) in an elegant marbled paper (mainly in blue, pink, orange, light green, etc.), hinges in a different marbled paper; upper and lower covers carry stamped and gold-painted lozenge-shaped central ornament and tooled border; sewn in light pink and blue thread, two stations; overall in somewhat poor condition with abrasion, staining, etc. Support: European laid paper; mainly with 9 laid lines per cm. (horizontal), chain lines spaced 25 - 27 mm. apart (vertical), and watermark of paschal lamb in four-lobed circle watermark (see p. 2, 32, 96, etc. and compare Piccard inv. J 340 /no. 86802 / Venice 1662 and Heawood 2840 / Verona 1678, and "agneau pascal" marks nos. 1 - 24 / 1635 - 1670 in Velkov, Les filigranes dans les documents ottomans), burnished, sturdy and mainly cream in color with some leaves tinted pale pink; flyleaves and occasional leaves within the gatherings (carrying text in the same hand) with 6 laid lines per cm. (horizontal), chain lines spaced 26 - 27 mm. apart (vertical), and watermark of crown-star-crescent (80 mm. long parallel to chains, see front flyleaf, p. 16, 134, etc.). Decoration: Keywords chrysographed; section headings rubricated; excerpts from Qurʼān, etc. overlined in red; written area surrounded by gold frame defined by black fillets; textual dividers in the form of gold discs and red inverted commas (in threes). Script: Dīvānī and naskh; elegant hand; serifs, looped descenders and many letterforms characteristic of dīvānī script, freely though not excessively ligatured with effect of words descending to baseline; extensively vocalized; Qurʼānic passages, etc. in naskh. Layout: Written in 13 lines per page; frame-ruled. Collation: ii, III+ 5 (11), 6 V(71), I+ 1 (74), V (84); chiefly quinions; final leaves left blank; a few lacuna for rubricated headings, etc., in one case empty written area crossed through with red ink, see pp. 137 - 138; catchwords present; pagination in pencil, Western numerals, supplied during digitization.
