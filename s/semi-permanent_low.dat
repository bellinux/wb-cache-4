5|$|The Chaco Low is a <b>semi–permanent</b> <b>low</b> {{pressure}} system situated {{east of the}} Andes that is approximately located between 20oS and 30oS during summer (displaced to the north in winter). It is stronger in the summer than in winter due {{to a combination of}} high insolation, dry surface conditions, and southward displacement of the South Atlantic and South Pacific High (this makes it difficult for cold fronts to enter at lower latitudes). The Chaco Low interacts with the South Atlantic High, generating a pressure gradient that draws moist air from the northeast to coastal and central regions of Argentina. It also forces easterly winds from the Amazon basin to move southward, which is reinforced by the funneling effect from both the Andes and the Brazilian Plateau. The Chaco Low brings large amounts of moisture that favour the development of convective thunderstorms during summer, reaching as far south as 35oS. This movement of air from the north owing to the interaction between the Chaco Low and the South Atlantic high is the strongest in summer when the Chaco Low is at its strongest. These winds bring hot, humid tropical air from the north. Sustained and intense winds from the north are responsible for severe weather events such as heat waves and severe convection. During winter, the Chaco Low weakens as a result of lower insolation. This is partly responsible for the decrease in winter precipitation over much of Argentina (in addition to northward displacement of westerlies) due to a weaker transport of air masses from the tropics. This excludes areas south of 40oS where it is dominated by westerlies.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} improve the water {{situation}} in rural areas of Bangladesh, a research group at the University of Dhaka has been developing low cost domestic methods to remove pathogens from surface water through pasteurisation using free solar energy. Pasteurisation is {{a process in which}} water is heated to approximately 60 °C and maintained for about 30 minutes to destroy pathogens. In these methods, the water is also exposed to UV-light from the sunshine, which causes destruction of diarrhoeal pathogens at temperatures somewhat lower than required in normal pasteurisation. However, despite many advantages these devices need to be installed for each time of use. Recently, a semi-permanent device has been developed which is expected to be more user friendly. The objective of this Master thesis has been to study and optimize the low cost semi-permanent device that can deliver safe drinking water to people in rural areas. Two test devices were constructed to determine the most effective treatment e. g. temperature, time, solar radiation, user-friendliness and cost. To replicate the results from the solar heating tests a model, based on the solar radiation and convective heat loss from the device, was used. The model was also able to determine the time duration at a certain solar radiation level to estimate when the water is safe to drink. The results revealed that the performance of the device depends on thickness of the insulation and thickness of the air gap. This is because the most important factors to achieve safe drinking water are solar radiation and time. The modelling indicated that the measured water temperature corresponds well with the calculated water temperature and also showed that the lowest required solar radiation is 390 W/m 2 to reach drinking water criteria, at an air temperature of 25 °C. A study of microbiology showed that the <b>semi-permanent</b> <b>low</b> cost device could purify surface water to a safe level...|$|E
50|$|It {{was very}} hard work because the track was made through very rugged {{mountain}} topography with numerous narrow ravines. These streams {{are located in the}} provincial water reserve Pampa de Achala, the source of many streams, permanent and <b>semi-permanent,</b> of <b>low</b> flow, tributaries of the rivers Condoritos, De la Sole, San Bernardo, Nono and Mina Clavero.|$|R
40|$|The {{mesoscale}} atmospheric flow {{response to}} Greenland {{is difficult to}} predict. Flow over and around Greenland is affected by (i) the large and very steep elevation change between the coastal margins and the central plateau (3000 m), (ii) the combination of very rough surfaces (roughness length zo 1 - 10 m) and jagged mountains around the coasts, (iii) the strong katabatic flows from the plateau down to the coasts (van den Broeke and Gallee 1996), (iv) {{the presence of the}} <b>semi-permanent</b> Icelandic <b>Low,</b> and (v) air-sea-ice interaction processes (Scorer 1988) ...|$|R

50|$|The coastal levee is {{the result}} of the {{accumulation}} of sediments of the Parana River on the shore; it is low rise, not higher than the 3 meter canyon, and is bounded on the east by the river and on the west by residual lagoons from former water channels. Its width does not exceed 250 meters, while the built portion covers about 600 meters long. Some fields are cultivated in the <b>low</b> <b>semi-permanent</b> floodplains.|$|R
50|$|The Icelandic <b>Low</b> is a <b>semi-permanent</b> {{centre of}} <b>low</b> {{atmospheric}} pressure found between Iceland and southern Greenland and extending in the Northern Hemisphere winter into the Barents Sea. In summer it weakens and splits into two centres, one near Davis Strait {{and the other}} west of Iceland. It is a principal centre of action in the atmosphere circulation of the Northern Hemisphere, associated with frequent cyclone activity. It forms one pole of the North Atlantic oscillation, the other being the Azores High.|$|R
50|$|A notable {{exception}} to this pattern is that subarctic climates occurring at high altitudes in otherwise temperate regions have extremely high precipitation due to orographic lift. Mount Washington, with temperatures typical of a subarctic climate, receives an average rain-equivalent of 101.91 in of precipitation per year. Coastal areas of Khabarovsk Krai also have much higher precipitation in summer due to orographic influences (up to 175 mm in July in some areas), whilst the mountainous Kamchatka peninsula and Sakhalin island are even wetter since orographic moisture {{is not confined to}} the warmer months and creates large glaciers in Kamchatka. Labrador, in eastern Canada, is similarly wet throughout the year due to the <b>semi-permanent</b> Icelandic <b>Low</b> and can receive up to 1300 mm of rainfall equivalent per year, creating a snow cover of up to 1.5 m that does not melt until June.|$|R
40|$|Quantitative {{determination}} of biogenic silica in Late Cretaceous and Paleogene deep-sea sediment cores {{from the central}} Arctic Ocean provides evidence of open-ocean polar upwelling. The timing of polar upwelling coincides with periods of a weakened meridional thermal gradient, suggesting that heat transport to the poles by oceanic circulation may have been important. The timing of biogenic silica deposition in the Arctic precedes its deposition in both the Norwegian-Greenland Sea of the North Atlantic and the Bering Sea of the North Pacific. Tectonic events {{may be responsible for}} the timing and siting of sites of deposition of biogenic silica in high northern latitudes, particularly the tectonic evolution of sites of deep-water exchange between the Arctic and the world ocean. We outline three phases in the post-mid-Cretaceous history of silica deposition in high northern latitudes. During Phase I, the Arctic is a silica sink, with deep-water formation but with no deep-water outflow. The transition to Phase II is brought about by opening of the Svalbard-Greenland Strait to deep-water outflow from the Arctic to the Norwegian-Greenland Sea. The transition to Phase III is initiated by submergence of the Faroe-Iceland Ridge and deep-water outflow from the Arctic to the North Atlantic. Climatic conditions in the Arctic during Late Cretaceous and Paleogene time are predicted to have favored open-ocean upwelling due to a circulation pattern dominated by cyclonic conditions, resulting from the establishment of a <b>semi-permanent</b> atmospheric <b>low</b> over the Alpha Ridge. Bathymetry of the Alpha Ridge may have intensified paleo-upwelling...|$|R
40|$|Refugee {{camps are}} {{normally}} {{intended to provide}} a temporary shelter for refugees. In the Palestinian case, after more than 60 years, 58 official refugee camps still exist. The longevity of encampment {{is related to the}} absence of a solution to the refugee problem created during the war over Palestine in 1948, and the establishment of the state of Israel. In this context the United Nations Relief and Works Agency in the Near East (UNRWA) was established in 1949 with a temporary humanitarian mandate to assist and rehabilitate the refugees. Tented camps were set up as an emergency response to the war. The camps have since developed, and often appear as overcrowded, densely built parts of urban areas. Camps, however, are contested and politicised sites. They have {{played an important role in}} Palestinian identity and politics, and for everyday life over four generations. UNRWA’s practices and policies regarding the refugee camps and shelters have been given little attention in scholarly work. This thesis explores the use of long-term humanitarian assistance in a highly political context by studying UNRWA’s relation to the refugee camps over more than sixty years. The focus is on UNRWA and the role it has played through building, planning, rebuilding, rehabilitating and defining camps and shelters in the wake of wars, destruction and during times of relative calm. Main questions of inquiry are how UNRWA’s relation to the camps has changed over time, and how the notion of the camps’ temporariness has influenced UNRWA’s approaches to shelters and camps. What other factors shaped its practices? And what consequences – unintended and intended – can be identified from these practices? The thesis is based on unique access to UNRWA’s own archives. It shows how UNRWA’s relation to the camps and shelters was pragmatic, constrained and ambivalent. Camps and shelters were built as temporary sites at low standards, but with an implicit and pragmatic potential for long-term existence. Such assistance in the absence of political solutions raises the dilemma of choosing between the provision of necessary, urgent and needed assistance, and laying the ground for <b>semi-permanent</b> solutions at <b>low</b> standards. UNRWA had to make difficult choices concerning its practices and policies towards the camps, and over time the assistance would largely be marginalised short term-relief. Further, the exploration of UNRWA’s relation to the camps shows that the agency has been both powerful and powerless. Due to a number of reasons, UNRWA both came to loose control of the camps, and consciously withdrew from the camps as they became increasingly politicised. The first part of the thesis is mainly concerned with UNRWA, camps and shelters in the aftermath of the wars in 1948 and 1967. Unofficial camps and the establishment of some of UNRWA’s out-of-camp projects are also explored. The second part of the thesis explores UNRWA’s relation to the camps after they were all built, and under Israeli occupation on the West Bank, Jerusalem and in Gaza from around 1970 until 2012. </p...|$|R
