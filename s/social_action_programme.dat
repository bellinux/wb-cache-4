40|$|There is a {{long and}} rich {{tradition}} in policy research {{that focuses on the}} relationship between the roles of social policy – also referred to as the social objectives, goals, aims or purposes of policy- and policies themselves. In particular the Social Policy literature has focused on the importance of the link between social values such as equality, need, citizenship, social integration and policies themselves. This paper makes two main points about this literature. Firstly, that it has a tendency to over-state the importance of the role played by such values in social policy-making and neglect that played by non-social value justifications. Secondly, the literature underestimates the degree of flux and instability in the roles of social policy over the short and medium terms. The paper draws upon illustrations taken from an on-going research project that focuses on the justifications for policy action contained in EU <b>Social</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Programmes.</b> It concludes by arguing that a fuller understanding of how political actors use and manipulate the relationship between social value and non-socia...|$|R

40|$|The recent {{religious}} {{history of}} Wales {{has been marked}} by a numerically declining religious constituency although this now appears to be stabilising, albeit in difficult circumstances. ‘Traditional’ Nonconformist Christianity appears in crisis, particularly Welsh medium churches and chapels. The historic churches struggle to maintain themselves with diminishing resources and the evangelical sector is increasingly repositioning itself to meet the challenges brought on by deep changes in Welsh economy, society and culture. On most measures Wales is now a secular society which would appear to confirm the arguments of orthodox proponents of the secularization thesis. This article seeks to relate Welsh secularization to this discourse, arguing that economic and material factors and the creation of social as well as religious capital are a neglected area of secularization studies that traditionally focus on measures of belief. Significant socio-economic changes specific to Wales {{go a long way to}} explain both the decline of traditional areas of religious life and contemporary religious adaptation. Furthermore, the field of faith-based <b>social</b> <b>action</b> <b>programmes</b> is expanding in Wales (and elsewhere in the UK) and this raises some interesting questions. Social or structural differentiation is a core element of the orthodox secularization thesis, focussing on the erosion of those social and communal relations that customarily support religion but arguably faith-based social entrepreneurship offers a potential route back to social and communal significance...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent times}} the <b>social</b> <b>action</b> agenda {{has started to}} {{recognise}} young people’s role as active citizens {{with the potential to}} drive social change in a constrained fiscal climate. This has been recognised in Government supported initiatives such as Step Up to Serve’s #iwill campaign and the National Citizen Service (NCS). While these programmes offer a ‘double benefit’ both to individuals and wider society, the programmes’ focus on skills development can mean that <b>social</b> <b>action</b> becomes a set of non-discursive, practical activities, which can leave the value of young people’s voices side-lined. This position paper was designed to contribute to the debate on youth <b>social</b> <b>action</b> by reframing communication about social issues as a transformational form of <b>social</b> <b>action</b> in itself. By extending the current perception of <b>social</b> <b>action</b> beyond its dominant definition, new priorities for the government’s <b>social</b> <b>action</b> agenda are proposed. The focus is re-positioned towards the importance of helping young people to communicate effectively about issues important to them. A mixed method approach was adopted: 100 young people were surveyed who had completed a project with Fixers. 1 Fixers was also used as the best practice example supplemented by findings from a previous independent evaluation of their activities. The findings revealed that a voice as value approach, as adopted by Fixers, has the potential to reinvigorate youth <b>social</b> <b>action</b> by focusing on the potential for all young people to participate effectively in inspiring, formulating and helping to deliver social change, and particularly marginalised young people who are currently underrepresented in traditional <b>social</b> <b>action</b> <b>programmes.</b> The findings also highlight that policy change must start with institutional recognition of the importance of communication as a means of transformation, and institutional support for the meaningful development and expression of voice by young people. To be adopted more widely however, a voice as value approach requires a policy commitment to evidence-based interventions. In order to achieve this, the following recommendations are made to encourage policymakers to: 1. acknowledge the powerful transformative role that communication can play in generating social change when properly facilitated and valued; 2. value the experiences of young people; recognising them as sources of expertise and insight for social change; 3. adopt a long-term strategy for youth <b>social</b> <b>action</b> that empowers young people to provide input into agendas for social change, rather than prescribing the environment or strategies for change; 4. embed diversity and inclusivity in youth <b>social</b> <b>action</b> so that the transformative potential of voice as value is available to as wide a group of people as possible...|$|R

This research project aimed to contribute to theoretical, methodological and policy understandings {{of the changes in}} women's identities in the process of becoming mothers for the first time. It addressed questions central to the Economic and Social Research Council Identities and <b>Social</b> <b>Action</b> research <b>programme</b> objectives: the mutual influence of intra-psychic and social worlds, the negotiation of self in relation to others, the universal and culturally particular, continuity and change, the processes of identification, agency, regulation and positioning in structures and discourses. The research gave equal emphasis to the psychological and social worlds of the participating mothers and aimed to pioneer methods that allow both to be studied as part of the same questions. Aims and objectives of the study were: to contribute to theoretical understandings of women's identities during the transition into motherhood to examine empirically the co-articulation between motherhood and ethnicised, racialised, age-related, kin-related, class and socio-economic status-based, national and gendered identities in first-time mothers to develop innovative qualitative methods appropriate to psycho-social identities research to contribute to community-based professionals' understandings of first-time mothers from diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds to contribute to the programme psycho-social concepts and methods useful to the theorisation of identification in social science identities research Further details about the study are available in the user guide.

40|$|Abstract   This paper {{focuses on}} whether {{individual}} development plans {{as well as}} <b>action</b> <b>programmes</b> are needed. Pupils in need of particular support get {{to be involved in}} an <b>action</b> <b>programme</b> – the school needs to provide any particular support a pupil needs. However, the individual development plan does not substitute the <b>action</b> <b>programme.</b> Thus an <b>action</b> <b>programme</b> as well as an individual development plan will be provided to students in need of particular support. The individual development plan follows the pupil throughout the entire education, regardless of whether its content changes, whilst the <b>action</b> <b>programme</b> pertains to a limited period of time. Pupils that are not in need of particular support are not likely to need to set goals for themselves in addition to those already set outside of school. An <b>action</b> <b>programme</b> is primarily concerned with affecting the conditions under which the pupils carry out their work.   The results of my study indicate that the individual development plan is yet another duty on part of the teachers, but with exceptionally scarce repayment. According to teachers at the school explored, the individual development plan generates little or no progress for pupils already involved in an <b>action</b> <b>programme.</b> A thoroughly crafted <b>action</b> <b>programme</b> is sufficient, according to teachers participating in the study. A pupil not in need of particular support will not need the individual development plan either, according to the teachers – it would merely be another paper to look at during development talks, but it would not benefit the pupil or the teacher...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reflects}} on {{one example of}} knddowledge transfer conducted by the ESRC Identities and <b>Social</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Programme</b> which involved briefing Tony Blair for his December 2006 speech on multiculturalism and extremism. Two key themes in the report prepared for Blair and his speech-writer are described — the nature of contemporary complex multicultures and the `fragility' of white English identities. These are contrasted with themes in Blair's speech which, in general, celebrated (white) British national character and took a traditional `divided communities' perspective on UK multiculturalism while introducing further measures to encourage `integration'. The paper describes the dilemmas and challenges faced in formulating a report for this context, in particular issues about developing a narrative in a highly contested field, complicity with power and credentials to speak. It argues, too, that although ostensibly an exceptional opportunity, more mundane acts of knowledge transfer might be more effective...|$|E
