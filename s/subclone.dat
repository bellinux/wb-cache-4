Revealing that <b>subclones</b> are not rare in B-cell lymphoma cell lines, 6 / 49 IG hypermutated cell lines (12 %) consisted of <b>subclones</b> with individual IG mutations. <b>Subclones</b> were also identified in 2 / 284 leukemia/lymphoma cell lines exhibiting bimodal CD marker expression. We successfully isolated 10 <b>subclones</b> from four cell lines (HG 3, SU-DHL- 5, TMD- 8, U- 2932).

Methods In this study, we isolated and established high invasive <b>subclones</b> and low invasive <b>subclones</b> from human cervical cancer cell lines HeLa and SiHa by the limited dilution method. Real-time q-RT-PCR, Western Blot and ICC were performed to investigate SPARC mRNA and protein expressions in high invasive <b>subclones</b> and low invasive <b>subclones.</b> Then lentivirus vector with SPARC shRNA was constructed and infected the highly invasive <b>subclones.</b> Real-time q-RT-PCR, Western Blot and ICC were also performed to investigate the changes of SPARC expression after viral infection. In functional assays, effects of SPARC knockdown on the biological behaviors of cervical cancer cells were investigated. The mechanisms of SPARC in cervical cancer proliferation, apoptosis and invasion were also researched. Results SPARC was over-expressed in the highly invasive <b>subclones</b> compared with the low invasive <b>subclones.</b> Knockdown of SPARC significantly suppressed cervical cancer cell proliferation, and induced cell cycle arrest at the G 1 /G 0 phase through the p 53 /p 21 pathway, also caused cell apoptosis accompanied by the decreased ratio of Bcl- 2 /Bax, and inhibited cell invasion and metastasis accompanied by down-regulated MMP 2 and MMP 9 expressions and up-regulated E-cadherin expression.

40|$|One {{means of}} testing a {{candidate}} gene for {{involvement in the}} metastatic process is to alter the expression of that gene in a tumor cell and then to test the metastatic potential of the altered cells.

Thus, selection of a clone itself might skew the results if only a few clones are evaluated. Furthermore, the use of pooled populations after transfection must be considered with caution because the population may contain cells with a variety of metastatic potentials. To avoid these problems, it is necessary to do a preliminary experiment in which the chosen parental cell is <b>subcloned</b> and the <b>subclones</b> are tested for metastatic behavior.

This conclusion is based on a pronounced restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) detected upon hybridization with internal fragments of eight resident insertion sequences (IS). Genetic diversity was dependent on the IS considered and, in many cases, a clear consequence of IS transposition. IS 5 was particularly active in the generation of variation. All <b>subclones</b> in which IS 30 had been active testify to a burst of IS 30 transposition. This was correlated with a loss of prototrophy and a reduced growth on rich media.

The M 1 inv+ <b>subclone</b> was previously reported to be efficiently internalized by human epithelial cells. This potential was confirmed and expanded by comparing a variety of clinical isolates. The capacity for high-frequency invasion of epithelial cells was not transmitted to a laboratory strain of group A streptococci by the above-mentioned bacteriophages...|$|E
40|$|To {{identify}} {{possible explanations}} for the recent global emergence of Escherichia coli sequence type (ST) 131 (ST 131), we analyzed temporal trends within ST 131 O 25 for antimicrobial resistance, virulence genes, biofilm formation, and theH 30 andH 30 -Rx <b>subclones.</b> For this, we surveyed theWHO E. coli and Klebsiella Centre’s E. coli collection (1957 to 2011) for ST 131 isolates, characterized them extensively, and assessed them for temporal trends. Overall, antimicrobial resistance increased temporally in prevalence and extent, due mainly to the recent appearance of theH 30 (1997) andH 30 -Rx (2005) ST 131 <b>subclones.</b> In contrast, neither the total virulence gene content nor the prevalence of biofilm production increased temporally, although non-H 30 iso-lates increasingly qualified as extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC). Whereas virotype D occurred from 1968 forward, viro-types A and C occurred only after 2000 and 2002, respectively, in association with theH 30 andH 30 -Rx <b>subclones,</b> which were characterized by multidrug resistance (including extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase [ESBL] production:H 30 -Rx) and absence of biofilm production. Capsular antigen K 100 occurred exclusively amongH 30 -Rx isolates (55 % prevalence). Pulsotypes corre-sponded broadly with <b>subclones</b> and virotypes. Thus, ST 131 should be regarded not as a unitary entity but {{as a group of}} distinc-tive <b>subclones,</b> with its increasing antimicrobial resistance having a strong clonal basis, i. e., the emergence of theH 30 and H 30 -Rx ST 131 <b>subclones,</b> rather than representing acquisition of resistance by diverse ST 131 strains.

40|$|We have {{recently}} reported that viral DNA sequences in inbred LSH hamster brain cells {{transformed by the}} GS variant of BK virus (LSH-BR-BK) are present predominantly in a free form (Beth et al., J. Virol. 40 : 276 - 284, 1981). In this report, we confirm {{that the presence of}} viral DNA sequences in these cells is not due to virus production, since viral capsid proteins were not detected by immunoprecipitation. Furthermore, we examined the status of viral DNA in 15 <b>subclones</b> of this cell line and detected free and integrated viral DNA sequences in only 5 of the <b>subclones.</b> The other 10 <b>subclones</b> contained exclusively integrated viral DNA sequences, as shown by the blot hybridization of high-molecular-weight cell DNA which was uncleaved or digested with HincII, for which there are no sites in viral DNA. The arrangement of viral DNA in these clones was further analyzed by cleavage of cellular DNA with HpaII and HindIII. Mitomycin (0. 03 microgram/ml) treatment of <b>subclones</b> containing only integrated sequences resulted in the appearance of free viral DNA sequences in some of these cells. This result supports the postulation that free viral DNA in LSH-BR-BK cells is made up of excision products of observed tandemly repeated integrated sequences. In addition to the large T- and small t-antigens, LSH-BR-BK and all of its 15 <b>subclones</b> contained two antigen species which were larger than large T and one species which was smaller than small t. The number of tumor antigens in the LSH- BR-BK cell line and its <b>subclones</b> with a large copy number in a free form was not more than in the <b>subclones</b> with low copy number and integrated DNA. This suggests that free viral DNA is not a template for tumor antigen production in transformed cells...|$|R
