25|$|Most {{internal}} combustion engines use a <b>split</b> <b>collet</b> to hold both the inlet and exhaust valves under constant valve spring pressure which returns the valves to their closed position when the camshaft lobes {{are not in}} contact with the top of the valves. The two collet halves have an internal raised rib which locate into a circular groove near the top of each valve stem, the outer side of the collet halves are a taper fit into the spring retainer (also known as a collar), this taper locks the retainer in place and the raised rib that sits in the circular groove on the valve stem also locks the collet halves in place to the valve stem. To remove the valves from a cylinder head a 'valve spring compressor' is used to compress the valve springs by exerting force on the spring retainer which allows the collets to be removed, when the compressor is removed, the retainer, spring and valve can then be removed from the cylinder head. It may be realized that the retainer does not budge when the valve spring compressor is used, this is due to a buildup of carbon which over time has locked the retainer and collets slightly. A slight sharp tap on the backside of the valve spring compressor above the valve stem should free the retainer allowing the springs to be compressed whilst retrieving the <b>split</b> <b>collet.</b> On reassembly it is difficult to keep the split collets in place whilst the compressor is released, by applying a small amount of grease to the internal side of the split collets will keep them in place on the valve stem whilst releasing the compressor, then as the spring retainer rises it locks the tapered split collets in place.|$|E
40|$|A tool {{makes it}} {{possible}} to couple a torque wrench to an externally knurled, internally threaded, round cable connector. The purpose served by the tool is to facilitate the tightening of multiple such connectors (or the repeated tightening of the same connector) to repeatable torques. The design of a prior cable-connector/ torque-wrench coupling tool provided for application of the torque-wrench jaws to a location laterally offset from the axis of rotation of the cable connector, making it necessary to correct the torque reading for the offset. Unlike the design of the prior tool, the design of the present tool provides for application of the torque-wrench jaws to a location on the axis of rotation, obviating correction of the torque reading for offset. The present tool (see figure) consists of a <b>split</b> <b>collet</b> containing a slot that provides clearance for inserting and bending the cable, a collet-locking sleeve, a collet-locking nut, and a torque-wrench adaptor that is press-fit onto the collet. Once the collet is positioned on the cable connector, the collet-locking nut is turned to force the collet-locking sleeve over the collet, compressing the collet through engagement of tapered surfaces {{on the outside of the}} collet and the inside of the locking sleeve. Because the collet is split and therefore somewhat flexible, this compression forces the collet inward to grip the connector securely. The torque wrench is then applied to the torque-wrench adaptor in the usual manner for torquing a nut or a bolt...|$|E
50|$|Twin {{overhead}} camshafts {{carried in}} split housings on the fixed cylinder head and operate the sixteen valves through thimble tappets. Four valves per cylinder 60 degrees asymmetrically inclined (inlet 20 degrees and outlet 40 degrees from vertical). The double valve springs secured by <b>split,</b> tapered <b>collets</b> and collar.|$|R
40|$|The {{modification}} of the Siemens electron microscope grid-holder suggested by Elbers (1) among its other advantages reduces contamination by reducing {{the handling of the}} specimen holder either with the fingers or using paper tissue or other fabrics. By using the set of collets described here such handling is entirely eliminated although the operations involved in changing the specimen may still be made easily. Received for publication, June 22, 1960. Figs. 1 to 10 on the facing page show the sequence of operations on extracting the holder from the microscope and dismantling for a specimen change. The specimen holder shown is the type which receives 3 mm. diameter grids. Both the collet tools are made from phosphor-bronze and terminate at each end as <b>split</b> <b>collets,</b> except for the threaded portion A (Fig. 11) which is a standard item supplied with the microscope. Use of the threaded tool as described above still allow...|$|R
