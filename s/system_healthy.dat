50|$|A 3-ounce {{serving of}} braised beef liver has 162 {{calories}} and 24.7 grams of complete protein. Besides, beef liver {{is rich in}} vitamins and minerals. It has {{a rich source of}} vitamin A to keep eyes, skin and immune <b>system</b> <b>healthy.</b> A 3-ounce serving supplies {{more than half of the}} recommended daily allowance of folate and vitamins B-6 and B-12. Folate is especially important for women because it prevents birth defects formed in the first trimester of pregnancy. Vitamin B-6 helps produce serotonin to regulate moods and sleep cycle, and vitamin B-12 is essential for nerves and red blood cells. Also, beef liver is well known as a source of iron. A 3-ounce serving supplies 31 percent of women's and 70 percent of men's recommended daily allowance. Iron is used in producing red blood cells and thus intake more can prevent anemia. Unfortunately, beef liver is very high in cholesterol. In fact, the American Heart Association suggests people to limit their intake of cholesterol to 300 milligrams or less per day, while a simple 3-ounce serving of liver brings in a whopping 330 milligrams of cholesterol. This can lead to long-term heart disease that can result in permanent damage or even death.|$|E

40|$|International audience—This study aims {{to assess}} the impact of inter-turn {{short-circuit}} in stator windings of squirrel cage induction generators on variable-speed wind turbine systems. The short-circuit fault detection is based on a steady-state technique which is Motor Current Signatures Analysis (MCSA). Thus, theoretical developments of both healthy and faulty three-phase squirrel-cage induction generator of the wind turbine system models in the abc-reference frame are made to recognize the current signature variations. Simulation results are carried out to illustrate the severe consequences of inter-turn short-circuit fault on the generator signatures and moreover on the whole system.

40|$|Background: In {{their current}} laboratory-based form, {{existing}} vibrotactile sensory augmentation technologies that provide cues of body motion are impractical for home-based rehabilitation use {{due to their}} size, weight, complexity, calibration procedures, cost, and fragility. Methods: We have designed and developed a cell phone based vibrotactile feedback system for potential use in balance rehabilitation training in clinical and home environments. It comprises an iPhone with an embedded triaxial linear accelerometer, custom software to estimate body tilt, a “tactor bud ” accessory that plugs into the headphone jack to provide vibrotactile cues of body tilt, and a battery. Five young healthy subjects (24 ± 2. 8 yrs, 3 females and 2 males) and four subjects with vestibular deficits (42. 25 ± 13. 5 yrs, 2 females and 2 males) participated in a proof-of-concept study {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of the <b>system.</b> <b>Healthy</b> subjects used the system with eyes closed during Romberg, semi-tandem Romberg, and tandem Romberg stances.

The active form of BlIDH was an 83 -kDa homodimer. Kinetic analysis showed BlIDH was a NADP+-dependent IDH (NADP-IDH), with a 567 - and 193 -fold preference for NADP+ over NAD+ in the presence of Mg 2 + and Mn 2 +, respectively. The maximal activity for BlIDH occurred at 60 °C (with Mn 2 +) and 65 °C (with Mg 2 +), and pH 7. 5 (with Mn 2 +) and pH 8. 0 (with Mg 2 +). Heat-inactivation profiles revealed that BlIDH retained 50 % of maximal activity after incubation at 45 °C for 20 min with either Mn 2 + or Mg 2 +. Furthermore, the coenzyme specificity of BlIDH can be completely reversed from NADP+ to NAD+ by a factor of 2387 by replacing six residues. This current work, the first report on the coenzyme specificity conversion of Type II NADP-IDHs, would provide better insight into the evolution of NADP+ use by the IDH family...|$|E
