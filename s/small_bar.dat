5|$|After {{twenty years}} of career struggles and obscurity, Thelonious Monk had become a jazz star with a {{residency}} at the Five Spot Café in New York City's East Village. In his first stable job in years, he helped transform the <b>small</b> <b>bar</b> {{into one of the}} city's most popular venues, as it attracted bohemians, hipsters, and devout fans of Monk's music. His employment there was a result of an appeal by his manager Harry Colomby to the State Liquor Authority (SLA) to restore Monk's cabaret card. Monk was stripped of the card in 1951 when he was convicted of narcotics possession; he had refused to betray his friend and pianist Bud Powell to the police after they discovered Powell's glassine envelope of heroin laying beside Monk's feet in the car of Powell's female companion.|$|E

5|$|The club had a <b>small</b> <b>bar,</b> library, large {{dining and}} dance floor, billiards table, ping pong {{table and a}} two-lane bowling alley, and was the centre of social life on the island for the {{employees}} of the penitentiary.

The club was responsible for organizing numerous special events on the island (held either in the hall or the Parade Grounds) and the fundraising associated with it, anything from ice cream and watermelon feasts to Halloween fancy dress and Christmas parties.|$|E

25|$|The Ravitch {{technique}} is an invasive surgery that {{was introduced in}} 1949 and developed in the 1950s. It involves creating an incision along the chest through which the cartilage is removed and the sternum detached. A <b>small</b> <b>bar</b> is inserted underneath the sternum to hold {{it up in the}} desired position. The bar is left implanted until the cartilage grows back, typically about six months. The bar is subsequently removed in a simple out-patient procedure; this {{technique is}} thus a two-stage procedure.|$|E

25|$|In 1993, Bill Rhodes, {{a former}} Wakefield RFC player left a bequest to the club, {{which led to}} the Rhodes Pavilion, a portakabin {{structure}} being added, functioning as an office and hospitality area for the rugby club. A few years later, a second portakabin structure, the Fleur de Lys pavilion was built above the car park behind the rugby posts at the Smirthwaite end of the ground. This included a viewing balcony together with a kitchen and <b>small</b> <b>bar.</b> In the late 1990s, the rugby club added temporary tip up seating on the hockey side of the rugby field. In 2002, the hockey club replaced the sand-based surface with a state-of-the-art water-based pitch and added a multi use games area suitable for five-a-side football. A Sports Council award of £900,000 to cover the £1,055,000 project financed this.|$|E

25|$|Microphones ("mics") {{are used}} with drums {{to pick up}} the sound of the drums and cymbals for a sound {{recording}} and/or {{to pick up the}} sound of the drum kit {{so that it can be}} amplified through a PA system or sound reinforcement system. While most drummers use microphones and amplification in live shows in the 2010s, so that the sound engineer can adjust and balance the levels of the drums and cymbals, some bands that play in quieter genres of music and that play in small venues such as coffeehouses play acoustically, without mics or PA amplification. Small jazz groups such as jazz quartets or organ trios that are playing in a <b>small</b> <b>bar</b> will often just use acoustic drums. Of course if the same small jazz groups play on the mainstage of a big jazz festival, the drums will be mic'ed so that they can be adjusted in the sound system mix. A middle-ground approach is used by some bands that play in small venues; they do not mic every drum and cymbal, but rather mic only the instruments that the sound engineer wants to be able to control in the mix, such as the bass drum and the snare.|$|E
500|$|The {{number of}} {{subwoofer}} enclosures {{used in a}} concert depends {{on a number of}} factors, including the size of the venue, whether it is indoors or outdoors, the amount of low-frequency content in the band's sound, the desired volume of the concert, and the design and construction of the enclosures (e.g., direct-radiating versus horn-loaded. A <b>small</b> <b>bar</b> may use a single direct-radiating 15-inch (40cm) sub cabinet. A large dance club may have a row of four or five twin 18-inch (45cm) subwoofer cabinets, or more). In the largest stadium venues, there may be {{a very large number of}} subwoofer enclosures. For example, the 2009–2010 U2 360° Tour uses 24 Clair Brothers BT-218 subwoofers (a double 18-inch (45cm) box) around the perimeter of the central circular stage, and 72 proprietary Clair Brothers cardioid S4 subwoofers placed underneath the ring-shaped [...] "B" [...] stage which encircles the central main stage.|$|E

2500|$|Guadagnino {{was tempted}} to remove a memorable scene from the novel, in which Elio masturbates with a pitted peach, as he found it was too explicit. Timothée Chalamet was also nervous about the scene, {{describing}} it {{as the key to}} illuminating the character's inner [...] "overabundant sexual energy." [...] Despite their reservations, Guadagnino and Chalamet eventually included the scene in the film. A scene featuring Elio and Oliver's [...] "enthusiastic" [...] dancing to The Psychedelic Furs' [...] "Love My Way" [...] in a <b>small</b> <b>bar</b> is not drawn from the book, but inspired by the time Guadagnino danced by himself in a bedroom when he was young.|$|E

2500|$|In June 1983 (in {{the middle}} of the renovation) George Ellis died {{suddenly}} at age 64. [...] At the memorial service for Ellis, Glenn Sirkis announced that the renovation of the Euclid would continue, but at its planned opening in February 1984 it would be named the Ellis Cinema as a memorial. That date came and went as Sirkis and his wife Jill Kirn spent almost two years completing the renovation. The duplex idea was dropped. The exterior elements of the theater were retained, but the interior was [...] "totally redesigned" [...] with 310 seats, and a series of small mezzanines to accommodate tables and chairs along the outside walls. [...] A <b>small</b> <b>bar</b> provided additional seating in the rear. A [...] screen was built, {{one of the largest in}} Atlanta at that time.
