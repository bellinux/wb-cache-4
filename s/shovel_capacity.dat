5000|$|The West German company {{emphasised}} {{the manufacture}} of railroad cars and construction equipment, particularly excavators. In 1961, O&K manufactured Europe's first series of fully hydraulic excavators. They manufactured over 55,000 hydraulic excavators; more than 700 of those were rated at over 100 tons' service weight. O&K also manufactured the world's largest hydraulic excavator, at 900 tons' service weight with a <b>shovel</b> <b>capacity</b> of over [...] and an engine output of 2,984 kilowatts (4,055 HP).|$|E

50|$|In 1839 William Smith Otis, civil {{engineer}} of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was issued a US patent for the steam shovel (No. 1,089) for excavating and (removing earth). Officially the patent drawing is missing but a drawing exists which {{is said to}} be the one from the patent and this shows the crane mounted on a railroad car. A load of earth could be lifted by the bucket, raised by the crane and turned to be dumped, such as in railcars. The patent described how a steam engine of a type then in ordinary use, was installed with a power control mechanism for the crane, and a system of pulleys to move its arms and bucket. It could move about 380 cubic meters of earth a day, with its 1.1 cubic meter <b>capacity</b> <b>shovel</b> and 180Â° slewing wooden jib. It was first used on the Western Railroad in Massachusetts.|$|R
