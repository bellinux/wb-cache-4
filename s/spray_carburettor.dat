25|$|The company {{developed}} and produced the Rover Imperial motorcycle in November 1902. This was a 3.5hp diamond-framed motorcycle {{with the engine}} in the centre and 'springer' front forks which was ahead of its time. This first Rover motorcycle had innovative features such as a <b>spray</b> <b>carburettor,</b> bottom-bracket engine and mechanically operated valves. With a strong frame with double front down tubes and a good quality finish, over a thousand Rover motorcycles were sold in 1904. The following year, however, Rover stopped motorcycle production to concentrate on their 'safety bicycle' but in 1910 designer John Greenwood was commissioned {{to develop a new}} 3.5hp 500cc engine with spring-loaded tappets, a Bosch magneto and an innovative inverted tooth drive chain. It had a Brown and Barlow carburettor and Druid spring forks. This new model was launched at the 1910 Olympia show and over 500 were sold.|$|E

5000|$|The British and the Russians found {{themselves}} {{on the same side}} in the First World War, both states having ostensibly declared war in support of smaller states attacked by the Austrians or their German allies: the Lanchester armoured cars on the 38 hp chassis proved themselves particularly effective on the Russian front, since their wick carburettors were not clogged up by the Russian fuel {{in the same way as}} conventional <b>spray</b> <b>carburettors</b> used in other British army vehicles. [...] The aftermath of war saw a rapid return for the Lanchester 40, but now George was able to install an overhead camshaft engine, and this set the pattern for the six- and eight-cylinder Lanchester engines which built the company's name between 1919 and 1931. [...] Despite the old name, the post-war Lanchester 40 was in many ways a new car at a time when some competitors were offering little-changed versions of pre-war designs. [...] The Lanchester bodies used aluminium panels: the three-speed epicyclic gear-boxes and cantilever rear springs were, however, familiar from Lanchester's own pre-war designs.|$|R
