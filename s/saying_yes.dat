500|$|Win Butler and Josh Deu founded Arcade Fire in Montreal around 2001, having {{first met}} at Phillips Exeter Academy as high school students. Butler and Deu's musical ideas {{began to develop}} and the first {{incarnation}} of the band was born while they were attending McGill University and Concordia University, respectively. The duo began rehearsing their material at McGill where they met Régine Chassagne, a music student whom they asked to join them. Deu recalls, [...] "Win and I played guitar. Everyone played guitar. We had no music to show her, but she ended up <b>saying</b> <b>yes</b> to joining us, and I don’t know why. Maybe {{there was a little}} spark with Win." [...] The trio recorded a set of demos and began performing live {{in the second half of}} 2001. At that time, the band consisted of Butler, Chassagne, Deu, multi-instrumentalist Tim Kyle (later of Wild Light), bassist Myles Broscoe (later of Les Angles Morts, Crystal Clyffs, and AIDS Wolf), guitarist/drummer Dane Mills (later of Crackpot) and multi-instrumentalist Brendan Reed (later of Les Angles Morts and founding member of Clues), who lived with Butler and Chassagne in Montreal's Mile End neighbourhood at the time and was a collaborator with them on song-writing and arrangement (2001–2003).|$|E

[...] In 2006, she also addressed the rumors that she is an open lesbian by saying, [...] "I never made any kind of statement about my personal life on any level. I never made any proclamations. So I don't know where people are getting that from." ...|$|E

2500|$|During {{his initial}} questioning, Hansen asked Parker {{if he had}} ever sent any mail to the Stanley family. After he responded negatively, Hansen {{produced}} the envelopes and handed them both to Parker. After pointing specifically to the second one, which {{was the one with}} the initials HLP in the upper left corner, Hansen asked if the envelopes had been sent by him or through the office and Parker responded by <b>saying</b> <b>yes.</b> A moment later, Parker decided to take a second look and {{put on a pair of}} reading glasses. This time, he retracted his claim by pointing out the letters were printed by hand onto the envelope and then showed Collins and Hitch, who went along with him; when pressed a second time, Parker said the envelope had not come from him directly saying [...] "...'cause I don't write that way." ...|$|E
2500|$|The character's arrival was {{announced}} by the press in November 1998. She was one of Executive Producer Matthew Robinson's introductions, and {{was described as a}} [...] "home-wrecking blonde". According to actress Lucy Benjamin who played Lisa, the scriptwriters had doubts about casting her in the role: [...] "I just knew in my heart that I'd {{be able to do it}} well. And I desperately wanted the security of a regular income. But after the audition they kept me hanging on for such a long time. They tortured me by <b>saying</b> <b>yes</b> then saying no. It's the only job I've ever cried about when I thought I didn't have it." [...] Benjamin said that she was overjoyed when she was eventually given the part. In 2010, Matthew Robinson discussed Lisa's introduction with Walford Web, suggesting that Lisa and several other new characters introduced were an attempt to fill in character gaps in the soap resulting from a large number of axings. Lisa was conceptualised as a [...] "totty" [...] contingent. He indicated that the casting of Benjamin had been awkward as BBC controller of drama, Mal Young, was hesitant about her hiring. He eventually relented and, according to Robinson, admitted after seeing her in the role that [...] "she was, after all, a great asset to the show".|$|E
2500|$|In March 2010, Shoaib Malik {{was given}} a one-year ban from the {{national}} team by the PCB, who charged him for infighting within the team. It {{was part of a}} dramatic cull of players after Pakistan's winless tour of Australia, resulting in the fining or banning of seven players. Two months later Lancashire County Cricket Club approached Malik to play for them during Twenty20 Cup. He agreed, saying [...] "When Lancashire approached me to come and play for them I didn't hesitate in <b>saying</b> <b>yes.</b> I love playing cricket in England and the opportunity to play with a club of Lancashire's reputation was too good to pass up". On 29 May 2010, Malik's ban was overturned and his Rs2million fine halved. He was subsequently named in the 2010 Asia Cup squad, and as a result, Malik pulled out of his contract with Lancashire. Pakistan did not make the final of the four-team tournament, and Malik played in two matches, amassing 47runs. Mailk was in Pakistan's squad to play Australia and England in England in June–August 2010, but was dropped from the side. A regular in the ODI side, over the previously 12months he had averaged around 30 with the bat in ODIs, and excluding one score over 50, his batting average hovered around 20. Mohsin Khan, Pakistan's chairman of selectors, cited Malik's poor recent form as the reason for dropping him. After Malik's comeback to international cricket in 2015, he {{was an integral part of}} the Pakistan squad who were crowned champions of the ICC Champions Trophy 2017 by defeating arch-rivals India in the final.|$|E
