This {{paper is}} {{essentially}} a discussion of results found in the paper “Two <b>sufficient</b> <b>conditions</b> for a graphic sequence to have a realization with prescribed clique size ” written by Jian-Hua Yin and Jiong-Sheng Li. We first define {{what is meant by}} a graphic sequence, then offer a few necessary and <b>sufficient</b> <b>conditions</b> for a sequence to be graphic. Next we establish some <b>sufficient</b> <b>conditions</b> for sequences to have graphic realizations with prescribed clique sizes, as well as <b>sufficient</b> <b>conditions</b> for realizations that are one edge shy of containing a clique of predetermined size.

Although the method of Wang et al. can find messages that satisfy the <b>sufficient</b> <b>conditions</b> in steps 1 to 20 by using message modification, it {{makes no mention of}} the message modifications needed to yield satisfaction of the <b>sufficient</b> <b>conditions</b> in steps 21 and onwards.

Submarine modification is an extension of the multi-message modification used in collision attacks on the MD-family. Next, we point out that the <b>sufficient</b> <b>conditions</b> given by Wang et al. are not enough to generate a collision with high probability; we rectify this shortfall by introducing two new <b>sufficient</b> <b>conditions.</b> The combination of our newly found <b>sufficient</b> <b>conditions</b> and submarine modification allows us to generate a collision with complexity 2 36 SHA- 0 hash operations.
