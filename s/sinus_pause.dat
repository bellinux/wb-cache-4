5000|$|Sinoatrial arrest (also {{known as}} sinus arrest or <b>sinus</b> <b>pause)</b> {{is a medical}} {{condition}} wherein the sinoatrial node of the heart transiently ceases to generate the electrical impulses that normally stimulate the myocardial tissues to contract and thus the heart to beat. It is defined as lasting from 2.0 seconds to several minutes. Since the heart contains multiple pacemakers, this interruption of the cardiac cycle generally lasts {{only a few seconds}} before another part of the heart, such as the atrio-ventricular junction or the ventricles, begins pacing and restores the heart action. This condition can be detected on an electrocardiogram (ECG) as a brief period of irregular length with no electrical activity before either the sinoatrial node resumes normal pacing, or another pacemaker begins pacing. If a pacemaker other than the sinoatrial node is pacing the heart, this condition is known as an escape rhythm. If no other pacemaker begins pacing during an episode of sinus arrest it becomes a cardiac arrest. This condition is sometimes confused with sinoatrial block, a condition in which the pacing impulse is generated, but fails to conduct through the myocardium. Differential diagnosis of the two conditions is possible by examining the exact length of the interruption of cardiac activity.If the next available pacemaker takes over, it is in the following order: ...|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Carcinoid {{tumors are}} rare neuroendocrine {{malignancies}} that secrete multiple bioactive substances. These bioactive substances {{are responsible for}} the carcinoid syndrome characterized by diarrhea, flushing, syncope, and right-sided valvular heart disease. Previous case reports have described carcinoid syndrome associated with coronary vasospasm and the well-characterized carcinoid heart disease. Case. Our patient is a 73 -year-old female with complex past medical history most notable for metastatic carcinoid tumors diagnosed in 2013 - 05. She initially presented in 2014 - 09 with syncope and dizziness associated with <b>sinus</b> <b>pause</b> on an event monitor. She received a pacemaker given normal left ventricular function and was discharged. However, she was readmitted with similar symptoms corresponding to multiple episodes of ventricular tachycardia. She was started on high-dose beta blockade and has had no recurrence of arrhythmia over a follow-up period of 12 months. Conclusion. We hypothesize that the patient’s ventricular tachycardia was mediated by the multiple bioactive substances secreted by her carcinoid tumors. Her carcinoid tumor biomarkers were elevated and other explanations for arrhythmia were investigated and ruled out. To our knowledge, this is the first case of ventricular tachycardia mediated by carcinoid syndrome and suppressed by beta-blocker. Further investigation into this relationship is needed...|$|E

Sick sinus syndrome, a relatively benign condition, is usually treated with pacemaker implantation without any proved effectiveness. Thus, an appropriate pharmacologic therapy would be useful. Methods. Theophylline (200 to 400 mg/day for 1 month) was initially administered orally to 17 patients with sick sinus syndrome, which is manifested by <b>sinus</b> <b>pauses</b> of > 2. 5 s. Eleven of the 17 patients subsequently received theophylline for an additional 8 to 37 months. Twenty-four-hour Holter recordings were obtained before treatment, at the end of 1 month of treatment and then at 6 -month intervals. Results. Theophylline decreased the frequency of <b>sinus</b> <b>pauses</b> from 256 ± 230 to 23 ± 62 pauses per 24 h and decreased the duration of the longest pauses from 4. 7 ± 1. 8 to 2. 2 ± 0. 97 s after 1 month of treatment Subjective symptoms associated with cardiac pauses disappeared in 16 of 17 patients. Ventricular premature beats increased in frequency but did not last longer than two beats. Three patients experienced adverse effects. Nine of the 11 patients receiving long-term treatment had a good outcome, but 2 patients required a pacemaker because of the resppearance of long <b>sinus</b> <b>pauses.</b> Conclusions.

40|$|A {{dedicated}} nonlinear oscillator model able {{to reproduce}} the pulse shape, refractory time, and phase sensitivity of the action potential of a natural pacemaker of the heart is developed. The phase space of the oscillator contains a stable node, a hyperbolic saddle, and an unstable focus. The model reproduces several phenomena well known in cardiology, such as certain properties of the sinus rhythm and heart block. In particular, the model reproduces the decrease of heart rate variability {{with an increase in}} sympathetic activity. A <b>sinus</b> <b>pause</b> occurs in the model due to a single, well-timed, external pulse just as it occurs in the heart, for example due to a single supraventricular ectopy. Several ways by which the oscillations cease in the system are obtained (models of the asystole).

We evaluated cardiac dysrhythmias with 24 -hour ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring after transcatheter closure of ASD with Amplatzer device. A total of 85 consecutive patients with ASD underwent transcatheter closure of secundum ASD with Amplatzer device between October 1998 and December 2003. The study involved 65 of these patients assessed by 24 -hour ambulatory ECG monitoring. Seven patients were evaluated a second time by 24 -hour monitorization. During the procedure, transient complete atrioventricular (AV) block was seen in two patients. One of them returned to normal sinus rhythm in catheterization lab and the other returned to normal sinus rhythm in two hours. Transient junctional rhythm was observed in another patient during the device placement.

Based on their ECG data before study, patients were subdivided into group A (n = 8), those with <b>sinus</b> <b>pauses</b> and/or sinoatrial (SA) exit block; and group B (n = 8), those with sinus bradycardia. Disopyramide shortened spontaneous cycle length in 10 of 16 patients and lengthened it in six markedly so (91 %) in one patient. Estimated SA conduction time decreased in seven of 14 patients and increased in seven. Two patients developed second degree SA exit block after disopyramide. Maximum sinus node recovery time was prolonged by diso-pyramide in 11 of 16 patients and markedly so in four. For {{the group as a}} whole {{there was no significant difference}} in spontaneous cycle length, maximum sinus node recovery time or estimated SA conduction time.

Methods: Between January 1, 1996, and December 31, 1999, a prospective cohort study was conducted evaluating the incidence of sinus node dysfunction in patients undergoing a bidirectional Glenn or hemi-Fontan procedure and those in whom the Fontan repair was completed with either an extracardiac conduit or a lateral tunnel. Sinus node dysfunction was defined (1) as a heart rate more than 2 SD below age-adjusted norms or (2) as a predominant junctional rhythm and/or a <b>sinus</b> <b>pause</b> of more than 3 seconds as determined by the resting electrocardiogram and/or ambulatory monitoring at hospital discharge. Results: Fifty-one patients had a bidirectional Glenn shunt (mean age 7. 8 ± 5. 1 months) and 79 a hemi-Fontan procedure (mean age 6. 9 ± 2. 8 months). The incidence of sinus node dysfunction on postoperative day 1 was significantly higher after the hemi-Fontan (36 %) than after the bidirectional Glenn shunt (9. 8 %); however, by hospital discharge this difference was no longer apparent (hemi-Fontan [8 %]; bidirectional Glenn [6 %]; P = not significant). No difference in early sinus node dysfunction was discernible after the extracardiac conduit (4 / 30 [13 %]) compared with the lateral tunnel Fontan procedure (6 / 46 [13 %]) (P = not significant). No diagnostic or perioperative variables were predictive of sinus node dysfunction. Conclusions: Avoidance of surgery near the sinus node has no discernible effect on the development of early sinus node dysfunction.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} permanent pacing in cardioinhibitory malignant vasovagal syndrome. PATIENTS AND METHODS [...] 37 patients with permanent pacemakers for cardioinhibitory malignant vasovagal syndrome. All presented with syncope (median six episodes, median frequency two episodes a year) and after conventional investigation and invasive electrophysiological assessment they remained undiagnosed, and without a generally accepted indication for pacemaker implantation. In all vasovagal syncope with cardioinhibition (heart rate at syncope < 60 beats/min) developed during tilt tests performed according to the Westminster protocol (head up tilt at 60 degrees with a footplate support for 45 minutes or until syncope intervenes). Dual chamber pacemakers were implanted in 35 (95 %) and VVI pacemakers in the remaining two (5 %). RESULTS [...] Over a mean (SD) follow up since implantation of 50. 2 (23. 9) months symptomatic improvement occurred in 89 %: 62 % remained free of syncope and 27 % were completely symptom free. The collective syncopal burden of these 37 patients was reduced from 136 to 11 episodes each year. During follow up three patients died from unrelated causes. Patients who become asystolic during the tilt test (<b>sinus</b> <b>pause</b> of at least four seconds) experienced no greater benefit from pacing than those with less extreme cardioinhibition. Patients who remained free of syncope since implantation were younger than those who continued to experience syncope. Patients who remained completely symptom free after implantation were younger, {{more likely to be}} male, and had had fewer syncopal episodes before implantation than those who continued to experience syncope or presyncope. No other demographic, clinical, investigative, or pacing variable suggested a more favourable outcome after implant. CONCLUSIONS [...] This retrospective and uncontrolled experience suggests a possible role for permanent pacing in selected patients with cardioinhibitory malignant vasovagal syndrome. Improved acquisition of tilt test data may enable better selection of patients who are suitable for permanent pacing. A randomised prospective study to compare permanent pacing with no treatment or with medical treatment in cardioinhibitory malignant vasovagal syndrome is indicated...|$|E
40|$|Senile {{systemic}} amyloidosis {{is caused by}} a non-mutated form of transthyretin with the heart being the major organ involved. This infiltrative cardiomyopathy usually presents as slowly progressive heart failure. An 82 -year-old female patient was admitted for newly diagnosed heart failure. A year later she presented with decompensated heart failure and syncope. Inpatient work-up showed persistently elevated troponin and N-terminal-pro BNP levels, rapid progression to severe left ventricular concentric hypertrophy, and <b>sinus</b> <b>pauses</b> on the Holter. Cardiac MRI revealed diffuse late gadolinium enhancement in the left ventricle. The demonstration of amyloid protein with the clinical findings and complementary investigations allowed for the diagnosis of senile {{systemic amyloidosis}}...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Rhythm {{disturbances}} are {{an important}} cause of morbidity in Fontan patients. Currently, the total cavopulmonary connection is performed by using the intra-atrial lateral tunnel (ILT) ('baffle ILT' or 'prosthetic ILT'), or the extracardiac conduit (ECC). The aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate rhythm abnormalities and compare the surgical techniques in a contemporary cohort.   METHODS: In a cross-sectional multicentre study, 115 patients (age 12. 5 ± 3. 1 years) underwent rhythm evaluation using ECG, exercise testing and Holter, including heart rate variability. Medical history was reviewed for episodes of arrhythmia.   RESULTS: Sinus node dysfunction (SND) was found in 29 %, 3 of whom required pacemaker therapy. No difference was found in the incidence of SND between ILT and ECC patients. <b>Sinus</b> <b>pauses</b> occurred only in the ILT group. Exercise testing showed no difference in peak heart rate between the groups. Heart rate reserve (P = 0. 023) and heart rate recovery (HRrecovery) (P < 0. 001) were lower in ILT patients. Atrial arrhythmias were more common in ILT patients (15 vs 1 %, P = 0. 004), but only in those with a baffle ILT. One patient had symptomatic ventricular tachycardia (VT). Holter recordings showed sub-clinical VT in 6 % of patients, which was associated with larger end-diastolic (P = 0. 035) and end-systolic volumes (P = 0. 029).   CONCLUSIONS: The overall incidence of arrhythmia was low, although SND was frequently present in both Fontan groups. ILT patients had slower HRrecovery, and ILT patients with the more extensive baffle technique had more atrial arrhythmias and more <b>sinus</b> <b>pauses.</b> The significance of asymptomatic ventricular arrhythmias in this young population remains to be determined...|$|R
