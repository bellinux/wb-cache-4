The Hoboken Terminal remained closed until October 10, when a limited number of platforms were reopened with a modified <b>service</b> <b>schedule.</b> Full service was not restored until October 17; Tracks 5 and 6, where the train crashed, remained closed while repairs were carried out.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{equipment}} {{rotation and}} maintenance concerns, Caltrain said in 2009 {{that it could}} not dedicate cars with higher bike capacity on trains with high bike demand. Many of you have written to ask a series of questions about this new effort: Why can’t we provide two bike cars on every train? Why can’t we provide two bike cars on my train? Why can’t we provide two bike cars on the most heavily used trains? Why is there only one bike car on trains that are supposed to have two bike cars? The simplest answer to most of these questions is that we don’t have enough bike cars to put two on every train, or even on every peak train, and, in doing all we can to expand service for our cycling customers, we have to be mindful of the impact of these changes on our entire system and all of our customers, particularly on on-time performance. All of our cars, not just our bike cars, serve our entire schedule throughout our entire day, which means they rotate through the schedule, and also must be rotated out of service for fueling, washing, maintenance and federally mandated safety and operational inspections. A train set that starts its day in San Jose may finish its day in Millbrae and be cycled to San Francisco for its daily maintenance and to begin the next day at the San Francisco station. Because of this rotation – because of the demands of our entire <b>service</b> <b>schedule</b> – we can’t guarantee that a specific stop on the schedule will have a specific train.}} Eventually, two bike cars were added to every train consist by 2011, and in 2016, a third bike car was added to Bombardier consists.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{computational}} and modeling issues involved with developing solutions for distributed <b>service</b> <b>scheduling</b> problems. Compared with traditional manufacturing <b>scheduling,</b> <b>service</b> <b>scheduling</b> poses additional challenges {{due to the}} significant customer involvement in service processes. The first challenge is that the <b>service</b> <b>scheduling</b> environment is a distributed environment in which scheduling-related information is scattered among individual identities, such as service providers and customers. The second challenge is that the <b>service</b> <b>scheduling</b> environment is a dynamic environment. Uncertainty in customer demand, customer cancellations and no-shows make the <b>scheduling</b> of <b>services</b> a complex dynamic process. <b>Service</b> <b>scheduling</b> has to be robust and prepared to accommodate any contingencies caused by customer involvement in service production. The third challenge concerns customers’ private information. To compute optimal schedules, ideally, the scheduler should know the complete customer availability and preference information within the scheduling horizon. However, customers may act strategically to protect their private information. Therefore, <b>service</b> <b>scheduling</b> systems should be designed {{so that they are}} able to elicit enough of a customer’s private information that will make it possible to compute high quality schedules. The fourth challenge is that in a <b>service</b> <b>scheduling</b> environment, the objectives are complicated and they may even be in opposition. The distributed <b>service</b> <b>scheduling</b> environment enables each agent to have their own scheduling objectives. The objectives of these agents can vary from one to another. In addition to multiple objectives, since agents are self-interested, they are likely to behave strategically to achieve their own objectives without considering the global objectives of the system. Existing approaches usually deal with only a part of the challenges in a specific service domain. There is a need for general problem formulations and solutions that address <b>service</b> <b>scheduling</b> challenges in a comprehensive framework. In this thesis, I propose an integrated <b>service</b> <b>scheduling</b> framework for the general <b>service</b> <b>scheduling</b> problem. The proposed framework uses iterative auction as the base mechanism to tackle <b>service</b> <b>scheduling</b> challenges in distributed and dynamic environments. It accommodates customer’s private information by providing appropriate incentives to customers and {{it has the potential to}} accommodate dynamic events. This framework integrates customers’ preferences with the allocation of a provider’s capacity through multilateral negotiation between the provider and its customers. The framework can accommodate both price-based commercial settings and non-commercial service settings. Theoretical and experimental results are developed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The application of the framework to the mass customization of services and to appointment scheduling are developed to demonstrate the applicability of the general framework to specific service domains. A web-based prototype is designed and implemented to evaluate the scalability of the approach in a distributed environment...|$|R

40|$|Compared with {{traditional}} manufacturing <b>scheduling,</b> <b>service</b> process <b>scheduling</b> poses additional challenges {{attributable to the}} significant customer involvement in service processes. In services, there are typically no inventoried products, which make the service provider's capacity more sensitive to dynamic changes. <b>Service</b> process <b>scheduling</b> objectives are also more complicated due to the consideration of customer preferences, customer waiting costs and human resource costs. After describing the Unified Services Theory and analysing its scheduling implications, this paper reviews the research literature on <b>service</b> process <b>scheduling</b> system design with a particular emphasis on agent-based approaches. Major issues in agent-based <b>service</b> process <b>scheduling</b> systems design are discussed and research opportunities are identified. The survey of the literature reveals that despite of many domain-specific designs in agent-based <b>service</b> process <b>scheduling,</b> {{there is a lack}} of general problem formulations, classifications, solution frameworks, and test beds. Constructing these general models for <b>service</b> process <b>scheduling</b> system design will facilitate the collaboration of researchers in this area and guide the effective development of integrated <b>service</b> process <b>scheduling</b> systems. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{consider}} the stochastic fluid-flow model of a single node in a high-speed telecommunication network handling multi-class traffic. The node has multiple buffers, one for each class of traffic. The contents of these buffers are multiplexed onto a single output channel {{using one of the}} <b>service</b> <b>scheduling</b> policies: the Timed Round Robin Policy or the Static Priority Service Policy. The Quality of Service requirements for each class are based on cell loss probabilities. Using effective bandwidth method-ologies and the recently developed bounds for semi-Markov modulated traffic, we solve call admission control problems for the two <b>service</b> <b>scheduling</b> policies at this node. We compare the performance of the effective bandwidth methodologies and the SMP bounds technique. We also numerically compare the per-formance of the two <b>service</b> <b>scheduling</b> policies...|$|R
