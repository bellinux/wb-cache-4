5|$|<b>Steam</b> <b>Whistle</b> – An {{industrial}} <b>steam</b> <b>whistle</b> {{has been}} present on Georgia Tech's campus {{ever since the}} early industrial shop years. It typically was blown for the change of classes at five minutes before the hour. On football game days, the whistle is blown after every Yellow Jackets' score, and again after every Yellow Jackets' victory.|$|E
25|$|The Boilermaker Special, the {{official}} mascot of Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. A brass bell and <b>steam</b> <b>whistle</b> were donated to Purdue University by the Monon Railroad in 1940 for installation {{on the original}} Boilermaker Special I. The brass bell is still in use on the current Boilermaker Special V.|$|E
25|$|Swanson {{sought to}} develop an air horn which would mimic {{the sound of a}} classic <b>steam</b> <b>whistle.</b> Using ancient Chinese musical theory, Swanson {{produced}} the six-note model 'H6'. This was impractical for railroad use, due to its relatively large size. Railroad equipment operates over routes restricted by loading gauge, a difference of only a few inches may prohibit that equipment from operating on the line in question.|$|E
50|$|<b>Steam</b> <b>whistles</b> {{were often}} used in factories, and similar places to signal the start or end of a shift, etc. Railway locomotives, {{traction}} engines, and steam ships have traditionally been fitted with a whistle for warning and communication purposes. Large diameter <b>steam</b> <b>whistles</b> were used on light houses, likely beginning in the 1850s.|$|R
50|$|An {{array of}} <b>steam</b> <b>whistles</b> {{arranged}} {{to play music}} {{is referred to as}} a calliope.|$|R
60|$|<b>Steam</b> <b>whistles</b> blew their mightiest, flags waved, and {{the crowd}} on the other boats shouted {{themselves}} hoarse.|$|R
25|$|Myrons {{steering}} wheel, <b>steam</b> <b>whistle,</b> {{and many}} other artifacts were illegally removed from her wreck site in the 1980s {{by members of the}} Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society. Her artifacts are now the property of the State of Michigan and are on display as a loan to the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum. The wreck of Myron is protected as part of an underwater museum in the Whitefish Point Underwater Preserve.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the new {{propeller}} steamer Ogdensburg was heading the other way, from Cleveland to Ogdensburg, New York, carrying {{a load of}} wheat. At 2 am on 20 August, the paths of the two ships crossed near Long Point. On board Ogdensburg, the first mate, Degrass McNeil, was on duty. He spotted lights from Atlantic but was sure that Ogdensburg would pass {{at least a half}} mile ahead of the other ship. But then Atlantic changed course, turning north as though trying to pass in front of Ogdensburg. McNeil ordered Ogdensburg engines reversed and the ship turned to port, and since Ogdensburg <b>steam</b> <b>whistle</b> was broken, McNeil ran out onto the ship's deck and yelled to try and get the other ship to turn to starboard.|$|E
25|$|The {{previous}} whistles {{occur at}} low flow speeds, this whistle occurs {{at very high}} speeds. When a subsonic jet impinges on a cavity, jet instability {{becomes part of the}} feedback loop as with the hole tone. When a supersonic jet impinges on a cavity, shock wave instability becomes part of the feedback loop. The figure on the right is one example of this whistle. A cylindrical cavity with one end open and facing the supersonic circular jet will result in extremely intense sound. The shapes in the figure represent the shock/expansion cells within the jet. A related configuration, called the stem jet, has a central rod in the jet that extends to support and align the cavity. There {{are a number of other}} geometric variations, all of which operate in similar fashion, such as the <b>steam</b> <b>whistle.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Steam</b> <b>whistling</b> {{shall be}} practised only when {{absolutely}} necessary, {{and then with}} great caution, after a careful look-out.|$|R
50|$|A 20 x 15 ft brick {{fog signal}} {{building}} was constructed. It contained two 10 in <b>steam</b> train <b>whistles</b> that stuck {{out of the}} roof of the building and were operated by steam boilers. In 1928, the <b>steam</b> <b>whistles</b> were replaced by a modern air diaphone.|$|R
50|$|Locomotive steam {{trumpets}} {{were soon}} replaced by <b>steam</b> <b>whistles.</b> Air whistles were used on some Diesel and electric locomotives, but these mostly employ air horns.|$|R
500|$|IFREMER and RMS Titanic Inc., the successors to the {{sponsors}} of the 1987 expedition, returned to the wreck with Nautile and the ROV Robin in June 1993. Over the course of fifteen days, Nautile made fifteen dives lasting between eight and twelve hours. Another 800 artefacts [...] were recovered during the expedition including a two-tonne piece of a reciprocating engine, a lifeboat davit and the <b>steam</b> <b>whistle</b> from the ship's forward funnel.|$|E
500|$|After {{the village}} was incorporated, the company petitioned the village board to form the company into a village fire department. Their request was granted on February 10, 1903. In 1906, the village counsel advised reorganization, and the Briarcliff Fire Company {{was created in the}} office of Walter Law, with Messinger again serving as Foreman. The fire equipment, totaling $55.93 ($ in [...] ), was {{transferred}} to the new company. In 1908, American LaFrance sold a hook-and-ladder truck and two-wheeled hose-and-chemical truck (both horse-drawn) to the fire department for $2,700 ($ in [...] ). In the following year an alarm bell was purchased, replacing first a suspended railway iron and sledgehammer in a barn, which was followed by an ineffective <b>steam</b> <b>whistle.</b>|$|E
500|$|Georgia Tech has {{a number}} of legends and {{tradition}}s, some of which have persisted for decades. Some are well-known; for example, the most notable of these is the popular but rare tradition of stealing the 'T' from Tech Tower. Tech Tower, Tech's historic primary administrative building, has the letters [...] "TECH" [...] hanging atop it on each of its four sides. There have been several attempts by students to orchestrate complex plans to steal the huge symbolic letter T, and on occasion they have carried this act out successfully. One of the cherished holdovers from Tech's early years, a <b>steam</b> <b>whistle</b> blows five minutes before the hour, every hour from 7:55a.m. to 5:55p.m. The faculty newspaper is named The Whistle.|$|E
50|$|Robert Swanson started Airchime Ltd., {{starting}} out by making custom <b>steam</b> <b>whistles</b> in his British Columbia home. He liked {{the sound of}} <b>steam</b> <b>whistles</b> better than the single-chime horns made by Leslie and Westinghouse Air Brake Company. In 1949, he introduced the Hexatone 5 Chime (H5), of which some odd (88) were made according to Robert Eugene Swanson's personal manufacturing/sales records. The Hexatone H5 was only preceded by the Hexatone H6, of which (4), including a cast iron H6 prototype known as the 'Iron Maiden', were only produced and never sold in any quantity to any railroad and were considered experimental. The H-series and N-series, also rare, preceded the M-series manufactured by Nathan in the United States and Airchime Mfg. Co. of Vancouver, B.C., Canada. Airchime Mfg. Co's M3H became the standard 3-chime horn used in Canada. The Holden Co. Ltd. was the Canadian Distributor of Airchime Mfg. Co's locomotive air horns and <b>steam</b> <b>whistles</b> and did not manufacture any horns or whistles, a very common misconception.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} use of <b>steam</b> <b>whistles</b> was as boiler low-water alarms in the 18th {{century and}} early 19th century. During the 1830s, whistles were adopted by railroads and steamship companies.|$|R
50|$|Nathan {{also makes}} P-series and M-series horns for railroads and CS-Series and KJ-series horns, KSV {{vertical}} mount horns, <b>steam</b> <b>whistles,</b> heated horn assemblies, electronic pressure regulators, control valves, flange lubricators and glo rod gauges.|$|R
500|$|Without a map, {{the route}} they chose was largely conjectural. By dawn they had ascended to [...] {{and could see}} the {{northern}} coast. They were above Possession Bay, which meant {{they would need to}} move eastward to reach their intended destination of Stromness. This meant the first of several backtrackings that would extend the journey and frustrate the men. At the close of that first day, needing to descend to the valley below them before nightfall, they risked everything by sliding down a mountainside on a makeshift rope sledge. There was no question of rest—they travelled on by moonlight, moving upwards towards a gap in the next mountainous ridge. [...] Early next morning, 20 May, seeing Husvik Harbour below them, they knew that they were on the right path. At seven o'clock in the morning they heard the <b>steam</b> <b>whistle</b> sound from Stromness, [...] "the first sound created by an outside human agency that had come to our ears since we left Stromness Bay in December 1914". After a difficult descent, which involved passage down through a freezing waterfall, they at last reached safety.|$|E
2500|$|In 1928, Seattle Box Company {{bought a}} <b>steam</b> <b>whistle</b> from a Yukon River boat to mark {{starting}} and stopping times seven times daily—at {{five and six}} and seven a.m., at noon, one, four, and five o'clock. This [...] "particularly throaty" [...] <b>steam</b> <b>whistle</b> could be heard across a 12-mile (19km) radius from the plant in downtown Seattle until it was finally retired in 1961, the last <b>steam</b> <b>whistle</b> in Seattle.|$|E
2500|$|Note: Normandy's 3 Chime <b>Steam</b> <b>Whistle</b> Resided in Pratt Institute's Power House, 200 Willoughby Avenue, Brooklyn NY. [...] This <b>Steam</b> <b>Whistle</b> {{was last}} used to {{ring in the}} New Year 2015. The whistle is now at SUNY Maritime's Fort Schuyler.|$|E
60|$|One evening {{there was}} a slight commotion on the deck, and the course of the steamer was changed. Then came a blowing of <b>steam</b> <b>whistles</b> lasting several minutes. Finally the steamer came to a standstill.|$|R

50|$|Wind {{instruments}} are often characterized by their number of reeds, which is typically zero, one, or two. Reedless wind instruments typically have no moving parts {{other than the}} wind (air) itself. Examples include the flute, ocarina, recorder, tin <b>whistle,</b> and calliope (<b>steam</b> <b>whistles).</b>|$|R
2500|$|Huron was {{equipped}} with one acetylene lens lantern, , a [...] <b>steam</b> <b>whistle</b> fog horn, and a hand operated bell.|$|E
2500|$|The Bailey Gatzert had {{a unique}} four note musical <b>steam</b> <b>whistle</b> {{which had once}} been {{installed}} in the fast steamer Telephone. [...] In March 1895 the steamer was having some difficulty with the whistle, {{so much so that}} it was said to have sounded “like the bellowing of a cow just recovering from a severe attack of the grippe.” [...] By March 28, however, the whistle had been restored to its traditional sound. [...] Reportedly, attempts to build another <b>steam</b> <b>whistle</b> on the Telephone, with the same sound, all failed.|$|E
2500|$|The Spencer was {{considered}} one of the elite vessels of its time. [...] It had a bright red smokestack and a <b>steam</b> <b>whistle</b> so loud that it was said to have [...] "made rotten piles totter." ...|$|E
50|$|In 1885, a {{bell tower}} was erected, which {{incorporated}} a Stevens automatic bell striking machine. In 1890, the bell tower was torn down, and a fog signal building was built with <b>steam</b> <b>whistles</b> installed. In 1926 they {{were replaced by}} Type F diaphone fog horns.|$|R
50|$|The company {{operates}} the annual <b>Steam</b> <b>Whistle’s</b> Roundhouse Winter Craft Beer Festival (RHCBF). In 2017, the event (February 11) celebrates its fourth year. Plans were to include over 40 Ontario craft breweries and cideries {{and a special}} selection of beers from Alberta Small Brewers.|$|R
5000|$|The East Tennessee & Western North Carolina Railroad [...] affectionately {{called the}} [...] "Tweetsie" [...] in {{reference}} to the sound of its <b>steam</b> <b>whistles,</b> was primarily a [...] narrow gauge railroad established in 1866 for the purpose of serving the mines at Cranberry, North Carolina.|$|R
2500|$|The steamer {{went over}} stern first and broke into two pieces. [...] The <b>steam</b> <b>whistle</b> went off {{just as the}} boat broke in two. [...] The steamer crashed {{into the bottom of}} the falls a total wreck, pieces of which floated down the river.|$|E
2500|$|In late September 1869, Alert used a bell {{to sound}} its arrival, in a dense fog, {{at the dock}} in Oregon City. [...] While bells were used for such {{purposes}} on Mississippi River steamboats, this was departure from the tradition of Willamette River steamboats, which generally employed the <b>steam</b> <b>whistle</b> {{in lieu of a}} ship's bell.|$|E
2500|$|Johnson's {{preparations}} averted disaster again. On {{the morning}} of June 5, the force of ex-deputies attempted to charge the miners on Bull Hill. [...] Johnson's pickets alerted the miners encampment, allowing them to sound the Victor Mine's <b>steam</b> <b>whistle.</b> The alarm brought the state militia to the hill in time to intercept the men and stop their advance.|$|E
5000|$|In 1890, the station's {{fog signals}} were {{upgraded}} {{from the existing}} steam siren to 10 in <b>steam</b> <b>whistles.</b> On October 4, the Lighthouse steam barge RUBY delivered a work party and the necessary equipment for the upgrade. Within the month the task was completed, and the old sirens were thereupon transferred to Beaver Island Head Light. [...] "Life was busy for the keepers [...] [...] [...] that following year, since in addition to tending the light and maintaining the equipment, they operated the station's new <b>steam</b> <b>whistles</b> [...] [...] [...] 268 hours, stoking 26 tons of coal into their boilers." [...] In 1894 the boathouse, boatways and landing crib were moved fifteen feet toward the lake, due to the ever fluctuating water levels.|$|R
50|$|The {{quality of}} steam on which <b>steam</b> <b>whistles</b> are blown is {{variable}} and may affect frequency. Steam quality determines {{the velocity of}} sound, which declines with decreasing dryness due to the inertia of the liquid phase. Also, the specific volume of steam for a given temperature decreases with decreasing dryness.|$|R
60|$|Yet {{hour after}} hour went by and nothing of {{importance}} reached their ears. The vessels came up and passed them, and then the Peacock turned in for {{the mouth of the}} Detroit River. Soon the boys knew, by the <b>steam</b> <b>whistles</b> and other sounds, that the schooner was approaching some sort of harbor.|$|R
