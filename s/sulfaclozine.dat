The addition of reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers (isopropanol, methanol and KI) at different concentrations allowed us to understand {{the assessment of the}} different ROSs in <b>sulfaclozine</b> degradation. The rate constant of the reaction between <b>sulfaclozine</b> and â¢OH radicals was determined by a competitive kinetic method and a value of (7. 2 Ã 109 M- 1 s- 1) was found. HPLC/DAD and LC-MS/MS were used to follow the kinetics of appearance and disappearance of <b>sulfaclozine</b> as well as its intermediates. Twelve main photoproducts were identified from the photocatalytic degradation of <b>sulfaclozine</b> on TiO 2 suspensions by using LC-MS/MS. The comparison of the evolution of these intermediates with and without the addition of methanol showed that the quantity of 8 intermediates was decreased in the presence of methanol, for three of them the same amount was obtained while an increase was observed for one of them. Based on the identified intermediates, and the effect of ROS scavengers, a tentative degradation pathway for the photocatalytic degradation of <b>sulfaclozine</b> was proposed. In addition, total organic carbon (TOC) was examined...|$|E

The addition of isopropanol (500 mM), methanol (500 mM), and ICI (10 mM) to the system inhibited thedegradation of <b>sulfaclozine</b> c. a 60 %, 85 % and 95 % respectively, whichallowed us to conclude that (OH) -O-center dot radicals, valence-bandholes and electrons could intervene in the degradation of <b>sulfaclozine.</b> The second order rate constant of the reaction between sulfaclozineand (OH) -O-center dot radicals was determined by a competitive kineticsmethod and a value of (7. 2 x 10 (9) M- 1 s(- 1)) was obtained. HPLC/DAD and LC-MS/MS analysis were used to identify and follow theappearance and disappearance of <b>sulfaclozine</b> as well as itsintermediates. Twelve main intermediates were identified from thephotocatalytic degradation of <b>sulfaclozine</b> on TiO 2 suspensions.

Theseresults helped us to propose a tentative mechanism of degradationincluding (OH) -O-center dot radicals, holes, superoxide radicals andelectrons attack. In addition, TOC monitoring and mineralization duringthe photocatalytic degradation of <b>sulfaclozine</b> showed the release ofalmost all chlorides and the existence of the nitrogen atoms inmolecular form even after 180 min of irradiation.

40|$|SSCI-VIDE+ATARI+LIS:CFE:LFI:JMCInternational audienceThe {{evaluation}} of different persulfate activation methods (UV, solar light, electron, Fe(II)) on {{the degradation of}} <b>sulfaclozine</b> was investigated along with the effect of persulfate concentrations. UV/TiO 2 /K 2 S 2 O 8 resulted in the highest degradation rate regardless persulfate concentrations. However, persulfate addition on the UV/TiO 2 system was not as efficient as expected and the use of radical scavengers showed that pH {{played an important role in}} the distribution of dominant radicals. It was found that at pH 7, hydroxyl and sulfate radicals were involved in the degradation of <b>sulfaclozine,</b> whereas at pH 11 no contribution of sulfate radicals was observed. Following the formation of the six by-products of the first generation formed in UV/TiO 2 system, we obtained the formation of two by-products out of six in the UV/K 2 S 2 O 8 system and four in the UV/TiO 2 /K 2 S 2 O 8 system but with different concentrations, confirming the hypothesis suggested about the intervention of O- 2 (center dot-) in the degradation mechanism of <b>sulfaclozine.</b> The second order rate constant of the reaction between <b>sulfaclozine</b> and SO 4 center dot- radicals was determined by a competitive kinetics method and two values of 7. 5 x 10 (9) M- 1 s(- 1) and 1. 7 x 10 (10) M- 1 s(- 1) were obtained depending on the references used, and found to be close to those obtained between <b>sulfaclozine</b> and (OH) -O-center dot radicals (7. 2 x 10 (9) M- 1 s(- 1) and 5. 9 x 10 (9) M- 1 s(- 1)).

40|$|SSCI-VIDE+ATARI+JMC:CFEInternational audienceWhile the TiO 2 -based photocatalystic {{degradation}} of micro-pollutants in ultra-pure water is usually very efficient, {{the presence of}} natural constituents of water such as bicarbonate ions, chloride ions, phosphate ions, dissolved organic matters etc can dramatically affect the process. In this context, this work deals with the {{degradation of}} <b>sulfaclozine,</b> in the presence {{and in the absence}} of the main natural constituents of water in three different systems: UV/TiO 2, UV/K 2 S 2 O 8 and UV/TiO 2 /K 2 S 2 O 8. Here persulfate of potassium was added to the photocatalytic system to reduce the rate of electron-hole recombination and generate reactive sulfate radicals. A comparison will be done with the system UV/K 2 S 2 O 8. The results showed that (bi) carbonate and phosphate ions have an enhancing effect on the degradation rate of <b>sulfaclozine</b> in the UV/TiO 2 and UV/TiO 2 /K 2 S 2 O 8 systems while they have no effect in the UV/K 2 S 2 O 8 system. In the presence of humic substances an inhibitory effect was observed in the UV/ K 2 S 2 O 8 system and no significant effect was identified in the UV/TiO 2 and UV/TiO 2 /K 2 S 2 O 8 systems. Moreover, chloride ions enhanced the adsorption of <b>sulfaclozine</b> on the surface of TiO 2. In this work the results observed will be discussed as well as the reactivity of radicals, OH° and SO 4 °-, towards <b>sulfaclozine...</b>|$|E
40|$|SSCI-VIDE+ATARI+LIS:JMC:CFEInternational audienceAdvanced {{oxidation}} processes (AOPs) are techniques {{based on}} the generation of highly reactive radicals used for the degradation of organic compounds. There are many AOPs such as heterogeneous photocatalysis using for instance, TiO 2 as a catalyst or in situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) using oxidants such as persulfate which are widely used for water treatment. The different reactive species generated {{in each of these}} systems may react differently or similary with organic compouds. Moreover, water constituents effects may vary from a system to another. Thus, we aimed to compare the degradation of <b>sulfaclozine</b> in three systems: UV/TiO 2, UV/K 2 S 2 O 8 and UV/TiO 2 /K 2 S 2 O 8, and to show the effect of water constituents in each of these systems...|$|E
40|$|The most {{important}} source of Salmonella spp. infection in humans is by the consumption of contaminated poultry products. Due {{to the risk of}} resistance development and its transfer from animals to humans, the Belgian Royal Decree concerning the eradication of Salmonella (C- 2007 / 22784) prohibits treatment of poultry with antimicrobials against zoonotic Salmonella spp. To uncover illicit use, an analytical method using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) for the determination of antimicrobial residues in poultry excreta was developed and validated for classes having an active spectrum against Salmonella spp. in poultry: beta-lactams (amoxicillin and penicillin V), fluoroquinolones (enrofloxacin, difloxacin, and flumequine), polymyxins (colistin), sulfonamides in combination with trimethoprim (sulfachloropyridazine, sulfadiazine, and <b>sulfaclozine),</b> and tetracyclines (chlortetracycline and doxycycline). A generic and high-throughput sample preparation was developed. Extraction of samples was performed by ultrasonication using a combination of acetonitrile and McIlvaine buffer, followed by centrifugation and filtration prior to analysis. The method was validated according to Commission Decision 2002 / 657 /EC for linearity, apparent recovery/trueness, repeatability, reproducibility, limit of quantification, limit of detection, specificity, matrix effect, and storage stability in matrix. To demonstrate the applicability of the method, an in vivo experiment was conducted. For each antimicrobial class, one registered drug was selected and administered in the drinking water to two laying hens. Excreta samples were collected every 12 h during and until 2 days after treatment and analyzed using the developed method...|$|E
40|$|Aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the suitability of Daphnia curvirostris for the acute toxicity test usually performed on Daphnia magna, and to compare the sensitivity of the two species toward 10 antibacterials [enrofloxacin (EFX), ciprofloxacin(CPX), sulfaguanidine (SGD), sulfadiazine (SDZ), sulfamethazine (SMZ), sulfaquinoxaline (SQO), <b>sulfaclozine</b> (SCZ), sulfamerazine (SMA), sulfadimethoxine (SDM) and trimethoprim (TMP) ] and some of their binary mixtures. Furthermore, a tentative prolonged-toxicity test (lasting 13 d) was settled up in order to evidence toxic responses with drug concentrations that were uneffective in the classic 48 h immobilization test. Results showed that D. curvirostris was more sensitive than D. magna to the majority of compounds (6 out of 10). Lowest 48 h EC 50 s were obtained with EFX (4. 3 mg L 1 in D. curvirostris) and SGD (6. 2 mg L 1 in D. magna). The toxicity of paired compounds was always concentration- additive or less than concentration-additive. In the prolonged-toxicity test mortality and/or reproduction inhibition were constantly observed. It was concluded that: (1) D. curvirostris could be a suitable model for the evaluation of acute toxicity of antibacterials since its sensitivity was generally greater than that of D. magna; (2) the toxicity of EFX and SGD should be given special attention as the two compounds, in the prolonged test, showed to be active at concentrations of 0. 9 mg L 1 and 2. 5 mg L 1, respectively; (3) the concentration addition is usually a reasonable worst case estimation of the environmental impact of antibacterial mixtures...|$|E
40|$|Daphnia magna is a {{freshwater}} cladoceran largely {{employed in}} ecotoxicity tests {{due to its}} high sensitivity to xenobiotics, relative easiness of culturing, short parthenogenetic cycle and small dimensions. However, various {{studies have shown that}} other daphnids may be more sensitive than D. magna to some environmental contaminants. The use of indigenous species in toxicity tests has the advantage of generating ecologically relevant and environmentally realistic data for use in water quality guidelines. Aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the suitability of Daphnia curvirostris for the acute toxicity test usually performed on D. magna, and to compare the sensitivity of the two species toward 10 antibacterials and to some of their binary mixtures. The D. curvirostris clone used in the tests was generated from a specimen collected in Rosolina (RO, coordinate WGS 84 : 45, 138666698153 lat 12, 3240131618937 lon), while D. magna was originally obtained from Ecotox LDS S. r. l. (Milano, Italy). Tests were conducted in accordance with the OECD 202 guideline. Daphnids were exposed to scaled concentrations of the following antibacterials: enrofloxacin (EFX), ciprofloxacin(CPX), sulfaguanidine (SGD), sulfadiazine (SDZ), sulfamethazine (SMZ), sulfaquinoxaline (SQO), <b>sulfaclozine</b> (SCZ), sulfamerazine (SMA), sulfadimetoxine (SDM) and trimethoprim (TMP). Furthermore, the toxicity of 4 mixtures was evaluated (TMP+SDZ, TMP+SDM, TMP+SQO and EFX+CPX). The calculated EC 50 s spanned three orders of magnitude, varying from 4. 33 mg L- 1 (EFX) to 421, 1 mg L- 1 (SDM) in D. curvirostris and from 5. 21 mg L- 1 (SGD) to 379. 8 mg L- 1 (SCZ) in D. magna. D. curvirostris showed to be more sensitive than D. magna to the assayed compounds, with the exception of SMA, SDZ and SDM. With binary mixtures simple additivity was mainly recorded. It was concluded that D. curvirostris is well suitable for the acute immobilisation test, and that its sensitivity to xenobiotics may often be greater than that of D. magna, probably due to its higher surface/volume quotient; besides, being naturally present in the water ponds of northern Italy, D. curvirostris can give a realistic picture of the local environmental impact of xenobiotics. Tests with D. curvirostris were also useful in confirming that, as already observed in previous experiments with D. magna, binary mixtures of antibacterials usually act in accordance to the expectable and reassuring criterion of simple addition...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} the {{presence}} of pharmaceuticals in the environment and of their possible effects on ecosystems has been evidenced only in the last two decades, thanks to the progresses in analytical chemistry, and also to the progressive refinement of toxicological bioassays, leading to the detection of more subtle effects of pharmaceuticals on model organisms. In the last decade, progresses have been made also from the legislative point of view, introducing the duty of accurate evaluation of environmental impact for all newly commercialized drugs. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of knowledge about the environmental effects of pharmaceuticals. In the veterinary field, there are particular concerns about the environmental impact of livestock mass treatments (prophylactic/metaphylactic) which are administered for some days, at full dose and to a wide number of animals. Consequently, large quantities of active substances are released into the environment. Aim of this thesis, presented as a collection paper, was the evaluation of some sublethal effects of antibacterials, employed in mass treatments, on freshwater organisms. This in order to obtain a more in depth picture of the risks they could pose to the aquatic environment. The sensitivity of Daphnia curvirostris and Daphnia magna toward 10 antibacterials [enrofloxacin (EFX), ciprofloxacin(CPX), sulfaguanidine (SGD), sulfadiazine (SDZ), sulfamethazine (SMZ), sulfaquinoxaline (SQO), <b>sulfaclozine</b> (SCZ), sulfamerazine (SMA), sulfadimethoxine (SDM) and trimethoprim (TMP) ] and some of their binary mixtures, was compared. Furthermore, a tentative prolonged-toxicity test (lasting 13 days) was settled up in order to evidence toxic responses with drug concentrations that were uneffective in the classic 48 h immobilization test. Results showed that D. curvirostris was more sensitive than D. magna to the majority of compounds (7 out of 10). Lowest 48 h EC 50 s were obtained with EFX (4. 3 mg L- 1 in D. curvirostris) and SGD (6. 2 mg L- 1 in D. magna). The toxicity of paired compounds was always additive or less than additive. In the prolonged-toxicity test mortality and/or reproduction inhibition were constantly observed. It was concluded that: (1) D. curvirostris could be a suitable model for the evaluation of acute toxicity of antibacterials; (2) the toxicity of EFX and SGD should be given special attention (3) the concentration addition is usually a reasonable worst case estimation of the environmental impact of antibacterial mixtures. Some veterinary antibacterials which may contaminate the aquatic environment due to their use in livestock and/or aquaculture mass treatments were evaluated for their effects on swimming activity in D. magna (primary consumer) and Poecilia reticulata (secondary consumer). Results showed that the chosen endpoint may call to the attention of ecotoxicology some compounds otherwise negligible, based on lethality test. Sublethal effects of TMP were then evaluated in four freshwater organisms: Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and Lemna minor (growth inhibition), D. magna (reproduction and growth inhibition) and P. reticulata (swimming activity inhibition). TMP showed varying levels of toxicity in the four test performed, with NOEC for the various endpoints in the range of 3. 12 to 25 mg L- 1. The compound was active on P. reticulata at concentration ≥ 50 mg L- 1 causing inhibition of swimming activity. L. minor was more sensitive than unicellular algae to TMP, with a NOEC of 12. 5 mg L- 1. The lowest NOEC (3. 12 mg L- 1) was obtained in D. magna reproduction test and then a Risk Quotient of < 0. 03 was calculated by comparing the PNEC (31. 2 μg L- 1) and the TMP concentrations usually detected in freshwater (< 1 μg L- 1). It was concluded that while TMP concentrations normally detected in surface water are below those able to evoke appreciable biological effects in the various aquatic organisms, TMP concentrations in aquaculture and hospital effluents can be one to three orders of magnitude higher. Furthermore, the co-occurrence and additive effects of other antifolic agents should be taken into account for a cautious risk assessment of the drug. 2 Multigenerational tests on D. magna were performed exposing two subsequent generation of the crustacean to EFX, his metabolite CPX and TMP. In F 1 with respect to F 0, both for growth and reproduction, a worsening trend of the response with EFX, a similar response with CPX and an attenuating trend with TMP was observed. Furthermore, the lowest EC 20 for reproduction inhibition (1. 27 mg L- 1) was calculated for F 1 exposed to EFX. However, other experimentations, longer and more complex, are necessary in order to confirm that EFX is more hazardous to daphnids than CPX and TMP. EC 50 s measured for the three assayed antibacterials were in the 6. 49 - 36. 53 mg L- 1 range and therefore environmental unrealistic, except in case of exceptional contaminations that may occur in relation to poorly controlled wastewaters from pharmaceutical factories or excessive use of prophylactic treatments in aquacultur...|$|E
