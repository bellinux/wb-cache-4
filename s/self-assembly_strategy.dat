30|$|Recently, we have {{developed}} a <b>self-assembly</b> <b>strategy</b> at the immiscible oil-water interface to fabricate monolayer hollow-sphere nanofilm-based devices, such as ultraviolet (UV) light PDs and electrical resistive switching memory devices [6 – 9]. On the other hand, we also use the <b>self-assembly</b> <b>strategy</b> to construct hollow-sphere bilayer nanofilm-based UV PD devices, which show improved optoelectronic properties [10]. Hollow-sphere bilayer nanofilm-based UV PDs using abundant wurtzite ZnO and ZnS hollow nanospheres as the building blocks were constructed by the oil-water interfacial <b>self-assembly</b> <b>strategy.</b> These hollow-sphere nanofilm-based UV PDs showed high sensitivity, good stability, and fast response times, which are comparable to or even better than those of other ZnO nanostructures with different shapes [10 – 17]. It is quite promising for applications such as optical communications, flame sensing, missile launch, and so forth. However, we need to explore the photocurrent enhancement mechanisms in the bilayer nanofilm-based UV PDs made from ZnO and ZnS hollow spheres {{in order to further}} improve their optoelectronic properties. We believe that the photogenerated charges are extracted from these devices to not simply produce the photocurrent but instead cause some new changes in these devices which impel further free carriers to be generated and transported through the devices. In this work, the photocurrent enhancement mechanisms of these bilayer nanofilm-based UV PDs are explained. Especially, we prove a concept for light trapping in the hollow-sphere nanofilm-based UV PDs through the use of wavelength-scale resonant hollow spheres that support WGMs to enhance absorption and photocurrent. We numerically demonstrate this enhancement using full-field finite element method (FEM) simulations of hollow-sphere nanofilm-based UV PDs. It is proved that the WGM is an important concept for the manufacturing of the hollow-sphere nanofilm-based UV PDs, which facilitates the coupling of light into the resonant modes and substantial enhancement of the light path in the active materials, thus dramatically enhancing absorption and photocurrent.|$|E

Due to the presence of iron and silicon in their main chain, poly(ferrocenylsilane) s show a very high resistance to reactive ion etching, allowing one to transfer polymer patterns directly onto the substrate. Methods for introducing etch-resistant polymer patterns on substrate surfaces include soft lithography approaches such as microcontact printing, directed dewetting, and capillary force lithography. Next to top-down methods, <b>self-assembly</b> <b>strategies</b> are discussed. Phase separation in thin films of asymmetric organic–organometallic block copolymers leads to the formation of nanoperiodic organometallic patterns. The use of such thin films as nanolithographic templates is demonstrated. Surface patterning can also be realized using electrostatic self-assembly of organometallic polyions. Layer-by-layer deposition of poly(ferrocenylsilane) polyanions and polycations on chemically patterned substrates allows one to guide the growth of multilayer thin films and to produce patterned organometallic coatings...|$|R
