5|$|Early in {{the second}} half, Jensen made another save, this time from Terry McDermott. Brugge's first {{significant}} chance came a few minutes afterwards, when a cross-field pass by René Vandereycken reached Jan Sørensen {{on the right-hand side}} of the pitch. Sørensen's subsequent <b>shot</b> <b>was</b> blocked by Liverpool captain Emlyn Hughes. The blocked <b>shot</b> <b>was</b> not cleared, but Ray Clemence reached the ball before Brugge's Lajos Kű could reach it and score. After this Kű was substituted with Dirk Sanders. Liverpool made a substitution minutes later, with Steve Heighway replacing Case. Liverpool's substitution had more effect, as Heighway gave Liverpool more width on the right-hand side of the pitch. Two minutes after Heighway's introduction, Kenny Dalglish received the ball in the Brugge penalty area from a Graeme Souness pass and placed his shot over a diving Jensen to give Liverpool a 1–0 lead.|$|E

5|$|Liverpool got {{the second}} half under way, but it was West Ham who had the first attack of the half. Etherington {{advanced}} down the right hand side of the pitch and passed to Harewood, whose <b>shot</b> <b>was</b> saved by Reina, who also saved a subsequent shot from Benayoun. Liverpool had a chance immediately afterwards as Cissé passed to Alonso, but his <b>shot</b> <b>was</b> blocked and {{went out for a}} corner. A minute later, Liverpool made the first substitution of the match, as the injured Harry Kewell was replaced by Fernando Morientes. Liverpool equalised in the 54th minute, when Gerrard volleyed home a knock-down header from Crouch. The first yellow card of the match went to Ashton after he fouled Finnan in the 60th minute. Three minutes later, Carragher also received a yellow card for a foul on Ashton.|$|E

A throw-in by Cruyff was headed into the air, Liverpool goalkeeper Tommy Lawrence came to collect the ball. Realising he could not reach it, he moved back towards his goal, but de Wolf outjumped defender Chris Lawler to head {{the ball into the}} Liverpool goal. The {{conditions}} were so poor, that the crowd celebrated in stages. Those closest to the goal celebrated immediately, while those {{at the other end of}} the stadium reacted to these celebrations. Liverpool striker Hunt had a chance to score in the 12th minute, but his <b>shot</b> <b>was</b> saved by Ajax goalkeeper Gert Bals. Following the goal Ajax continued to attack, midfielder Sjaak Swart ran past three Liverpool players before passing the ball to Klaas Nuninga, whose <b>shot</b> <b>was</b> saved by Liverpool goalkeeper Lawrence. However, Lawrence dropped the ball near Johan Cruyff, who scored to give Ajax a 2–0 lead.|$|E
5|$|Brugge now {{needed to}} score, but they only created one more chance. Ten {{minutes before the}} end of the match, Sørensen intercepted a Hansen backpass and shot.

5|$|Due to {{the quick}} {{shooting}} schedule, the rain forced several exterior scenes to be re-written to be shot inside. Other scenes were shot with a large tarp draped over the actors. Due {{to the fact that}} the rainfall was audible in the background, Corman used the film's score and an assortment of sound effects to drown out the noise. The first scene <b>shot</b> <b>was</b> Beverly Garland and John Ireland's love scene in a tree. The tree was home to a colony of red ants, who crawled all over the actors and repeatedly bit them.|$|E

5|$|Liverpool had {{the first}} attack of the half when they were awarded a free-kick for foul on José Enrique. The {{subsequent}} free-kick was cleared by Whittingham {{only as far as}} Henderson whose <b>shot</b> <b>was</b> wide of the Cardiff goal. Two minutes later Cardiff had a chance to extend their lead; Whittingham went past Agger and passed to Don Cowie, who back heeled the ball to Miller, his subsequent shot went wide of the Liverpool goal. Henderson received the first yellow card of the match after his tackle on Mason was deemed to be too high. Cardiff had another chance in the 56th minute; a Gunnarsson long throw was punched away by Reina, but the clearance fell to Hudson, who headed the ball into the Liverpool penalty area to Gestede, his subsequent header was blocked by the Liverpool goalkeeper. Liverpool made the first substitution of the match a minute later when Henderson was replaced by Craig Bellamy. Two minutes after the substitution, Liverpool equalised. Downing took a corner kick, which was headed on by Carroll to Suárez, whose header hit the post, it rebounded to Škrtel; his shot went into the Cardiff goal to level the match at 1–1. Cardiff {{had the first}} chance after Liverpool's goal, but Mason's <b>shot</b> <b>was</b> saved by Reina.|$|E
5000|$|A useful {{method for}} remembering the {{diameter}} of numbered <b>shot</b> in inches <b>is</b> simply to subtract the shot size from 17. The resulting answer is {{the diameter of}} the shot in hundredths of an inch. For example, #2 shot gives 17-2 = 15, meaning that the diameter of #2 <b>shot</b> <b>is</b> 15/100 or 0.15". B <b>shot</b> <b>is</b> [...]170 inches, and sizes go up in [...]01 increments for BB and BBB sizes. In metric measurement, it is easy to remember that #5 <b>shot</b> <b>is</b> 3 mm; each number up or down represents a 0.25 mm change in diameter, so e.g. #7 <b>shot</b> <b>is</b> 2.5 mm.|$|R

This was the first time Germany failed to score in a shoot out since Uli Stielike missed in the 1982 World Cup. Germany ended up winning the shootout 6–5. Müller's poor run of form throughout the tournament hurt Germany's chances. Eventually, Müller finished the tournament without adding a goal to his name at the Euros.|$|E

5|$|Queen of the South {{started the}} game as the livelier team, pushing forward early on; however, Brechin City had the first goal scoring {{opportunity}} of the final when Graham Gibson's long range <b>shot</b> <b>was</b> saved by Queen of the South goalkeeper Andy Goram. Peter Weatherson had a similar opportunity for Queen of the South after a pass from Derek Lyle but was also saved by Brechin's goalkeeper, David Hay. Hay made another save 10 minutes later after another Weatherson attempt from Steve Bowey's pass. After 28 minutes, Brechin player Chris Jackson was booked for a foul on Bowey and Queen of the South scored the first goal of the game shortly after in the 33rd minute but with controversy; John O'Neill rebounded {{the ball into the}} goal after Bowey's initial <b>shot</b> <b>was</b> saved by the goalkeeper but Brechin defender Greg McCulloch claimed to have cleared the ball off the line, however, referee John Underhill awarded the goal.
