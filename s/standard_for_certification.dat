30|$|Management of the {{competing}} vegetation in New Zealand’s planted forests, predominantly comprised of Pinus radiata D. Don, is achieved primarily {{through the use}} of herbicides (Rolando et al. 2011). As over 60 % of the planted forest land is certified by the FSC (New Zealand Forest Owners Association 2011 / 2012), {{there is a need for}} the forest industry to critically examine herbicide use and, where possible, consider a reduction in application there-of. Certification allows New Zealand forest companies access to value-added markets and also offers a means of attracting investment from the global financial sector. A 20 % increase in the percentage of forest area certified over the past decade is a clear indication that certification is likely to remain a management preference. Moreover, the New Zealand forest industry is committed to the principles of sustainable forest management which is supported by the New Zealand Environmental Code of Practice for Plantation Forestry (New Zealand Forest Owners Association 2012) and the national initiative to develop the National <b>Standard</b> <b>for</b> <b>Certification</b> of Plantation Forest Management in New Zealand.|$|E

40|$|This master {{thesis is}} about {{designing}} and dimensioning a boat for transport of caravan, car, trailer or ATV. Buoyancy and stability are important properties as the pontoonboat {{should also be}} able to serve as a workboat. Many of the vessels on the market today that is being used for similar purpose are stable enough, but their hull is often similar with barges and thus too slow. This work has been to construct a boat that has good stability but also has a hull that enables it to move faster, is more maneuverable and having a more attracting design than today’s barges. This study includes requirement analysis, production of general arrangement, selection of appropriate material, design analysis and hydrostatic analysis. The hull design is based on DNV’s regulatory <b>Standard</b> <b>for</b> <b>Certification</b> of Craft. As the boat should be adaptable to accommodate customer requirements, it is fitted with outboard motors. This allows the user to easily change motors to fit the speed requirement of the boat. Sufficient power to meet speed requirement is decided after tests with prototype. The transom is designed with enough space for two engines when this allows for improved maneuverability. The work resulted in a boat that is 11. 5 m long and 3. 8 m wide. Aluton 38 ' is made entirely of aluminum and can take loads up to 3 tons...|$|E

Certification system could help expand economic interest and territory. Certification is activated {{one of the ways}} to trade a product as intellectual property rights, and developed along with intellectual property policy. In the field of disaster management, Business Continuity Management System (BCMS, ISO 22301) was developed globally in 2012 and certification system for enterprise with outstanding performance in disaster mitigation was introduced under the Act on assistance to the autonomous activities of enterprises for disaster mitigation in Korea. Since there is no international <b>standard</b> <b>for</b> <b>certification</b> system in the field of disaster and safety technology, it is urgently required to study to develop standards of performance certification for disaster and safety technology for entering global markets. This study analyzes and compares domestic and international certification system including BCMS to develop the Excellent Performance Certification on Disaster and Safety Technology. Moreover, this study suggests the needs of introduction of the Excellent Performance Certification System on Disaster and Safety Technology to vitalize business market related with disaster and safety technology, to enhance international cooperation, and to increase technology transfer to overseas. Especially, standardization and legislation of certification for disaster and safety technology in Korea are urgently necessary to form the foundation of international standardization, expand economical territory, and introduce of the excellence of creative economy. clos...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{initiated}} to investigate {{some of the}} factors involved in pollen dispersal within a corn seed production field. Factors studied were date of silking, distance from a source of contaminating pollen, linear length of tassel as related to percent contamination and the reliability of estimates of contamination measured by pollen collected on vaseline-coated slides. (1) Percent contamination resutling from three levels of plants not detasseled in a simulated hybrid corn seed production field was determined in 1951 using recessive genetic marker stocks conditioning waxy starch and yellow scutellum color. Regression coefficients for percent contamination on distance from source of contaminating pollen indicated distance was responsible for {{a significant part of}} the variability observed. (2) Percent contamination was observed in 1952 using wx marker stocks with 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 percent plants not detasseled. Dispersal of contaminating pollen was mainly to the north side of the plot regardless of the level of not detasseled plants. Standard partial regression coefficients and multiple correlation coefficients were computed for whole plots and for east, west, north and south half plots. An increase in the total variability attributed to date of silking and distance from source of contamination was obtained when plots were subdivided into north and south halves. (3) Pollen was dispersed somewhat more uniformly in all directions in 1953 than in 1952. Four levels of plants not detasseled were measured for percent contamination of kernels including a spike in tassel and 1, 2 and 5 percent plants not detasseled. Regression and correlation coefficients for percent contamination on distance from source and silking date all were significant at the five percent level. (4) Distance over which the pollen from a plant not detasseled will be dispersed in a seed field was measured in 1954 using dominant purple aleurone marker stocks. Observations for one year indicated contamination beyond 20 feet from the source averaged below the minimum <b>standard</b> <b>for</b> <b>certification.</b> More information is needed before final conclusions can be made. (5) A comparison of two methods of determining contamination, the vaseline-coated slide and the waxy kernel methods, were compared. Highly significant regression and correlation coefficients were obtained. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|E
