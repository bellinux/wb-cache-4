40|$|Introduction: Haemodialysis (HD) is a {{treatment}} in which {{blood from the}} patient is lead through a tubing system into a dialysis device in a extracorporeal circuit. This circuit contains semipermeable membranes (dialyzer). Blood with uraemic toxins flows on one side, and a salt solution flows on the other side. The salt solution flushes away waste products that have passed the membrane by diffusion or convection through small pores. From there the blood returns to the patient through a tubing system that contains an air-trap and a sensor to avoid air contamination in the blood. Besides air contamination, this treatment is burdened with safety problems such as biocompatibility, electrical safety and mechanical safety. The aim of this thesis {{was to investigate the}} safety issues in haemodialysis devices regarding leakage current and air contamination during standard procedures and simulated fault conditions. Does the dialysis device constitute a risk for the patient? Methods: To determine the extent of leakage current in HD machines, measurements at the filter-coupling site were performed in vitro according to the safety standard, IEC 601 - 1, in 5 types of dialysis machines. To determine, in vitro, to what extent blood and priming fluid allowed leakage current to pass to the patient, leakage current were also measured in the blood lines. The blood line was filled with blood from donors or priming fluid in eight different runs. To determine if leakage current could influence biocompatibility, a Fresenius 2008 C dialysis machine and 8 hemophan dialyzers were used. Blood lines contained about 400 ml heparinized blood from each of 8 different donors (in vitro). C 3 d was measured, in vitro, before start of a simulated dialysis and at 15, 30, 45 and 60 min. during standard dialysis procedure. Then 1. 5 mA current was switched on and additional samples were drawn at 75 and 90 min. Some patients need a central dialysis catheter (CDC) for access, placed close to or within the heart. To analyze if leakage current during standard HD would influence the ECG, patients with CDC or with AV-fistula as access were investigated. To analyse if air contamination could occur without activating security alarms in the dialysis device, various modes of in vitro dialysis settings were studied, some using a dextran solution to mimic blood viscosity. Besides visual inspection an ultrasound detector for microemboli and microbubbles was also used. Results: The data showed leakage current at the filter coupling site that was significantly higher for some devices than for others. The leakage current could pass through blood and priming fluid. It exceeded the cardiac floating (CF) -safety limit (< 50 μA) {{at the top of the}} CDC using the test mains on applied part for saline (median 1008 μA), for blood (median 610 μA) and for a <b>single</b> <b>fault</b> <b>condition</b> using saline (median 68 μA) or blood (47 μA). The leakage current experiments showed that complement activation worsened as the leakage current increased. During standard dialysis arrhythmia could occur. Microbubbles were visible at the bottom of the air-trap and bubbles could pass the air-trap towards the venous line without triggering the alarm. During recirculation, several ml of air could be collected in an intermediate bag after the venous line. Ultrasound showed the presence of bubbles of sizes 2. 5 - 50 μm as well as more than 50 μm silently passing to the venous line in all runs performed. In conclusion, the data showed that a leakage current in HD devices can be high enough to be a safety risk for the patient. This risk is greater if a single fault arises in the dialysis machine or another device connected to the same patient, or during mains contact to the patient. Then the current flow may be high enough to cause arrhythmia for the patient, especially when using a CDC. There is also reason for concern that micro bubble transmission may occur without inducing an alarm. These factors need to be looked over to improve safety regulations and optimize HD treatment and service schedules...|$|E

The aim of this work is to propose a circuit based model of a ME equipment to simulate the leakage currents measured during electrical safety tests. The set-up of these measures are described in the standard EN 60601 - 1, which also describes the insulations composing a ME equipment and where they are placed. While the standard EN 62353 describes the insulation resistances should be measured.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Electrical and Electronic Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. The next {{generation}} {{nuclear power plants}} like the Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (PBMR) permit {{for the design of}} advanced health monitoring (fault diagnosis) systems to improve safety, system reliability and operational performance. Traditionally, fault diagnosis has been performed by applying limit value checking techniques. Although simple, the inability of these techniques to model parameter dependencies and detect incipient fault behaviour renders them unfavourable. More recent approaches to fault diagnosis {{can be attributed to the}} advances in computational intelligence. Data driven methods like artificial neural networks are more widely used when modelling complex nonlinear systems, using only historical plant data. These methods are however dependent on the quality and amount of data used for model development. The key to developing an advanced fault diagnosis system is to adopt an integrated approach for monitoring the different aspects of the total process. Within this context, this goal is realized by presenting a new integrated architecture for sensor fault diagnosis in addition to the enthalpy-entropy graph approach for process fault diagnosis. The integrated architecture for sensor fault diagnosis named SENSE, exploits the strengths of several existing techniques whilst reducing their individual shortcomings. A novel approach for process fault diagnosis is proposed based on the characteristics inherent in the design of the PBMR. Power control by means of an inventory control system and no bypass valve operation facilitates a reference model that remains invariant over the power range. Consequently, the devised reference fault signatures remain static during steady state and transient variations of the normal process. In the thesis, both <b>single</b> and multiple <b>fault</b> <b>conditions</b> are considered during steady state and transient variations of the normal process. It is demonstrated that by applying SENSE, the fused variable estimates are consistent and more accurate than the individual sensor readings. Test cases corresponding to 32 <b>single</b> and multiple <b>fault</b> <b>conditions</b> confirmed that it is possible to use the enthalpy-entropy graph approach for process fault diagnosis. In addition, the proposed fault diagnosis approach is validated through an application to real data from the prototype Pebble Bed Micro Model (PBMM) plant. This application demonstrated that the proposed approach is ideally suited for early detection of faults and greatly reduces the amount of plant data required for model development. Doctora...|$|R
40|$|The method {{proposed}} {{tries to}} enumerate all the critical fault-patterns (successive occurrences of failures) without analyzing every <b>single</b> possible <b>fault.</b> The <b>conditions</b> {{for the system}} to be operating in a given mode can be {{expressed in terms of}} the static states. Thus, one can find all the system states that correspond to a given critical mode of operation. The next step consists in analyzing the fault-detection mechanisms, the diagnosis algorithm and the process of switch control. From them, one can find all the possible system configurations that can result from a failure occurrence. Thus, one can list all the characteristics, with respect to detection, diagnosis, and switch control, that failures must have to constitute critical fault-patterns. Such an enumeration of the critical fault-patterns can be directly used to evaluate the overall system tolerance to failures.
