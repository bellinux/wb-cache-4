40|$|Quality {{improvement}} {{is crucial for}} manufacturing companies to survive in today’s marketplace. The main {{purpose of this study}} was to improve the quality of one selected product produced by a manufacturing company using the Taguchi Method. The product, a plastic injection moulding is studied as it showed the highest reject quantity. The type of defects found in the product includes bubble, <b>short</b> <b>mould,</b> scratches and over pack. However due to company’s request and limitations, only two defects, <b>short</b> <b>mould</b> and over pack, were further investigated. Experimentation using Taguchi method was decided as the approach to reduce the occurrence of the defects. To that end, four main factors affecting the surface defects were identified. They are injection pressure (A), injection speed (B), melting temperature (C) and holding pressure (D). Taguchi method was chosen since it provides fast and lower costs for conducting the experiments as well as in determining optimum parameter. Qualitek- 4 software was used to facilitate the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio analysis in the Taguchi Method and to predict the results at optimal parameters setting. The results from the two levels of experiments (L 8) suggest that all parameters and 2 -factor interactions investigated were significant for <b>short</b> <b>mould</b> and all the factors should be set at high level to achieve optimum condition. In the case of the over pack problem, two significant factors and one significant interaction factor which are injection speed (B), melting temperature (C) and interaction AB (injection pressure and melting temperature) were found to be significant and should be set at low level. Confirmation run was conducted for over pack problem and the recommended optimal settings are injection pressure at high level, injection speed at low level, melting temperature at low level and holding pressure at high level (A 2 B 1 C 1 D 2). Future studies could look at introducing others factors that may be involved in the process and to possibly use conventional design of experiment metho...|$|R
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of plastic moulding defect products {{is not a}} foreign problem.

40|$|The {{intimate}} apparel {{market is}} changing towards the personalized consumption environment rapidly. On one hand, consumers’ behaviour is more selective; On the other hand, brassiere design and development cycle are getting <b>shorter</b> and <b>shorter.</b> <b>Mould</b> head design {{is a key}} process in producing brassieres. A master cone which is the prototype of the mould head can be developed by a novel parametric method. The example-based method can easily make a new mould head style from several existing styles of master cones only by adjusting corresponding weights. Through the remeshing and registration algorithm, designer can characterize the outer surfaces of the mould head and scanned bra cups, aligning them each other at a point with same topology for assessing deviation.

40|$|Three-dimensional finite-element thermal-stress {{models have}} been {{developed}} to predict temperature, distortion and residual stress in the mould of thin slab continuous casters. Geometrically, {{there are two kinds of}} mould to achieve high-speed casting: funnel-shaped and parallel mould. The mould shape and high casting speed leads to higher <b>mould</b> temperatures and <b>shorter</b> <b>mould</b> life than in conventional slab casters. The purpose of this study is to investigate the heat flux and the effects of mould shape on distortion of the mould in a thin slab caster. Mould wall temperature measured in the plant was analyzed to determine corresponding the heat-flux profiles in thin slab moulds using an Inverse Heat Conduction model, and this data was then used in an elastic-visco-plastic analysis to investigate the deformation of the moulds in service for different the mould shapes. The model predictions of temperature and distortion during operation match plant observations. During operation, the hot face temperature reaches 430 oC and the copper plates bend toward the steel, with a maximum outward distortion of about 0. 3 mm. This occurs just above the center of the wide faces, and is smaller than the distortion of a conventional slab mould...|$|R
50|$|The use of {{thermoset}} plastic compounds characterizes this molding process {{from many of}} the other molding processes. These thermosets can be in either preform or granule shapes. Unlike some of the other processes we find that the materials are usually preheated and measured before molding. This helps to reduce excess flash. Inserts, usually metallic, can also be molded with the plastic. As a side note, remember not to allow any undercuts on the shape, it will make ejection especially difficult. Thermoplastic matrices with an inherent indefinite shelf-life and <b>shorter</b> cycle <b>moulding</b> times are widely used and examples are shown in Ref 3.|$|R

40|$|Several new {{technologies}} to assist plastic injection moulding companies have been developed in the last twenty years. A number of computer software programs are now available which could revolutionise mould design. The most exciting aspect of the Computer Aided Mould Design (CAMD) software is the effect it has on reducing the lead time required to produce a working mould from a product concept. The application of the new technology for designing moulds, however, has been slow in New Zealand. One {{of the main reasons}} for the slow progress is the perceived value of the software or consulting services. Many injection moulding companies who design and manufacture moulds do not realise the great potential of CAMD software to save many hours of mould changes and volume of polymer material, even when the program is used after the mould has been made. However, the true benefits are only seen when the mould is designed using CAMD before the mould has been manufactured. Moulds manufactured correctly the first time save a great deal of time, energy and money. The value of the software is not completely understood by injection moulding manufacturers. They perceive the immediate benefits, however, the ongoing benefits are not recognised. A project was carried out to demonstrate the potential of CAMD software in determining moulding problems in existing injection moulded products. Four products, two of which were supplied by an injection moulding company, that had moulding problems, were simulated using Moldflow, a CAMD software package. The results of the simulation were compared with the actual moulding problems. It was found that the Moldflow simulation results described the problems occurring in the moulds accurately. Moulding problems included warpage, air traps and weld lines in poor positions and flow marks. Warpage is a major problem in injection moulded products. Even simple products can warp if not designed correctly. The only problems Moldflow did not identify, and does not claim to, were the flow marks caused by jetting and splashing of plastic as it entered the cavity. The designer must be aware of the problems caused by jetting and design gates to avoid it. Moldflow, and other CAMD software, are beneficial tools for the mould designer. The advantages of CAMD include <b>short</b> <b>mould</b> development time, <b>shorter</b> lead times from concept to production, reduction in the amount of material used, fewer changes to machine settings and predictable, repeatable quality. These benefits are not only savings in the mould design and manufacture, they also continue on into the processing of the product since less material is used in the product and machine down time caused by moulding problems is greatly reduced...|$|R

For linear elastic stiffness analysis there are well working interfaces between the injection moulding and structural analysis softwares. For strength analysis a Matlab programme has been written, which uses a method suggested by Laspalas et al.

40|$|Abstract. The present {{work can}} be {{regarded}} as a first step toward an integrated modelling of mould filling during injection moulding process of polymer matrix composites and the resulting material behaviour under service loading conditions. More precisely, the emphasis of the present research is laid on the development of a mechanical model which takes into account the processing-induced microstructure and is capable to predict the mechanical response of the material. In the Part I, a set of experiments which captures the mechanical behaviour of an injection <b>moulded</b> <b>short</b> fibre reinforced under different strain histories is described. Three mechanical testing are conducted: Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA), uniaxial tension and simple shear. Tests show that the material exhibits complex responses mainly due to non-linearity, anisotropy, time/rate-dependence, hysteresis and permanent strain. Moreover, the relaxed state of the material is characterized by the existence of a so-called anisotropic equilibrium hysteresis independently of the prescribed strain rate...|$|R

60|$|This work, which {{appeared}} in 1791, is considered by the German critics as his chief performance in this department of literature: The Revolt of the Netherlands, the only one which could have vied with it, never was completed; otherwise, in our opinion, {{it might have been}} superior. Either of the two would have sufficed to secure for Schiller a distinguished rank among historians, of the class denominated philosophical; though even both together, they afford but a feeble exemplification of the ideas which he entertained on the manner of composing history. In his view, the business of history is not merely to record, but to interpret; it involves not only a clear conception and a lively exposition of events and characters, but a sound, enlightened theory of individual and national morality, a general philosophy of human life, whereby to judge of them, and measure their effects. The historian now stands on higher ground, takes in a wider range than those that went before him; he can now survey vast tracts of human action, and deduce its laws from an experience extending over many climes and ages. With his ideas, moreover, his feelings ought to be enlarged: he should regard the interests not of any sect or state, but of mankind; the progress not of any class of arts or opinions, but of universal happiness and refinement. His narrative, in <b>short,</b> should be <b>moulded</b> according to the science, and impregnated with the liberal spirit of his time.|$|R
40|$|The Cell Method {{has been}} used to predict the {{behaviour}} of materials characterized by a complex structure, in which the spatial arrangement of the constituents determines the material mechanical properties. In industrial applications, microstructure heterogeneities can derive from the manufacturing process, as in sintered alloys. In other cases, as in injection <b>moulded</b> <b>short</b> fibre composites, the final mechanical properties depend on the resulting fibre pattern within the matrix. Unlike the Finite Elements (FEM) and other methods, the Cell Method is a numerical method based on a direct discrete formulation of equilibrium equations, so that no differential formulation is needed to write the balance equations. When approaching the analysis of complex structure materials, a relevant aspect in the FEM approach is that special elements and {{a very large number of}} degrees of freedom must be employed because of the discontinuities and large gradients encountered. One of the consequences of the Cell Method direct discrete approach is that no restriction is imposed by differentiability conditions so that the characteristic length of the elementary cell in the discretization may be of the same order of magnitude as the heterogeneities of the structure. Therefore, the Cell method appears to be particularly suitable to assess the mechanical behaviour of complex structure heterogeneous materials. In this paper, plane models in the elastic and plastic field have been applied to predict the behaviour of sintered alloys, showing a good agreement with experimental data, and 3 D models of short glass fibre reinforced polyamide, in which micro-structures are identified by tomographic techniques, have been used to investigate the relationships between the morphological and elastic properties deriving from the complex fibre orientation patterns induced by the manufacturing process...|$|R
