5|$|Green {{is common}} in nature, as many plants are green because of a complex {{chemical}} known as chlorophyll, which is involved in photosynthesis. Chlorophyll absorbs the long wavelengths of light (red) and <b>short</b> <b>wavelengths</b> of light (blue) much more efficiently than the wavelengths that appear green to the human eye, so light reflected by plants is enriched in green. Chlorophyll absorbs green light poorly because it first arose in organisms living in oceans where purple halobacteria were already exploiting photosynthesis. Their purple color arose because they extracted energy in the green portion of the spectrum using bacteriorhodopsin. The new organisms that then later came to dominate the extraction of light were selected to exploit those portions of the spectrum not used by the halobacteria.|$|E
5|$|Oliphant's {{group at}} Birmingham worked on {{developing}} two promising devices, the klystron and the magnetron. Working with James Sayers, Oliphant managed {{to produce an}} improved version of the klystron capable of generating 400W. Meanwhile, two more members of his Birmingham team, John Randall and Harry Boot, worked on a radical new design, a cavity magnetron. By February 1940, they had an output of 400W with a wavelength of , {{just the kind of}} <b>short</b> <b>wavelengths</b> needed for good airborne radars. The magnetron's power was soon increased a hundred-fold, and Birmingham concentrated on magnetron development. The first operational magnetrons were delivered in August 1941. This invention was one of the key scientific breakthroughs during the war and played a major part in defeating the German U-boats, intercepting enemy bombers, and in directing Allied bombers.|$|E

25|$|While tetrachromatic {{vision is}} not {{exclusive}} to birds (insects, reptiles, and crustaceans are also sensitive to <b>short</b> <b>wavelengths),</b> some predators of UVS birds cannot see ultraviolet light.

However, recent evidence does not appear to support this hypothesis.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of surface tension, the waves {{propagate}} faster. Surface tension only has influence for short waves, with wavelengths less than a few decimeters {{in case of a}} water–air interface. For very <b>short</b> <b>wavelengths</b> – two millimeter or less, in case of the interface between air and water – gravity effects are negligible. Note that surface tension can be altered by surfactants.|$|E
40|$|The {{half-space}} instabilities and <b>short</b> <b>wavelength</b> bifurcations in cylinders and rectangular block {{were compared}} in the study.

Also, the <b>short</b> <b>wavelength</b> bifurcation of a compressible pressure sensitive block corresponds to the half-space rumpling mode bifurcation of the same material.

40|$|A {{computational}} model is presented for simulating axial compressor stall inception and development via disturbances with length scales {{on the order}} of several (typically about three) blade pitches. The model was designed for multi-stage compressors in which stall is initiated by these <b>short</b> <b>wavelength</b> disturbances, also referred to as spikes. The inception process described is fundamentally nonlinear, in contrast to the essentially linear behavior seen in so-called modal stall inception. The model was able to capture the following experimentally observed phenomena: (1) development of rotating stall via <b>short</b> <b>wavelength</b> disturbances, (2) formation and evolution of localized <b>short</b> <b>wavelength</b> stall cells in the first stage of a mismatched compressor, (3) the switch from long to <b>short</b> <b>wavelength</b> stall inception resulting from the re-staggering of the inlet guide vane, (4) the occurrence of rotating stall inception on the negatively sloped portion of the compressor characteristic. Parametric investigations indicated that (1) <b>short</b> <b>wavelength</b> disturbances were supported by the rotor blade row, (2) the disturbance strength was attenuated within the stators, and (3) the reduction of inter-blade row gaps can suppress the growth of <b>short</b> <b>wavelength</b> disturbances. It is argued that each local component group (rotor plus neighboring stators) has its own instability point (i. e. conditions at which disturbances are sustained) for <b>short</b> <b>wavelength</b> disturbances, with the instability point for the compressor set by the most unstable component group...|$|R

25|$|Through {{the work}} of Max Planck, Einstein, Louis de Broglie, Arthur Compton, Niels Bohr and many others, current {{scientific}} theory holds that all particles also have a wave nature (and vice versa).

For macroscopic particles, because of their extremely <b>short</b> <b>wavelengths,</b> wave properties usually cannot be detected.|$|E
25|$|Which peak to use {{depends on}} the application. The {{conventional}} choice is the wavelength peak at 25.0% given by Wien's displacement law in its weak form. For some purposes the median or 50% point dividing the total radiation into two halves may be more suitable. The latter {{is closer to the}} frequency peak than to the wavelength peak because the radiance drops exponentially at <b>short</b> <b>wavelengths</b> and only polynomially at long. The neutral peak occurs at a shorter wavelength than the median for the same reason.|$|E
25|$|The {{characteristic}} colours are, {{from long}} to <b>short</b> <b>wavelengths</b> (and, correspondingly, from low to high frequency), red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet. Sufficient differences in wavelength cause {{a difference in}} the perceived hue; the just-noticeable difference in wavelength varies from about 1nm in the blue-green and yellow wavelengths, to 10nm and more in the longer red and shorter blue wavelengths. Although the human eye can distinguish up to a few hundred hues, when those pure spectral colors are mixed together or diluted with white light, the number of distinguishable chromaticities can be quite high.|$|E

25|$|Broadly speaking, {{interstellar}} extinction is strongest at <b>short</b> <b>wavelengths,</b> generally {{observed by}} using techniques from spectroscopy. Extinction {{results in a}} change in the shape of an observed spectrum. Superimposed on this general shape are absorption features (wavelength bands where the intensity is lowered) that have a variety of origins and can give clues as to the chemical composition of the interstellar material, e.g. dust grains. Known absorption features include the 2175 Å bump, the diffuse interstellar bands, the 3.1 μm water ice feature, and the 10 and 18 μm silicate features.|$|E
25|$|Stokes' wave theory — a perturbation-series {{approach}} to the description of weakly nonlinear and dispersive waves, especially successful in deeper water for relative <b>short</b> <b>wavelengths,</b> {{as compared to the}} water depth. However, for long waves the Boussinesq approach—as also applied in the KdV equation—is often preferred. This is because in shallow water the Stokes' perturbation series needs many terms before convergence towards the solution, due to the peaked crests and long flat troughs of the nonlinear waves. While the KdV or Boussinesq models give good approximations for these long nonlinear waves.|$|E
25|$|This {{equation}} is correct {{to a much}} wider temperature range, but still depends on the approximation of heat capacity ratio being independent of temperature, {{and for this reason}} will fail, particularly at higher temperatures. It gives good predictions in relatively dry, cold, low pressure conditions, such as the Earth's stratosphere. The equation fails at extremely low pressures and <b>short</b> <b>wavelengths,</b> due to dependence {{on the assumption that the}} wavelength of the sound in the gas is much longer than the average mean free path between gas molecule collisions. A derivation of these equations will be given in the following section.|$|E

25|$|Bending wave {{transducers}} use {{a diaphragm}} that is intentionally flexible. The rigidity {{of the material}} increases from the center to the outside. <b>Short</b> <b>wavelengths</b> radiate primarily from the inner area, while longer waves reach {{the edge of the}} speaker. To prevent reflections from the outside back into the center, long waves are absorbed by a surrounding damper. Such transducers can cover a wide frequency range (80Hz to 35,000Hz) and have been promoted as being close to an ideal point sound source. This uncommon approach is being taken by only a very few manufacturers, in very different arrangements.|$|E
25|$|With {{increasing}} depth underwater, sunlight is absorbed, and {{the amount}} of visible light diminishes. Because absorption is greater for long wavelengths (red end of the visible spectrum) than for <b>short</b> <b>wavelengths</b> (blue end of the visible spectrum), the colour spectrum is rapidly altered with increasing depth. White objects at the surface appear bluish underwater, and red objects appear dark, even black. Although light penetration will be less if water is turbid, in the very clear water of the open ocean less than 25% of the surface light reaches a depth of 10 m (33feet). At 100m (330ft) the light present from the sun is normally about 0.5% of that at the surface.|$|E

25|$|Proper {{choice of}} plasmatic metal nano-particles {{is crucial for}} the maximum light {{absorption}} in the active layer. Front surface located nano-particles Ag and Au are {{the most widely used}} materials due to their surface plasmon resonances located in the visible range and therefore interact more strongly with the peak solar intensity. However, such noble metal nano-particles always introduce reduced light coupling into Si at the <b>short</b> <b>wavelengths</b> below the surface plasmon resonance due to the detrimental Fano effect, i.e. the destructive interference between the scattered and unscattered light. Moreover, the noble metal nano-particles are impractical to implement for large-scale solar cell manufacture due to their high cost and scarcity in the earth's crust. Recently, Zhang et al. have demonstrated the low cost and earth abundant materials Al nano-particles to be able to outperform the widely used Ag and Au nano-particles. Al nano-particles, with their surface plasmon resonances located in the UV region below the desired solar spectrum edge at 300nm, can avoid the reduction and introduce extra enhancement in the shorter wavelength range.|$|E
25|$|Black-body radiation, the {{emission}} of electromagnetic energy {{due to an}} object's heat, could not be explained from classical arguments alone. The equipartition theorem of classical mechanics, the basis of all classical thermodynamic theories, stated that an object's energy is partitioned equally among the object's vibrational modes. But applying the same reasoning to the electromagnetic emission of such a thermal object was not so successful. That thermal objects emit light had been long known. Since light {{was known to be}} waves of electromagnetism, physicists hoped to describe this emission via classical laws. This became known as the black body problem. Since the equipartition theorem worked so well in describing the vibrational modes of the thermal object itself, it was natural to assume that it would perform equally well in describing the radiative emission of such objects. But a problem quickly arose: if each mode received an equal partition of energy, the short wavelength modes would consume all the energy. This became clear when plotting the Rayleigh–Jeans law which, while correctly predicting the intensity of long wavelength emissions, predicted infinite total energy as the intensity diverges to infinity for <b>short</b> <b>wavelengths.</b> This became known as the ultraviolet catastrophe.|$|E
25|$|They are nocturnal piscivorous drift-hunters. The body {{is covered}} in cosmoid scales that act as armor. Coelacanths have eight fins – 2 dorsal fins, 2 {{pectoral}} fins, 2 pelvic fins, 1 anal fin and 1 caudal fin. The tail is very nearly equally proportioned and is split by a terminal tuft of fin rays that make up its caudal lobe. The eyes of the coelacanth are very large, while the mouth is very small. The eye is acclimatized to seeing in poor light by rods that absorb mostly <b>short</b> <b>wavelengths.</b> Coelacanth vision has evolved to a mainly blue-shifted color capacity. Pseudomaxillary folds surround the mouth and replace the maxilla, a structure absent in coelacanths. Two nostrils, along with four other external openings, appear between the premaxilla and lateral rostral bones. The nasal sacs resemble those of many other fish and do not contain an internal nostril. The coelacanth's rostral organ, contained within the ethmoid region of the braincase, has three unguarded openings into the environment and {{is used as a}} part of the coelacanth's laterosensory system. The coelacanth's auditory reception is mediated by its inner ear, which is very similar to that of tetrapods because it is classified as being a basilar papilla.|$|E
