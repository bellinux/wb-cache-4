40|$|INTRODUCTION: Falls are {{the leading}} cause of injury in almost all age-strata in the U. S. However, fall-related {{injuries}} (FI) and their circumstances are under-studied at the population level, particularly among young and middle-aged adults. This study examined the circumstances of FI among community-dwelling U. S. adults, by age and gender. METHODS: Narrative texts of FI from the National Health Interview Survey (1997 - 2010) were coded using a customized taxonomy to assess place, activity, initiating event, hazards, contributing factors, fall height, and work-relatedness of FI. Weighted proportions and incidence rates of FI were calculated across six age-gender groups (18 - 44, 45 - 64, 65 + years; women, men). RESULTS: The proportion of FI occurring indoors increased with age in both genders (22 %, 30 %, and 48 % among men, and 40 %, 49 % and 62 % among women for 18 - 44, 45 - 64, 65 + age-groups, respectively). In each age group the proportion of indoor FI was higher among women as compared to men. Among women, using the stairs was the second leading activity (after walking) at the time of FI (19 %, 14 % and 10 % for women in 18 - 44, 45 - 64, 65 + age groups, respectively). FI associated with tripping increased with age among both genders, and women were more likely to trip than men in every age group. Of all age-gender groups, the rate of FI while using ladders was the highest among middle-aged men (3. 3 per 1000 person-year, 95 % CI 2. 0, 4. 5). Large objects, <b>stairs</b> <b>and</b> <b>steps,</b> and surface contamination were the three most common hazards noted for 15 %, 14 % and 13 % of fall-related injuries, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The rate and the circumstances of FI differ by age and gender. Understanding these differences and obtaining information about circumstances could be vital for developing effective interventions to prevent falls and FI...|$|E
40|$|NoPURPOSE. Epidemiologic {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that elderly people who wear multifocal spectacles have an increased risk of tripping, particularly on stairs. Yet no studies have experimentally examined how wearing multifocal spectacles affects <b>stair</b> <b>and</b> <b>step</b> negotiation. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the effects of wearing multifocal compared with single-distance vision spectacles on minimum toe clearance and risk of tripping during step negotiation in the elderly. METHODS. Nineteen healthy subjects (mean age, 71. 4 years) performed a single step up to a new level (heights, 7. 5, 15, and 22 cm) while wearing multifocal (bifocals and progressive addition lenses) or single-distance vision spectacles. Minimum horizontal and vertical toe clearance were assessed by analyzing data collected with a five-camera, three-dimensional motion-analysis system. RESULTS. There was no difference in mean minimum toe clearance in subjects when wearing multifocal compared with single-distance vision spectacles. However, there was greater within-subject variability in vertical toe clearance when wearing multifocal spectacles (variance ratio, 1. 53; P = 0. 0004). Subjects were also significantly more likely to trip when wearing multifocal compared with single-vision spectacles (one-sided Fisher's exact test P = 0. 025). CONCLUSIONS. Because of increased within-subject variability in vertical toe clearance when wearing multifocal spectacles, elderly individuals may be at greater risk of falling when negotiating <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> <b>stairs</b> if they do not also consistently increase margins of safety (mean vertical toe clearance). This suggests that some elderly who are at high risk of falling may benefit from wearing single-distance vision rather than multifocal spectacles when walking...|$|R

Impatient of seeing food which I could not taste, I put it all aside into a cupboard, and then demanded, [...] "What shall I do till evening?" [...] for before six P.M. it would be vain to seek the Rue Notre Dame aux Neiges; its inhabitant (for me it had but one) was detained by her vocation elsewhere. I walked {{in the streets of}} Brussels, and I walked in my own room from two o'clock till six; never once in that space of time did I sit down. I was in my chamber when the last-named hour struck; I had just bathed my face and feverish hands, and was standing near the glass; my cheek was crimson, my eye was flame, still all my features looked quite settled and calm. Descending swiftly the <b>stair</b> <b>and</b> <b>stepping</b> out, I was glad to see Twilight drawing on in clouds; such shade was to me like a grateful screen, and the chill of latter Autumn, breathing in a fitful wind from the north-west, met me as a refreshing coolness.

Now, when the winds were gathered home, when the deep was dandling itself back into its summer slumber, and when the stars rained their gentle light over land and sea, the voice of these tide-breakers was still raised for havoc. They seemed, indeed, to be a part of the world's evil and the tragic side of life. Nor were their meaningless vociferations the only sounds that broke the silence of the night. For I could hear, now shrill and thrilling and now almost drowned, the note of a human voice that accompanied the uproar of the Roost. I knew it for my kinsman's; and a great fear fell upon me of God's judgments, and the evil in the world. I went back again into the darkness of the house as into a place of shelter, and lay long upon my bed, pondering these mysteries.|$|R
