25|$|She {{was dressed}} for {{traveling}} and for cold weather. Her hood {{was large and}} round and red but not smooth, — it was corrugated; that is to say, it consisted {{of a series of}} rolls nearly as large as my arm, passing over her head sidewise, growing smaller toward the back until they terminated in a big button that was embellished with a knot of green ribbon. Its general appearance was not unlike that of the familiar, pictorial beehive except that the rolls were not arranged spirally. The broad, white ruffle of her lace cap projected several inches beyond the front of the hood and waved back and forth like the single leaves of a great white poppy, as <b>she</b> <b>nodded</b> emphatically in her discourse.|$|E
2500|$|Christopher Bowdish, a Bethlehem Police detective, stated that, {{as medical}} {{personnel}} attended to Joan Porco at her home, {{he took a}} moment to ask her whether she could identify her attacker. Bowdish said that when he asked Joan if a family member had done it, Joan used her head to indicate [...] "yes". Bowdish has maintained that when he asked her whether it had been her older son Jonathan, a Naval officer stationed in South Carolina during the attack, she shook her head, indicating it was not, but that <b>she</b> <b>nodded</b> her head up and down, indicating [...] "yes", when he asked her whether Christopher was responsible. Joan Porco's alleged identification of her son Christopher may explain why Bethlehem Police pursued her son soon after the incident, rather than conducting a broader investigation of potential suspects. She also answered in similar ways to other separate questions.|$|E
2500|$|Atatürk {{attached}} {{great importance}} to aviation and for that purpose oversaw {{the foundation of the}} Turkish Aeronautical Association in 1925. He took Sabiha along with him to the opening ceremony of Türkkuşu (Turkishbird) Flight School on 5 May 1935. During the airshow of gliders and parachutists invited from foreign countries, she got very excited. As Atatürk asked her whether she would also want to become a skydiver, <b>she</b> <b>nodded</b> [...] "yes indeed, I am ready right now". Atatürk instructed Fuat Bulca, the head of the school, to enroll her as the first female trainee. She was meant to become a skydiver, but she was much more interested in flying, so she received her pilot's licence. Gökçen was sent to Russia, together with seven male students, for an advanced course in glider and powered aircraft piloting. However, when she was in Moscow, she learned the news that Zehra had died, and with collapsed morale, she immediately returned to Turkey, isolating herself from social activities for some time.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Is Billy boy dead?' <b>She</b> <b>nods.</b> 'Was {{he killed}} in action? Tell me, tell me!' <b>She</b> <b>nods</b> again. 'Good for Billy boy. I knew Billy boy was all right. Don't cry, Ellen. I'll {{take care of}} you. All's well with Billy boy.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nothing but blank paper! Is {{this your}} writing in pencil on the envelope?' <b>She</b> <b>nods,</b> {{and he gives}} the matter further consideration.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then Mr. Wahrfield {{handed her}} a string of foreign dialect, and <b>she</b> <b>nods</b> her head and says, 'See, señor,' maybe fifty times, and lights out with the note.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mrs. Burrows, is it?" [...] <b>She</b> <b>nodded</b> her head. [...] "She is {{the mother}} of the man they call the Grinder?" [...] Again <b>she</b> <b>nodded</b> her head. [...] "It is he whom they accuse of the murder?" [...] Yet again <b>she</b> <b>nodded</b> her head. [...] "There was another man?" [...] <b>She</b> <b>nodded</b> it again. [...] "And they say that there was a third," [...] he said,--"your brother Sam." ...|$|E
60|$|After each {{question}} he paused, while <b>she</b> <b>nodded</b> an affirmation.|$|E
60|$|The girl, oddly, {{understood}} him. <b>She</b> <b>nodded</b> her head, affirmatively.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>nods</b> {{her head}} again, {{and after a}} short silence, quaintly bursts out with: ‘You know we must be married, and married from here, Eddy, or the poor girls will be so dreadfully disappointed!’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... (She takes Eileen {{aside and}} talks to her in low tones of [...] admonition. Eileen's face falls. <b>She</b> <b>nods</b> a horrified [...] acquiescence. Miss Gilpin leaves her and goes into the office, [...] rear.) ...|$|R
60|$|MORELL (turning from him). I shall {{want you}} to take some notes at the meeting, Miss Garnett, if you have no other engagement. (<b>She</b> <b>nods,</b> afraid to speak.) You are coming, Lexy, I suppose.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>nodded</b> again wonderingly. Then {{she caught}} his hand appealingly.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>nodded</b> again, with {{a return}} of her usual sweet composure.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>nodded,</b> {{an angry}} {{reminiscent}} flash in her eyes, and waited.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>nods</b> {{her head}} gravely, {{goes to the}} door of OLIVE'S room, [...] opens it gently, stands looking for a-moment, then with the [...] words [...] "My Lamb!" [...] she goes in noiselessly and closes the door.|$|R
60|$|PHILIP. Sh! Attention. (They put {{on their}} best manners. Philip adds in a lower voice to Gloria) If he's {{good enough for the}} lunch, I'll nod to Dolly; and if <b>she</b> <b>nods</b> to you, invite him {{straight}} away.|$|R
6000|$|The Lady, {{coming back}} to him: [...] "No; it must be roses, after all. I see that nothing else will do. What do you call those?" [...] <b>She</b> <b>nods</b> at a vase of roses on a shelf behind him.|$|R
60|$|He {{paused for}} a contradiction, but <b>she</b> <b>nodded</b> her head in agreement.|$|E
60|$|I drew {{a little}} closer to her. <b>She</b> <b>nodded</b> again several times.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>nodded</b> sympathetically. They were {{on their}} way down the broad staircase.|$|E
6000|$|Hippona lets no silly flush [...] Disturb her cheek, nought {{makes her}} blush. [...] Whate'er obscenities you say, [...] <b>She</b> <b>nods</b> and titters frank and gay. [...] Oh Shame, awake one honest flush [...] For this,--that nothing makes her blush.|$|R
60|$|PHILIP (maturely). No, Dolly: my {{knowledge}} of human nature confirms Mr. Valentine's judgment. He is right. Let me introduce Miss Dorothy Clandon, commonly called Dolly. (Valentine bows to Dolly. <b>She</b> <b>nods</b> to him.) I'm Philip Clandon. We're from Madeira, but perfectly respectable, so far.|$|R
6000|$|The Water-midden peeped {{out between}} her hair, {{and laughed and}} clapped her hands. [...] "Oh, but if I might but hold it in my hand one moment, I think that I should never even sigh again!" [...] said <b>she.</b> <b>Nod's</b> fingers closed on the Wonderstone again.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>nodded,</b> and on they rushed, the ever-freshening gale {{on their}} beam.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>nodded,</b> with {{an attempt}} at {{brightness}} which was a little pitiful.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>nodded.</b> A {{faint smile}} of {{bitterness}} had stolen into her tone.|$|E
6000|$|MURRAY (instantly {{struck by}} this suggestion). You mean--I could write--up here? (<b>She</b> <b>nods.</b> His face lights up with enthusiasm.) Say! That is an idea! Thank you! I'd {{never have had}} sense enough to have thought of that myself. (Eileen flushes with pleasure.) Sure there's time--nothing but time up here---- ...|$|R
6000|$|... (Knox accompanies her silently to {{the door}} and places hand on knob.) I wish I had {{something}} of you to have with me always--a photograph, that little one, you remember, which I liked so. (<b>She</b> <b>nods.)</b> Don't run the risk of sending it by messenger. Just mail it ordinarily.|$|R
6000|$|CRAMPTON (angry). What! (Her odd {{expression}} {{does not}} alter. He surrenders.) Well, yes, my dear: I suppose it is, I suppose it is. (<b>She</b> <b>nods</b> sympathetically.) I'm afraid I'm sometimes a little irritable; but I know what's right and reasonable all the time, even when I don't act on it. Can you believe that? ...|$|R
60|$|He {{looked up}} at her sharply. <b>She</b> <b>nodded</b> slowly, like a {{porcelain}} mandarin.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>nodded</b> {{and replied}} that doubtless the symbol {{had come down}} to them.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>nodded,</b> and {{commenced}} to dry {{her eyes}} with a little lace handkerchief.|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Do I not?’ she cried, {{and fell}} once more into delicious laughter. But from this access she more speedily recovered. ‘This {{is all very}} well,’ said <b>she,</b> <b>nodding</b> at him gravely, ‘but I am still in a most {{distressing}} situation, from which, if you deny me your help, I shall find it difficult indeed to free myself.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|Dame Fairy <b>she</b> <b>nods,</b> {{and cries}} clear and sweet, [...] "'Tis a very good-e'en, sir, when such folks meet. [...] I know thee, Sam, thou though wist not of me, [...] And I'm come in late gloaming {{to speak with}} thee; [...] Though my eyes do dazzle at glint of your rush, [...] All under this pretty green fuchsia bush." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The covey told me {{you were}} a charwoman; so I suppose you picked the {{envelopes}} out of waste-paper baskets, or such like, and then changed the addresses?' <b>She</b> <b>nods</b> again; still <b>she</b> dare not look up, but she is admiring his legs. When, however, he would cast the letters into the fire, she flames up with sudden spirit. She clutches them.|$|R
