5000|$|Spencer was {{descended from}} Thomas Spencer, an early settler of Hartford, Connecticut, {{who died in}} 1687. Around 1786, Spencer's father moved to the Rupert, Bennington, County, Vermont. Spencer was born there, the {{youngest}} but one of eleven children. Those who knew Spencer in his youth contended that [...] "he belonged to the class of careless, thoughtless, and gay young men". His father, a farmer, died while Spencer was young, and he thereafter moved to Granville, Washington County, New York, where he engaged in manual labor for something like a year. During this year, a revival of religion visited this town, and <b>Spencer</b> became a <b>Christian.</b> He was encouraged to enter the ministry, and undertook to do so. He entered Union College in 1819, graduating in 1822.

500|$|After {{their mother}} Paula (Maeve Quinlan) {{takes on a}} new job, the Carlin family moves {{from a small town}} in Ohio to Los Angeles, California. The three Carlin {{siblings}} start at King High School, where they each try to fit in. Glen (Chris Hunter), a talented basketball player, tries out for the school basketball team, upsetting the star player Aiden Dennison (Matt Cohen) and his cheerleader girlfriend Madison Duarte (Valery Ortiz). Tensions between Glen and Aiden escalate into a locker room fight over Aiden's ex-girlfriend Ashley Davies (Mandy Musgrave), and Glen takes the spotlight in his first game, leaving Aiden on the bench. Glen's sister <b>Spencer</b> (Gabrielle <b>Christian)</b> joins the cheerleading squad but ends up doing little more than take orders from Madison. She befriends the rebellious Ashley, but when Ashley indicates her interest in girls, Spencer starts to avoid her, only to admit later that she enjoyed their time spent together.

After Clay strikes up a conversation with a girl named Chelsea Lewis (Aasha Davis), he is beaten up by her ex-boyfriend Dallas (Marcus Brown) when Clay tries to defend her. He then earns the respect of Sean Miller (Austen Parros), who is cynical about the way African Americans are treated in society, and when they go driving they are pulled over by the police for [...] "driving while black".|$|R

25|$|In essence Spencer's {{philosophical}} {{vision was}} formed {{by a combination of}} deism and positivism. On the one hand, he had imbibed something of eighteenth century deism from his father {{and other members of the}} Derby Philosophical Society and from books like George Combe's immensely popular The Constitution of Man (1828). This treated the world as a cosmos of benevolent design, and the laws of nature as the decrees of a 'Being transcendentally kind.' Natural laws were thus the statutes of a well governed universe that had been decreed by the Creator with the intention of promoting human happiness. Although <b>Spencer</b> lost his <b>Christian</b> faith as a teenager and later rejected any 'anthropomorphic' conception of the Deity, he nonetheless held fast to this conception at an almost sub-conscious level. At the same time, however, he owed far more than he would ever acknowledge to positivism, in particular in its conception of a philosophical system as the unification of the various branches of scientific knowledge. He also followed positivism in his insistence that it was only possible to have genuine knowledge of phenomena and hence that it was idle to speculate about the nature of the ultimate reality. The tension between positivism and his residual deism ran through the entire System of Synthetic Philosophy.|$|R
500|$|The {{following}} year, O'Hara appeared opposite James Stewart in Mr. Hobbs Takes a Vacation, about {{a family}} vacation in a dilapidated house on the beach. She played Peggy, the token wife of Hobbs (Stewart), a character who is very family-oriented and talkative. Though the two became friends, O'Hara confessed {{that she was not}} happy with the dynamic between her and Stewart onscreen, commenting that [...] "every scene revolves around Jimmy Stewart. I was never allowed to really play out a single scene in the picture. He was a remarkable actor, but not a generous one". With the success of The Parent Trap and Mr. Hobbs Takes a Vacation, O'Hara felt that her career had been given a new lease of life. She united with Henry Fonda after 20 years to appear in Spencer's Mountain (1963), roughly based on the novel by Earl Hamner, Jr.. The film was shot on location in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, the same place that the classic 1953 western Shane was shot. O'Hara played Olivia <b>Spencer,</b> the devout <b>Christian</b> wife of Fonda's atheist character, who {{during the course of the}} film sings a hymn at an outdoor funeral. Though Malone considers her to have given a [...] "commendable performance", he thought she lacked chemistry with Fonda and notes that the film came at a difficult period in his life, with the breakdown of his third marriage. It was poorly received by the critics at the time but fared well at the box office. Later in 1963 she starred with John Wayne in Andrew V. McLaglen's Technicolor comedic western, McLintock!. O'Hara performed many of her own stunts in the film, including one scene where she falls backwards off a ladder into a trough.|$|R

O'Hara played a British woman who leaves her diplomat husband in England for an Italian pianist (Brazzi). She had high expectations for the film but soon realized that Brazzi was miscast. During the production O'Hara witnessed a robbery taking place nearby at jewellery store nearby in Milan. She was so frustrated with the finished film, which was a box office flop, that she cried. O'Hara made her last picture with James Stewart the following year in the comedic western, The Rare Breed. Malone thought that she modeled her performance on Julie Andrews, [...] "adopting a schoolmarmish voice and demeanor that ill befit her", and coming out with pious statements like [...] "cleanliness is next to godliness".|$|R
