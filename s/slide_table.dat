Especially, autocollimators are often employed in the manufacturing process of linear slides since they can continue their measurement even if their measurement laser beams are interrupted by operators for the hand scraping process. In addition, autocollimators have advantage of high measurement resolution {{on the order of}} sub arc-second [17 – 21]. In the case of measuring the yaw error motion by using an autocollimator, a small mirror reflector will be mounted on a <b>slide</b> <b>table,</b> while an optical sensor head of the autocollimator will be aligned {{in such a way that}} the optical axis will be parallel with the motion axis of the <b>slide</b> <b>table.</b> The setup for this measurement is not so difficult since the required size of the reflector is small.|$|E
30|$|For {{measurement}} of roll error motion of a <b>slide</b> <b>table</b> in a precision linear slide during its manufacturing process, a new measurement method using {{a pair of}} clinometers has been proposed, and its feasibility has been verified in experiments.

30|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{measurement}} method {{for evaluation of}} the roll error motion of a precision linear slide by using a high resolution fluid-based type clinometer in the production process of the stage system. The clinometer used in this research is developed based on a commercially-available fluid type clinometer [29], which detects the surface level of the liquid enclosed inside of the sensor body. Since the clinometer detects the absolute angle {{with respect to the}} direction of gravitational vector, clinometer detects not only the roll error motion of a <b>slide</b> <b>table</b> but also external inclination such as tilt angle of a vibration isolation table where the linear slide is mounted. In order to remove the influence of the external inclinations, in this paper, another clinometer is directly mounted on the vibration isolation table. By taking a differential output signal of the two clinometers, the roll error motion of the <b>slide</b> <b>table</b> can be evaluated, while eliminating the influence of the external disturbances mainly from the vibration isolation table. An experimental setup employing the pair of clinometers is developed, and experiments are carried out to verify the feasibility of the proposed method.|$|E
30|$|By {{using the}} {{calibrated}} clinometers, the roll error {{motion of the}} precision linear slide was then evaluated in experiments. The setup shown in Figure  10 was also employed in the experiments. As shown in the figure, the Sensor 1 was mounted on the <b>slide</b> <b>table,</b> while the Sensor 2 was directly fixed on the vibration isolation table. Since the measurement range of each clinometer was set to be small for enhancement of the measurement resolution, Sensor 1 and 2 were mounted on different manual tilt stages independently. The stage roll error motion was evaluated by using both the developed clinometers and the commercial laser autocollimator, which was employed as a reference in the experiments. Since the commercial autocollimators cannot measure roll motion of a linear slide with a long stroke due {{to the absence of}} a precision mirror having a length comparable with the slide, a linear stage with a short stroke of 45  mm was employed in this paper. A precision reflective mirror with the length of 100  mm was also mounted on the <b>slide</b> <b>table</b> so that slide roll motion could be measured by the commercial laser autocollimator.|$|E

During the last several decades, thermal error compensation technology has significantly reduced thermal distortion error; this success has been attributed {{to the development of a}} precise, robust thermal error model.

However, successful application of thermal error modeling requires correct determination of the temperature sensor placement. In this paper, a procedure for predicting thermal-mode-based thermal error is introduced. Based on this thermal analysis, temperature sensors were positioned for multiple heat-source models.

30|$|However, on {{the other}} hand, {{measurement}} of roll error motion requires a long precision mirror, which has the same length as the stroke of the slide. Furthermore, when the stroke of the <b>slide</b> <b>table</b> becomes longer, a disturbance of refractive index in the long optical path influences measurement results. Therefore, {{it is difficult for}} a laser autocollimator to carry out measurement of the roll error motion of a linear slide having a long stroke. Meanwhile, a clinometer is another candidate for measurement of the roll error motion. There are three major types of clinometers; the mechanical pendulum-based type [22, 23], the accelerometer-based type [24], and the fluid-based type [25, 26]. The mechanical pendulum-based clinometers and the accelerometer-based clinometers have advantages of high resolution, large measurement range and small size. Some of those mechanical gravity-based clinometers are designed in a compact size of smaller than 75  mm[*]×[*] 40  mm[*]×[*] 45  mm, while achieving high resolution up to 0.1 arc-second with a good stability [27]. However, they are not suitable for measurement in the manufacturing process of the linear slides since these pendulum-based clinometers have the disadvantages of high cost, and heavy weight owing to its complex mechanism. Meanwhile, {{on the other}} hand, the fluid-type clinometers, which detect the direction of the gravity with a liquid surface [28], has the advantages of low cost, small size, and light weight compared with other types of clinometers. In addition, fluid-based type clinometers are robust against external vibration because of its non-mechanical structure. Therefore, the fluid-based type clinometers are suitable to be applied for the manufacturing process of the linear slides. Differing from the autocollimators, the fluid-based type clinometer does not require a mirror reflector because its angle reference is the level of liquid enclosed inside of the sensor body [27, 28]. By utilizing the feature of the clinometer, a setup for measurement of the roll error motion of the <b>slide</b> <b>table</b> in a long-stroke linear slide can therefore be established in a compact size; this is a great advantage from the viewpoint of the production line of the linear slides.|$|E

However, size fractionation on smear slides has been ob-served {{as a result of}} tooth-pick action on a slide (Wei, 1988). Beau-fort (1991; p. 415) stressed that “a count of relative abundance using smear slides is accurate only for species of similar size unless a large number of view fields are examined. ” To avoid the size fractionation of calcareous nannofossils during the preparation of smear slides, the settling method developed by Beaufort (1991) and Ehrendorfer (1993) is used. Neogene zonation of Okada and Bukry (1980) was used for the biostratigraphy (Table 1). Biostratigraphy was based on analysis of 371 Neogene (Pliocene to Pleistocene) samples from Cores 1 H through 8 H. Samples were selected at 20 -cm sampling intervals.

40|$|Mineral {{processing}} {{plants in the}} United States and throughout the world process material that is finely ground and placed into bags for shipping to the consumer. These bags normally range from 50 to 100 pounds in weight. Once the material is placed in these bags, a bag stacker loads the bags onto pallets. A bag stacker is exposed {{to a lot of}} dust that is mainly released by the force from loading the bag onto the pallet. The two main sources are the dust {{on the outside of the}} bag and the dust that escapes from inside the bag as it is loaded. The Mine Safety and Health Administration's (MSHA) records indicate the bag stacker's dust exposure is one of the highest of all workers at mineral processing operations. Ways to reduce the dust exposure and strain to the bag stacker are in constant development. Recently, automated systems have been built. These systems range from fully automated, which totally remove the worker from the bag-stacking process, to semi-automated systems, in which the bag stacker still performs some of the functions. This Hazard Control deals with controlling the bag stacker's dust exposure during use of a semi-automated palletizing machine. The worker slides the bags into position on the palletizing machine. Once an entire layer of bags is positioned, the bag stacker operates the controls on the palletizing machine to lower the layer of bags onto the pallet. An air slide is built into the semi-automated palletizing machine so the bags are easier to move. This slide uses a metal table with air jets that exit through small holes at high velocities, similar to an air hockey game. The dust problem occurs because the air slide causes dust to blow up onto the bag stacker, significantly increasing the dust exposure. NIOSH researchers became aware of this problem while working at a mineral processing operation that was having problems with a bag stacker who was overexposed to dust. The air slide on the semi-automated palletizing unit was determined to be the main cause for the high dust concentrations. The impact of the air slide on the bag stacker's dust exposure was found by using real-time dust monitors. Figure 1 shows the bag stacker's average respirable dust exposure while working with product bags of three different mesh sizes when the air slide was either on or off. The bag stacker's respirable dust exposure was 5 to 11 times higher when the air slide was on compared with when it was off. This mineral processing operation used an exhaust ventilation system with an exhaust hood at the back of the palletizing unit. The exhaust ventilation system was not powerful enough to immediately capture the dust blown up from the air slide. An overhead air supply island system (OASIS) was also used to provide an envelope of clean air over the bag stacker. The OASIS at this operation brings in outside air through two different filter stages and directs the clean air down over the bag stacker. This envelope of clean air was not powerful enough to overcome the dust that was being blown up into the bag stacker's breathing zone from the air slide. The key to lowering the bag stacker's dust exposure to MSHA-acceptable concentrations was to make a few simple changes and to slightly modify the bag stacker's work habits. The bag stacker had been leaning out over the air <b>slide</b> <b>table</b> and placing his upper torso in the front part of the exhaust ventilation system capture hood. Therefore, NIOSH researchers suggested that the exhaust hood be modified to make it physically impossible for the bag stacker to place his or her upper torso into the hood (Figure 2). The next modification involved installing plastic stripping around the perimeter of the OASIS. The plastic stripping gave the bag stacker a physical indication of the clean air boundary provided by the OASIS. Testing was repeated after the changes were made to the semi-automated palletizing system. This time, the testing showed that the changes to the system had minimized the impact of air slide contamination to the bag stacker. Once again, three product sizes of mesh bags were evaluated. No increase was found in the bag stacker's dust exposure with two of the products, and only a very slight increase was found with the other product. The changes made to the bag palletizing process accounted for the reductions of the bag stacker's respirable dust exposure to MSHA-acceptable dust concentrations. NIOSH researchers believe that all operators using this type of semi-automated palletizing system need to be aware of the serious dust contamination that can occur to the bag stacker from the air slide. To control high dust exposures from air slides on semi-automated palletizing units (Figure 3), make the following modifications: 1. Use an exhaust ventilation system with an effective hood design to capture the dust generated during the bag stacking process. 2. Use an OASIS to provide an envelope of clean air over the bag stacker. 3. Place plastic stripping around the OASIS to provide a boundary of the clean air from the system. 4. Modify the bag stacker's work practices to have the worker stay within the envelope of clean air provided by the OASIS. NIOSH No. 2002160...|$|E
