40|$|Stream ORBs: the fewer, {{the better}} For several working group {{meetings}} {{there has been}} convergent discussion on the desirability of radically simplifying isochronous operations by collapsing the two (presently described) isochronous fetch agents into a single one responsible for stream operations. The text that follows is my attempt to follow this thread to its logical conclusion. I intended to satisfy three usage models: − Simple devices, such as printers or scanners, which neither record (for subsequent playback) nor playback (from prior recording) streams but have a need to use isochronous, not asynchronous, mechanisms for data transfer; − Simple record and playback devices that operate on isochronous streams that contain a single channel; and − More sophisticated devices that may filter or mix multiple channels during recording or playback. I think that the revised stream <b>command</b> <b>block</b> ORB meets {{the requirements of the}} first two device classes and the addition of management ORBs for stream control satisfies the third class.

Thouémont, who had been previously posted to a machine gun battalion in the 149th and 132nd RIF, lacked specific training on Maginot systems. He replaced Captain André, a reservist and mayor of Villy, who had been promoted. Bourguignon was responsible for <b>command</b> of <b>Block</b> 1, {{as well as for}} overall command.

Other <b>commands</b> allow <b>blocks</b> to be renamed, expanded, etc., and also allow a flat file to be built from {{all or part of the}} structured file.|$|R

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of NATO is {{largely due to}} the existence of its integrated and multinational <b>command</b> <b>structure.</b> That <b>command</b> <b>structure,</b> the cement of the Alliance, derives from the mutual obligations contained in Article V of the North Atlantic Treaty. The publication of this compendium could not be more timely as a contribution to the debate which continues in NATO capitals. NATO is an alliance based on consensus. It is also the most effective military alliance in history; this {{is largely due to}} the existence of its integrated and multinational <b>command</b> <b>structure.</b> That <b>command</b> <b>structure,</b> the cement of the Alliance as it were, derives from the mutual obligations contained in Article V of the North Atlantic Treaty. This contractual obligation, which does not exist for the other missions which have arisen since 1990, means that the defense of NATO territory must be the basis of any restructuring. If we were to move away from this and thus weaken the <b>command</b> <b>structure,</b> even with the best intentions, then it is my firm conviction that we would do serious harm to the Alliance and its future. On the other hand, a modified <b>command</b> <b>structure,</b> still based on the Article V contractual obligation, provides a firm basis, as well as flexibility, versatility, and availability for any non- contractual, namely out-of-area, requirement. <b>Command</b> <b>structures</b> do not exist of their own accord. They come into being, change, and develop, to permit commanders at the appropriate level, from top to bottom, to orchestrate the application of military force at sea, in the air, and on land. There is, however, a limit to which one can impose responsibilities on commanders, who after all are personally responsible for the conduct of operations, and a limit to the amount of specialization and detail with which they can cope. This is why we have hierarchical <b>command</b> <b>structures</b> with each commander dealing with the appropriate level of competence. It is why at certain levels command should be joint and at others purely functional. How many levels of command are needed will be dictated by the operations factors of time, forces, and space...|$|R

50|$|In his book, James Mulvenon {{mentions}} the Joint Campaign Command Headquarters, which may take wartime responsibilities from 4PLA {{and may be}} organized into multiple “centers” that would direct and coordinate IW operations. These centers include comprehensive planning, electronic countermeasures, network warfare, information system defense, information security and secrecy, weapons and equipment support, and comprehensive support. One of the centers that Mulvenon mentions in detail is the Information Countermeasures Center, which he suggests 4PLA would have some involvement in. This center is composed of members from relevant services, likely including 4PLA. The center is responsible for providing advice, planning, and coordinating IW and countermeasure operations. Mulvenon states that personnel from 4PLA would be “trigger pullers” at the national and warzone levels of conflicts in this <b>command</b> <b>structure.</b> This <b>command</b> <b>structure</b> would only be applied during wartime, however, and information on the <b>command</b> <b>structure</b> during peacetime is not publicly available.|$|R
40|$|As told by lots of experts, {{programming}} {{is the new}} literacy. That {{is why it is}} important to introduce children to programming in early ages. The main topic of diploma is early programming learning. In theoretical part we consider the effects of early programming learning on children's mental structures and present the application Scratch Junior, which is intended for this purpose. ScratchJr is a freely accessible programming language designed to introduce younger generations into the world of programming. Users can create interactive projects with it and learn the concepts of programming in a fun way. The application is intended for children aged between 5 and 7 and is suitably adapted fort his purpose. Next chapter describes constructionism, a pedagogical theory developed by american mathematician, computer scientist and pedagogue Seymour Papert. Constructionism is based on idea of 'learning by making' which means that learning is most effective when part of an activity the learner experiences as constructing a meaningful product. Following the constructionism theory, we helped students of the second grade of elementary school made their first steps into the world of programming. Half of the class studied programming with the ScratchJr application, while the other half with the help of physical <b>command</b> <b>blocks.</b> We were determining if students using the ScratchJr application and physical <b>command</b> <b>blocks</b> adopt learning objectives and which method is more suitable for the first steps in the programming world. We have found that the constructive approach is very suitable for learning programming, since students build their knowledge in interaction with environment. According to constructionism, learning is most effective when a student constructs a meaningful product in the learning process. After the lesson learned, we found that all children have adopted the set learning goals, but also both od them have their advantages and disadvantages. In any case, both methods are suitable for early programming of programming. ...|$|R
