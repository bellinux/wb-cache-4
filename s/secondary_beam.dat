The target/beam tunnel, TCC8, and the cavern, ECN3, where the detectors of experiment NA48 have been installed, have a combined length of 270m. It is planned to reuse the existing target station, T10, (located 15m from the beginning of TCC8), and to install the <b>secondary</b> <b>beam</b> along the existing (straight) K12 beam line, of length 102m to the exit of the final collimator, which marks the beginning of the decay fiducial region and points to the NA48 detectors (notably the liquid krypton electro-magnetic calorimeter, LKR).|$|E

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{features}} of the planned FAIR facility will be the availability of high quality <b>secondary</b> <b>beams</b> of antiprotons and rare isotopes. The preparation of these beams is achieved in the complex of the three storage rings CR, RESR and NESR. These rings are equipped with beam cooling systems for pre-cooling, accumulation and final cooling of the <b>secondary</b> <b>beams.</b> The ion optical design of the storage rings is guided by {{the requirements of the}} cooling systems. Other systems, like rf systems are inte-grated into the cooling procedures. Deceleration will offer <b>secondary</b> <b>beams</b> over a large range of energies down to particles at rest.

50|$|In ion-assisted {{deposition}} (IAD), {{the substrate}} {{is exposed to}} a secondary ion beam operating at a lower power than the sputter gun. Usually a Kaufman source, like that used in IBS, supplies the <b>secondary</b> <b>beam.</b> IAD {{can be used to}} deposit carbon in diamond-like form on a substrate. Any carbon atoms landing on the substrate which fail to bond properly in the diamond crystal lattice will be knocked off by the <b>secondary</b> <b>beam.</b> NASA used this technique to experiment with depositing diamond films on turbine blades in the 1980s. IAD is used in other important industrial applications such as creating tetrahedral amorphous carbon surface coatings on hard disk platters and hard transition metal nitride coatings on medical implants.|$|E
5000|$|A FRagment Separator (FRS) - The GSI Fragment Separator or FRS is a {{facility}} built in 1990. It produces and separates different beams of (usually) radioactive ions.

50|$|In musical notation, a beam is a {{horizontal}} or diagonal line used to connect multiple consecutive notes (and occasionally rests) to indicate rhythmic grouping. Only eighth notes (quavers) or shorter can be beamed. The number of beams {{is equal to}} the number of flags that would be present on an unbeamed note. Beaming refers to the conventions and use of beams. A primary beam connects a note group unbroken, while a <b>secondary</b> <b>beam</b> is interrupted or partially broken.|$|E
50|$|SIMS is {{a common}} method used in U-Pb analysis, as the primary ion beam is used to bombard {{the surface of a}} single zircon grain in order to yield a <b>secondary</b> <b>beam</b> of Pb ions. The Pb ions are {{analyzed}} using a double focusing mass spectrometer that comprises both an electrostatic and magnetic analyzer. This assembly allows the secondary ions to be focused based on their kinetic energy and mass-charge ratio in order to be accurately collected using a series of Faraday cups.|$|E

40|$|The method {{involves}} irradiating {{the surface}} of the test object perpendicularly with a primary X-ray <b>beam.</b> The <b>secondary</b> X-rays diffracted by the object are detected by the detection device. The distance between the primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>beams</b> in the plane of the detection device is determined for <b>secondary</b> X-ray <b>beams</b> diffracted at different families of crystal structure main planes. After this the angle between the primary and secondary X-rays is determined for the different <b>secondary</b> X-ray <b>beams</b> and used to derive the distance between the test object and detection device.

50|$|The {{secondaries}} {{are then}} detected and analyzed outside the plasma. By curving the trajectories, {{the magnetic field}} separates secondaryions from primary ions. Because of this, only secondaries ionized at a given plasma position reach a given detector location.This allows the HIBP to make measurements localized to the ionization position.The secondary current is related to local electron density and the ionization cross-section of the primary ions, which is itselfa function of the electron temperature. The electric potential {{can be obtained from}} the energy difference between primary and secondaryion beams. The energy of the <b>secondary</b> <b>beam</b> can be determined from the angle at which it enters the energy analyzer.|$|E
50|$|Point of Ayr {{also gives}} {{its name to}} a lighthouse, built in 1776, though {{inactive}} since 1883. It stands on Talacre beach, {{at the entrance to}} the River Dee estuary. The lighthouse once displayed two lights. The main beam, at 63 feet, shone seaward towards Llandudno. A <b>secondary</b> <b>beam</b> shone up the River Dee, towards the hamlet of Dawpool, in Cheshire, on the English side of the estuary. Whilst in service, the lighthouse was painted with red and white stripes, and had a red lantern housing. It was replaced in 1844 with a metal pile lighthouse, bearing a white light, put up by order of the Corporation of Trinity House. This new structure was itself replaced in 1883 with a lightship.|$|E

Designed building has L-shaped plan, flat roof and attic all the way around. The largest {{part of the plan}} area occupies office zone with dimensions of 48, 60 x 18, 90 m. Contiguous zone communication and sanitation has dimensions of 13, 50 x 15, 90 m. Floor height is designed 3, 60 m, the total height of the building is 18, 70 m. Composite steel floor structure consists of transverse primary <b>beams</b> and hinge-connected <b>secondary</b> <b>beams.</b> Integrated formwork (trapezoidal sheet) has ribs oriented perpendicular to the <b>secondary</b> <b>beams.</b> Coupling is bidirectional. Construction will be done in two variants. Variant No. 1 assumes primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>beams</b> (at the columns) hinge-connected with columns. In variant No. 2 will be frame connection between primary beams and columns and together they will create 2 D transverse frames with hinge-connected <b>secondary</b> <b>beams.</b> The supporting structure of the roof is designed similarly to ceiling, but reinforced concrete slab will be replaced with bracing in the roof plane and self-bearing rib sandwich panels. Vertical sheathing of the building provide sandwich panels and strip windows. The type of steel is S 355. The building is designed for the site Hradec Králové. Standards and documents used in design of the bearing structure are included in the list of sources.

50|$|Feathered beaming shows {{a gradual}} {{change in the}} speed of notes. It is shown with a primary {{straight}} beam and other diagonal <b>secondary</b> <b>beams</b> (that together resemble a feather, hence the name). These <b>secondary</b> <b>beams</b> suggest a gradual acceleration or deceleration from the first note value within the feathered beam to the last. The longest value possible to show being the eighth note (quaver). When the number of notes played is not of interest, but rather the effect of acceleration or deceleration, an approximate number of headless stems are used. To ensure clarity, sometimes the number of notes within the beam, or {{the duration of the}} total beamed notes, is shown above the music, as is done with tuplets.|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} an L-shaped beam structure and derive all the {{equations of motion}} considering also the rotary inertia terms. We show that the equations are decoupled in two motions, namely the in-plane bending and out-of-plane bending with torsion. In neglecting the rotary inertia terms the torsional equation for the <b>secondary</b> <b>beam</b> is fully decoupled from the other equations for out-of-plane motion. A numerical modal analysis was undertaken for two models of the L-shaped beam, considering two different orientations of the <b>secondary</b> <b>beam,</b> and it was shown that the mode shapes can be grouped into these two motions: in-plane bending and out-of-plane motion. We compared the theoretical natural frequencies of the <b>secondary</b> <b>beam</b> in torsion with finite element results which showed some disagreement, and also it was shown that the torsional mode shapes of the <b>secondary</b> <b>beam</b> are coupled with the other out-of-plane motions. These findings confirm {{that it is necessary}} to take rotary inertia terms into account for out-of-plane bending.

30|$|Vassart and Zhao (2011) {{present the}} results of two fire tests {{performed}} {{as part of an}} EU Commission-funded Leonardo Da Vinci project on “Fire Resistance Assessment of Partially Protected Composite Floors (FRACOF)”. The first of these tests was called the FRACOF test and was intended to investigate the applicability of the Cardington test conclusions for standard fires of longer duration (up to 120 minutes as opposed to 90 minutes), for different construction details, and for the effect of higher gravity loading applied during the fire. To investigate these issues, a single bay (intended to represent a corner bay of a larger structure) of a composite steel framed building was constructed. The building was one storey high and 8.74 m × 6.66 m in plan, with columns at the four corners, two primary beams spanning 6.6 m between the columns and four <b>secondary</b> <b>beams</b> spanning 8.74 m between primary beams. The 155 mm deep composite slab spanned 2.2 m between <b>secondary</b> <b>beams.</b> All four columns and the perimeter beams were fire protected, whereas the internal <b>secondary</b> <b>beams</b> and composite slab were left unprotected. Care was taken {{around the perimeter of the}} structure to ensure good connection between the composite slab and the perimeter beams.|$|R

Then, we present a lattice for a cooler ring for the <b>secondary</b> <b>beam.</b> The momentum compaction across half of this ring is near zero, while for the other half it is normal. Thus, bad mixing is minimized while good mixing is maintained for stochastic beam cooling...|$|E
