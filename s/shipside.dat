40|$|A climber’s way {{of seeing}} {{concentrates}} on verticality, with its varied and radical viewpoints. Cliff surfaces are seen in close proximity with intense points of focus. Kinaesthetic and corporeal knowledge interacts with cultural, imaginative, metaphoric and psychological dimensions, all informing a climber’s perceptions. This project responds to these experiences and concepts about place-making revealed through climbing and painting, as performative actions and representation. More specifically it explores the contribution of my perceptions and experiences as a rock climber {{to the construction of}} paintings of a locality, Cataract Gorge, a site of personal and cultural significance. In the construction of vertical views, the performative function of the image is highlighted through the bodily enactment of climbing movements and in the activity of materials and painting processes. Pictorial strategies extend traditional Western landscape representations, particularly conventions of the picturesque. Histories of representation of human/nature relationships involving climbing, heights or high places and concepts of the vertical sublime and the vertical imagination inform visual investigations. Initial paintings explored verticality through manipulation of format, composition and negative space that repositioned the artist’s/viewer’s point of view. Ink paintings on paper simulating the experience of verticality through the format of the work were developed in series and exhibited in traditional gallery style. The kinetic, expressive and responsive qualities of ink were emphasized with a focus on tactility, reflecting a climber’s intimate, temporal and sensory encounter with a site. Osmotic drying processes, the effects of gravity and directional movement reference both the dynamics of the site and those between a climber and a place. Analysis of paintings using photography as an investigative tool led to greater emphasis on the expressive potential of materiality and the spaces between components of painting. The actual walls act as a ground for the elements significant to a climber, which are cut out and pasted directly on the architectural surfaces in differing contexts. This breakdown of the frame challenged pictorial conventions and generated new ways of activating gallery spaces. These innovations marked a performative shift from how a place is seen to how a place is experienced by a climber, extending specific views into open speculation. The visual field references the related methodologies and concepts but contrasting mediums of Thomas Cooper and Dan <b>Shipsides.</b> Artists’ depictions of localities where I have climbed – by Von Guerard, Carleton Watkins, a traditional Chinese ink landscape scroll painting and Sidney Nolan – are used to differentiate and clarify my aims. Representations extending beyond singular views to multiple viewpoints include works by William Robinson, Tim Burns, Nancy Spero and Bea Maddock. Paintings by Lui Guo Song, Richard Kimberly and Neil Frazer influenced experimentation with the expressive potential in ink and negative spaces. Work by Christl Berg and Nancy Spero informed site specific and gallery based installations. The importance of the vertical vision, beyond challenging the Western landscape view, is its focus on the relationship between the physicality of both painting and climbing {{as a metaphor for the}} corporeal dimension of the experience of a place.

The loggers then stripped the redwood, prized for its resistance to rot and insects, of its branches, and split it into boards by drilling holes and stuffing them with dynamite. Teams of oxen lugged the lumber down the roads—including a Redwood Road so narrow, that many years later, every Sunday, according to one reminiscence, at least one Model T belonging to a picnicker would spin its wheels off the edge.

40|$|The {{northern}} {{areas are}} becoming more and more attractive because off the large oil and gas reservoir that is there. In this area there is a harsh environment and the possibility to collide with an iceberg increases as the number of vessels in the area increases. The project is a master thesis that was trying to find appropriate shapes of the contact area of an iceberg in relation with the ship scantlings that can be used for design against iceberg impacts. This thesis investigated an accident with a return period of 10 000 years, which correspond to an ALS (accidental limit state) type of event. This type of event allows for some plastic deformation in the structure as long as it does not danger human life, have significant pollution or financial consequences. By dividing the calculation in two, first by calculation of the energy in the iceberg relative to the ship and then impose the energy in a collision with the ship. To simulate the collision between the ship and the iceberg there were used non-linear finite element method by using the computer code LS-DYNA 971. The ship structure and iceberg were modeled in PATRAN with shell elements for the ship and solid elements for the iceberg. The icebergs were modeled as a cone with a radius in front where the angle of the cone and radius of the front were varied. The ice material was modeled with a material model that was developed by an earlier Phd. student at NTNU. This corresponds to a shared energy design of the ship according the NORSOK codes three categories. The three categories are ductile design, shared energy design and strength design. The <b>shipside</b> scantlings was also varied with a ship without ice strengthening, a 1 C ice strengthened ship and a 1 A ice strengthened ship. The ship structure was limited to only a section of the <b>shipside</b> modeled with an elasto-plastic material model. In the analysis the iceberg was pushed into the <b>shipside</b> with a constant speed and the forces, deformations and pressures were measured. The result was showing a tendency of that an iceberg with the largest radius in front equal to half of the web frame spacing and a cone angle higher than about 50 degrees was the most onerous for the <b>shipside,</b> but were not tested any icebergs with larger radius. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{assessment}} {{had been}} conducted for <b>shipside</b> collision against unstiffened, inclined jacket leg segment (column). The inclined column has been modelled with horizontal-to-vertical ratio of 1 / 7. Two types of boundary {{conditions of the}} column has been modelled; perfectly clamped boundary conditions (clamped or fixed) and boundary conditions with axial flexibility (axial spring). For clamped column, two different impact locations have been simulated, namely middle span impact and quarter span impact. For each impact location, three (3) design categories have been analysed; ductile design (Rigid Ship versus deformable column), integrated design (deformable ship versus deformable column), and strength design (Rigid column versus deformable ship). For rigid ship and integrated cases, three (3) column wall thicknesses had been simulated to present the transition from ductile to integrated and strength categories. From the force-displacement relationships, the force demanded to generate the same displacement both on the column and <b>shipside</b> is slightly higher for middle span impact than for quarter span impact, for all column wall thickness assessed herein. However, the resistance to indentation appeared to be significantly higher for middle span impact after the contact area had developed until over {{the height of the}} <b>shipside.</b> Considering the analysis results from fixed columns, the column with the wall thickness of 40 mm under middle span impact had been chosen as main representative model to reveal the influence of the axial flexibility to the capacity of the column. Two (2) types of the spring arrangement on each column-end have been modelled, namely the multiple springs and the single springs. For multiple springs type, two different spring coefficients have been evaluated, namely the equivalent and the unequal (nodal) spring stiffness. The spring coefficients are calculated according the analysis results generated on USFOS, taking only the linear elastic spring stiffness. The ‘real’ axial flexibility proved no major contribution to the overall resistance and deformation of the column. Therefore, assuming a fixed column is prudent for practical design. </p...|$|E

40|$|Over the years, {{the word}} stealth {{has been used}} more and more when {{discussing}} design and operational characteristics in military applications. New and more challenging techniques are constantly being applied to minimize signatures and thus hinder or delay detection and identification. The Visby Class Corvette is a multipurpose combat ship with 600 tons displacement. The hull is a sandwich construction of a PVC core with carbon fiber/vinyl laminate. The propulsion system consists of two identical CODOG machinery systems, each driving a KaMeWa 125 size Water Jet Unit. The Ship has special requirements for all signatures, i. e. Radar-, Hydro acoustics-, IR- and Magnetic Signature. The High Speed Machinery is twin Honeywell TF 50 A Gas Turbines, cantilever mounted {{side by side on}} the Main Reduction Gearbox housing. The Main Reduction Gearbox is a dual input high performance marine Gearbox designated MA - 107 SBS, designed and manufactured by Cincinnati Gear Co. The Low Speed Machinery is a MTU 16 V 2000 TE 90 Diesel Engine connected to the MRG by a power take in shaft. Combustion Air for the Gas Turbines is ducted from the <b>shipside</b> Air Inlet Screen (radar screen) via 3 -stage separating filters. The Exhausts from the twin Gas Turbines are combined into one Exhaust Pipe and ducted to the ship transom above the Water Jet stream. Very little can be changed in the Gas Turbine, but high quality such as well balanced rotating part contributes to reduce the signatures. However, the main work has to be accomplished by the building shipyard in cooperation with the Gas Turbine manufacturer. The Main Reduction Gearbox is more available for changes to reduce signatures, but even for the Gearbox the building shipyard has to take design and installation measures. The HSM installation consist mainly of the Gas Turbine Engine, the Main Reduction Gear, Water Jets Unit and surrounding equipment such as main shaft, bearings and so on. The emphasis in this paper is on the GT, MRG and their effect on some of the more well known signatures i. e. RCS, IR, Hydro acoustics and Magnetic. Also some design measures are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{capability}} to provide automated, onboard Position, Navigation and Timing (PNT) data compliant with the accuracy, integrity, continuity and availability requirements {{in accordance to}} the different phases of vessel navigation is considered as one core element of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) e-Navigation strategy. This capability, known as resilience of the system, is fundamental for any system supporting safety of live critical maritime applications. In order to achieve the resilience, satellite based, <b>shipside</b> and landside components should be fused by an “integrated PNT system”. However, the heterogeneity of the ship sensors together with the long life-cycles of vessels constitutes a practical challenge {{for the design of}} an onboard PNT module. Therefore the German Aerospace Center (DLR) promotes an open and scalable architecture for the shipborne “PNT Module”, which serves as a front-end between an integrated PNT system and <b>shipside</b> applications like Integrated Navigation Systems (INS), the Automatic Identification System (AIS) and the Electronic Chart Display and Information System (ECDIS). As the core component of a PNT Module, the PNT Unit processes and integrates the data of radio navigation systems and services as well as shipborne sensors (like speed log, gyro compass). The goal of the PNT Module is the provision of PNT information and associated integrity information in accordance with changing performance requirements during berth to berth navigation, taking into account the different grades of ships navigational sensors. The application of data fusion techniques within the PNT Unit improves the resilience of PNT information and enables the accuracy estimation by integrity monitoring functions. In order to fulfill these objectives, the redundancy of PNT parameters should be provided by taking redundant sensors or by applying different measuring techniques. In a first development phase of the PNT Unit, following sensors and GNSS services are taken into consideration, including three GNSS receivers, non-dedicated GNSS compass composed of distributed antennas, code- and phase based differential GNSS (DGNSS) services, Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and other ship sensors. To perform a robust and efficient data fusion, two fundamental architectures can be considered. The first consists in the fusion of all the available data using a centralized filter. This method yields the optimality in the mathematic aspect. However, a modeling failure of a single sensor might fail the entire system. The other approach is a multi-channel architecture, where each channel is also a filter and fuses the data of a subset of sensors. Different channels are running independently, so that a sensor failure might only affect its own channel rather than the entire system. Considering that the sensors might have individual outages or synchronization problems, the multi-channel approach provides not only a higher resilience but also the simplicity in the algorithm design. Furthermore this architecture has the advantage being adaptable for different grades of ships navigational sensors, to support the scalability of carriage requirements, and to enable a stepwise rollout into the maritime traffic system. This paper focuses on the multi-channel system architecture of the PNT Unit. The minimal task of each channel is to provide position and velocity information regarding the consistent common reference point (CCRP). The attitude information is needed in order to transfer the position from its measuring point onto CCRP. Similar to that, the angular rate information is needed for the transformation of velocity information. Based on these requirements, following channels are implemented at the first stage: Channel type 1 : Single GNSS + GNSS compass. This is the basic configuration. Although a single GNSS (main GNSS antenna) allows the position and velocity estimation, multiple distributed GNSS antennas will construct the backup system in case that the main GNSS antenna does not work properly. Channel type 2 : Single GNSS +IMU+GNSS compass, where the integration of single GNSS and IMU is made with a tightly-coupled architecture and the attitude information from GNSS compass is integrated in a loosely-coupled architecture. This channel can work in almost any maritime operation area. The use of IMU will, at one hand, smooth the results from single GNSS, and on the other hand, enable the error detection in the GNSS measurement domain. Considering the long antenna baseline on the ship, the attitude estimation based on GNSS compass and IMU will provide more accurate attitude estimation than the conventional GNSS/IMU integration. Channel type 3 : IALA Beacon DGNSS+ IMU+ GNSS compass. This configuration can be applied if the correction data from an IALA Beacon DGNSS station are available. The DGNSS results are integrated with IMU output in a loosely-coupled architecture together with the attitude information from GNSS compass. Channel type 4 : Phase based (RTK) DGNSS+ IMU+ GNSS compass. This configuration yields the highest accuracy in the sub dm regime, but of cause requires data from a RTK reference station. The RTK results are integrated with the IMU output in a loosely-coupled architecture together with the attitude information from GNSS compass. This paper is structured as follows. Firstly, an overview of the multichannel architecture is given. Secondly each of the applied channels will be described in detail and investigated regarding its advantages and disadvantages. For this purposes test data are used, collected during a measuring trip, which was carried with the vessel “Baltic Taucher II” in the Baltic Sea. Based on the data analysis from this measurement campaign, we will present the results from different channels and show how the entire system can benefit from the multichannel approach...|$|E

Considering the {{experience}} of the Port of Port Elizabeth where waste volumes discharged from ships dropped drastically at the time when disposal tariffs had been increased due to a regional crisis, the question arises whether the waste {{that was supposed to be}} discharged in Port Elizabeth was instead dumped at sea. Objective. The integrated waste management framework was used as a basis to evaluate the level of understanding of the requirements of the International Marine Pollution (Annex V) regulation and South African waste management legislation within key stakeholders (Government, port and ship personnel) that have a crucial role to play over ship to port waste stream. Considering that the individual's level of understanding is in tacit form, which could be difficult to measure, the investigation focussed on responses received and the application of that understanding as reflected by various intervention strategies, such as processes, procedures and practices put in place as means of complying with legislation. Both ship and port side practices were investigated to assess the effectiveness of the above-mentioned intervention strategies across all waste management functional areas as outlined in Figure 1. This included an assessment of the application of a waste management hierarchy in Figure 2, availability of an audit trail (record of waste management strategies implemented en route), clear allocation of responsibility, and capacity building so as to confirm or rule out the possibility of illegal dumping at sea, in light of the Port of Port Elizabeth's experience and also to form a good basis to make recommendations towards future improvements. Sampling. A sample comprising 66. 6 % of the ships that called during daytime in the Port of Port Elizabeth, during the month of August 2003 were chosen randomly for interviews. Key role-players from the government and port were also interviewed as means of verifying facts around waste management practices from ship to port including legal enforcement issues. Results. It seemed as though the <b>shipside</b> clearly understands legal requirements and there are indications that they attempt to adhere to those however, due to the lack of enforcement, they have adopted casual stance as reflected by waste logbooks that are incompletely filled and some outdated. There seems to be more chaos on the portside since government authorities that are supposed to enforce legislation including the directive they issued on galley waste management, have a fragmented as opposed to holistic approach whereby each department understands and sticks to it's scope, leaving gaps in between that if allowed to continue unaddressed could result in toothless legislation. Conclusion. Due to the lack of visible legal enforcement, it is not possible to mle out the possibility of illegal dumping. The incompletely filled waste logbooks are the only reliable means of verifying that all waste generated on board the ship was indeed handled in a responsible manner and accounted for or not.

40|$|LNG is the {{preferred}} solution to meet environmental requirement and a great market growth is expected within few years. Lack of suitable infrastructure, regulation and bunkering practices poses challenges to the industry, however these barriers are currently being broken. Connect-LNG is in a conceptual phase of developing an innovative solution for LNG distribution and bunkering at inshore locations. A study of industry legislatives, normal industry practice, LNG properties and historical accident statistics, provided the basis needed to perform a HAZID of the concept. LNG is considered a hazardous cargo. The main hazards are identified as:?	Cryogenic temperatures (injury to people and to non cryogenic materials) ?	Fire, explosion or asphyxiation from potential LNG spillage?	Overpressure (thermal expansion and shock waves from potential Raphid Phase Transition (RPT) The main regulation related to the concept is ISO Interim TS 18683 - Guidelines for systems and installations for supply of LNG as fuel to ships, {{which is expected to}} enter into force during 2013. Additionally, NS-EN ISO 28460 Installation and equipment for liquefied natural gas ? Ship to shore interface and port operations and NS-EN 1473 European Norm for Installation and equipment for liquefied natural gas- Design of onshore Installation have shown high degree of relevance. Also, legislatives related to Ship-to-ship transfer are considered highly relevant. Safety requirements are generally imposed by the established regulates yielding large-scale LNG handling. However, the brutality of the consequences is often proportional to the quantity LNG handled, inherent safety. Thus for medium-to-small scale LNG facilities, the consequences of an unwanted event is assumed to be smaller. The following national regulative acts are important for the validation and responsibility decision between the relevant authorities: DSB topical guidelines, Major Accident regulations, The regulation of Fairways, The Port and Harbor Act. The authorities area of responsibility can be summarized in the following table:Authority	Responsibility DNV	LNG - carrier design approvalThe Norwegian Maritime Directorate	LNG - carrier operation and crew safety DSB	- Decisive power, approval of onshore facility and formal decision unit in the future. Inquire municipal authorities and public perceptionKystverket	 - Adequate safety in LNG carrier approaching area, ISPS Certification and piloting serviceMunicipal authorities - Decisive powerLocal port authorities - Decisive power, commonly landholderOperator (Skagerak Naturgass) - Responsible for safe operation, sufficient maintenance of facility according to given regulationThe conceivable safety distance for operation of the reel LNG can be summarized in the following table. Safety zone	DistanceOnshore, around LNG storage tank:	 25 metersAt sea, around the loading LNGC and buoy configuration: 50 metersAt sea, around the filling line: 12, 5 metersThe main, required inbound systems are listed below:-	ESD valve on buoy (Hydraulically self-contained) -	Breakoff coupling in the light loading hose-	QC/QD coupling towards the <b>shipside</b> -	Butterfly valves for normal operational control (open/close) -	Hose rupture safeguarding (to be located onshore) -	Riser annulus monitoring: Optical fibersThe results from the HAZID and from general industry feedback recommend a self-reliant system.

40|$|A new {{loading and}} {{discharge}} concept for ships, {{referred to as}} the Universal Buoyancy Concept (UBC), is proposed as an effective alternative to land based infrastructure for distribution of primarily LNG. The UBC system consists of a slack moored stepped spar buoy equipped with pads for <b>shipside</b> vacuum attachment. The buoy is connected to shore based tank facilities with a flexible cryogenic riser, thus providing opportunity for offshore loading and discharge of cryogenic liquids. In the following masters thesis, some hydrodynamic aspects of the UBC has been investigated with experimental methods. The model tests have been done in collaboration with fellow classmate Andreas Nilsen. A model test specification was prepared, where the objectives of the test and a detailed test plan was formulated. A model of the UBC was produced partially by MARINTEK and partially by Andreas and myself. A ship model was provided by MARINTEK and ballasted to a light loading condition for conservative ship motions. A rigid coupling arrangement between the ship and the buoy with possibility for measurement of interaction forces were installed in the ship model. Static pull-out tests for adjustment of a simple spring mooring system and decay tests were performed. Subsequently 4 headings were tested for regular waves and current. Afterwards, post-processing and analysis of the results has been conducted from scratch in Matlab. Results in this masters thesis consist of RAO&# 146;s of first order motions and interaction forces between UBC and the ship for coupled condition, RAO&# 146;s for independent and relative motion, estimation of current drag forces &# 150;and moments on UBC (including ship shadow effects), current forces on the coupled system, mean wave drift forces, and vortex induced vibrations on UBC. More information can be worked out from the results if needed. Head sea current gives the largest drag forces &# 150;and moments on UBC in coupled condition. Transverse current moments on UBC will be smallest with UBC placed downstream of the ship. Drag coefficients from measured mean drag moments are lower than those for a smooth circular cylinder in the same Reynolds number regime, though existing experimental results for stepped cylinders and cylinders with free end reports an increase in drag coefficient for these shapes compared to a smooth circular cylinder. It is speculated if the transducer is not sufficiently sensitive to the small force regime. Wave drift forces are considerable for beam sea conditions, nearly the same magnitude as current forces. For longer waves, the head sea condition is expected to be most critical with regard to wave drift depending on the ship size. Experimental values of drift forces are generally larger than conservatively predicted with Maruo&# 146;s formula (total reflection). It is crucial to model exact mass distribution for accurate results of linear motions of UBC. A reduction in mass radius of gyration from 12. 9 m to 7. 12 m gives order of magnitude tripled linear roll/pitch motions of UBC, and the natural roll/pitch period is reduced is reduced with 10 seconds, from 25. 8 to 15. 8 seconds. For the considered ship size, ship motions dominate UBC motions, especially in heave. Both horizontal and vertical relative motions are sharply increasing with wave period. Relative motion between UBC and ship is significantly smaller with UBC positioned on the leeward side of the ship, with horizontal motion halved for wave frequencies of 1. 3 rad/s. Moderate crossflow excitation forces at the theoretical vortex shedding frequency of the top cylinder are registered for current speeds of 0. 2 m/s (model scale). Hence top cylinder vortex shedding is assumed to dominate the crossflow forces. For model scale current speeds of 0. 3 m/s, crossflow excitation forces become powerful, and seem to lock on to the roll frequency of the ship. For lower current velocities, the natural roll period of UBC will be excited. Scaling of crossflow forces is difficult due to uncertainty in both Strouhals number and wake development for a stepped cylinder with free end at full scale Reynolds numbers. Beam sea conditions are the most critical condition with regard to first order ship-buoy reaction forces, and of the two, UBC on the windward side will be the worst. On the leeward side UBC is protected against both incoming and reflected waves. Ship roll motions are larger with UBC on the leeward side, suggesting that the dominating phenomenon contributing to reaction forces are inertia forces from the surface waves, not drag forces from ship-induced forced linear motions of UBC. It is acknowledged that forces and especially moments are over-estimated due to the rigid coupling. Fourier analysis of time series has revealed second order effects at twice the wave frequency in a majority of both interaction force and motion measurements. The wave profile is investigated and found to display similar, but less significant second order effects. It is believed that a second order wave profile develops from a first order as it travels down the tank. In retrospect, a Fourier analysis of the wave profile at the location of the test setup and closer to the wavemaker could be conducted as part of the calibration of environments. </p...|$|E
