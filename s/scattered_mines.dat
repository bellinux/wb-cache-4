"The enemy {{employed}} [...] "nuisance mining," [...] that is, <b>scattering</b> <b>mines</b> throughout an area {{rather than}} in well-defined minefields, on a scale never before encountered by U.S. forces. Mines and booby traps were usually installed at night by trained personnel who had detailed knowledge of the terrain.

50|$|The town {{passed into}} the hands of the Palizzi family, who held it until 1353, when the Gioiemi of Novara took possession. Between 1720 and 1880, the {{territory}} endured heavy mining activity. The 26 <b>scattered</b> <b>mines</b> used a great quantity of lumber, destabilized the land and degraded the mountains. Additionally, continuous flooding had devastating consequences. Major floods in 1880, 1951, 1958 and 1973 continued the territorial degradation.|$|E

50|$|Serious mining of {{crocidolite}} in these mountains started in 1893 when open-cast quarrying produced 100 tons of material. By 1918 underground mining had started and <b>scattered</b> <b>mines</b> {{were to be}} found from Prieska to Kuruman {{along the length of}} the range, and mills were constructed at both of these towns. Between 1950 and 1960 production had risen to 100,000 tons, each mine was doing its own milling and the tailings dumps had grown in size.|$|E
50|$|Other {{remains at}} the site include the {{foundations}} of the Hermosa Mill, an assay office, a small church, a two-room schoolhouse, the remains of an adobe house/pool hall located on the outskirts of town, and two small cemeteries. Several other partial wood and adobe structures, as well as <b>scattered</b> <b>mining</b> remnants, are also located throughout the area. Of the remains, the cemeteries and the nearby adobe ruin are most easily accessible, as they are on the side of Harshaw Road, today designated as Forest Route (FR) 49.|$|R
50|$|MAUS (Mina Antiuomo Seminabile) is an Italian {{designed}} anti-personnel <b>scatter</b> <b>mine.</b> A plastic {{high explosive}} landmine, {{it is designed}} for rapid placement on the minefields either by helicopter, hand-drop or other ground vehicle.

Some anti-tank mine types are also able to be triggered by infantry, giving them a dual purpose even though their main and official intention is to work as anti-tank weapons.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper proposes an IR {{camera system}} that {{performs}} {{the task of}} removing mines for humanitarian purposes. Because of the high risks involved, {{it is necessary to}} conduct mine detection from the most remote endeavoring. By making use of infrared ray (IR) cameras, <b>scattered</b> <b>mines</b> can be detected from remote locations. In the case of mines buried in the ground, detection is possible if the peripheral temperature difference is large enough between the ground and mine weapon. Tests with trial mines were used to study the detection characteristics of IR cameras for images and various technologies for collecting and processing image data in real time for optimum mine detection...|$|E
50|$|One locally used {{postage stamp}} from this period bears {{mentioning}} because it shows Argentina's lack of national consolidation in the nineteenth century, especially in the distant reaches of the territory: the Tierra del Fuego local stamps. These were issued by a Rumanian mining engineer named Julius Popper, who in 1891 prepared his own postage stamps {{to cover the cost}} of postage from the <b>scattered</b> <b>mining</b> camps of Tierra del Fuego to the closest points of the Argentine or Chilean postal system in Sandy Point (Punta Arenas), on the Strait of Magellan, or Ushuaia on the Beagle Channel. The Popper locals were not recognized by the central government in Argentina or Chile, which required that their own stamps be added once letters from the Popper mining camps entered their postal system. The stamp itself is well-designed, with mining tools, the “Tierra del Fuego” label, and a partially hidden letter “P” for Julius Popper.|$|R

5000|$|The movie {{portrays the}} story of a space ranger named Dogen (played by Jeffrey Byron), who is in search of an intergalactic {{criminal}} with supernatural powers named Jared-Syn (played by Michael Preston). He has tracked this individual to a desert planet called Lemuria. The planet's human population lives in <b>scattered</b> <b>mining</b> towns, gathering valuable crystals which seem to be the basis for their technology and economy. Syn has posed as the leader of a strange group of nomadic humanoids called the [...] "One Eyes" [...] - so named because they symbolically gouge out one of their eyes - who are descendants of a vanished culture called the Cyclopians. The territorial nomads have begun a holy war to drive the human miners from their lands. Syn has instigated this crusade, but Dogen knows that Syn's plan is really to enslave them all and seeks to stop him at all cost. Syn equips his nomads with strange red crystals that drain the life out of touched victims. Dogen searches Lemuria's wastelands for Syn's camp, traveling in an armored vehicle which looks like a road-warrioresque SUV.|$|R
60|$|Six dead forms lay at {{the foot}} of the oak, side by side, with their pale faces turned upwards, and the {{expression}} of extreme suffering still lingering on their shrunken features. It needed no living witness to tell their sad history. The skeletons of oxen, the broken cart, the <b>scattered</b> <b>mining</b> tools, and the empty provision casks, shewed clearly enough that they were emigrants who had left their homesteads in the States, and tried to reach the gold-regions of California by the terrible overland journey. They had lost their way among the dreary fastnesses of the mountains, travelled far from the right road to the mines, and perished at last of exhaustion and hunger on the very borders of the golden land. The grey-haired father of the family lay beside a young girl, with his arm clasped round her neck. Two younger men also lay near them, one lying as if, in dying, he had sought to afford support to the other. The bodies were still fresh, and a glance shewed that nearly all of them were of one family.|$|R

40|$|<b>Scattered</b> <b>mining</b> was practised on Kusasalethu Mine (previously Elandsrand Gold Mine) {{prior to}} 1998, but as mining {{proceeded}} deeper, {{it was no}} longer a feasible option. The <b>scattered</b> <b>mining</b> method would have resulted in unacceptably high stress levels and energy release rates on the active mining faces. Longwall mining was considered as it was practiced on neighbouring mines. This would have ensured that energy and stress levels remained within acceptable limits and avoided the formation of remnants at depth. Kusasalethu Mine required a more flexible mining method owing to the highly variable grade, the presence of multiple faults and dykes and the high production rate required. A mining method was therefore developed that consisted of dip stabilizing pillars for regional support as well as bracket pillars to support geological structures. This was called the Sequential Grid mining method. Sequential Grid mining addressed two main problems, namely, negotiating the adverse geology and the erratic grade of the VCR orebody. However, a recent drop in production resulted in the need for alternatives and improvements to the original mining layout. This involved modifications to the design in order to increase production rates without any compromise to safety. An investigation to modify for the Sequential Grid mining method was therefore conducted by the author {{in order to determine the}} consequences for layout stability. A few alternatives were investigated to determine the best possible solution for the Sequential Grid design. As a result, the modified Multi-raise mining method was introduced to address the problems that were experienced with the original design. This study compared the original mining method and the Multi-raise mining with regards to layout stability. Investigation of the seismic data showed no significant differences between the original Sequential Grid mining and the proposed Multi-raise mining. The numerical modelling of the mining layouts showed slightly higher interim Energy Release Rates (ERR) and Average Pillar Stress (APS) levels during the extraction process. The final values for these parameters are nevertheless similar to the original Sequential Grid mining method. It is therefore concluded that the Multi-raise mining method will not have adverse effects on the mine stability. It is concluded that changes to the original Sequential Grid mine design are possible without influencing the seismic hazard. In addition the anticipated interim increases in ERR and APS levels could be kept within acceptable levels through slight decreases to the extraction ratio. The concept of an average value for the stress distribution in a remaining portion of solid rock (pillars) surrounded by underground mining excavations is used as the rock engineering design parameter called average pillar stress (APS). Although averages are generally simple to calculate given the availability of appropriate data, average values for the stress distributed with pillars is somewhat more complex especially when working in MINSIM 2000 is proposed to ensure that the calculation of APS is done appropriately. The study also investigated the use of the Modelled magnitude method to analyse future seismic trends. The study illustrated that the expected seismic trends will be very similar for the Multi-raise method compared to the original Sequential Grid mining method.
