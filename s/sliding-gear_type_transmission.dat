40|$|Abstract: Wind load {{is the key}} and {{sensitive}} for tower structure but national standards {{tend to think that}} level stiffness change of cup <b>type</b> <b>transmission</b> tower is uniform along the height. The structure stiffness change of cup <b>type</b> <b>transmission</b> tower was simulated innovatively and found its nonuniformity. The result shows that the structural stiffness uniformly changes along the height when the flow direction parallel to the cross arm while the stiffness of crank arm and cross arm has mutations when the flow direction is vertical to the cross arm. Horizontal stiffness change causes a significant change of wind vibration coefficient. A simulation analysis was performed about wind-induced response of cup-tower to obtain the change rule of wind vibration coefficient. Furthermore, proposed the approximate calculation formula of wind vibra-tion coefficient at crank arm and cross arm...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Motorcycle is invented so {{far more}} than 100 years. Because of having the {{advantages}} of light weight, cheap and fast-moving, motorcycle becomes the most popular traffic vehicle. Traditionally, the power systems of motorcycles are internal combustion engines. Recently, due to the reason of energy-saving, and carbon reduction, the engine in motorcycle is substituted by electric motor. Hence, due to the reason of pollution-free, electric motorcycle {{become more and more}} popular in city traffic. Planetary gear trains can be used as the transmission systems for electric motorcycles. The purpose of this work is to do the kinematic design of three-speed planetary gear <b>type</b> automatic <b>transmissions</b> for electric motorcycles. First, according to the train value equation of planetary gear train, The reduction ratio equations of planetary gear <b>type</b> automatic <b>transmissions</b> can be derived. Then, based on these reduction ratio equations, the kinematic design of three-speed planetary gear <b>type</b> automatic <b>transmission</b> is accomplished. Based on the proposed methodology, all three-speed planetary gear <b>type</b> automatic <b>transmissions</b> can be synthesized...|$|R
40|$|Heterogeneity in {{the number}} of {{potentially}} infectious contacts amongst members of a population increases the basic reproduction ratio (R- 0) and markedly alters disease dynamics compared to traditional mean-field models. Most models describing transmission on contact networks only account for one specific route of transmission. However, for many infectious diseases multiple routes of transmission exist. The model presented here captures transmission through a well defined network of contacts, complemented by mean-field <b>type</b> <b>transmission</b> amongst the nodes of the network that accounts for alternative routes of transmission. The impact of these combined transmission mechanisms on the final epidemic size is investigated analytically. The analytic predictions for the purely mean-field case and the transmission through the network-only case are confirmed by individual-based network simulations. There is a critical transmission potential above which an increased contribution of the mean-field <b>type</b> <b>transmission</b> increases the final epidemic size while an increased contribution of the transmission through the network decreases it. Below the critical transmission potential the opposite effect is observed...|$|R
