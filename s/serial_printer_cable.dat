50|$|The early Tandy 1000's used a {{non-standard}} card-edge parallel {{printer port}} rather than industry standard DB-25 printer port. It required a Tandy-1000 compatible <b>printer</b> <b>cable</b> {{to connect to}} a standard printer parallel port.|$|R
50|$|The StyleWriter was {{the first}} of Apple's line of inkjet <b>serial</b> <b>printers,</b> {{targeted}} mainly towards consumers. The feed mechanism was removable, and paper could be fed through manually in a virtually straight line.|$|R
50|$|HC200 Dot Matrix Printer.This unit {{can be used}} {{to produce}} {{waveform}} plots as well as capturing setup information. It can be attached directly to the scope with a <b>printer</b> <b>cable,</b> so a GPIB is not required.|$|R
50|$|DECserver 250The DECserver 250 was {{a network}} server for {{printers}} for Ethernet Local Area Networks, {{consisting of a}} single box that provided the following: (2) Digital Parallel printer ports, each of which used a male 37-pin connector, (4) EIA RS-232-C/CCITT V.24 asynchronous line interfaces for connecting three <b>serial</b> <b>printers</b> and one <b>serial</b> <b>printer</b> or terminal, and (1) Ethernet interface transceiver port. The DECserver 250 implemented the Local Area Transport (LAT) protocol for communication with service nodes that implemented this protocol on the same Ethernet. Software that ran on the DECserver 250 was down-line loaded over the network from a Phase IV DECnet load host.|$|R
50|$|The StyleWriter 1200 was {{the third}} of Apple's line of inkjet <b>serial</b> <b>printers,</b> {{released}} after the StyleWriter II. Based on the same Canon engine, this model had faster printing speed than its predecessor, but used the same ink cartridge.|$|R

5000|$|Historically, a {{terminal}} server was {{a device that}} attached to serial RS-232 devices, such as [...] "green screen" [...] text terminals or <b>serial</b> <b>printers,</b> and transported traffic via TCP/IP, Telnet, SSH or other vendor-specific network protocols (e.g., LAT) via an Ethernet connection.|$|R
50|$|Connectors {{mounted on}} DTE {{are likely to}} be male, and those mounted on DCE {{are likely to be}} female (with the cable {{connectors}} being the opposite). However, this is far from universal; for instance, most <b>serial</b> <b>printers</b> have a female DB25 connector, but they are DTEs.|$|R
50|$|The COMX Printer card allowed {{connection}} of parallel and <b>serial</b> <b>printers.</b> Depending on {{what type of}} printer was connected the firmware ROM was selected either with the parallel firmware between memory location @C000-@CFFF and the serial firmware between memory location @D000-@DFFF or the other way around.|$|R
50|$|Radio Shack {{sold the}} Tandy DMP-130A dot matrix {{printers}} {{to go along}} with their Tandy 1000 line, along with compatible card-edged <b>printer</b> <b>cable.</b> This <b>printer</b> was sold at home budget prices. Radio Shack often offered a package bundle with a Tandy 1000 computer, CM-5 budget monitor and DMP-130A printer.|$|R
5000|$|Serial Communications Extender - Allows {{communication}} with standard serial ports and devices {{attached to them}} (such as modems, lab equipment, other computers, <b>serial</b> terminals, <b>serial</b> <b>printers</b> and X-10 home controllers). Built in modem support to communicate with most standard modems, including support for a few file transfer methods such as Zmodem.|$|R
5000|$|Mini-DIN-8 {{connectors}} {{were used}} for Sun Microsystems keyboard and mouse ports, {{as well as for}} <b>serial</b> <b>printer,</b> modem, and Apple LocalTalk connections.

50|$|When {{attached}} to a printer via a <b>printer</b> <b>cable,</b> it can print the weight on paper. Usually Weight Indicator come with a basic printing feature. It can be program in the firmware to print in few basic format. Usually there is a print button on the Digital Weight Indicator for user to press to print.|$|R
50|$|Due {{to request}} from retailers, printer {{manufacturers}} have gradually stopped including the necessary <b>printer</b> <b>cable</b> {{to connect the}} printer to a computer. Retailers usually make a huge profit on selling cables, sometimes as much as 3000% (a cable costs about $1 to produce and package, and is sold at retail stores {{for as much as}} $30).|$|R

5000|$|... 7502 {{consisted}} of a system enclosure containing up to eight PCB's (CPU card, memory cards, peripheral controllers and video cards). It was similar in size to a desk side or tower PC, but was mounted horizontally. As {{it was intended to}} function in an office environment, steel-framed, wood-veneered cabinets and furniture were available for the processor and peripheral units. The 7502 system enclosure had two levels to include space for the dual, 8-inch floppy disc unit. The interior of the cabinet was covered with acoustic-absorbent foam material to cut the noise from the cooling fans. The maximum connectivity was 8 x 7561 VDU stations and four <b>serial</b> <b>printers,</b> but in the early systems it was necessary to reduce the VDU attachments if floppy disc storage was attached. The rear of the 7502 system carried the connectors for VDUs, modem and <b>serial</b> <b>printers</b> and a set of 8 [...] "engineer's switches" [...] which could be used to input data and set options for [...] "teleloading" [...] software.|$|R
50|$|IBM 3767 Communication Terminal is a <b>serial</b> <b>printer</b> {{terminal}} {{that employed}} wire matrix print-head technology and, {{for the first}} time, the Synchronous Data Link Control (SDLC) communications protocol set under IBM's Systems Network Architecture(SNA). It was introduced in 1974 and was used widely during the late 1970s to 1990s, for attachment to IBM System/360 and System/370 mainframe computers and IBM System/7 as a 2741 terminal.|$|R
50|$|It was 8 MHz {{faster than}} its predecessor, the PowerBook 145B. It lacked an ADB port {{and used a}} lower quality passive matrix display than other current offerings, both to reduce the price. It also lacked {{external}} monitor support. Like the Duos & PowerBook 100 before it, the 150 only had a single <b>serial</b> <b>printer</b> port, however, a third party adapter was available {{for use in the}} optional modem slot.|$|R
5000|$|In the interim, the Garrard {{brand name}} was {{licensed}} to other {{companies in the}} USA, which imported many electronic items built by many different and unrelated Far Eastern manufacturers. Thus, one can find [...] "Garrard" [...] cassette decks, CD players, stereo receivers, boom-box radio/cassette machines, portable [...] "Walkman" [...] type cassette players, serial-port <b>printer</b> <b>cables,</b> universal TV/audio remote controls, and other miscellany, including turntables {{that had nothing to}} do with any original Garrard design.|$|R
50|$|Robust XON is a {{technique}} to restart communication, just in case it was stopped by an accidentally received XOFF. The receiving unit sends periodic XON characters when it can receive data, and the line is idle. One common use is by <b>serial</b> <b>printers</b> (like HP LaserJet II) to indicate they are online and ready to receive data. The XON is sent every 1 to 30 seconds depending on the printer's firmware design.|$|R
5000|$|A user would {{normally}} use the [...] "(L)oad" [...] command to load a bootstrap loader (i.e., for CP/M) from a floppy or the fixed disk. One could also access a [...] "(T)ypewriter" [...] mode for direct interface with the <b>serial</b> <b>printer</b> port and basic typing on screen. [...] "(H)ost terminal" [...] {{would allow the}} 820-II to interface as a terminal via either of the serial ports, as specified, at up to 19.2 kbit/s.|$|R
50|$|The StyleWriter is Apple Inc.'s line of inkjet <b>serial</b> <b>printers,</b> {{targeted}} mainly towards consumers. They produced print {{quality that}} {{was better than}} the dot matrix ImageWriters, and were cheaper than the LaserWriters. All but a few models contained Canon print engines, while the last few were re-badged HP DeskJet printers. When Steve Jobs returned to Apple in 1997, he discontinued most of the company's accessory product lines, including the StyleWriter and LaserWriter.|$|R
5000|$|To {{alleviate}} the C64's somewhat limited memory capacity when running complex software, Vizastar included a ROM cartridge that provided an additional 4K RAM and {{also served as}} a form of copy protection. [...] This allowed the program to remain compatible with third-party floppy disk drives for the C64, such as the Indus GT and MSD Super Disk, unlike many copy protected packages. Commodore <b>serial</b> <b>printers</b> were supported, as were RS-232 and Centronics printers with the appropriate interface.|$|R
50|$|Only COM1: and COM2: {{addresses}} {{were defined}} by the original PC. Attempts to share IRQ3 and IRQ4 to use additional ports require special measures in hardware and software, since shared IRQs were not defined in the original PC design. The most typical devices plugged into the serial port were modems and mice. Plotters and <b>serial</b> <b>printers</b> were also among the more commonly used serial peripherals, and there were numerous other more unusual uses such as operating cash registers, factory equipment, and connecting terminals.|$|R
50|$|In Japan, the Net Link {{required}} {{the use of}} smartcards with prepaid credits. The Saturn had a floppy drive and <b>printer</b> <b>cable</b> converter (both Japan only) {{which could be used}} with the Net Link. A web browser from Planetweb was included, and a mouse and keyboard adapter were available to simplify navigation. Sega also released a dedicated Saturn mouse and Saturn keyboard. In addition, to allow users to browse with just the Saturn joypad, Sega produced a series of CDs containing hundreds of website addresses.|$|R
50|$|The Apple DMP is {{the last}} {{parallel}} port printer sold under the Apple label; all subsequent Apple printers (ImageWriter, ImageWriter II, Scribe, LaserWriter, etc.) were <b>serial</b> port <b>printers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Polling {{is often}} intimately {{involved}} with very low-level hardware. For example, polling a parallel printer port to check {{whether it is}} ready for another character involves examining as little as one bit of a byte. That bit represents, {{at the time of}} reading, whether a single wire in the <b>printer</b> <b>cable</b> is at low or high voltage. The I/O instruction that reads this byte directly transfers the voltage state of eight real world wires to the eight circuits (flip flops) that make up one byte of a CPU register.|$|R
50|$|The {{floppy disk}} drives were {{interfaced}} through a Fujitsu 8877 disk controller integrated circuit, a second-source of the Western Digital 1793. The parallel port was connected through a memory-mapped Motorola MC6821 Peripheral Interface Adapter (PIA) which allowed the port {{to be fully}} bidirectional; the Osborne manuals also claimed the port implemented the IEEE-488 interface bus but this was rarely used. The parallel port used a card-edge connector etched on the main board, exposed {{through a hole in}} the case; any IEEE-488 or <b>printer</b> <b>cable</b> had to be specially manufactured for the Osborne.|$|R
