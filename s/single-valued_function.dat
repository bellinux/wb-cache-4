40|$|Abstract: On {{the basis}} of the theory of hyper-random phenomena, the {{calculus}} approaches for divergent and multiple-valued sequences and functions have been developed. For divergent sequences and functions, a number of new concepts, in particular concepts of generalized limit, spectrum of limit points, convergence to spectrum of limit points, distribution function and density function of limit points, bounds of a distribution function etc. are introduced. Concepts known for <b>single-valued</b> <b>functions,</b> in particular concepts of convergence, continuity, derivative, differentiability, indefinite and definite integrals are generalized on multiple-valued functions. A link between multiple-valued and divergent functions is found. Transformation particularities of <b>single-valued</b> <b>functions</b> into multiple-valued functions and multiple-valued <b>functions</b> into <b>single-valued</b> ones are researched...|$|R

30|$|In his survey paper [5], Targonski {{illustrated}} {{three ways}} to generalize iterative roots, extending or restricting {{the domain of}} the function or embedding the semigroup of self-mappings in a larger semigroup, and discussed the so-called phantom iterative root of continuous functions in [23]. Powierża and Jarczyk [24 – 26] gave set-valued functions as roots of <b>single-valued</b> <b>functions.</b> Maybe the best method to generalize iterative roots is replacing <b>single-valued</b> <b>functions</b> by set-valued functions for both F and f in (1.1) (see [4]). It seems that, up to now, there are only several results on set-valued iterative roots of multifunctions, even with a unique set-valued point. In 2007, Jarczyk and Zhang [27] considered the nonexistence of square iterative roots of multifunctions with exactly one set-value point and presented two sufficient conditions for the purely set-theoretical situation. Later, Li, Jarczyk, Jarczyk, and Zhang [1] gave new nonexistence results for purely set-theoretical case and fully described the square roots of strictly monotonic, upper semicontinuous (abbreviated as usc) multifunctions.|$|R
