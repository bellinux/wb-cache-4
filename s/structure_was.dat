5|$|The {{tower was}} closed in 1914 {{following}} {{the outbreak of}} the First World War, for the duration of which the steel <b>structure</b> <b>was</b> not maintained and consequently became rusty. During the war the government made unsuccessful attempts to buy the tower for its metal. Controversy still surrounds the decision to dismantle the tower after the war ended; some still believe the <b>structure</b> <b>was</b> safe and could have been repaired. Demolition began in 1919 and by 1921 only the ballroom remained. The metal was sold to scrap dealers.|$|E

50|$|The first {{monosaccharide}} attached in {{the synthesis}} of O-linked glycans is N-acetyl-galactosamine. After this, several different pathways are possible. A Core 1 <b>structure</b> <b>is</b> generated {{by the addition of}} galactose. A Core 2 <b>structure</b> <b>is</b> generated by the addition of N-acetyl-glucosamine to the N-acetyl-galactosamine of the Core 1 structure. Core 3 <b>structures</b> <b>are</b> generated by the addition of a single N-acetyl-glucosamine to the original N-acetyl-galactosamine. Core 4 <b>structures</b> <b>are</b> generated by the addition of a second N-acetyl-glucosamine to the Core 3 structure. Other core <b>structures</b> <b>are</b> possible, though less common.|$|R

The fuselage plating was 24, 20 and 18 gauge in order of thickness towards the tail, while the fin <b>structure</b> <b>was</b> completed using short longerons from frames 20 to 23, before being covered in 22 gauge plating.|$|E
5|$|Abrahams Creek {{is named}} after a {{historic}} Mohican chief of a village in the area. The creek's watershed was historically heavily logged and farmed and a sediment retention <b>structure</b> <b>was</b> built in the watershed in the 1970s. Numerous bridges have been built over the creek since 1925. The Abrahams Creek Watershed Association operates in the watershed. A 500-million-gallon reservoir known as Frances Slocum Lake {{was built on the}} creek in 1965.|$|E
5|$|According to Jesús Pastor Paloma, an Agustinian Recollect priest, the <b>structure</b> <b>was</b> also {{supposed}} to have a prefabricated retablo (reredos) altar, which was lost at sea when the ship carrying it from Belgium capsized in a storm; a wooden altar was made locally in its stead. Paloma also noted that the bottom part of the church was designed to resemble a ship's hull, so that it would sway during an earthquake.|$|E

5|$|Bulgaria is {{a unitary}} state. Since the 1880s, {{the number of}} {{territorial}} management units has varied from seven to 26. Between 1987 and 1999 the administrative structure consisted of nine provinces (oblasti, singular oblast). A new administrative <b>structure</b> <b>was</b> adopted in parallel with the decentralisation of the economic system. It includes 27 provinces and a metropolitan capital province (Sofia-Grad). All areas take their names from their respective capital cities. The provinces subdivide into 264 municipalities.|$|E

30|$|Chromatin <b>is</b> the {{fundamental}} <b>structure</b> of the genome, which is constituted by nucleosome particles. The chromatin <b>structure</b> <b>is</b> important to gene transcription. In active transcription sites, the chromatin will be loosened, {{so that the}} DNA can be exposed to transcriptional factors for transcription initiation. This open chromatin <b>structure</b> <b>is</b> termed “euchromatin”. In contrary, some of the chromatin <b>structure</b> <b>is</b> heavily condensed and the transcriptions of those genes within those regions are inhibited. The condensed chromatin <b>structure</b> <b>is</b> termed “heterochromatin”. Thus, chromatin <b>structure</b> <b>is</b> of critical importance in regulating gene expression in a temporal and spatial dependent manner (Wang et al., 2007 a).|$|R
5|$|City College's Tudor and Gothic-style building, {{designed}} by Baltimore City Hall architect George A Frederick, lasted until 1892, {{when it was}} undermined by {{the construction of the}} Baltimore & Ohio Railroad tunnel from Camden Station to Mount Royal Station, and collapsed. Several years of political in-fighting and the change to a reformist city administration delayed construction of a new structure. Designed by the architects Baldwin and Pennington, the new <b>structure</b> <b>was</b> not completed until 1899.|$|E

The decorations and ornaments were also designed and installed by Church members. The temple serves as a central congregation for southeastern Texas.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A biochip for {{building}} up self assembled ferromagnetic <b>structures</b> <b>was</b> designed. The magnetic <b>structures</b> <b>are</b> self assembling onto magnetic seeding points which {{are arranged in}} a periodic hexagonal structure {{on the bottom of}} the chip. The individual shapes of the ferromagnetic <b>structures</b> can <b>be</b> controlled by an applied external magnetic field. This periodic arrangement of adaptable ferromagnetic <b>structures</b> <b>is</b> well suited for selective and dynamic cell trapping. A biochip designed for lab experiments and a simulation model for optimizing the magnetic <b>structures</b> <b>is</b> presented...|$|R

The <b>structure</b> <b>was</b> made a Scheduled Ancient Monument in 1995, giving Eddisbury protection against unauthorised change. The eastern entrance was re-excavated by the Habitats and Hillforts Project in 2010, finds including sling stones and a saddle quern.

5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of World War II a regional command <b>structure</b> <b>was</b> subsequently adopted, with 2 MD becoming Eastern Command, 5 MD redesignated Western Command, while 1 MD in Queensland became Northern Command and the three southern states of New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania were amalgamated into Southern Command. In {{the early years of}} the war this structure proved effective for operations overseas; however, as the threat of war with Japan grew the various commands and military districts came under greater pressure. The activation of the Militia for full-time duty after Japan's entry into the war in late 1941 compounded the situation. In response, the Army command <b>structure</b> <b>was</b> reorganised in early 1942. While Western Australia remained unchanged, Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia were redesignated as Lines of Communications Areas, 7 MD became Northern Territory Force and 8 MD was redesignated as New Guinea Force. In July 1942 the Military Board's functions were assumed by the commander of the military forces, General Sir Thomas Blamey.|$|E

30|$|Sandwich {{structures}} generally exhibit {{an excellent}} bending stiffness at low weights. The bending stiffness to weight ratio of a panel {{can be increased}} by several magnitudes if a monolithic <b>structure</b> <b>is</b> substituted by a sandwich structure. On the other hand, sandwich structures suffer several drawbacks, which limit their use in certain applications. For example in a passenger aircraft, sandwich <b>structures</b> <b>are</b> only used in secondary <b>structures.</b> Secondary <b>structures</b> <b>are</b> characterized {{by the fact that}} their failure does not lead to a catastrophic damage to the aircraft. Typical secondary <b>structures</b> <b>are</b> for example flaps, radomes, and nacelle <b>structures.</b> An exception <b>is</b> the fuselage of the Premier Beechcraft I, where sandwich <b>structures</b> <b>are</b> applied.|$|R
