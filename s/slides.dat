5|$|More complex {{parts are}} formed using more complex moulds. These may have {{sections}} called <b>slides,</b> that {{move into a}} cavity perpendicular to the draw direction, to form overhanging part features. When the mould is opened, the <b>slides</b> are {{pulled away from the}} plastic part by using stationary “angle pins” on the stationary mould half. These pins enter a slot in the <b>slides</b> and cause the <b>slides</b> to move backward when the moving half of the mould opens. The part is then ejected and the mould closes. The closing action of the mould causes the <b>slides</b> to move forward along the angle pins.|$|E
5|$|Another aspect {{that the}} GAO {{investigation}} revealed {{was that the}} training F-15 pilots received for identifying helicopters was not adequate. Visual ID training was accomplished by reviewing <b>slides</b> on a 35mm projector. Helicopters only made up about 5% of the training <b>slides</b> and nearly all the pictures depicted helicopters from the ground looking up because the pictures were provided by the U.S. Army. Investigators also learned from interviewing other F-15 pilots that helicopter recognition was not regarded as an important skill within the F-15 pilot community because helicopters are not considered a threat to F-15s in air-to-air combat.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of his}} {{contract}} with the Batavian Society, van Kinsbergen had to take photographs of Borobudur, which had just been cleaned and restored.

5|$|The {{location}} of the Soak Zone was originally an island known as Flower Island, until part of the surrounding lake was filled in.

A raft ride, Rafter's Run, was added the next year. The water park has since been expanded to include body <b>slides,</b> inner-tube <b>slides,</b> a slide with foam mats, and many features for children, including a miniature pool and Captain Kidd's Adventure Galley, a play area added in 2006.

5|$|The {{sequence}} of earthquakes caused widespread landslides {{from the coast}} to east of Scotia and from the northern extent of the Eel River basin near Thompson Hill to south of Petrolia. Most of these were existing landslides that had been re-initiated and {{the largest of the}} <b>slides</b> were either slumps or bedding plane failures along the coastal bluffs. Several slump failures between Guthrie Creek and Oil Creek stretched from the bluffs out towards the shore for a distance of , leaving some of the slide to be eroded by the surf. The road between Ferndale and Petrolia was closed {{for more than a week}} where about six mostly minor landslides blocked the passage, with the roadway itself sustaining light damage due to sliding or settlement of the road fill in a few instances. One of the largest <b>slides</b> occurred along the railroad tracks at the Scotia bluffs where previous <b>slides</b> had taken place. That slide also took about a week to clear.|$|E

The main {{goal is to}} guarantee acceptable trajectories tracking between {{the internal combustion engine}} (IC engine) air to fuel ratio and the desired input. The fuzzy controller in proposed fuzzy <b>sliding</b> mode controller is based on Mamdani’s fuzzy inference system (FIS) and it has one input and one output. The input represents the function between <b>sliding</b> function, error and the rate of error. The outputs represent fuel ratio, respectively. The <b>sliding</b> mode fuzzy methodology is on-line tune the <b>sliding</b> function based on self tuning methodology. The performance of the <b>sliding</b> mode fuzzy on-line tune fuzzy <b>sliding</b> mode controller (SFOFSMC) is validated through comparison with previously developed IC engine controller based on <b>sliding</b> mode control theory (SMC). Simulation results signify good performance of fuel ratio in presence of uncertainty and external disturbance.
