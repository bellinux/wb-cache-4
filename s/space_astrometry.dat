Astrometric measurements from the Hipparcos satellite gave a best fit inclination of 160° and a true mass 37 times that of Jupiter, turning this planet into a brown dwarf. Further study of the system using Hubble <b>Space</b> Telescope <b>astrometry</b> revised the mass of HD 38529 c downwards to 17.7 Jupiter masses and suggested the presence of an additional planet, orbiting in the gap between HD 38529 b and c.

Here we outline its importance in the context of <b>space</b> VLBI <b>astrometry</b> with VSOP- 2, where errors in the satellite orbit determination and rapid tropospheric phase fluctuations set extreme challenges for the successful application of conventional phase referencing techniques, specially at the higher frequencies. SFPR is ideally suited for full calibration of those - regardless of the orbit determination accuracy - and, in general, of any non-dispersive terms. The requirements for application of SFPR techniques are fully compatible with current technical specifications of VSOP- 2.

50|$|During {{the early}} studies of ESA's Hipparcos <b>space</b> <b>astrometry</b> mission, and while still a {{graduate}} student in 1976, he was `recruited' to the project by Erik Høg, and thereafter {{played a crucial role in}} various aspects of the mission definition and in the data analysis.

50|$|Crucially, {{the bulk}} of his {{contributions}} to <b>space</b> <b>astrometry</b> has been {{in the form of a}} series of unpublished technical notes for Hipparcos and Gaia, amounting to some 200 documents totalling around 3000 pages.

In addition to the mathematical principles they frequently include working algorithms (often with source code when relevant).

Already by the end of 1976, Lindegren had produced a set of definitive technical notes and simulations showing how to obtain a `rigid sphere' with all astrometric parameters from a scanning satellite.

50|$|The {{vast amount}} of work {{invested}} in the Astrographic Catalogue, taking plates, measuring, and publishing, looked {{for a long time}} as giving only a marginal scientific profit. But today, astronomers are very much indebted to this great effort because of the possibility of combining these century-old star positions with the results from ESA's Hipparcos <b>space</b> <b>astrometry</b> satellite, allowing high accuracy proper motions to be derived for 2.5 million stars. Specifically, the Astrographic Catalogue positions were transferred from the decades-old printed catalogues into machine readable form (undertaken at the Sternberg Astronomical Institute in Moscow under the leadership of A. Kuzmin) between 1987 and 1994. The data were then reduced anew (at the US Naval Observatory in Washington under the leadership of Sean Urban), using the reference stars measured by the Hipparcos astrometry satellite. The stars from the Hipparcos Catalogue were used to establish a detailed reference framework at the various epochs of the Astrographic Catalogue plates, while the 2.5 million stars in the Tycho-2 Catalogue provided a dense reference framework to allow the plate distortions to be accurately calibrated and corrected. The proper motions of all the Tycho Catalogue stars could then be derived especially thanks to the Astrographic Catalogue, but additionally using star positions from more than 140 other ground-based catalogues. Aside from the 120,000 stars of the Hipparcos Catalogue itself, the resulting Tycho-2 Catalogue (compiled at the Copenhagen University Observatory under the leadership of Erik Høg) is now the largest, most accurate and most complete, star catalogue of the brightest stars on the sky. It is currently the basis for deriving positions for all fainter stars on the sky. Sean Urban of the US Naval Observatory wrote in 1998: The history of the Astrographic Catalogue endeavour is one of dedicated individuals devoting tedious decades of their careers to a single goal. Some believe it is also the story of how the best European observatories of the 19th century lost their leadership in astronomical research by committing so many resources to this one undertaking. Long portrayed as an object lesson in overambition, the Astrographic Catalogue has more recently turned into a lesson in the way that old data can find new uses.|$|E
40|$|We present three {{complete}} {{seasons and}} two half-seasons of SDSS r-band photometry of the gravitationally lensed quasar SBS 0909 + 532 from the U. S. Naval Observatory, {{as well as}} two seasons each of SDSS g-band and r-band monitoring from the Liverpool Robotic Telescope. Using Monte Carlo simulations to simultaneously measure the system's time delay and model the r-band microlensing variability, we confirm and significantly refine the precision of the system's time delay to Δ t_AB = 50 ^+ 2 _- 4 days, where the stated uncertainties represent the bounds of the formal 1 σ confidence interval. There may be a conflict between the time delay measurement and a lens consisting of a single galaxy. While models based on the Hubble <b>Space</b> Telescope <b>astrometry</b> and a relatively compact stellar distribution can reproduce the observed delay, the models have somewhat less dark matter than we would typically expect. We also carry out a joint analysis of the microlensing variability in the r- and g-bands to constrain the size of the quasar's continuum source at these wavelengths, obtaining log[(r_s,r/cm) [cosi/ 0. 5]^ 1 / 2] = 15. 3 ± 0. 3 and log[(r_s,g/cm) [cosi/ 0. 5]^ 1 / 2] = 14. 8 ± 0. 9, respectively.
