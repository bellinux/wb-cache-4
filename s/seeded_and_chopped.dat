40|$|Bait {{preference}} {{studies with}} red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) in North Dakota sunflower fields indicated that sunflower <b>seeds</b> <b>and</b> {{a combination of}} sunflower <b>seeds</b> <b>and</b> <b>chopped</b> corn (MIX) were more successful in producing affected blackbirds, primarily red-winged blackbirds, than pearl barley or chopped corn used separately. A subsequent study compared the effectiveness of commercial Avitrol FC Corn Chops- 99 S to 4 -aminopyridine-treated MIX- 99 S baits for reducing blackbird damage to ripening sunflower. Both baits significantly reduced damage in fields nearest a blackbird roost (within two miles), but were largely ineffective in fields farther than two miles from a roost. The ramifications of these results are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Hemp <b>seed</b> <b>and</b> hemp <b>seed</b> oil {{can supply}} us with many {{important}} substances. Their {{essential fatty acid}} compositions are favourable, but they may contain non-psychotropic cannabinoids. Emerging data show that these components can influence the health status of the population beneficially. Some data also showed trace amounts of tetrahydrocannabinol in seed oils, the main psychotropic cannabinoid that is contraindicated. Our aim was to examine cannabinoids and fatty acid composition as well as metal and non-metal element compositions in products, like hemp <b>seed</b> oil <b>and</b> <b>chopped</b> hemp <b>seed</b> capsule. The cannabinoids were separated by thin layer chromatography. Fatty acid composition was determined with gas chromatography, and elements (Al, B, Ba, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Li, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Ni, P, Pb, S, Si, Sn, Sr, V, and Zn) were measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometric method. Selenium was determined with polarographic analyser. Cannabinoids were not detectable by thin layer chromatography, so hemp seed oil, {{as well as the}} capsule, have no psychotropic adverse effect. Our data showed that hemp seed contains essential fatty acids close to the recommended ratio. The B and Se concentrations of the oils and the P concentration of the capsule are also relevant. ...|$|R
