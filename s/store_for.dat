5|$|At {{the time}} of its {{construction}} the Albert Dock was considered a revolutionary docking system because ships were loaded and unloaded directly from/to the warehouses. Two years after it opened it was modified to feature the world's first hydraulic cranes. Due to its open yet secure design, the Albert Dock became a popular <b>store</b> <b>for</b> valuable cargoes such as brandy, cotton, tea, silk, tobacco, ivory and sugar. However, despite the Albert Dock's advanced design, the rapid development of shipping technology meant that within 50 years, larger, more open docks were required, although it remained a valuable <b>store</b> <b>for</b> cargo.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{buckwheat}} seed storage duration on major indices {{of the quality}} was analyzed. Seed collected in 1996 and <b>stored</b> <b>for</b> 30 days (analyzed in 1996), seed <b>stored</b> <b>for</b> one year (analyzed in 1997), seed <b>stored</b> <b>for</b> two years (analyzed in 1998), seed <b>stored</b> <b>for</b> three years (analyzed in 1999) seed <b>stored</b> <b>for</b> four years (analyzed in 2000), seed <b>stored</b> <b>for</b> five years (analyzed in 2001) and seed <b>stored</b> <b>for</b> six years (analyzed in 2002) were investigated. The results of investigation have shown that seed stored {{up to two years}} had preserved its good production traits. Seed stored longer than two years have shown poor quality traits, and seed stored over three years could not be used - its production traits (germination energy and total germination) confirmed that such seed could not be used <b>for</b> planting. Seed <b>stored</b> over five years, regardless of storage conditions, had no qualitative traits, and therefore no value. It was also observed that longer storage duration induced decrease of seed mass. In regard to fractions, it was observed that smaller fractions lost their quality more quickly than medium fractions...|$|R

During the pulling of a wishbone, Homer, who has been constantly jealous of the material success of Ned and his family, wishes for The Leftorium to be a failure and go out of business. Homer frequently checks in on Ned to ensure that business is going poorly and is happy to see precisely that happening. When Homer sees left-handed citizens struggling with items made for right-handed people, he thinks about informing them about The Leftorium, but decides not to. Eventually the store does indeed close due to lack of business, plunging the Flanders' into debt and misery. Ned is forced to sell his possessions, and Homer gleefully buys many of Ned's things. Homer starts to regret what he did, but when he goes to return Ned's possessions, he finds Ned's house repossessed and the family living in their car. Homer wrestles with the guilt his wish has brought, and tells Ned to open the <b>store</b> <b>for</b> one final day. He then tells all the left-handed residents of Springfield about The Leftorium, and they all travel to the store and buy things. The increase in customers helps Ned keep the store open and get his house back.|$|E
