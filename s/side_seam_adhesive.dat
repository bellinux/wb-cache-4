50|$|Probably {{the most}} {{important}} innovation since the introduction of double seams is the welded <b>side</b> <b>seam.</b> Prior to the welded <b>side</b> <b>seam,</b> the can body was folded and/or soldered together, leaving a relatively thick <b>side</b> <b>seam.</b> The thick <b>side</b> <b>seam</b> required that the <b>side</b> <b>seam</b> end juncture at the end curl to have more metal to curl around before closing in behind the Body Hook or flange, with a greater opportunity for error.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to {{demonstrate}} the design process using a one-piece pattern design to create an elegant draped dress with bias seams. Aesthetically, this project is a medley of various factors (bias <b>seams,</b> lack of <b>side</b> <b>seams,</b> and one-piece-pattern), brought together through two theories: the Grecian design principle and Madeleine Vionnet 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 7 s bias cut. This diamond cut dress design {{is the result of}} a pilot study to explore the possibilities to use a diamond shape line to replace <b>side</b> <b>seams</b> and the waistline. Due to the complicated seams, tucks and dart, three samples were tested to complete a modified pattern. This design is based on the classic Grecian design principle of draping without traditional <b>side</b> <b>seams.</b> <b>Side</b> <b>seams</b> are replaced by bias seams such as Vionnet 2 ̆ 7 s bias cut effect. Additionally, this design is an attempt to develop a better system of using draping and drafting successfully and efficiently...|$|R

50|$|Ponding is the (typically) {{unwanted}} pooling of water, typically on a {{flat roof}} or roadway.

On low-slope asphalt roofs, ponding water allows the oil solvent components of the asphalt to leach out and evaporate, leaving the roof membrane brittle and susceptible to cracking and leaking in the ponding location.|$|R
