5|$|Bruce's {{regiment}} {{landed at}} Cape Helles in mid-1915, where he fully distinguished {{himself in the}} construction of trenches and as an able commander. His battalion suffered heavy casualties over the coming months, and Bruce himself was wounded on 3 June by a <b>shot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> arm, though it was this injury that spared him from a major assault by his battalion on 4 June in which many of his peers perished. He later reflected that he must have been kept on earth for some purpose. He returned to the front lines and his division moved to the new front at Suvla Bay, where it was involved in particularly heavy fighting and sustained trench warfare throughout August and September. Bruce received the Military Cross and the Croix de Guerre for his service during these months, and rose to the rank of captain on 5 August. He was wounded again on 26 September, this time by a <b>shot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> knee, which left him crippled for several years and forced him to return to England to recuperate, while the rest of his regiment were transferred to France after the abandonment of the Gallipoli campaign.|$|E
5|$|Hesketh-Prichard {{first visited}} Atlantic Canada in August 1903, {{travelling}} up {{the coasts of}} Labrador and Newfoundland, and donating the heads of stags he had <b>shot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Newfoundland Exhibition then in London. He returned in October 1904, this time with his mother, and the cricketer Teddy Wynyard.|$|E
5|$|Investigators {{said the}} murders were a targeted, execution-style attack and not {{associated}} with a robbery; Clemmons did not aim at any other customers or the two baristas working at the time. The four slain officers were Mark Renninger, 39 (killed with a <b>shot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> head); Ronald Owens, 37 (shot in the neck); Tina Griswold, 40 (shot in the head); and Greg Richards, 42 (shot in the head).|$|E

50|$|Critics of {{this theory}} {{point out that}} bullet {{placement}} is a very significant factor, but is only generally used in such one-shot-stop calculations, covering <b>shots</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> torso.|$|R
25|$|An 81-year-old janitor, Ilario Bertuccio, {{was shot}} that same evening while walking {{on his way}} home from work in the Bay View district. He died almost {{instantly}} after four <b>shots</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> shoulder and chest.|$|R
5|$|On January 16, 2013, Dunderdale held a {{surprise}} cabinet shuffle that saw Minister Marshall shuffled out of Finance and appointed as Minister of Natural Resources. He {{was replaced by}} Jerome Kennedy, who had served as Natural Resources Minister since October 2011. With contract negotiations underway with public sector unions Minister Kennedy's appointment was called a warning <b>shot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> union leaders by the opposition. Minister Kennedy is considered a tough negotiator, and was Minister of Finance in 2008 during the last round of contract negotiations.|$|E
5|$|Although sceptical, Harry sends Lucas to Kachimov {{to learn}} which cable the {{submarine}} will attack so Malcolm can launch a counterattack. Lucas {{is able to}} turn Kachimov by forging evidence {{that he is an}} MI5 mole. They both go to the Russian embassy and find the submarine's location, after which Malcolm launches the counterattack with seconds to spare. Kachimov is later arrested. Lucas visits Elizabeta at her home, which was also their married home and he asks her to become an asset to MI5 to save her from arrest because of her association with Kachimov. In the end, Kachimov is with Harry and Ros in a field. Kachimov states his admiration for Adam's sacrifice, but then callously says he was a replaceable resource. In the final moments, Ros hands Harry a gun and Harry kills Kachimov with a <b>shot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> chest.|$|E
5|$|At age 76, Librescu {{was among}} the 32 people who were murdered in the Virginia Tech shooting. On April 16, 2007, Seung-Hui Cho entered the Norris Hall Engineering Building and opened fire on classrooms. Librescu, who taught a solid {{mechanics}} class in Room 204 in the Norris Hall during April 2007, held {{the door of his}} classroom shut while the gunman attempted to enter it. Although he was shot through the door, Librescu managed to prevent the gunman from entering the classroom until most of his students had escaped through the windows. He was struck by five bullets, with a <b>shot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> head proving to be fatal. Of the 23 registered students in his class, only one, Minal Panchal, died.|$|E

5|$|The player {{controls}} the protagonist Leon S. Kennedy from a third-person perspective. The gameplay focuses on action and shootouts involving crowds of enemies in large open areas but still features some Horror elements. The camera is placed behind Leon and zooms {{in for an}} over-the-shoulder view when aiming a weapon, or a first-person view when aiming with a sniper rifle. There is no crosshair for firearms, instead, every firearm has a laser sight. Unlike previous games where players can only shoot straight, up or down, players have more options. For example, <b>shots</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> feet can cause enemies <b>to</b> stumble, <b>shots</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> arms can make them drop their weapons, and headshots instantly kill most human enemies. Players can shoot down projectiles like thrown axes or scythes.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} {{to the use of}} visual effects, the closing sequence required ADR due to the sound of rain on the original filming. The visual effects were the director Dan Zeff's idea, and the writers were pleased that they were within budget. They also serve to tie the final <b>shot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> opening shot of the episode, as both feature a raven. Scenes that were cut down in the editing process included the initial meeting between the witchfinders—Warren and Clarke—and Sir Andrew Pike, and a private discussion between Warren and Clarke after {{the first day of the}} trial. The extended versions of the scenes featured an explanation about the Devil being found in everyday objects and a discussion about the stages of torture respectively. Shearsmith expressed frustration that these extra scenes could not be included on the DVD release.|$|E
5|$|June's {{body and}} {{clothing}} were heavily bloodstained; {{she was found}} in her nightdress with bare feet. The police believe she had been sitting up during part of the attack, based on the pattern of blood on her clothing. She was found {{lying on the floor}} by the door of the master bedroom. She had been shot seven times. One shot to her forehead, between her eyes, was fired from under one foot away. That and another <b>shot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right side of her head would both have caused her death quickly, the court heard. There were also shots to the right side of her lower neck, her right forearm, and two injuries {{on the right side of}} her chest and right knee.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the campaigning {{season of}} 1864, Cleburne became engaged to Susan Tarleton of Mobile, Alabama. Their {{marriage}} {{was never to}} be, as Cleburne was killed during an ill-conceived assault (which he opposed) on Union fortifications at the Battle of Franklin, just south of Nashville, Tennessee, on November 30, 1864. He was last seen advancing on foot toward the Union line with his sword raised, after his horse was shot out from under him. Accounts later {{said that he was}} found just inside the Federal line and his body carried back to an aid station along the Columbia Turnpike. Confederate war records indicate he died of a <b>shot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> abdomen, or possibly a bullet that went through his heart. When Confederates found his body, he had been picked clean of any valuable items, including his sword, boots and pocket watch.|$|E
50|$|After {{stopping}} {{a car for}} speeding, Oklahoma Highway Patrol Trooper Howard M. Crumley was murdered with his own revolver with two <b>shots</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> head, by the brothers Ray and Hubert Wilkinson, on June 28, 1970, three miles west of Lone Grove on U.S. Highway 70.|$|R
5|$|Technique-wise, Sjumandjaja used <b>the</b> camera <b>to</b> emphasise <b>the</b> narrative. Bajangan, {{his first}} work, used long <b>shots</b> <b>to</b> show <b>the</b> main character's lonesomeness. He would often use several <b>shots</b> <b>to</b> show <b>the</b> {{psychological}} issues faced by his characters, focusing {{on both the}} characters and the space around them. He also used references to well-known cultural works; a scene in Kartini was framed so to reflect Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper.|$|R
50|$|Broadsides is a 1983 {{videogame}} that simulated naval {{combat in}} the Age of Sail for the Atari 8-bit family, Apple II, and Commodore 64. Giant warships circled each other, waiting for <b>the</b> best time <b>to</b> unleash a broadside upon the enemy. Cannons could be loaded with {{various types of}} ordnance; cannonballs <b>to</b> destroy <b>the</b> hull, chain <b>shot</b> <b>to</b> destroy <b>the</b> sails, and grape <b>shot</b> <b>to</b> kill <b>the</b> enemy crew.|$|R
5|$|The {{sequence}} of events during the injection mould of a plastic part is called the injection moulding cycle. The cycle begins when the mould closes, followed by the injection of the polymer into the mould cavity. Once the cavity is filled, a holding pressure is maintained to compensate for material shrinkage. In the next step, the screw turns, feeding the next <b>shot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> front screw. This causes the screw to retract as the next shot is prepared. Once the part is sufficiently cool, the mould opens and the part is ejected.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{seeing the}} Unity approaching, Moore opened full sail and cut away his boats {{in an attempt}} to escape. As the Unity pulled closer, Moore opened fire. The Unity crew managed to avoid damage and pulled {{alongside}} the Margaretta. Led by Joseph Getchell and O'Brien's brother, John, the Unity crew stormed on board. Both sides exchanged musket shots as Moore tossed hand grenades onto the Unity. Moore was taken down by Samuel Watts with a musket <b>shot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> chest. Once the Falmouth Packet caught up to the attack, it managed to pull along the other side of Moore's ship. With the combination of both crews, they were able to overwhelm the Margaretta.|$|E
5|$|Walsh was {{employed}} with the FBI until 1942 when, as a Reserve Marine Lieutenant, {{he took a}} leave to serve with the United States Marine Corps during World War II. After he left, Hoover refused to allow any more active agents {{to be members of}} any military reserve. He fought in the Pacific Theater, specifically on Okinawa and in North China. In one incident, he and his comrades were pinned down by a sniper, whom Walsh was able to kill from 90 yards away with a single <b>shot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> torso from a M1911 pistol. He earned the rank of Colonel and returned to the FBI for two years from 1946–1947. In total, during his tenure with the agency, he killed between 11 and 17 suspects.|$|E

25|$|Author Mike Ryan {{claimed in}} his book Secret Operations of the SAS that Cleary had {{actually}} managed to escape and was shot by the pursuing soldiers who had ordered him to stop {{as he tried to}} make his way <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Republic of Ireland border.

25|$|An autopsy {{conducted}} on her corpse revealed {{that she had}} been killed with three <b>shots</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> neck after enduring hours of torture.

5|$|In {{addition}} to being the deadliest battle {{of the war in}} terms of total casualties, Gettysburg also had the highest number of Generals killed in action of any battle in the war. The Confederacy lost generals Paul Jones Semmes, William Barksdale, Richard Garnett, and Lewis Armistead, as well as J. Johnston Pettigrew during the retreat after the battle. The Union lost Generals John Reynolds, Samuel K. Zook, Stephen H. Weed, and Elon J. Farnsworth, as well as Strong Vincent, who after being mortally wounded was given a deathbed promotion to brigadier general. Additional senior officer casualties included the wounding of Union Generals Dan Sickles (lost a leg), Francis C. Barlow, and Winfield Scott Hancock. For the Confederacy, Major General John Bell Hood lost the use of his left arm, while Major General Henry Heth received a <b>shot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> head {{on the first day of}} battle (though incapacitated for the rest of the battle, he remarkably survived without long term injuries, credited in part due to his hat stuffed full of paper dispatches). Confederate Generals James Kemper and Isaac R. Trimble were severely wounded during Pickett's charge and captured during the Confederate retreat. General James J. Archer, in command of a brigade that most likely was responsible for killing Reynolds, was taken prisoner shortly after Reynolds' death.|$|E
5|$|Marlene (Merle Dandridge) is {{the leader}} of the Fireflies, a militia {{movement}} hoping to wrest control of the Quarantine Zones from the military. She was tasked by Ellie's mother, a close friend of hers, to look out for her daughter, but Ellie only met her after her infection. After being wounded in Boston, she offers to sell Joel and Tess the merchandise Robert stole from them and sold to her in return for smuggling Ellie out of the Quarantine Zone. Joel meets Marlene again at the Firefly hospital in Salt Lake City, where scientists are running tests on Ellie. Marlene reveals that they will operate on Ellie, which will result in her death; Joel disagrees with the operation and fights back. After Joel rescues Ellie, Marlene tries to stop him from leaving, insisting that taking Ellie will merely delay her death until a more gruesome one occurs, and Ellie's return to her would help to create a cure against the infection. Joel disregards her and instead shoots her in the stomach. She begs for her life, but Joel executes her with a <b>shot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> head, ensuring that no-one is left to come after them.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} movie {{opens with}} the protagonist, Keil Fluge (unnamed in the North American version), hunting in a canyon. After seeing an Imperial flying battleship in the sky, he is attacked by two creatures and chases {{one of them}} to a large, ancient complex built directly into the rock. He explores the ruin, and sees relics of old technology still hanging from the ceilings. Another gigantic creature suddenly attacks him, and though his weapon is useless against the armored creature, a rumbling triggers a cave in, which crushes the monster and saves Keil. From the newly created hole, an armored, blue dragon flies down the cavern with a rider across its shoulders, being chased by an even bigger black dragon as the cavern is destroyed in an explosion. Regaining consciousness outside, Keil sees the two dragons locked in combat in the air before him. Dodging a blast from the black dragon, the blue dragon's rider is then hit by single <b>shot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> chest, and the black dragon flies away. The blue dragon flies towards Keil. A psychic connection is made between the rider and Keil, who is told not to let the black dragon reach the black tower. The rider then dies and Keil picks up his fallen gun, climbs atop the dragon and flies away, determined to finish the rider's quest.|$|E
50|$|Cabezas {{was kidnapped}} after being <b>the</b> first <b>to</b> make public {{photographs}} of Alfredo Yabrán , {{a postal service}} mogul.

5|$|When the Germans {{launched}} {{the invasion of}} Crete on 20 May, Kippenberger, {{like most of the}} defenders of the island, was surprised at the sight of hundreds of Fallschirmjäger (paratroopers) descending under parachutes. He quickly recovered and was making his way to his headquarters, when a burst of gunfire from a paratrooper was directed his way. After twisting his ankle in avoiding the gunfire, he stalked and killed the paratrooper with a <b>shot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> head. His brigade was positioned east of Maleme airfield, on the Galatas plains. It was well positioned to counterattack scattered paratroopers who were beginning to consolidate into a good starting position from which an attack on the airfield could be launched. His request to do so was denied by the acting divisional commander, Brigadier Edward Puttick. An attack launched later without Kippenberger's knowledge failed although he believed the outcome could have been different if his troops had been involved.|$|E
5|$|With {{the train}} tracks, Delaware River and New York State Route 97 {{paralleling}} to the north, the highway begins a southeastern track. There are some occasional clearings, The old alignment of State Route 237 passes a pond as the highway {{pulls away from}} the river and train tracks with the forests becoming a majority the surroundings. The old alignment of State Route 237 passes a pond, as the highway pulls away from the river and train tracks. The highway intersects with Township Road 413, which serves access to Hirsh Pond, located to the north. The route begins to head through larger clearings as it continues southeast. At an intersection with German Hill Road, the highway makes a <b>shot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east, passing through some woods. After the woods, the old alignment of State Route 237 ends at an intersection with State Route 434. This was once an intersection with State Route 137.|$|E
