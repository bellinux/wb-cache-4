5|$|The first {{evidence}} that <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> at Vrbanja Bridge was radio silence from the French post. About 05:20 on 27 May, platoon commander Captain François Lecointre had lost radio {{contact with the}} posts, {{and drove to the}} bridge {{to find out what was}} happening; he was met by a Serb sentry in French uniform who attempted to take him prisoner. Lecointre quickly turned around and drove to Skenderija stadium, the headquarters of FREBAT4.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} a Universe filled with a luminiferous aether {{remained}} in vogue among some scientists until the early 20th century. This form of aether was viewed as the medium through which light could propagate. In 1887, the Michelson–Morley experiment tried to detect the Earth's motion through this medium by looking {{for changes in the}} speed of light depending on the direction of the planet's motion. However, the null result indicated <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> with the concept. The idea of the luminiferous aether was then abandoned. It was replaced by Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity, which holds that the speed of light in a vacuum is a fixed constant, independent of the observer's motion or frame of reference.|$|E
5|$|On 2 September, at dawn, the Dutch force {{crossed the}} Lippe across a pontoon bridge. Maurice awaited them with 5,000 {{infantry}} {{and the rest}} of his cavalry arranged for the battle in the hills near Wesel, along the opposite riverbank. Philip of Nassau divided his troops into four squadrons: the first one of 125 men under the drossaard of Sallandt, the second one of 125 men under the Count of Kinsky, the third one, those in which Nassau and his brothers marched, of 150 soldiers under Lieutenant Balen, and the last, closing the way, of 120 men under the English captain Nicholas Parker. Having arrived at Krudenburg, Nassau sent 40 chosen men from the companies led by Balen to surprise the foraging horses. On finding a force much larger than they expected, the Dutch officers thought that <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> and sent a report back to Philip of Nassau. The Dutch commander, nevertheless, believed that it was only the convoy's escort and moved on with his troops and his entourage to attack the Spanish cavalry, aiming to prevent its escape.|$|E

5|$|The party {{arrived at}} the vicarage to be greeted by Mrs Blackburne. (Mrs Blackburne had {{originally}} intended to travel on the inaugural journey with her husband, but the previous day had felt a presentiment that <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> at home and her presence was required, and had returned alone by boat. She had then heard a rumour that a mob from Oldham were planning to storm the track at Eccles to attack the Duke of Wellington, and decided {{to remain in the}} vicarage.) Huskisson was moved to the sofa, and given laudanum and brandy. At about 2.00pm Hunter and Brandreth cut Huskisson's clothing away from his damaged leg to give it a proper examination. Unfamiliar with industrial injuries, they were baffled {{by the nature of the}} damage to Huskisson's leg, but concluded that despite the apparent severity of his injuries the wounds were treatable.|$|E
25|$|Flight 901 was {{supposed}} to arrive back at Christchurch at 6:05pm for a stopover including refuelling and a crew change before completing the journey back to Auckland.

25|$|The Estonian {{authorities}} {{refused to}} send the flight data recorder of the helicopter to the United States because the aircraft was manufactured there, thus possibly creating a conflict of interest. The technical investigation was in fact performed in the United Kingdom.

25|$|On 4 September 1815 Quesnel was {{retired from}} the army. In April 1819, he {{suddenly}} disappeared and his corpse was found floating in the Seine in Paris. His watch and a valuable piece of jewelry were found on his body. One source asserted that his death {{could not have been}} a suicide because he was held in high regard in military circles and gave no hint that morning that <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong.</b> It was suggested that certain individuals threw him off the Pont des Arts (bridge) for political reasons. QUESNEL is one of the names inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe on the west panel.|$|E

25|$|Despite the minuteness of {{the spatial}} terms, the first {{indications}} that <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> with Newtonian gravitation were discovered over a century-and-a-half ago. In 1859, Urbain Le Verrier, {{in an analysis}} of available timed observations of transits of Mercury over the Sun's disk from 1697 to 1848, reported that known physics could not explain the orbit of Mercury, unless there possibly existed a planet or asteroid belt within the orbit of Mercury. The perihelion of Mercury's orbit exhibited an excess rate of precession over that which could be explained by the tugs of the other planets. The ability to detect and accurately measure the minute value of this anomalous precession (only 43 arc seconds per tropical century) is testimony to the sophistication of 19th century astrometry.|$|E
25|$|On {{his return}} to the US, Spitzer {{calculated}} that <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> with the ZETA results. He noticed that the apparent temperature, 5 million K, would not have time to develop during the short firing times. ZETA did not discharge enough energy into the plasma to heat it to those temperatures so quickly. If the temperature was increasing at the relatively slow rate his calculations suggested, fusion would not be taking place early in the reaction, and could not be adding energy that might make up the difference. Spitzer suspected the temperature reading was not accurate. Since it was the temperature reading that suggested the neutrons were from fusion, if the temperature was lower, it implied the neutrons were non-fusion in origin.|$|E

25|$|According to {{the chief}} engineer, {{who was in the}} engine control room {{at the time of the}} accident, the vessel {{suddenly}} heeled port around 12:30 and would not righten itself. Within the next 10–15 seconds, the list increased to 4–5 degrees and, after briefly stopping at 10 degrees, Finn-Baltic capsized. At the same time, the chief officer noticed that the ship had developed a permanent list to port, realized that <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> and decided to head to the bridge. However, when he got to the door of his cabin, the combination turned over and he was washed away by the water flowing through the broken cabin window. The rising water column carried the chief officer upwards in the staircase until, only seconds from drowning, he arrived at the corridor next to the ship's sauna, which was below the main deck and thus above the surface.|$|E
25|$|I {{had watched}} Ken Barrington – a great Test batsman – {{as a boy}} and when I broke into the England side in the late Seventies he became a father figure. In fact, he was a mentor {{to a lot of}} us then – myself, David Gower, Ian Botham, Mike Gatting. Ken was an England {{selector}} and assistant manager on the West Indies tour of 1981. There were no official coach in those days but it was to Ken that most of us turned. Unlike many retired pros, he never used the words, 'In my day...' On the first night of the Test, he suffered a heart attack in our hotel. I was woken the next morning at around 8am by tour manager Alan Smith and captain Ian Botham. I knew <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong,</b> because Both was never up before then. They told me the news. I had tears in my eyes when we went out on to the pitch for the minute's silence and again when I was batting in the second innings. We needed over 500 to win and it soon became apparent that we weren't going to get them. But I kept thinking of him and managed to make a hundred. Kenny was a counsellor, a friend and an inspiration.|$|E
25|$|In October 1970, when Genie was {{approximately}} 13 years and 6 months old, Genie's parents had a violent argument {{in which her}} mother threatened to walk out if she could not call her own parents. Her husband eventually relented, and later that day she left with Genie {{when he was out}} of the house and went to her parents in Monterey Park; Genie's brother, by then 18, had already run away from home and was living with friends. Around three weeks later, on November 4, Genie's mother decided to apply for disability benefits for the blind in nearby Temple City, California and brought Genie with her, but on account of her near-blindness Genie's mother accidentally entered the general social services office next door. The social worker who greeted them instantly sensed <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> when she saw Genie and was shocked to learn her true age, having estimated from her appearance and demeanor that she was around 6 or 7 and possibly autistic, and after she and her supervisor questioned Genie's mother and confirmed Genie's age they immediately contacted the police. Genie's parents were arrested and Genie became a ward of the court, and due to her physical condition and near-total unsocialized state a court order was immediately issued for Genie to be taken to Children's Hospital Los Angeles.|$|E

500|$|During the American Revolutionary War, Spain lent the rebelling colonists {{the use of}} its {{ports in}} Puerto Rico, through which flowed {{financial}} aid and arms for their cause. An incident occurred in the coast of Mayagüez, in 1777, between two Continental Navy ships, the Eudawook and the Henry, and a Royal Navy warship, [...] Both American ships were chased by the larger and more powerful Glasgow. The American colonial ships were close to the coast of Mayagüez; members of the Puerto Rican militia of that town, realizing that <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong,</b> signaled for the ships to dock at the town's bay. After the ships docked, the crews of both ships got off and some Mayagüezanos boarded and raised the Spanish flag on both ships. The commander of the Glasgow {{became aware of the}} situation and asked the island's governor, Jose Dufresne to turn over the ships. Dufresne refused and ordered the British warship out of the Puerto Rican dock.|$|E
