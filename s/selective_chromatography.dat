40|$|In <b>selective</b> <b>chromatography</b> and {{electromigration}} methods, supramolecular {{recognition of}} selectands and selectors {{is due to}} the fast and reversible formation of association complexes governed by thermodynamics. Whereas the selectand molecules to be separated are always present in the mobile phase, the selector employed for the separation of the selectands is either part of the stationary phase or is added to the mobile phase. By the reciprocal principle, the roles of selector and selectand can be reversed. In this contribution in honor of Professor Stig Allenmark, the evolution of the reciprocal principle in chromatography is reviewed and its advantages and limitations are outlined. Various reciprocal scenarios, including library approaches, are discussed in efforts to optimize selectivity in separation science...|$|E

In 32 P-labeled cells, these agents induced serine 32 P-phosphorylation of a 135 -kDa particulate protein and, to a variable and lesser extent, a 44 -kDa protein, which were selectively immunoprecipitated by anti-cAMP-PDE, as analyzed by SDS/PAGE and autoradiography.

The two phosphoproteins were identified as cAMP-PDE or a closely related molecule (in {{the case of the}} 44 -kDa species, perhaps a proteolytic fragment) since (i) amounts of 32 P in the immunoprecipitated 135 -kDa protein paralleled enzyme inactivation, (ii) prior incubation of the anti-cAMP-PDE with the pure rat or bovine enzyme selectively blocked the immunoprecipitation of the phosphoproteins, (iii) 135 - and 44 -kDa proteins reacted with the anti-cAMP-PDE on Western immunoblots, and (iv) the two phosphoproteins copurified with cAMP-PDE activity through DEAE-Sephacel chromatography and were isolated by highly <b>selective</b> affinity <b>chromatography</b> on cilostamide-agarose.

A {{wide range of}} steroid hormones exist, and their contributions to processes such as growth, reproduction, development, and aging, is almost always complex. Understanding the biosynthetic pathways that generate steroid hormones and the signaling pathways that mediate their effects is thus of fundamental importance. In this work, we review recent advances in (i) the biological role of steroid hormones in the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans and (ii) the development of novel methods to facilitate the detection and identification of these molecules.

A <b>selective</b> gas <b>chromatography</b> (GC) method has been developed to determine the purity of acetone, dichloromethane, methanol and toluene. Using this method, the main contaminants of each organic solvent can be quantified. Moreover, the developed method allows the simultaneous determination of ethanol, isopropanol, chloroform, benzene, acetone, dichloromethane, methanol and toluene. Propionitrile was used as the internal standard. The separation was obtained on a CP-SIL 8 -CB low bleed/MS column (60 m x 0. 32 mm, i. d. x 1. 0 mu m coating thickness). The GC method was fully validated using a new approach based on the accuracy profile as a decision tool. The determination of P-expectation tolerance intervals for the estimation of total error - including both bias and precision - is used to better reflect the actual performances of the method, which is definitively the objective of the validation. The different validation criteria such as selectivity, response function, trueness, precision, accuracy, linearity or limits of detection and quantification were considered.

Although either methodology could be used for the monitoring of patient therapy, the smaller variability observed with HPLC compared to that observed with the bioassay favors the use of HPLC for pharmacokinetic studies...|$|R
40|$|Cow conceptuses were flushed from uteri on Day 17 of {{pregnancy}} and cultured with PH]glucosamine and 4 CJleucine. A high molecular Weight glycoprotein (HMWG) having an Mr = 765, 000 was isolated by a com-bination of anion-exchange and gel-filtration <b>chromatography.</b> <b>Selective</b> chemical and enzymatic degradations were performed. The HMWG was resistant to Pronase and peptide: N-glycanase F. Only endo- 13 -galactosidase and harsh alkaline reducing conditions {{were successful in}} dissociating carbohydrate from the protein core, sug-gesting that carbohydrate chains are N-linked to Asn and contain a-galactosidic linkages. The intact molecule could bind to an affinity column of Datura stramoniom lectin, suggesting the presence of j(14) -linked oligo-mers of N-acetylglucosamine. The susceptibility of HM WG to endo-p-galactosidase suggests {{that at least some}} of these oligomers are substituted with galactose to form N-acetyllactosamine. Binding of HM WG to lectin could be inhibited partially with N-acetyllactosamine or completely with a mixture of N, N’-diacetylcbito-biose and N, N’, N”-O-iacetylchitotriose. In summary, properties of the HMWG suggest it contains lactosa-minoglycan components and is almost identical to an HMWG secreted by the Day 16 ovine conceptus. Thus, embryos of these two ruminant species secrete similar molecules during early pregnancy...|$|R
40|$|The {{gibberellin}} (GA) {{content of}} E- 1, a tall genotype of early flowering lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.), and of three selected GA-responsive dwarfs, dwf 1, dwf 2, and dwf 21, {{has been determined}} using 13 C-labeled internal standards and gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GC-MS). In the shoots of the E- 1 parent, GA 1, 3 -epi-GA 1, GA 3, GA 5, GA 8, GA 19, GA 20, GA 29, and GA 53 were identified by full scan GC-MS and Kovats retention indices. Purification by immunoaffinity <b>chromatography</b> <b>selective</b> for 13 -hydroxy GAs, was necessary for GA identification. Relative to the parent E- 1, the concentrations of GA 1, GA 8, GA 20, and GA 29 in the shoots of dwf 2 plants were reduced to about 10 % and in shoots of dwf 21 plants to less than 50 %. In dwf 1 the levels of GA 1, GA 8, and GA 29 were also reduced to less than 50 % of the parent E- 1, but the level of GA 20 was fivefold higher than in E- 1. Plant height was correlated with the endogenous levels of GA 1 and GA 8...|$|R
40|$|A fast, sensitive, and <b>selective</b> ultrahigh-performance liquid <b>chromatography</b> tandem mass {{spectrometry}} (UHPLC-MS/MS) method that {{is able to}} quantify geochemical biomarkers in sediment is described. A pool of 10 sterols, {{which can be used}} as biomarkers of autochthonous (cholesterol, cholestanol, brassicasterol, ergosterol), allochthonous (stigmasterol, β-sitosterol, campesterol, and stigmastanol) and anthropogenic (coprostanol and epicoprostanol) organic matter (OM), and three triterpenols (lupeol, α-amyrin, and β-amyrin) were chosen as the analytes. The method showed excellent analytical parameters, and, compared with the traditional GC-MS methods that are commonly applied for the analysis of sterols, this method requires no sample cleanup or derivatization and presents improved values for the LOD and LOQ. UHPLC can separate the diastereoisomers (epicoprostanol, coprostanol, and cholestanol) and the isomers (lupeol, α-amyrin, and β-amyrin). The method was successfully applied for the quantification of the biomarkers, and thus, it was applied to assess the OM sources and the impacts of anthropogenic activities in sediments from different environments, such as Antarctica and other Brazilian systems (Continental Shelf, São Sebastião Channel, and Santos Estuary). Unique profiles of the biomarkers were observed for the contrasting environments, and β-amyrin and cholesterol were more predominant in the Santos Estuary and Antarctica samples, respectively. The sterol ratios indicated a higher level of sewage contamination in the Santos Estuary...|$|R

We report {{the results of a}} preliminary estimation of the stability of the dried extract from bark of Guazuma ulmifolia Lam. (“Mutamba”), with and without added colloidal silicon dioxide (CSD). The physical and chemical properties and the compatibility of CSD in the extract were evaluated for 21 days of storage under stress conditions of temperature (45 ± 2 ◦ C) and humidity (75 ± 5 %). Thermogravimetry (TG) was supplemented using <b>selective</b> high-performance liquid <b>chromatography</b> (HPLC) for determination of stability of the characteristic constituents (chemical markers), namely, procyanidin B 2 (PB 2) and epicatechin (EP). The results showed that PB 2 is an appropriate compound {{to be used as a}} chemical marker in the quality control of dried extracts of G. ulmifolia. The stress study showed that there was no significant difference between the two formulations. However, considering the TG data and the high temperatures involved, the results suggest that CSD increases the stability of the dried extract of G. ulmifolia. 1...|$|R
40|$|A highly {{sensitive}} and <b>selective</b> high-performance liquid <b>chromatography</b> (HPLC) method {{was developed for}} the determination of doxorubicin (DXR) and its metabolite doxorubicinol (DXR-ol) in rat plasma. The method was based on photosensitization reaction followed by peroxyoxalate chemiluminescence detection (PO-CL). DXR and DXR-ol that were fluorescent quinones, served as a photosensitizer {{in the presence of}} a hydrogen atom donor such as ethanol under aerobic conditions to produce hydrogen peroxide. Then the generated hydrogen peroxide and DXR or DXR-ol were monitored through PO-CL reaction by mixing with aryloxalate as a single post-column reagent that enabled highly selective and sensitive determination of DXR and DXR-ol. The separation of DXR and DXR-ol by HPLC was accomplished isocratically on an ODS column within 15 min. The method involves a simple one step protein precipitation by methanol and a sample size of 50 -μL was sufficient. Besides, it can detect accurately the low plasma concentrations. The detection limits (signal-to-noise ratio = 3) were 4. 5 and 3. 8 fmol for DXR and DXR-ol, respectively. The percentage recovery was found to be 90. 7 – 102. 4 % and the inter- and intra-assay RSD values in rat plasma were 2. 5 – 8. 9 %. The method has been successfully used to study pharmacokinetic profiles of DXR and DXR-ol in rats after a single-dose of DXR...|$|R
40|$|Newly {{synthesized}} proteoglycans of rat incisors were labelled in vivo for 6 h with [35 S]-sulphate {{in order}} to facilitate their detection during purification and characterization. Proteoglycans were extracted from non-mineralized portions (predentine) of rat incisors with 4 M-guanidinium chloride and subsequently from dentine by demineralization with a 0. 4 M-EDTA solution containing 4 M-guanidinium chloride. Both extractions were performed at 4 degrees C in the presence of proteinase inhibitors. Purification of proteoglycans was achieved with a procedure involving gel-filtration <b>chromatography,</b> <b>selective</b> precipitation of phosphoproteins, affinity chromatography and ion-exchange chromatography. Two proteoglycan populations were found in the initial extract (Pd-PG I and Pd-PG II), whereas only one fraction (D-PG) was obtained after demineralization. The minor proteoglycan fraction from the first extract, Pd-PG I, although not totally characterized, differed sharply from the other proteoglycans in that it had a larger molecular size with larger glycosaminoglycan chains composed of chondroitin 4 - and 6 -sulphate isomers. In contrast, the major proteoglycans Pd-PG II and D-PG had smaller hydrodynamic sizes with smaller glycosaminoglycan chains (but larger than those from bovine nasal cartilage proteoglycans) composed exclusively of chondroitin 4 -sulphate. The major proteoglycans were incapable of interacting with hyaluronic acid. In general, the amino acid compositions of the major proteoglycans of rat incisors resembled that of bovine nasal cartilage proteoglycans, but the former had lower proline, valine, isoleucine, leucine, and higher aspartic acid, contents...|$|R
