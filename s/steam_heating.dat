5|$|Bogie {{stock was}} built by Ashbury in 1898 and by Cravens and at Neasden Works in 1900. This gave a better ride quality, <b>steam</b> <b>heating,</b> {{automatic}} vacuum brakes, electric lighting and upholstered seating in all classes. The Bluebell Railway has four 1898–1900 Ashbury and Cravens carriages and a fifth, built at Neasden, is at the London Transport Museum.|$|E
5|$|Originally, Budd {{built the}} Hi-Levels with <b>steam</b> <b>heating.</b> When Amtrak began {{converting}} its inherited fleet to head-end power in 1970s, the Santa Fe handled {{the conversion of}} the Hi-Levels in its Topeka, Kansas, shops. Of the 73 Hi-Levels, all but three underwent the conversion.|$|E
40|$|The {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} examine the eilect of soaking and <b>steam</b> <b>heat</b> treatment of shrimp heads waste (SHW) on nutritional quality. The objectives of this research were to determine wether {{the effect of the}} shrimp heads waste were treated in 10 % of dusk rice husk solution with five level of length of <b>steam</b> <b>heat</b> (control; 0; 15; 30; 45 and 60 min) on the improvement of its the nutritive value. The feed was soaked for 48 h prior to <b>steam</b> <b>heat</b> The {{experiment was}} designed in Completely Randomized Design of 6 x 3. The results showed that there was significant effects (P < 0. 05) length of <b>steam</b> <b>heat</b> to dry matter, crude protein, fat, ash contens and metabolizable energy of SHW. Increasing length of <b>steam</b> <b>heat</b> was caused reduce dry matter, crude protein, fat contens and metabolizable energy of SHW.

5|$|When {{purchased}} by Canada in 1937–38, the four C-class destroyers were refitted to meet Canadian specifications, including {{the installation of}} Type 124 ASDIC. It {{is not clear how}} much Kempenfelt had been modified when she was turned over in October 1939, other than <b>steam</b> <b>heating</b> had yet been fitted.|$|E
5|$|As a fleet flagship, her {{complement}} was 115 {{officers and}} 1,860 men in 1947. Air conditioning was provided {{for many of}} the ship's control spaces, and asbestos insulation was provided on exposed areas of the ship's sides, decks and bulkheads. <b>Steam</b> <b>heating</b> was provided for her armament, instruments, look-out positions and other equipment to make Vanguard suitable for operations in the Arctic. An Action Information Centre was fitted below the main armour deck with facilities to track aircraft and ships around Vanguard.|$|E
5|$|Tantalum is inert against most acids except {{hydrofluoric}} acid and hot sulfuric acid, and hot alkaline solutions also cause tantalum to corrode. This property {{makes it a}} useful metal for chemical reaction vessels and pipes for corrosive liquids. Heat exchanging coils for the <b>steam</b> <b>heating</b> of hydrochloric acid are made from tantalum. Tantalum was extensively used {{in the production of}} ultra high frequency electron tubes for radio transmitters. The tantalum is capable of capturing oxygen and nitrogen by forming nitrides and oxides and therefore helps to sustain the high vacuum needed for the tubes.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to measure the effect of preparation the shrimp head waste to poultry feed. The experiment was conducted to examine the effect of soaking and <b>steam</b> <b>heat</b> treatment of shrimp heads waste (SHW) on nutrient and nutritional quality. The treatment is soaking and length of <b>steam</b> <b>heat</b> the shrimp heads waste. The experiment was designed in Completely Randomized Design, using factorial (3 x 3) with three replication. The first factors was three level concentration of the dusk rice solution (C 1 = 10 %; C 2 = 20 %; and C 3 = 30 %), and the second factors was length <b>steam</b> <b>heat</b> (W 1 = 30 min; W 2 = 45 min; and W 3 = 60 min). Feed was soaked for 48 h prior to <b>steam</b> <b>heat.</b> The results showed that there was no interaction effects (P > 0. 05) between concentration of the dusk rice solution and length of <b>steam</b> <b>heat</b> to dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), lipid and fiber contents of SHW but length of steam factors was significant (P< 0. 05) to dry matter, crude protein, lipid and fiber contents of SHW and digestibility coefficient (in-vitro) of crude protein. There were interactions (P< 0. 01) concentration of the dusk rice solution and length of steam factors to chitin contents. There are no significant differences on metabolizable energy but nitrogen retention and protein digestibility was found to be significantly (P< 0. 05) between the SHW processed than unprocessed. Based on comparative cost analyses and nutritive value indicated, the best treatment was filtered of the dusk rice solution with concentratin 20 % and length of <b>steam</b> <b>heat</b> for 45 min...|$|R

5|$|The 1980s saw {{additional}} renovations. The auditor's {{office and}} the mayor’s office were both renovated, though work on the mayor's office halted when funds were exhausted. The city expanded {{the office of the}} city's attorney, and in 1982 the Portland Building was finished across the street. This allowed the city to move many city offices into a single location. Work was also completed on the exterior, while a new roof was finished. In 1985, the building began a conversion from <b>steam</b> <b>heating.</b>|$|E
5|$|Competition {{with the}} GCR on outer {{suburban}} services on the extension line saw {{the introduction of}} more comfortable Dreadnought Stock carriages from 1910. Ninety-two of these wooden compartment carriages were built, fitted with pressurised gas lighting and <b>steam</b> <b>heating.</b> Electric lighting had replaced the gas by 1917 and electric heaters were added in 1922 to provide warmth when hauled by an electric locomotive. Later formed into rakes of five, six or seven coaches, conductor rail pick-ups on the leading and trailing guard coaches were joined by a bus line and connected to the electric locomotive to help prevent gapping. Two rakes were formed with a Pullman coach that provided a buffet service for a supplementary fare. The Vintage Carriages Trust has three preserved Dreadnought carriages.|$|E
5|$|The NSR {{coaching}} stock was, even until grouping, predominantly four and six wheeled vehicles. Four-wheeled carriages were the norm {{from the start}} and the last were constructed in the 1880s, although by then they had progressed from the unbraked coaches of the 1840s {{with the introduction of}} the communication cord in 1869 and the simple vacuum brake in 1883. The first bogie coaches were introduced in 1906 for use on the Derby–Llandudno service and these were followed by further examples until 1923. By 1919 all carriages, except 13 four-wheelers used on miners trains, had been fitted with <b>steam</b> <b>heating</b> and a number of vehicles had been fitted with through pipes to allow use in trains equipped with Westinghouse brakes. Most carriages were constructed at Stoke but some were purchased from companies such as the Metropolitan Carriage, Wagon and Finance Company.|$|E

50|$|The Adirondack Railway owned four diesel {{locomotives}} and 21 passenger cars. The passenger cars were <b>steam</b> <b>heated</b> and included coaches, a parlor car, a dining car, and a club car.|$|R
5000|$|These are {{commonly}} used for application where a biomass heat source is available such as woodchip boilers to produce hot water or {{if there is a}} <b>steam</b> <b>heat</b> source available.|$|R
5|$|The {{generally}} conservative GWR {{made other}} {{improvements in the}} years before the World War I such as restaurant cars, better conditions for third class passengers, <b>steam</b> <b>heating</b> of trains, and faster express services. These were largely at the initiative of T. I. Allen, the Superintendent of the Line and {{one of a group of}} talented senior managers who led the railway into the Edwardian era: Viscount Emlyn (Earl Cawdor, Chairman from 1895 to 1905); Sir Joseph Wilkinson (general manager from 1896 to 1903), his successor, the former chief engineer Sir James Inglis; and George Jackson Churchward (the Chief Mechanical Engineer). It was during this period that the GWR introduced road motor services as an alternative to building new lines in rural areas, and started using steam rail motors to bring cheaper operation to existing branch lines.|$|E
25|$|Of {{the first}} batch of 300 locomotives, most were fitted with vacuum brakes and <b>steam</b> <b>heating,</b> {{and some of these}} were also fitted with GWR's Automatic Train Control (ATC) safety system.|$|E

25|$|Power {{plants that}} use steam-driven {{turbines}} commonly use heat exchangers to boil water into <b>steam.</b> <b>Heat</b> exchangers or similar units for producing steam from water are often called boilers or steam generators.|$|R
50|$|The equipment, {{originally}} {{built in}} the 1940s, used <b>steam</b> <b>heat.</b> Amtrak's newer EMD F40PH locomotives only supported head-end power (HEP), which meant that the unreliable EMD SDP40F locomotives had to pull it.|$|R
50|$|Like Composition B, IMX {{formulations}} are melt-castable without thermal degradation, and {{are thus}} processed into munitions by a melt pour process starting with a batch melt kettle <b>heated</b> by a <b>steam</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger.|$|R
25|$|Drovers' {{cars were}} used on long {{distance}} livestock trains {{in the western}} United States. The purpose of a drovers' car was to accommodate the livestock's handlers on the journey between the ranch and processing plant. They were usually shorter, older cars, and equipped with stove heaters, as no trainline <b>steam</b> <b>heating</b> was provided.|$|E
25|$|Castlemaine {{paid off}} to reserve on 14 December 1945. She was immobilised at HMAS Cerberus at Crib Point in Victoria as a {{training}} hulk for Engine Room Artificers, {{who ran the}} boilers in part providing <b>steam</b> <b>heating</b> throughout the base. During this period, she was also used for damage control training for service personnel.|$|E
25|$|The first {{water supply}} by {{distillation}} of boiler steam appeared on early paddle steamers {{and used a}} simple iron box in the paddle boxes, cooled by water splash. A steam supply direct from the boiler, avoiding the engine and its lubricants, was led to them. With the development of <b>steam</b> <b>heating</b> jackets around the cylinders of engines such as the trunk engine, the exhaust from this source, again unlubricated, could be condensed.|$|E
50|$|Its final revenue run came on June 14, 1958. When it was {{activated}} {{to supply}} <b>steam</b> <b>heat</b> to a stranded passenger train that December, {{it became the}} last Nickel Plate Road Berkshire under steam.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Steam</b> <b>heat</b> is {{provided}} for the entire station by two coal-fired boilers. There is a 70,000-gallon water reservoir fed by two 540 ft wells. The heating plant used approximately 1,000 tons of coal annually.|$|R
50|$|The {{steaming}} function {{works very}} well for foods like vegetables, potatoes and fish, while convection or combination (convection plus <b>steam)</b> <b>heat</b> is suitable for roasting, braising and baking. One disadvantage of convection heat is that foods tend to dry out more quickly; depending on the product, it may also require very long cooking times. Meanwhile, steaming alone does not get foods crispy enough. Combining convection and <b>steam</b> <b>heat</b> utilizes the advantages provided by each cooking method, yielding tender meat with a crisp outer crust. Users also have complete control over the cooking environment, as the devices allow manual regulation of both temperature and humidity within the cooking chamber.|$|R
25|$|Each saloon had 64 seats, {{arranged}} in eight bays of four around a table, {{either side of}} a central gangway, with two toilets situated in the vestibule at one end. The interior was finished in laminated plastics, creating a light and airy feel. They were fitted with a public address system, double-glazed windows and central fluorescent lighting along their length, the first coaches in Ireland to be so treated. Heating was by steam, supplied from a <b>Steam</b> <b>Heating</b> Van.|$|E
25|$|At {{the outset}} the railway was {{equipped}} with four-wheeled 8-seater coaches designed by Henry Greenly and his son Kenneth. 117 of these had been built by 1928. With only half height doors and no glazing except in the end bulkheads these were totally unsuitable for winter operation, especially to Dungeness. In 1928 the railway took delivery of eight fully enclosed 12-seat bogie coaches built by the Clayton Carriage & Wagon Company of Lincoln which incorporated electric lighting and <b>steam</b> <b>heating.</b>|$|E
25|$|Steam and vacuum brakes, {{as well as}} <b>steam</b> <b>heating</b> were provided. This was {{to enable}} the {{locomotive}} to undertake the shunting of passenger stock should such a role be called for. A second batch of ten locomotives was planned to be constructed at Eastleigh, but the economic climate in 1931 meant that the order was scrapped. By the time trade recovered in the mid 1930s, Maunsell had begun experimenting {{in the use of}} diesel-electric shunting locomotives for these duties, and no further examples were built.|$|E
50|$|The {{vegetables}} are then {{added to the}} grain mixture {{that is in the}} <b>steam</b> <b>heated</b> mixture. The exact ratio of grains to {{vegetables are}} unique to each company resulting in different textures and tastes that are produced.|$|R
50|$|In 1937, 3 K-36s, 482, 483, and 489, were {{equipped}} with <b>steam</b> <b>heat</b> and signal lines to haul passenger trains like the Shavano and the San Juan Express. Eventually in 1945, 484, 485, and 488, were also equipped, too.|$|R
