40|$|AbstractDuring {{carbon dioxide}} storage {{technology}} (carbon capture and storage, CCS) components are exposed to a corrosive environment and mechanical stress, which results in corrosion fatigue and inevitably followed by the a lifetime reduction of these components. In order to gain knowledge upon the corrosion fatigue strength of materials, Samples of high alloyed stainless injection-pipe steels AISI 420 X 46 Cr 13, and X 5 CrNiCuNb 16 - 4 AISI 630 were tested in a at T= 60 °C and ambient pressure in a CO 2 -saturated synthetic aquifer environment similar to possible geological on-shore CCS-sites in the northern German Basin. Therefore a corrosion chamber applied to a resonant testing machine allowing for “in situ” test conditions was designed and successfully tested. In-situ tension compression experiments were established using a resonant testing machine at a frequency as low as 30 – 40 Hz. In addition technical CO 2 was introduced into the closed system at a rate close to 9 L/h to keep stable environmental conditions. Simultaneously electrochemical testing was performed to get information on failure causes and the mechanism of failure during the injection of CO 2 into deep geological layers. S-N plots, micrographic analysis, and surface analysis of the fracture surface were applied to obtain sustainable information on the corrosion fatigue behavior of injection pipe steels. Samples used have a surface roughness of Rz = 4, to simulate technically machined surfaces. X 46 Cr 13 reached {{the maximum number of}} cycles (12. 5 x 106) at a stress amplitude of 173 MPa. X 5 CrNiCuNb 16 - 4 reached the maximum number of cycles (10 x 106) at a stress amplitude at 150 MPa.

40|$|An {{essential}} {{milestone in}} the development of lidar for biological aerosol detection is accurate characterization of agent, simulant, and interferent scattering signatures. MIT Lincoln Laboratory has developed the Standoff Aerosol Active Signature Testbed (SAAST) to further this task, with particular emphasis on the near- and mid-wave infrared. Spectrally versatile and polarimetrically comprehensive, the SAAST can measure an aerosol sample's full Mueller Matrix across multiple elastic scattering angles for comparison to model predictions. A single tunable source covers the 1. 35 - 5 µm spectral range, and waveband-specific optics and photoreceivers can generate and analyze all six classic polarization states. The SAAST is highly automated for efficient and consistent measurements, and can accommodate a wide angular <b>scatter</b> <b>range,</b> including oblique angles for sample characterization and very near backscatter for lidar performance evaluation.

40|$|In this paper, {{a method}} of {{predicting}} failure in bonded composite joints subjected to combined mechanical loading and environmental degradation is described. The technique {{is based on a}} coupled mechanical-diffusion finite-element analysis combined with an appropriate failure criterion. The method is evaluated by predicting the fatigue thresholds of epoxy-CFRP lap-strap joints preconditioned and tested in dry and wet environments. The coupled stress-diffusion method was shown to be capable of predicting correctly the effect that different environments would have on the fatigue resistance of the joints. Both elastic and elasto-plastic fracture criteria were then used to quantitatively predict the fatigue thresholds. The elastoplastic fracture criterion was the most suitable when moisture was encountered at elevated temperatures and was capable of predicting fatigue thresholds within the experimental <b>scatter</b> <b>range.</b> It is concluded that the technique described is a powerful and flexible way to predict failure in bonded joints subjected {{to a wide variety of}} loads and environmental conditions.

The carbon foams were firstly characterized by measuring compressive and shear mechanical proper-ties. The carbon foam possessed highly anisotropic properties between in-plane and through-the-thickness directions. The foams aged at 316 C (600 F) for 100 h in air lost 0. 6 % of their weight and showed little degradation in the properties within the <b>scatter</b> <b>range</b> of test data. The carbon foams tested at an elevated temperature of 316 C (600 F) showed no degradation in the compressive modulus and strength {{as compared to the}} properties measured at a room temperature of 21 C (70 F). Sandwich beams with laminated composite facesheets were fabricated with a carbon foam core and tested under static and fatigue four-point bending loads.

Abstract Differential cross sections (DCS) for inelastic electron scattering to the n = 2 states in helium have been measured at incident energies of 80 eV, 100 eV and 120 eV. These DCS have been determined across the complete angular <b>scattering</b> <b>range</b> (0 ° to 180 °) using a magnetic angle changer (MAC) with a soft-iron core. The converging close-coupling (CCC), R-matrix with pseudostates (RMPS), and B-spline R-matrix (BSR) {{methods have been}} used to calculate these DCS. Agreement between the experimental data and the predictions from these highly sophisticated theoretical methods is generally good. The remaining discrepancies mainly occur at small and large angles for the triplet states 2 3 S and 2 3 P, whereas excellent agreement is found between 30 º- 150 º. The small-angle differences are likely due to contamination of the observed experimental signal from the neighbouring 2 1 S and 2 1 P states. The present results demonstrate the effective use of a soft-iron core magnetic angle changer for DCS measurements at intermediate energies, extending the operational energy range of such devices by a factor of approximately 25 [...] 4 Corresponding Author.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} U-V CMR analysis for 3 local (z 1. 2 {{for the bulk}} of the stars in red cluster galaxies, and a maximum age spread of 5. 2 Gyr. We note that none of the slopes exhibit a break as claimed by Metcalf et al., and using colors from equal-light apertures does not remove the CMR slope. Our findings expand the single Coma data point and provide a much-needed z= 0 base-line for comparisons to high-z cluster U-V CMRs. The CMR <b>scatter</b> <b>range</b> in low-z clusters is consistent with that found in high-z clusters, suggesting little evolution in the stars of red cluster galaxies out to z~ 1. To identify the most recently accreted galaxies, we divide each cluster's membership into 3 galaxy populations based on CMR-relative U-V color. Blue galaxies make up 18 - 23 % of each cluster's galaxy counts above 0. 1 L^star. We test the hypothesis that CMR-relative color represents rough cluster infall times and find that blue galaxies are spatially, kinematically, and morphologically distinct from red cluster members. These distinctions provide further evidence that bluer members are indeed more recently accreted field spirals as expected in an hierarchical universe.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a parameter-free theory of shear-generated turbulence at asymptotically high Reynolds numbers in incompressible fluids. It {{is based on}} a two-fluids concept. Both components are materially identical and inviscid. The first component is an ensemble of quasi-rigid dipole-vortex tubes as quasi-particles in chaotic motion. The second is a superfluid performing evasive motions between the tubes. The local dipole motions follow Helmholtz' law. The vortex radii scale with the energy-containing length scale. Collisions between quasi-particles lead either to annihilation (likewise rotation, turbulent dissipation) or to scattering (counterrotation, turbulent diffusion). There are analogies with birth and death processes of population dynamics and their master equations. For free homogeneous decay the theory predicts the TKE to follow 1 /t. With an adiabatic condition at the wall it predicts the logarithmic law with von Karman's constant as 1 /√(2 pi) = 0. 399. Likewise rotating couples form dissipative patches almost at rest (→ intermittency) wherein the spectrum evolves like an "Apollonian gear" as discussed first by Herrmann, 1990. On this basis the prefactor of the 3 D-wavenumber spectrum is predicted as (1 / 3) (4 pi) ^ 2 / 3 = 1. 8; in the Lagrangian frequency spectrum it is simply 2.

Cumulative probability distribution function for the FMCS and ultimate tensile strength at room temperature (RT) of (0) (sub 8), (0 (sub 2) / 90 (sub 2), and (+/- 45 (sub 2)) (sub S) laminates have been simulated and the sensitivity of primitive variables to the respective strengths have been quantified. Computationally predicted scatter of the strengths for a uniaxial laminate have been compared with those from limited experimental data. Also the experimental procedure used in the tests has been described briefly. Results show a very good agreement between the computational simulation and the experimental data. Dominating failure modes in (0) (sub 8), (0 / 90) (sub s) and (+/- 45) (sub S) laminates have been identified. Results indicate that the first matrix cracking strength for the (0) (sub S), and (0 / 90) (sub S) laminates is sensitive to the thermal properties, modulus and strengths of both the fiber and matrix whereas the ultimate tensile strength is sensitive to the fiber strength and the fiber volume ratio.
