Seven sources of case ascertainment were used and each patient was classified according to both the Poser criteria and the McDonald guidelines. Results: The prevalence of multiple sclerosis in Devon was 118 per 100 000 (definite and probable cases, Poser criteria) in a population of 341 796, on the prevalence day.

Nine hundred and ninety-seven cases of primary cutaneous malignant melanoma less than 9. 75 mm thick, excised in Scotland between 1979 and 1983 inclusive, were examined to see if this could be confirmed. An adjusted Cox's regression analysis showed that age, sex, site and thickness were all significant predictors of survival. Thickness was grouped either empirically or by the breakpoints reported by other authors. It was then entered into a model either as a regressor or as a factored variable. The ranges 0 - 9. 75 mm and 0 - 2 mm were studied separately. In the 0 - 9. 75 mm range the factored variable was a statistically significant better fit than the regressor for each set of breakpoints, including an empirical analysis with eight groups. This suggests that there is no single best fit and that a step-effect is unlikely. Across the 0 - 2 mm range there was no significant improvement in the fit if thickness was entered as a factored variable, again indicating that a <b>step</b> <b>effect</b> is unlikely.

However, there are reasons to include the pads in the EM simulation instead of having them inside the components models.

The demand in space is for deployable, flexible arrays with high power-to-weight ratios and long-term stability (15 - 20 years). In addition, there is also the demand that these arrays be produced by scalable, low-cost, high yield, processes. An approach to significantly reduce costs and increase reliability is to interconnect individual cells series via monolithic integration. Both CIS and CdTe semiconductor films are optimum absorber materials for thin-film n-p heterojunction solar cells, having band gaps between 0. 9 - 1. 5 ev and demonstrated small area efficiencies, with cadmium sulfide window layers, above 16. 5 percent. Both CIS and CdTe polycrystalline thin-film cells have been produced on a laboratory scale by a variety of physical and chemical deposition methods, including evaporation, sputtering, and electrodeposition. Translating laboratory processes which yield these high efficiency, small area cells into the design of a manufacturing process capable of producing 1 -sq ft modules, however, requires a quantitative understanding of each individual step in the process and its (each <b>step)</b> <b>effect</b> on overall module performance. With a proper quantification and understanding of material transport and reactivity for each individual step, manufacturing process can be designed that is not 'reactor-specific' and can be controlled intelligently with the design parameters of the process.

Both laser and mechanical scribing operations are used to monolithically integrate (series interconnect) the individual cells into modules. Results will be presented at the cell and module development levels with a brief description of the test methods used to qualify these devices for space applications.

As a subsequent <b>step,</b> <b>effect</b> of ultrasound under different conditions (time, power intensity and temperature) as a pretreatment for deacetylation of chitin from North Atlantic shrimp on yield, purity, time {{and degree of}} deacetylation was studied. Yield, mineral and protein content were determined after each processing step. Purity of extracted chitin was assessed as total amount of glucosamine in samples. The crystallinity Index was determined using wide angle X-ray scattering. Analysis of scanning electron microscope images confirmed morphological changes in samples. Degree of acetylation was determined by both Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometry, (FTIR) and direct titration. Yield of chitin from NAS decreased from 17. 02 ± 0. 66 % to 11. 09 ± 1. 46 % of initial mass with extensive sonication, for FWP the yield decreased from 8. 28 ± 1. 27 to 5. 02 ± 0. 64 of initial mass, which was attributed to increased concentrations of depolymerized materials in the wash water. Removal of minerals was not affected by sonication. Application of ultrasound enhanced removal of proteins for NAS from 0. 58 ± 0. 08 % to 0. 32 ± 0. 03 % dry weight and for FWP 0. 028 ± 0. 06 to 0. 013 ± 0. 001 dry weight. High Intensity Ultrasound as a pretreatment resulted in accelerated removal of the acetyl-groups under industrial conditions. For samples sonicated for 60 minutes resulted in 90 % deacetylated chitosan after 100 minutes of treatment. Application of ultrasound for 15 minutes at 65 and 43 Wcm- 2 resulted in DDA of 84. 03 and 63. 60 %, respectively. Samples sonicated at 30 °C 65 Wcm- 2 for 15 and 30 minutes resulted in 74 and 78 % deacetylation of samples. Results were attributed to the chemical and mechanical effect of ultrasound. High intensity ultrasound as a pre-treatment promotes conversion of chitin to chitosan through changes in the chitin structure and by enhancing accessibility of the solvents to its reactive sites. Increased surface area and higher homogeneity of sonicated chitin particles may also be responsible for its increased reactivity. This may results in benefits such as lower production cost, less time and better control of the deacetylation process. ...|$|E

40|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{computational}} methods are available for exploring molecular structures and reactivity in chemistry. These range from molecular mechanics calculations allowing determination of the geometry of a molecule to ab initio calculations for the electronic structure of compounds. Electronic structure calculations {{can be carried out}} with sufficient rigor so that the results are now comparable with experimental results in many cases. Density Functional Theory (DFT) with hybrid functional like B 3 LYP, for example, is very popular especially for studies on organometallic molecules and their reactions. Traditional ab initio approaches including Hartree-Fock (HF) and post-HF methods that include configuration interaction, such as MP 2 and MP 4 continue to be used, often for comparison with DFT based methods. Semi-empirical methods now appear to have only limited use except in large systems, in combination with molecular mechanics (MM) calculations. A relatively new use of MM for large systems is in hybrid calculations where the reactive center of the system is treated at a higher level leaving the remainder to be treated at the MM level. These hybrid QM/MM (quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics) calculations, such as ONIOM (our own n-layered integrated molecular orbital and molecular mechanics developed by Morokuma and co-workers) enable one to treat the steric bulk of the big system effectively and computationally efficiently. They appear to be very standard methods particularly in studies relating to reactions of organometallic systems and structures of large biomolecules. A short description of these methods is given below. • ab initio: a {{wide variety of}} programs that calculate the electronic structure of molecules using the Schrödinger equation, the values of the fundamental constants and the atomic numbers of the atoms present (Atkins, 1991). Molecular structures, optimized {{as a function of the}} electronic structure, are valuable starting points for many studies. •	Density Functional Theory (DFT) : a theoretical model in which the energy of an N-electron system is described as a functional of the density. •	Semi-empirical techniques use approximations to evaluate the overlap, repulsion and exchange integrals in solving the Schrodinger equation. Often, these integrals are not evaluated but estimated to reproduce experimental data. •	Molecular mechanics uses classical physics to explain and interpret the behavior of atoms and molecules. •	Molecular dynamics (MD) : Newton’s laws of motion are used to examine the time-dependent behavior of systems, including vibrations and Brownian motion, using a classical mechanical description. When combined with DFT, it leads to the Car-Parrinello method. •	QM/MM method: It is a molecular simulation method that combines the strength of both QM (accuracy) and MM (speed) calculations, thus resulting in an extremely powerful tool for the study of bigger systems like chemical process in solution, interaction of drugs with biomolecules etc. Several commercial and educational packages in computational chemistry include a suite of programs that enable study of organic and organometallic molecules in an integrated fashion. While no list can be comprehensive, those that are more popular and useful are listed in several websites URL ([URL] In the early days of computational chemistry up to 1980 's, detailed studies were only carried out on small organic compounds or empirical studies were carried out on transition metal containing organometallics. However, in recent times, significant advancements in theoretical methods and computer capability (hardware and software), have led to the acceleration of theoretical and computational studies of complex systems including compounds containing transition metal elements. Computational and theoretical studies of organometallic complexes and their reactions have gained immense popularity and the numbers of papers including theoretical studies are dramatically increasing. One reason for this popularity is that organometallic complexes exhibit unusual geometries, bonding, and reactivity which often do not fall into the domain of inorganic or organic chemistry making them difficult to understand. Catalysis is one of the most extensively studied areas in organometallic chemistry where computational studies already make a real and valuable contribution to the analysis and interpretation of experimental data. However, what might be called ‘in silico’ catalyst screening and design, has rarely been achieved. One might say that successful prediction of catalyst performance is still a dream. A recent review summarizes the current state of the art in computational chemistry as applied to organometallic catalysis, covering both calculated ligand property descriptors and mechanistic studies of catalytic cycles. 1 Some of the widely studied catalytic reactions of current interest, that provide huge scope for computational and theoretical analysis, are allylic alkylation (Pd), 2 hydrogenation (Rh), 3 hydroformylation (Rh), 4 alkene metathesis (Ru), 5 cross-coupling (Pd), 6 C–H activation (Pd) 7 and amination (Pd). 8 There are many more examples where computational studies appear to be very useful for analysis of crystal structures and NMR structures or prediction of structures where no experimental data are available for complicated organometallic systems. There are a number of studies on drug-DNA/nucleobases interactions using QM/MM-MD simulations where people have investigated the interactions of metal complexes with double stranded (ds) DNA/nucleobases and the effects of their binding on the local and the global structure of DNA. QM/MM methods are also very helpful for studying catalytic reactions, interpretation of structure of large systems (proteins) and understanding reactions in biological systems. Scope of the Thesis In this thesis an attempt is made to use computational chemistry to understand organometallic reactions that are of significance from biological and synthetic view points, such as the action of organometallic complexes on DNA and the mechanism of some catalytic reactions. In many of these cases, the key step involved a nucleophillic attack. Specifically four such problems have been addressed where experimental results are not sufficient to provide a complete mechanistic picture of the reaction. Hence, the thesis contains four chapters with each having an independent brief introduction. The first chapter deals with the substitution reaction where water replaces chloride ion in the piano stool type ruthenium (II) -arene complexes and subsequently coordination of Ru to guanine/adenine occurs in these complexes. These steps have been studied using density functional theory at the B 3 LYP level. The complexes have promising anticancer activity. These nucleophilic substitution reactions are very important for activating these complexes so that they can interact with DNA, because DNA is thought to be primary target for their anticancer activity. In this chapter, both associative and dissociative pathways have been explored in the gas phase, as well as in the presence of other solvents for substitution reactions. Among the associative paths, a variety of possibilities can exist for the hydrolysis based on the direction of the nucleophilic attack by a water molecule. The proposed theoretical model for hydrolysis provides new insight into the hydrolysis process in half sandwich ruthenium complexes. The second chapter deals with the QM/MM calculations to investigate the structural and electronic properties of drug-DNA interactions, where DNA acts as nucleophile towards the metal complex. A series of piano-stool type ruthenium (II) -arene complexes were selected for the present study. These interactions were analyzed using the two layer ONIOM method. The importance of this study lies in the detailed understanding of factors that govern DNA binding and reactivity which is clearly of great pharmacological interest, as it may provide the basis for designing better anticancer agents. Experimental results that explore the structural feature of DNA-metal complexes at a molecular level are very limited. Thus theoretical calculations of molecular and electronic structure represent a valuable complement to experiments. They provide an alternative way to explore structure-activity relationships, and the drug binding mechanism, in detail. The third chapter reports the use of QM/MM methods in understanding the reaction mechanism and enantioselectivity in an organic transformation. In this section, a computational investigation of the enantioselectivity observed in the allylation of cinnamaldehyde, catalyzed by chiral platinum phosphinite complexes, have been carried out. The catalysts are ascorbic acid based phosphinite complexes where enantioselectivity depends on the substitution of benzyl groups on the chiral phosphinite ligands. From the experiment, it is not clear how the effect of an ancillary ligand can make such a big impact on enantioselectivity. To find out the origin of stereoselectivity, a computational study was taken up. A reaction mechanism was established where the nucleophilic attack determines the rate of the reaction and the corresponding enantioselectivity. A screening process has been utilized to select relevant reactant adducts and corresponding transition states from approximately 200 theoretically possible conformers using MM calculations. Finally with the help of QM/MM calculations, the numbers of contributions of these conformers were estimated. This approach correctly predicts the enantioselectivity in these reactions catalyzed by these complexes especially when the experimental enantioselectivity is very high. The fourth chapter of the thesis discusses the use of computational techniques to study the nucleophilic attack of an imine on a Ti-olefin complex. The reaction of Grignard reagents with imines mediated by stoichiometric amounts of titanium isopropoxide has been reported recently. On the basis of deuterium labeling experiments, nucleophilic attack of an imine on a Ti-olefin complex was believed to be a key <b>step.</b> <b>Effect</b> of deuterium labeling on the ratio of products formed is not easy to understand from experiments. Hence a computational study was performed using the DFT method to establish the mechanism of substitution and to understand the role of deuterium labeling. The thesis also includes a study of Cu-Cu interactions using Atoms in Molecules (AIM) theory in copper complexes with reasonably short Cu-Cu distances. The concept of bond critical points (BCP) from AIM analysis is employed to investigate the CuI-CuI bonding interactions in ligand unsupported copper complexes where the CuI-CuI contacts are shorter than the sum of their van der Waals radii. There is extensive debate about the nature of interactions between d 10 "closed shell" systems in copper (CuI) complexes, which is known as cuprophilicity. In this study, an attempt has been made to compute the electron density between the two CuI centers and examine the nature of this “interaction”. As this falls outside the main theme of nucleophilic interactions in metal complexes, it has been relegated to an appendix...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} finite sample {{properties}} of the two-step estimators of dynamic factor models when unobservable common factors are estimated by the principal components methods in the first <b>step.</b> <b>Effects</b> {{of the number of}} individual series on the estimation of an auto-regressive model of a common factor are investigated both by theoretical analysis and by a Monte Carlo simulation. When the number of the series is not sufficiently large relative to the number of time series observations, the auto-regressive coefficient estimator of positively auto-correlated factor is biased downward and the bias is larger for a more persistent factor. In such a case, bootstrap procedures are effective in reducing the bias and bootstrap confidence intervals outperform naive asymptotic confidence intervals in terms of controlling the coverage probability...|$|R

The instruments {{include a}} pair of long travelling-wave antennas, a 37 -m dipole, two radiometers making one frequency scan every 144 sec, and two rapid-sampling total-power burst receivers which cover the range from 0. 025 to 13. 1 MHz in 32 discrete <b>steps.</b> <b>Effects</b> of terrestrial noise on RAE- 1 and RAE- 2 observations are discussed, and {{it is noted that}} RAE- 2 is uniquely capable of observing repeated lunar occultations of strong radio sources at very low frequencies. Some observational programs are briefly noted, including observations of the galactic background distribution, measurements of lunar occultations of solar radio bursts, and searches for more radio sources among the planets, galactic objects, and extragalactic sources...|$|R

40|$|An {{oxidation}} resistant coating {{is produced}} on carbon-base materials, {{and the same}} processing <b>step</b> <b>effects</b> an infiltration of the substrate with silicon containing material. The process comprises making a slurry of nickel and silicon powders in a nitrocellulose lacquer, spraying onto the graphite or carbon-carbon substrate, and sintering in vacuum to form a fused coating that wets and covers the surface as well as penetrates into the pores of the substrate. Optimum wetting and infiltration occurs {{in the range of}} Ni- 60 w/o Si to Ni- 90 w/o Si with deposited thicknesses of 25 - 100 mg/sq. cm. Sintering temperatures of about 1200 C to about 1400 C are used, depending on the melting point of the specific coating composition. The sintered coating results in Ni-Si intermetallic phases and SiC, both of which are highly oxidation resistant...|$|R
