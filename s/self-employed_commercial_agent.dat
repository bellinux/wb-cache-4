5000|$|English {{private law}} has {{traditionally}} been averse to general clauses and has repeatedly rejected the adoption of good faith as a core concept of private law. Over the past thirty years, EU law has injected the notion of [...] "good faith" [...] into confined areas of English private law. The majority of these EU interventions have concerned {{the protection of consumers}} in their interactions with businesses. Only Directive 86/653/EEC on the co-ordination of the laws of the Member States relating to <b>self-employed</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>agents</b> has brought [...] "good faith" [...] to English commercial law.|$|R

Finally, it charts the areas of the pre-existing common law agency rules that are affected by this imported notion and appraises the resulting alterations to the positive law...|$|R

40|$|In {{one of the}} {{earliest}} cases on the <b>Commercial</b> <b>Agents</b> (Council Directive) Regulations 1993, Staughton LJ made mention of the belief that ‘commercial agents are a down-trodden race’ entitled to protection from their principals. Down-trodden or not, they receive protection from the Regulations in the form of compensation when their agencies are terminated. The choice of an appropriate and predictable measure of compensation has proved elusive in the English courts because English courts have had to apply the Regulations without quite understanding the rational basis underpinning the protection afforded to <b>commercial</b> <b>agents.</b> <b>Commercial</b> <b>agents</b> are intermediaries between their principals and their principals' business partners, but the Regulations treat them as integral to their principals' businesses. Are <b>commercial</b> <b>agents</b> therefore entitled to compensation on the basis that they are quasi-employees, or are they in some inchoate way quasi-equity-participants in their principals' businesses? Are they being compensated for loss or are they recovering gains that their principals should not retain? The answers to these questions are clearer now that the House of Lords in Lonsdale v Howard & Hallam Ltd has authoritatively laid down the standard for calculating compensation for <b>commercial</b> <b>agents...</b>|$|R
