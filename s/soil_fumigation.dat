50|$|Crop {{rotation}} is {{also used}} to control pests and diseases that can become established in the soil over time. The changing of crops in a sequence decreases the population level of pests by (1) interrupting pest life cycles and (2) interrupting pest habitat.

By regularly changing crops and keeping the soil occupied by cover crops instead of lying fallow, pest cycles can be broken or limited, especially cycles that benefit from overwintering in residue. For example, root-knot nematode is a serious problem for some plants in warm climates and sandy soils, where it slowly builds up to high levels in the soil, and can severely damage plant productivity by cutting off circulation from the plant roots.

Stable isotope ratios of DOC size classes were measured using size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) coupled on-line to liquid chromatography-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (LC-IRMS). SEC resolved DOC into three size classes: very high molecular weight/vHMW (> 10 kDa), high molecular weight/HMW (0. 4 - 10 kDa) and low molecular weight/LMW (< 0. 4 kDa). HMW DOC was most abundant in all seasons, soil types and depths. In contrast, vHMW DOC was only seen post snowmelt in upper 20 cm and was mainly (87 ± 9 %) plant-derived.

Solarization increased the total numbers of bacteria and actinomycetes, and the proportion of bacteria and fungi antogonistic to Fusarium oxysporum, F. solani and Rhizoctonia solani. The proportion of actinomycetes antagonistic to these fungi, however, did not differ between solarized and control soil treatments. There was a significant reduction in disease in plants grown in infested fumigated soil to which a 10 % concentration of solarized soil had been added, suggesting the development of microbial suppression in solarized soil. Phytophthora cryptogea was eradicated to 30 cm by solarization as well as by fumigation. Solarization eliminated R. solani but not F. oxysporum to a soil depth of 10 cm.
