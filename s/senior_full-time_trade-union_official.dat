40|$|Armed {{with complex}} motion controls, {{sophisticated}} sensors, gyroscopes, and fast computers, {{a new generation}} of semi-autonomous machines has evolved with high levels of spatial awareness, memory, and animal-like dexterity. These systems possess astonishing powers-including the ability to navi¬gate elevated terrain, avoid obstacles, and react to constantly changing environmental circumstances in real time. Applying these new technologies to architecture is the main goal of my Honors thesis. My project is a design proposal for a new type of off-road, mobile housing system that could be utilized as a alternative for the current social practices of <b>Senior</b> <b>Full-time</b> Recreational Vehicle Communities in the South Western United States. This clientele consists of a large demographic of retirees who have relin¬quished their sedentary homes for a life off-the-grid and on the road. These Internet connected, mod¬ern day nomads are estimated to number between two and three million. Ultimately, I will be designing a multi-functional, self-contained, satellite up linked, web connected, solar powered, walking house that-unlike an automobile or RV-does not require customized environments-such as roads-to function smoothly. The result is a noninvasive 'post-infrastructure' urbanism that results in the develop¬ment of nomadic cities while still leaving the natural world unconstructed, untouched, and unharmed.
