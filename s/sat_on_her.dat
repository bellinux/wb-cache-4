25|$|From {{the start}} Genie showed {{interest}} in many hospital staff members, often approaching and walking with complete strangers, but Kent {{said she did}} not seem to distinguish between people and showed no signs of attachment to anybody, including her mother and brother. At first she would not allow anyone to touch her, quickly shying away from any physical contact, and while she <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> mother's lap when requested she remained very tense and got up as quickly as possible; hospital staff wrote that her mother seemed entirely oblivious to Genie's emotions and actions. Genie's behavior was typically highly antisocial, and proved extremely difficult for others to control. Regardless of where she was she constantly salivated and spat, and continually sniffed and blew her nose on anything that happened to be nearby. She had no sense of personal property, frequently pointing to or taking something she wanted from someone else, or situational awareness. Doctors wrote that she acted on impulse irrespective of the setting, especially noting that she frequently engaged in open masturbation and would sometimes attempt to involve older men in it.|$|E
60|$|She {{turned to}} Leonard Dickinson, who <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> other side....|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} Madeline <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> horse with shut eyes. She dreaded the light.|$|E
50|$|Omukazendu wa toora omuatje ne mu pukata. The woman {{picked up}} the child and <b>sat</b> him <b>on</b> <b>her</b> lap.|$|R
60|$|The simple {{kindness}} {{of her words}} fell clearly. Wing went out from her presence as one entrusted with a grave commission. She <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> with <b>her</b> thoughts.|$|R
60|$|Her father incessantly lashed <b>her,</b> <b>On</b> {{water and}} bread She was grudgingly fed; Whenever her father he thrashed her <b>Her</b> mother <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>her</b> head.|$|R
6000|$|That {{night before}} she went to bed Stephen came and <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> father's knee, and after sundry pattings and kissings whispered in his ear: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 11 [...] As I have walk'd in Alabama {{my morning}} walk, [...] I have seen where the she-bird the mocking-bird <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> nest in [...] the briers {{hatching}} her brood.|$|E
60|$|Winnifred {{was now in}} the humblest lodgings in the humblest part of London. A simple {{bedroom and}} sitting-room sufficed for her wants. Here she <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> trunk, bravely {{planning}} for the future.|$|E
6000|$|Cecily relapsed into anxious thought, {{and care}} <b>sat</b> visibly <b>on</b> <b>her</b> brow {{for the rest}} of the day. Next morning she came to me and said: ...|$|R
50|$|Externally, this depicts Virgin Mary, {{sitting on}} a throne under a Gothic canopy lilies, with a victorious attitude, showing child Jesus <b>sat</b> upright <b>on</b> <b>her</b> left knee.|$|R
60|$|The {{light went}} out of Una's eyes. Her lips trembled. She <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>her</b> stool again, a pathetic little figure of disappointment, and began to cry.|$|R
60|$|Mammy Easter {{opened the}} door, and then {{stood with her}} arms akimbo, amply filling its place. Her lips protruded, and an {{expression}} of defiance hard to describe <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> honest black face.|$|E
60|$|But Noel <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> bed, {{hugging her}} knees, {{listening}} to the night, to the emptiness and silence; each minute so much lost of the little, little time left, {{that she might have}} been with him.|$|E
60|$|And so it {{happened}} Rose found herself seated beside the big blond man whose face seemed so weary and so old. Paul <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> left, and they chatted easily on college affairs. He was from Ann Arbor, he told her.|$|E
60|$|Amelia Phillips was {{bending over}} the fire. She {{came forward and}} took Emily's parcels and wraps with a certain {{gentleness}} that <b>sat</b> oddly <b>on</b> <b>her</b> grim personality.|$|R
60|$|There Mary's face became {{illuminated}} {{as a step}} approached, and {{a gentleman}} with grizzled hair, and a thoughtful, gentle face came out, and <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>her</b> other side.|$|R
60|$|She <b>sat</b> long <b>on</b> <b>her</b> chair without caring {{to begin}} undressing. She sat and mused with <b>her</b> hands crossed <b>on</b> <b>her</b> lap. She <b>sat</b> and thought, and her {{thoughts}} {{were all about}} Cyril Waring.|$|R
60|$|She played {{without a}} copy of the music. He stood at her side, while Lucy, the little mouse, <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> mother's skirts, {{pressing}} Lettie's silk slippers in turn upon the pedals. The mother and the boy sang their song.|$|E
60|$|At {{the second}} repetition, Fenella threw back her veiling tresses, {{so as to}} show the melancholy which <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> brow; while she sadly shook her head, and intimated by {{imperfect}} muttering, but of the softest and most plaintive kind, her organic deficiency.|$|E
60|$|Captain Willoughby drew a {{chair to}} the side of that of his wife, seated himself, and took her hand before he answered. Little Evert, who <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> knee, was played with, for a moment, as if to defer a disagreeable duty; not till then did he even speak.|$|E
60|$|There she <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> a couch, <b>her</b> eyes {{red with}} weeping, and her curling hair unbound.|$|R
6000|$|Her father incessantly lashed <b>her,</b> [...] <b>On</b> {{water and}} bread [...] She was grudgingly fed; [...] Whenever her father he thrashed her [...] <b>Her</b> mother <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>her</b> head.|$|R
60|$|When Kate {{retired to}} her sleeping-apartment that night, she endeavoured to comport {{herself in her}} usual manner; but all her efforts failed. She <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>her</b> bed, and {{remained}} motionless for half an hour; then she started and sighed deeply; then she smiled and opened her Bible, but forgot to read it; then she rose hastily, sighed again, took off her gown, hang it up on a peg, and, returning to the dressing-table, <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>her</b> best bonnet; then she cried a little, {{at which point the}} candle suddenly went out; so she gave a slight scream, and at last went to bed in the dark.|$|R
6000|$|As I {{have walked}} in Alabama my morning walk, I have seen where the she-bird, the mocking-bird, <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> {{nest in the}} [...] briars, {{hatching}} her brood. I have seen the he-bird also; I have paused to hear him, near at hand, inflating his throat, and joyfully [...] singing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Emma {{said a lot}} o' things," [...] replied Mrs. Negget, angrily. [...] "I'm sure by the lot {{she had to say}} you'd ha' {{thought she}} was the missis and me the servant. I gave her a month's notice at once, and she went {{straight}} up stairs and <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> box and cried." ...|$|E
60|$|And all {{the while}} the she-wolf <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> {{haunches}} and smiled. She was made glad in vague ways by the battle, for this was the love-making of the Wild, the sex-tragedy {{of the natural world}} that was tragedy only to those that died. To those that survived it was not tragedy, but realisation and achievement.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then it's no account talking," [...] {{said the}} woman, {{suddenly}} growing quite calm; and, clasping her child tighter in her arms, she <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>her</b> box, {{turned her back}} round, and gazed listlessly into the river.|$|R
60|$|Then, having shaken hands heartily, Mr. Acton went away, and Jack {{flew off}} to have rejoicings with Jill, who <b>sat</b> up <b>on</b> <b>her</b> sofa, without knowing it, so eager was she {{to hear all}} about the call.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Matlack {{was seated}} on his log, and he smoked, while Mrs. Perkenpine <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> the ground, <b>her</b> head thrown back and her arms hugging her knees.|$|R
60|$|Before {{speaking}} {{he looked}} at her with a great new interest in his eye. It {{was the first time that}} he had seen her thus, and she was altered in more than dress. A soberly-sweet expression <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face. It was of a rare and peculiar shade--something that he had never seen before in woman.|$|E
60|$|Blondel tuned his harp to his boldest measure, {{to welcome}} the {{introduction}} of the victor into the pavilion of Queen Berengaria. He entered, supported on either side by his sponsors, Richard and Thomas Longsword, and knelt gracefully down before the Queen, though more than half the homage was silently rendered to Edith, who <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> right hand.|$|E
60|$|Brangwen {{left her}} there, {{in charge of}} the barman, whilst he went to see about the selling of some young stirks. Farmers, butchers, drovers, dirty, uncouth men from whom she shrank instinctively stared down at her as she <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> seat, then went to get their drink, talking in {{unabated}} tones. All was big and violent about her.|$|E
6000|$|Presently, I remember, she <b>sat</b> back <b>on</b> <b>her</b> {{heels and}} looked up into my face. [...] "We've done wrong--and parting's paying. It's time to pay. We needn't have paid, if we'd kept to the track.... You and I, Master, we've got to be men." ...|$|R
60|$|I <b>sat</b> by <b>her</b> <b>on</b> {{the sofa}} and {{finished}} {{the story of the}} Sicilian lovers.|$|R
60|$|At one {{of those}} moments, a voice which she had not yet {{distinguished}} addressed her in the Anglo-Norman language, and asked, with apparent interest, if she <b>sat</b> safely <b>on</b> <b>her</b> saddle, offering {{at the same time}} to have her accoutrements altered at her pleasure and convenience.|$|R
