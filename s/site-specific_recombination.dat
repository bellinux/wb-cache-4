5|$|The Holliday {{junction}} {{is a key}} intermediate in homologous recombination, {{a biological}} process that increases genetic diversity by shifting genes between two chromosomes, as well as <b>site-specific</b> <b>recombination</b> events involving integrases. They are additionally involved in repair of double-strand breaks. In addition, cruciform structures involving Holliday junctions can arise to relieve helical strain in symmetrical sequences in DNA supercoils. While four-arm junctions also appear in functional RNA molecules, such as U1 spliceosomal RNA and the hairpin ribozyme of the tobacco ringspot virus, these usually contain unpaired nucleotides in between the paired double-helical domains, and thus do not strictly adopt the Holliday structure.|$|E
25|$|The {{integration}} of phage λ {{takes place at}} a special attachment site in the bacterial and phage genomes, called attλ. The sequence of the bacterial att site is called attB, between the gal and bio operons, and consists of the parts B-O-B', whereas the complementary sequence in the circular phage genome is called attP and consists of the parts P-O-P'. The integration itself is a sequential exchange (see genetic recombination) via a Holliday junction and requires both the phage protein Int and the bacterial protein IHF (integration host factor). Both Int and IHF bind to attP and form an intasome, a DNA-protein-complex designed for <b>site-specific</b> <b>recombination</b> of the phage and host DNA. The original B-O-B' sequence is changed by the integration to B-O-P'-phage DNA-P-O-B'. The phage DNA {{is now part of}} the host's genome.|$|E

50|$|<b>Site-specific</b> <b>recombination,</b> {{also known}} as {{conservative}} <b>site-specific</b> <b>recombination,</b> {{is a type of}} genetic recombination in which DNA strand exchange takes place between segments possessing at least a certain degree of sequence homology. Site-specific recombinases (SSRs) perform rearrangements of DNA segments by recognizing and binding to short DNA sequences (sites), at which they cleave the DNA backbone, exchange the two DNA helices involved and rejoin the DNA strands. While in some <b>site-specific</b> <b>recombination</b> systems just a recombinase enzyme and the recombination sites is enough to perform all these reactions, in other systems a number of accessory proteins and/or accessory sites are also needed. Multiple genome modification strategies, among these recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE), an advanced approach for the targeted introduction of transcription units into predetermined genomic loci, rely on the capacities of SSRs.|$|E

40|$|Patterning of {{the body}} axes of the Drosophila embryo depends on maternally {{expressed}} genes, some of which function in the follicular epithelium of the developing egg chamber. Many such genes were identified in genetic screens for homozygous mutant females that produce abnormal embryos. However, mutations in zygotically required maternal effect genes are homozygous lethal, and therefore viable females cannot be recovered using this screening approach. This limitation can be overcome by generating homozygous mutant follicle cell clones in heterozygous females using a system that induces <b>site-specific</b> mitotic <b>recombination</b> events. However, to date, eggs produced from egg chambers with complete follicle cell clones cannot be directly identified. We have developed an eggshell marker for follicle cell clones using a dominant negative (DN) allele of the gene defective chorion (dec). Females with a single copy of this allele, decDN, lay collapsed eggs and are therefore sterile. <b>Site-specific</b> mitotic <b>recombination</b> events induced in females heterozygous for decDN and a mutation on the homologous chromosome arm result in homozygous mutant follicle cells that have lost decDN. Therefore, egg chambers with the entire follicular epithelium homozygous mutant generate intact eggs that can be unambiguously identified amongst otherwise collapsed eggs...|$|R
40|$|The shufflon, a {{multiple}} DNA inversion {{system in the}} plasmid R 64, consists of four DNA segments flanked and separated by seven 19 -bp repeat sequences. <b>Site-specific</b> <b>recombinations</b> mediated by the rci product occur between each inverted repeat sequence, resulting in inversions of the four segments independently or in groups. The seven 19 -bp repeat sequences are classified into four types (repeat-a, -b, -c, and -d), according to their 3 -bp variable sequences. We individually cloned A, B, and C segments of the R 64 shufflon and determined the in vivo inversion frequency of each segment. The inversion frequencies of three segments differed greatly. The inversion frequency declined in the following order: segments A, B, and C. Synthetic 19 -mer oligonucleotides corresponding to both strands of repeat-a, -b, -c, and -d sequences were inserted into appropriate sites of pBR 322. The rci-mediated DNA inversion occurred between two synthetic inverted repeats, indicating that the 19 -bp inverted repeat sequences are the sole elements required in cis for the shufflon system. The inversion frequencies of DNA segments flanked by various sequences indicate that the four types of repeat sequences determine the inversion frequency of the four DNA segments of the R 64 shufflon.

Every base substitution was performed on each of the thirteen nucleotides within the FRT site (example G to A, T, and C). First, the authors showed that most mutations within the FRT sequence cause minimal effects if present within only one of the two sites. If mutations occurred within both sites, the efficiency of FLP is dramatically reduced. Second, the authors provided data for which nucleotides are most crucial for the binding of FLP and efficacy of the <b>site-specific</b> <b>recombination.</b> If the first nucleotide in both FRT sites is substituted to a cytosine (G to C), the third nucleotide is substituted for a thymine (A to T), or the seventh nucleotide is substituted for an adenosine (G to A), then {{the efficacy of the}} FLP-mediated <b>site-specific</b> <b>recombination</b> is reduced more than 100-fold.

50|$|<b>Site-specific</b> <b>recombination</b> {{is also an}} {{important}} process that viruses, such as bacteriophages, adopt to integrate their genetic material into the infected host. The virus, called a prophage in such a state, accomplishes this via integration and excision. The points where the integration and excision reactions occur are called the attachment (att) sites. An attP site on the phage exchanges segments with an attB site on the bacterial DNA. Thus, these are site-specific, occurring only at the respective att sites. The integrase class of enzymes catalyse this particular reaction.|$|E

To understand their in vivo significance, we used Mycoplasma agalactiae as a model exhibiting high-frequency variations {{of a family of}} immunodominant Vpma lipoproteins via Xer 1 -mediated <b>site-specific</b> <b>recombinations.</b> Phase-Locked Mutants (PLMs) expressing single stable Vpma products served as first breakthrough tools in mycoplasmology to study the role of such sophisticated antigenic variation systems. Comparing the general clinical features of sheep infected with a mixture of phase-invariable PLMs (PLMU and PLMY) and the wild type strain, it was earlier concluded that Vpma phase variation is not necessary for infection. Conversely, the current study demonstrates the in vivo indispensability of Vpma switching as inferred from the Vpma phenotypic and genotypic analyses of reisolates obtained during sheep infection and necropsy. PLMY and PLMU stably expressing VpmaY and VpmaU, respectively, for numerous in vitro generations, switched to new Vpma phenotypes inside the sheep. Molecular genetic analysis of selected 'switchover' clones confirmed xer 1 disruption and revealed complex new rearrangements like chimeras, deletions and duplications in the vpma loci that were previously unknown in type strain PG 2. Another novel finding is the differential infection potential of Vpma variants, as local infection sites demonstrated an almost complete dominance of PLMY over PLMU especially during early stages of both conjunctival and intramammary co-challenge infections, indicating a comparatively better in vivo fitness of VpmaY expressors. The data suggest that Vpma antigenic variation is imperative for survival and persistence inside the immunocompetent host, and although Xer 1 is necessary for causing Vpma variation in vitro, it is not a virulence factor because alternative Xer 1 -independent mechanisms operate in vivo, likely under the selection pressure of the host-induced immune response. This singular study highlights exciting new aspects of mycoplasma antigenic variation systems, including the regulation of expression by host factors...|$|R
