A demo was then {{released}} on November 8, 2007 on the PlayStation Network before its final release on November 19 in North America, December 6 in Australia, and December 7 in Europe. The demo was first placed on the North American store, and was initially region-locked such that it would only play on a North American PS3. However, this was later confirmed as a mistake, as the developers were apparently unaware that people from different regions could <b>sign</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> North American account and download the demo; a region-free demo was released soon after.|$|E

25|$|Initially {{there was}} {{considerable}} support for Australia's involvement in Vietnam, and all Australian battalions returning from Vietnam participated in well attended welcome home parades through either Sydney, Adelaide, Brisbane or Townsville, even during the early 1970s. Regardless, as {{opposition to the war}} increased service in Vietnam came to be seen by sections of the Australian community in less than sympathetic terms and opposition to it generated negative views of veterans in some quarters. In the years following the war, some Vietnam veterans experienced social exclusion and problems readjusting to society. Nevertheless, as the tour of duty of each soldier during the Vietnam War was limited to one year (although some soldiers chose to <b>sign</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> second or even a third tour of duty), the number of soldiers suffering from combat stress was probably more limited than it might otherwise have been.|$|E

25|$|Alternatively, {{consumers}} {{wishing to}} obtain their credit scores can {{in some cases}} purchase them separately from the credit bureaus or can purchase their FICO score directly from FICO. Credit scores (including FICO scores) are also made available free by subscription {{to one of the}} many credit report monitoring services available from the credit bureaus or other third parties, although to actually get the scores free from most such services, one must use a credit card to <b>sign</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> free trial subscription of the service and then cancel before the first monthly charge. Websites like WalletHub, Credit Sesame and Credit Karma provide free credit scores with no credit card required, using the TransUnion VantageScore 3.0 model.

500|$|According to the {{historian}} Roland Huntford, Borchgrevink {{was of a}} restless nature, {{with a passion for}} adventure which took him, after his forestry training, to Australia. For four years he worked with government surveying teams in Queensland and New South Wales before settling {{in the small town of}} Bowenfels, where he became a teacher in languages and natural sciences at Cooerwull Academy. [...] His initial interest in polar exploration developed from reading press reports about the work of local scientists on the first Australian Antarctic Exploration Committee. This organisation, founded in 1886, was investigating the possibility of establishing [...] permanent scientific research stations in the Antarctic regions. These plans were not realised; it was a revival of interest in commercial whaling in the early 1890s that gave Borchgrevink the opportunity, in 1894, to <b>sign</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Norwegian expedition to Antarctica.|$|E

James wrote that the [...] "announcing team was perfect tonight, no bickering, no fake feuds, no 'storytelling' for things outside the ring", especially [...] "in the opening match, where it was clear that they were completely invested in the match". He also wrote that Cesaro-Zayn was [...] "match of the year by a country mile", describing it as [...] "better, more emotionally intense, and more exciting than anything WWE has put on since their previous encounter". [...] "Some of the sequences in here had 5+ counters strung together" [...] and there was [...] "hard hitting action".|$|E
500|$|Following the player's {{departure}} from Midgar, Cloud is appointed group leader {{by the other}} members of the party, upsetting Barret. Shortly thereafter, Cloud narrates his history with Sephiroth, a legendary member of SOLDIER and the game's primary antagonist, and the events that led to Sephiroth's disappearance five years prior. According to Cloud, the two were [...] "war buddies". Joining SOLDIER to emulate Sephiroth, Cloud explains that he would <b>sign</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> [...] "big mission" [...] whenever they became available, as the conclusion of Shinra's war with the people of Wutai ended his chances for military fame. Cloud explains that Sephiroth started questioning his humanity after accompanying him on a job to Cloud's hometown of Nibelheim, which suffered from a malfunctioning Mako reactor responsible for producing monsters. Discovering documents concerning Jenova, an extraterrestrial lifeform and Sephiroth's [...] "mother", Sephiroth mistakes himself for a Cetra and blames their downfall on humans. Razing Nibelheim, Sephiroth leaves for the Mt. Nibel Mako reactor, and Cloud gives chase. There, Cloud finds Tifa gravely wounded by Sephiroth outside the chamber where Jenova is stored. Cloud says that he then confronted Sephiroth, but that he is unable to remember or explain how he survived the encounter given Sephiroth's strength.|$|E

[...] Specifically, they think that default choices for programs should not have been random, and that beneficiaries of the program were not given adequate resources to deal with the number of choices they were faced with. [...] They think that seniors who did not <b>sign</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> program should have one assigned to them, and that, yearly, they should be mailed an itemized list of all drugs they had used and all of the fees they incurred.

2500|$|Torsten Billman was 17 {{years old}} when he in Stockholm, 1926, signed on SS Valencia; a cargo-boat plying the Mediterranean. He first worked as a deckhand; too young to <b>sign</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> job in the engine {{department}} (under 18 years old). In 1927 he became a coal trimmer. His artistic awakening was on SS Nippon, in 1928, a bigger long-distance runner plying the Far East. With white school chalk he drew caricatures of his fellow seamen and officers on the soot-blackened walls and bulkheads of the stokehole. Drawings that evoked encouragement from the men in the forecastle and also from the officers. [...] "That ship put my slumbering pictoral talent in motion. I documented and I stored images - this I understood afterwards", Billman recalls. After the next ship SS Nordic, early in 1929, he told his sister, Ingegerd, that he wanted to become an artist. He worked on five different merchant ships 1926-1929 and 1932 as a deckhand (1926â€“27), coal trimmer and stoker.|$|E
