5000|$|The {{camera shutter}} must be {{controlled}} by a remote cord or by using the timer mode. The simple action of depressing the <b>shutter</b> <b>control</b> will cause the camera to vibrate, losing focus of the subject matter.|$|E
50|$|Use of APEX {{required}} logarithmic {{markings on}} aperture and <b>shutter</b> <b>controls,</b> however, and these never were incorporated in consumer cameras.

50|$|The {{size of the}} {{aperture}} and {{the brightness of the}} scene controls the amount of light that enters the camera during a period of time, and the <b>shutter</b> <b>controls</b> the length of time that the light hits the recording surface. Equivalent exposures can be made using a large aperture size with a fast shutter speed and a small aperture with a slow shutter.|$|R
50|$|At {{the same}} time, {{a variant of}} the SL35M, the SL35ME was also released. Built on the same body, the SL35ME had {{electronic}} <b>shutter</b> <b>control</b> inside, and could set shutter speeds automatically. The viewfinder also came with a whole range of indicators, including aperture, shutter speed amongst others.|$|E
50|$|Aperture {{priority}} mode (commonly abbreviated to Av) gives the photographer manual {{control of the}} aperture, whilst the camera automatically adjusts the shutter speed to achieve the exposure specified by the TTL meter. Shutter {{priority mode}} (commonly abbreviated to TV) gives manual <b>shutter</b> <b>control,</b> with automatic aperture compensation. In each case, the actual exposure level is still determined by the camera's exposure meter.|$|E

The VOA consists of an opaque, undiluted ferrofluid plug actuator inside a microfluidic channel. The ferrofluid plug position is translated by a variable magnetic field generated from a miniature electromagnet. The ferrofluid plug actuator in turn displaces a second oil-diluted ferrofluid plug acting as an optical shutter.

For instance, most Windows phones and tablets have both front- and rear-facing cameras, so Camera’s switch button toggles between the two options.|$|R

Using old VistaVision cameras (for their high image resolution), created by engineers at Paramount Pictures in 1954, and hand wire wrapped TTL chips, the all-digitally controlled system allowed for 7 axes of motion: roll, pan, tilt, swing, boom, traverse, track, lens focus, motor drive, <b>shutter</b> <b>control,</b> and their duplication in multiple takes.|$|E

50|$|A {{parallel}} {{development to}} faster speed FP shutters was electronic <b>shutter</b> <b>control</b> {{as part of}} the general trend of electronic governance of all camera systems. In 1966, the VEB Pentacon Praktica electronic (East Germany) was the first SLR with an electronically controlled FP shutter. It used electronic circuitry to time its shutter instead of the traditional spring/gear/lever clockwork mechanisms. In 1971, the Asahi Pentax Electro Spotmatic (Japan; name shortened to Asahi Pentax ES in 1972; called Honeywell Pentax ES in USA) tied its electronically controlled shutter to its exposure control light meter to provide electronic aperture-priority autoexposure.|$|E

It is called ‘Voice Shutter’. Two types of voice shutter, which are open type and closed type, are proposed in this paper. A closed type voice <b>shutter</b> <b>controlled</b> by a feed forward method was manufactured and tested.

50|$|The cloth {{focal-plane shutter}} {{provides}} speeds from 1/30 to 1/1000 sec. and B. The {{shutter release button}} is situated on the right-hand camera front externally threaded for Leica cable release. The <b>shutter</b> <b>control</b> is the small milled knob on the top with numerals from 30 to 1000 and B engraved around it. It serves dual purposes, for winding the shutter in a single anti-clockwise motion until a catch arrests it, and thence as a lift and turn type shutter speed selector. A standard coaxial flash synchronising socket is situated {{at the front of}} the camera, below the shutter release button.|$|E

50|$|Because of {{the limited}} radius of {{available}} space around the fully insertable lens, {{the use of the}} normal central shutter was impossible. Therefore, Waaske proposed a new type of shutter, which was separated into two functional parts. The <b>shutter</b> <b>controlling</b> clockworks were mounted unmovable in the camera body, while the shutter lamellas were mounted in the movable sliding tube. The separate parts were mechanically coupled by shafts. Only when the shutter was cocked and therefore the lamellas were uncoupled, the sliding tube could be inserted into the housing.|$|R

50|$|Without its own {{development}} department, the Singapore {{production facility}} asked Rollei Germany {{for permission to}} make a redesign of the Rollei 35 B. The uncoupled selenium light meter {{was replaced by a}} new electronically coupled light meter, using variable resistors for transferring the aperture and <b>shutter</b> <b>control</b> settings to the light meter. The new designation Rollei 35 LED resulted from the three light emitting diodes in the viewfinder, which indicated overexposure, correct exposure, or underexposure. In October 1977 the first datasheet appeared and in January 1978 preproduction started. But the first models suffered from clumsy design of the power switch, which activated the light meter permanently. If the user forgot to switch the camera off, the battery was drained in just 15 hours. Furthermore, the PX-27 battery could be inserted the wrong way, causing damaged electronics. From August 1978 onward an improved model was made, where the light meter was only activated when the release button was depressed slightly.|$|E

40|$|A novel reset/read-out {{technique}} is presented for current-mode ultra-low power Megapixels CMOS imagers. In the proposed technique, the reset and readout phases occur simultaneously: {{as a single}} pixel is being read-out another pixel is being reset.

Furthermore, power consumption becomes independent of both read-out speed and imager array size, while still allowing for on read-out FPN correction along with external electronic <b>shutter</b> <b>control.</b> Its potential integration into CMOS imagers, is demonstrated through the full custom design of a programmable 32 x 32 current-mode CMOS imager in AMIS CMOS 0. 35 mum technology...|$|E
30|$|As an {{alternative}} to a PID control, we propose a new control type {{that is based on}} recursive control. This control type is very suitable and native for the control of the exposure time of the sensor (<b>shutter</b> <b>control)</b> and gain (gain control). The advantage of the recursive control is its simplicity and ease of use. Namely, for a PID type of control, three parameters have to be determined and optimized. Although some guidelines exist for tuning the control loop, numerous experiments have to be performed. However, for each particular system to be controlled, different strategies are applicable, depending on the underlying physical properties. This discussion {{is beyond the scope of}} this paper; we recommend [6, 10] for more information.|$|E

This report describes a prototype implementation of an advanced remote control that uses bidirectional digital communication over USB to access and change common settings. The prototype is developed to support Canon DSLRs, and is tested with an EOS 5 D mark II camera. Hardware and software have been developed; the hardware is based on a template design.

50|$|The {{earliest}} Leica prototypes {{were developed}} by the company Ernst Leitz during {{the first years of}} the 20th century, but marketing did not commence until the mid 1920s. The Leicas were innovative, by orienting the image frame sideways for the 35 mm film as opposed to the cine-camera tradition of across the film-strip. The cameras were compact with collapsible lenses, for hiking and biking. The rangefinder feature was added with the Leica II during 1932, and that year both rangefinder and viewfinder cameras became available with interchangeable lenses. In 1933 the Leica III offered slow-speed <b>shutter</b> <b>controls</b> and a fast 1/1000th shutter speed, and various iterations of the III (a,b,c,d,f,&g) series became the flagship models and best sellers into the late 1950s. Further iterations of the models I and II were offered, but did not sell well.|$|R
