25|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} of the knapsack problem that have arisen from the vast number of applications of the basic problem.

25|$|While {{there had}} been many shipwrecks and {{groundings}} over the years, {{and it was the}} rare vessel that did not run aground or have <b>some</b> <b>problem</b> of this nature, two shipwrecks would have been foremost in the minds of Captain Locke and his officers, as well as other senior captains and officers among the rescue vessels, like Captains Ledbetter of Cedar and Miller of the King and Winge. These two wrecks, of Clallam in 1904 and Princess May in 1910, showed well the dilemma faced by Captain Locke in making a decision whether to evacuate Princess Sophia.|$|E

25|$|Edward IV died {{suddenly}} in 1483 and was succeeded by his twelve-year-old son Edward V. In the turbulent times {{it became known}} that there was <b>some</b> <b>problem</b> with the legality of Edward IV's marriage, and rather than let Edward be king with a regency, Parliament deposed him and appointed Edward IV's brother Richard, Duke of Gloucester as King Richard III. Edward {{and his younger brother}} Richard, Duke of York, were taken to the Tower of London, and the Princes in the Tower were never seen again. Who was responsible for their ultimate fate remains a topic of heated discussion to this day. There is evidence that some coins were struck for King Edward V, but it is uncertain that any have survived.|$|E
25|$|Frequency {{analysis}} {{requires only}} {{a basic understanding}} of the statistics of the plaintext language and <b>some</b> <b>problem</b> solving skills, and, if performed by hand, tolerance for extensive letter bookkeeping. During World War II (WWII), both the British and the Americans recruited codebreakers by placing crossword puzzles in major newspapers and running contests for who could solve them the fastest. Several of the ciphers used by the Axis powers were breakable using frequency analysis, for example, some of the consular ciphers used by the Japanese. Mechanical methods of letter counting and statistical analysis (generally IBM card type machinery) were first used in World War II, possibly by the US Army's SIS. Today, the hard work of letter counting and analysis has been replaced by computer software, which can carry out such analysis in seconds. With modern computing power, classical ciphers are unlikely to provide any real protection for confidential data.|$|E
500|$|Some {{have been}} linked to his caustic {{criticism}} of George W. Bush's administration. [...] For instance, his frustration over the slow federal response to Hurricane Katrina led him to compare, at a Congressional Black Caucus town meeting in September 2005, Bush to Bull Connor, a 1960s symbol of white opposition to the civil rights movement, stating: [...] "George Bush is our Bull Connor." [...] He said a few days later that both figures had become focal points for American blacks to rally against. His first remark led to a public exchange with Vice President Dick Cheney, who said, [...] "I'm frankly surprised at his comments. It almost struck me — they were so out of line, it almost struck me that there was some — Charlie was having <b>some</b> <b>problem.</b> Charlie is losing it, I guess." [...] Rangel responded by saying, [...] "The fact that he would make a crack at my age, he ought to be ashamed of himself ... He should look so good at seventy-five." ...|$|E

2500|$|Logic {{programming}} {{is a type}} of programming paradigm which is largely based on formal logic. Any program written in a logic programming language is a set of sentences in logical form, expressing facts and rules about <b>some</b> <b>problem</b> domain. [...] Major logic programming language families include Prolog, Answer set programming (ASP) and Datalog. In all of these languages, rules are written in the form of clauses: ...|$|E
2500|$|Donald Knuth, {{who said}} of Edsger Dijkstra that [...] "to think of {{programming}} in C++" [...] "would make him physically ill", corroborates Thompson: [...] The problem that I have with them today is that... C++ is too complicated. At the moment, it's {{impossible for me}} to write portable code that I believe would work on lots of different systems, unless I avoid all exotic features. Whenever the C++ language designers had two competing ideas as to how they should solve <b>some</b> <b>problem,</b> they said [...] "OK, we'll do them both". So the language is too baroque for my taste.|$|E

2500|$|It can be {{said that}} an adjoint functor is a way of giving the most {{efficient}} solution to <b>some</b> <b>problem</b> via a method which is formulaic. [...] For example, an elementary problem in ring theory is how to turn a rng (which is like a ring that might not have a multiplicative identity) into a ring. [...] The most efficient way is to adjoin an element '1' to the rng, adjoin all (and only) the elements which are necessary for satisfying the ring axioms (e.g. r+1 for each r in the ring), and impose no relations in the newly formed ring that are not forced by axioms. [...] Moreover, this construction is formulaic {{in the sense that it}} works in essentially the same way for any rng.|$|E
2500|$|Although quantum {{computers}} may {{be faster}} than classical computers for <b>some</b> <b>problem</b> types, those described above can't solve any problem that classical computers can't already solve. A Turing machine can simulate these quantum computers, so such a quantum computer could never solve an undecidable problem like the halting problem. The existence of [...] "standard" [...] quantum computers does not disprove the Church–Turing thesis. It {{has been speculated}} that theories of quantum gravity, such as M-theory or loop quantum gravity, may allow even faster computers to be built. Currently, defining computation in such theories is an open problem due {{to the problem of}} time, i.e., there currently exists no obvious way to describe what it means for an observer to submit input to a computer and later receive output.|$|E

Finally he lit his pipe, and sitting in the inglenook of the old village inn he talked slowly and at random about his case, rather as one who thinks aloud than as one who makes a considered statement.|$|E
