5|$|The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man was {{primarily}} developed by Universal Creative, {{the research and}} development division of Universal Parks & Resorts. Scott Trowbridge, who now works for Walt Disney Imagineering, was the ride's producer. Thierry Coup, who has since worked on Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey and , was the Director and production designer. Trowbridge and Coup helped develop the initial storyboards for the attraction. They travelled to Massachusetts several times to meet with the animation directors, Jeff Kleiser and Diana Walczak, and their team at Kleiser-Walczak Construction Co. (now Synthespian Studios) who provided all the stereoscopic animation and custom software for squinching. Coup produced the film alongside Patrick Mooney and Mark Rhodes.

500|$|... "Phineas and Ferb's Quantum Boogaloo," [...] {{written by}} <b>Scott</b> <b>Peterson</b> and {{directed}} by Zac Moncrief, was rated TV-G in the United States.

[...] Dan Povenmire and Jeff [...] "Swampy" [...] Marsh, co-creators of Phineas and Ferb, centralized plot elements to satirize time travel films, such as The Time Machine (1960) and the Back to the Future trilogy (1985-1990). Multiple scenes in the episode were meant to be rather confusing and difficult to understand in order to interest viewers so they would watch the episode multiple times, trying to learn something new each time.|$|E

50|$|The genome of M. genitalium {{consists}} of 525 genes in one circular DNA of 580,070 base pairs. <b>Scott</b> N. <b>Peterson</b> {{and his team}} at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill reported the first genetic map using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis in 1991. They performed an initial study of the genome using random sequencing in 1993, by which they found 100,993 nucleotides and 390 protein-coding genes. Collaborating with researchers at the Institute for Genomic Research, which included Craig Venter, they made the complete genome sequence in 1995 using shotgun sequencing. Only 470 predicted coding regions (out of 482 protein encoding genes) were identified, including genes required for DNA replication, transcription and translation, DNA repair, cellular transport, and energy metabolism. It was the second complete bacterial genome ever sequenced, after Haemophilus influenzae. In 2006, the team at the J. Craig Venter Institute reported that only 382 genes are essential for biological functions. The small genome of M. genitalium made it the organism of choice in The Minimal Genome Project, a study to find the smallest set of genetic material necessary to sustain life.|$|R

Across town, a lawyer named <b>Scott</b> (Seth <b>Peterson)</b> is hiking in the woods with his partner Eddie (Matt Williamson) and their two young sons. Eddie brought the workaholic Scott to Sedona for some rest and relaxation, but wind up in an unexpected adventure when 7-year-old Denny (Trevor Sterling Stovall) gets lost. The ensuing frantic search for Denny sends Scott into a profound life-changing journey that forces him to examine his own priorities and determine what's truly important in his life. Meanwhile, Tammy unwittingly begins a spiritual transformation of her own as she encounters an array of the townspeople, each of them touching her in different meaningful ways. A chain of coincidences spirals her out of control, leaving her haunted by her past and forcing her to face her demons head on. Letting her guard down, she confronts the implausible possibility that she has been brought to Sedona for a reason.|$|R

40|$|Current {{international}} relations theory struggles to explain both the autonomy and transformation of international organizations (IOs). Previous theories either fail {{to account for}} any IO behavior that deviates from the interests of member states, or neglect the {{role of member states}} in reforming IO institutions and behavior. We propose an agency theory of IOs that can fill these gaps while also addressing two persistent problems in the study of IOs: common agency and long delegation chains. Our model explains slippage between member states interests and IO behavior, but also suggests institutional mechanisms staff selection, monitoring, procedural checks, and contracts through which states can rein in errant IOs. We evaluate this argument by examining multiple institutional reforms and lending patterns at the World Bank from 1980 to 2000.
