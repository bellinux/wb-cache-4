500|$|Whitlam {{arrived just}} before 1:00p.m. {{and was taken}} to Kerr's office by an aide. He brought with him the formal letter advising a half-Senate election, and after {{the two men were}} seated, {{attempted}} to give it to Kerr. In their accounts of their meeting, both men agree that Kerr then told Whitlam that his commission as Prime Minister was withdrawn under Section64 of the Constitution, and handed him a letter and <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>reasons.</b> Kerr later wrote that at this point Whitlam got to his feet, looked at the office's phones, and stated, [...] "I must {{get in touch with the}} Palace at once." [...] Whitlam, however disputed this, and stated that he asked Kerr whether he had consulted the Palace, to which Kerr replied that he did not need to, and that he had the advice of Barwick. Both accounts agree that Kerr then stated that they would both have to live with this, to which Whitlam replied, [...] "You certainly will." [...] The dismissal concluded with Kerr wishing Whitlam luck in the election, and offering his hand, which the former Prime Minister took.|$|E
2500|$|Several years later, after Rodriguez de Quijas had {{expanded}} securities arbitration even further, Lynn Katzler, a Washington College of Law student, disagreed. [...] "For {{the sake of}} fairness and investor protection, the SEC should have required written opinions," [...] she wrote. [...] "It should not have delegated the responsibility to the good sense of arbitrators." [...] She addressed many of the opposing arguments, {{and concluded that the}} benefits of requiring a written opinion from arbitrators more than offset the costs, and would be in accord with the Court's decisions. [...] " [...] <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>reasons</b> would effectuate Congress' intent behind the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, while recognizing the Federal Arbitration Act's special policy favoring arbitration." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{decision}} of the Privy Council has been criticised in Australia {{on the basis that}} the constitutional question was one upon which the {{decision of}} the High Court should have been final and that the Privy Council should have respected the spirit of the Constitution and avoided conflict with the High Court. In 1957 a proponent for abolishing appeals to the Privy Council described it as an egregious blunder, stating [...] "Even the most fervent admirer of the erudition (sic) of the Judicial Committee, even the most ardent believer in the strength of this 'bond of empire', is hardly likely to be impressed by the judgment delivered by Lord Halsbury {{in the name of the}} Committee. Halsbury's name is associated with a number of judgments of dubious value; but if he were responsible for preparing as well as pronouncing the <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>reasons</b> in Webb v Outtrim, it can only be said that on this occasion even Halsbury surpassed himself in the puerility of some of his reasons and in his fantastic ignorance of the working of a federation under the Crown".|$|E

6000|$|The {{collection}} is enriched by a letter dated [...] "Cambridge, August 26, 1775" [...] from Washington himself. He wrote {{it in that}} house,--now so venerable with his memory,--in that very room, where his bust now stands upon a poet's table; from this sheet of paper passed the hand that held the leading-staff! Nothing can be more perfectly in keeping with all other manifestations of Washington than the whole visible aspect and embodiment of this letter. The manuscript is as clear as daylight; the punctuation exact, to a comma. There is a calm accuracy throughout, which seems {{the production of a}} species of intelligence that cannot err, and which, if we may so speak, would affect us with a more human warmth, if we could conceive it capable of some slight human error. The chirography is characterized by a plain and easy grace, which, in the signature, is somewhat elaborated, and becomes a type of the personal manner of a gentleman of the old school, but without detriment to the truth and clearness that distinguish the rest of the manuscript. The lines are as straight and equidistant as if ruled; and from beginning to end, there is no physical symptom--as how should there be?--of a varying mood, of jets of emotion, or any of those fluctuating feelings that pass from the hearts into the fingers of common men. The paper itself (like most of those Revolutionary letters, which are written on fabrics fit to endure the burden of ponderous and earnest thought) is stout, and of excellent quality, and bears the water-mark of Britannia, surmounted by the Crown. The subject of the letter is a <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>reasons</b> for not taking possession of Point Alderton; a position commanding the entrance of Boston Harbor. After explaining the difficulties of the case, arising from his want of men and munitions for the adequate defence of the lines which he already occupies, Washington proceeds: [...] "To you, sir, who are a well-wisher to the cause, and can reason upon the effects of such conduct, I may open myself with freedom, because no improper disclosures will be made of our situation. But I cannot expose my weakness to the enemy (though I believe they are pretty well informed of everything that passes), by telling this and that man, who are daily pointing out this, and that, and t' other place, of all the motives that govern my actions; notwithstanding I know what will be the consequence of not doing it,--namely, that I shall be accused of inattention to the public service, and perhaps of want of spirit to prosecute it. But this shall have no effect upon my conduct. I will steadily (as far as my judgment will assist me) pursue such measures as I think conducive to the interest of the cause, and rest satisfied under any obloquy that shall be thrown, conscious of having discharged my duty {{to the best of my}} abilities." ...|$|E

However, he communicated with the staff at his detention facility, which convinced the examiner that Asahara was maintaining his silence out of free will. Because his lawyers never submitted the <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>reason</b> for appeal, the Tokyo High Court decided on March 27, 2006 not to grant them leave to appeal. This decision was upheld by the Supreme Court of Japan on September 15, 2006. Two re-trial appeals were declined by the appellate court.|$|R
