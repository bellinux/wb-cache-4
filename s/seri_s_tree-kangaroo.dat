50|$|In December 2003, Minister of Works, Datuk <b>Seri</b> <b>S</b> Samy Vellu {{directed}} {{the implementation of}} a single ETC nationwide as a form of standardisation and convenience of use for road users. The directive requires all major toll operators in Malaysia to have a minimum of 2 Touch 'n Go and 1 SmartTAG lanes per direction at every plazas. The directive was gradually implemented by all major toll operators on 1 July 2004 and marked the cessation of other types of non-stop ETCs in Malaysia.|$|R
25|$|This made Datuk <b>Seri</b> <b>S.</b> Samy Vellu, who {{was then}} MIC vice-{{president}}, bitter as {{he felt he was}} being sidelined. Samy Vellu was one of the five leaders who dared defy former president Tun V.T. Sambanthan and propel Manickavasagam to the presidency of the party.Subramaniam, then the secretary general of MIC, was hand-picked by Manickavasagam to become deputy president and succeed him. However, Samy Vellu fought back, literally, and in the 1977 party elections he managed to beat Subramaniam by a mere 26 votes to become the Deputy President of MIC.|$|R

50|$|The {{construction}} of the 63.4 km (39.3 mi) controlled-access expressway from Kuala Lumpur to Seremban began on 27 March 1974 {{as one of the}} Second Malaysia Plan (RMK-2) project, with the total cost of RM32.9 million. It consists of 14 interchanges, 2 laybys and 6 toll plaza (Sungai Besi, UPM, Kajang, Bangi, Nilai and Seremban). Funded by a loan by the World Bank, the expressway was constructed in three phases; the first phase was from Kuala Lumpur to Nilai, while the second phase was from Nilai to Seremban. The third phase was the rehabilitation of the old Federal Route 1 from Kuala Lumpur to Seremban as a toll-free alternative to motorists. The expressway was opened to motorists on 16 June 1982, where the Minister of Works at that time, Datuk <b>Seri</b> <b>S.</b> Samy Vellu himself became the first motorist to pay the toll of the expressway.

5000|$|MIC {{president}} Datuk <b>Seri</b> Dr <b>S.</b> Subramaniam {{has come}} up with the national blueprint for the Indian community, initiated by the Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak. It’s a genuine commitment by Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak to help the Indian community. The brainchild of Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak, was the first action plan for Indians covering basic needs such as education, entrepreneurship, housing, employment, documentation, trade and social development. The implementation of this plan is under the 11th Malaysia Plan in which the government gives priority to the Malaysian Indian community, and provides various programmes to cater to their needs. Datuk <b>Seri</b> Dr <b>S.</b> Subramaniam has the idea of this as it was a new initiative to start implementing development plans for the Indian community, especially a new perspective and scope for houses of worship as an effort to bring about transformation to the Indian community.Blueprint focus on four aspects to improve the living standards of the community of Indians. The blueprint especially address the problems of  40 per cent of households (B-40 category) in the next 10 years from now (2017). Those are to identify the basic problems, realizing the potential of every child, improving livelihood and wealth, and social issues. YB Datuk Seri also create a special unit known as the Unit for the Socio-Economic Development of the Indian Community, under the Prime Minister’s Department, where it is solely responsible for monitoring and implementing the plan. The special unit will be staffed by civil servants as executors to record the success of the main essence of the plan every year. Another initiative of Datuk <b>Seri</b> Dr <b>S.</b> Subramaniam and Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak is to set up a fund with an allocation of RM500 million to assist small entrepreneurs and improve their economic status as well as identify and register the B40 group for programmes that are suitable for them.Blueprint seeks to engender the following outcomes for the Malaysian Indian community: ...|$|R

SourceEpilepsy, Neurophysiology and Neurogenetic Unit, Institute of Child Neurology and Psychiatry, IRCCS Stella Maris Foundation, Calambrone, Pisa, Italy. Abstract PURPOSE: SCN 1 A {{is the most}} clinically relevant epilepsy gene, most mutations lead to severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (SMEI) and generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+). We studied 132 patients with epilepsy syndromes with seizures precipitated by fever, and performed phenotype-genotype correlations with SCN 1 A alterations. METHODS: We included patients with SMEI including borderline SMEI (SMEB), GEFS+, febrile seizures (FS), or other seizure types precipitated by fever. We performed a clinical and genetic study focusing on SCN 1 A, using dHPLC, gene sequencing, and MLPA to detect genomic deletions/duplications on SMEI/SMEB patients. RESULTS: We classified patients as: SMEI/SMEB = 55; GEFS+= 26; and other phenotypes = 51. SCN 1 A analysis by dHPLC/sequencing revealed 40 mutations in 37 SMEI/SMEB (67 %) and 3 GEFS+ (11. 5 %) probands. MLPA showed genomic deletions in 2 of 18 SMEI/SMEB. Most mutations were de novo (82 %). SMEB patients carrying mutations (8) {{were more likely to}} have missense mutations (62. 5 %), conversely SMEI patients (31) had more truncating, splice site or genomic alterations (64. 5 %). SMEI/SMEB with truncating, splice site or genomic alterations had a significantly earlier age of onset of FS compared to those with missense mutations and without mutations (p = 0. 00007, ANOVA test). None of the remaining patients with seizures precipitated by fever carried SCN 1 A mutations. CONCLUSION: We obtained a frequency of 71 %SCN 1 A abnormalities in SMEI/SMEB and of 11. 5 % in GEFS+ probands. MLPA complements DNA sequencing of SCN 1 A increasing the mutation detection rate. SMEI/SMEB with truncating, splice site or genomic alterations had a significantly earlier age of onset of FS. This study confirms the high sensitivity of SCN 1 A for SMEI/SMEB phenotypes...|$|R
