500|$|FairTax opponents {{state that}} {{compliance}} decreases when taxes are not automatically withheld from citizens, and that massive tax evasion could result by collecting at just {{one point in}} the economic system. Compliance rates can also fall when taxed entities, rather than a third party, self-report their tax liability. For example, ordinary personal income taxes can be automatically withheld and are reported to the government by a third party. Taxes without withholding and with self-reporting, such as the FairTax, can see higher evasion rates. [...] Economist Jane Gravelle of the Congressional Research Service found studies showing that evasion rates of sales taxes are often above 10%, even when the sales tax rate is in the single digits. [...] Tax publications by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), IMF, and Brookings Institution have suggested that the upper limit for a sales tax is about 10% before incentives for evasion become too great to control. According to the GAO, 80% of state tax officials opposed a national sales tax as an intrusion on their tax base. Opponents also raise concerns of legal tax avoidance by spending and consuming outside of the U.S. (imported goods would be <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>collection</b> by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection).|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE-Assessment and {{follow-up}} of early renal dysfunction {{is important in}} diabetic nephropathy.

We aimed to assess the reproducibility, reliability, and accuracy of plasma cystatin C {{as a measure of}} GFR ranging from normal to moderate impairment due to type 1 diabetes {{in the presence of a}} normal plasma creatinine concentration. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS-A sensitive immunoturbidimetric cystatin C assay was examined in 29 subjects with type 1 diabetes and 11 nondiabetic subjects. Duplicate measurements of the following were collected from each subject, 2 weeks apart: cystatin C, enzymatic plasma creatinine, 24 -h creatinine clearance, GFR estimated from plasma creatinine by the Cockcroft-Gault equation, and iohexol clearance as a gold standard. RESULTS-Iohexol clearance ranged from 35 to 132 ml. min(- 1). 1. 73 m(- 2). Plasma cystatin C compared well with the other clinically used tests. The reliability of cystatin C, as assessed by the discriminant ratio, was superior to creatinine clearance (3. 4 vs. 1. 5, P < 0. 001) and the correlation of cystatin C with iohexol clearance (Rs - 0. 80) was similar to that of creatinine clearance (Rs - 0. 74) and superior to that of plasma creatinine and the Cockcroft-Gault estimate (Rs - 0. 54 and 0. 66, respectively). Duplicate estimations were used to provide an unbiased equation to convert plasma cystatin C to GFR. CONCLUSIONS-Based on this study, cystatin C is a more reliable measure of GFR than creatinine clearance, is more highly correlated with iohexol clearance than plasma creatinine, and is worthy of further investigation as a clinical measure of GFR in type 1 diabetes...|$|E

40|$|Winter {{ice cover}} of the Arctic Ocean makes year-round {{zooplankton}} sampling by plankton net a difficult task. Therefore, the collection of copepods with a sediment trap {{can be a powerful}} tool. In the present study, we analysed the seasonal changes in the population structures of five dominant planktonic copepods (Oncaea parila, Calanus hyperboreus, Metridia longa, Paraeuchaeta glacialis and Heterorhabdus norvegicus), which were collected using a sediment trap rotated at 10 - 15 day intervals moored at 184 - 260 m in the Northwind Abyssal Plain (75 degrees 00 N, 162 degrees 00 W) of the western Arctic Ocean from October 2010 to September 2012. Oncaea parila C 6 F with egg sacs occurred throughout the year, and the total abundance and composition of early copepodid stages (C 1 -C 3) had two peaks each year. Calanus hyperboreus was dominated by C 6 F throughout the year, and their maturation was observed during February to May. Metridia longa C 6 F had a clear seasonality in lipid accumulation and gonad maturation: high lipid accumulation was observed from October to February, whereas gonad maturation occurred from March to September. Paraeuchaeta glacialis C 6 F also showed seasonality in lipid accumulation and gonad maturation, although their seasonal patterns varied from those of M. longa: high lipid individuals were abundant from February to April and mature individuals dominated from October to November. Heterorhabdus norvegicus showed seasonal changes in population structure as well: C 1, C 5, and C 6 M dominated from April to May, November to February and August to October, respectively. The life cycle patterns of these species are compared with those reported from other areas. While the results obtained by a sediment trap are inevitably <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>collection</b> bias (i. e. passive collection at a fixed depth), a sediment trap should be considered as a powerful tool for the evaluation of the life cycle of planktonic copepods, especially in ice-covered oceans...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{immigration}} enforcement {{levels have}} soared, yielding a widely noted {{increase in the}} number of noncitizens removed from the United States. Less visible, however, has been an attendant sea change in the underlying nature of immigration governance itself, hastened by new surveillance and dataveillance technologies. Like many other areas of contemporary governance, immigration control has rapidly become an information-centered and technology-driven enterprise. At virtually every stage of the process of migrating or traveling to, from, and within the United States, both noncitizens and U. S. citizens are now <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>collection</b> and analysis of extensive quantities of personal information for immigration control and other purposes. This information is aggregated and stored by government agencies for long retention periods in networks of interoperable databases and shared among a variety of public and private actors, both inside and outside the United States, with little transparency, oversight, or accountability. In this Article, I theorize and assess this underappreciated transformation of the techniques and technologies of immigration enforcement—their swift proliferation, enormous scale, likely entrenchment, and broader meanings. Situating this reconfiguration within a larger set of developments concerning surveillance and technology, I explain how these technologies have transformed a regime of immigration control, operating primarily upon noncitizens at the territorial border, into part of a more expansive regime of migration and mobility surveillance, operating without geographic bounds upon citizens and noncitizens alike. The technologies that enable this immigration surveillance regime can, and do, bring great benefits. However, their unimpeded expansion erodes the practical mechanisms and legal principles that have traditionally constrained aggregations of power and protected individual autonomy, as similarly illustrated in current debates over surveillance in other settings. In the immigration context, those constraints have always been less robust in the first place. Accordingly, I urge more constrained implementation of these technologies to preserve zones where immigration surveillance activities do not take place and to ensure greater due process and accountability when they do. A complete understanding of immigration enforcement today must account for how the evolution of enforcement institutions, practices, and meanings has not simply increased the number of noncitizens being deported but has effected a more basic transformation in immigration governance. The institutions of immigration surveillance are becoming integrated into the broader national surveillance state very rapidly. As that reconfiguration proceeds, scholars, policymakers, advocates, and community members need to grapple more directly with its implications...|$|E

Forty eight 28 d old geese were assigned in to 3 treatments and 4 replicates (include 4 birds in each replicate). The experiment was arranged in completely randomized design (CRD). The injected dosage of ghrelin was different in treatments: 0, 50 and 100 µg ghrelin/kg BW. Injection procedure was conducted on d 28 of age and before onset of experimental rearing period. 12 h after ghrelin injection, two birds from each replicate of each treatment that had BW close to the mean replicate was <b>subjected</b> <b>to</b> <b>collection</b> of blood sample. Analysis of serum samples show that the injection of ghrelin caused insulin declines in serum (G 50 and G 100 in comparison with G 0). There is lower level of T 4 was observed for ghrelin-injected groups which group with high dosage of ghrelin (G 100) show lowest level of T 4. Uric acid had minor elevation for G 50 and dramatic elevation for G 100 when compared with G 0. Other parameters include T 3, Ca, P and Total protein haven’t any changes via peripheral ghrelin administration. In conclusion, ghrelin administration in goose can decrease insulin and T 4 levels and increases uric acid concentrations in serum.

Java’s garbage collection, while generally a useful feature, can be prob-lematic for real-time applications if collection occurs with unpre-dictable frequency and latency. The Real-Time Specification for JavaTM (RTSJ) incorporates a scoped-memory model, akin to regions, that is not <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> garbage <b>collection.</b> However, applications are <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> strict rules concerning how objects can reference each other in scoped memory.

Urine of affected buffaloes was positive for haemoglobin (100 %) and albumin (95 %) but negative for sugar and ketone bodies. Microscopic examination of urine of affected buffaloes revealed no intact erythrocytes. Grossly, carcasses of buffaloes died of PHU were anaemic and jaundiced. Kidneys, liver and spleen were pale, enlarged and congested. Liver was friable and swollen. Epicardium and endocardium showed ecchymotic haemorrhages. Lungs were emphysemated and oedematous.

The constraints can be assigned to nodes arbitrarily, and individual nodes do not require knowledge of the network topology or the constraints assigned to other nodes. Further, we assume that each node has a set of private optimization variables that participate in the global optimization problem but are unknown to other nodes of the graph.

For each group, twelve procedures were conducted for EEJ. Semen was evaluated for volume, color, aspect, motility, sperm concentration, morphology, viability, and functional membrane integrity. The highest efficiency (100 % ejaculates) was achieved when the control group was used; the xylazine/ketamine/propofol association provided only 11 ejaculates from a total of 12 attempts (91. 6 % efficiency), while only 4 ejaculates (33 % efficiency) were obtained with butorphanol/ketamine/propofol (P 0. 05). The semen volume and sperm concentration obtained {{in the use of}} xylazine/ketamine/propofol association were significantly higher than those verified for butorphanol/ketamine/propofol protocol. In conclusion, the xylazine/ketamine/propofol association is indicated for anesthesia of six-banded armadillos submitted to EEJ...|$|R
40|$|Among {{domestic}} animals, {{dogs are}} considered to be the major reservoirs of trypanosomatids and, due to their proximity to man, the presence of these parasites in dogs is an alert to actions aiming at triatomine control. Fifty dogs (26 males and 24 females), aged from 2 months to 15 years, belonging to 30 chronic Chagas’ disease individuals from 15 different municipalities in the western region of São Paulo State, Brazil, were <b>subjected</b> <b>to</b> blood <b>collection</b> for the following tests: artificial xenodiagnosis, blood culture, and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Forty-three (86 %) out of 50 dogs were positive to {{at least one of the}} tests performed; 34 (68 %) were positive to xenodiagnosis, 30 (60 %) to blood culture, and 25 (50 %) to PCR for T. cruzi and/or T. rangeli. Although triatomines were not detected during the intra and peridomiciliary inspections in the dog owners’ residences, the results obtained demonstrate that there is a transmission cycle whereby triatomine vector may be participating in the infection epidemiological chain...|$|R
