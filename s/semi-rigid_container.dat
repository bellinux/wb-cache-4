40|$|The {{bursting}} pressure test on <b>semi-rigid</b> <b>containers</b> made of aluminium-plastic-laminates or heat-sealable lacquered aluminium-thin-strips {{has now been}} generally adopted, especially for the production control of single portion packs. Thus, {{it is possible to}} continuously test the strength of the heat sealed seams of the packages and to control the condition and working of the heat sealing station of the respective packaging machine. Also the optimal heat sealing conditions can be determined that way. The factors of influence are being discussed, on which the achievable {{bursting pressure}} depends and it is demonstrated that the extent of the bursting pressure value is strongly depending on some of these factors. The required bursting pressure value should, therefore, be co-ordinated with the supplier of the <b>semi-rigid</b> <b>containers</b> or of the packaging machine before starting the production...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In this research, three {{dimensional}} mathematical {{models were}} developed to predict the shelf life of tofu packaged in a <b>semi-rigid</b> plastic <b>container.</b> A model combining oxygen transfer through the package and oxygen consumption within the package was considered. According to the results, the model simulations estimated {{that the number of}} microorganisms in the filled water was higher than that in the tofu, suggesting the shelf life of packaged tofu was not affected by the number of microorganisms in the tofu product, but rather by the number of organisms in the filled water. Additionally, the effects of the physical properties of the packaging material, such as oxygen permeability through the package, oxygen diffusion coefficient, the initial oxygen concentration in the filled water, and the depth of the filled wate...|$|R
50|$|This {{is rarely}} used however, because the lanyard {{attached}} to the handle runs through the girt to the valve, which is several inches too short when the girt is extended fully. When the slide is in the armed position and the door is opened, the slide pack falls free of the door bustle (a <b>semi-rigid</b> outer <b>container)</b> and the weight and momentum of the slide pulls the lanyard from the valve, initiating the flow of gas. At about the same time, a metal pin that holds {{the center of the}} Valise closed is also pulled, releasing a daisy chain and the two halves of the cover. When the cover is released and the inflation system activated, the two aspirators come shooting out of the pack, gulping vast quantities of air and restrained only by the fabric tubes to which they are securely fastened.|$|R
40|$|Should we use {{closed or}} open {{infusion}} containers for prevention of bloodstream infections? Manuel S Rangel-Frausto 1 †, Francisco Higuera-Ramirez 2 †, Jose Martinez-Soto 3 †, Victor D Rosenthal 4 * Background: Hospitalized patients in critical care settings {{are at risk}} for bloodstream infections (BSI). Most BSIs originate from a central line (CL), and they increase length of stay, cost, and mortality. Open infusion containers may increase the risk of contamination and administration-related (CLAB) because they allow the entry of air into the system, thereby also providing an opportunity for microbial entry. Closed infusion containers were designed to overcome this flaw. However, open infusion containers are still widely used throughout the world. The objective {{of the study was to}} determine the effect of switching from open (glass, burettes, and <b>semi-rigid)</b> infusion <b>containers</b> to closed, fully collapsible, plastic infusion containers (Viaflex®) on the rate and time to onset of central line-associated bloodstream infections CLABs.

40|$|The use of {{loosely packed}} items in rigid or <b>semi-rigid</b> <b>containers</b> is widespread. These {{packages}} are very often handled by high speed equipment {{and put in}} different environmental conditions which includes the possibility of mechanical damage, due to shock, impact and compression. So {{care must be taken}} that damage does not occur to both package and contents. The development of analytical and simulation techniques for investigating the dynamic behaviour of a package subject to handling and distribution hazards is becoming more possible by the use {{of a wide range of}} available software. The modelling of the dynamic behaviour of packaging systems during handling and transport is achieved by mathematical analysis where possible and supported by computer simulation. The analysis was carried out for a range of body properties in order to test the results against experimental data. Investigations into the applied package force/motion and subsequent package impact and deformation were carried out with a view to gaining an understanding of the forces involved. The dynamic analysis was undertaken using commercially available software but it is necessary to develop special techniques to enable it to be applied to this type of problem. Corrugated fibreboard containers subjected to internal and external loading will be subjected to stress, strain, deflection, and buckling to side panels. A Finite Element method of analysis of the panel was developed. The reaction of the panel to loading can be observed by means of this method. The failure of the container due to the loading can be predicted and the variability of the material and the panel can be changed arbitrarily to test and analyze different packaging designs. Corrugated fibreboard and container elements were treated as engineering structures so the engineering concepts of stress, stain, equilibrium and compatibility could be applied. A Finite Element method using the ANSYS code made it possible to analyze the structure behaviour and helps to partly solve the design optimization process for a corrugated container. The project includes four main aspects: Finite Element analysis of the corrugated fibreboard and container elements subjected to internal and external load. 2 Corrugated fibreboard material tests. 3 Modelling of a package-contents system 4 Simulation of the products-cushion-package system The main area of research that is described in this thesis is concerned with developing the analytical and experimental methods to model and analyze the behaviour of packaging. This enables the size of the cushioning structure to be minimized and the cushioning and package material to be selected appropriately. The final stage of this project was to develop the techniques for the prediction of the susceptibility to damage to packaging systems particularly during the design stage, and to develop a comprehensive technique for the design and justification of the package system...|$|R

40|$|Ethylene {{vinyl alcohol}} (EVOH) {{is one of}} the best known {{flexible}} thermoplastic oxygen barrier materials in use today. It is especially important for refrigerated and shelf-stable foods where oxygen deteriorates the quality of packaged products and reduces their shelf life. EVOH accounts for a majority of thermoplastic barrier materials used for rigid or <b>semi-rigid</b> retortable food <b>containers.</b> However. it is of limited use in flexible packages or lid films for rigid trays used for packaging thermally processed shelf-stable low acid foods due to its moisture sensitivity. Nevertheless, current use of other oxygen barrier materials such as polyvinylidene chloride and aluminum foil creates environmental concerns. Innovations in food processing technologies provide opportunities for increased use of EVOH in food packaging. The aim of this review is to give an overview of research on the oxygen barrier properties of EVOH from the perspective of structure-barrier property relationships and the consequences of food processing conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to determine the effect of switching from an open (glass or <b>semi-rigid</b> plastic) infusion <b>container</b> to a closed, fully collapsible plastic infusion container (Viaflex®) on rate and time to onset of central lineassociated bloodstream infections (CLABSI). An open-label, prospective cohort, active healthcare-associated infection surveillance, sequential study was conducted in three intensive care units in Brazil. The CLABSI rate using open infusion containers was compared to the rate using a closed infusion container. Probability of acquiring CLABSI was assessed over time and compared between open and closed infusion container periods; three-day intervals were examined. A total of 1125 adult ICU patients were enrolled. CLABSI rate was significantly higher during the open compared with the closed infusion container period (6. 5 versus 3. 2 CLABSI/ 1000 CL days; RR= 0. 49, 95 %CI= 0. 26 - 0. 95, p= 0. 031). During the closed infusion container period, the probability of acquiring a CLABSI remained relatively constant along the time of central line use (0. 8 % Days 2 - 4 to 0. 7 % Days 11 - 13) but increased in the open infusion container period (1. 5 % Days 2 - 4 to 2. 3 % Days 11 - 13). Combined across all time intervals, the chance of a patient acquiring a CLABSI was significantly lower (55 %) in the closed infusion container period (Cox proportional hazard ratio 0. 45, p= 0. 019). CLABSIs can be reduced with the use of full barrier precautions, education, and performance feedback. Our results show that switching from an open to a closed infusion container may further reduce CLABSI rate as well as delay the onset of CLABSIs. Closed infusion containers significantly reduced CLABSI rate and the probability of acquiring CLABSI...|$|R
