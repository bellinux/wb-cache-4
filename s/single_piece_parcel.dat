50|$|A beam coupling, {{also known}} as helical coupling, is a {{flexible}} coupling for transmitting torque between two shafts while allowing for angular misalignment, parallel offset and even axial motion, of one shaft relative to the other. This design utilizes a <b>single</b> <b>piece</b> of material and becomes flexible by removal of material along a spiral path resulting in a curved flexible beam of helical shape. Since it is made from a <b>single</b> <b>piece</b> of material, the Beam Style coupling does not exhibit the backlash found in some multi-piece couplings. Another advantage of being an all machined coupling is the possibility to incorporate features into the final product while still keep the <b>single</b> <b>piece</b> integrity.|$|R
