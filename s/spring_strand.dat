Respiratory rate at rest and exercise in adolescents also because the depth is less than most adults. This requires {{that the increase in}} respiratory complications in these patients should be examined. The aim of this study the resistance of the airways and the status of bronchospasm in two different conditions of hot and cold air in young male athletes. Material and Methods: Thirty-five high school students volunteer in Ahwaz city (16 - 18) year’s average height (178 cm), weight (66 kg), body mass index of 25 / 14. 92 percent of lung function of FVC, The winter air temperature 14 ° C and 68 % relative humidity and air temperature in spring, 42 ° C and relative humidity was 76 %. Before running the tests measurements are recorded. Low intensity aerobic exercise protocols used to measure the bulk has been. High-intensity aerobic exercise test to measure the Astrand on the treadmill in the winter (January) and spring (June) has been made. In the seasons before and after the exercise test, pulmonary parameters of FVC, FEV 1, FEV 1 /FVC were measured. Using t-test, paired and independent results after the test with a (p ≤ 0. 05) in two different storage temperatures and at high intensity and low-practice cases are compared. Results: Results showed that compared FEV 1, FEV 1 /FVC to the pre-test parameters and test the bulk test in winter and spring and winter and <b>spring</b> <b>Strand</b> test is significant. Astrand test results as well as between the Bulks test in the winter and spring, significant differences were observed. According to the results, only 4 people (14 %) followed by the low-intensity activity in spring and develop bronchospasm were airway resistances. On the other hand, high intensity activities in winter in 14 patients or 40 % of subjects are bronchospasm and increased resistance of the air way. Conclusion: General exercise with high intensity in cold weather conditions caused evoked of the lungs airway and and restricted the airflow (than exercise with low intensity in warm weather conditions) in boy's students...|$|E

[...] In Westralunio carteri, a mature glochidium {{is equipped with}} a pair of interlocking 'larval teeth' on opposing valves; the shell is translucent brown in colour and has a single adductor muscle and shell length, on average, is 306-309 μm. Mature glochidia are released from females during <b>spring</b> on <b>strands</b> of mucus while still encased in their vitelline membranes (a proteinaceous 'egg sac'),.

[...] Once contact is made with a fish, the glochidia attach to the fishes' body surfaces including areas of the fins, eye, mouth, opercula, and sometimes the gills,. [...] Following attachment to their host fish, the glochidia are encased by epithelial cells, which forms a cyst,. [...] They remain in the cyst for 21-28 days as the undergo a process of metamorphosis and develop into juvenile freshwater mussels (characterised by the disappearance of the single adductor muscle and the formation of two separate adductor muscles and a ciliated foot, among other features) when they then detach from their host and begin life in the sediments, where they develop into their adult form,.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis work {{is devoted}} to the {{computation}} of axial stiffness of helical beam-like structures. Starting from the homogenization theory of periodic slender domains and taking benefit of the property of helical symmetry, the overall elastic behavior can be obtained from the solution of three-dimensional problems posed on a reduced basic cell. The mechanical analysis of this reduced basic cell performed using a concise FE model allows therefore to compute easily the anisotropic beam homogenized stiffness coefficients. The accuracy and usefulness of this approach is demonstrated by comparisons with reference solutions and large FE model results for two numerical volume structure examples: a wire <b>spring</b> and a <b>stranded</b> “ 6 + 1 ” rope. The homogenization procedure is then applied to single-walled carbon nanotubes and it is shown from the two helical symmetries that their basic cell can be reduced to three beam elements...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — We {{present the}} design of simple, centimeter-scale modular {{actuation}} units (“Active Cells”) and passive compliant nodes that are electromechanically networked to create macroscopically deformable Modular Active Cell-based Structures (MACROs). Each Active Cell is a single degree-of-freedom linear actuator (a “muscle unit”), consisting of fiberglass end-pieces connecting two strands of Nitinol shape-memory alloy and a passive biasing <b>spring.</b> The Nitinol <b>strands</b> are coiled into a tight spring to increase deformations when activated through resistive heating. In-depth examination of the optimization of Nitinol coils with an antagonistic spring is presented, resulting in large repeatable axial cell strains of up to 25 %. The design of these cellular muscle units to obtain maximal repeatable stroke is presented, allowing {{for the construction of}} larger networks of cells (MACRO modules, akin to a biological “tissue”) that can be customized to a target application. Finally, experimental demonstration of the construction and actuation of some simple MACRO modules is described. I...|$|R

"It was a grand {{sight to}} see that ship dashing {{straight}} towards the shore at fearful speed; and those who looked on seemed to be impressed with a vague feeling that she had power to <b>spring</b> upon the <b>strand</b> and continue her swift career through the forest, as she had hitherto cleft her passage through the sea. As she approached, the savages shrank back in fear. Suddenly her frame trembled with a mighty shock. A terrible cry was borne to land by the gale, and all her masts went overboard. A huge wave lifted the vessel on its crest and flung her further on the shore, where she remained firmly fixed, while the waves dashed in foam around her and soon began to break her up. Ere this happened, however, a rope was thrown ashore and fastened to a rock by the natives. By means of this the crew were saved. But {{it would have been}} well for these bold navigators of Portugal if they had perished in the stormy sea, for they were spared by the ocean, only to be murdered by the wild savages, on whose shore they had been cast.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{corresponds}} to {{the second part of}} a study that aims at modeling helical structures accounting for translational invariance. In the Part 1 of this paper, the static behavior has been addressed using a helical homogenization approach which provides the stress state corresponding to axial loads. The latter is considered as a prestressed state, for elastic wave propagation analysis in helical waveguides, which is the subject of the Part 2 of this paper. Non destructive testing of <b>springs</b> and multi-wire <b>strands</b> is a potential application of the proposed model. Accounting for translational invariance, the elastodynamic equations of prestressed helical structures yield a 2 D problem posed on the cross-section, corresponding to a so-called semi-analytical finite element (SAFE) formulation. For helical springs, the numerical model is validated with an analytical solution corresponding to a Timoshenko beam approximation. It is shown that the influence of the prestressed state is significant at low frequencies. Finally, a seven-wire strand subjected to axial loads is considered. The computed dispersion curves are compared to experimental data. Good agreement is obtained for the first compressional-like modes and their veering central frequency...|$|R
40|$|Guided {{waves are}} {{commonly}} used to control large components such as plates and tubes since they have the advantage to spread over long distances with little loss of energy. Because of the dispersive and multimodal behaviour of guided waves, simulation becomes a very helpful tool for a proper analysis of these tests. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to numerically investigate the effect of axial preload on the propagation of elastic waves in helical waveguides. Typical applications are <b>springs</b> and multi-wire <b>strands.</b> The study of wave propagation in prestressed helical structures requires the development of the equation of dynamics in a helical coordinate system. The three dimensional equilibrium equations of prestressed dynamics are rewritten in the helical covariant and contravariant bases. The problem then becomes translationnally invariant along the waveguide axis and can be solved with a semi-analytical finite element (SAFE) technique. The problem is hereby reduced to the two-dimensions of the cross-section. The SAFE eigenproblem can be solved by setting the wavenumber and finding the angular frequency or inversely. This numerical model is validated by an analytical model of wave propagation in a helical Timoshenko beam under axial preload. Dispersion curves for single straight and helical wires are computed to quantify the effect of prestress. For small lay angles, the dispersion curves for wavenumbers as well as energy velocities present small differences with the infinite straight cylinder. The effect of prestress is significant for lower frequencies. Some results are also obtained for helix with larger lay angles...|$|R

I have analysed the spatio-temporal distribution of Cuvier’s beaked whale, using dedicated and opportunistic sightings and the interactions with fixed physical variables (depth, slope and aspect), non-fixed environmental variables (sea surface temperature) in the Bay of Biscay, northeast Atlantic. This study used a differing combination of environmental variables and modelling: GAM (General Additive Model), and ENFA (Ecological Niche Factor Analysis), and PCA (Principal Component Analysis). Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and Remote Sensing were used to achieve this. The habitat preferences of Cuvier’s beaked whale showed strong correlations with water depths > 1000 m and < 4000 m and steep slopes, associated with the Capbreton canyon, in the southeast Bay of Biscay and the continental shelf slopes in northern Biscay. Areas of high suitability for Cuvier’s beaked whale were predicted for the Bay of Biscay and predictions showed high habitat suitability areas over continental shelf slopes and submarine canyons. The variety of modelling techniques used to identify the habitat preferences and to predict areas of high suitability for Cuvier’s beaked whale in the Bay of Biscay all proved advantageous. On a global scale, techniques such as these could be applied to help research worldwide for future implementations of protected areas to conserve and maintain this species. The abundance and distribution of Cuvier’s beaked whales varied between years and seasons, with an increase in sightings over time and a seasonal distribution shifting north during <b>spring</b> and summer. <b>Stranding</b> records were also analyzed and compared with the sightings data, which identified regional patterns in seasonal distribution between France, the UK and Ireland. In addition to Cuvier’s beaked whale, this study investigated other deep-diving cetaceans (Northern bottlenose whale, Hyperoodon ampullatus, Sowerby’s beaked whale, Mesoplodon bidens, Sperm whale, Physalus macrocephalus, Pilot whale, Globicephala melas) and non-deep diving cetaceans (Fin whale, Balaenoptera physalus, and Common dolphin, Delphinus delphis) observed in the Bay of Biscay and the English Channel. The Bay of Biscay is the most northerly range of the Cuvier’s beaked whale in the eastern north Atlantic and with year round observations, it could be suggested the population may be resident. This raises the question, could Cuvier’s beaked whale act as a predictor of increasing water temperatures because of climate change by shifting their distribution further north...|$|R
