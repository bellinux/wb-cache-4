25|$|I'm {{a little}} baffled {{as to why}} Stirling set this book in 1998. It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{requires}} more suspension of disbelief to pretend the world ended {{in the past when}} we know it didn't.|$|E
25|$|Some {{languages}} have {{a distinct}} grammatical category of evidentiality {{that is required}} to be expressed at all times. The elements in European languages indicating the information source are optional and usually do not indicate evidentiality as their primary function — thus they do not form a grammatical category. The obligatory elements of grammatical evidentiality systems may be translated into English, variously, as I hear that, I see that, I think that, as I hear, as I can see, as far as I understand, they say, it is said, it seems, it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that,</b> <b>it</b> looks like, it appears that, it turns out that, alleged, stated, allegedly, reportedly, obviously, etc.|$|E
500|$|A little {{matter that}} seems to have been {{overlooked}} by all of you is the opportunity to beautify the design of the nickel or five cent piece during your administration, and it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would be a permanent souvenir of a most attractive sort. [...] As possibly you are aware, it is the only coin the design of which you can change during your administration, as I believe there is a law to the effect that the designs must not be changed oftener than every twenty-five years. [...] I should think also it might be the coin of which the greatest numbers are in circulation.|$|E
60|$|I may be mistaken, {{but it does}} <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> Deerslayer is not {{a work of art}} in any sense; it does <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> it is {{destitute}} {{of every}} detail that goes to the making of a work of art; in truth, it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> Deerslayer is just simply a literary delirium tremens.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{the most}} terrible thing in likenesses I have ever seen," [...] the woman {{continued}} slowly. [...] "When you entered the room a few seconds ago, it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> a miracle had happened. It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the dead had come to life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A balloon?" [...] said Bernard. [...] "Nay, it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{till they}} were over, I never thought at all except {{how to get}} the most rollicking and the finest rowing out of life. It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I had about as much sense as a green monkey." ...|$|R
500|$|Johnson {{called his}} U.S.-based {{advisers}} to his Texas ranch for discussions on Christmas Day. Secretary of State Dean Rusk and Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara advised Johnson to reject Taylor's proposal. Johnson declined to act, stating that an escalation during the Christmas period would be inappropriate, {{as it would}} damage public morale. He also noted {{that because of the}} political instability in Saigon, the international community and the American public were unlikely to believe that the Vietcong were behind the attack, feeling that they would instead blame local infighting for the bombing. This was {{despite the fact that the}} Vietcong had already claimed responsibility. Johnson administration officials concluded four days after the bombing that the Vietcong were responsible. Johnson believed that it was too late to retaliate and that any action taken more than 36 hours after the event constituted unprovoked aggression. The State Department cabled Taylor and the embassy, saying that [...] "In view of the overall confusion in Saigon", public U.S. and international opinion towards an American air strike would be that the Johnson administration was [...] "trying to shoot its way out of an internal [...] political crisis". Johnson said to Taylor that [...] "Every time I get a military recommendation it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> calls for large-scale bombing. I have never felt that this war will be won from the air." [...] At the time, Johnson was reluctant to accede to his officials' calls for large-scale bombing of North Vietnam, a strategy that eventually became policy.|$|E
2500|$|... "He is {{the boss}} American missionary out here. He {{really is a}} fine man, and during the siege one of the bravest....It was what {{happened}} after the siege was over, when the looting began, that I find fault with. At least, I don't find fault with it, but it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> needs explanation." ...|$|E
2500|$|At this dinner Göring {{presented}} Lindbergh {{with the}} Commander Cross of the Order of the German Eagle. Lindbergh's acceptance proved controversial after Kristallnacht, an anti-Jewish pogrom in Germany {{a few weeks}} later. Lindbergh declined to return the medal, later writing: [...] "It {{seems to me that}} the returning of decorations, which were given in times of peace and as a gesture of friendship, can have no constructive effect. If I were to return the German medal, it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would be an unnecessary insult. Even if war develops between us, I can see no gain in indulging in a spitting contest before that war begins." ...|$|E

2500|$|Mack was {{somewhat}} more guarded in his investigations and {{interpretations of the}} abduction phenomenon than were earlier researchers. Literature professor Terry Matheson writes that [...] "On balance, Mack does present as fair-minded an account as has been encountered to date, at least as these abduction narratives go." [...] In a 1994 interview, [...] Jeffrey Mishlove stated that Mack seemed [...] "inclined to take these [...] reports at face value". Mack replied by saying [...] "Face value I wouldn't say. I take them seriously. I don't {{have a way to}} account for them." [...] Similarly, the BBC quoted Mack as saying, [...] "I would never say, yes, there are aliens taking people. [...] I would say there is a compelling powerful phenomenon here that I can't account for in any other way, that's mysterious. Yet I can't know what it is but it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> invites a deeper, further inquiry." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why,--I don't know,"--said Mr. George, {{speaking}} in rather a doubtful tone. [...] "It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would be hardly worth while." ...|$|E
60|$|Looking {{over what}} has gone before, it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is not {{strictly}} polite. I beg to withdraw all that is offensive.|$|E

6000|$|... "What do I say now, Celia?" [...] {{retorted}} Elmore, {{with just}} indignation. [...] "It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{is for you}} to say something--or nothing." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> online {{copyright}} infringement is {{a legitimate}} problem, but it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> COICA as written is the wrong medicine. Deploying this statute to combat online copyright infringement seems almost like using a bunker-busting cluster bomb when {{what you really need}} is a precision-guided missile. The collateral damage of this statute could be American innovation, American jobs, and a secure Internet." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Nay,' was the answer, 'it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was {{owing to}} his having {{the root of}} the matter in him to {{overcome}} his natural failings.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Tis {{a savage}} war," [...] the {{governor}} said, shrugging his shoulders, [...] "and it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> will continue, {{until the last}} Welshman is exterminated." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, post {{your men}} as you like," [...] Gurth said; [...] "though it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{would be better}} for them to husband their {{strength}} for to-morrow's march." ...|$|E
