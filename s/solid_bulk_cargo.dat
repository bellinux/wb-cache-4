40|$|In 2011, {{legislation}} that governs the safe transportation of solid bulk cargoes, {{known as the}} International Maritime Solid Bulk Cargoes Code (IMSBC Code), became mandatory under the SOLAS Convention. Included in this legislation are test methods used to determine a safe moisture content that certain solid bulk cargoes can contain, during transportation, {{if they have been}} deemed potentially liquefiable. Liquefaction of a cargo <b>solid</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>cargo</b> during transportation can result in the cargo shifting and altering the buoyancy of the transporting vessel. Depending on the mass of cargo that shifts, it may result in the vessel listing or capsizing. Between 1988 and 2016, 23 incidents were reported where liquefaction of a <b>solid</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>cargo</b> was suspected. These incidents resulted in 138 casualties and the loss of 17 vessels. Due to the mandatory implementation of the IMSBC Code and the occurrences of incidents where liquefaction of iron ore fines was suspected during transportation, industries and research institutions were required to consider the adequacy of the current methods and/or amend or introduce a suitable method for testing the cargo. The outcome of this work was the introduction of a new test method specifically designed for the testing of iron ore fines. The test, known as the Modified Proctor/Fagerberg Test (MPFT), was first introduced in 2013 and its use was made mandatory from January 2017. As previously stated, the MPFT was designed to determine a moisture content under which a cargo of iron ore fines was considered unable to liquefy and therefore safe for marine transportation. During preliminary testing and investigations, questions arose surrounding the; validity of the test, methodology behind its creation, and whether liquefaction was indeed the correct phenomenon that was occurring, which resulted in cargoes of iron ore fines shifting during marine transportation. The objective of this research was to investigate, at a fundamental level, the possible phenomena that may be responsible for cargoes of iron ore fines shifting, in the holds of bulk carriers, during marine transportation. In this study, both practical and theoretical analysis were employed to visualize as well as objectively quantify, both the cause and type of phenomena that may be possible. To fully understand and reproduce the possible phenomena, standard test methods were used, in combination with unique and novel methods, designed and developed during this study. Summarizing the information that was gathered and produced during this research resulted in conclusions regarding the validity of implementing the MPFT that is used to protect against liquefaction during marine transportation. It was concluded that there are multiple phenomena that can result in a cargo of iron ore fines shifting in the hold of a bulk carrier during marine transportation, with a sensitive dependence on initial conditions. Although liquefaction was the primary phenomenon suspected, this study concludes that liquefaction of the cargo, as a whole, is unlikely. There are two likely phenomena that both masquerade as full cargo liquefaction. The first phenomenon is identified as liquefaction, although not liquefaction of the cargo as a whole as speculated. It was shown that moisture migration can occur towards the surface of the cargo transporting fine particles creating areas of material with a greater potential to liquefy. This research also identified incremental collapse as another possible phenomenon that may occur resulting in a cargo of iron ore fines shifting. Unlike partial liquefaction as described above, this phenomenon is most likely to occur to an untrimmed cargo. Incremental collapse may ultimately result in a shear plane developing resulting in the cargo abruptly shearing, such as occurs during a slope failure. These phenomena can be linked to the behaviour of the cargoes and vessels described during the suspected liquefaction incidents investigated during this research. It was also concluded that the principal theory used to design and develop the MPFT is not one that is widely accepted in geotechnical engineering and soil mechanics to determine the liquefaction potential or cyclic behaviour of soils. It was identified that the moisture-holding ability of iron ore fines is a major influence in the likelihood of partial liquefaction occurring. Preventing moisture migration will likely prevent the possibility of partial liquefaction. During this research, the Transportable Moisture Limit (TML), the parameter determined using the MPFT, was consistently equal to or higher than the moisture contents measured where migration of moisture and fine particles were recorded. This indicated that if a cargo of iron ore fines is loaded onto a bulk carrier, at the TML, moisture migration may occur resulting in areas within the cargo with a high potential to liquefy. The results from this study are based on the results from the testing of limited specimens of iron ore fines. The comments and conclusions made within this thesis relate to the assumption that iron ore fines, as a cargo, have a constantly changing and significantly wide range of physical properties, from location to location, which has also been shown to be the case. The majority of the results from this research are presented in eight international journals, which are included in chapters within this thesis. Additional results that have not yet been published are currently being prepared or reviewed for publication. In this day and age, the loss of human life is unacceptable under any circumstance and must be avoided at all costs. Incidents occurring during the transportation of iron ore fines and other similar solid bulk cargoes can and must be avoided to protect the safety of maritime personnel, the environment, and prevent the needless loss of resources and assets. Hopefully, this research will not only improve safety at sea but may be built upon in the future and used for the analysis of other solid bulk cargoes where the occurrence of such phenomenon is still prevalent, such as nickel ore and/or bauxite...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} is to identify {{the differences between the}} geotechnical properties of raw and processed Gebeng bauxite. Raw bauxite deposits usually contain a higher percentage of clay and siliceous materials. The silica present in the bauxite usually are concentrated in the finer grained fraction of the bauxite deposit. The fine particles in bauxite will cause the bauxite to have higher moisture content and increases the risk of liquefaction to occur during the bauxite’s transportation in cargo.

40|$|<b>Solid</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>cargoes</b> {{have been}} known to liquefy in the holds of bulk {{carriers}} since the loss of the Bengal in 1910. Because of the increased demand for iron ore fines over the past 20 years, export industries have experienced further incidents where liquefaction of the cargo was the suspected cause. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop a scale model of bulk carrier hold in order to investigate the variability of the physical properties of iron ore fines, which govern the liquefaction potential under cyclic loading. Additionally, by associating the theory of liquefaction of partially saturated soils to the cyclic behaviour of the samples, the apparent shear strength of the samples can be determined. During this study a scale model and an iron ore fines plunger were developed and utilised. The physical properties of the samples of iron ore fines were monitored during the scale model test, and the point at which moisture migration began to occur was determined. The boundary where the material showed a significant loss of shear strength, referred to as the critical failure curve, was also determined using the iron ore fines plunger. After consistent results were shown using both methods, the moisture content at which the sample was considered potentially liquefiable was concluded and compared with the results from the current test method used to reduce liquefaction incidents on bulk carriers...|$|R

Methods/Statistical Analysis: Laboratory test had been done to three different locations from bauxite mines and one from stockpile in Gebeng, Kuantan to identify its basic properties; particle size distribution, moisture content, specific gravity and its morphological properties. Results are then compared with International Maritime <b>Solid</b> <b>Bulk</b> <b>Cargoes</b> (IMSBC) Code; an international standard for cargo transportation for exporting purpose to ensure those raw materials are passing the standard so that the tendency for the material to liquefy is low. Findings: From laboratory test conducted, the average value of moisture content from air-dry and oven-dry method are 20. 45 % and 23. 33 %, respectively. Average particles size of Kuantan Bauxite smaller than 2. 5 mm is 35 % means bauxite samples collected consists of fine particles more than lumps and images obtained from SEM test proved that there is abundance of fine particles attached to the bauxite ore. Application/Improvements: Referring to the IMSBC Code, it can be stated that bauxite sample collected from Gebeng mines does not qualify to be classified under Group C as its basic properties are not within the limits imposed by IMSBC Code. This is due to the presence of high fine particles which tend to absorb water more than granular particles that may lead to liquefaction to occur. Liquefaction in <b>bulk</b> <b>cargoes</b> is very dangerous since the probability for the cargoes to capsize is very high. In order to ensure the bauxite is passing the standard, ‘beneficiation’ process should be conducted to eliminate fine particles...|$|R

With this, the growing demand from countries, such as China and Japan for iron ore produced in countries, such as Australia and Brazil, is only increasing. Iron Ore Fines (IOF) are a product of iron ore, commonly having a particle size less than 6. 3 mm, which is transported around the world in bulk carriers. Since the holds of bulk carriers are not designed to carry liquid, if liquefaction of IOF or other minerals occurs, it can cause the vessel carrying the cargo to list or even capsize. Since 2006, there have been at least eight reported bulk carrier incidents possibly caused by the iron ore cargo shifting.

40|$|If some <b>solid</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>cargoes</b> such as concentrates, {{unprocessed}} {{nickel ores}} and iron ore fines contain sufficient moisture, then cargo compaction during a voyage may cause liquefaction. This {{has been known}} to result in major cargo displacement ('cargo shift'), causing the vessel to capsize. This has resulted in a number of fatalities. To provide context to this interdisciplinary problem, an overview of the key considerations is presented, which includes: (i) a summary of the wide range of factors that influence a cargo's likelihood to shift; (ii) the soil mechanics principles {{that can be used to}} explain cargo shift; and (iii) the regulatory controls that are used to prevent its occurrence during shipment. Under the requirements of international maritime regulation, primarily the International Maritime <b>Bulk</b> <b>Solid</b> <b>Cargoes</b> (IMSBC) Code, a cargo that may liquefy must be shipped below a threshold moisture content, the 'Transportable Moisture Limit' (TML) —as determined from one of three laboratory test methods specified within the IMSBC Code. However, there are recognised problems with these tests, namely that for any given sample tested: (i) the tests give variable TML results, particularly when conducted in different laboratories; and (ii) each of the three test methods give a different TML result. As the TML determines a cargo's transportability, these issues have commercial and safety implications. To address these issues for the two most popular test methods, the Flow Table Test (FTT) and Proctor/Fagerberg Test (PFT), tests were performed on sand and iron ore fines. For each test, major sources of variability were identified, along with issues inherent in the test methodology. From these findings, a number of recommendations and several modifications have been proposed that, if implemented within the IMSBC Code, will improve the tests' reliability. The results were then compared to establish whether the different TML results obtained from the two test methods could be aligned—this showed that calibration between the methods was not possible on the basis of their TML. The test method assessment also incorporated observations at TML test facilities, interviews with leading researchers and an assessment of archive research material. Whilst the findings related to variability will help improve the reliability of the TML test methods, the accuracy of these methods is still not understood (i. e. how well do they indicate the likelihood for an actual cargo to liquefy?). This thesis therefore gives consideration to the likely accuracy of the TML test methods. It presents an improved representation of the cargo shift problem, with a view of providing future researchers with a basis to further assess this accuracy and thus the suitability of the TML as a criteria to detect cargoes which may liquefy.
