40|$|Summary. A Dynamic Finite Element Model (DFEM) of the {{interaction}} of a stress wave with a cylindrical hole is shown to yield good agreement with analytical solutions based on both Integral Transform and Fourier-Bessel techniques. Experimental results were obtained for {{the interaction}} of an explosion-generated stress wave with accelerometers mounted in a cylindrical hole drilled into massive rock. Both theory and experiment indicate a similar distortion in the rise time of {{the onset of the}} acceleration pulse travelling past the cylindrical hole. The dynamic model is also used to obtain amplitude transfer functions for a range of inclusion-type mounts that may be used to locate a <b>seismic</b> <b>detector</b> within a cylindrical hole. The modelling results indi-cate that if only partial contact is made between an in-hole mount and the walls of the cylindrical hole, then significant distortions arise in the amplitude response of the mounted detector to an incident stress wave. For wavelengths greater than 10 times the cylindrical hole diameter the effect of any in-hole mount is shown to be negligible, thus the results have little relevance for the long wavelengths commonly encountered in earthquake seismology. The results are, however, relevant to the study of stress wave propagation at ultra-sonic frequencies in rock masses...|$|E

40|$|Abstract An {{artificial}} neural network-based pattern {{classification system}} {{is applied to}} seismic event detection. We have designed two types of Artificial Neural Detector (AND) for real-time arthquake detection.

40|$|Stars are {{transparent}} to {{the passage}} of primordial black holes (PBHs) and serve as <b>seismic</b> <b>detectors</b> for such objects. The gravitational field of a PBH squeezes a star and causes it to ring acoustically. We calculate the seismic signature of a PBH passing through the Sun.

We predict that PBHs more massive than 10 ^ 21 g (comparable in mass to an asteroid) are detectable by existing solar observatories. The oscillations excited by PBHs peak at large scales and high frequencies, making them potentially detectable in other stars.

40|$|A {{feasibility}} study is {{conducted to determine}} whether reflection seismology systems {{can be used for}} planetary geology research. The focus is on systems with up to 20, 000 <b>seismic</b> <b>detectors,</b> such as used today in Earth geological research and energy companies. The study follows a top-down systems engineering end-user approach starting with the identification of possible applications of a seismic system. These applications (scenarios) have been determined with the help of geologists. These scenarios are transformed into system requirements using geophysicists’ methods. Among these methods are simulations where the seismic image was simulated of subsurface structures based on models. Concepts are created based on current reflection seismology technologies and key areas, which require improvements for a space application. To keep the end result as broadly applicable as possible, no specific mission or scenario was used as reference. Instead, a set of possible missions was drafted. Suitable concepts will be selected for each mission type. At the time of writing (September 2009), the system requirements are determined and various concepts are created.

50|$|It {{was during}} Oliver's years at Columbia {{that he and}} his {{students}} Bryan Isacks and Lynn Sykes undertook the research leading to their 1968 paper, “Seismology and the New Global Tectonics,” which provided strong evidence for the acceptance of plate tectonics. The paper was based on the findings of earthquakes hundreds of miles under the Pacific Ocean found using a network of <b>seismic</b> <b>detectors</b> that Oliver and his team had placed on Fiji and Tonga. The research by Oliver's team led them to conclude that the collision of tectonic plates was forcing material deep into the earth where they met below the Pacific Ocean, and provided strong evidence of the existence of continental drift, a theory that had been largely scoffed at by the scientific community when it was first proposed by Alfred Wegener in 1912. The order of the three coauthors' names on that paper (Isacks, Oliver, Sykes) was decided by lot, according to a footnote on the paper. This odd choice provoked speculation, but Oliver explained that decision was made before writing the paper, as all three authors worked full speed in what they saw as a race against other researchers.|$|R

In particular, for China {{to keep up with the}} latest technology of these systems, it is important to be involved in the research and development, instead of importing systems that soon fall behind the latest technology. In this study, the features of system-on-a-programmable-chip (SoPC) technology are analyzed and used to design a new digital seismic-data acquisition station. The hardware circuit of the station was developed, and the analog board and the main control data-transmission board were designed according to the needs of digital seismic-data acquisition stations. High-definition analog-to-digital converter sequential digital filter technology of the station (cascade integrator comb filter, finite impulse response digital filter) were incorporated to provide advantages to the acquisition station, such as high definition, large dynamic scope, and low noise. A specific data-transmission protocol was designed for the station, which ensured a transmission speed of 16 Mbps along a 55 -m wire with low power consumption. Synchronic acquisition was researched and developed, so as to achieve accuracy better than 200 ns. The key technologies were integrated into the SoPC of the main control data-transmission board, so as to ensure high-resolution acquisition of the station, while improving the accuracy of the synchronic acquisition and data-transmission speed, lowering the power consumption, and preparing for the follow-up efforts to tape out. </p...|$|R
40|$|Recognizing seismic waves {{immediately}} is {{very important}} for the realization of efficient disaster prevention. Generally these systems consist of a network of <b>seismic</b> <b>detectors</b> that send real time data to a central server. The server elaborates the data and attempts to recognize the first signs of an earthquake. The current problem with this approach is that it is subject to false alarms. A critical trade-off exists between sensitivity of the system and error rate. To overcame this problems, an artificial neural network based intelligent learning systems can be used. However, conventional supervised ANN systems are difficult to train, CPU intensive and prone to false alarms. To surpass these problems, here we attempt to use a next-generation unsupervised cortical algorithm HTM. This novel approach does not learn particular waveforms, but adapts to continuously fed data reaching the ability to discriminate between normality (seismic sensor background noise in no-earthquake conditions) and anomaly (sensor response to a jitter or an earthquake). Main goal of this study is test the ability of the HTM algorithm to be used to signal earthquakes automatically in a feasible disaster prevention system. We describe the methodology used and give the first qualitative assessments of the recognition ability of the system. Our preliminary results show that the cortical algorithm used is very robust to noise and that can successfully recognize synthetic earthquake-like signals efficiently and reliably.
