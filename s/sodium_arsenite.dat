40|$|Background: Arsenic {{is one of}} {{the most}} toxic metalloids. Anemia and {{leukopenia}} are common results of poisoning with arsenic, which may happen due to a direct hemolytic or cytotoxic effect on blood cells. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of hydroalcoholic extract of Nasturtium officinale on blood cells and antioxidant enzymes in rats exposed to <b>sodium</b> (meta) <b>arsenite.</b> Methods: 32 Male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups; Group I (normal healthy rats), Group II (treated with 5. 5 mg/kg of body weight of NaAsO 2), Group III (treated with 500 mg/kg of body weight of hydro-alcoholic extract of N. officinale), and Group IV (treated with group II and III supplementations). Blood samples were collected and red blood cell, white blood cell, hematocrit, hemoglobin, platelet, total protein and albumin levels and total antioxidant capacity were measured. Data was analyzed with Mann-Whitney U test. Results: WBC, RBC and Hct were decreased in the rats exposed to NaAsO 2 (p< 0. 05). A significant increase was seen in RBC and Hct after treatment with the plant extract (p< 0. 05). There was no significant decrease in serum albumin and total protein in the groups exposed to NaAsO 2 compared to the group I, but NaAsO 2 decreased the total antioxidant capacity, significantly.

40|$|Inorganic arsenic is a {{well-known}} human skin carcinogen. Chronic arsenic exposure results in various types of human skin lesions, including squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). To investigate whether mutant stem cells participate in arsenic-associated carcinogenesis, we repeatedly exposed the HaCaT cells line to an environmentally relevant level of arsenic (0. 05 ppm) in vitro for 18 weeks. Following <b>sodium</b> arsenic <b>arsenite</b> administration, cell cycle, colony-forming efficiency (CFE), cell tumorigenicity, and expression of CD 44 v 6, NF-κB and p 53, were analyzed at different time points (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 passages). We found that a chronic exposure of HaCaT cells to {{a low level of}} arsenic induced a cancer stem- like phenotype. Furthermore, arsenic-treated HaCaT cells also became tumorigenic in nude mice, their growth cycle was predominantly in G 2 /M and S phases. Relative to nontreated cells, they exhibited a higher growth rate and a significant increase in CFE. Western blot analysis found that arsenic was capable of increasing cell proliferation and sprouting of cancer stem-like phenotype. Additionally, immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that CD 44 v 6 expression was up-regulated in HaCaT cells exposed to a low level of arsenic during early stages of induction. The expression of CD 44 v 6 in arsenic-treated cells was positively correlated with their cloning efficiency in soft agar (r= 0. 949, P= 0. 01). Likewise, the expressions of activating transcription factor NF-κB and p 53 genes in the arsenic-treated HaCaT cells were significantly higher than that in non-treated cells. Higher expressions of CD 44 v 6, NF-κB and p 53 were also observed in tumor tissues isolated from Balb/c nude mice. The present results suggest that CD 44 v 6 may be a biomarker of arsenic-induced neoplastic transformation in human skin cells, and that arsenic promotes malignant transformation in human skin lesions through a NF-κB signaling pathway-stimulated expression of CD 44 v 6...|$|R

40|$|In Australia, {{the main}} future use of rehabilitated mine land is to stock grazing animals. Criteria for {{environmental}} management and rehabilitation of mine sites {{have become more}} stringent with the increasing awareness of the potential of harmful elements including arsenic in tailings. Bioavailability data are lacking to provide realistic health risk assessment of arsenic from mine tailings in Australian conditions. For the evaluation of comparative bioavailability, groups of three cattle were fed 5 days a week, a diet spiked with mine tailings or <b>sodium</b> arsenate or <b>arsenite</b> for 8 months. Blood, biopsy of the muscle and liver were periodically collected to monitor arsenic accumulation. At necropsy, blood, muscle, liver, kidney and other saleable tissues were measured for arsenic concentrations.

The field data confirm the relative low bioavailability of arsenic from mine tailings to grazing cattle.

40|$|Living organisms respond at the {{cellular}} and molecular levels to unfavourable conditions of their environment, {{commonly referred to}} as stress, by the rapid, and transient alteration of the genetic expression pattern. Thus, a small number of specific proteins, the stress proteins or HSPs, is vigorously induced, whereas the expression of most other genes is inhibited as a result of stress. This rapid genetic response of the cell is an excellent model for the study of regulatory mechanisms of gene expression. We described here, molecular events associated with the response of Tetrahymena pyriformis to stressful conditions. Results are presented from the analysis of proteins synthesized by Tetrahymena pyriformis cells exposed to several stress conditions, namely, heat shock (H S), <b>sodium</b> meta <b>arsenite</b> (As), hydrogen peroxide, release from anoxia, ethanol and canavanine. A set of proteins is shared by the responses to all conditions examined: HSPs from the two main groups of 70 - 75 kDa and 25 - 29 kDa, Hsp 92, Hsp 58, two Hsps 45, one Hsp 42 (acidic) and Hsp 35. Other HSPs are only observed under one or some of the stress conditions examined. Normal protein synthesis is also differently blocked, being the most drastic inhibitions observed under Hs, ethanol and canavanine. Molecular oxygen does not provoke synthesis of HSPs in Tetrahymena pyriformis, whereas puromycin is a strong inducer, as seen by the high levels of the Hsp 70 mRNA under exposure to this inhibitor. Normal proteins patterns are re-established shortly after exposure of cells to either Hs or As, but the same does not occur during recovery from canavanine treatments. Induction of HSPs by Hs takes less than 3 min and lasts c. a., 1 h for most of them, being just a few synthesized afterwards. Stability of HSPs under Hs is estimated to be of at least 2 h. In vitro translation of mRNAs isolated from heat-shocked cells suggest that the stress response is mainly exerted at the transcriptional level for HSPs in the 70 - 75 kDa group, but they also show that mRNAs coding for the 25 - 29 kDa HSPs are already present in control cells [...] Available from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.

Total protein concentration was determined using Micro BCA™ Protein Assay (ThermoFisher Scientific, Massachusetts, USA) and bovine albumin standard (ThermoFisher Scientific, Massachusetts, USA) based on the assay developed by (Bradford 1976).

The measurements were performed in duplicates at 30  °C on a Multiskan Ascent reader (Thermo Electro Corporation, Finland) using 96 -well plates and a final volume of 200 µL. Before adding the substrate (d-xylose or d-xylonate) to the reactions, the background formation of NADH was monitored and subtracted, if present.

The mice were treated with or without <b>sodium</b> <b>arsenite</b> and/or T. occidentalis and the effects were assessed in the bone marrow of mice using micronucleus assay. In addition, the effects on the activity of gammaglutamyl transferase (GGT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and certain heamatological parameters were also evaluated. Certain vitamins were extracted by chemical methods and their presence was detected using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in the leaf extract of T. occidentalis. The mice treated with <b>sodium</b> <b>arsenite</b> alone and those administered with <b>sodium</b> <b>arsenite</b> and T. occidentalis had micronucleated polychromatic erythrocyte (mPCEs) counts of 21. 00 ± 2. 00 and 12. 67 ± 2. 67 respectively. The ALP and GGT concentrations of the mice treated with T. occidentalis and <b>sodium</b> <b>arsenite</b> shows about two times decrease than those treated with <b>sodium</b> <b>arsenite</b> alone. Treatment of mice with <b>sodium</b> <b>arsenite</b> and/or T. occidentalis revealed varying degree of deviations in the mice haematologica...|$|E
