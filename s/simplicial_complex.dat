In 2013 Ciprian Manolescu posted a preprint on the ArXiv showing that there are manifolds in each dimension {{greater than or equal}} to 5, {{that are not}} homeomorphic to a <b>simplicial</b> <b>complex.</b>|$|E

A flag complex is {{an abstract}} <b>simplicial</b> <b>complex</b> that has no empty simplices; that is, it is a complex satisfying Gromov's no-Δ condition.|$|E
40|$|<b>Simplicial</b> <b>complexes</b> are {{generalized}} network structures able {{to encode}} interactions occurring between {{more than two}} nodes. <b>Simplicial</b> <b>complexes</b> describe a large variety of complex interacting systems ranging from brain networks, to social and collaboration networks. Here we characterize the structure of <b>simplicial</b> <b>complexes</b> using their generalized degrees that capture fundamental properties of one, two, three or more linked nodes. Moreover we introduce the configuration model and the canonical ensemble of <b>simplicial</b> <b>complexes,</b> enforcing respectively the sequence of generalized degrees of the nodes and the sequence of the expected generalized degrees of the nodes. We evaluate the entropy of these ensembles, finding the asymptotic expression {{for the number of}} <b>simplicial</b> <b>complexes</b> in the configuration model. We provide the algorithms for the construction of <b>simplicial</b> <b>complexes</b> belonging to the configuration model and the canonical ensemble of <b>simplicial</b> <b>complexes.</b> We give an expression for the structural cutoff of <b>simplicial</b> <b>complexes</b> that for <b>simplicial</b> <b>complexes</b> of dimension $d= 1 $ reduces to the structural cutoff of simple networks. Finally we provide a numerical analysis of the natural correlations emerging in the configuration model of <b>simplicial</b> <b>complexes</b> without structural cutoff.

40|$|The {{problem of}} finding a {{characterization}} of Cohen-Macaulay <b>simplicial</b> <b>complexes</b> has been studied intensively by many authors. There are several attempts at this problem available for some special classes of <b>simplicial</b> <b>complexes</b> satisfying some technical conditions.

In particular, we show that one possible generalization is satisfied for all shifted <b>simplicial</b> <b>complexes.</b> ...|$|R

25|$|An {{undirected graph}} {{can be seen}} as a <b>simplicial</b> <b>complex</b> {{consisting}} of 1-simplices (the edges) and 0-simplices (the vertices). As such, complexes are generalizations of graphs since they allow for higher-dimensional simplices.|$|E
40|$|As a {{generalization}} {{of the use}} of graphs to describe pairwise interactions, <b>simplicial</b> <b>complexes</b> can be used to model higher-order interactions between three or more objects in complex systems. There has been a recent surge in activity for the development of data analysis methods applicable to <b>simplicial</b> <b>complexes,</b> including techniques based on computational topology, higher-order random processes, generalized Cheeger inequalities, isoperimetric inequalities, and spectral methods. In particular, spectral learning methods (e. g. label propagation and clustering) that directly operate on <b>simplicial</b> <b>complexes</b> represent a new direction emerging from the confluence of computational topology and machine learning. Similar to the challenges faced by massive graphs, computational methods that process <b>simplicial</b> <b>complexes</b> are severely limited by computational costs associated with massive datasets. To apply spectral methods in learning to massive datasets modeled as <b>simplicial</b> <b>complexes,</b> we work towards the sparsification of <b>simplicial</b> <b>complexes</b> based on preserving the spectrum of the associated Laplacian operators. We show that the theory of Spielman and Srivastava for the sparsification of graphs extends to <b>simplicial</b> <b>complexes</b> via the up Laplacian. In particular, we introduce a generalized effective resistance for simplexes; provide an algorithm for sparsifying <b>simplicial</b> <b>complexes</b> at a fixed dimension; and give a specific version of the generalized Cheeger inequality for weighted <b>simplicial</b> <b>complexes.</b> Finally, we demonstrate via experiments the preservation of the up Laplacian during sparsification, as well as the utility of sparsification with respect to spectral clustering...|$|R
40|$|<b>Simplicial</b> <b>complexes</b> {{describe}} collaboration networks, protein interaction {{networks and}} brain networks {{and in general}} network structures in which the interactions can include more than two nodes. In real applications, often <b>simplicial</b> <b>complexes</b> are weighted.

25|$|The clique complex X(G) of an {{undirected graph}} G is an {{abstract}} <b>simplicial</b> <b>complex</b> (that is, {{a family of}} finite sets closed under the operation of taking subsets), formed by the sets of vertices in the cliques of G. Any subset of a clique is itself a clique, so this family of sets meets the requirement of an abstract <b>simplicial</b> <b>complex</b> that every subset of a set in the family should also be in the family. The clique complex can also {{be viewed as a}} topological space in which each clique of k vertices is represented by a simplex of dimension k1. The 1-skeleton of X(G) (also known as the underlying graph of the complex) is an undirected graph with a vertex for every 1-element set in the family and an edge for every 2-element set in the family; it is isomorphic toG.|$|E
25|$|Every {{complex of}} groups on X is {{associated}} with an essentially unique orbihedron structure on X. This key fact follows by noting that the star and link of a vertex i of X ', corresponding to a simplex σ of X, have natural decompositions: the star is isomorphic to the abstract <b>simplicial</b> <b>complex</b> given by the join of σ and the barycentric subdivision σ' of σ; and the link is isomorphic to join of the link of σ in X and the link of the barycentre of σ in σ'. Restricting the complex of groups to the link of σ in X, all the groups Γτ come with injective homomorphisms into Γσ. Since the link of i in X ' is canonically covered by a <b>simplicial</b> <b>complex</b> on which Γσ acts, this defines an orbihedron structure on X.|$|E
25|$|Two major ways {{in which}} {{this can be done}} are through {{fundamental}} groups, or more generally homotopy theory, and through homology and cohomology groups. The fundamental groups give us basic information about the structure of a topological space, but they are often nonabelian and can be difficult to work with.

25|$|In 1957, Jacques Tits {{introduced}} {{the theory of}} buildings, which relate algebraic groups to abstract simplicial complexes. One of the assumptions is a non-triviality condition: If the building is an n-dimensional abstract <b>simplicial</b> <b>complex,</b> and if , then every k-simplex of the building must be contained {{in at least three}} n-simplices. This is analogous to the condition in classical projective geometry that a line must contain at least three points. However, there are degenerate geometries which satisfy all the conditions to be a projective geometry except that the lines admit only two points. The analogous objects in the theory of buildings are called apartments. Apartments play such a constituent role in the theory of buildings that Tits conjectured the existence of a theory of projective geometry in which the degenerate geometries would have equal standing with the classical ones. This geometry would take place, he said, over a field of characteristic one. Using this analogy it was possible to describe some of the elementary properties of F1, but {{it was not possible to}} construct it.|$|E
