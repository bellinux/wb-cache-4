The analyses, which assumes {{there are no}} atmospheric effects, and otherwise simulates the response of a multispectral scanner, is based upon spectra taken continuously in wavelength from 0. 45 to 2. 4 micrometers at more than 1200 view/illumination directions using an Exotech model 20 C spectra radiometer. Data were acquired six meters above four wheat canopies, each at a different growth stage.

50|$|Twilight {{is defined}} {{according}} to the <b>solar</b> <b>elevation</b> angle θs, which is {{the position of the}} geometric center of the sun relative to the horizon.

50|$|For {{practical}} purposes, a time-average of {{the direct}} insolation {{over the course of}} the year is commonly used.

40|$|Recent {{research}} has focused on the different types of compass cues available to ball-rolling beetles for orientation, but {{little is known about the}} relative precision of each of these cues and how they interact. In this study, we find that the absolute orientation error of the celestial compass of the day-active dung beetle Scarabaeus lamarcki doubles from 16 ° at <b>solar</b> <b>elevations</b> below 60 ° to an error of 29 ° at <b>solar</b> <b>elevations</b> above 75 °. As ball-rolling dung beetles rely solely on celestial compass cues for their orientation, these insects experience a large decrease in orientation precision towards the middle of the day. We also find that in the compass system of dung beetles, the solar cues and the skylight cues are used together and share the control of orientation behaviour. Finally, we demonstrate that the relative influence of the azimuthal position of the sun for straight-line orientation decreases as the sun draws closer to the horizon. In conclusion, ball-rolling dung beetles possess a dynamic celestial compass system in which the orientation precision and the relative influence of the solar compass cues change over the course of the day...|$|R

50|$|The solar zenith {{angle is}} the angle between the zenith and {{the centre of}} the Sun's disc. The <b>solar</b> <b>elevation</b> angle is the {{altitude}} of the Sun, the angle between the horizon and {{the centre of the}} Sun's disc.

While the solar irradiance above the atmosphere varies with the Earth-Sun distance and solar cycles, the losses depend on the time of day (length of light's path through the atmosphere depending on the <b>Solar</b> <b>elevation</b> angle), cloud cover, moisture content, and other impurities.|$|E
50|$|A total {{solar eclipse}} {{occurred}} on October 3, 1986. It was a hybrid event (normally, an eclipse which is annular {{for most of}} its duration, but with totality either at the beginning, end or at sometime during the eclipse) that did not officially satisfy the definition of totality. Totality occurred for a very short time (calculated at 0.2 seconds) in an area in the Atlantic Ocean, just east of the southern tip of Greenland.

50|$|On Earth, the {{elevations}} {{can take}} on either positive or negative (below sea level) values, and are bimodal due to {{the contrast between the}} continents and oceans.

40|$|A simple {{model for}} {{upwelling}} irradiance has been developed. The model represents {{the relationship between}} Photosynthetically Active Radiation diffuse attenuation coefficients and Secchi disk depth described with a physical-mathematical expression.

50|$|Direct {{insolation}} {{is measured}} {{at a given}} location with a surface element perpendicular to the Sun. It excludes diffuse insolation (radiation that is scattered or reflected by atmospheric components). Direct insolation {{is equal to the}} irradiance above the atmosphere minus the atmospheric losses due to absorption and scattering. While the irradiance above the atmosphere varies with time of year (because the distance to the sun varies), losses depend on time of day (length of light's path through the atmosphere depending on the <b>Solar</b> <b>elevation</b> angle), Cloud cover, Moisture content and other contents. (See values for direct and total insolation further down.) Insolation affects plant metabolism and animal behavior.|$|E
50|$|Insolation is {{a measure}} of solar {{radiation}} energy received on a given surface area in a given time. It is commonly expressed as average irradiance in watts per square meter (W/m2). Direct insolation is the solar irradiance measured at a given location on Earth with a surface element perpendicular to the Sun's rays, excluding diffuse insolation (the solar radiation that is scattered or reflected by atmospheric components in the sky). Direct insolation is equal to the solar constant minus the atmospheric losses due to absorption and scattering. While the solar constant varies with the Earth-Sun distance and solar cycles, the losses depend on the time of day (length of light's path through the atmosphere depending on the <b>Solar</b> <b>elevation</b> angle), cloud cover, moisture content, and other impurities.|$|E
50|$|The {{solar azimuth}} angle is the azimuth angle of the sun. It defines in which {{direction}} the sun is, whereas the solar zenith angle or its complementary angle <b>solar</b> <b>elevation</b> defines how high the sun is. There are several conventions for the solar azimuth, however it is traditionally defined as the angle between a line due south and the shadow cast by a vertical rod on Earth. This convention states the angle is positive if the line is east of south and negative if it is west of south. For example, due east would be 90° and due west would be -90°. Another convention is the reverse; {{it also has the}} origin at due south, but measures angles clockwise, so that due east is now negative and west now positive.|$|E

The effect is quantified in terms of AOD and solar zenith angle using radiative transfer modeling. The analysis is based on aerosol size distributions derived from multi-year climatologies of AERONET aerosol retrievals. The study shows that the modeled error is lower than AOD calibration uncertainty (0. 01) {{for the vast majority of}} AERONET level 2 observations, ~ 99. 53 %. Only ~ 0. 47 % of the AERONET database corresponding mostly to dust aerosol with high AOD and low <b>solar</b> <b>elevations</b> has larger biases. We also show that observations with extreme reductions in direct solar irradiance do not contribute to level 2 AOD due to low Sun photometer digital counts below a quality control cutoff threshold...|$|R
50|$|During December to March, {{the lake}} {{turns to a}} vibrant cobalt blue colour, {{returning}} to a colder steel grey colour for April to November. The exact cause of this phenomenon is still a matter of conjecture, but it is generally considered likely that it revolves around the warming of the surface layers of the lake {{during the summer months}} to around 20 C, causing calcium carbonate to precipitate out of solution and enabling micro-crystallites of calcium carbonate to form. This results in scatter of the blue wavelengths of sunlight. During winter the lake becomes well mixed, and recent research indicates that during this phase of the colour cycle the lake is somewhat murkier due to the redistribution of tannins and calcium carbonate particles throughout the lake. <b>Solar</b> <b>elevation</b> has also been found to influence the perceived colour of the lake. The movement of planktonic life-forms within the lake during the seasons and during the day may additionally play a part in the colour change.|$|E

It is concluded that additional variations in ratios can be expected for Landsat data owing to sensor calibration and quantization...|$|R
40|$|Low <b>solar</b> <b>elevations</b> at {{high latitudes}} result in two {{phenomena}} {{that affect the}} quantity and quality of light entering the sea. High surface reflectances ignificantly reduce the direct solar irradiance and, to a lesser extent, the global irradiance. Furthermore, there is an apparent spectral shift such that proportionately more blue (diffuse) light is transmitted and more red (direct) light is reflected by the sea surface. A model of photosynthetically available radiation (PAR} has been used to quantify these effects. The model was developed to predict daily broadband (400 - 700 nm) photon flux as a function of latitude and time of year for varying cloud-free atmospheric conditions. Seasonal and spectral variability of the surface albedo is described at latitudes between 40 ” and 7 O”N. Ranges arc established for surface albedo which encompass variability due to atmospheric turbidity and wind-induced surface waves. Light availability is an important limiting factor in oceanic primary production at high latitudes (Steemann Nielsen 1974). Polar and subpolar regions experience muc...|$|R

40|$|The {{combined}} {{effects of}} ozone depletions/redistributions and particulate clouds on atmospheric cheating/photolysis rates and UV radiation reaching the biosphere are investigated {{by means of}} an atmospheric radiation model. Consideration is given to four types of particulate clouds prevalent in the summertime Arctic: stratospheric aerosols, tropospheric aerosols (Arctic haze), cirrus clouds, and stratus clouds. The effects of ozone depletion and vertical redistributions of ozone are also examined. Stratus clouds are found to provide significant protection from UV radiation exposure, but while stratospheric aerosols imply increased UVB exposure, Arctic haze results in a decrease. A redistribution of ozone from the stratosphere to the troposphere tends to decrease UV exposure, but for low <b>solar</b> <b>elevations</b> an increase may occur.
