40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of an {{investigation}} of the stability of a selection of small industrial platinum <b>resistance</b> <b>thermometers</b> (IPRTs) upon heat treatment and handling. Ninety-four IPRTs, of several models, obtained from five manufacturers were studied. Most of the IPRTs exhibited calibration drifts and also effects due to the presence of moisture or strain. There was no apparent improvement in the stability if the resistance ratio, R(t) /Ro = W(t), instead of resistance were used as the criterion. Comparisons are made of the relative stability of the products of the five companies.

40|$|Abstract- Resistance bridges, {{when used}} for {{temperature}} measurements with SPRTs, {{are able to}} achieve uncertainties better than 1 ppm. However, they have several shortcomings that prohibit their use in many applications. Among these are cost, size, slow speed, and limited range. An endeavor {{was made by the}} author to design a readout for <b>resistance</b> <b>thermometers</b> that achieves less than 1 ppm uncertainty in resistance ratio while overcoming some of the problems of resistance bridges. A new approach was taken with a design that uses the latest integrated-circuit analog-to-digital converters. This allows the instrument to have lower cost, smaller size, the capability of increased speed, and additional features. Special effort was made to reduce errors caused by component drift, thermoelectric EMF, component offset, electrical noise, and nonlinearity. The new <b>resistance</b> <b>thermometer</b> readout was tested to identify and evaluate sources of measurement uncertainty. The combined uncertainty was calculated for resistance ratio and W(T 90) measurements of an SPRT with self-heating corrections. Measurements made with the <b>resistance</b> <b>thermometer</b> readout were compared with measurements made with a resistance bridge. The results show that the standard uncertainty of the new <b>resistance</b> <b>thermometer</b> readout is about 0. 34 · 10 - 6 in measuring resistance ratio at 25 Ω/ 100 Ω and about 0. 68 · 10 - 6 in measuring W(T 90) near the triple point of water...|$|R
