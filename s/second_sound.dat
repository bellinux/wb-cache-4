It was Lang's <b>second</b> <b>sound</b> film for Nero-Film and was his final collaboration {{with his wife and}} screenwriter Thea von Harbou. To promote the film to a foreign market, a French-language version of the film was made by Lang with the same sets but different actors with the title Le Testament du Dr. Mabuse.|$|E
5|$|The thermal {{conductivity}} of heliumII {{is greater than}} that of any other known substance, a million times that of heliumI and several hundred times that of copper. This is because heat conduction occurs by an exceptional quantum mechanism. Most materials that conduct heat well have a valence band of free electrons which serve to transfer the heat. HeliumII has no such valence band but nevertheless conducts heat well. The flow of heat is governed by equations that are similar to the wave equation used to characterize sound propagation in air. When heat is introduced, it moves at 20 meters per second at 1.8K through heliumII as waves in a phenomenon known as <b>second</b> <b>sound.</b>|$|E

25|$|In 1931, José A. Ferreyra {{directed}} Muñequitas porteñas, {{the first}} Argentine film {{to be made}} with Vitaphone sound synchronisation. That year, Ferreyra made a <b>second</b> <b>sound</b> film, El Cantar de mi ciudad, encouraging other early directors {{to make the transition}} to sound.|$|E
25|$|Active noise control, {{also known}} as noise cancellation, is a method for {{reducing}} unwanted sound through {{the addition of a}} <b>second</b> <b>sound</b> specifically designed to cancel the first. Active noise cancelling headphones were invented by Lawrence J. Fogel, an aerospace engineer working to improve communication in helicopter cockpits, with a patent filed April 2, 1954. His research led to the first five patents in noise cancellation for headphones between 1954-1961.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} Middle Ages, the West Germanic {{languages}} {{were separated by}} the insular development of Middle English {{on one hand and}} by the High German consonant shift on the continent on the other, resulting in Upper German and Low Saxon, with graded intermediate Central German varieties. By early modern times, the span had extended into considerable differences, ranging from Highest Alemannic in the South to Northern Low Saxon in the North, and, although both extremes are considered German, they are hardly mutually intelligible. The southernmost varieties had completed the <b>second</b> <b>sound</b> shift, while the northern varieties remained unaffected by the consonant shift.|$|E

40|$|An {{algorithm}} is proposed {{for the detection of}} first and <b>second</b> heart <b>sound</b> in this Bachelor’s thesis. The first part describes the anatomy of heart, the activity of heart and creation of PCG signal. Next, typical characteristics of PCG signal are described in the thesis. Algorithm for the detection of first and <b>second</b> heart <b>sound</b> is based on the normalized average Shannon energy of PCG signal. The algorithm for the detection of first and <b>second</b> heart <b>sound</b> was implemented in MATLAB. The performance of the algorithm has been evaluated using 66 recordings of PCG signal with 1388 cycles...|$|R
25|$|In 1971 Konstantīns Raudive wrote Breakthrough, {{detailing}} what {{he believed}} was the discovery of electronic voice phenomena (EVP). EVP {{has been described as}} auditory pareidolia. Allegations of backmasking in popular music, in which a listener claims a message has been recorded backward onto a track meant to be played forward, have also been described as auditory pareidolia. In 1995, the psychologist Diana Deutsch invented an algorithm for producing phantom words and phrases with the sounds coming from two stereo loudspeakers, with one to the listener's left and the other to his right. Each loudspeaker produces a phrase consisting of two words or syllables. The same sequence is presented repeatedly through both loudspeakers; however, they are offset in time so that one when the first sound (word or syllable) is coming from the speaker on the left, the <b>second</b> <b>sound</b> is coming from the speaker on the right, and vice versa. After listening for a while, phantom words and phrases suddenly emerge, and these often appear to reflect what is on the listener's mind, and they transform perceptually into different words and phrases as the sequence continues.|$|E
500|$|Bence's {{first film}} role was {{as an extra}} in a scene with Pedro Quartucci in Argentina's <b>second</b> <b>sound</b> film, Dancing (1933), under the {{direction}} of Luis José Moglia Barth, who bestowed the stage name [...] "Amelia Bence" [...] on her. The film was a failure and did not have the same success as the first sound film ¡Tango!.|$|E
500|$|Born to Belarusian Jewish immigrants, Bence {{began her}} career {{at a young}} age, {{studying}} with Alfonsina Storni at the Lavardén Children's Theater and with Mecha Quintana at the Conservatorio Nacional de Música y Declamación (National Conservatory of Music and Speech). She made her film debut in 1933, in only the <b>second</b> <b>sound</b> film of Argentina, Dancing, by Luis Moglia Barth. Bence's acting in La guerra gaucha (1942), {{one of the most}} important films in the history of Argentine cinema, gave her recognition and earned her leading role offers. She starred in films such as Los ojos más lindos del mundo (1943), Todo un hombre, Camino del infierno (1946), A sangre fría (1947), La otra y yo (1949) and [...] Danza del fuego (1949), garnering the Best Actress award from the Argentine Academy of Cinematography Arts and Sciences for Todo un hombre, A sangre fría and Danza del fuego. Bence also won the Silver Condor Award for Best Actress for Lauracha (1946), and her work was acknowledged with awards in Spain, Cuba, and the US throughout the 1940s and 1950s.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{denoising}} and segmentation technique for the <b>second</b> heart <b>sound</b> (S 2). To denoise, Matching Pursuit (MP) was applied using {{a set of}} non-linear chirp signals as atoms. We show that the proposed method {{can be used to}} segment the phonocardiogram of the <b>second</b> heart <b>sound</b> into its two clinically meaningful components: the aortic (A 2) and pulmonary (P 2) components...|$|R
50|$|The {{pulmonary}} valve (sometimes {{referred to}} as the pulmonic valve) lies between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery, and has three cusps. Similar to the aortic valve, the pulmonary valve opens in ventricular systole, when the pressure in the right ventricle rises above the pressure in the pulmonary artery. At the end of ventricular systole, when the pressure in the right ventricle falls rapidly, the pressure in the pulmonary artery will close the pulmonary valve. The closure of the pulmonary valve contributes the P2 component of the <b>second</b> heart <b>sound.</b> The right heart is a low-pressure system, so the P2 component of the <b>second</b> heart <b>sound</b> is usually softer than the A2 component of the <b>second</b> heart <b>sound.</b> However, it is physiologically normal in some young people to hear both components separated during inhalation.|$|R
2500|$|The older {{versions}} of the Albanian alphabet differentiated between two h sounds, one for [...] one for the Voiceless velar fricative [...] The <b>second</b> <b>sound</b> was written as h, kh, ch, and Greek khi χ.|$|E
2500|$|In both cases, the {{distinction}} mainly concerns simultaneous sounds; if successive sounds are considered, their consonance or dissonance {{depends on the}} memorial retention of the first sound while the <b>second</b> <b>sound</b> (or pitch) is heard. For this reason, consonance and dissonance have been considered {{particularly in the case}} of Western polyphonic music, and the present article is concerned mainly with this case. Most historical definitions of consonance and dissonance since about the 16th century have stressed their pleasant/unpleasant, or agreeable/disagreeable character. This may be justifiable in a psychophysiological context, but much less in a musical context properly speaking: dissonances often play a decisive role in making music pleasant, even in a generally consonant context—which {{is one of the reasons}} why the musical definition of consonance/dissonance cannot match the psychophysiologic definition. In addition, the oppositions pleasant/unpleasant or agreeable/disagreeable evidence a confusion between the concepts of [...] "dissonance" [...] and of [...] "noise".

2500|$|According to Christian, the Millennium Falcon set was {{the most}} {{difficult}} to build. Christian wanted the interior of the Falcon to look like that of a submarine. He found scrap airplane metal [...] "that no one wanted in those days and bought them". He began his creation process by breaking down jet engines into scrap pieces, giving him the chance to [...] "stick it in the sets in specific ways". It took him several weeks to finish the chess set (which he described as [...] "the most encrusted set") in the hold of the Falcon. The garbage compactor set [...] "was also pretty hard, because I knew I had actors in there and the walls had to come in, and they had to be in dirty water and I had to get stuff that would be light enough so it wouldn't hurt them but also not bobbing around". A total of 30 sets consisting of planets, starships, caves, control rooms, cantinas, and the Death Star corridors were created; all of the nine sound stages at Elstree were used to accommodate them. The massive rebel hangar set was housed at a <b>second</b> <b>sound</b> stage at Shepperton Studios; the stage was the largest in Europe at the time.|$|E

60|$|Fanny {{had indeed}} nothing to convey from aunt Norris, but {{a message to}} say she hoped that her god-daughter was a good girl, and learnt her book.

Mrs. Norris, however, had gone home and taken down two old prayer-books of her husband with that idea; but, upon examination, the ardour of {{generosity}} went off. One was found to have too small a print for a child's eyes, and the other to be too cumbersome for her to carry about.|$|E

I know now the feeling of tense expectation with which the driven grouse whirrs onwards towards the butt. I have been behind the butt before now, and it is only poetic justice that I should see the matter from the other point of view. As we approached Ronchi we could see shrapnel breaking over the road in front of us, but we had not yet realised that it was precisely for vehicles that the Austrians were waiting, and that they had the range marked out to a yard. We went down the road all out at a steady fifty miles an hour. The village was near, and it seemed that we had got past the place of danger. We had in fact just reached it. At this moment there was a noise as if the whole four tyres had gone simultaneously, a most terrific bang in our very ears, merging into a <b>second</b> <b>sound</b> like a reverberating blow upon an enormous gong. As I glanced up I saw three clouds immediately above my head, two of them white and the other of a rusty red. The air was full of flying metal, and the road, as we were told afterwards by an observer, was all churned up by it. The metal base of one of the shells was found plumb {{in the middle of the}} road just where our motor had been. There is no use telling me Austrian gunners can't shoot. I know better.|$|E
