5000|$|Hollows may form as {{the result}} of {{physiological}} stress from natural forces causing the excavating and exposure of the heartwood. Forces including wind, fire, heat, lightning, rain, attack from insects (such as ants( [...] or beetles), bacteria, or fungi. Also, trees may <b>self-prune,</b> dropping lower branches as they reach maturity, exposing the area where the branch was attached. Many animals further develop the hollows using instruments such as their beak, teeth or claws.|$|R
50|$|If {{space is}} not a constraint, no pruning is {{necessary}} except to remove any dead branches. Trees naturally <b>self-prune</b> foliage that doesn't receive enough light, such as internal branches which are overly shaded by its own canopy. Some growers prefer to shape their trees artistically or to thin out interior branches to better expose the graceful main branches. The form of the tree, especially without leaves in winter, can be of great interest and can be pruned to highlight this feature. Trees heal readily after pruning without needing aftercare. This species should not be pruned like a hedge, but instead methodically shaped by carefully choosing individual branches to remove. They can also be pruned just to maintain a smaller size to suit a particular location. Acer palmatum {{can also be used}} as espalier.|$|R
5000|$|Pruning, as a {{silvicultural}} practice, {{refers to}} {{the removal of the}} lower branches of the young trees (also giving the shape to the tree) so clear knot-free wood can subsequently grow over the branch stubs. Clear knot-free lumber has a higher value. Pruning has been extensively carried out in the Radiata pine plantations of New Zealand and Chile, however the development of Finger joint technology in the production of lumber and mouldings has led to many forestry companies reconsidering their pruning practices. [...] "Brashing" [...] is an alternative name for the same process.Pruning can be done to all trees, or more cost effectively to a limited number of trees. There are two types of pruning: natural or <b>self-pruning</b> and artificial pruning. Most cases of <b>self-pruning</b> happen when branches do not receive enough sunlight and die. Wind can also take part in natural pruning which can break branches. Artificial pruning is where people are paid to come and cut the branches. Or it can be natural, where trees are planted close enough that the effect is to cause <b>self-pruning</b> of low branches as energy is put into growing up for light reasons and not branchiness.|$|E
50|$|By only using MPRs {{to flood}} {{topology}} information, OLSR removes {{some of the}} redundancy of the flooding process, which may {{be a problem in}} networks with moderate to large packet loss rates - however the MPR mechanism is <b>self-pruning</b> (which means that in case of packet losses, some nodes that would not have retransmitted a packet, may do so).|$|E
50|$|In forest conditions, old {{individuals}} {{typically have}} a narrow, cylindric crown beginning 20 - 40 m above a branch-free trunk. <b>Self-pruning</b> is generally slow and trees retain their lower limbs {{for a long}} period.

30|$|Regardless of {{when the}} optimum habitat {{conditions}} are reached, snowshoe hares’ association with regenerating lodgepole pine forests is transient. As lodgepole pine forests mature, the trees <b>self-prune</b> their lower branches, creating a more open understory. Thus, the distribution of snowshoe hares in Glacier NP will change over time, particularly with the changing mosaic of post-fire succession on the park’s west side. We expect regenerating forests of the 1988 Red Bench Fire to continue supporting moderate hare densities and lynx {{over the next few}} decades at least. As regenerating forests from the park’s 2003 fires (which burned 40 times more area than the 1998 Red Bench Fire) mature to stages favorable for hares and lynx over the next several decades, Glacier NP may observe a further shift in distribution of its hare and lynx populations to take advantage of transiently favorable food and cover conditions.|$|R

50|$|It is {{irregular}} in shape, branches {{are usually}} twisted {{and it does}} a poor job at <b>self-pruning.</b> The needles are in fascicles of three, about 6 - 13 cm in length, and are stout (over 1 mm broad) and often slightly twisted. The cones are 4 - 7 cm long and oval with prickles on the scales. Trunks are usually straight with a slight curve to them, they are covered in irregular, thick, large plates of bark. Pitch pine has an exceptionally high regenerative ability; if the main trunk is cut or damaged by fire it can re-sprout using epicormic shoots. This {{is one of its}} many adaptations to fire, which also includes a thick bark to protect the sensitive cambium layer from heat. Burnt trees often form stunted, twisted trees with multiple trunks {{as a result of the}} resprouting. This characteristic also makes it a popular species for bonsai.|$|E
50|$|Over-crowded {{regeneration}} {{tends to}} stagnate. The problem is aggravated in species that have little <b>self-pruning</b> ability, such as white spruce. Spacing is a thinning (of natural regeneration), {{in which all}} trees other than those selected for retention at fixed intervals are cut. The term juvenile spacing is used when {{most or all of}} the cut trees are unmerchantable. Spacing can be used to obtain any {{of a wide range of}} forest management objectives, but it is especially undertaken to reduce density and control stocking in young stands and prevent stagnation, and to shorten the rotation, i.e., to speed the production of trees of a given size. Volume growth of individual trees and the merchantable growth of stands are increased. The primary rationale for spacing is that thinning is the projected decline in maximum allowable cut. And since wood will be concentrated on fewer, larger, and more uniform stems, operating and milling costs will be minimized.|$|E

Approximate inference by variational free energy minimization (also known as variational Bayes, or ensemble learning, or learning with noisy weights – see (MacKay 1995) for a review) has maximum likelihood and maximum a posteriori methods as special cases, so we might hope that it can only work better than these standard methods. However, cases have been found in which degrees of freedom are ‘pruned’, perhaps inappropriately. This paper investigates this phenomenon in a toy example. Motivations for VFE: want to incorporate uncertainty about parameters into the modelfitting process. Also worried about the electric monastry – location in parameter space where the likelihood diverges. Uncertainty is greatest (and singularities in the likelihood more prominent) when there is little data, so VFE is of most interest for small N. Problem observed by Zoubin Ghahramani (studying ensemble learning for HMMs (MacKay 1997)) : extra degrees of freedom are not used. The model <b>self-prunes.</b> Annoying because we don’t want the pruned model, we want the model we believe in – with lots of parameters, and big error bars on them! Parameter pruning is bad news because we would like predictions to take into accoutn uncertainty. Comment on spontaneous pruning: is sometimes viewed as a convenient automatic Occam’s razor, but does it behave correctly? Occam effect should be very weak for small N. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — <b>Self-pruning</b> is an {{effective}} method to reduce broadcast redundancy in ad hoc wireless networks. Unlike flooding, in a <b>self-pruning</b> broadcast protocol, a node may not forward a broadcast packet if a certain <b>self-pruning</b> condition is satisfied based on the neighborhood information. For each broadcasting, only a subset of nodes forward the broadcast packet and still guarantee the complete network delivery under the ideal network situation that no packet is lost due to packet collision and node mobility. We evaluate {{the performance of the}} family of <b>self-pruning</b> protocols under various network situations with ¢¡¤ £. The objective is to observe the efficiency and reliability of these protocols as a function of network density, congestion, and mobility, and provide a guideline of implementation in the “real world”. Our performance analysis reveals that the protocol reliability is barely affected by packet collision. However, most <b>self-pruning</b> protocols suffer from low delivery ratio in highly mobile networks. We further explore various techniques that improve the delivery ratio and show that both high efficiency and reliability can be achieved in highly mobile networks. I...|$|E
40|$|In ad hoc {{wireless}} networks, {{a successful}} broadcasting {{requires that the}} nodes forwarding the broadcast packet form a connected dominating set to ensure the coverage.

A generic broadcast protocol based on a simple <b>self-pruning</b> rule is proposed in this paper. The underlying local information, including the network information collected via exchanging “hello” messages and the broadcast history information carried by incoming broadcast packets, is discussed and formally defined. Most existing <b>self-pruning</b> protocols are shown to be special cases of the <b>self-pruning</b> rule.

40|$|Abstract. An {{important}} question in multi-radio multi-channel and multi-hop networks {{is how to}} perform efficient network-wide broadcast. Currently almost all broadcasting protocols assume a single-radio single-channel network model. Simply using them in multi-channel environment without careful enhancement will result in unnecessary redundancy. In this paper, we focus on {{reducing the amount of}} redundant traffic of broadcasting under multi-channel environment. We propose a general model for broadcasting and reduce the efficient broadcast problem into the minimal strong connected dominating set problem of the interface-extend graph which extends the original network topology across interfaces. Using interface-extend graph, we describe our Multi-Channel <b>Self-Pruning</b> broadcast protocol and simulation shows that our protocol can significantly reduce the transmission cost. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first <b>self-pruning</b> broadcast scheme in this area. ...|$|E
30|$|The {{construction}} of the multicast-tree can also occur at run-time (<b>self-pruning).</b> In these Neighbour Elimination schemes, each node removes itself from the multicast tree by not retransmitting if all its neighbours are already covered by the retransmission {{of one of its}} neighbours. The rebroadcast list at each node is pruned based on its neighbours that were covered by previous transmissions. For example, the Scalable Broadcasting Algorithm (SBA) [12] performs <b>self-pruning</b> at each node receiving a new broadcast message by comparing the sender’s neighbours with those of the receiver. Two-hop neighbourhood discovery is periodically undertaken by the exchange of two-hop Hello messages between all peer nodes. Using SBA, a node’s retransmission is cancelled if a neighbour’s retransmission achieves the same node coverage. This scheme is further improved by the RNG Relay Subset (RRS) protocol [18] which reduces the set of monitored neighbours and thus the quantity of redundant transmissions.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We {{propose a}} general {{framework}} for broadcasting in ad hoc networks through <b>self-pruning.</b> The approach {{is based on}} selecting a small subset of hosts (also called nodes) to form a forward node set {{to carry out a}} broadcast process. Each node, upon receiving a broadcast packet, determines whether to forward the packet based on two neighborhood coverage conditions proposed in this paper. These coverage conditions depend on neighbor connectivity and history of visited nodes, and in general, resort to global network information. Using local information such as k-hop neighborhood information, the forward node set is selected through a distributed and local pruning process. The forward node set can be constructed and maintained through either a proactive process (i. e., “up-to-date”) or a reactive process (i. e., “on-the-fly”). Several existing broadcast algorithms can be viewed as special cases of the coverage conditions with k-hop neighborhood information. Simulation results show that new algorithms, which are more efficient than existing ones, can be derived from the coverage conditions, and <b>self-pruning</b> based on 2 - or 3 -hop neighborhood information is relatively cost-effective.

In addition to this, it is also shown that Micro-Tom harbours at least two independently segregating resistance loci to the plant pathogen Cladosporium fulvum. The presence of the <b>self-pruning</b> mutation in Micro-Tom, that generates a determinate phenotype, was confirmed by crossing and sequence analysis. It was also found that Micro-Tom has a mutation in the DWARF gene (d) that leads to mis-splicing and pro-duction {{of at least two}} shorter mRNAs. The d mutation is predicted to generate truncated DWARF protein. The d sequence defect co-segregates with dark-green and rugose leaves, characteristics of brassinosteroid biosynthesis mutants. Micro-Tom also carries at least another mutation producing internode length reduction that affects plant height but not active gibberellin (GA) levels, which were similar in dwarf and tall Micro-Tom 3 Severianin segregants. GAs and brassinosteroids act synergistically in Micro-Tom, and the response to GA depends on brassinosteroids because the elongation of internodes was at least six times higher when GA 3 was applied simultaneously with brassinolide.
