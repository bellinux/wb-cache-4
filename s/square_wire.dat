40|$|The {{effect of}} {{geometrical}} confinement, atomic position and orientation of Silicon nanowires (SiNWs) on their thermal properties are investigated using the phonon dispersion obtained using a Modified Valence Force Field (MVFF) model. The specific heat (C_v) and the ballistic thermal conductance (Îº^bal_l) shows anisotropic variation with changing cross-section {{shape and size}} of the SiNWs. The C_v increases with decreasing cross-section size for all the wires. The triangular wires show the largest C_v due to their highest surface-to-volume ratio. The <b>square</b> <b>wires</b> with [110] orientation show the maximum Îº^bal_l since they have the highest number of conducting phonon modes. At the nano-scale a universal scaling law for both C_v and Îº^bal_l are obtained with respect to the number of atoms in the unit cell. This scaling is independent of the shape, size and orientation of the SiNWs revealing a direct correlation of the lattice thermal properties to the atomistic properties of the nanowires. Thus, engineering the SiNW cross-section shape, size and orientation open up new ways of tuning the thermal properties at the nanometer regime. Comment: 11 figures, 4 tables, submitted to JA...|$|R

40|$|Abstract â€” Ultra-cold atoms can be {{manipulated}} using microfabricated devices known as atom chips. These have significant potential for applications in sensing, metrology and quantum information processing. To date, the chips are loaded by transfer of atoms from an external, macroscopic magneto-optical trap (MOT) into microscopic traps on the chip. This transfer involves a series of steps, which complicate the experimental procedure and lead to atom losses. In this paper we present a design for integrating a MOT into a silicon wafer by combining a concave pyramidal mirror with a <b>square</b> <b>wire</b> loop.

40|$|The {{cold high}} {{pressure}} densification technique (CHPD) was recently developed in Geneva {{for improving the}} in-field critical current density Jc of in situ binary and alloyed MgB 2 wires and tapes,. Jc of CHPD treated <b>square</b> <b>wires</b> alloyed with malic acid (C 4 H 6 O 5) was enhanced by a factor 2 at 10 T and 4. 2 K.

In particular, a deconvolution of the specific heat data was used to determine the distribution of Tc in the samples. We have found that the effect of the densification process on the electrical and transport properties is related to the improved grain connectivity and percolation. By combining the results arising from the analysis of the Tc distribution and those from resistivity measurements, it is concluded that the minimum superconducting volume fraction needed for the percolation of a superconducting path is strongly reduced in samples treated by CHPD...|$|R
40|$|The large {{aspect ratio}} of {{standard}} Bi,Pb(2223) tapes results in high losses in perpendicular ac field, {{at least an}} order of magnitude higher than the loss level acceptable for practical application. Previous investigations, including oxide barriers, resulted in a more than 10 fold increase in matrix resistivity, have resulted only moderate reduction of ac losses. In the present work, we seek to explore an alternative approach of loss reduction by reducing conductor aspect ratios, with unchanged sheath, and without barriers. <b>Square</b> <b>wires,</b> packed with 36 Bi,Pb(2223) filaments were deformed by 2 -axis rolling to a final width of 1 mm and then twisted at different pitch lengths.

AC loss measurements showed that the overall loss per Ampere-meter is reduced to less than a fifth compared to that of standard tapes in perpendicular field. In addition, it was also found that for a moderate twist pitch of 20 mm, the coupling field of the present wires at 50 Hz was more that 50 mT, while the peak frequency for the coupling current losses was markedly higher than 100 Hz, a remarkable result obtained without barriers...|$|R

In this paper the distribution of effective strains and longitudinal stresses during changes of the crosssection and twisting of the wires has been demonstrated.

40|$|This study {{documents}} the metal working technology employed at two major Iron Age archaeological sites in southern Africa. The research involved the description {{and analysis of}} two large metal working assemblages {{with a total of}} 2922 metal artefacts, fragments of ore, and slag, from the sites of Divuyu (6 th 8 th century AD) and Nqoma (7 th - 10 th century AD, with a later 17 th - 19 th century AD occupation) in the Tsodilo Hills, northwestern Botswana. This is the first systematic description and metallographic analysis of a large collection of Early Iron Age metal artefacts from southern Africa. The artefacts were small, mainly delicate items of copper and iron jewellery, and tools possibly used in their manufacture. They were classified, described, and sampled selectively for metallographic, petrographic, and chemical analysis. Seventy artefacts were studied in detail, from which the fabrication technology employed at these sites was reconstructed. During the Early Iron Age forging, and probably also smelting, of iron took place at both sites. The smelting products were inhomogeneous iron and steel, with typical fayalitic slag, characteristic of indigenous bloomery iron production. The forging was done in an oxidising hearth and the technique used was poor, with no deliberate control over carbon content, the mechanical properties of the steel, or heat treatment other than annealing. Fabrication involved hammering <b>square</b> <b>wire</b> and flat sheets, which were cut into strips for beads, clips, chains, and fibre-cored wound ornaments. Numerous finger rings were made from crude round iron wire. Copper was worked in the same way, generally leaving the metal in its annealed state. Significant chemical variation in the copper artefacts and iron slag inclusions indicated that diverse ore sources were involved. There were stylistic similarities between individual artefacts from the Tsodilo Hills and Early Iron Age material from the Upemba Depression in Zaire, as well as with a copper chain from Broederstroom in the Transvaal. Comparison of the fabrication technology with Later Iron Age material suggested that local indigenous iron and copper working technology has changed little since its introduction in southern Africa...|$|E

40|$|The {{critical}} current density, Jc, of in situ MgB 2 wires with C 4 H 6 O 5 (malic acid) has been strongly enhanced {{by means of}} Cold High Pressure Densification (CHPD) at pressures up to 2. 5 GPa prior to reaction. An increase in Jc by factors 2 and 8 was observed at 4. 2 and 20 K, regardless of the applied field. Densified wires were found to exhibit a higher homogeneity due to enhanced connectivity. In addition, a higher C content was found, {{as shown by the}} lattice parameter change, the decrease of Tc, the shift of the calorimetric Tc distribution and a reduced anisotropy in tapes obtained from the same wires. The higher C content in densified wires is responsible for the observed enhancement of Birr by more than 1 T, up to 11 T at 20 K.

40|$|Microwave {{tomography}} is {{a microwave}} imaging method {{in which the}} resolution is not limited by wavelength, but rather by measurement noise and modelling errors. Inversion algorithm is used for obtaining an image from the measured scattered waves. Performance improvement of the inversion algorithm is introduced by approximately modelled antennas as a point, line or plane source. Such modelling of antennas introduces modelling errors. Antenna array in the unshielded measurement chamber will pick up external interference, as well as backscattering of array's own radiation. Multipath occurring in measurement chamber has a large impact on the measurement performance. The wave propagated {{through the air and}} reflected from the chamber walls could mask a weaker wave scattered by the object under imaging. Also, a larger number of the antennas improves inversion and gives a more accurate image. This paper proposes a novel design of enclosed measurement antenna array for microwave tomography.
