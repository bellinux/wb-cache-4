Based {{on the existing}} theory of clamping with the conical sleeve, we design {{a new type of}} fixture in this paper. The outer cone of the fixture cling to the inner cone of the workpiece, it is sealed hermetically at the both ends. The head of the sleeve stretch out of a cylindrical boss, we can use the three-jaw chuck to position it on the machine tool. Also we use the <b>steady</b> <b>rest</b> to fix the end of the sleeve. The <b>steady</b> <b>rest</b> connect with the shell of a rotary joint. The end of the rotary joint screw with the sleeve, the other end of it is connected with a getter pump. It formatted a vacuum between the sleeve and the workpiece by the use of holes around the circumference of the sleeve.

40|$|Motivated by {{machining}} of thin-walled parts this dissertation {{investigates the}} modeling {{and control of}} dynamic systems, which feature finite-dimensional and distributed-parameter structures interacting with one another over time-varying contacts and time-delayed feedback. The research studies and creates methods for modeling and control of such systems and applies them to a proposed innovative use of industrial robot manipulators and end effectors {{to act as an}} active <b>steady</b> <b>rest</b> in the machining of thin-walled parts. On modeling the combined discrete-continuous structural and machine dynamics with time varying contacts, finite element method (FEM) is employed to discretize and extract dynamic modes of the continuous structure. The time delayed feedback in the machining process is approximated by the semi-discretization method, where only the delay part of the otherwise continuous-time system is approximated by discrete-time delays and proper sampling and holding functions. To enable digital control design, sampling and zero-order hold circuit modeling is applied to the actuators in conjunction with the semi-discretization for the delayed feedback. Followed by lifting technique on the periodic-varying system and order reduction, discrete-time control oriented models for the entire machining system with the actively controlled robots and end effectors are constructed. Linear optimal control and robust control are investigated and applied to the proposed robot assisted machining system models. In the linear quadratic state estimator feedback control, a new approach is proposed for the formulation of the cost function weighting matrices. The approach essentially places weighting on outputs and their derivatives since output has clear physical meaning in connection to the process performance. The optimal linear state estimators, aka Kalman filters, are designed taking an approach that exploits the dual properties between the linear optimal regulators and state estimators. In the robust control, parameters in the machining process, particularly the cutting stiffness that depends on the tool conditions and part material, are isolated as uncertainties in formulating the control oriented models for mu-synthesis based robust control design. The above control design methods are applied to the turning of a thin-walled circular wheel with the actively controlled robotic <b>steady</b> <b>rest.</b> The simulation results show that the feedback controlled robotic active <b>steady</b> <b>rest</b> not only can stabilize an otherwise unstable machining system, caused by the well-known machining chatter due to the delayed feedback, but also can improve the machined forms and precision. The increased stability margins with higher speeds and larger depths of cut than possible without the proposed approach suggest the potential of improving the productivity and quality in the machining of thin-walled parts with the proposed control methods for the robotic <b>steady</b> <b>rests...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Long {{workpieces}} {{often need}} to be supported in the middle, as cutting tools can push (bend) the work piece away from where the centers can support them, because cutting metal produces tremendous forces that tend to vibrate or even bend the workpiece. This extra support can be provided by a <b>steady</b> <b>rest</b> (also called a steady, a fixed <b>steady,</b> a center <b>rest,</b> or sometimes, confusingly, a center). It stands stationary from a rigid mounting on the bed, and it supports the workpiece at the rest's center, typically with three contact points 120° apart. A follower rest (also called a follower or a travelling steady) is similar, but it is mounted to the carriage rather than the bed, which means that as the tool bit moves, the follower rest [...] "follows along" [...] (because they are both rigidly connected to the same moving carriage).|$|R

40|$|Abstract: We {{demonstrate}} a photonic bistable spiking circuit with a graphene excitable laser for cascadable logic. This technology {{could be a}} potential candidate for applications in novel all-optical devices for information processing and computing. Photonic neuromorphic processing exploits the biophysics of neuronal computation algorithms [1] to provide {{a wide range of}} computing and signal processing applications by harnessing the high speed, high bandwidth, and low crosstalk available to photonic interconnects. This could potentially grant the capacity for complex, ultrafast categorization and decision-making [2]. Neuromorphic signal processing incorporates a sparse coding scheme called spiking. This hybrid analog and digital processing technique takes advantage of both the bandwidth efficiency of analog computation and the noise robustness of digital computation [3], making it attractive to information processing. We recently discovered [4][5] a close analogy between the dynamics of lasers and those of biological neurons, both of which can exhibit excitability [6]—systems that can be excited from their in a stable <b>steady</b> <b>rest</b> state to emit a spike by a super-threshold followed by a refractory period.

40|$|Purkinje fibers from dog hearts {{may have}} either a “high“ resting {{potential}} of about - 90 mV or a “low“ resting potential of about - 40 mV when immersed in low-Cl- solution containing 4 mM K+. Brief exposure of Purkinje fibers {{at the low}} level of resting potential to K+-free fluid causes further depolarization, and return to K+-containing solution elicits a transient hyperpolarization which reaches a peak within a few seconds and then declines within a few minutes. Repeating these changes in K+ concentration after clamping the membrane potential at its <b>steady</b> <b>resting</b> level in K+-containing fluid allows the changes in net membrane current presumably underlying the depolarization and transient hyperpolarization to be measured. Net inward current is recorded when the fiber is exposed to K+-free solution, and a transient net outward current arises when it is returned to K+-containing solution. The transient net outward current reflects a temporary increase in the rate of electrogenic Na+ extrusion caused by the rise in intracellular Na+ concentration that occurs while the sodium pump is slowed in K+-free fluid. Sodium extrusion remains enhanced, presumably until the internal Na+ concentration has been brought back to its resting level. The transient outward current is completely abolished by the cardiac steroid acetylstrophanthidin, and its amplitude is increased as the prior exposure to K+-free fluid is prolonged. The decay of the transient outward current and the decline in intracellular Na+ concentration both appear to follow first-order kinetics...|$|R
40|$|Scattered light {{intensity}} fluctuations (SLEF) (wbkh monitor spontaneous Ca 2 + {{release from the}} sarcoplasmic reticulum [SR]) and resting and twitch tension were measured during intervals after stimulation in rat and rabbit papillary muscles. For 1 to 5 seconds after stimulation of rat muscle bathed in 1. 5 mM [Ca 2 +] (Ca 0), twitch and resting tension are depressed and SLIF are transiently abolished. SLIF and resting tension then recover simultaneously and monotonicaQy but lag behind the restitution of twitch tension. In the absence of further stimulation, SLIF persist and the rested state twitch amplitude remains potentiated. When Ca, is increased above 2. 5 mM, the restitution of all parameters following stimulation is accelerated and becomes oscillatory; the lag of SLIF and resting tension restitution behind that of the twitch increases such that twitch amplitude increases, overshoots, and decreases to a nadir as SLIF and resting tension reach their initial maximum. In a given muscle, the maximum twitch amplitude occurs at approximately {{the same level of}} SLIF; when this level is exceeded, either transiently during monotonk or oscillatory recovery after stimulation in a given Ca,, or in the <b>steady</b> <b>rested</b> state by an increase in Ca 0, twitch tension decreases.

As in normal platelets, aggregation requires functional af 3, "activation " of af 3, and fibrinogen (fg) binding to amf 3.
