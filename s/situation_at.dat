5|$|In {{some ways}} the run-up to Plataea resembled that at the Battle of Marathon; there was a {{prolonged}} stalemate in which neither side risked attacking the other. The reasons for this stalemate were primarily tactical, and similar to the <b>situation</b> <b>at</b> Marathon; the Greek hoplites {{did not want to}} risk being outflanked by the Persian cavalry and the lightly armed Persian infantry could not hope to assault well-defended positions.|$|E
5|$|Phase 2: Khalid, {{aware of}} the <b>situation</b> <b>at</b> the wings, ordered the cavalry of the right wing to attack the {{northern}} flank of the Byzantine left wing while he with his mobile guard attacked the southern flank of the Byzantine left wing, while the Muslim right wing infantry attacked from the front. The three-pronged attack forced the Byzantine left wing to abandon the Muslim positions they had gained on, and Amr regained his lost ground and started reorganizing his corps for another round.|$|E

After a Texas pass was batted down, Mitchell ran to the left for a gain of two yards. On third down, Brown was pressured by the Virginia Tech defense and threw an interception to Virginia Tech's William Yarborough, who caught the ball at the Tech 31-yard line.|$|E

The 28th Regiment moved to the Simin Han-Lopare area on 5 May, while the 7th SS Division pursued the Partisans withdrawing south.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} reinforcements, the British {{attempted to}} make a surprise attack on Pontiac's encampment. But Pontiac was ready and waiting, and defeated them at the Battle of Bloody Run on July 31, 1763. Nevertheless, the <b>situation</b> <b>at</b> Fort Detroit remained a stalemate, and Pontiac's influence among his followers began to wane. Groups of Native Americans began to abandon the siege, some of them making peace with the British before departing. On October 31, 1763, finally convinced that the French in Illinois would not come to his aid at Detroit, Pontiac lifted the siege and removed to the Maumee River, where he continued his efforts to rally resistance against the British.|$|E

Shaughnessy inherited a difficult <b>situation</b> <b>at</b> Chicago, and for the most part, lacked good material. He did, however, inherit from Stagg at least one important recruit: inaugural Heisman Trophy winner and future Hall of Fame back Jay Berwanger, whom many Midwest pundits considered the best back of the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|Although very {{conveniently}} sited for passengers, Ramsgate Harbour station presented severe operating difficulties. Its <b>situation</b> <b>at</b> {{the end of}} a {{steep gradient}} in the tunnel meant there was the constant risk that an out-of-control train would run through the station onto the beach, as happened on 3August 1891 and 24March 1915. Cramped conditions allowed no room for station growth or improvement, and the small turntable meant larger engines could not be used, so heavier trains needed two engines to haul them up the tunnel's gradient. Additionally, by the 1920s the population of Ramsgate had almost doubled since the station had opened, making the freight facilities inadequate, with no room for expansion.|$|E
5|$|At 11:00 the {{security}} <b>situation</b> <b>at</b> the Air America compound was deteriorating as General Carey {{did not wish}} to risk his Marines by extending his perimeter to cover the Air America compound (LZ 40), so all Air America helicopters from this time operated out of the tennis courts in the DAO Annex (LZ 35). This move created fuel problems for Air America as they no longer had access to the fuel supplies in their compound and at least initially they were refused fuel by the ships of TF76. According to US Naval Archives, at 12:30 an Air America Bell 205 landed Air Vice Marshal Nguyễn Cao Kỳ, Madame Kỳ, Dorothy Martin (wife of Ambassador Martin) and others on the USS Denver; contemporary reports state and photos show that Marshal Kỳ piloted his own UH-1H Huey to the USS Midway.|$|E

5|$|At 21:21 the North Vietnamese {{resumed their}} {{artillery}} attack on Phou Pha Thi, followed by several infantry assaults by the VPA 766th Regiment, which prompted Sullivan {{to order the}} evacuation of six technicians by 08:15 the next morning, from a contingent of 19 U.S. personnel. Starting at 01:00 on 11March, the North Vietnamese moved into their assigned positions in order to launch their attack. About 02:00, a U.S. adviser at the airstrip reported to Secord and CIA officers at Udorn that he heard gunfire on top of Phou Pha Thi, and communication with U.S. technicians at Lima Site 85 was completely cut off. Afterwards, Secord briefed U.S. A-1 Skyraider pilots in Thailand on the <b>situation</b> <b>at</b> Lima Site 85, to familiarize them with friendly positions around the facility, so they could cover the evacuation of U.S. personnel and support the Hmong counterattack.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of the low}} wage at América Mineiro, he {{was forced}} to quit {{football}} to take various jobs as a labourer, a carpenter, and a worker in a sweet factory.

After three years of working in a factory, the 18-year-old decided to try his luck at football again by enrolling in the local club's youth academy. His time in the academy did not last long due to the worsening <b>situation</b> <b>at</b> home as a result of his mother's ill health; he returned to work in the sweet factory with little hope of resurrecting his football career.|$|E
5|$|Benchley {{filled in}} for P. G. Wodehouse at Vanity Fair at the {{beginning}} of 1916, reviewing theatre in New York. This inspired staff at the Tribune magazine to creativity for articles (such as arranging for the producers of The Thirteenth Chair to cast Benchley as a corpse), but the <b>situation</b> <b>at</b> the magazine deteriorated as the pacifist Benchley became unhappy with the Tribunes position on World War I, and the Tribune editors were unhappy with the evolving tone and irreverence of the magazine. In 1917, the Tribune shut down the magazine, and Benchley was out of work again. When a rumored opening for an editorial position at Vanity Fair fell through, Benchley decided he would continue freelancing, having {{made a name for himself}} at the magazine.|$|E
40|$|The current {{research}} tested {{the idea that}} it is the cultural fit of emotions, rather than certain emotions per se, that predicts psychological well-being – i. e., feeling good about oneself, having no symptoms of depression. We reasoned that emotional fit in the domains of life that afford the realization of central cultural mandates would be particularly important to psychological well-being. We tested this hypothesis with samples from three cultural contexts that are known to differ with respect to their main cultural mandates: a European American (N = 30), a Korean (N = 80), and a Belgian sample (N = 266). Cultural fit was measured by comparing an individual’s patterns of emotions to the average cultural pattern for the same type of situation on the Emotional Patterns Questionnaire (De Leersnyder, Mesquita, & Kim, 2011). Consistent with our hypothesis, we found evidence for “universality without uniformity”: In each sample, psychological well-being was associated with emotional fit in the domain that was key to the cultural mandate. However, cultures varied with regard to the particular domain involved. Psychological well-being was predicted by emotional fit a) in autonomy-promoting <b>situations</b> <b>at</b> work in the U. S., b) in relatedness-promoting <b>situations</b> <b>at</b> home in Korea, and c) in both autonomy-promoting <b>situations</b> <b>at</b> work and relatedness-promoting <b>situations</b> <b>at</b> home in Belgium. These findings show that the experience of culturally appropriate patterns of emotions contributes to psychological well-being. One interpretation is that experiencing appropriate emotions is itself a realization of the cultural mandates. status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|Cognitive {{flexibility}} {{has been}} more broadly described {{as the ability to}} adjust one’s thinking from old situations to new situations as well as the ability to overcome responses or thinking that have become habitual and adapt to new situations. As such, if one is able to overcome previously held beliefs or habits (when it is required for new situations) then they would be considered cognitively flexible. Lastly, the ability to simultaneously consider two aspects of an object, idea, or <b>situation</b> <b>at</b> one point in time refers to cognitive flexibility. According to this definition, when sorting cards based on specific rules, children are considered cognitively flexible if they can sort cards based on the color of the objects and type of objects on the card simultaneously. Similarly, cognitive flexibility has been defined as having the understanding and awareness of all possible options and alternatives simultaneously within any given situation.|$|E
