40|$|Nitrate {{levels in}} farm ponds are {{determined}} {{with the aid}} of a water sampler that can be operated from the shore The quality of pond water in southern and western Illinois is being determined {{with the aid of}} a new type of water sampler developed in the Department of Agricultural Engineering. Work on the sampler began as part of a study of water supplies in Washington County. This study, which is being conducted through the College of Agriculture Council on Environmental Quality, was initiated in the winter of 1970, after high nitrate levels were found in the county 2 ̆ 7 s water supplies. Both ponds and wells are being sampled to determine their acceptability as sources of water. For accurate tests of pond water, samples must be obtained at various depths and distances from the shore. A boat, however, is bulky and difficult for one person to handle. The new sampler was therefore devised so that an investigator can sample pond water at any depth without ever leaving the shore. How the sampler is made The sampler consists of a telescoping rod manufactured for window- washing units; a float, a sampler head, and a bottle at one end of the rod (Fig. 1); and a T-handle and two operating reels at the other end (Fig. 2). One reel contains the cord to the float; the other, the cord that operates the sampler head. Cord guides are attached to the rod sections. The sampler head (Fig. 1) is made up of three components: the sampler head base, the bottle plate, and the stopper plate. The sampler head base is attached to the <b>sampling</b> <b>rod</b> and contains the water port through which water enters the sample bottle. An extension to the water port, which extends into the sample bottle, is attached to the sampler head base. In addition, the base contains an air e cape port. The bottle plate is attached to the sampler head base and is fabricated with threads for the sample bottle. The bottle plate may be easily removed from the sampler head base so that other bottle plates fitting different sample bottles may be used with the same sampler head. The stopper plate with stopper is spring-loaded to seal the water port while it is being positioned for sampling and after the sample has been taken. How the sampler works To obtain a sample, the rod is extended to the desired length and the bottle is attached to the sampler head on the pond shore (Fig. 3 a). The bottle and sampler head are floated to the desired position on the pond surface with the float held tightly to the sampler end of the rod (Fig. 3 b). The cord to the float is then released to allow the sampler head and bottle to sink to the desired sampling depth (Fig. 3 c) ...|$|E

The Si 2 p spectrum of a silicon sample containing a ca. 400 -nm oxide layer displays a time-dependent charging shift of ca. 1. 7 eV with respect to the Au 4 f peaks of a gold metal strip in contact with the sample. When gold is deposited as C 12 -thiol-capped nanoclusters onto the same sample, this time the Au 4 f peaks also display time-dependent charging behavior that is slightly different from that of the Si 2 p peak. This charging/discharging is related to emptying/filling of the hole traps in the oxide layer by the stray electrons within the vacuum system guided by the external voltage pulses applied to the <b>sample</b> <b>rod,</b> which can be used to extract important parameter(s) related to the dielectric properties of surface structures...|$|R

40|$|Existing {{transportation}} probabilistic {{risk assessment}} for {{spent nuclear fuel}} in the United States is based on short-term (decades) on-site storage at power plants before transport. Updated risk assessment estimates will be required as extended on-site storage (centuries) and higher burnup levels in fuel become standard. Nuclear fuel rods under these two conditions are more brittle than rods from short-term storage and intermediate burnup due to several mechanisms, including hydrogen embrittlement. Development of risk assessment requires characterizations of dynamic behavior of these degraded rods under transportation scenarios. This Honors thesis provides an initial literature review for a larger project that will investigate the dynamic response of fuel rods under vibration due to normal transportation only. The literature review covers testing procedures, methods for modeling pellet-cladding interaction, and methods for inducing hydrogen embrittlement in <b>sample</b> fuel <b>rod</b> specimens. Moreover, recommendations are provided for testing procedures for a <b>rod</b> <b>sample</b> on the uniaxial shake table at the University of New Hampshire.

In a haptic [...] haptic task, the animal had to retain {{through a period}} of delay the surface feature of the <b>sample</b> <b>rod</b> to select a rod that matched it.

40|$|By {{recording}} XPS spectra {{while applying}} external voltage stress to the <b>sample</b> <b>rod,</b> {{we can control}} the extent of charging developed on core-shell-type gold nanoparticles deposited on a copper substrate, in both steady-state and time-resolved fashions. The charging manifests itself as {{a shift in the}} measured binding energy of the corresponding XPS peak. Whereas the bare gold nanoparticles exhibit no measurable binding energy shift in the Au 4 f peaks, both the Au 4 f and the Si 2 p peaks exhibit significant and highly correlated (in time and magnitude) shifts in the case of gold (core) /silica (shell) nanoparticles. Using the shift in the Au 4 f peaks, the capacitance of the 15 -nm gold (core) / 6 -nm silica (shell) nanoparticle/nanocapacitor is estimated as 60 aF. It is further estimated that, in the fully charged situation, only 1 in 1000 silicon dioxide units in the shell carries a positive charge during our XPS analysis. Our simple method of controlling the charging, by application of an external voltage stress during XPS analysis, enables us to detect, locate, and quantify the charges developed on surface structures in a completely noncontact fashion. © 2005 American Chemical Society...|$|R

Iliac crest biopsies from healthy bone (n = 11) and patients with renal osteodystrophy (ROD, n = 11) were used in this study. The <b>ROD</b> <b>samples</b> were from patients with hyperparathyroid disease. By using FTIRI, phosphate‐to‐amide I ratio (mineral‐to‐matrix ratio), carbonate‐to‐phosphate ratio, and carbonate‐to‐amide I ratio (turnover rate/remodeling activity), as well as the collagen cross‐link ratio (collagen maturity), were quantified. Histomorphometric analyses were conducted for comparison. The <b>ROD</b> <b>samples</b> showed significantly lower carbonate‐to‐phosphate (p <. 01) and carbonate‐to‐amide I (p <. 001) ratios.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{application}} of neural networks to the recognition of lubrication defects typical to an industrial cold forging process employed by fastener manufacturers. The accurate recognition of lubrication errors, such as coating not being applied properly or damaged during material handling, {{is very important to}} the quality of the final product in fastener manufacture. Lubrication errors lead to increased forging loads and premature tool failure, as well as to increased defect sorting and the re-processing of the coated rod. The lubrication coating provides a barrier between the work material and the die during the drawing operation; moreover it needs be sufficiently robust to remain on the wire during the transfer to the cold forging operation. In the cold forging operation the wire undergoes multi-stage deformation without {{the application of}} any additional lubrication. Four types of lubrication errors, typical to production of fasteners, were introduced to a set of <b>sample</b> <b>rods,</b> which were subsequently drawn under laboratory conditions.

Application of this technique introduces charging shifts as well as broadening of the peaks, which depend non-linearly on the polarity, {{as well as on the}} frequency of the pulses applied. These changes have been measured on: (i) an artificially created dielectric sample consisting of a Au metal strip connected externally to a series resistor of 1 MΩ and a parallel capacitor of 56 nF, and two real dielectric films; (ii) a 20 nm organic polystyrene film spin-coated on a silicon substrate; (iii) a 10 nm SiO 2 inorganic layer thermally grown on silicon. A simple circuit model is introduced to simulate the charging shifts and the peak broadenings. Although this simple model faithfully reproduces the charging shifts in all three cases, and also some of the broadenings for the artificial dielectric and the polystyrene film, the additional broadening in the negatively charged peaks of the SiO 2 dielectric film cannot be accounted for. It is also claimed that these experimental findings can be used for extracting material-specific dielectric properties. © 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

For a clean silicon sample, the Si 2 p(Si 0) peak appears at correspondingly- 10. 0 eV and + 10. 0 eV binding energy positions (20. 0 eV difference) with no frequency dependence. However, the corresponding peak of the oxide (Si 4 +) appears with less than 20. 0 eV difference and exhibits a strong frequency dependence due to charging of the oxide layer, which is faithfully reproduced by a theoretical model.

40|$|A novel laser {{desorption}} system, {{with improved}} signal stability and extraordinary long lifetime, is presented {{for the study}} of jet cooled biomolecules in the gas phase using vibrationally resolved photoionisation spectroscopy. Tryptophan (Trp) is used as the test substance to characterize this desorption source. Here, the surface of a moving and rotating rod (graphite/Trp, 3 mm diameter and 6 mm length) is exposed to a pulsed desorption beam from a Nd:YAG (1064 nm) laser running at 20 Hz (Continuum Minilite). The characteristics of the source developed here and its properties with respect to cooling and stability have been investigated. Good control over the rod movement and the delivery of the IR beam result in a highly stabilized source with no noticeable fragmentation products. The combination of premixing within the source and using a pellet has made it possible to produce a stable jet-cooled beam of Trp, which lasts for several weeks without changing the sample. Additionally, the stability and signal to noise ratio has been improved by averaging the signal over the entire sample pellet by synchronizing the data acquisition with the rotation of the <b>sample</b> <b>rod.</b> The results demonstrate how a combination of the above helps to produce stable time of flight (TOF) signal and good quality one- and two-colour resonant two-photon ionisation (R 2 PI), photoionisation efficiency (PIE) and mass analyzed threshold ionization (MATI) spectra of Trp.

40|$|For {{planning}} forming processes it {{is important}} to know how the process parameters influence the properties of the material. Local properties like stiffness and strength are predictable with good accuracy. The main aim of the present work is to include also evolution of grain size in simulation processes. Therefore equal channel angular pressing (ECAP) was analyzed regarding to grain size during severe plastic deformation of a conventional Al-Mg-Si alloy (AW 6082 T 651). The basic principle of the ECAP process is characterized by pressing a square-profiled <b>sample</b> <b>rod</b> through an angled press channel. Thereby a strong shear deformation is acting in the sample which leads to a grain refinement in the material. By varying the angle of the channel and the number of pressing operations different true strains can be generated in the material. In this work angles of 90 ° and 120 ° were used and the samples were pressed repeatedly up to 4 steps. Characterization of the microstructure was done by electron back scattered diffraction (EBSD) analysis. The results show a clear dependence of the grain size on true strain which is directly affected by the channel angle and number of passes. It could be observed that every deformation step leads to grain refinement. After 4 passes a minimal grain size of 700 nm was found, which is 5 % of initial grain size. The knowledge about the relationship between grain size and stress-strain state allows the development of models for a grain size prediction. To characterize the mechanical properties of the aluminium after every deformation step compression tests were applied. The resulting flow curves of every step were accumulated. This method allows to display deformation degrees up to 4, 4. The work was done in the context of the SFB 692 HALS "High-strength aluminium-based lightweight materials for safety components"...|$|R
40|$|The {{combustion}} of 0. 32 -cm-diameter {{pure iron}} rods in gaseous oxygen under normal and reduced gravity conditions {{has been investigated}} {{to determine whether the}} upward Regression Rate of the Melting Interface (RRMI) and other burning characteristics are affected by the type of igniter material (wire) used. The experiments performed involved igniting the samples in normal gravity with different types of igniter wire at the two separate test pressures of 0. 69 and 6. 9 MPa (100 and 1000 psia). The igniter wires used were pure aluminum wire, pure iron wire and aluminum-palladium (Pyrofuze®) wire. The results have shown that in normal gravity the RRMI is unaffected by the type of igniter wire used when measured after the first two drops of molten oxide products have detached from the burning sample. However, the ignition event and subsequent first stages of burning of the iron rods were significantly different for the different igniter wires. Post-test microanalysis of test samples showed that in normal gravity, no igniter material was present with the formed oxide products {{on the end of the}} test <b>sample</b> <b>rod.</b> However, post-test microanalysis of test samples burned in reduced gravity showed a film of palladium, introduced by the Pyrofuze® igniter wire, coating the interface between the melted and resolidified portion of the rod and the formed oxide products. The physical orientation and location of the palladium film and the fact that palladium acts as a catalyst in many oxidation reactions suggests that reduced gravity burning could be influenced by the choice of igniter wire and further experimentation is warranted. Additionally, the palladium present during the ignition event in normal gravity tests may act as a catalyst to further promote the ignition of the sample and influence the initial stages of burning...|$|R
