2500|$|In 2007, Baer and Chesley {{estimated}} Metis {{to have a}} mass of 1.6-to-2.5 kg. This {{would give}} this <b>stony</b> <b>asteroid</b> a density of about 6 (3.3 to 8.9) g/cm³. A more recent estimate by Baer suggests it has a mass of (1.47±0.20) kg. Metis {{appears to be more}} dense than most other asteroids with a diameter close to 200km. [...] This may support the theory that Metis is the core remnant of a large evolved asteroid for which 90% of the original mass has been lost.|$|E
2500|$|Meteoroids enter earth's {{atmosphere}} {{from outer}} space every day, travelling at a speed of at least [...] The heat generated by compression of air {{in front of the}} body (ram pressure) as it travels through the atmosphere is immense and most meteoroids burn up or explode before they reach the ground. Since {{the second half of the}} 20th century, close monitoring of earth's atmosphere has led to the discovery that such asteroid air bursts occur rather frequently. A <b>stony</b> <b>asteroid</b> of about [...] in diameter can produce an explosion of around 20 kilotons, similar to that of the Fat Man bomb dropped on Nagasaki, and data released by the US Air Force's Defense Support Program indicate that such explosions occur high in the upper atmosphere more than once a year. Tunguska-like megaton-range events are much rarer. Eugene Shoemaker estimated that such events occur about once every 300 years.|$|E
