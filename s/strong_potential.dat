25|$|The king did not {{appoint a}} {{replacement}} viceroy {{or even a}} governor at Ava to administer the upcountry. With that decision, he had effectively retreated from Upper Burma and Shan states.

The decision was not cost free. Without closer control of a viceroy, Nanda {{would not be able to}} enlist any men from the remaining vassals in Upper Burma and Shan states in the following years.|$|E

25|$|In 1950, Lawrence's {{business}} manager and attorney Fanny Holtzmann {{was looking for}} a new property for her client when the 1944 Margaret Landon book Anna and the King of Siam was sent to her by the William Morris agent who represented Landon. He thought a stage adaptation of the book would be an ideal vehicle for the actress. Holtzmann agreed, but proposed a musical version would be better. Lawrence wanted Cole Porter to write the score, but when he proved to be unenthused by the suggestion, Holtzmann sent the book to Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II. Rodgers initially demurred because he felt Lawrence's vocal range was limited and she had a tendency to sing flat. But he realised the story had <b>strong</b> <b>potential,</b> and the two men agreed to write what ultimately became The King and I.|$|E

500|$|In Europe, he {{particularly}} frequented Berlin {{where he}} worked with the prominent Arab nationalist intellectual Shakib Arslan to proliferate anti-French sentiment, leading the French Mandatory authorities to label Quwatli one of the [...] "most dangerous" [...] Syrian exiles. He developed close ties with Ibn Saud, who by 1925 ruled much of Arabia, having overrun the Hashemites in the Hejaz. Quwatli had a prior relationship with the House of Saud, stemming from his own family's commercial links with the Saudis and Quwatli's friendship with Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, a Syrian adviser to Ibn Saud, who Quwatli had dispatched to Arabia during Faisal's rule. Quwatli, strongly distrustful of the Hashemites, was impressed by Ibn Saud's relatively quick conquest over much of Arabia and saw in the Saudis a <b>strong</b> <b>potential</b> ally against British and French imperialism in the Middle East. By 1925, Quwatli had solidified his position as the intermediary between Ibn Saud and the Syrian-Palestinian Congress. His acquisition of Saudi funding put him {{at odds with the}} Congress's chief financier Michel Lutfallah, however.|$|E
500|$|When Cosme {{became a}} {{tropical}} storm on June24, the Mexican National Weather Service (Servicio Meteorologico Nacional NWS) reported that it could produce heavy rains in the western area of the country.

The Mexican NWS also that [...] "because of its wide circulation, [...] generates significant potential for landslides and intense rain...waves 4 to 5 meters high and strong gusts of wind along the coast." [...] Based on these forecasts the SINAPROC initially issued a green alert [...] "low risk" [...] hurricane warning within the states of Jalisco, Michoacan, and Colima, as well as a blue alert [...] "minimum risk hurricane warning [...] for the states of Nayarit and Guerrero.

500|$|Welders wear {{protective}} clothing, including {{light and}} thin leather gloves and protective long sleeve shirts with high collars, to avoid exposure to strong ultraviolet light. [...] Due {{to the absence}} of smoke in GTAW, the electric arc light is not covered by fumes and particulate matter as in stick welding or shielded metal arc welding, and thus is a great deal brighter, subjecting operators to strong ultraviolet light. The welding arc has a different range and strength of UV light wavelengths from sunlight, but the welder is very close to the source and the light intensity is very <b>strong.</b> <b>Potential</b> arc light damage includes accidental flashes to the eye or arc eye and skin damage similar to strong sunburn. [...] Operators wear opaque helmets with dark eye lenses and full head and neck coverage to prevent this exposure to UV light. Modern helmets often feature a liquid crystal-type face plate that self-darkens upon exposure to the bright light of the struck arc. Transparent welding curtains, made of a polyvinyl chloride plastic film, are often used to shield nearby workers and bystanders from exposure to the UV light from the electric arc.|$|E

500|$|... "Camping" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews, {{with several}} commentators praising {{the performance of}} Rashida Jones and the new comedic direction her character was taking. Eric Sundermann of Hollywood.com praised how the script featured the entire ensemble cast together, rather than in separate subplots like recent episodes. He also enjoyed the developments with Ann's character, claiming it gave Jones more opportunities to shine than past episodes. Entertainment Weekly writer Hillary Busis said she particularly enjoyed the jokes involving Jerry's character, and said she enjoyed that Ann once again misinterpreted Chris, although she said the joke was predictable. Zap2it writer Rick Porter said the episode was not as funny as the previous episode, [...] "Harvest Festival", but said [...] "if this is what qualifies as a (slightly) down episode for the show, then that's {{the sign of a}} comedy that's hitting for a very high average".

[...] Blender, however, called it [...] "an intermittently engaging but overall shapeless collection...the product of happy-go-lucky musicians who once cavorted in bad track suits but now spend their days commuting between London, Jamaica and Los Angeles seeking the wisdom of expensive studio geeks." [...] Alex Needham of NME viewed the album's [...] "enormous waterfront of styles" [...] positively, noting that it had many <b>strong</b> <b>potential</b> singles, but found that some of the [...] "empty-headed guitar pop" [...] on {{the second half of the}} album spoiled the listening experience. Kimberly Reyes of Time stated that Rock Steady was able to integrate ska, pop, New Wave, and dancehall [...] "without sounding contrived or chaotic". Reyes added that though the album lacked the energy and sales of No Doubt's 1995 breakthrough album Tragic Kingdom, Rock Steady was [...] "their greatest effort to date...the sound of band dropping pretense to realize its potential." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine commenting that [...] "ot since Blondie [...] has a rock act so effortlessly, irreverently, and fashionably skidded across so many different genre boundaries at one time."
