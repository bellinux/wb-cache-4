50|$|The {{following}} is {{a summary of the}} conditions that cause the Morning Glory cloud to form in the Gulf of Carpentaria (after hypothesis of R.H.Clarke, as described in 1981). First, Cape York which is the peninsula that lies to the east of the gulf, is large enough that sea breezes develop on both sides. During the day, the breeze from the Coral Sea coast blows in from the east and the breeze from the gulf blows in from the west. The two breezes meet {{in the middle of the}} peninsula, forcing the air to rise there and form a line of clouds over the spine of the peninsula. When night comes, the air cools and descends and at the same time a <b>surface</b> <b>inversion</b> (where air temperature increases with height) forms over the gulf. The densities in this stable layer are different above and below the inversion. The air descending from the peninsula to the east goes underneath the inversion layer and this generates a series of waves or rolling cylinders which travel across the gulf. These cylinders of air roll along the underside of the inversion layer, so that the air rises at the front of the wave and sinks at the rear. In the early morning, the air is saturated enough so that the rising air in the front produces a cloud, which forms the leading edge of the cylinder, and evaporates in the back, hence forming the Morning Glory cloud. The cloud lasts until the <b>surface</b> <b>inversion</b> disappears with the heating of the day.|$|E

In this study, using the radiosonde data in Okhotsk Sea, which was observed in 2006 and 1998, and the calculation results of regional climate model in close vertical resolution, to clarify how the low sea surface temperature (SST) in Okhotsk Sea affects the synoptic scale disturbance and the atmospheric boundary layer. SST used as boundary conditions in the model is higher than SST observed in Bussol Sea, where is known SST is very low.

Specifically, we find that the cold layers close to the surface in Arctic winter, where most of the warming takes place, hardly contribute to the infrared radiation that goes out to space. Instead, the additional radiation that is generated by the warming of these layers is directed downwards, and thus amplifies the warming.

Based on the ABL intensive observation data analysis, the typical weather condition type associated with poor air quality over PRD could be summarized into two kinds: the warmed period before cold front (WPBCF) and the subsidence period controlled by tropical cyclone (SPCTC). Two typical polluted cases (affected by WPBCF and SPCTC, respectively) and one clean (not-polluted) case were chosen for detail analysis.
