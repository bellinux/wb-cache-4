40|$|Acyclic {{nucleoside}} bisphosphonates (ANbPs) {{have previously}} {{been shown to}} be good inhibitors of human hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) and Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) hypoxanthine-guanine-xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (PfHGXPRT). On the basis of this scaffold, a new series of ANbPs was synthesized. One of these new ANbPs, [3 -(guanine- 9 - 71) - 24 (2 -phosphonoethoxy) methyl) propoxy] methylphosphonic acid, exhibited K- 1 values of 6 and 70 nM for human HGPRT and Pf HGXPRT, respectively. These low K-i values were achieved by inserting an extra carbon atom in the linker connecting the N- 9 atom of guanine to one of the phosphonate groups. The crystal structure of this ANbP in complex with human HGPRT was determined at 2. 0 angstrom resolution and shows that it fills three key pockets in the active site. The most potent phosphoramidate prodrugs of these compounds have IC 50 values in the low micromolar range in <b>Pf</b> <b>lines</b> and low toxicity in human A 549 cells, demonstrating that these ANbPs are excellent antimalarial drug leads...|$|R
40|$|Hypoxanthine-guanine-[xanthine] phosphoribosyltransferase (HG[X]PRT) is {{considered}} an important target for antimalarial chemotherapy {{as it is the}} only pathway for the synthesis of the purine nucleoside monophosphates required for DNA/RNA production. Thus, inhibition of this enzyme should result in cessation of replication. The aza-acyclic nucleoside phosphonates (aza-ANPs) are good inhibitors of Plasmodium falciparum HGXPRT (PfHGXPRT), with Ki values as low as 0. 08 and 0. 01 μM for Plasmodium vivax HGPRT (PvHGPRT). Prodrugs of these aza-ANPs exhibit antimalarial activity against <b>Pf</b> <b>lines</b> with IC 50 values (0. 8 - 6. 0 μM) and have low cytotoxicity against human cells. Crystal structures of six of these compounds in complex with human HGPRT have been determined. These suggest that the different affinities of these aza-ANPs could be due to the flexibility of the loops surrounding the active site as well as the flexibility of the inhibitors, allowing them to adapt to fit into three binding pockets of the enzyme(s). status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{research}} was to study the composition and physicochemical properties of several fiber-rich fraction prepared from the Liucheng sweet orange peel (LSO peel) and passionfruit <b>seed</b> (<b>PF</b> <b>seed)</b> via different preparation methods by using distilled water, alcohol, and enzymatic hydrolysis. The physicochemical properties of fiber types including water-holding capacity, oil-holding capacity, swelling property, cation-exchange capacity, and glucose adsorption capacity were determined. These results demonstrated that LSO peel and <b>PF</b> <b>seed</b> were rich in insoluble fiber. LSO peel fibers were predominantly composed of uronic acid, reaveling the presence of high amount of pectin substances; whereas <b>PF</b> <b>seed</b> had {{a high level of}} cellulosic glucose and relatively a samll amount of uronic acid. In view of the physicochemical properties, LSO peel insoluble fibers showed significantly higher water-holding capacities, oil-holding capacities, swelling properties, and cation-exchange capacities than those of cellulose. On the other hand, the bulk density and cation-exchange capacities of <b>PF</b> <b>seed</b> insoluble fibers were significantly higher than those of cellulose. The fibers derived from both pomace markedly postponed the adsorption of glucose as compared with that of cellulose. By an animal model, the effect of fibers from different sources on cholesterol absorption, fecal bile acid excretion, and intestinal enzymes in hamster fed a high cholesterol diet were investigated. The hamsters were randomly allotted to the four diet groups, namely fiber-free diet, LSO peel WIS diet, <b>PF</b> <b>seed</b> WIS diet, cellulose diet, with 8 animals each. The animals were fed for 30 days. Results showed that <b>PF</b> <b>seed</b> group, followed by LSO peel group significantly decreased the level of serum triglyceride and total cholesterol. The HDL-cholesterol serum cholesterol of fiber-free group was significantly lower than those of the other three fiber-enriched groups. Compared with the cellulose, LSO peel group had significantly lower level of liver total lipids and cholesterol. However {{there was no significant difference}} in the liver total lipids and cholesterol between the <b>PF</b> <b>seed</b> and cellulose group. Furthermore, both pomace WIS significantly enhanced fecal excretions of bile acid and total cholesterol. Our results showed that the pomace fibers had pronounced effects on intestinal enzymes. The b-glucosidase and urease activities in hamsters fed diets containing both WIS were lower than those of cellulose while <b>PF</b> <b>seed</b> group also led to a significant reduction in the b-glucuronidase and mucinase activities. In conclusion, both pomace WIS possessed desired oil- or water-holding capacities, they can be applied as low-calorie bulk ingredients requiring oil and water retention. Moreover, in vitro experiment suggested that these pomace fibers retarded absorption of glucose, implying their potential hypoglycemic effect. Fibers from different sources have different effects on physiological response. The cholesterol absorption, fecal bile acid excretions, and intestinal enzyme activities in hamsters fed LSO peel WIS and <b>PF</b> <b>seed</b> WIS seem to be better than those in hamsters fed cellulose. As a consequence, these fibers could alter the intestinal environment and effectively improve intestinal health. 本研究之目的在於分別以蒸餾水、酒精洗條法及酵素水解法自柳橙皮（LSO peel）及百香果籽（PF seed）中製備纖維，並分別探討此兩種果渣纖維的單糖組成分及不同物理化學性質如保水性、保油性、膨脹性、陽離子交換能力及對葡萄糖的吸附或結合能力。實驗結果顯示LSO peel及PF seed的纖維富含許多非水溶性纖維，前者的單糖大多以醛糖酸（uronic acid）為主，顯示含有許多果膠物質；後者則以纖維素葡萄糖（cellulosic glucose）含量較多，亦含有少量的糖醛酸。在物理化學性質上，LSO peel非水溶性纖維的保水力、保油性、膨脹性及陽離子交換能力皆明顯（P< 0. 05 ）較纖維素為高，而百香果籽非水溶性纖維的體積密度及陽離子交換能力均明顯（P< 0. 05 ）高於纖維素，然而在保水性及膨脹性皆明顯（P< 0. 05 ）低於纖維素，然而，其保油性並無顯著差異。另外，兩種果渣纖維對葡萄糖的吸收明顯（P< 0. 05 ）較纖維素有延緩作用。 同時，本研究以實驗動物（倉鼠）為研究對象，探討在高膽固醇飲食下，添加不同來源纖維是否對倉鼠之膽固醇的吸收、膽酸排泄、腸道組織形態及腸道酵素活性的影響。倉鼠隨機分成四組，分別餵以柳橙皮非水溶性固形物（LSO peel WIS）、百香果籽非水溶性固形物（PF seed WIS）。另外，以含纖維素飼料作為正控制組，不添加纖維的高膽固醇為負控制組。動物飼養 30 天。實驗結果顯示血清三酸甘油酯及總膽固醇以PF seed組較低，其次為LSO peel組。而在血清高密度脂蛋白膽固醇方面，不添加纖維組明顯（P< 0. 05 ）低於其他三組非水溶性纖維。與纖維素比較之下，LSO peel組明顯（P< 0. 05 ）能降低肝臟總脂質及膽固醇，然而PF seed 組與纖維素組之間無顯著差異;而在糞便總膽固醇及膽酸排出量上，與纖維素比較之下，兩種果渣WIS明顯（P< 0. 05 ）能增加膽固醇及膽酸的排出。另外，果渣纖維對腸道酵素的影響上，兩種果渣WIS皆顯著降低b-glucosidase及urease活性，而PF seed組明顯（P< 0. 05 ）較纖維素組能降低b-glucuronidase及mucinase活性。此外，兩種果渣WIS亦能增加maltase活性。 綜合以上分析結果，利用兩種果渣WIS具有良好的理化特性，可應用於高纖的低熱量食品上。另外，於體外試驗可得知兩種果渣非水溶性纖維，顯示能延緩葡萄糖的吸收，可能具有降血糖的作用。不同來源的纖維對生理活性有不同的影響效應，本研究中的LSO peel WIS及PF seed WIS對倉鼠的膽固醇吸收、膽酸排泄及腸道酵素活性皆較纖維素有良好的影響，並可改善腸道的環境，以減少有毒物質對腸道造成損傷。謝誌……………………………………………………………………. i 中文摘要………………………………………………………………ii 英文摘要………………………………………………………………iv 目錄……………………………………………………………vi

40|$|Graduation date: 1983 The {{effects of}} clonal variability, crown {{position}} of cones, and top-pruning of ramets to reduce height growth, on 1) {{the proportion of}} viable self-fertilized progeny (s) and 2) the proportion of filled <b>seeds</b> (<b>PF),</b> were investigated in a 20 year-old Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii [Mirb. 1 Franco) seed orchard. Cones were collected from the upper one-third and lower one-third crown positons of pruned and nonpruned raiets (three each) from six clones. Estimates of s were derived from a maximum likelihood procedure using data from 10 allozyme loci (PGII, LAP 1, LAP 2, GOT 2, GOT 3, GLYDH, CAT, 6 PGD, IDH, and DIA). The six clones sampled varied significantly (P < 0. 05) both in s and PF, but estimates of PF and s were not significantly correlated among clones. On the average, seeds from the upper portion of the crown were lower in s (0. 055) and higher in PF (0. 512) than seeds from the lower crown (s = 0. 190, PF = 0. 381). Combined over crown positions, pruning appeared to have little effect on s, while pruned ramets (PF = 0. 432) had only a slightly lower filled seed proportion than nonpruned ramets (PF = 0. 461). A total crown estimate of the proportion of viable progeny due to selffertilization from the six sampled clones was about 10 percent. These results show that crown position of cones, top-pruning, and clonal variation are all factors which could influence orchard management practices and the utilization of orchard seeds. Although the average proportion of viable progeny resulting from selffertilization in the seed orchard appeared to be no greater than that found in natural populations, information on clonal variation {{may be useful in}} roguing decisions. It may be desirable to remove clones which are consistently high selfers and low seed producers; or perhaps seed from these clones should be excluded from commercial collections. In addition, orchard managers may consider not collecting lower crown cones because of the lower seed yields and greater proportions of self seed found in the lower crown. In this study, the effects of top-pruning orchard ramets on seed set or self ing appeared to be minimal, but {{it remains to be seen}} whether there is a relationship between severity of top-pruning and seed quality or quantity...|$|R

Final nematode population densities (Pf) in hulls and <b>seeds</b> were greater (<b>Pf</b> < 0. 001) in plants inoculated at or before 9 weeks after planting. Pod disease symptoms correlated positively with the Pf in the pods. The seedgrade of peanuts inoculated at or before 9 weeks after planting was reduced, whereas grade of peanuts from plants inoculated at 15 weeks or later was not reduced. Peanut plants inoculated 12 weeks after planting with a Pi of 10 - 100 {{had a lower}} Pf (P < 0. 05) than plants with a Pi of 250 to 8, 000. Seed of plants with a Pi of 250 or less could be marketed as choice edible seed, whereas those with a Pi of 500 or more were of reduced seedgrade. These results suggest that as few as 500 nematodes per plant at 12 weeks after planting can build up to injurious levels before harvest.

40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} {{a class of}} irredundant low power encoding techniques for memory address buses. The basic idea is to partition the memory space {{into a number of}} sectors. These sectors can, for example, represent address spaces for the code, heap, and stack segments of one or more application programs. Each address is first dynamically mapped to the appropriate sector and then is encoded with respect to the sector head. Each sector head is updated based on the last accessed address in that sector. The result of this sector-based encoding technique is a {{reduction in the number of}} bus transitions when encoding consecutive addresses that access different sectors. Our proposed techniques have small power and delay overhead when compared with many of the existing methods in the literature. One of our proposed techniques is very suitable for encoding addresses that are sent from an on-chip cache to the main memory when multiple application programs are executing on the processor in a time-sharing basis. For a computer system without an on-chip cache, the proposed techniques decrease the switching activity of data address and multiplexed address buses by an average of 55 % and 67 %, respectively. For a system with on-chip cache, up to 55 % transition reduction is achieved on a multiplexed address bus between the internal cache and the external memory. Assuming a 10 <b>pf</b> per <b>line</b> bus capacitance, we show that power reduction of up to 52 % for an external data address bus and 42 % for the multiplexed bus between cache and main memory is achieved using our methods...|$|R

To characterize the region through which glucose exerts this effect, three different-length fragments of the 5 '-flanking region of the human SI gene were linked to the reporter gene luciferase in an episomal vector carrying a hygromycin resistance gene. These fragments were used for transfection into a clone of the Caco- 2 cell <b>line,</b> <b>PF</b> 11, which has high glucose consumption and only expresses SI at high levels when cultured {{in the presence of}} a low supply of glucose. By using the stably transformed PF 11 cells grown either in standard high glucose (25 mM) or in low glucose (1 mM) it was possible to show that the smallest fragment of the SI promoter, extending from bases - 370 to + 30, contains all the information required for the glucose repression of the reporter gene luciferase...|$|R

Energy from processes common to all production lines have also been investigated. Energy use for these have been distributed over the production lines since the products also should carry these energy costs. There, it is shown that the potato chips line is using {{by far the most}} energy in a year, 13, 200 MWh, but it is the line that runs the most too. The potato mash line had the second largest energy use, at 6, 600 MWh. But when the energy usage was calculated per kilogram produced, it turned out that it was the potato mash line that use the most energy, 2. 75 kWh/kg. From the total energy use the cost and carbon emissions were calculated, both in total and per produced kilogram. Here it showed that the potato mash line also has the highest emissions of carbon dioxide and the highest energy cost per kilogram produced. It is also the potato chips line that has the second highest emissions of carbon dioxide per kilogram produced, but it is the fried products from the <b>PF</b> 2 <b>line</b> that has the second highest energy cost per kilogram pro- duced. This is because the fryer in the <b>PF</b> 2 <b>line</b> uses oil to heat up the frying oil. Several proposed measures to reduce energy use have been developed. Three of the chimneys that were measured at Chips AB had a lot of excess heat that can be used, it was the potato chips fryer, the PF 1 boiler and the PF 1 fryer. The best proposed measures is to use the excess heat for space heating and domestic hot water and to heat the blanching water. Together, these measures could at best be able to provide an annual saving of approximately € 516, 000, and still have a payback period of less than a year. Other proposed measures that also were inves- tigated were preheating of the air to the potato chips boiler, absorption cooling and power generation, but these proposals had less savings and longer payback periods than the first pro- posals...|$|R
40|$|We {{have carried}} out a survey of 60 Herbig Ae/Be stars in the 3 micron {{wavelength}} region in search for the rare spectral features at 3. 43 and 3. 53 micron. These features {{have been attributed to}} the presence of large, hot, hydrogen-terminated nanodiamonds. Only two Herbig Ae/Be stars, HD 97048 and Elias 3 - 1 are known to display both these features. We have obtained medium-resolution spectra (R ~ 2500) with the ESO near-IR instrument ISAAC in the 3. 15 - 3. 65 micron range. In our sample, no new examples of sources with prominent nanodiamond features in their 3 micron spectra were discovered (detection rate less than 4 %). We report tentative 3. 53 micron detections in V 921 Sco (=CD- 42. 11721), HD 163296 and T CrA. The sources which display the nanodiamond features are not exceptional in the group of Herbig stars with respect to disk properties, stellar characteristics, or disk and stellar activity. Moreover, the nanodiamond sources are very different from each other in terms of these parameters. We do not find evidence for a recent supernova in the vicinity of any of the nanodiamond sources. We have analyzed the PAH 3. 3 micron feature and the Pfund delta hydrogen emission line, two other spectral features which occur in the 3 micron wavelength range. We reinforce the conclusion of previous authors that flared-disk systems display significantly more PAH emission than self-shadowed-disk sources. The <b>Pf</b> delta <b>line</b> detection rate is higher in self-shadowed-disk sources than in the flared-disk systems. We discuss the possible origin and paucity of the (nano) diamond features in Herbig stars. Different creation mechanisms have been proposed in the literature, amongst others in-situ and supernova-induced formation. Our data set is inconclusive in proving or disproving either formation mechanism. Comment: 22 pages, 9 figures, 5 tables; accepted for publication in A&A (acceptance date 16 / 06 / 2006...|$|R
40|$|Megakaryocyte (MK) –specific {{transgene}} expression {{has proved}} valuable in studying thrombotic and hemostatic processes. Constitutive expression of genes, however, {{could result in}} altered phenotypes due to compensatory mechanisms or lethality. To circumvent these limitations, we used the tetracycline/doxycycline (Tet) –off system to conditionally over-express genes in megakaryocytes and platelets in vivo. We generated 3 transactivator transgenic lines expressing the Tet transactivator element (tTA), {{under the control of}} the MK-specific platelet factor 4 promoter (PF 4 -tTA-VP 16). Responder lines were simultaneously generated, each with a bidirectional minimal cytomegalovirus (CMV) –tTA responsive promoter driving prokaryotic β-galactosidase gene, as a cellular reporter, and a gene of interest (in this case, the mitotic regulator Aurora-B). A transactivator founder line that strongly expressed PF 4 -driven tTA–viral protein 16 (VP 16) was crossbred to a responder line. The homozygous double-transgenic mouse line exhibited doxycycline-dependent transgene overexpression in MKs and platelets. Using this line, platelets were conveniently indicated at sites of induced stress by β-galactosidase staining. In addition, we confirmed our earlier report on effects of constitutive expression of Aurora-B, indicating a tight regulation at protein level and a modest effect on MK ploidy.

The ISAAC data allowed us to build the first spectroscopic data cube of {{the region in the}} L-band domain corrected for the foreground extinction. Maps of the water ice and hydrocarbon absorption line strength were then derived. These maps are important diagnostics of the interstellar and circumstellar medium (resp. ISM and CSM). They support our previous results that the absorption features are most probably occuring in the local Galactic center medium and can be associated with the individual sources. Moreover, turbulence seems to affect the studied region of the minispiral which appears like a mixture of a dense and diffuse medium.

40|$|Crizotinib (PF 02341066) is a {{tyrosine}} kinase inhibitor of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) {{that has been}} shown to selectively inhibit growth of cancer cells that harbor the EML 4 -ALK fusion found in a subset of patients with non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). While in clinical trials, PF 02341066 has shown a significant therapeutic benefit as a single agent; the effectiveness of combining it with other therapeutic modalities including ionizing radiation remains unknown. To further elucidate the role of PF 02341066 in tumor inhibition, we examined its effects alone and in combination with radiation on downstream signaling, apoptosis, and radiosensitivity in twoNSCLC cell lines in vitro: H 3122, which harbors theEML 4 -ALK fusion, andH 460,which does not. We also examined the in vivo effects of PF 02341066 inH 3122 mouse xenografts. In theH 3122 cell <b>line,</b> <b>PF</b> 02341066 inhibited phosphorylation of ALK and its downstream effectors: AKT, ERK, and STAT 3. H 3122 cells treatedwith a combination of PF 02341066 and radiation showedan increase in cellular apoptosis andwere sensitized to radiation therapy (dose enhancement ratio, 1. 43; P < 0. 0001). Moreover, in an H 3122 xenograft model, the combined treatment resulted in greater tumor growth inhibition than either treatment alone (P < 0. 05). None of these effects was observed in the EML 4 -ALK–negative H 460 cells. Our findings indicate that PF 02341066 acts as a radiation sensitizer in cells harboring the EML 4 -ALK fusion, providing a rationale for a clinical trial combining ALK inhibitor with radiation in the NSCLCs expressing ALK.

40|$|PURPOSE: Despite recent {{improvements}} in therapeutic management of osteosarcoma, ongoing challenges {{in improving the}} response to chemotherapy warrants {{the development of new}} strategies to improve overall patient survival. Among them, HSP 90 is a molecular chaperone involved in the maturation and stability of various oncogenic proteins leading to tumor cells survival and disease progression. We assessed the antitumor properties of a synthetic HSP 90 inhibitor, PF 4942847, alone or in combination with zoledronic acid in osteosarcoma. METHODS: The effects of PF 4942847 were evaluated on human osteosarcoma cells growth and apoptosis. Signaling pathways were analyzed by Western blotting. The consequence of HSP 90 therapy combined or not with zoledronic acid was evaluated in mice bearing HOS-MNNG xenografts on tumor growth, associated bone lesions, and pulmonary metastasis. The effect of PF 4942847 on osteoclastogenesis was assessed on human CD 14 (+) monocytes. RESULTS: In osteosarcoma cell <b>lines,</b> <b>PF</b> 4942847 inhibited cell growth in a dose-dependent manner (IC 50 ± 50 nmol/L) and induced apoptosis with an increase of sub-G 1 fraction and cleaved PARP. These biologic events were accompanied by decreased expression of Akt, p-ERK, c-Met, and c-RAF 1. When administered orally to mice bearing osteosarcoma tumors, PF 4942847 significantly inhibited tumor growth by 80 %, prolonged survival compared with controls, and inhibited pulmonary metastases by blocking c-Met, FAK, and MMP 9 signaling. In contrast to 17 -allylamino- 17 -demethoxygeldanamycin (17 -AAG), PF 4942847 did not induce osteoclast differentiation, and synergistically acted with zoledronic acid to delay osteosarcoma progression and prevent bone lesions. CONCLUSIONS: All these data provide a strong rationale for clinical evaluation of PF 4942847 alone or in combination with zoledronic acid in osteosarcoma. Clin Cancer Res; 1 - 14. © 2015 AACR...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{production}} of gametocytes {{is essential for}} transmission of malaria parasites from the mammalian host to the mosquito vector. However {{the process by which}} the asexual blood-stage parasite undergoes commitment to sexual development is not well understood. This process is known to be sensitive to environmental stimuli and {{it has been suggested that}} a G protein dependent system may mediate the switch, but there is little evidence that the Plasmodium falciparum genome encodes heterotrimeric G proteins. Previous studies have indicated that the malaria parasite can interact with endogenous erythrocyte G proteins, and other components of the cyclic nucleotide pathway have been identified in P. falciparum. Also, the polypeptide cholera toxin, which induces commitment to gametocytogenesis is known to catalyze the ADP-ribosylation of the α(s) class of heterotrimeric G protein α subunits in mammalian systems has been reported to detect a number of G(α) subunits in P. falciparum-infected red cells. METHODS: Cholera toxin and Mas 7 (a structural analogue of Mastoparan) were used to assess the role played by putative G protein signalling in the commitment process, both are reported to interact with different components of classical Gas and Gai/o signalling pathways. Their ability to induce gametocyte production in the transgenic P. falciparum <b>line</b> <b>Pfs</b> 16 -GFP was determined and downstream effects on the secondary messenger cAMP measured. RESULTS: Treatment of parasite cultures with either cholera toxin or MAS 7 resulted in increased gametocyte production, but only treatment with MAS 7 resulted in a significant increase in cAMP levels. This indicates that MAS 7 acts either directly or indirectly on the P. falciparum adenylyl cyclase. CONCLUSION: The observation that cholera toxin treatment did not affect cAMP levels indicates that while addition of cholera toxin does increase gametocytogenesis the method by which it induces increased commitment is not immediately obvious, except that is unlikely to be via heterotrimeric G proteins.
