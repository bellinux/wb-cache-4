40|$|The {{interactions}} between two opposing teams {{lead to the}} emergence of unique game patterns. In volleyball, attack efficacy emerges as the strongest predictor of the final result and thus it becomes of foremost importance to understand which game patterns afford the attaining of higher attack efficacies. These rely {{on the quality of the}} setting action. In turn, the serve and the serve reception constrain the setter's actions and the attacker's efficacy. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine predictors of the <b>setting</b> <b>zone</b> in elite-level men's volleyball. Thirty-one matches of the 2007 World Cup were analyzed, in total 5117 rallies. The dependent variable was the <b>setting</b> <b>zone,</b> and the independent variables were the server player, serve type, serve direction, serve depth, reception zone, receiver player and reception type. Multinomial logistic regression was applied, in order to obtain the estimated likelihood of occurrence of the dependent variable, based on the values of the independent variables (p < 0. 05). Only the serve direction showed not to be predictive of the <b>setting</b> <b>zone.</b> Concerning the remaining variables, the tennis jump serve, serves from the middle-player, deep serves, reception near the endline or sidelines, reception by the zone 4 attackers when in defensive zone, and low reception all proved to impair the quality of reception, demanding the setter to play more often in the not acceptable <b>setting</b> <b>zone.</b> Results suggest that, at this level, practice of serve-reception should preferably cover the deep tennis jump serve, and attempt to afford the libero more opportunities to receive. By focusing on the variables with the most predictive power, performers may better allocate their attention towards the most pertinent cues at each moment. Knowledge of these interactive models provides valuable insights into the dynamics of the action sequences, affording coaches important information and guidanc...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} how different variables of the setting action affect to the block participation in high level male volleyball. The study sample was comprised of a total of 2742 game actions, divided into 1371 setting actions and 1371 block actions, corresponding to the observation of the 24 matches of the third stage of the World Male Volleyball Championship, absolute category. The dependent variable was block participation (zero or one blocker, two blockers, three blockers). The independent variables were: <b>setting</b> <b>zone</b> (excellent, acceptable, unacceptable), type of set (standing set, jump set), setting technique (overhand set, forearm <b>set),</b> set´s area (<b>zone</b> one, zone two, zone three, zone four, zone six) and tempo of set (first tempo, second tempo, third tempo). The result of this study showed that the variables <b>setting</b> <b>zone,</b> type of <b>set,</b> set’s area and tempo of set, were predictors of the block participation. Thus, the decision-making of the setter in the setting action as well as the type, area and tempo of set, has high relevance in game, affecting to the block participation of the opposing team.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the effect of}} modifying the analysis zones used to analyse aggregate data for geographic zones. It uses two approaches to do this. Firstly assuming that a population model is available, the effect of misspecification of the zones used to analyse the data is investigated. Secondly, the effects of zoning on the parameter estimates are investigated empirically, by creating a zoning distribution for the parameter estimates obtained using an ecological model for statistics such as population means and regression coefficients. The zoning distribution defines the probability distribution or density function of the statistic over all possible <b>sets</b> of M <b>zones</b> that could be formed, given the constraints used in constructing the zones. Using a combination of statistical theory and empirical investigation, the parameter estimates obtained from the ecological analysis of small area health data are investigated when different <b>sets</b> of geographical <b>zones</b> are used to aggregate the data. By aggregating the data to 8 different scales using multiple <b>sets</b> of <b>zones</b> an empirical zoning distribution is obtained for each parameter estimate at each scale of analysis. This allows the implications of using a particular <b>set</b> of <b>zones</b> to be assessed for both a continuous and a binary response variable. The procedure for creating and analysing the distributions has some innovative aspects. To obtain detailed population information, unit record files from the Australian 2007 - 2008 National Health Survey (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2009) were combined with area level constraints from the 2006 Australian Census (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2006 a) to simulate realistic individual level data using combinatorial optimisation techniques. The data were aggregated to 1000 <b>sets</b> of <b>zones</b> at eight scales of aggregation using the AZTool program. Empirical zoning distributions were created from the parameter estimates obtained from analysing the data summaries for each <b>set</b> of <b>zones.</b> The {{results show that the}} zoning distribution exists, is approximately normal and its variance increases as the scale increases. Even with over 1000 zones the variance of the zoning distribution cannot be ignored when interpreting the results of a zone based analysis...|$|R
