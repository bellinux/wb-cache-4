A human being must be able to live indefinitely, or to put it in another way, it {{should not be allowed to}} die through ageing. There must be <b>something</b> <b>inside</b> us, that can be modified (perhaps at conception) that will shift the entire death pathway into another, parallel pathway, that will have no predetermined end. This ‘something’ is in fact, the evolutionary impetus to achieve higher levels of complexity in the quickest way possible. There should be a way to enhance this process and accelerate our transition from the process of evolution by natural selection to a post-Darwinian, transhumanist domain where indefinite life-spans are the norm.|$|E

The developing of new sealing jutsus was continued by the Uzumaki Clan, a branch of Senju Clan who are descendants of the sage; among their works is a jutsu that seals Tailed Beasts into their Jinchuriki to be. The most common application of this is sealing weapons or other objects within scrolls to efficiently carry {{a large number of}} items. Sealing jutsu are also utilized to restrict access to things, such as chakra or entry to a building. The [...] "Reaper Death Seal" [...] is a unique sealing jutsu as the target's soul is sealed with the Reaper, who is neither living nor an object.|$|E

In her testimony in court, Prem's sister Mamie Ahuja, stated that Prem had agreed to marry Sylvia, provided she divorced her husband. However, this was contradicted by the letters written by Sylvia (admitted as Sylvia's testimony), where she expressed her desire to divorce Nanavati and marry Prem, but she doubted whether Prem had the same intentions.

So I cooked, trapped, freighted, wrangled dudes, trained horses, lambed sheep - just anything there was to do. I learned to do lots of things, but some of the things aren't of much use to me now - for example, how to put a six- or eight-horse team around a sharp bend. But some are real useful.

2500|$|The Greater Toronto Area {{is served}} by seven {{distinct}} telephone area codes. Before 1993, the GTA used the 416 area code. In a 1993 zone split, Metropolitan Toronto retained the 416 code, while the other municipalities of the Greater Toronto Area were assigned the new area code 905. This division by area code {{has become part of}} the local culture to the point where local media refer to <b>something</b> <b>inside</b> Toronto as [...] "the 416" [...] and outside of Toronto as [...] "the 905". For example, the Raptors 905 basketball team in the NBA Development League is named after the area code the team represents. Though for the most part the use of the area 905 as shorthand for the suburban areas outside Toronto city limits was correct, it is not entirely true as some portions of Durham and York Regions use the 705 area code. Furthermore, there are areas, such as Hamilton, the Regional Municipality of Niagara and Port Hope (in Northumberland County) that use the 905 area code, but are not part of the GTA. The unincorporated community of Acton (in Halton Hills), is the only community in the GTA that uses the 519 area code, which covers most of Southwestern Ontario.|$|E
2500|$|An American geologist, Clayborne {{is one of}} {{the first}} areologists and {{maintains}} a stalwart desire to see Mars preserved in the state it holds when humans arrive. [...] Clayborne early on debates Saxifrage Russell over the proper role of humanity on Mars and though initially apolitical, this stance marks her as the original [...] "Red," [...] while Russell's hands-on terraforming reflects the antithesis of these views. [...] Clayborne is shown to prefer solitude during much of the series, and even her relationship with fellow First Hundred settler Simon (with whom she has a child) is subject to introspective silence in most cases. [...] Simon's death and the estrangement she finds from their son Peter when the latter emerges as a leading moderate [...] "green" [...] drive her to further isolation. [...] Clayborne's relationship with Russell is shown to be complex, the two of them taking early opposite views but the situation slowly changing as Russell comes to appreciate what has been unleashed and what has indeed been lost as science gives way to commercial exploitation that he cannot control. [...] During the events of Blue Mars, Russell intervenes to save Clayborne's life; later, the two are revealed to have once shared an attraction that went astray because of a casual misinterpretation between them. Ann undergoes a drastic change towards Blue Mars due to the emergence of <b>something</b> <b>inside</b> of her which she describes as anti-Ann and something else which she can't quite describe.|$|E

2500|$|However, Lucretius, {{describing}} atomism in his De rerum natura, gives {{very clear}} and compelling empirical arguments for the original atomist theory. He observes that any material is subject to irreversible decay. Through time, even hard rocks are slowly worn down by drops of water. Things have the tendency to get mixed up: Mix water with soil and mud will result, seldom disintegrating by itself. Wood decays. However, there are mechanisms in nature and technology to recreate [...] "pure" [...] materials like water, air, and metals. The seed of an oak will grow out into an oak tree, made of similar wood as historical oak trees, the wood of which has already decayed. The conclusion is that many properties of materials must derive from <b>something</b> <b>inside,</b> that will itself never decay, something that stores for eternity the same inherent, indivisible properties. The basic question is: Why has {{everything in the world}} not yet decayed, and how can exactly some of the same materials, plants, and animals be recreated again and again? One obvious solution to explain how indivisible properties can be conveyed in a way not easily visible to human senses, is to hypothesize the existence of [...] "atoms". These classical [...] "atoms" [...] are nearer to humans' modern concept of [...] "molecule" [...] than to the atoms of modern science. The other central point of classical atomism is that there must be considerable open space between these [...] "atoms": the void. Lucretius gives reasonable arguments that the void is absolutely necessary to explain how gasses and liquids can flow and change shape, while metals can be molded without their basic material properties changing.|$|E
