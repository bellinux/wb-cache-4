5|$|Leaf {{morphology}} is {{also very}} diverse in this large genus. Some leaves are very thin, almost needle-like (S. affine), while others are short, <b>stubby,</b> and arranged in rosettes (S. pulviniforme). Another group of species, such as S. scandens (climbing triggerplant) form scrambling, tangled mats typically propped up on aerial roots.|$|E
50|$|After the {{relaxation}} of Prohibition in the U.S. in 1936, many breweries began marketing beer in steel cans. The glass industry responded by devising short bottles with little necks, nicknamed <b>stubbies,</b> and types with short necks were called steinies. Capacities varied, with 12oz {{being the most}} common size used for soft drinks. The steinie dominated in the U.S. by 1950, and the neck became longer, such as seen with the familiar Budweiser bottle. <b>Stubbies</b> were popular in Canada until the 1980s. Today, standard SP Lager from Papua New Guinea {{is one of the}} few beers still sold in 12oz neckless <b>stubbies.</b> The U.S. steinie shape now dominates for small beer bottles the world over, in sizes from half-pint to the European 500ml. The word stubbie is now only in common use in Australia.|$|R

The company later {{changed its name to}} <b>Stubbies</b> because of the success of this line. The company was bought out by US-based Sara Lee Corporation in 1990 and moved offshore. Pacific Dunlop (now Pacific Brands) acquired Sara Lee Apparel Australasia in 2001 and brought the company back to Australia.|$|R
5|$|The pardalotes are a {{small family}} of very small, brightly {{coloured}} birds native to Australia, with short tails, strong legs and <b>stubby</b> blunt beaks. They feed on insects, generally in the canopy of eucalypts and nest in burrows. Three species are found in Tasmania, of which one is endemic and endangered.|$|E
5|$|Giant otter muzzles {{are short}} and sloping {{and give the}} head a ball-shaped appearance. The ears are small and rounded. The nose (or rhinarium) is {{completely}} covered in fur, with only the two slit-like nostrils visible. The giant otter's highly sensitive whiskers (vibrissae) allow the animal to track changes in water pressure and currents, which aids in detecting prey. The legs are short and <b>stubby</b> and end in large webbed feet tipped with sharp claws. Well suited for an aquatic life, it can close its ears and nose while underwater.|$|E
5|$|In most amphibians, {{there are}} four digits on the fore foot and five on the hind foot, but no claws on either. Some {{salamanders}} have fewer digits and the amphiumas are eel-like in appearance with tiny, <b>stubby</b> legs. The sirens are aquatic salamanders with stumpy forelimbs and no hind limbs. The caecilians are limbless. They burrow {{in the manner of}} earthworms with zones of muscle contractions moving along the body. On the surface of the ground or in water they move by undulating their body from side to side.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} {{diseases}} that {{can reduce the}} yield and market value of carrots. The most devastating carrot disease is Alternaria leaf blight, which {{has been known to}} eradicate entire crops. A bacterial leaf blight caused by Xanthomonas campestris can also be destructive in warm, humid areas. Root knot nematodes (Meloidogyne species) can cause <b>stubby</b> or forked roots, or galls. Cavity spot, caused by the oomycetes Pythium violae and Pythium sulcatum, results in irregularly shaped, depressed lesions on the taproots.|$|E
5|$|Chrysler {{realized}} that his tower's height would exceed the Empire State Building's as well, having ordered Van Alen to change the Chrysler's original roof from a <b>stubby</b> Romanesque dome to the narrow steel spire. However, the Empire State's developer John J. Raskob reviewed the plans and {{realized that}} he could add five more floors and a spire of his own to his 80-story building, and subsequently acquired the nearby plots needed to support that building's height extension. Two days later, the Empire State Building's co-developer, former Governor Al Smith, announced the updated plans for that skyscraper, with an observation deck on the 86th-floor roof at a height of , higher than the Chrysler's 71st-floor observation deck.|$|E
5|$|Nothomyrmecia queens are brachypterous, {{meaning that}} they have <b>stubby</b> {{rudimentary}} wings that render them flightless. This may correlate with population structure, possibly as an adaptation in small populated colonies or by unusual ecological requirements. The alates may begin to emerge in late summer and early autumn (March or April), and colony-founding queens excavate to considerable depths underground; queens start to lay eggs by spring. Queens are univoltine and only produce a single generation of ants annually, and eggs may take 12 months to fully develop. When a colony is mature, only 50 to 100 individuals are present in each nest. In some colonies, colony founding can occur within a colony itself when a queen dies, taken over by one of her daughters. This method of colony founding may render a nest immortal.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{species from}} the Australian region, {{sometimes}} separated in , are called [...] "nativehens". The nativehens differ visually by shorter, thicker and <b>stubbier</b> toes and bills, and longer tails that lack the white signal pattern of typical moorhens.|$|R

50|$|In 1983, entomologists Darryl Gwynne and David Rentz {{reported}} on Julodimorpha beetles observed attempting to copulate with discarded brown <b>stubbies</b> (a type of beer bottles) studded with tubercules (flattened glass beads). This work won them the 2011 Ig Nobel Prize in biology.|$|R
5|$|Other {{complications}} include encephalitis (1 in 500 patients), {{which is}} more common in adults and may cause temporary disability; permanent pitted scars, most notably on the face; and complications involving the eyes (2 percent of all cases). Pustules can form on the eyelid, conjunctiva, and cornea, leading to complications such as conjunctivitis, keratitis, corneal ulcer, iritis, iridocyclitis, and optic atrophy. Blindness results in approximately 35 percent to 40 percent of eyes affected with keratitis and corneal ulcer. Hemorrhagic smallpox can cause subconjunctival and retinal hemorrhages. In 2 to 5 percent of young children with smallpox, virions reach the joints and bone, causing osteomyelitis variolosa. Lesions are symmetrical, most common in the elbows, tibia, and fibula, and characteristically cause separation of an epiphysis and marked periosteal reactions. Swollen joints limit movement, and arthritis may lead to limb deformities, ankylosis, malformed bones, flail joints, and <b>stubby</b> fingers.|$|E
5|$|Several rock types {{with varying}} {{chemical}} compositions make up Level Mountain. Ankaramites and alkali basalts {{are the primary}} volcanic rocks comprising the basal shield. Alkali basalts form columnar jointed lava flows, vesicular lava flows, dikes and scoria while ankaramites are present as dark-coloured lava flows with several columnar cooling units. Trachybasalts, phonolites, trachytes, peralkaline trachytes, pantellerites, comendites and rhyolites form the overlying stratovolcano and domes. They comprise dikes, welded tuffs, pitchstones, volcanic plugs, laccoliths and flows. Trachybasalts are {{in the form of}} two textural types; phenocryst-rich lava flows and fragmental flow agglomerates. Phonolites are vesicular and pumiceous in nature, although phonolites with trachytic texture are also present. Trachytes and peralkaline trachytes are the primary volcanic rocks in the Level Mountain Range. Comendite lava flows appear to have erupted fluidly, forming lava tubes. Rhyolites are in the form of <b>stubby</b> lava flows and domes.|$|E
5|$|The Fiji parrotfinch (Erythrura pealii) is {{a species}} of estrildid finch endemic to Fiji that was {{formerly}} {{considered to be a}} subspecies of the red-headed parrotfinch. This parrotfinch is a small, mainly green bird with a red head and tail and a <b>stubby</b> dark grey bill. It is found in both forested and open habitats, and has adapted well to man-made environments such as grasslands, pasture and gardens. Pairs have a courtship display in which they fly above the trees in an undulating flight, calling constantly. Breeding birds build a domed grass nest with a side entrance, and lay a clutch normally of four white eggs. Newly hatched chicks are naked and pink, with blue balls at the upper and lower corners of the gape, and black markings inside the mouth; older fledglings resemble the adults, but lack the red head colouring. The Fiji parrotfinch eats seeds, especially of grasses, and also readily feeds on insects and nectar. It forms small flocks of up to six birds after the breeding season.|$|E
50|$|Certain {{types of}} {{clothing}} are stereotypically associated with bogans, including flannelette shirts, monkey hoodies, <b>Stubbies</b> shorts, King Gee workwear, ugg boots, jeans and black leggings. Bogans may also show a lowbrow standard of personal grooming by wearing their {{hair in a}} mullet.|$|R
5000|$|Swanndri — a 100% {{waterproof}} woollen overcoat. Popular amongst farmers due to {{it being}} 'warm in winter, cool in summer'. Typically {{made in a}} tartan/patch work pattern.
