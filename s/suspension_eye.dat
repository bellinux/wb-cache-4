40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{evaluate}} the in vitro efficacy of six novel ophthalmic clarithromycin formulations {{and to explore}} the pharmaceutical aspects of these formulations that may influence patient tolerability. Because clarithromycin ophthalmic formulations are not registered in Europe, we manufactured several extemporaneous ophthalmic formulations. DESIGN AND METHODS Six clarithromycin ophthalmic formulations were prepared aseptically: three clear eye drops, two ophthalmic suspensions and one ophthalmic ointment. In vitro efficacy was tested by inoculating agar plates with Moraxella catarrhalis and determining growth inhibition. Bonferroni adjusted one-way ANOVA was used to statistically compare growth inhibition of the ophthalmic solutions. Formulations were tested for pH, presence of particles, and osmolarity. RESULTS All six ophthalmic formulations resulted in significant growth inhibition of M. catarrhalis (P < 0. 001). Clear eye drops based on clarithromycin powder for solution for injection performed best in terms of growth inhibition, followed by two <b>suspension</b> <b>eye</b> drops and preserved eye drops based on oral tablets (P < 0. 001). The preserved eye drop was the only ophthalmic formulation that met the ideal pharmaceutical criteria (pH 6. 9, osmolarity 0. 319 osmol/L). The patient’s ocular infection successfully resolved after intensive treatment with no significant residual ocular damage at two months. CONCLUSION Clear clarithromycin eye drops based on oral tablets {{seem to be the}} most suitable ocular clarithromycin formulation: they showed excellent growth inhibition and met product specifications that are favourable for the prevention of ocular irritation. We therefore advocate the use of this extemporaneously prepared solution in absence of registered clarithromycin ophthalmic formulations or powder for solution for injection...|$|E

We encountered a rare case of acute anterior uveitis and optic neuritis associated with influenza A infection. Case presentation: A 70 -year-old man presented with symptoms of {{upper respiratory tract}} infection. A rapid diagnostic test showed a positive result for influenza A. At the same time, he developed ocular symptoms including blurred vision with optic disk edema and hemorrhage in the left eye, and bilateral red eyes. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction performed on aqueous humor sample detected no viral infection. Visual field testing with a Goldmann perimeter showed central and paracentral scotomas in the left eye. In addition to antiviral agent (oseltamivir phosphate 75 mg), the patient was prescribed topical prednisolone acetate ophthalmic <b>suspension</b> <b>eye</b> drops every 5 hours and high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone 1, 000 mg daily for 3 days. Two months later, his best-corrected visual acuity improved to 20 / 50 with regression of visual field defects in his left eye. Conclusion: We report a case of bilateral acute anterior uveitis and unilateral optic neuritis concomitant with influenza A infection. Topical and systemic corticosteroids were effective to resolve acute anterior uveitis and neuritis. Analysis of aqueous humor sample suggested that acute anterior uveitis and optic neuritis in this case were not caused by influenza A virus infection per se but by autoimmune mechanism.

40|$|AbstractTo reach {{a better}} {{understanding}} of the <b>suspension</b> of the <b>eye</b> in the orbit, an orbital mechanics model based upon finite-element analysis (FEA) has been developed. The FEA model developed contains few prior assumptions or constraints (e. g., the position of the eye in the orbit), allowing modeling of complex three-dimensional tissue interactions; unlike most current models of eye motility. Active eye movements and forced ductions were simulated and showed that the supporting action of the orbital fat plays an important role in the <b>suspension</b> of the <b>eye</b> in the orbit and in stabilization of rectus muscle paths...|$|R

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} amnion epithelial cell(AEC) suspension liquid on the biological behavior of the rabbit's corneal epithelium, combined with the in vitro and in vivo experiments. METHODS: The rabbit's corneal epithelium were cultured in the lower chamber of transwell, and AEC suspension liquid was dropwised in the upper chamber. There was only culture medium in the upper chamber of the control group. The proliferation of rabbit's corneal epithelium was observed with CCK- 8 automated colorimetry and the expression of PCNA was detected by immunocytochemistry. We used the scratch wound assay to detect the migration of corneal epithelial cell(CEC). The in vivo models were established by placing a 10 mm diameter corneal trephine {{in the center of}} the cornea, within 1 mol/L NaOH for 1 min. We divided those into three groups: treatment group of AEC <b>suspension</b> liquid <b>eye</b> drop, AEC <b>suspension</b> liquid subconjunctival injection and the control group without any treatment. Using the slit-lamp biomicroscope and fluorescence staining to observe the cornea per week. After 28 d we took the eyeballs with the HE staining. The expression of VEGF was detected by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The activity of CEC with AEC treatment was much higher than the control group(P P In vivo, the inflammation of the corneal and the CNV of the AEC group were all significantly reduced compared with the control group(P P CONCLUSION: AEC suspension liquid can promote the proliferation and migration of the rabbit's corneal epithelium.

40|$|Purpose. To {{evaluate}} possible {{speeding up}} recovery time after retinal detachment (RD) surgery using biofeedback strategy. Methods. A total of 52 eyes were selected. After surgery, patients {{were divided into}} two groups: group A, including patients submitted to biofeedback with MP- 1 strategy; group B, patients who received common care strategy. Biofeedback strategy was started 15 days after the <b>suspension</b> of cycloplegic <b>eye</b> drops in buckling procedure or after silicone oil removal in the vitrectomized eyes. Controls were scheduled at baseline and 6, 12, and 18 weeks. Results. At baseline, {{there was no significant difference}} in BCVA between groups (P = 0. 4230). At the end of biofeedback treatment (WK 6) BCVA of group A was significantly better (P < 0. 001) than group B and BCVA was still better in group A than group B at WK 12 (P = 0. 028) and at WK 18 (P = 0. 041). Conclusions. Visual recovery after RD surgery is still unclear, and it does not depend on entity of the RD.

40|$|The eye {{presents}} unique {{opportunities and}} challenges {{when it comes to}} the delivery of Pharmaceuticals. While absorption by this route is bungling, there are few side effects with conventional ocular dosage forms like eye drops and <b>eye</b> <b>suspensions.</b> Several polymeric systems have been used to fabricate ocular inserts for better ocular bioavailability and retention of drug for which gelling systems have shown advantages of convenient administration and increased contact time. Fluconazole ocular films were prepared using film forming polymers namely; Hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose, poly vinyl pyrrolidine and poly vinyl alcohol. PEG- 400 was incorporated as plasticizer. Solvent casting technique was followed to prepare fluconazole ocular inserts. Seven formulations were formulated. The prepared ocular inserts were characterized by means of film thickness, weight variation, folding endurance and surface pH, and in- vitro drug release to determine the amount of drug release from selected film formulae using excised goat cornea. Ocular inserts prepared were smooth and passed all the evaluation tests performed. Formulation F 5 shows a maximum cumulative percentage drug release of 69. 02 % at the end of 2 hours through excised goat cornea.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to improve the bioavailability of forskolin by the influence of precorneal residence time and dissolution characteristics. Nanosizing is an advanced approach to overcome the issue of poor aqueous solubility of active pharmaceutical ingredients. Forskolin nanocrystals have been successfully manufactured and stabilized by poloxamer 407. These nanocrystals have been characterized in terms of particle size by scanning electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering. By formulating Noveon AA- 1 polycarbophil/poloxamer 407 platforms, at specific concentrations, it was possible to obtain a pH and thermoreversible gel with a pH(gel) /T-gel close to eye pH/temperature. The addition of forskolin nanocrystals did not alter the gelation properties of Noveon AA- 1 polycarbophil/poloxamer 407 and nanocrystal properties of forskolin. The formulation was stable over a period of 6 months at room temperature. In vitro release experiments indicated that the optimized platform was able to prolong and control forskolin release for more than 5 h. The in vivo studies on dexamethasone-induced glaucomatous rabbits indicated that the intraocular pressure lowering efficacy for nanosuspension/hydrogel systems was 31 % and lasted for 12 h, which is significantly better than the effect of traditional <b>eye</b> <b>suspension</b> (18 %, 4 - 6 h). Hence, our investigations successfully prove that the pH and thermoreversible polymeric in situ gel-forming nanosuspension with ability of controlled drug release exhibits a greater potential for glaucoma therapy...|$|R
40|$|The eye {{presents}} remarkable {{open doors}} and difficulties regarding {{the matter of}} the transport of Pharmaceuticals. While ingestion by this course is botching, there are few symptoms with routine visual dose structures like the eye drop and the <b>eye</b> <b>suspension.</b> A few polymeric frameworks have been utilized to create visual supplements for the better visual bioavailability and maintenance of medication for which the gelling frameworks have indicated focal points of advantageous organization and expanded contact time. Solvent casting technique was used for preparing PVP/PVA ocular inserts. The arranged ocular inserts were portrayed by method for film thickness, weight variety, collapsing persistence Value, XRD, DSC, SEM. These days, the utilization of polymers in therapeutic requisitions blankets an expansive assorted qualities of fields including inserts, prostheses, ophthalmology, dentistry and bone repair; they assume an imperative part as a provisional framework, a makeshift obstruction, and a medication conveyance framework. Poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) and poly(vinyl Alcohol) (PVA) are incorporated in the rundown of engineered polymers which are utilized as a part of solution. PVP has a great notoriety because of its remarkable assimilation and buildings capacities, inasmuch as PVA presents imperative characteristics, for example, high hydrophilicity, perceived biodegradability, biocompatibility and great processability in film form shaping.

40|$|Background: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the efficacy and safety of 0. 025 % levocabastine hydro-chloride in Japanese subjects with seasonal allergic conjunctivitis and its duration of action using the conjuncti-val allergen challenge (CAC) test. Methods: Twenty-four asymptomatic subjects were randomized to instill 0. 025 % levocabastine ophthalmic <b>suspension</b> in one <b>eye</b> and vehicle in the other eye 10 minutes before the CAC test. Signs and symptoms of al-lergic conjunctivitis were scored 10, 15, and 25 minutes after the CAC test. The duration of drug effects was also evaluated by allergen rechallenge 4 hours after levocabastine administration. The itching score for each eye as the primary efficacy endpoint was assessed 15 minutes after the CAC test using a 5 -point scale. Results: The mean itching score in the levocabastine-treated group was 0. 08 ± 0. 06, which was significantly lower than the mean score of 1. 98 ± 0. 16 in the vehicle group (P< 0. 0001). The redness and chemosis of the conjunctiva were also improved significantly compared with the vehicle group. Levocabastine showed pro-longed efficacy in inhibiting itching (0. 42 ± 0. 12 vs 0. 94 ± 0. 17, P< 0. 0002) and redness (1. 04 ± 0. 18 vs 1. 42 ± 0. 22, P < 0. 01) of the conjunctiva upon the rechallenge test. No significant topical or systemic adverse safety findings were observed in the levocabastine group.

40|$|Parameters like zone reading, {{inoculum}} density, and plate streaking {{influence the}} {{precision and accuracy}} of disk diffusion antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST). While improved reading precision has been demonstrated using automated imaging systems, standardization of the inoculum and of plate streaking have not been systematically investigated yet. This study analyzed whether photometrically controlled inoculum preparation and/or automated inoculation could further improve the standardization of disk diffusion. Suspensions of Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 of 0. 5 McFarland standard were prepared by 10 operators using both visual comparison to turbidity standards and a Densichek photometer (bioMérieux), and the resulting CFU counts were determined. Furthermore, eight experienced operators each inoculated 10 Mueller-Hinton agar plates using a single 0. 5 McFarland standard bacterial suspension of E. coli ATCC 25922 using regular cotton swabs, dry flocked swabs (Copan, Brescia, Italy), or an automated streaking device (BD-Kiestra, Drachten, Netherlands). The mean CFU counts obtained from 0. 5 McFarland standard E. coli ATCC 25922 suspensions were significantly different for <b>suspensions</b> prepared by <b>eye</b> and by Densichek (P < 0. 001). Preparation by eye resulted in counts that were closer to the CLSI/EUCAST target of 10 (8) CFU/ml than those resulting from Densichek preparation. No {{significant differences in the}} standard deviations of the CFU counts were observed. The interoperator differences in standard deviations when dry flocked swabs were used decreased significantly compared to the differences when regular cotton swabs were used, whereas the mean of the standard deviations of all operators together was not significantly altered. In contrast, automated streaking significantly reduced both interoperator differences, i. e., the individual standard deviations, compared to the standard deviations for the manual method, and the mean of the standard deviations of all operators together, i. e., total methodological variation...|$|R
