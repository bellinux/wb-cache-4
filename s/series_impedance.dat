2500|$|In {{respect of}} {{constant}} resistance filters, the term half section has {{a somewhat different}} meaning to other kinds of image filter. [...] Generally, a half section is formed by cutting through {{the midpoint of the}} <b>series</b> <b>impedance</b> and shunt admittance of a full section of a ladder network. [...] It is literally half a section. [...] Here, however, there is a somewhat different definition. [...] A half section is either the <b>series</b> <b>impedance</b> (series half-section) or shunt admittance (shunt half-section) that, when connected between source and load impedances of R0, will result in the same transfer function as some arbitrary constant resistance circuit. [...] The purpose of using half sections is that the same functionality is achieved with a drastically reduced component count.|$|E

40|$|Voltage biased, {{frequency}} multiplexed TES bolometers {{have become}} a widespread tool in mm-wave astrophysics. However, parasitic impedance and dynamic range issues can limit stability, performance, and multiplexing factors. Here, we present novel methods of overcoming these challenges, achieved through digital feedback, implemented on a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). In the first method, known as Digital Active Nulling (DAN), the current sensor (e. g. SQUID) is nulled in a separate digital feedback loop for each bolometer frequency. This nulling removes the dynamic range limitation on the current sensor, increases its linearity, and reduces its effective input impedance. Additionally, DAN removes constraints on wiring lengths and maximum multiplexing frequency. DAN has been fully implemented and tested. Integration for current experiments, including the South Pole Telescope, will be discussed.

It will be demonstrated that, for extended cable/overhead MV distribution networks with ungrounded neutral, in case of low resistance faults at critical locations along overhead lines, the neutral voltage can reach very large values, significantly higher than 1 p. u. (up to 2. 5 p. u.). The attendant temporary overvoltages on healthy phases can be very large, much higher than ? 3 p. u. (up to 3. 5 p. u.). Fault currents are also affected, reaching twice the value calculated with simplified methods, i. e. neglecting <b>series</b> <b>impedances.</b> Quick yet accurate analytical formulas for the prediction of maximum overvoltages, fault currents and critical fault distances are presented, together with their validation by detailed ATP-EMTP simulations.

50|$|Core {{losses are}} caused mostly by {{hysteresis}} and eddy current {{effects in the}} core and are proportional to {{the square of the}} core flux for operation at a given frequency. The finite permeability core requires a magnetizing current IM to maintain mutual flux in the core. Magnetizing current is in phase with the flux, {{the relationship between the two}} being non-linear due to saturation effects. However, all impedances of the equivalent circuit shown are by definition linear and such non-linearity effects are not typically reflected in transformer equivalent circuits. With sinusoidal supply, core flux lags the induced EMF by 90°. With open-circuited secondary winding, magnetizing branch current I0 equals transformer no-load current.The resulting model, though sometimes termed 'exact' equivalent circuit based on linearity assumptions, retains a number of approximations. Analysis may be simplified by assuming that magnetizing branch impedance is relatively high and relocating the branch to the left of the primary impedances. This introduces error but allows combination of primary and referred secondary resistances and reactances by simple summation as two <b>series</b> <b>impedances.</b>|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a new {{iterative}} backward/forward {{methodology for}} the load flow solution of weakly meshed systems with fixed voltage nodes is presented. Such technique models the loads at each iteration {{by means of}} impedances, and the PV nodes by means of reactances. Each iteration is organised in two steps. In the first, the radial network attained from the meshed system through cuts and composed of shunt and <b>series</b> <b>impedances</b> is solved. In the second step, based on a reduced Thévenin impedance matrix, the compensation currents to be injected in the cut nodes are deduced. Modelling the PV nodes by means of reactances allows the attainment, for the reactive power of these nodes, of the same precision {{that it is possible}} to get solving the network with the methods usually adopted for transmission networks. After the presentation of the different implementations of the backward/forward method proposed in the literature, the new technique and the relevant implementation are presented in detail. The methodology allows the solution of systems with meshes and PV nodes; test results show precision, speed and good convergence properties...|$|R

The proposed model is evaluated through measurements conducted in real cable configurations with a network analyzer. Finally, a novel method is proposed for the determination of the topology of residential power line circuits, based on the usage of appropriate neural networks.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method for}} obtaining {{a model of a}} single or a set of nonlinear loads (NLL) connected to a certain point of an electrical network. The basic assumption is that the network supplying the NLL has significant <b>series</b> <b>impedances</b> and is disturbed by other parallel, random, and unknown neighbor loads, sharing part of the supply system with the NLL. The main interest for obtaining the model is its further use to predict the amount and flow of harmonic currents generated by the NLL, in the case of adding a filter to reduce the harmonics distortion. The modeling technique used in the paper is based on multivariate multiple outputs regression and leads to a set of equations giving the NLL behavior (one for each of the harmonic currents). The model is obtained from data taken at measuring point and is only valid to predict the NLL behavior when new loads are connected at this point. The modeling method was first tested with V, I data coming from simulations using a MATLAB-Simulink SimPowerSystems toolbox. Finally, the method has been validated using V, I data taken in a real installation with different neighbor loads and under different load conditions. Postprint (published version...|$|R
