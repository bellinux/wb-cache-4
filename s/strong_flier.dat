5|$|As in {{the wings}} of modern birds, the flight {{feathers}} of Archaeopteryx were somewhat asymmetrical and the tail feathers were rather broad. This implies that the wings and tail were used for lift generation, but {{it is unclear whether}} Archaeopteryx was capable of flapping flight or simply a glider. The lack of a bony breastbone suggests that Archaeopteryx was not a very <b>strong</b> <b>flier,</b> but flight muscles might have attached to the thick, boomerang-shaped wishbone, the platelike coracoids, or perhaps, to a cartilaginous sternum. The sideways orientation of the glenoid (shoulder) joint between scapula, coracoid, and humerus—instead of the dorsally angled arrangement found in modern birds—may indicate that Archaeopteryx was unable to lift its wings above its back, a requirement for the upstroke found in modern flapping flight. According to a study by Philip Senter in 2006, Archaeopteryx was indeed unable to use flapping flight as modern birds do, but it may well have used a downstroke-only flap-assisted gliding technique.|$|E
25|$|The {{horn fly}} {{is known as}} a <b>strong</b> <b>flier,</b> and upon {{emerging}} as adults they can fly up to 10 miles to find a host. However, most often a horn fly will not have to fly more than three miles to find a host.|$|E
25|$|While it is a <b>strong</b> <b>flier,</b> {{it never}} flies rapidly or high. It has {{stronger}} and faster strokes than the plain tiger. The butterfly ranges forth {{in search of}} its host and nectar plants. It visits gardens where it nectars on the flowers of Adelocaryum, Cosmos, Celosia, Lantana, Zinnia, and similar flowers.|$|E
50|$|Palawan peacock-pheasants are <b>strong</b> <b>fliers.</b> Their {{flight is}} swift, direct and sustained.|$|R
50|$|Libythea is a {{widespread}} genus of nymphalid butterflies commonly called beaks or snouts. They are <b>strong</b> <b>fliers</b> and may even be migratory.|$|R
5000|$|Rhiginia is a New World genus in the {{subfamily}} Ectrichodiinae of Reduviidae (assassin bugs). Species of this genus {{are generally}} active, alert and <b>strong</b> <b>fliers.</b>|$|R
25|$|N. americanus {{is between}} 25 and 45mm long {{and can be}} {{identified}} by its striking, distinctive coloring. The body is shiny black, and on its wing covers are four scalloped, orange-red markings. Most distinctively, there is an orange-red marking on the beetle's pronotum, a large shield-like area just behind the head. N. americanus has orange facial markings and orange tips on their large antennae. The beetle is nocturnal and is a <b>strong</b> <b>flier,</b> moving {{as far as a}} kilometer in one night.|$|E
25|$|The hummingbird hawk-moth is {{distributed}} throughout the northern Old World from Portugal to Japan, but is resident only in warmer climates (southern Europe, North Africa, and points east). It is a <b>strong</b> <b>flier,</b> dispersing widely {{and can be found}} virtually anywhere in the hemisphere in the summer. However it rarely survives the winter in northern latitudes (e.g. north of the Alps in Europe, north of the Caucasus in Russia). They have been spotted in Newfoundland, Canada and Malaysia as well as southeast Texas, Southern California, and Northern Utah. There have also been reported sightings during the winter in Ireland.|$|E
500|$|The red-throated loon is a diurnal migrant, which travels singly or {{in loose}} groups, often {{high above the}} water. In eastern North America (and {{possibly}} elsewhere), it tends to migrate near the coast rather than farther offshore; Siberian populations travel for hundreds of miles over land en route to their southern European wintering grounds. It is a <b>strong</b> <b>flier,</b> and has been clocked at speeds between [...] Like all members of its family, the red-throated loon goes through a simultaneous wing moult, losing all its flight feathers at once and becoming flightless {{for a period of}} three to four weeks. Unlike other loons—which undergo this moult in late winter—the red-throated loon loses its ability to fly sometime between late summer and late autumn.|$|E
2500|$|Columbidae are {{generally}} <b>strong</b> <b>fliers</b> and effective colonisers, {{being able to}} make across ocean flights to access seasonal fruit supplies. [...] D. bicolor is partly migratory, its distribution changing according to food availability.|$|R
5000|$|Turacos {{are social}} birds, {{travelling}} in flocks of around ten to twelve individuals. They are not <b>strong</b> <b>fliers</b> {{but they can}} run quickly through the branches. [...] Violet turaco has a loud cooroo-cooroo call.|$|R
50|$|Tinamous are paleognaths {{related to}} the flightless ratites. They are {{probably}} close in appearance to the flying ancestors of the ratites. Unlike other ratites, tinamous can fly, although in general, they are not <b>strong</b> <b>fliers.</b>|$|R
500|$|The {{mourning}} dove (Zenaida macroura) {{is a member}} of the dove family, Columbidae. The bird is also known as the American {{mourning dove}} or the rain dove, and erroneously as the turtle dove, and was once known as the Carolina pigeon or Carolina turtledove. It is one of the most abundant and widespread of all North American birds. It is also a leading gamebird, with more than 20 million birds (up to 70million in some years) shot annually in the U.S., both for sport and for meat. Its ability to sustain its population under such pressure is due to its prolific breeding; in warm areas, one pair may raise up to six broods of two young each in a single year. The wings make an unusual whistling sound upon take-off and landing, a form of sonation. The bird is a <b>strong</b> <b>flier,</b> capable of speeds up to [...]|$|E
2500|$|The channel-billed cuckoo is the world's largest cuckoo, {{measuring}} between [...] {{long and}} weighing between [...] 24 adults {{were found to}} have averaged [...] in body mass. The bill is bi-coloured, with a grey base becoming straw-coloured at the tip. The bill is large slightly curved and reminiscent of the bills of hornbills; in fact, the bird is sometimes erroneously referred to as a hornbill. The plumage of the adult is pale grey on the head, chest, belly and back, becoming paler and barred lower down on the belly. The wings are darker grey with dark tips on the feathers. The tail is dark grey on top and barred underneath with a black band and white tip at the end. The feet and legs are black, and the eye is surrounded by prominent red skin. While most other very large cuckoos are rather terrestrial (i.e. roadrunners or the Neomorphus genus), the channel-billed cuckoo is fairly arboreal and is capable both in trees and on the ground. The channel-billed cuckoo is a <b>strong</b> <b>flier,</b> with a distinctive, almost hawk-like cruciform flight silhouette. In flight the wingspan is around 1m, with the wings held stiffly. There is some sexual dimorphism in both plumage and dimensions, the female having a smaller bill and paler, more barred undersides.|$|E
50|$|The {{horn fly}} {{is known as}} a <b>strong</b> <b>flier,</b> and upon {{emerging}} as adults they can fly up to 10 miles to find a host. However, most often a horn fly will not have to fly more than three miles to find a host.|$|E
50|$|All {{tinamous}} {{are from}} the family Tinamidae, and are the closest living relatives of the ratites. Unlike ratites, tinamous can fly, although in general, they are not <b>strong</b> <b>fliers.</b> All ratites evolved from prehistoric flying birds.|$|R
50|$|The most {{distinct}} case {{of sexual}} dimorphism {{is that of}} adult females of many Psychidae species who have only vestigial wings, legs, and mouthparts {{as compared to the}} adult males who are <b>strong</b> <b>fliers</b> with well-developed wings and feathery antennae.|$|R
5|$|Threskiornithidae is {{a family}} of large {{terrestrial}} and wading birds which includes the ibises and spoonbills. They have long, broad wings with 11 primary and about 20 secondary feathers. They are <b>strong</b> <b>fliers</b> and despite their size and weight, very capable soarers.|$|R
50|$|The females {{can grow}} up to 24 mm and the smaller males are 12 to 15 mm long. It is winged and a <b>strong</b> <b>flier,</b> pale green to {{yellowish}} green in color, with a yellow line running up the sides. The nymphs are brown or black in color and are burrowers.|$|E
50|$|The stripe-backed bittern is {{a solitary}} animal. It {{generally}} feeds {{at night on}} small fish, crustaceans and insects such as dragonflies and water beetles. It is not a <b>strong</b> <b>flier,</b> and only does so across short distances. When threatened, it responds by pointing its neck and bill skyward, a characteristic posture of bitterns.|$|E
50|$|While it is a <b>strong</b> <b>flier,</b> {{it never}} flies rapidly or high. It has {{stronger}} and faster strokes than the plain tiger. The butterfly ranges forth {{in search of}} its host and nectar plants. It visits gardens where it nectars on the flowers of Adelocaryum, Cosmos, Celosia, Lantana, Zinnia, and similar flowers.|$|E
50|$|Like other <b>strong</b> <b>fliers,</b> pompilids have a thorax {{modified}} for efficient flight. The metathorax is solidly {{fused to}} the pronotum and mesothorax; moreover, the prothorax is best developed in Pompilidae and Scoliidae because wasps in these families use their forelegs to dig.|$|R
50|$|Wild {{guineafowl}} are, without exception, <b>strong</b> <b>fliers.</b> Their breast {{muscles are}} dark, {{enabling them to}} sustain themselves in flight for considerable distances if hard-pressed. Grass and bush fires are a constant threat to these galliformes and flight {{is the most effective}} escape.|$|R
5|$|Threskiornithidae is {{a family}} of large {{terrestrial}} and wading birds which comprises the ibises and spoonbills. Its members have long, broad wings with 11 primary and about 20 secondary flight feathers. They are <b>strong</b> <b>fliers</b> and, despite their size and weight, very capable soarers.|$|R
50|$|The bee hummingbird is the {{smallest}} living bird. Females weigh 2.6 g an are 6.1 cm long, and are slightly larger than males, with an average weight of 1.95 g and length of 5.5 cm. As its name suggests, it is scarcely larger than a bee. Like all hummingbirds, it is a swift, <b>strong</b> <b>flier.</b>|$|E
50|$|Adults {{feed on the}} nectar of bramble, thistles, and knapweeds, {{and also}} on aphid honeydew. The silver-washed is a <b>strong</b> <b>flier,</b> and more mobile than other fritillaries, and, as such, can be seen gliding above the tree canopy at high speed. Its {{preferred}} habitat is thin, sunny, deciduous woodland, especially oaks, {{but it has been}} known to live in coniferous woodland.|$|E
5000|$|This {{butterfly}} primarily breeds on Scotch lovage (Ligusticum scoticum) and {{is often}} found very near the ocean where its larval stage food sources grow. It is especially fond of headlands with Scotch lovage {{and members of the}} parsley family (Apiaceae), including cow parsnip (Heracleum species), angelica (Angelica atropurpurea). It is a very <b>strong</b> <b>flier</b> so windy locations are not an issue.|$|E
50|$|Like other peafowl, {{crested argus}} retire on {{emergent}} trees above the forest canopy for many hours a day. They will remain on these trees {{for days at}} a time during the wet season. Crested argus are <b>strong</b> <b>fliers</b> and pairs have been reported flying together.|$|R
50|$|Like other petrels, their walking {{ability is}} limited, {{but they are}} <b>strong</b> <b>fliers,</b> with a stiff wing action quite unlike the gulls. They look bull-necked {{compared}} to gulls, and have short stubby bills. They are long-lived, with a lifespan of 31 years not uncommon.|$|R
50|$|Field lepidopterists have {{reported}} behavioural differences between L. reali and L. sinapis with Réal's being {{described as a}} <b>stronger</b> <b>flier</b> and with a preference for more open habitats. It had also been noted that specimens from Ireland thought to L. sinapis had a noticeably stronger green tinge.|$|R
50|$|The {{large white}} is a <b>strong</b> <b>flier</b> and the British {{population}} is reinforced in most years by migrations from the continent. Scattered {{reports of the}} large white from the north-eastern United States (New York, Rhode Island and Maine) {{over the past century}} are of a dubious nature and indicate either accidental transport or intentional release. Such introductions threaten to establish this agricultural pest in North America.|$|E
50|$|The lemon pansy is a {{very active}} {{butterfly}} and can be seen basking with its wings open facing the sun. It sits very {{low to the ground}} and can be approached easily. It feeds with its wings half open. It is a fairly <b>strong</b> <b>flier</b> and flies close to the ground with rapid wingbeats and often returns to settle back in the same spots.|$|E
50|$|N. americanus {{is between}} 25 and 45 mm long {{and can be}} {{identified}} by its striking, distinctive coloring. The body is shiny black, and on its wing covers are four scalloped, orange-red markings. Most distinctively, there is an orange-red marking on the beetle's pronotum, a large shield-like area just behind the head. N. americanus has orange facial markings and orange tips on their large antennae. The beetle is nocturnal and is a <b>strong</b> <b>flier,</b> moving {{as far as a}} kilometer in one night.|$|E
50|$|All tinamou {{are from}} the family Tinamidae, and in the larger scheme are also ratites. Unlike other ratites, {{tinamous}} can fly, although in general, they are not <b>strong</b> <b>fliers.</b> All ratites evolved from prehistoric flying birds, and tinamous are the closest living relative of these birds.|$|R
50|$|Female N. auletes have {{virtually}} no defenses but flight. Males are also <b>strong</b> <b>fliers</b> and can escape danger, but in addition, males can sound a loud alarm call to startle a predator or warn other cicadas {{in the area}} of danger. Both sexes can spray water at predators.|$|R
50|$|Grey-headed lovebirds are <b>strong</b> <b>fliers,</b> {{and when}} open, their wings seem larger in {{relation}} to their bodies than those of the peach-faced lovebird. They can develop good speed quite quickly and effortlessly, and turn smoothly, though they are not as nimble in the air as the peach-faced lovebirds.|$|R
