6000|$|After I {{had been}} there about ten or twelve days, it came into my {{thoughts}} that I should lose my reckoning of time for want of books, and pen and ink, and should even forget the sabbath days from the working days: but, to prevent this, I cut it with my knife upon a large post, in capital letters; and making it into a great cross, I set {{it up on the}} shore where I first landed, viz. [...] "I came on shore here on the 30th of September, 1659." [...] Upon the sides of this <b>square</b> <b>post</b> I cut every day a notch with my knife, and every seventh notch was as long again as the rest, and every first day of the month as long again as that long one: and thus I kept my calendar, or weekly, monthly, and yearly reckoning of time.|$|E
60|$|The reporters {{had written}} that {{but for the}} wide-brimmed hats the West was not visible upon these gauchos of the North. Heaven sharpen their eyes! The suit of black diagonal, {{wrinkled}} in impossible places; the bright blue four-in-hand, factory tied; the low, turned-down collar, pattern of the days of Seymour and Blair, white glazed as the letters on {{the window of the}} open-day-and-night-except-Sunday restaurants; the out-curve at the knees from the saddle grip; the peculiar spread of the half-closed right thumb and fingers from the stiff hold upon the circling lasso; the deeply absorbed weather tan that the hottest sun of Cape May can never equal; the seldom-winking blue eyes that unconsciously divided the rushing crowds into fours, as though they were being counted out of a corral; the segregated loneliness and solemnity of expression, as of an Emperor or of one whose horizons have not intruded upon him nearer than a day's ride--these brands of the West were set upon Greenbrier Nye. Oh, yes; he wore a broad-brimmed hat, gentle reader--just like those the Madison <b>Square</b> <b>Post</b> Office mail carriers wear when they go up to Bronx Park on Sunday afternoons.|$|E
60|$|Thus {{entered into}} as strange {{a scene of}} life as ever any man was in, I had most melancholy apprehensions {{concerning}} my deplorable condition: and many times the tears would plentifully run down my face, when I considered how I was debarred from all communications with human kind. Yet while these disponding cogitations would seem to make me accuse Providence, other good thoughts would interpose and reprove me after this manner: Well, supposing you are desolate, it is not better to be so than totally perish? Why, were you singled out to be saved and the rest destroyed? Why should you complain, when not only your life is preserved, but the ship driven into your reach, {{in order to take}} what was necessary out of her for your subsistence? But to proceed, it was, by the account I kept, the 30th of September, when I first landed on this island. About twelve days after, fearing lest I should lose my reckoning of time, nay, even forget the Sabbath days, for want of pen, ink, and paper, I carved with a knife upon a large post, in great letters; and set it up: in the similitude of a cross, on the seashore where I landed, I CAME ON SHORE, Sept. 30 1659. Every day I cut a notch with my knife {{on the sides of the}} <b>square</b> <b>post,</b> and this on the Sabbath was as long again as the rest; and every first day of the month as long again as that long one. In this manner I kept my calendar, weekly, monthly or yearly reckoning of time. But had I made a more strict search (as afterwards I did) I needed not have set up this mark; for among the parcels belonging to the gunner, carpenter, and captain's mate, I found those very things I wanted; particularly pens, ink, and paper. So I found two or three compasses, some mathematical instruments, dials, perspective glasses, books of navigation, three English Bibles, and several other good books, which I carefully put up.--Here I cannot but call to mind our having a dog and two cats on board, whom I made inhabitants with me in my castle. Though one might think I had all the necessities that were desirable, yet still I found several things wanting. My ink was daily wasting; I wanted needles, pins, and thread to mend or keep my clothes together; and particularly a spade, pickax, or shovel, to remove the earth. It was a year before I finished my little bulwark; and having some intervals of relaxation, after my daily wandering abroad for provision, I drew up this plan, alternately, as creditor and debtor, to remind me of the miseries and blessings of my life, under so many various circumstances.|$|E

60|$|In young plants the tendrils {{are about}} three inches in length: they bear two lateral and two {{terminal}} branches; and each branch bifurcates twice, with the tips terminating in blunt double hooks, having both points {{directed to the}} same side. All the branches are sensitive on all sides; and after being lightly rubbed, or after coming into contact with a stick, bend in about 10 m. One which had become curved in 10 m. after a light rub, continued bending for between 3 hrs. and 4 hrs., and became straight again in 8 hrs. or 9 hrs. Tendrils, which have caught nothing, ultimately contract into an irregular spire, as they likewise do, only much more quickly, after clasping a support. In both cases the main petiole bearing the leaflets, which is at first straight and inclined a little upwards, moves downwards, with the middle part bent abruptly into a right angle; but this is seen in E. miniatus more plainly than in E. scaber. The tendrils in this genus act in some respects like those of Bignonia capreolata; but the whole does not move from the light, nor do the hooked tips become enlarged into cellular discs. After the tendrils have {{come into contact with}} a moderately thick cylindrical stick or with rugged bark, the several branches may be seen slowly to lift themselves up, change their positions, and again come into contact with the supporting surface. The object of these movements is to bring the double-hooks at the extremities of the branches, which naturally face in all directions, into contact with the wood. I have watched a tendril, half of which had bent itself at right angles round the sharp corner of a <b>square</b> <b>post,</b> neatly bring every single hook into contact with both rectangular surfaces. The appearance suggested the belief, that though the whole tendril is not sensitive to light, yet that the tips are so, and that they turn and twist themselves towards any dark surface. Ultimately the branches arrange themselves very neatly to all the irregularities of the most rugged bark, so that they resemble in their irregular course a river with its branches, as engraved on a map. But when a tendril has wound round a rather thick stick, the subsequent spiral contraction generally draws it away and spoils the neat arrangement. So it is, but not in quite so marked a manner, when a tendril has spread itself over a large, nearly flat surface of rugged bark. We may therefore conclude that these tendrils are not perfectly adapted to seize moderately thick sticks or rugged bark. If a thin stick or twig is placed near a tendril, the terminal branches wind quite round it, and then seize their own lower branches or the main stem. The stick is thus firmly, but not neatly, grasped. What the tendrils are really adapted for, appears to be such objects as the thin culms of certain grasses, or the long flexible bristles of a brush, or thin rigid leaves such as those of the Asparagus, all of which they seize in an admirable manner. This is due to the extremities of the branches close to the little hooks being extremely sensitive to a touch from the thinnest object, which they consequently curl round and clasp. When a small brush, for instance, was placed near a tendril, the tips of each sub-branch seized one, two, or three of the bristles; and then the spiral contraction of the several branches brought all these little parcels close together, so that thirty or forty bristles were drawn into a single bundle, which afforded an excellent support.|$|E

40|$|Large {{aspect ratio}} 3 D microstructures (arrays of <b>square</b> <b>posts</b> and linear {{rectangular}} gratings) fabricated {{in a number}} of azobenzene-containing materials by soft lithography were manipulated by a single beam of polarized light. The materials exhibited different response to the beam orientation and the direction of light polarization. An elongation of the <b>square</b> <b>posts</b> both along and perpendicular to the polarization plane was observed depending on material. Reversibility of the deformation has been demonstrated. Broadening of the hills, amplitude and shape changing were observed for linear gratings. A slanted expose led to the blazed asymmetric structures. Some aspects of light-induced deformation mechanisms in azobenzene-containing materials are discussed. The approach developed in the paper can be useful both for the understanding of mass transport mechanism in azobenzene-containing materials and for the fabrication of diffracted optical structures...|$|R
