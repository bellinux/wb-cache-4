30|$|Serum vitamin D assay: using {{enzyme-linked}} immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Venous {{blood samples}} were collected then centrifuged to get serum. The kit {{was used for the}} quantitative measurement of total 25 -OH vitamin D 3 in serum. The assay utilizes a monoclonal antibody that binds to 25 -OH vitamin D 3. Assay calibrators, controls, and test samples are added directly to wells of a microtiter plate that is coated with specific anti- 25 -OH-vitamin D 3 antibody. A buffer designed to release vitamin D from binding proteins is then added to the wells. For the detection of the immune-complex, the well is incubated with a substrate solution in a timed reaction, which is terminated with acidic reagent (ELISA stop solution). The absorbance is then measured in a <b>spectrophotometric</b> <b>reader.</b> The enzymatic activity of the immune-complex bound to the wall of each microtiter well is inversely proportional to the amount of total 25 -OH vitamin D 3 in the test sample. A calibration curve is generated by plotting the absorbance versus the respective vitamin D concentration for each calibrator on a four-parameter or point-to-point curve fitting: vitamin D sufficiency ≥ 30 [*]ng/ml, vitamin D insufficiency 10 – 29 [*]ng/ml, and vitamin D deficiency <[*] 10 [*]ng/ml [12].|$|E
30|$|To {{monitor the}} amount of free DOX after {{immobilization}} on CNMs {{and the effectiveness of}} the DOX release, the ability of free DOX to fluorescent at a wavelength of 495  nm was used [27]. Active concentration of DOX was 16.7  % w/w from 3.34  mg/ml to 16.3  μg/ml. For the purpose of drawing the calibration lines, DOX Teva 20  mg/ml with ten dilutions to 8 [*]×[*] 10 − 3  mg/ml was used. Then, the fluorescence of free DOX was measured in supernatant from complexes DOX with UDD and OLC by <b>spectrophotometric</b> plate <b>reader</b> Multyscan (Labsystem, Finland).|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} version simply dispenses an allotted {{volume of}} liquid from a motorized pipette or syringe; more complicated machines can also manipulate {{the position of the}} dispensers and containers (often a Cartesian coordinate robot) and/or integrate additional laboratory devices, such as centrifuges, microplate readers, heat sealers, heater/shakers, bar code <b>readers,</b> <b>spectrophotometric</b> devices, storage devices and incubators.|$|R
30|$|In brief, 0.005 [*]×[*] 106 cells/well were seeded in 96 -well {{plates with}} {{different}} concentrations (100 – 0.3  μg/mL) of AgNPs and incubated for 2 to 5  days at 37  °C. The medium, DMEM, {{was supplemented with}} 4500  mg/L d-glucose, 4  mM l-glutamine, 110  mg/L sodium pyruvate, 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1 × penicillin-streptomycin, and non-essential amino acids (all purchased from Gibco-Invitrogen, USA). Control wells were treated with media alone, and cell proliferation was measured on day 3 and day 5. At these time points, Alamar Blue (1 : 10) was added to each well, and the plates were incubated at 37  °C for 4  h; then, the plates were read using a <b>spectrophotometric</b> microplate <b>reader</b> (Biotek Synergy 2; Biotek Instruments, USA), and the relative fluorescence unit (RFU) was recorded.|$|R
40|$|An {{agitated}} 12 -well {{microtiter plate}} {{system with a}} working volume of 2 ml was investigated for cell culture process development. Agitation assures homogeneity in wells and enhances mass transfer between the gas and the liquid phase, thus improving maximum cell density and pH stability. The pH of the NaHCO(3) -buffered system can be adjusted by altering the carbon dioxide content of the gas phase. The non-toxic, visual pH indicator phenol red was used in combination with a <b>spectrophotometric</b> plate <b>reader</b> for rapid and precise pH measurements. For high throughputs, cell growth was assessed non-invasively using stable green fluorescent protein (GFP) expressing cells and a fluorescence plate reader. The setup is simple and inexpensive. The system can be automated and allows several hundred small-scale bioreactor experiments to be run in parallel...|$|R
30|$|As chemosensitivity assay we {{used the}} SRB assay (Keepers et al 1991) rather than a clonogenic assay. For the present purpose, {{differences}} in chemosensitivity, we earlier demonstrated that the SRB assay is an appropriate assay (Keepers et al 1991; Pizao et al 1992; Ferreira et al 2000). Cells were transferred to 96 wells plates; on day one a serial dilution of one drug {{was added to the}} cells. The cells were incubated for 72  hours with drugs or for 4  hours with drugs and 68  hours with drug free medium. The relative amount of cells at drug addition was determined by fixing control wells at day 0 (drug addition) and processed as described below. The other (treated and control) cells were fixed after the incubation period, and washed and stained with SRB. The stained proteins were measured at 492  nm with an automated <b>spectrophotometric</b> microplate <b>reader</b> (Tecan, Salzburg, Austria); the measured optical density correlates with the amount of cells at the moment of fixing.|$|R
30|$|The {{cytotoxicity}} of GS, GS-PEG-Apt, and GS-PEG/HA 2 -Apt NPs {{was evaluated}} against A 549 cells using MTT assay. Briefly, A 549 cells (1 [*]×[*] 104  cells/well) were seeded in polystyrene 96 -well culture plates and incubated for 24  h till the 70  % confluence. The culture medium was then replaced by 100  μl of serum-free DMEM medium containing nanoparticles (100 – 600  mg/mL). Cells treated with medium only {{served as a}} negative control group. After 24  h co-incubation, cells were washed with PBS and incubated with 20  μL of MTT solution (5  mg ml− 1 in PBS buffer) for 4  h at 37  °C. Then, MTT solution was removed, and 100  μL of DMSO was added to dissolve the blue formazan crystal produced by proliferating cells. The plate was incubated for additional 30  min before determination at 570  nm using a <b>spectrophotometric</b> plate <b>reader</b> (Bio-tek ELX 800, USA). All experiments were performed in quadruplicate, and the relative cell viability (%) was expressed as a percentage relative to the untreated control cells.|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} confirm cell {{compatibility}} of the ESF and ESF-Hap composite scaffolds, hMSCs were cultured on the scaffolds. The ESF and ESF-Hap scaffolds were soaked in ethanol and sterilized using ultraviolet light, followed by washing with sterile PBS(pH 7.4). The scaffold disk {{was placed in}} a 96 -well tissue culture plate, followed by adding 100 μl of hMSC suspension with a concentration of about 5 × 105 cells/ml in each well. The cells were incubated at 37 °C with 5 % CO 2 for a period of 3, 5, and 7 days, respectively. The viability was measured using the 3 -(4, 5 -dimethyl) thiazol- 2 -yl- 2, 5 -dimethyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT, 5 mg/ml) method. The OD was measured at the wavelength of 595 nm using a <b>spectrophotometric</b> microplate <b>reader</b> (Perkin Elmer, Model: 2030 Explorer). The absorbance was proportional to the number of cells on the scaffolds. All samples were incubated at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2. Three parallel experiments were carried out for each sample.|$|R
30|$|Venous {{blood is}} {{collected}} into pre-chilled tubes containing an anticoagulant which is centrifuged {{to obtain the}} PPP. The PPP is then acidified by adding acetic acid to precipitate euglobulin fraction, and the supernatant is discarded. The euglobulin fraction is resuspended in borate solution, and clotting is initiated {{by the addition of}} thrombin or calcium chloride at 37  °C and observed for complete clot lysis upon addition of the test compound; this {{is referred to as the}} euglobulin lysis time (Nordby et al. 1980). In the recent times, this assay has been modified using a computerised kinetic <b>spectrophotometric</b> microtitre plate <b>reader,</b> wherein the absorbance of the recalcified euglobulin fraction over time is determined (Smith et al. 2003).|$|R
40|$|Introduction: In 2009, {{neutralizing}} autoantibodies against OPG (α-OPGAb) {{blocking the}} inhibitory effect of OPG on RANK signaling pathway {{were identified in}} a man with celiac disease associated with severe osteoporosis. Although this finding was not reproduced in thirty patients presenting coeliac disease and low bone mineral density, Hauser et al (2013) recently detected the presence of α-OPGAb in patients presenting Rheumatoid Arthritis, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, Spondyloarthritis and Osteoporosis. There is a growing focus on OPG autoantibodies as primary cause of high bone turnover in disorders with unknown etiology. Objective: To develop an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detection and quantification of α-OPGAb in patient serum samples. Method: A full-length human recombinant OPG is immobilized on a plate to allow capture of the antibodies from the sera. In a two-step reaction, the αOPGAb is detected using a biotinylated antibody and a horseradish peroxidase-labelled streptavidin. Substrate is incubated in a timed reaction and color development measured in a <b>spectrophotometric</b> microtiter plate <b>reader.</b> The concentration of human α-OPGAb in the samples is determined directly from a 4 PL-fit standard curve. Results: Intra-assay imprecision was < 5 % at 274. 4 ± 18. 8 and 98. 5 ± 2. 9 ng/mL. Inter-assay imprecision was < 20 % at 324. 2 ± 53. 3 and 166. 8 ± 30. 6 ng/mL. Linear range was 0 - 500 ng/mL. Lower and upper limit of quantification were 3. 9 and 500 ng/mL. Cross reactivity was assessed against human sera containing raised thyroid antibody and RANKL to ensure assay specificity. Using the method presented, we established that the adult population would be considered positive with a titer above the cut-off limit (95 %) of 68 ng/mL. Our preliminary data suggested that 14 % of our sample population (n= 136) presented elevated α-OPGAb. Conclusion: We presented a novel ELISA assay for the detection and measurement of anti-OPG autoantibodies in human serum. The validated method showed excellent assay characteristics and is suitable for use in research and clinical hospital laboratories. In patients with severe form of osteoporosis, measurement of OPG autoantibodies could help clinicians identify appropriate treatment options for this particular subgroup of patients...|$|R
