5|$|Right now, we are {{currently}} pursuing a long arch series for cable. We wondered, should we do a sequel to the first one or do we do a remake? We {{came up with a}} 'requel' – it's a sequel and a remake. We've been developing this for a while. It's a trilogy in four parts, and it really follows the continuing adventures of new people who are experiencing this phenomenon of a Klown invasion, {{and once in a while}} you <b>see</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old guys pop up and hear their stories – find out what happened over the last 25 years. It's fucking great.|$|E

As well as {{presenting}} {{a history of the}} V-weapons and of the site, the museum enables visitors to <b>see</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tunnels and a mock-up of the HDP gun. The tunnels also house memorials to Joseph Kennedy, the other bomber crew members killed during raids on the site, and the forced labourers who lost their lives during construction. In 2011, the museum had about 11,000 visitors, of whom 53% were French, 18% Belgian and 16% British.|$|E

5|$|The cloth {{on which}} the work was painted had been lined with a more finely woven piece of linen and restretched, {{probably}} by the same person who stretched and lined the other works identified with the larger altarpiece. It was placed under glass, probably in the early 19th century and certainly before its acquisition by the National Gallery (Eastlake noted that it was under glass in 1858). The piece was evidently sent rolled and unframed to its patron. The brown border painted along the four sides indicates where the frame should be positioned when it is added to its final support. The row of rust-stained nail holes running {{along the top of}} the cloth is evidence that the frame was eventually positioned within the pictorial field, at a point far lower than Bouts had intended. This low framing protected a portion of the canvas from deterioration and allows us to <b>see</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> colours as they would have originally appeared.|$|E

Many {{individuals}} {{are doing what they}} can, but real success can only come if there's a change in our societies and our economics and in our politics.

25|$|Day/night cricket, {{also known}} as Floodlit cricket is a cricket match that is played either totally, or more usually partially, under {{floodlights}} in the evening. The first regular cricket to be played under floodlights occurred during World Series Cricket, unsanctioned by the International Cricket Council, attracting large crowds to <b>see</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world's best players compete in Australia and the West Indies. In 1979, when the ICC and World Series Cricket came to an understanding, the first floodlit One Day International was played, also in Australia. Floodlit cricket has since been played around the world, although England was slow to take it up due to their climate.|$|E
25|$|The {{political}} situation in Singapore was stable. The PAP had a 15-year monopoly in parliament during 1966 to 1981, winning all seats in elections before J. B. Jeyaretnam of the Workers' Party of Singapore won the Anson constituency in a 1981 by-election. The PAP rule is termed authoritarian by activists who <b>see</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> regulations of political and media activities as an infringement on political rights, perceiving them as authoritarian. This has been the greatest complaint about the PAP by the opposition parties so far, the Workers' Party of Singapore and the Singapore Democratic Party being two of the prominent opposition parties who accuse the PAP of authoritarianism.|$|E

500|$|A {{temporary}} interactive visitors center, {{dubbed the}} [...] "Discovery Channel Center" [...] was also constructed during the project. The center provided a simulated {{ride to the}} top of the monument, and shared information with visitors during phases in which the monument was closed. The majority of the project's phases were completed by summer 2000, allowing the monument to reopen July 31, 2000. The monument temporarily closed again on December 4, 2000 to allow a new elevator cab to be installed, completing the final phase of the restoration project. The new cab included glass windows, allowing visitors to <b>see</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 194 memorial stones embedded in the monument's walls. The installation of the cab took much longer than anticipated, and the monument did not reopen until February 22, 2002. The final cost of the restoration project was $10.5 million.|$|E
500|$|Grant Park, {{which is}} between Lake Michigan {{and the central}} {{business}} district, is commonly called [...] "Chicago's Front Yard". [...] Its northwest corner had been Illinois Central rail yards and parking lots until 1997, when it was made available for development by the city as Millennium Park. Millennium Park was conceived in 1998 as the capstone of Grant Park, to celebrate the new millennium and to feature world-renowned architects, artists, designers, landscape architects, and urban planners. As of 2007, Millennium Park trails only Navy Pier as a Chicago tourist attraction. The fountain is centrally located in Chicago: it is east of Michigan Avenue and its Historic Michigan Boulevard District, north of Monroe Street and the Art Institute of Chicago; and south of Madison Street. Looking north from the fountain, viewers <b>see</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tallest buildings in the United States (Aon Center, Two Prudential Plaza, and One Prudential Plaza).|$|E

500|$|... 1UP.com {{reviewer}} Jose Otero {{was critical}} of Halo 4s story, writing that {{the ending of the}} game [...] "doesn't make a lot of sense". He also remarked that while the narrative tied the main plot lines together well, it was disappointing to <b>see</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> smaller story points were ignored entirely. Both G4 and Official Xbox Magazine agreed that the plot became convoluted on occasions and might be difficult to understand for new players of the franchise. [...] G4 reviewer, Adam Rosenburg, also stated that while the soundtrack had some memorable moments, he was disappointed that composer Neil Davidge had chosen to ditch the familiar theme of previous games. [...] Michael Gapper of Computer and Video Games drew a comparison between Halo 4 and Halo 2. [...] He stated that the hardware limitations of the Xbox 360 had negatively impacted Halo 4s campaign, {{in the same way that}} they had throttled Bungie's ambitions for Halo 2 on the original Xbox. He explained that although the game was visually stunning, this had detracted from the scale and spectacle that was present in Halo 3s campaign. He found the spaces within the campaign to be narrow and constrained which led to a lack of tactical options in encounters.|$|E
500|$|... "Grotesque" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Reviewer Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A− {{and noted that}} while the episode is [...] "ponderous and pretentious", {{this aspect of the}} entry turns it into [...] "a benefit". VanDerWerff wrote, [...] "here's the thing: 'Grotesque' is absolutely [...] self-serious, just as much as I feared it would be. It also, unquestionably, works. The reason it works is very simple: It's pretty scary". Critical Myth's John Keegan gave the episode a largely positive review, awarding it an 8 out of 10. He noted, [...] "Overall, this is a solid effort by Howard Gordon. It’s good to <b>see</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> methods that earned Mulder his nickname, and the underlying dynamic between Mulder and Scully is very well played. The central premise is vague enough to fall {{within the confines of the}} unusual, if not necessarily paranormal, and the supporting cinematography and score rise to the occasion." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode five stars out of five, and praised the themes of the episode, writing that, [...] "Because 'Grotesque' certainly surprises, and shocks, and even appals —this is the closest The X-Files ever gets to staring into the face of insanity." [...] Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson praised Duchovny's acting, calling it [...] "his best performance yet seen in the series". Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a positive review and awarded it three-and-a-half stars out of four. She referred to the episode as [...] "one of [...] darkest ever" [...] and called it [...] "a triumph for director Manners, cinematographer Bartley, and The X-Files art department." [...] Vitaris, however, was critical of the episode's closing monologue, noting that [...] " [...] spells out what the camera is saying a hundred times more effectively with its finale shot of a pairing of a gargoyle." [...] Jonathan Dunn, writing for What Culture, described [...] "Grotesque" [...] as a [...] "deep, dark, twisted psychological moment for The X-Files that I absolutely love" [...] and included it in the [...] "5 Episodes [...] That Could Be Made Into Movies" [...] list.|$|E
500|$|The {{anniversary of}} the game was not widely commemorated until its silver anniversary in 1987. By that time, the NBA had grown to be a popular sports league with average {{attendance}} of 13,000 fans per game and star players like Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, and Michael Jordan. The Warriors' PR director Harvey Pollack said an impossible 40,000 people claimed to have seen the game, and some even testified it took place in Madison Square Garden. Chamberlain later stated {{it was one of}} his favorite games, but not the favorite: that title belonged to the match in which he grabbed an NBA record 55 rebounds against perennial rival Bill Russell. He did not want to feed the criticism that he was more interested in personal stardom than winning. Although Chamberlain won two NBA championships and was the NBA's all-time leading scorer and rebounder when he retired, he was mostly remembered as the man who had single-handedly scored 100 points in a game. Chamberlain publicly embraced the 100-point game in his final years. On a radio show commemorating the game's 31st anniversary in 1993, he said, [...] "As time goes by, I feel more a part of that 100-point game." [...] He explained that growing up on the streets, he would have been derisively labelled a gunner, a glory-hound, for attempting 63shots. [...] "You take that many shots on the playground, and no one ever wants you on their team again." [...] He said he took shots he normally would not, noting that in contests which he considered to be better he scored 50 to 60 points on around 75 percent shooting, as opposed to his 57 percent shooting in the 100-point game. He was proud that people who knew nothing about basketball would point out the game to their kids when they saw him. [...] "I know that it has been my tag. I am definitely proud of it. But it was definitely a team effort. You had to <b>see</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> things my teammates did to get me the ball ... It was almost like a circus out there for a while." ...|$|E
