30|$|Main energy {{demanding}} {{processes of}} FPH manufacture are hydrolysation, concentration and drying steps. Drying at industrial scale is mostly utilized by <b>spray</b> <b>dryers</b> and, thus, their performance must be evaluated {{for making a}} conclusion on energy status of the operation. Moisture evaporation rate for most <b>spray</b> <b>dryers</b> {{is found in the}} range between 600 and 41, 000  kg/h (Baker and McKenzie 2005). Some pilot models of <b>spray</b> <b>dryers</b> have specific energy consumption in the range between 3 000 and 5500  kJ/kg of evaporated water (Al-Mansour et al. 2011), but the real heat consumption by industrial models of <b>spray</b> <b>dryers</b> is much higher. The average energy consumption for industrial <b>spray</b> <b>dryers</b> is in the range between 4 500 and 11 500  kJ/kg (Mujumdar 2007). The review, devoted to energy efficiency of <b>spray</b> <b>dryers</b> with respect to the industry, revealed the average energy consumption for food production as 4880  kJ/kg of evaporated water in the case of multi-stage <b>spray</b> <b>dryers</b> (Baker and McKenzie 2005).|$|R

50|$|The nano <b>spray</b> <b>dryer</b> offers new {{possibilities}} {{in the field}} of spray drying. Particles can be produced in the range of 300 nm to 5 μm with a narrow size distribution. High yields, up to 90%, can be produced and the minimal sample amount is 1 mL.|$|E
5000|$|Spray drying is {{a process}} of turning liquids into powder; many <b>spray</b> <b>dryers</b> also have the drops of liquid solidifying as they drop in a tower.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} type of <b>spray</b> <b>dryers</b> are called single effect. There is a single source of drying air {{at the top of the}} chamber (see n°4 on the diagram). In most cases the air is blown in the same {{direction}} as the sprayed liquid (co-current). A fine powder is produced, but it can have poor flow and produce a lot of dust. To overcome the dust and poor flow of the powder, a new generation of <b>spray</b> <b>dryers</b> called multiple effect <b>spray</b> <b>dryers</b> have been produced. Instead of drying the liquid in one stage, drying is done through two steps: the first at the top (as per single effect) and the second with an integrated static bed at the bottom of the chamber. The bed provides a humid environment which causes smaller particles to clump, producing more uniform particle sizes, usually within the range of 100 to 300 µm. These powders are free-flowing due to the larger particle size.|$|R
30|$|The {{drying process}} of FPH is usually {{accomplished}} by {{a limited number}} of drying apparatus: they are typically <b>spray</b> <b>dryers</b> which provide convectional drying, and vacuum freeze dryers and roller drum dryers which utilize contact heat supply. From the experience, the authors suggest convection <b>spray</b> <b>dryers</b> as the most used drying systems at large scale in FPH production due to a satisfactory productivity, reasonable quality of the final FPH and a relative easiness of operation. The term “spray dryer” is used in this article to describe convectional spray dryers; the authors do not devote the work to spray drying using radiation or mixed heat transfer.|$|R

50|$|One {{drawback}} with {{spray drying}} {{is that the}} particles it produces are too fine to be used effectively by the consumer; they must first be either steam-fused in towers similar to <b>spray</b> <b>dryers</b> or by belt agglomeration to produce particles of suitable size.|$|R
50|$|In December 1983, Stan Davis {{purchased}} a creamery in Lake Norden, South Dakota.

50|$|Flue-gas {{desulfurization}} (FGD) {{materials are}} produced by chemical “scrubber” emission control systems that remove sulfur and oxides from power plant flue gas streams. FGD comprises 24 percent of all coal combustion waste. Residues vary, but the most common are FGD gypsum (or “synthetic” gypsum) and <b>spray</b> <b>dryer</b> absorbents. FGD gypsum is used in almost thirty percent of the gypsum panel products manufactured in the U.S. It is also used in agricultural applications to treat undesirable soil conditions and to improve crop performance. Other FGD materials are used in mining and land reclamation activities.|$|E
50|$|In <b>spray</b> <b>dryer</b> absorbers, {{the flue}} gases are {{introduced}} into an absorbing tower (dryer) where the gases are contacted with a finely atomized alkaline slurry. Acid gases are {{absorbed by the}} slurry mixture and react to form solid salts which are removed by the particulate control device. The heat of the flue gas is used to evaporate all the water droplets, leaving a non-saturated flue gas to exit the absorber tower. Spray dryers are capable of achieving high (80+%) acid gas removal efficiencies. These devices have been used on industrial and utility boilers and municipal waste incinerators.|$|E
50|$|A <b>spray</b> <b>dryer</b> takes {{a liquid}} stream and {{separates}} the solute or suspension as a solid and the solvent into a vapor. The solid is usually {{collected in a}} drum or cyclone. The liquid input stream is sprayed through a nozzle into a hot vapor stream and vaporized. Solids form as moisture quickly leaves the droplets. A nozzle is usually {{used to make the}} droplets as small as possible, maximizing heat transfer and the rate of water vaporization. Droplet sizes can range from 20 to 180 μm depending on the nozzle.There are two main types of nozzles: high pressure single fluid nozzle (50 to 300 bars) and two-fluid nozzles: one fluid is the liquid to dry and the second is compressed gas (generally air at 1 to 7 bars).|$|E
40|$|Spray drying is an {{efficient}} unit operation applied in food drying that demands a high {{amount of energy}} compared to vacuum evaporation and membrane filtration.

40|$|The {{disposal}} of different residues containing {{high concentrations of}} heavy metals causes environmental problems. To understand the effects of various properties of the residues on the evaporation and leaching rates of heavy metals (Cd, Pb, Zn, Cr, and Cu) by thermal treatment, three types of residues (including bottom ash, <b>spray</b> <b>dryer</b> ash, and baghouse ash) generated from various incineration conditions including <b>spray</b> <b>dryer</b> additives (SiO 2, CaCl 2, and NaHCO 3), and feedstock additives [polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and NaCl] were investigated in the present study.

The leaching rate of heavy metals in the <b>spray</b> <b>dryer</b> ash was less than 20 % before the thermal treatment when Ca(OH) (2) was used in the <b>spray</b> <b>dryer.</b> The addition of PVC could increase the evaporation rate of Zn in the <b>spray</b> <b>dryer</b> ash, whereas the addition of NaCl could decrease the leaching rate of Zn and Cu in the baghouse ash after the thermal treatment...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a {{user-friendly}} model for spray drying that can aid in the development of a pharmaceutical product, by shifting from a trial-and-error towards a quality-by-design approach. To achieve this, a <b>spray</b> <b>dryer</b> model was developed in commercial and open source spreadsheet software. The output of the model was first fitted to the experimental output of a Buchi B- 290 <b>spray</b> <b>dryer</b> and subsequently validated. The predicted outlet temperatures of the <b>spray</b> <b>dryer</b> model matched the experimental values very well over the entire range of <b>spray</b> <b>dryer</b> settings that were tested. Finally, the model was applied to produce glassy sugars by spray drying, an often used excipient in formulations of biopharmaceuticals. For the production of glassy sugars, the model was extended to predict the relative humidity at the outlet, which is not measured in the <b>spray</b> <b>dryer</b> by default. This extended model was then successfully used to predict whether specific settings were suitable for producing glassy trehalose and inulin by spray drying. In conclusion, a <b>spray</b> <b>dryer</b> model was developed that is able to predict the output parameters of the spray drying process. The model can aid the development of spray dried pharmaceutical products by shifting from a trial-and-error towards a quality-by-design approach. ...|$|E

40|$|A {{pilot scale}} micro-fluidic-spray-dryer (MFJSD-II) {{utilizing}} a single-stream atomization to produce mono-disperse particles {{has been developed}} at Monash University. A unique feature of this unit {{is the use of}} relatively low air velocities in the range of 10 (- 1) - 10 (- 2) m s(- 1), which increases the residence time of the particles during the drying process, in comparison with conventional <b>spray</b> <b>dryers.</b> In this study, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation revealed that the effects of natural convection, caused by heat loss from the wall, were significant in deflecting the flows of air from the central jet-side recirculation pattern, causing them to spread towards the wall. The flow patterns formed a layer of relatively high velocity region adjacent to the wall. The understanding of these flow patterns would be crucial for future designs of low-velocity <b>spray</b> <b>dryers.</b> The spreading of the central jet towards the wall also created recirculation regions {{in the center of the}} tower, thus affecting the residence times particularly for smaller particles. More numerical simulations are required to optimize the design of the bottom bustle to be effectively used as a particle-separator. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Spray drying is a {{well-established}} method {{used in the}} food industry for production of powders, such as dry milk, coffee, tea, and soup. The operating conditions of <b>spray</b> <b>dryers</b> depend on the product and chamber design. Thus scaling up the process is complex, and simulation tools are needed to reduce time and cost, and to enhance quality of the final product. In this study a validated distributed-parameter model for predicting drying of single particles was combined with a CFD simulation model of an eight-meter pilot dryer to investigate drying kinetics of skim milk powders. A qualitative assessment {{of the effect of}} water diffusivity values on preconditions for agglomeration and a multi-scale analysis of coalescence and agglomeration regions were performed. Results showed that accurate water diffusivity values and sticky conditions have to be implemented when modelling spray drying to investigate preconditions for coalescence and agglomeration. The results also showed the need to simulate surface conditions of particles during spray drying to predict probable regions of coalescence and agglomeration. In conclusion, the applied methodology allows understanding of the stickiness ability of a product and size of the chamber.
