5|$|Sorabji's fugues, {{the most}} atonal of his works, {{generally}} follow traditional methods. After a <b>subject</b> <b>and</b> {{between one and}} four countersubjects have been presented in an exposition, there follows a development section in which the <b>subject</b> (<b>and</b> countersubjects, particularly in the earlier fugues) are usually developed in their original form and in inversion, retrograde and retrograde inversion. The movement continues with a stretto and concludes with a section featuring augmentation and a thickening of lines into chords. His multi-subject fugues repeat this pattern for each <b>subject,</b> <b>and</b> combine thematic material from all expositions in the last section. The fugues are more conservative than most of his output, in that they rarely use polyrhythms. They can contain up to six subjects, and it is these that mark Sorabji's fugues as different from most others. Some of the subjects are among his most unconventional melodic creations, lacking the frequent changes of direction that characterise most melodies; other subjects are possibly the longest ever conceived. This has led some people either to treat them with suspicion or to criticise them.|$|E

Whatever the case, the wording of the passage shows that Eusebius is unenthusiastic about his <b>subject</b> <b>and</b> skeptical of its significance.
