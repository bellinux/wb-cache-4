25|$|Knowledge of the <b>sphericity</b> of the Earth survived {{into the}} medieval corpus of {{knowledge}} by direct {{transmission of the}} texts of Greek antiquity (Aristotle), and via authors such as Isidore of Seville and Beda Venerabilis.|$|E
25|$|Early Islamic {{scholars}} recognized earth's <b>sphericity,</b> leading Muslim mathematicians {{to develop}} spherical trigonometry {{in order to}} further mensuration and to calculate the distance and direction from any given point on the Earth to Mecca. This determined the Qibla, or Muslim direction of prayer.|$|E
25|$|Johannes de Sacrobosco (c.1195 – c.1256AD) wrote {{a famous}} work on Astronomy called Tractatus de Sphaera, based on Ptolemy, which {{primarily}} considers {{the sphere of}} the sky. However, it contains clear proofs of the earth's <b>sphericity</b> in the first chapter.|$|E
25|$|In Brockport, New York, in 1887, M.C. Flanders {{argued the}} case of a flat Earth for three nights against two {{scientific}} gentlemen defending <b>sphericity.</b> Five townsmen chosen as judges voted unanimously for a flat Earth at the end. The case was reported in the Brockport Democrat.|$|E
25|$|In 1746, {{the volcano}} was {{explored}} by French academicians from the French Geodesic Mission. Their {{mission was to}} determine the <b>sphericity</b> of the Earth. Their work along with another team in Lapland established that the Earth was an oblate spheroid rather than a true sphere. They did not reach the summit of Chimborazo.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} the Coriolis force on {{ballistic}} trajectories {{should not be confused}} with the curvature of the paths of missiles, satellites, and similar objects when the paths are plotted on two-dimensional (flat) maps, such as the Mercator projection. The projections of the three-dimensional curved surface of the Earth to a two-dimensional surface (the map) necessarily results in distorted features. The apparent curvature of the path is a consequence of the <b>sphericity</b> of the Earth and would occur even in a non-rotating frame.|$|E
25|$|The figure, {{at first}} glance delicate, feminine, wearing a necklace, graceful with a {{classical}} allure, is constructed {{with a series of}} faceted planar forms that together form a tight cohesive structure. The head, with its stylish coiffure, and the models facial features are simply constructed with only a few surface planes juxtaposed at seemingly right angles. Even the vase, upon close examination, appears treated in geometric terms, its <b>sphericity</b> broken by an angular cut to the right, barely visible in the photograph.|$|E
25|$|Some {{authorities}} {{have suggested that}} the <b>sphericity</b> of the Earth was among the aspects of Vergilius's teachings that Boniface and Zachary considered objectionable. Others have considered this unlikely, and take the wording of Zachary's response to indicate at most an objection to belief in the existence of humans living in the antipodes. In any case, there is no record of any further action having been taken against Vergilius. He was later appointed bishop of Salzburg, and was canonised in the 13th century.|$|E
25|$|Although the Chinese of the Han Dynasty (202 BC–202 AD) {{believed}} the Moon to be energy equated to qi, their 'radiating influence' theory {{recognized that the}} light of the Moon was merely a reflection of the Sun (mentioned by Anaxagoras above). This was supported by mainstream thinkers such as Jing Fang, who noted the <b>sphericity</b> of the Moon. Shen Kuo (1031–1095) of the Song Dynasty (960–1279) created an allegory equating the waxing and waning of the Moon to a round ball of reflective silver that, when doused with white powder and viewed from the side, would appear to be a crescent.|$|E
25|$|Portuguese {{navigation}} {{down and}} around the coast of Africa {{in the latter half}} of the 1400s gave wide-scale observational evidence for Earth's <b>sphericity.</b> In these explorations, the sun's position moved more northward the further south the explorers travel. Its position directly overhead at noon gave evidence for crossing the equator. These apparent solar motions in detail were more consistent with north-south curvature and a distant sun, than with any flat-earth explanation. The ultimate demonstration came when Ferdinand Magellan's expedition completed the first global circumnavigation in 1521. Antonio Pigafetta, one of the few survivors of the voyage, recorded the loss of a day in the course of the voyage, giving evidence for east-west curvature. No flat-earth theory could reconcile the daily apparent motions of the sun with the ability to sail around the world, and the loss of a day could make no sense, either.|$|E
25|$|With {{the end of}} Roman civilization, Western Europe {{entered the}} Middle Ages with great {{difficulties}} that affected the continent's intellectual production. Most scientific treatises of classical antiquity (in Greek) were unavailable, leaving only simplified summaries and compilations. Still, many textbooks of the Early Middle Ages supported the <b>sphericity</b> of the Earth. For example: some early medieval manuscripts of Macrobius include maps of the Earth, including the antipodes, zonal maps showing the Ptolemaic climates derived from {{the concept of a}} spherical Earth and a diagram showing the Earth (labeled as globus terrae, the sphere of the Earth) {{at the center of the}} hierarchically ordered planetary spheres. Further examples of such medieval diagrams can be found in medieval manuscripts of the Dream of Scipio. In the Carolingian era, scholars discussed Macrobius's view of the antipodes. One of them, the Irish monk Dungal, asserted that the tropical gap between our habitable region and the other habitable region to the south was smaller than Macrobius had believed.|$|E
500|$|Zhang Heng viewed these astronomical {{phenomena}} in supernatural terms as well. The signs of comets, eclipses, and movements of heavenly bodies {{could all be}} interpreted by him as heavenly guides on how to conduct affairs of state. Contemporary writers also wrote about eclipses and the <b>sphericity</b> of heavenly bodies. The music theorist and mathematician Jing Fang (78–37BC) wrote about the spherical shape of the Sun and Moon while discussing eclipses: ...|$|E
500|$|The {{caricature}} {{of the period}} is also reflected in some more specific notions. One misconception, first propagated in the 19th century and still very common, is that all people in the Middle Ages believed that the Earth was flat. This is untrue, as lecturers in the medieval universities commonly argued that evidence showed the Earth was a sphere. Lindberg and Ronald Numbers, another scholar of the period, state that there [...] "was scarcely a Christian scholar of the Middle Ages who did not acknowledge [...] <b>sphericity</b> and even know its approximate circumference". Other misconceptions such as [...] "the Church prohibited autopsies and dissections during the Middle Ages", [...] "the rise of Christianity killed off ancient science", or [...] "the medieval Christian Church suppressed the growth of natural philosophy", are all cited by Numbers as examples of widely popular myths that still pass as historical truth, although they are not supported by current historical research.|$|E
500|$|Zhang applied his {{extensive}} knowledge of mechanics and gears {{in several of}} his inventions. He invented the world's first water-powered armillary sphere to assist astronomical observation; improved the inflow water clock by adding another tank; and invented the world's first seismoscope, which discerned the cardinal direction of an earthquake [...] away. He improved previous Chinese calculations for pi. In addition to documenting about 2,500 stars in {{his extensive}} star catalog, Zhang also posited theories about the Moon {{and its relationship to}} the Sun: specifically, he discussed the Moon's <b>sphericity,</b> its illumination by reflected sunlight {{on one side and the}} hidden nature of the other, and the nature of solar and lunar eclipses. His fu (rhapsody) and shi poetry were renowned in his time and studied and analyzed by later Chinese writers. Zhang received many posthumous honors for his scholarship and ingenuity; some modern scholars have compared his work in astronomy to that of the Greco-Roman Ptolemy (AD86–161).|$|E
500|$|Later, the {{physical}} {{form of the}} Moon {{and the cause of}} moonlight became understood. The ancient Greek philosopher Anaxagoras [...] reasoned that the Sun and Moon were both giant spherical rocks, and that the latter reflected the light of the former. Although the Chinese of the Han Dynasty believed the Moon to be energy equated to qi, their 'radiating influence' theory also recognized that the light of the Moon was merely a reflection of the Sun, and Jing Fang (78–37BC) noted the <b>sphericity</b> of the Moon. In the 2nd century AD Lucian wrote a novel where the heroes travel to the Moon, which is inhabited. In 499AD, the Indian astronomer Aryabhata mentioned in his Aryabhatiya that reflected sunlight is the cause of the shining of the Moon. The astronomer and physicist Alhazen (965–1039) found that sunlight was not reflected from the Moon like a mirror, but that light was emitted from every part of the Moon's sunlit surface in all directions. Shen Kuo (1031–1095) of the Song dynasty created an allegory equating the waxing and waning of the Moon to a round ball of reflective silver that, when doused with white powder and viewed from the side, would appear to be a crescent.|$|E

2500|$|A {{recent study}} of medieval {{concepts}} of the <b>sphericity</b> of the Earth noted that [...] "since the eighth century, no cosmographer worthy of note has called into question the <b>sphericity</b> of the Earth." [...] However, the work of these intellectuals {{may not have had}} significant influence on public opinion, {{and it is difficult to}} tell what the wider population may have thought of the shape of the Earth, if they considered the question at all.|$|E
2500|$|Andalusian polymath Ibn Hazm {{stated that}} the proof of the Earth's <b>sphericity</b> [...] "is that the Sun is always {{vertical}} to a particular spot on Earth".|$|E
2500|$|Whereas {{a number}} of {{previous}} Greek philosophers presumed the earth to be spherical, Aristotle (384–322 BC) is the one to be credited with proving the Earth's <b>sphericity.</b> Those arguments may be summarized as follows: ...|$|E
2500|$|This {{analogy with}} a curved egg led some modern historians, notably Joseph Needham, to {{conjecture}} that Chinese astronomers were, after all, {{aware of the}} Earth's <b>sphericity.</b> The egg reference, however, was rather meant to clarify the relative position of the flat earth to the heavens: ...|$|E
2500|$|Theological doubt {{informed}} by the flat Earth model implied in the Hebrew Bible inspired some early Christian scholars such as Lactantius, John Chrysostom and Athanasius of Alexandria, but this remained an eccentric current. Learned Christian authors such as Basil of Caesarea, Ambrose and Augustine of Hippo were clearly aware of the <b>sphericity</b> of the Earth. [...] "Flat Earthism" [...] lingered longest in Syriac Christianity, which tradition laid greater importance on a literalist interpretation of the Old Testament. Authors from that tradition, such as Cosmas Indicopleustes, presented the Earth as flat as late as in the 6th century. This last remnant of the ancient model of the cosmos disappeared during the 7th century. From the 8th century and the beginning medieval period, [...] "no cosmographer worthy of note has called into question the <b>sphericity</b> of the Earth." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Sphericity,</b> or {{deviation}} from spherical form, refers {{to how much}} the ball deviates from a true spherical form (out of roundness). This is measured by rotating a ball against a linear transducer with a gauge force of less than [...] The resulting polar graph is then circumscribed with the smallest circle possible {{and the difference between}} this circumscribed circle and the nominal ball diameter is the variation.|$|E
2500|$|The {{works of}} the {{classical}} Indian astronomer and mathematician, Aryabhatta (476–550 AD), deal with the <b>sphericity</b> of the Earth and {{the motion of the}} planets. The final two parts of his Sanskrit magnum opus, the Aryabhatiya, which were named the Kalakriya ("reckoning of time") and the Gol ("sphere"), state that the Earth is spherical and that its circumference is 4,967 yojanas. In modern units this is , close to the current equatorial value of [...]|$|E
2500|$|Bede was lucid about earth's <b>sphericity,</b> writing [...] "We {{call the}} earth a globe, {{not as if}} {{the shape of a}} sphere were {{expressed}} in the diversity of plains and mountains, but because, if all things are included in the outline, the earth's circumference will represent the figure of a perfect globe... For truly it is an orb placed in the centre of the universe; in its width it is like a circle, and not circular like a shield but rather like a ball, and it extends from its centre with perfect roundness on all sides." ...|$|E
2500|$|For {{its main}} {{use as a}} {{fertilizer}} urea is mostly marketed in solid form, either as prills or granules. The advantage of prills is that, in general, they can be produced more cheaply than granules and that the technique was firmly established in industrial practice long before a satisfactory urea granulation process was commercialized. [...] However, {{on account of the}} limited size of particles that can be produced with the desired degree of <b>sphericity</b> and their low crushing and impact strength, the performance of prills during bulk storage, handling and use is generally (with some exceptions) considered inferior to that of granules.|$|E
2500|$|The first direct {{demonstration}} of Earth's <b>sphericity</b> {{came in the}} form of the first circumnavigation in history, an expedition captained by Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan. The expedition was financed by the Spanish Crown. On August 10, 1519, the five ships under Magellan's command departed from Seville. They crossed the Atlantic Ocean, passed through what is now called the Strait of Magellan, crossed the Pacific, and arrived in Cebu, where Magellan was killed by Philippine natives in a battle. His second in command, the Spaniard Juan Sebastián Elcano, continued the expedition and, on September 6, 1522, arrived at Seville, completing the circumnavigation. Charles I of Spain, in recognition of his feat, gave Elcano a coat of arms with the motto Primus circumdedisti me (in Latin, [...] "You went around me first").|$|E
2500|$|The monk Bede (c.672–735) {{wrote in}} his {{influential}} treatise on computus, The Reckoning of Time, that the Earth was round. He explained the unequal length of daylight from [...] "the roundness of the Earth, for not without reason is it called 'the orb of the world' {{on the pages of}} Holy Scripture and of ordinary literature. It is, in fact, set like a sphere {{in the middle of the}} whole universe." [...] (De temporum ratione, 32). The large number of surviving manuscripts of The Reckoning of Time, copied to meet the Carolingian requirement that all priests should study the computus, indicates that many, if not most, priests were exposed to the idea of the <b>sphericity</b> of the Earth. Ælfric of Eynsham paraphrased Bede into Old English, saying, [...] "Now the Earth's roundness and the Sun's orbit constitute the obstacle to the day's being equally long in every land." ...|$|E
2500|$|The English theologian Bede (c. 672–735) {{wrote in}} his {{influential}} treatise on computus, The Reckoning of Time, that the Earth was round ('not merely circular like a shield [...] spread out like a wheel, but resembl more a ball'), explaining the unequal length of daylight from [...] "the roundness of the Earth, for not without reason is it called 'the orb of the world' {{on the pages of}} Holy Scripture and of ordinary literature.

2500|$|Bishop Isidore of Seville (560–636) {{taught in}} his widely read encyclopedia, the Etymologies, diverse views {{such as that}} the Earth [...] "resembles a wheel" [...] {{resembling}} Anaximander in language and the map that he provided. This was widely interpreted as referring to a disc-shaped Earth. An illustration from Isidore's De Natura Rerum shows the five zones of the earth as adjacent circles. Some have concluded that he thought the Arctic and Antarctic zones were adjacent to each other. He did not admit the possibility of antipodes, which he took to mean people dwelling {{on the opposite side}} of the Earth, considering them legendary and noting that there was no evidence for their existence. Isidore's T and O map, which was seen as representing a small part of a spherical Earth, continued to be used by authors through the Middle Ages, e.g. the 9th-century bishop Rabanus Maurus who compared the habitable part of the northern hemisphere (Aristotle's northern temperate clime) with a wheel. At the same time, Isidore's works also gave the views of <b>sphericity,</b> for example, in chapter 28 of De Natura Rerum, Isidore claims that the sun orbits the earth and illuminates the other side when it is night on this side. See French translation of De Natura Rerum. In his other work Etymologies, there are also affirmations that the sphere of the sky has earth in its center and the sky being equally distant on all sides. Other researchers have argued these points as well. [...] "The work remained unsurpassed until the thirteenth century and was regarded as the summit of all knowledge. It became an essential part of European medieval culture. Soon after the invention of typography it appeared many times in print." [...] However, [...] "The Scholastics - later medieval philosophers, theologians, and scientists - were helped by the Arabic translators and commentaries, but they hardly needed to struggle against a flat-earth legacy from the early middle ages (500-1050). Early medieval writers often had fuzzy and imprecise impressions of both Ptolemy and Aristotle and relied more on Pliny, but they felt (with one exception), little urge to assume flatness." ...|$|E
60|$|On the {{way back}} to Stawell {{we had a chance to}} see a group of {{boulders}} called the Three Sisters--a curiosity oddly located; for it was upon high ground, with the land sloping away from it, and no height above it from whence the boulders could have rolled down. Relics of an early ice-drift, perhaps. They are noble boulders. One of them has the size and smoothness and plump <b>sphericity</b> of a balloon of the biggest pattern.|$|E
6000|$|Thus inevitably {{does the}} {{universe}} wear our color, and every object fall successively into the subject itself. The subject exists, the subject enlarges; all things {{sooner or later}} fall into place. As I am, so I see; use what language we will, we can never say anything but what we are; Hermes, Cadmus, Columbus, Newton, Bonaparte, are the mind's ministers. Instead of feeling a poverty when we encounter a great man, let us treat the new comer like a travelling geologist who passes through our estate and shows us good slate, or limestone, or anthracite, in our brush pasture. The partial action of each strong mind in one direction is a telescope for the objects on which it is pointed. But every other part of knowledge is to be pushed to the same extravagance, ere the soul attains her due <b>sphericity.</b> Do you see that kitten chasing so prettily her own tail?

How long before our masquerade will end its noise of tambourines, laughter, and shouting, and we shall find it was a solitary performance?

"This {{combination}} of characters, rightly considered, is {{in a high}} [...] degree instructive, affording an insight into the probable [...] comparative distance of stars and nebulæ, and the real [...] brightness of individual stars as compared with one another.

50|$|Developed in 1940 by John W. Mauchly, Mauchly's test of <b>sphericity</b> is {{a popular}} test to {{evaluate}} whether the <b>sphericity</b> assumption has been violated. The null hypothesis of <b>sphericity</b> and alternative hypothesis of non-sphericity in the above example can be mathematically written in terms of difference scores.|$|E
50|$|While Mauchly’s test {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} used to evaluate <b>sphericity,</b> the test fails to detect departures from <b>sphericity</b> in small samples and over-detects departures from <b>sphericity</b> in large samples. Consequently, the sample size has an influence on the interpretation of the results. in practice, the assumption of <b>sphericity</b> is extremely unlikely to be exactly met so it is prudent to correct for a possible violation without actually testing for a violation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sphericity</b> is an {{important}} assumption of a repeated-measures ANOVA. It refers to the condition where the variances {{of the differences between}} all possible pairs of within-subject conditions (i.e., levels of the independent variable) are equal. The violation of <b>sphericity</b> occurs when it is not the case that the variances of the differences between all combinations of the conditions are equal. If <b>sphericity</b> is violated, then the variance calculations may be distorted, which would result in an F-ratio that would be inflated. <b>Sphericity</b> can be evaluated when there are three or more levels of a repeated measure factor and, with each additional repeated measures factor, the risk for violating <b>sphericity</b> increases. If <b>sphericity</b> is violated, a decision must be made as to whether a univariate or multivariate analysis is selected. If a univariate method is selected, the repeated-measures ANOVA must be appropriately corrected depending on the degree to which <b>sphericity</b> has been violated.|$|E
50|$|The test {{statistic}} for these estimates is denoted by epsilon (ε) {{and can be}} found on Mauchly’s test output in SPSS. Epsilon provides a measure of departure from <b>sphericity.</b> By evaluating epsilon, we can determine the degree to which <b>sphericity</b> has been violated. If the variances of differences between all possible pairs of groups are equal and <b>sphericity</b> is exactly met, then epsilon will be exactly 1, indicating no departure from <b>sphericity.</b> If the variances of differences between all possible pairs of groups are unequal and <b>sphericity</b> is violated, epsilon will be below 1. The further epsilon is from 1, the worse the violation.|$|E
