25|$|Traditionally, {{contact lenses}} for {{keratoconus}} {{have been the}} 'hard' or RGP variety, although manufacturers have also produced specialized 'soft' or hydrophilic lenses and, most recently, <b>silicone</b> <b>hydrogel</b> lenses.

To counter this, hybrid lenses have been developed which are hard in the centre and encompassed by a soft skirt.

The fourth generation of hybrid lens technology has improved, giving more people an option that combines the comfort of a soft lens with the visual acuity of an RGP lens.|$|E

25|$|One {{specific}} research {{topic of}} interest is how microbes such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa invade the eye and cause infection. Although the pathogenesis of microbial keratitis is not well understood, many different factors have been investigated. One group of researchers showed that corneal hypoxia exacerbated Pseudomonas binding to the corneal epithelium, internalization of the microbes, and induction of the inflammatory response. One way to alleviate hypoxia {{is to increase the}} amount of oxygen transmitted to the cornea. Although silicone-hydrogel lenses almost eliminate hypoxia in patients due to their very high levels of oxygen transmissibility, they also seem to provide a more efficient platform for bacterial contamination and corneal infiltration than other conventional hydrogel soft CLs. A recent study showed that Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermis adhere much more strongly to unworn <b>silicone</b> <b>hydrogel</b> CLs than conventional hydrogel lenses and that adhesion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 20 times stronger than that of Staphylococcus epidermidis. This might partly explain why Pseudomonas infections are the most predominant. However, another study conducted with worn and unworn silicone and conventional hydrogel CLs showed that worn silicone CLs were less prone to Staphylococcus epidermidis colonization than conventional hydrogel lenses.|$|E

METHODS 	Investigations into ciprofloxacin uptake and release characteristics, {{and the possibility of}} their eventual clinical applications were elucidated through three broad experiments: •	In the first experiment (Chapter 3), the uptake and release characteristics of commercially available contact lenses, both <b>hydrogels</b> and <b>silicone</b> <b>hydrogels,</b> were examined in vitro. •	In the second experiment (Chapter 4), novel contact lens materials were manufactured using a molecular imprinting strategy to modify in vitro ciprofloxacin release characteristics. •	In the final experiment (Chapter 5), utilizing the results gleaned from the first two experiments, contact lenses were manufactured using the molecular imprinting strategy. The material properties of the novel lenses were evaluated. The antibacterial activity of these lenses were evaluated both in vitro and in an in vivo rabbit model of microbial keratitis. RESULTS 	Examination of commercial contact lens materials for their ciprofloxacin delivery potential demonstrated a measurable difference between the different lens types, with the hydrogel lenses taking up more ciprofloxacin and releasing more over time. <b>Silicone</b> <b>hydrogels</b> as a group did not release as much antibiotic as the hydrogels, but neither group of lenses were able to release the antibiotic for any extended periods of time. 	Novel materials created using a molecular imprinting strategy demonstrated substantial improvements to release times measured in vitro. Some of the materials were able to demonstrate sustained release within the vials for up to two weeks. The molecular imprinting strategy was subsequently applied to contact lenses manufactured in-house, which were shown to have similar contact lens properties to lenses already on the market. Testing of the lenses in vitro and in vivo demonstrated a superior profile in eradicating pathogenic bacteria in models of microbial keratitis. CONCLUSIONS 	The results from this thesis detail the potential for novel, custom-made contact lenses with extended ciprofloxacin releasing characteristics. These novel lenses may influence or be a part of future treatment paradigms for ocular infections...|$|R

[...] A lens hindering passage of oxygen to the cornea causes corneal hypoxia which can result in serious complications, such as corneal ulcer that, if left untreated, can permanently decrease vision.

The frictional energy varied from about 0. 03 mJ to 0. 08 mJ. The results indicated a moderate correlation (Pearson's R = 0. 79, P = 3. 4 %) between the frictional energy and cell damage. The authors believe that these results support the notion that cell damage can be caused by fatigue.

This Eulogy to RGPs will demonstrate why it has. A recent survey of international contact lens prescribing trends shows that rigid lenses constituted less than 5 % of all contact lenses prescribed in 16 out of 27 nations surveyed. This compares with rigid lenses representing 100 % of all lenses prescribed 1965 and about 40 % in 1990).

Orthokeratology is largely a fringe application of marginal efficacy, and the notion that rigid lenses arrest myopia progression is flawed. That last bastion of rigid lens practice – fitting patients with severely distorted corneas as in keratoconus – is about to crumble in view of a number of demonstrations by independent research groups of the efficacy of custom-designed wavefront-corrected soft contact lenses for the correction of keratoconus.

40|$|Purpose To {{document}} contact lens prescribing {{patterns in}} the United States between 2002 and 2014. Methods A survey of contact lens prescribing trends was conducted each year between 2002 and 2014, inclusive. Randomly selected contact lens practitioners {{were asked to provide}} information relating to 10 consecutive contact lens fits between January and March each year. Results Over the 13 -year survey period, 1650 survey forms were received from US practitioners representing details of 7702 contact lens fits. The mean (±SD) age of lens wearers was 33. 6 (± 15. 2) years, of whom 65. 2 % were female. Rigid lens new fits decreased from 13. 0 % in 2002 to 9. 4 % in 2014. Across this period, <b>silicone</b> <b>hydrogels</b> have replaced mid water contact lens hydrogels as the soft lens material of choice. Toric lenses represented about 25 to 30 % of all soft lens fits. Multifocal soft lenses are generally preferred to monovision. Daily disposable lens fits have recently increased, and in 2014, they represented 27. 1 % of all soft lens fits. Most lenses are prescribed on 1 to 2 weekly or monthly lens replacement regimen.

40|$|Purpose: To assess current {{recommendations}} by optometrists for replacement frequency (RF) of <b>silicone</b> <b>hydrogels</b> (SH) {{and daily}} disposable (DD) contact lenses in Canada, determine rates of non-compliance with recommendations {{by both the}} optometrist and patient, and investigate reasons for non-compliance. Methods: Survey packages were sent to optometrists in Canada who had agreed to participate. Patients completed survey questions regarding demographics and contact lens wearing patterns, including recommended and actual contact lens RF. Optometrists {{were asked to provide}} lens information and their recommendation for RF. Fifty-eight optometrists returned 654 surveys, of which 578 were eligible for analysis. Results: Seventy percent of patients were female with a median age of 32 years. Lens type distribution was 18 % DD, 35 % two-week SH, and 47 % one-month SH. Six percent were worn for extended wear. Daily wear median wearing time was 12 hours/day, a median of five days/week for DD, seven days/week for SH (two-week and one-month). Optometrists’ recommendations were non-compliant with the manufacturers’ recommended RF for 6 % of DD, 35 % of two week, and 2 % of one-month patients. Patients were non-compliant with recommendations from both the manufacturer and optometrist for 12 % of DD, 43 % of two-week, and 31 % of one-month lens wearers. The most common reason for non-compliance was forgetting which day to replace lenses. Fifty-six percent thought a reminder system would help with compliance. A higher proportion of compliant patients followed the RF because of confidence in their optometrist. Conclusions: Optometrists generally recommended RFs consistent with manufacturers’ recommendations for DD and one-month SH lenses but often recommended longer intervals for two-week SH lenses. Patients were most compliant when wearing DD lenses and least compliant when wearing two-week SH lenses. Communication between the patient and optometrists concerning the risks of non-compliance, or initiating a reminder system might improve compliance...|$|R

Methods: 59 young subjects (25. 7 ± 4. 5 years) were recruited. Refractive error {{was limited to}} ± 4. 50 DS and ≤ 0. 75 DC. Subjects did not wear their habitual CLs at least 3 days prior to the first visit. Visual acuity (VA), an anterior eye health check, non-invasive keratograph breakup time (mean and first NIKBUT) with Oculus 5 M, dry eye symptoms with OSDI and CLDQ- 8 were completed at the baseline visit. On the following day, subjects were fitted with a Silicone-Hydrogel (SiHy) lens in one eye and a Hydrogel (Hy) lens in the other. Four hours later subjects returned and one material for both eyes was chosen according to VA, CL fitting, comfort and NIKBUT. Results: 42 subjects were fitted with SiHy and 17 with Hy. No statistically {{significant differences were found}} between right and left eye for mean and first NIKBUT parameters at baseline (p= 0. 38 and p= 0. 50, respectively) and for post 4 hours CL wear (p= 0. 61 and p= 0. 06). At the follow-up visit, there were no changes in VA and the CL fit (p> 0. 05). The comfort rating changed according to OSDI from 14. 1 ± 2. 7 at baseline visit to 10. 5 ± 2. 2 (p= 0. 004). CLDEQ 8 showed 9. 4 ± 7. 9 for habitual lens compared to 5. 0 ± 7. 1 for the chosen lens (p= 0. 304).

METHODS 	 PRG 4 was investigated for its effects on commercial contact lenses. Both bovine PRG 4 and recombinant human PRG 4 (rhPRG 4) were examined on six <b>silicone</b> <b>hydrogels</b> (balafilcon A, senofilcon A, lotrafilcon B, comfilcon A, delefilcon A, narafilcon A) and one conventional hydrogel (etafilcon A). Lens parameters, such as material wettability, bacterial adhesion and viability, and location of sorbed PRG 4, were investigated in the following: •	The effect of PRG 4 on the wettability of both commercially available <b>silicone</b> and conventional <b>hydrogel</b> lens materials was investigated in vitro. Additionally, the substantivity of PRG 4 onto the lens surface was also examined (Chapter 3) •	Using a novel labeling technique, rhPRG 4 was fluorescently tagged and visualized, using confocal microscopy, to elucidate the sorption profile within various commercial lens materials (Chapter 4) •	The antibacterial effect of bovine PRG 4 - and rhPRG 4 -treated lenses was investigated. Staphylococcus aureus was radiolabeled with 3 H-uridine and the bacterial suspension was exposed to various lenses. The total bacterial adhesion was measured by using a Beta counter to detect the 3 H isotope, and viability was determined using an agar plate counting method for each lens type (Chapter 5) RESULTS 	The lens material largely influences how PRG 4 interacts with the contact lens. The presence of a surface treatment and/or ionically charged monomers has {{a significant impact on}} the wettability and sorption of PRG 4. Generally, the incorporation of PRG 4 onto relatively hydrophobic surfaces appears to enhance the surface wettability, though PRG 4 exhibited greater substantivity on relatively hydrophilic surfaces. 	PRG 4 did not demonstrate significant antibacterial properties against S. aureus. However, PRG 4 did not significantly increase bacterial adhesion, even though proteins on lens surfaces are known to attract more bacteria. In addition, it is possible that PRG 4 is denatured to a certain extent within the lens, which may ultimately serve as a source of nutrients for the bacteria to thrive on. Future work is required to investigate this supposition. CONCLUSIONS 	The results from this thesis have demonstrated that PRG 4 can have a significant positive impact on lens material wettability and perhaps other metrics as well, which can possibly translate to enhanced lens wear comfort and lower drop-out rates. Since the lens composition is the major contributing factor in how PRG 4 interacts with the material, lens manufacturers can potentially use this information to develop lenses to better incorporate PRG 4 for various wear modalities. The unique combination of contact lens and PRG 4 is a fairly novel area of research and has the potential for future additional studies...|$|R

40|$|Solute uptake {{and release}} govern the {{efficacy}} of hydrogels in controlled drug delivery, tissue engineering, and chromatographic separations. In soft contact lenses, uptake and release of wetting, packaging, and care-solution agents is extensively employed to improve on-eye lens performance. Key physical parameters are the equilibrium solute partition coefficient and the solute diffusion coefficient in the gel that dictate the amounts and rates of uptake/release, respectively. To investigate the mechanisms of solute uptake and release in hydrogels, this work experimentally and theoretically determines equilibrium partition and diffusion coefficients of prototypical macromolecules and drugs in hydrogels {{over a wide range}} of water contents. A hydrogel is a crosslinked polymer network with water-filled voids arranged in an unstructured three-dimensional mesh. Solutes (e. g., drugs, sugars, proteins, polymers) typically partition into and diffuse through the water-filled mesh but are excluded from mesh voids smaller than solute size. Consequently, solute size and the distribution of mesh sizes in the hydrogel-polymer network are vital to understand solute uptake and release. Solutes may also exhibit specific interactions with and, accordingly, adsorb to hydrogel polymer chains by hydrogen bonding or counterion binding. Specific solute adsorption to hydrogel-polymer strands results in larger partition coefficients and diminished effective diffusion rates. To elucidate size effects on aqueous-solute transport rates, diffusion coefficients of large macromolecules in hydrogels with relatively small mesh sizes are investigated experimentally and theoretically. Two photon-confocal microscopy measures transient uptake and release concentration profiles of fluorescently labeled dextrans of varying molecular weight, and fluorescently labeled cationic avidin protein. Dextrans are highly water-soluble polysaccharides. Consequently, they exhibit negligible specific interactions with the hydrogel polymer network. Hydrogel uptake and release follow Fick’s second law with almost identical diffusion coefficients in the uptake and release directions. To interpret our data, we implement a Large Pore Effective Medium (LPEM) model taking into account hydrodynamic drag, steric obstruction, and the distribution of mesh sizes available for solute transport. All necessary parameters are measured independently. In all cases, a priori- predicted diffusion coefficients by LPEM theory display excellent agreement with experiment. In contrast to the nonspecific interacting dextrans, cationic avidin protein exhibits near irreversible adsorption with incomplete loading even after 6 days and incomplete release even after two weeks. Avidin protein uptake and release rates clearly highlight the significance of solute-specific adsorption in understanding solute transport rates in hydrogels. Despite its importance, little attention has been given to how solute-specific interactions affect solute uptake in and release from hydrogels. We measure and theoretically predict partition and diffusion coefficients for prototypical water-soluble drugs in hydrogels where solute-specific binding is pronounced. Hydrogel composition is varied by adjusting the ratio of monomer constituents, 2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) and methacrylic acid (MAA). Partition and diffusion coefficients are obtained through two-photon confocal microscopy and UV/Vis-absorption spectrophotometry upon back extraction. The studied prototypical drugs all exhibit specific adsorption to nonionic MAA and HEMA moieties characterized by greater-than-unity partition coefficients and smaller effective diffusion rates. Conversely, none of the prototypical drugs displayed specific interactions with anionic MAA moieties. To predict equilibrium partition coefficients, we express the partition coefficient as a product of the hydrogel water content and individual enhancement factors for size-exclusion, nonspecific electrostatic interactions, and specific adsorption. Again, all necessary parameters are obtained independently. To predict effective diffusion coefficients, we extend LPEM for specific-solute adsorption and impose local equilibrium. As with the non-interacting dextran solutes, predicted partition and diffusion coefficients are in good agreement with experiment. A framework is now available to predict solute partitioning and diffusion in solute-hydrogel systems that exhibit specific interactions. The developed theories for solute partitioning are further extended for direct application to silicone-hydrogel contact-lens materials. <b>Silicone</b> <b>hydrogels</b> (SiHy) are microphase-separated materials with silicone domains for oxygen transport and hydrophilic-polymer domains for aqueous-solute transport. Equilibrium silicone-hydrogel water and solute uptake are measured and predicted with an extended partitioning theory assuming that water and aqueous solutes reside only in the hydrophilic-polymer phase, whereas oleophilic solutes partition primarily into the silicone microphase. Excellent agreement is found between theory and experiment. Significantly, our development provides estimation of partitioning properties in <b>silicone</b> <b>hydrogels</b> based solely on synthesis formulation chemistry. Finally, we deduce compositional properties of a laminated soft contact lens, DAILIES TOTAL 1 ® (delefilcon A) through measurement of fluorescent solute partition coefficients. Measured partition coefficients and solute-partitioning theory establish (1) the silicone-hydrogel core of the laminated lens is structurally similar to that of a non-laminated commercial SiHy soft contact lens, O 2 OPTIXTM, (2) the laminated-lens surface-gel layers are ~ 10 µm in thickness, (3) the laminated-lens surface-gel layers are of higher water content than the core, and (4) the surface-gel layers of the laminated lens are anionic, whereas the core is nonionic. Importantly, with solute-uptake properties known, our proposed solute-partitioning theory provides a means to elucidate hydrogel physico-chemical properties...|$|R
