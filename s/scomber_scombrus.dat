5000|$|The Atlantic {{mackerel}} (<b>Scomber</b> <b>scombrus)</b> is {{a coastal}} species {{found only in}} the north Atlantic. The stock {{on the west side}} of the Atlantic is largely independent of the stock on the east side. The stock on the east Atlantic currently operates as three separate stocks, the southern, western and North Sea stocks, each with their own migration patterns. Some mixing of the east Atlantic stocks takes place in feeding grounds towards the north, but there is almost no mixing between the east and west Atlantic stocks.|$|E
50|$|The {{variety of}} {{habitats}} {{and the large}} volume of plankton on the surface support prolific marine life. Energy moves from the top to the bottom according to Vinogradov's ladder of migrations; that is, some species are benthic and others pelagic, but there are graded marine layers within which species move vertically for short distances. In addition, some species are benthopelagic, moving between surface and bottom. The benthic species include Coryphaenoides rupestris, Argentina silus, Etmopterus spinax, Chimaera monstrosa and Glyptocephalus cynoglossus. On the top are Clupea harengus, <b>Scomber</b> <b>scombrus,</b> Sprattus sprattus. Some species that move between are Pandalus borealis, Sabinea sarsi, Etmopterus spinax.|$|E
50|$|The Atlantic {{mackerel}} (<b>Scomber</b> <b>scombrus),</b> {{also known}} as Boston mackerel, Norwegian mackerel, Scottish mackerel or just mackerel, is a species of mackerel found in the temperate waters of the Mediterranean Sea, the Black Sea, and the northern Atlantic Ocean, where it is extremely common and occurs in huge shoals in the pelagic zone down to about 200 m. It spends the warmer months close to shore and near the ocean surface, appearing along the coast in spring and departing {{with the arrival of}} colder weather in the fall and winter months. During the fall and winter, it migrates out into deeper and more southern water, seeking warmer temperatures.|$|E
50|$|The parish {{church is}} about eight miles (12.7 km) south west of Penzance. The parish {{measures}} 2400 acre {{and the population}} at the 2011 census was 459.

From Nanjizal heading south and east, via Gwennap Head, there is 4 miles of coast to Penberth Cove and the boundary with St Buryan. The parish encompasses a number of small settlements which include Bottoms, Penberth, Polgigga, Porthgwarra, Trebehor, Treen (the chief village) and Trethewey. Both Penberth and Porthgwarra in the past had small fishing fleets despite not having harbour; the boats were hauled up the slipways when not in use. A small fleet continues to fish out of Penberth, for bass (Dicentrarchus labrax), crabs and mackerel (<b>Scomber</b> <b>scombrus).</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1866 the Royal Commission on the Sea Fisheries, which {{included}} among its officers Professor Thomas Henry Huxley, had reported that fears of over-exploitation {{of the sea}} fisheries were unfounded. They recommended removing existing laws regulating fishing grounds and closed seasons. However, {{the increase in the}} size and number of fishing vessels was causing widespread concern, and there were reports from all around the UK coasts about the scarcity of particular fish. This concern was expressed at the International Fisheries Exhibition in London in 1883, a conference called to discuss the commercial and scientific aspects of the fishing industry, and which was attended by many leading scientists of the day. Nevertheless, in his opening address, Huxley discounted reports of fish scarcities and repeated the views of the Royal Commission of 1866. He stated that with existing methods of fishing, it was inconceivable that the great sea fisheries, such as those for cod (Gadus morhua), herring (Clupea harengus) and mackerel (<b>Scomber</b> <b>scombrus),</b> could ever be exhausted.|$|E
50|$|Like most gulls, {{they also}} capture fish with some {{regularity}} and will readily capture any fish smaller than itself found {{close to the}} surface of the water. Whether caught or eaten after death or injury from other sources, stomach contents of great black-backed gulls usually show fish to be the primary food. On Sable Island in Nova Scotia, 25% of the stomach contents were comprised by fish but 96% of the regurgitations given to young was made up fish. Similarly, on Great Island in Newfoundland, 25% of the stomach contents were fish but 68% of regurgitants were fish. The most regularly reported fish eaten in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland were capelin (Mallotus villosus), Atlantic cod (Gadus morrhua), Atlantic tomcod (Microgadus tomcod), Atlantic mackerel (<b>Scomber</b> <b>scombrus),</b> Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) and sand lance (Ammodytes hexapterus). Other prey often includes various squid, Jonah crabs (Cancer borealis), rock crabs (Cancer irroratus), sea urchins, green crabs (Carcinus maenas), starfish (Asterias forbesi and Asterias rubens) and other echinoderms, crustaceans and mollusks when they come across the opportunity. From observations in northern New England, 23% of observed prey was echinoderms and 63% was crustaceans.|$|E
50|$|Coastal marshes, bays, tidal creeks, {{and rivers}} support diverse {{shellfish}} and finfish populations. Sunfish (Lepomis species), creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus), cunner (Tautogolabrus adspersus), golden shiner (Notemigonus crysoleucas), common mummichog (Fundulus heteroclitus), American eel (Anguilla rostrata), and white sucker (Catostomus commersoni) abound. Brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and brown trout (Salmo trutta) are stocked in rivers and estuaries each year. The Ogunquit River sustains alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), blueback herring (Alosa aestivalis), pollock (Pollachius virens), bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix), longhorn sculpin (Myoxocephalus octodecimspinosus), and winter flounder (Pleuronectes americanus). The Webhannet River has native {{species such as}} winter flounder, northern pipefish (Syngnathus fuscus), Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus), common mummichog, Atlantic silversides (Menidia menidia) and Atlantic mackerel. The Merriland River sustains populations of American eel, brown trout, and brook trout. The Mousam River attracts little skate (Raja erinacea), American shad (Alosa sapidissima), striped bass (Morone saxatilis), bluefish, cunner, Atlantic mackerel (<b>Scomber</b> <b>scombrus),</b> pollock, and rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax). The Spurwink River supports blueback herring, Atlantic menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus), American shad, pollock, cunner, winter flounder, and little skate. Striped bass and brown trout are popular recreational fishing resources in the area. The National Marine Fisheries Service has designated as “essential fish habitat” areas that provide substrate necessary for fish spawning, breeding, feeding, or growth to maturity. Estuaries within the refuge boundaries are part of that essential fish habitat.|$|E

The moisture content, ash content, crude fat, crude protein, crude fibre, vitamin A and vitamin C were determined. Titus <b>Scomber</b> <b>scombrus</b> showed highest value of vitamin A (96. 7 i. u), while kotwe recorded relatively high value of vitamin C (0. 60 mg/ 100 g) compared with other fish sources. Variations in the levels of some metal components can serve as measure of pollution, especially the amount of lead (P) (1. 09 %) and iron (Fe) (2. 0 %) in Titus <b>Scomber</b> <b>scombrus</b> could be an indication of pollution for this fish sources or possibly result of biomagnifications. The moisture and ash content of the sampled fish sources during the study ranged from 66. 7 % to 77. 5 % and 3. 79 % to 4. 03 %, respectively. Total bacterial count estimated for fish samples studied were 113 x 104 cfu/mL for Titus, 40 x 104 cfu/mL for Sardinella eba (shawa) while coliform count gave value of 9. 5 x 103 cfu/mL and 9. 65 x 104 cfu/mL for both fish sources, respectively.
