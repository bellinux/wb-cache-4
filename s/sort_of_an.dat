25|$|The Hongwu Emperor was {{wary of the}} {{political}} and social consequences that the maritime commerce could bring, so he sought to restrain it by outlawing private maritime trade. This policy continued well into the Yongle Emperor's reign. However, the Yongle Emperor himself aimed at consolidating imperial control over the maritime commerce, stopping the coastal criminality and disorder, providing employment for mariners and entrepreneurs, exporting Chinese products to foreign markets, importing desired goods for Chinese consumers, extending the tributary system, and displaying imperial majesty to the seas. The voyages functioned as trade commissions in the government's attempts of regulating the private maritime commerce by establishing an imperial monopoly over it and incorporate it into the tributary system. There was seemingly some <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> idea about a foreign policy comprising an extended foreign trade, which came to be supported by a heavy military naval presence and a cultivation of shared interests with local allies.|$|E
25|$|In Series 9, Capaldi {{described}} his character as a 'thrill-seeker' who is confronting danger where he soon realises {{that he is}} 'one of the luckiest creatures in all of time and space' and that 'life is short even at two-thousand years'. According to Coleman regarding Clara's bond with The Doctor inquring if she had feelings for him she stated “She’s totally in love with him, always has been. It’s its own kind of love. He is her hero but she would be very reluctant to tell him that. It’s a doctor-and-companion love, and there’s nothing else like it really.” “They’re kind of freed of their issues and in a wonderful place together. Previously {{she was trying to}} keep him under control yet now the two of them are going ‘Come on, lets jump, lets do it’, egging each other on really, and being more and more reckless,” she teased. Capaldi stated “It’s <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> utterly platonic bond, which is quite unusual. The problem is the Doctor knows a lot more than he ever says. He knows Clara’s fate. He knows the fate of all his companions before they do.” Ultimately it has been confirmed by both Capaldi and Coleman that the Doctor and Clara's relationship is romantic in nature.|$|E

Now science has filled {{in some of the}} realm– not all– that religion used to fill. But the mystery and the beauty of the world is overwhelmingly amazing, and there's no scientific explanation of how it came about.

After watching Levine onstage, they were convinced. Berkman told HitQuarters he believed what the band needed was a [...] "fifth member to play the guitar and free up the singer, {{so he could be}} the star I perceived him to be." [...] Octone immediately insisted that the band change its name to break with its pop past. Also, the label began looking for a full-time guitarist to enable Levine to focus on performing as the frontman. James Valentine (from the L.A. band Square) was recruited for the job. On his joining the band, Valentine commented: [...] "I became friends with them and we sort of started jamming together, it was very much like I was cheating on my band, we were having <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> affair and I eventually quit my other band to join up with them." ...|$|E
5000|$|Writing or The Observer, Paul Morley slated the show. He wrote, [...] "the fraudulently titled Off the Record is {{just one}} long, gushing promotional push for the group, an attempt to prolong their fragile careers {{for just a few}} more months by pretending to analyse the exciting, {{stressful}} reality <b>of</b> being <b>a</b> girl in a group such as Girls Aloud attempting to transcend their manufactured roots. <b>Sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> smutty comedy, <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tragedy, <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gossipy, fake-provocative documentary, <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> heavily censored electronic press kit, there's little sleaze, insight or emotional disintegration."

500|$|As the band's primary lyricist, McIlrath is {{wary of the}} {{political}} label. [...] "In this sort of current climate of music, we stand out simply because I think there are bands that are avoiding the question. So, it makes us <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> anomaly and I think that’s where we get the tag 'protest music' or 'political punk rock'". He also noted how the band's lyrics discuss social topics in general terms, instead of delving into the specifics. In a 2006 interview, McIlrath said: [...] "I {{think that a lot}} of the problems we deal with today in the world are the ones that have been plaguing society for centuries and probably will be here a hundred years from now...There's a bigger picture than just the Bush administration and specific problems of 2006, and I want people to relate to that, even if they're listening to [...] 10 years from now." [...] Principe noted the band does not try to preach their beliefs, but instead encourage listeners to become involved, and learn about pertinent issues affecting society.|$|E
500|$|The {{direction}} of the band is dominated by chief guitarist, lead vocalist, and principal songwriter Billy Corgan. Journalist Greg Kot wrote, [...] "The music [...] would not be what it is without his ambition and vision, and his famously fractured relationships with his family, friends, and bandmembers." [...] Melissa Auf der Maur commented upon news of the group's reunion, [...] "Everyone knows Billy doesn't need too many people to make a Pumpkins record, other than Jimmy —who he has on board." [...] In a 2015 interview Corgan himself referred to the current iteration of the band [...] "as <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> open source collective" [...] noting that [...] "It's whoever feels right at the time.". Many of Corgan's lyrics for the Pumpkins are cathartic expressions of emotion, full of personal musings and strong indictments of himself and those close to him. Music critics were not often fans of Corgan's angst-filled lyrics. Jim DeRogatis wrote in a 1993 Chicago Sun-Times article that Corgan's lyrics [...] "too often sound like sophomoric poetry", although he viewed the lyrics of later albums Adore and Machina as an improvement. Corgan responded to DeRogatis' words with [...] "fuck the Sun-Times", at the band's 1993 show at the Metro Chicago.|$|E
500|$|Lucas based the CGI on the {{character}} as he originally appeared in Return of the Jedi. In this film, Jabba the Hutt is an immense, sedentary, slug-like creature designed by Lucas's Industrial Light & Magic Creature Shop. Design consultant Ralph McQuarrie claimed, [...] "In my sketches Jabba was huge, agile, <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> apelike figure. But then the design went into another direction, and Jabba became more like a worm kind of creature." [...] According to the 1985 documentary From Star Wars to Jedi, Lucas rejected initial designs of {{the character}}. One made Jabba appear too human—almost like a Fu Manchu character—while a second made him look too snail-like. Lucas finally settled on a design that was a hybrid of the two, drawing for further inspiration on an O'Galop cartoon figure flanking an early depiction of Bibendum (also known as the [...] "Michelin Man"). Return of the Jedi costume designer Nilo Rodis-Jamero commented, My vision of Jabba was literally Orson Welles when he was older. I saw him as a very refined man. Most of the villains we like are very smart people. But Phil Tippett kept imagining him {{as some kind of}} slug, almost like in Alice in Wonderland. At one time he sculpted a creature that looked like a slug that's smoking. I kept thinking I must be really off, but eventually that's where it led up to." ...|$|E

Its delivery, {{whether in the}} form of narration or dialogue, is often so forthright that the reader may not perceive it at first. At times, however, O'Brian will spend a considerable portion of a volume setting up comical sequences - for example, Jack's use of rum in the [...] "debauchery" [...] of Maturin's pet sloth in HMS Surprise or Jack's assertion to William Babbington, while discussing nautical terminology, that [...] "Sheep ain't poetical", supporting his statement by saying: [...] "Remember that fellow in the play who calls out: 'My Kingdom for a horse'? Would not have been poetry at all, had he said sheep." [...] (See The Ionian Mission.) Drunk animals are a common motif through the series; for instance the following conversation between Jack and Stephen in Post Captain: [...] "'The carrier has brought you an ape.' 'What <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ape?' asked Stephen. 'A damned ill-conditioned <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ape. It had a can of ale at every pot-house on the road, and is reeling drunk.

It was pretty much my song as I recall... I think John helped out. The lyrics got more and more obscure as it goes on, but the chorus, melody and verses are mine."

2500|$|Before such {{elements}} were {{forced out of}} opera seria, many libretti had featured a separately unfolding comic plot as <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> [...] "opera-within-an-opera." [...] One reason for this {{was an attempt to}} attract members of the growing merchant class, newly wealthy, but still not as cultured as the nobility, to the public opera houses. These separate plots were almost immediately resurrected in a separately developing tradition that partly derived from the commedia dell'arte, a long-flourishing improvisatory stage tradition of Italy. Just as intermedi had once been performed in-between the acts of stage plays, operas in the new comic genre of [...] "intermezzi", which developed largely in Naples in the 1710s and '20s, were initially staged during the intermissions of opera seria.

2500|$|Ironically, while Maimonides {{refrained from}} citing sources {{out of concern}} for brevity (or perhaps because he {{designed}} his work to be used without studying the Talmud or other sources first), the result has often been the opposite of what he intended. [...] Various commentaries have been written which seek to supply the lacking source documentation, and indeed today the Mishneh Torah is sometimes used as a <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> index to aid in locating Talmudic passages. [...] In cases where Maimonides' sources or interpretation thereof is questionable, the lack of clarity has at times led to lengthy analyses and debates – quite the opposite of the brevity he sought to attain. On the other hand, this only became an issue for students and scholars who studied the Mishneh Torah's sources. According to Maimonides himself, deducing law from the sources had already become a precarious proposition (for a number of reasons) – even in his own times. This necessarily relates to different subjects – like the influence of the exile, language skills, lack of time, censorship and alternate versions of the Talmud.|$|E
