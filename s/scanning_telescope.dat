40|$|Holographic optical {{elements}} (HOE) using volume phase holograms {{make possible}} {{a new class}} of lightweight <b>scanning</b> <b>telescopes</b> having advantages for lidar remote sensing instruments. So far, the only application of HOE's to lidar has been a non-scanning receiver for a laser range finder. We introduce a large aperture, narrow field of view (FOV) telescope used in a conical scanning configuration, having a much smaller rotating mass than in conventional designs. Typically, lidars employ a large aperture collector and require a narrow FOV to limit the amount of skylight background. Focal plane techniques are not good approaches to scanning because they require a large FOV within which to scan a smaller FOV mirror or detector array. Thus, scanning lidar systems have either used a large flat scanning mirror at which the receiver telescope is pointed, or the entire telescope is steered. We present a concept for a conically <b>scanned</b> lidar <b>telescope</b> in which the only moving part is the HOE which serves as the primary collecting optic.
