500|$|The {{ground floor}} houses a 300-seat {{auditorium}} which {{also serves as}} a reading space when not in use for performances. Library CEO Judith Hare stated that the space would complement a recording studio, geared toward young people, planned elsewhere in the library: [...] "people can make their own music... but also they’ll have a place to perform as well." [...] In 2012 the auditorium was named Paul O’Regan Hall following a $1 million donation by the O’Regan family in honour of the late businessman and philanthropist. Government funding only covered the cost of the building, so donations will go toward expanding the book collection and purchasing new computers and special equipment. The hall is fitted with <b>stowable</b> seats, acoustic ceiling baffles, a video screen, and professional sound and lighting installations.|$|E

50|$|After the {{encounter}} with the Dominion in 2370, in which the Galaxy-class USS Odyssey was destroyed by just three Dominion vessels and owing to other threats, {{it became obvious that}} the station's existing occupation-era weapons would be insufficient in defending the station. The station's weapons and defensive systems were later heavily upgraded. The upgrade included the installation of multiple rotary torpedo launchers on the docking pylons and weapons sail towers, <b>stowable</b> phaser banks that retract when not in use and improved shields that extend 300 meters around the station. The total torpedo inventory was increased to 5,000.|$|E
5000|$|Bucket {{seats are}} also used in {{passenger}} vans and minivans, although they are not always referred to as such. Unlike those in cars, bucket seats in vans can be configured in different ways or even removed for more cargo storage. In the typical minivan configuration, the front and middle rows have two bucket seats each, while the third-row seat has a three-person bench, {{for a total of}} seven passengers. Honda Odyssey 2005-2010 models (except for the base trim) adds a <b>stowable</b> [...] "PlusOneSeat" [...] between the middle row bucket seats. The Australian Mazda MPV has three seats in the middle and two in the last row.|$|E

5000|$|The United States Navy Air Development Center {{awarded a}} number of {{contracts}} to aerospace companies to find a method for ejected aircrew {{to escape from the}} scene of the crash. Kaman proposed a turbofan powered gyroplane it called the <b>Stowable</b> Aircrew Vehicle Escape Rotorseat or SAVER, it was a gyroplane with an unpowered rotor, the blades being telescopic and along with the turbofan engine would fold into the aircraft seat during normal use. When the pilot ejected the seat would leave the aircraft and a drogue parachute would slow the seat and deploy the blades within four seconds. After an additional two seconds, the turbofan would run up to full power and the seat would become a gyroplane. Kaman made over 1500 air drops to test the self-deploying rotor system and a full-scale unpowered SAVER was tested by NASA in the Ames Research Laboraatory wind tunnel in 1970. The SAVER was equipped with a ground handling frame for tests, which was a tricycle landing gear and support frame, also fitted with basic flight instruments. The SAVER first flew in a towed flight on 28 December 1971 and the following day made a free flight, although it was fitted with a 16 ft non-telescoping rotor. Fitted with the 14 ft telescopic rotor, it first flew 10 January 1972. The SAVER was fitted with a Williams WRC-19 turbofan which was too powerful for the seat but was available [...] "off the shelf." [...] The program was to test the seat unmanned in an air launch but the program was cancelled as the military did not think the idea was a viable proposition.|$|E

40|$|Booms {{and other}} {{structures}} consisting mainly of thin spring strips are undergoing development. These structures {{are designed to}} be lightweight, to be compactly <b>stowable,</b> and to be capable of springing to stable configurations at full extension once released from stowage. Conceived for use as self-deploying structures in outer space, portable structures of this type may also be useful on Earth in applications in which there are requirements for light weight and small transportation volume. The elements common to these structures are spring strips with curved cross sections [...] similar to spring strips of the type commonly used as compactly <b>stowable</b> carpenters' measuring tapes. These structures exploit the nonlinear mechanical properties of such tapes, namely (1) strong resistance to axial buckling while they are straight and (2) ease with which they can be wound into compact rolls once they have been initially bent. For a structure that contains multiple such strips, the net effect of the combined nonlinear characteristics is the following: (1) When at full extension, the structure is in a stable state, in which it is rigid and strong. (2) When stowed compactly, the structure is in a state that is semistable in the sense that only a small force is needed to restrain the structure against deployment. (3) The strain energy stored in the spring strips during compaction is sufficient to deploy the structure to full extension when the restraint is removed...|$|E
