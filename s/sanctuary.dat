Bel had Astarte-Belti as his consort, and formed a triple deity with Aglibol and Yarhibol (who became a sun god in his association with Bel). Malakbel was part of many associations, pairing with Gad Taimi and Aglibol, and forming a triple deity with Baalshamin and Aglibol. Palmyra hosted an Akitu (spring festival) each Nisan. Each of the city's four-quarters had a <b>sanctuary</b> for a deity considered ancestral to the resident tribe; Malakbel and Aglibol's <b>sanctuary</b> was in the Komare quarter. The Baalshamin <b>sanctuary</b> was in the Ma'zin quarter, the Arsu <b>sanctuary</b> in the Mattabol quarter, and the Atargatis <b>sanctuary</b> in the fourth tribe's quarter.|$|E

5|$|In most temples, {{the focus}} was the cult image: a statue of the temple god which that god's ba was {{believed}} to inhabit while interacting with humans. The <b>sanctuary</b> in these temples contained either a naos, a cabinet-like shrine that housed the divine image, or a model barque containing the image within its cabin, which was used to carry the image during festival processions. In some cases the <b>sanctuary</b> may have housed several cult statues. To emphasize the sanctuary's sacred nature, it was kept in total darkness. Whereas in earlier times the <b>sanctuary</b> lay {{at the very back}} of the building, in the Late and Ptolemaic periods it became a freestanding building inside the temple, further insulated from the outside world by the surrounding corridors and rooms.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1940s the central vault {{ceiling of the}} main <b>sanctuary</b> cracked, {{and had to be}} repaired. At that time the pulpit was also rebuilt, so that the rabbi and cantor had {{separate}} pulpits. Underneath the <b>sanctuary</b> ran an underground stream which would regularly overflow, leading to flooding problems. The flooding was fixed in the 1950s with the installation of check valves, and a concrete slab floor was installed. Though the intent was to provide usable space in the basement, it was rarely used.|$|E
5|$|Like its art, Palmyra's {{architecture}} {{was influenced}} by the Greco-Roman style, while preserving local elements (best seen in the Temple of Bel). Enclosed by a massive wall flanked with traditional Roman columns, Bel's <b>sanctuary</b> plan was primarily Semitic. Similar to the Second Temple, the <b>sanctuary</b> consisted of a large courtyard with the deity's main shrine off-center against its entrance (a plan preserving elements of the temples of Ebla and Ugarit).|$|E
5|$|Many {{rock and}} metal fans that became Christians through the {{ministry}} of Christian metal bands were rejected from churches in the 1980s. In 1984, California pastor Bob Beeman saw this problem and soon started the ministry called <b>Sanctuary</b> - The Rock and Roll Refuge. This fellowship brought many musicians together and formed groups such as Tourniquet, Deliverance, Vengeance and Mortal that would soon become ground breaking acts in Christian music culture. Sanctuary's first worship leader was Stryper's vocalist Michael Sweet and later Barren Cross' bass player Jim LaVerde. <b>Sanctuary</b> sponsored the first Christian metal festival, The Metal Mardi Gras, held in 1987 in Los Angeles. This proved influential and soon Christian metal festivals were organized elsewhere as well. Sanctuary's activities began spreading, and it had 36 parishes all over the United States at its peak by the 1990s. The <b>Sanctuary</b> parishes {{had a significant impact}} on the Christian metal movement: groups that would later become notable such as P.O.D. performed their first concerts in <b>Sanctuary.</b>|$|E
30|$|Buildings made of {{sandstone}} {{were limited}} to {{the first and second}} stages of construction. The sandstone blocks used in the second stage were larger than those used in the first stage. We have assumed that the brick <b>sanctuaries</b> are the oldest (i.e., Prasat Thom, Prasat Damrei, Prasat Kraham, Prasat Krachap and Prasat Pram), followed by the sandstone <b>sanctuaries</b> (i.e., Prasat G and Prasat Trapean Rosei), with the laterite <b>sanctuaries</b> being constructed last of all. The laterite <b>sanctuaries</b> of Prasat Neang Khmau and Prasat Chen were constructed earlier than those of Prasat Khtum, Prasat Bak, Prasat Banteay Pir Chan and Prasat Chrap.|$|R
40|$|When {{we think}} of public space we {{generally}} interpret it as urban space. This paper examines the role of remote, or 'extra-urban' <b>sanctuaries</b> in Hellenistic Asia Minor as public spaces {{far removed from the}} city. Through their festivals and processions these <b>sanctuaries</b> obviously had a very public role, albeit for a very specified public. Taking the Karian city of Mylasa and the related <b>sanctuaries</b> of Labraunda and Sinuri as a case study, this paper examines how these <b>sanctuaries</b> came to shape civic identity, not only through their festivals, but also through their architectural space and the placement of monuments and inscriptions...|$|R
