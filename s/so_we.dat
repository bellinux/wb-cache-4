5|$|There {{was this}} {{absolute}} scorching deal on cases of PBR and kegs. We {{were one of}} the few outlets in Portland that sold kegs to go, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> could sell them at a really good deal. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> started the PBR dollar-can special. I'd say it was around 1997 or 1998. At one point, I know they said we were the largest distributor of Pabst in the state, if not the country. We got written up in The New York Times about it. We were going through hundreds of cases and dozens of kegs a week.|$|E
5|$|And matters {{continued}} {{thus for}} a considerable time. But a sedition and civil war came upon the wretched people and turned their cruelty toward us against one another. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> breathed {{for a little while}} as they ceased from their rage against us. But presently the change from that milder reign was announced to us, and great fear of what was threatened seized us.|$|E

Yours is only one further degree of insularity. You think this vacuous aloofness of yours {{is some sort of}} moral superiority. <b>So</b> did <b>we,</b> <b>so</b> did <b>we....</b>|$|R

5|$|By {{what right}} do you dare accuse the nation of... want of {{perseverance}} in the emperor's interest? The nation has followed him on the fields of Italy, across the sands of Egypt and the plains of Germany, across the frozen deserts of Russia.... The nation has followed him in fifty battles, in his defeats and in his victories, and in doing <b>so</b> <b>we</b> have to mourn the blood of three million Frenchmen.|$|E
5|$|Geri {{came in and}} sang: 'Too much of something/Da-da-da-da-da...Right. OK. You got that?' We {{started working}} on it {{and we wanted to}} do some sort of doo-wop vocal thing. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> {{constructed}} this backing track and then more of the girls started to come in—this was quite a good day—and gradually they started to add on their little bits.|$|E
5|$|I {{consider}} {{him to be}} {{one of my best friends}} but the real thing is about managers: I think Steinman's manager is the devil and Steinman feels the same way about my manager. <b>So,</b> <b>we</b> had to communicate through managers and he refused to sign some papers that would have allowed for the recording of Bat Out of Hell III without a hitch. So, really, I didn't sue Jim Steinman. I sued his manager.|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope <b>so,</b> Dias. <b>We</b> did {{not come}} out here to fight. <b>So</b> far <b>we</b> have been very fortunate, and have not had to fire a shot, except at those wretched savages." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We can train {{him down}} all right," [...] said Bob; [...] "an' you fellers come down now while I find out 'bout the pony, <b>so's</b> <b>we</b> {{can come back}} here after dinner." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So fair <b>we</b> seem, <b>so</b> cold <b>we</b> are, [...] <b>So</b> fast <b>we</b> {{hasten to}} decay, [...] Yet through our night glows many a star, [...] That still shall claim its sunny day." ...|$|R
5|$|If {{you guys}} think I'm a diva and I have {{requirements}}, Snoop is the next level. He's the hip-hop king! So his requirements to get to Paris are, like, beyond platinum editions; they're, like, beyond ultra-platinum editions; they're like diamond editions. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> love Snoop and we wish he had been here, but I think shooting him in L.A. will be good because we'll have more time, more control. He probably would have gotten really mobbed in the streets here anyway.|$|E
5|$|It was {{too dark}} to see anything, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> carried our tent and baggage near the only house on the island, and began to cook our suppers, in order to be {{prepared}} for the earliest dawn, and to enjoy that which, from the conversation of the gentlemen we had, now raised the highest expectations of.|$|E
5|$|It wasn't like Janet , {{where we}} all grew up together. Mariah had done her own thing and had been very {{involved}} with the arranging and production of her records, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> respected that and said, 'What can we do for you?' She would fly into town {{for five or six}} hours. She'd get on a plane and fly to whatever was the next thing she was doing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Undoubtedly. But {{from the}} moment you do <b>so</b> until <b>we</b> are married you will be worried by remonstrances, entreaties, threats, and what not; <b>so</b> that <b>we</b> cannot {{possibly}} make that interval too short." ...|$|R

3000|$|... “The {{environment}} in Austria {{and the work}} opportunities in Germany are {{a lot better than}} here. We came here [Sweden] <b>so</b> that <b>we</b> could get citizenship and <b>so</b> that <b>we</b> could travel.” (Ahmed, Sweden).|$|R
5|$|Maybe mid-year; {{safe to say}} {{towards the}} end {{but not at the}} end, maybe like eight months or {{something}} like that. Best thing about it is we’re going to do it whenever we want to do it. There is no deadline right now, we don’t have any dates set, we don’t have the studio, we’re going to do the record ourselves. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> will literally go in and record it and it will be probably be done before we sign a contract.|$|E
5|$|Men, I know you’ve {{all been}} waiting to learn what this cruise is about, and why we’re still headed southeast. Now, at last, I {{can tell you that}} we are going on the voyage which all submariners have dreamed of ever since they possessed the means of doing <b>so.</b> <b>We</b> have the ship and we have the crew. We’re going around the world, nonstop. And we’re going to do it entirely submerged.|$|E
5|$|The {{dimensions}} of Christian meditation develop from God's having completed his self-revelation in two directions: Speaking {{out of his}} own, and speaking as a man, through his Son, disclosing the depths of man.... And this meditation can take place only where the revealing man, God's Son, Jesus Christ, reveals God as his Father: in the Holy Spirit of God, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> may join in probing God's depths, which only God's Spirit probes.|$|E

6000|$|... "It {{seems as}} though I ought to, but it's kind of hard work carryin' the princess. Aunt Dorcas gave me the cakes <b>so's</b> <b>we</b> wouldn't need to hurry on the road, an'--where are they?" ...|$|R
5000|$|His adopted son Arn Chorn-Pond said of Pond, [...] "Peter is {{very lonely}} himself...People do not {{understand}} what he do. They think he wants something, but Peter don't want anything. What he does is from his heart. It is pure help. This guy is <b>so</b> simple <b>we</b> don't understand. It is <b>so</b> simple <b>we</b> make it complicated. Maybe <b>we</b> are <b>so</b> modern <b>we</b> can no understand pure love." ...|$|R
5|$|We {{all feel}} as {{sensitive}} to satisfaction at times. We can look outside us and {{see nothing but}} destruction, avarice, and boredom. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> look to find that love where we can find it. Some people look to Hollywood, some people look to Blackpool and {{the bright lights of}} Blackpool. That's probably where I would look.|$|E
5|$|We're {{bringing}} Justin {{into the}} world of dance on this one, giving Justin the chance to integrate to different styles of dance. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> kind of kept it simple with the art direction, just real graphic and really highlighting the dance.

6000|$|... "We {{have missed}} you <b>so,</b> John. <b>We</b> have wanted you so much. Lucy and Kate and Deby {{were so bad}} yesterday, and they did cry <b>so</b> for you. <b>We</b> were all <b>so</b> hungry. <b>We</b> don't mind <b>so</b> much, when you are here {{to talk to us}} and tell us stories. Why did you stop away, John, when we wanted you so?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{been trying}} to chin that old fool of a squire into letting you off for this evening, <b>so's</b> <b>we</b> can give a show, but he won't listen to {{anything}} of the kind," [...] the visitor announced in a disconsolate tone.|$|R
25|$|<b>So</b> <b>we</b> get {{straight}} to the second drop, and that shows us the winner.|$|E
25|$|A. Ideas {{are always}} imagistic (3rd), <b>so</b> <b>we</b> {{have no idea}} of {{thinking}} substance (non-image idea).|$|E
25|$|Every regular grammar {{corresponds}} {{directly to}} a nondeterministic finite automaton, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> {{know that this is}} a regular language.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, every feller must hurry home an' get the ten cents, <b>so's</b> <b>we</b> can buy {{the wood}} quick, an' then there won't be any chance for the girls {{to believe that we}} thought of this after we got their letters." ...|$|R
