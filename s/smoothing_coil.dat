Small diameter coils can withstand higher pressures required by the new generation of environmentally friendlier refrigerants. They have lower material costs because they require less refrigerant, fin, and coil materials. And they enable the design of smaller and lighter high-efficiency air conditioners and refrigerators because the evaporators and condensers coils are smaller and lighter.|$|R

40|$|In this Thesis work two {{different}} passive techniques for {{the enhancement of}} the convective heat transfer in single phase duct flow are studied: the heat transfer performance of <b>coiled</b> tubes having <b>smooth</b> and corrugated wall is experimentally investigated. The curvature heat transfer augmentation effect {{is due to the}} fact that the fluid flowing inside the pipe experiences the centrifugal force that promotes a secondary flow: local maxima in the velocity distribution that locally increases the temperature gradients at the wall by then maximizing the heat transfer, are induced. The enhancing effect in corrugated pipes is mainly due to the macroscopic mixing of the fluid, activated by the destabilization of the flow which leads to the early onset of the transfer mechanism associated to the transitional regime. This issue becomes particularly important in industrial applications in which the thermal processing of medium and high viscosity fluids is required, such as in the food, chemical, pharmaceutical and cosmetics industries where the momentum transfer mechanism is necessarily laminar and therefore the efficiency of the heat transfer apparatuses in which the fluids are conveyed is inevitably penalized. The first part of this work concerns the estimation of the average heat transfer performances along the heated length of the coiled pipes in terms of Nusselt number circumferentially averaged along the cross section and computed at different axial position. In addition the heat transfer augmentation is compared to the correlated pressure drop penalties. In the second part of this work, with the aim to deeply investigate the mechanisms that govern the heat transfer in coiled pipes, the solution of the IHCP in the wall, starting from the temperature distribution acquired on the external wall surface, is employed to estimate the local convective heat-transfer coefficient on the interior wall surface along the cross section. Three different solution procedures, based on Tikhonov Regularization Method (TRM), Gaussian Filter Technique (GFT) and Quadrupole method (QM) are presented, implemented and optimized for the problem under study. The different approaches are validated, throughout their application to synthetic data and then applied to the experimental data regarding laminar fully developed region in the <b>smooth</b> <b>coiled</b> tubes. Also an estimation procedure, based on Gaussian Filter, is proposed and applied to the experimental data for corrugated wall coiled tubes and preliminary results are presented and discussed...|$|R

40|$|Although {{there is}} a notable move towards fresh water {{stations}} in the European markets, using the cheaper internal solutions of <b>smooth</b> or finned <b>coil</b> heat exchangers for smaller solar thermal system storage devices still dominates. Varying significantly in type and geometry, the functions used to account for heat transfer are possibly outdated and {{in light of the}} still relatively high investment costs of solar thermal systems, not cost optimizing. An overview of the current thermal storage market implementing typical immersed heat exchanger types and variations has been collated such that geometrical dependencies and specific advantages or disadvantages can be elucidated. By analysing the correlation between parameters, the relationship between trends in design and current rules of thumb is discussed. From the market research a reference solar DHW was defined and simulated in the TRNSYS simulation environment. A method for interpreting the results in dependency of the energy transferred through an immersed coil heat exchanger at any given annual condition is presented and a selection of representative immersed coil heat exchangers is discussed for future experimentation based on the knowledge gained from the simulation results. Based on commensuration of the experiments with computational modeling (computational fluid dynamics as well as TRNSYS models), future work will entail the development of an immersed coil heat exchangers optimization methodology. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{lubricant}} miscibility and viscosity {{were evaluated by}} measuring the performance of an HFC- 134 a refrigeration system. The focus {{of this study is}} different from past studies which have been based on investigating system reliability in that is based on evaluating system efficiency, i. e., coefficient of performance;The vapor-compression refrigeration system used in this study contained a reciprocating compressor especially designed for the HFC- 134 refrigerant and a direct expansion evaporator coil with a rated capacity of 10 kW (3 tons). With respect to the refrigerant side heat transfer surface, two types of evaporator coils were tested, namely the microfin-tube type and the smooth-tube type;The effects of refrigerant/lubricant miscibility were investigated by comparing the performance of a miscible polyol ester lubricant (POE) and an immiscible naphthenic mineral oil (MO) of similar viscosity grade. The coefficient of performance (COP) of the operating HFC- 134 a refrigeration system was found to be consistently higher, up to 5 percent, for the miscible POE lubricant compared to the immiscible mineral oil. The increased performance for the POE operation is attributed to an increased evaporation heat transfer rate for the POE lubricant. The results of other tested miscible lubricants also indicated superior system performance of miscible lubricants;The lubricant viscosity effects were investigated by comparing the HFC- 134 a system performance of two miscible POE lubricants of different viscosity grades, namely an ISO 22 and an ISO 32. The results show that both the COP and the capacity are generally higher, up to 3. 5 percent, for the system employing the lower viscosity POE. Again, these performance differences were correlated to the differences in the evaporation heat transfer rate with the lower viscosity lubricant indicating a higher evaporation heat transfer rate;A partially miscible POE was also evaluated, and it resulted in a reduced performance compared to a fully miscible lubricant, and thus, it was concluded that partial miscibility in the evaporator has a negative effect on system performance;In contrast to the evaporator performance, the effects of lubricant type on compressor efficiencies were not substantial, as evident by the observed differences in both the isentropic and the volumetric efficiencies between tested lubricants being rarely larger than the respective uncertainties;It was observed that the effect of the lubricant type on performance was more pronounced for the microfin-tube coil. The microfin-tube coil outperformed the smooth-tube coil by up to 10 percent in terms of the overall heat transfer coefficient. In addition, the performance enhancement (i. e. the heat transfer enhancement for the microfin tube coil compared to the <b>smooth</b> tube <b>coil)</b> is more pronounced for the miscible POE lubricant;In summary, lubricant selection should not only be based on system reliability but also on the system performance and efficiency as evident {{by the fact that the}} use of miscible lubricants and a lower viscosity lubricant resulted in improved performance...|$|R
40|$|In Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), strong {{magnetic}} pulses {{delivered by}} a coil {{placed over the}} subject’s head are used to induce neural activity in a focal area of the brain. TMS {{can be used to}} demonstrate a causal relationship between behavior and the neural processing in a brain structure of interest by showing that a subject’s task performance is diminished during TMS stimulation of that structure (i. e., the “virtual lesion” approach [1]). We addressed two questions in the current study: 1) How well does the position of the maximal TMS effect coincide with the brain activation pattern observed during the task using other neuroimaging techniques such as fMRI or PET? 2) Which visual area is most critical for conscious perception of a visual stimulus, i. e. which visual area has to be disturbed after stimulus presentation to diminish the recognition performance significantly? (“visual suppression” effect [2, 3]). In all subjects, the spatial pattern of the TMS effect was <b>smooth</b> and the <b>coil</b> positions at which the maximal suppression occurred were located next to each other. This indicates that the TMS target was a single continuous brain structure and not, e. g. two or more separate sub-areas. The Center of Gravity (CoG) of the TMS map was consistently positioned over the inferior part of the superior occipital gyrus. As expected, the fMRI activation pattern was rather extended and covered several visual areas. The TMS CoG was consistently located over the medial-inferior part of the fMRI activation. Visual mapping [4] delineated the TMS CoG being significantly closer to the CoG of V 2 than to any other visual area. Mean deviation of TMS CoG from V 2 CoG obtained with fMRI was 5. 1 mm (SE 0. 6 mm, n= 7), showing a good spatial congruence between these two neuroimaging techniques. Several control studies were performed to test for possible involvement of other visual areas. The findings suggest that V 2 and not primary visual cortex V 1 is the brain area primarily targeted in visual suppression. In consequence, our data does not support the special role of V 1 in conscious visual perception as previously suggested by several authors (for review see [5]) ...|$|R
