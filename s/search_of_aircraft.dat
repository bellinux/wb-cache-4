40|$|In this paper, a {{physically}} based approach, which takes full benefits of speckle noise as source of information, is first applied over	X-band full resolution single-look complex slant (SCS) COSMO-SkyMed {{synthetic aperture radar}} (SAR) data to observe metallic targets at sea. A constant false alarm rate (CFAR) filter based on the coherent-to-incoherent field ratio is developed, which: 1) is very effective in terms of processing time, 2) is able to provide logical true-and-false outputs characterized by a very low false alarm rate; and 3) can operate {{in a wide range}} of incidence angles. Experimental results, obtained by processing a wide data set of full-resolution SCS	X-band COSMO-SkyMed SAR data, show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Part of this data set regards the challenging operational case related to the Air France Flight 447 accident occurred on June 1, 2009, off the Brazilian coasts. It is shown how COSMO-SkyMed SAR data can assist the <b>search</b> <b>of</b> <b>aircraft</b> debris at sea. Moreover, the proposed approach is of great applicative relevance even because of the high revisit time of COSMO-SkyMed constellation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSensory {{effects in}} eyes and airways are common {{symptoms}} reported by aircraft crew and office workers. Neurological symptoms, such as headache, {{have also been}} reported. To assess the commonality and differences in exposures and health symptoms, a literature <b>search</b> <b>of</b> <b>aircraft</b> cabin and office air concentrations of non-reactive volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and ozone-initiated terpene reaction products were compiled and assessed. Data for tricresyl phosphates, in particular tri-ortho-cresyl phosphate (ToCP), were also compiled, {{as well as information}} on other risk factors such as low relative humidity. A conservative health risk assessment for eye, airway and neurological effects was undertaken based on a “worst-case scenario” which assumed a simultaneous constant exposure for 8 h to identified maximum concentrations in aircraft and offices. This used guidelines and reference values for sensory irritation for eyes and upper airways and airflow limitation; a tolerable daily intake value was used for ToCP. The assessment involved the use of hazard quotients or indexes, defined as the summed ratio(s) (%) of compound concentration(s) divided by their guideline value(s). The concentration data suggest that, under the assumption of a conservative “worst-case scenario”, aircraft air and office concentrations of the compounds in question {{are not likely to be}} associated with sensory symptoms in eyes and airways. This is supported by the fact that maximum concentrations are, in general, associated with infrequent incidents and brief exposures. Sensory symptoms, in particular in eyes, appear to be exacerbated by environmental and occupational conditions that differ in aircraft and offices, e. g., ozone incidents, low relative humidity, low cabin pressure, and visual display unit work. The data do not support airflow limitation effects. For ToCP, in view of the conservative approach adopted here and the rareness of reported incidents, the health risk of exposure to this compound in aircraft is considered negligible...|$|E

40|$|Economical aspects such as reduced {{specific}} fuel consumptions {{and ever}} growing environmental requirements on emissions and percieved noise levels, {{are the major}} drivers in the <b>search</b> for improvement <b>of</b> <b>aircraft</b> engines. For turbofan engines, the global trend is towards higher efficiency which is accomplished by increasing component efficiencies, the bypass ratio and overall pressure ratio while keeping the engine weight low. Concerning the low pressure system, the reduction in weight can be realized by decreasing the number of stages in the compressor. However by doing so, the aerodynamic load per stage must be increased {{in order to maintain}} the same pressure ratio. As the aerodynamic load increases, it becomes more difficult to maintain a high efficiency on the aerodynamic design point and keep a sufficiently high stability margin along the compressor working line. In this thesis a new design methodology, accounting for both efficiency and stability, is presented. In order to utilize the design process for industrial applications, the reduction in total design time and computational resources are also adressed. The validity of the presented analysis method is put to test by means of two validation cases. The first case is a transonic rotor in isolation and the second case is a three stage highly loaded transonic compressor...|$|R
40|$|Malaria {{was once}} {{common in the}} marshes of {{southern}} England. In this study I investigated why a disease called benign tertian malaria {{became known as the}} killer of the marshes and looked at the present and future threat from malaria returning to these marshes. The main focus of research was carried out on the Isle of Sheppey, one of the last places in England to experience an epidemic of malaria. An historical analysis of malaria was carried out by analysing births and deaths using Parish and Hospital records. Here I make the case that the deaths associated with malaria {{were more likely to be}} caused by diarrhoeal diseases and acute respiratory infections. The present risk of malaria was assessed using several methods. Field surveys showed that populations of An. atroparvus on Sheppey were small and severely limited by the few over-wintering sites and the filamentous surface algae needed for the aquatic stages to develop. Local residents found mosquitoes a major nuisance during the summer months, but few of these were likely to be malaria vectors. Overall the risk of local malaria transmission is extremely low and far below that needed to maintain the disease. <b>Searches</b> <b>of</b> 52 <b>aircraft</b> arriving at Gatwick Airport from Africa revealed no malaria vectors suggesting that the risk of importing exotic mosquitoes by aircraft is remote. Finally, 1 developed a simple surveillance system that could be used for assessing the threat of future vector borne diseases, using West Nile virus as a model. Routine sampling with Mosquito Magnet traps, a carbon-dioxide baited trap, was extremely efficient at collecting large numbers of potential disease vectors and could be used as a tool for risk assessment programmes. These studies indicate that malaria is extremely unlikely to ever return to the United Kingdom. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
