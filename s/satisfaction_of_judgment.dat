"Bobbins" [...] or Claudio, Jr. started {{serving the}} {{sentence}} on 24 June 1991, {{by virtue of}} his preventive detention at the Makati City jail, and then, at New Bilibid Prison in Muntinlupa since 16 January 1993. On the civil aspect, the trial Court approved the 19 November 1999 settlement signed by the Hultman family and the Teehankees, on 10 January 2000. The lower court issued entry of judgment on 17 February 2000, and on 13 January 2003, the Hultmans filed the Notice of <b>Satisfaction</b> <b>of</b> <b>Judgment.</b> Accordingly, Bobbins filed the petition for executive clemency on 22 December 2003, since he already served a total of 13 years and 5 months of actual time, equivalent to 15 years under the Good Conduct Credits rules and guidelines. Formal notices of the application were published in the newspapers, inter alia, to all parties concerned, on 28 January and 6 February 2004 with no oppositions filed. By virtue of the Presidential Order of Commutation dated 30 September 2008, Bobbins is just one of 1,430 released who were similarly situated. Thus, on 3 October 2008, based on actual time served of 17 years, 2 months and 9 days, equivalent to legal 21 years, 5 months and 3 days, Bobbins was freed.https://groups.yahoo.com/group/PpvCTJDox/files/ Vivian and Anders Hultman belatedly protested the release in media.|$|E
40|$|The Restatement (Second) of Agency {{and several}} states provide {{that a third}} party suing an {{undisclosed}} principal and his agent must elect to take judgment against one, releasing the other from further liability. In contrast, when {{the existence of a}} principal but not his identity is disclosed at the time of agreement, a court may enter judgment against both the partially disclosed principal and his agent, releasing neither until the judgment is satisfied. The authors examine the theories and case law supporting the election doctrine in the light of public policy favoring complete disclosure. The authors conclude that a rule of release upon <b>satisfaction</b> <b>of</b> <b>judgment</b> should be applied to undisclosed principals and their agents. In the context of a partially disclosed principal, however, courts should consider applying a rule of election to encourage full disclosure...|$|E

McCrary successfully argued that the district court erred in not including pre-offer prejudgment interest in its comparison between the total amount awarded and the offer of judgment, for cost-shifting purposes. Bianco unsuccessfully argued that he should receive an offset under the repair contract. McCrary unsuccessfully argued that the offer of judgment was invalid for lack of service and failure to file in a timely manner.

Its main divisions and titles {{are those of the}} standard casebooks. There is an opening chapter (the least imaginative and least adequate of the book) on the nature of law, general definitions, and property classifications. This is followed by eight chapters on the acquisition and transfer of rights in personal property: original acquisition, finding, adverse possession, judgment and <b>satisfaction</b> <b>of</b> <b>judgment,</b> accession and confusion, gift (of chattels and of choses in action), sale (largely of the rights of the bona fide purchaser). Next come six chapters on questions arising 2 ̆ 2 when one person has a limited interest in the personal property of another: 2 ̆ 2 bailments (nature and distinctions, rights and duties, special types—including common carriers and innkeepers), liens (parties possessed and enforcement, transfer, and loss), and pledges.

5000|$|A writ of {{execution}} (also known as an execution) is a court order granted to put in force a <b>judgment</b> <b>of</b> possession obtained by a plaintiff from a court. When issuing a writ {{of execution}}, a court typically will order a sheriff or other similar official to take possession of property owned by a judgment debtor. Such property will often then be sold in a sheriff's sale and the proceeds remunerated to the plaintiff in partial or full <b>satisfaction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>judgment.</b> It is generally considered preferable for the sheriff simply to take possession of money from the defendant's bank account. If the judgment debtor owns real property, the judgment creditor can record the execution to [...] "freeze" [...] the title until the execution is satisfied.|$|R
50|$|It {{was found}} that the {{plaintiff}} could not sue the collector; for he has done his duty, and no suit lies against him. Unless the plaintiff has a cause of action against the defendants, he is without remedy. To hold that the facts of this case do not give a cause of action against them would be to decide that a citizen might be subjected to a willful and malicious injury at the hands of private persons without redress; that an organized band of conspirators could, without subjecting themselves to any liability, fraudulently and maliciously obstruct and defeat the process of the courts, issued for the <b>satisfaction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>judgment</b> <b>of</b> a private suitor, and thus render the judgment nugatory and worthless. Such a conclusion would be contrary to the principles of the common law and of right and justice.|$|R
5000|$|Elegit (Latin for he has chosen) was, in English law, a {{judicial}} writ of execution, {{given by the}} Statute of Westminster II (1285), and so called from {{the words of the}} writ, that the plaintiff has chosen (elegit) this mode <b>of</b> <b>satisfaction.</b> Previously to the Statute of Westminster II, a judgment creditor could only have the profits of lands of a debtor in <b>satisfaction</b> <b>of</b> his <b>judgment,</b> but not the possession of the lands themselves. But this statute provided that henceforth it should be in the election of the party having recovered judgment to have a writ of fieri facias unto the sheriff on lands and goods or else ail the chattels of the debtor and the one half of his lands until the judgment be satisfied. Since the Bankruptcy Act 1883 the writ of elegit has extended to lands and hereditaments only.|$|R
50|$|The term {{judgment}} {{proof is}} {{most commonly used}} in tort and contract law contexts to refer to defendants or potential defendants who are financially insolvent. Even if a plaintiff were to secure a legal judgment against an insolvent defendant, the defendant's lack of funds would make the <b>satisfaction</b> <b>of</b> that <b>judgment</b> difficult, if not impossible, to secure. In such cases plaintiffs might move for wage garnishment based on the judgment. However, if the debtor is living on income from social security benefits, a retirement pension, or other social welfare, then {{this may not be}} possible, as such income is often subject to legal protections against garnishment by creditors, alternatively, the amount that can be recovered may be insufficient to cover ongoing legal expenses and related costs, making collection attempts uneconomical.|$|R
40|$|If the {{creditor}} {{should not have}} the aid of attachment to recover on unliquidated demands, why not? It is true that attachment as a security for the <b>satisfaction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>judgment</b> that may be recovered in an action pending or just commenced was unknown to the general common law of England, and existed only in a restricted form as a special custom of London and {{other places in the}} form of garnishment till it was introduced into the New England colonies by an early statute of Massachusetts, whence its utility commended it so that it was soon adopted in all the colonies. Therefore, it may be said that if there is no authority for attachment on unliquidated demands under the statute there is no authority at all-that the proceeding is purely statutory, and authority must be found in the statute for each case...|$|R

5000|$|For example, in California, a {{judgment}} creditor must file an [...] "Acknowledgment <b>of</b> <b>Satisfaction</b> <b>of</b> Judgment" [...] {{where it has}} been paid in full by the judgment debtor within 15 days <b>of</b> the <b>judgment</b> debtor's request. This document has the effect of formally closing the case and terminating any ongoing garnishment arrangements or liens. In Saskatchewan, upon either the <b>satisfaction</b> or withdrawal <b>of</b> a <b>judgment,</b> {{a judgment}} debtor can seek a discharge <b>of</b> <b>judgment.</b> If successful, the judgment is removed from the Judgment Registry and detached from any property registered on the Personal Property registry, titles, or interests in land.|$|R
40|$|Based on {{the idea}} that overpaid people are in {{conflict}} between hedonic principles (i. e., what makes them pleased) and what they believe to be right, two studies tested the hypothesis that it should be relatively difficult for people to make satisfaction judgments regarding outcomes in which they are being advantaged. In line with this hypothesis, Study 1 demonstrated that response latencies <b>of</b> <b>satisfaction</b> <b>judgments</b> were longer when participants were being overpaid, compared to when they were underpaid or equally paid. Study 2 extended these findings by demonstrating that people required more time to make satisfaction judgments when they were overpaid {{in the context of a}} close relationship (i. e., in which the conflict between hedonic and concerns for the other's need should be stronger) than when overpaid in the context of a non-close relationship. Theoretical implications regarding the social-cognitive processes underlying reactions to overpayment are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{expectancy}} disconfirmation {{model has}} dominated private-sector research on customer satisfaction for several decades, {{yet it has}} not been applied to citizen satisfaction with urban services. The model views satisfaction judgments as determined-not just by product or service performance-but by a process in which consumers compare performance with their prior expectations. Using data from a New York City citizen survey, this study finds that citizen expectations, and especially the disconfirmation of expectations-factors that previously have not been considered in empirical studies of the determinants of citizen satisfaction-play a fundamental role in the formation <b>of</b> <b>satisfaction</b> <b>judgments</b> regarding the quality of urban services. Interestingly, the modeling results suggest that urban managers should seek to promote not only high-quality services, but also high expectations among citizens. Additional implications for research and public management practice are discussed. © 2004 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management. ...|$|R

40|$|This study investigates how people's {{satisfaction}} {{judgments are}} modified after {{they interact with}} other group members. It integrates research on customer satisfaction and social influence to develop hypotheses about how an individual's satisfaction is influenced by discrepancies between her expectations about the <b>satisfaction</b> <b>of</b> other group members and their actual opinions as revealed in group discussion. It also considers how this effect is moderated by the individual's susceptibility to social influence and perceptions of group cohesiveness. Two empirical studies demonstrate significant social influence effects on satisfaction judgments in groups. Study One analyzes group satisfaction data collected over time using a mixed-effects regression. It shows that an individual's perceived discrepancy between others' satisfaction judgments and expected group satisfaction has an important influence on her postdiscussion satisfaction judgments. Moreover, individuals discount the prediscussion <b>satisfaction</b> <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> other group members in favor <b>of</b> perceived <b>satisfaction</b> and its discrepancy with expectations. Group cohesiveness accentuates the perceived discrepancy with expected group satisfaction. Study Two analyzes survey data from dyads drawn from a cross-sectional sample of organizational buyers who purchase from the same supplier. It models the decision maker's satisfaction with a service supplier as a function <b>of</b> end-user <b>satisfaction.</b> It shows that social influence effects exist in purchasing groups within organizations. Both studies demonstrate that individual-level postdiscussion satisfaction judgments tend to become more extreme, a phenomenon we call. satisfaction, social influence, organizational buying decisions, group cohesiveness, escalation...|$|R
