40|$|The aim of {{this report}} is to effect of {{sensitization}} treatment of the low cycle fatigue and post-fatigue tensile properties of a non-conventional austenitic stainless steel. The metallurgical investigation of <b>solution</b> <b>annealed</b> as well as sensitizedstainless steels were carried out {{in order to determine}} the microstructural characteristics, hardness, grain size distribution, tensile and low cycle fatigue properties and finally to determine the dislocation densities of the deformed specimens. The microstructure of the selected steel in <b>solution</b> <b>annealed</b> condition reveals that the steel owns nearly equiaxed austenite grains with annealing twins throughout the matrix. The grain size measurement was carried out by the aid of line intercept method for all materials and average grain size of as-received steel was found 23. 49 ± 4. 40 µm. Tensile and low cycle fatigue tests of the samples were carried out by using universal testing machine of ± 100 kN capacity. The results indicate that the steel cyclically softens in both <b>solution</b> <b>annealed</b> as well as sensitized conditions. This nature of softening is also seen in the post-fatigue tensile tested samples. The fractographic analyses indicate that the fracture surfaces of the sensitized specimens are predominantly of typical rock candy type fracture whereas dimple fracture was observed in the <b>solution</b> <b>annealed</b> sample. Typical dislocation density in the deformed specimen assessed by X-ray diffraction profile analyses, is 6. 2804 × 1015 m- 2 in case of <b>solution</b> <b>annealed</b> sample while in sensitized steel specimens this range is 9. 0575 × 1014 m- 2.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} is to study the effect of ratcheting behavior on a sensitized non-conventional austenitic stainless steel. The metallurgical investigation of <b>solution</b> <b>annealed</b> as well as sensitized stainless steels were carried out {{in order to determine}} the microstructural characteristics, hardness, grain size distribution, tensile properties, ratcheting behavior and post-ratcheting tensile properties of differently heat treated stainless steel specimens. The microstructural examinations have been done with the help of optical microscope and scanning electron microscope. The microstructure of the selected steel in <b>solution</b> <b>annealed</b> condition reveals that the steel owns nearly equiaxed austenite grains with annealing twins throughout the matrix. The phenomenon of plastic strain accumulation due to asymmetric cyclic loading is known as ratcheting. Stress-controlled cyclic loading experiments have been carried out at room temperature for constant mean stress levels with varying stress amplitudes after each 50 cycles. Cyclic loading rate for stress control test is 50 MPa/s. Ratcheting deformation is found to increase with increase in stress amplitude values for constant values of stress mean. However, the rate of strain accumulation increases with increasing stress amplitude. The analyses of stress-strain results indicate that the steel cyclically softens in both <b>solution</b> <b>annealed</b> as well as sensitized conditions. This nature of softening is also seen in the post-fatigue tensile tested samples. The YS and TS value of unratcheted tensile as well as post ratcheted tensile steel samples were found to reduce.

40|$|Corrosion place a {{high cost}} on {{the society and}} {{selecting}} the wrong materials in certain environments may have catastrophic consequences. When selecting materials {{there is also the}} different manufacturing methods to consider and there might be a difference in corrosion resistance depending on the way the material is manufactured. Also even high grade stainless steels like super duplex may suffer from corrosion in a specific environment. The scope of the thesis compares the manufacturing methods solution annealing and cold straining on a super duplex stainless steel, and the potential effect on stress corrosion cracking and pitting resistance. Earlier research indicates that there might be some uncertainties regarding this, and the amount of research in this field was lacking compared to studies on austenitic stainless steels. The objective of this thesis was to develop a test setup using modified versions of the ASTM G 36 and G 44 standards testing on as received super duplex stainless steel bolts (UNS S 32760) of both <b>solution</b> <b>annealed</b> and cold strained quality. Tensile testing was performed to determine the elongation at yield, and hence being able to determine the percentage of yield for the experiments. The results of the testing were surprising, as the Young’s modulus was around 50 % less than what was expected, due to testing with a threaded bar instead of a smooth. All of the experiments were performed with the bolts stressed to 100 % of offset yield. For the alternate immersion testing, a test jig was designed and used during the whole experiment which was executed over a time period of 936 hours. This setup used magnesium chloride instead of sodium chloride which was specified in the standard to examine if this would accelerate stress corrosion cracking or pitting corrosion. The results from this experiment showed that the <b>solution</b> <b>annealed</b> bolts seemed to exhibit a higher pitting resistance than the cold strained bolts. Also this experiment indicates that this type of experiment may take too long time to be effective. Four 316 L bolts were also tested in the alternate immersion testing and exhibited obvious pitting as expected. The results however must be considered with caution as only two <b>solution</b> <b>annealed</b> bolts and two cold strained bolts were tested. It is therefore not possible to conclude on this matter. In regards to stress corrosion cracking, no cracks were discovered at 10 X magnification, but further metallographic testing should be performed to verify that no cracks are present. The heated immersion testing in magnesium chloride was performed at 90 ℃ instead of 155 ℃ as specified in the standard. An initial test performed for 316 hours produced fracture in the two <b>solution</b> <b>annealed</b> and two cold strained bolts that were tested. No pitting was observed at 10 X magnification. A second heated immersion test was performed for 156 hours and this test may indicate that there is higher stress corrosion cracking resistance in the <b>solution</b> <b>annealed</b> bolts compared to the cold strained. There was however only two bolts of each type tested in this experiment as well, so {{it is not possible to}} conclude without further experiments. No pitting was observed with 10 X magnification on any of the bolts.

40|$|Abstract. The {{effect of}} {{different}} grain size on the oxidation of Fe- 33 Ni- 19 Cr alloy was discussed. The present paper {{focuses on the}} oxidation behaviour in dry air at temperature of 700 ºC with respect to oxidation kinetics. Solution treatment was applied to Fe- 33 Ni- 19 Cr alloy by means of different <b>solution</b> <b>annealing</b> temperature to alter the average grain size of the specimens. Solution heat treatments were carried out on Fe-Ni-Cr alloys at three different temperatures, namely, 1000 ºC, 1100 ºC and 1200 ºC. The {{results showed that the}} average grain size increased with increase in <b>solution</b> <b>annealing</b> temperature that was significantly affecting the oxidation kinetic of the materials. Optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were employed in this study to analyse the oxidation behaviour of solution-annealed samples. Smaller grain size improves the protective oxidation behaviour by enhancing spallation resistance and reducing oxidation rate. Spallation resistance correlates with a reduction in texture of the oxide layers...|$|R

The dense, aligned, and elongated Y-shaped PFO-DBT nanotubes have been successfully fabricated by aging the PFO-DBT solution for 72 hours. Enhanced light absorption with less light scattering can be exhibited from the elongated Y-shaped PFO-DBT nanotubes. Partial and complete infiltration is governed by 1 hour and 72 hours of aging time, respectively. Preformed nanofibres are initiated {{by the process of}} annealing and aging of PFO-DBT solution. During the aging process, PFO-DBT nanofibres are formed to coat the pores’ wall and replicated the Y-branched nanopores for the production of Y-shaped PFO-DBT nanotubes. The effects of <b>solution</b> <b>annealing</b> and aging process are essential for the improvement on the morphological, structural, and optical properties of Y-shaped PFO-DBT nanotubes...|$|R
