5000|$|A {{tempering}} valve mixes enough {{cold water}} with the hot water from the heater to keep the outgoing water temperature fixed at a more moderate temperature, often set to [...] Without a tempering valve, reduction of the water heater's setpoint temperature is the most direct way to reduce scalding. However, for sanitation, hot water is needed at a temperature that can cause scalding. This may be accomplished by using a <b>supplemental</b> <b>heater</b> in an appliance that requires hotter water.Most residential dishwashing machines, for example, include an internal electric heating element for increasing the water temperature above that provided by a domestic water heater.|$|E
40|$|An {{innovative}} {{control strategy}} for a naturally ventilated (NV) swine finishing building was evaluated. Extensive monitoring {{of an existing}} NV-controlled swine finishing building indicated that the building temperature control was. 3. C of set-point for less than 50 % of the time, with 20 % of the time greater than. 6. C. Based on the experience gained from this monitoring, the building was modified to accommodate testing and {{development of a new}} NV control logic. Using the improved NV control logic, the building temperature was. 2. C of the set-point for 91 % of the time, and,. 3.

40|$|Ventilation {{systems can}} utilize 80 {{percent of the}} total thermal-energy {{requirements}} for a livestock confinement building. Optimizing energy expenditure or environmental control is not possible with conventional controls. Improper adjustment of thermostats can result in ventilation rates above the minimum while the <b>supplemental</b> <b>heater</b> is operating. Thermostats can provide undesirable environmental fluctuations. Variable-speed fan controls have difficulties with accuracy and reliability. Operators avoid the use of complex control systems because of their inability to set the controls properly;A single-board microcomputer was selected to provide logical control of the livestock environment. Inside and outside dry-bulb temperature inputs utilize a semiconductor sensor whose current output varies with absolute dry-bulb temperature. A dew-point temperature sensor measures the moisture content of the environment. The static pressure transducers include diaphragms and linear Hall effect sensors. Fan speeds are counted with pulses from digital Hall effect sensors. Operator inputs, the desired dry-bulb temperatures, are attained with the adjustment of the potentiometers. An 8 -bit analog-to-digital converter is interfaced to the microcomputer;Solid state relays control the power to single-speed fans, <b>supplemental</b> <b>heater</b> solenoids, and air inlet motors for air distribution. Eight-bit digital-to-analog converters provide signals to prototype speed controllers which manipulate variable-speed fans. The direction of the air inlet motors is controlled by electromagnetic relays. The operator adjusts the minimum ventilation rate of the variable-speed fans;Software, located in erasable programmable read-only-memory, presents a rational correlation between the ventilation, supplemental heating, and air distribution systems. The ventilation and supplemental heating systems attempt to provide the desired temperatures. The degree of change in ventilation rates is determined by the outside temperature. Variable-speed and single-speed fans function logically together to reduce abrupt fluctuations in airflow. The dew-point temperature is monitored to limit the relative humidity. The micrcomputer utilizes the fan rpm sensors to prevent winds from stalling variable-speed fans. Static pressure is regulated by the air inlets to maintain uniform air distribution. Fans, for summer ventilation, are utilized only during stressful weather conditions, thus conserving electrical energy. The software is written in mnemonic code and converted to machine language with an assembler;The controller, installed in a swine farrowing and nursery room, is operational and entering the system testing phase. Intensive testing is required before the reliability of the design is proven...|$|E
40|$|The Magellen solar/thermal/vacuum test {{involved}} {{a number of}} unique requirements and approaches. Because {{of the need to}} operate in orbit around Venus, the solar intensity requirement ranged up to 2. 3 suns or Earth equivalent solar constants. Extensive modification to the solar simulator portion of the test facility were required to achieve this solar intensity. Venus albedo and infrared emission were simulated using temperature controlled movable louver panels to allow the spacecraft to view either a selectable temperature black heat source with closed louvers, or the chamber coldwall behind open louvers. The test conditions included widely varying solar intensities, multiple sun angles, alternate hardware configurations, steady state and transient cases, and cruise and orbital power profiles. Margin testing was also performed, wherein <b>supplemental</b> <b>heaters</b> were mounted to internal thermal blankets to verify spacecraft performance at higher than expected temperatures. The test was successful, uncovering some spacecraft anomalies and verifying the thermal design. The test support equipment experienced some anomalous behavior and a significant failure during the test...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to develop a building thermal analysis and air quality predictive (BTA-AQP) model to predict ventilation rate, indoor temperature, and long-term air quality (NH 3, H 2 S, and CO 2 concentrations and emissions) for swine deep-pit buildings. This article, part I of II, presents a lumped capacitance model (BTA model) to predict the transient behavior of ventilation rate and indoor air temperature according to the thermo-physical properties of a typical swine building, setpoint temperature scheme, fan staging scheme, transient outside temperature, and the heat fluxes from pigs and <b>supplemental</b> <b>heaters.</b> The obtained ventilation rate and resulting indoor air temperature, combined with animal growth cycle, in-house manure storage level, and typical meteorological year (TMY 3) data, were used as inputs to the air quality predictive model (part II) based on the generalized regression neural network (GRNN-AQP model), which was presented in an earlier article. The statistical results indicated that the performance of the BTA model for predicting ventilation rate and indoor air temperature was very good in terms of low mean absolute error, a coefficient of mass residual values equal to 0, an index of agreement value close to 1, and Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency values higher than 0. 65. Graphical presentations of predicted vs. actual ventilation rate and indoor temperature are provided to demonstrate that the BTA model was able to accurately estimate indoor climate and therefore could be used as input for the GRNN-AQP model discussed in part II of this research...|$|R
5000|$|One reason MELs are {{difficult}} to reduce is because the use of small electric devices are controlled directly by a building’s inhabitants. One way to reduce MELs is {{by the use of}} energy feedback devices which report real-time energy use to a house’s occupants. The use of these devices has been tested in numerous studies which suggest whole-house savings of 5%-15%. [...] With recent advances in technology, energy feedback devices can be purchased for $100-$150. Feedback devices allow people to identify and reduce standby power and as well as cut back on unnecessary power draws. In addition, occupants can see the effects of running pool pumps/heaters, <b>supplemental</b> space <b>heaters,</b> air conditioners, etc.Energy feedback devices can further assist zero energy buildings, where it is desirable to align electric loads with photovoltaic panel output.|$|R

40|$|MBTOC: data must be {{provided}} to demonstrate that <b>supplemental</b> <b>heater</b> cannot be used to increase the efficacy of SF MBTOC: after 10 years, efforts must {{have been made to}} prevent re-infestation in storage or ability to use something other than MBr EPA ANALYSIS: Technical: Insufficient evidence to estimate number of facilities with high pest pressure Insufficient evidence to estimate loss of commodity due to pests Walnut applicant supplied ambient low temperatures during winter, but not warehouse/commodity temperature. New pest feeds on mold, and requires high relative humidity to survive [...] occurrence indicates sanitation problem, not need for MBr. Stored product pests not active at temperatures near 55 °F; in fact, USDA recommends storage at 55 °F or below for insect & pathogen prevention. No evidence that fumigation at these temperatures is critical. Data indicate Sulfuryl Fluoride (SF) effective against key pests. Low temperature data demonstrate lack of performance on pest eggs (esp. dried fruit beetle (DFB); but storage/harvest temperatures not provided. Also variable results in studies. Applicants told MBTOC during Fall 2010 conference call that 90 + % of industry had transitioned to SF because MBr was either too expensive or unavailable. Economic (Walnut Example) : SF treatment for a facility is $ 4, 000 less than MeBr SF treatment plus heat is $ 4, 000 more expensive than MeBr (due to cost of equipment) {{despite the fact that the}} cost of the heat is somewhat offset by the reduced need for sulfuryl fluoride A yearly program with 2 SF treatments added to 1 SF treatment plus heat is ~ $ 4, 000 less than 3 treatments of MeBr per year Net revenue for fumigated quantities is over $ 440 million dollars per year so cost difference is 0. 00 % of gross revenue (less than 1 / 100 th of a percent). Regulatory Constraints: None; SF registered for these uses...|$|E
