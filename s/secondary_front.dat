25|$|The 4RM {{system used}} in the Ferrari FF in 2011 is unique in {{that it has a}} rear {{transaxle}} with <b>secondary</b> <b>front</b> transaxle connected directly to the engine. The car operates primarily as a rear wheel drive vehicle. Clutches in the front transaxle engage when the rear wheels slip. Drive to the front wheels is transmitted through two infinitely-variable clutch packs which are allowed to 'slip' to give the required road wheel speeds. The front transaxle has three gears, two forward, and reverse. The two forward gears of the front transmission match the lower four forward gears of the rear transmission. It is not used in higher gears. The connection between this gearbox and each front wheel is via independent haldex-type clutches, without a differential. Due to the difference in ratios the clutches continually slip and only transmit, at most, 20% of the engine's torque.|$|E

[...] Many Iraqis assumed the 1st BCT was {{preparing}} for exactly that type of operation, with over 77 M1 Abrams tanks and 84 Bradley Fighting Vehicles, but Colonel MacFarland had another plan. Prior to Ramadi, the 1st BCT had been stationed in {{the northern city of}} Tal Afar, where Colonel H. R. McMaster in 2005 had pioneered a new type of operation: [...] "Clear, Hold, Build". Under McMaster's approach, his commanders saturated an area with soldiers until it had been cleared of insurgents, then held it until Iraqi security forces were gradually built to a level where they could assume control. As in other offensive operations, many insurgents fled the city in anticipation of a big battle. The 1st BCT moved into some of Ramadi's most dangerous neighborhoods and, beginning in July, built four of what would eventually become eighteen Combat Outposts. The soldiers brought the territory under control and inflicted many casualties on the insurgents in the process. On 24 July, AQI launched a counterattack, launching 24 assaults, each with about 100 fighters, on American positions. Despite the reported presence of AQI leader Abu Ayyub al-Masri, the insurgents failed in all of their attacks and lost about 30 men. Several senior American officers, including General David Petraeus, later compared the fighting to the Battle of Stalingrad. Despite the success, Multi-National Force– Iraq continued to view Ramadi as a <b>secondary</b> <b>front</b> to the ongoing civil war in Baghdad and considered moving two of Colonel MacFarland's battalions to Baghdad. Colonel MacFarland even publicly described his operations as [...] "trying to take the heat off Baghdad." ...|$|E

40|$|SummaryLittle {{is known}} about how {{neutrophils}} and other cells establish a single zone of actin assembly during migration. A widespread assumption is that the leading edge prevents formation of additional fronts by generating long-range diffusible inhibitors or by sequestering essential polarity components. We use morphological perturbations, cell-severing experiments, and computational simulations to show that diffusion-based mechanisms are not sufficient for long-range inhibition by the pseudopod. Instead, plasma membrane tension {{could serve as a}} long-range inhibitor in neutrophils. We find that membrane tension doubles during leading-edge protrusion, and increasing tension is sufficient for long-range inhibition of actin assembly and Rac activation. Furthermore, reducing membrane tension causes uniform actin assembly. We suggest that tension, rather than diffusible molecules generated or sequestered at the leading edge, is the dominant source of long-range inhibition that constrains the spread of the existing front and prevents the formation of <b>secondary</b> <b>fronts.</b> Video Abstrac...|$|R
40|$|The Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF), in {{combination}} with travel-time parameterization, provides a robust and flexible method for quantitative multi-model history matching to time-lapse seismic data. A disadvantage of the parameterization in terms of travel-times is that it requires simulation of models beyond the update time. A new distance parameterization is proposed for fronts, or more generally, for isolines of arbitrary seismic attributes, that circumvents the necessity of additional simulation time. An accurate Fast Marching Method for solution of the Eikonal equation in Cartesian grids {{is used to calculate}} distances between observed and simulated fronts which are subsequently used as innovations in the EnKF. Experiments are presented that demonstrate the functioning of the method in synthetic 1 D and 2 D cases that include uncertain model properties, and merging or multiple <b>secondary</b> <b>fronts.</b> Results are compared with those resulting from direct use of saturation data. The proposed algorithm significantly reduces the number of data while still capturing the essential information, it removes the need for seismic inversion when the oil-water front is identified only, and it produces a more favorable distribution of simulated data, leading to improved functioning of the EnKF...|$|R

Following the reorganization of the Panzertruppen in 1940/41, it was relegated to the role of reconnaissance tank. During the Campaign in the West in 1940 and early stage of the Invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, Panzerkampfwagen II served mainly as reconnaissance but were often used as combat tanks and many were lost to Soviet tanks and anti-tanks.

Afterwards, it was used to great effect as a reconnaissance tank, and when removed from front-line duty, it was used for training and on <b>secondary</b> <b>fronts.</b> The Panzerkampfwagen II tanks were also used in North Africa, by the German Afrika Korps, with some success as the nature of the battlefield was more mobile and shortages of equipment forced Rommel to use them lacking updated replacements.|$|R

40|$|For {{efficient}} polarity and migration, cells need {{to regulate}} the magnitude and spatial distribution of actin assembly. This process is coordinated by reciprocal interactions between the actin cytoskeleton and mechanical forces. Actin polymerization-based protrusion increases tension in the plasma membrane, which in turn acts as a long-range inhibitor of actin assembly. These interactions form a negative feedback circuit that limits the magnitude of membrane tension in neutrophils and prevents expansion of the existing front {{and the formation of}} <b>secondary</b> <b>fronts.</b> It has been suggested that the plasma membrane directly inhibits actin assembly by serving as a physical barrier that opposes protrusion. Here we show that efficient control of actin polymerization-based protrusion requires an additional mechanosensory feedback cascade that indirectly links membrane tension with actin assembly. Specifically, elevated membrane tension acts through phospholipase D 2 (PLD 2) and the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC 2) to limit actin nucleation. In the absence of this pathway, neutrophils exhibit larger leading edges, higher membrane tension, and profoundly defective chemotaxis. Mathematical modeling suggests roles for both the direct (mechanical) and indirect (biochemical via PLD 2 and mTORC 2) feedback loops in organizing cell polarity and motility-the indirect loop is better suited to enable competition between fronts, whereas the direct loop helps spatially organize actin nucleation for efficient leading edge formation and cell movement. This circuit is essential for polarity, motility, and the control of membrane tension...|$|R

As maiores freqüências de precipitação em frentes frias, quentes, em ondas em frentes frias e em nebulosidades ciclogenéticas ocorreram no ano de El Niño. As precipitações nas frentes oclusas e secundárias foram mais freqüentes no ano de La Niña.
