L. Benabid et al. (1991) Lancet, 337, 403 - 406]. The TC relay neuron selectively responded to and <b>relayed</b> <b>synchronized</b> GPi inputs bursting at a frequency located in the range 2 - 25 Hz. Input selectivity of the TC relay neuron is dictated by low-threshold calcium current dynamics and passive membrane properties of the neuron. STN-DBS prevented the TC relay neuron from <b>relaying</b> <b>synchronized</b> GPi oscillations to cortex. Our model indicates that DBS alters BG output and input selectivity of the TC relay neuron, providing an explanation for the clinically observed inverse relationship between DBS frequency and stimulus amplitude...|$|R

Also, {{we assume that}} the states of the channel are known perfectly to all terminals in which they can be estimated at the receivers and fed back to the transmitters. Thus, we assume perfect channel state information at the receivers (CSIR) and perfect channel state information at the transmitters (CSIT), and that these CSIs remain constant over a transmission period. We also assume that we have perfect decoding at the relay and the destination.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} new {{strategy}} at the local (substation) level, aimed at preventing or mitigating the cascading blackouts that involve relay misoperations or inadequate local diagnostic support. The strategy consists of an advanced real-time tool that combines neural network based fault detection and classification (NNFDC) algorithm and synchronized sampling based fault location (SSFL) algorithm with a relay monitoring tool using event tree analysis (ETA). The fault analysis tool provides a reference for conventional distance relay with its better performance and the relay monitoring tool provides detailed local information about the disturbances.

40|$|Abstract—Relay misoperations play an {{important}} role in cascading blackouts. Power swing and out-of-step conditions caused by large disturbances in the system may result in relay misoperations. This effect is analyzed and simulated in this paper. Synchronized sampling based fault location (SSFL) algorithm was proposed as part of an advanced fault analysis tool to give precise fault information and verify relay judgments. This paper further analyzes the algorithm under power swing and out-ofstep conditions and tests it by both static and dynamic scenarios generated in ATP. The test results indicate that SSFL algorithm performs better than distance relay under power swing and outof-step conditions and can be used as a robust fault analysis tool for practical use.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the use of}} power line communication (PLC) to assist cooperative wireless relaying. We consider a communication scheme that uses the power line to initialize and <b>synchronize</b> wireless amplify-and-forward <b>relays</b> and to broadcast information between the relays. Starting from an analysis of transfer functions and noise measurements of PLC channels in office and residential environments, we propose a power line transmission scheme for the inter-relay-communication and assess the influence of this scheme on wireless relaying. This scheme is based on linear precoded orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing; {{it is designed to}} optimally exploit the frequency diversity available on PLC channels. The use of PLC leads to a very flexible way of enhancing wireless communications by plugging in additional relays where they are needed—without additional wiring.

40|$|There {{are many}} {{applications}} of precise {{time and time}} interval (frequency) in operating modern electric power systems. Many generators and customer loads are operated in parallel. The reliable transfer of electrical power to the consumer partly depends on measuring power system frequency consistently in many locations. The internal oscillators in the widely dispersed frequency measuring units must be syntonized. Elaborate protection and control systems guard the high voltage equipment from short and open circuits. For the highest reliability of electric service, engineers need to study all control system operations. Precise timekeeping networks aid {{in the analysis of}} power system operations by synchronizing the clocks on recording instruments. Utility engineers want to reproduce events that caused loss of service to customers. Precise timekeeping networks can <b>synchronize</b> protective <b>relay</b> test-sets. For dependable electrical service, all generators and large motors must remain close to speed synchronism. The stable response of a power system to perturbations is critical to continuity of electrical service. Research shows that measurement of the power system state vector can aid in the monitoring and control of system stability. If power system operators know that a lightning storm is approaching a critical transmission line or transformer, they can modify operating strategies. Knowledge of the location of a short circuit fault can speed the re-energizing of a transmission line. One fault location technique requires clocks synchronized to one microsecond. Current research seeks to find out if one microsecond timekeeping can aid and improve power system control and operation...|$|R
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 22 - 25, 1984 / Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas, NevadaA {{system has}} been {{developed}} to simultaneously sample and transmit digital data from five remote geophysical data receiver stations to a control station that processes, displays, and stores the data. A microprocessor in each remote station receives commands from the control station over a single telemetry channel. The commands adjust the sensing amplifier’s input voltage range (1 microvolt to 2 volts peak-to-peak), the number of samples (128 to 30, 000), the sampling rate (256 to 32, 768 samples/sec), {{and the number of}} signals (1 to 16) to average at the remote stations. A 12 bit analog-to-digital converter samples data with bandwidths of 100 Hz to 10 kHz for time periods selected from 100 seconds to 1 second, respectively. Each remote station begins sampling geophysical signals when it receives a <b>synchronizing</b> pulse <b>relayed</b> from the control station. Digitized geophysical data is transmitted to the control station over broadband (100 kHz bandwidth) UHF telemetry channels using standard asynchronous serial (19. 2 kbaud) techniques and hardware dropout detection and recovery. The amount of data (480 kbits) and the maximum time to transmit data (30 secs) dictate using broadband telemetry (even though most geophysical telemetry is less than 10 kHz in bandwidth). Header information (transmitted before the data) contains station number, digital sampling parameters, transmission block size, and checksum. This information is used by a computer program (in a PDP- 11 / 23 (***) minicomputer) to maintain up to 5 simultaneous Direct Memory Access (DMA) transfers from the remote stations into 5 separate data buffers. Filled buffers are transfered (via an IEEE- 488 bus) to an interactive analysis and display system (HP 9845 C (***)) for selecting data to be stored on magnetic media for subsequent laboratory analysis...|$|R
40|$|A single {{injection}} of the benzodiazepine triazolam, which is though to act by potentiating {{the effects of}} the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), can induce permanent phase shifts in the circadian rhythm of locomotor activity of hamsters. Occurrence of GABA immunoreactivity and benzodiazepine receptors in the retina, which contains photoreceptors that <b>relay</b> <b>synchronizing</b> light-dark information to the mammalian circadian system, raises the possibility that triazolam may influence circadian rhythmicity via an action on the retina. However, the phase shifting effects of triazolam on the activity rhythm were unaffected by blinding: the direction and the magnitude of the phase shifts were similar in blind hamsters and in sighted hamsters maintained in constant darkness. Furthermore, no change in response to triazolam was observed in hamsters studied through 84 days after blinding. In addition, benzodiazepine binding sites have been found in the mammalian pineal gland, which has also been implicated in circadian rhythmicity. Therefore, its possible involvement in mediating the phase advancing effects of triazolam on the circadian clock has also been tested: the response was similar in blind and blind-pinealectomized animals. These results indicate that the effects of triazolam on the circadian clock are not mediated by the eyes or the pineal gland. Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S. Gov'tResearch Support, U. S.

40|$|Companion plant {{intercropping}} involves {{growing a}} cash crop with another plant {{that is not}} harvested, to confer a set of benefits on the crop and the environment. Weed control and herbicide use reduction {{are one of the}} principal reasons for adopting this approach. Companion plants should compete with weeds for light, nutrients and water, but they may also compete with the crop. The species grown must therefore be carefully chosen and managed so as to outcompete weeds but limit competition with the crop and yield loss. In this meta-analysis, we aimed to quantify the effects of companion plants on weed regulation and cash crop yields, and to analyze their sources of variability. We reviewed different intercropping systems involving an annual cash crop and a legume companion plant from around the world. We report data from 34 scientific articles, corresponding to 476 experimental units (i. e. combinations of site × year × cash crop × legume companion plant species × agricultural practices), and we explore whether intercropping with legume companion plants can control weeds while maintaining crop yield. Yield and weed biomass ratios were analyzed as response variables. We used the type of cash crop (straw cereals, maize or other crops), the methods used to establish the companion plants (living mulch, <b>synchronized</b> sowing or <b>relay</b> intercropping) and the overlap between the growth periods of the companion plants and the cash crop as explanatory variables. Intercropping with a companion plant resulted in a lower weed biomass and a higher yield (win-win situation) than non-weeded or weeded control treatments, in 52 % and 36 %, respectively, of the experimental units considered. A higher weed biomass associated with a lower yield (lose-lose) was observed in only 13 % and 26 % of the experimental units, in comparisons with non-weeded and weeded control treatments, respectively. Considering all the experimental units together, the companion plants had no significant effect on cash crop yield, but significantly decreased weed biomass, by 56 % relatively to a non-weeded control treatment, and 42 % relative to a weeded control treatment. The greatest benefits from companion plant intercropping were reported for maize, with yields 37 % higher than those for non-weeded control treatments. The other explanatory variables tested had no significant effect on yield or weed control. Thus, the use of legume companion plants generally seems to enhance weed control without reducing crop yield, but the conditions giving rise to win-win situations should be explored further, to encourage the spread of this technique among farmers...|$|R
