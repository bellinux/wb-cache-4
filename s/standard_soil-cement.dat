40|$|A {{memorandum}} of Agreement {{has been written}} between the Soil Conservation Service and the Bureau of Reclamation, relative to the experimental installation of test section of soil-cement and asphaltic canal lining to determine their durability and permeability. These test sections are to be installed at the Experimental Station, Logan, Utah. The Bureau of Reclamation requests two types of soil for the soil-cement studies, a fine sandy soil, poorly graded {{with little or no}} silt (Classification Symbol SP) and a find sandy soil with excess silt (Classification Symbol SF-Silty). The gradation limits for these two soil types are shown of Figures 1 and 2. Three soil samples were transmitted by letter of November 12, 1947, from DR. C. W. Lauritzen. Gradation tests on these soils revealed that two of the samples were too fine to provide suitable soil-cement lining but that the Trenton find sandy loam would satisfy the 2 ̆ 2 SF-Silty 2 ̆ 2 requirement. The soil-cement tests have been completed on this material and additional soil of the 2 ̆ 2 SP 2 ̆ 2 type has been reported by letter from R. F. Blanks to the Soil Conservation Service, Dated January, 16, 1948. Summary The laboratory tests indicate that the Trenton fine sandy loam, Laboratory Soil NO. 11 H- 24, can be mixed with portland cement to produce a canal lining of satisfactory hardness, durability, and permeability. A <b>standard</b> <b>soil-cement</b> mixture containing a minimum of 12 percent cement by volume) 3. 24 sacks of cement per cubic yard) compacted to maximum density at optimum moisture content should produce a suitable canal lining...|$|E
40|$|Abstract In {{order to}} {{contribute}} to the sustainability of the foundry and construction industrial sectors, this work investigated the possibility of employing used foundry sand (UFS) in soil-cement bricks. Modular bricks were prepared with percentages of 10 wt% cement, 0 - 25 wt% commercial sand, 0 - 65 wt% used foundry sand, 25 - 65 wt% clay, and 15 - 30 wt% gravel dust. A content of 10 wt% Portland cement was adopted to ensure economic feasibility, and gravel was used to improve mechanical strength. The modular bricks were tested to determine their technical properties. The interfaces between the constituent materials were observed by scanning electron microscopy. In durability tests, the bricks showed water absorption and weight loss in accordance with current technical standards. The addition of UFS together with gravel dust reduced water absorption and provided an acceptable level of mechanical resistance, in accordance with established <b>soil-cement</b> <b>standards...</b>|$|R
