5|$|Dyer was {{a popular}} choice with boxing promoters, helped {{by the fact that}} after each bout he would sing Thora, a popular hit of the day to the audience. His careers as a pugilist and {{baritone}} earned him the nickname, 'The Singing Boxer'. His first few bouts were all held in south Wales, but by the autumn of 1910 he was travelling to England to fight, and on 10 October 1910 he was invited to fight at the National <b>Sporting</b> <b>Club</b> in Covent Garden, London. On 15 May 1911 Dyer was scheduled to fight Dick Emden at The Ring in Blackfriars, London. To date, Dyer had recorded over 15 bouts and was unbeaten but the fight with Emden ended in defeat and affected his future boxing career. Dyer was easily ahead in the bout, when in the fifth round he dislocated his knee and fell to the canvas in agony. Emden, who taunted the fallen Dyer, was given the victory and Dyer would not fight for another six months. The injury to his right knee plagued Dyer throughout his entire boxing career, and also stopped him serving in the armed forces during the First World War. After the injury, Dyer always fought with a protector strapped around his knee, and was forced to change his fighting style. He would always stand on the toes of his right foot, as a quick back step could possibly dislocate his knee again. His return bout in November 1911 was a win against Young Lilley at The Ring, but this was again followed by a long absence. Dyer did not fight again until 1 June 1912.|$|E

This study aims to assess the health promotion orientation of both youth and adult <b>sports</b> <b>clubs</b> in Flanders and to identify the motives and barriers as reported by their representatives {{as a basis for}} proposing intervention strategies to improve the health promotion orientation in <b>sports</b> <b>clubs.</b> A total of 253 Flemish <b>sports</b> <b>clubs,</b> consisting of 156 youth <b>sports</b> <b>clubs</b> and of 97 adult <b>sports</b> <b>clubs,</b> completed the online questionnaire, covering club characteristics (e. g. finances, human resources…), perceived motives and barriers for health promotion, and the Health Promoting <b>Sports</b> <b>Club</b> Index. Even though <b>sports</b> <b>clubs</b> focusing on youth were more health promoting than those with adult members only, the results indicated that all <b>sports</b> <b>clubs</b> could improve their health promotion orientation, The most consistent predictors of health promotion orientation are Perceived Motives Index for youth <b>sports</b> <b>clubs</b> and Perceived Lack of Resources for adult <b>sports</b> <b>clubs,</b> respectively [...] Based on these results, interventions to enhance the health promoting orientation need to tackle the lack of resources such as lack of expertise regarding health promotion. Interventions aimed specifically at youth <b>sports</b> <b>clubs</b> should emphasize the direct benefits, for example by demonstrating how health promotion helps clubs to improve the provision of high quality sports participation and by awarding a health promotion quality label. status: publishe...|$|R
