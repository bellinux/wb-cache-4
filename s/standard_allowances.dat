5000|$|By 1705, {{when he was}} in his mid-thirties, Brerewood {{was already}} a man of {{considerable}} personal fortune. Having trained as a linen Draper, or cloth merchant, he followed the money into cloth brokering and international trade. As early as 1700 he had established himself as an army regimental agent, the civilian employed by the colonel in charge of each regiment to act as paymaster and to provide uniforms. An agent earned a few hundred pounds a year in <b>standard</b> <b>allowances</b> but made his real money selling the army his cloth and lending money to officers at exorbitant rates. A single clothing assignment to a regiment might bring Brerewood thousands of pounds, and he loaned money with one hundred percent penalties for late repayment.In the years before the Pitkin Affair broke, Brerewood served as an agent to some of the leading army commanders of the day. He was the paymaster for the Duke of Marlborough’s battalion in England while Marlborough was the commander-in-chief of the English army fighting in the Netherlands against the French during the War of the Spanish Succession (1701-1712). He also acted as agent for the regiments of the Duke of Schombergh; of Colonel Cadogen, the commander of a cavalry company; of Lieutenant-Colonel John Bristow of the First Foot Guards; and of the Duke of Northumberland, who would become Brerewood’s particular patron.Obtaining agencies of such prominence required Brerewood to have the patronage of men of the highest rank and to have the wherewithal to bear the cost of clothing assignments for the years it took to recoup the investment from the soldiers’ off-reckonings, or the amount deducted from their pay for uniforms and equipment. Coming from a prominent family, Brerewood did not lack for either connections or wealth. He had apprenticed with his prosperous uncle, a linen draper in London. He had two houses in London: one in town and another in the village of Turnham Green on the western outskirts of the city. He also held a number of properties in Chester, including two shops in the commercial centre. He engaged in trade to continental Europe and the American colonies, and he had at least some stock investments. But this economic success did not satisfy Brerewood. From what it is known about his activities in the years before the Pitkin Affair, he moved from scam to scam, perhaps because, as counsel for Pitkin’s creditors opined in testimony before the House of Lords, he “thought he was not rich enough.”, ...|$|E

40|$|SYNOPSIS In {{order to}} {{determine}} the cause of a perinatal death it is important to correlate the postmortem findings with the clinical histories of both mother and infant. The postmortem examin-ation of a newborn infant differs from that of an adult in a number of ways, especially in the method of removal and dissection of the brain, the examination of the cervical spine, the dissection of the cardiovascular system for congenital abnormalities, and the examination ofthe placenta. A systematic technique for performing a perinatal necropsy is described. Stress is laid on measurement {{of the size of the}} infant and of the individual organs and comparison of these with known <b>standards,</b> <b>allowance</b> being made for the maturity of the infant. A perinatal postmortem examination may be made for two purposes. First, to obtain as much informa-tion as possible to determine the immediate cause of death of a particular infant. Second, for a wider study along epidemiological lines to ascertain the part played by various factors in causing foetal and infant death. For both these purposes the mother's and infant's case notes should be available to the pathologist. Both naked-eye and histological examination of the tissue is necessary and in still-born foetuses the placenta should always be examined; microbiological and serological studies may also be valuable.

Four dietary treatments, comprising ad libitum access to 1 of 4 forage mixtures plus a <b>standard</b> <b>allowance</b> of 4 kg/d dairy concentrates, were offered. The 4 forage mixtures were, on a dry matter (DM) basis: (1) 100 % grass silage, (2) 66 % grass silage: 34 % red clover silage, (3) 34 % grass silage: 66 % red clover silage, and (4) 100 % red clover silage. In each of 4 experimental periods, there were 21 days for adaptation to diets and 7 days for measurements. There {{was an increase in}} both DM intakes and milk yields as the proportion of red clover in the diet increased. However, the increase in milk yield was not as great as the increase in DM intake, so that the efficiency of milk production, in terms of yield (kg) of milk per kg of DM intake, decreased. The concentrations of protein, milk fat, and the shorter chain saturated fatty acids decreased, whereas C 18 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and long-chain PUFA (C 20 +) increased as the proportion of red clover in the diet increased. There was little effect of dietary treatment on the organoleptic qualities of milk as assessed by taste panel analysis. There were no effects on the aroma of milk, on aftertaste, or overall liking of the milk. Milk was thicker and creamier in color when cows were fed grass silage compared with red clover silage. The flavor of milk was largely unaffected by dietary treatment. In conclusion, increasing the proportion of red clover in the diet of dairy cows increased feed intakes and milk yields, decreased the concentration of fat and protein in milk, increased PUFA for healthiness, and had little effect on milk organoleptic characteristics.
