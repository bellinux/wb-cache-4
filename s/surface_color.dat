500|$|Ida was {{classified}} as an S-type asteroid based on the similarity of its reflectance spectra with similar asteroids. S-types may share their composition with stony-iron or ordinary chondrite (OC) meteorites. The composition of the interior has not been directly analyzed, but {{is assumed to be}} similar to OC material based on observed <b>surface</b> <b>color</b> changes and Ida's bulk density of 2.27–3.10 g/cm3. OC meteorites contain varying amounts of the silicates olivine and pyroxene, iron, and feldspar. Olivine and pyroxene were detected on Ida by Galileo. The mineral content appears to be homogeneous throughout its extent. Galileo found minimal variations on the surface, and the asteroid's spin indicates a consistent density.

The <b>surface</b> <b>color</b> is a pale buff, tawny or cinnamon towards the center, but the color loses intensity when the mushroom is dry. The flesh is whitish, thin, fragile and barely deliquescent (auto-digesting). The gills are initially buff, then turn grayish brown.

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} sample-based {{approach}} for <b>surface</b> <b>coloring,</b> which is independent of the original surface resolution and representation. To achieve this, we introduce the Orthogonal Fragment Buffer (OFB) —an extension of the Layered Depth Cube—as a high-resolution view-independent surface representation. The OFB is a data structure that stores surface samples at a nearly uniform distribution over the surface, and it is specifically designed to support efficient random read/write access to these samples. The data access operations have a complexity that is logarithmic in the depth complexity of the surface. Thus, compared to data access operations in tree data structures like octrees, data-dependent memory access patterns are greatly reduced. Due to the particular sampling strategy that is employed to generate an OFB, it also maintains sample coherence and thus exhibits very good spatial access locality. Therefore, OFB-based <b>surface</b> <b>coloring</b> performs significantly faster than sample-based approaches using tree structures. In addition, since in an OFB the surface samples are internally stored in uniform 2 D grids, OFB-based <b>surface</b> <b>coloring</b> can efficiently be realized on the GPU to enable interactive <b>coloring</b> of high-resolution <b>surfaces.</b> On the OFB we introduce novel algorithms for color painting using volumetric and surface-aligned brushes, and we present new approaches for particle-based <b>color</b> advection along <b>surfaces</b> in real-time. Due to the intermediate surface representation we choose, our method {{can be used to}} <b>color</b> polygonal <b>surfaces</b> as well as any other type of surface that can be sampled.

40|$|Existing color {{constancy}} methods cannot handle both uniform <b>colored</b> <b>surfaces</b> {{and highly}} textured surfaces {{in a single}} integrated framework. Statistics-based methods require many <b>surface</b> <b>colors,</b> and become error prone when there are only few <b>surface</b> <b>colors.</b> In contrast, dichromaticbased methods can successfully handle uniformly <b>colored</b> <b>surfaces,</b> but {{cannot be applied to}} highly textured surfaces since they require precise color segmentation. In this paper, we present a single integrated method to estimate illumination chromaticity from single/multi-colored surfaces. Unlike the existing dichromatic-based methods, the proposed method requires only rough highlight regions, without segmenting the colors inside them. We show that, by analyzing highlights, a direct correlation between illumination chromaticity and image chromaticity can be obtained. This correlation is clearly described in “inverse-intensity chromaticity space”, a new two-dimensional space we introduce. In addition, by utilizing the Hough transform and histogram analysis in this space, illumination chromaticity can be estimated robustly, even for a highly textured surface. Experimental results on real images show the effectiveness of the method. 1...|$|R

50|$|The ProPhoto RGB color space, {{also known}} as ROMM RGB (Reference Output Medium Metric), is an output {{referred}} RGB color space developed by Kodak.

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{perceptually}} identify distinct surfaces in natural scenes {{by virtue of}} their color depends not only on the relative frequency of <b>surface</b> <b>colors</b> but also on the probabilistic nature of observer judgments. Previous methods of estimating the number of discriminable <b>surface</b> <b>colors,</b> whether based on theoretical color gamuts or recorded from real scenes, have taken a deterministic approach. Thus, a three-dimensional representation of the gamut of colors is divided into elementary cells or points which are spaced at one discrimination-threshold unit intervals and which are then counted. In this study, information-theoretic methods were used to take into account both differing surface-color frequencies and observer response uncertainty. Spectral radiances were calculated from 50 hyperspectral images of natural scenes and were represented in a perceptually almost uniform color space. The average number of perceptually distinct <b>surface</b> <b>colors</b> was estimated as 7. 3 10 3, much smaller than that based on counting methods. This number is also much smaller than the number of distinct points in a scene that are, in principle, available for reliable identification under illuminant changes, suggesting that color constancy, or the lack of it, does not generally determine the limit on the use of <b>color</b> for <b>surface</b> identification...|$|R
