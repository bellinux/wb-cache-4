40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the issue of}} <b>social</b> <b>protection</b> for migrants by looking at formal and informal <b>social</b> <b>protection</b> provisions. In particular, it presents the latest global data on the <b>social</b> <b>protection</b> status on migrants, including undocumented migrants. The paper gives special attention to lower-income countries drawing upon recent studies from the Southern African Development Community (SADC). It finds that migrants in poorer countries have very limited access to formal <b>social</b> <b>protection</b> such as <b>social</b> security systems, and that the legal <b>social</b> <b>protection</b> frameworks are far from making benefits portable. Rather, migrants {{have to rely on}} informal <b>social</b> <b>protection,</b> and it is often migration itself that constitutes a form of <b>social</b> <b>protection</b> for migrants and their families.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{importance}} and essence of <b>social</b> <b>protection</b> mechanisms, describes their legal, economical and organizational components. <b>Social</b> <b>protection</b> mechanisms are important elements of the <b>social</b> <b>protection</b> system. <b>Social</b> <b>protection</b> mechanisms are understood as a complex of economical, organizational and legal measures aiming at smoothing social inequality of population. The legal foundations of the <b>social</b> <b>protection</b> mechanism consist {{in the fact that}} the protective activity supposes legislative establishment of social obligations of the state and other subjects of <b>social</b> <b>protection,</b> and their strict legislative regulation. The role of an economical component of the mechanisms can hardly be overestimated as any protective activity demands material, financial costs, economical support. In principle, the state, business and population can be the sources of <b>social</b> <b>protection</b> financing. Their role and shares depend on a lot of factors. <b>Social</b> <b>protection</b> system will not function if it is not effectively organized. The organizational component of the mechanisms is a complex of activities for carrying out <b>social</b> <b>protection</b> measures. This component includes management, personnel, organizational, informational and other support of protective measures, their direct realization. The theoretical propositions are supported with the examples of <b>social</b> <b>protection</b> practice in Kuzbass.
