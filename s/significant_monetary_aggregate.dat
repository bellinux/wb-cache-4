40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} {{monetary}} responses to global oil price changes across {{a panel of}} seven major net oil consuming countries and three major net oil producing countries using monthly data from January 1986 to August 2013. Employing a variety of linear and nonlinear causality tests, our main findings are as follows. First, oil price movements directly affect <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates</b> in both net oil consuming and net oil producing countries. Second, nonlinear causality tests reveal strong causal influences from oil prices to <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates.</b> Third, nonlinear parametric and nonparametric models reveal oil price changes account for <b>significant</b> changes in <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates</b> in Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, and the US among net oil consuming countries and in Canada and Mexico among net oil producing countries.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of monetary policy in achieving its macroeconomic objectives such as price stability {{and economic growth}} depend on the monetary policy tools that are implemented by the Central Bank. <b>Monetary</b> <b>aggregates</b> {{are one of the}} tools that have been used as indicators of economic activity and as intermediate targets to achieve these economic objectives. Until recently, <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates</b> have been questioned and criticised on their usefulness in monetary policy. This has been attributed to the economic, financial and technological developments that have distorted the relationship between <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates</b> and major macroeconomic variables. This study investigates the relevance of monetary aggregation by comparing the traditional simple sum and Divisia index <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates</b> which was constructed for the first time for South Africa using the Tornquist-Theil method. The Polynomial Distributed Lag model is employed to compare the performance of these <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates</b> using their relationship with inflation and manufacturing index. Furthermore, the aggregates are compared in terms of their controllability and information content. Overall, the study found a very strong relationship between inflation and all the <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates.</b> However, more specifically the results suggested that the Divisia indices are superior to the simple sum in terms of predicting inflation. The evidence further suggests that the Divisia aggregates provide higher information about inflation than the simple sum aggregates. Regarding the controllability of the <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates,</b> the findings suggest that the monetary authorities can hardly control the <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates</b> using <b>monetary</b> base. Finally, the relationship between manufacturing index and all the <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates</b> was very weak. ...|$|R

40|$|Money {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the economic health of a nation. The amount of money in the economy matters because it affects real variables (output, employment) and/or nominal variables (price level). Monetarist view suggests that a target growth rate for a narrow definition of money be set so that a stable (and low) rate of inflation could be achieved. This is possible if the demand for money is stable and changes in the monetary base have a predictable impact on money supply. Therefore, the performance of a <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregate</b> is examined through a money demand specification and/or as an effective monetary target in the conduct of monetary policy. ^ Empirical work in the 1970 s showed that broad <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates</b> like M 2 were closely correlated with such potential policy target variables as output, unemployment and inflation. Several countries such as Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States declared <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates</b> as intermediate targets. By mid- 1980 s however, the stability of money demand relationship was questioned and the target growth rates of <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates</b> became unpredictable. <b>Monetary</b> authorities were forced to abandon monetary targeting or monitor <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates</b> as economic policy indicators along with other variables like inflation and interest rates. The poor performance of <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates</b> and the instability of money demand functions were attributed to financial innovations, inadequate econometric methodology and restrictive conventional framework of the analysis. ^ Under such circumstances, Barnett (1980) suggested the microfoundations approach and his subsequent work has shown that weighted <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates</b> could outperform simple-sum <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates.</b> The theoretical framework of the microfoundations approach derives from monetary aggregation theory and statistical index numbers. This approach constructs new <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates</b> and compares their performance with simple-sum <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates.</b> ^ This dissertation empirically investigates the microfoundations approach for four of the G- 7 countries (Germany, Japan, United Kingdom and United States) and a developing country (Turkey), using, cointegration analysis, stability test and Granger-causality. My results indicate the superiority of microfoundations approach in all of the countries. ...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{empirical}} {{research has found}} that the strong short-term relationship between US <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates</b> and macroeconomic fundamentals, as outlined in the classical study of M.

Friedman and Kuttner (1992) information value approach we reevaluate the vanishing relationship between US <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates</b> and macroeconomic fundamentals. By using the official US data constructed by Porter and Judson (1996) we find that the currency component of M 1 corrected for the foreign holdings of dollars contains valuable information on US macroeconomic fundamentals, such as nominal and real income, as well as inflation. This correction for <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates</b> is required because the rate of foreign holdings in total money creation is large and unstable.

40|$|In this paper, I {{will examine}} the {{problems}} created by incorrectly using a simple sum <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregate</b> to measure the monetary stock.

This smoothing causes important information about the dynamic movements of the monetary stock to be lost. This may offer at least a partial explanation of why so many studies find that money has little economic relevance. To that end, we will conclude the paper by examining a reduced form backward looking IS equation to determine whether <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates</b> contain information about real GDP gap.

The theoretical framework of the study is based on a modified variable-price Mundell-Fleming model. A five-variable Vector Autoregressive (VAR) Model is estimated using quarterly data between 1983 (4) and 2005 (4). The estimated static long-run model shows that <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates,</b> exchange rate, and interest rate positively impact on remittance inflows while domestic price level negatively impact on remittance inflows. <b>Monetary</b> <b>aggregates,</b> exchange rate, interest rate and domestic price level impact on one another while remittances positively drive itself, <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates,</b> exchange rate and interest rate.

Since remittances are significantly impacted by <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates,</b> exchange rate, interest rate, and the domestic price level, prudent monetary and exchange rate policies should be specially formulated and selectively conducted to attract international remittances to Ghana.
