5|$|An {{additional}} Iraqi column {{crossed the}} Saudi border to the East, although still along the coast, towards {{the city of}} Khafji. These Iraqi tanks were screened by the 5th Mechanized Battalion of the 2nd <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabian</b> National Guard Brigade. This battalion withdrew when it came under heavy fire, {{as it had been}} ordered to not engage the Iraqi column. Elements of the 8th and 10th <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabian</b> National Guard Brigades also conducted similar screening operations. Due to the order to not engage, the road to Khafji was left open. At one point, Iraqi T-55s of another column rolled up to the Saudi border, signaling that they intended to surrender. As they were approached by <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabian</b> troops, they reversed their turrets and opened fire. This prompted air support from a nearby AC-130, destroying 13 vehicles.|$|E

5|$|During several {{independent}} {{field studies}} cracks and other ground deformations were observed {{on both the}} Egyptian and <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabian</b> sides of the gulf. During a field survey that was done there in 1996, a series of cracks were discovered between 28°35' N and 29°05' N on the <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabian</b> coast. A field investigation was also done in Egypt in 1996 by seismologist Yann Klinger and others along with the Egyptian Geological Survey and Mining Authority.

40|$|The aim was {{to assess}} the {{influence}} of culture on pain expression, pressure pain thresholds (PPTs), and pain tolerance levels (PTLs) in temporomandibular disorders (TMD) pain cases and pain-free matched controls in three cultures. Methods: This was a case-controlled study on 150 (50 <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabians,</b> 50 Italians and 50 Swedes) cases of chronic TMD pain compared with 148 age- and gender-matched pain-free controls (50 <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabians,</b> 50 Italians, and 48 Swedes). The cases and controls completed pain questionnaires and underwent clinical examinations per the Research Diagnostic Criteria for TMD (RDC/TMD) for classification status. PPT and PTL were measured on all participants with a pressure algometer (Somedic®) at a pressure increase rate of 30 kPa/s using a 1. 0 -cm diameter probe. Three body sites on the right side were investigated: the temporalis, masseter, and thenar muscles. The average of three measurements made at 1 -min intervals was calculated for PPT and PTL. A one-way ANOVA compared mean values. Results: Mean characteristic pain severity among TMD cases was 54 ±(25) for the Saudi Arabian; 56 ±(20) for the Swedish; and 62. 5 ±(21) for the Italian cases. Between-culture differences were non-significant. PPTs at the temporalis and masseter muscles in the TMD cases were highest in the <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabians</b> compared to the Swedes and Italians (P< 0. 001). No between-culture differences among the TMD cases were found in the thenar muscle. Among controls, higher PPTs in the masseter muscle were found in Swedes and <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabians</b> compared with Italians (P< 0. 001), while Swedes reported the highest PPT for the thenar compared with <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabians</b> and Italians (P< 0. 001). No between-culture differences were observed at the temporalis muscle. PTLs at the masseter muscle in the TMD cases were similar for the <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabians</b> and Swedes but significantly lower for the Italians (P< 0. 001). Thenar PTLs were significantly higher in the Swedes compared to the Italians (P< 0. 001). No significant between-culture differences among the TMD cases were found in the temporalis muscle. Among controls, similar PTLs were observed in the Swedes and <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabians</b> for the temporalis and masseter muscles, while the Italians had significantly lower PTLs than these groups at the masseter muscles (P< 0. 01) and lower than the Swedes at the temporalis (P< 0. 001). A significantly higher thenar PTL was found among Swedes compared to <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabians</b> and Italians (P< 0. 001). Cross-modality PPT based on clinical pain for TMD cases revealed significant differences between <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabians</b> and both Swedes and Italians in the temporalis and masseter muscles (P< 0. 001). No significant differences were found in the thenar muscle. Conclusions: Preliminary data suggest that Saudis and Swedes are more similar in PPT and PTL than Italians are to either group, indicating that cultural factors may influence pain perception...|$|R

5|$|The <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabian</b> {{government}} and other Gulf region governments strongly support the King of Bahrain.

5|$|Distressed by the {{occupation}} of Khafji, Saudi commander General Khaled bin Sultan appealed to American General Norman Schwarzkopf for an immediate air campaign against Iraqi forces {{in and around the}} city.
