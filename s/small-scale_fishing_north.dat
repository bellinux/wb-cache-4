40|$|The {{effort to}} {{conserve}} fisheries resources {{and improve the}} welfare of <b>small-scale</b> <b>fishing</b> households is an important objective of Poverty Reduction Strategies (PRS) in Tanzania. The success of such strategies depends both on the variation {{and the level of}} efficiency within <b>small-scale</b> <b>fishing</b> households. This paper examines the technical efficiency of <b>small-scale</b> <b>fishing</b> households in Tanzania using data from two coastal villages (Mlingotini and Nyamanzi). A stochastic frontier (with technical inefficiency effects) model is specified and estimated. The estimated mean technical efficiency of <b>small-scale</b> <b>fishing</b> households is 52 %. Results show that the efficiency of individual fishing households is positively associated with fishing experience, size of farming land, distance to the fishing ground, and potential market integration and negatively related to non-farm employment and bigger household sizes. We find that future policies aiming at targeting conservation-development issues in fishing communities should be concerted to provide mechanisms, which improve the access of <b>small-scale</b> <b>fishing</b> households to less destructive fishing tools via provision of credits, and markets as well as the creation of new employment opportunities in other sectors.

The success of such strategies depends on both the diversity {{and the level of}} efficiency within <b>small-scale</b> <b>fishing</b> households.

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version {{is available from the}} publisher via the DOI in this record. Recent calls have been made to pay greater attention to the social and cultural contexts of fisheries and their management. This paper explores how the recent Bourdieusian-inspired literature on the ‘good farmer’ might inform our discussion of fishers and their activities. Bourdieu’s ideas of habitus, field and capital(s), and how these interact in (re) shaping the positioning as a ‘good fisher’, allows us to move beyond the myopic, economic, framing of fishers seen in much previous literature and fishing policy. Through in-depth interviews and participant observations in a <b>small-scale</b> <b>fishing</b> community in <b>North</b> Wales (UK), the paper explores the particularity of the fishing field, and notes the multiple performances and demonstrations required in order for individuals to position as a ‘good fisher’. It goes on to highlight the importance of these performances in developing social capital and the associated access to networks of support and reciprocity at sea. Central to these interrelations, the paper observes, is adhering to and internalising various ‘rules of the game’ – which include managing territories, respecting fishing gear, maintaining safety at sea, and the importance of keeping secrets. The paper moves on to consider the implications of these observations for the current and future management of fishing in such areas – noting how pre-existing and context-specific relations between fishers offer boundaries to what change might be achieved by new policies – before examining future agendas for research in this field...|$|R

Generally, {{there is almost no}} dialogue between these professionals of the <b>small-scale</b> <b>fishing,</b> the scientific community, the technical experts, as well as policy-makers related with the coastal areas management. This conjuncture compromises the implementation of integrated and sustainable management plans, for which this study should contribute. The approach was performed as an interdisciplinary exercise, essentially using qualitative methods; it was based on a dialogal methodology, the interview, semi-structured, directed to a panel of privileged informers. The <b>small-scale</b> <b>fishing</b> communities studied have different frameworks and are located in several NUTS II of the Portuguese territory. The Strategic SWOT Analysis was performed to the categories which emerged from the qualitative content analysis of the interviews. The study of the categories “Artisanal fishermen” and “Associativism” allowed their characterization and the establishment of Strategic Recommendations and Strategy Supporting the Political Decision-making related with integrated and sustainable coastal development. When included in feasibility studies, the artisanal fishermen's proposals can permit the implementation and execution of management plans, more efficient and connected to the reality; in the present case, an inclusive perspective to the littoral integrated and sustainable development...|$|R

Seven case studies from <b>small-scale</b> <b>fishing</b> communities in Latin America are analyzed in order to determine if these model management institutions are supported. These case studies are then analyzed to determine what accounts for resilient informal management institutions in the face of commercial and outsider encroachment.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} spatial {{patterns in}} <b>small-scale</b> <b>fishing</b> in Africa. It {{is located in}} Lake Victoria where since the 1990 s a vibrant Nile perch fishing for overseas export developed. Focusing on a very small area in the Ugandan part of the lake, the paper uncovers a larger diversity in fishermen's responses to the dynamic environment of the Nile perch sector than a widely adopted generic model predicts. To understand this better, the paper looks at the social practices of Nile perch fishermen, uncovering the operation of different, spatially situated, fishing styles. These styles structure the social relations that the fishermen mobilise, the symbolic meanings they attach to their gear, and the values that inspire their decision-making. By thus looking at socio-cultural factors the paper hopes to contribute to an emerging spatial perspective on <b>small-scale</b> <b>fishing</b> in Africa that begins {{with an interest in}} actual social practice...|$|R

40|$|Designating <b>small-scale</b> <b>fishing</b> cooperatives as key {{actors in}} rights-based {{fisheries}} management represents a viable strategy for reconciling biological conservation with social objectives. Cooperatives are democratically-controlled enterprises designed {{to pursue the}} common interests of their members. In <b>small-scale</b> <b>fishing</b> communities, cooperatives provide a way for fishers to pool resources and engage in collective action towards social objectives including obtaining higher prices for fishers, investing in infrastructure, providing loans to members, {{and a range of}} community benefits. However, many aspects of the contemporary political and economic context of small-scale fisheries present barriers to the success of fishing cooperatives, such as competition with private sector fish buyers and middlemen and fewer opportunities for government subsidies and loans. Providing fishing cooperatives with exclusive fishing rights can bolster the success of fishing cooperatives by generating a strong incentive for members to actively participate in cooperatives instead of work independently or for individual fish buyers. I present a case study of fishing cooperatives from Yucatán, Mexico that highlights multiple social benefits arising from cooperatives’ participation in rights-based fisheries management. In Yucatán, exclusive 20 -year fishing concessions for spiny lobster have underpinned the success of large, successful, and long-lasting fishing cooperatives. These cooperatives have, in turn, promoted important social and conservation outcomes in <b>small-scale</b> <b>fishing</b> communities. They serve as livelihood opportunities and social safety nets for fishing families and enhance the broader well-being of fishing communities. Furthermore, they have played an important role as stewards of fishery conservation for multiple species and encourage fishers’ active participation in management...|$|R
