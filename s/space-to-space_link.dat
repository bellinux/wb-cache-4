40|$|Projections of {{the growth}} of earth-sensing systems for {{the latter half of the}} 1980 's show a data {{transmission}} requirement of 300 Mbps and above. Mission constraints and objectives lead to the conclusion that the most efficient technique to return the data from the sensing satellite to a ground station is through a geosynchronous data relay satellite. Of the two links that are involved (sensing satellite to relay satellite and relay satellite to ground), a laser system is most attractive for the <b>space-to-space</b> <b>link.</b> During 1975 a major step toward the development of CO 2 laser systems for space-to-space applications is being completed. This step is the completion of a 300 Mbps data relay receiver and its modification into a transceiver. The technology and state-of-the-art of such systems are described in detail in this paper...|$|E
40|$|In June 2000, NASA {{launched}} {{the first of}} three next generation Tracking and Data Relay Satellites (TDRS-H, I and J) that incorporate a 650 MHz-wide Ka-band Single Access Return (KaSAR) service using the 25. 25 – 27. 5 GHz <b>space-to-space</b> <b>link</b> (SSL) allocation. In parallel with this space segment upgrade, NASA has been upgrading the ground segment to support the 650 MHz-wide Ka-band service. As part of this upgrade effort, analyses were performed to determine the fidelity requirements of the ground terminal equipment and to estimate the implementation loss of the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) KaSAR 650 MHz service for customer data rates from 600 Mb/sec to 1. 2 Gb/sec using various modulation schemes. This paper summarizes the results of the TDRSS KaSAR 650 MHz service implementation loss analysis. Modifications to the TDRSS ground segment to support a KaSAR 650 MHz service are being performed under the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) Ka-Band Transition Product (KaTP). In support of these modifications, simulation and analytical models were developed to determine appropriate fidelity requirements for the new hardware, evaluate vendor bids and hardware noncompliances, and estimate th...|$|E
40|$|Projections of {{the growth}} of earth-sensing systems for {{the latter half of the}} 1980 's show a data-transmission {{requirement}} of 300 Mbit/s and above. The most efficient technique to return the data from a sensing satellite to a ground station is through a geosynchronous data relay satellite. A laser system is most attractive for the <b>space-to-space</b> <b>link.</b> A five-year program was conducted which has shown the basic technical feasibility of accomplishing this link with a CO 2 laser system operating at a wavelength near 10 microns. The system uses a mercury-cadmium-telluride infrared mixer cooled to approximately 100 K by a radiative cooler. The laser local oscillator and coupling-modulated laser transmitter use conductively cooled beryllium oxide construction. The optical antenna for transmission and reception has a gain of nominally 92 dB with a 3 -dB beamwidth of 80 microrad. Tracking jitter is less than ten microrad, and signal acquisition occurs in less than 1 min. The receiver subsystem has a sensitivity of 10 to the - 19 th power W/Hz, accommodates a 300 -Mbit/s data rate, and can track Doppler frequency variations over a + or - 700 -MHz range...|$|E

The CCSDS develops recommendations for space data system standards which serve as guidelines for member space agencies to use in developing their own internal standards. Over the past few years, the CCSDS has developed recommendations applicable to Advanced Orbiting Systems (AOS), such as the U. S. Space Station Freedom and related space platforms and international space station elements. The Space Link ARQ Protocol (SLAP) described here was developed as part of the AOS program...|$|R
40|$|During the {{conceptual}} design {{phases of the}} tracking and data relay satellite (TDRS) II system provision was made for a future service growth (FSG) payload with an undefined mission. The intent of the FSG {{was to provide a}} resource for TDRS II applications which would be available to meet a change in requirements for the operational TDRS II system. This paper summarizes the effect of the consideration of potential FSG applications imposed on the tracking and data relay satellite (TDRS) II system. The following applications were considered as FSG candidates: An optical 650 Mbps <b>space-to-space</b> <b>link</b> (SSL) coupled to an optical or RF downlink, an RF or optical crosslink to extend the baseline TDRS II system coverage, -zone of exclusion (ZOE) closure, relay for lunar communications either RF or optically, and relay for Martian communications either RF or optically. This paper summarizes work done in the 1990 time frame on the above stated applications. Since then, NASA has sponsored several studies (during phase B of the TDRS II development cycle) of the ZOE closure application of the FSG. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to report on the efforts previously considered for the FSG. A previous paper was presented at the 1991 Congress related to the second application above. This paper extends this effort to the four stated applications...|$|E
40|$|Support for user {{platforms}} {{through the}} use of optical links to geosynchronous relay spacecraft are expected {{to be part of the}} future space communications architecture. The European Data Relay Satellite System (EDRS) has its first node, EDRS-A, in orbit. The EDRS architecture includes <b>space-to-space</b> optical <b>links</b> with a Ka-Band feeder link or trunkline. NASA's Laser Communications Relay Demonstration (LCRD) mission, originally baselined to support a <b>space-to-space</b> optical <b>link</b> relayed with an optical trunkline, has added an Radio Frequency (RF) trunkline. The use of an RF trunkline avoids the outages suffered by an optical trunkline due to clouds, but an RF trunkline will be bandwidth limited. A space relay architecture with both RF and optical trunklines could relay critical realtime data, while also providing a high data volume capacity. This paper considers the relay user scenarios that could be supported, and the implications to the space relay system and operations. System trades such as the amount of onboard processing and storage required, the use of link layer switching vs. network layer routing, and the use of Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Attention {{is given}} to an {{end-to-end}} Space Station Data System (SSDS) architecture {{which is based on}} internationally-recommended standards developed by the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS). The proposed system uses simple modular building blocks that are recursively replicated and linked to construct essentially any desired data system configuration. The SSDS concept provides for a user-transparent data transport system which is entirely independent of the characteristics of the user data being transported, and in addition, has the flexibility to accommodate mission-induced changes in data traffic. SSDS physical elements include the following: (1) on-orbit local area networks, (2) space-to-ground, ground-to-space, and <b>space-to-space</b> data <b>links,</b> and (3) ground mission support facilities containing telemetry and telecommand data handling termini and preprocessing services...|$|R
