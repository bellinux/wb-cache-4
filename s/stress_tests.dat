5|$|Before the {{widespread}} application of technetium-99m in nuclear medicine, the radioactive isotope thallium-201, with a half-life of 73 hours, {{was the main}} substance for nuclear cardiography. The nuclide is still used for <b>stress</b> <b>tests</b> for risk stratification in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). This isotope of thallium can be generated using a transportable generator {{which is similar to}} the technetium-99m generator. The generator contains lead-201 (half-life 9.33 hours) which decays by electron capture to the thallium-201. The lead-201 can be produced in a cyclotron by the bombardment of thallium with protons or deuterons by the (p,3n) and (d,4n) reactions.|$|E
5|$|Thallium has 25 {{isotopes}} {{which have}} atomic masses {{that range from}} 184 to 210. 203Tl and 205Tl are the only stable isotopes and make up nearly all of natural thallium. 204Tl is the most stable radioisotope, with a half-life of 3.78 years. It is made by the neutron activation of stable thallium in a nuclear reactor. The most useful radioisotope, 201Tl (half-life 73 hours), decays by electron capture, emitting X-rays (~70–80keV), and photons of 135 and 167keV in 10% total abundance; therefore, it has good imaging characteristics without excessive patient radiation dose. It {{is the most popular}} isotope used for thallium nuclear cardiac <b>stress</b> <b>tests.</b>|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discuss issues {{relating}} to <b>stress</b> <b>testing</b> methods for credit risks in banks.

Findings – The paper finds that econometric modeling does not work well modeling stress scenarios. The stressed probability of default (PD) provided by Basel II would be much higher than stressed PD observed in the history. Practical implications – Bank supervisors should develop cost-effective methods to monitor the <b>stress</b> <b>test</b> results reported by banks.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Laboratory mental <b>stress</b> <b>testing</b> and 24 h {{ambulatory}} {{blood pressure}} monitoring may analyse reactivity of blood pressure during provoked stress and stressful situations in daily-life, respectively. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether {{the responses to}} a mental <b>stress</b> <b>test</b> and during the stress-test recovery time were associated with ambulatory blood pressure parameters. METHODS: Fifty-two untreated male subjects (22 normotensives and 30 hypertensives) were subjected both to mental arithmetic <b>stress</b> <b>testing</b> and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. RESULTS: We found {{a positive correlation between}} baseline and peak-test blood pressures during the <b>stress</b> <b>test</b> and 24 h blood pressures. Maximal values of systolic and diastolic blood pressures measured during the 24 h were also correlated to the maximal systolic and diastolic blood pressures reached during the <b>stress</b> <b>test</b> (P < 0. 001). We observed no relationship between reactivity during the <b>stress</b> <b>test</b> and 24 h parameters. On the contrary, changes in diastolic blood pressure during the time of recovery from the <b>stress</b> <b>test</b> (expressed as percentage-change scores) were correlated to the 24 h diastolic blood pressure parameters, the diastolic load being the most closely associated variable. CONCLUSION: The absence of relationships between variations in blood pressure during the provoked stress and ambulatory monitoring parameters indicates that reactivity of blood pressure to an acute stress does not predict the 24 h profile. However, the correlation between the maximal blood pressure measured by ambulatory monitoring and that observed during <b>stress</b> <b>testing</b> indicates that the maximal 24 h values may show the extreme blood pressure response (like the one provoked acutely by a laboratory <b>stress</b> <b>test)</b> of an individual subject. The correlation between the percentage-change score during the recovery time of diastolic blood pressure and the 24 h diastolic load could account forr a lower than normal capacity for recovery of subjects with persistently high blood pressures...|$|R
25|$|Todd Park, the U.S. chief {{technology}} officer, initially said on October 6 that the glitches {{were caused by}} unexpected high volume when the site drew 250,000 simultaneous users instead of the 50,000-60,000 expected.

White House officials subsequently conceded {{that it was not}} just an issue of volume, but involved software and systems design issues.

25|$|For most people, {{the first}} {{symptoms}} result from atheroma progression within the heart arteries, most commonly {{resulting in a}} heart attack and ensuing debility. However, the heart arteries, because (a) they are small (from about 5mm down to microscopic), (b) they are hidden deep within the chest and (c) they never stop moving, have been a difficult target organ to track, especially clinically in individuals who are still asymptomatic. Additionally, all mass-applied clinical strategies focus on both (a) minimal cost and (b) the overall safety of the procedure. Therefore, existing diagnostic strategies for detecting atheroma and tracking response to treatment have been extremely limited. The methods most commonly relied upon, patient symptoms and cardiac stress testing, do not detect any symptoms of the problem until atheromatous disease is very advanced because arteries enlarge, not constrict in response to increasing atheroma. It is plaque ruptures, producing debris and clots which obstruct blood flow downstream, sometimes also locally (as seen on angiograms), which reduce/stop blood flow. Yet these events occur suddenly and are not revealed in advance by either stress testing, <b>stress</b> <b>tests</b> or angiograms.|$|E
