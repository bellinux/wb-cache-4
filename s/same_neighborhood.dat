5|$|At {{the start}} of Part One, Ko Kitamura, son of the owner of Kitamura Sports, lives in the <b>same</b> <b>neighborhood</b> as the batting center run by the Tsukishima family. Due to their {{proximity}} {{and the relationship between}} their businesses, the Kitamura and Tsukishima families have been close for many years, and their children go {{back and forth between the}} two homes. Because Ko and Wakaba are the same age and always together, Aoba is jealous of all the time Ko spends with her older sister. Aoba is a natural pitcher with excellent form, and Ko secretly trains to become as good as she is, even while publicly showing little interest in baseball. Then Wakaba dies in a swimming accident at a summer camp during fifth grade.|$|E
5|$|In Kansas City, Kansas, two {{religious}} missionaries visit {{two women}} at two different {{homes in the}} <b>same</b> <b>neighborhood</b> who look exactly alike. The second woman yells at them to go away and the two men, inexplicably, get into a fight in the second woman's front yard. Later, two FBI agents who look and sound remarkably similar to Mulder and Scully visit the first woman, Betty Templeton (Kathy Griffin). Betty claims to have never seen the other woman before. The other woman then passes her by {{in a car and}} the two agents begin fighting each other, much like the missionaries. They are severely injured after the gruesome mauling. Both agents, who had worked together for seven years, said that they were possessed. Meanwhile, the other woman, Lulu Pfeiffer (also Kathy Griffin), applies for a job at Koko's Copies, but does not get it because she has had 17 jobs in 17 states {{in the past three years}} and moves around too much. She becomes aggravated and suddenly, all the copies become black. The other woman, Betty, goes to another job with the same name and same resume.|$|E

5|$|On August 7, 1888, {{three days}} after the Lyceum opening of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Martha Tabram was {{discovered}} stabbed to death in London's Whitechapel neighborhood. On August 31 Mary Ann Nichols was found, murdered and mutilated, in the <b>same</b> <b>neighborhood.</b> Press coverage linking these and other Whitechapel murders of women created a furor in London. The public and police suspected that {{some or all of the}} murders were committed by one person, who became known as Jack the Ripper. Some press reports compared the unidentified killer with the Jekyll and Hyde characters, suggesting that the Ripper led a respectable life during the day and became a murderer at night. On October 5, the City of London Police received a letter suggesting that Mansfield should be considered a suspect. The letter writer, who had seen him perform as Jekyll and Hyde, thought that Mansfield could easily disguise himself and commit the murders undetected.|$|E
5|$|The {{existing}} electrical grid, {{and local}} transformers in particular, {{may not have}} enough capacity to handle the additional power load that might be required in certain areas with high plug-in electric car concentrations. As recharging a single electric-drive car could consume {{three times as much}} electricity as a typical home, overloading problems may arise when several vehicles in the <b>same</b> <b>neighborhood</b> recharge at the same time, or during the normal summer peak loads. To avoid such problems, utility executives recommend owners to charge their vehicles overnight when the grid load is lower or to use smarter electric meters that help control demand. When market penetration of plug-in electric vehicles begins to reach significant levels, utilities will have to invest in improvements for local electrical grids in order to handle the additional loads related to recharging to avoid blackouts due to grid overload. Also, some experts have suggested that by implementing variable time-of-day rates, utilities can provide an incentive for plug-in owners to recharge mostly overnight, when rates are lower.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 18th century, clothes were mostly sold by {{individual}} shopkeepers who were often the artisans {{who made the}} goods.

There was another Sephardic community of about one hundred persons in the <b>same</b> <b>neighborhood,</b> who were originally from Avignon, from the oldest Jewish {{community in}} France, which had lived protected in the Papal state. They mostly worked in commerce. The third and largest community, about three hundred fifty persons, were Ashkenaze Jews from Alsace, Lorraine, Germany, the Netherlands and Poland. They spoke Yiddish, and lived largely in the neighborhood of the Church of Saint-Merri. They included three bankers, several silk merchants and jewelers, second-hand clothing dealers, and a large number of persons in the hardware business.

40|$|Abstract Background Ragpickers are {{informal}} {{workers who}} collect recyclable materials {{to earn a}} small wage. Their life and working conditions are extremely difficult. We examined minor psychiatric disorders (MPD) among a cohort of ragpickers in Pelotas, a city in southern Brazil. Methods Ragpickers were matched by sex, age, and years of schooling {{with a sample of}} non-ragpickers from the <b>same</b> poor <b>neighborhoods.</b> The cross-sectional study gathered data by interview on 990 individuals in 2004. MPD were assessed using a standard self-reporting questionnaire, the SRQ- 20. Results The prevalence of MPD among ragpickers was 44. 7 %, higher than reported by neighborhood controls (33. 6 %; p Conclusion Ragpickers more frequently report MPD than other poor workers living in the <b>same</b> <b>neighborhoods,</b> with many of the same life conditions. Improving the work lives of these precarious workers should address not only the physical hazards of their jobs but their mental and emotional health as well. </p...|$|R

50|$|In the 1980s, US {{inner city}} neighborhoods {{were subject to}} a number of forces, {{including}} white flight, redlining, planned shrinkage, and withdrawal of city services such as garbage collection.
