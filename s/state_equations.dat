40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} useful {{expression}} of summational type <b>state</b> <b>equation</b> conformable to physical and/or engineering actualities. The summational type <b>state</b> <b>equation</b> can solve {{the following two}} essential problems in mathematical expressions of the existing state equations: One {{of them is a}} physical problem of discontinuity in mathematical expressions for different orders of the existing <b>state</b> <b>equation</b> related to the number of inevitable many parasitic energy elements which always exist in an actual system. The other one is an engineering problem of disunification in mathematical expressions in which continuous-time and discrete-time systems are not described with consistency. First, this paper clarifies and explains the above problems to be solved with a simple example. Next, this paper defines the summational type <b>state</b> <b>equation</b> for the problems and analyzes, for example, basic properties, stability condition and Lyapunov inequality by using the defined <b>state</b> <b>equation.</b> Finally, the effectiveness of the summational type <b>state</b> <b>equation</b> is shown by numerical examples on the stability analysis. From these results, this paper points out that the proposed <b>state</b> <b>equation</b> can overcome difficulties of the above problems and get benefits from the sophisticated results of modern control theory...|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a new way}} of generating a generalized <b>state</b> <b>equation</b> that is useful for analyzing the token flow of the Petri Net (PN) with priority. The transition values in the firing vector as used in the conventional <b>state</b> <b>equation</b> are replaced with transition variables, which are generated by multiplying a series of firing condition functions taking the weighted inhibitor arc into account. The actual value of a transition variable is determined by taking priority and the present marking into account. The proposed <b>state</b> <b>equation</b> generalizes the conventional one by using the transition variable form and by containing the formulation of priority. Given the initial marking, the subsequent marking evolution can be determined successively from the generalized <b>state</b> <b>equation</b> as the simultaneous firings occur.
