25|$|Initial public {{offering}} (IPO) or <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> <b>launch</b> {{is a type}} of {{public offering}} in which shares of a company usually are sold to institutional investors that in turn, sell to the general public, on a securities exchange, for the first time. Through this process, a privately held company transforms into a public company. Initial public offerings are mostly used by companies to raise the expansion of capital, possibly to monetize the investments of early private investors, and to become publicly traded enterprises. A company selling shares is never required to repay the capital to its public investors. After the IPO, when shares trade freely in the open market, money passes between public investors. Although IPO offers many advantages, there are also significant disadvantages, chief among these are the costs associated with the process and the requirement to disclose certain information that could prove helpful to competitors. The IPO process is colloquially known as going public.|$|E

In the short run, a 10 percent decline in the annual real <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> return {{is associated with a}} reduction in real private consumption by around 0. 1 - 0. 3 percent on average. There is evidence that the link between <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> fluctuations and private consumption has become stronger during the 1990 s as <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> in emerging economies have broadened and deepened. However, there is no significant evidence that the influence is asymmetric. Stock price declines do not have a different impact on consumption than stock price increases.

The co-movements can affect the balancing strategies of country market portfolios as they indicate opportunities and risks. The strategic choice of alternative market presence, such as market entry via export marketing or a full ownership and marketing may need to match with the type of financial resources. The co-movements of and the linkages between the U. S. <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> and Asian <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> have been studied extensively.
