25|$|The L-162 was {{developed}} from the Bushcaddy L-160 {{as a result of}} customer demand for a freight aircraft that could also provide room for a <b>second</b> <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>seats</b> behind the pilot and passenger seats. Unlike the L-160's designation, which indicates that the design engine for that model was originally a Lycoming O-320 of , the L-162 designation is just a numerical sequence and does not indicate horsepower.|$|E
25|$|On {{the evening}} of July 16, 1999, John F. Kennedy Jr. piloted a Piper Saratoga to attend the wedding of his cousin Rory Kennedy. The plane also carried his wife, Carolyn Bessette, and sister-in-law, Lauren Bessette. Kennedy had {{purchased}} his plane three months before his death. The Bessette sisters were seated in the <b>second</b> <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>seats,</b> which faced {{the rear of the}} plane and were back-to-back with the pilot's seat.|$|E
25|$|The Thunderbird entered {{production}} for the 1955 model {{year as a}} sporty two-seat convertible. Unlike the Chevrolet Corvette, it was not marketed as a sports car. Ford positioned the Thunderbird as an upscale model and is credited in developing a new market segment, the personal luxury car. In 1958, the Thunderbird gained a <b>second</b> <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>seats.</b> Succeeding generations became larger until the line was downsized in 1977, again in 1980, and once again in 1983. Sales were good until the 1990s, when large 2-door coupes became unpopular; production ceased {{at the end of}} 1997. In 2002 production of the Thunderbird started again, a revived 2-seat model was launched, which was available {{through the end of the}} 2005 model year. From its introduction in 1955 to its phaseout in 2005, Ford produced over 4.4million Thunderbirds.|$|E
50|$|The <b>second</b> {{and third}} <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>seats</b> can be folded away {{to provide a}} flat floor, and an {{expanded}} load capacity for the boot. The rear two seats can be completely hidden away under the floor, while the <b>second</b> <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>seating,</b> slides to offer greater leg room or boot space, features a 60:40 split/fold function that is operated via electric controls in the boot.|$|R
50|$|The {{bench seat}} was the {{traditional}} seat installed in American and Australian automobiles. This seat featured a continuous pad running the full {{width of the}} cabin. The <b>second</b> <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>seating</b> in most sedans is usually a bench. The third <b>row</b> <b>of</b> most SUVs and minivans, which may be forward-facing or rear-facing, is also a bench seat.|$|R
50|$|On 9 June 1955, the CH-1 {{received}} CAA type-certificate 3H10. Originally {{certified as}} a two-place helicopter, stability problems at higher gross weights required additional engineering solutions. A larger, free-floating horizontal stabilizer was introduced. During forward flight, the stabilizer pivoted to a variable mechanical stop, which {{was linked to}} the fore and aft cyclic control, thereby altering the stabilizer angle of incidence during flight. Reworking the stabilizer permitted the addition <b>of</b> a <b>second</b> <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>seating,</b> and the four-place ship, designated the CH-1A, was certificated on 28 February 1956.|$|R
50|$|The {{influence}} of the Scenicruiser {{may be seen in}} General Motors' 1964 Buick Sport Wagon and Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser station wagons, both of which had stepped-up roofs and a raised skylight over the <b>second</b> <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>seats.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... the Eurovan MV, {{in which}} the <b>second</b> <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>seats</b> face the rear and are removable, the third row {{converts}} into a bed, a folding table in the passenger area, window curtains, and a fluorescent lamp above table.|$|E
50|$|The chassis was a tubular {{spaceframe}} {{based on}} the Dino 246, but was stretched for a 2550.20 mm wheelbase {{to make room for}} the <b>second</b> <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>seats.</b> The suspension was fully independent, with double wishbones, anti-roll bars, coaxial telescopic shock absorbers and coil springs on both axles. Niki Lauda helped set up the chassis.|$|E
5000|$|During their lifetime, seating {{arrangements}} were modified {{to suit the}} working being undertaken and included the removal of a varying number <b>of</b> <b>seats</b> for increased luggage capacity. From the mid-1970s the so-called [...] "Big Cab" [...] conversions were applied {{to a number of}} units. This involved the construction of a wall between the first and <b>second</b> <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> <b>seats</b> to create an isolated driver's cab. The back of the original driver's cab was removed and a loose seat provided. This conversion was applied to one end only and could be fitted to either the No.1 or No.2 End.|$|R
50|$|The Exiga can seat seven passengers, {{utilizing}} a gradual elevation <b>of</b> the <b>seats,</b> placing {{the first and}} <b>second</b> <b>rows</b> slightly lower than the third row. An optional, fixed position, panoramic glass roof covers the first and <b>second</b> <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> <b>seats.</b> Large rear door openings open to almost 90 degrees for {{easy access to the}} third row. The rear suspension uses double-wishbone architecture {{to make room for the}} third row and a wide luggage compartment when the <b>second</b> and third <b>row</b> seats are folded down. The <b>second</b> <b>row</b> seats can be individually slid back and forth 180 mm as needed, with a one touch folding mechanism to allow access to the third row. The cargo area offers a covered stacking approach, allowing items to be placed under the floor. Two airbags are used for front passengers, supplemented with first row side impact and additional side curtain airbags protect first and <b>second</b> <b>row</b> passengers. The seats utilize anti-whiplash, impact-absorbing technology. A collapsible brake pedal is included to reduce the chance of foot injury in a severe collision. There are no air conditioning outlets for the <b>second</b> and third <b>rows</b> but the front outlet is designed to channel the air further along the ceiling of the vehicle.|$|R
50|$|The mail {{coaches were}} {{originally}} {{designed for a}} driver, seated outside, and up to four passengers inside. The guard (the only Post Office employee on the coach) travelled on the outside at the rear next to the mail box. Later a further passenger was allowed outside, sitting at the front next to the driver, and eventually a <b>second</b> <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>seating</b> was added behind him to allow two further passengers to sit outside. Travel could be uncomfortable as the coaches travelled on poor roads and passengers were obliged to dismount from the carriage when going up steep hills to spare the horses (as Charles Dickens describes {{at the beginning of}} A Tale of Two Cities). The coaches averaged 7 to 8 mph (11 - 13 km/h) in summer and about 5 mph (8 km/h) in winter but by the time of Queen Victoria the roads had improved enough to allow speeds of up to 10 mph (16 km/h). Fresh horses were supplied every 10 to 15 miles (16 - 24 km). Stops to collect mail were short and sometimes there would be no stops at all with the guard throwing the mail off the coach and snatching the new deliveries from the postmaster.|$|R

50|$|Ford's {{tinkering}} with the exterior/interior packages did not yield a sales boost. Just 11,998 were sold in 2004. The Ford Motor Company announced in March 2005 that the Thunderbird would again be discontinued in July of that year, with 9,548 sold for 2005. Unlike previous T-birds, a <b>second</b> <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>seats</b> was not added which might have widened its appeal, though Lincoln had the LS rather than an upscale Mark based on a Thunderbird platform. The last Ford Thunderbird rolled {{off the assembly line}} on July 1, 2005.|$|E
50|$|During the UEFA Euro 2008 tournament, the Ernst Happel Stadium was {{the venue}} for the Final match. Previously, the three group matches of the Austrian National Team, two quarter finals and a {{semifinal}} match {{took place in}} the stadium. In preparation for the tournament, the first and <b>second</b> place additional <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> <b>seats</b> increased the stadium's capacity to 53,000 seats.|$|R
50|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} generation, the TownAce was sold by Daihatsu as the B20 series Daihatsu Delta Wide van/wagon between November 1982 and January 1992. At launch, the van models were retailed in 1300 and 1600 formsâ€”in-line with their engine displacements. The 1300 model had three-seater bench with 600 kg cargo payload. The 1600 increased this to 750 kg, unless a <b>second</b> <b>row</b> <b>of</b> three <b>seats</b> was fitted which reduced this to 500 kg. Passenger wagon models offered four levels of specification, the entry-level SD, followed by the SG, SE, and flagship SQ. Both gasoline and diesel engines could be specified, with automatic transmission available with the gasoline version. Updates including facelifts were as per the TownAce.|$|R
5000|$|Four-storey {{sports complex}} mainly {{features}} a maplewood hardcourt basketball court on the <b>second</b> floor with <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> <b>seats</b> rising {{up to the}} fourth level of the building.

The court {{is surrounded by a}} tiger-stripe border with a tiger's head as another design element. The basketball venue is surrounded by orange, red and yellow seats.|$|R
50|$|On July 16, 1999, Kennedy {{departed}} from Fairfield, New Jersey, {{at the controls}} of his Piper Saratoga light aircraft, carrying his wife, Carolyn, and sister-in-law Lauren Bessette, to attend the wedding of his cousin Rory Kennedy at Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts. He had purchased the plane on April 28, 1999, from Air Bound Aviation. Carolyn and Lauren {{were sitting in the}} <b>second</b> <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>seats.</b> Kennedy had checked in with the control tower at the Martha's Vineyard Airport but, when the plane failed to arrive, it was reported missing.|$|E
5000|$|The second {{generation}} Stepwgn used {{a design that}} was geared towards families with children. The Stepwgn retained its sliding doors located {{on one side of}} the vehicle. The vehicle's seating allows 4 different seating arrangements: [...] "play mode" [...] (sitting opposite each other), [...] "food mode", [...] "sleep mode" [...] and [...] "cargo mode" [...] (the <b>second</b> <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>seats</b> is folded flat). A 2.0L Honda K engine DOHC i-VTEC engine powers the {{second generation}} Stepwgn, providing , improving both driving performance and fuel economy. Some parts were stiffened in order to further enhance driving performance.|$|E
5000|$|The Avalanche was {{originally}} marketed as {{being able to}} [...] "change from a SUV to a super SUV". This {{was made possible by}} a plastic cover and an exclusive [...] "midgate" [...] which could open and close. The midgate was a divider behind the <b>second</b> <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>seats</b> that could be folded down, with the seats, to create a longer bed area, or folded up to make a larger cab area. A similar midgate was found on the Cadillac Escalade EXT, Hummer H2 SUT and the GMC Envoy XUV.|$|E
2500|$|On August 29, 2015, {{during a}} game against the New York Yankees, as Alex Rodriguez was being {{introduced}} for his first plate appearance of the series, a fan named Greg Murrey fell 40 feet (12 meters) from section 402 in the stadium's upper deck into the <b>second</b> and third <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> <b>seats</b> in section 202. He was pronounced dead on scene from his injuries. Greg Murrey was a 60-year-old man and longtime season ticket holder and [...] "incredibly passionate Braves fan", the team said.|$|R
40|$|An ancient (4 th century BC) Greek theatre of a {{very unusual}} style has been {{excavated}} near Makyneia, close to Patras, Greece. This theatre consists <b>of</b> 14 arcuate <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> <b>seats</b> and a linear wing for prominent citizens (proedria). Because of the instability of {{the foundations of the}} slabs composing the <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> <b>seats</b> the reconstruction <b>of</b> the geometry of the structure is not easy. Until now a graphic method has been used in order to define the initial plan of the theatre. In this paper a analytical method for the reconstruction of the geometry of the theatre is presented. In our study we approximated the curved <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> <b>seats</b> with circle arcs and by using LSQR we estimated five unknown parameters: the two coordinates of the circle center, the radius of the lower arc <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>seats,</b> the spacing between the two lower successive <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> <b>seats</b> and the spacing between successive upper rows. The estimated standard errors of the five parameters were between 1 mm and 3 cm, due to the high redundancy of the observations (178). It was also estimated that the arc of the circle corresponding to the lower circular <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>seats</b> and the angle between the chord <b>of</b> this <b>row</b> and the rectilinear row are approximately 90 o. Furthermore, the radius of the circle <b>of</b> the <b>second</b> (design) <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>seats</b> corresponds t...|$|R
5000|$|The first TownAce (R10 series) {{made its}} sales debut in October 1976 as a widened and {{lengthened}} {{version of the}} LiteAce (M10), still using the same doors and some other panels. In the Toyota model hierarchy, TownAce occupied the position in between the LiteAce and HiAce. At first three- or six-seater vans were offered, the more popular TR10 receiving the 1588 cc 2T-J engine (...) , although the smallest KR10 has the 1166 cc 3K-J (...) [...] Eight-seater wagons have the desmogged 12T engine rather than the 2T-J (TR11G chassis code rather than TR10V), and therefore lower power at [...] The <b>second</b> and third <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> <b>seating</b> could be laid fully flat, and the third-row seats could be folded to expand the luggage compartment. The 4K-J motor with [...] replaced the 3K-J in February 1978. That October, the wagon engine was uprated to the [...] 1770 cc 13T-U (TR15), and high-roof models with heights of 1975 and 1990 mm were introduced. Further changes in October 1978 included suspension revisions, {{the release of the}} flagship [...] "Custom Extra" [...] grade with manual sunroof. October 1979 changes adjusted the trim surrounding the headlamps, introduced a revised dashboard, and resulted in the [...] "Custom Extra" [...] being renamed [...] "Super Extra".|$|R
50|$|The Maserati Merak (Tipo AM122) is a {{mid-engined}} 2+2 {{sports car}} produced by Maserati between 1972 and 1983. The Merak was {{closely related to}} the Maserati Bora, sharing part of its structure and body panels, but was powered by a 3.0 L V6 in place of the latter's 4.7 L V8. The extra cabin space gained by fitting a smaller and compact powertrain was used to carve out a <b>second</b> <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>seats</b> - suitable for children or very small adults - making the Merak not just a less expensive alternative to the Bora but also a 2+2.|$|E
50|$|Interior {{features}} include captain-style seats, an eight-speaker sound system with an optional nine-speaker system by Bose Corp., and a TV/DVD player with a nine-inch (229mm) screen. The Elgrand is also {{equipped with an}} eight-inch (203mm) LCD monitor in the dashboard for the Carwings Vehicle Information System (also known as VIS). Optional extras include heated front seats, power curtains and finer levels of interior trim, such as woodgrain trim panels and a woodgrain steering wheel. The interior seating arrangement can be configured for dining by adjusting the front captain-style seats facing the back, and folding the <b>second</b> <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>seats</b> flat onto the seat cushions.|$|E
50|$|During a {{game against}} the Cincinnati Reds on April 3, 2014 in Cincinnati, Adams was {{attempting}} to catch a Chris Heisey pop-up that sailed into the shallow part of the seats. The infield tarp was in Adams' run path. As he leaned over the tarp to catch the ball, it was falling toward the <b>second</b> <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>seats,</b> and a fan named Chris Smith caught the ball with his own glove just above Adams' outstretch glove. Adams shifted his momentum to stand back up behind the tarp, and planted his glove on Smith's chest, pushing himself backward with a moderate shove. Smith, who had been recovering from knee surgery, gestured an obscenity with his hand toward him. During post-game interviews, Adams stated that he did not realize he had shoved Smith, but that he was preventing himself from falling into the stands.|$|E
