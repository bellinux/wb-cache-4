40|$|In the United States, <b>suspended</b> {{sediment}} {{is cited}} as the most common impairment to water quality. In addition to <b>suspended</b> sediment being a primary pollutant of concern, many other contaminants and nutrients {{can be associated with}} <b>suspended</b> sediment particles. <b>Suspended</b> sediment has significant ecological impacts stemming from changes in physical, chemical and biological characteristics of surface waters and the benthic environment. The ability to accurately quantify <b>suspended</b> sediment concentrations and fluxes at appropriate temporal and spatial scales is critical in assessing whether streams are meeting their designated beneficial uses and in implementing and evaluating watershed management and mitigation plans and restoration efforts. Currently, new methods for quantifying <b>suspended</b> sediment concentrations and fluxes are being used throughout the United States that convert high frequency, in situ measurements of surrogates such as turbidity into high frequency estimates of <b>suspended</b> sediment concentration. Regressions between turbidity and <b>suspended</b> sediment concentrations {{have been shown to be}} site specific and are affected by several factors, including the size and characteristics of <b>suspended</b> sediment particles. Additionally, most surrogate relationships have been developed from a single in situ sensor and grab samples of <b>suspended</b> sediment that may not be representative of conditions throughout the entire stream cross section. In this research we are investigating potential effects of particle size on relationships between turbidity and <b>suspended</b> sediment in efforts to determine why these relationships are site specific. We are also examining the variability in point versus width and depth integrated <b>suspended</b> sediment sampling to develop methods for accounting for these within surrogate relationships between turbidity and <b>suspended</b> sediment and improve resulting estimates of <b>suspended</b> sediment concentrations and fluxes based on these relationships...|$|R

40|$|Flow and <b>suspended</b> {{sediment}} transport in distributary channel networks {{play an important}} role in the evolution of deltas and estuaries, as well as the coastal environment. In this study, a 1 D flow and <b>suspended</b> {{sediment transport}} model is presented to simulate the hydrodynamics and <b>suspended</b> sediment transport in the distributary channel networks. The governing equations for river flow are the Saint-Venant equations and for <b>suspended</b> sediment transport are the nonequilibrium transport equations. The procedure of solving the governing equations is firstly to get the matrix form of the water level and <b>suspended</b> sediment concentration at all connected junctions by utilizing the transformation of the governing equations of the single channel. Secondly, the water level and <b>suspended</b> sediment concentration at all junctions can be obtained by solving these irregular spare matrix equations. Finally, the water level, discharge, and <b>suspended</b> sediment concentration at each river section can be calculated. The presented 1 D flow and <b>suspended</b> sediment transport model has been applied to the Pearl River networks and can reproduce water levels, discharges, and <b>suspended</b> sediment concentration with good accuracy, indicating this that model can be used to simulate the hydrodynamics and <b>suspended</b> sediment concentration in the distributary channel networks...|$|R
