40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} {{influence}} of a priori information on the roughness characteristics of agricultural fields within the context of soil moisture retrieval using SAR. Laser profile data from several European in-situ measurement campaigns is put together and typical distributions for 3 tillage types - <b>seedbed,</b> <b>harrowed</b> and ploughed - determined. In a subsequent step the information content and the retrieval uncertainties before and after a priori roughness information has been introduced into the inversion procedure is determined using a Bayesian approach...|$|R
50|$|In cooler climates {{the most}} common types are the disc harrow, the chain harrow, the tine harrow or spike harrow and the spring tine harrow. Chain harrows are often used for lighter work such as {{levelling}} the tilth or covering <b>seed,</b> while disc <b>harrows</b> are typically used for heavy work, such as following ploughing {{to break up the}} sod. In addition, there are various types of power harrow, in which the cultivators are power-driven from the tractor rather than depending on its forward motion.|$|R
50|$|Primary {{heavy duty}} disc harrows of 265 to 1000 lbs per disc are mainly used {{to break up}} virgin land, to chop material/residue, and to {{incorporate}} it into the top soil. Lighter secondary disc harrows help completely incorporate residue left by a primary disc harrow, eliminate clumps, and loosen the remaining packed soil. The notched disc blades chop up stover left from a previous crops, such as cornstalks. Disc harrows incorporate remaining residue into the top soil, promoting the rapid decay of the dead plant material. Applying fertilizer onto residue {{on the surface of}} the soil results in much of the applied nitrogen being tied up by residual plant material; therefore it is not available to germinating <b>seeds.</b> Disc <b>harrows</b> are also generally used prior to plowing in order to make the land easier to manage and work after plowing. Applying a disc harrow before plowing can also reduce clogging and allow more complete turning of the soil during plowing.|$|R
50|$|Finished {{the season}} with 20 or more points in a game 16 times, {{including}} a season-high 31 against UL Monroe which included a career-high seven 3-pointers. Harrow finished with a team-high 26 points at Colorado State. He scored another team-high 23 points on 8-of-11 shooting against Chicago State in the CBE Hall of Fame Classic. In that same tournament, Harrow recorded a double-double with 14 points and 11 assists in victory over Western Carolina. He scored 27 points, knocking down five 3-pointers in a win over Southern Miss. A huge blow to Georgia State's post-season hopes, Harrow suffered a hamstring injury in GSU's final regular season game in which they claimed the SBC regular season championship. As a result, {{he was forced to}} sit out of their SBC Tournament championship run as well as their NCAA Tournament win over the 3 <b>seed,</b> Baylor. <b>Harrow</b> returned to play 19 first-half minutes in the NCAA Tournament third-round game against No. 6 Xavier, scoring six points on a pair of 3-pointers, but had to sit out again in the second half. GSU lost that game 67-75 to end their memorable season.|$|R
40|$|Forage sorghum can {{be grown}} in areas {{presenting}} dry and hot environmental situations where the yield of other grasses can often be uneconomical. The objective {{of this study was}} to analyze the operating performance of agricultural machines in the deployment of sorghum forage in four tillage systems, as follows: no-tillage system, disk <b>harrow</b> + <b>seeding,</b> disk <b>harrow</b> + two light disking + seeding, minimum tillage + seeding and four seeding different speeds, as follows: 3, 5, 6 and 9 km h(- 1). The study was performed under field conditions in FCA/UNESP, Botucatu County, SP, Brazil. The data were subjected to variance analysis in a simple factorial 4 x 4, and a random block design with split plots. Operational performance of the agricultural machinery, physical characteristics the soil, its water content and the yield of dry matter and green sorghum were determined. The operational performance of agricultural machines in the deployment of sorghum forage is influenced by the sowing speed and the soil tillage system used. Chisel plow was the equipment that required the highest mean traction force, mean traction and slip, as well as the lowest mean speed for the studied tillage system. Forage sorghum showed higher yields in no-tillage systems at a seeding speed of 5 km h(- 1) ...|$|R
40|$|Interest {{in various}} forms of reduced tillage is {{steadily}} increasing, in line with today’s high machinery and fuel costs and increasing awareness of harmful effects of soil compaction. Reduced tillage in its various forms does, however, place higher proportions of coarse aggregates and greater quantities of plant residues. In the summer of 1995, the Väderstad Concorde underwent evaluation in field trials. The Väderstad Concorde is essentially a <b>seedbed</b> <b>harrow</b> with a <b>seed</b> hopper installed above it. The seed is fed pneumatically, with each harrow tine functioning as a seed coulter. Depth control is achieved using a wheel which follows the contour of the land, transmitting control signals to the hydraulics unit to raise or lower the machine as required. The Concorde was developed to allow farmers {{to reduce the number}} of machinery passes required. The trails encompassed spring drilling (With different numbers of harrow passes and various drilling depth), and involved studies of the bottom of the drill and the seedbed itself to investigate seed placement, the size distribution of aggregates and the moisture content of the bottom of the drill and the rest of the seedbed. During the growing season there followed monitoring of the number of plants, shoots (tillers) and ears, and of yields. The number of weeds at the various stages of growth was also investigated. Another aspect of these trials involved drilling nitrogen fertilizer amongst growing autumn wheat in the spring (drilled both along and across the direction of seed drilling). In spring drilling, an implement with Crosskill rollers was used after the Concorde. The result showed that seed placement after the Concorde in spring drilling was good, with, at lowest, 96 % of seed placed at the bottom of the drill. The number of plants per square metre after the Concorde was higher where no prior harrowing had taken place. This indicates that harrowing prior to drilling does not improve the result, provided that the field has been harrowed in the autumn or levelled. In the trail crops which had not been harrowed prior to drilling, pressure on the crop from weeds was lower than in the crops which had been harrowed twice before drilling. The harvest result also indicated that a reduced number of harrow passes before drilling with Concorde produced increased yields. Drilling nitrogen fertiliser in autumn wheat produced increased yields when compared with topdressing, in spite of the fact that a great deal of precipitation fell on the following night. It is difficult to determine whether the increased yield was a result of the tillage effect or the placement of the fertiliser. Even greater effects are probably to be expected if rain does not fall on the crop immediately after the fertiliser is drilled in this way...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWhen the {{spreading}} {{of a disease}} depends on the proportion of infected residues remaining at soil surface it is of crucial importance to analyse the effects of tillage practices on the vertical distribution of stubble. This {{is the case with}} phoma stem canker (blackleg), whose epidemics are initiated in autumn, by air-borne ascospores released from stubble located at the soil surface. We compared initial vertical distribution of oilseed rape residues to those observed after sowing and various tillage operations (rotary harrowing, stubble disking, chiselling and mouldboard ploughing). Almost 20 % of the initially buried residue was brought back to soil surface with <b>seeding.</b> Rotary <b>harrow</b> brought 40 % of the residue buried in the 0 - 10 cm layer up to the surface and left unburied about 70 % of surface residue. Stubble disking appeared to be more efficient for residue burial than chiselling. Mouldboard plough was the only tool that buried all residues. A simple model was developed that predicted burial and return to the soil surface of potentially infected residues as a function of tillage practices used after harvest. Simulation of different tillage sequences showed that the order in which tools were used also affected location of residues. Our results highlighted the importance of tillage in the cultural control of phoma stem canker and will contribute to the definition of integrated pest management strategies for oilseed rape...|$|R
5000|$|In agriculture, a harrow (often {{called a}} set of harrows in a plurale tantum sense) is an {{implement}} for breaking up and smoothing out {{the surface of the}} soil. In this way it is distinct in its effect from the plough, which is used for deeper tillage. Harrowing is often carried out on fields to follow the rough finish left by plowing operations. The purpose of this harrowing is generally to break up clods (lumps of soil) and to provide a finer finish, a good tilth or soil structure that is suitable for seedbed use. Coarser harrowing may also be used to remove weeds and to cover <b>seed</b> after sowing. <b>Harrows</b> differ from cultivators in that they disturb the whole surface of the soil, such as to prepare a seedbed, instead of disturbing only narrow trails that skirt crop rows (to kill weeds).|$|R
40|$|A {{tractor-trailer}} combination or {{a tractor}} with a towed implement {{is a common}} form for agricultural machines, such as <b>seed</b> drillers, <b>harrows,</b> fertilizers or sprayers. When optimizing field traffic, it is most significant to minimize the {{time spent in the}} headlands. Therefore the behavior of tractor-trailer combination in a headland is studied in this paper. The tractor-trailer combination is modelled as a differential equation system or dynamic model with six states and two inputs. The movement is restricted into 2 D-plane. The supplementary requirements for the model are the ability to reverse driving, allowing the switch-back turning and the standard formulation of optimal control problem. The dynamic model is parametrized in terms of mechanical parameters of the vehicle. Optimal control theory and tools are reviewed. The minimum-time optimal control problem of headland turning with tractor-trailer vehicle is presented. Vehicle's mechanical and field's geometrical constraints are considered. The optimal control problem is highly nonlinear so it cannot be solved analytically. Numerical algorithms for solving this kind of optimal control problems demand high computational cost and cannot be solved in real-time even with modern desktop computers. The optimal control problem is solved with fixed vehicle parameters and varying headland parameters, headland angle and width. In order to use optimal control problem solutions in real-time applications, the solutions in variable headland cases are approximated with simple trajectories. The rules for selecting a turning method with fixed vehicle parameters and certain headland parameters are presented...|$|R
5000|$|Mr Ritchie has a {{business}} (J&H Ritchie Ltd) on North Arkleston Farm, Paisley. He bought an {{all in one}} <b>seed</b> drill and <b>harrow</b> from Lloyd Ltd, based at Hunters Hall, Kelso. It was advertised at a reduced price {{because it had been}} repossessed from the previous owner. It did not work. Lloyd Ltd agreed to take it back, investigate, and repair it. Lloyd Ltd returned it, but refused to say what the problem had been, and just said it had been repaired to [...] "factory gate" [...] standard. Mr Ritchie found out informally that two bearings for the rotors of the harrow had been missing. This was a serious defect. Mr Ritchie was concerned that when he had used it, further damage may have been caused, and he would not find out, because he would only start using it the next Spring. He was worried that by this time the manufacturer's guarantee would be affected. So Mr Ritchie rejected the machine.|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} over eight consecutive years at three sites, on clay or clay loam soils. In a split-plot design, two main treatments (mouldboard ploughing to 25 cm depth and disc or springtine cultivation to 13 cm depth) were combined with two seedbed preparation treatments (three passes with a conventional harrow vs. one pass with a power take off (PTO) driven <b>harrow).</b> <b>Seedbed</b> characteristics and bulk soil properties investigated {{at one of the}} sites in 1991 were similar in the different treatments in the 0 - 13 cm layer. In the 13 - 25 cm layer shallow cultivation resulted in significantly higher bulk density, degree of compactness and penetration resistance, and lower root density than in mouldboard ploughing. A reduced number of tractor passes achieved by using the PTO driven harrow resulted in significantly lower bulk density and penetration resistance in the unploughed soil, while still providing an adequate seedbed. At 25 - 30 cm depth, the volume of pores with equivalent diameter > 100 um, saturated hydraulic conductivity and air permeability were higher with ploughless tillage than with conventional tillage. Pore continuity was greater in unploughed soil at all depths investigated. In unploughed plots there was a concentration of organic carbon and potassium in the upper 13 cm. Phosphorus distribution and pH were not altered by the tillage systems. The yield was improved by the PTO driven harrow both in ploughed and unploughed plots...|$|R
40|$|Surface {{roughness}} crucially {{affects the}} hydrological and erosive behaviours of soils. In agricultural areas surface roughness {{is directly related}} to tillage, whose action strongly affects the key physical properties of soils and determines the occurrence and fate of several processes (e. g., surface storage, infiltration, etc.). The characterisation of surface roughness as a result of tillage operations is not straightforward, and numerous parameters and indices have been proposed for quantifying it. In this article, a database of 164 profiles (each 5 m long), measured in 5 different roughness classes, was analysed. Four roughness classes corresponded to typical tillage operations (i. e., mouldboard, <b>harrow,</b> <b>seedbed,</b> etc.), and the fifth represented a seedbed soil that was subject to rainfall. The aim of the research was to evaluate and select the surface roughness parameters that best characterised and quantified the surface roughness caused by typical tillage operations. In total, 21 roughness parameters (divided into 4 categories) were assessed. The parameters that best separated and characterised the different roughness classes were the limiting elevation difference (LD) and the Mean Upslope Depression index (MUD); however, the parameters most sensitive to rainfall action on seedbed soils were limiting slope (LS) and the crossover lengths measured with the semivariogram method (lSMV) and the root mean square method (lRMS). Many parameters had high degrees of correlation with each other, and therefore gave almost identical information. The results of this study may contribute {{to the understanding of the}} surface roughness phenomenon and its parameterisation in agricultural soils.

40|$|Aims The {{relationship}} between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning {{is among the}} most active areas of ecological research. Furthermore, enhancing the diversity of degraded ecosystems is a major goal in applied restoration ecology. In grasslands, many species may be locally absent due to dispersal or microsite limitation and may therefore profit from mechanical disturbance of the resident vegetation. We established a seed addition and disturbance experiment across several grassland sites of different land use to test whether plant diversity can be increased in these grasslands. Additionally, the experiment will allow us testing the consequences of increased plant diversity for ecosystem processes and for the diversity of other taxa in real-world ecosystems. Here we present details of the experimental design and report results from the first vegetation survey one year after disturbance and seed addition. Moreover, we tested whether the effects of seed addition and disturbance varied among grassland depending on their land use or pre-disturbance plant diversity. Methods A full-factorial experiment was installed in 73 grasslands in three regions across Germany. Grasslands were under regular agricultural use, but varied in the type and the intensity of management, thereby representing the range of management typical for large parts of Central Europe. The disturbance treatment consisted of disturbing the top 10 cm of the sward using a rotavator or rotary <b>harrow.</b> <b>Seed</b> addition consisted of sowing a high-diversity seed mixture of regional plant species. These species were all regionally present, but often locally absent, depending on the resident vegetation composition and richness of each grassland. Important findings One year after sward disturbance it had significantly increased cover of bare soil, seedling species richness and numbers of seedlings. Seed addition had increased plant species richness, but only in combination with sward disturbance. The increase in species richness, when both seed addition and disturbance was applied, was higher at high land-use intensity and low resident diversity. Thus, we show that at least the early recruitment of many species is possible also at high land-use intensity, indicating the potential to restore and enhance biodiversity of species-poor agricultural grasslands. Our newly established experiment provides a unique platform for broad-scale research on the land-use dependence of future trajectories of vegetation diversity and composition and their effects on ecosystem functioning...|$|R
