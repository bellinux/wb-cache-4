50|$|Expedition 9's fourth {{scheduled}} EVA {{prepared the}} Station for future assembly operations {{and the arrival}} of the ATV. The spacewalkers replaced the Zarya Control Module flow control panel and installed four <b>safety</b> <b>tether</b> fairleads on Zarya's handrails.|$|E
5000|$|Fossum had {{a problem}} with his 85 ft long <b>safety</b> <b>tether,</b> which was damaged after he made a mistake; not {{realising}} he had left the tether in a locked position, he expected it to be automatically drawn tight. Upon realising the mistake Fossum said: [...] "Oh no! ... That's embarrassing". The damaged tether had to be switched for a spare.|$|E
5000|$|It {{was later}} {{revealed}} that a potentially dangerous incident occurred during the EVA. Once Grechko {{was back in the}} airlock, Romanenko asked to look outside, so Grechko moved aside and Romanenko pushed hard against the airlock. He did not have his <b>safety</b> <b>tether</b> attached and began to float away from the station and thrash about. Grechko grabbed his commander by his untethered safety line and pulled him back in. (In an interview afterward, he reported he asked Romanenko, [...] "Yuri, where are you going?") Grechko felt the incident was overblown by author James Oberg to sound more dangerous than it really was. Although Romanenko's <b>safety</b> <b>tether</b> was not attached, there was still the electricity/communications umbilical that would have held him to the station. Another complication occurred when the gauges indicated no air was refilling the airlock. However, it was soon realized the gauges had to be faulty, and they safely reentered the station.|$|E
5000|$|The crew then {{attempted}} {{to perform the}} hard dock to Skylab, but the capture latches failed to operate. After eight failed attempts, they donned their pressure suits again and partially dis-assembled the CSM's docking probe; the next attempt worked. Once inside the station, the crew deployed a collapsible parasol through the small scientific airlock {{to act as a}} sunshade. (This approach was suggested and designed by NASA's [...] "Mr. Fix It" [...] Jack Kinzler, who was awarded the NASA Distinguished Service Medal for the effort.) Successful deployment of the sunshade dropped inside temperatures to sustainable levels.Two weeks later, Conrad and Kerwin performed a second EVA, finally freeing the stuck solar panel and increasing the electrical power to the workshop. They had prepared for this repair by practicing in the Neutral Buoyancy Simulator at the Marshall Space Flight Center. Without power from the panel, the second and third Skylab missions would have been unable to perform their main experiments, and the station's critical battery system would have been seriously degraded. During this EVA, the sudden deployment of the solar panel structure caused both astronauts to be flung from the Skylab hull, testing their nerves as well as the strength of their <b>safety</b> <b>tethers.</b> After recovering their composure, both astronauts returned to their positions on Skylab and completed the EVA.|$|R
5000|$|Story Musgrave and Jeffrey A. Hoffman {{started the}} first EVA {{about an hour}} earlier than {{scheduled}} by stepping into the cargo bay at 10:46 pm EST. They began by unpacking tools, <b>safety</b> <b>tethers</b> and work platforms. Hoffman then installed a foot restraint platform onto {{the end of the}} shuttle's remote manipulator arm, which he then snapped into his feet. Nicollier drove the arm from within the shuttle and moved Hoffman around the telescope. Meanwhile, Musgrave installed protective covers on Hubble's aft low gain antenna and on exposed voltage bearing connector covers. The astronauts then opened the HST equipment bay doors and installed another foot restraint inside the telescope. Musgrave assisted Hoffman into the restraint and Hoffman proceeded to replace two sets of Rate Sensing Units. These units contain gyroscopes that help keep Hubble pointed in the right direction. By 12:24 EST Hoffman had finished replacing RSU-2 (containing Gyros 2-3 and 2-4) and then replaced RSU-3 (containing Gyros 3-5 and 3-6). The astronauts then spent about 50 minutes preparing equipment for use during the second space walk and then replaced a pair of electrical control units (ECU3 and ECU1) that control RSUs 3 and 1. [...] The astronauts also changed eight fuse plugs that protect the telescope's electrical circuits. Hubble now had a full set of six healthy gyroscopes.|$|R
50|$|Named after both Jonathan Palmer and Patrick Head, the Williams JPH1 chassis and {{survival}} cell is of carbon fibre composite monocoque construction. The car {{was designed to}} comply with 2005 FIA F1 Safety Regulations. Head protection conforms to the latest 2009 F1 standards. Amongst many other detailed <b>safety</b> features, roadwheel <b>tethers</b> are incorporated.|$|R
50|$|The 21KS {{system is}} a {{completely}} new design for Orlan-DMA spacesuit not using a <b>safety</b> <b>tether,</b> but air jet engines. This system was similar to MMU. It was automatically stabilized, used 6 degrees of freedom, weighed less than 180 kg, had a delta-v of 30 m/s, practical speed of 1 m/s, and an emergency mode that allows for rotational acceleration of 8°/s per second.|$|E
5000|$|On 17 February 1961, {{the pack}} veered sharply, {{reaching}} {{the end of}} the <b>safety</b> <b>tether,</b> which then broke, causing Moore to fall approximately 2.5 meters, breaking his kneecap. He could no longer fly. Engineer Harold Graham took over as test pilot and testing resumed on 1 March. He then carried out 36 more tethered tests which enabled them to achieve stable control of the pack.|$|E
5000|$|The MBS also {{supports}} astronauts during extra-vehicular activities. It has locations to store tools and equipment, foot-restraints, handrails and <b>safety</b> <b>tether</b> attachment points {{as well as}} a camera assembly. If needed, it is even possible for an astronaut to [...] "ride" [...] the MBS while it moves at a top speed of about 1.5 meters per minute. On either side of the MBS are the Crew and Equipment Translation Aids. These carts ride on the same rails as the MBS. Astronauts ride them manually during EVAs to transport equipment and to facilitate their movements around the station.|$|E

50|$|In 1997, the European Space Agency {{launched}} the Young Engineers' Satellite (YES) of about 200 kg into GTO with a 35 km double-strand tether, {{and planned to}} deorbit a probe at near-interplanetary speed by swinging deployment of the tether system. The orbit achieved was not as initially planned for the tether experiment and, for <b>safety</b> considerations, the <b>tether</b> was not deployed.|$|R
50|$|In the novel, {{the orders}} to {{disconnect}} HAL come from Dave and Frank's superiors on Earth. After Frank is killed {{while attempting to}} repair the communications antenna he is pulled away into deep space using the <b>safety</b> <b>tether</b> which is still attached to both the pod and Frank Poole's spacesuit. Dave begins to revive his hibernating crew mates, but is foiled when HAL vents the ship's atmosphere into the vacuum of space, killing the awakening crew members and almost killing Bowman, who is only narrowly saved when he finds his way to an emergency chamber {{which has its own}} oxygen supply and a spare space suit inside.|$|E
5000|$|The former Soviet Union {{also used}} a {{cosmonaut}} propulsion system on flights {{to the space}} station Mir. The SPK (or UMK, UPMK) was larger than the Space Shuttle MMU, contained oxygen instead of nitrogen and was attached to a <b>safety</b> <b>tether.</b> Despite the tether, the SPK allowed the cosmonaut, wearing the self-contained Orlan spacesuit, to [...] "fly around" [...] the orbiting complex, allowing access to areas nearly impossible to access otherwise. Though tested on Mir in 1990, the cosmonauts preferred using the Strela crane (equivalent to the Mobile Servicing System). The SPK, which was left attached to the outside to the Kvant-2 module, was destroyed when Mir re-entered the atmosphere after decommissioning.|$|E
50|$|A {{rocket motor}} with a thrust of 280 pounds-force (1.25 kN or 127 kgf) was chosen. The pack with its fuel weighed 125 lb (57 kg). The pack had a {{fiberglass}} frame contoured {{to fit the}} operator's body, secured with straps, and cylinders of fuel and nitrogen were attached to the frame. The motor was fastened using a hinged assembly that was controlled by levers under the shoulders while thrust was controlled through a regulator assembly connected to a throttle handle on the right lever of the device. The handle on the left lever governed the slant of the (jetavators) nozzles. Tests of the pack began {{toward the end of}} 1960 and were performed in a large hangar with a <b>safety</b> <b>tether.</b> Wendell Moore completed the first 20 tethered takeoffs while making incremental improvements.|$|E
40|$|Tile {{inspection}} and repair activities have implicit hazards associated with them. When an Extra Vehicular Activities (EVA) crewmember and associated hardware are added into the equation, additional hazards are introduced. Potential hazards to the Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU), the Orbiter or the crew member themselves are created. In order to accurately {{assess the risk}} of performing a TPS inspection or repair, an accurate evaluation of potential hazards and how adequately these hazards are controlled is essential. The EMU could become damaged due to sharp edges, protrusions, thermal extremes, molten metal or impact with the Orbiter. Tools, tethers {{and the presence of}} a crew member {{in the vicinity of the}} Orbiter Thermal Protection System (TPS) pose hazards to the Orbiter. Hazards such as additional tile or Reinforced Carbon-Carbon (RCC) damage from a loose tool, <b>safety</b> <b>tethers,</b> crewmember or arm impact are introduced. Additionally, there are hazards to the crew which should be addressed. Crew hazards include laser injury, electrical shock, inability to return to the airlock for EMU failures or Orbiter rapid safing scenarios, as well as the potential inadvertent release of a crew member from the arm/boom. The aforementioned hazards are controlled in various ways. Generally, these controls are addressed operationally versus by design, as the majority of the interfaces are to the Orbiter and the Orbiter design did not originally account for tile repair. The Shuttle Remote Manipulator System (SRMS), for instance, was originally designed to deploy experiments, and therefore has insufficient design controls for retention of th...|$|R
50|$|SAFER is {{designed}} {{to be used as a}} self-rescue device if in spite of precautions such as <b>tethers,</b> <b>safety</b> grips, and the robot arm an EVA crewmember gets separated and no vehicles can provide rescue capability. SAFER is worn by every ISS crewmember using an Extravehicular Mobility Unit. SAFER was co invented by former astronaut Joseph Kerwin, Paul Cottingham and Ted Christian under a Lockheed contract to NASA for Space Station Freedom. It was later sponsored by the Space Shuttle Program and developed by Lockheed and NASA personnel. Ralph Anderson was the Shuttle Program Office's Project Manager for the SAFER Development Test Objective (DTO). Cliff Hess was the NASA Project Engineer. The device was developed by the Robotics Division (with its Lockheed staff) of NASA at the Johnson Space Center. The SAFER was the design solution to the Shuttle Program's requirement to provide a means of self rescue should an EVA crewmember become untethered during an EVA.|$|R
40|$|Teamed Robots for Exploration and Science in Steep Areas (TRESSA) is {{a system}} of three {{autonomous}} mobile robots that cooperate {{with each other to}} enable scientific exploration of steep terrain (slope angles up to 90). Originally intended for use in exploring steep slopes on Mars that are not accessible to lone wheeled robots (Mars Exploration Rovers), TRESSA and systems like TRESSA could also be used on Earth for performing rescues on steep slopes and for exploring steep slopes that are too remote or too dangerous to be explored by humans. TRESSA is modeled on safe human climbing of steep slopes, two key features of which are teamwork and <b>safety</b> <b>tethers.</b> Two of the autonomous robots, denoted Anchorbots, remain {{at the top of a}} slope; the third robot, denoted the Cliffbot, traverses the slope. The Cliffbot drives over the cliff edge supported by tethers, which are payed out from the Anchorbots (see figure). The Anchorbots autonomously control the tension in the tethers to counter the gravitational force on the Cliffbot. The tethers are payed out and reeled in as needed, keeping the body of the Cliffbot oriented approximately parallel to the local terrain surface and preventing wheel slip by controlling the speed of descent or ascent, thereby enabling the Cliffbot to drive freely up, down, or across the slope. Due to the interactive nature of the three-robot system, the robots must be very tightly coupled. To provide for this tight coupling, the TRESSA software architecture is built on a combination of (1) the multi-robot layered behavior-coordination architecture reported in "An Architecture for Controlling Multiple Robots" (NPO- 30345), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 28, No. 10 (October 2004), page 65, and (2) the real-time control architecture reported in "Robot Electronics Architecture" (NPO- 41784), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 32, No. 1 (January 2008), page 28. The combination architecture makes it possible to keep the three robots synchronized and coordinated, to use data from all three robots for decision- making at each step, and to control the physical connections among the robots. In addition, TRESSA (as in prior systems that have utilized this architecture), incorporates a capability for deterministic response to unanticipated situations from yet another architecture reported in Control Architecture for Robotic Agent Command and Sensing (NPO- 43635), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 32, No. 10 (October 2008), page 40. Tether tension control is a major consideration in the design and operation of TRESSA. Tension is measured by force sensors connected to each tether at the Cliffbot. The direction of the tension (both azimuth and elevation) is also measured. The tension controller combines a controller to counter gravitational force and an optional velocity controller that anticipates the motion of the Cliffbot. The gravity controller estimates the slope angle from the inclination of the tethers. This angle and the weight of the Cliffbot determine the total tension needed to counteract the weight of the Cliffbot. The total needed tension is broken into components for each Anchorbot. The difference between this needed tension and the tension measured at the Cliffbot constitutes an error signal that is provided to the gravity controller. The velocity controller computes the tether speed needed to produce the desired motion of the Cliffbot. Another major consideration in the design and operation of TRESSA is detection of faults. Each robot in the TRESSA system monitors its own performance and the performance of its teammates in order to detect any system faults and prevent unsafe conditions. At startup, communication links are tested and if any robot is not communicating, the system refuses to execute any motion commands. Prior to motion, the Anchorbots attempt to set tensions in the tethers at optimal levels for counteracting the weight of the Cliffbot; if either Anchorbot fails to reach its optimal tension level within a specified time, it sends message to the other robots and the commanded motion is not executed. If any mechanical error (e. g., stalling of a motor) is detected, the affected robot sends a message triggering stoppage of the current motion. Lastly, messages are passed among the robots at each time step (10 Hz) to share sensor information during operations. If messages from any robot cease for more than an allowable time interval, the other robots detect the communication loss and initiate stoppage...|$|R

The experimental rig, which worked on compressed nitrogen, was prepared. Its steel tubing frame allowed a tester to {{be attached to the}} rig. Two hinged nozzles were set on the frame. Nitrogen at 35 atmospheres (3.5 MPa) was supplied to the nozzles by flexible hoses. An engineer-operator on the ground regulated the supply of nitrogen through a valve. Additionally, the tester regulated the thrust using levers under his shoulders. The tester inclined the nozzles forward and backward, trying to reach stable hovering at a limited height. A <b>safety</b> <b>tether</b> was attached from below, so that the rig and tester could not fly too high.|$|E
5000|$|On 19 April 1954, a Convair {{engineering}} test pilot and Marine reservist, Lieutenant Colonel James F. [...] "Skeets" [...] Coleman, {{made the first}} tethered flight in the Pogo. The XFY-1 was like no other propeller driven aircraft before it. No previous aircraft with a similar weight, engine power, or size had ever attempted to take off and land vertically. For the safety of both the craft and its pilot, the propeller hub cover was removed and replaced by <b>safety</b> <b>tether</b> lines for the first flight, in case Coleman would lose control of the craft and {{would need to be}} tethered to prevent the craft falling to the ground. On {{the other end of the}} tether was another engineer, Bob McGreary. If Coleman ever lost control, McGreary controlled the winch which could be turned to raise the tethers to prevent the craft from plummeting to the ground. For further safety precautions, four security cables were fastened to each wing in case control was lost in any axis. The tests were conducted inside of a naval airship hangar at Moffett Field in Mountain View, California.|$|E

2500|$|... 12 October 2007: Nine South African National Defence Force (SANDF) {{soldiers}} were killed and 14 injured by the system during a training exercise at the SANDF Battle School at Lohatla in the Northern Cape province. A line of eight cannons were engaging a tank hulk in manual ground fire with the guns at low elevation and the maximum traverse of the barrels secured by <b>safety</b> poles and <b>tethers.</b> The rightmost gun jammed while firing {{and had to be}} repaired by technicians. Shortly after the gun was cleared to fire again, the gun malfunctioned, entered automatic mode, broke through the traversal-restriction safety mechanisms and began firing, striking the other guns along the firing line. [...] Initial reports suggested that the malfunction was caused when the gun underwent an unexplained hang fire of the explosive 35mm ammunition in the magazines, causing the turret to swing uncontrolled through 360 degrees, firing wildly until it exhausted its remaining ammunition. A statement issued by the South African Defense Minister, Mosiuoa Lekota, however, stated that the gun had inexplicably traversed 90 degrees to the left, breaking through the safety mechanisms, and fired only a -second-long burst, striking all of the soldiers located on the right-hand side of their guns. The accident report published by the SANDF in January 2008 blamed [...] "undetected mechanical failure—which the manufacturers of an anti-aircraft gun allegedly kept secret". The report says the gun malfunctioned because a spring pin, which {{is the size of a}} matchstick, sheared. [...] Other sources blamed poor training and safety procedures in the SANDF.|$|R

This value of speed is the upper limit for the Kenaf to keep on steep stairs. We then observed its behavior and judged whether or not falling backward occurred. At the tip of the robot, a <b>safety</b> <b>tether</b> was attached to prevent the robot from falling and crashing. The pitch between the edges of the stairs, p,  was changed to four different values— 150, 180, 200 and 220  mm—and the inclination of the stairs θ _s was changed discretely. At each pitch between the edges of the stairs, we evaluated the marginal inclination θ _s^sup above which falling backward occurred. We performed five trials under the same conditions.|$|E

40|$|The International Space Station (ISS) is {{now under}} {{construction}} in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). The process of building the ISS requires that astronauts carry out many Extravehicular Activities. To protect the astronauts form the hazardous space environment, {{they are required to}} wear a suit known as the Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU). For most Extra-Vehicular Activities (EVAs) the EMU is tethered to ISS via a steel <b>safety</b> <b>tether.</b> During the course of an EVA it is common for the <b>safety</b> <b>tether</b> to contact exposed metal on both the ISS and the EMU. In this case, the single point ground of the EMU would be at the same potential as the ISS with respect to the LEO Plasma. In the event that the metal structure of the ISS begins to charge negative of the plasma potential as a result of electron collection by the ISS photovoltaic arrays, then the EMU would also be driven to a negative potential. Anodized aluminum components on the EMU would then begin to develop a charge across their amortization layer as ions from the plasma are collected. In the case where large negative potentials are applied to the EMU, dielectric breakdown may occur as a large voltage difference is developed across the thin amortization layer (oxide). The resulting arc plasma may in turn couple to the charge accumulated on the nearby ISS anodized debris shields and thereby generate a large current flow through the metal EMU structure. Current flow through the EMU could result in an electrocution hazard for the Crew Member inside the EMU - and therefore represents an important safety concern. To address this concern, a series of experiments have been undertaken. In each experiment specially prepared anodized aluminum samples were placed in a LEO representative plasma and charged until dielectric breakdown occurred {{in the form of an}} arc. This process was repeated a number of times for three sets of samples. During each test the arc voltage and current were monitored. A statistical treatment of the arc voltage threshold will be presented. In addition, safe operating voltages for the EMU are suggested...|$|E
40|$|The {{use of an}} Intra-Vehicular Activity (IVA) {{suit for}} a spacewalk or Extra-Vehicular Activity (EVA) was {{evaluated}} for mobility and usability in the Neutral Buoyancy Lab (NBL) environment. The Space Shuttle Advanced Crew Escape Suit (ACES) has been modified (MACES) to integrate with the Orion spacecraft. The first several missions of the Orion MPCV spacecraft will not have mass available to carry an EVA specific suit so any EVA required {{will have to be}} performed by the MACES. Since the MACES was not designed with EVA in mind, it was unknown what mobility the suit would be able to provide for an EVA or if a person could perform useful tasks for an extended time inside the pressurized suit. The suit was evaluated in multiple NBL runs by a variety of subjects including crewmembers with significant EVA experience. Various functional mobility tasks performed included: translation, body positioning, carrying tools, body stabilization, equipment handling, and use of tools. Hardware configurations included with and without TMG, suit with IVA gloves and suit with EVA gloves. Most tasks were completed on ISS mockups with existing EVA tools. Some limited tasks were completed with prototype tools on a simulated rocky surface. Major findings include: demonstration of the ability to weigh-out the suit, understanding the need to have subjects perform multiple runs prior to getting feedback, determination of critical sizing factors, and need for adjustment of suit work envelop. The early testing has demonstrated the feasibility of EVA's limited duration and limited scope. Further testing is required with more flight like tasking and constraints to validate these early results. If the suit is used for EVA, it will require mission specific modifications for umbilical management or PLSS integration, <b>safety</b> <b>tether</b> attachment, and tool interfaces. These evaluations are continuing through calendar year 2014...|$|E
40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the space shuttle Columbia accident, it quickly became clear that new methods would need to be developed that would provide the capability to inspect and repair the shuttle's thermal protection system (TPS). A boom extension to the Remote Manipulator System (RMS) with a laser topography sensor package was identified as the primary means for measuring the damage depth in acreage tile as well as scanning Reinforced Carbon- Carbon (RCC) surfaces. However, concern over the system's fault tolerance made it prudent to investigate alternate means of acquiring close range photographs and contour depth measurements {{in the event of a}} failure. One method that was identified early was to use the Simplified Aid For EVA Rescue (SAFER) propulsion system to allow EVA access to damaged areas of concern. Several issues were identified as potential hazards to SAFER use for this operation. First, the ability of an astronaut to maintain controlled flight depends upon efficient technique and hardware reliability. If either of these is insufficient during flight operations, a <b>safety</b> <b>tether</b> must be used to rescue the crewmember. This operation can jeopardize the integrity of the Extra-vehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) or delicate TPS materials. Controls were developed to prevent the likelihood of requiring a tether rescue, and procedures were written to maximize the chances for success if it cannot be avoided. Crewmember ability to manage tether cable tension during nominal flight also had to be evaluated to ensure it would not negatively affect propellant consumption. Second, although propellant consumption, flight control, orbital dynamics, and flight complexity can all be accurately evaluated in Virtual Reality (VR) Laboratory at Johnson Space Center, there are some shortcomings. As a crewmember's hand is extended to simulate measurement of tile damage, it will pass through the vehicle without resistance. In reality, this force will push the crewmember away from the vehicle, and could induce a moment which, if strong enough, could saturate the attitude control system in SAFER. This raises the concern that additional propellant will be consumed to maintain controlled flight. To account for this, the fidelity of the Virtual Reality simulation was improved to include the effect of crewmember contact with the vehicle during SAFER flight. In addition, while participating in VR simulations, the subject is in shirt sleeves and sits in a chair. This does not provide a flight-like representation of body position awareness. To prevent inadvertent contact with tile or RCC, other facilities were utilized to establish crew preferences for body attitude and tool configuration. Finally, a study was performed to determine if attitude constraints are needed for the Space shuttle and International Space Station to reduce SAFER flight difficulty...|$|E
40|$|The International Space Station (ISS), {{because of}} its large {{structure}} and high voltage solar arrays, has a complex plasma interaction with the ionosphere in low Earth orbit (LEO). This interaction of the ISS US Segment photovoltaic (PV) power system with the LEO ionospheric plasma produces floating potentials on conducting elements of the ISS structure relative to the local plasma environment. To control the ISS floating potentials, two Plasma Contactor Units (PCUs) are installed on the Z 1 truss. Each PCU discharges accumulated electrons from the Space Station structure, thus reducing the potential difference between the ISS structure and the surrounding charged plasma environment. Operations of the PCUs were intended to keep the ISS floating potential to 40 Volts (Reference 1). Exposed dielectric surfaces overlying conducting structure on the Space Station will collect an opposite charge from the ionosphere as the ISS charges. In theory, when an Extravehicular Activity (EVA) crewmember is tethered to structure via the crew <b>safety</b> <b>tether</b> or when metallic surfaces of the Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) {{come in contact with}} conducting metallic surfaces of the ISS, the EMU conducting components, including the perspiration-soaked crewmember inside, can become charged to the Space Station floating potential. The concern is the potential dielectric breakdown of anodized aluminum surfaces on the EMU producing an arc from the EMU to the ambient plasma, or nearby ISS structure. If the EMU arcs, an electrical current of an unknown magnitude and duration may conduct through the EVA crewmember, producing an unacceptable condition. This electrical current may be sufficient to startle or fatally shock the EVA crewmember (Reference 2). Hence, as currently defined by the EVA community, the ISS floating potential for all nominal and contingency EVA worksites and translation paths must have a magnitude less than 40 volts relative to the local ionosphere at all times during EVA. Arcing from the EMU is classified as a catastrophic hazard, which requires two-failure tolerant controls, i. e., three hazard controls. Each PCU is capable of maintaining the ISS floating potential below the requirement during EVA. The two PCUs provide a single failure tolerant control of ISS floating potential. In the event of the failure of one or two PCUs, a combination of solar array shunting and turning the solar arrays into their own wakes will be used to supply control of the plasma hazard (Reference 3). The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present on-orbit information that shows that ISS solar array placement with respect to the ISS velocity vector can control solar array plasma charging, and hence, provide an operational control for the plasma hazard. Also, this paper will present on-orbit information that shows that shunting of the ISS solar arrays can control solar array plasma charging, and hence, provide an additional operational control for the plasma hazard...|$|E
