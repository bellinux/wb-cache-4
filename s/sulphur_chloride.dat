40|$|The {{quantitative}} evaluation of emissions from incineration is essential when Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies consider this process as an end-of-life solution for some wastes. Thus, {{the objective of}} this work is to quantify the main gaseous emissions produced when spent AA alkaline batteries are incinerated. With this aim, batteries were kept for 1 h at 1273 K in a refractory steel tube hold in a horizontal electric furnace with temperature control. At one end of the refractory steel tube, a constant air flow input assures the presence of oxygen in the atmosphere and guides the gaseous emissions to a filter system followed by a set of two bubbler flasks having an aqueous solution of 10 % (v/v) nitric acid. After each set of experiments, <b>sulphur,</b> <b>chlorides</b> and metals (As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sb, Tl and Zn) were analyzed in both the solutions obtained from the steel tube washing and from the bubblers. <b>Sulphur,</b> <b>chlorides</b> and metals were quantified, respectively, using barium sulfate gravimetry, the Volhard method and atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS). The emissions of zinc, the most emitted metal, represent about 6. 5 % of the zinc content in the batteries. Emissions of manganese (whose oxide is the main component of the cathode) and iron (from the cathode collector) are negligible when compared with their amount in AA alkaline batteries. Mercury is the metal with higher volatility in the composition of the batteries and was collected even in the second bubbler flask. The amount of chlorides collected corresponds to about 36 % of the chlorine in the battery sleeve that is made from PVC. A considerable part of the HCl formed in PVC plastic sleeve incineration is neutralized with KOH, zinc and manganese oxides and, thus, it is not totally released in the gas. Some of the emissions are predictable through a thermodynamic data analysis at temperatures in the range of 1200 – 1300 K taking into account the composition of the batteries. This analysis was done for most of potential reactions between components in the batteries as well as between them and the surrounding atmosphere and it reasonably agrees the experimental results. The results obtained show the role of alkaline batteries at the acid gases cleaning process, through the neutralization reactions of some of their components. Therefore, LCA of spent AA alkaline batteries at the municipal solid waste (MSW) incineration process must consider this contribution...|$|R

During cyanobacterial growth, low cost nutrients, supplied as wastewater, were used by the cyanobacterial biomass and resulted into reduction in pollutant load of effluent. The conventional wastewater treatment has been unfeasible due to complex process and high energy consumption (Wang et al. 2008).

40|$|The {{experimental}} results {{presented in this}} paper show beyond doubt, that thionyl iodide though highly unstable, can be prepared by the method described. Two important factors should be borne in mind while attempting to prepare such unstable compounds. First and foremost, it is necessary to adjust the experimental conditions, such that the substance gets produced in the form of dilute solution, since the compound decomposes with great rapidity both in the pure state and in concentrated solutions. In fact, treatment of pure thionyl chloride with potassium iodide, yields but little thionyl iodide and results only in the formation of sulphur, sulphur dioxide and iodine. Similarly very little sulphur iodide 17 is produced when <b>sulphur</b> <b>chloride</b> is treated with potassium iodide. Secondly, it is also necessary to bear in mind the decomposing effect that light may have. In fact both sulphur iodide 5 and thionyl iodide (especially the latter) are easily decomposed by light. It is the negleet of these two factors, that is responsible for the failure of carlider workers in preparing these compounds. The method worked out by the author for the preparation of sulphur iodide 5 and thionyl iodide appears to be general in seope and applicable tothe preparation of many new compounds...|$|E

The influence of material temperature (450 - 500 degrees C), flue gas temperature, temperature variations (i. e. thermal cycling) and additives to the fuel (elemental sulphur and dolomite) on deposition and corrosion was studied. The results presented here mainly consider the influence of sulphur additions to the fuel. The fuel was a mixture of 50 % household waste and 50 % industrial waste.

40|$|AbstractThe {{results of}} {{experimental}} investigation {{on the study}} of dissolution kinetics of a Nigerian galena ore in hydrochloric acid solution were discussed. The influence of acid concentration, temperature, particle size, stirring speed and solid/liquid ratio on the extent of dissolution was examined. The elemental analysis by XRF showed that the galena ore is composed mainly of PbS with metals such as Sn, Fe and Zn occurring as minor elements and Mn, Rb, Sr and Nb as traces. The XRD analysis indicated galena as the dominant mineral phase, with the presence of associated minerals, such as α-quartz (SiO 2), sphalerite (ZnS), cassiterite (SnO 2), pyrite (FeS 2) and manganese oxide (MnO 2). Results of leaching studies showed that galena dissolution in HCl solution increases with increasing acid concentration and temperature; while it decreases with particle diameter and solid/liquid ratio at a fixed stirring rate of 450 rpm. The study showed that 94. 8 % of galena was dissolved by 8. 06 M HCl at 80 °C within 120 min with initial solid/liquid ratio of 10 g/L. The corresponding activation energy, Ea was calculated to be 38. 74 kJ/mol.

Initial e. x. a. f. s. measurements [Cramer, Solomonson, Adams & Mortenson (1984) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 106, 1467 - 1471] demonstrated the presence of <b>sulphur</b> (or <b>chloride)</b> ligands in the Mo(IV) and Mo(VI) oxidation states, as well as a variable number of terminal oxo (Mo = O) groups. To synthesize the e. p. r. and e. x. a. f. s. results better, we have conducted new e. p. r. experiments and complementary e. x. a. f. s. measurements under redox and buffer conditions designed to give homogeneous molybdenum species. In contrast with results on other molybdoenzymes, attempts to substitute the enzyme with 17 O by dissolving in isotopically enriched water revealed only very weak hyperfine coupling to 17 O. The significance of this finding is discussed. Experiments with different buffers indicated that buffer ions (e. g. Hepes) could replace the Cl- ligand in the low-pH Mo(V) enzyme form, with only a small change in e. p. r. parameters. E. x. a. f. s. studies of the oxidized and the fully reduced enzyme were consistent with the e. p. r. work in indicating a pH- and anion-dependent change in structure. However, in certain cases non-stoichiometric numbers of Mo = O interactions were determined, complicating the interpretation of the e. x. a. f. s. Uniquely for a molybdenum cofactor enzyme, a substantial proportion of the molecules in a number of enzyme samples appeared to contain no oxo groups. No evidence was found in our samples for the distant 'heavy' ligand atom reported in the previous e. x. a. f. s. study. The nature of the high-pH-low-pH transition is briefly discussed...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Combustion {{toxicity}} {{data obtained}} with the DIN 53436 test method were retrospectively analyzed. The major {{objective was to}} evaluate the applicability of mathematical modeling methods for the prediction of the acute lethal toxic potency of fire effluents. All materials were tested using a combus-tion temperature of 600 &deg;C, duration of exposure of 30 min, and 5 rats/sex/ group. In most experiments the CO 2 /CO ratio appeared to be smaller than 20. The mathematical model applied accommodates lethal toxic effects related to carbon monoxide, hydrogen <b>chloride,</b> <b>sulphur</b> dioxide, ammonia, and nitrogen oxide(s). The analysis of predicted and observed LC 50 data revealed a fairly good correlation (r> 0. 8). The best prediction was achieved when toxic potencies of asphyxiants and irritants were additively combined (slope = 0. 96, r = 0. 82). However, the correlation was best when each mode of action (asphyxia and irri-tation) were {{not considered to be}} additive (slope = 1. 12, r = 0. 88). The evalua-tion of analytical data revealed that for most of the tests performed the concen-tration of irritant gases was relatively low if compared with asphyxic gases. Only in a comparatively small number of studies lethal concentrations of irri-tants (NOx and SO 2) were produced. Experimental evidence suggests that the use of the female rats does not increase the sensitivity of the bioassay. Assess-ment of smoke toxicity from analytical data encourage researchers to minimize the overall use of biological assays...|$|R
30|$|When silver objects have {{remained}} underground {{for a long}} period of time, a mineralization process also occurs. Generally, silver is corrosion resistant. Silver adsorbs molecules of oxygen which are partially converted into oxygen ions (O 2 –). Combination between metal cations and oxygen ions should result in the formation of an oxide (generally Ag 2 O) [8]. Silver oxide is outstandingly protective. When humidity is high, more than two layers of adsorbed water are present and electrochemical reactions take place. According to the Pourbaix diagram [9], Ag 2 O is stable in mildly acid, neutral and basic solutions. However, chloride and sulfide ions tend to enlarge crystalline defects [8]. <b>Chloride,</b> <b>sulphur</b> and oxygen were detected in a Roman silver artefact buried in soil [10]. In a chloride rich environment, the objects can be completely transformed into AgCl. The presence of AgCl is always associated with horn silver. Horn silver objects are stable and are of a greyish aspect [2, 11]. In the presence of sulfate-reducing bacteria, silver objects contain silver sulfide (Ag 2 S) and chlorides (AgCl) [12, 13]. North et al. [3] explained this phenomenon by the alternative exposure of an object in a chloride rich environment to an aerobic (AgCl) and anaerobic (Ag 2 S) environment. In the case of typical archaeological silver objects found in burial sites, the main corrosion products are silver chlorides [2, 12, 14 – 17]. Silver chloride forms a brittle, finely granular layer. However, unfavourable conditions will result in an object being completely converted into silver chloride. Certain soil components (Ca, K, Al, Si, P…) interact with metal corrosion products [14]. The formation of chlorargyrite (AgCl) in burial environments is still poorly understood [18]. The types and mechanisms of metallic silver embrittlement were explained by R. Wanhill [17, 19 – 22]. However, for horn silver corrosion there is only a German study from 1979 [2].|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MSc) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2004. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: A {{series of}} di- and mono-substituted acyl(aroyl) thioureas were {{examined}} for the extraction and transportation of Au(III). Two-phase metal ion extraction experiments {{were employed to}} investigate the extraction behaviour of these ligands. The effect of varying ligand concentration on the extraction trend of these ligands was investigated. The {{results show that the}} different substituent groups on the benzoyl ring can affect the extraction pattern of the metal. Furthermore, the alkyl substituents on the thiourea moiety and varying the ligand concentration have an influence on the percentage of metal ion extracted. With the exception of the H 2 L 2 (N,N-di-propyl-N'- benzoylthiourea) ligand the di-alkyl substituted thioureas were more efficient for the metal ion extraction than the mono-alkyl ligands. In almost all the experimental set ups there was reduction of the Au(lIl) to Au(l) and Au(O) but it was more pronounced with HL 3 (N,N-di-(2 -hydroxyethyl) -N'-benzoylthiourea). Transport experiments were also conducted, the experimental set up for transportation was a concentric type cell involving a 3 -phase system - 2 aqueous phases (source and receiving phase) separated by a chloroform membrane incorporating the ligand. The transport results however only gave a satisfactory result of about 5 % of gold transported by the HL 1 (N,N-dibutyl-N'-benzoylthiourea). All other ligands attempted resulted in metal ion being present in the organic phase, but no metal ion present in the receiving phase. To help drive the transport of the metal ion to the receiving phase CN-, S 203 2 - and perchloric acid were incorporated into the receiving phase. The transport results were not enhanced with these substances being present in the aqueous receiving phase. The aqueous source and receiving phases were analyzed by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy (FAAS). Finally the N,N-diethyl-N'-camphanoylthiourea (HL 10) ligand and its complex with Au(l) were synthesised. Single crystals of the complex were grown for X-ray crystallography and the crystal and molecular structure of the complex was determined. The complex crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P 21. The cell parameters are a = 10. 7356 (7) A b = 16. 3443 (11) A c = 10. 9268 (7) A f 3 = 103. 1450 (10 t, and final R-factor of 1. 76 %. The coordination sphere around Au(l) shows a nearly linear arrangement of <b>sulphur</b> and <b>chloride.</b> AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: In hierdie proefskrif is In aantal mono- en di-gesubstitueerde asiel(ariel) thioureums ondersoek vir die transportasie en ekstraksie van Au(III). Twee-fase metaalioon vloeistof-vloeistof ekstraksie eksperimente is gebruik om die ekstraksie patroon van hierdie ligande te ondersoek. Die effek van verskillende ligand konsentrasies op die ekstraksie neiging van hierdie ligande is ondersoek. Resultate toon dat die verskillende substituente op die benziel ring die ekstraksie patroon van die metaalioon beïnvloed. Verder, is gevind dat die alkiel substituente op die thioureum saam met varierende ligand konsentrasies geensins die metaalioon ekstraksie beïnvloed nie. Met die uitsondering van H 2 L 2 (N,N-dipropiel-N'-benzielthioureum) is die di-alkiel gesubstitueerde ligande meer effektief vir metaalioon ekstraksie in vergelyking met die mono-alkiel ligande. In baie van die eksperimente is In reduksie van Au(llI) na Au(l) en Au(O) gesien en dit is baie duidelik met ligand HL 3 (N,N-di(2 - hidroksie-etiel) N'-benzielthioureum). Alle waterige fases is ge-analiseer met gebruik van Atoomabsorpsie Spektroskopie (AAS). Transportasie eksperimente is ook uitgevoer met gebruik van In drie-fase selsisteem. Twee waterige fases (bron- en ontvang-fase) is geskei met die chloroform membraan fase wat die ligande bevat. Hierdie eksperimente het net In 5 % Au(lll) transportasie getoon met HL 1 (N,N-dibutiel-N'-benzielthioureum). Daar was geen transportasie van Au(lIl) met enige van die ander ligande. Analise van die twee waterige fases het getoon dat die metaalioon eindelik goed ge-ekstraeer is en is teenwoordig in die membraan fase. Om die transportasie van Au(lIl) aan te spoor, is CN-, s 2 ol- en perchloorsuur in die ontvang-fase geinkorporeer. Die resultate was geensins beïnvloed nie. N,N-di-etiel-N'-kamfonielthioureum (HL 10) ligande en die kompleks daarvan met Au(l) is ook gesintetiseer. Enkel-kristalle van die kompleks is verkry en X-straal kristallografiese analiese is onderneem.

40|$|The alum shale of Sweden is a sulphidic {{black shale}} which was mined for its {{contents}} of alum during the 17 th- 19 th centuries. During the thirst {{half of the}} 20 th century alum shale from Kvarntorp was pyrolysed for refinement of its organic matter. The refuse from the pyrolysis process were deposited in a deposit area which is today known as Kvarntorpshögen. This deposit is still hot due to on-going oxidation of the organic matter, pyrite oxidation and the neutralisation of acid by limestone. This heat generation prevents percolation of water to any greater extent due to evaporation. Once it cools the deposit will be susceptible to extraction. Three materials from the Kvarntorp deposit and a block of alum shale were sampled from the Kvarntorp area. These four materials were crushed, sieved and extracted. The extraction experiment was performed at controlled pH which corresponded to dissolution equilibrium of pyrite, carbon dioxide/oxygen, calcite and slaked lime. In the fifth extraction series the material was allowed to set the pH of the water phase. The extraction procedure lasted for 26 days. Metal content of the four shale materials were analysed by XRF (including contents of <b>sulphur,</b> phosphorous and <b>chloride)</b> and by digestion followed by ICP-MS analysis. Mineralogy of the four materials and the extraction residues were studied by XRD analysis. Metal concentrations of the aqueous samples were analysed by ICP-MS and concentrations of dissolved organic- and inorganic carbon by TOC. Electrical conductivity and concentrations of sulphate was also analysed in aqueous phases with non-manipulated pH. Sulphate and calcium concentrations were highest in aqueous samples from weathered fines indicating the presence of gypsum. Presence of gypsum was also confirmed by XRD. Gypsum indicates weathering since it is a neutralisation product of calcite and the sulphuric acid generated by pyrite oxidation. Concentrations of dissolved organic carbon in samples with pH 12. 5 {{were found to be}} highest from red processed shale and lowest from samples of shale. This indicates different hydrolysis properties or origin of the organic matter in the materials. The majority of analysed metals had highest solid solution distribution under acidic, i. e. pH 3. 0, conditions. Under these conditions it was samples from the relatively non-weathered shale that had the highest release of metals, with a few exceptions. At pH 12. 5 high concentrations of V, As and Mo was extracted from almost all four materials. The red processed shale released the highest percentages of its total contents of V, As and Mo under these conditions; 28 %, 55 % and 61 % respectively. The high release of V, As and Mo from red processed shale was most likely a result from the pyrolysis process. The roasting induced the formation of oxides which then easily forms vanadate, arsenate and molybdate when exposed to water. Water percolating the Kvarntorp deposit in the future will initially most likely have a near neutral or slightly acidic pH. Lowest concentrations of metals were found in aqueous samples with pH between 5. 5 - 8. 5. There is a great risk that the pH of the drainage from the Kvarntorp deposit will in time become acidic due to depletion of buffering capacity. Thus the environmental threat will increase...|$|R
