40|$|Lake Nasser {{in south}} Egypt extends over 500  km, 350  km in Egypt and 150  km in Sudan. It has an average width of about 12  km at the 180  m water level. However, as the {{capacity}} of Lake Nasser to store water is not without limits, it is of the outmost importance for Egypt to understand properly the changes which occur in this water body, where the water level may fluctuate in places from 160 to 183  m. To have an intimate understanding of these changes {{it is also important}} to relate them to the surrounding geomorphic, structural, climatic and geologic factors. This study deals with the presentation and interpretation of available statistical data on water level fluctuations in Lake Nasser. The interpretation is also based on correlation with results of the application of remote sensing change detection techniques. Several Landsat images, acquired at different times (1972, 1982, 1987, 2000, 2003 and 2008), have been processed by using the ERDAS and ARC-GIS softwares to follow changes in the shores of the lake and in its water content (volume). According to patterns of water volume fluctuations, the lake displays four types of changes distinguishable in seven sectors (areas). The first type is represented in the <b>sectors</b> <b>displaying</b> maximum changes (or fluctuations). The second type is represented in the <b>sectors</b> <b>displaying</b> a moderate degree of change. The third type is represented in the <b>sectors</b> <b>displaying</b> a negligible degree of change. The fourth type is represented in the <b>sectors</b> <b>displaying</b> no change. Factors controlling water fluctuations in Lake Nasser are: (i) presence of granite and Nubia Sandstone outcrops, (ii) NW, E–W and NE structures (mainly faults), arranged in decreasing order of influence, (iii) presence of wide surfaces of low and relatively flat topography, this generates extensive water bodies prone to high evaporation, (iv) sand encroachment, often causing the segregation of narrow sectors in the lake, this can also generate broad sectors with shallow water depth, that does not correspond to the average depth of the water body...|$|R

The study area has been divided into three sectors {{on the basis of}} drainage, geomorphology and nature of the beach and shelf topography. Surface textures of the northern <b>sector</b> <b>display</b> an array of mechanical features like conchoidal fracture, V marks and impact pits, indicating the dominance of mechanical processes. However, silica precipitation in the form of globules indicates an added influence of chemical processes in the Northern sector. The presence of chemical features in northern sector, where energy level is high, corroborates the addition of quartz grains from paleo-sediments, from the nearby Tertiary and Cretaceous formations. Central sector quartz grains display the signatures of chemical and mechanical processes. The presence of step like furrows in southern sector is an indicator of fluvial low energy conditions, and supplements the role of littoral currents in depositing the quartz grains along the coastal region...|$|E

40|$|The {{source of}} the auroral {{phenomenon}} known as omega bands is not yet known. We examine in detail five different intervals when omega bands were observed on March 9 th, 2008 between 0400 UT and 1100 UT over central Canada using both ground and space-based instrumentation. The THEMIS all sky imagers show the development {{of some of the}} omega bands from north-south streamers. Spherical elementary currents derived from ground magnetometer data indicate that the omega bands lie near the interface between the region 1 and region 2 currents in the post-midnight sector. THEMIS spacecraft data from the pre-midnight <b>sector</b> <b>display</b> multiple high speed flows and dipolarization features associated with high levels of geomagnetic activity, whereas four GOES geosynchronous spacecraft show multiple injections and dipolarization features. Magnetic field line tracing suggests that the magnetospheric location of the omega bands is at or just beyond geosynchronous orbit. We discuss in detail two potential source mechanisms for the omega bands: plasma sheet velocity shears and high speed flows in the magnetotail and relate the available data to those mechanisms. Our data and a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation support high speed flows in the magnetotail as the most likely generation mechanism, although the distribution of the magnetotail spacecraft does not provide unambiguous support for our interpretation of the source mechanism.

40|$|Abstract—In this study, we {{registered}} live-time interventional {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (iMRI) slices with a previously obtained high-resolution MRI volume that in turn can be reg-istered {{with a variety of}} functional images, e. g., PET, SPECT, for tumor targeting. We created and evaluated a slice-to-volume (SV) registration algorithm with special features for its potential use in iMRI-guided radio-frequency (RF) thermal ablation of prostate cancer. The algorithm features included a multiresolution approach, two similarity measures, and automatic restarting to avoid local minima. Imaging experiments were performed on volunteers using a conventional 1. 5 -T MR scanner and a clinical 0. 2 -T C-arm iMRI system under realistic conditions. Both high-resolution MR volumes and actual iMRI image slices were acquired from the same volunteers. Actual and simulated iMRI images were used to test the dependence of SV registration on image noise, receive coil inhomogeneity, and RF needle artifacts. To quantitatively assess registration, we calculated the mean voxel displacement over a volume of interest between SV registration and volume-to-volume registration, which was previously shown to be quite accurate. More than 800 registration experiments were performed. For transverse image slices covering the prostate, the SV registration algorithm was 100 % successful with an error of 2 mm, and the average and standard deviation was only 0. 4 mm 0. 2 mm.

40|$|Background The study {{examines}} health-care accessibility in eastern Europe {{through the lens}} of individual-level unmet needs for examination or treatment. Investigated are the magnitude and nature of access barriers as well as the structure of inequality. Methods Our research covered seven countries: Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Slovakia, over the period 2005 - 09. Logit and multinomial logit models are estimated for each country-year combination to inspect the relation between respondents' socioeconomic characteristics and the probability of reporting unmet medical needs. The dataset based on European Union (EU) Statistics on Income and Living Conditions comprises 574 ? 390 observations. Study design permits the interpretation of findings in absolute and comparative terms and shows the problem dynamics. Findings Health care is most easily accessible in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Affordability issues and prohibitive waiting times are prevalent in Poland and the Baltic states. Mobility and information represent relatively minor access barriers. The poorest households, the unemployed, working-age cohorts, and women are generally more exposed than the population at large to problems in accessing health care. Through the course of the analysed period, we saw an overall improvement in access conditions. Interpretation The findings show that substantial differences exist between the countries that constitute an arguably homogenous group of post-communist, new EU member states. The best performers are not only the biggest per capita spenders on health, but they also rely on competition in health-care financing. The remaining countries, where the state remains a key player in the health <b>sector,</b> <b>display</b> lower and varying levels of performance. The nature of access barriers is indicative of gaps in coverage and inadequacy of public sector resources relative to need, which call for systemic solutions. In the context of tightening welfare states' belts, reform policies should seek good practices by observing the peer countries' experiences with health-care organisation.

30|$|Most of {{the people}} working in the <b>sector</b> <b>display</b> {{a high level of}} {{consideration}} for Lyon’s culinary tradition. However, some consider it only as a branding tool. Managers of luxury hotels for instance seem to envision gastronomy just as being an extra item in the package they want to offer to their clients (interview 5 and survey). However, their discourse does not exactly match the reality. Actually, their performance is also linked to the territory’s, as they underline in the sentence “there are three things important in the restauration sector: the location, the location and… the location (l’emplacement)”. 12 These managers obviously refer in a first time to the ‘landscape’ quality of the site, yet this remark implies that their activities are strongly embedded in the territory. They probably are aware that they would benefit from the development of the sector as a whole but not willing to personally invest for it. This kind of freeriding approach can slow down the development of the RDP since it creates tensions between actors (interview 6), {{but it is not the}} main obstacle to its development. A common drawback of strong identities is the mechanical division appearing between insiders and outsiders. For instance, current difficulties of the regional government to create a gastronomy “cluster” could be rooted in the parallel evolution of multiple pre-existing networks: “All the actors are already intricately linked with each other, which makes it very difficult when it comes to creating new forms of cooperation” (interview 2). Actually, the cluster project gathers seventeen institutional and private actors that all have their internal logic. For instance, the producers’ association R 3 AP is not keen on exchanging knowledge with other partners (interview 5). Some of them put into question its very existence, wondering “where does the money go”. The notion of time is besides central to the RDP analysis, since “A development platform is connected with the past trajectories, but the concept describes the future potential of the platform” (Harmaakorpi 2006 : 1090). In order to achieve the transition from these past trajectories to a functioning platform, a “conceptualisation” of the regional innovative system is necessary (ibid: 1092). However, reaching this second step is far from being an easy task. The new identity has to meet a lot of potentially contradictory requirements. For instance, it has to be ambitious but not disconnected from reality; otherwise actors would describe it as being mere communication (Aranguren et al. 2010). In Lyon’s case, attempts have been made to gather people around the identity of “gastronomy capital” (Grand Lyon 2007). However, adhesion to this image is not widespread. Students from the Institut Paul Bocuse recently wrote a bachelor dissertation based on interviews (Anaf-Grisard and Borel 2010) around the situation of Lyon in the global gastronomy market. The majority {{of the people}} they interviewed was very doubtful of Lyon’s capacity to compete for the title of “gastronomy capital” with metropolis such as Paris, New York City or Tokyo, first because of agglomeration effects, and then because these cities have complex communication budgets. This observation was reinforced by the interviews carried out (interviews 3, 5 and 8) but also by the questionnaires. The panel of chefs seem far less attached to the ‘conceptualized’ identity (Lyon as a ‘gastronomy capital’) than to the traditional.|$|E

30|$|Second, {{by means}} of the {{economic}} benefits of water use analysis at sectoral level, we have found that the industrial and service <b>sectors</b> <b>display</b> relatively large economic benefits of water use than the agriculture. This leads us to conclude, on the one hand, that Morocco has an economic structure based on sectors that consume a large amount of water, both directly and indirectly. This structure is based mainly on Agriculture, hunting and forestry (sector 1), Manufacture of food and tobacco products (sector 4) and hotels and restaurants (sector 8). On the other hand, the greater water saving in Morocco could be made in the Agriculture, hunting and forestry sector. Given Morocco’s limited water resources, if we want to face a sustainable economic development, the agricultural sector should modify the use of water to a great extent by adopting alternative water-saving technology. However, we cannot claim that agricultural water use should give way to other uses relying solely on the added value per unit of water used because. In fact, considered in isolation, this indicator highly inflates the estimated benefit of transferring water from agricultural sectors (with low added value per unit of water used) to industrial <b>sectors</b> (<b>displaying</b> a high added value per unit of water used) (Young 2005). For this reason, affirming such conclusion requires a detailed and comprehensive study that encompasses economic, social and environmental aspects.|$|R

40|$|For a {{developing}} country like India where socio-economic problems such as poverty,unemployment and inequality influence policy decisions, it becomes important to study interlinkages among the constituent sectors so that positive growth impulses emerging among the sectors could be identified and fostered to sustain the growth momentum. An in-depth understanding of inter-sectoral dynamics becomes {{all the more important}} for policy makers so that effective monetary, credit and fiscal policies could be designed {{in order to be able}} to achieve the broader objective of inclusive development. In this backdrop, the present paper endeavors to study inter-sectoral linkages in the Indian economy both through input-output (I-O) approach and econometric exercises using co-integration and state-space models. Cointegration analysis is carried out both at sectoral and sub-sectoral levels since mid- 1980 s. At the broad sectoral level, primary, secondary and tertiary (excluding community, social and personal services) <b>sectors</b> <b>display</b> strong long-run equilibrium relationship amongst each other. These <b>sectors</b> also <b>display</b> strong long-run equilibrium relationship with one another in a bivariate framework. At the sub-sectoral level, existence of long-term equilibrium was found between ‘trade, hotels, transport & communication’ and ‘manufacturing’ sectors. Further, the financial sector activity in the ‘banking & insurance’ sector was found to be co-integrated with the ‘manufacturing’ and ‘primary’ sectors. The <b>sectors,</b> which <b>displayed</b> long-run equilibrium relationships, were re-estimated through state space model using Kalman filter. This also corroborated that variation in one sector influenced the other sector’s performance over time. In view of the prevailing sectoral inter-relationships, the paper explores policy options so that positive growth impulses developing among the sectors are fostered. ...|$|R
