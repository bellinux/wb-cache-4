5000|$|A {{widely used}} method of {{reducing}} feather pecking {{is to reduce}} light intensity, but because a minimum of 5 lux is necessary to maintain egg laying, intensities of 10 lux or more are recommended. At these low intensities it becomes difficult for humans to inspect the hens properly, especially in the more crowded densely populated housing systems, and human colour vision is hindered making the detection of blood almost impossible. Low light intensites {{may be associated with}} other welfare costs to the hens as they prefer to eat in brightly lit environments and prefer brightly lit areas for active behaviour but dim (<10 lux) for inactive behaviour. [...] Dimming the lights can also cause problems when the intensity is then abruptly increased temporarily to inspect the hens; this has been associated as a risk factor of increased feather pecking and the birds can become frightened resulting in panic-type ("hysteria") reactions which can increase the risk of injury. In turkeys, low light intensities (perhaps in combination with long light phases) can cause retinal detachment and buphthalmia, a distortion of the eye morphology that can lead to blindness. [...] This {{does not appear to have}} been investigated for layer hens under modern lighting patterns.

40|$|In {{response}} to growing {{greenhouse gas emissions}} associated with tourism in New Zealand, 14 possible strategies centering on sustainable tourist types, energy-efficiency and educational campaigns were developed to reduce emissions. The strategies, along with some information on greenhouse gas emissions from tourism, were discussed with eight members of an Advisory Group (private and public sector, and marketing agencies) for a research program on international tourists’ energy use. Each member was interviewed separately to gain individual perspectives on climate change {{in general and the}} proposed strategies in particular. Climate change was not of high priority to those tourism stakeholders interviewed, but they expressed concern about the planned carbon tax to be introduced in 2007. Notwithstanding this, the interviewees stressed the importance of sustainability, triple bottom line reporting, and resource efficiency. They felt that to deal effectively with tourism’s greenhouse gas emissions some legislation would be required, and that this should allow for a partnership between Government and industry that provides sufficient room for industry initiatives, such as voluntary benchmarking and certification. Tourists could also play a role in this process, for example by participating in carbon-offsetting schemes, supporting new technologies (e. g. hydrogen cars) and by actively engaging in energy-efficiency measures (e. g. <b>switching</b> <b>off</b> <b>lights</b> in their hotel). Overall, competition and the economic imperative dominate decision making and, therefore, climate change strategies need to provide multiple benefits, particularly financial, to be effective. Existing competition makes it hard for individual companies to take the lead, which demonstrates the need for concerted initiatives by a critical mass of companies, supported by a favorable policy framework...|$|E

40|$|Southern Africa {{is noted}} {{for not only}} {{constant}} power shortages but also poor access to electricity. In Zambia, for example, 75 % of the population does {{not have access to}} electricity. This is partly because although Zambia has one of the lowest energy tariffs in Southern Africa, when compared with household monthly income, the resource is still reasonably unaffordable. Therefore, there is need to find innovative ways of reducing energy cost. Recent studies have indicated that there are patterns that show that there is a relationship between households' lifestyles and energy consumption. This means that understanding household lifestyles and how that impacts on energy use would be crucial in helping occupants to change their behaviours. This would result in the minimisation of energy consumption and thus a reduction in energy bills. However, there is a dearth of scholarly literature about households' lifestyles and their impacts on energy consumption in most developing countries including Zambia. This study investigates the perceptions of different lifestyles on household energy consumption and knowledge about energy efficiency in the city of Kitwe, the second largest city in Zambia. Motivation and barriers to energy efficiency have also been investigated. To achieve this, a mixed research approach was adopted. Firstly, a quantitative closed structured questionnaire instrument was used to collect data from 59 households in Kitwe. Secondly, mini-focus group discussions (average size of 5) ― brought about by the curiosity of residents and hence the contribution as families per household ― were undertaken in the informal settlement. The major findings are that households are generally motivated to implement energy saving strategies like covering pots when cooking, <b>switching</b> <b>off</b> <b>lights</b> in rooms that are not in use and that more information is needed as lack of knowledge and ‘landlord control' were identified as some of the barriers to energy efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Background. As a society, our {{interaction}} with the environment is having {{a negative impact on}} human health. For example, an increase in car use for short trips, over walking or cycling, has contributed to an increase in obesity, diabetes and poor heart health and also contributes to pollution, which is associated with asthma and other respiratory diseases. In order to change the nature of that interaction, to be more positive and healthy, it is recommended that individuals adopt a range of environmentally friendly behaviours (such as walking for transport and reducing the use of plastics). Effective interventions aimed at increasing such behaviours will need to be evidence based and {{there is a need for}} the rapid communication of information from the point of research, into policy and practice. Further, a number of health disciplines, including psychology and public health, share a common mission to promote health and well-being. Therefore, the objective of this project is to take a cross-discipline and collaborative approach to reveal psychological mechanisms driving environmentally friendly behaviour. This objective is further divided into three broad aims, the first of which is to take a cross-discipline and collaborative approach to research. The second aim is to explore and identify the salient beliefs which most strongly predict environmentally friendly behaviour. The third aim is to build an augmented model to explain environmentally friendly behaviour. The thesis builds on the understanding that an interdisciplinary collaborative approach will facilitate the rapid transfer of knowledge to inform behaviour change interventions. Methods. The application of this approach involved two surveys which explored the psycho-social predictors of environmentally friendly behaviour. Following a qualitative pilot study, and in collaboration with an expert panel comprising academics, industry professionals and government representatives, a self-administered, Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) based, mail survey was distributed to a random sample of 3000 residents of Brisbane and Moreton Bay Region (Queensland, Australia). This survey explored specific beliefs including attitudes, norms, perceived control, intention and behaviour, as well as environmental altruism and green identity, in relation to walking for transport and <b>switching</b> <b>off</b> <b>lights</b> when not in use. Following analysis of the mail survey data and based on feedback from participants and key stakeholders, an internet survey was employed (N= 451) to explore two additional behaviours, switching off appliances at the wall when not in use, and shopping with reusable bags. This work is presented as a series of interrelated publications which address each of the research aims. Presentation of Findings. Chapter five of this thesis consists of a published paper which addresses the first aim of the research and outlines the collaborative and multidisciplinary approach employed in the mail survey. The paper argued that forging alliances with those who are in a position to immediately utilise the findings of research has the potential to improve the quality and timely communication of research. Illustrating this timely communication, Chapter six comprises a report presented to Moreton Bay Regional Council (MBRC). This report addresses aim's one and two. The report contains a summary of participation in a range of environmentally friendly behaviours and identifies the beliefs which most strongly predicted walking for transport and <b>switching</b> <b>off</b> <b>lights</b> (from the mail survey). These salient beliefs were then recommended as targets for interventions and included: participants believing that they might save money; that their neighbours also switch off lights; that it would be inconvenient to walk for transport and that their closest friend also walks for transport. Chapter seven also addresses the second aim and presents a published conference paper in which the salient beliefs predicting the four specified behaviours (from both surveys) are identified and potential applications for intervention are discussed. Again, a range of TPB based beliefs, including descriptive normative beliefs, were predictive of environmentally friendly behaviour. This paper was also provided to MBRC, along with recommendations for applying the findings. For example, as descriptive normative beliefs were consistently correlated with environmentally friendly behaviour, local councils could engage in marketing and interventions (workshops, letter box drops, internet promotions) which encourage parents and friends to model, rather than simply encourage, environmentally friendly behaviour. The final two papers, presented in Chapters eight and nine, addresses the third aim of the project. These papers each present two behaviours together to inform a TPB based theoretical model with which to predict environmentally friendly behaviour. A generalised model is presented, which is found to predict the four specific behaviours under investigation. The role of demographics was explored across each of the behaviour specific models. It was found that some behaviour's differ by age, gender, income or education. In particular, adjusted models predicted more of the variance in walking for transport amongst younger participants and females. Adjusted models predicted more variance in <b>switching</b> <b>off</b> <b>lights</b> amongst those with a bachelor degree or higher and predicted more variance in switching off appliances amongst those on a higher income. Adjusted models predicted more variance in shopping with reusable bags for males, people 40 years or older, those on a higher income and those with a bachelor degree or higher. However, model structure and general predictability was relatively consistent overall. The models provide a general theoretical framework from which to better understand the motives and predictors of environmentally friendly behaviour. Conclusion. This research has provided an example of the benefits of a collaborative interdisciplinary approach. It has identified a number of salient beliefs which can be targeted for social marketing campaigns and educational initiatives; and these findings, along with recommendations, have been passed on to a local council to be used as part of their ongoing community engagement programs. Finally, the research has informed a practical model, as well as behaviour specific models, for predicting sustainable living behaviours. Such models can highlight important core constructs from which targeted interventions can be designed. Therefore, this research represents an important step in undertaking collaborative approaches to improving population health through human-environment interactions...|$|E
40|$|Rather than {{providing}} {{incentives for}} the one-time purchase of technologies, behavior change programs rely on low- or no- cost actions {{to save energy}} and reduce demand. These actions must be sustained over {{time in order to}} be effective. Therefore, understanding the persistence of energy-saving actions is critical to incorporating behavior change programs into utility energy efficiency program portfolios. Unfortunately, there are few studies that have examined persistence of energy-saving actions over time. This paper provides new results from an evaluation of a community-based energy efficiency program showing sustained energy efficiency behaviors over an 18 -month time frame. Actions were sustained despite limited program follow-up and no financial incentives. The program, which is designed to encourage community members to commit to saving energy by signing a pledge form, uses a multi-pronged approach to reach out to as many community members as possible, and reinforces messages by relying on a variety of marketing efforts. These efforts include mass marketing, outreach at community events, and contests. Using a panel study with a random sample of pledgees, evaluators were able to ask pledgees about their energy-savings behaviors four times over the course of 18 months. Results showed that participants conducted low-cost and no-cost actions, and they sustained these actions over time. Participants most commonly reported taking the following actions since pledging: <b>switching</b> <b>off</b> <b>lights,</b> switching off electronics, installing energy efficient lights, using computer power management, changing thermostat settings, and using a clothesline rather than a clothes dryer. Respondents who could recall their pledge were more likely to conduct their pledged action(s) compared to those respondents who could not recall their pledge. Furthermore, “high recallers” completed a significantly greater proportion of pledged actions compared to “low recallers. ” This paper includes a description of the program model, detailed results related to sustained behaviors over time, and recommendations for encouraging persistence and implementing behavior change programs. The authors also offer recommendations for setting up tracking systems early in the program launch to facilitate a more detailed understanding of pathways to program participation and behavior change...|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Research into energy demand in office buildings has {{tended to focus on}} building fabric or systems, or the organisation as a whole, rather than the actions or motivations of individual building occupants. This study applies an attitude-behaviour approach used more frequently with household or travel behaviours to energy demand behaviours by individual occupants in office settings. The approach is extended to include contextual factors such as behavioural control, organisational expectations and social influences. Comparisons are drawn between the office and home settings. The study took place in the offices of two local authorities, Nottingham City Council and Nottinghamshire County Council, and included a questionnaire survey (n= 819), semi-structured interviews (n= 9), and building surveys (n= 5). Behaviours examined included <b>switching</b> <b>off</b> <b>lights,</b> computers and computer monitors. Lighting behaviours were reported to be carried out more frequently than computer monitor behaviours in both the office and household settings. Analysis of behaviours identified that they needed to be considered at a specific level, according to the equipment (lighting, computer monitors), setting (office, home), and triggers (finishing a task, leaving a room). The physical context of the behaviour was particularly important. Different levels of individual control over energy affected the performance of behaviours. No evidence was found to support the notion of spillover that enacting one energy demand behaviour might lead to the enactment of further energy demand behaviours, including for similar behaviours performed in different settings (e. g. the office and the home). Organisational, social and psychological/attitudinal influences on individual behaviour were also examined. Structural Equation Modelling examined influences proposed by the Theory of Planned Behaviour and Values-Beliefs-Norms Theory. Neither theory provided a strong explanation of the collected data. However, support was found for the Perceived Behavioural Control construct, while moral and value-led constructs had a small influence on behaviour. This thesis provides recommendations for practitioners and policy makers seeking to reduce individual-level energy demand in office settings, and for future research into energy use in organisational settings. Recommendations include promoting energy saving as an aspect of professionalism, characterising energy demand behaviours specifically by setting and equipment, and recognising the importance of the social aspects of shared office environments...|$|E
40|$|There {{is great}} {{potential}} to improve energy efficiency in existing Swedish residential buildings. However, the {{successful implementation of}} efficiency measures depends on economical and technical factors, {{as well as on}} the attitudes and perceptions of the relevant actors. A better understanding of their attitudes and perceptions may influence the design of suitable policy measures that increase the adoption of energy efficiency measures. In this context, we conducted mail-in surveys completed by owners of detached houses, chairmen of co-operative housing associations (bostadsrättsförening) and municipality energy advisers in Sweden. We also interviewed window sellers/installers in Jämtland. Results show that it was important for the majority of homeowners to reduce their household energy use, with most undertaking no-cost measures (e. g., <b>switching</b> <b>off</b> <b>lights).</b> However, 70 – 90 % of the responding homeowners had no intention of adopting building envelope measures over the next 10 years. The main reason for non-adoption was that homeowners were satisfied with the physical condition and thermal performance of their existing building envelope components. Homeowners who thought their energy cost was high were more likely to adopt an investment measure compared to those who thought their energy cost was low. Investment costs and annual energy cost savings were the most important factors in adoption of energy efficient building envelope measures. Therefore, economic incentives may induce homeowners to adopt energy efficiency investment measures. However, a large percentage (64 %) of homeowners was unaware of the existence of government support for reducing household energy use. Information campaigns announcing the availability of economic incentives and the cost advantages of energy efficiency measures may be helpful in the adoption decision. Homeowners‘ considered interpersonal sources, builders, installers and energy advisers as important sources of information for their adoption of energy efficiency measures. Though a large percentage of respondents considered energy advisers as an important source of information, only 14 % of homeowners had contacted an energy adviser in the past. Our findings suggest that the energy advice service is important for homeowners, but more efforts are needed to increase homeowners‘ awareness of and satisfaction with such services. The majority of municipal energy advisers were of the opinion that more training in technical aspects of energy issues and increased financial support could improve their performance. Installers and material suppliers are important actors in homeowners‘ adoption of energy efficiency measures. For example, approximately 53 % of responding homeowners to a survey in Jämtland/Västernorrland stated that the window seller/installer from whom they had bought windows had recommended a particular type of window, and 97 % had ii installed the windows that were recommended. The window sellers/installers in Jämtland prefer a window that is ―reasonably‖ energy efficient. They believe that windows with a U-value of 1. 2 W/m 2 K are good and there is no reason to further improve the energy efficiency. The majority did not recommend windows with U-value < 1. 2 W/m 2 K. They were concerned about the condensation issues and high prices of such windows. This may influence the diffusion of very energy efficient windows in Swedish detached houses. About 80 - 95 % of chairmen in co-operative housing associations who responded to our survey had no intention of adopting building envelope measures over the next 10 years. They were satisfied with the existing building envelope components, which may be one of the reasons for this lack of intention. As in the case of owners of detached houses, economic factors, like annual energy cost savings and investment costs, guide the implementation of energy efficiency investment measures in co-operative housing associations. However, about 66 % of the responding chairmen did not consider financial constraint as a barrier to implementing investment intensive energy efficiency measures. For 54 % of the respondents limited in-house competency to evaluate the benefits of energy efficiency measures was the main barrier. The majority of owners of detached houses (80 %) and chairmen of co-operative housing associations (70 %) perceived that economic policy instruments, such as investment subsidies and tax deductions, would encourage them to implement energy efficiency measures. Other policy instruments, especially information instruments, were perceived as less effective. Among various information policies, increasing the frequency of meter reading received the highest approval with 38 % of homeowners, whereas approximately 41 % of housing association chairmen thought that individual metering of heating and hot water use could be effective. Approximately 30 % of homeowners and housing association chairmen thought that energy declaration was effective...|$|E

Visitors can experiment with both the energy generation and consumption settings to view, compare and consider the impact such decisions and control variations can effect human comfort and energy efficiency levels. ECOS has been developed for presentation on a large screen multi-touch installation, The Cube, in the new Science and Engineering Centre (SEC) at the Queensland University of Technology (QUT). The SEC features a tri-generational system and contains a complex sensor network to track energy usage. In collaboration with the SEC building managers, ECOS uses the energy consumption and generation data of the actual buildings in which it is presented. This data has been incorporated into an interactive simulation, which is both engaging to users and highly informative. The ECOS project draws on the practice of Eco-Visualisation, a term used to encapsulate the important merging of environmental data visualization with the philosophy of sustainability. Holmes (2007) uses the term Eco-Visualisation (EV) to refer to data visualisations that ‘display the real time consumption statistics of key environmental resources for the goal of promoting ecological literacy’. EVs are commonly artifacts of interaction design, information design, interface design and industrial design, but are informed by various intellectual disciplines that have shared interests in sustainability. As a result of surveying a number of projects, Pierce, Odom and Blevis (2008) outline strategies for designing and evaluating effective EVs, including ‘connecting behavior to material impacts of consumption, encouraging playful engagement and exploration with energy, raising public awareness and facilitating discussion, and stimulating critical reflection. ’ Consequently, Froehlich (2010) and his colleagues also use the term ‘Eco-feedback technology’ to describe the same field. ‘Green IT’ is another variation which Tomlinson (2010) describes as a ‘field at the juncture of two trends… the growing concern over environmental issues’ and ‘the use of digital tools and techniques for manipulating information. ’ The ECOS Project team is guided by these principles, but more importantly, propose an example for how these principles may be achieved. The ECOS Project presents a simplified interface to the very complex domain of thermodynamic and climate modeling. From a mathematical perspective, the simulation can be divided into two models, which interact and compete for balance – the comfort of ECOS’ virtual denizens and the ecological and environmental health of the virtual world. The comfort model is based on the study of psychometrics, and specifically those relating to human comfort. This provides baseline micro-climatic values for what constitutes a comfortable working environment within the QUT SEC buildings. The difference between the ambient outside temperature (as determined by polling the Google Weather API for live weather data) and the internal thermostat of the building (as set by the user) allows us to estimate the energy required to either heat or cool the building. Once the energy requirements can be ascertained, this is then balanced with the ability of the building to produce enough power from green energy sources (solar, wind and gas) to cover its energy requirements. Calculating the relative amount of energy produced by wind and solar can be done by, in the case of solar for example, considering the size of panel and the amount of solar radiation it is receiving at any given time, which in turn can be estimated based on the temperature and conditions returned by the live weather API. Some of these variables can be altered by the user, allowing them to attempt to optimize the health of the building. The variables that can be changed are the budget allocated to green energy sources such as the Solar Panels, Wind Generator and the Air conditioning to control the internal building temperature. These variables influence the energy input and output variables, modeled on the real energy usage statistics drawn from the SEC data provided by the building managers. Research Background and Methodology In 2010 it was reported that ‘ 30 - 40 percent of all primary energy produced Worldwide is used in buildings’ (Howe 2010). Despite this, the enormous impact of building related activities and systems on natural resources are often hidden from public view. Energy consumption and generation in buildings is seldom reported, and while building visitors are frequently told that <b>switching</b> <b>off</b> <b>lights</b> or installing solar panels {{have a positive impact on}} energy usage, the lack of context within these statements makes them poor motivators. Through effective information and interaction design, playful interfaces were developed to bridge this gap between understanding and action by presenting data to students and the public in a way that contextualizes energy consumption. The ECOS project team relied on expert consultation and iterative design processes to finalize a design that presents a dramatization of the relationship between climate and energy consumption. ECOS focuses on the principle that humans can have both a positive and negative impact on ecosystems with both local and global consequence. Its objectives are aligned with many of the core elements of effective eco-visualizations, its primary goals being encouraging playful engagement and exploration with green energy related data and stimulating critical reflection. Research Significance and Impact This project transforms complex data and concepts into playful and informative interfaces simulating sustainable energy systems for inner city buildings. Adapting practice-based research methods to maximize the effectiveness of collaboration with university, construction, government and education experts. Most significantly, demonstrating the vital role of the visual and technical disciplines in the promoting of emerging social and environmental concerns by producing interactive models for exploration and cooperation. The ECOS Project received 200 000 in development funding from the Vice Chancellery and the QUT Science and Technology Precinct Project plus inkind contributions from QUT in technology provision and support as well as extensive consultation time from various industry partners. The ECOS Project was launched along with the Cube Installation at the SEC Opening ceremony in February 2013 by Australia’s then Prime Minister Julia Gillard. Hundreds of Queensland primary and secondary students have toured and participated in education programs designed around the ECOS Project.
