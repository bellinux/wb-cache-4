50|$|KPMG Centre is a {{skyscraper}} in Downtown Dallas, Texas. The building rises 481 feet (147 meters). It contains 34 floors, and {{was completed}} in 1980. KPMG Centre currently stands as the 22nd-tallest building in the city. The building {{is well known for}} its sloping exterior glass walls, which <b>slant</b> <b>inward</b> from the building's top floor to ground level. KPMG Centre is owned by World Class Capital Group, an Austin-based real estate investment firm.|$|E
50|$|Most frogs {{catch their}} prey via {{a flick of}} their tongue. The tongue is coated in a sticky secretion, which allows for the {{adhesion}} of the prey to the tongue. The catch is then taken into the mouth and swallowed right away, as frogs do not chew their food and many do not even have teeth. Members of Crinia do have vomerine teeth, which are pairs of teeth-like plates {{on the roof of}} the mouth that <b>slant</b> <b>inward,</b> but they appear to be rather unimportant. Once the food is in the stomach, the stomach compresses and abdominal muscles aid in digestion and expulsion of waste.|$|E
40|$|Built at {{the turn}} of the 18 th century, Charleston, South Carolina’s Pink House gets its name from the coral Bermuda stone that was used to build it. Bermuda stone is unique in that it is soft and malleable, but when exposed to outside weather, it hardens and strengthens. This pre-revolution tavern stands three stores tall, each story {{consisting}} of a single, square, 13 by 13 foot room. The third floor’s ceilings <b>slant</b> <b>inward</b> due to the roof. It has undergone a few restorations, including an addition of a wing on the southeast corner, and an office/library on the third floor. The Pink House remains the oldest standing tavern in the South. Since it’s construction, it has been owned by many people who used it as a tavern, a publishing business, and now an art gallery. [URL]...|$|E

2500|$|Determining {{the cause}} of death was inconclusive, as the severe {{decomposition}} on the body had removed all signs of possible violence from the remains. However, the case is believed to have been a murder, as suicide was eliminated as a possibility of the girl's death. The circumstances of the location of the remains had also sparked suspicion among authorities. Toxicology tests were conducted to see if any drugs or alcohol had been in her system, yet the results were never released. Although the body was found in autumn, she had died in the summer, two to four months previously. This was established by examining traces from insects that were found on the remains. She had an overbite, and some fillings and dental sealants were found on the upper molars with no current cavities. The overbite was not described as extreme, but may have been noticeable, which could be a reliable feature depicted in her facial reconstruction. The estimated height was between 4'10" [...] and 5'4", the victim being between fifteen and twenty-one years old and weighing between 110 to 135 pounds, at an [...] "average frame". Examiners believe she was either white or Hispanic, although Native American and Asian races cannot be ruled out. She also may have been biracial. Other physical characteristics included a healed rib fracture and being pigeon toed or knock-kneed, which may have been noticeable when she walked, as her feet were <b>slanted</b> <b>inward.</b> She also suffered from spina bifida occulta, but may have been unaware of the condition. To obtain DNA information, her femur was transported to the University of Texas.|$|R
50|$|Another {{distinguishing}} feature of S. mirus is its dentition; it jaws {{are lined with}} hundreds of small, chisel-shaped, closely spaced teeth. These marginal teeth are each about 3 mm in cross-sectional diameter and form an unbroken row along both {{the upper and lower}} jaws. While they point directly downward in the upper jaw, the marginal teeth <b>slant</b> slightly <b>inward</b> (mesially) in the lower jaw. Teeth on the vomer bones form a second parallel row on the palate that is not as extensive as the marginal tooth row. At about 1 mm in diameter, these teeth are smaller than the marginal teeth. The rest of the palate has subtle pustular ornamentation at a finer scale than on the skull roof. This is a unique condition among early tetrapods, many of which have more extensive ornamentation on the palate including bony denticles, additional tooth rows, and palatal tusks. The dentition of Spathicephalus is so unusual that isolated jaw fragments with teeth in them can easily be identified.|$|R
2500|$|By September 1949, the {{memorial}} was still [...] "nowhere near finished." [...] None {{of the tower}} rooms in floors three through nine were finished, although the observation deck was under construction. The Scottish Rite agreed to fund the observation deck. The observation deck was accessible only by a circular stairway. In late 1949, the Cryptic Lodge Room (also known as the [...] "North Room") was finished and the two elevators were installed on {{the north and south}} side of the building. The room contained seating for 450 and an organ (which was used for the first time during the room's dedication ceremony). To avoid piercing the second floor's memorial hall, the elevators <b>slanted</b> <b>inward</b> at 7.5 degrees. They were [...] apart on the first floor, but only [...] apart at the observation deck. They were the only slanting elevators in the world when installed, and the motors for them had to be passed up through the shafts in order to get them to the roof. Other decorative changes were made by late 1949 as well. [...] A woven Persian carpet, the largest in the world and worth $1 million, was donated to {{the memorial}} by Sarkis Nahigian (a Masonic member from Chicago). (It was installed in the Alexandria-Washington Replica Lodge Room. [...] But it had to be folded in order to fit in the room, which caused wear on the rug. [...] The rug was removed after several years and reinstalled in the memorial hall on the second floor.) In the Memorial Hall, two stained glass windows designed and manufactured by Robert M. Metcalf were being installed. Bronze doors, grillwork, and window sashes had been installed throughout the first floor, the first floor assembly hall was completed, the kitchen and dining room were finished, the north and south corridors on the first floor were completed, and an addition to the heating plant installed. The [...] "Hall of Presidents" [...] was also finished. [...] This walkway on the upper level of the auditorium contained plaques depicting Presidents of the United States who were Masons. The Shriners, too, completed their rooms on the first floor.|$|R
50|$|The Eastern coachwhip is an active, {{fast-moving}} snake. It is diurnal and hunts it prey by {{smell and}} sight. It frequently hunts with its head raised {{above the ground}} and vegetation, and unlike most snakes, visually locks onto its prey's position before capture. Following capture, the snake swallows its prey alive. It has strong jaws with rows of small, <b>inward</b> <b>slanting</b> teeth. It has sometimes been observed to beat its prey against the ground in an apparent effort to stun it prior to swallowing. Prey items include birds, large insects, lizards, other snakes, and small mammals.|$|R
50|$|AJ-60A {{is a solid}} fueled rocket burning HTPB. The casing is {{composed}} of a graphite epoxy composite, and the engine throat and nozzle are made of carbon-phenolic composite. As configured for use on Atlas V, the nozzle is fixed at a 3 degree cant away from the attachment point, but Aerojet offers a variant with thrust vectoring capability. The Atlas V configuration also features an <b>inward</b> <b>slanting</b> nosecone, but it is available with a conventional nosecone {{or none at all}} for use on other rockets. AJ-60A is the largest monolithic solid rocket motor currently in production. The stages are designed to be transported by truck.|$|R

5000|$|A {{site for}} the {{dwelling}} was secured by digging a drift into the steep hillside and piling the excavated earth and stone out in front until a terrace {{large enough to accommodate}} the projected house had been provided. The floor area was scooped out to shallow saucer shape—in this case 9 m. in diameter—and coated with mud. At the margins, the mud curved upward to end against the half-buried foot logs which were the basal course of the wall. The walls were composed of horizontal wood and mud masonry. They rose with an <b>inward</b> <b>slant</b> to a little better than head height, then were cribbed for a distance to reduce the diameter of the flat portion of the roof, which was of clay supported by parallel poles, The arc of stones was a retaining device placed to hold back the ever-growing accumulation of refuse that was dumped at the brink of the terrace.|$|R
40|$|Studies of craniofacial dysmorphology in schizophrenia, {{carried out}} since the 1960 s, have {{reported}} minor physical anomalies {{in those with}} schizophrenia, prominently in the craniofacial region. Indirect methods, most notably 3 D laser imaging, have been used previously for investigating craniofacial dysmorphology in schizophrenia. This project aimed to investigate {{the ability of a}} stereophotogrammetry system to detect craniofacial dysmorphology in individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia. Furthermore, observed dysmorphology was characterised and compared with that found in previous studies. Three-dimensional craniofacial landmark coordinates were obtained from images collected using a bespoke design stereophotogrammetry system. The system includes a camera rig and a calibration rig. On the camera rig is mounted three digital single-lens reflex cameras hardwired to a trigger for simultaneous image capture. The calibration rig consists of a frame with strategically positioned retro-reflective calibration markers of known 3 D orientation. The precision and reliability of the stereophotogrammetry system was tested using a human subject. Measurements were taken using the system and directly using callipers by two operators on two separate occasions. Intra- and inter-operator precision and inter-modality reliability were calculated and scored. All intra- and inter-operator precision scores were at least below a 7 % error, and considered "good". Inter -modality reliability scores had at least a "good" score in 72 % of all measurements. Excluding one soft landmark and one landmark with small measurement value, all inter-modality reliability scores were at least "good". The study cohort consisted of 17 African (8 control, 9 schizophrenia) and 13 Caucasian (8 control, 5 schizophrenia) males. A set of 18 landmarks focused about the eyes, nose, mouth and chin was identified for each subject and collated in 3 D coordinate space. Geometric morphometric analysis - particularly generalised Procrustes analysis and principal component analysis - was carried out on these landmark sets. Discriminant Function Analysis was applied to identify discriminating features in the data set, and classification techniques, aided by feature selection, were applied to separate affected and control subjects. In the African cohort, the results showed wider <b>inward</b> <b>slanting</b> (cat-like) eyes, a wider upturned nose and narrower downturned mouth. In the Caucasian cohort, narrower and wide set eyes, a narrower downturned nose with anteriorly displaced alare, a wider downturned mouth and posteriorly set chin were shown. The Caucasian cohort demonstrates similar dysmorphology as described in the literature. Published data for the African cohort is lacking. The nearest mean and k- nearest neighbour classifiers had the highest accuracy in the African and Caucasian groups respectively, with 71 % and 77 % correct classification. The efficacy of the stereophotogrammetry system introduced in this study has been shown, with craniofacial dysmorphology in schizophrenia successfully detected. Further studies with larger cohorts are recommended to attempt improved classification accuracy, but a platform now exists to pursue dysmorphology studies in other psychoses, such as bipolar disorder...|$|R
