25|$|Cline's privately {{published}} work Hope for high risk and rage filled children also cites family therapist and hypnotherapist Milton Erickson as a source, and reprints {{parts of a}} case of Erickson's published in 1961.

Erickson advised the mother to sit on the child {{for hours at a time}} and to feed him only on cold oatmeal while <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> daughter ate appetizing food. The child did increase in compliance, and Erickson noted, with apparent approval, that he trembled when his mother looked at him. Cline commented, with respect to this and other cases, that in his opinion all bonds were trauma bonds. According to Cline, it illustrates the three essential components of 1) taking control, 2) the child's expression of rage; and, 3) relaxation and the development of bonding.|$|E
