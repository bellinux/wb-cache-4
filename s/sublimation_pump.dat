40|$|A high {{pumping speed}} is {{required}} in neutral beam injectors to minimise re-ionisation of the neutral beams. The neutral beam injectors on MAST use titanium <b>sublimation</b> <b>pumps.</b> These pumps {{do not have a}} constant pumping speed; their pumping speed depends on the gettering surface history and on both the integrated and applied gas load. In this paper we report a method of maintaining a constant pumping speed,through different evaporation schemes, suitable for operations of the MAST beamline for both short and relatively long beam pulses by measurement of the pressure in the beamline. In addition the MCNP code is then used to calculate the gas profile in the beamline by adjusting the input pumping speed to match the measured pressure. This allows the resulting gas profile to be used for calculation of the re-ionisation levels and an example is given. Comment: 24 pages, 13 figure...|$|R

To interpret this data we use quantum mechanical based reactive force fields to simulate the HV impact of various molecular species and ice clathrates on oxidized titanium surfaces mimicking those in Cassini’s neutral and ion mass spectrometer (INMS). The predicted velocity dependent fragmentation patterns and composition mixing ratios agree with INMS data providing the means for identifying the molecules in the plume. We used our simulations to predict the surface damage from the HV impacts on the INMS interior walls, which we suggest acts as a titanium <b>sublimation</b> <b>pump</b> that could alter the instrument’s readings. These results show how the theory can identify chemical events from hypervelocity impacts in space plumes and atmospheres, providing in turn clues to the internal structure of the corresponding sources (e. g., Enceladus).

40|$|The Low Energy Ring of the PEP-II B-factory {{operates}} with {{extremely high}} currents of short positron bunches. Any discontinuity in the vacuum chamber can excite a broad-band spectrum of high order modes (HOM). A temperature rise {{has been found}} in the vacuum chamber elements in one junction of straight and arc chambers. The power in the wake fields was high enough to char beyond use the feed-through for the titanium <b>sublimation</b> <b>pump</b> (TSP). This pumping section is 5. 5 m long and consists of the beam chamber and an ante-chamber. Electromagnetic fields, excited in the beam chamber penetrate to the ante-chamber and then through the heater feedthrough come out. To be sure that these electromagnetic fields are present a small ceramic tile with a high loss tangent was placed near the TSP feed-through outside of the pumping chamber. A thermocouple that was attached to this tile showed a strong temperature rise. A short wire antenna was also placed there. The antenna was connected directly to a spectrum analyzer. Measurements show a wide frequency HOM spectrum with a maximum in the 2 - 3 GHz region. Based on these measurements a special water cooled HOM absorber was designed and installed in the vacuum chamber. As a result, the HOM power in the section decreased and the temperature rise went down. The power loss in the absorber reaches 1200 W for a positron beam current of 2. 4 A.

40|$|The sample holders for the MSL- 1 {{mission of}} TEMPUS were developed, {{manufactured}} and {{tested in the}} framework of this Experiment Support Project. Three sample holder types for the different experiment classed were developed: sample holders with a horizontal slit for the radial observation of strongly evaporating samples, sample holders with crossed slits for the observation of the nucleation front motion and cage sample holders for weakly evaporating samples for which a good radial observation was of special importance. In a prototype test program sample holders were build from different materials. Tests were performed with these prototypes, e. g. thermal shock tests with liquid sample materials at temperatures of up to 2000 C, vibration tests and tests of the coupling of the sample holders to the RF fields of the leviation coils. As a result, silicon nitride was selected as the material for the flight sample holders. After the Design Review sample holders were custom made for each of the flight experiments.

40|$|SPEAR 3, a {{synchrotron}} radiation source at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, {{has been in}} operation {{for the past two}} years. SPEAR 3 was designed to achieve high beam lifetimes while operating at a higher current level than previously achieved with SPEAR 2. Maintaining high electron beam lifetimes within the ring allows users to perform their experiments with a consistent supply of high current {{synchrotron radiation}}. The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the SPEAR 3 vacuum system's performance during the 2004 and 2005 runs while considering methods to optimize and improve vacuum system conditioning, especially within the pumping system, so that a recommended plan of action can be created for the FY 2006 run. Monitoring the dynamics of the electron beam within the ring can be a difficult task. Pressure data obtained from the gages attached to pumps, temperature data obtained from thermocouples located at various locations around the ring, and beam lifetime projections help to provide some indication of the health of the electron beam, but the true conditions within the beam chamber can only be extrapolated. Data collected from sensors (gauges, thermocouples, etc.) located around the ring can be viewed and extracted from a program created at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) called Historyplot. Manipulation and analysis of data was performed with the commercially available programs Matlab and Excel. The data showed that the beam lifetimes in 2005 were much greater than they were in 2004, but it did not provide a clear indication as to why this occurred. One variable of major importance between the 2004 and 2005 runs is the Titanium <b>Sublimation</b> <b>Pump</b> (TSP) flash frequency (flashing is the process in which Titanium from filaments within the pump is sublimated onto the wall surfaces of the pump, where it removes gas molecules from the system by chemisorption). The data indicated that pressures in 2005 could have been lower, based on a comparison between 2004 pressures, if the TSPs were flashed more frequently than they were in 2005. However, the data from 2004 and 2005 does not provide enough information to accurately determine an optimal conditioning frequency, though it does provide enough information to formulate a recommended plan of action for the next run. It appears that flashing at a high rate during the beginning of a run and at a lower rate as the run progresses may be the most effective pumping approach to further improve the vacuum level of the ring. It is recommended that the SPEAR 3 vacuum system should be operated in this way next year...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} the present {{status of the}} PEP-II project. The project comprises four major systems: Injector, High-Energy Ring (HER), Low-Energy Ring (LER), and Interaction Region (IR). We focus in detail {{on the design of}} the LER, as its parameters and requirements are most closely related to those required for the Beijing Tau-Charm Factory rings. The PEP-II LER is a high-current, 3. 1 -GeV positron ring mounted above the 9 -GeV HER. The LER uses a wiggler located in one of its six straight sections to provide emittance control and additional damping. We {{describe the}} rather complicated IR, which must transport the LER beam into the plane of the HER, focus it to a common beam size, and separate the beams after the head-on collisions. Both permanent magnet and conventional electromagnets are used in this area. The LER lattice has now adopted a simplified non-interleaved sextupole correction scheme that has reduced the required number of sextupoles substantially. We describe the LER vacuum system, one of the most challenging subsystems in PEP-II. It employs several technologies. In the arcs, aluminum extrusions and titanium <b>sublimation</b> <b>pumps</b> are employed; the straight sections use stainless steel chambers with lumped ion pumps. In the wiggler area, an extended copper photon dump with nonevaporable getter (NEG) pumps is employed to handle the very large synchrotron radiation power. The design of the room-temperature RF system, the bunch-by-bunch longitudinal and transverse feedback systems, and some of the special diagnostics will be described briefly.

40|$|In {{the frame}} of the SIS 18 upgrade an intense {{research}} activity started in 2005 for the production and characterisation of Ti-Zr-V coated vacuum chambers. Three new dedicated magnetron sputtering facilities were designed and commissioned to perform the coating on dipole, quadrupole and short straight chambers [1, 2]. The surface chemical composition and the activation behaviour of the produced thin films were studied at Cern by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). The H 2 and CO pumping speed were investigated at GSI by transmission measurement and by means of a Fischer-Mommsen dome [3]. Before proceeding to the installation of the NEG coated chambers in the accelerator, an additional study was performed to analyse the pressure evolution during bakeout and activation. For this purpose an experimental system equivalent to a SIS 18 vacuum sector was built in the vacuum laboratory. The set-up (see Fig. 1) consists of two pumping units, both equipped with two sputter ion pumps (IP) and two Ti <b>sublimation</b> <b>pumps</b> (TSP), a residual gas analyser and two gauges, mounted at the extremities of a coated SIS dipole chamber. A turbo molecular pump (TMP) is connected through a gate-valve to the system, and is valved-off {{at the end of the}} heating cycle, which follows the one typically used for the SIS 18. After the bakeout of the uncoated parts of the system at 220 °C for 157 hours, the temperature of the dipole chamber is raised from 120 °C to 210 °C, and kept at that temperature for 24 hours to perform the NEG activation. The pressures recorded before and after the heating cycle were respectively 6. 1 x 10 - 8 mbar and 5. 3 x 10 - 12 mbar in the first pumping unit and 1. 4 x 10 - 7 and 6. 3 x 10 - 12 mbar in the second pumping unit...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{interactions}} of energetic particles with solid surfaces lead to the emission of particles such as electrons and target atoms from the target surface. This is usually referred to as the secondary particle emissions. One of the fundamental observations of this phenomenon is the measurement of the secondary particle emission yield, γ, defined as the average number of particles emitted per the incoming particle. There are a lot of experimental as well as theoretical studies on the secondary electron emission yields induced by ion impact on the metal surfaces. Therefore, the relevant mechanisms have been understood reasonably well. However, investigations on the secondary ton emission yields have still been limited. 　　Furthermore, only a few attempts have been made so far in understanding phenomena under ton impact on the non-metallic surfaces though alkali-halides have been investigated in some details. Therefore, we do not have sufficient understanding in the interaction mechanisms between ions and non-metallic surfaces. 　　The {{purpose of the present study}} is to reveal any difference in the interactions of tons with metal and non-metallic surfaces. Such studies are of great importance not only in basic physics but also in applied fields such as very-large-scale-integrated-circuits (VLSI) technology, fusion plasmas, surface analysis etc. 　　In the present study, the secondary electron emission yields, γ-, and the secondary positive ion emission yields, γ+, from some non-metallic surfaces induced by low energy ton (0. 3 〜 100 keV H+, 2. 5 keV H 2 + and 2. 5 〜 150 keV Ar+) impact have been measured using a cylindrical double-wall cup under an ultra high vacuum chamber (〜 10 - 11 Torr) pumped down with the combination of a turbo molecular pump, an ion pump and a titanium <b>sublimation</b> <b>pump</b> with a liquid nitrogen trap. In order to clean the target surfaces they were sputtered with argon ions and also heated with a ceramic heater placed behind the target. An Auger electron spectrometer has been used in order to check the surface cleanness. 　　It has been found that the observed γ- from the non-metallic surfaces is proportional to the electronic stopping power over the collision energy range investigated. It is noted that similar relations are well known in metal targets. However, the proportional coefficients in γ- are 2 - 3 times larger than those for metal targets. These results also agree with tendencies for oxygen-covered metal surfaces observed in the present experiment which show that γ- increases as the oxygen coverage increases. We have also observed, for the first time, an interesting phenomenon where the observed γ- strongly depends on the incident ion beam flux and becomes zero above a critical ion flux for SrCeO 3 target. 　　Similarly, we have found that the observed γ+, which has been found to be independent of the incident ion flux investigated, is larger than the results calculated with the TRIM code. It has been found from TRIM code calculations, however, that a significant part of the observed γ+ in proton and hydrogen molecular ion impact are due to the secondary electrons emitted from the wall of the inner cup under impact of the neutral primary particles backscattered from the target surfaces. Nevertheless the observed γ+ from non-metallic targets under argon ion impact is far large, compared with the calculated results. Then it has been found that γ+ induced by argon ion impact on SrCeO 3 is proportional not to the nuclear stopping power, but to the electronic stopping power. This result shows that a greater part of these secondary tons are not emitted by physical sputtering. The observed γ+ in 2. 5 keV argon ion impact seems to be in reasonable agreement with that extrapolated from the data available which is believed to be due to the Coulomb explosion on the non-metallic surfaces. Furthermore, in order to identify the mass and energy of the secondary positive ions emitted from targets, two different techniques have been used: One was a collector method using graphite and beryllium sheets which were analyzed with Rutherford backscattering technique using 1. 8 MeV helium ions. Another was the mass and energy analysis with a quadrupole mass spectrometer attached with four meshes, to which the retarding voltage was applied for kinetic energy selection. 　　Both experiments confirm that target elements are emitted as tons (as well as neutrals) by the incident ion impact. Furthermore, the second experiment shows that these emitted tons have large kinetic energy, comparable to the incident ton energy. Such large kinetic energy can be qualitatively understood to be provided probably by the electrostatic potential caused by local charge-accumulation of the incident ions on the non-metallic surfaces due to their high resistivities. This phenomenon can also explain how the observed γ- depends on the incident ion beam fluxes because some fractions of the electrons produced in the target are not able to overcome the Coulomb barrier generated by accumulation of the incident ion charge and cannot be liberated into vacuum. 　　It is concluded from the present work that the key mechanisms responsible in the secondary particle emissions from the non-metallic surfaces are very different from those in metal targets induced by the energetic ton impact...|$|E
5000|$|The first ion pump {{was invented}} by Varian Associates, now Agilent. The {{original}} activity of Varian, co-founded in 1948 by Russell Varian, {{the inventor of the}} Klystron, and his brother Sigurd, was in the field of microwave electron tubes. Robert Jepsen joined the company in 1951 and soon became director of the Klystron research group. His investigation about electronic vacuum pumping led in 1957 to the realization of the first sputter ion pump (SIP), later named VacIon pump, of which he was co-inventor.The pump was developed as an appendage pump for maintaining Ultra High Vacuum (UHV) in microwave power tubes after processing, but soon after honeycomb-shaped anodes and commercial VacIon pumps with speeds of thousands of liters per second were produced. Lewis Hall and John Helmer were members of the research team, involved in the choice of the most suitable cathode material and in the optimization of the ion pump design. Sherm Rutherford joined Varian in February 1959 in the Central Research Department (which, soon after, spun off the Vacuum Division). His activity, working for Robert Jepsen, was to study the behavior of the sputter ion pump (in terms of pumping speed and discharge intensity I/P) over a wide range of parameters, such as magnetic field, voltage, anode cell diameter, anode cell length and pressure. Renn Zaphiropoulos joined the Vacuum Division in 1959 and was engaged in scaling up the ion pump from the original appendage pump to a full range of large pumps up to 5000 l/s [...] His group worked on high voltage feedthroughs, magnets, control units, systems, flanges, valves, sorption <b>pumps</b> and Titanium <b>Sublimation</b> <b>Pumps</b> (TSP). In 1960 the “slotted” titanium cathode, named “Super VacIon Pump”, was introduced on the basis of observations about noble gas pumping mechanism and unstable Argon pumping phenomena. In the same years triode pumps were invented by W.M. Brubaker (Consolidated Electrodynamics Corporation) and Varian, now Agilent, began to sell them in the late ‘60s under the name “Noble Ion Pumps”, then changed the name to “Triode Ion Pumps” in the early ‘70s.|$|R

40|$|The ERL Vacuum {{systems are}} {{depicted}} in a figure. ERL has eight vacuum volumes with various sets of requirements. A summary of vacuum related requirements {{is provided in}} a table. Five of the eight volumes comprise the electron beamline. They are the 5 -cell Superconducting RF Cavity, Superconducting e-gun, injection, loop and beam dump. Two vacuum regions are the individual cryostats insulating the 5 -cell Superconducting RF Cavity and the Superconducting e-gun structures. The last ERL vacuum volume not shown in the schematic is the laser transport line. The beamline vacuum regions are separated by electropneumatic gate valves. The beam dump is common with loop beamline but is considered a separate volume due to geometry and requirements. Vacuum in the 5 -cell SRF cavity is maintained in the {approx} 10 {sup - 9 } torr range at room temperature by two 20 l/s ion pumps and in the e-gun SRF cavity by one 60 l/s ion pump. Vacuum in the SRF cavities operated at 2 {sup o}K is reduced to low 10 {sup - 11 } torr via cryopumping of the cavity walls. The cathode of the e-gun must be protected from poisoning, which can occur if vacuum adjacent to the e-gun in the injection line exceeds 10 - 11 torr range in the injection warm beamline near the e-gun exit. The vacuum requirements for beam operation in the loop and beam dump are 10 - 9 torr range. The beamlines are evacuated from atmospheric pressure to high vacuum level with a particulate free, oil free turbomolecular pumping cart. 25 l/s shielded ion pumps distributed throughout the beamlines maintain the vacuum requirement. Due to the more demanding vacuum requirement of the injection beamline proximate to the e-gun, a vacuum bakeout of the injection beamline is required. In addition, two 200 l/s diode ion pumps and supplemental pumping provided by titanium <b>sublimation</b> <b>pumps</b> are installed in the injection line just beyond the exit of the e-gun. Due to expected gas load a similar pumping arrangement is planned for the beam dump. The cryostat vacuum thermally insulating the SRF cavities need only reduce the convective heat load such that heat loss is primarily radiation through several layers of multi-layer insulation and conductive end-losses which are contained by 5 {sup o}K thermal transitions. Prior to cool down rough vacuum {approx} 10 {sup - 5 } torr range is established and maintained by a dedicated turbomolecular pump station. Cryopumping by the cold mass and heat shields reduces the insulating vacuum to 10 {sup - 7 } torr range after cool down...|$|R
