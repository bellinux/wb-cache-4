5|$|In November 1861, the self-appointed {{members of}} the Confederate <b>state</b> <b>sovereignty</b> {{convention}} in Russellville, Kentucky appointed Hawes state auditor of the Commonwealth's Confederate government, but he declined {{in order to continue}} his military service. However, he wrote President Davis on January 25, 1862 to inform him that he was traveling to Bowling Green, Kentucky at Confederate Governor George W. Johnson's request in order to assist Johnson in administering the state government. He resigned his military commission two days later, but his departure for Bowling Green was delayed when he was stricken with typhoid fever.|$|E
5|$|Throughout its history, the {{coverage}} formula remained controversial because it singled out certain jurisdictions, {{most of which}} were in the Deep South. In Shelby County v. Holder (2013), the Supreme Court declared {{the coverage}} formula unconstitutional because the criteria used were outdated and thus violated principles of equal <b>state</b> <b>sovereignty</b> and federalism. The other special provisions that are dependent on the coverage formula, such as the Section 5 preclearance requirement, remain valid law. However, without a valid coverage formula, these provisions are unenforceable.|$|E
5|$|She {{identifies}} the UN as the book's villain and criticizes the UN's practise of moral equivalency that treats both sides equally even though {{one side is}} clearly dominant and brutally oppressive. It results in the requirement of its personnel to remain neutral but Off questions how a peacekeeper can remain neutral while watching people being killed. The book treats this as a reality of international relations, which places precedence on <b>state</b> <b>sovereignty</b> over human rights, and a factor in making the UN slow, ineffectual, and inappropriately bureaucratic. She notes that some peacekeepers cope by demonizing all sides which helps diminish the sense of impotence in being unable to intervene.|$|E

5|$|When Belarus became {{independent}} from the Soviet Union in 1991, the Supreme Soviet of Belarus passed the Declaration of <b>State</b> <b>Sovereignty</b> of the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic, proclaiming Byelorussian SSR acts legal priority over USSR ones (per article 7 of the Declaration, but this provision was inserted into 1978 Constitution only in August 1991) and formally starting a constitutional process in Republic. Soon afterwards, the government established a Constitution Commission {{to facilitate the}} adoption of a post-Soviet constitution. In November 1991, the commission sent the first of three drafts to the Supreme Soviet. Upon approval from the Supreme Soviet, the first draft was published in December 1991 in order for the Belarusian populace to make comments and suggestions. The commission submitted the third and final draft to the Supreme Soviet, where it was signed on March 15, 1994 by the Speaker of the Supreme Soviet and Head of State, Myechyslaw Hryb. The gazette Zvezda officially published the Constitution fifteen days later. The Supreme Soviet passed a second law along with the Constitution, titled the Enactment Law, rendering the 1978 Byelorussian SSR Constitution and the Declaration of <b>State</b> <b>Sovereignty</b> of the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic void, with a few exceptions. The law, passed during the thirteenth session of the Supreme Soviet, also provided transitional phases for office holders and government organs to form within two years. Every year since 1994, March 15 has been commemorated in Belarus as Constitution Day, a national holiday.|$|E
5|$|In {{clear and}} {{forceful}} language Floyd reasserted the <b>state</b> <b>sovereignty</b> theory of government, as {{guaranteed by the}} 'Compact or Constitution,' holding the Federal Government to be merely the 'Agent of the States' entrusted only with such powers as were originally intended to operate 'externally' and 'upon nations foreign to those composing the Confederacy.' He {{called attention to the}} disregard with which 'an unrestrained majority' had received the memorials and protests of some of the 'sovereign states,' justifying their acts by precedent and expediency and thus melting away 'the solder of the Federal chain;' also {{to the fact that it}} was then 'strongly insinuated' that the states could not 'interpose to arrest an unconstitutional measure.' Such a course, he was certain, could result only in nullifying the federal constitution and in a complete failure in our experiment in government.|$|E
5|$|Illinois Senator Lyman Trumbull, {{leader of}} the Moderate Republicans and Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, was anxious to reach an {{understanding}} with the President. He ushered through Congress a bill extending the Freedmen's Bureau beyond its scheduled abolition in 1867, and the first Civil Rights Bill, to grant citizenship to the freedmen. Trumbull met several times with Johnson, and was convinced the President would sign the measures (Johnson rarely contradicted visitors, often fooling those who met with him into thinking he was in accord). In fact, the President opposed both bills as infringements on <b>state</b> <b>sovereignty.</b> Additionally, both of Trumbull's bills were unpopular among white Southerners, whom Johnson hoped to include in his new party. Johnson vetoed the Freedman's Bureau bill on February 18, 1866, {{to the delight of}} white Southerners and the puzzled anger of Republican legislators. He considered himself vindicated when a move to override his veto failed in the Senate the following day. Johnson believed that the Radicals would now be isolated and defeated, and that the Moderate Republicans would form behind him; he did not understand that Moderates too wanted to see African Americans treated fairly.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims {{to give a}} new {{perspective}} on the issue of sovereignty in the European context. In this context, we argue that the EU can contribute to increase Member <b>States</b> <b>sovereignty.</b> Many academic circles have advocated that the EU limits <b>State’s</b> <b>sovereignty.</b> This is why we intend to present a new approach to sovereignty in the European context. In order to present our argument we will discuss and debate the concept of sovereignty, both in the internal and external dimensions, which are associated with the concept of power. Then we will check if European states have the necessary means that enables them to project their power. We’ll also argue that there are real limitations, in current capabilities, and in resources availability needed to develop them in the future. We’ll also present the concept of politics of scale, arguing that we can apply this concept to develop state’s capabilities, which allow the necessary power projection, which enhances <b>state’s</b> <b>sovereignty.</b> This found that pooling and sharing will increase EU member <b>states</b> <b>sovereignty,</b> since it will allow a greater ability to project power, which is essential to support the external dimension of sovereignty. Thus, through a process of sharing and pooling member states will have the ability to defend their interests on a global scale, a level of intervention that will be denied if they choose to pursue individually. We also conclude that the current economic crisis may be used has a catalyst to deepen these mechanisms...|$|R
5|$|The {{first major}} congressional debate in which Rowan participated {{was over the}} {{election}} of William McCreery as representative from Baltimore, Maryland. Joshua Barney, McCreery's opponent in the election, claimed that McCreery did not meet a requirement in the Maryland Constitution that a representative live in the district from which he was elected for twelve {{months prior to the}} election. McCreery admitted that he had moved from Baltimore to the country prior to the election but claimed that he still owned his home in Baltimore and lived there during the winter months. A resolution was introduced to declare McCreery the duly elected representative from Baltimore, and an amendment was added to clarify that the grounds upon which the resolution was based were that McCreery had not abandoned his Baltimore home. Despite his support for states' rights, Rowan opposed the amendment because he felt that <b>state</b> <b>sovereignty</b> was only made possible by national sovereignty and that the national legislature had the right to declare a state law unconstitutional. By giving another reason for declaring McCreery duly elected, Rowan felt this issue would be obscured. The amendment was defeated by a vote of 92–8, and the resolution to declare McCreery duly elected passed 89–18.|$|E
25|$|In September 2001 the Canadian {{government}} {{established an}} ad-hoc committee {{to address this}} balance between <b>State</b> <b>sovereignty</b> and humanitarian intervention. The International Commission on Intervention and <b>State</b> <b>Sovereignty</b> published its final report in 2001, which focused not {{on the right of}} states to intervene but on a responsibility to protect populations at risk. The report moved beyond the question of military intervention, arguing that a range of diplomatic and humanitarian actions could also be utilized to protect civilian populations.|$|E

40|$|Sovereignty is not {{a neutral}} concept. It is rather used as a tool {{in a variety of}} {{contexts}} by political agents to establish and maintain their rule. In particular situations of competition and interdependence are relevant because they potentially threaten state survival. In these two types of situation, five uses of sovereignty are distinguished. First, in situations of internal competition <b>states</b> use <b>sovereignty</b> for competitive advantage. Second, in cases of external competition <b>states</b> use <b>sovereignty</b> to temporarily subordinate the interests of citizens to those of the state. Third, in situations of interdependence some <b>states</b> use <b>sovereignty</b> to reduce it. However, in a globalizing world this becomes less feasible. Fourth, sovereignty is used to conquer interdependence. Yet this is only effective when a world-state is created. Fifth, <b>states</b> use <b>sovereignty</b> to manage interdependence...|$|R

25|$|One {{aspect of}} the American system of {{government}} is that, {{while the rest of}} the world now views the United States as one country, domestically American constitutional law recognizes a federation of state governments separate from (and not subdivisions of) the federal government, each of which is sovereign over its own affairs. Sometimes, the Supreme Court has even analogized the States to being foreign countries to each other to explain the American system of <b>State</b> <b>sovereignty.</b>|$|E
