5|$|The {{interior}} of Romney's House was redesigned by 6a architects in 2012. The Assembly Room {{was divided into}} two bedrooms, divided by a curving full height partition, and a <b>staircase</b> <b>tower</b> was added to unite the different levels of the house.|$|E

25|$|The , {{dating from}} the 16th century, has a {{remarkable}} <b>staircase</b> <b>tower.</b> The Maison Dupré-Latour is a former mansion that was built by the Genas family, traders enriched by the salt trade. In 1760, the building was bought by François Dupré-Latour whose name would remain attached to the building and whose descendants continue to live there. In 1993, the building {{was transferred to the}} city and has been classified as an historical monument since 1927.|$|E
50|$|Since the Renaissance period, <b>staircase</b> <b>towers</b> were {{markedly}} more decorative {{and representative}} of status. Stairs were now rarely hidden or built externally, {{but there were}} both artistically designed, curved and straight-running staircases inside the building with ornate ceilings and railings (e. g. Château de Chambord, Palazzo Barberini and Château d'Azay-le-Rideau or Château de Chenonceau). With the increasing construction of straight staircases with intermediate landings (the modern stairwells) separate <b>staircase</b> <b>towers</b> became gradually rarer.|$|R
50|$|Only a few {{examples}} of <b>staircase</b> <b>towers</b> have survived from ancient times (e.g. on the Imperial Baths in Trier); staircases were often superfluous on the only single-storey buildings or were built into the outer walls of buildings that were often several feet thick. This tradition continued in the keeps (donjons), churches and castles of the early and high Middle Ages; and this situation only changed with the increasing construction of purpose-built and generally rather undecorated <b>staircase</b> <b>towers</b> of the High and Late Middle Ages (Romanesque and Gothic architecture styles).|$|R
50|$|The {{northern}} façade of {{the inner}} courtyard is framed by two <b>staircase</b> <b>towers.</b> The southern façade consists of a late Gothic arcade, the columns of which have unusual spiral-like riffles.|$|R
25|$|In {{the fifteenth}} century, pilgrimages to and flourishing trade {{relations}} with the Near East exposed the Low Countries of northwest Europe {{to the use of}} bulbous domes in the architecture of the Orient. Although the first expressions of their European use are in the backgrounds of paintings, architectural uses followed. The Dome of the Rock and its bulbous dome being so prominent in Jerusalem, such domes apparently became associated by visitors with the city itself. In Bruges, The , designed to symbolize the Holy Sepulchre, was finished with a Gothic church tower capped by a bulbous cupola on a hexagonal shaft in 1428. Sometime between 1466 and 1500, a tower added to the Chapel of the Precious Blood was covered by a bulbous cupola very similar to Syrian minarets. Likewise, in Ghent, an octagonal <b>staircase</b> <b>tower</b> for the Church of St. Martin d'Ackerghem, built {{in the beginning of the}} sixteenth century, has a bulbous cupola like a minaret. These cupolas were made of wood covered with copper, as were the examples over turrets and towers in the Netherlands at the end of the fifteenth century, many of which have been lost. The earliest example from the Netherlands that has survived is the bulbous cupola built in 1511 over the town hall of Middelburg. Multi-story spires with truncated bulbous cupolas supporting smaller cupolas or crowns became popular in the following decades.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} part of the century, one of the exponents who {{developed}} the style further was Edwin Lutyens (1864–1944). [...] At The Deanery in Berkshire, 1899, (right), where the client was the editor of the influential magazine Country Life, details like the openwork brick balustrade, the many-paned oriel window and facetted <b>staircase</b> <b>tower,</b> the shadowed windows under the eaves, or the prominent clustered chimneys were conventional Tudor revival borrowings, some of which Lutyens was to remake in his own style, that already predominates in the dark recessed entryway, the confident massing, and his signature semi-circular terrace steps. This is Tudorbethan at its best, free in ground plan, stripped of cuteness, yet warmly vernacular in effect, familiar though new, eminently liveable. An example of Tudorbethan architecture was that seen at Greaves Hall, which was built in 1900 as a mansion house for the Scarisbrick family. [...] Many of the features of the original building could still be seen until it was demolished in 2009.|$|E
6000|$|At {{the bottom}} of the hill, close to Otterbourne Church, the gravel has given place to clay. On the side of the hill, a rough hedge divides the private ground of the copse from Otterbourne Common and Hill, which is crossed by the old high road from London to Southampton, the very steep hill having had a cutting made through it. The Cranbury side of the road has the village cricket ground on it, though burrowed under by the {{concentric}} brick-work circles of the Southampton Company's water works, which are entered by a little <b>staircase</b> <b>tower,</b> cemented over so as to be rather ornamental than otherwise. Beside it, there is a beautiful view of a delightful home landscape; stretching out on the south lie woods and low hills to the gleam of Southampton Water, the smoke of the steamers, and even the gray hills of the Isle of Wight. On the other side, beyond the rich water meadows of the Itchen valley, may be seen the woods of Colden Common rising into Concord Hill, and beyond them the view is closed by the broken outline of Longwood Warren. While more to the north there is visible the round smooth outline of [...] "the beech-crowned steep" [...] of St. Catherine's Hill. It is a charming prospect, especially on a day of sunshine and clouds, making shadows chase one another over the distance. Nor, except for a white thatched cottage and an extensive gravel-pit by the road, have the native charms of the hill been much disturbed; and gorse, heather, and honeysuckle flourish till, where the clay begins, there is a grassy slope bearing a few elms and horse-chestnuts. Perhaps loaded waggons drop some of their seeds, for on those cuttings through the gravel on the road- side have sprung up the dainty little yellow stonecrop, Sedum acre, and the Stork's bill, Erodium moschatum. These are plentifully spread over the cutting; but the Trifolium arvense, which came for a few years, seems to have vanished again.|$|E

25|$|The lower {{octagonal}} {{tower was}} built in the 16th Century. It has eight, round arch windows. Two hexagonal <b>staircase</b> <b>towers</b> are built outside the tower near the northeast and southeast windows. The small towers are completely self-supporting.|$|R
50|$|In {{the main}} castle, two <b>staircase</b> <b>towers</b> were added {{as well as}} {{numerous}} complicated alterations to make the Trauchburg into representative seat of territorial lordship and government.

5000|$|Noticeable in the {{courtyard}} is the historic <b>staircase</b> <b>tower.</b> While most buildings in the grounds {{date back to the}} renaissance castle, the <b>staircase</b> <b>tower</b> is marked by recent rebuilding.

During the 15th century, a hexagonal <b>staircase</b> <b>towers</b> was attached which asloserved the other buildings.

50|$|The {{hall of the}} ashlar {{building}} is 45 metres long and 26 metres wide and has an irregular, pentagonal chancel in which the old vestry with its inflexed arch windows and door is located. The three aisles are the same height. Chancel and nave have high two-storey, four-panelled round arch windows with tracery and a rich profile. In the cornice beneath the eaves, Renaissance figures are visible. The high gable roof has numerous dormers, grouped in a triangle. The onion dome of the west tower, which is flanked by two <b>staircase</b> <b>towers,</b> dates to 1616. The lavishly decorated portal at the west end dates to the period before the great fire and has an ordered ogee arch and Verstabungen.|$|R
50|$|The {{elevated}} entrance {{was usually}} reached {{on a wooden}} or stone staircase or from a footbridge from {{another part of the}} building. Immediately in front of the entrance there was usually a wooden platform; on particularly long stairways there could be intermediate landings. A steep stairway and narrow landing in front of the entrance made it difficult for attackers to use heavy demolition equipment such as battering rams. Below the entranceway the corbels or putlog holes have often survived. Even the fixtures of the original wooden stairways are frequently still visible. In several cases, elevated entranceways built in the Late Middle Ages or Early Modern times were accessed by <b>staircase</b> <b>towers</b> with spiral <b>staircases.</b>|$|R
