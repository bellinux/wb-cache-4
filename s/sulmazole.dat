40|$|In the {{guinea-pig}} superior cervical ganglion, the Gi blocking agent <b>sulmazole</b> {{enhanced the}} basal and prostaglandin E 2 -induced stimulation of cyclic AMP synthesis {{but had no}} effect on the prostaglandin-dependent inhibition of acetylcholine release. On the contrary <b>sulmazole</b> counteracted the inhibitory effect of D-Ala 2 -Met-enkephalinamide both on cyclic AMP formation and acetylcholine release. Moreover <b>sulmazole</b> eliminated the supra-additive effect of the combination of prostaglandin + opiate on cyclic AMP synthesis. The presence of a Gi-coupled opiate receptor at the pre-and postsynaptic levels is suggeste...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} the new {{cardiotonic}} agent <b>sulmazole</b> on the guanine nucleotide regulatory protein-adenylate cyclase system was studied in rat adipocyte membranes. The inotrope enhanced basal adenylate cyclase activity by 46 %. This stimulation oc-cuffed only at GTP concentrations (5 M) sufficient to activate G. This stimulatory effect of <b>sulmazole</b> was abolished after functional inactivation of G,, either by pertussis toxin or by using 1 0 nM GTP in the assay mixture, suggesting an important role of an active G in this process. Similarly, <b>sulmazole</b> enhanced isoproterenol-, forskolin-, and fluoride-stimulated adenylate cy-clase activity by 33, 34, and 45 %, respectively. However, when these latter experiments were performed after inactivation of G, <b>sulmazole</b> actually inhibited by- 25 % adenylate cyclase activity stimulated by 1 and 1 0 M isoproterenol. Under similar treatment conditions, enhancement of forskolin- and fluoride-stimulate...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} various {{old and new}} positive inotropic {{drugs with}} respect to their mechanisms of action. Drugs with established cardiotonic effects include cardiac glycosides, beta,-adrenergic agents, glucagon, histamine and the methylxanthines. New agents discussed are prenalterol, beta 2 - and alpha-adrenergic drugs, amrinone and <b>sulmazole.</b> Prenalterol is a betaradrenergic agent. Beta 2 -adrenergic drugs, amrinone and <b>sulmazole,</b> combine a positive inotropic and a vasodilator effect. The latter resemble theophylline and other methylxanthines in that they appear to act mainly as phosphodiesterase inhibitors with a subsequent increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). The mechanism of the positive inotropic effect of alpha-adrenergic stimulating agents (for example, phenylephrine) is unknown. It is independent of the cAMP system and is not accompanied by changes in frequency...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} MCI-i 54, a novel {{cardiotonic}} agent, on the con-tractile protein {{system and the}} sarcoplasmic reticulum (SA) were investigated by using thin bundles of chemically skinned fibers from the guinea pig papillary muscles. In the skinned muscle fibers treated with 50,g/ml of saponin, MCI- 154 shifted the-log[CaJM-tension relation curve {{to the left and}} upward in the concentration-dependent manner (1 to 1 0 M). This was confirmed also in the skinned muscle fibers treated with 250 g/ ml of saponin which destroyed not only the surface membrane but also the funcon of SR. <b>Sulmazole</b> (i 0 M) Shifted the-log[Ca 4]M-tension relation curve to the left but the effect was about 1 00 times less potent than that of MCI-i 54. Unlike MCI-i 54, <b>sulmazole</b> had little effect on the maximum tension devel-opment induced by-Iog[Ca 4 JM 4. 4. Milrinone did not affect the Ca-induced tension development in the skinned cardiac fibers. Higher concentration of MCI-i 54 (i 0 M) also increased ampli...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} the {{question}} was addressed whether cAMP mediated drugs induce a differential reduction of branches of the arachidonic acid metabolism rather than a global reduction of eicosanoid synthesis. The isolated lungs of actively sensitized rats were employed to study prostaglandin and leukotriene release in the presence and absence of the cAMP mediated drugs theophylline, milrinone, <b>sulmazole,</b> isobutyl-methylxanthine and salbutamol. The release of eicosanoids as measured by RIA was predominantly basal and continuous, with a mild antigen induced stimulation only for TXB 2 and the leukotrienes. All drugs reduced eicosanoid release globally. It is concluded that cAMP mediated drugs interfere with arachidonic acid metabolism at a site proximal to the branching into lipoxygenase and cyclo-oxygenase pathways...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} {{adenosine}} agonists to modulate the electrically evoked release of acetylcholine (ACh) from [3 H]choline preloaded guinea-pig superior cervical ganglia (SCG) was investigated. The adenosine A 1 -receptor selective agonist N 6 -cyclohexyladenosine (CHA) and 2 -chloroadenosine (2 -CADO) inhibited the evoked transmitter release, the effect being reversed by the A 1 -receptor selective antagonist 8 -cyclopentyl- 1, 3 -dipropylxanthine (DPCPX), and by <b>sulmazole</b> (SUL), which blocks both the A 1 -receptor and the adenylate cyclase inhibitory regulator Gi. In whole ganglia, CHA decreased both the basal and the forskolin (FSK) -stimulated cyclic AMP synthesis. The latter effect was again prevented by the A 1 antagonist DPCPX. These results {{are compatible with}} the existence, in the guinea-pig SCG, of adenosine A 1 -receptors, part of which are located on the presynaptic nerve terminals mediating an inhibition of ACh release...|$|E
40|$|The role of G {{proteins}} and related second messenger {{system on the}} modulation of acetylcholine release from [3 H]choline-preloaded guinea-pig superior cervical ganglion was investigated using the potent general activator NaF. The electrically evoked (1 Hz, 5 min) [3 H] release was inhibited by “low” F− concentrations (1 - 2. 5 mM), by the adenylyl cyclase blocker MDL 12330 A (10 μM), alone and in combination with 1 mM NaF, and increased by 0. 5 mM 8 Br-cAMP, 100 μM forskolin and 0. 5 mM 3 -isobutyl- 1 -methylxantine. No effect of 1 mM F− was observed on spontaneous release. Fluoride-induced inhibition was counteracted by the G protein blocker <b>sulmazole</b> (1 mM), forskolin and alteration of calcium influx by increasing [Ca 2 +]out from 2. 2 to 6 mM, raising the rate of stimulation (10 Hz, 30 s), or broadening the presynaptic action potential with 10 μM 4 -aminopyridine and 50 μM tetraethylammonium chloride. Thus a NaF-sensitive G protein, linked to cAMP synthesis, is determinant for the inhibition of neurosecretion in this cholinergic synapse, involving Ca 2 +-dependent mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|The {{benzimidazole}} molecule {{was modified}} to synthesize a Ca(2 +) sensitizer devoid of additional effects associated with Ca(2 +) overload. Newly synthesized compounds, termed 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, were evaluated in spontaneously beating and electrically driven atria from reserpine-treated guinea pigs. Compound 3 resulted {{as the most}} effective positive inotropic agent, and experiments were performed to study its mechanism of action. In spontaneously beating atria, the inotropic effect of 3 was concentration-dependent (3. 0 microM- 0. 3 mM). Compound 3 was more potent and more active than the structurally related Ca(2 +) sensitizers <b>sulmazole</b> and caffeine, but unlike them it did not increase the heart rate. In electrically driven atria, the inotropic activity of 3 was well preserved {{and it was not}} inhibited by propranolol, prazosin, ranitidine, pyrilamine, carbachol, adenosine deaminase, or ruthenium red. At high concentrations (0. 1 - 1. 0 mM) 3 inhibited phosphodiesterase-III, whereas it did not affect Na(+) /K(+) -ATPase, sarcolemmal Ca(2 +) -ATPase, Na(+) /Ca(2 +) exchange carrier, or sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2 +) pump activities of guinea pig heart. In skinned fibers obtained from guinea pig papillary muscle and skeletal soleus muscle, compound 3 (0. 1 mM, 1 mM) shifted the pCa/tension relation curve to the left, with no effect on maximal tension and no signs of toxicity. Compound 3 did not influence the basal or raised tone of guinea pig isolated aorta rings, whose cells do not contain the contractile protein troponin. The present results indicate that the inotropic effect of compound 3 seems to be primarily sustained by sensitization of the contractile proteins to Ca(2 +) ...|$|E
40|$|We {{identified}} and functionally characterized yeast fRMsr homolog which showed specificity for reduction of free Met-R-SO {{and contributed to}} oxidative stress resistance of yeast cells. We further identified three conserved Cys which participate in catalysis through disulfide exchange. Evolutionary analyses revealed that the occurrence of fRMSr is restricted to unicellular organisms. ^ We further found that mammalian MsrA can reduce free Met-S-SO, whereas MsrBs do not reduce free Met-R-SO. Consistent with these findings {{and the lack of}} fRMsr, mammalian cells could not grow in media that replaced Met with Met-R-SO. However, they grew in the presence of free Met-S-SO, which was reduced by MsrA. Expression of yeast fRMsr in mammalian cells supported the growth of mammalian cells on Met-R-SO, increased resistamce to oxidative stress, and affected expression levels of proteins that are regulated by Met availability. ^ We extended the finding of deficiency in free Met-R-SO reduction in mammals to examine the ability of Msrs to reduce compounds containing methylsulfinyls. Methylsulfide group has a prochiral sulfur, resulting in two diastereomers upon sulfoxidation. We found that methylsulfinyls in <b>sulmazole</b> sulfoxide, triclabendazole sulfoxide, and mesoridazine could be stereospecifically reduced by MsrA, but MsrB and fRMsr were not active. We also found that dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), which has a methylsulfinyl group, can only be reduced by MsrA. ^ To examine the role of Met in aging, we performed lifespan analyses in fruit flies. There was no difference in lifespan of flies maintained on restricted (0. 1 mM Met) and regular (1 mM) Met diets. Instead, we observed uncoupling between reproduction and longevity. A popular theory of aging suggests that dietary restriction is inversely proportional to reproduction due to nutritional redistribution of resources from egg generation to somatic maintenance, but we found that this theory did not follow our data that are based on variation in Met concentration. ^ Overall, our studies characterized all three known types of methionine sulfoxide reductase and uncovered biological significance of free methionine sulfoxide reduction and its deficiency in mammals. ...|$|E
