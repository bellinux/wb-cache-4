Background literature has been studied and further added to such that machine improvements can be made relating to both capacity and component wear life. The first part of the work undertaken considers material properties of rice grains in their various forms and machine components with which contact is made. Dimension measurements and SEM imagery have highlighted the organic nature of rice grains as an abrasive, and observations of the change in properties from pre to post process made. Mass change, grain profiles, coefficient of friction, grain hardness and compressive strength have all been measured. Wear observations of husking and polishing components has revealed similarities with known wear mechanisms. Microscopy and profilometry have shown the areas which are susceptible to increased wear rates whilst measurement of scratch angles has illustrated the motion of grains through the polisher. Small scale testing has been {{a key part of the}} research due to the impractically high capacity of full scale machines. Husking tests have established that the shear stress required to achieve a given husked ratio is constant suggesting that a harder rubber with the same coefficient of friction as a softer rubber will husk more efficiently. Fast capture camera footage of husking experiments has shown that grains rotate between the rubber counterfaces before husking which effectively creates a region of high pressure at either end of the grain. It has also revealed that grains maintain their initial contact with the slow roller whilst sliding against the fast roller once husked. Probable mechanisms for this effect have been determined and experiments have been conducted showing that the uneven wear created by the effect could be minimised by axial vibration of the slow roller. Small scale polishing experiments have been used to reveal the locations of the highest wear (through paint test) which have a pattern consistent with an uneven fill by the grains entering the polishing chamber or a resonance of the screens caused by cage spacing. High wear was noted at inlet thought to be a result of rapid scattering of grains on entry from the feed <b>screw.</b> <b>Pressure</b> sensitive paper has been used to determine contact pressure profiles for various stages and conditions in the polishing chamber and laser vibrometry has been used to observe the effect of loading on machine vibration.

Concentration of liquid in the inlet flow can influence the performance of the machine significantly. Characteristics of the multiphase flow at the suction of a screw compressor depend on the local flow velocities and concentration. Local flow velocity measurements inside the screw compressors are difficult to obtain. However other flow properties such as local pressures are easier to attain. It is therefore useful to carry out experiments with local pressure variations in the suction which can be used to validate the 3 D numerical Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) models that could help in studying the single and multiphase flow behaviour in screw compressors.

The objective was to evaluate how treatments in a compressive <b>screw</b> equipment <b>pressure</b> expansion (PREX) plug screw feeder, atmospheric (HCatm) and pressurised high-consistency refining (HCpress refining) affect both fibre and paper properties and, in particular, how fibre curl affects sheet density. The plug screw pre-treatments and HC refining were performed under atmospheric and steam-pressurised conditions at 100 degrees C, 125 degrees C and 175 degrees C. Even though fibre curl increased considerably during plug screw treatment and HCatm and HCpress refining, {{the density of the}} paper sheets did not decrease, as had been expected. A possible explanation for this result may be that the fibres become more flexible during curl treatment, resulting in increased sheet density. In order to obtain fibres that were both very curly and stiff, three ways of improving the fibre stiffness were tested: 1) lowering the pH during refining, 2) drying the fibres (hornification) and 3) treating the fibres with 1, 2, 3, 4 -ButaneTetraCarboxylic Acid (BTCA). If the fibres are dried (hornified), there is a lowering effect on sheet density. However, fibre curl does not have any lowering effect on sheet density. If the pH is decreased during plug screw treatment, the sheet density may be reduced but, again, the fibre curl does not have any positive effect on sheet density. Fibres treated with BTCA had a marked lowering effect on sheet density. With this treatment, the fibre curl does {{have a positive effect on}} sheet density.

40|$|The latest legal {{requirements}} call to an increasing degree of purification for plastics, for both virgin and recycled material. Abidance {{by the law}} demands new processing technologies for purifying plastics. The extraction with supercritical carbon dioxide could be an approach. Supercritical carbon dioxide {{is characterized by a}} high diffusion coefficient, a low viscosity and a high density. These properties are determining the outstanding solubility in scCO 2 even for higher molecular substances. Furthermore CO 2 is non flammable, ecologically safe, inexpensive and non toxic. One disadvantage of CO 2 is its low polarity and thus its low solubility for polar substances. The polarity of the extracting agent can be influenced specifically by dosing additional cosolvents like methanol in scCO 2. Carbon dioxide also is a gas which causes the greenhouse effect and should therefore be recycled. The usage of scCO 2 as an extracting agent in a twin screw extruder offers high potential for decreasing the amount of contaminations in the polymer melt. The extraction process is examined in the present paper for cleaning polymer melts. Main objective of the extraction is to remove foreign substances as monomers, solvent residues, processing aids and contaminations, which are diffusing into the interior material by using the plastics. These contaminations are dispersed or dissolved in the polymer. The applicability of a twin screw extruder for purifying polymer melt is analysed for both virgin material (two types of polyamide 12) to remove monomers and specifically contaminated high density polyethylene. To implement the extraction process on a twin screw extruder the compounding process has to be modified regarding this process technology, {{in order to keep the}} CO 2 in its overcritical state at high pressures > 75 bar. This is an additional requirement for common twin <b>screw</b> extruders. <b>Pressure</b> tightness was achieved by using a copper sealing in combination with a sealing paste. For dimensioning the extruder for extraction purposes, the processing unit should feature few linkage points. Besides the pressure tightness of the extruder the screw configuration has to be determined and optimised. A reflow zone following the zone for the CO 2 -outlet is proved to provide the possibility for the carbon dioxide, which is swept away with the polymer, to flow against the polymer flow back to the CO 2 outlet. After elaborating a sufficient process for taking samples, dependences of different processing parameters the extraction effect were researched. In general the highest extraction effect can be realised by increasing <b>pressure,</b> <b>screw</b> speed, processing temperature and the CO 2 -flow. Contrary to this an increased temperature level results in charred melt and a high CO 2 flow has a negative effect on the economy of the extraction process. The integration of a degassing unit and a counter flow process were also investigated. To do so an extruder cascade is inevitable due to safety reasons. Furthermore the extruder cascade facilitates stable processing conditions and simplified process control. Regarding the counter flow processing, the used screw configuration is inappropriate. Due to this improvement of the screw design is inevitable. Industry is reluctant using supercritical fluids despite of the considerable advantages. Reasons for the scepticism can be found in the high investment cost al well as using hegh pressure processing technology.

This concept may be also applied to the mortars with various fine aggregate geometries. And the die characteristics of screw extrusion were found to be similar to those of piston extrusion.

On June 8th, 1944, a Sherman tank was accompanying the 1st Ranger Battalion in an attack on the Maisy battery. It ran over a Tellermine and was blown to pieces, with a total crew loss. Sergeant John Robert [...] "Bob" [...] Slaughter describes the scene: [...] "The explosive energy from that hidden teller mine sent the 32-ton Sherman tank into the ditch on its side. This scene echoed the bloody, grotesque carnage of D-Day. One minute they were healthy young men, and the next minute they were bloody arms and legs wrapped around bloody torsos. We found body parts and shoes with the feet still stuck in them twenty-five yards away." ...|$|R
40|$|How {{the fitting}} {{clearance}} between the screw and {{the sleeve of}} a labyrinth screw pump (LSP) affects the pump performance and what law it follows are still unsolved problems for LSP design. So the fluid quasi-steady flow in the pump with different clearances is approximately modeled by the shear-stress transport k-ω model (SST k-ω model) in multiple reference frame (MRF) of CFD. The pump characteristics experiments are also carried out. In analyzing the simulated results, the fluid velocity in the pump is simplified as a linear superposition of a Couette flow dragged by the rotor <b>screw</b> and a <b>pressure</b> flow driven by the differential pressure of LSP. The CFD simulated results reveal that the clearance has scarcely effect on the drag flow. The mean axial pressure flow velocity in the clearance is the maximum and it increases with an increase of clearance. The leakage mainly occurs between the lands of screw and sleeve, and its rate can be simply estimated by leakage formulation for a narrow slot. With an increase in clearance, the pump maximum capacity changes little but the head and efficiency obviously decrease at the same flow rate. The changing tendency of simulated performances of the pump is in good agreement with the experimental results. At last, a set of modified relations between the pump performances and the relative diametrical clearance has been given, which {{can be applied to}} conveniently convert the LSP performance when the clearance changes...|$|R
