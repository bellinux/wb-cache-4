5|$|Apart from battling, {{capturing}} Pokémon is {{the most}} important element of Pokémon gameplay. Although other trainers' Pokémon cannot be captured, the player can use different kinds of Poké Balls on a wild Pokémon during battle. A successful capture adds the Pokémon to the player's active party or stores it if the player already has the maximum of six Pokémon. Factors in the <b>success</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> capture include the HP of the target Pokémon and the strength of the Poké Ball used; the lower the target's HP and the stronger the Poké Ball, the higher the <b>success</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> capture is. Also, inflicting certain status effects such as sleep or paralysis add a multiplier to the capture rate, making it easier to capture wild Pokémon. Each species has a capture rate of its own as well.|$|E

5|$|The {{reproductive}} {{habits of}} the Sumatran rhinoceros have been studied in captivity. Sexual relationships begin with a courtship period characterized by increased vocalization, tail raising, urination, and increased physical contact, with {{both male and female}} using their snouts to bump the other in the head and genitals. The pattern of courtship is most {{similar to that of the}} black rhinoceros. Young Sumatran rhino males are often too aggressive with females, sometimes injuring and even killing them during the courtship. In the wild, the female could run away from an overly aggressive male, but in their smaller captive enclosures, they cannot; this inability to escape aggressive males may partly contribute to the low <b>success</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> captive-breeding programs.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the early}} 20thcentury, when Swan Falls Dam was {{constructed}} {{on the middle}} Snake River upstream of Hells Canyon, the fifteen dams and reservoirs on the river have posed an increasing problem for migrating salmon. Agricultural lands and their resulting runoff have also {{had a significant impact}} on the <b>success</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> migrating fish. Salmon can travel up the Snake River as far as Hells Canyon Dam, using the fish passage facilities of the four lower Snake River dams, leaving the Clearwater, Grande Ronde and Salmon river to sustain spawning salmon. Rising in several forks in the Clearwater Mountains of central Idaho, the Clearwater and Salmon River watersheds are nearly undeveloped with the enormous exception of Dworshak Dam on the North Fork Clearwater River. The watershed of the Grande Ronde in northeastern Oregon is also largely undeveloped. The four reservoirs formed by the lower Snake River dams—Lake Sacagawea, Lake Herbert G. West, Lake Bryan, and Lower Granite Lake—have also formed problems, as the downstream current in the pools is often not enough for the fish to sense, confusing their migration routes.|$|E
5|$|Though {{breeding}} can {{be improved}} by supplementary feeding, the survival of young kakapo is hampered {{by the presence of}} Polynesian rats. Of 21 chicks that hatched between 1981 and 1994, nine were either killed by rats or died and were subsequently eaten by rats. Nest protection has been intensified since 1995 by using traps and poison stations as soon as a nest had been detected. A small video camera and infra-red light source watch the nest continuously, and will scare approaching rats with flashing lights and loud popping sounds. To increase the <b>success</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> nesting, a nest watcher places a small thermostatically controlled electric blanket over the eggs or chicks, whenever the female leaves the nest for food. The survival rate of chicks has increased from 29% in unprotected nests to 75% in protected ones.|$|E

30|$|The result {{reveals that}} (1) the <b>success</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> dual-frequency are {{significantly}} improved by triple-frequency and the improvement becomes more remarkable when the ionospheric constraint becomes weaker; (2) since triple-frequency geometry-based model is already very strong, the <b>success</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> different ionospheric constraints are very similar. It is however {{not the case}} for the dual-frequency, its <b>success</b> <b>rate</b> becomes smaller for the weaker ionospheric constraint; (3) it is noted that the triple-frequency <b>success</b> <b>rate</b> is still very large in case of ionosphere-float model. This result is very promising, meaning that the AR over long baselines will be applicable with triple-frequency signals. For more information about the improved AR, one can refer to Teunissen et al. (2002); Geng and Bock (2013); He et al. (2014); Li and Teunissen (2014).|$|R
5|$|Before commencing laying, {{the female}} spends much time near the nest and is entirely {{provisioned}} by the male. Meanwhile, the male roosts nearby and may cache any prey that is surplus to their requirements. When the female has reached peak weight, the male provides a ritual presentation {{of food and}} copulation occurs at the nest. The female lays eggs on alternate days and the clutch size averages about five eggs (range two to nine). The eggs are chalky white, somewhat elliptical and {{about the size of}} bantam's eggs, and incubation begins as soon as the first egg is laid. While she is sitting on the nest, the male is constantly bringing more provisions and they may pile up beside the female. The incubation period is about thirty days, hatching takes place over a prolonged period and the youngest chick may be several weeks younger than its oldest sibling. In years with plentiful supplies of food, there may be a hatching <b>success</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> about 75%. The male continues to copulate with the female when he brings food which makes the newly hatched chicks vulnerable to injury.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} {{success of}} the American white ibis is sensitive to the hydrological conditions of the ecosystem such as rainfall and water levels. Low and decreasing water levels predict good prey accessibility. Water level reversals, where levels rise in the breeding season, disperse prey and impact on foraging success. Nest numbers and average clutch sizes are smaller in periods of reduced prey availability. The <b>success</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> parents raising one or more young to 20 days of age ranges widely from 5 to 70% of nests, and varies greatly between nearby colonies. American white ibis parents {{have been known to}} supplement their chicks' diet with items such as cockroaches and rotting food from human garbage in poorer years, when fish and crayfish are more scarce. Studies have also shown that years with higher nesting numbers had significantly faster spring drying rates of water bodies than years with low nesting numbers. This is because faster drying rates means that there are fewer fish and increased available area where crayfish can be hunted. This highlights the fact that American white ibises do not use probability of nesting failure as a key factor in determining nesting sites but instead, rely on other criteria such as prey availability and nest-site predation rates. The draining of wetlands in south Florida has also impacted on species that forage in shallow water such as the American white ibis, and its increase in numbers is a key indicator of restoration of habitat within the Everglades.|$|E
5|$|To {{counteract}} these increasing {{complaints and}} attempts at legislation, {{the video game}} industry in the United States created the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) in 1994. This was prompted by a 1993 congressional hearing over {{the violence in the}} video game Mortal Kombat and lack of consistent content ratings between publishers, with Congress threatening to pass legislation that would mandate a ratings system if the industry did not take its own steps. The industry reacted by forming the Interactive Digital Software Association, which would become the ESA, and establishing the ESRB. The ESRB, like the Motion Picture Association of America's rating system, is a voluntary and self-regulated body that examines the content of video games as provided by the publisher before distribution, and given a rating describing the content within, generally classified from being all ages-appropriate to adult audiences only. Video game distributors are similarly bound by voluntary compliance to check the age of the purchaser against the rating of the game to prevent the sale of mature titles to younger players. Most stores prevent the sale of unrated games, so virtually every video game sold at retail in the United States is rated by the ESRB. Attempts have been made to mandate the ratings system; the Family Entertainment Protection Act, a 2005 bill introduced into the U.S. Congress by Senators Hillary Clinton, Joseph Lieberman, and Evan Bayh, would have made ESRB participation mandatory with oversight by the Federal Trade Commission, and introduced fines for selling Mature or Adult-Only content to minors. The bill, however, did not clear the Senate. Though the ESRB met criticism in 2000–2005 for the ease of access of mature-rated games to minors, the Board has improved its efforts to enforce the ratings system at retailers. A 2011 report issued by the Federal Trade Commission found that the voluntary controls by the ESRB had the highest <b>success</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> any media industry, preventing sales of mature titles to minors 87% of the time. Similar content rating systems exist in other countries, including the British Board of Film Classification, the Australian Classification Board, and Japan's Computer Entertainment Rating Organization.|$|E
