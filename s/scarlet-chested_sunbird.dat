50|$|On the Mashonaland plateau, race kirkii has {{declined}} {{in favour of}} <b>Scarlet-chested</b> <b>sunbird,</b> after fragmentation of its native miombo woodlands. In South Africa {{the range of the}} nominate race has increased along with the spread of wooded gardens.|$|E
50|$|The <b>scarlet-chested</b> <b>sunbird</b> (Chalcomitra senegalensis) is {{a species}} of bird in the Nectariniidae family. It is found in Angola, Benin, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ivory Coast, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.|$|E
50|$|The {{habitats}} {{that this}} bat lives are typically near water. Aquatic environments are generally inhabited, and when found in dryer climates such as forests or the savanah, {{they are generally}} near streams or in well watered areas. Roosting sites are often important in the ecology of bats, as the bats {{are subject to the}} conditions of their roosting sites. The nests constructed by birds, such as speckle-fronted weaver, provide protection from predators and the elements. likely {{as a result of the}} benefits gained from roosting in these nests, the lesser woolly bats have been known to roost in abandoned nests previously inhabited by speckled weavers, <b>scarlet-chested</b> <b>sunbirds,</b> and several others. The average number of bats per nest is usually between 1 and 3. However, the property and survival advantages remain unstudied.|$|R
50|$|As {{with several}} other Kerivoula species, the Damara woolly bat uses {{abandoned}} nests of weaverbirds and the <b>scarlet-chested</b> <b>sunbird.</b> Typically, the bats roost alone, but colonies can reach up to six members. The range of the bats extends across much of sub-Saharan Africa and has been identified in Angola, Cote d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Senegal, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.|$|E
50|$|Overall {{the family}} has fared better than many others, with only seven species {{considered}} to be threatened with extinction. Most species are fairly resistant to changes in habitat, and while attractive the family is not sought after by the cagebird trade, as they have what is considered an unpleasant song and are tricky to keep alive. Sunbirds are considered attractive birds and readily enter gardens where flowering plants are planted to attract them. There are a few negative interactions, for example the <b>scarlet-chested</b> <b>sunbird</b> is considered a pest in cocoa plantations as it spreads parasitic mistletoes.|$|E
50|$|In {{the blue}} waxbill both sexes build the nest, {{which is an}} oval-shaped {{structure}} with a short entrance tunnel on the side, constructed of grass stems and inflorescences and lined with feathers. The nest is normally placed among the foliage of a bush or tree, especially umbrella thorn and sickle bush Dichrostachys cinerea. They often choose to build the nest near a wasps' nests such as Belonogaster juncea, {{there is no evidence}} that wasps deter nest predators, but the birds may use the presence wasp nests as a way of working out whether there are arboreal ants Psuedomyrmex spp in the tree, as if present they would deter nesting by any wasps or birds. Blue waxbills may also re-use the old nests of other birds, such as <b>scarlet-chested</b> <b>sunbird,</b> spectacled weaver or black-chested prinia, sometimes building a new structure on top of the original.|$|E
