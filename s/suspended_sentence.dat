40|$|Previous {{research}} has focused mainly on determining the effectiveness of <b>suspended</b> <b>sentences</b> compared with other sentences, and seldom on understanding {{to what extent the}} different types of <b>suspended</b> <b>sentences</b> reduce recidivism rates. This study examined reconviction rates of offenders (N = 1, 258) who received fully or partly <b>suspended</b> prison <b>sentences,</b> with or without special conditions, in 2006 in two of the largest court districts in the Netherlands. Cox proportional hazard models revealed no difference in reconviction rates between fully and partly <b>suspended</b> prison <b>sentences,</b> with and without special conditions. However, <b>suspended</b> <b>sentences</b> without special conditions had significantly lower reconviction rates compared with special conditions that were solely control-orientated.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the ambivalent nature of <b>suspended</b> <b>sentences</b> and public reactions to them. In Australia and elsewhere, {{they have created}} confusion, have {{been in and out}} of political and judicial favour and have been repeatedly modified. The paper discusses the Victorian Sentencing Advisory Council’s Review of <b>suspended</b> <b>sentences,</b> with particular reference to public perceptions of the sentence and the Council’s various proposals. It examines in particular four issues relating to this sanction: (1) ostensible vs actual punishment; (2) the severity of punishment; (3) truth in sentencing and the nature of substitutional sanctions; and (4) the appropriateness of the sanction for specific offences. The paper concludes with a discussion as to whether public perceptions matter in the broader sentencing context. A VOLATILE AND PARADOXICAL SANCTION Few sanctions have divided communities as strongly as <b>suspended</b> <b>sentences.</b> <b>Suspended</b> <b>sentences</b> polarise opinion and provoke high emotion.

5|$|After 1995 the white-red-white flag {{is used as}} {{a symbol}} of the {{opposition}} to the regime of Alexander Lukashenko, most notably at the protests after the 2006 and 2010 presidential elections and at mass rallies on Freedom Day celebrations as well as Dziady memorial marches. The flag is not officially banned from public usage, but is treated by the authorities as an unregistered symbol which means that demonstration of it by political activists or sports fans can lead to arrests and confiscation of the flags. In early 2010, the political activist Siarhei Kavalenka was arrested for placing the white-red-white flag atop a Christmas tree on the central square of Vitsebsk. The court gave Kavalenka three years of <b>suspended</b> <b>sentence</b> which was followed by a second arrest and Kavalenka's several weeks long hunger strike. The hunger strike was interrupted by force-feeding on 16 January 2012.|$|E
5|$|Amaral {{was himself}} an arguido in {{relation}} to his investigation of another case, the disappearance of Joana Cipriano. One day after Madeleine's disappearance, Amaral was made arguido, and a month later {{he was charged with}} making a false statement. Four other officers were charged with assault. Eight-year-old Joana had vanished in 2004 from Figueira, seven miles (11km) from Praia da Luz. Her body was never found, and no murder weapon was identified. Her mother and the mother's brother were convicted of her murder after confessing, but the mother retracted her confession, saying she had been beaten by police. Amaral was not present when the beating is alleged to have taken place, but he was accused of having covered up for others. The other detectives were acquitted. Amaral was convicted of perjury in May 2009 and received an 18-month <b>suspended</b> <b>sentence.</b>|$|E
5|$|An {{incident}} at PJC illustrated Robinson's impatience with authority figures he perceived as racist—a character trait that would resurface repeatedly in his life. On January 25, 1938, {{he was arrested}} after vocally disputing the detention of a black friend by police. Robinson received a two-year <b>suspended</b> <b>sentence,</b> but the incident—along with other rumored run-ins between Robinson and police—gave Robinson a reputation for combativeness {{in the face of}} racial antagonism. While at PJC, he was motivated by a preacher (the Rev. Karl Downs) to attend church on a regular basis, and Downs became a confidant for Robinson, a Christian. Toward the end of his PJC tenure, Frank Robinson (to whom Robinson felt closest among his three brothers) was killed in a motorcycle accident. The event motivated Jackie to pursue his athletic career at the nearby University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he could remain closer to Frank's family.|$|E
40|$|Do <b>suspended</b> prison <b>sentences</b> keep {{down the}} prison population? This {{objective}} lay behind {{the introduction of}} this measure to Victoria in 1985. British literature on <b>suspended</b> <b>sentences</b> suggests that this objective is unrealistic, and that precisely the opposite happened in Britain: a (lagged) blow-out in the prison population when <b>suspended</b> <b>sentences</b> became activated. The initial and longer-term impact of <b>suspended</b> <b>sentences</b> is tested with available data from magistrates courts, higher courts and prison censuses. The evidence from these sources confirms that {{a decline in the}} use of immediate imprisonment coincided with a growth in the use of <b>suspended</b> <b>sentences.</b> Some of this decline was temporary, as orders were breached and prison sentences activated. However, the net effect was a drop in the use of imprisonment. The avoidance of a lagged increase in the prison population was achieved by a combination of factors: short operational periods, a low breach rate, and extensive use of discretion in re-sentencing.

5|$|Barton's {{career and}} life have {{been marked by}} {{numerous}} controversial incidents and disciplinary problems {{and he has been}} convicted twice on charges of violence. On 20 May 2008, he was sentenced to six months' imprisonment for common assault and affray during an incident in Liverpool City Centre. Barton served 77 days of this prison term, being released on 28 July 2008. On 1 July 2008, he was also given a four-month <b>suspended</b> <b>sentence</b> after admitting assault occasioning actual bodily harm on former teammate Ousmane Dabo during a training-ground dispute on 1 May 2007. This incident effectively ended his Manchester City career. Barton has been charged with violent conduct three times by The Football Association: for the assault on Dabo, for punching Morten Gamst Pedersen in the stomach and for attacking three players {{on the final day of}} the 2011–12 season.|$|E
5|$|Barton's {{subsequent}} conviction, {{a four-month}} <b>suspended</b> <b>sentence</b> for the earlier assault on Ousmane Dabo at Manchester City, was handed out while serving this sentence. He returned to playing action on 30 August 2008, six {{days before his}} FA hearing, as a second-half substitute during Newcastle's 3–0 defeat to Arsenal. He came on to a chorus of boos from the Arsenal supporters. Shortly into this return match, Barton was involved in an incident with Samir Nasri, putting in a strong tackle, for which the referee did not give a foul. The tackle, though hard, was legal. Minutes later, Nasri deliberately clipped Barton while tracking back, {{for which he was}} booked. At the end of the match, Newcastle manager Kevin Keegan was involved in an altercation with Nasri and Arsenal captain William Gallas, in regards to the incident.|$|E

A witness for the prosecution, noted ulama and writer Haji Abdul Malik Karim Amrullah (Hamka), testified that a depiction of Allah wearing glasses implied that Allah was imperfect, as opposed to the personifications cited by Jassin, which were based on man's love for Allah. Hamka later stated that nobody had been able to incite hatred against Muhammad like Kipandjikusmin since the Crusades. Jassin was sentenced to a one-year <b>suspended</b> <b>sentence.</b>|$|E

5|$|In {{preparation}} for redevelopment, {{the remains of}} the train shed roof had been demolished in 1958, and Barry's hotel (which had been used as offices since 1931) soon followed in 1960. The architect selected to design the new building was John Poulson who was good friends with Graham Tunbridge, a British Rail surveyor whom he had met during the war. Poulson took advantage of this friendship to win contracts for the redevelopment of various British Rail termini. He paid Tunbridge a weekly income of £25 and received in return building contracts, including the rebuilding of Waterloo and East Croydon stations. At his trial in 1974, Poulson admitted that, shortly before receiving the Cannon Street building contract, he had given Tunbridge a cheque for £200 and a suit worth £80. Poulson was later found guilty of corruption charges and was given a seven-year concurrent sentence; Tunbridge received a 15-month <b>suspended</b> <b>sentence</b> and £4,000 fine {{for his role in the}} affair.|$|E
5|$|On 4 March, Richards' partner Anita Pallenberg {{pleaded guilty}} to drug {{possession}} and incurred a fine {{in connection with the}} original airport incident. The drug case against Richards dragged on for over a year. Ultimately, Richards received a <b>suspended</b> <b>sentence</b> and was ordered to play two free concerts for the CNIB in Oshawa; both shows featured the Rolling Stones and the New Barbarians, a group that Wood had put together to promote his latest solo album, and which Richards also joined. This episode strengthened Richards' resolve to stop using heroin. It also ended his relationship with Pallenberg, which had become strained since the death of their third child, Tara. Pallenberg was unable to curb her heroin addiction while Keith struggled to get clean. While Richards was settling his legal and personal problems, Jagger continued his jet-set lifestyle. He was a regular at New York's Studio 54 disco club, often in the company of model Jerry Hall. His marriage to Bianca Jagger ended in 1977, although they had long been estranged.|$|E
