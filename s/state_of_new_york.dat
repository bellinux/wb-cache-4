5|$|On April1, 1981, NY326 was realigned {{between the}} hamlets of Oakwood and Half Acre {{as the result}} of a highway {{maintenance}} swap between the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> and Cayuga County. As part of the swap, the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> assumed maintenance of Half Acre Road from Oakwood to Half Acre while maintenance of NY326's former routing between the two locations was transferred to Cayuga County. The former routing of NY326 on Oakwood Road is now designated as County Route168A (CR168A) in the town of Aurelius and CR168B in the town of Springport. The Genesee Street portion of old NY326 is now part of CR1.
