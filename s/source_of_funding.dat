5|$|Since 1926, the University of Toronto {{has been}} a member of the Association of American Universities, a {{consortium}} of the leading North American research universities. The university manages by far the largest annual research budget of any university in Canada, with sponsored direct-cost expenditures of $878 million in 2010. The federal government was the largest <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>funding,</b> with grants from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council amounting to about one-third of the research budget. About eight percent of research funding came from corporations, mostly in the healthcare industry.|$|E

5|$|The World Health Organization (WHO), {{which focuses}} on {{international}} health issues and disease eradication, is another of the UN's largest agencies. In 1980, the agency announced that the eradication of smallpox had been completed. In subsequent decades, WHO largely eradicated polio, river blindness, and leprosy. The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), begun in 1996, co-ordinates the organization's response to the AIDS epidemic. The UN Population Fund, which also dedicates part of its resources to combating HIV, is the world's largest <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> for reproductive health and family planning services.|$|E

The Friends of SCPA (commonly known as The Friends), a nonprofit {{organization}} led by parents and members of the business and arts communities, had been a vital <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> since the school's inception. In 1984, The Friends raised over $400,000 to pay the salaries of the artistic director, technical director, costume designer, and dance, strings, and production teachers. In later years, The Friends raised up to $1million each year through special events, corporate gifts and sponsorships, advertising sales, and other programs to support the artistic needs of the school including staff salaries, production expenses, scholarships for private lessons, and artists in residence.|$|E
5|$|Two of Daniels' other tax {{proposals}} were approved: {{a tax on}} liquor and beverages to fund {{the construction of the}} Lucas Oil Stadium and a tax on rental cars to expand the Indiana Convention Center. The new <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> resulted in a state take-over of a project initially started by the City of Indianapolis and led to a bitter feud between Daniels and the city leadership over who should have ownership of the project. The state ultimately won and took ownership of the facilities from the city.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} {{estimate}} illicit financial flows, this method measures a country's <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> (inflows <b>of</b> capital) against its recorded use (outflows and/or expenditures <b>of</b> capital). <b>Source</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> includes increases in net external indebtedness {{of the public}} sector and the net inflow of foreign direct investment. Use <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> includes the current account deficit that is financed by the capital account flows and additions to central bank reserves. An excess <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> over the recorded use (or expenditures) points to a loss of unaccounted-for capital, and, as such, indicates illicit financial outflow.|$|R

5|$|While on Washington's staff, Hamilton {{had become}} {{frustrated}} with the decentralized nature of the wartime Continental Congress, particularly its dependence upon the states for voluntary financial support. Under the Articles of Confederation, Congress had no power to collect taxes or to demand money from the states. This lack of a stable <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> had {{made it difficult for}} the Continental Army both to obtain its necessary provisions and to pay its soldiers. During the war, and for some time after, Congress obtained what funds it could from subsidies from the King of France, from aid requested from the several states (which were often unable or unwilling to contribute), and from European loans.|$|E
5|$|As of 2005, South Dakota has {{the lowest}} per capita total state tax rate in the United States. The state does not levy {{personal}} or corporate income taxes, inheritance taxes, or taxes on intangible personal property. The state sales tax rate is 4.5 percent. Various localities have local levies so in some areas the rate is 6 percent. The state sales tax {{does not apply to}} sales to Indians on Indian reservations, but many reservations have a compact with the state. Businesses on the reservation collect the tax and the state refunds to the Indian Tribes the percentage of sales tax collections relating to the ratio of Indian population to total population in the county or area affected. Ad valorem property taxes are local taxes and are a large <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> for school systems, counties, municipalities and other local government units. The South Dakota Special Tax Division regulates some taxes including cigarette and alcohol-related taxes.|$|E
5|$|In 354BC, Demosthenes {{delivered}} his first political oration, On the Navy, {{in which he}} espoused moderation and proposed the reform of the symmoriai (boards) as a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> for the Athenian fleet. In 352BC, he delivered For the Megalopolitans and, in 351BC, On the Liberty of the Rhodians. In both speeches he opposed Eubulus, the most powerful Athenian statesman of the period 355 to 342BC. The latter was no pacifist but came to eschew a policy of aggressive interventionism {{in the internal affairs}} of the other Greek cities. Contrary to Eubulus's policy, Demosthenes called for an alliance with Megalopolis against Sparta or Thebes, and for supporting the democratic faction of the Rhodians in their internal strife. His arguments revealed his desire to articulate Athens's needs and interests through a more activist foreign policy, wherever opportunity might provide.|$|E

In the same year, Research Infosource ranked McMaster as the second most research intensive university {{in the country with}} an average research income of C$358,300 per full-time faculty member, the second highest average in the country.

5|$|This was {{the first}} {{election}} since the Act on a Candidate's Election Funding came into force in May 2009, along with the 2010 amendments to the Act on Political Parties. Both laws mandate the disclosure {{of the sources of}} campaign finance and expenses. Every candidate and party as a whole must disclose their <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>funding.</b> Campaign funding may start six months before the election day and end two weeks after the election regardless of when the costs are actually paid. The candidates must file a public report with the National Audit Office detailing their sources of all contributions of over â¬1,500 in value raised in support of the election campaign. The funds include expenses from the candidate's own assets, loans taken out for the campaign, and contributions received by either the individual or by a group that supports the candidate. Candidates are barred from receiving anonymous contributions of over â¬1,500 in value.|$|E
5|$|Bormann took a {{job with}} Der Nationalsozialist, a weekly paper edited by NSDAP member Hans Severus Ziegler, who was deputy Gauleiter (party leader) for Thuringia. After joining the NSDAP in 1927, Bormann began duties as {{regional}} press officer, but his lack of public-speaking skills made him ill-suited to this position. He soon put his organisational skills to use as business manager for the Gau (region). He moved to Munich in October 1928, where {{he worked in the}} SA insurance office. Initially the NSDAP provided coverage through insurance companies for members who were hurt or killed in the frequent violent skirmishes with members of other political parties. As insurance companies were unwilling to pay out claims for such activities, in 1930 Bormann set up the Hilfskasse der NSDAP (NSDAP Auxiliary Fund), a benefits and relief fund directly administered by the party. Each party member was required to pay premiums and might receive compensation for injuries sustained while conducting party business. Payments out of the fund were made solely at Bormann's discretion. He began to gain a reputation as a financial expert, and many party members felt personally indebted to him after receiving benefits from the fund. In addition to its stated purpose, the fund was used as a last-resort <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> for the NSDAP, which was chronically short of money at the time. After the NSDAP's success in the 1930 general election, where they won 107 seats, party membership grew dramatically. By 1932 the fund was collecting 3 million Reichsmarks per year.|$|E
