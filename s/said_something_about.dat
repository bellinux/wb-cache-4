2500|$|In 1598 Casaubon was at Lyon, {{overseeing}} the printing of his Athenaeus. Here {{he lived in}} the house of , surintendant de la justice (Superintendent of Justice), a liberal-minded Catholic. Accompanied by de Vicq, Casaubon briefly visited Paris, where he was presented to King Henry IV of France. The king <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> employing Casaubon's services in the [...] "restoration" [...] of the fallen University of Paris. In January 1599, he received a summons to return to Paris, but the terms of the letter were so vague that Casaubon hesitated to act on it. However, he resigned his chair at Montpellier. [...] He stayed another year at Lyon with de Vicq, where he hoped to meet the king, who was expected to visit the south. Nothing more was heard about the professorship, but instead De Vicq summoned him to Paris for important business: the Fontainebleau Conference. Casaubon was persuaded to sit as a referee on the challenge sent to Du Plessis Mornay by Cardinal Duperron. By so doing he placed himself in a false position, as Joseph Scaliger said: ...|$|E

[...] Jaffa told me later that Earp’s woman was a Jewess. Earp did mezuzah when entering the house." [...] Earp's anger at Holliday's ethnic slur may indicate that his feelings for Josephine was more serious at the time than is commonly known. The information in the letter is compelling {{because at the time}} it was written in the 1940s, the relationship between Wyatt Earp and Josephine Marcus while living in Tombstone was virtually unknown. The only way Otero could write about these things was if he had a personal relationship with some of the individuals involved. The Earp party split up in Albuquerque, and Holliday and Dan Tipton rode on to Pueblo, while the rest of the group headed for Gunnison.|$|E
2500|$|Holliday {{and four}} {{other members of the}} posse were still faced with {{warrants}} for Stilwell's death. The group elected to leave the Arizona Territory for New Mexico Territory and then on to Colorado. Wyatt and Holliday, who had been fast friends had a serious disagreement and parted ways in Albuquerque. [...] According to a letter written by former New Mexico Territory Governor Miguel Otero, Wyatt and Holliday were eating at Fat Charlie's The Retreat Restaurant in Albuquerque [...] "when Holliday <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> Earp becoming 'a damn Jew-boy.' Earp became angry and left…. Earp was staying with a prominent businessman, Henry N. Jaffa, who was also president of New Albuquerque’s Board of Trade. Jaffa was Jewish, and based on the letter Earp had, while staying in Jaffa’s home, he honored Jewish tradition by touching the mezuzah upon entering his home. According to Otero's letter, Jaffa told him, [...] "Earp’s woman was a Jewess." [...] Earp's anger at Holliday's racial slur may indicate that the relationship between Josephine Marcus and Wyatt Earp was more serious at the time than is commonly known. [...] Holliday and Dan Tipton arrived in Pueblo, Colorado in late April 1882.|$|E
2500|$|During {{his show}} on May 24, 2011, Schultz called Laura Ingraham both a [...] "right-wing slut" [...] and a [...] "talk slut." [...] Feminist {{organizations}} including the Women's Media Center called for his suspension. The following day he issued an apology {{by saying he}} [...] "used vile and inappropriate language when talking about talk show host Laura Ingraham. I am deeply sorry, and I apologize. It was wrong, uncalled for and I recognize the severity of what I said. I apologize to you, Laura, and ask for your forgiveness." [...] He offered an indefinite self-suspension without pay. Ingraham accepted his apology: [...] "Ed Schultz <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> me on his show that was not all that nice, to say the least. It was pretty crude. He apologized, and I accept his apology. It seemed heartfelt, {{it seemed like he}} really wished he hadn't said it and I accept that apology." [...] MSNBC issued a statement saying that it had accepted Schultz's offer to take one week of unpaid leave over the matter. Schultz ended his radio show on May 23, 2014. He stated on MSNBC, [...] "This change will give me more flexibility to be on the road, to do the kind of shows I want to do here for The Ed Show here on MSNBC. This is on me, you know. I just don't want to do a three-hour talk show anymore." ...|$|E
