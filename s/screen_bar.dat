25|$|The {{influent}} in {{sewage water}} {{passes through a}} <b>bar</b> <b>screen</b> to remove all large objects like cans, rags, sticks, plastic packets etc. carried in the sewage stream. This is most commonly done with an automated mechanically raked <b>bar</b> <b>screen</b> in modern plants serving large populations, while in smaller or less modern plants, a manually cleaned screen may be used. The raking action of a mechanical <b>bar</b> <b>screen</b> is typically paced according to the accumulation on the <b>bar</b> <b>screens</b> and/or flow rate. The solids are collected and later disposed in a landfill, or incinerated. <b>Bar</b> <b>screens</b> or mesh screens of varying sizes {{may be used to}} optimize solids removal. If gross solids are not removed, they become entrained in pipes and moving parts of the treatment plant, and can cause substantial damage and inefficiency in the process.|$|R

50|$|From the Stair Hall, {{entry to}} the Lounge Bar is through a doorway in a glazed timber <b>bar</b> <b>screen.</b> The <b>bar,</b> similar in style {{to that of the}} Public Bar, has a curved corner to the eastern end and a timber <b>bar</b> <b>screen</b> to western end, which is similar to the screen of the doorway. There is a pressed metal ceiling and cornice, forming coffers between the beams. Beyond the Lounge is the Bistro area which also has a pressed metal ceiling with borders, {{cornices}} and roses. From here several French doors lead into beer garden courtyard.|$|R
50|$|The {{treatment}} process passed wastewater {{through the}} <b>bar</b> <b>screen,</b> which filtered out large solids, {{then to a}} measuring followed by a finer <b>bar</b> <b>screen</b> flume. Solids from the <b>bar</b> <b>screens</b> went to a sludge pond, while coarsely filtered water went to a pre-sedimentation tank, which separated grease and additional solids. An aeration stage allowed aerobic bacteria to work, followed by a pass through clarifier tanks. Filters used anthracite coal to give final clarity, followed by chlorination and storage. The plant operated with its original equipment until it closed. Most of the equipment is original.|$|R

As a <b>bar</b> <b>screen</b> collects objects, the water level will rise, and so they must be cleared regularly to prevent overflow.|$|R

40|$|Grain Boundary Engineering {{can enhance}} the {{population}} of structurally-ordered "low S" Coincidence Site Lattice (CSL) grain boundaries in the microstructure. In some alloys, these "special" grain boundaries {{have been reported to}} improve overall resistance to corrosion, oxidation, and creep resistance. Such improvements could be quite beneficial for superalloys, especially in conditions which encourage damage and cracking at grain boundaries. Therefore, the effects of GBE processing on high-temperature mechanical properties of the cast and wrought superalloy Allvac 718 Plus (Allvac ATI) were <b>screened.</b> <b>Bar</b> sections were subjected to varied GBE processing, and then consistently heat treated, machined, and tested at 650 C. Creep, tensile stress relaxation, and dwell fatigue crack growth tests were performed. The influences of GBE processing on microstructure, mechanical properties, and associated failure modes are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to conduct {{experimental}} tests on a physical model of bottom intake structures to investigate the effects of slope and area opening of the screen on the amount of diverted discharge. To reach such goals, a bottom intake model was constructed in a flume of 60 cm wide, 8 m long and 60 cm high. The model was tested under different flow discharges, screen slopes and screen open area. Tests were conducted with and without sediment to see the rate of clogging of the screen due to presence of sediment. The results have shown that for small slope the sediment trap between the <b>screen</b> <b>bars</b> which reduce the area opening. Increasing the slope is reducing the sediment to trap but the flow depth over the screen reduces and thus the flow discharge reduces. It was found that at slope of 30 %, diverted flow discharge is maximum and at the same time the diverted sediment is minimum. The presence of sediment can reduce 10 % the discharge intake...|$|R

40|$|The <b>bar</b> or net <b>screens</b> {{are ones}} {{of the methods}} to {{increase}} protection level of military vehicle crews against anti-tank grenades fired from RPG- 7. Their task is to prevent generation of the shaped charge jet. The probability of vehicle's protection level when applying such types of screens depends on their structure- percentage share of the open space, i. e. space for which the flying grenade will not touch the structure element with its fuse, {{but it will be}} destructed. The two mechanisms are here mainly used: short circuit in the fuse circuit, deformation of conical section of the shaped charge warhead. This article presents analysis of structure of the <b>bar</b> and net <b>screens</b> due to share of the open space, for various impact angle of grenade in elevation and azimuth. The following were changed: thickness and width of bars and distance between them, thickness of wire and shape of individual net mesh. The solution of <b>bar</b> <b>screen</b> with the lowest weight and grenade destruction ability was selected. This solution was compared with the net screen offered currently on the market For the selected solutions, for angles increasing in elevation, up to 300 value, the <b>bar</b> <b>screen</b> has the larger open space than net screen. For angles in azimuth, the <b>bar</b> <b>screen</b> has larger open space for the entire range of angles. The <b>bar</b> <b>screen</b> is heavier by 50 - 60 % when compared to the selected net screens, but their operation costs are lower. They are repaired in field condition...|$|R
40|$|In {{this report}} {{the theory of}} three {{dimensional}} antenna in lon Cyclotron Resonance Frequency (ICRF) is developed for a plasma with circular magnetic surfaces. The multi loop antenna is located in ITER several ports. Circular plasma and antenna geometry provides new important tools to account for: l) right loading antenna impedance matrix calculation urgently needed for a matching of RF generator with an antenna; 2) right calculation of an antenna toroidal and poloidal excited spectra because the DIFFRACTION, refraction and REFLECTION effects for the Fast Waves (FW) are in FIRST time are included self consistently in 3 D ICRF antenna - plasma treatment; 3) right calculation of RF power deposition profiles because self consistently found 3 D antenna - plasma FW excited spectra in non slab plasma model are important ones in a weakly dissipated plasma for Fast Waves (even for ITER parameters). In the developed theory multi loop antennae are located in several ITER ports with arbitrary relative toroidal and poloidal positions. It gives great flexibility of investigation possibility for production of an optimal ICRF antenna directivity in conditions of limited toroidal space in a reactor port and a possibility to control widness of excited FW k - spectra to control RF power deposition profiles into a plasma. The above theory allows to calculate RF losses on a Faraday <b>screen</b> <b>bars.</b> In the model developed each loop {{is located in a}} special individual recess in a tokamak port to control in some extent mutual coupling between loops through a vacuum port region and simulteneously to support the Faraday <b>screen</b> <b>bars.</b> The theory developed accounts for two options for poloidal loops: to be located INSIDE of each sub recess (with a smaller mutual loops coupling) and to be located OUTSIDE of each sub recess (more closely to plasma) with an increased antenna loading resistance. Radial antenna loops feeders are taken into account as well. The MULTI PORT structure of the theory gives another important tool to control mutual coupling of loops: it is possible to locate one port just near another one with, for example, only two loops in each sub PORT just simulating contineous conducting boundary between several loops (besides of sub recess walls). Another possibility is to simulate extended toroidal port size to improve an antenna directivity. The information about plasma properties comes into antenna theory through plasma surface impedance matrix Y_mm and is calculated separately by fast MlNTOR 2 code described in Part A. According to theory developed the ANPORT code has been written. The first runs indicated strong mutual loops coupling of ITER now designed antenna. The work is under progress. ...|$|R
