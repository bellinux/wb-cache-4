However, natural light, as well as many <b>scenes</b> <b>with</b> artificial lighting, is predictable, so that exposure often can be determined with reasonable accuracy from tabulated values.|$|R

5|$|Alfred Hitchcock's cameo is a {{signature}} occurrence {{in most of}} his films. In Psycho, he can be seen through a window—wearing a Stetson hat—standing outside Marion Crane's office. Wardrobe mistress Rita Riggs has said that Hitchcock chose this scene for his cameo {{so that he could}} be in a <b>scene</b> <b>with</b> his daughter (who played one of Marion's colleagues). Others have suggested that he chose this early appearance in the film in order to avoid distracting the audience.|$|E

5|$|Cluj-Napoca has {{a diverse}} and growing {{cultural}} <b>scene,</b> <b>with</b> cultural life exhibited {{in a number}} of fields, including the visual arts, performing arts and nightlife. The city's cultural scene spans its history, dating back to Roman times: the city started to be built in that period, which has left its mark on the urban layout (centered on today's Piața Muzeului) as well as surviving ruins. However, the medieval town saw a shift in its centre towards new civil and religious structures, notably St. Michael's Church.|$|E
5|$|Her {{first scene}} was for The Oral Adventures of Craven Moorehead 8 with her agent Slim Shady (Dez) {{and his best}} friend, Moorehead.
