5|$|As sensor coils {{are placed}} on the tongue of the subject, {{articulation}} may be affected depending on {{the placement of the}} coils, but no comparative analysis has shown whether articulation is altered because of the coils. The coils are about 3mm in size and are not considered to be a particularly large <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>error</b> for measurements. Some researchers have found that subjects are irritated by sensor coils placed on the tip of the tongue which can lead to disturbed articulation. Similarly, the wires attached to the sensor coils can inhibit articulation if not run out the side of the mouth.|$|E

25|$|It {{was already}} {{realized}} that one major <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>error</b> in bombing was leveling the aircraft enough so the bombsight pointed straight down. Even small errors in leveling could produce dramatic errors in bombing, so the Navy {{began a series}} of developments to add a gyroscopic stabilizer to various bomb sight designs. This led to orders for such designs from Estoppey, Inglis (working with Sperry) and Seversky. Norden was asked to provide an external stabilizer for the Navy's existing Mark III designs.|$|E
25|$|Using this equipment, Cavendish {{calculated}} the attraction between the balls {{from the period}} of oscillation of the torsion balance, and then he used this value to calculate {{the density of the}} Earth. Cavendish found that the Earth's average density is 5.48 times greater than that of water. John Henry Poynting later noted that the data should have led to a value of 5.448, and indeed that is the average value of the twenty-nine determinations Cavendish included in his paper. What was extraordinary about Cavendish’s experiment was its elimination of every <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>error</b> and every factor that could disturb the experiment and its precision in measuring an astonishingly small attraction, a mere 1/50,000,000 of the weight of the lead balls. The result that Cavendish obtained for the density of the Earth is within 1 percent of the currently accepted figure.|$|E
25|$|Full flow penetrometers (T-bar, ball, and plate) probes {{are used}} in {{extremely}} soft clay soils (such as sea-floor deposits) and are advanced {{in the same manner}} as the CPT. As their names imply, the T-bar is a cylindrical bar attached at right angles to the drill string forming what look likes a T, the ball is a large sphere, and the plate is flat circular plate. In soft clays, soil flows around the probe similar to a viscous fluid. The pressure due to overburden stress and pore water pressure is equal on all sides of the probes (unlike with CPT's), so no correction is necessary, reducing a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>error</b> and increasing accuracy. Especially desired in soft soils due to the very low loads on the measuring sensors. Full flow probes can also be cycled up and down to measure remolded soil resistance. Ultimately the geotechnical professional can use the measured penetration resistance to estimate undrained and remolded shear strengths.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} tests is gravitational lensing. It has been observed in distant astrophysical sources, but these are poorly controlled and it is uncertain how they constrain general relativity. The most precise tests are analogous to Eddington's 1919 experiment: they measure the deflection of radiation from a distant source by the Sun. The sources that can be most precisely analyzed are distant radio sources. In particular, some quasars are very strong radio sources. The directional resolution of any telescope is in principle limited by diffraction; for radio telescopes this is also the practical limit. An important improvement in obtaining positional high accuracies (from milli-arcsecond to micro-arcsecond) was obtained by combining radio telescopes across Earth. The technique is called very long baseline interferometry (VLBI). With this technique radio observations couple the phase information of the radio signal observed in telescopes separated over large distances. Recently, these telescopes have measured the deflection of radio waves by the Sun to extremely high precision, confirming the amount of deflection predicted by general relativity aspect to the 0.03% level. At this level of precision systematic effects have to be carefully taken into account to determine the precise location of the telescopes on Earth. Some important effects are Earth's nutation, rotation, atmospheric refraction, tectonic displacement and tidal waves. Another important effect is refraction of the radio waves by the solar corona. Fortunately, this effect has a characteristic spectrum, whereas gravitational distortion is independent of wavelength. Thus, careful analysis, using measurements at several frequencies, can subtract this <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>error.</b>|$|E

500|$|For all {{of their}} efficiency, atomic line filters are not perfect; there are many sources of error, or [...] "noise", in a given system. These are {{manifest}} as electromagnetic radiation independent of the working processes of the filter {{and the intensity of}} the signal light. One <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>error</b> is the thermal radiation of and within the ALF itself. Some thermal radiation comes directly from the filter and happens to be within the bandpass of the second broad band filter. More noise is created if the filter is designed for output in the infrared range, as most of the thermal radiation would be in that spectrum. These emissions may stimulate the vapor and create the radiation it is trying to detect in the first place.|$|E

2500|$|At high {{sequence}} identities, {{the primary}} <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>error</b> in homology modeling {{derives from the}} choice of the template or templates on which the model is based, while lower identities exhibit serious errors in sequence alignment that inhibit the production of high-quality models.

2500|$|This {{inaccuracy}} in GPS {{is mostly}} due to large [...] "billows" [...] in the ionosphere, which slow the radio {{signal from the}} satellites by a random amount.

2500|$|The {{isotope ratio}} of carbon in the steroids of athletes {{has been used}} to {{determine}} whether these steroids originated from the body of the athlete or an exogenous source.

[...] Attempts are being made to create similar tests based on stable hydrogen isotopes which could be used to compliment the existing testing methods. [...] One concern with this method was that the natural steroids produced by the human body may vary significantly based on the deuterium content of drinking water, leading to false detection of doping based on hydrogen isotope differences. [...] This concern has been addressed in a recent study which concluded that the effect of D/H ratio of drinking water did not pose an insurmountable <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>error</b> for this anti-doping testing strategy.|$|E
2500|$|Double {{pendulum}} gravimeters: Starting in 1875, {{the increasing}} accuracy of pendulum measurements revealed another <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>error</b> in existing instruments: {{the swing of}} the pendulum caused a slight swaying of the tripod stand used to support portable pendulums, introducing error. In 1875 Charles S Peirce calculated that measurements {{of the length of}} the seconds pendulum made with the Repsold instrument required a correction of 0.2mm due to this error. [...] In 1880 C. Defforges used a Michelson interferometer to measure the sway of the stand dynamically, and interferometers were added to the standard Mendenhall apparatus to calculate sway corrections. [...] A method of preventing this error was first suggested in 1877 by Hervé Faye and advocated by Peirce, Cellérier and Furtwangler: mount two identical pendulums on the same support, swinging with the same amplitude, 180° out of phase. The opposite motion of the pendulums would cancel out any sideways forces on the support. The idea was opposed due to its complexity, but by the start of the 20th century the Von Sterneck device and other instruments were modified to swing multiple pendulums simultaneously.|$|E
