40|$|In {{this paper}} we have {{considered}} using turbo channel coding to encode the 8 kbits/s output from the G. 729 speech codec. The source and channel coded bits are then transmitted using a wideband Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) {{system in the}} framework of the Mode-I FRAMES proposals [I]. We illustrate the benefits of using OFDM with channel coding to alleviate some of the problems associated with wideband fading channels. Furthermore, we discuss how OFDM can be used in conjunction with the G. 729 <b>speech</b> codec and <b>half</b> <b>rate</b> channel coding in order to utilise one speechldata FRAMES subbburst. Finally some of the issues and problems associated with using turbo coded OFDM in speech transmission systems are considered using the system characterised in Table 1. In Figure 6 a channel SNR of 6 dB appears sufficiently high under the stipulated system conditions for near-unimpaired speech transmission...|$|R

40|$|Nine {{trials were}} {{conducted}} {{over three years}} at three sites to evaluate the efficacy of reduced rates of various fungicide products for their biological efficacy in controlling stem, foliar and ear diseases of winter wheat {{as well as their}} effects on yield and grain quality, and to compare the relative profitability of full and reduced rates of fungicides. The results show that the use of <b>half</b> <b>rates</b> can give an economic benefit over that of full rates in many situations. In circumstances where variety or seasonal factors resulted in low to moderate foliar disease pressure the use of <b>half</b> <b>rates</b> gave similar yields to that of full rates. Where foliar disease pressure was high, <b>half</b> <b>rates</b> generally gave lower yields than full rates but the amount of the reduction varied with the fungicide product used. The use of spray additives improved the yield response of the <b>half</b> <b>rate</b> treatments in most cases. Disease levels (septoria) were higher in treatments where <b>half</b> <b>rates</b> were used, compared with the corresponding full rates, but the used of spray additives improved the disease control in the <b>half</b> <b>rate</b> treatments. The timing of spray applications is critical when <b>half</b> <b>rates</b> of fungicides are being used. Reduced rate treatments need to be applied more frequently. In these trials reduced rate treatments were applied as a three-spray programme rather than the conventional two-spray programme.

40|$|A {{common problem}} in GSM {{terminals}} is an interfering signal nicknamed the “Bumblebee”. This interference {{is generated by}} the switching nature of TDMA cellular telephony, the radio circuits are switched on and off with the radio access rate. In GSM, this frequency is approximately 217 Hz, This frequency and its harmonics get into the analog microphone signal, and produce a very annoying periodic noise in the uplink speech. This thesis contains a study of four differerent software solutions, to suppress this interference. These four different methods are denoted, Notch filter, Matched filter, Correlators and Interpolation in frequency. It is shown that the best result is achieved with the Correlatars. Since the frequency comlponents of the Bumblebee are well known, {{it is possible to}} estimate the phase and the amplitude of these with Correlators. This is done by correlating the microphone signal with sinusoids having the same frequencies as the Bumblebee, hence the name Correlators. By generating sinusoids with these phase and amplitude estimates, and then subtracting them from the microphone signal, the Bumblebee is suppressed. Since it is subtracted in the time domain it is also possible to consider a recurring pause in the interference caused by the so called idle frame in the transmission.

Field and laboratory tests were conducted to determine the toxicity of profenofos/cyhalothrin mixtures to larvae of the tobacco budworm, Heliothis virescens (F.). In a field test, full, <b>half,</b> and quarter <b>rate</b> insecticide mixtures of profenofos and cyhalothrin were compared with full and <b>half</b> <b>rates</b> of each insecticide alone. Toxicity data were obtained with susceptible and pyrethroid-resistant first and third instar tobacco budworm larvae. Field data demonstrated that <b>half</b> <b>rate</b> mixtures of profenofos and cyhalothrin provided approximately equal control to full rates of each compound separately with susceptible larvae. With pyrethroid-resistant larvae, the <b>half</b> <b>rate</b> mix worked as well as the full rate of profenofos and much better than the full rate of cyhalothrin. Overall, the <b>half</b> <b>rate</b> mixture of each insecticide worked better on susceptible larvae than on resistant larvae. Cotoxicity values obtained from laboratory bioassays with each insecticide alone and in combination indicate that profenofos and cyhalothrin are acting independently in the mixture with first instars and antagonistically in the mixture with third instars. The data suggest that mixtures of profenofos and cyhalothrin at reduced rates will achieve control comparable to full rates of either insecticide alone. The data also suggest that reduced rate mixtures should be used before a resistance problem arises, not afterwards. That is, mixtures should be used to prevent resistance problems, not cure them...|$|R
