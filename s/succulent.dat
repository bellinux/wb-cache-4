5|$|Cacti {{are present}} in both North and South America with a post-Gondwana origin. Other xerophytic plants have {{developed}} similar strategies by {{a process known as}} convergent evolution. They limit water loss by reducing the size and number of stomata, by having waxy coatings and hairy or tiny leaves. Some are deciduous, shedding their leaves in the driest season, and others curl their leaves up to reduce transpiration. Others store water in <b>succulent</b> leaves or stems or in fleshy tubers. Desert plants maximize water uptake by having shallow roots that spread widely, or by developing long taproots that reach down to deep rock strata for ground water. The saltbush in Australia has <b>succulent</b> leaves and secretes salt crystals, enabling it to live in saline areas. In common with cacti, many have developed spines to ward off browsing animals.|$|E
5|$|The leaf {{blades of}} the summer rosettes of P. moranensis are smooth, rigid, and <b>succulent,</b> varying from bright yellow-green to maroon in colour. The laminae are {{generally}} obovate to orbicular, between 5.5 and 13centimeters (2–5in.) long and supported by a 1 to 3.5centimetre (⅜–1⅜in.) petiole.|$|E
5|$|As a drought-deciduous <b>succulent</b> tree, B. rupestris adapts {{readily to}} {{cultivation}} and is tolerant {{of a range}} of soils and temperatures. It is a key component and emergent tree in the endangered central semi-evergreen vine thickets—also known as bottletree scrub—of the Queensland Brigalow Belt. Remnant trees are often left by farmers on cleared land for their value as shade and fodder trees.|$|E

5|$|In fact, {{building}} a society the Shaftesbury way {{is not a}} matter of imprisoning a presumed evil spirit of mankind. It is a matter of beauty and truth. Both Goethe and Voltaire were influenced by the 3rd Lord Shaftesbury. The former particularly reminded us that we must cultivate our garden. We all know about large prize-winning marrows, but are not <b>succulent</b> baby courgettes more perfect? Small is beautiful too...|$|E
5|$|The dromedary's diet {{consists}} {{mostly of}} foliage, dry grasses and desert vegetation mostly thorny plants. A study said the typical diet of the dromedary is dwarf shrubs (47.5%), trees (29.9%), grasses (11.2%), other herbs (0.2%) and vines (11%). The dromedary {{is primarily a}} browser; forbs and shrubs comprise 70% of its diet in summer and 90% of its diet in winter. The dromedary may also graze on tall, young, <b>succulent</b> grasses.|$|E

5|$|A {{botanical garden}} or botanic garden is a garden {{dedicated}} to the collection, cultivation and display {{of a wide range}} of plants labelled with their botanical names. It may contain specialist plant collections such as cacti and other <b>succulent</b> plants, herb gardens, plants from particular parts of the world, and so on; there may be greenhouses, shadehouses, again with special collections such as tropical plants, alpine plants, or other exotic plants. Visitor services at a botanical garden might include tours, educational displays, art exhibitions, book rooms, open-air theatrical and musical performances, and other entertainment.|$|E
5|$|Common elands are herbivores that browse during drier {{winter months}} but have also adapted to grazing {{during the rainy}} season when grasses are more common. They require a high-protein diet of <b>succulent</b> leaves from {{flowering}} plants but will consume lower quality plant material if available including forbs, trees, shrubs, grasses, seeds and tubers. The eland can conserve water by increasing its body temperature. Grasses the eland eats include Setaria and Themeda and fruits from Securinega and Strychnos. Large antelope can survive on lower quality food in times of little rain. Elands feed during the night in hot weather and sleep for long periods during the day.|$|E
5|$|Lettuce {{was first}} {{cultivated}} {{by the ancient}} Egyptians who turned it from a weed whose seeds were used to produce oil, into a food plant grown for its <b>succulent</b> leaves and oil-rich seeds. Lettuce spread to the Greeks and Romans, the latter of whom gave it the name , from which the English lettuce is ultimately derived. By 50 AD, many types were described, and lettuce appeared often in medieval writings, including several herbals. The 16th through 18th centuries saw the development of many varieties in Europe, and by the mid-18th century cultivars were described that can still be found in gardens.|$|E

50|$|Members of {{the spine}} plant family Cactaceae, native to the Americas, are known as cacti or cactuses. All cacti are <b>succulents</b> - plants which have adapted to arid climate or soil {{conditions}} and store water in their leaves, stems, and/or roots - but not all <b>succulents</b> are cacti. The conservatory’s collection includes cacti genera such as Opuntia, as well as <b>succulents</b> from other genera such as Pachypodium, Haworthia, Agave, Aloe, and Euphorbia. Grown from a cutting taken in 1916, the Jade Tree (Crassula argentea) {{is one of the}} oldest plants in the conservatory.|$|R

5|$|The Gila monster {{is found}} in the Southwestern United States and Mexico, a range {{including}} Sonora, Arizona, parts of California, Nevada, Utah, and New Mexico (potentially including Baja California). They inhabit scrubland, <b>succulent</b> desert, and oak woodland, seeking shelter in burrows, thickets, and under rocks in locations with ready access to moisture. In fact, Gila monsters seem to like water and can be observed immersing themselves in puddles of water after a summer rain. They avoid living in open areas such as flats and farmland.|$|E
5|$|The {{lesser kudu}} browses {{primarily}} at dusk or at dawn, and {{is associated with}} the gerenuk and the impala. The lesser kudu and the gerenuk might compete for evergreen species in the dry season. However, unlike the gerenuk, the lesser kudu rarely prefers Acacia species and does not stand on its hindlegs while feeding. The lesser kudu does not have a great requirement for water, and can browse in arid environments. It eats <b>succulent</b> plants, such as the wild sisal, Sansevieria, and Euphorbia species in the dry season, and drinks water when sources are available.|$|E
5|$|The marsh {{rice rat}} takes both {{vegetable}} and animal food, {{and is more}} carnivorous than most small rodents are; dominant food items vary seasonally. Plants eaten include species of Spartina, Salicornia, Tripsacum, and Elymus, among others; it mainly eats seeds and <b>succulent</b> parts. It prefers Spartina alterniflora that has been fertilized with nitrogen and mainly eats the inner tissue of the stem, perhaps because nitrogen-fertilized plants contain much less dimethylsulfoniopropionate in their inner tissues. The marsh rice rat was a major pest on rice plantations, feeding on the rice when it was newly planted. It also eats the fungus Endogone at times.|$|E

5|$|Impala browse {{as well as}} graze; either may predominate, {{depending}} upon the availability of resources. The diet comprises monocots, dicots, forbs, fruits and acacia pods (whenever available). Impala prefer places close to water sources, and resort to <b>succulent</b> vegetation if water is scarce. An analysis showed that the diet of impala is composed of 45% monocots, 45% dicots and 10% fruits; the proportion of grasses in the diet increases significantly (to as high as 90%) after the first rains, but declines in the dry season. Browsing predominates in the late wet and dry season, and diets are nutritionally poor in the mid-dry season, when impala feed mostly on woody dicots. Another study showed that the dicot proportion in the diet is much higher in bachelors and females than in territorial males.|$|E
5|$|Springbok are {{primarily}} browsers and may switch to grazing occasionally; they feed on shrubs and young succulents (such as Lampranthus species) before they lignify. They prefer grasses such as Themeda triandra. Springbok can meet their water needs {{from the food}} they eat, {{and are able to}} survive without drinking water through dry season. In extreme cases, they do not drink any water over the course of their lives. Springbok may accomplish this by selecting flowers, seeds, and leaves of shrubs before dawn, when the food items are most <b>succulent.</b> In places such as the Etosha National Park, springbok seek out water bodies where they are available. Springbok gather in the wet season and disperse during the dry season, unlike other African mammals.|$|E
5|$|Stems mainly {{provide support}} to the leaves and {{reproductive}} structures, but can store water in <b>succulent</b> plants such as cacti, food as in potato tubers, or reproduce vegetatively as in the stolons of strawberry plants or {{in the process of}} layering. Leaves gather sunlight and carry out photosynthesis. Large, flat, flexible, green leaves are called foliage leaves. Gymnosperms, such as conifers, cycads, Ginkgo, and gnetophytes are seed-producing plants with open seeds. Angiosperms are seed-producing plants that produce flowers and have enclosed seeds. Woody plants, such as azaleas and oaks, undergo a secondary growth phase resulting in two additional types of tissues: wood (secondary xylem) and bark (secondary phloem and cork). All gymnosperms and many angiosperms are woody plants. Some plants reproduce sexually, some asexually, and some via both means.|$|E
