25|$|In {{the context}} of the social web, {{engagement}} means that customers and stakeholders, such as consumer advocacy groups and groups that criticize companies (e.g., lobby groups or advocacy organizations) are active participants rather than passive viewers. <b>Social</b> <b>media</b> <b>use</b> in a business or political context allows all consumers/citizens to express and share an opinion about a company's products, services or business practices, or a government's actioins. Each participating customer or non-customer (or citizen) who is participating online via social media becomes part of the marketing department (or a challenge to the marketing effort), as other customers read their positive or negative comments or reviews. Getting consumers and potential consumers (or citizens) to be engaged online is fundamental to successful social media marketing. With the advent of social media marketing, it has become increasingly important to gain customer interest in products and services, which can eventually be translated into buying behavior (or voting or donating behavior in a political context). New online marketing concepts of engagement and loyalty have emerged which aim to build customer participation and brand reputation.|$|E

40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2016. Includes bibliographical references. Despite its {{theoretical}} relevance, {{the notion}} of <b>social</b> <b>media</b> affordances has not permeated <b>social</b> <b>media</b> <b>uses</b> and gratifications studies. This {{has resulted in a}} need for research that focuses on developing affordance-based measures and testing them across user populations. Recognizing this need, Sundar (2008) and Sundar and Limperos (2013) suggested an affordance-based conceptual framework, known as the MAIN model, which can help develop potential measures of new <b>media</b> <b>uses</b> and gratifications. This study used the MAIN framework to develop an affordance-based scale for <b>social</b> <b>media</b> <b>uses</b> and gratifications and used it to characterize political actors, particularly dissidents and allegiants, and individuals with different levels of political tolerance and dogmatism. The first phase of the study focused on developing the <b>social</b> <b>media</b> <b>uses</b> and gratifications scale, using a convenience sample of 393 university students. The results of the first phase supported the conceptual accuracy of the MAIN model, indicating that conceptualizing <b>social</b> <b>media</b> <b>uses</b> and gratifications as a second-order factor structure that classifies <b>social</b> <b>media</b> <b>uses</b> and gratifications constructs into four different types of affordances (Modality, Agency, Interactivity, and Navigability) does not jeopardize the statistical validity of measures. The scale developed in the first phase was applied in the second phase to examine <b>social</b> <b>media</b> <b>uses</b> and gratifications that can characterize political actor types and levels of political dogmatism and tolerance. A sample of 313 American citizens above the age of 18, collected through a professional data collection service, was used to test five discriminant models to achieve this goal. The first three discriminant models showed that <b>social</b> <b>media</b> <b>uses</b> and gratifications can be used to classify political actor types with nearly 70 % accuracy. However, the results painted a nuanced picture, indicating that <b>social</b> <b>media</b> <b>uses</b> and gratifications can describe differences as well as similarities between potential political dissidents and allegiants. While Realism, Coolness, and Agency-enhancement gratifications were common among dissidents and allegiants, dissidents showed significantly lower Filtering than allegiants. The fourth and fifth discriminant models also had more than 70 % classification accuracy. According the last two models, uses and gratifications, such as Realism and Play, can characterize dogmatism, and Coolness, Filtering, and Browsing can indicate high political tolerance. The contribution of this dissertation research is two-fold. First, it suggests a potential affordance-based <b>social</b> <b>media</b> <b>uses</b> and gratifications scale {{that can be used in}} future research. Second, it suggests that, as opposed to the utopian perspective that <b>social</b> <b>media</b> are ideal platforms for alternative politics, they can cater to individuals engaged in both anti- and pro-system politics as well as politically dogmatic users...|$|R

With continued variations to <b>social</b> <b>media</b> practices, developments in technology, and changes in online behaviors, it is imperative to provide conceptual frameworks which are relevant, current and insightful. This paper conceptualizes a range of recent literature through an inductive methodology, and presents the themes of Web accessibility and online information reliability as broad and emerging considerations for the identification of <b>social</b> <b>media</b> <b>uses</b> during disasters. It presents a new conceptual framework of current <b>social</b> <b>media</b> <b>uses</b> which may be used to supplement existing frameworks. The framework has been applied to a dataset of Tweets from the 2015 Nepal earthquake to demonstrate its validity. Suggestions for future applications are discussed...|$|R

5000|$|Observers {{have noted}} {{a range of}} {{positive}} and negative impacts of <b>social</b> <b>media</b> <b>use.</b> Social media can help to improve individuals' sense of connectedness with real or online communities and social media can be an effective communication (or marketing) tool for corporations, entrepreneurs, nonprofit organizations, including advocacy groups and political parties and governments. At the same time, concerns have been raised about possible links between heavy <b>social</b> <b>media</b> <b>use</b> and depression, and even the issues of cyberbullying, online harassment and [...] "trolling". Currently, about half of young adults have been cyberbullied and of those, 20 percent said that they have been cyberbullied regularly.

According to this study, 69 percent of 7th grade students claim to have experienced cyberbullying and they also said that it is worse than face to face bullying.|$|E
