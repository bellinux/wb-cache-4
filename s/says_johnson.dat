2500|$|Historians have debated {{just why}} Johnson quit {{a few days}} after his weak showing in New Hampshire. Jeff Shesol <b>says</b> <b>Johnson</b> wanted out of the White House but also wanted vindication; when the {{indicators}} turned negative he decided to leave. Lewis L. Gould maintains that Johnson had neglected the party, was hurting it by his Vietnam policies, and underestimated McCarthy's strength until the very last minute, when {{it was too late for}} Johnson to recover. Randall Bennett Woods said Johnson realized he needed to leave in order for the nation to heal. [...] Robert Dallek writes that Johnson had no further domestic goals, and realized that his personality had eroded his popularity. [...] His health was not good, and he was preoccupied with the Kennedy campaign; his wife was pressing for his retirement and his base of support continued to shrink. [...] Leaving the race would allow him to pose as a peacemaker. [...] Anthony J.

6000|$|However fretted {{by these}} teasing and almost humiliating discussions, Dryden {{continued}} steadily advancing in his great labour; and {{about three years}} after it had been undertaken, the translation of Virgil, [...] "the most noble and spirited," [...] said Pope, [...] "which I know in any language," [...] {{was given to the}} public in July 1697. So eager was the general expectation, that the first edition was exhausted in a few months, and a second published early in the next year. [...] "It satisfied," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Johnson,</b> [...] "his friends, and, for the most part, silenced his enemies." [...] But, although this was generally the case, there wanted not some to exercise the invidious task of criticism, or rather of malevolent detraction. Among those, the highest name is that of Swift; the most distinguished for venomous and persevering malignity, that of Milbourne.|$|E

5000|$|In 2002, {{historian}} Castel took a stern view of Johnson's presidency, <b>saying</b> <b>Johnson</b> [...] "suffered {{from serious}} defects {{of mind and}} character." [...] According to Castel, Johnson [...] "lacked flexibility and adroitness" [...] and made hasty decisions without foresight. Castel said Johnson's presidency failed because Johnson was a Democrat who led a government controlled by Northern Republicans. Since Johnson was not elected President, he lacked political and moral authority over Congress. Johnson never realized that the Civil War was a revolution and that federal power had superseded state rights. Additionally Johnson believed blacks were inferior to whites, a common view for most white Americans during his presidency. Although Johnson had gained the highest office [...] "he proved incapable of using it in an effective and beneficial manner." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{have kept}} {{to the plan}} sketched out by Mr. Croker. [...] "A commentary," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Johnson,</b> [...] "must arise from the fortuitous discoveries of many men in devious walks of literature," [...] and few poets have had more {{commentators}} than Pope. I have borrowed whatever I met with in previous writers that throw light upon his meaning, faults, and beauties, have cast aside what was plainly inapplicable and erroneous, and have done what I could to fill up deficiencies. My own notes will be recognised {{by the absence of}} any signature; all other notes throughout the work have the names of their authors attached, even when a note is by the same author as the text. The extracts from Warton are sometimes taken from his Essay, and both in his case and that of Bowles I have occasionally joined together scattered fragments which were connected in their subject. The rest of the arrangements will be understood at a glance.|$|E
6000|$|The {{appearance}} of The Traveler at once altered Goldsmith's intellectual {{standing in the}} estimation of society; but its effect upon the club, if we may judge from the account given by Hawkins, was most ludicrous. They were lost in astonishment that a [...] "newspaper essayist" [...] and [...] "bookseller's, drudge" [...] should have written such a poem. On the evening of its announcement to them Goldsmith had gone away early, after [...] "rattling away as usual," [...] and they knew not how to reconcile his heedless garrulity with the serene beauty, the easy grace, the sound good sense, and the occasional elevation of his poetry. They could scarcely believe that such magic numbers had flowed from a man to whom in general, <b>says</b> <b>Johnson,</b> [...] "it was with difficulty they could give a hearing." [...] "Well", exclaimed Chamier, [...] "I do believe he wrote this poem himself, and, let me tell you, that is believing a great deal." ...|$|E
6000|$|The extreme flattery of Dryden's dedications {{has been}} objected to him, as a fault of an {{opposite}} description; and perhaps no writer has equalled {{him in the}} profusion and elegance of his adulation. [...] "Of this kind of meanness," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Johnson,</b> [...] "he never seems to decline the practice, or lament the necessity. He considers the great as entitled to encomiastic homage, and brings praise rather as a tribute than a gift; more delighted with the fertility of his invention than mortified by the prostitution of his judgment." [...] It may be noticed, in palliation of this heavy charge, that the form of address to superiors must be judged of by the manners of the times; and that the adulation contained in dedications was then as {{much a matter of}} course, as the words of submissive style which still precede the subscription Dryden considered his panegyrics as merely conforming with the fashion of the day, and rendering unto Caesar the things which were Caesar's,--attended with no more degradation than the payment of any other tribute to the forms of politeness and usage of the world.|$|E

6000|$|The {{deception}} which Pope practised {{was never}} suspected till {{it was revealed}} by his correspondence with Lord Oxford, which has hitherto remained in manuscript. The repetition of the attempt on a more elaborate scale was less successful, and {{it has always been}} believed by the immense majority of inquirers that the promulgation of the collection of 1735, which the poet vehemently denounced as an act of intolerable treachery, was from first to last his own deed. [...] "It seems," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Johnson,</b> [...] "that Pope being desirous of printing his letters, and not knowing how to do, without imputation of vanity, what has in this country been done very rarely, contrived an appearance of compulsion, that when he could complain that his letters were surreptitiously published, he might decently and defensively publish them himself."[23] Fresh facts have rendered the evidence against him stronger than ever, and the whole derives increased force from the information we now possess that he had previously had recourse to a kindred falsehood. In the first case he made a tool of a friend; in the second, he varied his plan, and made a tool of an enemy.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{received}} one morning," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Johnson,</b> [...] "a message from poor Goldsmith {{that he was}} in great distress, and, as it was not in his power to come to me, begging that I would come to him as soon as possible. I sent him a guinea, and promised to come to him directly. I accordingly went as soon as I was dressed, and found that his landlady had arrested him for his rent, at which he was in a violent passion: I perceived that he had already changed my guinea, and had a bottle of Madeira and a glass before him. I put the cork into the bottle, desired he would be calm, and began to talk to him of the means by which he might be extricated. He then told me he had a novel ready for the press, which he produced to me. I looked into it and saw its merit; told the landlady I should soon return; and, having gone to a bookseller, sold it for sixty pounds. I brought Goldsmith the money, and he discharged his rent, not without rating his landlady in a high tone for having used him go ill." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Delany, {{who was the}} niece of Lord Lansdowne, {{and lived}} with him in her youth, says, in her Autobiography, {{that he was a}} man of an open unsuspecting temper, that he had the {{greatest}} politeness and good-humour imaginable, that he was magnificent in his nature, and wasted his fortune to gratify his passion for display.[6] His predominant characteristics were amiability and vanity. His love of distinction incited him to become a dramatist, poet, and politician. He had aspirations without ability, and in none of these capacities did he exhibit any vigour of mind. His poetry was an imitation of Waller, [...] "of whom," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Johnson,</b> [...] "he copied the faults, and very little more."[7] His plays reflect the worst qualities of the era of Charles II. In tragedy he thought that to be dull and stately was to be classical; in comedy that affected briskness of dialogue was liveliness, and indecent double meanings wit. He made no figure in politics, and owed his posts in the Harley administration to his wealth, family, and electioneering influence. His literature, aided by his hereditary advantages, sufficed to procure him a factitious fame while he lived, but his reputation was at an end the moment his works lost the lustre they derived from his social position.|$|E

50|$|On September 17, 1867, Colfax {{addressed}} a Republican meeting in Lebanon, New York {{on the political}} situation in Washington. Colfax said he was firmly against {{those who participated in}} the Confederate rebellion to be reinstated in office and control Republican Reconstruction policy. Colfax affirmed that he was not in any way for repudiating the debt caused by the Confederate rebellion. Colfax said Congressional reconstruction would give security and peace to the nation as opposed to President Johnson and his southern Democratic policies. Colfax favored Johnson's impeachment <b>saying</b> <b>Johnson</b> was recreant, an upsurper, and was unfaithful in executing the Reconstruction laws of the land in granting a general amnesty to all Southerners who participated in the Civil War. Colfax told Republicans who were tired of Reconstruction to leave the party and join the Democrats.|$|R
