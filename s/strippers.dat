40|$|Sheet {{metal cutting}} with {{punch and die}} is one of most {{fundamental}} processes in sheet metal presswork, and in many modern tools such as progression tooling a sprung <b>stripper</b> is used to help the punch withdraw from the strip after separation. The vast quantity of practical information which is available about the cutting process does not document whether {{the use of a}} spring <b>stripper</b> affects the cutting process. In this work, a tool with a sprung <b>stripper</b> was modified so that the sprung <b>stripper</b> was held back from the strip. Burr height readings were taken before and after the modification, as were electron micrographs of the cut edge. These were compared to determine the effect, if any, that a sprung <b>stripper</b> would have on the proportions of shear and tensile fracture and the burr height formed. When a sprung <b>stripper</b> was used, maximum burr was half as high as without. Process consistency was over twice as good with a sprung <b>stripper.</b> When a sprung <b>stripper</b> was used,, burr was found to protrude into the hole which did not happen otherwise. With a sprung <b>stripper,</b> there were more patches of secondary shear fracture than with no <b>stripper</b> contact. It is suggested that the use of a sprung <b>stripper</b> altered the path of tensile fracture and the amount of drawing in of the strip during cutting, thus altering the burr height and width.

40|$|Abstract. Compound dies {{are widely}} used for {{production}} of pierced blanks with high accuracy. <b>Stripper</b> {{is one of the}} major components of a compound die. In this paper, research work involved in the selection, modeling and prediction of life of <b>stripper</b> of compound die is presented. Knowledge based system (KBS) approach is used for selection of size of <b>stripper.</b> The knowledge base is constructed through coding of production rules of IF-THEN variety in AutoLISP language. Further, a CAD system is developed for automatic modeling of <b>stripper</b> of compound die. This CAD system works in conjunction with the KBS developed for selection of <b>stripper.</b> An artificial neural network (ANN) model is developed for prediction of life of <b>stripper.</b> Various factors affecting life of <b>stripper</b> are investigated through FEM analysis and the critical simulation values are determined. The proposed ANN model is trained by using FEM simulation results. The proposed work is tested successfully on different sheet metal parts taken from stamping industries. A sample run is also demonstrated in this paper...|$|R
5|$|By 2011, {{several of}} the <b>strippers</b> JC's Girls members had spoken with in San Diego had begun {{attending}} a Bible study hosted by the organization and the chapter had helped one stripper leave the sex industry and gain unrelated employment. In March 2011, the chapter sent a delegation to Adultcon at the Los Angeles Convention Center, where Scher and Brown spoke with conference attendees and offered them prayer. That July, Veitch resigned from JC's Girls so she could {{spend more time with}} her family, handing the leadership of the organization to Scher and Brown. In June 2012, Scher gave up her co-leadership of the organization to focus on her family, leaving the leadership to Brown. By 2013, the organization had established guidelines regulating the transition of women from the sex industry into participation in the evangelistic activities of JC's Girls. The woman must consistently attend a Bible study for four months, read Francine Rivers' book Redeeming Love, and be interviewed by the chapter's leaders, who then decide whether the woman should join the organization's outreach team. These guidelines were established because some women who had quickly gone from working in the sex industry to evangelizing with JC's Girls soon left the organization and returned to the sex industry. Brown left JC's Girls in April 2014 and Laura Bonde took over leadership of the organization.|$|E
5|$|When {{thermoplastics}} are moulded, typically pelletised {{raw material}} is fed through a hopper into a heated barrel with a reciprocating screw. Upon {{entrance to the}} barrel, the temperature increases and the Van der Waals forces that resist relative flow of individual chains are weakened {{as a result of}} increased space between molecules at higher thermal energy states. This process reduces its viscosity, which enables the polymer to flow with the driving force of the injection unit. The screw delivers the raw material forward, mixes and homogenises the thermal and viscous distributions of the polymer, and reduces the required heating time by mechanically shearing the material and adding a significant amount of frictional heating to the polymer. The material feeds forward through a check valve and collects {{at the front of the}} screw into a volume known as a shot. A shot is the volume of material that is used to fill the mould cavity, compensate for shrinkage, and provide a cushion (approximately 10% of the total shot volume, which remains in the barrel and prevents the screw from bottoming out) to transfer pressure from the screw to the mould cavity. When enough material has gathered, the material is forced at high pressure and velocity into the part forming cavity. To prevent spikes in pressure, the process normally uses a transfer position corresponding to a 95–98% full cavity where the screw shifts from a constant velocity to a constant pressure control. Often injection times are well under 1 second. Once the screw reaches the transfer position the packing pressure is applied, which completes mould filling and compensates for thermal shrinkage, which is quite high for thermoplastics relative to many other materials. The packing pressure is applied until the gate (cavity entrance) solidifies. Due to its small size, the gate is normally the first place to solidify through its entire thickness. Once the gate solidifies, no more material can enter the cavity; accordingly, the screw reciprocates and acquires material for the next cycle while the material within the mould cools so that it can be ejected and be dimensionally stable. This cooling duration is dramatically reduced by the use of cooling lines circulating water or oil from an external temperature controller. Once the required temperature has been achieved, the mould opens and an array of pins, sleeves, <b>strippers,</b> etc. are driven forward to demould the article. Then, the mould closes and the process is repeated.|$|E

A comparison between pressure profiles obtained for different geometries shows a clear improvement of the vacuum conditions outside the <b>stripper</b> housing for the smallest conductance pipes between the <b>stripper</b> system and the accelerator tubes. These improvements are also well reflected in the charge state distribution measurements, as a higher mean charge state is obtained under the same vacuum conditions in the accelerator tubes for the improved <b>stripper</b> system in comparison with the former mechanical design.
