500|$|Riley {{moved to}} Indianapolis {{at the end}} of 1879 to begin his {{employment}} with the Journal. It was the only metropolitan newspaper in Indianapolis with daily editions, and had wide readership. For the newspaper he wrote a regular society column that often included verses of poetry. Thereafter Riley met many prominent people, and began a close friendship with Eugene V. Debs. Debs enjoyed Riley's works and often complimented his sentiments.

500|$|Boycott captained Yorkshire {{for eight}} seasons from 1971 to 1978, having been {{appointed}} following the sacking of Brian Close in 1970. Despite well publicised {{conflict between the}} two players, Boycott recorded in 1987 that he regretted Close's removal from the club, and wrote him a letter in admiration for his contributions to Yorkshire. To captain Yorkshire {{had been one of}} Boycott's aims <b>since</b> <b>he</b> <b>started</b> county cricket in 1962. Yorkshire's scorer Ted Lester commented later that Boycott [...] "never got the support he deserved from the committee. After the captaincy was decided on a casting vote, the half that didn't want him never wanted him." [...] Some members of the committee wanted to remove him almost immediately. He also caused strife between his fellow players, including a reciprocated dislike for Richard Hutton, with many players leaving the club citing personal differences with Boycott as the reason for their departure.|$|E

500|$|Alguersuari, who {{qualified}} eleventh, was {{the fastest}} driver not {{advancing to the}} final session. His best time of 1:47.666 was 1.8 seconds slower than Vettel's pace in the second session. Alguersuari's time was followed by Hülkenberg, who was backed up by Sutil on his first run in the second session, and described his car's balance like [...] "night and day". However, Hülkenberg was demoted five positions on the grid after the Williams team changed his gearbox after the race at Monza. As a consequence, Petrov inherited 12th position having pushed hard {{on a set of}} option tyres. He had lost control of his car after he went deep, under braking, heading for turn five (a corner that was damp from the earlier rain shower), with his right-rear wheel hitting the wall. Petrov's crash meant he took no further part in qualifying. He was ahead of Buemi, in the slower of the two Torro Rossos, who lost a large amount of grip and got stuck in traffic. Heidfeld took 14th ahead of his fellow countryman Sutil in 15th. Liuzzi had a problem with his front brakes on the first run of the second session and managed 16th. Timo Glock, Heikki Kovalainen and Lucas di Grassi were the quickest drivers unable to advance beyond the first part of qualifying. The eleventh row of the grid was filled by Jarno Trulli and Klien. Senna took 23rd. Massa was unable to set a timed lap as his gearbox seized without warning forcing him to stop on the circuit; Ferrari chose to replace his engine and gearbox as a precaution. Massa's engine change was his ninth of the season which incurred a ten-place grid penalty, but <b>since</b> <b>he</b> <b>started</b> from 24th position, the penalty was nullified.|$|E
2500|$|Xun You {{was known}} for being a highly {{profound}} and insightful thinker {{who was able to}} hide secrets very well. <b>Since</b> <b>he</b> <b>started</b> accompanying Cao Cao on his military campaigns, he has often helped Cao devise and develop strategic plans. Many people, including his family members and relatives, hardly knew what was on his mind or what he had said. The Wei Shu recorded that Xin Tao (辛韜), a maternal cousin of Xun You, once asked Xun You on why he urged Cao Cao to attack Ji Province. Xun You replied, [...] "Since Zuozhi has come on behalf of Yuan Tan to surrender, it's expected that the Imperial Army will go there to pacify the area. How would I know why?" [...] Xin Tao and others did not dare to ask Xun You again about state and military affairs after that.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005 Kookaburra {{released}} {{a new type}} of bat that had a Carbon fibre-reinforced polymer support down the spine of the bat. [...] It was put on the bat to provide more support to the spine and blade of the bat, thus prolonging the life of the bat. [...] The first player to use this new bat in international cricket was Australian Ricky Ponting. [...] However this innovation in cricketing technology was controversially banned by the ICC as they were advised by the MCC that it unfairly gave more power in the shot and was unfair in competition, as not all players had access to this new technology. [...] But this was not taken lightly by Australian media as Ponting had scored plenty of runs <b>since</b> <b>he</b> <b>started</b> to use his new bat and English reporters had blamed this success on the new, 'unfair' piece of technology in his bat.|$|E

2500|$|Richard Cohen responded via {{his regular}} Washington Post column {{published}} on February 6, 2007. Cohen {{noted that he}} has dedicated more than 90 columns to condemning antisemitism <b>since</b> <b>he</b> <b>started</b> as a columnist in 1976, [...] "most of them full-throated condemnations of the hatred that killed fully one-third of all Jews during my lifetime. So it comes as a surprise that has {{the force of a}} mugging to be accused of aiding the very people I so hate – of being an abettor of something called The New Anti-Semitism." [...] Cohen wrote that the report [...] "has given license to the most intolerant and narrow-minded of Israel's defenders so that, as the AJC concedes in my case, any veering from orthodoxy is met with censure or, from someone like Reinharz, the most powerful of all post-Holocaust condemnations – anti-Semite – is diluted beyond recognition. The offense here is not just to a handful of relatively unimportant writers, but to memory itself." ...|$|E

6000|$|I {{think his}} fingers shook a little, but Martin Lorimer was not {{addicted}} to much display of sentiment, {{and with a}} cough he hurried away; though I remember that the old cashier, who had served him <b>since</b> <b>he</b> <b>started,</b> putting a sealed envelope in my hand, said: ...|$|E
60|$|For {{the first}} time <b>since</b> <b>he</b> <b>started</b> out, Fenn was {{conscious}} of a tremor.
