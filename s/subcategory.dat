5|$|A {{phosphatase}} is {{an enzyme}} that uses water to cleave a phosphoric acid monoester into a phosphate ion and an alcohol. Because a phosphatase enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of its substrate, it is a <b>subcategory</b> of hydrolases. Phosphatase enzymes {{are essential to}} many biological functions, because phosphorylation (e.g. by protein kinases) and dephosphorylation (by phosphatases) serve diverse roles in cellular regulation and signaling.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} closed hereditary additive and divisible (AD) <b>subcategories</b> of epireflective <b>subcategories</b> of the category Top. In quotient reflective <b>subcategories</b> of Top, AD <b>subcategories</b> are precisely the core-flective <b>subcategories.</b> We describe the closed hereditary AD hull and the closed hereditary AD kernel of AD <b>subcategories</b> and present some results concerning min-imal non-trivial closed hereditary AD <b>subcategories</b> in epireflective <b>subcategories</b> of Top.

5|$|PEV is a <b>subcategory</b> of {{electric}} vehicles that includes battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid vehicles, (PHEVs), and electric vehicle conversions of hybrid electric vehicles and conventional {{internal combustion engine}} vehicles. Even though conventional hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) have a battery that is continually recharged with power from {{the internal combustion engine}} and regenerative braking, they can not be recharged from an off-vehicle electric energy source, and therefore, they do not belong to the category of plug-in electric vehicles.|$|E
5|$|The {{myths and}} legends {{surrounding}} Cofresí {{fall into two}} categories: those portraying him as a generous thief or anti-hero and those describing him as overwhelmingly evil. A <b>subcategory</b> represents him as an adventurer, world traveler or womanizer. Reports by historians such as Tió of the pirate sharing his loot with the needy have evolved into a detailed mythology. These apologetics attempt to justify his piracy, blaming it on poverty, revenge or a desire to restore his family's honor, and portray Cofresí as a class hero defying official inequality and corruption. He {{is said to have}} been a protector and benefactor of children, women and the elderly, with some accounts describing him as a rebel hero and supporter of independence from imperial power.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{competing}} notions {{of a wide}} <b>subcategory.</b> One version is that C contains every object of A (up to isomorphism); for a full <b>subcategory</b> this is obviously not interesting.

Diers {{has defined}} multireflective <b>subcategories</b> as a {{generalization}} of reflective <b>subcategories.</b> In this paper, the related concepts of multiepireflective and monomultireflective <b>subcategories</b> are defined and investigated. It is proved that, for categories with appropriate (E,M) factorization structures, every multireflection {{can be expressed}} as the composition of an epireflection followed by a multiepireflection. Characterizations of multi-E-reflective <b>subcategories</b> are also given for categories with (E,M) -factorization structures.
