50|$|The <b>steering</b> <b>rack</b> has {{a bearing}} {{situated}} at the yoke - the interface between the <b>steering</b> <b>rack</b> and the <b>steering</b> column. The yoke is designed to prevent {{the separation of the}} <b>steering</b> <b>rack</b> from the <b>steering</b> column, whilst allowing the <b>steering</b> <b>rack</b> to move freely the in transverse direction. The yoke determines a motorist’s ability to feel the road surface and the vehicle’s maneuverability. With their PTFE liner, composite bearings reduce friction in the steering yoke.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{deals with}} the stress {{analysis}} of <b>Steering</b> <b>Rack.</b> <b>Steering</b> <b>Rack</b> Bending CAE analysis technology is indispensable for developing and mass-producing the Steering Gear assembly. By using Finite Element method, a stress analysis has been carried out. <b>Steering</b> <b>Rack</b> Deflection and Bending stresses are found. These stresses are compared with analytical results. Comparison study shows good agreement of analytical results and CAE results. Modeling {{has been done by}} Creo 1. 0 and Analysis has been done by Creo Simulation...|$|R

The car's system also integrated a C32 <b>steering</b> <b>rack</b> and adopted a formula-pinion. In May 1985, the Grand Touring Limited edition was released.|$|R
50|$|Up {{until early}} 2012, Perodua had not issued any recalls of the Alza. In May 2012, Perodua issued a recall order {{for both the}} Alza and its first-generation pre-facelifted {{hatchback}} MyVi for an extension of an air-conditioning pipe that previously could cause rust on the <b>steering</b> <b>rack.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{square-shaped}} {{rear wheel}} arches became rounded in January 1972. Also in this year, a Triumph <b>steering</b> <b>rack</b> was fitted, giving a gearing that was somewhat lower than earlier Midgets. A second exhaust silencer was also added in 1972. Alternators were fitted instead of dynamos (generators) from 1973 onwards.|$|R
5000|$|... 2006 Impreza WRX models {{gained some}} chassis and braking system enhancements. On sedan models, {{aluminum}} front suspension lower A-arms reduced unsprung weight. (The rear suspension gained forward aluminum lateral links in the 2005 model year.) The <b>steering</b> <b>rack</b> was updated for improved steering feel and the <b>steering</b> <b>rack</b> ratio {{was changed to}} 15.0:1. On all WRX models, 7-spoke 17 x 7 in aluminum-alloy wheels replaced the previous 5 spoke 16 x 6.5 in wheels. Tires were 215/45ZR17 versus 205/55R16 before. The more powerful brake system employed 11.5 in vented front discs and four-piston calipers instead of the previous versions two-piston calipers. The rear brakes were 11.3 in ventilated discs replacing the previous 10.3 in solid discs, and two-piston calipers replacing single-piston calipers. The calipers are painted red with the SUBARU name in white overlain.|$|R

50|$|Later versions, called Super HICAS, {{moved to}} an {{electric}} actuator for the rear <b>steering</b> <b>rack,</b> making the system much lighter. The Super HICAS system also used its own computer {{to control the}} system instead of speed sensors. HICAS and Super HICAS rear wheel steering is limited to about 10 degrees in either direction.|$|R

50|$|<b>Rack</b> and pinion <b>steering</b> may be {{susceptible}} to kickback, as the <b>steering</b> <b>rack</b> transmits forces in either direction. A steering box design, such as worm and sector or recirculating ball, {{is much less}} sensitive. Despite this, the other advantages of <b>rack</b> and pinion <b>steering</b> have led to its almost universal adoption, at least for light automobiles.|$|R
50|$|At the {{qualifying}} of the Hungaroring race, ART {{cars were}} disqualified for illegal position of their <b>steering</b> <b>rack.</b> They {{were sent to}} back of the grid but it didn't stop them taking point finishes in feature and 1-2 in the sprint, where Alexandre Prémat won his first race. Neel Jani joined the winners' list in the feature race.|$|R
50|$|The front {{suspension}} is also {{combined with}} a steering mechanism allowing the front wheels to turn. The <b>steering</b> <b>rack</b> {{is the same as}} the one on vintage mini coopers which was chosen due to its high performance and ease of implementation. Ackermann steering geometries were incorporated resulting in a vehicle which handles superbly well despite its unusual shape.|$|R
50|$|The front {{suspension}} {{used the}} spindles and disc brake assemblies of the Ford Cortina mk4/5, with bespoke wishbones and coil over dampers. The Ford Escort mk2 supplied the <b>rack</b> and pinion <b>steering</b> <b>rack.</b> At the rear, the donor Moto Guzzi or Honda motorcycle suspension was used with its twin coil over dampers, brakes, and transfer case.|$|R
50|$|BuyAutoParts.com {{was founded}} in 1989 as a {{steering}} parts manufacturer and auto part distributor. In 2002 the company launched their website and by 2009 online sales made up half of total sales. Today the company receives 90 percent of its business from a targeted set of product lines, which include replacement turbochargers, air conditioning parts, <b>steering</b> <b>racks,</b> and suspension components.|$|R
50|$|Ball screws {{are used}} in {{aircraft}} and missiles to move control surfaces, especially for electric fly by wire, and in automobile power steering to translate rotary motion from an electric motor to axial motion of the <b>steering</b> <b>rack.</b> They are also used in machine tools, robots and precision assembly equipment. High precision ball screws {{are used in}} steppers for semiconductor manufacturing.|$|R
50|$|The Walkinshaw protest was {{countered by}} DJR team manager Neal Lowe who protested the three HSV team Holden Commodores, calling on his {{knowledge}} of the Commodore from his time with the old Holden Dealer Team in 1986.

50|$|The team {{entered the}} GP2 series {{when it was}} {{launched}} for 2005. Two fifth places were the best results that year. The team opened 2006 with a podium at Valencia for Adrian Valles, but neither he nor fellow Spaniard Félix Porteiro scored another podium all year (Portiero was second on the road at Silverstone, but a <b>steering</b> <b>rack</b> irregularity caused him to be disqualified).|$|R
50|$|The iQ {{features}} a transmissions differential housing located ahead of, rather than behind, the engine; a starter motor {{incorporated in the}} engine's flywheel, a high-mounted <b>steering</b> <b>rack</b> and a compact, high-located air conditioning unit behind the dashboard central area. The arrangement allows the front passenger to sit forward of the driver, giving increased rear passenger legroom. A shallow under-floor fuel tank reduces rear overhang.|$|R
