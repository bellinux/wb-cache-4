40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} motivational {{mechanism}} to generate and determine the worth of goals and to represent various constraints involved in sat-isfying a goal. The work builds on the SMART agent framework and adds to the growing body of work that is attempting to extend the abilities of autonomous agents past {{the constraints of the}} traditional symbolic approaches to AI. The pa-per represents a first step in increasing an agent’s autonomy in the domain of e-commerce, specifically enabling the agent to dynamically <b>set</b> <b>issue</b> parameters in relation to the importance of the issue and the effects of any existing constraints. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a procedure for estimating the basic dimensions underlying {{a set of}} issue or attribute scales. A simple Hinich-Ordeshook spatial theory of voting is used to model Converse's fundamental insight that individuals' positions on issues are bundled together, and the knowledge {{of one or two}} issue positions makes the remaining positions very predictable. The model assumes that individuals' positions on a <b>set</b> <b>issue</b> or attribute dimensions are determined by the individuals' positions on a small number of underlying evaluative or basic dimensions. The procedure developed in this paper for estimating these basic dimensions is, in effect, a method of performing singular value decomposition of a matrix with missing elements. Monte Carlo testing shows that the procedure reliably reproduces the missing elements. Because of this reliability, the estimation procedure can be used to produce Eckart-Young matrix lower rank approximations. A number of applications to political data are [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of {{computer}} technologies and the ad-vent of the World Wide Web have increased the amount and the complexity of multimedia information. A content-based image retrieval (CBIR) system has been developed as an ef-ficient image retrieval tool, whereby the user can provide their query to the system {{to allow it to}} retrieve the user’s desired image from the image database. However, the tradi-tional relevance feedback of CBIR has some limitations that will decrease the performance of the CBIR system, such as the imbalance oftraining-set problem, classification prob-lem, limited information from user problem, and insuffi-cient trainingset problem. Therefore, in this study, we pro-posed an enhanced relevance-feedback method to support the user query based on the representative image selection and weight ranking of the images retrieved. The support vector machine (SVM) has been used to support the learn-ing process to reduce the semantic gap between the user and the CBIR system. From these experiments, the proposed learning method has enabled users to improve their search results based on the performance of CBIR system. In addi-tion, the experiments also proved that by solving the imbal-ance training <b>set</b> <b>issue,</b> the performance of CBIR could be improved...|$|E
40|$|While the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) - based Nearest-Neighbor Classification {{algorithm}} {{is regarded as}} a strong baseline for time series classification, in recent years there has been a plethora of algorithms that have claimed to be able to improve upon its accuracy in the general case. Many of these proposed ideas sacrifice the simplicity of implementation that DTW-based classifiers offer for rather modest gains. Nevertheless, there are clearly times when even a small improvement could make a large difference in an important medical or financial domain. In this work, we make an unexpected claim; an underappreciated “low hanging fruit” in optimizing DTW’s performance can produce improvements that make it an even stronger baseline, closing most or all the improvement gap of the more sophisticated methods. We show that the method currently used to learn DTW’s only parameter, the maximum amount of warping allowed, is likely to give the wrong answer for small training sets. We introduce a simple method to mitigate the small training <b>set</b> <b>issue</b> by creating synthetic exemplars to help learn the parameter. We evaluate our ideas on the UCR Time Series Archive and a case study in fall classification, and demonstrate that our algorithm produces significant improvement in classification accuracy...|$|E
