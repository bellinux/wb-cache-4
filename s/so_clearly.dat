5|$|As we {{understand}} the situation here, the Australian Constitution firmly places the prerogative powers of the Crown {{in the hands of}} the Governor-General as the representative of the Queen of Australia. The only person competent to commission an Australian Prime Minister is the Governor-General, and The Queen has no part in the decisions which the Governor-General must take in accordance with the Constitution. Her Majesty, as Queen of Australia, is watching events in Canberra with close interest and attention, but it would not be proper for her to intervene in person in matters which are <b>so</b> <b>clearly</b> placed within the jurisdiction of the Governor-General by the Constitution Act.|$|E
5|$|Her death caused {{reactions}} {{not just}} within Saskatchewan and the curling community, but also across the country. Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien {{said in a}} statement: All Canadians have been touched by the untimely death of Sandra Schmirler. Most of us came to know her through her exploits as a champion curler and as an exemplary sports ambassador for Canada. But what really set her apart was her bright, engaging personality and her incredible zest for life, qualities that were <b>so</b> <b>clearly</b> in evidence as she fought so valiantly against her illness. She will be sorely missed. In honour of Schmirler, flags at provincial office buildings in Saskatchewan were lowered to half-staff.|$|E

5|$|In the South West Pacific, a {{conventional}} strategic bombing campaign {{was out of}} the question, as industrial targets in Japan were well beyond the range of even the largest strategic bombers operating from bases in Australia and New Guinea. Therefore, the primary mission of the Allied bomber force was interdiction of Japanese supply lines, especially the sea lanes. The results of the effort against the Japanese convoy in January were very disappointing; some 416 sorties had been flown with only two ships sunk and three damaged, <b>so</b> <b>clearly,</b> a change of tactics was in order. Group Captain Bill Garing, an RAAF officer on Kenney’s staff with considerable experience in air-sea operations, including a tour of duty in Europe, recommended that Japanese convoys be subjected to simultaneous attack from different altitudes and directions.|$|E
5|$|Smith was a benefactor {{during the}} period of reconstruction. He became {{frustrated}} that, during a time when the Hospital was <b>so</b> <b>clearly</b> in need of financial assistance, the trustees of his Irish munificence were choosing to procrastinate in their remittances of the annual grant. By the mid-1670s he had determined to use the powers granted to him {{under the terms of the}} Royal Charter in order to divert surplus funds from the Trust to the Hospital, and by 1681 relations between Smith and the trustees were so strained that both the governments in London and in Dublin were involved in attempts to determine who had responsibility both for the administration and collection of income and for the distribution thereof. One such involved person was Sir John Temple, the Solicitor-General for Ireland, who asserted that anomalies between the stipulations of 1667 and the Charter of 1669 showed that the revenue should stay in Ireland, and also that there was in fact no surplus available in any event because the Trust had not at that time met with all of its responsibilities in Ireland under the terms of the Charter.|$|E
25|$|As {{for word}} {{comprehension}}, Fenson et al. (1994) tested 10-11-month-old children’s comprehension vocabulary size {{and found a}} range from 11 words to 154 words. At this age, children normally have not yet begun to speak and thus have no production vocabulary. <b>So</b> <b>clearly,</b> comprehension vocabulary develops before production vocabulary.|$|E

25|$|To some modern readers it {{can appear}} that some {{dynamical}} quantities recognised today {{were used in}} the Principia but not named. The mathematical aspects of the first two books were <b>so</b> <b>clearly</b> consistent that they were easily accepted; for example, Locke asked Huygens whether he could trust the mathematical proofs, and was assured about their correctness.|$|E

25|$|Together, {{the nine}} steel truss bridges stood {{out because of}} their {{proximity}} to each other within Fulton County. Indeed, they also held historical significance for their age and as examples of early steel truss bridge construction; but it is rare to find such a concentrated collection of <b>so</b> <b>clearly</b> related sites. When they were nominated for the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, before some were destroyed, they were the subject of local tours by canoe and road.|$|E
25|$|The Marvelous Land of Oz {{was also}} {{influenced}} by the story and vaudevillian tone of the stage play. The character of the Wizard was in the book a good man though a bad wizard but in the play, the villain of the piece; this is reflected by the evil part he is described as having played in the back story of this work. The two armies of women, both Jinjur's and Glinda's, were <b>so</b> <b>clearly</b> intended as future chorus girls that even reviews of the book noted the similarity.|$|E
25|$|Francis Petre's work {{cannot be}} judged against {{that of the}} great {{classical}} architects of the northern hemisphere, who <b>so</b> <b>clearly</b> influenced him. He did not create a style or have a revival period named after him. His achievement was adapting and developing so many established styles well; whether through the new techniques of steel or concrete, or through more traditional building methods. He was given amazing opportunities to prove himself worthy as an accomplished and inspired architect; the many monumental buildings with which he provided New Zealand are testimony to his talent.|$|E

25|$|Ovis ammon sheep are colored a dark brown, {{with white}} underparts; the two {{different}} sections are separated by a dark band of hair. There is a white patch on the rump as well, which is not <b>so</b> <b>clearly</b> defined on most subspecies except O. a. polii. As winter approaches, the white hair on males grows longer, until it becomes a prominent ruff, although on O. a. polii the ruff stands out less than other subspecies. Females' coats are lighter than the males', {{and do not have}} such a drastic seasonal change. The Marco Polo sheep's face is lighter colored than the body.|$|E
25|$|The above {{equations}} suggest {{there is}} a flow speed at which pressure is zero, and at even higher speeds the pressure is negative. Most often, gases and liquids are not capable of negative absolute pressure, or even zero pressure, <b>so</b> <b>clearly</b> Bernoulli's equation ceases to be valid before zero pressure is reached. In liquids – when the pressure becomes too low – cavitation occurs. The above equations use a linear relationship between flow speed squared and pressure. At higher flow speeds in gases, or for sound waves in liquid, the changes in mass density become significant so that the assumption of constant density is invalid.|$|E
25|$|Early, {{rather than}} late, {{differentiation}} of Mercury is attested {{to by the}} compressional scarps that are <b>so</b> <b>clearly</b> seen in the Discovery quadrangle. Segregation of the core must have released large amounts of heat, which {{would have resulted in}} significant expansion of the crust. However, unambiguous extensional features (very rare on the planet as a whole) are not seen in the Discovery quadrangle; only compressional scarps occur. Thus, core segregation occurred relatively early (before formation of a solid lithosphere) and was followed by cooling and contraction, the last phases of which probably contributed to the formation of arcuate scarps that predated the end of heavy bombardment.|$|E

25|$|The {{probability}} of a photoelectric absorption per unit mass is approximately proportional to Z3/E3, where Z is the atomic number and E is {{the energy of the}} incident photon. This rule is not valid close to inner shell electron binding energies where there are abrupt changes in interaction probability, so called absorption edges. However, the general trend of high absorption coefficients and thus short penetration depths for low photon energies and high atomic numbers is very strong. For soft tissue, photoabsorption dominates up to about 26 keV photon energy where Compton scattering takes over. For higher atomic number substances this limit is higher. The high amount of calcium (Z=20) in bones together with their high density is what makes them show up <b>so</b> <b>clearly</b> on medical radiographs.|$|E
