40|$|A cap on {{the price}} of interstate access service was {{implemented}} by the Federal Communications Commission in 1991 to provide local exchange carriers (LECs) with an incentive to improve their productive efficiency. A question has arisen as to whether a deterioration in service quality for interstate access service has been an unintended consequence of this {{cap on the}} price. The analysis in this article uses several different measures of service quality, including the average installation interval, the percentage of commitments met, total trouble reports, and the average repair interval for both <b>switched</b> <b>access</b> <b>service</b> and special access service, to investigate empirically whether there has been a decline in service quality between 1991 and 2000. The results are conclusive. Overall, service quality has fallen. To rectify the situation, a proposal is offered to adjust the price cap index to penalize LECs who fail to provide an acceptable level of aggregate service quality. ...|$|E

50|$|Another {{downfall}} is {{that because}} the application is MHEG generated, if the set-top box was <b>switched</b> off, <b>access</b> to these channels was lost. It is also stated on-screen before purchase that not all boxes are compatible. Another factor is that a few cheaper boxes do not have MHEG support at all, and therefore cannot <b>access</b> the <b>service.</b>|$|R

50|$|Considering {{multiple}} <b>switch</b> <b>access</b> {{is important}} for users accessing more advanced activities through <b>switch</b> <b>access</b> scanning. This is usually determined by their physical capabilities. A single switch requires less physical control and is usually less tiring to access but it reduces scanning options and usually leads to a slower rate of input. Single-switch scanning also requires much greater concentration. Two-switch scanning enables a range of scanning options, including row-and-column and overscan. These can greatly increase input rates and can make using a computer or electronic assistive device far more comfortable and efficient.|$|R

40|$|WHAT IS DTV 4 All? DTV 4 All is {{a project}} funded by the European Commission, under the CIP ICT Policy Support Programme, to {{facilitate}} the provision of <b>access</b> <b>services</b> on digital television across the European Union. WHAT ARE ACCESS SERVICES? People who are hard of hearing or deaf need subtitles or deaf signing to be provided with television programmes {{if they are to}} fully appreciate its dialogue. People who are partially sighted or blind need audio description provided with a television programme if they are to fully appreciate the context of what they hear. Such services enable their users to access the storyline of a television programme so are known as <b>access</b> <b>services.</b> THE ETHOS OF DTV 4 All There are two basic scenarios for the provision of <b>access</b> <b>services.</b> In the first, those with impairments are expected to buy a suitable integrated digital television or a specialised digital television set-top box that can support the <b>access</b> <b>services</b> they want or have it provided by the public health system. In the second, society takes collective responsibility for inclusivity and ensures that set-top-boxes targeted at the general user can support core <b>access</b> <b>services,</b> especially given that certain improvements made for vulnerable groups can be beneficial to all users. DTV 4 All promotes inclusivity. OBJECTIVES OF DTV 4 ALL Offer and evaluate mature subtitling, audio description, audio subtitling and signing services in a minimum of four territories within the European Union for at least 12 months. Identify improvements to existing <b>access</b> <b>services</b> and ways of addressing the key technical, organisational and legal obstacles to the sustainable take-up of these services in the timeframe 2008 - 2010 throughout Europe. Identify and prioritise key emerging <b>access</b> <b>services,</b> and the devices and platforms needed to support them for the period 2010 - 2012 in terms of technological feasibility, perceived value to their intended users and business model viability. Make recommendations regarding mature and emerging <b>access</b> <b>services</b> to bodies representing stakeholders in the <b>access</b> <b>service</b> value chain on the basis of which these bodies can take appropriate action in relevant standardisation bodies...|$|R
