40|$|Loosening and {{migration}} of tibial prostheses {{have been identified}} as causes of early total knee replacement (TKR) failure. The problem is made more complex when defects occur in the proximal tibia compromising fixation and alignment. Clinical studies using metal augments have shown these to be an alternative to other means of defect treatment. Finite element (FE) analysis can be used to identify regions that may be prone to loosening {{and migration}}. In the current work, 3 D FE models of TKR uncontained type- 2 defects treated with block augments have been constructed and analysed. It has been shown that a metal augment is the most suitable. The use of bone cement (PMMA) to fill proximal defects is not considered suitable as stresses carried by the cement block exceed those of the fatigue limit of bone cement. It has been shown that the stresses in the proximal cancellous bone of block-augmented models are significantly below levels likely to cause damage due to overloading. Furthermore, the use of <b>stem</b> <b>extensions</b> has been shown to reduce the cancellous bone stresses in the proximal region thus increasing the likelihood of bone resorption.

Since the relations of G specify elements of K when considered as part of C, one must have S ≤ F,R.|$|R

Such C are often called universal perfect central extensions of G, or covering group (as it is a discrete analog of the universal covering space in topology). If the finite group G is not perfect, then its Schur covering groups (all such C of maximal order) are only isoclinic.|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} RNAs that infect plants self-cleave using a domain called the hammerhead. The {{consensus}} plant hammerhead has three base paired stem structures. Stems I and III flank the cleaved phosphodiester and {{are connected to}} stem II by two unpaired and highly conserved sequences. We demonstrated previously that satellite 2 transcripts from the newt, Notophthalmus viridescens, use a modified hammerhead structure for self-cleavage. Here we show that hammerheads with similar modifications occur in satellite 2 from species representing two additional families of salamanders (Ambystoma talpoideum and Amphiuma tridactylum). The distinctive features of the modified satellite 2 hammerheads include unusually short stem III regions and internally looped <b>extensions</b> to <b>stem</b> I that are required for cleavage. However, despite the strict nucleotide requirement in the internal stem I loop of the newt hammerhead, {{the details of the}} <b>stem</b> I <b>extensions</b> differ in the three salamanders. An analysis of chimeric transcripts indicated that, in order for a specific <b>stem</b> I <b>extension</b> to be functional, it must be compatible with other regions of the modified satellite 2 hammerhead. One such region is stem II, and a mutational analysis has confirmed that there are specific sequence and/or structural requirements in stem II...|$|R
