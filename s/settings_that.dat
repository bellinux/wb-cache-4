5|$|In {{addition}} to drawbars, many Hammond tonewheel organ models also include presets, which make predefined drawbar combinations {{available at the}} press of a button. Console organs have one octave of reverse colored keys (naturals are black, sharps and flats are white) {{to the left of}} each manual, with each key activating a preset; the far left key (C), also known as the cancel key, de-activates all presets, and results in no sound coming from that manual. The two right-most preset keys (B and B) activate the corresponding set of drawbars for that manual, while the other preset keys produce preselected drawbar <b>settings</b> <b>that</b> are internally wired into the preset panel.|$|E
5|$|Personnel {{experienced}} in direct laryngoscopy {{are not always}} immediately available in certain <b>settings</b> <b>that</b> require emergency tracheal intubation. For this reason, specialized devices {{have been designed to}} act as bridges to a definitive airway. Such devices include the laryngeal mask airway, cuffed oropharyngeal airway and the esophageal-tracheal combitube (Combitube). Other devices such as rigid stylets, the lightwand (a blind technique) and indirect fiberoptic rigid stylets, such as the Bullard scope, Upsher scope and the WuScope can also be used as alternatives to direct laryngoscopy. Each of these devices have its own unique set of benefits and drawbacks, and none of them is effective under all circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Production on The Orphanage {{began on}} May 15, 2006 in Llanes, Asturias. This {{location}} was chosen {{due to the}} area's diverse natural <b>settings</b> <b>that</b> include beaches, caves, cliffs, forests, a small village, and the Partarríu Manor where the orphanage scenes take place. The orphanage was an old colonial house {{from the end of}} the nineteenth century. Bayona wanted to use certain cinematographic techniques that were impossible to achieve in the house, so several parts of the house were reconstructed in sound stages. After four weeks in Llanes, the team moved to Barcelona to finish up the last ten weeks of filming in sound stages, making over 80% of the film there. Bayona showed the films La residencia and The Innocents to his director of photography on the film, to make special notice of the Scope lensing used in both films.|$|E

5|$|The game {{is divided}} into six environments, each {{representing}} a different setting from the film. To accomplish {{the objective of the}} game, the player must guide E.T. into the wells. Once all items found in a well are collected, the player must levitate E.T. out of them. An icon at the top of each screen represents the current area, each area enabling the player to perform different actions. Antagonists include a scientist who takes E.T. for observation and an FBI agent who chases the alien to confiscate one of the collected telephone pieces, or candy. The game offers diverse difficulty <b>settings</b> <b>that</b> affect the number and speed of humans present, and the conditions needed to accomplish the objective.|$|E
5|$|The {{new design}} reduced the bomb aimer's setup {{workload}} to dialling in four settings. Two of {{these could be}} set before the mission; the altitude of the target above sea level and the terminal velocity of the bomb, {{a function of the}} particular bomb being used on that mission. The only <b>settings</b> <b>that</b> had to be adjusted in flight were the measured wind direction and speed. The altitude, airspeed and course were all measured by the internal instruments and presented to the user in windows {{on the side of the}} computor case. Once set, the computor would automatically update the calculations and display the resulting bombing angle in another window. The computor could even account for steady changes in altitude, allowing the bomb run to take place in a shallow climb of up to 5 degrees or dive of up to 20 degrees.|$|E
5|$|To {{achieve a}} {{harmonious}} visual look, producer designer Hans Bacher and art director Ric Sluiter, along with Robert Walker and Head of Backgrounds Robert Stanton collaborated {{to establish a}} proper chronological location for the film in Chinese history. Since there was no general consensus {{on the time of}} Mulan's existence, they based on the visual design on the Ming and Qing dynasties. An important element of Bacher's design was to turn the art style closer to Chinese painting, with watercolor and simpler design, as opposed to the details of The Lion King and The Hunchback of Notre Dame. Bacher further studied more than thirty-five film directors ranging from the silent era German Expressionism, British and American epics of the 1950s and 60s, and the spaghetti westerns for inspiration for composition, lighting, and staging that would establish <b>settings</b> <b>that</b> enhanced the characters, and additional inspiration was found in the earlier Disney animated films such as Bambi, Pinocchio, and Dumbo to establish a sense of staging.|$|E

25|$|A {{significant}} change from previous versions of IIS {{is that all}} web server configuration information is stored solely in XML configuration files, instead of in the metabase. The server has a global configuration file that provides defaults, and each virtual web's document root (and any subdirectory thereof) may contain a web.config containing <b>settings</b> <b>that</b> augment or override the defaults. Changes to these files take effect immediately.

25|$|A {{central bank}} {{can also use}} a mixture of policy <b>settings</b> <b>that</b> change {{depending}} on circumstances. A central bank may peg its exchange rate (like a currency board) with different levels or forms of commitment. The looser the exchange rate peg, the more latitude the central bank has to target other variables (such as interest rates). It may instead target a basket of foreign currencies rather than a single currency. In some instances it is empowered to use additional means other than open market operations, such as changes in reserve requirements or capital controls, to achieve monetary outcomes.|$|E
25|$|Windows Vista {{contains}} a new networking stack, which brings large improvements {{in all areas}} of network-related functionality. It includes a native implementation of IPv6, as well as complete overhaul of IPv4. IPv6 is now supported by all networking components, services, and the user interface. In IPv6 mode, Windows Vista can use the Link Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) protocol to resolve names of local hosts on a network which does not have a DNS server running. The new TCP/IP stack uses a new method to store configuration <b>settings</b> <b>that</b> enables more dynamic control and does not require a computer restart after settings are changed. The new stack is also based on a strong host model and features an infrastructure to enable more modular components that can be dynamically inserted and removed.|$|E

25|$|Furthermore, {{women as}} a whole {{tend to be less}} {{assertive}} and confrontational. One of the factors contributing to the higher proportion of raises going to men is the simple fact that men tend to ask for raises more often than women, and are more aggressive when doing so. Women, and men, are socialized at young ages into these roles. School-age boys and girls have been noted as enacting the same aggressive and passive characteristics, respectively, in educational <b>settings</b> <b>that</b> we see in adults in the workplace. Boys {{are more likely to be}} pushed competitively in school, and sports, to be dominant. The idea that “winning is everything” is not emphasized to the same extent for girls and therefore they are less likely to seek recognition for their work.|$|E
25|$|The rotors and the {{positioning}} of the ring containing the notch were changed daily. The settings were defined in a codebook that was common to all operators on that network. At {{the start of each}} day, before any messages were sent or received, Enigma operators implemented the day's rotor selection and ring settings. Having selected the three rotors, they adjusted the ring <b>settings.</b> <b>That</b> could be done before the rotors were mounted on their axle or after they had been inserted into the machine. It was possible to adjust the ring settings of the loaded rotors by moving the spring-loaded retaining pin to the right and turning the rotor to display the specified letter. Herivel thought it likely {{that at least some of}} the operators would adjust the rings after they had mounted the rotors in the machine. Having set the alphabet rings and closed the lid, the operator should then have moved the rotors well away from the positions that displayed the three letters of the ring setting in the windows, but some operators did not.|$|E
25|$|Pooled {{whole-blood}} platelets, {{sometimes called}} “random” platelets, {{are separated by}} one of two methods. In the US, a unit of whole blood is placed into a large centrifuge in what {{is referred to as}} a “soft spin.” At these settings, the platelets remain suspended in the plasma. The platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is removed from the red cells, then centrifuged at a faster setting to harvest the platelets from the plasma. In other regions of the world, the unit of whole blood is centrifuged using <b>settings</b> <b>that</b> cause the platelets to become suspended in the “buffy coat” layer, which includes the platelets and the white blood cells. The “buffy coat” is isolated in a sterile bag, suspended in a small amount of red blood cells and plasma, then centrifuged again to separate the platelets and plasma from the red and white blood cells. Regardless of the initial method of preparation, multiple donations may be combined into one container using a sterile connection device to manufacture a single product with the desired therapeutic dose.|$|E
