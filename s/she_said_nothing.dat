500|$|Solanas {{may have}} {{intended}} {{to write an}} eponymous autobiography. In a 1977 Village Voice interview, she announced a book with her name as the title. The book, possibly intended as a parody, was supposed {{to deal with the}} [...] "conspiracy" [...] which led to her imprisonment. In a corrective 1977 Village Voice interview, Solanas said the book would not be autobiographical other than a small portion {{and that it would be}} about many things, include proof of statements in the manifesto, and would [...] "deal very intensively with the subject of bullshit", but <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>nothing</b> about parody.|$|E
2500|$|Beatrice's ladies gather {{outside the}} cell while Beatrice prays. In her cell, she affirms that <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>nothing</b> under torture: (Aria: Nulla diss'io...Di sovrumana forza / Mi armava il cielo... Io nulla dissi, oh, gioja / [...] "I said nothing! Heaven gave me superhuman strength. [...] I said nothing..."). Agnese enters and confesses {{that it was}} she who instigated, through jealousy, the plot to accuse the couple. She {{explains}} that {{she was in love with}} Orombello and that she believed Beatrice to be her rival. From his cell, Orombello's voice is heard. [...] Along with the two women, he forgives Agnese as does Beatrice. Agnese leaves and Beatrice declares herself to be ready for death. (Aria finale: Deh! se un'urna Ä— a me concessa / Senza un fior non la lasciate / [...] "Oh, if I'm vouchsafed a tomb, Leave it not bare of flowers".) ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{the people}} had all emerged into the Fourth, or White World, they saw the water {{continuing}} to rise in the Third World beneath them. Big Water Creature pushed her head through the opening in the reed. Her curly hair floated on the water, and lightning flashed from her black horn and her yellow horn. First Man asked Big Water Creature why she had come. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>nothing.</b> But the Coyote named First Angry came forward wearing his skin coat. He said [...] "Perhaps {{it is because of}} this," [...] and drew the two babies from under his coat. Turquoise Boy took a basket and filled it with turquoise. On top of the turquoise he placed the blue pollen from blue flowers and yellow pollen from the corn, and pollen from water flags, and on top of these he placed the crystal, which is river pollen. [...] This basket he gave to Coyote, who put it between the horns of the Big Water Creature, and on the basket he placed the two children. The Big Water Creature disappeared down into the reed, and the water with her.|$|E
6000|$|A little sigh rewarded him. Since <b>SHE</b> had <b>said</b> <b>nothing,</b> He <b>said</b> <b>nothing,</b> and Clara's {{words in}} the hall seemed to him {{singularly}} tactless: ...|$|R
6000|$|For a {{time the}} {{character}} of his fascinated gaze did not change. It was as if <b>she</b> had <b>said</b> <b>nothing.</b> Then he whispered, admiringly, [...] "You understand everything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Cecil {{wishes to}} part then? <b>She</b> has <b>said</b> <b>nothing</b> to me, but I see {{she has to}} you. Don't be annoyed, Raymond; {{it is in the}} nature of things." ...|$|R
60|$|June laughed; and {{she looked}} knowing, though <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>nothing.</b>|$|E
60|$|Alice didn't want {{to begin}} another argument, so <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>nothing.</b>|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>nothing,</b> so he {{continued}} without waiting further for a reply.|$|E
6000|$|She {{paused and}} Mrs. Winter remembered {{that when she}} had shown the girl the old {{newspaper}} Carrie had {{hesitated for a moment}} or two. <b>She,</b> however, <b>said</b> <b>nothing</b> and Carrie resumed: ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> still <b>said</b> <b>nothing,</b> {{but at the}} end of {{a minute}} she spoke without {{answering}} him. [...] "I shall expect you on Tuesday, and I hope you'll come by a decent train." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} had better go to bed, Gerald," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> steadily. <b>Nothing</b> about him seemed to touch her now, neither {{the sight of him}} nor his shameless misery.|$|R
60|$|There was a rosy, bright {{look about}} her, though <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>nothing.</b>|$|E
60|$|She {{must have}} known that he had heard, and yet <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>nothing.</b>|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>nothing,</b> however, and the Abbe {{continued}} {{after a few}} seconds' silence.|$|E
6000|$|... "Take care, Romola," [...] said Tito, playfully, feeling {{relieved}} that <b>she</b> had <b>said</b> <b>nothing</b> about Baldassarre; [...] "you have {{a touch of}} fanaticism in you. I shall have you seeing visions, like your brother." ...|$|R
60|$|The cab rumbled off. Anna leaned forward, {{watching}} {{the people in}} the streets. It was then {{for the first time she}} remembered that <b>she</b> had <b>said</b> <b>nothing</b> to her sister of the man in the hospital.|$|R
60|$|Irene {{looked at}} him, without reply, put the {{finishing}} touch to {{her dress and}} went downstairs. He could not make her out about this house. <b>She</b> had <b>said</b> <b>nothing</b> against it, and, as far as Bosinney was concerned, seemed friendly enough.|$|R
60|$|Her lips parted, as if {{she were}} about to speak, but <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>nothing.</b>|$|E
60|$|Tears of {{disappointment}} and reproach glistened in her blue eyes, but <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>nothing.</b>|$|E
60|$|Anne's tender bosom heaved, but <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>nothing,</b> {{and again}} became absorbed in contemplation.|$|E
6000|$|... "I see," [...] <b>said</b> <b>she,</b> [...] "that {{you think}} it only in the common course of things that Mr. Slope should have treated me in this way." [...] <b>She</b> had <b>said</b> <b>nothing</b> {{to him about the}} embrace, nor yet {{of the way in which}} it had been met.|$|R
60|$|Mrs Brown knew that, <b>she</b> <b>said.</b> Rob, having <b>nothing</b> more to say, {{began to}} chalk, slowly and laboriously, on the table.|$|R
6000|$|Gaston {{looked at}} her with deep eyes, then walked {{straight}} away to the window and remained there in silence. <b>She</b> herself <b>said</b> <b>nothing</b> more. At last the young man went on: [...] "And I who insisted to them that there was no natural delicacy like yours!" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>nothing</b> for a moment, then, suddenly, {{she stopped}} again, {{dropping}} her eyes.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>nothing</b> more {{until they}} were seated afresh, and had got into motion.|$|E
60|$|In {{spite of}} herself, {{she could not}} help half a smile, but <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>nothing.</b>|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> whitened and <b>said</b> <b>nothing.</b> I {{suddenly}} felt I must plead with her. [...] "Damn these bandages!" [...] I said, breaking into ineffectual febrile rage.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Yorke {{being told}} that a {{physician}} had been summoned, sneered at the hypochondriac fancies {{of the rich and}} idle, who, <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> having <b>nothing</b> but themselves to think about, must needs send for a doctor if only so much as their little finger ached.|$|R
6000|$|She {{answered}} [...] "Not long" [...] {{that being}} the only answer she dared to make. Everything was so different from what she imagined it would be. He {{wanted to know why}} <b>she</b> had <b>said</b> <b>nothing</b> of it in any of her letters; in her last letter. She said: ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>nothing,</b> but {{her hand}} which rested upon the rug was {{trembling}} a little.|$|E
60|$|He {{wondered}} why <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>nothing.</b> Did she understand? He {{put his hand}} on her arm.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>nothing,</b> but {{walked by}} his side with her eyes averted and her face aslant.|$|E
60|$|And then Bertram skulked off--or endeavoured {{rather to}} do so; for Mrs. Wilkinson {{detected}} {{him in the}} act, and stopped him. <b>She</b> had <b>said</b> <b>nothing</b> hitherto about his matrimonial or non-matrimonial affairs. She had abstained with wonderful discretion; and she now intended that her discretion should be rewarded.|$|R
50|$|Alla <b>said</b> <b>she</b> {{preferred}} Randal {{and accused}} Rebecca {{of being the}} weakest link. Alla <b>said</b> <b>she</b> saw <b>nothing</b> in Rebecca.|$|R
60|$|Then for {{the first}} time Carrie Denham flushed crimson as she heard the thought she had not {{permitted}} herself to put into words. The impression sank in, and she afterwards recalled it. <b>She,</b> however, <b>said</b> <b>nothing</b> in comment, and the two went back silently through the archway to the lawn.|$|R
