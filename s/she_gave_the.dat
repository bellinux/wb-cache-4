5|$|Gaga grounds {{this sort}} of {{spectacle}} with her voice. She is still a fearsome singer when she chooses to be, {{which is to say}} rarely on records but often in concert... What <b>she</b> <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> faithful was easy to digest: largely bulletproof pop, swinging back and forth between brooding, panting torch songs delivered at top volume and grand-scale 1980s-style digital rock with a nightclub twist.|$|E
5|$|Singh {{eventually}} {{received a}} place of honour in the suffragette movement alongside Emmeline Pankhurst. Her sole aim in life, which she attained, was the advancement of women. Queen Victoria had given Singh an elaborately-dressed doll named Little Sophie, which became her proud possession. Near {{the end of her}} life <b>she</b> <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> doll to Drovna, her housekeeper's daughter.|$|E

5|$|After several {{diplomatic}} {{failures and}} military defeats in the 1730s, Austria {{seemed to be}} declining, or even {{on the verge of}} collapse. After her forty years reign, Maria Theresa left a revitalised empire that influenced the rest of Europe throughout the 19thcentury. <b>She</b> <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> Habsburg dominions an efficient administrative system that allowed it to remain a great power in its own right, without the support of the Holy Roman Empire. Her descendants followed her example and continued reforming the empire. The acquisition of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria gave the empire an even more multinational character that would ultimately lead to its destruction. Her introduction of compulsory schooling, as a means of Germanisation, eventually triggered the revival of Czech culture.|$|E
5|$|In 1993 Christensen was arrested, tried, {{and sentenced}} to five years, four months {{imprisonment}} for trafficking marijuana and heroin. She claimed {{that she had been}} driving a car from Texas to Florida as a favor to friends, and had no knowledge that she was being used as a drug mule by them. Many Odinists and Asastruer decried the sentence, and claimed that it was a political frame-up; Murray established a Free Else Christensen Committee and with Stephen McNallen created a defense fund to aid her. Christensen herself did not endorse the claim that the charges were politically motivated, instead blaming her own naivete at being exploited by drug dealers. Before being imprisoned <b>she</b> <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> Odinist Fellowship's membership list to McNallen for the use of his own Heathen organisation, the Asatru Folk Assembly.|$|E
5|$|The {{account of}} Southchurch's {{provisioning}} was first {{made available to}} a wider audience through {{the writings of the}} English historian Helen Cam. Cam was responsible for groundbreaking work on the Hundred Rolls, and their relevance to English local government, through her Studies in the Hundred Rolls (1921) and The Hundred and the Hundred Rolls (1930). In both of these she made mention of what she calls '...the most picturesque series of extortions recorded in the Essex returns.' It was, however, in a paper published in the English Historical Review as early as 1916 that <b>she</b> <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> most detailed account of Southchurch's plot. Here she traced the dissemination of the Viking legend through Geoffrey of Monmouth, and speculated that Southchurch could have been acquainted with a later version by Gaimar, Wace or Layamon, or through a local, popular legend.|$|E

25|$|Alone in the flat, Nicola burns, one by one, {{letters that}} Dan {{used to write}} her – letters that Imogen {{mentions}} elsewhere were beautiful letters from a much younger and inexperienced Dan she once knew.

The rebuild created accommodation for 100 passengers, while retaining the original royal quarters on the ship unaltered. Prins Olav served as an effective public relations tool for Nordenfjeldske.
