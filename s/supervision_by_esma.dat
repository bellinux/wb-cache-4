It argues against {{the contention that}} the two films express optimism about one’s ability to resolve spiritual-existential angst {{and the possibility of}} ultimately reaffirming one’s faith. Through close analysis of pivotal scenes, including that of Death in the Castle in The Seventh Seal and the Frostnäs church service in Winter Light, the article exposes the unremitting pessimism that pervades the films’ atmospheres. In essence, the article asserts that the two films, Winter Light in particular, are among the most pessimistic in Bergman’s cinema. </p...|$|R

50|$|On {{stage and}} in her music videos, Esma Redžepova plays with {{stereotypes}} linked to Gypsy women and uses traditional attires and dancers. The Middle-Eastern character of her performances was often enhanced to please non-Romani audiences. In the same way, costumes worn <b>by</b> <b>Esma</b> or her dancers can be inaccurate to Macedonian Roma culture. For instance, some videos show Hungarian or Russian costumes, in order to match the expectations of a non-Romani on Romani culture and traditional dresses. Although Esma used sensuality and seduction in many of her early songs, such as her numerous čoček, she put a limit by not wearing immodest belly dance outfits. Instead, she usually wore the Roma dimije, which she personalized by using modern fabrics.|$|R
