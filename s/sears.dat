She arranged a meeting among feuding campaign managers John <b>Sears</b> and Michael Deaver, and her husband, which resulted in Deaver leaving the campaign and <b>Sears</b> being given full control.

2500|$|On {{pulling the}} trigger of a wheellock firearm, the <b>sear</b> effects a slight {{rotation}} as described above. The end of the <b>sear</b> arm (that has hitherto locked the wheel and prevented it from turning) is disengaged, leaving the wheel free to turn under the tension of the mainspring. There is a subtlety here that is of vital importance: the [...] "hole" [...] {{in the side of}} the wheel into which the <b>sear</b> engages, is not a parallel-sided shaft. If it were, then under the tremendous tension of the mainspring, it would require a huge force on the trigger to disengage the <b>sear.</b> Nor is the tip of the <b>sear</b> arm cylindrical, which would have a similar effect. Rather, the [...] "hole" [...] is a depression in the wheel (like a small crater), and the <b>sear</b> has a rounded end: the wheel is locked by reason of lateral force on the shaft of the wheel rather than vertical force on the <b>sear.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Laura Catherine Redden {{graduated}} from the Missouri School for the Deaf, a secondary school, in 1858. She did not enroll in college. [...] Her literary skills and unmarried status made it acceptable at the {{time for her to}} enroll at certain colleges. However, there were no colleges that accepted deaf women. The National Deaf-Mute College (now Gallaudet University) was established in 1864 and did not admit female students until 1881. To supplement her education, she toured Europe from 1865-69. While there, she studied German, French, Spanish, and Italian. She became engaged to Michael George Brennan in 1867, but the engagement ended shortly after. Laura Catherine Redden married Edward Whelan <b>Searing,</b> a lawyer, in 1876, to become Laura Catherine Redden <b>Searing.</b> They had one child, Elsa Waller <b>Searing,</b> on May 4, 1880.

50|$|<b>Searing</b> (or pan <b>searing)</b> is a {{technique}} used in grilling, baking, braising, roasting, sautéing, etc., in which {{the surface of the}} food (usually meat, poultry or fish) is cooked at high temperature until a caramelized crust forms. Similar techniques, browning and blackening, are typically used to <b>sear</b> all sides of a particular piece of meat, fish, poultry, etc. before finishing it in the oven. To obtain the desired brown or black crust, the meat surface must exceed 150 °C (300 °F), so <b>searing</b> requires the meat surface be free of water, which boils at around 100 °C (212 °F).|$|R
5000|$|The {{key element}} {{apparently}} added by Marin le Bourgeoys was the vertically acting <b>sear.</b> The <b>sear</b> is a [...] "catch" [...] or [...] "latch" [...] which holds the mechanism {{in a position}} ready to fire; the trigger acts upon, or is part of, the <b>sear,</b> releasing it and allowing a strong spring {{to act on the}} mechanism to fire the gun. Previously the <b>sear,</b> located within the lock, had acted {{through a hole in the}} lockplate to engage the cock on the outside of the plate. The vertically acting <b>sear</b> acted on a piece called the tumbler, on the inside of the lock which was mounted on the same rotating shaft as the cock. This design proved to be the most efficient in terms of cost and reliability.|$|R

5|$|Starting in 2000, {{the first}} of several {{renovation}} plans was announced for the mall. The initial plan called for the addition of a new, three-story wing with an eighteen-screen movie theater complex, as well as several upscale tenants. Under this proposal, the existing <b>Sears</b> store would have been converted to mall space, and a new <b>Sears</b> store built immediately behind it. These expansion plans never came to fruition. By 2002, General Cinemas had sold the mall's theater complex to AMC Theatres. One year later, Pyramid made a failed attempt to evict the theaters for a Best Buy store, although Best Buy opened a store at the mall next to <b>Sears</b> in 2006. AMC closed the mall's theaters in 2004 and only four days after closing, the theater complex was acquired and reopened by Regal Entertainment Group. The JCPenney Home Store closed in 2002. Kaufmann's was one of several former May Co. brands to be acquired and renamed by Macy's in 2005, and while the main Kaufmann's store was converted to Macy's, the Home Store was shuttered.

40|$|We {{show that}} sodium 9, 10 -epoxy- 12 -hydroxytetradecanoate (<b>SEAR),</b> an {{epoxidized}} derivative of ricinoleic acid, simultaneously functioned as reducing and stabilizing {{agents in the}} synthesis of silver nanoparticles in alkaline aqueous medium. The advantage of using <b>SEAR</b> is its biodegradability and nontoxicity, which are important characteristics for mitigation of environmental impact upon discharge of nanoparticles into terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. The <b>SEAR</b> concentration was found to impact considerably the size distribution of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). A concentration below the <b>SEAR</b> critical micelle concentration (CMC) generated 23 [*]nm sized AgNPs with 10 [*]nm standard deviation, while 50 [*]nm sized AgNPs (σ= 21 [*]nm) were obtained at a concentration above the <b>SEAR</b> CMC. FTIR analysis revealed that the carboxylate that constitutes the <b>SEAR</b> hydrophilic head binds directly to the AgNPs surface promoting stabilization in solution. Finally, AgNPs turned into Ag 2 S upon contact with wastewater samples from Wastewater Treatment Plant at Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN), Brazil, which is an interesting result, since Ag 2 S is more environmentally friendly than pure AgNPs...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectivesResearch {{is lacking}} on the {{correlation}} between treatment satisfaction and confidence, self-esteem, and relationships for men receiving treatment for erectile dysfunction (ED). We sought to correlate scores between the validated Erectile Dysfunction Inventory of Treatment Satisfaction (EDITS) index and the validated Self-Esteem And Relationship (<b>SEAR)</b> questionnaire following treatment with sildenafil citrate (VIAGRA). MethodsThis study {{was based on an}} open-label, flexible-dose trial of 93 sildenafil-naive patients with ED. Pearson correlation coefficients between EDITS index and <b>SEAR</b> questionnaire scores, each of which can range from 0 to 100 (most favorable), were calculated at end of treatment (EOT). An analysis of covariance model was applied to associate changes from baseline to EOT in <b>SEAR</b> scores with EDITS score at EOT, controlling for baseline <b>SEAR</b> score. ResultsSignificant and sizable Pearson's correlations between <b>SEAR</b> and EDITS scores (P ≤ 0. 0001; range: 0. 49 – 0. 84) were observed. A 10 -point higher EDITS scores at EOT corresponded to a significant and tangible average improvement in <b>SEAR</b> scores from baseline to EOT (P ≤ 0. 0001; range: 6. 6 – 8. 7). Average <b>SEAR</b> scores at EOT were markedly different between patients with greater treatment satisfaction at EOT (EDITS score ≥ median EDITS score of 88. 6; n = 50) and those with lesser treatment satisfaction at EOT (EDITS score < 88. 6; n = 43). ConclusionsThe data add to the validity of the <b>SEAR</b> questionnaire, suggest a tangible relationship between treatment satisfaction and psychosocial benefit among men with ED treated with sildenafil, and highlight the importance of assessing the psychosocial impact of ED in men undergoing treatment...|$|R

5|$|Home Pong was {{an instant}} success {{following}} its limited 1975 release through Sears; around 150,000units were sold that holiday season. The game became Sears' most successful product at the time, which earned Atari a <b>Sears</b> Quality Excellence Award. Similar to the arcade version, several companies released clones {{to capitalize on the}} home console's success, many of which continued to produce new consoles and video games. Magnavox re-released their Odyssey system with simplified hardware and new features, and would later release updated versions. Coleco entered the video game market with their Telstar console; it features three Pong variants and was also succeeded by newer models. Nintendo released the Color TV Game 6 in 1977, which plays six variations of electronic tennis. The next year, it was followed by an updated version, the Color TV Game 15, which features fifteen variations. The systems were Nintendo's entry into the home video game market and the first to produce themselves—they had previously licensed the Magnavox Odyssey. The dedicated Pong consoles and the numerous clones have since become varying levels of rare; Atari's Pong consoles are common, while APF Electronics' TV Fun consoles are moderately rare. Prices among collectors, however, vary with rarity; the <b>Sears</b> Tele-Games versions are often cheaper than those with the Atari brand.|$|E
