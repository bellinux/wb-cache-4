30|$|Another clear {{problem in}} the care process {{was the lack of}} {{emotional}} support. Some of the interviewees had had depression after their surgery, one described his feelings as if he had fallen into a void after discharge. As the treatment periods in the hospital are very short the patient may <b>still</b> be <b>in</b> <b>shock</b> at discharge when he is expected to take charge of his own treatment and make the contact with the local health center for checkups. Although more emotional support was required only in 6 open answers, in a closed question 37 of the interviewees considered that their treatment did not include enough emotional support.|$|R

50|$|The high shock {{resistance}} and good hardenability {{are provided by}} chromium-tungsten, silicon-molybdenum, silicon-manganese alloying. Shock-resisting group tool steels (S) are designed to resist shock at both low and high temperatures. A low carbon content {{is required for the}} necessary toughness (approximately 0.5% carbon). Carbide-forming alloys provide the necessary abrasion resistance, hardenability, and hot-work characteristics. This family of steels displays very high impact toughness and relatively low abrasion resistance and can attain relatively high hardness (HRC 58/60). In the US, toughness usually derives from 1 to 2% silicon and 0.5-1% molybdenum content. <b>In</b> Europe, <b>shock</b> steels often contain 0.5-0.6 % carbon and around 3% nickel. 1.75% to 2.75% nickel is <b>still</b> used <b>in</b> some <b>shock</b> resisting and high strength low alloy steels (HSLA), such as L6, 4340, and Swedish saw steel, but it is relatively expensive.
