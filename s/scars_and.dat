5|$|A. piscivorus venom is more toxic {{than that}} of A. contortrix, and is rich with {{powerful}} cytotoxic venom that destroys tissue. Although deaths are rare, the bite can leave <b>scars,</b> <b>and</b> on occasion, require amputation. Absent an anaphylactic reaction in a bitten individual, however, the venom does not cause systemic reactions in victims and does not contain neurotoxic components present in numerous rattlesnake species. Bites can be effectively treated with CroFab antivenom; this serum is derived using venom components from four species of American pit vipers (the eastern and western diamondback rattlesnakes, the Mojave rattlesnake, and the cottonmouth).|$|E
5|$|Atrophic acne scars {{have lost}} {{collagen}} from the healing response {{and are the}} most common type of acne scar (account for approximately 75% of all acne scars). They may be further classified as ice-pick scars, boxcar <b>scars,</b> <b>and</b> rolling scars. Ice-pick scars are narrow (less than 2mm across), deep scars that extend into the dermis. Boxcar scars are round or ovoid indented scars with sharp borders and vary in size from 1.5–4mm across. Rolling scars are wider than icepick and boxcar scars (4–5mm across) and have a wave-like pattern of depth in the skin.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} support the robust head, the neck of Hatzegopteryx was likely {{strongly}} muscled. On the occipital bones, the nuchal lines, which serve as muscular attachments, are very well-developed and bear prominent scars. These conceivably supported the transversospinalis muscles, which aid in extension and flexion {{of the head and}} neck. Likewise, the opisthotic process, neural spines, and zygapophyses all appeared to have been large and robust (with the latter bearing many pits and edges that likely represent muscle <b>scars),</b> <b>and</b> the basioccipital tuberosities were long; these all serve as points of attachment for various muscles of the head and neck. Although not entirely unmuscled, the neck of Arambourgiania probably would not have been as extensively muscled as that of Hatzegopteryx.|$|E
5|$|Serious {{damage is}} rare, as the fights are usually short in duration, with the loser {{running away with}} little more than a few {{scratches}} to the face and ears. However, fights for mating rights are typically more severe and injuries may include deep puncture wounds and lacerations. Normally, serious injuries from fighting are limited to infections of scratches and bites, though these can occasionally kill cats if untreated. In addition, bites are probably the main route of transmission of feline immunodeficiency virus. Sexually active males are usually involved in many fights during their lives, and often have decidedly battered faces with obvious <b>scars</b> <b>and</b> cuts to their ears and nose.|$|E
5|$|A common belief {{regarding}} self-harm {{is that it}} is an attention-seeking behaviour; however, in many cases, this is inaccurate. Many self-harmers {{are very}} self-conscious of their wounds and <b>scars</b> <b>and</b> feel guilty about their behaviour, leading them to {{go to great lengths to}} conceal their behaviour from others. They may offer alternative explanations for their injuries, or conceal their scars with clothing. Self-harm in such individuals may not be associated with suicidal or para-suicidal behaviour. People who self-harm are not usually seeking to end their own life; it has been suggested instead that they are using self-harm as a coping mechanism to relieve emotional pain or discomfort or as an attempt to communicate distress. Alternatively, interpretations based on the supposed lethality of a self-harm may not give clear indications as to its intent: life risking behaviour may have no suicidal intent, whilst seemingly superficial cuts may have been a suicide attempt.|$|E

5|$|Koalas are {{seasonal}} breeders, and births {{take place}} {{from the middle}} of spring through the summer to early autumn, from October to May. Females in oestrus tend to hold their heads further back than usual and commonly display tremors and spasms. However, males do not appear to recognise these signs, and have been observed to mount non-oestrous females. Because of his much larger size, a male can usually force himself on a female, mounting her from behind, and in extreme cases, the male may pull the female out of the tree. A female may scream and vigorously fight off her suitors, but will submit to one that is dominant or is more familiar. The bellows and screams that accompany matings can attract other males to the scene, obliging the incumbent to delay mating and fight off the intruders. These fights may allow the female to assess which is dominant. Older males usually have accumulated scratches, <b>scars,</b> <b>and</b> cuts on the exposed parts of their noses and on their eyelids.|$|E
5|$|Despite being mostly solitary, {{sirenians}} congregate {{in groups}} while females are in estrus. These groups usually include one female with multiple males. Sirenians are K-selectors, so, despite the longevity, females give birth {{only a few}} times during their life and invest considerable parental care in their young. Dugongs generally gather in groups of less than a dozen individuals for one to two days. Since they congregate in turbid waters, little is known about their reproductive behavior. The males are often seen with <b>scars,</b> <b>and</b> the tusks on dugongs grow in first for males, suggesting they are important in lekking. They have also been known to lunge at each other. The age when a female first gives birth is disputed, ranging anywhere from six to seventeen years. The time between births is unclear, with estimates ranging from 2 to 7 years. Manatees can reach sexual maturity as early as two to five years of age. Manatee gestation length is around one year, and then they lactate for one to two years. West Indian manatees and African manatees can breed year-round, and a female will mate with multiple male partners. Amazonian manatees have a breeding season, usually mating when the river levels begin to rise, which varies from place to place.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Eragon {{continues}} his training, but is discouraged when the {{scar on his}} back causes him to have agonizing seizures multiple times per day. He has been swooning over Arya {{for most of the}} book. Saphira also has a similar problem with Glaedr, as she believes him to be a good choice for a mate and tries to win his affections. Eragon tells her it would not be proper, and she in turn replies that Arya is not as important as his education. Both efforts fail miserably, but bring Eragon and Saphira closer together. Later, at the ancient elven ceremony, the Agaetí Blödhren (Blood-Oath Celebration), Eragon is altered by a spectral dragon. The changes alter his senses, and enhance his abilities, effectively turning him into an elf-human hybrid, as well as healing all of his wounds, <b>scars,</b> <b>and</b> back injury. Reinvigorated, Eragon continues training until he learns that the Empire will soon attack the Varden in Surda. Afterward he confesses his feelings for Arya who rejects him harshly. Dismayed, he leaves without completing his training, to aid the Varden in battle. Upon leaving he is given a bow with magical arrows, a belt with twelve priceless diamonds, an enchanted flask of elvish concoction, a copy of a poem he wrote and presented for the Agaetí Blödhren, and the blessing of Oromis and Glaedr.|$|E

5|$|On January 27, 1984, Michael {{and other}} members of the Jacksons filmed a Pepsi {{commercial}} overseen by executive Phil Dusenberry, a BBDO ad agency executive, and Alan Pottasch, Pepsi's Worldwide Creative Director, at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. During a simulated concert before a full house of fans, pyrotechnics accidentally set Jackson's hair on fire, causing second-degree burns to his scalp. Jackson underwent treatment to hide the <b>scars</b> <b>and</b> had his third rhinoplasty shortly thereafter. Pepsi settled out of court, and Jackson donated the $1.5 million settlement to the Brotman Medical Center in Culver City, California; its Michael Jackson Burn Center is named in his honor. Dusenberry recounted the episode in his memoir, Then We Set His Hair on Fire: Insights and Accidents from a Hall of Fame Career in Advertising. Jackson signed a second agreement with Pepsi in the late 1980s for a reported $10 million. The second campaign had a global reach of more than 20 countries and would provide financial support for Jackson's Bad album and 1987–88 world tour. Although Jackson had endorsements and advertising deals with other companies, such as LA Gear, Suzuki, and Sony, none were as significant as his deals with Pepsi, which later signed other music stars such as Britney Spears and Beyoncé to promote its products.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In theory, ionic solutes diffuse {{more slowly}} in {{cartilage}} than do nonionic solutes. We tested {{the hypothesis that}} the contrast ratio between <b>scar</b> <b>and</b> recurrent disk fragment on MR images is greater after IV administration of an ionic rather than a nonionic contrast medium when a clinical dose is used. METHODS: Twenty patients who had recurrent lumbar disk herniation were enrolled in this study. The enhancement of epidural <b>scar</b> <b>and</b> recurrent disk fragment was measured at 5, 25, 40, and 50 min after IV injection of ionic and nonionic contrast media (0. 1 mmol/kg) RESULTS: The enhancement was consistently and significantly higher for scar than for recurrent disk fragment, although the contrast ratio between <b>scar</b> <b>and</b> recurrent disk fragment decreased between 5 and 50 min after the administration of each contrast medium. No significant difference was shown between ionic and nonionic contrast media in the enhancement of recurrent disk fragment at 5, 25, 40, and 50 min after injection. The contrast ratio between <b>scar</b> <b>and</b> recurrent disk fragment was not a significant difference at 5, 25, and 40 min after administration of both contrast media. At 50 min, the contrast ratio between <b>scar</b> <b>and</b> recurrent disk fragment was 1. 32 0. 41 with ionic contrast medium and 1. 20 0. 56 with nonioni...|$|R
