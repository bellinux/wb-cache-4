25|$|Unlike the American {{pioneers of}} the Old West, Filipinos were not <b>so</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> occupy remote, {{unsettled}} and undeveloped areas. So when the American colonial government introduced homesteading, {{there were few}} takers among Filipinos. Essentially, homesteading happens when someone lays claim on, harnesses the resources and develops a parcel of land, even if it's still wilderness and far from population centers, for economic use. Homesteading could be done through a legal process of acquiring a land title, or even without a title at all. In the latter case however, {{the lack of a}} title makes the informal homesteader vulnerable to any legal action attempting to take the land away from him.|$|E

We didn't want to go there and just shoot Frenchy's Chicken and call it an [...] "authentic video." [...] There was tons of hanging out, getting the feel, all with cameras ready. We hooked up with our dude Scotty who was a great help, plus Bun B's brother Truck, and Paul Wall. The city was so receptive, <b>so</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> help, so open, and that leant a lot {{to the fact that we}} really got to glimpse of the real character of Houston.|$|E

2500|$|Besides {{the added}} {{incentive}} of no longer depleting the finances with expensive wars with Hatti {{and increasing the}} security of Egypt's claims in Syria, signing the treaty with Hatti also provided Ramesses the opportunity to brag about his [...] "defeat" [...] of the Hittites. Since Hattušiliš {{had been the one}} to approach Ramesses, the pharaoh in his depictions at the Ramesseum represents the settlement as one that the Hittite had asked for in a position of submission. Considering the official language of the treaties at the time was completely independent of one another, Ramesses was able to present the terms of the treaty from his perspective. This free control over the depictions of his role by the language of the treaty gave the pharaoh opportunity to present a greatly idealized point of view. His ability to assert a sense of supremacy as ruler of Egypt and his attempts to portray this strategic alliance as a victory over the Hittites demonstrate why Ramesses' would be <b>so</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> choose such a mutually beneficial peace. The conclusion of open hostilities between the two regional powers was a personal triumph for the aging pharaoh and as his monument at Abu Simbel shows the pharaoh made his subjects well {{aware of the fact that}} he, Ramesses, was the conqueror of the Hittites.|$|E
