40|$|The {{development}} of instruments for controlling reactor operation is reported. A shim-scram actuator was designed incorporating an electromagnetic dnlve for shim and scram, a shim <b>speed</b> <b>limiting</b> <b>device,</b> and a force feedback position indicator. A three-channel trip circuit and a two-out-of-three logic circuit using controlled switches {{in place of}} transistors was designed, built, and tested. A capacitance-type temperature sensor was operated in an inert atmosphere at temperatures up to 3782 deg F. Models of a gridded and a compensated a-c ionization chamber were tested in both thermal neutron and gamma environments. The compensated a-c ionization chamber demonstrated better than 98 % gamma compensation at a thermalneutron flux of 5 x 10 /sup - 11 / nv and 1 Mw reactor power. Unpowered charged-fragment neutron detectors using boron- 10 or uranium- 235 as the emitter coating were demonstrated to respond linearly to changes of thermalneutron flux. Potentials, developed within the detecting circuit, possibly due to contact potentials, are suspected to {{be the cause of}} detector output-current instability as a function of time. Fission counter operation at 816 deg C was demonstrated to be feasible, but operation was not entirely satisfactory. Adequate reactor power range neutron sensing to 535 deg C is feasible using uncompensated d-c ionization chambers. (N. W. R. ...|$|E

50|$|The SZD-24 Foka was {{designed}} for competition flying in the 'Standard' class as well as aerobatic flying. The design originated from a design competition within SZD which was won by the ”Delfin”, to become the SZD-24 Foka in production. The first flight, by SP-2069, took place in May 1960 at Bielsko but results were not good with poorly performing airbrakes which were unable to limit the airspeed below VNE (Velocity Never Exceed). This posed a problem as OSTIV (Organisation Scientifique et Technique Internationale du Vol à Voile - International Scientific and technical organisation for gliding) rules for the Standard class in gliding competitions stipulate that <b>speed</b> <b>limiting</b> <b>devices</b> must <b>limit</b> maximum <b>speed</b> to VNE or below. A second prototype was quickly built, fitted with much improved air-brakes as well as improved canopy locks and an additional access panel in the rear fuselage. Adam Zientek carried out the first flight of the second prototype on 24 May 1960 which went on to take third place in the 'Standard' class at the 1960 World Gliding Championships at Köln in Germany, piloted by Adam Witek. The SZD-24 Foka prototype was much admired for its performance, elegance, aerodynamically clean lines and comfortable semi reclined flying position. The pre-production variant, called SZD-24A, introduced more refinements and the line was steadily improved up to the SZD-32 Foka 5 final production variant.|$|R

50|$|Ohio has {{an urban}} <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> of 65 mph on Interstates by state law, yet many urban areas have lower <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> due to safety {{concerns}} found in speed studies.
