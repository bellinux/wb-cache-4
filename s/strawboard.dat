25|$|Polishing wheels {{come in a}} {{wide variety}} of types to fulfil a wide range of needs. The most common {{materials}} used for polishing wheels are wood, leather, canvas, cotton cloth, plastic, felt, paper, sheepskin, impregnated rubber, canvas composition, and wool; leather and canvas are the most common. Wooden wheels have emery or other abrasives glued onto them and are used to polish flat surfaces and maintained good edges. There are many types of cloth wheels. Cloth wheels that are cemented together are very hard and used for rough work, whereas other cloth wheels that are sewn and glued together are not as aggressive. There are cloth wheels that are not glued or cemented, instead these are sewed and have metal side plates for support. Solid felt wheels are popular for fine finishes. Hard roughing wheels can be made by cementing together <b>strawboard</b> paper disks. Softer paper wheels are made from felt paper. Most wheels are run at approximately 7500 surface feet per minute (SFM), however muslin, felt and leather wheels are usually run at 4000 SFM.|$|E

5000|$|F.M. Howell and Company is a {{late nineteenth}} century {{manufacturing}} complex located {{on the banks of}} the Chemung River in Elmira, New York. F.M. Howell & Company was founded in 1883 in Elmira, New York by Fred M. Howell and John Aldrich. In its early years the company started out by producing wood and <b>strawboard</b> cigar and shoe boxes for other manufacturing companies. As this continued, they also added rigid paperboard boxes, and printing of box wraps and labels. Subsequently, this all led into the carton manufacturing, and plastic thermoforming for packaging. Later, on Howell got help from his cousin to help expand the companies horizons. [...] Of the five contributing buildings, four are located on the east side of Pennsylvania Avenue (Buildings 1, 2, 3 & 5), while only the Brand Building is located on the west side of the street.

50|$|Inside, {{the house}} {{featured}} {{a number of}} small facilities and an extraordinarily garish palette. Tomato red, hortensia, white, black and yellow paint covered the <b>strawboard</b> panels that clad the house. An enormous amount of light filled the house, a result of the numerous skylights that punctuated the inclined roof. Internally, the steel framing {{of the house and the}} rafters and joists were all exposed. This was a trait of the Melbourne Regional Style of the 1940s and 1950s. A balcony was located at either end of the house, at the height of the canopy of trees that hugged their way around the house. In essence, the McIntyre River Residence is a combination of basic geometric shapes. Two Triangular prisms form the striking elevation of the design and the rectangular plan of the house. Access to the house is afforded by a cylindrical staircase that pushes up through the triangular prism that balances the extents of the house either side of it. Colour and carefully placed windows then afford the house a definitively organic quality.|$|E

50|$|The main {{or driving}} disk {{is faced with}} a disk of aluminum. The driven disk has a working rim of elastic fiber. Lambert says in the invention, In {{practice}} I have found that this combination of aluminum and fiber bearing surfaces gives the maximum degree of friction and durability, thereby especially adapting the gearing for use on motor vehicles of the heavier kind, where the friction surfaces are at times subjected to great strains, and must, therefore, have a frictional contact of {{a high degree of}} efficiency in order to avoid slipping. It will be observed that the aluminum is advantageous also, because it will not tarnish or rust appreciably, but will always present a smooth, clean surface to the fiber periphery, so that wear will be reduced to a minimum. The friction disk drive was one of the key features of the Union automobile and Lambert automobile. Lambert started making the friction disk and traversing pinion drive in 1900. The first attempt was with a leather faced disk and an iron friction wheel. It had an eighteen inch diameter with a one and a half inch face. With this first attempt the leather was charred within the first three miles (5 km) of running it. The disk was then made with a wood fiber about a half inch thick. The material had a glossy surface and worked fine for a while, however it broke up after only 200 to 300 mi run. Lambert then conducted various experiments on the friction disk to get better performance. In one experiment a cone of cast aluminum was used as one member of a level friction drive with excellent results. Lambert then realizing that the pull was due to the aluminum itself, a disk was faced with it and the traversing wheel with <b>strawboard.</b> This accidental discovery made Lambert automobiles more successful than other cars that attempted at friction driving.|$|E

40|$|Commercial ground {{wheat straw}} {{was used in}} a central {{composite}} response surface experimental design to examine four acetylating process variables: reaction temperature, reaction time, initial moisture content of straw, and the vapor flow rate of chemical reagent. The response variable was acetyl content determined {{as a function of}} straw weight gain. Diphenylmethyane diisocyante was used as a binder to prepare board samples with a hot press. Equilibrium moisture content (EMC) was determined at 65 and 90 % RH at 27 °C, and dimensional stability was determined using a humidity cycle of 30 – 90 % RH at 27 °C. ASTM D 1037 - 93 standard method for a 3 -point flex test was used to measure mechanical properties. The microstructures of both treated and untreated wheat straw and boards were observed with a scanning electron microscope. The vapor phase acetylation system used acetylated ground wheat straw to a 24 % weight gain (dry weight basis). A mathematical model (R 20. 97) was developed to predict the weight gain {{as a function of the}} four acetylation processing variables. The maximum reduction in all <b>strawboard</b> properties occurred at the highest weight gain (24 %). The <b>strawboard</b> EMC decreased (30 % maximum reduction) as weight gain increased at both 65 and 90 % RH. The <b>strawboard</b> dimensional stability increased as the weight gain increased (maximum reductions of 80 % in thickness swell and 50 % in linear expansion). The initial mechanical properties of the strawboards decreased as the weight gain increased (maximum reductions of 64 % in strength and 48 % in stiffness).

40|$|A new {{environmentally}} friendly technology for turning agricultural residues like straw into quality value-added composite products using conventional formaldehyde-based resins has been developed, and currently being scaled-up, {{within the framework}} of an EU funded project. The new technology highly favours environmental protection and sustainable development by: • Recovering and re-utilising organic wastes such as straw residues; • Implementing a green solution as an alternative to straw burning and disposal into soil; • Eliminating the release of carbon from decaying straw into air, which contributes to the global warming through greenhouse effect; • Decreasing the constantly growing pressure over the forests for wood resources. Straw has not been utilised before for board production with the use of conventional formaldehyde based resins because its fibre cells are surrounded by a layer of wax/silica. This layer prevents the water based formaldehyde resins-which are widely used today in the industrial fibreboard manufacture- from forming a sufficiently strong bond between the fibres. However, the new technology enables the destruction of the wax/silica layer by using mechanical high shear forces accompanied by a thermal and chemical treatment. This combined chemi-thermo-mechanical process subsequently refines straw and allows the formaldehyde resins to penetrate and adhere the individual straw fibres. The board produced known as <b>strawboard</b> matches MDF (medium density fibreboard from wood) in appearance, surface smoothness and strength...|$|E

40|$|New technologies, {{such as an}} {{efficient}} vapor-compression evaporator, a stationary lime kiln (SLK), and the MixAlco process, compelled us to re-evaluate methods for producing sugar from cane. These technologies allow more water and lime to be used, and they add more value to bagasse. Extracting and preserving the sugars, and lime pretreating the bagasse to enhance biodigestibility, {{all at the same}} time in a pile, was demonstrated to be unfeasible; therefore, sugar extraction must occur before lime treating the bagasse. Sugar extraction should occur countercurrently by lixiviation, where liquid moves in stages opposite to the soaked bagasse (megasse), which is conveyed by screw-press conveyors that gently squeeze the fiber in each stage, improving extraction. The performance of a pilot-scale screw-press conveyor was tested for dewatering capabilities and power consumption. The unoptimized equipment decreased megasse moisture from 96 to 89 %. Simulation of the process suggested that eight stages are necessary to achieve 98 % recovery from typical sugarcane. The cumulative power for the screw-press conveyor system was 17. 0 ? 2. 1 hp?h/ton dry fiber. Thin raw juice preserved with lime for several months showed no sucrose degradation and no quality deterioration, except for reducing sugar destruction. The lime loading needed for 1 -year preservation is 0. 20 g Ca(OH) 2 /g sucrose. Shorter times require less lime. After preservation, the juice was carbonated and filtered, and the resulting sludge pelletized. Due to their high organic content, the pellets were too weak for calcination temperatures used in the SLK. The organics must be decreased prior to pelletization and sodium must be supplemented as a binding agent. Long-term lime pretreatment of bagasse showed two delignification phases: bulk (rapid) and residual (slow). These were modeled by two simultaneous first-order reactions. Treatments with air purging and higher temperatures (50 ? 57 oC) delignified more effectively, especially during the residual phase, thus yielding higher cellulase-enzyme digestibilities after 2 ? 8 weeks of treatment. At temperatures > 60 oC, pure oxygen purging is preferred. Fresh bagasse was of better quality than old bagasse. Treatment with NaOH yielded a larger bulk delignification phase than Ca(OH) 2. Long-term lime pulping of bagasse was unsuitable for copy-quality paper, but it was appropriate for <b>strawboard</b> and other filler applications...|$|E
