Strongly rectifying Kir channels exhibit a very <b>steep</b> <b>voltage</b> dependence resulting in silencing of their activity at depolarized membrane voltages. The mechanism underlying this <b>steep</b> <b>voltage</b> dependence is blockade by endogenous polyamines. These small multifunctional, polyvalent metabolites enter the long Kir channel pore from the intracellular side, displacing multiple occupant ions as they migrate to a stable binding site in the transmembrane region of the channel.

In addition, various channelopathies have been described that result from alteration of the polyamine sensitivity or activity of strongly rectifying channels. The primary {{focus of this article}} is to summarize current knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of polyamine block, and provide some perspective on lingering uncertainties related to this physiologically important mechanism of ion channel blockade.

40|$|Voltage-gated Na+ {{channels}} undergo {{two types}} of inactivation in response to depolarization. One type, fast inactivation, occurs with a time scale of milliseconds. The other, slow inactivation, occurs over seconds to minutes. In addition, these two processes appear to be distinct at the molecular level. However, the molecular mechanism of Na+ channel slow inactivation is unknown. We used patch clamp techniques to study slow inactivation, activation and fast inactivation in α-subunit cDNA clones for wild-type human heart Na+ channels (hH 1) and rat skeletal muscle Na+ channels (μ 1) transiently expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells. Our experiments showed that the Na+ channel slow inactivation phenotype (development, steady state and recovery) differed dramatically between hH 1 and μ 1. Slow inactivation in μ 1 had a faster onset, a <b>steeper</b> <b>voltage</b> dependence, and was more complete compared with hH 1. In addition, recovery from slow inactivation was much slower for μ 1 than for hH 1. Activation and fast inactivation kinetics were also different in hH 1 and μ 1. In hH 1, fast inactivation was slower and V½ values of activation and steady-state fast inactivation (h∞) were more negative than in μ 1. To better understand the molecular basis of Na+ channel slow inactivation, Na+ channel chimaeras were constructed with domains from hH 1 and μ 1. The slow inactivation phenotype in the chimaeras (domains denoted by subscripts) μ 1 (1) hH 1 (2, 3, 4), μ 1 (1, 2) hH 1 (3, 4) and μ 1 (1, 2, 3) hH 1 (4) was intermediate {{compared with that of}} wild-type. However, the chimaera μ 1 (1) hH 1 (2, 3, 4) was more like wild-type hH 1, while the chimaeras μ 1 (1, 2) hH 1 (3, 4) and μ 1 (1, 2, 3) hH 1 (4) were more similar to wild-type μ 1. In the chimaeras, activation resembled that of μ 1, fast inactivation resembled that of hH 1, and steady-state fast inactivation fell between that of hH 1 and μ 1. The data demonstrate that all four domains can modulate the Na+ channel slow inactivation phenotype. However, domains D 1 and D 2 may play a more prominent role in determining Na+ channel slow inactivation phenotype than D 3 and D 4. The results also support previous conclusions that D 3 and D 4 (and the D 3 –D 4 linker) {{play an important role in}} Na+ channel fast inactivation, and that activation may require non-equivalent contributions from all four domains...|$|R
40|$|Pre-mature {{failures}} of wind turbine step up (WTSU) transformers {{have been reported}} in the wind farms although, the failed transformers had previously passed all quality assurance tests and had assembled all standard requirements. Vacuum circuit breaker (VCB) initiated steep front transient impact is one of the potential causes of such insulation failures. The use of VCB as switching devices and intense cable network increases the likelihood for high frequency transient overvoltages (TOVs) in wind farms. Multiple prestrikes and restrikes of VCB in conjunction with cable capacitance and inductance of transformer give rise to fast <b>steep</b> front <b>voltage</b> transients which eventually cause insulation failures in WTSU transformer. This emphasizes the need to conduct switching transient analysis studies for wind power plants, to investigate the severe switching overvoltages experienced by WTSU transformers. In this work, high frequency modeling in a broad frequency range for major components of the wind farms and an investigation of switching transients on WTSU transformer are presented. An adaptive model of VCB capable of simulating statistical phenomena and overvoltages on circuit breaker and the components that it interacts with is developed in PSCAD/EMTDC. A high frequency phase model of single core cable, taking into account the high frequency effect of cable, i. e., electromagnetic transient propagation, skin effect and reflections is simulated in PSCAD/EMTDC. A linear wideband frequency-dependent black box model of an actual WTSU transformer based on the experimental determination of admittance matrix in a wide frequency range and subjecting the measured admittance matrix to an approximation by means of a rational function through vector fitting is used to simulate WTSU transformer. The rational function obtained for WTSU transformer can then be realized into an RLC network for time domain simulations in PSCAD/EMTDC. A test bench is simulated using the above mentioned high frequency models and replicating Type-IV wind turbine generator synchronized with the grid. Transient scenarios are investigated to understand the most severe switching transients experienced by WTSU transformers, considering the worst repeated switching transient overvoltages and the <b>steep</b> rate of <b>voltage</b> rise experienced by the WTSU transformer.

It is postulated that the ion-exchanged Li+ occupies sites within the sitinakite framework which are desirable for electrochemically inserted lithium, reducing electrochemical occupancy and hence capacity. Improved electrochemical performance has been realized through the heat treatment of electrodes with capacities after 20 cycles in the range 180 - 200 mA h g- 1.

At position 169 C (between the D 172 “rectification controller” and the selectivity filter), modification by either 2 -aminoethyl MTS (MTSEA) or 2 -(trimethylammonium) ethyl MTS (MTSET) reduced the potency and voltage dependence of spermine block, consistent with this position overlapping the spermine binding site. At position 176 C (between D 172 and the M 2 helix bundle crossing), modification by MTSEA also weakened spermine block. In contrast, MTSET modification of 176 C dramatically slowed the kinetics of spermine unblock, with almost no effect on potency or voltage dependence.

The biophysical properties and molecular profile of IK,L are still largely unknown. By using the patch-clamp whole-cell technique, we examined the voltage- and time-dependent properties of IK,L in Type I hair cells of the mouse semicircular canal. We found that the biophysical properties of IK,L were affected by an unstable K(+) equilibrium potential (Veq K(+)). Both the outward and inward K(+) currents shifted Veq K(+) consistent with K(+) accumulation or depletion, respectively, in the extracellular space, which we attributed to a residual calyx attached to the basolateral membrane of the hair cells. We therefore optimized the hair cell dissociation protocol in order to isolate mature Type I hair cells without their calyx. In these cells, the uncontaminated IK,L showed a half-activation at - 79. 6  mV and a <b>steep</b> <b>voltage</b> dependence (2. 8  mV).

In the present study, we investigate the effects of voltage, pH, Cl−, and Ca 2 + on native ClC-K 2 in the basolateral membrane of intercalated cells from the mouse connecting tubule. The ∼ 10 -pS channel shows a <b>steep</b> <b>voltage</b> dependence such that channel activity increases with membrane depolarization. Intracellular pH (pHi) and extracellular pH (pHo) differentially modulate the voltage dependence curve: alkaline pHi flattens the curve by causing an increase in activity at negative voltages, whereas alkaline pHo shifts the curve toward negative voltages. In addition, pHi, pHo, and extracellular Ca 2 + strongly increase activity, mainly because of an increase in the number of active channels with a comparatively minor effect on channel open probability. Furthermore, voltage alters both the number of active channels and their open probability, whereas intracellular Cl− has little influence. We propose that changes in the number of active channels correspond to them entering or leaving an inactivated state, whereas modulation of open probability corresponds to common gating by these channels. We suggest that pH, through the combined effects of pHi and pHo on ClC-K 2, might be a key regulator of NaCl absorption and Cl−/HCO 3 − exchange in type B intercalated cells...|$|E

In all cases, block measured at the maximum peak current at a test potential of 0 mV after promoting recovery from inactivation (I→O) was lower than that observed at the end of 5 -s pulses (I+O). Levobupivacaine, ropivacaine and bupivacaine accelerated HERG inactivation kinetics, slowed the recovery from inactivation and shifted the inactivation curve towards more negative membrane potentials. The three local anaesthetics induced a rapid time-dependent decline after using a protocol that quickly activates HERG channels. All these results suggest that: (1) these drugs bind to the open and the inactivated states of HERG channels, (2) they stabilize HERG channels in the inactivated state, and (3) block induced by bupivacaine enantiomers is stereoselective...|$|E
40|$|Mouse and rat chromaffin cells (MCCs, RCCs) fire spontaneously at {{rest and}} their {{activity}} is mainly {{supported by the}} two L-type Ca 2 + channels expressed in these cells (Cav 1. 2 and Cav 1. 3). Using Cav 1. 3 −/− KO MCCs we have shown that Cav 1. 3 possess all the prerequisites for carrying subthreshold currents that sustain low frequency cell firing near resting (0. 5 to 2 Hz at − 50 mV) : 1 low-threshold and <b>steep</b> <b>voltage</b> dependence of activation, slow and incomplete inactivation during pulses of several hundreds of milliseconds. Cav 1. 2 contributes also to pacemaking MCCs and possibly even Na+ channels may participate in the firing of {{a small percentage of}} cells. We now show that at potentials near resting (− 50 mV), Cav 1. 3 carries equal amounts of Ca 2 + current to Cav 1. 2 but activates at 9 mV more negative potentials. MCCs express only TTX-sensitive Nav 1 channels that activate at 24 mV more positive potentials than Cav 1. 3 and are fully inactivating. Their blockade prevents the firing only in a small percentage of cells (13 %). This suggests that the order of importance with regard to pacemaking MCCs is: Cav 1. 3, Cav 1. 2 and Nav 1. The above conclusions, however, rely on the proper use of DHPs, whose blocking potency is strongly holding potential dependent. We also show that small increases of KCl concentration steadily depolarize the MCCs causing abnormally increased firing frequencies, lowered and broadened AP waveforms and an increased facility of switching “non-firing” into “firing” cells that may lead to erroneous conclusions about the role of Cav 1. 3 and Cav 1. 2 as pacemaker channels in MCCs. ...|$|E
40|$|Previously undescribed high {{conductance}} single anion channels from frog {{skeletal muscle}} sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) were studied in native membrane using the "sarcoball" technique (Stein and Palade, 1988). Excised inside-out patches recorded in symmetrical 200 mM TrisCl show the conductance of the channel's predominant state was 505 +/- 25 pS (n = 35). From reversal potentials, the Pcl/PK ratio was 45. The slope conductance vs. Cl- ion concentration curve saturates at 617 pS, with K 0. 5 estimated at 77 mM. The steady-state open probability (Po) vs. holding potential relationship produces a bell-shaped curve, with Po values reaching a maximum near 1. 0 at 0 mV, and falling off to 0. 05 at +/- 25 mV. Kinetic {{analysis of the}} voltage dependence reveals that while open time constants are decreased somewhat by increases in potential, the largest effect {{is an increase in}} long closed times. Despite the channel's high conductance, it maintains a moderate selectivity for smaller anions, but will not pass larger anions such as gluconate, as determined by reversal-potential shifts. At least two substates different from the main open level are distinguishable. These properties are unlike those described for mitochondrial voltage- dependent anion channels or skeletal muscle surface membrane Cl channels and since SR Ca channels are present in equally high density in sarcoball patches, we propose these sarcoball anion channels originate from the SR. Preliminary experiments recording currents from frog SR anion channels fused into liposomes indicate that either biochemical isolation and/or alterations in lipid environment greatly decrease the channel's voltage sensitivity. These results help underline the potential significance of using sarcoballs to study SR channels. The <b>steep</b> <b>voltage</b> sensitivity of the sarcoball anion channel suggests that it could be more actively involved in the regulation of Ca 2 + transport by the SR...|$|E
40|$|The passive matrix {{liquid crystal}} {{displays}} (LCDs), multiplexing {{is achieved by}} using the intrinsic non-linear characteristics of the liquid-crystal material. If the electro-optic charateristic is steeper than necessary for the matrix display, the selection ratio need not be maximized. Instead, the selection ratio {{can be reduced to}} match the electro-optic characteristics of the display. This leads to the reduction in the supply voltage of the drive electronics. We have considered the possibility of using addressing techniques with low hardware complexity along with dispalys having <b>steep</b> electro-opticcharacteristics. Supply <b>voltage</b> for these techniques are compared with that of multi-line addressing (MLA). The supply votages of the Hybrid Addressing Technique (HAT), Improved Hybrid Addressing Technique- 53 (IHAT- 53), and Improved Hybrid Addressing Technique-S 4 (IHAT-S 4) are lower than that of MLA for the lower range of N. These hybrid addressing techniques with lower hardware complexity are a better choice for driving passive-matrix LCDs, especially in portable equipment...|$|R
40|$|With the {{background}} of experience from field investigations in cable networks, multiple pre-strikes and re-ignitions are known to occur during switching operations, causing high frequency, <b>steep</b> fronted transient <b>voltages</b> and currents. Off-shore collection grids consist of vast amount of cables, with different length and connection points, which have low surge impedance compared with overhead lines. Consequently multiple pre-strikes and re-ignitions of switching apparatus with cables can cause transient overvoltages with higher time-derivatives than with overhead lines. The validation test circuits specified in the IEC standards developed for impulses due to fulmination on overhead lines do not consider the conditions of large cable grid and repetitive overvoltages due to switching. With the increase of cable grids and particularly wind parks, it has become important to characterize a collection grid cable system and the related transients during manoeuvres with different switching apparatus. The main contribution of this work is the experimental verification of the transient overvoltage phenomena in cable systems. An attempt is made to characterize this phenomenon in terms of number of re-ignitions, the magnitude {{and the rate of}} voltage step...|$|R
40|$|The authors [1] {{presented}} an interesting method {{to extract the}} transfer function from the equivalent circuit of a two-winding trans-former. The equivalent circuit {{is based on the}} nodal conductance matrix G, nodal reciprocal inductance matrix, and nodal capacitance matrix C. So far, there were many articles published so that the transfer function of a particular transformer was extracted from the measured transformer terminal impedance. The method presented here is clear and easily applicable by making use of the powerful Matlab functions. Furthermore, one can determine the resonance frequencies of a particular transformer more accurately. To show the applicability, a lightning impulse at the transformer ter-minal is applied and a response {{at the end of the}} first pi-section (Fig. 1) is computed. These results are according to the expectations. We would appreciate an answer to the following questions: • In the particular case, it is not clearly defined whether a pi-section corresponds to a coil, a group of coils, or a turn (Fig. 2). In most cases, the transformer might suffer from <b>steep</b> interturn <b>voltages.</b> The authors claim that by using this method, there is no limit on the size of the network. To preserve reasonable calculation times and memory usage in today’s personal computers, can the authors comment on the size of the network model when all interturn volt-ages needs to be calculated? • For short-time intervals (1 s) within peak voltages, the effect of the losses is not significant [2]. However, for longer time intervals (a few hundreds of microseconds), not only might the winding losses have a significant influence but also the core losses due to the flux penetration inside the core [3]. How do the authors repre-sent the losses (r 0) in their case? How do they calculate the induc-tances, the reciprocal inductance matrix, and the capacitance matrix C...|$|R
