5|$|The {{rivalry between}} Rey Mysterio and CM Punk was {{continued}} from several previous pay-per-views. After months of feuding, Mysterio challenged Punk to a <b>Straight</b> <b>Edge</b> Society Pledge vs. Hair match at Over the Limit. Had Punk won, Mysterio would {{have joined the}} <b>Straight</b> <b>Edge</b> Society, Punk's faction which promoted the <b>straight</b> <b>edge</b> lifestyle. Had Mysterio won however, Punk agreed to have his head shaved. On May 14, Mysterio and Punk faced {{each other in a}} singles match, but the <b>Straight</b> <b>Edge</b> Society (Luke Gallows, Serena, and a mystery masked man) interfered and attacked Mysterio. The following week, Mysterio interrupted an initiation ceremony, in which Punk was shaving the heads of three men to induct them into the <b>Straight</b> <b>Edge</b> Society, and mocked Punk, claiming everyone would be laughing at Punk when he was shaved bald at Over the Limit. Later that night, Mysterio teamed with Montel Vontavious Porter to defeat Punk and Gallows in a tag team match.|$|E
5|$|On June 24, 2006, Punk {{made his}} ECW debut during a house {{show at the}} former ECW Arena, {{defeating}} Stevie Richards. He made his TV debut on the July 4 ECW on Sci Fi, cutting a brief pre-taped promo about his <b>straight</b> <b>edge</b> lifestyle emphasizing the disciplinary aspects of being drug and alcohol free. Although he had retained the <b>straight</b> <b>edge</b> gimmick, he now had a Muay Thai training background. Punk made his TV wrestling debut on August 1 at the Hammerstein Ballroom, defeating Justin Credible. Punk established himself in ECW by going undefeated, defeating opponents such as Christopher W. Anderson, Stevie Richards and Shannon Moore.|$|E

5|$|The third {{match on}} the card was a <b>Straight</b> <b>Edge</b> Society pledge vs. hair match, between CM Punk and Rey Mysterio. For this match, the other <b>Straight</b> <b>Edge</b> Society members (Serena and Luke Gallows) were banned from ringside. Early on in the match, Punk threw Mysterio headfirst {{out of the ring}} into the barber chair at ringside. Punk had {{suffered}} a cut to the head prior to the exchange, and while Mysterio was on the floor, the match was halted so that the blood could be cleaned up. While Punk's wound was being attended, he dropkicked Mysterio, who was on the ring apron, and began attacking him on the floor to restart the match. After Mysterio missed a splash from the top rope, Punk went to pin him, but Mysterio was able to perform a crucifix cradle on Punk for the victory. The other <b>Straight</b> <b>Edge</b> Society members attacked Mysterio after the match, but he was saved by Kane, which allowed Mysterio to handcuff Punk to the ring ropes and shave his head.|$|E
5|$|Birch {{has stated}} that he views CM Punk as his best friend as Punk, who {{practices}} <b>straight</b> <b>edge,</b> helped him get clean from his past addictions. Punk also bought Mercury's house when {{it was about to}} be foreclosed so Birch wouldn't be out on the street.|$|E

From the wing roots two slender beams extend rearwards to cropped triangular fins, linked by a <b>straight</b> <b>edged</b> tailplane at about one third fin height. The unbalanced rudders are rectangular.|$|R
50|$|The {{fuselage}} of the Hi 21 {{was largely}} a wooden, ply skinned monocoque but the forward part around the cockpit was steel tube framed to protect its occupants. They sat side-by side ahead of the leading edge under a multi-part glazed canopy which ended, slightly raised above the upper fuselage line, over the wing. The empennage was conventional, with a <b>straight</b> <b>edged</b> tailplane mounted {{on top of the}} fuselage and carrying <b>straight</b> <b>edged,</b> rounded tipped and balanced elevators. A small, <b>straight</b> <b>edged</b> fin {{at the rear of the}} tailplane carried a balanced, rounded rudder which reached down to the keel and worked within an elevator cut-out.|$|R

5|$|A {{powerful}} Senate Select Committee {{oversaw the}} NCDC and renowned British architect Sir William Holford {{was brought in}} to fine-tune Griffin's original plans. He changed the central basin's geometry so that it was no longer a segment of circle; he converted the southern <b>straight</b> <b>edge</b> into a polygonal shape with three edges and inserted a gulf on the northern shore. The result was closer to Scrivener's modified design some decades earlier.|$|E

In October 2006, she began filming Boot Camp (originally titled <b>Straight</b> <b>Edge).</b> The film was not released in theatres in the United States, but was released on DVD on August 25, 2009.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} effect of {{different}} thermal cutting methods on the fatigue life of high strength steel S 890 Q. The investigation covers flame, plasma and laser cutting methodologies, and specimens with rectangular sections and cut <b>straight</b> <b>edges.</b> The experimental program is composed of 30 specimens that were conducted to failure by applying fatigue cycles with a stress ratio (R) of 0. 1 in a high frequency testing machine. The resultant best-fit S-N curves have been compared, revealing a better performance for laser cut <b>straight</b> <b>edges.</b> Moreover, the corresponding Eurocode 3 FAT class has been derived {{for each of the}} three cutting methods, resulting in FAT 160 in all cases. This suggests that the use Eurocode 3 FAT 125, which is the fatigue class currently provided for flame cut <b>straight</b> <b>edges,</b> is an overconservative assumption for thermally cut <b>straight</b> <b>edges</b> in steel S 890 Q, regardless of the thermal cutting technique being used (flame, laser or plasma) ...|$|R

5|$|Following his stint with WWE, Birch {{continued}} his wrestling career, appearing at several independent promotions, including competing at Ring of Honor events. In March 2008, {{he returned to}} OVW, where he won the OVW Television Championship on one occasion. In October 2008, Birch announced his retirement from professional wrestling, following an injury, but later returned to wrestling in 2010, working for WWE as a producer and making a brief in-ring return as part of CM Punk's <b>Straight</b> <b>Edge</b> Society. He returned to TV once again in 2014 alongside Jamie Noble as an on screen security guard for the WWE World Heavyweight Champion Seth Rollins as part of The Authority faction.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Birch {{came out}} of {{retirement}} and returned to WWE at the SmackDown tapings on April 20, where he lost to Shelton Benjamin in a dark match. On April 25 at Extreme Rules, he reappeared on television as a masked member of CM Punk's The <b>Straight</b> <b>Edge</b> Society stable and interfered in Punk's match with Rey Mysterio, helping him pick up the win. Birch continued to interfere in Punk's matches during the following months, before being unmasked by Big Show on the July 23 episode of SmackDown. This led to a handicap match at SummerSlam where Big Show defeated the entire Society. In early September {{it was reported that}} Mercury had undergone surgery on a torn pectoral muscle.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, The Miz began a {{rivalry with}} MVP {{that began with}} a {{critically}} well-received verbal exchange between the two. The two met in an unadvertised match for the United States Championship at the Royal Rumble event with Miz retaining his title, but in the Royal Rumble match itself MVP eliminated both himself and The Miz. During the rivalry with MVP, Miz began showing signs of an allegiance with The Big Show and on the February 8 episode of Raw, the two defeated champions D-Generation X (Triple H and Shawn Michaels) and The <b>Straight</b> <b>Edge</b> Society (CM Punk and Luke Gallows) to become the Unified WWE Tag Team Champions, making Miz the first wrestler in WWE history to hold three championships {{at the same time}} (U.S., World Tag Team, and WWE Tag Team Champion).|$|E

5|$|The <b>straight</b> <b>edge</b> of the {{circular}} segment {{that formed the}} central basin of Lake Burley Griffin was perpendicular to the land axis and designated the water axis, and it extended northwest towards Black Mountain. A line parallel to the water axis, on the northern side of the city, was designated the municipal axis. The municipal axis became the location of Constitution Avenue, which links City Hill in Civic Centre and both Market Centre and the Defence precinct on Russell Hill. Commonwealth Avenue and Kings Avenue were to run from the southern side from Capital Hill to City Hill and Market Centre on the north respectively, and they formed the western and eastern edges of the central basin. The area enclosed by the three avenues {{was known as the}} Parliamentary Triangle, and formed the centrepiece of Griffin's work.|$|E

5|$|Embarrassed {{by being}} shaved bald, as he {{considered}} himself always pure unlike his followers, Punk began wearing a mask {{to hide his}} baldness. At Fatal 4-Way, Punk challenged for the World Heavyweight Championship against Mysterio, Big Show and the champion Jack Swagger, but was unsuccessful when he was attacked by Kane, who was accusing various people of attacking The Undertaker. On July 16, Punk was finally unmasked by Big Show while healing from an arm injury. The following week, Show also unmasked the anonymous member of the <b>Straight</b> <b>Edge</b> Society, who was revealed to be Joey Mercury. This led to a handicap match at SummerSlam where Show defeated the entire Society after Punk abandoned his teammates. Show also beat Punk in a singles match at Night of Champions. Following this, Serena was released from WWE while Mercury became injured, severely thinning the Society. Gallows began showing signs of dissension too, and Punk defeated him on SmackDown, airing September 24, ending the group.|$|E

5|$|His {{character}} {{took on a}} {{more sinister}} direction on the November 27, 2009, episode of SmackDown when he revealed that he had converted Luke Gallows, who had previously been portrayed as the mentally incompetent wrestler Festus, to the straight-edge lifestyle which had rid him of his mental troubles. Continuing to espouse his straight-edge philosophy, Punk began to present himself as a cult-like savior to the crowd, growing the hair on his head, face and chest in an allusion to Jesus. Through January 2010, Punk began to convert planted {{members of the audience}} to a straight-edge lifestyle, making them take a pledge of allegiance to him and shaving their head as a sign of renewal and devotion. After converting many people who were not seen again, convert Serena began accompanying Punk and Gallows to form the <b>Straight</b> <b>Edge</b> Society. As well as leading this alliance, Punk was also the mentor of WWE NXT rookie Darren Young who flirted with the idea of becoming straight-edge before refusing just before his head was to be shaved.|$|E
5|$|On December 21, Triple H {{announced}} that Hornswoggle {{was the new}} DX mascot. This came about after Hornswoggle sued DX for emotional and physical distress due to them not allowing him to join DX. After being taken to court where they were ruled guilty by a jury and judge consisting of dwarves, Michaels told Triple H that Hornswoggle could be the mascot. Triple H agreed to it only if the charges were dropped, which Hornswoggle agreed to. On January 11, 2010 episode of Raw, Mike Tyson, who was the Raw guest host for the night, teamed with Jericho to face DX; however, {{at the end of}} the bout, Tyson turned on Jericho and aligned himself with Triple H and Michaels. On the February 8 episode of Raw, DX lost the Unified Tag Team Championship to ShoMiz (The Miz and Big Show) in a triple threat elimination tag match, also involving The <b>Straight</b> <b>Edge</b> Society (CM Punk and Luke Gallows). On the March 1 episode of Raw, they lost a rematch for the title. This was their last televised match before Michaels retired. Michaels and Triple H had a non-wrestling reunion at the 2010 Tribute to the Troops.|$|E
25|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 2000s, only small groups of militant <b>straight</b> <b>edge</b> individuals remained. Contrary to news reports that portrayed <b>straight</b> <b>edge</b> as a gang, several studies have shown that <b>straight</b> <b>edge</b> individuals as a whole are mostly peaceful people. In the 2000s, there was a growing amount of tolerance of people who do not follow the <b>straight</b> <b>edge</b> lifestyle by <b>straight</b> <b>edge</b> individuals. In this incarnation of <b>straight</b> <b>edge,</b> the musical styles of the bands involved are more varied, ranging from a youth crew revival style to metalcore to posicore. <b>Straight</b> <b>edge</b> bands from the 2000s include Champion, Down to Nothing, Embrace Today, Have Heart, and Throwdown.|$|E
