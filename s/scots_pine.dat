5|$|Clan badge: There {{have been}} two clan badges (or plant badges) {{attributed}} to Clan MacAulay: cranberry and <b>scots</b> <b>pine.</b> Both clans MacAulay and MacFarlane have been attributed with a badge of cranberry. Clan MacFarlane, also a west-Dumbartonshire clan, claims a descent from Alwyn II, Earl of Lennox. The badge of <b>scots</b> <b>pine</b> {{has been attributed to}} all seven clans of Siol Alpin: Clan Grant, Clan Gregor, Clan MacAulay, Clan Macfie, Clan Mackinnon, Clan Macnab, and Clan MacQuarrie.|$|E
5|$|Suillus bovinus {{has been}} {{introduced}} into other areas. In North America, where it {{is thought to have}} been introduced with <b>Scots</b> <b>pine,</b> it is found in the eastern United States, including North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Vermont, and the Adirondack Mountains of New York. It has been recorded infrequently under <b>Scots</b> <b>pine</b> in Australia, where it has been found as far north as southern Queensland, and in more southerly locations including New South Wales and Kuitpo Forest. It has been recorded in New Zealand. In South Africa, it grows with Pinus radiata.|$|E

40|$|The {{lab test}} {{conducted}} to determine the tensile shear strength of <b>Scot</b> <b>pine</b> against longitudinal shear according to EN 20 - 1. The tensile shear strength of <b>Scot</b> <b>pine</b> with two different adhesives i. e. semi structured adhesive such as PVAC (Poly Vinyl Acetate) and structured adhesive i. e. PF (Phenol Formaldehyde) was tested in bonded specimens of <b>Scot</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus sylvestris L.) sapwood. Altogether 40 specimens (10 / 10) for each adhesive (and state) were tested in two different (dry and wet) states. The test was conducted in fully automated computer programmed machine named Zwick Z 010 / Zwick Roell using testXpert II software. The lab results {{show that there is}} similar tensile shear strength between PVAC and PF bonded <b>Scot</b> <b>pine</b> in dry state whereas they differ highly in wet state...|$|R

50|$|The <b>Scots</b> <b>pines</b> found {{along the}} western cliff (Touchadam Craig) of Gillies Hill are relicts of an ancient {{pinewood}} supported by presence of the fungal species Russula integra var. integra. This ten hectare section of the hill extends from the old quarries in the north to Wallstale Dun {{in the south and}} includes the North and South Pincers, the arms of whinstone which visually hide the more recent quarry operations. In addition to the <b>Scots</b> <b>pines</b> on Touchadam Craig, four others found elsewhere on the hill including the 5th, the 10th and the 11th largest <b>Scots</b> <b>pines</b> in the UK, are currently registered with the Woodland Trust’s Ancient Tree Hunt project. These and the ~50 other pines display a significant pinewood in the Stirling Council region.Threats to the pinewood include vandalism, invasive plants (Rhododendron and Acaena) and the prospect of renewed quarrying activity. Currently the number of dead pine snags increases relative to proximity to the former quarry core.|$|R
5|$|Maple {{and lime}} forests {{are found in}} gulleys. These forests are only present in {{isolated}} areas and {{are at risk of}} extinction. Downy oak woods are more common in the Aosta Valley area than in the Piedmont area because of its higher temperatures and lower precipitation. Oak is not a typical species in the park and it is often found mixed with <b>Scots</b> <b>pine.</b> The park's chestnut groves have been affected by human cultivation for wood and fruit. It rarely grows above 1,000 metres (3,280ft), and the most important chestnut forests are in the park's Piedmontese side. The park's conifer woods include <b>Scots</b> <b>pine</b> groves, spruce forests dominated by the Norway spruce, often mixed with larch. Larch and Swiss stone pine woods are found up to the highest sub-alpine level (2200–2300 metres (7,217-7,546ft)).|$|E
5|$|Four {{areas of}} {{woodland}} containing 157 trees has been planted by The Life for a Life Charity {{around the lake}} on the Restaurant side, for the cremated remains of loved ones to be placed beneath them. These forests contain <b>Scots</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus sylvestris), English oak (Quercus robur), rowan (Sorbus aucuparia) and the silver birch (Betula pendula).|$|E
5|$|Strobilurus tenacellus is a {{saprobic}} wood-rotting fungus. It fruits singly or {{in small}} groups on fallen and often partially buried cones of <b>Scots</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus sylvestris), European black pine (Pinus nigra) and sometimes spruce (Picea) in coniferous and mixed forests. It is found in Europe and Asia, {{where it has been}} recorded in Japan and Jordan. In Europe, the fungus usually fruits from March to June. Its occurrence is occasional.|$|E
25|$|Steppe {{formations}} are prevalent geographic {{features of}} this province, occupying about 60% of the surface area, much of it fertile. Forested areas are small, mainly consisting of <b>scots</b> <b>pines</b> and oaks.|$|R

5|$|Below {{the tree}} line there are several zones of climax forest. Birch dominates {{to the west and}} north, <b>Scots</b> <b>Pine</b> with Birch and oak in the eastern Highlands and oak (both Quercus robur and Q. petrea) with Birch in the Central Lowlands and Borders. Much of the Scottish {{coastline}} consists of machair, a fertile dune pasture land formed as sea levels subsided after the last ice age. Machairs have received considerable ecological and conservational attention, chiefly because of their unique ecosystems.|$|E
5|$|Blagdon Lake is {{designated}} a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) of , created in 1971, {{largely because of}} the variety of species and habitats. The area around the pumping station was laid out as an ornamental woodland which includes <b>Scots</b> <b>pine,</b> Cedar, Larch, Spruce, Oak, Beech, Chestnut, Willow, Lime, Holly and Maple. A variety of orchids including green-winged orchid (Anacamptis morio) and southern marsh-orchids can be seen on the borders of the lake.|$|E
5|$|Suillus bovinus {{is found}} in conifer woods and {{plantations}} across Europe, including subalpine regions in the Alps, up to altitudes of 800m (2500ft). It is common in Lithuania, where it associates with <b>Scots</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus sylvestris), the only naturally occurring pine in that country. Preferred soils of S.bovinus are often acidic, sand-based, or sometimes calcareous (chalky) and moraine. In Asia, it has been recorded in Taiwan, and in Japan, where it associates with Japanese red pine (Pinus densiflora). In China, it has been recorded from provinces Anhui, Fujian, Guangdong, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang.|$|E
50|$|In January 1953, work {{started on}} a {{plantation}} of <b>Scots</b> <b>pines</b> in the Main Field, {{in the shape of}} the new Queen's cypher; EIIR. Despite damage by the storms of 1987 and 1990, the original shape is still clearly visible.|$|R
5|$|In 1910, it was {{reported}} that the tree had lost its leaves, though others suggest a date of 1913, and it was completely dead by 1915. <b>Scots</b> <b>pines</b> have a natural lifespan of up to over 700 years, depending on the region.|$|R
50|$|The kettle hole {{has deep}} {{waterlogged}} peat soils supporting a carr woodland of birch (Betula sp.) with <b>Scot’s</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus sylvestris). The woodland floor has bog-mosses (Sphagnum spp.), and hare’s-tail cotton grass (Eriophorum vaginatum) with purple moor-grass (Molinia caerulea) and wavy hair-grass (Deschampsia flexuosa).|$|R
5|$|The {{small and}} {{medium-sized}} fields around the lake are generally bounded by hedges and occasionally by tree belts and woodland, some of which {{date back to the}} most evident period of enclosure of earlier open fields which took place in the late medieval period. Mature oak (Quercus) and ash (Fraxinus excelsior) trees are characteristic of the area with occasional groups of <b>Scots</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus sylvestris) and chestnuts (Castanea sativa). Many elm (Ulmus) trees have been lost in this area, and dead/dying elms are also evident in the surrounding landscape.|$|E
5|$|A multi-year {{field study}} {{of the growth of}} R.emetica {{production}} in a <b>scots</b> <b>pine</b> plantation in Scotland found that total productivity was 0.24–0.49 million mushrooms per hectare per year (roughly 0.1–0.2 million mushrooms/acre/year), corresponding to a fresh weight of 265–460kg per hectare per year (49–85 lb/acre/year). Productivity was highest from August to October. The longevity of the mushrooms was estimated to be 4–7 days. In a {{study of the}} fungal diversity of ectomycorrhizal species in a Sitka spruce forest, R.emetica was one of the top five dominant fungi. Comparing the frequency of fruit body production between 10-, 20-, 30-, or 40-year-old forest stands, R.emetica was most prolific in the latter.|$|E
5|$|Although today crest badges {{are more}} {{commonly}} used by clan members, the original badges worn by clansmen were plant badges or clan badges. Clan badges consisted of plants which were worn on a bonnet or attached to a pole or spear. There have been several clan badges attributed to Clan Macfie, and the clans shares the use of them with several associated clans. Clan badges attributed to Clan Macfie include: <b>scots</b> <b>pine</b> (Scottish Gaelic: giuthas), attributed to all seven of the clans of Siol Alpin; oak (Scottish Gaelic: darag), also attributed to Clan Cameron; crowberry (Scottish Gaelic: dearca fithich), also attributed to Clan Maclean and Clan Cameron.|$|E
5000|$|Before the Plantation {{was created}} the wartime {{occupation}} was evident {{on the ground}} with concrete blocks on the surface, partially rotted logs 'nailed' together with ½" [...] spikes. In some of the standing <b>Scots</b> <b>Pines</b> were mounted insulators for carrying wire - presumably for their telephone system.|$|R
40|$|Sampling of the macrofungal sporocarps, ectomycorrhizal morphotypes and {{vascular}} plants {{was carried}} out in 28 plots from four forest types (ash, oak, <b>Scot’s</b> <b>pine,</b> Sitka spruce) between the years 2007 and 2009. A total of 409 macrofungal species, 51 ectomycorrhizal morphotypes and 68 vascular plant species were recorded over the three years. It was found that at equal sampling intensities, {{there were no significant differences}} in total macrofungal species or ectomycorrhizal morphotype richness between the oak, <b>Scot’s</b> <b>pine</b> and Sitka spruce forest types. Species richness estimation revealed that between 45 and 77 % of the aboveground macrofungal species richness and between 57 and 100 % of the belowground ectomycorrhizal morphotype richness were recorded. Cortinarius, Mycena, Russula, Lactarius and Inocybe were the most species-rich genera recorded. Forty-eight macrofungal species are new records to Ireland and five of the species recorded are on the British Red-Data List. Based on sporocarp frequency over the three year’s sampling, distinctive macrofungal communities were distinguished using nonmetric multi-dimension scaling, which corresponded to the dominant tree type of the forest. Ash forests lacked the ectomycorrhizal species component, oak forests had many wood- and litter-decay species present, <b>Scot’s</b> <b>pine</b> forests had some specific Lactarius species present (e. g. L. rufus, L. hepaticus) and Sitka spruce forests had a large diversity of Mycena species. The below-ground ectomycorrhizal communities were surveyed in soil cores taken from four plots from each of three of the forest types. The ectomycorrhizal communities of the forest types (oak, <b>Scot’s</b> <b>pine</b> and Sitka spruce) were distinctly different according to the dominant tree species of the plot. The use of mantle descriptions, RFLP and sequencing methods allowed for the identification of 36 ectomycorrhizal species. The morphology and anatomy of remaining 15 morphotypes is described. The ability of plantation forests to provide a supplementary habitat for native fungal species richness and diversity is discussed. COFOR...|$|R
50|$|The squirrelpox {{virus is}} {{predicted}} to spread by the grey squirrels as they act as a vector for the virus. Further, a separate model examining {{the effects of the}} spread of the grey squirrel on the health of <b>Scots</b> and Lodgepole <b>pines</b> showed that grey squirrels will spread Red Band Needle Blight (RBNB), decreasing the population of Lodgepole pines exponentially, and that <b>Scot</b> <b>pine</b> populations will decrease slower due to fungal growth resulting from the bark-stripping behavior of the grey squirrel.|$|R
5|$|Amanita regalis is a {{rare species}} {{typically}} found growing {{on the ground in}} mountainous forests, both deciduous and coniferous. It is a mycorrhizal fungus, and exists in a symbiotic relationship with certain tree species. The system of fine below-ground threads, the mycelium, envelopes the roots of the trees and supplies them with needed minerals, trace elements and water from the soil, while the tree, in turn, supplies the fungus with food from its own supply, which it produces through photosynthesis. A.regalis has been shown experimentally to form mycorrhiza with birch, <b>Scots</b> <b>pine,</b> Mountain pine, and Norway spruce. Fruit bodies have been reported to grow in fairy rings.|$|E
5|$|Boletus pinophilus forms ectomycorrhizal {{relationships}} with pine (Pinus), fir (Abies) and spruce (Picea). It {{can therefore be}} located wherever those trees grow, particularly with <b>Scots</b> <b>pine</b> in Britain, preferring the poor, acidic, and sandy soils associated with coniferous forests. It appears to favour Pinus, while {{the form of the}} mushroom occurring in association with Abies and Picea has been labeled Boletus pinophilus var. fuscoruber. However, it is not confined to coniferous trees and may also be found fruiting in deciduous forests, such as under chestnut trees. Fruiting bodies can occur singly, or in small groups throughout the summer and autumn months, although they are known to appear as early as April in Italy.|$|E
5|$|Ciomadul {{is covered}} by beech and spruce forests. Around St. Ana lake, the {{vegetation}} is mostly formed by Fagus sylvatica (common beech) and Picea abies (Norway spruce) woods. Other trees include Acer platanoides (Norway maple), Betula pendula (silver birch), Carpinus betulus (common hornbeam), Pinus sylvestris (<b>Scots</b> <b>pine),</b> Salix caprea (goat willow) and Salix cinerea (grey willow). A fen contains Carex lasiocarpa (slender sedge), Carex rostrata (bottle sedge), Lysimachia thyrsiflora (tufted loosestrife) and Sphagnum angustifolium (fine bogmoss). At Mohos, vegetation consists of Alnus glutinosa (common alder), Betula pendula and Salix. The peat bog contains trees (Pinus sylvestris and Betula pubescens (downy birch)) and Ericaceae.|$|E
50|$|The Pye {{family had}} <b>Scots</b> <b>pines</b> planted around the summit, {{around the time}} that Faringdon House was rebuilt in the late 18th century.

50|$|Arppe {{promoted}} afforestation {{in order}} to maintain availability of the natural resource. He planted a larch forest between Koivikko and Puhos. The 1847 planted 12-ha forest included 3,000 saplings which were Siberian and European larch, and some local <b>Scots</b> <b>pines</b> and Norway spruces for reference. The forest is the largest larch forest of Finland and it is nowadays natural reserve.|$|R
5000|$|The Edge was {{described}} as a dreary common [...] till the year 1779, when it was enclosed together with all the other waste lands of Alderley. Some hundreds of <b>Scots</b> <b>pines</b> were planted on the highest points by Sir James and Sir Edward Stanley, between 1745 and 1755; before that time, it does not appear that a single tree grew on it.|$|R
5|$|Suillus luteus is {{a pioneer}} species that {{typically}} establishes {{itself in the}} early stages of forest succession. The fungus forms mycorrhizal associations with various species of pine, including <b>Scots</b> <b>pine</b> (P.sylvestris), black pine (P.nigra), and Macedonian pine (P.peuce) in Europe, and red pine (P.resinosa) and white pine (P.strobus) in North America. An in vitro experiment demonstrated that the species could form an ectomycorrhizal association with Aleppo pine (P.halepensis), a key species used in reforestation in the Mediterranean. A study of the ectomycorrhizal fungi associated with a lodgepole pine (P.contorta) invasion front near Coyhaique, Chile, showed that many invasive trees were supported by S.luteus as the sole mycorrhizal partner.|$|E
5|$|The lower {{areas of}} the {{wilderness}} area are covered by a taiga forest of <b>Scots</b> <b>pine.</b> Less common trees include downy birch, goat willow, aspen and rowan. Logging {{in the past has}} mostly occurred in the southern part ("Kessi"), a large proportion of Vätsäri's forests being old-growth forests. The barren soil makes for poor growth conditions and most of the ground vegetation in the forests is subshrubs. One area with limestone rock features green spleenwort. The reserve is located in an area between a western and eastern vegetation zones, giving rise to unique combinations of species, such as Siberian spruce and red cottongrass.|$|E
