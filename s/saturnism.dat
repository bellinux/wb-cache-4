5000|$|According to a {{doctoral}} thesis in 1991, van Gogh {{used in his}} impasto technique lead pigments in an abusive and careless way, and some months later he suffered the key symptoms of lead poisoning (anemia, stomatitis, abdominal pain, signs of radial neuropathy, etc.) and other characteristics of saturnine encephalopathy in Arles with states of delirium and probable epileptic crises, which were diagnosed in life. Regardless of the premorbid personality of Vincent (impulsive and emotionally unstable), these crises with disturbance of consciousness or psychotic symptoms coincided with his prolific artistic activity, and never in the North; as the Dutch painter says in a letter (Letter 607) [...] Other painters exposed to toxic colors suffered lead poisoning. However, this thesis could be confirmed only by a forensic examination of the bones of Van Gogh, as Caravaggio's remains were. Recent chemical research on toxic lead pigments used recklessly by van Gogh reinforces the diagnosis of <b>saturnism.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} reports the {{occurrence}} of lead poisoning in a male, 2 year-old mongrel dog attended at UNESP Botucatu Veterinary Hospital. The animal {{was brought to the}} hospital with claim of gastrointestinal and nervous disturbs for 10 days, worsening in the last 24 hours. After unsuccessfully attempts to control status epileticus, the animal died. Hematological evaluation revealed significant rubricytosis and basophilic stippling, highly suggestive of lead poisoning. Serum lead concentration confirmed toxic levels of this element. Necropsy evidenced the presence of foreign bodies in stomach (one stone and two metallic objects) and, microscopically, characteristic inclusions in renal parenchyma. Fragments obtained from liver and kidneys revealed lead concentrations of 0, 8 μg/g and 25 μg/g, respectively, which in association to clinical signs of <b>saturnism,</b> determined the diagnosis of lead poisoning...|$|E
40|$|In 1572 an {{extensive}} epidemic of disease characterized by severe abdominal colic, later identified as lead poisoning, occurred in France {{in the province}} of Poitou. Citois named the disease colica Pictonum, that is the colic of the Pictones, the ancient Celtic tribe who inhabited the area. There-after the term was used generically for lead poisoning, otherwise plumbism or <b>saturnism.</b> The origin of the poisoning was traced to the practice of vintners who sophisticated sour acid wines with lead oxide. This adulteration restored the sweetness of the wine by the formation of sugar of lead, lead acetate. Similar outbreaks of poisoning were traced to the same fraudulent practice in the wine-growing districts of Germany and Spain. The preparation and storage of food and drink in containers of pewter and lead glazed earthenware resulted in accidental contamination of the substances, the consumption of which caused acute and chronic plumbism. Among the most frequently lead-contaminated liquors was Devonshire cyder, hence Devonshire colic. Occupational lead poisoning was described among lead miners and smelters in the mid-sixteenth century. Thereafter the disease was observed {{in a wide variety of}} trades and processes. The subject was comprehensively reviewed by Tanquerel des Planches in 1839...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} studies on several aspects of {{poisoning}} caused by lead. mercury, manganese, hard metal, nickel, and uranium are reviewed. Studies on lead comprise the development of methods for the determination of lead in biological material, the analysis of pathophysiological processes and clinical manifestations of <b>saturnism,</b> and the elaboration of criteria {{for the assessment of}} working capacity in intoxicated workers. Investigations concerning mercury poisoning include the determination of methods for the determination of mercury in biological material, observations on the pathophysiological and clinical manifestations of mercurialism, and the drawing up of criteria for the assessment of fitness for work in intoxicated workers. In connection with the occurrence of manganism in the production of manganese alloys in Šibenik, studies were conducted on the clinical picture of manganism, technological processes in which the workers were exposed to manganese smoke and dust, and the measures to be undertaken to prevent manganism. Results are presented of the follow up of a group of workers exposed to hard metal dust and the pathogenesis of pneumoconiosis caused by hard metal. Work is reviewed on nickel allergy observed in galvanizers in various industrial establishments. The review also includes results of observations on the harmful effect of uranium; in this connection polarographic methods have been developed for the determination of small amounts of this metal in the blood, urine and kidneys...|$|E
40|$|Background/Aims: To {{examine the}} {{relationships}} among blood lead levels, blood pressure and kidney function in a population-based sample of adults {{in an area of}} China with lead pollution. Methods: This cross-sectional study included a sample of 1447 adults older than 20 years of age who underwent physical examinations in hospitals within a lead-polluted area of China from January to December 2013. Results: Blood lead levels were high among the local population (152. 47 µg/L) and did not change with age (P=. 182). Overall, changes in both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood Pressure (DBP) were associated with changes in blood lead level (P=. 012, P=. 001), whereas BUN and CCr did not change along with the blood lead level (P>. 05). This relationship was strongest among people 20 - 45 years of age; in this group, the beta coefficients for SBP and DBP were 0. 009 (0. 003), P=. 001 and 0. 005 (0. 002), P=. 004, respectively. Compared with young men, young women's blood pressures were more affected by blood lead levels (beta for SBP= 0. 031 for women vs. 0. 008 for men; beta for DBP= 0. 015 for women vs. 0. 005 for men). Conclusion: Continuous lead exposure causes increased blood lead levels among local residents. Blood lead levels are positively associated with both SBP and DBP increases among adults aged 20 - 44 years. The relationships between blood lead levels and SBP and DBP are most pronounced in young women. Chronic <b>saturnism</b> does not increase blood pressure by altering kidney function. These results provide support for continued efforts to control blood pressure in the population living in a lead-polluted region of China, particularly in young women...|$|E
40|$|Des échantillons d’eau et de matière en {{suspension}} ont été prélevés le long de l’oued Moulouya et dans des lacs de carrière {{au niveau}} de l’ancien centre minier de Zeïda (Haute Moulouya, Maroc) en vue d’en évaluer la salubrité. Il est en effet important d’établir le degré et les causes éventuelles de dégradation de la qualité de ces eaux, compte tenu de leur usage à des fins tant domestiques qu’agricoles. Des résidus de traitement ont également été échantillonnés dans les haldes abandonnées. L’analyse des distributions et des variations spatio-temporelles des concentrations de Pb et As a permis de mettre en évidence que le centre minier a véritablement un impact sur la qualité des eaux de surface environnantes, malgré le caractère neutre à alcalin du drainage. Aucune ne rejoint les critères de l’Organisation mondiale de la santé en matière de Pb et As dans l’eau potable (10  µg/L), mais près de la moitié souscrit aux normes marocaines (50  µg/L). L’importance de la dégradation varie selon la saison et la localité, et le contraste entre sites a priori non dégradés et sites dégradés n’est pas toujours très prononcé. On observe même des variations à l’inverse des tendances attendues. Les résultats peuvent cependant être réconciliés en tenant compte de l’importance du transport particulaire par rapport au transport dissous au moment et au lieu de l’échantillonnage. Il appert que les minéralisations et les résidus miniers restés sur place peuvent constituer la principale source de pollution des eaux de surface de la région de Zeïda. The Upper Moulouya Basin was the location of extensive lead mining between 1930 and 1985, with three major operations near Aouli, Mibladen and Zeïda. The Moulouya drains about 7. 5 % of the Moroccan territory and provides drinking and irrigation water to many communities over its more than 500  km path. It is thus important to determine the impact of past mining activities on its water quality, since the mining sites were abandoned {{with little or no}} rehabilitation. This paper focuses on the Zeïda area, the uppermost of these mining centres on the Moulouya. About 630, 172  t of lead concentrates (40 ‑ 70 % Pb) were produced between 1972 and 1985 at Zeïda. Lead was mined from carbonate and sulphide mineral deposits (cerussite, 70 %; galena, 30 %) mixed with barite in stratiform ore bodies hosted by Permo-Triassic arkoses. Mining left 12  Mt and 70  Mt of tailings and wastes in fully exposed piles {{on each side of the}} Moulouya, as well as a dozen water-filled open-stopes. Mine drainage is of neutral pH, thanks to the low content of residual sulphide minerals and the availability of carbonate in the tailings and host rock. The river and some quarry-lakes are tapped to fulfill domestic, agricultural and stock-breeding needs. One lake is used to directly feed Zeïda’s water network (pop. 3, 000), without any water treatment. The Moulouya, upstream and downstream of Zeïda, and four lakes were sampled twice in 2002 (dry period: February; wet period: April). Temperature, electric conductivity (EC), Eh and pH were measured in the field. Samples were filtered through 0. 45  µm membranes. The filtrates were preserved with 4 % HNO 3 and kept at 4 °C until analysis. The filters and their particulate fraction, as well as a composite sample of the tailings, were dried and kept dry until dissolution and analysis. All measurements were performed by ICP-MS and capillary electrophoresis analyses. Lead and arsenic are well above « normal » concentrations in the tailings, at 5, 547  g/t and 192  g/t, respectively. These elements are clear threats to population health, since dust from unstabilized tailings can be dispersed by wind and rain waters, contaminating agricultural soils and surface waters, and eventually leading to cases of <b>saturnism</b> or arsenical intoxication in the population. All Pb and As concentrations measured in the waters sampled are above the World Health Organisation criteria for drinking water (10  µg/L for Pb and As). Nevertheless, about half of these measurements meet the Moroccan criteria (50  µg/L). All samples show near neutral or slightly basic pH values (7. 2 - 8. 9). EC is also high (>  1, 000  µS/cm). As and Pb are largely associated with the particulate fraction (>  80 % of total As and Pb), except for As in two lakes (<  40 %). Overall, their concentrations are higher in the Zeïda area than upstream in the Moulouya. However, this is a tendency rather than a rule, because the differences are often small (<  50 %) and suffer exceptions. For instance, Pb concentrations are 60 % lower than the so-called uncontaminated reference station, in two quarry-lakes sampled during the wet period. The occasional lack of significant and consistent contrast between an obviously degraded environment and a pristine site was unexpected. The results were therefore further investigated, in order to identify possible explanations for the apparent discrepancies. Coherency in the data set emerges when one considers the relative importance of dissolved and particulate transport in the various types of environments sampled. Using this interpretation scheme, EC is considered as an indicator of solute transportation, since EC is a function of dissolved ionic components. Total Pb is regarded as an indicator of particulate transportation, since Pb is strongly adsorbed to particulate substrates at the pH observed. Following these assumptions, particulate transport appears to dominate over dissolved transportation in the Moulouya. Total Pb increases by factors of 3. 4 and 9. 8 from dry to wet periods, whereas EC decreases by 0. 7 - 0. 8, as a result of rain dilution. In two of the four lakes, dissolved transport is comparatively more important, since EC does not change significantly and total Pb shows only a small increase from the dry to the wet period. In these lakes, the dissolved input during the rainy period appears to be large enough to keep EC at its previous value, without significant dilution, as opposed to what is going on in the Moulouya. In the two other lakes, both EC and total Pb decrease from the dry to the wet period, pointing to dilution effects greater than either dissolved or particulate mobilization. Apparent discrepancies in the intensity and direction of variations are explained when prevailing modes of dispersion are taken into account. For instance, the enrichment factor of total Pb in the Moulouya, downstream of Zeïda, jumps from 1. 1 (dry) to 3. 2 (wet), with respect to the reference station. Meanwhile, EC increases only from 1. 2 (dry) to 1. 5 (wet). The greater increase of total Pb over EC is explained by prevalent particulate transport. In another case, the enrichment of EC with respect to the reference station, in two lakes, increases from 14. 2 and 20. 4 (dry) to 20. 1 and 27. 9 (wet) while total Pb enrichment decreases from 2. 0 and 2. 0 (dry) to 1. 6 and 1. 3 (wet). Here, the prevalence of dissolved transport in these two lakes, combined with particulate transport at the reference station, allow for a strong increase in the EC parameter, concurrent with a weak increase in total Pb. Finally, in the lakes where both dissolved and particulate transport are presumably minor, total Pb undergoes enrichment with respect to the reference station, in the dry period (by 3. 4 and 1. 8), whereas depletion characterizes the wet period (0. 6 in both lakes). In this case, enrichment is likely the result of evaporation during the dry season, and depletion the result of dilution by rain during the wet period. These two types of lake behave differently because they are located next to residual mineral deposits (likely with more soluble phases), have short travel distances and thus fewer contacts with adsorbing substrates, which is not the case for the other two lakes...|$|E
