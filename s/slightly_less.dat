5|$|Kepler-10 is a G-type star located 173 parsecs (564 light years) from Earth. It is 0.895 {{solar masses}} and 1.056 solar radii, making it <b>slightly</b> <b>less</b> massive than the Sun, but {{approximately}} the same size.|$|E
5|$|If it {{advances}} much faster, {{then the}} tool becomes choked; conversely, if it advances much slower, then an interrupted or zig-zag cut occurs. In practice {{the rate of}} cut is <b>slightly</b> <b>less</b> than the ideal rate so that the load is released on the non-cutting edge of the tool.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-9c is a gas giant that {{is smaller}} and <b>slightly</b> <b>less</b> massive than planet Saturn. It is {{approximately}} 0.171 MJ, or 17% {{the mass of}} planet Jupiter. It also has a radius of 0.823 RJ, which makes it slightly smaller (1.5%) than Saturn. The planet is, on average, situated 0.225 AU from the star.|$|E

50|$|Compared to C. c. iolaema it is <b>slightly</b> larger, <b>less</b> blackish on the head, with paler {{upper part}} plumage, less intense orange on breast, and greyer plumage below. Flanks still greyer {{in the far}} south, and chest plumage yellower.|$|R
5|$|O'Malley liked clubhouse turmoil only <b>slightly</b> <b>less</b> than {{free agent}} disloyalty. When he traded Maury Wills to the Pittsburgh Pirates {{following}} consecutive National League pennants, it {{was attributed to}} Wills having quit {{during the middle of}} the Dodgers' post-season tour of Japan.|$|E
5|$|The Shingouz are aliens {{who make}} their first {{appearance}} in Ambassador of the Shadows and re-appear regularly throughout the subsequent albums. They are brown, short-furred creatures, <b>slightly</b> <b>less</b> than a metre tall, resembling flightless birds with a snout instead of a beak. Their appearance {{is reminiscent of the}} main characters in the Mad magazine comic strip Spy vs. Spy.|$|E
5|$|Alexander Rossi {{became the}} first American to drive in the United States Grand Prix at the Circuit of the Americas, {{returning}} to Manor Marussia after Roberto Merhi had raced for them in Russia. The Sauber team celebrated their 400th Grand Prix in Formula One. The weather was forecast to be wet all weekend, with especially treacherous conditions on Friday afternoon and Saturday, while the race day itself {{was expected to be}} <b>slightly</b> <b>less</b> wet.|$|E

5|$|Debs ran for {{president}} in the 1920 election while in prison in Atlanta, Georgia, at the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary. He received 919,799 votes (3.4%), <b>slightly</b> <b>less</b> than he had won in 1912, when he received 6%, {{the highest number of}} votes for a Socialist Party presidential candidate in the U.S. During his time in prison, Debs wrote a series of columns deeply critical of the prison system. They appeared in sanitized form in the Bell Syndicate and were published in his only book, Walls and Bars, with several added chapters. It was published posthumously.|$|E
5|$|Due to its electronegativity, oxygen forms {{chemical}} {{bonds with}} almost all other elements to give corresponding oxides. The surface of most metals, such as aluminium and titanium, are oxidized {{in the presence}} of air and become coated with a thin film of oxide that passivates the metal and slows further corrosion. Many oxides of the transition metals are non-stoichiometric compounds, with <b>slightly</b> <b>less</b> metal than the chemical formula would show. For example, the mineral FeO (wüstite) is written as , where x is usually around 0.05.|$|E
5|$|HAT-P-33b is {{a planet}} that has 0.764 Jupiter masses and 1.827 Jupiter radii. In other words, {{it is about}} three-fourths as massive as Jupiter, but is <b>slightly</b> <b>less</b> than twice Jupiter's size. HAT-P-33b orbits its star at an average {{distance}} of 0.0503 AU, which is about 5% of the average distance between the Sun and Earth. This orbit is completed every 3.474474 days (83.39 hours). HAT-P-33b has an equilibrium temperature of 1838 K, which is almost fifteen times hotter than the measured equilibrium temperature of Jupiter (124 K).|$|E
50|$|The {{border between}} Washington and Idaho {{was defined as}} the {{meridian}} running north from the confluence of the Clearwater River and the Snake River. Although this border {{is often referred to as}} the 117th meridian west longitude, the actual border line is <b>slightly</b> west (<b>less</b> than 2 miles) of the 117th meridian.|$|R

50|$|A smaller, <b>slightly</b> heavier, <b>less</b> luxurious {{and much}} cheaper 1.9 liter {{roadster}} using the Ponton class 4-cylinder engine {{was introduced in}} 1955 as the 190 SL. Both the 300 SL and the 190 SL were followed in the Mercedes line by the 230 SL. The more modern , nearly 200 mph, gull-winged Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG {{is regarded as the}} 300 SL's spiritual successor.|$|R
5|$|In September 2009, {{the most}} common type of microbe on the surface of Lake Chillisquaque was Oscillatoria, which made up {{approximately}} 75 percent of the total. Raphidiopsis was the second most common type, making up approximately 15 percent of the total. In May 2010, approximately 40 percent of the microbes were Navicula and 35 percent were Oscillatoria. <b>Slightly</b> <b>less</b> than 10 percent of the microbes are Anabaena. In July 2010, Oscillatoria and Synechococcus each made up approximately 25 percent of the microbes and between 10 and 15 percent were Anabaena.|$|E
5|$|Louis XVIII ruled as king for <b>slightly</b> <b>less</b> than a decade. The Bourbon Restoration {{regime was}} a {{constitutional}} monarchy (unlike the ancien régime, which was absolutist). As a constitutional monarch, Louis XVIII's royal prerogative was reduced substantially by the Charter of 1814, France's new constitution. Louis had no children; therefore, upon his death, the crown passed to his brother, Charles, Count of Artois. Louis XVIII {{was the last}} French monarch to die while reigning, as his successor Charles X (1824–1830) abdicated and both Louis Philippe I (1830–1848) and Napoléon III (1852–1870) were deposed.|$|E
5|$|Mars is {{approximately}} half {{the diameter of}} Earth with a surface area only <b>slightly</b> <b>less</b> than the total area of Earth's dry land. Mars is less dense than Earth, having about 15% of Earth's volume and 11% of Earth's mass, resulting in about 38% of Earth's surface gravity. The red-orange appearance of the Martian surface is caused by iron(III) oxide, or rust. It can look like butterscotch; other common surface colors include golden, brown, tan, and greenish, depending on the minerals present.|$|E
50|$|Nattfödd marks {{a change}} in the musical {{direction}} of Finntroll, as they drift into a <b>slightly</b> slower, <b>less</b> frenzied sound that is reminiscent of some songs from their first album, Midnattens widunder. It also incorporates some of the acoustic and ambient elements from their previous album, Visor om slutet, though is largely a return to the band's black and folk metal roots.|$|R
50|$|Shantung {{is a type}} of {{silk fabric}} {{historically}} from the province of Shandong. It is similar to Dupioni, but is <b>slightly</b> thinner and <b>less</b> irregular. Shantung is often used for bridal gowns.|$|R
2500|$|Campbell is {{involved}} with a side band, The Dirty Knobs. [...] "It's rougher-edged ," [...] Campbell says of the group. [...] "It's <b>slightly</b> over-driven, <b>less</b> polished, lots of Sixties influence: The Kinks, Led Zeppelin, The Animals. It's something I probably should have done a long time ago, but I didn't 'cause I was {{wrapped up in the}} Heartbreakers." [...] Some Dirty Knobs material has been recorded.|$|R
5|$|Niobium is <b>slightly</b> <b>less</b> {{electropositive}} {{and more}} compact {{than its predecessor}} in the periodic table, zirconium, whereas it is virtually identical in size to the heavier tantalum atoms, {{as a result of}} the lanthanide contraction. As a result, niobium's chemical properties are very similar to those for tantalum, which appears directly below niobium in the periodic table. Although its corrosion resistance is not as outstanding as that of tantalum, the lower price and greater availability make niobium attractive for less demanding applications, such as vat linings in chemical plants.|$|E
5|$|On October 27 {{the company}} began buying back all its {{commercial}} paper, valued at around $3.3 billion, {{in an effort to}} calm investor fears about Enron's supply of cash. Enron financed the re-purchase by depleting its lines of credit at several banks. While the company's debt rating was still considered investment-grade, its bonds were trading at levels <b>slightly</b> <b>less,</b> making future sales problematic.|$|E
5|$|Reviews {{of later}} ports have been <b>slightly</b> <b>less</b> positive; its Xbox 360 release has scores of 78% and 79% at GameRankings and Metacritic, respectively. Some critics, such as Adam Ghiggino of PALGN, felt the game had been insufficiently {{upgraded}} for its re-releases; Whitehead of Eurogamer wished online co-op had been implemented. Provo of GameSpot and Thomas of IGN wished Sega had re-released {{the game and}} its successor together as Sonic 3 & Knuckles instead.|$|E
50|$|It {{is similar}} to the red-throated pipit Anthus cervinus, which is more heavily {{streaked}} and (in summer only) has an orange-red throat, and to the tree pipit Anthus trivialis, which is <b>slightly</b> larger, <b>less</b> heavily streaked, and has stronger facial markings and a shorter hind claw. The song of the meadow pipit accelerates towards the end while that of the tree pipit slows down.|$|R
50|$|A tiger gong is a <b>slightly</b> {{descending}} or <b>less</b> commonly ascending gong, {{larger than}} an opera gong {{and with a}} less pronounced pitch shift. Most commonly 15 in but available down to 8 in.|$|R
50|$|Musically, {{the album}} has a <b>slightly</b> darker and <b>less</b> {{enhanced}} sound than World We View. Influences {{cited by the}} band at the time included Chevelle, Breaking Benjamin, Kutless, Decyfer Down, Disciple, and 12 Stones.|$|R
5|$|Silver is an {{extremely}} soft, ductile and malleable transition metal, though it is <b>slightly</b> <b>less</b> malleable than gold. Silver crystallizes in a face-centered cubic lattice with bulk coordination number 12, where only the single 5s electron is delocalized, similarly to copper and gold. Unlike metals with incomplete d-shells, metallic bonds in silver are lacking a covalent character and are relatively weak. This observation explains the low hardness and high ductility of single crystals of silver.|$|E
5|$|The {{concentration}} of dissolved oxygen in Fishing Creek ranges from approximately 5 to 17.5mg/L at Benton. A site near Camp Lavigne had <b>slightly</b> <b>less</b> variability, ranging from 8 to 17mg/L. The concentration near Bloomsburg ranged between 4.1 and 17.1mg/L, {{with an average}} of 10.9mg/L. The amount of carbon dioxide near Bloomsburg ranged from 0.3 to 34mg/L, {{with an average of}} 2.04mg/L.|$|E
5|$|This {{episode was}} one of the first seen by British viewers. It was the first episode to be {{broadcast}} on terrestrial television by the BBC on November 23, 1996 on a Saturday at 5:30pm, because the episodes were shown out of order. The episode was screened with five million viewers, <b>slightly</b> <b>less</b> than the show, Dad's Army, which previously held the timeslot. The episode also faced competition from ITV's screening of Sabrina the Teenage Witch.|$|E
50|$|A ride/crash cymbal {{is similar}} in design and {{function}} to a crash/ride, but <b>slightly</b> heavier and/or <b>less</b> tapered to optimise the ride rather than the crash function. It is far less common than the crash/ride.|$|R
30|$|In Figure 5, {{we present}} similar curves of the {{molecular}} complex {{density of states}} for three different separations between QDs. It is seen that the curves of the density of states are modified only <b>slightly,</b> essentially <b>less</b> than under variation of the magnetic field. Particularly, the lower energy peak positions are almost insensitive to any change of the distance between dots, while the upper energy peaks are noticeably displaced toward higher energy regions.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate if there were any diﬀerences in the physicochemical and sensory properties of organic and conventional potatoes (cv. Orla). The conventional potatoes had a lower dry matter content (P < 0. 05) and a slightly softer texture (P V 0. 05) than the organic potatoes. The trained panel perceived the conventional baked potato to be <b>slightly</b> softer, <b>less</b> adhesive and wetter than the organic baked potato (...|$|R
