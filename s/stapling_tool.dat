50|$|Hoglund was {{an early}} pioneer in the {{research}} and development of physical memory forensics, now considered standard practice in computer forensics in law enforcement. He saw the physical memory as a complex snapshot of interrelated structures and data arrays, instead of just a flatfile full of strings. The original application was not forensics, but rootkit detection and process hiding - showing how physical memory forensics grew partly from rootkit development. With the release of HBGary's product Responder in 2008, Hoglund {{was one of the first}} to deliver OS reconstruction to the market, pivotal in the use of physical memory to reconstruct software and user behavior. Responder PRO continues to be a <b>staple</b> <b>tool</b> for law enforcement and incident response today.|$|R
50|$|The Langdale {{industry}} {{was one of}} many which extracted hard stone for manufacture into polished axes. The Neolithic period was a time of settlement on the land, and the development of farming on a large scale. Maintenance of the forest cover was necessary in order to plant crops and rear animals, so axes were a <b>staple</b> <b>tool,</b> not just for clearance but also for wood working timber for houses, boats and other structures. Flint was probably the most widely used, simply because it was available from numerous flint mines in the downlands, such as Grimes Graves, Cissbury and Spiennes. Blades from roughing-out from flint and chert could also be used as small knives, arrowheads and other small sharp tools such as burins and awls.|$|R
50|$|One of the {{earliest}} home computers {{to make use of}} digital signal processing in the form of sampling was the Commodore Amiga in 1985. The computer's sound chip featured four independent 8-bit digital-to-analog converters. Developers could use this platform to take samples of a music performance, sometimes just a single note long, and play it back through the computer's sound chip from memory. This differed from Rally-X in that its hardware DAC was used to play back simple waveform samples, and a sampled sound allowed for a complexity and authenticity of a real instrument that an FM simulation could not offer. For its role in being one of the first and affordable, the Amiga would remain a <b>staple</b> <b>tool</b> of early sequenced music composing, especially in Europe.|$|R
40|$|Intersectional Theory {{emerged in}} the field of Law as an attempt to {{understand}} oppression and injustice that did not work according to stable racial and/or gender identities (Grillo 18). Its focus on the intersecting nature of sources of oppression sought {{to address the problem of}} policy making, which, by adhering to identity politics, did not reach the individuals who were most in need of assistance — exactly those who were vulnerable to multiple forms of injustice and who did not register in policy makers’ grid of stable identities. If policies directed towards black populations missed the vicissitudes of living as a black woman, women’s politics sometimes overlooked women who also had to live with the marking of race. Despite the radical changes in practical governmental practices requested by Intersectional Theory, it has been embraced and absorbed as a <b>staple</b> <b>tool</b> in critical theory and feminist criticism (Deckha 249) ...|$|R

The {{bridge plug}} is a <b>staple</b> <b>tool</b> used in {{downhole}} operation {{and the performance}} of the slips has a directly influence on the oil well productivity and production safety. We raised an optimize method based on BP network and genetic algorithm to make sure the slips satisfy the high temperature and high pressure demands. Establishing the slips system and making finite element analysis by ANSYS, abtaining sixteen group datas to constitute the BP network training samples, establishing the BP simulation model reflecting curvature radius of the slip fluke, dip angle of the fluke, angle of the fluke and distance between flukes using nonlinearity mapping ability of the neural network, applying optimize design for the simulation model using global optimization ability of the genetic algorithm and abtaining the optimum structure parameters of the slip. The optimized results indicate the whole performance of the slips system has increased notably...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, data science and machine {{learning}} {{has grown from}} a mysterious art form to a <b>staple</b> <b>tool</b> across a variety of fields in academia, business, and government. In this paper, we introduce the concept of tree-based pipeline optimization for automating one of the most tedious parts of machine learning [...] -pipeline design. We implement a Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool (TPOT) and demonstrate its effectiveness on a series of simulated and real-world genetic data sets. In particular, we show that TPOT can build machine learning pipelines that achieve competitive classification accuracy and discover novel pipeline operators [...] -such as synthetic feature constructors [...] -that significantly improve classification accuracy on these data sets. We also highlight the current challenges to pipeline optimization, such as the tendency to produce pipelines that overfit the data, and suggest future research paths to overcome these challenges. As such, this work represents an early step toward fully automating machine learning pipeline design. Comment: 16 pages, 5 figures, to appear in EvoBIO 2016 proceeding...|$|R
40|$|Fourier {{analysis}} techniques {{remain the}} <b>staple</b> <b>tools</b> for {{the processing of}} sinusoidal signals with stationary frequency content. These techniques however, are unsuitable {{for the analysis of}} signals with time-varying frequency content such as those with frequency and amplitude modulation unless approximations regarding stationarity are made over smaller signal time windows. In this paper, we study and extend a recently introduced Sturm-Liouville model for both continuous and discrete FM modulation for the purpose of studying orthogonal modes of continuous and discrete FM modulation. These FM modes are first shown to form an orthogonal system and further shown to have the same connection with respect to the FM Sturm-Liouville system operator, that complex exponentials or sinusoids have with LTI systems and the convolution operator. The notion of a finite Sturm-Liouville FM spectrum that measures the strength of the orthogonal FM modes present in a FM signal analogous to the Finite Fourier Transform, is formally introduced.

40|$|Near-surface {{geophysical}} methods can {{provide information on}} subsurface structure and stratigraphy that is critical to understanding surficial processes. Gravity, magnetics, resistivity, electromagnetics, ground-penetrating radar, and various seismic methods are applied {{across a range of}} process domains, including faulting, volcanism, topography and weathering, hillslope processes, coastal and sea-level change, aeolian and fluvial processes, and glacial and periglacial processes. Gravity and magnetic methods have long been used to image faults and other tectonic and volcanic features, and they have also been used to document weathering patterns. With the development of multi-electrode resistivity systems, resistivity profiling has become a <b>staple</b> <b>tool</b> to map the structure and water content of slope deposits and volcanic features. Ground-penetrating radar studies have been crucial to understanding of geologic features as varied as the internal structure of aeolian dunes, coastal and fluvial deposits, the structure and volume of glaciers, the spatial distribution of sinkholes, and the geometry of tephra and lahar deposits. Key to successful studies are calibrations against direct observations and/or uses of multiple complementary methods. Increased efficiencies in geophysical data acquisition and positioning in recent years have made possible very-high-resolution three-dimensional (3 -D) or quasi- 3 -D imaging of subsurface structures. However, there is still a mismatch in the typical spatial scales of large remote-sensing-based studies and smaller geophysical surveys. Bridging this disconnect with new geophysical acquisition techniques and new instrumentation such as terrestrial laser scanning should improve our understanding of the role that subsurface structure plays in the evolution of topography...|$|R

500|$|The {{principal}} export {{from the}} Red River settlements was fur, {{but as the}} colony passed from a subsistence economy to one producing more than could be consumed locally the agricultural surplus was also sent south by ox cart. The imports were more varied; originally they were seed, spices, and other <b>staples,</b> liquor, <b>tools,</b> implements, and hardware. In midcentury the buffalo herds declined, and traffic in furs began {{to be replaced by}} the produce and needs of settlers. [...] As settlement developed the trails became a [...] "common carrier" [...] for all manner of goods that could be carried by ox cart, including lamps and coal oil to burn in them, fine cloth, books, general merchandise, champagne, sheet-metal stoves, disassembled farm machinery and at least one piano, and a printing press and other accoutrements for the first newspaper in the Fort Garry region.|$|R
40|$|The {{habitability}} of {{our planet}} depends on interlocking climate and biogeochemical systems. Living organisms have played key roles {{in the evolution of}} these systems. Now man is perturbing the climate/biogeochemical systems at an unprecedented pace. In particular, the global carbon cycle is being forced directly by changes in carbon fluxes (e. g. fossil fuel burning and deforestation/reforestation), and indirectly through changes in atmospheric chemistry (e. g. stratospheric ozone depletion and increases of green house gases). Nutrient cycles are also being perturbed, with implications for the carbon cycle. It is imperative that we learn how these changing conditions will influence terrestrial and oceanic photosynthesis and biogeochemistry. Understanding the controls on primary productivity of the biosphere is one of the fundamental aims of global change research. This forum addresses several key questions regarding the role of the biota in the carbon cycle. It begins with Ian Woodward's overview of the global carbon cycle and concludes with John Raven's historical perspective of the negative feedbacks that influenced the evolution of embryophytes in the Devonian. In between, the forum focuses on the process of net primary production (NPP). Despite differences in the structures of planktonic and terrestrial ecosystems, notably of response of biomass to environmental change, there are common problems affecting both terrestrial and oceanic studies of NPP. This has resulted in the parallel evolution of approaches to NPP research in very different milieux involving advances in the technology required to study interacting processes that cut across a range of space and time scales (Table 1). The problems include estimating NPP of whole plants and phytoplankton populations from gas exchange measurements on leaves or subpopulations, accounting for heterotrophic metabolism in gas exchange measurements, extrapolating from small scales to global NPP (Table 2), developing mechanistic models of NPP and biomass accumulation, and relating NPP to the cycling of other elements. Although small-scale measurements {{will continue to be a}} <b>staple</b> <b>tool</b> in investigations of NPP, use of open system measurements systems have necessarily come to the fore. These include free-air CO 2 exchange in terrestrial systems and water mass tracking in aquatic systems. Deliberate experimental manipulations will increasingly supplement correlative studies to derive insights into environmental regulation of NPP and the feedback between plant productivity and biogeochemical cycles...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 40) Cascading Style Sheets, {{better known}} as CSS, have become a <b>staple</b> <b>tool</b> in web design. CSS {{is the way in}} which web designers separate the presentation or design of a web site from the structure or the markup. By using CSS, a modification on the web style or presentation of a website can be handled in one place. CSS the idea is to generate very clean HTML markup that has absolutely no built-in styling. That means a separate file with a. css extension is created to define tag styles. This CSS file can be easily linked to the HTML and it tell the browser how the header tag should look. Any changes you make on that CSS file in the future will instantly be reflected on the site without having to change any of the site's HTML. The salient feature of using a separate CSS file is in bandwidth and load times. Most modern browsers will cache any files with a. css extension. It means the visitors to the site will have less to download and make the site appear faster. Any change made to the CSS file, will ensure that the browser will be able to recognize the difference and reload the cached copy it has on file. This way people can see the current version of the CSS used site's design instantly. CSS can even be used to style other sites (the ones you don't control) as well. Some browsers have extensions that have been developed to allow us to overwrite a websites style with a CSS file on our local machine. This is especially common with some of the more popular web applications like free email services from the major providers. So creating a Cascading Style Sheets is a must for any web design professional. So my work "CASCADING STYLE SHEET GENERATOR" simplifies the process of creating a CSS file. This CSS generator has the 1. Flexibility to choose header styles 2. Applying any format to the sheet 3. Can be linked to any of the HTML 4. Support most of the popular browsers 5. Easily downloadable 6. Uses advanced technology such as PHP and Java Script This tool is intended for user who already have basic understanding of HTML tags and CSS attributes...|$|R
5000|$|In 1868, C.S. Peirce {{argued that}} there is no power of intuition {{in the sense of a}} {{cognition}} unconditioned by inference, and no power of introspection, intuitive or otherwise, and that awareness of an internal world is by hypothetical inference from external facts. Introspection and intuition were <b>staple</b> philosophical <b>tools</b> at least since Descartes. He {{argued that there}} is no absolutely first cognition in a cognitive process; such a process has its beginning but can always be analyzed into finer cognitive stages. That which we call introspection does not give privileged access to knowledge about the mind—the self is a concept that is derived from our interaction with the external world and not the other way around (De Waal 2005, pp. 7-10). At the same time he held persistently that pragmatism and epistemology in general could not be derived from principles of psychology understood as a special science: what we do think is too different from what we should think; in his [...] "Illustrations of the Logic of Science" [...] series, Peirce formulated both pragmatism and principles of statistics as aspects of scientific method in general. This is an important point of disagreement with most other pragmatists, who advocate a more thorough naturalism and psychologism.|$|R
40|$|Interviews are a <b>staple</b> data {{collection}} <b>tool</b> in {{social science research}} and in recent decades have been increasingly formalised and systematised. However, due to the specific affordances and constraints of virtual worlds, researchers cannot simply replicate traditional interview techniques in virtual worlds without careful consideration of the specific features of the technology. For example the prominent use of text as the medium for communication, role of the avatar, interview location and inworld objects have implications for all inworld research interviews. Building on the foundation of traditional interviews in educational research and the current literature on inworld interviews, this chapter focuses {{on the use of}} text communication tools in both one-to-one and group interviews inworld. Based on previous research by the authors the opportunities, implications, constraints and techniques for conducting text based interviews inworld are discussed. The chapter concludes with a set of guidelines for researchers considering the use of inworld text based interviews...|$|R
