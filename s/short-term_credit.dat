25|$|Since 1979 {{commercial}} farming {{has replaced}} subsistence farming {{as the dominant}} mode of agricultural production. Some northern and western areas support rain-fed agriculture, while other areas require irrigation for successful crop production. The 1979 Revolution sought self-sufficiency in foodstuffs {{as part of its}} overall goal of decreased economic dependence on the West. Higher government subsidies for grain and other staples and expanded <b>short-term</b> <b>credit</b> and tax exemptions for farmers complying with government quotas were intended by the new regime to promote self-sufficiency. But by early 1987, Iran was actually more dependent on agricultural imports than in the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|Wonga {{was founded}} by Errol Damelin (chief {{executive}} officer) in October 2006 and he linked up with software engineer Jonty Hurwitz in January 2007. Both Damelin and Hurwitz had previous internet start-up experience; neither had any experience of retail banking. When the company first started looking for funding, potential investors saw the short-term, small-loans business as an unprofitable, risky backwater. After being denied funding by UK banks, Wonga secured venture capital through Balderton Capital. The first place of business was in a shared office space in St. John's Wood, London. After a year of software development a beta website was launched in 2007. In interviews, Damelin {{has said that the}} goal was to disrupt the <b>short-term</b> <b>credit</b> industry by providing transparency, exact control of amount and payment date, immediate access to funds, and no faxing or emailing documents. The business model of lending only to those who could pay back reliably, as opposed to the much wider catchment practice of payday loans required an algorithm that could fully determine risk in an automated manner – something they had difficulty developing in the early stages. To get funds directly to customer's bank accounts as quickly as possible, co-operation from leading banks was required. Banks were reportedly dismissive of Wonga's plan saying they would not be totally satisfied with customer identity without physical documentation.|$|E

2500|$|A {{minority}} of mainstream banks and TxtLoan companies lending <b>short-term</b> <b>credit</b> over mobile phone text messaging offer virtual credit advances for customers whose paychecks or other funds are deposited electronically into their accounts. The terms {{are similar to}} those of a payday loan; a customer receives a predetermined cash credit available for immediate withdrawal. The amount is deducted, along with a fee, usually about 10 percent of the amount borrowed, when the next direct deposit is posted to the customer's account. After the programs attracted regulatory attention, Wells Fargo called its fee [...] "voluntary" [...] and offered to waive it for any reason. It later scaled back the program in several states. [...] Wells Fargo currently offers its version of a payday loan, called [...] "Direct Deposit Advance," [...] which charges 120% APR.

50|$|As {{explained}} in the general article on the economic history of the Netherlands under the Republic, the Dutch entrepôt function was very important.

By prolonging and rolling-over such <b>short-term</b> <b>credits,</b> suppliers and customers could easily be tied to the entrepôt.

40|$|The IMF was {{established}} in 1944 in part to “give confidence” to member countries by providing <b>short-term</b> <b>credits.</b> Although the intention was that {{the availability of the}} Fund’s resources should prevent countries from experiencing financial crises, in practice the institution often has found itself helping its members cope with crises after they occur.

40|$|We analyze a model where {{foreign banks}} finance local {{long-term}} projects by <b>short-term</b> <b>credits</b> that are denominated in foreign currency. The foreign banks face {{two kinds of}} risk: the macro-economic risk of a currency crisis, and the micro-economic risk of project failure. There are no bailout guarantees against either of these risks. We assume that the foreign banks move sequentially, obtain a private signal about the micro risk associated with the projects they consider financing, and observe the actions of all previous foreign banks. We analyze the equilibrium of this model and show that it is generally inefficient. In particular, {{for a wide range}} of parameter values, foreign banks provide too many credits too easily and thus generate an inefficiently high risk of a currency crisis. For other parameter values, they inefficiently provide no credits at all. We demonstrate how the imposition of capital controls through taxes and subsidies on <b>short-term</b> foreign <b>credit</b> can improve the situation. Our analysis differs from other papers on currency crises in at least two regards: we do not assume that foreign banks enjoy bailout guarantees, and we concentrate on the foreign banks' incentives for providing credit rather than on their incentives to withdraw the credit provided once a crisis is anticipated. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} unified model of {{sovereign}} debt, trade credit and international reserves. Our model shows {{that access to}} <b>short-term</b> trade <b>credit</b> and gross international reserves critically affect the outcome of sovereign debt renegotiations. Whereas competitive banks do optimally lend for the accumulation of borrowed reserves that strengthen the bargaining position of borrowers, they also have incentives to restrict the supply of <b>short-term</b> trade <b>credit</b> during renegotiations. We first show that they effectively do so and then derive propositions that : I) establish the size of sovereign debt haircuts {{as a function of}} economic fundamentals and preferences; II) predict that defaults occur during recessions rather than booms, contrary to reputation based models; III) provide a rationale for holding costly borrowed reserves and, IV) show that the stock of borrowed international reserves tends to increase when global interest rates are low. ...|$|R
