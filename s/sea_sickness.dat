5000|$|The 2012 Celtic Challenge {{began at}} 4:00pm on Saturday, May 5th 2012. Conditions were rough {{throughout}} {{the first night}} and of the 23 crews who entered the event, only 12 completed the crossing, with several teams being forced to retire from the race. The majority of the withdrawals were due to multiple <b>sea</b> <b>sicknesses,</b> whilst other crews pulled out due to issues with support boats, one case of a lost tiller and one punctured RIB (Rigid-hulled inflatable boat). The first team to cross the finish line in Aberystwyth were the Aberdyfi men's team, {{with a time of}} 17 hours, 50 minutes and 4 seconds. The first Mixed team to finish were Foyle RC of Moville, Co. Donegal, Ireland. The first (and indeed, only) ladies' team to complete the challenge were Arklow Ladies. Despite the harsh sea and wind conditions, an all novice crew from Shropshire successfully completed the crossing in just shy of 26 hours. General consensus amongst the Welsh and Irish sea rowing community was that the 2012 Celtic Challenge was the most difficult so far, with a member of the winning team from Aberdyfi describing the experience as [...] "like rowing uphill through concrete".|$|R

40|$|Background: A {{substantial}} number of individuals {{are at risk for}} the development of motion sickness induced nausea and vomiting (N&V) during road, air or <b>sea</b> travel. Motion <b>sickness</b> can be extremely stressful but the neurobiologic mechanisms leading to motion sickness are not clear. The endocannabinoid system (ECS) represents an important neuromodulator of stress and N&V. Inhibitory effects of the ECS on N&V are mediated by endocannabinoid-receptor activation. Methodology/Principal Findings: We studied the activity of the ECS in human volunteers (n = 21) during parabolic flight maneuvers (PFs). During PFs, microgravity conditions (, 10 22 g) are generated for approximately 22 s which results in a profound kinetic stimulus. Blood endocannabinoids (anandamide and 2 -arachidonoylglycerol, 2 -AG) were measured from blood samples taken in-flight before start of the parabolic maneuvers, after 10, 20, and 30 parabolas, in-flight after termination of PFs and 24 h later. Volunteers who developed acute motion sickness (n = 7) showed significantly higher stress scores but lower endocannabinoid levels during PFs. After 20 parabolas, blood anandamide levels had dropped significantly in volunteers with motion sickness (from 0. 3960. 40 to 0. 2260. 25 ng/ml) but increased in participants without the condition (from 0. 4360. 23 to 0. 6060. 38 ng/ml) resulting in significantly higher anandamide levels in participants without motion sickness (p = 0. 02). 2 -AG levels in individuals with motion sickness were low and almost unchanged throughout the experiment but showed a robust increase in participants without motion sickness.

40|$|Colour {{words have}} been studied through {{different}} perspectives, including scientific, philosophical and anthropological. Although some linguistic research in colour words has been undertaken, an in-depth linguistic study of the colour words used by a literary figure such as Shakespeare has not previously been attempted. A study such as this could be divided into primary or basic colour words, on the one hand, or secondary colour words, on the other hand. This thesis follows the first option and studies the semantics of colour words through their collocates in Shakespeare's works. The thesis considers first the occurrence of colour words in history and culture, the nature of collocation and a review of works on collocation in Shakespeare. The {{major part of the}} thesis is devoted to the analysis of the seven basic colours that appear first in the hierarchy outlined by Berlin and Kay. Following Berlin and Kay, white and black are considered as colour words {{for the purposes of this}} thesis. The seven basic colour words used are white, black, red, green, yellow, blue and brown. An exception to this rule is that tawny is considered with brown to examine whether an extension of the consideration of colour words might be significant. The remaining basic colour words are not examined in my thesis because they do not occur frequently in Shakespeare's works. Naturally where other colour words, basic and secondary, occur in a collocation with one of the basic colour words examined in the thesis, they are given due attention. The thesis consists of ten chapters. Chapter 1 introduces the reader to the subject by including an introductory survey of the linguistic and literary problems of my work. Chapter 2 outlines the approach and methodology employed in dealing with the colour words. The collocates are collected from Spevack's concordance of Shakespeare's works. This chapter also indicates the organisation and categorisation of the colour words and the texts which have been employed. The Oxford Shakespeare: William Shake. sppeare: The ('omplete Works is used as the main source because it is the most up-to-date, complete and easily accessible one-volume modern spelling text. 7 Chapter 3 deals with the collocates of white. It includes 169 quotations whose collocates are grouped under six categories: (parts of the body, nature, cloth, emotional/ moral attitude, white with other colours and miscellaneous). Chapter 4 deals with the collocates of black. It includes 202 quotations to cover the following semantic fields (night, dress/mask, death/mourning and funeral, parts of the body/complexion, devil'-'v. il. disaster, black and other colours, ink/writing, emotional/moral attitude, miscellaneous). Chapter 5 deals with the collocates of red. It includes 107 quotations to cover the following semantic fields (parts of the body, blood, emotional/moral attitude, disease, red and other colours, nature and miscellaneous). Chapter 6 deals with the collocates of green. It includes 113 quotations with the following categories (<b>sea,</b> nature, immaturity, <b>sickness,</b> eye and miscellaneous). Chapter 7 deals with the collocates of yellow. It includes 35 quotations with the following categories (cloth, youth/immaturity, old age/decay, nature, disease/jealousy and yellow and other colours. Chapter 8 deals with the collocates of blue. It includes 35 quotations with the following categories (parts of the human body, dress, nature, blue and other colours and miscellaneous). And Chapter 9 deals with the collocates of brown & tawny. Brown includes 25 quotations with the following categories (hair/head, complexion, food/drink, brown and other colours and miscellaneous). Tawny includes 8 quotations with the following categories (complexion, lifelessness, cloth, tawny and other colours and miscellaneous). Chapter 10 summaries my research and pinpoints the openings for further investigation in this area of study. Further research might, for instance, cover a study of a wider area of secondary colours and a thorough analysis of the vocabulary where the colour word is implied and not explicitly expressed...|$|R

2500|$|Phelps {{was anxious}} {{to go out to}} sea, but the Independence {{remained}} in port for several months. On May 14, 1842, he finally got his first such orders, boarded the Independence and headed for Boston. Phelps found his first day at see exhilarating, however, as the sea became more rough, the young Phelps had to deal with <b>sea</b> <b>sickness</b> by stomping on the deck while marching from stem to stern. As a Midshipman, his visit to Boston marked the end of his probationary period, at which time his captain would decide if Phelps was fit to continue service, and Phelps was approved. When he learned that the USS Columbus needed Midshipman for its service in the Mediterranean he wanted to transfer. To get past the six month required service as Midshipman for that position, he wrote to Ohio representative Elisha Whittlesey in Washington D.C. for a transfer. [...] Upon Whittlesey's recommendation, at age seventeen, Seth's appointment to Midshipman was made on October 24, 1841. He transferred to Columbus, a ship of the line, and when his orders arrived he served the next three years with the Mediterranean Squadron, considered the choicest of the several active U.S. squadrons stationed about the globe. The Columbus was an old ship that had seen years of duty. When Phelps reported aboard he found the ship's rigging, sails and other fixtures in very poor condition. [...] Before departing from Boston, Phelps and other crew members were given the task of replacing the ship's ropes and sails with new ones. After weeks of repairs, the Columbus finally departed Boston and on August 24, 1842 Phelps was at sea for the first time. While aboard, Midshipmen were required to continue their education, studying mathematics and schooled in the ways of navigation, weapons, along with knot tying classes, where more than fifty knots, splices and hitches had to be mastered.|$|E

50|$|Ship motions have {{physiological}} {{effects on}} ship passengers and crew. The magnitudes and accelerations of ship motions, (particularly heave, roll and pitch) have {{adverse effects on}} passengers and shipboard personnel. <b>Sea</b> <b>sickness</b> will have negative effects {{on the ability of}} crew to accomplish tasks and maintain alertness and will obviously distress passengers. An important metric in evaluating <b>sea</b> <b>sickness</b> is the Motion Sickness Incidence (MSI). The most important study on MSI was published in Aerospace Medicine by O'Hanlon and McCauley in 1974, which established common subjective thresholds of MSI tolerance. MSI is measured in percentage of people who experience <b>sea</b> <b>sickness</b> during a given amount of exposure time. A commonly accepted limit of MSI is 20% occurrence of <b>sea</b> <b>sickness</b> over a four-hour exposure period. A small percentage of people are very susceptible to <b>sea</b> <b>sickness</b> and become ill even in the slightest conditions, while other people rarely get sea sick despite severe conditions.
