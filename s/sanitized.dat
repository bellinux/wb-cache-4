5|$|Debs ran for {{president}} in the 1920 election while in prison in Atlanta, Georgia, at the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary. He received 919,799 votes (3.4%), slightly less than he had won in 1912, when he received 6%, {{the highest number of}} votes for a Socialist Party presidential candidate in the U.S. During his time in prison, Debs wrote a series of columns deeply critical of the prison system. They appeared in <b>sanitized</b> form in the Bell Syndicate and were published in his only book, Walls and Bars, with several added chapters. It was published posthumously.|$|E
5|$|The theatre reputedly {{fell into}} {{disrepair}} under the Brars. In 1998, the Princess was called “an absolutely lousy advertisement for late 20th century privatization” by Magic Lantern Theatre’s Rick Ostapchuk, {{who said that}} the current owners had allowed the theatre to sink “with the velocity, if not the <b>sanitized</b> H20, of a waterslide”. By his count, 170 of the marquee’s 330 lights were burnt out, and he did not believe the interior had been regularly washed or maintained.|$|E

Alcohol is an effective sanitizer against influenza viruses, while quaternary ammonium compounds {{can be used with}} alcohol so that the <b>sanitizing</b> effect lasts for longer. In hospitals, quaternary ammonium compounds and bleach are used to <b>sanitize</b> rooms or equipment that have been occupied by patients with influenza symptoms. At home, this can be done effectively with a diluted chlorine bleach.|$|R
5|$|After the E.coli outbreak, Odwalla {{improved}} {{the safety of}} several of its production processes. Before the fruit enters the factory, it is washed, sorted and <b>sanitized.</b> Once it has reached the plant, the apples, carrots, and citrus fruits are separated and washed again. The fruit is pressed to get the juice, which is then flash pasteurized and bottled. A sample undergoes quality testing, and, if it passes, the batch is shipped in refrigerated trucks to various distribution centers in the United States. Odwalla juice has a relatively short shelf life compared to other beverages and thus must be refrigerated. However, after the introduction of flash pasteurization in 1996 and a new plastic bottle in 2001, the shelf life has been considerably extended. Generally, Odwalla products are sold in special Odwalla-brand displays at grocery and convenience stores, instead of being intermixed with other products.|$|E
5|$|In a subplot, Bart and Lisa {{stay at the}} Springfield Retirement Castle with Grandpa, {{and they}} {{discover}} a metal detector in his closet. While Bart uses it to look for pirate treasure, they uncover an alternate ending to Casablanca. After playing the scene on a projector screen {{it turns out to}} be a very <b>sanitized</b> and typical Hollywood happy end, where Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman marry in the end. Bart, Lisa and Granpa all like it but one of the spectators, The Old Jewish Man, reveals that he was once a studio executive and actually tried to include this happy ending to the film. Ashamed and disgruntled, he pays Bart and Lisa to re-bury the film reel, giving them another film reel to bury along with it, titled It's A Wonderful Life (Killing Spree Ending).|$|E
5|$|Transmission {{may occur}} via {{consumption}} of contaminated water, or when people share personal objects. In places with {{wet and dry}} seasons, water quality typically worsens during the wet season, and this correlates with the time of outbreaks. In {{areas of the world}} with four seasons, infections are more common in the winter. Bottle-feeding of babies with improperly <b>sanitized</b> bottles is a significant cause on a global scale. Transmission rates are also related to poor hygiene, especially among children, in crowded households, and in those with pre-existing poor nutritional status. After developing tolerance, adults may carry certain organisms without exhibiting signs or symptoms, and thus act as natural reservoirs of contagion. While some agents (such as Shigella) only occur in primates, others may occur {{in a wide variety of}} animals (such as Giardia).|$|E
40|$|Context: Footwear {{should be}} {{designed}} to avoid trauma and injury to {{the skin of the}} feet that can favor bacterial and fungal infections. Procedures and substances for <b>sanitizing</b> the interior of shoes are uncommon but are important aspects of primary prevention against foot infections and unpleasant odor. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of a <b>sanitizing</b> technique for reducing bacterial and fungal contamination of footwear. Design: Crossover study. Setting: Mens Sana basketball team. Patients or Other Participants: Twenty-seven male athletes and 4 coaches (62 shoes). Intervention(s) : The experimental protocol required a first sample (swab), 1 /shoe, at time 0 from inside the shoes of allathletes before the <b>sanitizing</b> technique began and a second sample at time 1, after about 4 weeks, April 2012 to May 2012, of daily use of the <b>sanitizing</b> technique. Main Outcome Measure(s) : The differences before and after use of the <b>sanitizing</b> technique for total bacterial count at 368 C and 228 C for Staphylococcus spp, yeasts, molds, Enterococcus spp, Pseudomonas spp, Escherichia coli, and total coliform bacteria were evaluated. Results: Before use of the <b>sanitizing</b> technique, the total bacterial counts at 368 C and 228 C and for Staphylococcus sppwere greater by a factor of 5. 8 (95...|$|R

25|$|The {{required}} {{degree of}} treatment for the collected dried feces depends entirely on whether this product will be reused in agriculture. If it is not reused, but only buried, then no further treatment is required. The dried feces are in almost all cases not entirely <b>sanitized</b> when removed from a vault of the UDDT, so careful handling is obligatory. In scenarios wherein excreta is to be reused in agriculture, a secondary treatment of fecal matter and storage of urine is advisable to ensure adequate sanitization. Fecal material from single vault UDDTs must always be post-treated, even if just via prolonged storage. Fecal material from double vaults has typically passed a certain storage time and is therefore already more <b>sanitized.</b> However, a secondary form of treatment is optional but recommended for household systems and required for large-scale systems.|$|E

40|$|Small {{and very}} small {{slaughterhouses}} generally spray lactic acid for carcass decontamination utilizing a hand held sprayer. Even though this tool represents {{a very small}} investment, it may present important disadvantages such as uneven delivery of the spray over the carcass surface. If the decontamination treatment is not applied properly, the untreated areas of the carcass will still have high bacterial loads present and could be a source for recontamination of the areas that have been treated. A sanitizer spraying system (<b>sanitizing</b> halo system) was designed and assembled. The <b>sanitizing</b> halo system was tested at the Rosenthal Meat Science and Technology Center, Texas A&M University. Thirteen carcasses were split in halves. Thirteen halves were sampled and used as control after knife trimming and water wash; then they were sprayed with 2 % L-Lactic at 55 ????C with the <b>sanitizing</b> halo system. The other 13 halves were sprayed by the RMSTC employees utilizing a hand held sprayer. Counts of aerobic and mesophilic bacteria obtained from carcasses sprayed with the <b>sanitizing</b> halo system and the hand held sprayer were both {{significantly lower than the}} control counts. In addition, coliforms counts were below the detectable limit for the <b>sanitizing</b> halo system and the hand held sprayer. After testing, the <b>sanitizing</b> halo system was installed at two small commercial slaughter plants processing beef and pork carcasses. At each slaughter plant, 24 carcass halves were treated with 2 % L-Lactic at 55 ????C using the <b>sanitizing</b> halo system, and the other 24 halves were used as control. Mesophilic bacteria populations were reduced in beef and pork carcasses by 2. 9 and 1. 9 log cycles, respectively, after the lactic acid treatment. Also E. coli counts were significantly lower in the three regions sampled after application of the 2 % L-Lactic acid with the <b>sanitizing</b> halo system. From the data collected during this study, we recommend the <b>sanitizing</b> halo system as a tool to reduce the bacterial loads on the surface of beef and pork carcasses. The use of this system should help small and very small slaughterhouses to improve food safety performance while providing cost-efficiency, simplicity, and convenience...|$|R
